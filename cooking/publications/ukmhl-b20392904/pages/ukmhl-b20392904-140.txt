THE CONFECTIONER. 128 Precipitate the solution with muriate of potash, sulphuret of potash or soda, line the inside of a funnel with blotting paper, and put it in a bottle or jar, pour on the precipitated indigo, and wash out the acid by passing filtered or distilled water through it; if any of the colour passes through in the last wash- ing, precipitate it as before ; it may be either dried or kept in water for use. Prussian Blue may be used instead of indigo, if preferred, but must be used sparingly, as it contains prussic acid; it is prepared from blood, hoofs, &c., of animals, being burnt with potash, and combined with a solution of iron. Sap Green.—This is prepared from the fruit of the buckthorn, and is purgative. Spinach Green*—^This is perfectly harmless, and will answer most purposes. Wash and drain a suf- ficient quantity of spinach, pound it well in a mortar, and squeeze the pounded leaves in a coarse cloth to extract all the juice; put it in a pan and set it on a good fire, and stir it occasionally until it curdles, which will be when it is at the boiling point; then take it off and strain off the water with a fine sieve; the residue left is the green; dry it and rub it through a lawn sieve. This is only fit for opaque bodies, such as ices, creams, or syrups. Another green is made with a mixture of saffron or gamboge, and prepared indigo; the lighter the green the more yellow must be used. Vermilion and Cinnabar are preparations of mer- cury, and should never be used; they are of a lively red colour, but carmine will answer most purposes instead. Bole Ammoniac,—There is also the French and German bole. These earths are of a pale red, and possess alexipharmic qualities; they are frequently used in confectionary for painting and gilding.

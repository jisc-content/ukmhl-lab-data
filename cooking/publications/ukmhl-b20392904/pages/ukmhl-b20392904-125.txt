THE CONFECTIONER. 113 fore the artist must be guided by his own genius and fancy.* SECTION XXI.â€”GUM PASTE. Take one ounce of picked gum-tragacanth; wash it in water, to take off any dust or dirt; put it into a clean pot, and pour on it rather more less half a pint of water, or sufficient to cover the gum about an inch; stir it frequently, to accelerate the solution; it will take twenty-four hours to dissolve; then squeeze it out through a coarse cloth, as directed for lozenges, taking care that everything employed in the making is very clean, or it will spoil the colour; put it into a mortar, adding gradually six or eight ounces of treble- refined sugar, sifted through a lawn sieve; work it well with the pestle, until it is incorporated and becomes a very white smooth paste; put it into a glazed pot, cover the paste with a damp cloth, and turn the pot upside-down on an even surface, to ex- clude the air. When it is wanted, take a little of it and put it on a clean marble, and work some more sugar into it (which has been sifted through a lawn sieve) with the fingers, until it is a firm paste, which will break when pulled; if it is not stiff enough, it will roll up under the knife when you cut it from the impressions in your paste boards; if it is too stiff, work in a little of your prepared paste with it, to soften it. When your paste works harsh and cracks, it has too much gum in it; in this case use a little water to work it down ; and if the gum is too thin it will crack, and dry too soon from the excess of sugar, therefore add some more strained gum that has not been mixed with sugar. The same observations also * An excellent work for the use of the ornamental confec- tioner is Page's ' Acanthus,' which may be obtained of any bookseller. t

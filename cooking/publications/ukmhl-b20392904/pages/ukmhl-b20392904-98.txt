86 THE CONFECTIONER, gather the fruit daring dry weather, and fill thft bottles if possible on the same day; shake the fruit well down by knocking the bottom edge of the bottle on the table; prepare some corks or bungs (which are made for fruit bottles by being cut the contrary way of the grain); pour boiling water over them, which will deprive them of any smell or dirt; repeat this a second time, if necessary, letting them remain in the water each time until it is cold; cork the bottles well, and tie them over with wire or string. M. Appert recommends that they should be luted with a mixture made of fresh slaked lime and soft cheese; this is to be spread on rags and tied over the mouth of the bottle; they are then placed in a boiler and cold water as far as their mouths; a cover is put on with a piece of linen round it to prevent evaporation, the water is then heated to boiling, and is kept at this point until it is considered that the fruit is boiled in their own water or juice; the fire is then withdrawn, and they are suffered to remain in the water for an hour, when it may be drawn off. The method which I in general pursue is to raise the water to the boiling point, and keep it at this heat for about an hour, according to the nature of the fruit; they are then suffered to remain in the water until it is cold. 1 find this way generally successful. When they are taken out, cover the mouths of the bottles with melted rosin or bottle wax. This method is much superior to that of preparing them with water, which renders the fruit flat, dead, and insipid, the whole of the flavour of the fruit being imparted to the water, except when bottled very green, when it does not lose it so much. A method I have tried with pretty good success, is to obtain the fruit before it is ripe, bottle it, and fill the bottles with cold spring water, in which is dissolved Bome oxymuriate of potass, cork them close, and

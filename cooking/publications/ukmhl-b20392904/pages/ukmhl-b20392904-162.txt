APPENDIX. 150 SECTION IV.—CANDY. Cocoa Nut Ice, or Candy.—Grate the inside of a cocoa nut fine; mix about six or eight ounces of the grated nut with a pound of sugar; use water to moisten the sugar in the proportion of a pint to three pounds. Boil to the bare crack ; grain the sugar by rubbing some of it against the side of the pan, and pour it into oiled or buttered tins. Some give it an additional flavour by adding to it a little raspberry jam, or orrice powder, which will also give it some- thing the flavour of raspberry, if a little tartaric acid is used with it. With the jam more particularly it forms a most delicious compound. It should be co- loured with prepared cochineal to give it the red colour of raspberries, otherwise it should be white. Machines are now becoming generally used for preparing the cocoa nut. Candy similar to Bock Sugar,—It is generally termed plum, currant, or almond candy. To three pounds of sugar put one pint of water, boil to the bare crach, take it from the fire and beat it with a spatula in the same manner as whisking eggs; as soon as it begins to froth, or rise, in the pan, pour it into tins previously buttered and covered with split almonds, currants, or stoned raisins, and immediately cover it with the pan turned upside down. It may be coloured in the boiling with cochineal, or saffron. Flavour the white with peppermint, or essence of bitter almonds ; pink, with otto of rose; and yellow, with essence of lemon, or ginger. Best Burnt Almonds—Bed.—For each pound of sifted almonds use two pounds and a half of loaf sugar, made into a syrup. A round bottomed copper pan is the best for making these in. The almonds may be boiled in the sugar until they crack, before

THE CONFECIIONEt?. 36 Equal parts of the cacao of Caraccas, St. Magdalen, and Berbice, mixed together, make a chocolate of first- rate quality; and these proportions give to it that rich and oily taste which it ought to have. That made from the cacao of Caraccas only is too dry, and that from the islands too fat and crude. Roasting.—Take a sufficient quantity ot nuts to cover the bottom of an iron pot two or three inches deep, place them on the fire to roast, stirring them constantly with the spatula that the heat may be im- parted to them equally. A cofFee-roasting machine would answer for this purpose admirably, taking care not to torrefy them too much, as the oil of the nut suffers thereby, and it becomes a dark brown or black, grows bitter, and spoils the colour of the chocolate. Musty or mouldy nuts must be roasted more than the others, so as to deprive them of their bad taste and smell. It is only neceesary to heat them until the skin will separate from the kernel on being pressed between the fingers. Remove them from the fire, and separate the skins. If you have a large quantity, this may be accomplished by putting them in a sieve which has the holes rather large, but not so much as to allow the nuts to pass through; then squeeze or press them in your hands, and the skins will pass through the meshes of the sieve; or, after being separated from the nuts, they may be got rid of by winnowing or fanning them in a similar manner to corn. When they are separated, put them again on the fire, as before directed, stirring them constantly until warmed through, without brown- ing. You may know when they are heated enough by the outside appearing shiny; again winnow, to se- parate any burnt skin which may have escaped the first time. The Making of Chocolate.—An iron pestle and mortar is requisite for this purpose, also a stone of the closest grain and texture which can be procured, and

106 THE CONFECTIONKR, essence or tincture of any vegetable, of superior quality to that generally sold, and at considerably less expense. The essential oil of lemons or oranges is obtained by rubbing off the yellow rind on the rough surface of a piece of loaf sugar, which is much su- perior for flavour to that produced by any other means. Scrape off the sugar after it has imbibed the oil, and dry it in a gentle heat, put it into small glazed pots, and tie them over with bladder; it will keep any length of time unimpaired. The same ob- servation holds good as regards all fruit whose flavour or essential oil resides in its peel. Essence of Lemon,—Eight ounces of lemon peel, ten ounces of rectified spirits of wine. Pare or grate off the yellow rind of the lemon very thin and weigh it, put it into a bottle and pour the spirit on it, stop it close, and let it steep for fourteen days, when it is fit for use. Proof gin or white rum will serve equally well, but not such as is generally sold at the gin-shops; this is excellent for ices, creams, le- monade, &c. In many establishments, where quan- tities of peel are thrown away, the cost of this would be comparatively trifling, compared with the price of the inferior oil generally sold. Essence of Orange.—Make as lemon, using only four ounces of the yellow rind. Essence of Bergamot.—From the peel of the ber- gamot lemon. Essence de Cedrat,—From the yellow part of the fresh citron peel; it may also be obtained by pressing the yellow part of the peel between two glass plates, and by the distillation of the flowers of the citron- tree. Allspice^ Cloves^ Cinnamon^ oi' Nutmegs, 8^c.—Two ounces of spice, one pint of proof spirit. Bruise the spice, put it into a bottle, stop it close, let it remain fourteen days, and filter for use.

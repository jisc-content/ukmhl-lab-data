They can be formed into rings, knots, &c., and either crystallized or candied. Apple or Pippin Paste.—^Take any quantity of good dressing apples, pare, core, and put them into a preserving pan with a little water, or just sufficient to cover them. Boil until they are reduced to a mar- malade, stirring them to prevent burning. To every pound of reduced pulp add half or three-quarters of a pound of loaf sugar, clarified and boiled to the blow; pass the pulp through a hair sieve before you mix the sugar with it; put it on the fire, and let it boil for three or four minutes, keeping it constantly stirred from the bottom, when it will be sufficiently evapo- rated. If it be required coloured, add liquid colour sufficient to give the desired tint when you mix the sugar. Spread the paste on small tin or pewter sheets (these should be about a foot wide, by a foot and a-half long, and perfectly level) with a thin knife, about the eighth of an inch in thickness; put them in the stove for a day; take them out, and cut the paste into long narrow strips, about a quarter of an inch in width; if the paste is dry enough, the strips can be easily pulled off; form them into rings or knots, or cut into diamonds to form leaves, or any other device your fancy may suggest. Put them in boxes with a sheet of paper between each layer. This paste is oc- casionally flavoured with lemon, and is principally used for ornamenting the tops of twelfth cakes. Apple Cheese.—Pare, quarter, and core your apples, as for paste; put them into a jar, and cover the top with the parings; tie paper over the top, and bake them in a moderate oven until they are quite done; take off the parings, and pass the apples dirough a hair sieve into a preserving pan.

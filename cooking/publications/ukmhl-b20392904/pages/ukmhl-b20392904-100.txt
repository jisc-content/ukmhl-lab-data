THK CONFECTIONER. 88 the bottle after being corked, by converting it into carbonic acid gas; but some other unknown agent must be produced, as this may be done without heat, which the fermentation of the fruit would cause by itself; for, according to the experiments of Hilde- brand, had the oxygen of the atmosphere remained unaltered, it would have caused putrefaction ; for he found that oxygen, mixed with a small quantity of azote, promoted putrefaction more than pure oxygen. He found that hydrogen gas was the greatest preser- vative, nitrous next, and after this carbonic. These experiments were tried on meat, but they may be equally applicable in respect to fruit, when the auxiliary produced by heat is not definitely known. Fruit should always be bottled and boiled on the same day it is gathered ; for the longer the fruit lies together the more it sweats ; fermentation com- mences, which is accelerated in the bottles by heat, and there is great danger of their bursting. All decayed or bruised fruit should be carefully excluded, and that should be preferred which is not quite ripe. When finished the bottles should be kept in a cool dry place. SECTION XVII.—OF COOLING DRINKS FOR BALLS AND ROUTS. These may be made either with fresh fruit, jam, or syrups. The last merely requires the addition of water and lemon-juice to make them palatable.

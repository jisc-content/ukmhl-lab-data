Roll it into pipes or cylinders of convenient lengths, and polish by putting them in a box and rolling them together, or by rubbing them with the hand, or a cloth. This is often adul- terated by using glue instead of gum, and by dipping the pipes in a thin solution, which gives them a beau- tiful gloss, when dry. In establishments where this is manufactured on a large scale, the liquorice is dissolved in a large bain-marie, and stirred with spatulas which are worked by a steam-engine. SECTION VIII. PASTILE DROPS. Choose the best treble-refined sugar with a good grain, pound it, and pass it through a coarse hair sieve ; sift again in a lawn sieve to take out the finest part, as the sugar, when it is too fine, makes the drops heavy and compact, and destroys their brilliancy and shining appearance. Put some of the coarse grains of sugar into a small drop pan (these are made with a lip on the right side, so that when it is held in the left hand the drops may be detached from it with the right), moisten it with any aromatic spirit you intend to use, and a sufficient quan- tity of water to make it of a consistence just to drop off the spoon or spatula without sticking to it.

Place the pan on the stove fire, on a ring of the same size. Stir it occasionally until it makes a noise, when it is near boiling, but do not let it boil; then take it from the fire, and stir it well v/ith the spatula until it is of the consistence that when dropped it will not

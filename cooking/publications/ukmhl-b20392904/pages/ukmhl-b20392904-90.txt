THE CONFECTIONER. 78 May Duke cherries; cut a quill as if you were going to make a pen, only, instead of its being sharp, it must be round at the end; hold the cherry in your left hand, and with the other push the quill into it by the side of the stalk, as far as the top of the stone ; then take hold of the stalk, and with the aid of the quill pull the stone out with the stalk, without break- ing the fruit in pieces, which would be the case otherwise. Put sufficient clarified sugar into a pre- serving pan for the cherries to swim; boil it to the blow, and throw in the prepared fruit; let them boil in it for five or ten minutes, keeping them under the syrup by pushing them down with a flat piece of w^ood having a handle at the back. The next day drain off the syrup ; reduce it by boiling ; put in the cherries and boil them again for five minutes; repeat this for four days, giving the cherries a few boils in the syrup each day. If they are required dry, drain the syrup from them, spread them on sieves, and dry in the stove at a good heat, turning them every day. Put only sufficient on the sieves so as just to cover the bottom. Keep them in boxes papered, or in glasses. Whole Cherries.—Shorten the stalks of some fine cherries; put them into an earthen pan, with a layer of powdered sugar and a layer of cherries, covering the top with sugar; let them stand for two or three days; put them on the fire in a preserving pan, and let them boil in the syrup for three or four minutes; repeat this for four days. Keep them in syrup, or dry, when they are wanted, as the preceding; they may also be tied together to form bunches, and preserved in the same manner. Grapes in Bunches,—Get some bunches of fine grapes, before they are perfectly ripe; take out the stones with a large pin or needle; put them in a pre- serving pan, with plenty of «rater and a little salt:

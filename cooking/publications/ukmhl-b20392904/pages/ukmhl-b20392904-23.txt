11 THE CONFECTIONER. aroma of the plant is first taken up, then in succession the colouring, astringent, and gummy parts. Decoctions,â€”These are solutions of the active principles of vegetables, obtained by boiling them in water. " 1st. Those principles only should be decocted whose virtues reside in principles which are soluble in water. " 2nd. If the active principle be volatile, decoction must be an injurious process; and if it consists of ex- tractive matter, long boiling, by favouring its oxidize- ment, will render it insipid, insoluble, and inert. " 3rd. The substances to be decocted should be pre- viously bruised or sliced, so as to expose an extended surface to the action of the water. " 4th. The substances should be completely covered with water, and the vessel slightly closed, in order to prevent as much as possible the access of air; the boiling should be continued without interruption, and gently. " 5th. In compound decoctions, it is sometimes con- venient not to put in all the ingredients from the be- ginning, but in succession, according to their hardness, and the difficulty with which their virtues are extracted ; and if any aromatic or other substances containing volatile principles, or oxidizable matter, enter into the composition, the boiling decoction should be simply poured upon them, and covered up until cold. " 6th. The relative proportions of different vegetable substances to the water must be regulated by their nature. The following general rule may be admitted. Of roots, barks, or dried woods, from two drachms to six to every pint of water: of he^'bs, or flowers, half that quantity will suffice. " 7th. The decoction ought to be filtered through linen while hot, as important portions of the dissolved matter are frequently deposited on cooling; care must also oe taken that the filter is not too fine, for it fre- quently happens that the virtues of a decoction depend

APPENDIX. SECTION II.—SYRUPS. improved Syrup of Almonds. Strop de Orgeat, —One pound of sweet almonds; five ounces of bitter almonds; or, if a stronger flavour of the bitter al- monds is preferred, use eight ounces; picked gum arabic one ounce; water three pounds four ounces; double orange-flower water from four to six ounces ; sugar six pounds. Proceed as directed page 18, with the exception of using a pound and a half of the sugar in pounding the almonds before adding any portion of the water, when sufficient only should be used to make the sugar and almonds into a stiff paste. This paste should then be divided into six or eight parts, and pounded separately until very fine; then add the water gradu- ally to the whole of the paste—reserving sufficient to dissolve the gum—and press through a cloth as be- fore directed, page 18. When the whole of the milk is obtained, add the rest of the sugar and the dis- solved gum, and keep it well stirred occasionally to dissolve the sugar; or it may be dissolved by giving it a boil or two over the fire. Finally, pass the whole again through the cloth, and add the orange- flower water. The addition of the gum helps to pre- vent that separation between the milk of almonds and syrup that takes place after it is bottled, by making the syrup of a greater consistence. Strop de Pistache can also be made in the same manner, observing that only good pistachio kernels 8h^M\ld be us^d.

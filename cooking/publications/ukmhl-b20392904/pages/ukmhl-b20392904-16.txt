4 THE CONFECTIONER. point to which the confectioner has to direct his attention^ for if he is not expert in this particular, all his other labour and knowledge will be useless : it is the founda- tion on which he must build to acquire success in his undertakings. There are seven essential points or degrees in boiling sugar; some authors give thirteen, but many of these are useless, and serve only to show a critical precisiOii in the art, without its being required in practice; however, for exactness, we will admit of nine, viz.:— 1.

A bottle which holds three ounces of water will contain four ounces of syrup. The method of ascertaining those degrees, according to the usages of the trade, is as follows :— Small Thread.—Having placed the clarified syrup on the fire, let it boil a little, then dip the top of your finger in the boiling syrup, and on taking it out apply it to the top of your thumb, when, if it has attained the degree, on separating them a small string will be drawn out a little distance, about as fine as a hair

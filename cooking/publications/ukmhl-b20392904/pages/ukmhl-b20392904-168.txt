APPENDIX. 156 stubble, each of these last being also good non-con- ductors of heat. If in a clay soil, be particular to make a small well in the centre at the bottom to receive the water that drains from the ice, and this should empty itself into a common sewer or rivulet by the side of the well. The drain should be air-tight, with a proper descent, to allow the waste water to run off. An air-tight drain is made by constructing, at some distance from the mouth, a kind of basin, into which the water will flow. From the top of the drain a stone is fixed, to come about half way or rather more to the bottom of the basin, which being always full of water, prevents the air passing through the drain to the ice. The bottom of the well should also be made sloping towards the smaller well or basin in the centre, over which should be placed a grating of iron or wood to prevent the ice falling through, and to facilitate the drainage of the water. If there is no rivulet or sewer for the water to run into, a well should be made on the outside, with a pump to pump it up, or some means of drawing out the water, for if suffered to rise to a level with the ice, it will soon melt. An ice-house eighteen feet from the crown to the trellis, and twelve feet in diameter, will contain one hundred two-horse cart loads or fothers of ice. An ice-house should not be built in a place subject to inundations, as the water will at such times enter the well, in spite of all precautions, and spoil the ice. The ice will melt in a new ice-house when the walls are not perfectly dry, but seldom a second year. Sometimes in a well-closed ice-house a little damp- ness, either at the bottom or sides, will rise in a kind of vapour, which, for want of occasional ventilation, is precipitated again upon the ice, and makes it soft. A simple method of making a small ice-house FOR DOMESTIC PURPOSES is, to obtain two large

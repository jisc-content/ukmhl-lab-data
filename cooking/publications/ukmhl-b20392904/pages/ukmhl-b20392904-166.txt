The qualities that constitute a good ice-house are-— 1st. That it be always perfectly dry, for damp air is more injurious to the ice than warmth. 2nd. To be of a temperature cold enough to pre- vent the ice melting. 3rd. A perfect drainage for the water that runs from the ice, 4th. That the exterior air be completely excluded. To obtain these essential qualities, choose, if possi- ble, a soil of sand, gravel, or chalk ; or if these cannot be obtained, a light dry earth on which to build the house. If on the side of a hill, or rising ground, the better; and with these soils, no other drainage will be required than that produced by the natural absorption of the earth : but if this should prove not sufficient to carry off the water, a drain can then easily be made from the bottom of the well in the hill. The aspect of the house should be towards the east, or south east, that the rays of the morning sun may expel the damp air. The top of the well should be covered, first with an arch of stone well filled with grout, or of brick- work covered with cement: over this a layer of clay and earth, from one to two feet thick, which may be planted with shrubs or small plants, to protect it from the rays of the sun. This will also give it a pictu- resque appearance. Instead of covering the clay with earth, it may be covered with thatch, which is a non-

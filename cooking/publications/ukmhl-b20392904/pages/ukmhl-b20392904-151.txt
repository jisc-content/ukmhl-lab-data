THE CONFECTIONER. 139 sufficient water should be added that some may be - left to prevent the herbs or flowers being burnt to the bottom of the still. After all the water is drawn, the distillation should continue so long as any taste or smell of the ingredients comes over; and the fire should be so regulated that the water may run in a small continued stream. If a superior article is required, it must be re-distilled by a gentle heat, with the addition of a little pure spirit (about one-twentieth part) which has not got any bad smell. Orange-Flower Water.—The leaves of orange flow- ers three pounds, water three pints. Rose Water.—As orange flower, using either the damask or pale single rose. Neither the purgative quality of the damask, nor the astringent quality of red roses, rises in distillation, but is contained in the water left in the still. Cinnamon Water,—Cinnamon one pound, water two gallons. Bruise or break the spice, and infuse it in water for two days. Some consider it sufficient to simmer the spice in the still for half an hour, putting back what comes over, and filtering the whole when cold through a flannel bag or blotting paper. Peppermint Water,—Dried herb one pound and a half, or green herb three pounds, to a gallon of water. Lemon-Peel Water.—Two pounds of fresh peel to the gallon. Black-Cherry Water.—Twelve pounds of ripe fruit to a gallon of water. Bruise the fruit in a mortar so as to break the stones, that the flavour of the kernel may be obtained. Angelica, star anise-seed, carraway, lavender, rose- mary, myrtle, vanilla, raspberry, strawberry, and all other wa' ers, are made in the same manner; the first half o! the water which comes over is the best and strongest.

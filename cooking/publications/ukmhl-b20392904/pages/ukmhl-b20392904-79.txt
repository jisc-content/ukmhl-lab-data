THE CONFECTIONEK. 67 de jujube. This is usually sold for jujube paste, or else picked gum Arabic made into a paste as Senegal, and coloured with prepared cochineal or salFron. Pate de blanche Reglisse—White Liquorice Paste. '—This is made the same as marsh-mallow paste, using liquorice-root instead of mallow. It may be made without the eggs, and finished as jujubes. Pate de Beglisse noir—Black Liquorice Paste.— The best refined liquorice one pound, gum Arabic four pounds, loaf sugar two pounds, Florence orris- root one ounce. Dissolve the gum and liquorice in seven pints of water, keeping it stirred over a slow fire; add the sugar in syrup with the orris-root, evaporate to a paste, and finish as jujubes. Gomme des Jujubes—Jujube Gum.—Jujubes one pound, very white and picked gum Arabic two pounds, powdered sugar two ounces. Pound the jujubes in a marble mortar with five pints of water, put the whole into a pan and boil until reduced to three; strain the decoction through a cloth, beat up the white of an egg with a glass of water, and mix part of it with the decoction as it boils; throw in a little at a time of the remaining part, to check the ebullition. When it is all used, take off the scum, put it again on the fire to evaporate the water, adding at the same time the gum and sugar, powdered and passed through a horse-hair sieve. Stir it with the spatula until dissolved. When it is of the consist- ence of honey, place it in the bain-marie, and neither stir nor touch it, that it may be clear. When it has acquired body enough, so as not to stick to the back of the hand when applied to it, pour it into moulds previously oiled with good olive oil, as for jujubes; place in the stove to finish drying; when dry take it out, and cut it in small pieces. Pate de ^ujube and white liquorice may be done

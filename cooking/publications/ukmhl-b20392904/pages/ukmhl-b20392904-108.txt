THE CONFECTIONER. 96 Seville Orange Ice Cream.—Six oranges, three lemons, one quart of cream, and twelve ounces of sugar or of syrup, to palate; rub off the yellow rind of two or three of the oranges on part of the sugar, scrape it off with a knife, squeeze out the juice of the oranges and lemons, and strain it; mix it with the cream and the sugar on which the rind was rubbed, add the other part of the sugar, dissolve, and freeze. China Orange Ice Cream.—Eight oranges, two lemons, one quart of cream, and twelve ounces of sugar; rub off the rind of four or five of the oranges and one lemon on sugar, squeeze, and strain the juice; add the cream, &c., mix, and freeze. Cherry Ice Cream.—Two pounds of cherries, one quart of cream, and twelve ounces of sugar or syrup; pound the cherries, with the stones, in a mortar, adding a few ripe gooseberries or currants if approved of; pass the pulp through a sieve, add the cream and sugar with the juice of two lemons and a little cochi- neal, mix, and freeze. With preserved fruit it is made the same way, adding a little noyau, or a few bitter almonds pounded for the flavour of the kernel. Lemon Ice Cream.—Six large lemons, one quart of cream, and twelve ounces of sugar or half a pint of syrup; grate off the peels of three of the lemons into a basin, squeeze the juice to it, let it stand for two or three hours, strain, add the cream and syrup, and freeze or mix as Seville orange ice. Mille Fruit Cream Ice.—Make a lemon cream ice, and flavour it with elder flowers, mix in some preserved dried fruits and peels cut in small pieces. Before it is moulded, sprinkle it with prepared cochi- neal, and mix it a little, so as it may appear in veins or marbled. Custard Ices.—These are similarly composed tc

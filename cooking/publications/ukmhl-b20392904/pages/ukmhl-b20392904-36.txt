Let the object you would take the caFt from be placed in a frame made either of wood or stiff paper, embed a part of it in fine sand, soft pipe-clay, or modelling wax, leaving as much of the mould exposed as you wish to form at one time, and oil it with sweet-oil; mix some prepared plaster with water, to the consistency of thick cream, and pour over it; when this is set, proceed with the other portions in the same manner until it is complete. Let them dry and harden for use. Take a sufficient quantity of syrup (clarified with charcoal or animal blavk) to fill the mould, and boil it to the small ball; rub some of it against the side, so as to grain it; when it turns white, pour it into the moulds; take them out when set, ana' put them into the stove, at a moderate heat, to dry. The moulds must be soaked for an hour or two in cold water pre- viously to their being used, which will be found better than oiling them, as it keeps the sugar delicately white, which oil does not. Colour your articles according to nature with liquid colours (see Colours) and cameFs- hair pencils, or the usual pigments sold in boxes may used. If a gloss is required, the colours should be mixed with a strong solution of gum Arabic or isinglass, to the desired tint. Eggs and fruit may be made as light and apparently as perfect as nature, by having moulds to open in two, without any orifice for filling them. Fill one-half with the grained sugar, imme*- diately close the mould, and turn it round briskly thai it may be covered all over equally. To accomplish this, it is necessary to have an assistant, that it may be done as speedily as possible. Burnt Almonds.â€”Take some fine Valencia oi Jordan almonds, and sift all the dust from them; put

THE CONFECTIONER. hot; repeat this for seven or eight days, boiling the syrup the last time to the large pearl. Eringo Root—Choose your roots without knots; wash them clean, and boil in water until they are tender ; peel off the outside skin, slit them, take out the pith, and throw them into cold water; drain, put them into a thin syrup, and give them a few boils; afterwards finish as angelica. Pine Apple whole^ ivet.—Take off the top and stem of the pine; prick the apple with a pointed knife in six or eight places, or more, to the centre; put the pine in a pan with plenty of water, and boil it until tender; take it out and throw it into cold water; when cold, drain it quite dry, and pour over it, boiling hot, some syrup at the small thread. In two days pour off the syrup and boil it to a degree higher, adding more sugar if necessary; repeat this every third day, until the pine is sufficiently impregnated with the sugar; the last time the sugar must be at the large pearl. The top of the pine is greened and preserved as other green fruits, putting it in its proper place when finished. Carefully skim the sugar each time that the pine may be quite clear. Pine Apple Chips or Slices.—Take off the top and stalk, and pare the outside of the pine; cut it into slices half an inch thick; strew over the bottom of a pan with powdered sugar; cover it with slices of pine-apple, then a layer of sugar, and again of pine, and so alternately until the whole is disposed of, covering the top with a layer of sugar; place it in a warm place or stove for three or four days ; then boil it with the juice of two or three lemons for ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, taking off any scum which rises. If the syrup is too thick, add a liltle water; continue this boiling for three or four days, when it will be fit for use. Cherries^ -.yet or d'^-y,—Take the best Kentish or

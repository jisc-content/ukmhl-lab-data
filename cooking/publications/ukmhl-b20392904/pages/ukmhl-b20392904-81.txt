SECTION XIII. FRUITS PRESERVED WITH SUGAR. Wet Fruits.â€”Most of the fruits are first prepared by being blanched, that is, boiled in water; they are then drained and put into boiling syrup, where they remain for a day. The syrup being now weakened with the juice of the fruit, it is poured off, more sugar is added, and it is reduced again to syrup by boiling, and poured hot over the fruit: this is con- tinued until it is fully saturated with sugar, which may be known by the syrup being no longer weakened with the juice of the fruit. Keep them in a dry but not warm place, as too much heat will cause them to ferment, more especially if they are not fully incor- porated with sugar; nor in a damp place, or they will become mouldy. All green fruits require to be greened, so as to bring them to their original colour, for in blanching they assume a yellowish cast: this is probably occasioned by a portion of the alkali being extracted in the boil- ing. The green colour of fruits and leaves depends npon an excess of alkali; and in proportion as acid or alkali prevails in them, so are they coloured from red to violet, blue, and green; therefore if alkali is added to the water, the colour is retained. This is exemplified in the everyday domestic duties of the cook, who uses soda, potash, or muriate of soda (common salt), in boiling her greens or cabbages. 1 have here stated the principle on which their colour depends, to show that there is no necessity for green fruits being kept for some time in brass or copper

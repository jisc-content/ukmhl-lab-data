166 THE CONFECTIONEIl. ::onductor of heat; but this should be on a frame of woodwork, about a foot distant from the clay, or a warmth may be communicated to the well and injure the ice. To enter the ice-house a passage should be made towards the north, with two doors—an interior and exterior—with sufficient space between to admit a person to enter and close the outer door before open- ing the inner one, to allow the admission of as little air as possible while taking out the ice. In this passage all kinds of provisions may be kept, espe- cially in the summer, to preserve them. The doors of the passage should be made of well-seasoned wood, so as not to shrink, and they should be well fitted. The usual form of ice wells is that of a sugar loaf reversed, being smaller at the bottom than the top. The depth is not so much an object as perfect drain- age. It may be made of any width. A large ice- house is better than a small one, for the larger the body of ice there is together, the better it will keep. By digging an ice-house too deep, it is more liable to be exposed to a dampness that causes the ice to melt. The side of the well is usually lined with brick or stone. If economy is an object, wood may be substi- tuted ; or if the well is formed in dry gravelly soil, no lining will be required to keep the ice from the sides, but the straw usually placed round for that purpose. When the soil is naturally damp or wet, greater precautions must be taken, and more expense incurred, in constructing the well, to preserve the ice perfectly. In this case the principal object to be observed is, to separate or isolate the well and ice from the surround- ing earth. This may be done by constructing the well with double walls (for economy the inner one may be of wood), and filling between them with chalk or well- beaten clay, or some dry material, as gravel, chaff, or

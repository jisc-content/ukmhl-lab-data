159 THE CONFECTIONER. Snow will also keep better if a little water is thrown over it now and then. When the well is full, cover the top of the snow thickly with straw. For freezing ices any kind of salt will do; but that which takes the greatest quantity of water to dissolve it, produces the most intense cold. Bay salt is by many preferred to the fine, for this purpose. Nesselrode Pudding, or Ice a la Naraskin.—^ This is a similar preparation to the ice pudding de- scribed at page 97 ; but instead of being made with only custard, and fruit cut in dice, chesnuts or almonds are also added.—Take off the husks and inside skin of three dozen chesnuts; boil them in a thin syrup until tender; then pound them fine in a fine mortar, with a little of the syrup they were boiled in. Stone and cut in half four ounces of fine raisins, and put them, and two or three ounces of cleaned currants, into the syrup the chesnuts were boiled in, to swell. Make a custard with a pint of cream, half a pint of milk, five or six yolks of eggs, sufficient sugar to sweeten, and the pounded chesnuts. Flavour with vanilla; some also add a glass of maraschino. When cold, freeze; then drain the syrup from the raisins and currants, and add them, together with two or three preserved apricots and greengages, and about two ounces of citron peel cut in dice, to the frozen custard. When well frozen, put it into a pud- ding mould, and set in fresh ice and salt. M. Careme recommends that a plate full of whipped cream and the whites of three eggs, made into a meringue, should be added, when the pudding is well frozen. Instead of the chesnuts, some use from four to six ounces of blanched sweet almonds; but ^vith these it cannot be called a Nesselrode pudding, not being used for the puddings made for Count Nessel- rode, and approved of by him. Similar puddings maybe made ad infinitum^ accord-

THE COiNPBCTIONBR. 67 cut some pieces of paper to the size of the top, steep in brandy, and put over each; then wet some pieces of bladder, put one over the top of each pot or glass, and tie it down. tVhite and Black Currant Jelly.—These are made m the same way, using part red currants with the black ones. Violet-coloured Currant /eZ/y. —This is made as red currant jelly, mixing two pounds of black currants with ten of red. Cherry Jelly.—Pick ofF the stalks and take out the stones of some fine ripe Kentish cherries, and to every four pounds of cherries add one pound of red currants ; proceed as for currant jelly. Barberry Jelly.—Take some very ripe barberries, pick them from their stalks, and weigh them. To every pound of fruit take three-quarters of a pound of loaf sugar, add sufficient water to make it into a syrup, put in the barberries, and boil them until the syrup comes to the pearl, taking off any scum which may rise. Then throw them into a fine hair or lawn sieve, and press the berries with a spoon to extract as much juice as possible from them. Receive the syrup and juice in a pan, put it again on the fire, and finish as apple jelly. Any of these jellies may be made without fire on the same principle as clear cakes. Get the fruit ripe and fresh gathered, obtain the juice by expression, and filter it through a flannel bag; add an equal weight of sugar to that of filtered juice, stir well together until the sugar is dissolved, and place it in a warm place or the sun for a few days, when it will be a fine jelly. Those made in this manner retain the natural flavour of the fruit. Raspberry Jelly.—Take three pottles of ripe rasp- berries and one of ripe currants, press out the juice and filter it; to a pint of juice add one pound of loaf sugar, Rnd finish as other jellies.

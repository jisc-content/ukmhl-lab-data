THE CONrKCTIONER. 91 shelves or divisions; this is for keeping the ices in the form of fruits, after they are finished, until re- quired for the table. To freeze Ices.â€”This is accomplished through the medium of ice. Of itself, it does not contain a sufficient frigorific power to congeal a liquid body to the required consistence without an auxiliary; the >]sual one employed is that of salt. As a general rule, take about two pounds to every six pounds of ice, which I think will be nearly the quantity required. I cannot state precisely, as it is the custom to mix it by guess ; but note, the freezing property depends on the quantity of salt which is used, consequently, the more there is mixed with the ice the quicker are the creams, &c., frozen. Pound a sufficient quantity of ice small, and let some salt be well mixed with it; place the pot con- taining the mixture in a pail, which you fill (the latter) with pounded ice and salt as far as the lid; strew a handful of salt on the top of the ice, let it remain a few minutes until you have similarly dis- posed of others, as three or four may be done at a time if required, then whirl them round briskly by means of the handles for five minutes, take off the lids one at a time, and with the spatula stir or carry the un- frozen part well round the sides, turning the pot also with the left hand; continue this for two or three minutes, which serves to soften what has already frozen, as well as helps to freeze the remaining portion; then scrape it from the sides, put on the lids, whirl round again briskly as before directed, repeating the same operations evp.ry four or five minutes. As it forms into a consistence, do not spare your labour in well working or mixing it together when you scrape it down, so as to make it perfectly smooth and free from lumps, for the smoothness of your ice depends on this operation; continue to

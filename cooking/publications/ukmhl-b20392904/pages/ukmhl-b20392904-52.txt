THE CONFECTIONER. 40 SECTION VII.—LOZENGES. These are composed of loaf-sngar in fine powder, and other substances, either liquid or in powder, which are mixed together and made into a paste with dissolved gum, rolled out into thin sheets, and formed with tin cutters into little cakes, either oval, square, or round, and dried. One ounce of gum tragacanth, and half pint of water. Let it soak in a warm place twenty-four hours : put it in a coarse towel or cloth, and let two persons continue twisting it until the whole of the gum is squeezed through the interstices of the cloth. One ounce of this dissolved gum is sufficient for four or five pounds of sugar; one ounce of dissolved gum Arabic to twelve ounces of sugar. Either of these gums may be used separately, or in the proportion of one ounce of gum dragon to three ounces of Arabic mixed together. These are generally used for medicated lozenges; but gum Arabic alone is considered to make the best peppermint. Peppermint Lozenges^ No. 1.—Take double-re- fined loaf'sugar, pound and sift it through a lawn sieve; make a ba y with the sugar on a marble slab, into which pour some dissolved gum, and mix it into a paste as you would dough, flavouring the mass with oil of peppermint. That made at Mitcham, in Surrey, is the best. One ounce of this is sufficient for forty pounds of lozenges. Some persons prefer mixing their gum and sugar together at first in a mortar; but as it is indifferent which way is pursued, that may be fol- lowed which is most convenient. Roll out the paste on a marble slab until it is about the eighth of an inch in thickness, using starch powder to dust it with, to prevent its sticking to the slab and pin. Before cutting

148 THE CONFECTIONER, Strong shifting shelves made either of small bars of round iron or wood, like a grating, on which candy pots or sieves may be placed ; the grooves for these should be so constructed as to be capable of inclina- tion so as to drain off the syrup from the candy pots without taking them from the shelves; the door should be made to shut close, with a small door at the top to let out any excess of heat. I have before re- marked that it may be heated by means of many of the modem stoves. At places where the oven is heated with wood, furze, &c., a common iron pot or crock with three legs is filled with the live embers, or it may be filled with burning charcoal and covered with wood ashes, which is replenished night and laiorning, and gives tlie heat required.

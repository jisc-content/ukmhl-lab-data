Cream Ices.—These are composed of cream, or three-fourths cream and one-fourth milk, with the juice or pulp of fruit either fresh or preserved, and syrup or sugar so blended together as the taste of one may not predominate over that of another; but if either is in excess it should be-that of the fruit. Raspberry of fresh Fruit—One quart of rasp- berries, one quart of cream, three-quarters of a pound or a pound of sugar, a few ripe currants and goose- berries, or currants and ripe cherries may be added, instead of all raspberries, which is much approved by some, and the juice of two lemons; * mash the fruit, and pass it through a sieve to take out the skins and seeds; mix it with the other articles; add a little pre- pared cochineal to heighten the colour ; put it in the pot and freeze. Note.—All ices made with red fruit require this addition of cochineal. Raspberry, from Jam,—One pound of jam, one quart of cream, about six ounces of sugar or syrup, to palate, and the juice of two lemons. Mix as before. Strawberry.—As raspberry. Currant Ice from fresh Fruit.—One pint and a half of ripe currants, half a pint of raspberries, one quart of cream, the juice of two lemons, and twelve ounces of sugar. Mix as raspberry. Currant Ice.—Preserved Fruit.—The same pro- portions as raspberry, using either jam or jelly. * The quantity of fruit required for these ices will depend in a great measure on the quality of the fruit and the seasons in which it is produced; a pint and a half will be found suffi- cient when it is good in fine seasons; the quantity stated iu each receipt \g the greatest required.

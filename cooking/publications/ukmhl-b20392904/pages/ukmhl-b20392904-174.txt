"To nearly all classes of tourists a good map is, or should be, one of the first considerations, and for this map to be of real service it must be of a size to be carried conveniently in the pocket, and must give the coach roads alid railroads clearly marked. Messrs. Houlston's Handy Maps, which are reduced from the Ordnance Survey Maps, combine these necessaries with the advantages of accuracy, clear- ness, and cheapness. As far as we have tested theiil we have found them admirable, and such as to warrant our recommendation of them to those about to seek renewed health and strength in their annual vacation in any of the districts of which Messrs. Houlston publish maps."—The Coiintry, HOULSTON'S INDUSTRIAL LIBRARY. Recently revised volumes^ cloth gi't. 1. Baker, \s. 2. Banker's Clerk, 2J. 4. Butler, IS. 6. Chemist and Drug- gist. \s. 7.

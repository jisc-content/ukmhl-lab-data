Boil some fresh syrup to the blow; put in the fruit, and give it a boil in it. The fruit when it is put in will reduce the sugar, it must therefore be boiled to the same degree again. With a spoon or spatula rub the sugar against the side of the pan, to grain it; when it begins to whiten put the fruit in the white part sepa- rately ; with two forks take it out and lay it on sieves or wire frames, for the sugar to drain from it.

Too much heat will blacken the fruit, therefore let the heat of the stove be about 100° or 110° of Fahrenheit's thermometer. SECTION XIV.—COMPOTES.

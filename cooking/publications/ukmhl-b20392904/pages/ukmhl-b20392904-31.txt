Crystallized or Candied Sugar.â€”Provide a round mould, smaller at the bottom than the top, of any size you may think proper, made either of tin or copper, with holes pierced round the sides about three inches asun- der, so as to fasten strings across in regular rows from the top to the bottom, leaving sufficient room for the sugar to crystallize on each string without touching, or it will form a complete mass; paste paper round the outside to prevent the syrup from running through the holes. Have the mould prepared, and let it be clean and dry ; take sufficient clarified syrup to fill the mould, and boil it to the degree of crystallization or the feather, and add a little spirit of wine ; remove it from the fire, and let it rest until a thin skin is formed on the sur- face, which you must carefully remove with a skimmer; then pour it into the mould, and place it in the stove, where you let it remain undisturbed for eight or nine days, at 90 degreees of heat, or half that time at 100; then make a hole, and drain off the superfluous sugar into a pan placed below to receive it; let it drain quite dry, which will take about twelve hours ; then wash off the paper from the mould with boiling

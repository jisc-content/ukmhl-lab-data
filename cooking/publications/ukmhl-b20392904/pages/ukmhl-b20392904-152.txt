140 THE CONFECTIONER. SPIRITS FOR LIQUEURS. Spirits and alcohol are obtained by the distilla- tion of fermented articles. The peculiar taste of each depends on the essential oil of the article from which it is prepared being held in solution: therefore, by knowing the nature of its oil, alcohol may be made to imitate any desired spirit. A few drops of nitric ether added to malt spirit will impart to it the flavour of cognac brandy; and two scruples of ben- zoic acid, mixed with one quart of rum, will give it the taste of arrack. Brandy is generally recommended for the use of the confectioner in making spirits for liqueurs, but a superior article may be made with less expense from rectified spirits of wine, or pure spirit which has neither taste nor smell, as the spirit afterwards drawn will only have the flavour of the articles with which it is required to be impregnated. Rectified spirits may be obtained from the dregs of beer, cider, ale or wine, suitable for any purpose, as well as from brandy. Spirits rise in the still with less heat than watery in- fusions, therefore it is best to distil by means of the bain- marie, that is, by the still being placed in another vessel containing water. This method is more safe, as it prevents accidents, and the articles from being burnt. Common spirits may be deprived of their impurities by mixing them with an equal quantity of water, and dis- tilling them by a gentle heat, or in a water bath. Continue the operation until the phlegm arises, which will appear milky and is of a nauseous taste. A great quantity of the oil which it retained will remain in the water. If the spirit was very impure, a second rectification may be necessary, as before. A very pure and tasteless spirit may be obtained by mixing with the spirit, after rectifi- cation, one-fourth of its weight of pure dry salt of wormwood or tartar.

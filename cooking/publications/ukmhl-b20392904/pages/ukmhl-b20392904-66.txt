THB CONFECTIONER 54 comfits. Any other preserved fruits may be made into comfits after the same manner. Comfits flavmired with Liqueurs*—Blanch some bitter almonds, or the kernels of apricots or peaches; let them soak in hot water for an hour, then drain them, and put them into any sort of liqueur or spirit you may desire. Lower the strength of the spirit with water, that the kernels may imbibe it the better, cork the jug or bottle close, and let them infuse in it until the spirit has fully penetrated them, which will be aboQt fourteen or fifteen days ; then take them out, drain and dry them in a moderate heat; when dry, proceed as for almond comfits. Orans^e Comfits.—Take some preserved orange-peel, and cut it into small thin strips; dry them in the stove, and make as cinnamon comfits. Lemon Peel or Angelica may be made into comfits after the same manner. Let the strips of peel be about the size of the pieces of cinnamon, and thoroughly dried before working them in the pan. Nonpareils.—Pound some loaf sugar, and sift it through a fine wire sieve ; sift what has passed through again in a lawn sieve, to take out the finest particles, so that you have only the fine grain of sugar left with- out dust. Put about two pounds of this into the com- fit-pan, and proceed as for Scotch caraways, working them well with the hand until they are about the size of pins' heads. To colour Nonpareils or Comfits.—Put some of your comfits or nonpareils into the comfit-pan, shake or rub them about until warm, then add a sufficient quantity of prepared liquid colour (see Colours) to give the desired tint; be careful not to make them too wet, nor of too dark a colour, but rather light than otherwise; shake or rub them well about, that they may be coloured equally; dry them a little over the fire, then put them in sieves, and finish drying them

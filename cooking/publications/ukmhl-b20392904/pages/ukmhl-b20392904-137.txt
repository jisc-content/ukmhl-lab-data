THE CONFECTIONER. 125 many of them are prepared in the same manner as for dyeing. One of the principal colours requisite for the confectioner's use is coccinella, or cochineal. The sorts generally sold are the black, silver, foxy, and the granille. The insect is of two species, the fine and the wild cochineal; the fine differs from the wild in size, and is also covered with a white mealy powder. The best is of a deep mulberry colour, with a white powder between the wrinkles, and a bright red within. A great deal of adulteration is practised with this article, both at home and abroad; it is oi? this account that persons prefer the silver grain* because it cannot be so well sophisticated. Good cochineal should be heavy, dry, and more or less of a silvery colour, and without smell. To prepare CochineaL—Pound an ounce of cochi- neal quite fine, and put it into a pint of river water with a little potash or soda, and let it boil; then add about a quarter of an ounce of powdered alum, the same of cream of tartar, and boil it for ten minutes; if it is required for keeping, add two or three ounces of powdered loaf sugar. Carmine.—Reduce one ounce of cochineal to a fine powder, add to it six quarts of clear rain or filtered water, or prepared water, as for cochineal. Put this into a large tin saucepan, or a copper one tinned, and let it boil for three minutes, then add twenty-five grains of alum, and let it boil two minutes longer; take it off the fire to cool; when it is blood warm pour off the clear liquor into shallow vessels, and put them by to settle for two days, covering them with paper to keep out the dust. In case the carmine has not separated properly, add a few drops of a solution of tin, which is tin dissolved in muriatic acid or a solution of green vitriol, or the following may be sub- stituted :—one ounce and a half of spirit of nitre, three scruples of sal ammoniac, three scruples of tin dis-

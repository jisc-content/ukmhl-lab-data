152 APPENDIX. It on the stone, and work in, as directed in page 28, two ounces and a half of finely powdered tartaric acid. Instead of making it into drops by hand, as described page 28, they are now done by means of a machine, called a " drop machine." The rollers are either slightly oiled before a thin sheet of the sugar is passed through them, or the sheet of sugar itself is dusted with finely powdered sugar. In large esta- "-blishments all kinds of drops, balls, and, in some, sticks also, are made by machines. Raspberry Drops are made as acid drops, with the addition of orrice powder, and the sugar is co- loured red in the boiling with prepared cochineal. Raspberry Rock^ or Sticks,—In this preparation orrice powder, with a little tartaric acid, is frequently used as a substitute for raspberry paste, being used in the same manner; see page 29. SECTION VII*—LOZENGES. The principal thing to be observed in the making of these^ is to have the dissolved gum of sufficient strength or consistence to hold a sufficient body of sugar without losing its adhesive or gummy nature. Without this the paste becomes, as it were, rotten, being short, not easily rolled out without the surface being full of cracks, nor can that fine smooth face'* be given to the lozenges that good ones always possess. One pound of gum arable should be dissolved in about a pint of water, not more. This should be used for making all kinds of peppermint, rose, ginger, or other lozenges not strictly termed " medical lozenges," as it gives them a clearer and better appearance. The following proportions may be used for all lozenges:—Two pounds and a half of gum Arabic dissolved in a quart of water, and one ounce of guir tragacanth in half a pint of water.

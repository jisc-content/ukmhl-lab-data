THE CONKSCIIONER. 121 Assiettes MonteeSy or dressed plates.—These are 'composed of pieces of wire of different sizes to suit the dimensions of the piece, which is bound round with silver or tissue paper, and fastened with paste. These wires, after they are fashioned to the desired figure, are fixed w^ith binding wire, and the whole is finished with stout Bristol-board or card paper, ornamented gold borders and papers, and decorated with gum paste. They are placed in the centre of the table, with bon-bons, &c. On Modelling,—This art is most important to the confectioner. It is not so difficult to accomplish as is generally supposed; it only requires patience and per- severance, with a close attention to the proportions and orders of nature. A few modelling tools, and facility in handling the paste, is all that is requisite to become an expert modeller. The form of the body must first be made with the fingers, the more minute parts with the tools and a pair of scissors; the last is very useful for dividing the fingers on the hands and the toes of a human figure. The proportions necessary to form it are these :—the whole length of a human being is six times the length of his foot, eight times of his head (that is, from the crown to the chin), ten times of his face, or the distance from the crown to the mouth; the thumb is as long as the nose or the biggest joint of the middle finger; the fore finger is shorter than the third, and the little finger is shorter than the third by one joint; the width of the wrist is as long as the thumb, and about a quarter; this varies; the ear is also the length of the nose, its breadth half its length; the arm is three times the length of the head, or four faces; the leg, from the knee-joint to the bottom of the foot, measures two heads and a-half; the foot, which is one-sixth of the human stature, if divided into three parts, will contain first the toes from the top of the large one to the lowest joint of the little one; next

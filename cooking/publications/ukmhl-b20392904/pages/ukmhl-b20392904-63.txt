THE CONFECTIONER. 51 fugar In syrup, boiled to the small thread; add two or three table-spoonfuls of dissolved gum Arabic with it to give them a gloss. Give three or four charges with a very gentle heat, the syrup being cold and the pan scarcely warm. Work and dry each charge well be- fore another is added : when finished, dry them in a moderate heat. It is the best way, if possible, to dry comfits in the sun, as it bleaches them. If the stove is at a greater heat than the sun in a moderately warm day, which is from 70 to 80 degree of Fahrenheit, it will spoil their whiteness. Bath Caraways.—These are made in the same way, but only half the size. Gingerbread Caraways.—Sift the seeds, and warm them in the pan, as for Scotch caraways. Have some gum-Arabic dissolved, throw in a ladleful, and rub them well about the pan with the hand until dry, dusting them with flour. Give them three or four coatings in this manner, and then a charge of sugar, until they are about one-half the required size. Dry them for a day, give them two or three coatings of gum and flour, finish them by giving three or four charges of sugar, and dry them. These are made about the size of Bath caraways. Colour parts of them different colours, leaving the greatest portion white. Cinnamon Comfits.—Cinnamon is the bark of a tree, of which there are two sorts. The inferior quality is that usually sold for cinnamon, and is otherwise known as cassia, or cassia lignea. This breaks short, and has a slimy mucilaginous tacte, is thicker, and of a darker colour than the cinnamon, which is the inner bark. This breaks shivery, and has a warm aromatic taste, and is of a reddish colour. Take one pound of cinnamon bark, and steep it in water for a few hours to soften it; cut it into small pieces about half an inch long, and the size of a large needle. Dry it in the stove. Put your pieces, when dry, into

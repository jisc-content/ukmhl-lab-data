THE CONFECTIONER, 92 freeze until the whole is well set. Ice, when well frozen, should be about the consistence of butter, tough to the feel, of a good colour, and without any lumps in it. Those which contain too much syrup cannot be frozen to the degree required, and those which have too little freeze hard, and feel short and crisp, like compressed or frozen snow, which arises from ha/ing too many watery particles in it, by the excess of either water or milk, according to the nature of your ice. In eitner case, it may be ascertained when you commence freezing, by the first coat which is formed round the sides. It should then be altered by either adding more cream or water, with juice or Dulp of fruit, or other flavouring matter, in proportion, as the case may be, if too rich, and vice versa, by the addition of more syrup, &c., when poor ; but at all times the necessity of altering them should be avoided, as the component parts cannot be so per- fectly blended together without considerable extra labour, as if they were properly mixed at the com- mencement. During the time of freezing, or after the creams, &c., are moulded and set up, if there is too much water in the pail, the frigorific power is lessened; a little increases it, as at first it is only a solution of the salt; but as the ice dissolves and mixes with it, it decreases; therefore, when it comes to the top, draii? the water off, and fill up with fresh salt and ice. When the ices are properly frozen, take out the pots, drain off the water, empty the pail, again re- place them and fill with fresh salt and ice as before ; then spread the creams over the sides of the pot, when they are ready for use, if they are intended to be served in a shop, or by glassfuls. Should it be re- quired for moulds, line the bottom with a piece of paper before you put it on; if there is no impression sr figure on the top, you may cover that also with

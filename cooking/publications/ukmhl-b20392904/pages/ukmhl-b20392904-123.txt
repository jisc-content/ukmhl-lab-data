A pan of icing, when well beat and finished, should contain as much again in bulk as it was at the commencement: use sufficient lemon-juice to give the icing a slight acid, or it will scale off the cake in large pieces when it is cut. Many prefer the pyroligneous acid to lemon- juice, but the flavour is not so delicate, and it always retains a smell of the acid; neither did I ever find, as some assert, that it improves the quality and ap- pearance of the icing; the only advantage derived from it is that of economy. On piping Cakes, Bon-bons, ^c,â€”This is a method of ornamenting wedding, twelfth-cakes, and other articles with icing, by means of small pipes or tubes ; these are most generally made with writing- paper folded in the form of a cone, in the same manner as a grocer makes up his papers for small lots of sugar, tea, &c. The tube is filled with icing, made as for cakes, the base of the cone, or the place where it was filled, is turned down to prevent the sides opening, and the escape of the icing; the point is then cut off with a sharp knife or scissors, so as to make a hole sufficiently large to form the icing, when squeezed or pressed out, in a thread of the re- quired size, and which will either be fine or coarse according to the length of the point which is cut off. If the hole at the point of the cone is not perfectly straight when the icing is pressed out, it will form a spiral thread, which is very inconvenient to work with.

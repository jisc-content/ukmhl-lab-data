THE CONFECTIONER* 87 cover the mouths with rosin. Plums done in this way had the natural bloom on them. I found these were better than those done in a similar manner by heat. A few bottles of them fermented. After the fermentation was over I corked them close, and in six months I opened some, when they had a smell like wine, and were not so flat as those which were w^ell preserved by heat, and filled with water; these certainly look well to the eye, but they are only fit to be used for large pies, when the water should be made into a syrup with sugar, and put in with it. The first method, which is the same as Appert's, or nearly so, is decidedly the best; it retains the natural flavour, and may be used for any purpose it is required, it being as good as fresh fruit. The pulp or juice of fruits may also be preserved in the same way; if the fruit is not ripe enough to pulp, put it into a jar and stop it close, place it in a kettle of cold water, heat it until it boils, and let it continue at this point for ten minutes or a quarter of an hour; take it out and pass the pulp through a hair-sieve; bottle and finish as before. This method of M. Appert's is not altogether original, but was anticipated by the experiments of Mr. Boyle. A system somewhat on the same prin- ciple has been practised by many in the trade for years, which is this. The fruit is bottled and care- fully corked, the bottles are then placed on the top of the oven, where they are sufi*ered to remain for twenty Dur or forty-eight hours, according to the temperature, which is generally from 120^ to 140"^ Fahrenheit's thermometer. At one place, I ascertained the heat during the process, and it averaged 130Â°. Another system practised is that of heating the bottles in a cool oven. The principle endeavoured to be accomplished is to destroy the small portion of oxygen contained in

THE CONFECTIONER. 18 Slice the root if fresh, or bruise it if dried ; pour the water on it boiling, and let it macerate in a warm place for a day, then strain, and boil to the pearl. Syrup of Almonds—Sir op de Orgeat.—One pound of sweet almonds, four ounces of bitter ones, one pint and a half of water, sugar three pounds, orange-flower water two ounces. Blanch the almonds, and as they are blanched throw them into cold water; when they are finished, take them out and pound them in a marble mortar, sprinkling them with a little orange-flower water to prevent their oiling, or use water with the juice of a lemon: add sufficient in the pounding to reduce them to a paste, and when quite fine add half a pint more water; mix, and strain through a tamis cloth, twisted tight by two persons : receive the milk which comes from the al- monds into a basin ; what is left in the cloth must be pounded again with some of the water, and strained. Continue this until the whole of the milk is obtained, and the water is consumed; then clarify, and boil the sugar to the crack; add the milk of almonds, and re- duce it to the pearl; then strain it again, add the orange-flower water, and stir it well until nearly cold; when cold, bottle ; shake the bottles well for several succeeding days, if you see it at all inclined to separate, which will prevent it. Sirop de Pisiache is made in the same manner, colouring it green with a little spinach. Syrup of Coffee,—Fresh roasted Mocha cofFee two pounds, water one quart, sugar three pounds eight ounces. Grind the cofFee in a mill, and make a cold infusion with the water in a close vessel; let it stand for a day, then filter it through blotting-paper ; add the sugar, and finish in the bain-marie. Syrup of Rum Punch.—Jamaica rum one quart, the juice of twelve or fourteen lemons, sugar four pounds. Rub off the yellow rind of half of the lemons

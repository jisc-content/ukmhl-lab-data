THK CONFECTIONFR. 64 Raspberry Cakes.—Toke ripe raspberries, press the juice from half of them, and put the pulp back with the others; reduce them on the fire. To each pound of pulp add two pounds of loaf sugar in powder ; put it again on the fire, stirring it constantly until the sugar is melted. Have a tin ring, with a handle by the side, about the size of an old penny piece, and twice the thickness; wet the ring, and place it on your small pewter or tin plates, fill it with the paste, smoothing over the top with a knife; then remove the ring, and the cake will remain. Lay them off in rows, and make three or four marks on the top with the handle of a table spoon; put them in the stove to dry, turn them with a thin knife, and put them again into the stove to dry perfectly. Place them in boxes, with paper between each layer. The residue from the making of raspberry vinegar may be employed for this purpose, or they may be made by adding a pound of fine powdered sugar to a pound of jam. Any of the fruit pastes may be formed into cakes like these, or into drops, by forcing them out on paper with a small tin pipe and bladder attached to it. Clear Cakes^ or Jelly Cakes.—Take the filtered juice of fruits, as for jelly (see Jellies); to each pint of juice add one pound of loaf sugar, dissolve it ; in the juice thoroughly, place it on the fire and heat it, but it must not boil; put it into small pots, moulds, or glasses, so as to form cakes about half an inch thick; place them in the stove, which must not be ^ too hot, or they will melt instead of forming a jelly; about seventy-five or eighty degrees Fahrenheit is quite hot enough. When a crust has formed on the top, take out the cakes by carefully turning the knife round the sides of the pot, place them on small plates of tin or pewter, and dry on the other side When

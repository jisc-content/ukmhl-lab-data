These are certainly some of the most delicate and beautiful of this class which were ever invented, fit even to gratify the palate of the most fastidious. The fruit from which they are made should be gathered as fresh as it possibly can, except apples, as the mucilage is injured by keeping, and if the fruit has fermented it is entirely destroyed. Pastes formed with Gum—Pate de Guimaiwe— Marsh-Mallow Paste.—Gum Arabic three pounds, roots of fresh marsh-mallows eight ounces, one dozen of rennet apples, loaf sugar three pounds. Peel, core, and cut the apples in pieces. Cleanse the roots, and slice them lengthways in an oblique direction ; add this to seven pints of water; soft or river water is the best when filtered ; put it on the fire and boil for a quarter of an hour, or until re- duced to six pints; pound and sift the gum through a hair sieve; strain the decoction into a pan with the gum ; put it on a moderate fire, or into a bain-marie, stirring it until the gum is perfectly dissolved ; then strain it through a coarse towel or tamis cloth, the ends being twisted by two persons ; add it to the sugar, which has been previously clarified and boiled to the feather; dry it well over the fire, keeping it constantly stirred from the bottom. When it has acquired a thick consistence, take the whites of eighteen eggs, and whip them to a strong froth; add them to the paste, and dry until it does not stick to the hand when it is applied to it; add a little essence of neroli, or a large glassful of double orange-flower water, and evaporate again to the same consistence. Pour it on a marble slab well dusted with starch- powder, flatten it with the hand; the next day cut it into strips, powder each strip, and put them in boxes. Powder the bottom that they may not stick. Pdie de Goinme A-ahique—Arabic Past'i,-' Very

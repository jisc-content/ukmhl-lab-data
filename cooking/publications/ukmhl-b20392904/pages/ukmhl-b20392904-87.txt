THE CONFECTIONER. 75 pan of cold water, put them on the fire and let them boil gently until a strong straw or the head of a puj will penetrate the rind; throw them into cold water; when cold, drain them dry, and put them into a thin syrup when boiling; give them five or six boils in it, and put them in an earthen pan; the next day drain the syrup from them, and add more sugar or syrup to increase it a degree ; boil it, and when it boils, pour it over the lemons; repeat this for two days ; on the third day let the lemons boil in the syrup for four or five minutes ; the next day boil the syrup and pour it over them; when you find the syrup has penetrated the lemons, and they look clear, drain the syrup from them, adding more, if necessary, so as to have suffi- cient to keep them well covered; put them in glasses and pour the syrup over them. When cold, cut a piece of bladder to the size of the glass, wet it, and tie it down. Oranges whole, wet.—These are preserved the same as lemons. Whole Orange Peels.—Choose your oranges of a fine clear skin; make a hole at the stalk end, large enough to admit the end of a spoon, with which you take out the pulp; throw them in salt and water, and let them remain for three or four days or a week; drain them from this, and put them into a pan of fresh water, and let them boil until the end of a straw may be pushed through the peel; throw them into cold water; with the end of a spoon clear out any part of the pulp which may have adhered to them ; drain off the water; put them in a tub or p^m, and pour boiling syrup over them; let them remain in this for three or four days; take them from the syrup and boil it again, adding more as the peels imbibe it, so as to keep them well covered; boil the syrup once every four or five days, and pour it hot over them; do this until it has fully penetrated them.

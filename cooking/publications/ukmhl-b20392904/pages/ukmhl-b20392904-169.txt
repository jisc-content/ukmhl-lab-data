157 THE CONFECTIONER. 2asks, but one must be smaller than the other to place inside the larger one. The space between the two casks should be well filled with finely pow- dered charcoal, which is a non-conductor of heat, and holes should be made in the bottom to admit any water that drains from the ice to run off". These casks may be sunk in the ground in a cool cellar, taking care that means be adopted to allow the water to drain ofi" freely. A cover should be made to fit these casks, over which may be placed some charcoal or other non-conductor, and be made to fit closely, to prevent any access of air. Sufficient ice may be pre- served in this manner for the use of a small family, at little expense. An excellent and simple method of preserving ice, and making ice wells, is one practised in Italy. " Ice may be preserved in a dry place under ground by covering it well with chaff, straw, or reeds. Great use is made of chaff in some places of Italy to pre- serve ice: the ice-house need only be a deep hole dug in the ground on the side of a hill, from the bottom of which they can easily carry out a drain to let out the water separated any time from the ice, that it may not melt and spoil the rest. If the ground is tole- rably dry, they do not line the sides with anything, but leave them naked, and only make a covering of thatch over the top ot the hole. This pit they either fill with pure snow, or else with ice taken from the purest and clearest water, because they do not use it as we do in England to set the bottles in, but really mix it with the wine. They first cover the bottom of the hole with chaff, and then lay in the ice, not letting it anywhere touch the sides, but ramming in a large bed of chaff all the way between; they thus carry the filling to the top, and then cover the filling with chaff. Ice packed in this manner will keep as long as they please. When they take any of it out for use,

Proceed in this way until they are one-third the required size, then dry them for a day, and proceed and finish as for caraway comfits. For the cheaper or more common comfits, more gum and flour are used in making them. Cardamom Comfits,—The seeds should be kept in their husks until they are required to be used, as they lose much of their flavour and virtues when deprived of them. They are often mixed with grains of para- dise, but these have not the aromatic taste of the car- damom, and are more hot and spicy. Break the husks of the cardamoms by rolling them with a pin ; separate the skins from the seeds, put two pounds into the com- fk-pan, and proceed as for Scotch caraways. Make them a good size, and quite smooth. Barberry Comfits.—Pick the barberries from the stalks, and dry them in a hot stove on sieves; when dry, put about two pounds into the comfit pan, and proceed as for almond comfits, giving them first a charge of gum and flour, and finish as others. Make them of a good size and quite smooth; finish with very white loaf sugar in syrup. Cherry Comfits.—These are made from preserved cherries, dried. Roll them in your hand to make them quite round, dust them with powdered loaf sugar, and dry them again ; then proceed as for barberry

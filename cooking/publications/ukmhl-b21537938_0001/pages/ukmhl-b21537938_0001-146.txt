UNIVERSAL COOKERY ROOK. 128 quantity is sufficient. Serve cold with rich puddings. Wine Sauce (Good). — Re- quired : three eggs, yolks only, a gill of sherry or Madeira, and a table- spoonful of castor sugar. Put the ingredients in a jar, set it in a saucepan of boiling water, and whisk until thick; it must not boil, or it will curdle. Serve with plum pudding, or any other kind that requires a nice sauce. Wine Sauce (Plain). — Put a gill of home-made wine (raisin, cowslip, &c.) in a saucepan, with a gill of water, add a little sugar and a tablespoonful of jam: apricot or good plum gives a nice flavour; stir just to the boil, and pour through a hot strainer round the pudding. Another way.—This is very plain. Make a pint of Melted Butter or Cokn-flouu Sauce ; add to it a glass of home-made wine and a little sugar. This may be served with plain pud- dings, dumplings, &e. Whipped Sauce (or Egg Foam Sauce) .—-Rasp a lemon with two ounces of loaf sugar, mix a teaspoonful of arrowroot with a gill of cold water, put altogether in a good-sized saucepan, and add a large tablespoonful of rum, a saltspoonful of vanilla sugar, and tho whites of two eggs, with the yolk of one. Whip the sauce briskly until frothy, and serve hot. This is improved by boiling up the arrowroot and water, and adding the rest when somewhat cooled, then whipping as above directed.

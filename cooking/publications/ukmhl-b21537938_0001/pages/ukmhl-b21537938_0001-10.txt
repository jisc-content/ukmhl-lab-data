We see this more clearly when animal food is in question ; for this, too, needs similar variety of treatment, and for lack of such knowledge of the principle involved, is often half wasted. Again, when by common consent certain articles of food are usually eaten together, there is almost always good reason for it; which, if rightly understood, is a hint for or against other combinations. A real principle is thus fruitful of suggestion or application ; and one good recipe is, to an intelligent cook, a guide to many more. There is no need to tell such air one how other materials may be used in the same way, nor how the recipe may be elaborated for some special occasion, or simplified for economy or for lack of some ingredient; while another cook, good in a way, will have no idea whatever of departing from what is in the book. M Such a grasp of principles will, however, not only tell upon the digestibility and variety of our daily food, but has a direct bearing upon that economy which should always be studied, and must be studied in many cases from sheer necessity. It is still true that an average French housekeeper would half keep a small family upon what an average English one wastes entirely. In many households things are much and happily changed in this respect; but in many others the cook has still to be taught—if indeed the mistress IterselJ knows—how to convert unconsidered trifles and remnants into nourishing and inviting dishes.

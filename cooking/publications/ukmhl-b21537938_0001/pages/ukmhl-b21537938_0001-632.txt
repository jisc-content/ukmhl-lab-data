Whites of Eggs, Poached.— Butter a plain white jar, such as is used for jam, or a plain tin mould, and put in whites of eggs to an inch or so in depth, then set the jar in a saucepan, with boiling water round it, or place it in a potato steamer; lay a buttered paper over, and cook until firm, then set by to get cold, and turn out. Small moulds can be used, but in this way the eggs will cut up to better advantage. For the uses of this, see Garnishes. Yolks of Eggs, Fried.—In some instances the whites of eggs are disliked and left; and in others a good portion is cut away when eggs are prepared for garnishing spinach and other purees. The following mode will enable anyone to cook the yolks only, and then the whites can be used for other purposes. The eggs must be quite fresh for this method, as the perfect separation of the two parts is important. Drop each yolk into a tiny patty-pan, buttered very slightly; lay them in water prepared as for poached eggs, letting it come over the tops; cook until they' will slip from the pans, then lay them in cold water, that they' may' not harden. Take them up in a few minutes and drain on a cloth, then fry them in a little hot fat; just give them a second or two, and pour the fat over the top with a spoon. If any' of the white is by chance left on, it will form a ring that can be removed. These look pretty laid in rings of fried bread when for garnishing. Yolks of Eggs, Poached.— Poach these in water as above, then drain on a cloth, and at once lay them in a saute pan and pour a little hot cream over; leave for a minute, then serve ; they look nice on a green puree.

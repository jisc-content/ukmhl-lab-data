310 National Training School for Cookery. 8. When the milk boils we pour it over the crumbs. 9. We put one gill (quarter of a pint) of cream into a basin, and whip it to a stiff froth with a whisk. 10. We add the cream to the other ingredients, and also stir in one at a time the yolks of four eggs (the whites of two of the eggs we put on a plate, the others we put aside). 11. We whip the whites of the two eggs to a stiff froth with a knife, and then stir them lightly into the basin, mixing all the ingredients together. 12. We take apint mould and butter it well inside. 13. We pour the mixture into the mouldy butter a piece of kitchen paper, and place it over the top. 14. When the water in the stewpan is quite boiling, we stand the mould in it to steam the pudding (the water should only reach half-way up the mould, or it will boil over and spoil the pudding). 15. We let it steam for one hour and a quarter. 16. For serving we take off the buttered paper, and turn the pudding on to a hot dish. GERMAN SAUCE. 1. We put the yolks of two eggs into a stewpan with a wineglassful of sherry and a dessertspoonful of castor sugar. 2. We put the stewpan on the fire and mill it with a whisk till it comes to a thick froth. N.B.â€”We must be careful that the sauce does not boil, or it will curdle. 3. We pour the sauce round the pudding; it is ready for serving.

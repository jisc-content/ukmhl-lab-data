Now we will show you how to make a Meat Pie. 1. We take a tin of Australian mutton or beef, and open it carefully. 2. We take a spoon, and carefully remove the fat from the part of the meat which is required for use. N.B.—All the fat should not be removed, as the meat not required for immediate use will keep better with the fat on the top; but a tin of Atcstralian meat will not keep more than two or three days after it has once been opened. 3. We take a tin of kidneys, open it carefully, and remove the fat from the part of the meat which is required for use. N.B.—The fat should be clarified, by putting it into boiling water, and when cold can then be used as dripping. 4. We take one and a half pound of the meat (jmutton or ■beef) out of the tin, and cut it neatly into nice sized pieces, -and season the pieces with pepper and salt. 5. We take half a pound of the kidneys, and cut them up in pieces. 6. We put three-quarters of a pound of flour into a basin, with salt (to cover thinly a threepenny piece). 7. We take a quarter of a pound of clarified dripping and rub it well into the flour with our hands. N.B.—We should be careful not to leave any lumps.

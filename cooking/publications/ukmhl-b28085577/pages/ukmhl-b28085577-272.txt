Now we will show you how to make Brown Sauce. 1. We take four mushrooms (if large, or six small), cut •off the end of the stalks, wash them well in cold water, and peel them. 2. We take one carrot, wash it, scrape it clean, and cut it in slices. 3. We take one small onion, and a shalot, wash them, peel them, and cut them in slices. 4. We put two ounces of butter into a stewpan, and put it ■on the fire to melt. 5. When the butter in the stewpan is melted, we add all the vegetables, and let them fry brown ; we also stir in two ■ounces of flour, and mix it into a smooth paste with a wooden spoon. 6. We now add one pint of brown stock, and stir the sauce smoothly over the fire, until it boils and thickens. N.B.—The mtiskrooms might be omitted if liked, and the sauce flavoured according to the dish with which it is to be served. 7. We then move the stewpan to the side of the fire, and let it simmer gently for ten minutes.

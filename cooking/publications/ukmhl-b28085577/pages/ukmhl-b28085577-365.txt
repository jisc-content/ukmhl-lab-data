Now we will show you how to make a Milk Jelly from Cow-heel. 1. We buy a dressed cozv-heel from a tripe shop. 2. We put the cow-heel on a board, and cut it up into small pieces. 3. We put these pieces into an earthen jar or a saucepan with one quart of milk and two inches of the stick of einnamon. 4. We put the lid on the top of the jar, put a piece of paper over the lid, and tie it tightly down. 5. We put the jar into a very slow oven to stew for at least three hours. 6. If there is no oven to the stove, we can stand the jar by the side of the fire to stew. N.B.—It reduces less if stewed in the oven. 7. When the stew is finished we take the jar out of the oven, take off the lid, and strain the milk into a basin, and sweeten it according to taste.

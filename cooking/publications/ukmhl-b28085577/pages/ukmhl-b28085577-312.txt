308 National Training School for Cookery. 10. We take a pie-dish (about one pint), and line the edge with puff paste (see “ Pastry,” Lesson No. i). N.B.—If we have, no puff paste, short pasts (see “Pastry,” Lesson No. 2) will do. 11. We pour the mixture into the pie-dish, and put it in the oven (the thermometer at the oven door should rise to 240°) for twenty minutes. 12. We whip the whites of the eggs to a stiff froth. 13. When the pudding is a light brown, we take it out spread the whipped whites of the eggs over the top, and sift about a dessertspoonfid of castor sugar over it. 14. We put the dish back in the oven till the icing is a light brown ; the piidding is then ready for serving.

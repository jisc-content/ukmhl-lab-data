422 National Training School for Cookery. 11. We take a tammy sieve and stand it over a basin. 12. We take the pounded chicken and pass it through the sieve, rubbing it with a wooden spoon. 13. We pour a little of the chicken liquor into the pulp on the sieve to make it pass through more easily. 14. When all the chicken pulp has been passed through into the basin, we stir in one tablespoonful of cream. 15. When the Panada is required, it should be warmed, but great care should be taken not to let it boil or the cream will curdle. We use the bones for Chicken Broth. 1. We take the chicken bones and put them in a saucepan with one pint of cold water. 2. We put the saucepan on the fire, and let it simmer gently for two hours. 3. We must watch it, and skim it occasionally. 4. When required for use, we take a strainer and strain the chicken broth into a basin. 5. We flavour it with pepper and salt according to the taste of the patient.

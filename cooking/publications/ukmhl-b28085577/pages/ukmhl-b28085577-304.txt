INGREDIENTS. oz. of Carolina rice ; o£ Butter o\ 1 tablespoonful of moist sugar oj 1 pint of milk 2% 3s Time required, about two hours. Now we will show you how to make a plain Rice Pudding. 1. We take apint dish and butter it well inside. 2. We take one ounce and a half of Carolina rice, and wash it well in two or three waters. 3. We put the rice into the buttered dish, and sprinkle over it a tablespoonful of moist sugar. 4. We fill up the dish with milk. N.B.—Nutmeg may be grated, or pounded cinnamon be sifted, over the top of the pudding before it is put in the oven. 5. We put the dish into the oven (the thermometer at the oven door, should rise to about 220°) to bake for two hours. 6. We must watch it occasionally, and as the rice soaks up the milk, more milk should be added (carefully lifting up the skim and pouring the milk in at the side), so as to keep the dish always full. It is then ready for serving.

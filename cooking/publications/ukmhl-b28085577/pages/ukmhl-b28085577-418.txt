Now we will show you how to make Scones. 1. We put one pound of flour into a basin and mix into it half an ounce of cream of tartar, a quarter of an ounce of carbonate of soda, and one ounce of sugar. 2. We take three ounces of butter, and rub it well into the flour with our hands. 3. We turn it out on to a floured board. 4. We mix it into a smooth paste with half a pint of milk. 5. We flour a rolling pin and roll it out to make sure that the butter is well mixed in the flour. 6. We flour the rolling pin and roll out the paste to a thin sheet, about one-third of an inch in thickness. 7. We take a knife, dip it in flour, and cut the paste into triangular pieces, each side about four inches long. 8. We flour a tin, put the scones on it, and bake them directly in the oven (the thermometer at the oven door should rise to 240°) for thirty to forty minutes. 9. When the scones are half done, we should brush them over with milk. N.B.—Scones should be served hot.

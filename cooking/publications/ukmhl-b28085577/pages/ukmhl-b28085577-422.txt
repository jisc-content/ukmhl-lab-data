After that time we put the tins into the oven (the thermometer at the oven door should rise to 240°) to bake for a quarter of an hour. 13. We then turn the cakes out of the tins, and place them on a sieve, or on the seat of a cane chair, to cool. They are then ready for serving. N.B.—This will prevent them from getting heavy.

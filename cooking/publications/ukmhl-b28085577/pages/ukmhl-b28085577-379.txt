Lessons on making Souffles. — Vanilla Souffle. 375 6. We take a stewpan and just melt one ozince of butter in it over the fire. 7. We take the stewpan off the fire and stand it on a piece of paper on the table. 8. We add one ounce of flour to the melted butter, and mix them both well together. 9. We then add rather more than a dessertspoonfid of pounded sugar. 10. We add one gill of milk (a gill is a quarter of a pint). 11. We put the stewpan on the fire, and stir smoothly with a wooden spoon until it thickens. 12. We then take the stewpan off the fire again. 13. We add to the mixture the yolks of three eggs, one at a time, and beat all well together. 14. We take the three zv kites of the eggs, and put them in a basin with one more white to make four; adding half a saltspoonfid of salt, and then whip the whites quite stiff. 15. We add the whites to the above mixture and stir it lightly. 16. We now add the flavouring—half a teaspoonfid of Vanilla essence. N.B.—If the essence is very strong, or the bottle newly opened, so much is not required. 17. We mix all together and pour it into the bidtered tin. 18. We have ready a saucepan half filled with hot water, and put it on the fire to boil. 19. When the water boils we stand the tin in it, but we must be careful that the water does not reach the paper round the tin, for it is only the steam which cooks the pudding. 20. We move the saucepan to the side of the fire, and let the pudding steam from twenty to thirty mimdes. 21. We must watch it, not letting the water boil too fast, or the saucepan will get dry and the pudding will burn.

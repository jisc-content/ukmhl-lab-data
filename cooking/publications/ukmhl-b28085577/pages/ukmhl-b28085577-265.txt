Average cost of dressing “Peas.” INGREDIENTS. ^ a peck of Peas r o Salt 1 £ of a saltspoonful of carbonate of soda .. > o of £ an ounce of butter ) Castor sugar o 1 1 Time required, about half an hour. Now we will show you how to dress Peas. 1. We take th^ peas and shell them. 2. We take a saucepan full of warm water and put it on the fire to boil. % 3. When the water is quite boiling, we put in the shelled peas, a teaspoonful of salt, and a quarter of a saltspoonful of carbonate of soda. N.B.—The soda will keep the peas a good colour. 4. We let them boil for from fifteen to twenty minutes, according to the age of the peas. (The cover should be off the saucepan.) 5. After that time we should feel the peas, that they are quite soft, we then take them out of the saucepan and drain off all the water in a colander. 6. We now turn the peas into a saute-pan with half an ounce of butter. 7. We sprinkle about half a teaspoonful of salt, and about a teaspoonful of castor sugar over the peas, and toss them over the fire for a few minutes, but they must not fry. 8. For serving, we arrange them on a hot vegetable dish.

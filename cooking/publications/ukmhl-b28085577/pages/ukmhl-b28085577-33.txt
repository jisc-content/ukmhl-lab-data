Lessons on Re-Cooking Meat.—Meat Fritters. 29 COOKED MEAT. Lesson No. 2. MEAT FRITTERS. Average cost of “ Meat Fritters. INGREDIENTS d. Slices of cold meat 6 4 oz. of flour f 1 tablespoonful of salad oil ) Salt J 2 eggs 2 Dripping for frying - "IS Time required, about half an hour [and one hour for the batter to rise). Now we will show you how to make Meat Fritters, i.e. frying meat in batter. 1. We put four ounces of flour and half a saltspoonful of salt into a basin. 2. We add a tablespoonful of salad oil and mix the flour into a smooth paste. N.B.—We must be careful that the oil is quite sweet. If the oil is objected to, one ounce of melted butter can be used instead. 3. We now stir in smoothly by degrees, a quarter of a pint of tepid water; we must be careful that there are no lumps. 4. We break t*wo eggs, put the whiles on a plate (the yolks we should put in a cup, as they will not be required for present use). 5. We sprinkle a quarter of a saltspoonful of salt over the whites of the eggs, and whip them to a stiff froth with a knife. 6. We stir the whipped whites of the eggs lightly into the batter. N.B.—In winter, clean snow might be used in the batter instead of the whites of eggs. N.B.—This batter might be made without the whites of eggs, in which case it should be mixed with half a pint of beer, instead uf the water, but the batter made with beer will not rise as much as when eggs are used. N.B.—The beer will not taste after the batter is fried.

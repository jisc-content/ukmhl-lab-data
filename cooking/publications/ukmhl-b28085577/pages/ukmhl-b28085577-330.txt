Now we will show you how to make a Treacle Pudding. 1. We put a large saucepan of warm water on the fire to boil. 2. We take a quarter of a pound of suet, put it on a board, cut away the skin, and chop up the suet as finely as possible. 3. We put one pound of flour into a basin with a little salt, and one teaspoonfid of baking powder. 4. We add the chopped suet and one teaspoonfid of ground ginger, and mix all well together with a spoon. 5. We put a quarter of a pound of treacle into a basin with a quarter of a pint of milk and one egg, and mix them together. N.B.—If liked, rather more treacle can be added. - . 6. We stir this into the mixture in the basin, and add more milk if required to. make the pudding moist. N.B.—When the pudding is mixed it should be rather stiff. 7. We take a quart basin, grease it well inside, and pour the mixture into it. N.B.—We should be careful that the basin is full, for if not quite full the water will get into it and spoil the pudding.

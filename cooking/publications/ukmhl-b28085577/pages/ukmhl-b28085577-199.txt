Now we will show you how to make Milk Soup. 1. We put two quarts of water into a large saucepan, and put it on the fire to boil. 2. We take two pounds of potatoes, wash, and scrub them clean in cold water, peel them, and cut them in quarters. 3. We take two leeks, cut off the green tops of the leaves, wash them well in cold water, and cut them up. N.B.—Onions can be used instead of leeks, only they would give a stronger flavour. 4. We put two ounces of butter into a stewpan, we add the vegetables, put the stewpan on the fire, and let the vege- tables sweat in the butter for five minutes. 5. When the water is quite boiling we pour in the vege- tables and butter, we also add a quarter of an ounce of salty and pepper to taste. 6. We let it boil till done to a mash. 7. We then strain off the soup through the colander, or wire sieve. 8. We rub the vegetables through the colander, with a wooden spoon. N 2

For the Roly Poly, about two hours and a half. Now we will show you how to make Suet Crust, to be used for either a Beef-Steak Pudding,, or Roly-Poly, &c. 1. We take five ounces of beef suet, and put it on a board. 2. We take a knife, and cut away all the skin, and chop up the suet as finely as possible. 3. We put half a pound of flour into a basin, and add to it the chopped suet and a teaspoonful of salt. N.B.—If the paste is to be used for a Roly Poly, we should only add a quarter of a saltspoonful of salt. 4. We rub the suet well into the flour with our hands. 5. We then add, by degrees, enough cold water to make it into a stiff paste. We should mix it well. 6. We take the paste out of the basin, and put it on a board.

274 National Training School for Cookery. SAUCES. Lesson No. 7. MELTED BUTTER SAUCE. (For Fish or Pudding.) Average cost of “Melted Butter Sauce” (about a quarter of a pint). INGREDIENTS. d. 1 oz. of fresh butter i§ 2 oz. of flour 5 Time required, about 5 minutes. Now we will show you howto make Melted Butter Sauce. 1. We put one ounce of butter into a stewpan, put it over the fire ; and when it is melted, we stir in half an ounce of four, and mix them smoothly together with a wooden spoon. 2. We now pour in a gill {(quarter of a pint) and a half of cold zvater, and stir the sauce smoothly until it boils and thickens. N.B.—About a quarter of an oz. of btitter stirred into the sauce just before serving, very much improves it, and makes it smoother. If the sauce is to be served with fish, we can add a tablespoonful of anchovy sauce, or a teaspoonful of chopped parsley, and pepper and salt to taste. If the sauce is for puddings, we sweeten it according to taste with castor sugar, and add, if liked, half a wineglassful of sherry ; if it is to be served with treacle pudding, the sauce should be sweetened with treacle.

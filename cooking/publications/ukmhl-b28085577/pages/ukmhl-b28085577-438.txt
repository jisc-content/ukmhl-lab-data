Now we will show you how to make White Wine Whey. 1. We put half a pint of milk into a saucepan and four lumps of sugar. 2. We put the saucepan on the fire to boil. 3. When it boils we pour in a wineglassful of wine (sherry or cowslip) according to taste. N.B.—If the milk is not quite boiling the wine will not curdle it. 4. We move the saucepan to the side of the fire, and let it stand for about one minute. 5. We then strain the whey into a glass and it is ready for serving at once. N.B.—The curds are not digestible. N.B.—Treacle posset is made in the same way, except that no sugar should be added to the milk, and the same quantity of treacle is used instead of wine.

Lessons on Making Puddings.—Plum Pudding. 329 9. We put seven ounces of flour into a basin, and add to it the chopped suet, quarter of a saltspoonful of salt, and a teaspoonful of baking powder. 10. We rub the suet well into the flour with our hands. N.B.—We should be careful not to leave any lumps. 11. We now add the bread crumbs, the currants and raisins, two ounces of moist sugar, and mix all well with a wooden spoon. N.B.—If preferred, treacle may be used instead of sugar. 12. We break two eggs into a basin, add to them one gill (a quarter of a pint) of milk and beat them up. 13. We now stir the milk and eggs into the pudding and mix all well together. 14. We take a cloth, wring it out of hot water, flour it, and lay it over a quart basin. N.B.—We should be careful that the cloth is strong and that there are no holes in it. 15. We turn the mixture from the basin into the centre of the floured cloth. 16. We hold up the four corners of the cloth and tie up the pudding tightly with a piece of string. 17. When the water in the saucepan is quite boiling, we put in the pudding, and let it boil for two hours. N.B.—The lid should be on the saucepan. 18. For serving, we take the pudding out of the cloth and turn it on to a hot dish.

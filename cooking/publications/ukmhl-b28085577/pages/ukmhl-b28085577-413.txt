Lesson on Making Buns. 409 N.B.—This will prevent their getting heavy. 11. After that time we take a tin and grease it with dripping or butter. N.B.—If there is no tin, the shelf from the oven should be greased and used instead. 12. We flour a paste board and turn the dough out on it. 13. We take a knife, dip it in flour, and cut the dough into pieces. 14. We flour our hands, and form the dough into balls. N.B.—This quantity of dough will make about twenty-seven ordinary sized buns. 15. We put the buns on the tin. 16. We put the tin into the oven (the thermometer at the oven door should rise to 240°) to bake the buns for about half an hour. 17. When they are half done, we take the tin out of the oven, brush the buns over with water, and sprinkle white sugar over them. 18. We now put the tin back in the oven. 19. When the buns are sufficiently baked, we take them off the tin and slant them against a plate until they are cold. They are then ready for serving.

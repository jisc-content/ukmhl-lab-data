Lessons on Making Pastry.—Suet Crust. 285 7. We take a rolling-pin and flour it. We also sprinkle flour on the board, to prevent the paste from sticking. N.B.—If a Roly Poly is to be made, we proceed as directed, see Note 24. 8. We roll out the paste once, to the thickness of rather more than one-eighth of an inch. N.B.—Now the paste is ready for use, and if it is required for beef-steak, pudding— 9. We take a quart pudding basin, and butter it well inside. 10. We line the basin smoothly inside with paste. 11. We take a knife, flour it, and cut away the paste that is above the edge of the basin. 12. We fold this paste together, and roll it out to a round, the size of the top of the basin, one-eighth of an inch in thickness. 13. We take one pound and a half of rump or beef-steak, put it on a board, and cut it into thin slices. 14. We flour the slices well (using about a tablespoonful of flour), and season them with plenty of pepper and salt. 15. We take half a pound of beef kidney, and cut it up in small pieces. 16. We roll up the slices of beef-steak, and fill the basin with the meat and the kidney. N.B.—The pudding might be flavoured with shalot, parsley, and mushrooms according to taste. 17. We now pour into the basin one gill of water. 18. We wet the paste round the edge of the basin with cold water, and cover over the top of the basin with the round of paste. 19. We must join the paste together at the edge of the basin, pressing it down with our thumb. 20. We take a pudding cloth, flour it, and lay it over the top of the basin, tying it on tightly with a piece of twine. 21. We take a large saucepan of warm water, and put it on the fire to boil.

126 National Training School for Cookery. 10. We dip each slice of meat and kidney into the plate of seasoning. 11. We take a quart basin and grease it well inside with dripping. 12. We take a rolling pin and flour it; we also sprinkle a very little flour on the board to prevent the paste sticking. N.B.â€”In making paste we should always keep our hands well floured to prevent its sticking to them. 13. We take the paste out of the basin and put it on the board. 14. We cut off about one-third of the paste and lay it aside for the cover or top of the pudding. 15. We roll out the remainder of the paste to a round twice the size of the top of the basin ; it should be about one-third of an inch in thickness. 16. We line the basin inside smoothly with the paste. 17. We place the slices of meat and kidney in the basin, fitting them neatly in. 18. We pour in about one gill and a half of water, so as to fill the basin to within half an inch of the top. 19. We roll the remaining pieces of paste to a round, the size of the top of the basin, to about a quarter of an inch in thickness. 20. We wet the edge of the paste in the basin with cold water, and cover over the top of the basin with the round of paste. 21. We must join the paste together at the edge of the basin, pressing the edges together with our thumb. 22. We take a knife, flour it, and trim the edges of the paste neatly round. 23. We take a small pudding cloth, wring it out in warm water, and flour it. 24. We put this cloth over the top of the basin, tying it on tightly with a piece of string under the rim of the basin. 25. We tie the four corners of the cloth together over the top of the pudding.

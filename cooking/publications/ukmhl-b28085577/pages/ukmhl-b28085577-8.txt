Preface. 4 IV. The work is based upon the instruction given by the cooks in the School, and it has been used and tested in the National Training School for Cookery since 1875. The instructors now em- ployed in local schools throughout the country have been taught and practised by means of these lessons. V. It has been found that it is most convenient to practise the lesson with the instructions in sight close at hand. An edition of each lesson has been printed on separate sheets of thick paper, for the use of students and teachers, which may be obtained at the National Training School for Cookery, or at the Publishers. VI. The present Edition has been revised throughout; some changes have been made, and some new recipes have been added in an Appendix. VII. Still the writer continues to request that the notices of any errors and omissions, which are inevitable in a work of this kind, may be com- municated to R. O. C. to the care of the Publishers. R. O.

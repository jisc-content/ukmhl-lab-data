Lessons on Cooking Meat.—Baking. 23 form a brown crust on the outside of the joint, to keep in the juices of the meat. After that time the ventilator of the oven should be opened, so as to allow the steam to escape, or the meat would get sodden. N.B.—Meat that is frozen must be gradually warmed, to thaw it before shutting it up in the hot oven, or it would be tough. 8. We must baste the joint every jifteen minutes with the drippings that run from the meat into the pan, using the dripping ladle. N. B.—Joints that are not very fat must be even more frequently basted, or they would burn : if there is not sufficient dripping from the meat, a little extra dripping should be put into the pan. N. B.—Joints that have no fat should be covered with a piece of whitey brown paper which has been spread with butter or dripping—it will prevent the meat catching too quickly. 9. We should turn the joint over occasionally, as the upper side will get browned quicker than the lower. N.B.—Potatoes, washed and peeled, or a small suet or dripping and flour pudding (see “ Puddings,” Lesson No. 28), or a Yorkshire pudding (see “ Puddings,” Lesson No. 29), might be baked under the meat, but they should only be put in half an hotir before the meat is finished. 10. Just before we dish up the joints we should sprinkle about a saltspoonfitl of salt over it, and then baste it well. 11. We serve the joint on a hot dish (as described in “Lesson on Roasting,” Note 22, and act with regard to the dripping according to the “ N.B.” after Note 23.) N.B.—Pastry ox bread, &c., should not be baked in the oven at the same time as the meat, as the steam would prevent their baking properly, For baking small patties and tartlets made of Puff Paste, the ther- mometer fixed in the oven door should rise to 300° Fahrenheit. For meat pies, tarts, &c., the thermometer should rise to 280°. For bread the thermometer should rise to 280°, and must be reduced after a quarter of an hour to 2200.

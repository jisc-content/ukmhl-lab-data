Now we will show you how to make Bread-and-Buttcr Pudding. 1. We butter, and cut six thin slices of bread. 2. We grease the inside of a pint pie dish, with half an ounce of clarified dripping. 3. We take one ounce of currants, wash them well, dry them in a clean cloth, and pick them over. 4. We lay the slices of bread and butter in the pie dish, and sprinkle the currants between each slice of bread and butter. N.B.—One ounce of candied peel, chopped up fine, might be sprinkled in as well, if liked. 5. We break two eggs into a cup, and beat them up well, we add to them a tablespoonful of moist sugar and a pint of milk, and stir them well together. 6. We pour this custard over the bread and butter in the pie dish, take a grater and a nutmeg, and grate about half a teaspoonful of nutmeg over the top; and then let the pudding soak, for half an hour before baking. 7. After that time we put the pudding into a moderate oven (the thermometer at the oven door should mark 220° Fahrenheit), to bake for about half an hour. 8. The pudding can be served in the dish, or turned out on to a hot flat dish, and then sprinkled with half a teaspoonful of castor sugar.

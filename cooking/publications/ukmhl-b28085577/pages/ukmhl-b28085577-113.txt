We take three and a half pounds of the fillet of veal, put it on a board, and cut off all the skin with a sharp knife. 2. We lard this fillet in the same way as for fillets of beef (see “ Entree,” Lesson No. 3, from Note 3 to Note 7). 3. We place the fillet carefully in a braising pan. 4. We add a bouquet garni, consisting of a sprig of parsley, thyme, and a bay-leaf.\ all tied neatly and tightly together. 5. We take two young carrots, wash them, scrape them clean with a knife and cut them in halves. 6. We take an onion and a quarter of a turnip, and peel them carefully. 7. We add these vegetables, and half a stick of celery, to the fillet in the braising pan. 8. We now pour in about three pints of good stock (the stock must not cover the meat), put the braising pan on the fire, and baste the fillet continually. 9. We take a piece of kitchen paper, cut a round to the size of the braising pan and butter it. 10. As soon as the stock boils, we lay this round of paper on the fillet in the stewpan. N.B.—This paper is to prevent the meat from browning too quickly.

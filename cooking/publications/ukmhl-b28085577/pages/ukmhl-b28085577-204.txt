Now we will show you how to make Soup from Bones. 1. We take the bones and cut off all the meat that can be used. N.B.—Cooked or uncooked bones can be used. 2. We break up the bones in pieces and put them into a saucepan, with cold water enough to cover them, and one quart more. 3. We put the saucepan on the fire to boil. 4. When it just boils, we put in a tablespoonfid of salt, to help the scum to rise. 5. We take one good-sized turnip, peel it, and cut it in quarters. N.B.—When turnips are used only for flavouring, they can be peeled thinner than if for eating. 6. We take two carrots, wash them, scrape them, and cut them in quarters ; we take four leeks, wash them, and shred them up finely. N.B.—As these vegetables are prepared, they should be thrown into cold water to keep them fresh.

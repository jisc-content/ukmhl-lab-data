We grate some bread crumbs with a grater on to the board. 7. We wash two or three sprigs of parsley in cold water, dry them in a cloth, and chop the parsley up as finely as possible on a board; when chopped there should be about one tablespoonful. 8. We take a sprig of thyme, lemon thyme and marjoram, rub them through a strainer, or chop them up finely on a board ; there should be about one dessertspoonful of the mixed herbs. 9. We now mix the chopped suet, and bread crumbs well together, and then add the parsley, the herbs, one teaspoon- ful of salti and pepper to taste, and mix them thoroughly together. 10. We now mix it with one gill (a quarter of a pint) of milk, and one egg. 11. We take the heart and fill all the cavities with the stuffing, pressing it in as firmly as possible. N. B.—If there be any stuffing over, it can be put aside for the sauce. 12. We grease a piece of kitchen paper well with a piece of butter or dripping; and then place over the top of the heart where the cavities are, and tie it on tightly with string. 13. We put the roasting screen in front of the fire, to keep off the draught, and to keep in all the heat. N.B.—The Bullock's or Calf's heart can be roasted in a stewpan instead of in front of the fire. N.B.—For roasting in a stewpan. A. We take the heart already stuffed and prepared as above and put it in a stewpan, with 2 oz. of clarified dripping, and put the stewpan over a slow fire. B. We must baste it well with the dripping, and turn it occasionally. The Bullock's heart will take two hours to roast, the Calf's heart only one hour. N.B.—A Bullock's heart is better roasted in front of the fire on account oi its size.

We let it gently simmer one hour. 18. We take the fat which we have cut off the steak, and cut it into small pieces. 14. We put the pieces of fat on a tin dish. 15. We put the fat in the oven to cook till brown. N.B.—It is better for stewed steak, to cook the fat separately, as it keeps the gravy of the steak free from grease. 16. When the steak is sufficiently stewed, we must put it on a hot dish, put the vegetables round, and pour the sauce over; we take the tin dish out of the oven, and place the pieces of fat about on the steak. It is now ready for serving. N.B.—If liked, for serving the steak might be cut up in small pieces, about the size of a veal cutlet, and the vegetables arranged on each piece of steak, or in the centre. About a teaspoonfrtl of chopped parsley sprinkled over the top is an improvement to the taste and look.

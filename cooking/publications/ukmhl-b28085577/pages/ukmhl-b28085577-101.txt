Lessons on Cooking Mext.—Stewed Ox Cheek. 9 7 7. We put the rolled ox cheek, the bones, and all these vegetables into a saucepan, we also add a blade of mace, twenty peppercorns, a tablespoonful of salt, and a bouquet garni, consisting of a sprig of thyme, marjoram, parsley, and a bay leaf, tied tightly together. 8. We pour in sufficient cold water to cover it all, about six quarts; put the saucepan on the fire, bring it to the boil, then skim it well, and move the saucepan to the side of the fire to simmer gently for four hours. 9. When the ox cheek is nearly done, we should make the sauce. 10. We put oyie ounce of butter in a small stewpan, and put it over the fire to melt. 11. We now stir in smoothly one ounce of flour. 12. We take one pint of ox cheek stock, from the saucepan, and pour it into the stewpan, stirring well until the sauce boils, and thickens, we then add a teaspoonful of mushroom ketchup, and a teaspoonful of Harvey sauce, and stand the stewpan by the side of the fire to keep warm. 13. For serving, we take the rolled ox cheek out of the saucepan, carefully remove the string, place it in the centre of a hot dish, and pour the sauce over it. N.B.—The stock should be poured through a strainer into a basin, and put aside to cool, so that the fat can be removed; the stock can then be used for Ox Cheek Soup, and it should be thickened with two ounces of flour; the flour must be mixed to a smooth paste with a little of the stock, then added to the remainder of the stock, and stirred over the fire till it boils and thickens. The remains of the Ox Cheek, after serving, should be cut up in small pieces, and added to the soup. G

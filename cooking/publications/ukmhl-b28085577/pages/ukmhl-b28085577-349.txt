Now we will show you how to make a Ginger Pudding. 1. We put a large saucepan of water on the fire to boil. 2. We put a quarter of a pound of suet on a board, cut away the skin and chop it up very finely with a sharp knife. 3. We put half a pound of four into a basin, add the chopped suet, and rub it well into the flour with our fingers. N.B.—We must be careful not to leave any lumps. 4. We take some ginger and a grater, and grate tzvo large teaspoonsful of sugar. 5. We now add the grated ginger and half a pound of moist sugar to the basin, and mix all well together. 6. We take a small basin (about I pint) butter it well inside, and turn the dry mixture into the basin. 7. We take a pudding cloth, wring it out in hot water, and then in cold, and sprinkle some flour over it. 8. We place the floured cloth over the basin, and tie it on with string just below the rim. we tie the ends of the cloth together. 9. When the water in the saucepan is quite boiling, we put in the pudding, and let it boil, for at least six hours. 10. For serving we take out the basin, take off the cloth, and turn the pudding carefully out on to a hot dish. N.B.—If liked, melted butter sauce (see “ Sauces," Lesson No. 7) may be served with the pudding.

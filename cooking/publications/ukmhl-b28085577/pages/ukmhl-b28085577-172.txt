168 National Training School for Cookery. 24. We must now turn the fowl on its breast, and take the threaded trussing needle again, and pass it through the middle of the pinion or wing, through the little bone called the sidesman or stepmother’s wing, catching up the skin which folds over the incision, and out through the other little bone and wing. 25. We must pull this twine very tightly and tie it as firmly as possible at the side of the fowl. 26. We turn the fowl over on its back, keeping the neck still towards us. 27. We put our finger in the incision (made for drawing the fowl) and lift up the end of the breast bone. 28. We take the threaded trussing needle and pass it through the skin over the bottom of the breast bone, over the end of one leg, back through the body close to the backbone, and tie it firmly over the other leg at the side. N.B.—If there is no gravy ready for serving with the roast fowl, we should prepare it now (see Note at the end). 29. We now put the screen with the jack and dripping- pan before the fire. 80. We must make up the fire in the same manner as described in Roasting. N.B.—We do not require such a large fire as for roasting meat. 31. We take the trussed fowl and pass the hook of the jack through the back of the fowl\ and hang it up on the jack. N.B.—If the fire is very fierce, we should take a piece of whitey brown paper, butter it, and tie it over the fowl so as to prevent it from burning. 32. We put one ounce of butter in the dripping-pan to melt. 33. We use this melted butter to baste the fowl, as the fowl is not very fat, there will not be much dripping from it. 34. The fowl will take from half an hour to three-quarters of an hour to roast, according to its size. 35. We must baste the fowl frequently. N.B.—While the fowl is roasting, we should make the bread sauce (see below). N.B.—If liked, the roast fowl can be garnished with rolls of bacon (see the end of “Veal Cutlets," Entries, Lesson No. 6).

Now we will show you how to make Puff Paste for a fruit tart, tartlets, or patty cases. 1. We take half a pound of butter and lay it on a clean cloth. 2. We fold the cloth over the butter and squeeze it to get all the water out of the butter. 3. We take half a pound of flour, put it in a heap on a board, and make a well in the centre of the floitr. 4. We add a quarter of a saltspoonful of salt, a teaspoon- ful of lemon juice, and sufficient water to make the paste of the same consistency as the squeezed butter, and work it well together. 5. We take a rolling pin, flour it, and also sprinkle flour on the board to prevent the paste from sticking. 6. We roll out the paste rather thin, to about a quarter of an inch in thickness.

We take an egg, break it, put the white in a cup (it is not required for present use), and add the yolk to the sauce, and stir well over the fire till cooked ; it will take about five minutes. 9. We must then turn the mixture on to a plate, and stand it aside to cool. 10. We put one pound of clarified dripping or lard into a deep stewpan, and put it on the fire to heat: we must be careful it does not burn. 11. When the mixture is quite cold, we divide it into pieces of equal size, and form them into cakes; we must sprinkle some flour over them, to prevent them from sticking. 12. We break an egg on to a plate, and beat it up slightly with a knife. 13. We dip the cakes into the egg,; and egg them well all over with a paste-brush. 14. We take the rest of the bread-crumbs, and cover the cakes well all over with them. 15. We take a frying basket, and arrange the cakes in it; we must finger them as little as possible, and not allow them to touch each other. 16. When the fat is quite hot, and smoking (we should test the heat of it by throwing in a piece of bread, which should fry brown directly), we put in the frying basket, for two minutes or so, to fry the cakes a pale yellow. 17. We put a piece of whitey-brown paper on a plate, and as the cakes are fried, we turn them on to the paper, to drain off the grease. 18. For serving, we arrange the cakes tastily on a hot dish, and, if liked, garnish them with fried parsley (see Vege- tables, Lesson No. 4, note 20).

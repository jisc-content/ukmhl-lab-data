INGREDIENTS. d. 5 a quartern of dough 4 1 egg 1 \ lb. of sugar 1 lb. of currants 1 2 oz. of butter 2 1 oz. of candied peel 1 10 Time required, about an hour and a half. Now we will show you how to make a Dough Cake. 1. We put half a quartern of dough (made as for bread\ see “Bread,” Lesson No. i) into a basin. 2. We take a quarter of a pound of currants, wash them, dry them in a cloth, and pick them over to see there are no stones mixed with them. 3. We add the currants, a quarter of a pound of moist sugar, and one ounce of candied peel chopped finely, to the dough. N.B.—If liked, half a teaspoonful of mixed spice might be added. 4. We now break one egg into the basin, add two ounces of butter, and beat all the ingredients well together. 5. We take a tin, and grease it well inside with dripping. 6. We turn the mixture into the greased tin. 7. We put the tin into the oven (the thermometer at the oven door should rise to 240°) until the cake is sufficiently baked ; it will take about forty minutes. N.B.—To test if the cake is done, we should run a clean knife into it, and if it comes out clean, the cake is sufficiently baked. 8. We then turn the cake out of the tin, and place it on its side, leaning against a plate until it is cold. It is then ready for serving.

Now we will show you how to make a Strawbeny Cream. 1. We take a pint of fresh strawberries, and put them on a board. 2. We must pick them over, and put aside any that are not quite good. 3. We must stalk them, and put them in a basin. 4. We sprinkle over them half an ounce of white castor sugar, which will help to draw out the juice. 5. We take a silk sieve and place it over a basin. N.B.—A hair sieve could be used instead. 6. We pass the fruit through the sieve with a wooden spoon. 7. We put three-quarters of an ounce of the best gelatine into a small stewpan, with two tablespoonsful of cold water, to soak and to swell. 8. We then put the stewpan on the fire, and stir the gelatine until it is quite melted. 9. We add two ounces of castor sugar, and squeeze the juice of one lemon through a strainer into the stewpan.

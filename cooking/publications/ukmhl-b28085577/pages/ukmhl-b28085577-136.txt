Now we will show you howto make a Sea Pie. 1. We put two pounds of buttock steak on a board, and cut it in slices with a sharp knife. 2. We take two onions, peel them, and slice them as thinly as possible. 3. We take a small carrot, wash it, scrape it clean with a knife, and cut it in thin slices. 4. We season the slices of meat with pepper and salt to taste. 5. We put the slices of meat in layers in a two quart saucepan, sprinkling a little of the sliced vegetables on each layer of the meat. 6. We pour in enough cold water just to cover the meat. 7. We put the saucepan on the fire, just bring it to the boil, and then move it to the side of the fire to simmer. N.B.—During this time we make the crust. 8. We take a quarter of a pound of suet, put it on a board, cut away all the skin, and chop it up as finely as possible. 9. We should sprinkle a little flour over the suet, to prevent it sticking to the board or knife. 10. We put three quarters of a pound of flour i^to a basin.

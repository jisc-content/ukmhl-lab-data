Time required, about a quarter of an hour. Now we will show you how to make Quick Beef Tea. 1. We take half a pound of gravy beef put it on a board, and cut it up very fine, removing all the skin and fat. 2. We put it in a saucepan with its equal weight in water, i.e., half a pint. 3. We put the saucepan on the fire and bring it quickly to the boil. 4. We let it boil for five minutes, and then pour it off into a cup and it is ready for serving.

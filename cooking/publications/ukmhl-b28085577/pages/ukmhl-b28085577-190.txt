186 National Training School for Cookery. 5. As soon as it boils, we should skim it carefully with a spoon, and move the stewpan to the side of the fire to stew gently for three hours. N.B.—We should watch it and skim it occasionally. 6. After that time we take out the calfs head,\ and pour the stock through a strainer into a basin. 7. We stand the basin of stock aside to get cold, when we should carefully remove every particle of fat from the top of the stock. 8. We must now make some forcemeat (see “Beef j)lives,” Entrees, Lesson No. 8, from Note 4 to Note 12), and make it up into little balls, about one dozen. 9. We take six mushrooms (cut off the end of the stalks), one onion, and half a turnip, wash them, peel them, and cut them up in slices. 10. We take one carrot, wash it, scrape it clean, and cut it in slices. 11. We take half a head of celery, and one leek, wash them, cut off the long green leaves (to be thrown away); and cut them in slices. 12. We put a quarter of a pound of lea7i ham on a board, and cut it up in small pieces. 13. We put one ounce of butter in a stewpan, and put it on the fire to melt. 14. We add the ham and all the sliced vegetables to the butter in the stewpan. 15. We also add one shalot (peeled), one clove of garlic, one blade of mace, six cloves, and a bouquet garni (consisting of a sprig of thyme, marjoram, parsley, basil, and a bay leaf tied tightly together). 16. We let all these vegetables and herbs, &c., fry in the butter for ten minutes. We must stir them occasionally. 17. After that time we add three ounces of flour, and stir well. 18. We now add the stock and stir it until it boils, then move the stewpan to the side of the fire, and let it simmer for about ten minutes.

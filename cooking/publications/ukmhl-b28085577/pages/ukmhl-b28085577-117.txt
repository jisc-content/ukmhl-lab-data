Lessons on Cooking Meat.—Roast Bullocks Heart. 113 21. We put the dripping-pan, or a large dish, down on a stand within the screen close to the fire, with the dripping ladle or a large spoon in it. 22. We hang the, roasting-jack up from the mantlepiece over the dripping-pan. N.B.—If there be no roasting-jack, we can manage with a strong piece of worsted tied to a poor man’s jack. 23. We must wind up the jack with its key, before we put the meat on. 24. We take the hook of the roasting-jack and pass it through the heart, and hang it on the jack or the worsted. N.B.—If the heart is hanging from a piece of worsted, we must twist the- worsted occasionally to make it go round. 25. We put about a quarter of a pound of clarified dripping into the dripping-pan, and baste the heart occa- sionally. 26. It will take about two hours to roast. 27. We take one small onion, peel it, and cut it in slices. 28. We put the onion in a saucepan, with one ounce of butter, or clarified dripping. 29. We put the saucepan on the fire, and let the onion fry a nice brown. 30. We now add one tablespoonful of flour, and mix them smoothly together with a wooden spoon. 31. We pour in half a pint of cold water, season it with salt andpepper to taste, and stir smoothly until it boils and thickens; 32. We then stand the saucepan by the side of the fire until required for use. 33. When the heart is roasted, we take it down, place the heart on a hot dish and draw out the hook. 34. We cut the string and take off the greased paper. H

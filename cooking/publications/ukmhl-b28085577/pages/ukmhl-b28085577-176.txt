We put the saucepan on the fire and let it just come to the boil. N.B.—This is to blanch the vegetables. 24. We take the saucepan off the fire and strain the water from the vegetables. 25. We take a stewpan, and put in the blanched vege- tables and cabbage lettuce and peas ; we add a lump of sugar and half a pint of the clear soup 26. We put the stewpan on the fire to boil fast, and re- duce the soup to a glaze over the vegetables. 27. We take the basin of strained soup and pour the „soup on the vegetables in the stewpan, and let it just boil. 28. We then remove the stewpan to the side of the fire? and let it boil gently for half an hour. 29. For serving we pour the soup into a hot soup tureen. For Savoury Custard. 30. We take the yolks of three eggs, and the white of one, and put them in a small basin. 31. We add one gill of the clear soup, and a quarter of a saltspoonful of salt. 32. We whisk up the eggs and the stock well together. 33. We take a small gallipot and butter it inside. 34. We pour the mixture into the gallipot. 35. We take a piece of whitey-brown paper and butter it. 36. We put this buttered paper over the top of the gallipot and tie it on with a piece of string. 37. We take a saucepan of hot water and put it on the fire. 38. When the water is quite boiling, we stand the little gallipot in it. N.B.—The water must not quite reach the paper with which the gallipot is covered. 39. We draw this saucepan to the side of the fire, and let it simmer for a quarter of an hour. N.B.—It must not boil or the custard will be spoiled.

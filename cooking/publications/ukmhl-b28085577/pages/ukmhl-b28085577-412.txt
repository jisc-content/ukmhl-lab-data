Time required, alout two hours and a half. Now we will show you how to make Buns. 1. We put one gill and a half (one gill is a quarter of a pint) of milk into a saucepan and put it on the fire. 2. We put one ounce of German yeast into a basin. 3. When the milk is just warm, we pour it by degrees on to the yeast, mixing them well together with a spoon. 4. We put one pound of flour into a large basin and stir into it the milk and yeast, mixing it into a dough. 5. We cover the basin with a cloth, and stand it on the fender, and let it rise for about one hour. 6. We put one gill and a half of milk into a saucepan, with one ounce of butter, and put it on the fire to warm. 7. We put half a pound of flour into a basin and stir into it the milk and butter. 8. When the dough is sufficiently risen, we turn it into this mixture, and work them well together. 9. We now add a quarter of a pound of sultana raisins or currants and a quarter of a pound of moist sugar, and mix all well together. N.B.—If currants are used they should be well washed, dried in a cloth, and carefully picked over to see if there are any stones mixed with them. 10. We cover the basin with a cloth and stand it near the fire to rise again for one hour.

N.B.â€”The vegetables should be washed, scraped, and peeled before use. 7. We let all boil gently for five hours. 8. We then strain it off through a hair sieve into a basin, and let stand until perfectly cold ; skim off the fat from the top, and wipe it with a cloth dipped in hot water, to remove every particle of grease. 9. We put the stock into a clean stewpan, peel the lemon very thinly, and add the peel, and juice, to the stock, also add the whipped whites of two eggs, and the shells, the vinegars, and salt to taste, whisk all over the fire until it boils; then put the stewpan by the side of the fire, and let it stand for half-an-hour, to form a crust. 10. We take a clean soup clcth, and fix it on the stand. 11. We pour the contents into the cloth, and let it all run through into a basin placed underneath. 12. We let it pass a second time slowly, into the basin. 13. We scald a mould with boiling water, then rinse it in cold water before pouring the jelly into it. 14. We garnish the mould, with fish, or vegetables, according to taste, and stand it aside until cold. 15. When the jelly is required, we should dip the mould into a basin of hot water, for about a second, shake the mould to loosen the jelly, place a dish over the top of the mould, and turn the jelly carefully out, it is then ready for serving.

L essons on Cooking Vegetables.—Fried Potatoes. 251 13. For serving we arrange them on a hot dish. For Fried Slices of Potato— 1 We take the potatoes, wash them clean, and peel them with a sharp knife. 2. We put the potatoes on a board, and cut them in slices, about one-eighth of an inch in thickness. 3. We take a saucepan and put in it one and a half pound of clarified dripping or lard. 4. We take a frying-basket and place in it the sliced potatoes. 5. We put the saucepan on the fire to warm the fat. 6. When the fat is warm, but not very hot, we place in the frying-basket with the slices of potatoes, and let them boil in the fat, until they are quite tender. N.B.—We should take out a piece of potato and press it between the thumb and finger, to feel that it is quite tender. 7. We must now take out the frying-basket with the potatoes and place it on a plate. 8. We leave the fat on the fire to heat. 9. When the fat is quite hot, we place in the frying- basket with the potatoes for about two minutes. 10. We put a piece of whitey-brown paper on a plate. 11. When the potatoes are fried, they should be a pale brown ; we turn them out on to the paper to drain off the grease. 12. We should sprinkle a little salt over them.

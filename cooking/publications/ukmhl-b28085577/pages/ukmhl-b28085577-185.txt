Lessons on Making Soup.—Spring Vegetable Soup, x 81 9. We put the stockpot on the fire, with the lid on, and let it come to the boil quickly. 10. We take a spoon and remove all the scum as it rises. 11. We now draw the stockpot rather to the side of the fire and let it simmer gently for five hours. 12. We take two young carrots, scrape them clean with a knife, and cut them in slices. 13. We take one young turnip, peel it, and cut it in slices. 14. We take half a head of celery and one leek, wash them well in cold water, and cut them in squares with a knife. 15. We take one cauliflower, wash it in cold water, and put it in a basin of cold water, with a dessertspoonfid of , salt, for two or three minutes. 16. We then take the caidiflower out of the water, and squeeze it dry in a cloth. 17. We take a knife and cut off all the green leaves and the stalk from the cauliflower, and pull the flower into sprigs. 18. We must watch and skim the soup occasionally, and we should add a little cold water to make the scum rise. 19. One hour before serving the soup we should add the vegetables. 20. We must first put in the sliced carrots, and the cut up celery and leek. (These vegetables take the longest to boil.) 21. In half an hour we.should add the sliced turnips, and fifteen minutes after that the cut up flower of the cauli- flower. 22. We take a saucepan full of hot water, and put it on the fire to boil. 23. When the water is quite boiling, we put in one gill of shelled peas, a teaspoonfid of salt, and a quarter of a salt- spoonful of carbonate of soda, and let it boil from fifteen to twenty minutes, according to the age of the peas. N.B.—The cover should be off the saucepan.

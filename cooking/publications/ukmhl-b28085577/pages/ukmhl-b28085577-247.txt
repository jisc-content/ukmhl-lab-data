We take a quarter of a pound of rice, wash it, boil it, -and dry it, as directed in Lesson on rice. 2. While the rice is boiling, we take a small saucepan full of hot water, and put it on the fire to boil ; when it boils, we should put tzvo eggs in carefully, and let them boil hard for ten minutes. 3. We take some cold boiled fish, break it in pieces, and carefully remove all the bones. 4. When the eggs are sufficiently boiled, we take them out of the saucepan ; we should tap them all over on the edge of a basin, and take off all the shell: we then put the •eggs in a basin of cold water. 5. We take the eggs out of the water, put them on a board, cut them in halves, take out thq yolks, and cut the whites up in pieces to the shape of dice. 6. When the boiled rice is dry, we put two ounces of butter in a stewpan, put it on the fire, and when the butter is melted, we should add the rice and stir it well with a fork.

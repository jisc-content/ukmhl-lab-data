Now we will show you how to make a Cornflour Cake. 1. We put two ounces of butter into a basin, and beat it to a cream. 2. We add to the butter a quarter of a pound of pounded loaf sugar, and mix it well. 3. We break in tzvo eggs and beat all well together. 4. We now stir lightly into the mixture a quarter of a pound of cornflour, one tablespoonful of flour, and a tcaspoonful of baking pozvder, and beat it well together for five minutes. 5. We grease a cake tin inside with butter or dripping. 6. We pour the mixttire into the tin and put it imme- diately into the oven (the thermometer at the oven door should rise to 240°) to bake for half an hour. 7. After that time we turn the cake out of the tin and slant it against a plate until it is cold. (This will prevent its getting heavy.) It is then ready for serving. N.B.—If preferred, the mixture could be baked in small tins instead of one large one, in which case it would only take fifteen minutes to bake. C C 2

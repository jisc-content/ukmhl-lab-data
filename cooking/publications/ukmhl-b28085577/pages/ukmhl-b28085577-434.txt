We take six apples, peel them, and cut out the core. N.B.—When the apples are juicy, six will be sufficient, but more may be required according to the season of the year. 2. We put a kettle of water on the fire to boil. 3. We cut the apples up in slices. 4. We take half a lemon, wipe it clean in a cloth, and peel it very thinly. 5. We put the slices of apple and the lemon rind into a jug- 6. When the water is quite boiling, we pour one quart of it on to the apples in the jug. 7. We sweeten it according to taste. 8.

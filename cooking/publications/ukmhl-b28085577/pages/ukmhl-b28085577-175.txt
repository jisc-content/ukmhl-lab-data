Lessons on Making Soup.—Clear Soup. 171 8. We take a sharp knife, and scrape the carrot quite clean, and slice it up. 9. We take the turnip, peel it, and cut it in small pieces. 10. We take the leek, and cut off part of the long green leaves, and the little straggling roots, and chop up finely the remainder. 11. We put all these vegetables into the stewpan, and stir them all well with an iron spoon, until they are well mixed with the beef and stock. 12. We put the stewpan on the fire, and stir the contents until it boils. 13. We must stand the stewpan by the side of the fire for twenty minutes. 14. We take a clean soup cloth, and fix it on the soup- stand. 15. We take a large basin, and place it below the cloth. 16. We take the stewpan off the fire, and pour the contents carefully into the cloth, and let it all pass into the basin. N.B.—The chopped gravy beef acts as a filter to the soup. 17. After the soup has all passed through, we remove the basin and put a clean one in its place. 18. We take a soup ladle and pour a little of the soup (at a time) over the meat in the cloth, and let it pass through very slowly. N.B.—We must be careful not to disturb the deposit of chopped beef, which settles at the bottom of the cloth. N.B—If savoury custard should be preferred in theso2tp, instead of shredded vegetables, see No. 31. 19. We take a small carrot, a leek, cabbage lettuce, and a tablespoonful of young peas, and wash them in cold water. 20. We put the vegetables on a board, scrape the carrot clean, and cut off all the outside leaves of the lettuce, and the long green leaves of the leek. 21. We must shred the carrot, leek and cabbage lettuce* very finely in equal lengths.

We put them into a saucepan with three pints of cold water, and a quarter of an ounce of clarified dripping. 3. We put the saucepan on the fire, and when it boils we move it rather to the side of the fire and let it boil very gently for two hours. 4. After that time we turn the beans on to a colander, drain off the water, and put the beans back into the dry saucepan with one ounce of butter. 5. We take a sprig of parsley, wash it, and dry it in a cloth, put it on a board and chop it up as finely as possible. 6. We sprinkle the parsley over the beans and season them with pepper and salt. 7.

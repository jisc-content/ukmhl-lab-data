Now we will show you how to cook Salmon, and make Tartare Sauce. 1. We take a slice of salmon weighing one pound. 2. We wipe the salmon with a clean cloth. 3. We take a plate, and pour on it about a gill of salad oil. 4. We dip the slice of salmon into the oil, on both sides, the oil will prevent the fish from drying whilst cooking. 5. We season the slice on both sides, with pepper and salt. 6. We take a gridiron and heat it on both sides, by the fire. This is to prevent the fish sticking. 7. When the gridiron is hot, we place on the slice of salmon, and let it grill for a quarter of an hour. N.B.—While the salmon is cooking, we must make the sauce.

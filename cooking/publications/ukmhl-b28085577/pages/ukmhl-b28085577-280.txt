276 National Training School for Cookery. 7. We place the pat of squeezed butter on one half of the paste, and fold the other half over the butter, so as to cover it entirely, pressing the edges together with our thumb. 8. We let it stand on a plate in a cool place for a quarter of an hour. N.B.—It is not necessary to do this in cold weather, it might be rolled at once. 9. We bring the paste back and place it on the board, we roll it out with the rolling pin and fold it over in three. 10. We turn it round with the rough edges towards us. 11. We roll it again and fold it in three. 12. We put it aside again for a quarter of an hour. 13. We bring it back on the board and roll it with a rolling pin and fold it in three, twice as before. 14. We put it aside again for a quarter of an hour. 15. We bring it back to the board and roll it and fold it in three as before. 16. We put it aside for another quarter of an hour. 17. We bring it back to the board, and roll it out ready, if for a fruit tart, (see “ Pastry,” Lesson No. 2, from note 14 to note 27). 18. If the paste is used for tartlets, the paste should be one-eighth of an inch thick. (If for patty cases, see below). 19. We take the tartlet tins and wet them with thz paste brush. 20. We cut the paste out with a cutter, a size larger than the tins. The cutter must be floured, or the paste will stick to it. 21. We fix the paste into the tins, and put a dummy in the centre of the tartlet, to prevent the paste rising straight. 22. We put the tins on a baking sheet. 23. We put the baking sheet in a hot oven for six minutes; the thermometer fixed in the oven door should rise to 300° Fahrenheit. 24. When the tartlets are baked sufficiently, we take them out of the oven.

Cooking Meat.—(Entries.)—Croquettes of Chicken. 81 20. We dip the croquettes or rissoles into the egg; and egg them well all over with a paste brush. 21. We now roll them in the bread crumbs, covering them well all over. N.B.—We must be careful to cover them smoothly and not too thickly. 22. We take a frying basket and arrange the croquettes or rissoles in it, but we must finger them as little as possible, and not allow them to touch each other. 23. When the fat on the fire is quite hot and smoking, we put in the frying basket for two minutes or so, to fry them a pale yellow. 24. We put a piece of whitey-brown paper on a plate, and as the rissoles are fried we turn them on to the paper to drain off the grease. 25. For serving we arrange them tastily on a hot dish, with fried parsley in the centre. N.B.—Cold veal or pheasant, &c., might be used for the (rissoles and cro- quettes instead of chicken, if preferred. F1

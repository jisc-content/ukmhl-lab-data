192 National Training School for Cookery. 6. We take an onion, peel it, and stick six cloves in it. 7. We take half a head of celery, wash it, and cut off the green tops of the leaves. 8. We put the onion and celery into the stewpan ; we also add twelve peppercorns, and a bouquet garni, consisting of a sprig of parsley, thyme, marjoram, and a bay-leaf \ all tied tightly together. 9. We should place the lid on the stewpan, and put it over the fire for ten minutes, stirring occasionally. 10. We must now add two quarts of cold water, and a teaspoonful of salt. N.B.â€”If there is any stock that can be used, it would of course im- prove the sovp, then three quarts of it should be used instead of the water. 11. When it boils we must skim it well, and then draw the stewpan to the side of the fire to simmer for two hours. 12. Half-an-hour before the stock is done, we put two ounces of butter into another stewpan. 13. We take one carrot, wash it, scrape it clean with a knife, and cut it up into rounds the size of a shilling. 14. We take a small turnip, wash it, peel it, and cut it up like the carrot. 15. We add these vegetables to the butter, put the stewpan on the fire, and let them cook for ten minutes; we must stir them occasionally, and not allow them to discolour. 16. When the stock is ready, we should take the pieces of ox-tail out, and pour the stock through a strainer into a basin. 17. We put three ounces of flour into the stewpan, with the vegetables and butter, and stir well. 18. We now add the stock to the stewpan, put it over the fire, and stir well until it boils and thickens, then move the stewpan to the side of the fire, and let it simmer until the vegetables are tender: it will take about a quarter of an hour.

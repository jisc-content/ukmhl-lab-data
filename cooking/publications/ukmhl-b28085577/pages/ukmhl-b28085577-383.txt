Lessons on Making Souffles.—Cheese Souffle. 379 10. We take the stewpan off the fire, and stand it on a piece of paper on the table. 11. We add one by one the yolks of tivo eggs, and beat them well together. 12. We take three ounces of Parmesan cheese. 13. We grate the cheese with a grater on to a plate or piece of paper. 14. We add the three oimces of grated cheese to the above mixture in the stewpan, and mix it all well together. 15. We whip the whites of two eggs with a little salt in a basin quite stiff. 16. We add the whites to the above mixture, and stir it lightly. 17. We take a plain tin pint mould\ and prepare it in the same way as we did for the Vanilla Souffle Pudding. (See Souffles, Lesson No. 1.) 18. We pour the mixture into the buttered tin mould. N.B.—This same mixture, if poured into Ramaquin papers and baked, will' make cheese Ramaquins. 19. We put the tin in the oven (the thermometer at'the oven door should rise to 240°) to bake from tzventy mimites to half an hour. We must look at it once or twice to see it does not burn, but the door of the oven should not be opened too often while the souffle is inside, lest it should check the souffle from rising properly. N.B.—To serve a baked souffle it should be kept in its tin, the buttered'1 paper taken off, and a clean napkin folded round the tin. It can also be baked in a mould which slips inside a plated or silver dish sold foE the purpose. This is the more elegant way of serving a souffle or fondu.

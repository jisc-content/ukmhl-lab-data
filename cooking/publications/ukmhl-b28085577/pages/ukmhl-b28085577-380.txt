N.B.—To test if the pudding be done, we should touch the centre of the pudding with our finger ; it should feel firm. 23. We shake the tin and turn the Soitffle Pudding out on a hot dish, and pour the sauce round it, which we must prepare while the soufftd is being steamed. N.B.—If a baked Vanilla Souffle” Pudding is required, we put the tin in a quick oven (the thermometer at the oven door should rise to 240°) to bake for half an hour, instead of putting it in the boiling water. No sauce is then wanted. Now we will make the sauce for the Steamed Vanilla Souffle' Pudding. For Wine Sauce. 1. We take a small saucepan and put in it one ounce of loaf sugar and one gill (or quarter pint) of cold water. 2. We put the saucepan on the fire, and stir the sugar and water with a spoon until the sugar has quite melted, and it has become a smooth syrup reduced in quantity. 3. We put into it a tablespoonful of apricot jam. 4. We stir it all together over the fire to melt the jam. 5. We add a wineglassfid of sherry and half a teaspoonful of lemon juice. We stir it all again. 6. We take the stewpan off the fire and pour the sauce round the souffletpudding. N.B. We must pour the sauce round the pudding very carefully, so as not to drop any of it on the side of it. We can make a Custard Sauce if preferred : 1. We break a whole egg in a basin and whip it well. 2. We add half a teaspoonfid of pounded sugar. 3. We add one gill (quarter pint) of milk, and six drops of Vanilla essence. 4. We pour all the mixture into a jug or gallipot. 5. We get a large saucepan of hot water and put it on the fire.

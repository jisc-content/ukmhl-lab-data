32 National Training School for Cookery. 8. We put a quarter of a pound of flour into a basin, and mix into it a few grains of salt, and a quarter of a teaspoonful of baking powder. 9. We take one ounce of clarified dripping and rub it well and lightly into the flour with our hands, until it resembles sifted bread crumbs. 10. We now add to it sufficient water to mix it into a stiff paste. 11. We flour a board and turn the paste out on it. 12. We take a rolling-pin, flour it, and roll out the paste to the shape of the pie dish, only a little larger, and to about a quarter of an inch in thickness. 13. We wet the edge of the pie dish with water. 14. We take a knife, dip it in flotir, and cut a strip of the paste, the width of the edge of the pie dish, and place it round the edge of the dish. 15. We should cut this strip of paste from round the edge of the paste, leaving the centre piece rather larger than the top of the pie dish. 16. We wet the edge of the paste with water. 17. We take the remaining piece of paste, and place it over the pie dish, pressing the edges together with our thumb. N.B.—We must be very careful not to break the paste. 18. We take a knife, dip it in flour, and trim off all the rough edges of thepaste, round the edge of the dish. 19. We take a knife, and with the back of the blade we make little notches in the edge of the paste, pressing the paste firmly with our thumb, to keep it in its proper place. 20. We make a little hole with the knife, in the centre of the pie to let the steam out while the pie is baking. 21. We put the pie into the oven (the heat should rise to 220°), to bake for half an hour. It is then ready for serving

INGREDIENTS. d. 1 teaspoonful of cornflour o£ J pint of milk of 4 lumps of sugar o% 1 egg 1 Time required, about three quarters of an hour. Now we will show you how to make a Cornflour Pudding (in a cup, for infants or invalids). 1. We put a saucepan half full of warm water on the fire to boil. 2. We put one teaspoonful of cornflour into a sauce- pan. 3. We pour in by degrees a quarter of a pint of milk, mixing it very smoothly. N.B.—We must be careful that it does not get lumpy. 4. We now add to it four lumps of sugar, put the sauce- pan on the fire and stir smoothly until it boils; it will take about ten minutes. 5. We then move the saucepan to the side of the fire. 6. We break one egg into the saucepan, and beat it up until it is all well mixed. N.B.—If liked, the pudding can be flavoured with essence of vanilla, about five drops should be added. 7. We take a cup (just large enough to hold the pudding), and grease it inside with a piece of butter. 8. We pour the mixture out of the saucepan into the cup.

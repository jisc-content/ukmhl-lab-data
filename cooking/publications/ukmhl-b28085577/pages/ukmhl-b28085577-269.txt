Carrots, 6 young 3^., or 4 old ) 1 tablespoonful of salt J 4 4 Now we will show you how to boil Carrots. 1. We put tivo quarts of warm water into a saucepan with one good tablespoonful of salt, and put it on the fire to boil. 2. We take the carrots and cut off the green tops and wash the carrots well in cold water. 3. We scrape the carrots clean with a sharp knife, and carefully remove any black specks. 4. If the carrots are very large we cut them in halves and quarters. 5. When the water in the saucepan is quite boiling, we put in the carrots and let them boil until they are tender. N.B.—Young carrots need not be cut up, nor do they take so long to boil as old ones. 6. For serving we turn the carrots into a colander to drain, and then put them on a hot dish.

N.B.—If the soup is required to be made in one day, the stock should be made early in the morning, so as to give time for it to get cold to have the fat removed. N.B.—If liked, the calf's head could be served the previous day (see Calf's head rolled and boiled), and this soup be made with the calf’s head stock, and the remains of the calf’s head will be sufficient to cut up and put in the soup. In this case we commence this lesson from paragraph 7. Now we will show you how to make Mock Turtle Soup. 1. We take half a calf's head, and wash it well in water, to remove all blood and impurities. 2. We cut all the flesh from the bones, and tie the flesh up in a very clean cloth or napkin. 3. We put it in a large stewpan with the bones and four quarts of cold water, and half a tablespoonful of salt. 4. We put the stewpan on the fire, and let it come to the boil. s. d. 5 o o 3 o 3 o oj o 4 o 5\ o 8 o 1 o 4i

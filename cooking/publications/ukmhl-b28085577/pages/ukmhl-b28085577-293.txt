Lessons on Making Pastry.—Short Crust. 289 5. We cut a strip of the paste the width of the edge of the pie dishy and place it round the edge of the dish. 6. We take the paste brush again and wet the edge of the paste with water or white of egg. 7. We take the remaining paste and lay it over the pie dishy pressing it down with our thumb all round the edge. 8. We must be very careful not to break the paste. 9. We take a knife and trim off all the rough edges of the paste round the edge of the dish. 10. We take a knife, and with the back of the blade we make little notches in the edge of the paste, pressing the paste firmly with our thumb to keep it in its proper place. 11. We make a little hole in the paste of the tarty to let out the steam. 12. We take the paste brush and wet the tart all over with water. 13. We sprinkle some pounded loaf sugar over the tarty this is to glaze it. 14. We now put the tart into a hot oven (the thermo- meter at the oven door should rise to 240°) for half an houry or three quarters of an hour, according to the size of the tart. We must watch it occasionally and turn it, to prevent its burning; it should become a pale brown. It is then ready for serving, either hot or cold according to taste. N.B.—If a better crust is required for apple turnovers, &c„ see "Pastry," Lesson No. a. T

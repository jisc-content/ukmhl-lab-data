Cooking Poultry.—Trussing Boiled Fowl. 165 15. We now add one gill of cream to the sauce. 16. We move the stewpan to the centre of the fire, and stir well till it boils again. N.B.—We must be careful in stirring not to break the pieces of egg. 17. When the fowl is sufficiently boiled we take it out of the saucepan ; we take off the buttered paper, and place the fowl on a hot dish. 18. We take a knife and cut the twine, and draw it all out of the fowl. 19. We take the stewpan off the fire and pour the sauce over the fowl. 20. We take a wire sieve with the hard boiled yolks of the eggs, place it over the fowl’ and rub the yolks through on to the breast. It is then ready for serving. N.B.—The neck, gizzard, liver, heart, and claws of the fowl (namely the Giblets), should be put aside, and when properly prepared can be used for soup (see “Soups,” Lesson No.. 6), or should be put in the stock pot. N.B.—To clean and prepare the giblets for use. A. We take the gizzard, cut it very carefully with a knife down the centre, where there is a sort of seam (we must be sure only to cut the first or outer skin), and draw off the outer skin without breaking the inside, which should be thrown away. B. We take the outer skin of the gizzard, the heart, and liver, wash them well in water, and dry them in a cloth. C. We take the neck, cut off the head, which is of no use, draw the skin off the neck, and wash the latter well in water, so as to remove the blood and any impurities. D. We put the claws and ends of legs in a basin of boiling water for some minutes, then take a knife, cut off the nails, and draw off the outer skin, which can be pulled off like a glove.

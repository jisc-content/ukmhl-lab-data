N.B.—Fillets of plaice or whiting could be cooked in this way. 1. We take one sole and fillet it in the same way as for fried fillets (see “Fish,” Lesson No. 6). 2. We take the bones and fins of the sole, put them into a stewpan with half a pint of water, and put it on the fire to boil. 3. We take a flat tin pan and butter it with our fingers. 4. We fold the fillets loosely over and lay them in the buttered tin. 5. We sprinkle a quarter of a saltspoonful of salt over the fillets and squeeze six drops of lemon juice, and cover them with a piece of buttered paper. 6. We put the tin with the fillets into a sharp oven for six minutes. Now we will make the Sauce. N.B.—If there be no cream, the sauce can be made with milk ; the bones of the fish should therefore be boiled in half a pint of milk instead of water.

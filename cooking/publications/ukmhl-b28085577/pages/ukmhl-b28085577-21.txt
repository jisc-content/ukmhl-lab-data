LESSONS ON COOKERY. ROASTING. Now we will show you how to roast meat at an open range, but first we must see that the fire is clear and bright. 1. We must take the shovel and put it in at the back of the fire and push all the red hot coals to the front. 2. We put fresh coal at the back, packing it together rather closely, but taking care that we leave a draught at the back, to draw the fire and make it burn clear and bright. 3. We must fill in all the spaces in the front of the fire with small lumps of coal or coke. N.B.—If it be a close range with which we are dealing, we should pull out the centre damper only, which will create a draught at the back, and help to draw the fire up quickly. 4. We now take our joint, say a leg of mutton. 5. We must see that it is quite clean, and, if necessary, we must scrape it with a knife and wipe it over with a clean cloth. N.B.—Meat should not, as a rule, be washed in water, as it takes some of the goodness out. If meat has been kept some time and is not quite fresh, then you might wash it with a little vinegar and water, but it must be well wiped afterwards. 6. We take the leg of mutton and with a sharp knife cut off the knuckle bone. N.B.—The knuckle lone we put aside ; it can be used with beef for leeftea, or be put in the stockpot, or the trimmings and one pint of water will make gravy for the joint when done, allowing it to simmer while the joint is roasting.

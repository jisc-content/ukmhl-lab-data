78 National Training School for Cookery. 11. We put the stewpan on a quick fire to fry the cutlets a nice brown. 12. We must watch and turn the cutlets when they have become a light brown, so as to fry them the same colour -on both sides:—We then remove the cutlets from the stew- pan. 13. We should pour off the grease from the stewpan (and leave the onion), and then add one tablespoonful of flour, and pour in by degrees one pint of second stock, and stir well until it boils. 14. We strain this sauce, and return the cutlets with the sauce into the stewpan. 15. We take one carrot, wash it, and scrape it clean with a knife, and cut it in the shape of young carrots, or into fancy shapes with a cutter. 16. We take one turnip, peel it, and cut it in very small dice. 17. We take one dozen button onions and peel them very carefully, so as not to break them in pieces. 18. We put the stewpan on the fire and let the meat stew gently for half an hour, then add the prepared vege- tables, and let all simmer for half an hour. 19. After that time we should take a fork and feel if the vegetables are quite tender. 20. For serving we arrange the cutlets in a circle on a hot dish with the vegetables in the centre ; we remove all grease from the sauce and pour it round. N.B.—The scrag end of the neck of mutton might be used instead of the best end, but care should be taken in cleansing it before use.

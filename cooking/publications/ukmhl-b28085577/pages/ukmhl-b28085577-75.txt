Cooking Meat.-—{Entries.) Fricassee of Chicken. 71 let the sauce reduce to about one pint, and then add one gill of cream. 25. We take the pieces of chicken and put them in another stewpan, with the two dozen of button mushrooms. 28. When the sauce is sufficiently reduced, we strain it over the chicken. 27. We then stand the stewpan in a saucepan of hot water over the fire until the chicken is quite hot. 28. For serving, we arrange the fricassee of chicken on a hot dish, with fried bread (as described in “ Vegetables,” Lesson No. 8, Note 13 to Note 17). Now we will show you how to make a Fricassee of Cold Chicken. 1. We take some cold roast or boiled chicken. 2. We cut the chicken up into neat pieces, and take away the skin. 3. We put one pint of good white stock (see “ Lesson on Stock ”), and the chicken bones into a stewpan. 4. We take half a carrot, wash and scrape it clean, and cut it into slices. 5. We take a quarter of an onion and peel it. 6. We take half a stick of celery and wash it in cold water. 7. We put these vegetables into the stewpan. 8. We add to them a bouquet garni (consisting of a sprig of parsley, one sprig of thyme, and one bay leaf tied tightly together), one clove, three peppercorns, and half a blade of mace. 9. We put the stewpan on the fire and let it boil for twenty minutes. 10. After that time we strain the stock into a basin.

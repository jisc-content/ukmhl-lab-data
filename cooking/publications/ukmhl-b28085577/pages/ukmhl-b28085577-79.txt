Now we will show you how to make an Irish Stew. 1. We take the best end of the neck of mutton and cut and trim the cutlets in the same way as for “haricot mutton” (see “Entrees,” Lesson No. io, from Note I to Note 8). 2. We place the cutlets in a stewpan. S. We sprinkle over them a teaspoonful of salt and a saltspoonful of pepper, and pour in one and a half pint of cold water. 4. We put the stewpan on the fire, and when it has come to the boil we should skim it. 5. We now draw the stewpan to the side of the fire, and let it simmer gently for one hour. 6. We must watch it and skim it occasionally and re- move all fat. 7. We take half a dozen of potatoes, wash, scrub them, and peel them. 8. We cut these potatoes in halves. 9. We take one dozen of button onions, or two moderate- sized ones, and peel them carefully.

INGREDIENTS. d. i lb. of Potatoes ) Salt j 1 The use of i| lb. of clarified fat or lard for frying. Time required, about eight mimites for either. Now we will show you how to dress Potatoes. For Potato Chips— 1. We wash the potatoes well in cold water, and scrut> them clean with a scrubbing-brush. 2. We take a sharp knife, peel them, and carefully cut out the eyes and any black specks about them. 3. We must now peel the potatoes very thinly in ribbons, and twist them into fancy shapes. 4. We take a saucepan and put in it one pound and a half of clarified fat or lard. 5. We put the saucepan on the fire to heat the fat. We must test the heat of it with a piece of bread (see Lesson on “Frying”). 6. We take a frying-basket and put the ribbons of potato' in it. 7. When the fat is quite hot we put in the frying-basket with the potatoes for about six minutes. 8. We place a piece of whitey-brown paper on a plate. 9. When the chips are done, they should be quite crisp and of a pale brown colour. We turn them out on to the paper, to drain off the grease, and sprinkle over them a little salt. 10. We serve them on a hot dish.

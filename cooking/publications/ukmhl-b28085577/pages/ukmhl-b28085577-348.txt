344 National Training School for Cookery. 7. We take about a pint basin, butter it inside, and turn the mixture into it, but the basin must be quite full. 8. We take a small pudding cloth, wring it out in warm water, and then in cold water, and sprinkle some flour over it, we put this cloth over the top of the basin, and tie it on tightly with a piece of string under the rim of the basin ; we tie the four corners of the cloth together over the top of the pudding. 9. When the water in the saucepan is quite boiling, we put in the pudding and let it boil for three hours. N.B.—The lid should be on the saucepan. N.B.—We should keep a kettle of water boiling on the fire, and fill up the saucepan, as the water in it boils away. 10. For serving we take the basin out of the saucepan, take off the cloth, and turn the pudding carefully out of the basin on to a hot dish.

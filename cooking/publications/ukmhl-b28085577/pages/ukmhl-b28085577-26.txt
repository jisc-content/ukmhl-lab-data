22 National Training School for Cookery. BAKING. Meat, Bread, Pastry, &c. Now we will show you how to bake meat. 1. We must have a good fire, and keep it up, adding by degrees small pieces of coal, as the oven is required to be very hot. N.B.—If it be a close range with which we are dealing, we should pull out the damper placed over the oven in order to draw all the heat of the fira towards the oven. The ventilator of the oven should be closed. N.B.—In kitchen stoves there is usually either a handle at the top of the oven, to be pulled out for opening the ventilator, or a slide ventilator at the bottom. 2. We should test the heat of the oven by the thermometer which is fixed in the door of the oven, the heat should rise to 240° Fahrenheit. 3. We take the joint, see that it is clean, as directed in “ Lesson on Roasting/’ Note 5, and weigh it, so as to find out how long it will take to bake, as ten minutes are allowed for each pound of weight. N.B.—When we have a joint without lone we must allow about fifteen minutes to each pound of weight, as it is solid meat. 4. We take the hot water tin, on which the stand for the meat is placed, lift up the upper tin or tray and fill the under tin half full of warm water, we then fit on the upper tin. N.B.—In one corner of the upper tin is a small hole or escape for the steam. The water below must only just reach this hole, and not come into it. N.B.—The water is placed in the tin to prevent the tin and the meat from getting burnt, and so causing a disagreeable smell. 5. We place the stand on the hot water tin to raise the joint and prevent it from standing in its own dripping, which would sodden and spoil the meat. 6. We now take the joint, which weighs say seven pounds (it will therefore take one hour and ten minutes to bake), and put it on the stand. We should dredge four over it. 7. We put the tin with the meat in the oven. The oven should be kept very hot for the first five minutes, in order to

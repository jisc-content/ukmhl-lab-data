138 National Training School for Cookery. 8. We add a good saltspoonful of salt, and 4 peppercorns. N.B.—If liked, one ounce of pearl barley, previously washed, may be now added. 9. We put the saucepan on the fire, and let it boil very gently for 1 hour. 10. We must watch it and skim it occasionally with a spoon, removing as much of the fat as possible. 11. We take two turnips, wash them in cold water, peel them, and cut them in quarters with a sharp knife. 12. We take a carrot, scrape it clean with a knife, and cut it in pieces. 13. We take a good-sized onion, peel it, and cut it in quarters. 14. We take half a small head of celery, and two sprigs of parsley, and wash them in cold water. 15. When the sheep's head has boiled for an hour, we should add all these vegetables. 16. We take one ounce of rice, wash it well in cold water, and add it to the saucepan. 17. We also add one sprig of thyme. 18. We now move the saucepan to the side of the fire and let it simmer gently for one hour and a half. N.B.—The lid should be on the saucepan. 19. Half an hour before the sheep's head is finished, we wash the brains well in cold water (removing all the skin). 20. We tie the brains up in a piece of muslin and put them in the saucepan with the head, to boil for ten mhmtes. 21. We put one ounce of clarified dripping, or half an ounce of butter, into a small saucepan. 22. We put the saucepan on the fire to melt the drip- ping, and then add half an ounce of flour and mix them well together with a spoon. 23. We take 07iegill (a quarter of a pint) of broth from the saucepan in which the head is boiling, and add it by degrees to the sauce, stirring it as smoothly as possible until it boils and thickens. 24. We now move the saucepan to the side of the fire.

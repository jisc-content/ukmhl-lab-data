INGREDIENTS. d. 1 pound of apples 4 1 lemon i| 3 oz. of lump sugar 1' I oz. of gelatine 3 J a teaspoonful of cochineal 1 io| Time required, about one hour. Now we will show you how to make Apple Jelly. 1. We take one pound of apples, peel them with a sharp knife, cut them in half, take out the core, and then cut the apples in small pieces. 2. We put the apples in a stewpan with three ounces of lump sugar and half a pint of water. 3. We take a lemon, wipe it clean with a cloth. 4. We take a grater and grate the rind of the lemon over the apples. N.B.—We should be very careful only to grate the yellow peel of the lemon, as the white rind is very bitter. 5. We cut the lemon in half, and squeeze the juice through a strainer on the apples. 6. We put the stewpan on the fire to boil, and cook the apples quite tender. 7. We must stir the apples occasionally to prevent it sticking to the bottom of the pan and burning. 8. We put one ounce of gelatine in a gallipot or small saucepan with half a gill {one gill is a quarter of a pint) of cold water, and stand it by the side of the fire to dissolve.

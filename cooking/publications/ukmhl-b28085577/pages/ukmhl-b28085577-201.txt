INGREDIENTS. 1 cabbage 2 oz. of butter f of a pint of milk Pepper and salt A slice of bread 6| Time required, about one hour and a quarter. Now we will show you how to make Cabbage Soup. 1. We put three pints of water into a saucepan, and put it on the fire to boil. 2. We take a good sized cabbage, wash it well in cold water, and trim off the outside dead leaves. 3. We cut the cabbage up, but not into very small pieces. 4. When the water in the saucepan is quite boiling, we put in the cabbage, and let it boil for five minutes. N.B.—This is to blanch it. 5. We now pour off the water from the cabbage. 6. We add to the cabbage, two quarts of water, two ounces of butter, and pepper and salt for seasoning, and let it boil for one hour. 7. After that time, we pour in three quarters of a pint of milk, and let it boil up. 8. We take a slice of bread, stick it on a toasting fork, and toast it slightly on both sides in front of the fire. 9. We cut the toasted bread up in pieces, the size of dice, and put them into a hot soup tureen or basin. 10. We pour the cabbage soup on to the bread in the soup tureen, and it is ready for serving.

INGREDIENTS. d. 2 lemons 3 Loaf sugar o£ 35 Time required, about one hour. Now we will show you how to make Lemonade. 1. We put a kettle of water on the fire to boil. 2. We take two lemonsy wipe them clean in a cloth, and peel them very thinly. N.B.—We should be careful, in peeling the lemons, not to cut any of the pith, or white skin, as it would make the lemonade bitter. 3. We now cut off all the pith. 4. We cut up the lemons into thin slices, take out all the pips, and put the slices and half the rind of the lemons into a jug. 5. We add loaf sugar, according to taste, about one ounce. 6. When the water is quite boiling, we pour one pint and a half on. to the lemons in the jug. 7. We cover over the jug, and stand it aside to cool. 8. When the lemonade is quite cold, we strain it into another jug, and it is then ready for use.

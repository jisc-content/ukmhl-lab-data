INGREDIENTS. 6 eggs }. 07.. of flour d. o\ 1 oz. of butter 4 3 ozs. castor sugar 7% Time required, about half an hour. Now we will show you how to make an Omelette Soufflee. 1. We take six eggs, put four yolks in a basin (the other two yolks are not required for present use), and put the whites of the six eggs in another basin. 2. We add three ounces of castor sugar to the yolks of the eggs, and beat them up well with a wooden spoon, for ten minutes. 3. We now stir in smoothly half an ounce of flour. N.B.—If the soufflee is to be flavoured, the flavouring should now be added, about fifteen drops of vanilla, or any other essence preferred. 4. We take a whisk, and whip the whites of the eggs to a stiff froth, and then stir them lightly into the contents, in the other basin. 5. We take half an ounce of butter and butter the inside of a half-pint pie dish or soufflee tin ; we then pour in the mixture. N.B.—If jam is added it must be put in the centre of the soufflie, before it is baked. 6. We put it in a quick oven (the thermometer at the door of the oven marking 240°) to bake for ten minutes. 7. We must serve the soufflee as soon as it is baked, or it will fall.

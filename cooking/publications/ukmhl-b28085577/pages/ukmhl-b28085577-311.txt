Now we will show you how to make an Amber Pudding. 1. We take six large apples, peel them, cut out the core, and cut them up into slices. 2. We put the apples into a stewpan with three ounces of moist sugar, and two ounces of butter. 3. We take a lemon, wipe it clean with a cloth, and peel it as thinly as possible with a sharp knife. 4. We cut the lemon in half and squeeze the juice through a strainer into the stewpan. 5. We also add the lemon peel. 6. We put the stewpan on the fire and let it stew till the apples are quite tender (it will take about three-quarters oj an hour). 7. We place a hair sieve over a large basin. 8. When the apples are sufficiently stewed, we pour them on to the sieve and rub them through into the basin with a wooden spoon. 9. We stir the yolks of three eggs into the basin.

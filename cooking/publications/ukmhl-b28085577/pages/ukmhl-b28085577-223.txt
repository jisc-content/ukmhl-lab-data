Lessons on Cooking Fish.—Sole cm Gratin. 219 11. We take them out of the water, dry them in a cloth and peel them. 12. We chop them up finely. 13. We take a dish, and spread a little butter on it with our fingers. 14. We sprinkle half of the chopped parsley, shalot, mushroom over the bottom of the buttered dish. 15. We pour half a teaspoonfid of lemon juice over the chopped parsley, shalot, and mushroom in the dish, also sprinkle half a salt spoonful of salt and <2 quarter of a salt- spoonful of pepper. 16. We lay the sole carefully in the dish, and sprinkle over it the remainder of the chopped parsley, shalot, and mushroom. 17. We sprinkle over the sole pepper and salt (enough to cover a threepenny piece), and squeeze over it half a tea- spoonfid of lemon juice. 18. We take half an ounce of bidter and cut it in small pieces and put them over the sole. 19. We pour over it two tablespoonsful of glaze. N.B.—Glaze can be bought, or it can be made by reducing some strong stock over the fire (see “Stews,” Lesson No 4, Note 12). 20. We take a wire sieve and put it over a piece of paper. 21. We take some crumb of bread and rub it through the sieve. 22. We take these bread crumbs and put them on a flat tin. We put this tin into the oven to dry, and slightly brown, the bread crumbs. 23. When the crumbs are done we sift them over the sole. 24. We now put the dish into a brisk oven for ten minutes. We must take a fork and feel in the thick part of the sole if the fish is tender. 25. We carefully move the sole with a slice on to a clean clish, and pour the sauce round. It is then ready for serving.

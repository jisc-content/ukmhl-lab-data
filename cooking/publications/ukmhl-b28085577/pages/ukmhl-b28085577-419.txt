Now we will show you how to make Short-Bread. 1. We put two ounces of butter in a Saucepan, and put it on the fire to melt and warm. 2. We put a quarter of a pound of flour into a basin with one ounce of castor (pounded lump) sugar, and the melted butter. 3. We mix these ingredients well together. 4. We flour a board and turn the paste out on it. 5. We flour our hands and knead the paste well. 6. We take a rolling pin, flour it, and roll out the paste to about one-third of an inch in thickness. 7. We flour a knife and cut the paste into oval shapes. 8. We grease a baking tin with dripping or butter. 9. We put the short-bread on the tin, and put it in the oven (the thermometer at the oven door should rise to 240°) to bake till a pale brown. We should then take out the tin and set the short-bread aside to cool ; it is then ready for serving.

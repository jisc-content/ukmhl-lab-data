We also put into the saucepan one carrot, which has been scraped, a small onion, which has been peeled, and a bouquet of herbs for flavouring. 26. The fowl will take from tlwee-quarters of an hour to one hour to boil, according to its size. N.B.—We must not allow it to boil fast, only to sivimer. The saucepan should be at the side of the fire. Now we must make the Egg Sauce to be served with the boiled fowl. N.B.—If liked, the eggs can be omitted, and only plain white sauce poured over the fowl for serving. 1. We take a small saucepan full of hot water, and put it on the fire to boil. 2. When the water is quite boiling, we put in two eggs to boil for ten minutes. 3. We take a stewpan and put in it one ounce of butter and one ounce of flour. 4. We mix them well together with a wooden spoon. 5. We pour in half a pint of milk. 6. We put the stewpan on the fire, and stir the mixture with a wooden spoon until it boils and thickens. 7. We must then remove the stewpan to the side of the fire until required for use. 8. When the eggs are sufficiently boiled, we take them carefully out of the saucepan with a spoon. 9. We take the eggs and knock them against the edge of a basin to break off all the shell. 10. We take a small basin of cold water. 11. We cut the eggs in half and take out the yolks. 12. We put the whites into cold water to prevent theit turning yellow. 13. We take the whites of the eggs out of the water and cut them to the shape of small dice. 14. We add the pieces of white of egg to the sauce in the stewpan.

N.B.—The chopped veal acts as a filter to the jelly. 46. After the jelly has all passed through, we remove the basin, and put a clean one in its place. 47. We take a soup ladle, and pour a ladle-ful of the jelly, at a time, over the meat in the cloth, and let it pass for the second time, very slowly, into the basin. N.B.—We must be careful not to disturb the deposit of chopped veal, which settles at the bottom of the cloth. 48. If a border mould of Aspic jelly be required, we take the mould, scald it with boiling water, and then rinse it in cold water. N.B.—If the Aspic jelly is only required for garnishing cold meats, &c., we stand the basin of j elly on ice, or in a cool place, until it be firmly set; we can then cut the jelly into fancy shapes, or chop it up finely with a knife. 49. We place the mould in ice. N.B.—We must be careful that the mould stands quite straight and firm. 50. We pour in enough of the jelly just to cover the bottom of the mould. 51. When this jelly has slightly set, we can garnish the mould with fish or vegetables, &c., according to taste, or with what it is to be served. 52. We then pour the remainder of the jelly into the mould, and let it stand in the ice until it is firmly set. 53. When the jelly is required for use, we dip the mould into a basin of hot water for about a second. 54. We shake the mould to loosen the jelly, and place a dish over the top of the mould, and turn the jelly carefully out, so as not to break it. It is then ready for serving. N.B.—The centre of the mould can be filled with a salad of mixed vegetables. (See No. 13 in Entries, Lesson No. 5.) N.B.—A less expensive recipe for Aspic Jelly will be found in the Appendix.

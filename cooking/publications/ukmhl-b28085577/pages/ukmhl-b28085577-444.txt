Time required, about one hoitr and ten minutes. Now we will show you how to make Beef Tea. 1. We take one pound of gravy beef put it on a board and cut it up very fine, removing all the skin and fat. 2. We put the meat into a saucepan with one quart of cold water, half a saltspoonful of salti and two or three pep- percorns, if allowed. 3. We put the saucepan on the fire, and just bring it to the boil. 4. We then move it to the side of the fire to simmer gently for one hour. N.B.—The lid should be on the saucepan. 5. After that time we pour off the beef tea and let it get cold. 6. We should remove all fat from the beef tea before warming it up for use. N.B.—Fat can be taken off hot beef tea with blotting paper or whitey-brown paper. N.B.—It is better not to strain beef tea, as it removes all the little brown particles which are most nutritious.

INGREDIENTS \ lb. of Maccaroni Salt 1 quart of skimmed milk 2 oz. of cheese 1 oz. of butter Salt and pepper, and cayenne pepper d. Time required, about one hour and three-quarters. Now we will show you how to cook Maccaroni. 1. We put a saucepan of hot water on the fire to boil. 2. We take half a pound of maccaroni, and put it in the saucepan of boiling water, with one tablespoonful of salt, and let it boil gently for half an hour. 3. After that time we pour the water out of the sauce- pan. 4. We put one quart of skimmed milk into the saucepan. 5. We put the saucepan on the fire, just bring it to the boil, and then move it to the side of the fire and let it simmer gently for one hour. 6. When the maccaroni is sufficiently cooked and quite tender, we turn it out on a hot dish, and it can be eaten with sugar or treacle. N.B.—If liked, maccaroni and cheese can be made of it. 7. For maccaroni and cheese, we take two ounces of cheese, and grate it with a grater on to a piece of paper. 8. We take a dish or a tin and grease it well inside with a piece of dripping or butter. 9. When the maccaroni is sufficiently cooked (as above) we turn it out of the saucepan on to the greased dish.

Now we will show you how to make Oatmeal Biscuits. 1. We put three ounces of lard or butter into a saucepan* and put it on the fire to melt and warm. 2. We put seven ounces of flour into a basin with three ounces of oatmeal three ounces of castor sugar, and a quarter of a teaspoonful of carbonate of soda, and mix all toge- ther with a spoon. 3. We now stir in the melted lard. 4. We put about a tablespoonful of cold water into a tea cup; we break one egg into the water and beat them slightly together. 5. We add this to the mixture in the basin, and mix all well and smoothly together with a spoon. 6. We flour a board and turn the paste out on it. 7. We take a rolling pin, flour it, and roll out the paste as thin as possible. 8. We flour a tumbler and cut the paste into biscuits according to taste. 9. We grease a baking tin with dripping or butter, and place the biscuits on it. 10. We put the tin into the oven (the thermometer at the oven door should rise to 240°) to bake for twenty minutes. 11. After that time we turn the biscuits off the tin, and set them aside to cool; they are then ready for serving.

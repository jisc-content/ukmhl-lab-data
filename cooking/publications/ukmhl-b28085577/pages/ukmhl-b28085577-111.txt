Lessons on Cooking Meat.—Tripe a la Coutance. 107 6. We take the half pound of bacon and cut it in very thin slices, the same size as the strips of tripe. 7. We take one shalot, peel it, and two or three sprigs of parsley, and chop them up finely on a board. 8. We lay one slice of bacon on each strip of tripey sprinkle a little chopped shalot and parsley over each slice of bacon, roll them up together, and tie them firmly round with a piece of string. 9. We take the carrot, wash it, scrape it clean with a knife, and cut it in slices. 10. We take the half onion and the other shalot, peel them, and cut them in slices. 11. We take a sprig of marjoram, thyme, and a bay-leaf \ and tie them tightly together with a piece of string. 12. We take the mushrooms, wash them, and cut off the end of the stalks. 13. We arrange the rolls of tripe and bacon in a stewpan. 14. We also add all the vegetables and the herbs. 15. We pour in a pint of stock, and put the stewpan on the fire. 16. When it just boils we remove the stewpan to the side of the fire, and let the contents simmer gently for two hours. 17. After that time we take out the rolls of tripe and put them on a plate. 18. We take a strainer, hold it over a basin, and strain the stock. 19. We put two ounces of butter into another stewpan,. and put it on the fire to melt. 20. When the butter is melted we add to it one ounce of floury and mix them smoothly together. 21. We now add the stocky and stir it over the fire until it boils and thickens. 22. We take half a lemon and squeeze the juice of it into the sauce. N.B.—We must be careful not to let any pips fall in.

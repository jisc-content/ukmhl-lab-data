Lessons on Cooking Meat.—Pork Pie. 131 11. We dip the pieces of pork into cold water, then season them well with pepper and salt. 12. We should put these pieces inside the mould of paste as close together as possible. N.B.—The pie can be flavoured, if liked, with chopped sage, about a tea- spoonful sprinkled well amongst the pieces of pork. 13. We take the remainder of the paste and roll it out (with a floured rolling pin), and cut it to the size of the top of the mould and to about the thickness of one-third of an inch. 14. We take an egg and break it into two cups, dividing the yolk from the white. 15. We take a paste brush, dip it into the white of egg, and egg the edge of the mould of paste. 16. We take the piece of paste and put it over the top of the pie, pressing the edges together with our thumb. 17. We cut little leaves out of the remaining paste, dip them in the white of the egg, and stick them on the top of the pie. 18. We wet the pie all over with the folk of egg. 19. We put the pie in a moderate oven to bake for two hours. After that time it is ready for serving.

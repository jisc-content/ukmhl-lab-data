Now we will show you how to lard and braise liver. 1. We take two ounces of fat bacon, put it on a board, and cut it into strips one inch long, and one eighth of an inch in width and thickness. 2. We take a larding needle with a little strip of bacon in it, and lard half a pound of sheep's liver neatly, in regular rows, until one side is entirely covered with strips of bacon. 3. We put two ounces of butter and the larded liver into a stewpan, put it over the fire, and fry the liver brown ; we must be careful not to burn it. 4. We now take out the liver,; and put it on a plate. 5. We stir smoothly into the butter; in the stewpan, one ounce of flour, and pour in one pint of stock or water, place the stewpan over the fire, and stir well till it boils and thickens, then move it to the side of the fire. 6. We take a carrot, wash it, scrape it clean with a knife, and cut it in half. 7. We take an onion or one dozen button onions, wash them, and peel them carefully. 8. We add these vegetables, and the liver to the stewpan, and season with pepper and salt, to taste ; we also add a bouquet garni, consisting of a sprig of thyme, parsley, and a bay leaf, tied tightly together.

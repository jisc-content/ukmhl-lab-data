Cooking Meat.—('Entries.) Braised Fillets of Beef. 61 9. We take two young carrots, scrape them clean with a knife, and cut them in halves. 10. We take an onion and peel it carefully. 11. We add these vegetables and a quarter of a stick of celery to the fillets in the saute-pan. 12. We now pour in a pi?it of good stock, put the saute- pan on the fire, and baste the fillets continually. N.B.—The stock must not cover the meat. 13. We take a piece of kitchen paper, and cut a round to the size of the saute-pan and butter it. 14. As soon as the stock boils, we lay this round of paper on the fillets in the saute-pan. N.B.—This paper is to prevent the meat browning too quickly. 15. We must lift the paper every now and then, when we require to baste the fillets. 16. We should put the saute-pan into a very hot oven, to brown the fillets. 17. We let the pint of stock reduce to a half glaze, which will take about half an hour. 18. We must watch it, frequently raise the paper, and baste the fillets with the stock. N.B.—If the fillets are not brown enough, we take a salamander and heat it in the fire. 19. We hold the salamander over the fillets, to brown them a nice colour. 20. We take the fillets carefully out of the saute-pan, and arrange them on a hot dish in a circle, on a border of mashed potatoes. (See “Vegetables,” Lesson No. 2.) N.B.—We must stand this dish on the hot plate, or near the fire, to keep warm until the sauce is ready. N.B.—The centre of the dish may be filled in with mixed vegetables, i.e., peas and beans, which should be cut in the shape of dice, carrots and turnips cut with a cutter, to the size of the peas. 21. We put the saute-pan on the fire, and let the sauce reduce to a half glaze. 22. We then strain the glaze round the meat and it is ready for serving.

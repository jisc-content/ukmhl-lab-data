INGREDIENTS. d. 1 tablespoonful of flour ) L 5 lb. of ground rice ) 12 \ lb. of sugar i 2 oz. of butter 2 2 eggs 2 ^ a teaspoonful of baking powder o;j Time requ ired, half an hotir. Now we will show you how to make Rice Buns. 1. We put a quarter of a pound of ground rice and a tablespoonful of flour into a basin, with half a teaspoonful of baking powder. 2. We add a quarter of a pound of pounded loaf sugar, and two ounces of butter, and mix all together with a wooden spoon. 3. We break in two eggs and beat all lightly together. N.B.—We should be careful to see that the eggs are good before adding them to the mixture. 4. We take some small tins or patty pans, and grease them well with a piece of dripping or butter. 5. We fill these tins iivo-thirds full with the mixture. N.B.—This quantity will make about eight or ten buns. N.B.—If there are no small tins, the mixture could be put into a cake tin, which should be previously greased inside. 6. We put the tins into the oven (the thermometer at the oven door should rise to 240°) to bake for fifteen minutes. 7. After that time, we turn the buns out of the tins, and lean them against a plate until they are cold. They are then ready for serving. N.B.—This will prevent their getting heavy.

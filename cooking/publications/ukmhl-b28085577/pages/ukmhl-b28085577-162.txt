Now we will show you how to cook Calf s-head. 1. We put the half head on a board, take a sharp knife, and commence from the lip, keep the knife close to the bone, and carefully remove the flesh in one piece. We cut out the longue and the brains, and put them aside. 2. We put the head and bones in cold water, while we make the forcemeat. 3. We take three ounces of beef suet, put it on a board, cut away all skin, and chop it up very finely with a knife. 4. We place a wire sieve over a piece of paper, take some crumb of bread and rub it through the sieve. We weigh out six ounces of bread crumbs, the rest we put aside for further use. 5. We put a small sprig of thyme, of basil, of marjoram and of parsley, on a board, take away the stalks, and chop the herbs up very finely. (There should be a tablespoonful.) 6. We put the suet, bread crumbs, and mixed herbs into a basin, we also add about half a teaspoonful of grated lemon rind, season it with pepper, and salt to taste, break in one egg, and mix all well together with a wooden spoon. 7. We take the head out of the water, lay it on a board, and dry it with a clean cloth. 8. We now place the forcemeat in the centre of the head, roll it up tightly in a clean cloth, and fasten it securely at both ends, with a piece of string.

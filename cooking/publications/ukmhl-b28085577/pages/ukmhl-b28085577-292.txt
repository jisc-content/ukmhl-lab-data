288 National Training School for Cookery. 9. We wet the edges of the paste, fold the paste over the #///<?, pressing the edges together with our thumb. N.B.—We must be careful to join the paste together on all sides, or the juice of the apple will run out whilst it is cooking. 10. We grease a tin with a little dripping, and place the turnovers on it. 11. We put the tin into the oven (the thermometer at the oven door should rise to 220°) to bake for a quarter of an hour. 12. For serving we place the turnovers on a hot dish. For Baked Apple Dumplings. 1. We divide the paste into three portions. 2. We take three apples, peel them, and cut out the core from the centre. N.B.—We must not cut the apples in pieces. 3. We fill the centre of the apples with moist sugar. 4. We press each apple into the centre of each portion of paste, and gradually work the paste over the apple, until the apple is entirely covered in. N.B.—We must be very careful to join the paste together as neatly as pos- sible, so as not to show the join ; and there must be no cracks in the paste. 5. We grease a tin, as described above, place the dumplings on it, and put it in the oven to bake for a quarter of an hour. 6. For serving we take the dumplings off the tin, and put them on a hot dish. 1. If the paste is for a Fruit Pie, we roll it out to the shape of the pie dish, only a little larger, and to the thick- ness of about a quarter of an inch. 2. We arrange the fruit in the pie dish, heaped up in the centre. 3. We sprinkle a tablespoonful of moist sugar over the fruit, or more or less according to the fruit used. 4. We take apaste brush and wet the edge of the dish with water, or a little white of egg.

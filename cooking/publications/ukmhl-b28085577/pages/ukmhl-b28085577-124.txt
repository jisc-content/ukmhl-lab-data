120 National Training School for Cookery. 8. We take one pound and a half of fillet of veal, and a quarter of a pound of bacon, and cut them up in small pieces with a sharp knife. 9. When the eggs are sufficiently boiled, we take them out of the saucepan, tap them all round on a cup, take the shell off, and put them in a little cold water. 10. We take them out of the water, and carefully cut them in quarters. 11. We put the veal’ bacon, and hard-boiled eggs into the pie-dish, we also sprinkle over the meat a teaspoonful of chopped parsley, and a teaspoonful of pepper and salt mixed, and pour in two tablespoonsful of cold water, or stock. 12. We now take a knife, flour it, and cut a strip of the paste the width of the edge of the pie dish. We wet the edge of the pie-dish with cold water, or white of egg, and place the paste round the edge of the dish, joining it smoothly together. 13. We now wet the edge of the paste, take the remaining piece of paste and lay it carefully over the top of the pie, pressing it down with our thumb all round the edge. 14. We take a knife, flour it, and trim off all the rough edges of the paste round the edge of the dish. 15. We should make little notches in the edge of the paste with the back of the knife, pressing the paste firmly with our thumb to keep it in its proper place. 16. We should make a small hole in the centre of the paste, to let out the steam, while it is baking. 17. We can ornament the top of the pie with any remains of paste according to taste, and if there be any white of egg, we should brush over the top of the pie. 18. We put the pie into a hot oven (the thermometer at the oven door should rise to 240° Fahrenheit), for one hour and a half; we must watch it occasionally and turn it, to prevent it burning: it should become a pale brown. It is then ready for serving.

We take one lemon, wipe it clean in a cloth, and peel it very thinly, with a sharp knife. N.B.—We must be careful in peeling the lemon not to cut any of the pith* as it would make Coe. jelly bitter. 31. We put the lemon peel into a stew-pan. 32.

We take a clean soup cloth, or a jelly bag, and fix it on the stand. 44. We take a large basin, and place it below the cloth.

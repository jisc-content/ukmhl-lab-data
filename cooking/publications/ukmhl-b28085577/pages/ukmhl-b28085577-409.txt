INGREDIENTS. d. i lb. of butter 4 £ lb. of castor sugar ., x J 6 oz. of flour 1 1 teaspoonful of grated lemon rind 0} 1 egg 1 Time required, about half an hour. Now we will show you how to make Shrewsbury Cakes. 1. We put a quarter of a pound of butter and a quarter of a pound of castor sugar into a basin, and beat them together till the mixture is of the same consistency as cream. N.B.—If the butter is very hard, it might be beaten over hot water. 2. We add to the mixture one egg and about a teaspoon- ful of grated lemon rind, and beat all well together. 3. We now stir in smoothly by degrees six ounces of flour. N.B.—We must be careful not to let it get lumpy. 4. We flour a board and turn the paste out on it. 5. We take a rolling-pin, flour it, and roll out the paste as thin as possible. 6. We dip a cutter or wine-glass in flour, and cut the paste into biscuits or cakes. 7. We grease a baking tin with dripping or butter, and put the cakes on it. 8. We put the tin into the oven (the thermometer at the oven door should rise to 240°) to bake for about twenty minutes ; they should be a light brown when baked. 9. The cakes are then ready for use.

INGREDIENTS. i pint of Haricot beans i onion 1 teaspoonful of salt Pepper Pint of milk 2 quarts of water. Time required, after the beans are soaked, about four hours and a quarter. Now we will show you how to make Haricot Puree. 1. We soak one quart of Haricot beans in cold water all night. 2. We take the soaked beans out of the water, and put them in a saucepan, with two quarts of cold water, and a teaspoonful of salt. 3. We take an onion, peel it, and cut it in slices. 4. We add the sliced onion to the saucepan. 5. We put the saucepan on the fire, and when it boils, we move it rather to the side of the fire, and let it boil gently for four hours. 6. After that time, we place a wire sieve, or colander, •over a basin, and pass the contents of the saucepan through the sieve with a wooden spoon. 7. We now stir in three quarters of a pint of milk, pour the puree back into the saucepan, add pepper and salt to taste, and put the saucepan on the fire to warm the puree : we must stir it well while it is warming. 8. For serving, we pour the puree into a hot soup tureen •or basin. N.B.—Toasted or fried bread, cut in the shape of dice, should be served with the purde.

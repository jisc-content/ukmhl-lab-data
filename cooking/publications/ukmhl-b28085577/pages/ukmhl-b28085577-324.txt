INGREDIENTS. d. i egg, i i dessertspoonful of flour i i teacupful of milk Salt Time required, about thirty-five minutes to make and thirty minutes to stand. Now we will show you how to make Batter Pitdding (in a cup for infants or invalids). 1. We put a saucepan half full of warm water on the fire to boil. 2. We put a dessertspoonful of flour into a basin with a few grad ns of salt. 3. We break one egg into the basin and mix it well into the flour. 4. We now add by degrees a teacupful of milk, stirring vigorously with a wooden spoon. 5. We let the batter stand for half an hour. 6. After that’time we take a cup (just large enough to hold the batter) and grease it well inside with a piece of butter. 7. We stir the batter} and then pour it into the cup. 8. We take a small cloth, wring it out in boiling water, flour it well, and tie it over the top of the cup, with a piece of string. N.B.—We tie the four corners of the cloth together over the top of the cup. 9. When the water in the saucepan is quite boiling, we put in the cup, and let it boil for three quarters of an hour. 10. For serving, we take the cloth off the cup, and the pudding may be turned out or not, according to taste. Now it is finished.

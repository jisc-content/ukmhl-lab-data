Lessons on Australian Meat.—Meat Pie. 45 8. We add sufficient water to make it into a stiff pastes it will take rather less than one gill (quarter of a pint). 9. We take a board, flour it, and put the paste on it. 10. We take a quart pie-dish and fill it with the pieces of meat and kidney. 11. We take a little of the jelly out of the tin and put it in the dish with the meat, to make the gravy. 12. We take a rolling pin, flour it, and roll out the paste to the shape of the top of the pie-dish, only rather larger. N.B.—We should keep our hands floured, to prevent the paste sticking. 13. We take a knife, dip it in the jlour, and cut off a strip of the paste about one inch wide. N.B.—This strip should be cut off from round the edge of thqpaste, leaving the centre piece the size of the top of the pie-dish. 14. We wet the edge of the pie-dish with water, and place the strip of paste round the edge. 15. We now wet the strip of paste on the pie-dish. 16. We take the piece of paste, lay it over the top of the pie-dish, pressing the edges together with our thumb. 17. We take a knife, flour it, and trim off the rough edges of the paste. 18. We take the knife, and with the back of the blade, we make little notches in the edge of the paste, pressing it with our thumb, to keep it in its proper place. 19. We should make a small hole in the centre of the paste, to let out the steam, whilst it is baking. 20. We can ornament the top of the pie with the remains of the paste, according to taste, and biush over the top of the pie with some white of egg. 21. We put the pie into a quick oven to bake for half an hour. 22. We must look at it occasionally, to see that it does not burn. After that time it is ready for serving.

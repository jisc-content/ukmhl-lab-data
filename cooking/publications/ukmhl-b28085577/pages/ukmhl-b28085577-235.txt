Lessons on Cooking Fish.â€”Grilled Salmon. 231 8. We must turn the gridiron occasionally, so as to cook the fish on both sides, which should become of a pale brown colour. 9. When the fish is quite done, we can remove the bone from the centre of the slice. We serve the salmon on a napkin on a hot dish. For Tartare Sauce. 1. We take two eggs, put the yolks in one basin, and the whites (which will not be wanted) into another basin. 2. We take a wooden spoon, and just stir the yolks enough to break them. 3. We add to them a saltspoonful of salt, and half a saltspoonfid of pepper, and a tablespoonful of French vinegar. 4. We take a bottle of salad oil, and, putting our thumb half over the top, pour in drop by drop, the oil, stirring well with a whisk the whole time; a gill of oil will be sufficient. 5. We now stir in a teaspoonful of ready-made mustard, and a teaspoonfid of tarragon vinegar. 6. We take a few gherkins or capers, and chop them up finely on a board, there should be enough to fill a table- spoon. 7. We take these chopped gherkins or capers and put them all into the sauce, and mix them with a spoon. 8. We serve the sauce in a sauce tureen, with the grilled salmon.

Now we will show you how to cook Sheep's Trotters. 1. We take the sheep's trotters, wash them well in a basin of cold water ; then put them in a stewpan, with sufficient cold water to cover them, put the stewpan on the fire, and when it boils, take the stewpan off, strain off the water, and put the trotters in a basin of cold water. N.B.—This is to blanch them. 2. We wash the stewpan out, wash the trotters tho- roughly, and then put them back in the stewpan. 3. We take a carrot, wash it, and scrape it clean with a sharp knife. 4. We take an onion, wash it, and peel it. 5. We put one ounce of flour into a basin, and mix it smoothly with a tablespoonful of cold water.

Now we will show you how to Stew a Rabbit. 1. We take a rabbit (which has been skinned and pro- perly prepared for cooking), put it on a board, and cut it up into neat pieces, with a sharp knife. 2. We must wash the pieces of rabbit, and dry them in a clean cloth. 3. We take a quarter of a pound of bacon, and cut it up in inch lengths; we put it in a saucepan over the fire to fry for about six minutes ; we then take it out, and put it on a plate. 4. We now put the pieces of rabbit in the saucepan, and let them fry brown, in the bacon fat. We must watch it, and turn the pieces occasionally. 5. We take a carrot, wash it, scrape it clean with a knife, and cut it in half. 6. We take an onion, and a shalot, and peel them. 7. We now put the fried bacon, and the vegetables into the saucepan, with the rabbit.

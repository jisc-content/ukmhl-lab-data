Lessons on Puddings.—Apple Charlotte. 297 10. We put a quarter of a pound of butter in a stewpan to melt and clarify. 11. We must cut the round of bread into quarters, dip them in the clarified butter, and place them at the bottom of the mould. 12. We now cut slices of the crumb of bread, one-eighth of an inch in thickness, and the depth of the mould in length. 13. We cut these slices into strips an inch wide. 14. We dip these strips into the clarified butter; and place them round inside the mould, allowing them to lie half over each other. 15. We must now pour the apples into the middle of the mould. 16. We cover the apples with a round of bread dipped in the clarified butter. 17. We put the mould into the oven (the thermometer at the oven door should rise to about 220°) to bake for three-quarters of an hour. N.B.—The bread should be quite brown and crisp. 18. For serving, we turn it carefully out of the mould on to a hot dish.

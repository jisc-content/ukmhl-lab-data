18 National Training School for Cookery. 7. We trim off the piece of flank and remove the thick piece of skin from the part where the leg joins the loin. (These trimmings must be put aside, as they can be used for other purposes.) 8. We must now weigh the leg of mutton, so as to find out how long it will take to roast it, as a quarter of an hour is allowed for each pound of weight, and one quarter of an hour besides. N.B.—When we have a joint without bone, such as rolled ribs of beef or topside of beef, we must allow twenty minutes to each pound of weight, as it is all solid meat. 9. We take the leg of mutton, which weighs say seven pounds, it will therefore take two hours to roast. 10. We put the roasting screen in front of the fire to keep off the draught and keep in all the heat. 11. We put the dripping pan down on a stand within the screen, close to the fire, with the dripping ladle. 12. We hang the roasting jack up from the mantelpiece over the dripping’pan. N.B.—Some roasting screens contain the dripping pan and the jack, which are of course more convenient. 13. We take the hook of the roasting jack and pass it through the knuckle-end of the leg. 14. We must wind up the jack with the key, before we put the joint on, so as to make it twist the meat round. 15. We must put the joint close to the fire for the first five minutes. 16. After that time we can draw the joint a little further back, or it will cook too quickly and become burnt and dried. N.B.—Meat that is frozen must be placed some way from the.fire at first, and then drawn gradually towards it, as it must thaw slowly or it may become tough. 17. We must baste the joint every five minutes with the drippings that run from it into the pan, using the dripping ladle. 18. We let the joint roast for tzvo hours, as its weight is seven pounds. 19. After that time, and just before we dish up the

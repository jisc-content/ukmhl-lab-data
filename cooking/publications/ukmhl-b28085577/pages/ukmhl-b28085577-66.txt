Now we will show you how to fry Mutton Cutlets. 1. We . take three pounds of the best end of the neck of mutton and put it on a board. 2. We take a saw and saw off the end of the rib bone, leaving the cutlet bone three inches in length. 3. We saw off the chine bone, which lies at the back of the cutlets. 4. We joint each cutlet with the chopper. 5. We take a sharp knife and cut off each cutlet close to • the bone. 6. We take a cutlet-bat, wet it, and beat each cutlet to about half an inch in thickness. 7. We trim the cutlet round, leaving about half an inch of the rib bone bare. 8. We form the cutlets to a good shape. N.B.—The trimmings of the cutlets should be put aside, as the fat may be clarified and used as dripping. 9. We take a wire sieve and stand it over a piece of paper. 10. We take some crumb of bread and rub it through the sieve.

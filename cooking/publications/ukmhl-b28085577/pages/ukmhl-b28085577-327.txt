INGREDIENTS. 1 lb. of potatoes 3 eS:Ss 1 pint of milk Sugar d. 1 Time required, about one hour. 7 Now we will show you how to make a Curates or Sweet Potato Pudding. 1. We take one pound of potatoes, wash them, and boil them as described (see “ Vegetables,” Lesson No. 1). N.B.—Any remains of cold boiled potatoes could be used instead of fresh ones. 2. We rub these boiled potatoes through a colander into a basin with a wooden spoon. 3. We break three eggs into another basin, and stir into them one pint of milk. 4. We stir the milk and eggs smoothly into the potatoes, and sweeten it with sugar according to taste. 5. We take a quart pie dish, grease it inside, and pour the mixture into it. 6. We put the pie dish in the oven (the thermometer at the oven door should rise to 220°) to bake for half an hour; it will then be ready for serving.

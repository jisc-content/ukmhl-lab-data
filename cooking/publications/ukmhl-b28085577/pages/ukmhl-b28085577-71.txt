Lessons on Cooking Meat,—[Entries.) Veal Cutlets. 67 9. We take a little savoury thyme, put it on a board, and chop it up very finely (the thyme, when chopped, should fill a saltspoon). 10. We take a small bunch of parsley, wash it in cold •water, and dry it in a cloth. 11. We chop this parsley up very finely, on a board. 12. We put one ounce of butter on a kitchen plate, and put it in the oven to melt. 13. When the butter is melted, we add a teaspoonful of lemon juice, and the chopped thyme, and parsley. 14.

We then put them in the bread crumbs and cover them well. N.B.—We should finger them as little as possible. 21. We take a gridiron and hold it to the fire to warm. 22. We arrange the cutlets on the gridiron. 23. We place the gridiron in front of a bright fire, but not too near, or the bread crumbs will burn before the cutlets are sufficiently cooked. 24. We should then let them grill for about ten minutes, and when they have become a pale brown on one side, we should turn the gridiron so as to brown them on both sides alike. 25. For serving, we arrange the cutlets on a wall of ■mashed potatoes, (see “Vegetables/’ Lesson No. 2) in a circle on a hot dish, one leaning over the other; the centre

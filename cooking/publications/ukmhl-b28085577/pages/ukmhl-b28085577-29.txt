We must stir the fat occasionally, to prevent it from burning or sticking to the bottom of the saucepan. 5. When the water has evaporated, and the pieces of fat are cooked, we should pour the melted fat through an old sieve into a basin, and when cold it can be used for all frying purposes instead of lard.

366 National Training School for Cookery. N.B.—The bones of the foot should be put in the stock-pot. Now we will show you how to make a stew of the meat of the foot. 1. We take one carrot, wash it, scrape it clean, and cut it in slices with a sharp knife. 2. We take a small turnip and an onion, peel them, and cut them in slices. 3. We put these vegetables into a saucepan with half an ounce of clarified dripping. 4. We put the saucepan on the fire and let the vegetables fry a light brown ; we must be careful they do not burn. 5. We cut the meat off the bones of the foot, cut it up into nice pieces, and season them with pepper and scdt according to taste. 6. We put these pieces of meat into the saucepan with the vegetables. 7. We then pour in one pint of cold water, just bring it to the boil, and remove the saucepan to the side of the fire to stew gently one hour or till the vegetables are tender. 8. We then strain off the liquor and put the vegetables and meat on a dish. 9. We put the dish near the fire to keep warm. 10. We put half an ounce of butter into the saucepan and put it on the fire to melt. 11. When the butter is melted we add half an ounce of flour, and mix them well together with a wooden spoon. 12. We stir in gradually the liquor, and stir it till it boils and thickens. 13. We then remove the saucepan to the side of the fire. N.B.—The sauce can be coloured with burnt sugar or a browned onion. 14. We now place in the meat and the vegetables, and let them just warm through. 15. We serve this stew on a hot dish with boiledpotatoes (see Vegetables, Lesson No. 1), or rice (see Rice, Lesson No. r).

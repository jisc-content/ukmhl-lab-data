2 12 National Training School for Cookery. For Lobster Sauce. 1. We take a small lobsterâ€”it should be a hen lobster if possible. 2. We put the lobster on a board. 3. We take a chopper and break the shell of the lobster by hitting it with the blade of the chopper, not with the edge ; 1st because it would cut the lobster in pieces, and 2nd because it would spoil the edge of the chopper. 4. We break all the shell off the claws and back with our fingers and take out all the flesh. 5. We cut this flesh up with a sharp knife to the size of small dice. 6. If the lobster is a hen lobster we shall find a bit of coral in the neck, and a strip of it down the back. 7. We take all this coral out of the lobster and wash it carefully in cold water in a small basin. 8. We take the coral out of the basin and put it in a mortar with one ounce of butter. 9. We pound the coral and the butter well with the pestle. 10. We take it out of the mortar, and scrape the mortar out quite clean with a palette knife, for none must be lost. 11. If we have not a palette knife we can manage as well with a piece of uncooked potato cut into the shape of a knife blade with a thick back, with this we can scrape all out of the mortar. 12. We take a hair sieve and put it over a plate. 13. We rub the pounded mixture through the sieve with the back of a wooden spoon. 14. We must turn up the sieve when all the mixture has passed through, and we shall find some sticking on the underneath part. 15. We scrape all this carefully off with the spoon. 16. We make it all into a little pat 17. We take a stewpan and put in it one oimce of butter and one ounce of flour.

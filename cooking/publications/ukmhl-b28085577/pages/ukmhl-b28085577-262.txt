258 National Training School for Cookery. If Cauliflower au Gratin be requiredâ€” 1. We take the cauliflower and wash it, and boil it in the same way as described above, from Note i to Note 6. 2. When the cauliflower is sufficiently boiled, we take it out of the saucepan with a slice and put it on a plate. 3. We take a knife and cut off all the outside green' leaves. 4. We put a cloth over the cauliflower, and squeeze all the water out of the cauliflower. 5. We put half an ounce of butter and one ounce of flour in a stewpan, and mix them well together with a wooden spoon. 6. We pour in one gill (or quarter of a pint) of cold water. 7. We put the stewpan on the fire, and stir smoothly until it boils and thickens. 8. We now add one tablespoonful of cream, cayenne pepper (about as much as would very thinly cover half the top of a threepenny piece}, and salt, according to taste. 9. We stand the stewpan by the side of the fire, until the sauce is required for use. 10. We take tzvo ounces of Parmesan cheese, and grate it with a grater on to a piece of paper. 11. We now take the stewpan off the fire and stand it on a piece of paper on the table. 12. We stir rather more than half the grated cheese into the sauce. 13. We place the cauliflower on a tin dish. 14. We pour the sauce all over the cauliflower. 15. We take the remainder of the grated cheese and sprinkle it over the cauliflower, and brown the top of it with a hot salamander. 16.

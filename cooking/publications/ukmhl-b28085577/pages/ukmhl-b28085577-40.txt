36 National Training School for Cookery. 9. We sprinkle each layer of meat with plenty of pepper and salt, and a little of the chopped onion. 10. We fill the dish half full of cold water. N.B.—If there be any cold gravy it would, of course, be better than the water. N.B.—The pie dish should be quite full of meat, and rather heaped in the centre, so as to raise the crust of potato. 11. We take the mashed potato and put it over the top of the meat, smoothing it over neatly with a knife. 12. We take a fork, and mark all over the top of the Potato. N.B.—If liked, the mashed potato might be mixed with half its weight of flour into a dough, to make a more substantial crust; it must be then rolled out with a rolling-pin like pastry. 13. We put the pie dish into the oven, or into a Dutch oven in front of the fire, for half an hour, to brown the crust of potato and warm the meat through, it is then ready for serving.

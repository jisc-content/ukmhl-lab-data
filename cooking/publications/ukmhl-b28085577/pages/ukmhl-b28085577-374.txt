We pour this melted gelatine through a strainer and stir it into the custard. 11. We pour half a pint of double cream into a basin, and whisk it to a stiff froth with the whisk. 12. We add to it a tablespoonfid of castor sugar and half a teaspoonful of essence of Vanilla. N.B.—If any other flavouring be preferred, it should be now added, instead of the essence of Vanilla. 13. When the custard is sufficiently cooled, we stir it lightly into the whipped cream. 14. We take a pint and a half mould, scald it with hot water, and then rinse it out with cold. 15. We pour the cream into the mould, and stand it in ice, until required for use. 16. For serving, we should dip the mould into boiling water for a second, shake it to loosen the cream, and then turn it out carefully on to a dish. N.B.—This is an economical recipe for making cream, but if made entirely ol cream, instead of cream and custard, it would of course be richer.

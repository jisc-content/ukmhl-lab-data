These Goods possess all the Advantages, but none of the Drawbacks, of Copper or Enamel Same Thickness and Weight as the Ordinary Copper Pans. USED AT THE NATIONAL TRAINING SCHOOL FOR COOKERY AND REFRESHMENT DEPARTMENTS OF THE HEALTH, INVENTIONS, COLONIAL AND INDIAN EXHIBITIONS. These Utensils are thickly coated inside and out with Pure Tin. They can easily be re-tinned, but the bodies, being bright steel, are equally healthy, cleanly, and uninjurious to food, thus rendering them far superior to copper. Their strength and thickness, and being Seamless Steel, make them practically indestructible and not liable to burn their contents. Their cost, being considerably less than wrought-iron, and about one-third the price of copper, they should be used in every Household, Cooking School, Restaurant, Club, &c. Made also to nest, for shipping, and with loose handles for camp use.

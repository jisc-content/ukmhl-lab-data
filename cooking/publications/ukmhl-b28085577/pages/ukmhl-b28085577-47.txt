Lessons on Australian Meat.—Sausage Rolls. 43, 9. We add enough water to the flour to make it into a stiff paste. 10. We flour the paste board. 11. We turn the paste out on the board. N.B.—We should divide the paste in two, so as not to handle it too much. 12. We take a rolling pin, flour it, and roll out each portion into a thin sheet, about one-eighth of an inch in thickness. 13. We cut the paste into pieces about six inches square. 14. We should collect all the scraps of paste (so that none is wasted), fold them together, and roll them out and cut them into squares. N.B.—There should be about two dozen squares of paste. 15. We should put about a tablespoonful of the mince meat into the centre of each square of paste. 16. We fold the paste round the meat, joining it smoothly down the centre, and pressing the ends of the paste together with our finger and thumb. 17. We take a baking tin, grease it well, and place the satis age rolls on it. 18. We break one egg on to a plate, and beat it slightly with a knife. 19. We take a paste brush, dip it in the egg, and paint over the tops of the rolls. 20. We place the tin in a hot oven to bake for 15, minutes. N.B.—We should look at them once or twice, and turn them if necessary, so. that they shall be equally baked. 21. For serving we take the rolls off the tin and plac® them on a hot dish.

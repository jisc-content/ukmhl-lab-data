Lessons on Making Souffles.—Potato Souffle. 38 1 8. We put one oimce of butter and two tablespoonsful oj milk in a stewpan, and put it on the fire to boil. 9. We add salt and pepper according to taste. 10. We then add three ounces of the sifted potatoes, and! stir it smoothly. 11. We must now take the stewpan off the fire, and stand it on a piece of paper or wooden trivet, on the table. 12. We take three eggs, and add, one by one, only the- yolks, beating all well together with a wooden spoon. 13. We take the three whites, and add another white to make four, and put them in a basin ; we add a quarter of a saltspoonfid of salt to them, and whip them to a stiff froth. 14. We add the whites to the above mixture, and stir the whole lightly. 15. We now stand the eight half-potato skins on a baking sheet. 16. We pour the mixture carefully into each potato skin (they should be only half full). 17. We put the sheet into the oven (the thermometer at the oven door should rise to 240°) for ten minutes, until they have risen well, and become a pale brown colour. 18. We should fold a table napkin, and arrange them on it for serving.

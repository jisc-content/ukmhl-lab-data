We put the cow-heel on a board, and cut off all the flesh ; we cut the flesh into neat pieces. 3. We take an ox-cheek and wash it well in cold water. N.B.—We must be sure it is quite clean and free from all impurities. 4. We put the ox-cheek on a board, and rub it well with salt. 5. We then rub it quite dry in a clean cloth. 6. We put three ounces of clarified dripping into a large saucepan, and put it on the fire to melt. 7. We cut the ox-cheek up into neat pieces. N.B.—We should weigh the flesh of the ox-cheek and cow-heel, so as to know * how much water should be added, as 1 pint is allowed to each lb. of meat. 8. We flour each piece. 9. When the dripping is melted, we put in the floured pieces of ox-cheek, and let them fry a nice brown.

We take a tin of Australian mince meat, open it care- fully, and remove all the fat from the part of the meat required for immediate use. N.B.—This fat should be clarified by putting it into boiling water, and when cold it can be used as dripping. 14. We take one pound of the mince out of the tin, put it in a saucepan with one tablespoonful of mushroom ketchup, and stir it into a paste. 15. We put the saucepan on the fire and let the mince just warm through. N.B.—We should be very careful that it does not boil, or the meat will get hardened. 16. For serving we make a wall of the mashed potatoes round the edge of a hot dish, and we pour the mince in the centre; we should stand the dish in front of the fire to colour the potato a pale brown.

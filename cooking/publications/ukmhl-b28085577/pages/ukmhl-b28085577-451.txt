Now we will show you how to dress an “ ordinary salad!' N.B.—A salad can be made with watercress, mustard and cress, endive, beet- root, cucumber, celery, and any cold boiled vegetable, such as, potato, carrot, turnip, parsnip, the flower of cauliflower, and cabbage, according to taste. They can be dressed as an ordinary salad,-or with a mayonnaise sauce. , (See Sauces, Lesson No. 3.) 1. We take the lettuce, wash it well in cold water, and pull off each leaf separately, so as to get them quite free from dirt or grit. 2. We put the lettuce into a clean cloth, hold the cloth up by the corners, and shake the lettuce well, so as to get it quite dry. 3. We break up the leaves of the lettuce into small pieces, and put them into a salad bowl. N.B.—A lettuce should never be cut with a knife. If the flavour of onion is liked, the dish could be rubbed round with half an onion, or two or three spring onions (washed and the green tops cut oft) can be put in the salad. 4. We take a bottle of salad oil and pour two tablespoonsful of oil over the lettuce, and mix it up well with a spoon and fork. 5. We take the tablespoon, put in it a saltspoonful of salt, half a saltspoonful of pepper, half a teaspoonful of ready- made mustard (if liked), and a dessertspoonful of common or tarragon vinegar, or half and half, according to taste ; mix all up together, and then pour it over the lettuce; mix up the lettuce well. r t ; ‘ 6. The salad is now ready for serving.

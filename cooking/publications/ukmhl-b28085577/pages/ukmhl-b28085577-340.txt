336 National Training School for Cookery. 9. We take a quarter of a pound of damsons (or any other fruit), and wipe them with a cloth to be sure that they are quite clean. 10. We sprinkle the fruit into the batter, and put two or three bits of butter on the top to prevent its being dry. N.B.—If preferred the fruit can be omitted. 11. We put the pie-dish into the oven (the thermometer at the oven door should rise to 220°) to bake for half an hour. 12. After that time we take the pie-dish out of the oven and sprinkle some sugar over the top, and it is ready for serving. N.B.—Sugar should, of course, be eaten with the batter pudding. N.B.—If sugar were added to the batter before it was baked it would make it heavy.

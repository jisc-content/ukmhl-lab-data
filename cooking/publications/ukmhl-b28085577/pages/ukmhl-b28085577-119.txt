Now we will show you how we make Cornish Pasties. 1. We take half a pound of buttock steak or beef skirt, put it on a board, and cut it up into small pieces. 2. We take half a pound of potatoes, wash and peel them put them on a board, and cut them up into small pieces. 3. We take one small onion, peel it, put it on a board, and chop it up as finely as possible. 4. We put one pound of flour into a basin with a little salt, and a teaspoonful of baking powder. 5. We put in six ounces of dripping, and rub it well into the flour with our hands. 6. We now add enough cold water to mix it into a stiff paste. 7. We flour a board and turn the paste on to it. 8. We take a rolling-pin, flour it, and roll the paste out into a thin sheet, about a quarter of an inch in thickness. 9. We cut the paste into pieces about six or seven inches square. 10. We place a little of the meat andpotato in the centre of each square, sprinkle over it a little pepper and salt, and a very little of the chopped onioii. 11. We fold the paste over the meat, joining it by pressing the ed^es together with our thumb and finger. h ?

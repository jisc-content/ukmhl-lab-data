124 National Training School for Cookery. 12. We take the paste out of the basin and put it on a board. 13. We roll out the paste once to the shape of the pie dish, only rather larger, and to the thickness of about one-third of an inch. 14. We wet the edge of the dish with water. 15. We take a knife, dip it in flour, and cut a strip of the paste the width of the edge of the pie dish, and place it round the edge of the dish. N.B.—We should cut this strip of paste from round the edge of the paste, leaving the centre piece the size and shape of the top of the pie dish. 16. We wet the edge of the paste with water. 17. We take the remaining paste and place it over the pie dish, pressing it down with our thumb all round the edge. N.B.—We must be very careful not to break the paste. 18. We take a knife, dip it in flour, and trim off all the rough edges of the paste round the edge of the dish. 19. We take a knife, and with the back of the blade we make little notches in the edge of the paste, pressing the paste firmly with our thumb to keep it in its proper place. N.B.—We can ornament the top of the pie with any remaining paste to our fancy. 20. We make a hole with the knife in the centre of the pie to let out the steam while the pie is baking. N.B.—If there were not an escape for the steam it would sodden the inside of the crust, and so prevent it from baking properly. 21. We put the pie into the oven to bake g'ently for two hours. We must watch it occasionally, and turn it to prevent its burning. It should become a pale brown. It is then ready for serving. N.B.—Meat pies should be put in the hottest part of the oven first, which, in most ovens, is the top, to make the crust light, and then put in a cooler part to cook the meat thoroughly. N.B.—This pie could be made with veal or mutton instead of steak.

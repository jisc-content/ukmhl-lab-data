INGREDIENTS. i gill [\ pint) of milk i oz. of butter i £ lb. of flour i teaspoonful of baking powder o£ 3 Time required, about half an hour. Now we will show you how to make Milk Biscuits. 1. We put one gill (a quarter of a pint) of milk into a saucepan ; we add to it one ounce of butter, and put it on the fire to warm. 2. We put half a pound of flour into a basin with a teaspoonful of baking powder. 3. When the milk is hot, we pour it into the flour and stir it carefully into a smooth, stiff paste. 4. We flour a board and turn the paste out on it. 5. We take a rolling pin, flour it, and roll the paste out into as thin a sheet as possible. 6. We flour a docker or a tumbler and cut the paste out into rounds, about the size of the top of a teacup. 7. We grease a tin with dripping or butter, and place the biscuits on it. 8. We put the tin into the oven (the thermometer at the oven door should rise to 240°) to bake for twenty minutes. 9. After that time we turn the biscuits off the tin, and set them aside to cool. They are then ready for serving.

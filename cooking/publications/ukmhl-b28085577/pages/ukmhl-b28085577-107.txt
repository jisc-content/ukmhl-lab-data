Lessons on Cooking Meat.—Curried Tripe. 103 of dripping, and mix them all well together with a wooden spoon. 11. We add cold water, sufficient to make the above into a stiff paste. 12. We now pour in half a pint of the liquor, in which the tripe was boiled. 13. We put the saucepan on the fire, and stir the mixture well until it boils and thickens. We must not let it get lumpy. 14. We stir in a quarter of a teaspoonfid of brown sugar and salt according to taste. We must now stand the saucepan aside to get cool. 15. We take the onion which was boiled with the tripe, and cut it in shreds and add it to the sauce. 16. When the sauce is a little cool, we put in the pieces of tripe and just let them warm through. 17. We take a dish and warm it, and pour the tripe and sauce on it, keeping it as much in the centre of the dish as possible. 18. We take a teacupfirt of Patna rice, wash it well in two or three waters, and put it in a saucepan full of boiling water. We must be sure the water is boiling. (N.B.—Rice should be boiled in plenty of water.) We add to it a saltspoonfid of salt. 19. We must let it boil from a quarter of an hour to twenty minutes, after that time, we must feel the rice to see if it is soft. 20. When the rice is sufficiently cooked, we strain it off, and pour cold water over it. 21. We then put the rice back into the empty saucepan, and stand the saucepan by the side of the fire to dry the rice. The lid should be only half on the saucepan^ 22. When the rice is quite dry we take it out' of the saucepan and arrange it round the tripe. It is now ready for serving.

National Training School for Cookery. LESSONS ON CLEANING STOVES, GRATES, AND KITCHEN UTENSILS. TO CLEAN AN OPEN KITCHEN RANGE. 1. We should rake out all the cinders, and sift them into a scuttle for use. N.B.—All the dust should be thrown away. 2. We take a sweep’s brush, and sweep down all the soot from the flues and oven. 3. We should remove the soot door at the back, and the rings on the top of the oven, force the flue brush upwards and downwards ; then sweep the soot from the top of the oven, down the flue at the side of the oven, the farthest from the fire, and remove the small flush door on the top over this side, and sweep all the soot off the sides to the bottom. 4. We must then remove a small door under the bottom of the oven, and carefully draw out the soot from the right hand, and also the left hand, with the raker, and then re- place the doors and dampers. 5. We must now clean the boiler flue. We remove the soot door at the back, and force the flue brush in the opening upwards and downwards : then take the raker, and carefully rake away all the clinkers and soot from under the boiler, and now replace the soot door. N.B.—The water is heated from the heat that passes under the boiler, and not the surface heat in front, therefore if the flue under the boiler is not clear of clinkers, no hot water can be obtained. 6. We mix some pounded black lead in a gallipot, with enough water to make it into a smooth thick liquid. We dip the black-lead brush in the mixture, and black-lead the whole of the range, beginning from the top of the stove by the dampers, and then downwards.

Appendixâ€”Tomates Farcie au Gratin. 449 after that time we take the stewpan off the fire, and stand it on a piece of paper on the table. 8. We take seven tomatoes (they should be of equal sizes if possible), cut off the tops of them with a sharp knife, and carefully scoop out the inside. 9. We take an ounce of Parmasan cheese, and grate it with a grater over the browned bread-crumbs on the plate. 10. We fill each tomato with the mixture in the stewpan, and sprinkle the bread-crumbs and cheese over the top of each one. 11. We put the stuffed tomatoes on to a tin, and put them in the oven to warm. 12. For serving, we arrange them nicely on a hot dish.

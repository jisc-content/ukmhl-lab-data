74 PSational Training School for Cookery. 9. We take a little thyme and marjoram and chop them up finely. (There should be about a quarter of a teaspoonful of chopped thyme and marjoram.) 10. We add all these things (i.e., suet, bread crumbs, parsley, thyme, and marjoram) to the chopped beef in the basin. 11. We also grate about half a teaspoonful of lemon rind,\ and nutmeg (as much as would cover a $d. piece) into the basin. 12. We season it with pepper and salt according to taste, and add one egg; and mix all well together with a wooden spoon. 13. We take this mixture out of the basin, and form it into pieces the shape and size of a cork. 14. We roll up each slice of beef, placing a piece of stuffing in the centre. 15. We should tie each roll round with a piece of twine to fasten it securely together. 16. We place these rolls in a stewpan, with about one pint of brown sauce (see “ Sauces,” Lesson No. 2), ox good stock (see Lesson on “ Stock”). 17. We put the stewpan on the fire and let them stew gently for three quarters of an hour. 18. For serving, we should takeoff the twine from round the beef olives, and arrange them on a hot dish in a circle, pouring the sauce round the edge ; the centre may be filled in with dressed spinach (see “ Vegetables,” Lesson No. 8), or with mashed potatoes (see “ Vegetables,” Lesson No. 2).

Lessons on Cooking Meat.■—Boiling. 21 C. —In boiling meat for the purpose of making soup, the meat should be put into cold water, in order to extract all the goodness from the meat. D. —The water should be brought gradually to boiling point, then moved to the side of the fire, and left to simmer gently for some length of time. N.B.—Salt meat must be put into warm water, so as to extract a little of the salt before the pores of the skin are closed up ; if the meat were put into boiling water the pores of the skin would be closed, and the meat would be hardened by the salt not being allowed to escape. 8. When the water in the saucepan is warm, we take the beef, which weighs, say, eight pounds (it will therefore take about one hour and twenty minutes), and put it in the sauce- pan; there should be only just enough water to cover the joint. 9. We let the water just boil up, and then we should move the saucepan to the side of the fire, and let it simmer gently for the remainder of the time. 10. As soon as the water comes to the boil we must take a large spoon and skim the water carefully. N.B.—The scum should be skimmed off directly it rises, or it will boil down again in the meat and spoil it. Scum is the impurity which rises from the meat. N.B.—We must be very careful not to let the meat boil, or it will be hardened and tough. 11. When the meat is sufficiently cooked, we take it carefully out of the saucepan and put it on a hot dish for serving. We pour about a gill of the liquor (in which it was boiled) round the joint (this makes the gravy, and when the joint is cut the juices from the meat will add to it). N.B.—The liquor from boiled meat can always be used for different pur- poses, and should therefore never be thrown away, but poured into a clean basin and put aside to cool, the fat should be carefully removed from the top of the liquor, while it is cold, before being used. Salt liquor is often used for making pea soup.

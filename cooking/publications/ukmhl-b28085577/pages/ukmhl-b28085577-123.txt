We put three quarters of a pound of flour, three ounces of butter, and two ounces of lard, on a board. 2. We take a knife and chop up the butter and lard into the flour, sprinkle over a qitarter of a saltspoonful of salt, heap it on the board, and make a well in the centre. 3. We add a large tablespoonfid of water, and beat it up slightly with a knife. 4. We now, slowly and lightly, mix it all with our fingers, adding more water if necessary, until it be formed into a stiff paste. 5. We must keep our hands, and the board well floured, that the paste may not stick. 6. We take a rolling-pin, flour it, and roll out the paste, and fold it in half, turn it round with the rough edges towards us, roll it again, and fold it as before three times more ; the last time we should roll it out to the size of the pie-dish to be used, only a little larger, and to the thickness of about a quarter of an inch. 7. We put a small saucepan of water on the fire to boil ; when the water boils, we should put in two eggs, and let them boil for ten minutes.

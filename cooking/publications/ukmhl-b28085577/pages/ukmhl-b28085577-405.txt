We put one pound of flour into a basin, with a tea- spoonful of baking powder and half a saltspoonful of salt. 2. We take a quarter of a pound of clarified dripping and rub it well into the flour with our hands until there are no lumps remaining. 3. We take half a pound of plums or currants or a quarter of a pound of each and add them to the flour. N.B.—If currants are used they should be well washed and dried in a cloth and picked over to see there are no stones in them. Large plums should be stoned before they are used. 4. We take two ounces of candied peel, cut it in small pieces and put it in the basin. We also add a quarter of a pound of sugar. N.B.—If peel is disliked it may be omitted. 5. We break one egg into a basin and add to it two table- spoonsful of milk, and beat them up. 6. We stir this into the ingredients in the basin, mixing them all well together. c c

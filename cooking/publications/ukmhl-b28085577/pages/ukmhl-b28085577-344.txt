INGREDIENTS. d. 8 oz. of flour 1^ 1 pint of milk 2£ Salt ( 2 2 eggs j T Time required, one hour. Now we will show you how to make a Yorkshire Pudding. 1. We put eight ounces of flour into a basin, and mix into it half a salt-spoonful of salt. 2. We break two eggs into the flour and stir it well. 3. We now add by degrees a pint of milk, beating all the time with a wooden spoon to make the batter as smooth and as light as possible. 4. We take a pudding tin (about a pint), place it under the meat that is roasting in front of the fire, to catch some dripping to grease the tin. 5. We then pour the batter into the tin and let it cook under the meat for half an hour, or put it in the oven to bake for twenty minutes. 6. We must watch it, and turn the tin, so that the pudding does not get burnt. N.B.—A commoner and more substantial Yorkshire pudding can be made in the same way as above, only with 6 oz. of flour, 1 egg, 1 pint of milk, and 1 tdblespooiiful of chopped suet sprinkled over the batter when it is poured into the tin. 7. When the pudding is sufficiently cooked, we turn it carefully out of the tin on to a hot dish, and it is then ready for serving with the roast meat.

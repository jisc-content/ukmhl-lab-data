Lessons on C ookingMeat.—Stewed Brisket of Beef. 9 3 corns, six allspice, tablespoonfid of salt, and quarts of cold water. 7. We put the saucepan on the fire, and when it comes to the boil we should skim it well. 8. We then move the saucepan to the side of the fire, and let the contents simmer gently for three hours, we must watch it and skim it occasionally. 9. After that time we take the meat out of the saucepan and put it on a dish. 10. We take a knife and carefully remove the flat bones at the side of the beef. 11. We place the beef between two dishes and some heavy weight on the top to press the beef. 12. We pour the stock through a strainer into a basin, and when it is cold we should remove every particle of fat,\ N.B.—Instead of reducing the stock for glaze, glaze can be bought at the grocer’s ; about half an ounce would be required, and it should be put in a gaily pot with about a tablespoonful of water; the gaily pot must be placed in a saucepan of boiling water, over the fire; when the glaze is. melted, it should be stirred with the brush, before brushing over the meat, as directed in paragraph 14. The stock can be used for soup. 13. We then put the stock in a stewpan, and put it on the fire to boil, without the lid, so as to reduce the stock to a glaze, about a gill (a quarter of a pint). 14. We now take the beef and with a paste brush cover the joint with Xhe glaze, brushing it over several times until all the glaze is used up; as soon as the glaze is cold and set on the beef it is ready for serving.

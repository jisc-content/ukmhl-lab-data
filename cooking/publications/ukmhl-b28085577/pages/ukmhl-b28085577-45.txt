Lessons on Australian Meat.â€”Mulligatawny. 4 f 8. We take two leeks, wash them well in cold water, and cut off the green tops of the leaves. 9. We cut up the leeks and put them in the saucepan. 10. We take two carrots, wash them, scrape them with a knife, cut them in pieces, and put them in the saucepan. 11. We give one stir with a wooden spoon to mix the 1vegetables together, and let them fry for ten minutes. 12. We also add a sprig of parsley, a sprig of thyme, a sprig of marjoram and two bay-leaves, tied tightly together with a piece of string. 13. When the vegetables have fried for ten minutes we take half a pint of the liquor (in which the meat is soaking), pour it into the saucepan, and let it boil and reduce to a quarter of a pint. 14. We should stir the vegetables occasionally. 15. We put two iablcspoonsful of flour and one tablespoon- ful of curry powder into a basin, and mix them into a smooth paste with one gill (quarter of a pint) of the liquor. 16. We stir this mixture into the saucepan with the vegetables. 17. We now put the meat and the remaining liqitor into the saucepan, put the lid on and let it come to the boil. 18. When it boils we should put one saltspoonfid of salt and half a saltspoonfid of moist sugar into the saucepan. 19. We now move the saucepan to the side of the fire and let it simmer for two hours and a half. 20. We should watch it, and skim it occasionally with a spoon. 21. After that time we strain the soup through a strainer into a basin. 22. We pour the soup back into the saucepan. 23. We open the two pound tin of calf's head, remove .all the fat from the top, and stir the contents of the tin into the soup in the saucepan. 24. For serving we pour the soup into a hot soup-tureen.

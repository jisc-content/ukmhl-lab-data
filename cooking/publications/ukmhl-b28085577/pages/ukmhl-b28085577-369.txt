Lessons on Making Jellies.—Ox-foot Jelly. 365 21. We now add the jelly stock. 22. We put the saucepan on the fire and stir the con- tents well with a whisk or iron spoon until it boils. 23. We now put the lid on the saucepan, and stand it by the side of the fire for twenty minutes or half an hour. 24. If there is no jelly bag we should take a clean cloth folded over cornerways, and sew it up one side, making it in the shape of a jelly bag. 25. We place two chairs back to back in front of the fire. 26. We take the sewn up cloth, hang it between the twa chairs, by pinning it open to the top bar of each chair. 27. We must place a basin underneath the bag. 28. We must look at the jelly in the saucepan, and when there is a good crust formed over, it is ready to. be strained. 29. We then take the saucepan off the fire and pour the jelly carefully into the bag to pass into the basin. 30. We repeat this two or three times until the jelly runs through quite clear. N.B.—A glass of wine may be added now if desired. 31. We take a quart basin or a mould, scald it with hot water, and then rinse it out with cold. 32. We pour the jelly into the basin and stand it aside to cool and set until it is required for use. N.B.—II porter jelly be required we put the jelly-stock into a saucepan with a quarter of a pound of lump sugar, half a teaspoonful of mixed spice,. and half a pint of porter; we put it on the fire and let it boil for an hour and a half, stirring occasionally ; we then strain it in the same way as for the lemon jelly.

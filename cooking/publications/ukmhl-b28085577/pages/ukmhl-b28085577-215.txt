Now we will show you how to boil Turbot and make Lobster Sauce. 1. We take the turbot. 2. We put it in a basin of cold water and wash it well. 3. We get a fishkettle and fill it with cold water, add to it as much salt as will make the water taste salt, and put it on the fire to boil. 4. We take the turbot out of the basin. 5. We put it on the drainer of the fishkettle, and put it in the kettle of boiling water, so that it is well covered with water. 6. We let it boil for twenty minutes or half an hour. 7. We must watch it and skim the water if necessary. N.B.—While the turbot is boiling, we should make the lobster sauce (see below). 8. When the fish is sufficiently boiled, the flesh will divide from the bone. 9. Now we take the drainer carefully out of the fishkettle, stand it. across the kettle a minute to drain, and slip the fish carefully on to a hot dish for serving. o 2

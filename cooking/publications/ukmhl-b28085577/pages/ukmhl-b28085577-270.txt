266 National Training School for Cookery, VEGETABLES. Lesson No. 13. STEWED LENTILS. Average cost of “ Stezued Lentils" (one pint). INGREDIENTS. 1 pint of brown lentils (French) 3 1 oz. of butter 1 x gill of stock 1 * onion ) Pepper and salt J J _5§ Time required, after the lentils are soaked, about one hour and a half. Now we will show you how to stew lentils. 1. We take one pint of brown lentils (the French are best suited for stewing), wash them well in cold water, and put them to soak in water for four hours, or all night is best. 2. After that time, we take the lentils out of the water, put them in a saucepan, cover them with cold water, add a teaspoonful of salt, put the saucepan over the fire to boil. When it boils, move the saucepan to the side of the fire to simmer for one hour. N.B.—The lid should be off the saucepan, all the water will be absorbed by the lentils. 3. We take one small onion, peel it, and cut it in slices. 4. We put one ounce of butter into a saucepan, add the sliced onion, put it over the fire to fry the onion brown. We must stir it occasionally, and be careful the onion does not burn. 6. When the lentils are done, we turn them into the saucepan with the onion, and add one gill (or J of a pint) of second stock. We season it with pepper and salt to taste, and stir it over the fire for ten minutes. 6. For serving we pour the contents of the saucepan into a hot vegetable dish.

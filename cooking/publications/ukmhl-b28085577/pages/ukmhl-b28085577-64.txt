Now we will show you how to lard and braise Fillets of Beef. 1. We take one pound of fillet of beef (cut from the under- cut of the sirloin), and put it on a board. 2. We take a sharp knife, and cut the beef into small round fillets, to about the size of the top of a breakfast cup, and about three-quarters of an inch in thickness, and trim them neatly. 3. We take a strip of the fat of bacon (nearest the rind is best, as it is harder), about one inch wide. 4. We take a sharp knife and cut up this piece of bacon into little strips, an inch long, and one-eighth of an inch in width and thickness. 5. We take each fillet and hold it in a clean cloth. 6. We take a larding needle with a little strip of bacon in it, and lard each fillet neatly in regular rows ; until one side of the fillet is entirely covered with strips of bacon. 7. When we have larded all the fillets, we lay them care- fully in a clean saute-pan. 8. We add a bouquet garni, consisting of a sprig of parsley, thyme, and a bay leaf\ all tied neatly and tightly together.

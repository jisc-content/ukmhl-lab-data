Lessons on Making Pastry.—Flaky Crust. 291 9. We then fold the paste again, and roll it out to the size and thickness required either for a fruit pie or an open tart. N.B.—This crust should be baked in a quick oven (the thermometer at the oven door should rise to 240°). N.B.—The top of a fruit pie should be brushed over with water, and then sprinkled with pounded white sugar. N.B.—For an open tart we take a tin (the size required) and grease it with clarified dripping or butter. We should roll out the paste to a thin sheet about a quarter of an inch in thickness, and rather larger than the size of the tin. We place the paste in the greased tin, pressing it into the shape of the tin with our thumb. We should place a dummy or a piece of crust of bread in the centre of the paste to prevent the paste from rising while baking. We put the tin in the oven to bake for twenty minutes. The jam should be put into the tart after it is baked.

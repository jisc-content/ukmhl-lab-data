We put a quarter of a pound of suet on a board, cut away all the skin, and chop it up as finely as possible with a sharp knife. N.B.—We should sprinkle a little flour over the suet to prevent it sticking to the knife. 2. We put three-quarters of a pound of flour into a basin, and mix into it a teaspoonfid of baking powder. 3. We now add the chopped suet, and rub it well into the flour with our hands. 4. We take a quarter of a pound of large raisins and stone them. 5. We take a quarter of a pound of currants, wash them, and dry them in a cloth, and pick them over to see there are no stones mixed with them. 6. We take two ounces of mixed candied peel, and cut it up in small pieces on a board.

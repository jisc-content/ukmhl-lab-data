We take a rabbit [which has been skinned and pro- perly prepared for cooking] and put it on a board. 2. We cut it up in the same way as for carving, taking care that the pieces are nearly all of one size. N.B.—Chicken, veal, and other meats would serve the purpose for curry as well as rabbit. 3. We take a quarter of an ounce of coriander seed’ put it into the mortar, and pound it very fine with a pestle. 4. We take the pounded seed out of the mortar, and put it on a piece of paper ; we must scrape out the mortar cleanly so that none be lost. 5. We take two cloves of garlic, peel them with a sharp knife and place them in the mortar. 6. We also put into the mortar a dessertspoonful of tur- merick.

We put half a pint of milk and one tablespoonful of semolina into a saucepan. 2. We put the saucepan on the fire and stir occasionally until it boils and swells, then we set it by the side of the fire. 3. We break one egg into a basin and add to it a dessert- spoonful of moist sugar and beat them lightly together with a fork. 4. We take a three-quarters of a pint pie-dish and grease it inside with a piece of butter. 5. When the semolina is sufficiently cool, we stir in lightly the sweetened egg. 6. We pour this mixture into the pie-dish. 7. We take a grater and a nutmeg and grate a quarter of a teaspoonful over the mixture. 8. We put the dish into the oven (the thermometer at the oven door should rise to 220°) to bake for a quarter of an hour, and it is ready for serving. N.B. Puddings can be made in the same way with sago, tapioca, or rice.

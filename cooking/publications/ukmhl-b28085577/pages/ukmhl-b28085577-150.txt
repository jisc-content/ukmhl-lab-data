146 National Training School for Cookery. BUBBLE AND SQUEAK. Average cost of “Bubble and Squeak” INGREDIENTS. s. d. 1 lb. of boiled salt beef, or pork o io| 1 cabbage o 2 1 o| Time required, about half-an-hour. Now we will show you how to make Bubble and Squeak. 1. We take a cabbage, and wash it well in salt and water. 2. We put a saucepan of water on the fire to boil, we add a tablespoonful of salt, and a tiny piece of common soda, about the size of a pea. 3. When the water boils, we put in the cabbage, and let it boil for about twenty minutes. We should feel the stalk with a fork to see if it is tender, and then drain off all the water, and put the cabbage on a plate. N.B.—Any remains of cold boiled cabbage could be used instead of boiling a fresh one. 4. We cut some thin slices of cold salt beef, and a little of the fat, and put them in a frying pan. 5. We put the pan over the fire, and fry the meat a light brown. We must turn the slices occasionally, and not let them burn. 6. We arrange the slices in the centre of a hot dish, cover the dish, and stand it in the oven to keep warm. 7. We take the boiled cabbage, put it on a board, chop it up in small pieces, and put it in the frying pan to fry, a few minutes. We must stir it, and not let it burn, or stick to the pan. N.B.—If there are any remains of cold boiled carrots ox parsnips, they could be chopped up and warmed in a saucepan with about § 02. of clarified dripping. 8. For serving, we put the fried cabbage, and carrots or parsnips round the dish, and the slices of meat in the centre.

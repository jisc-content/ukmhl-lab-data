Lessons on Cooking Meat.—Calf s-head. 159 9. We. put the rolled head, bones, and tongue into a large saucepan, and cover them with cold water, we also add a tablespoonful of salt. 10. We put the saucepan on the fire, and when it comes to the boil, we must skim it carefully with a spoon, and then move the saucepan to the side of the fire, to simmer gently for two hours. 11. While the head is cooking we should prepare the sauce. We want one gill of brown sauce (see “ Sauces,” Lesson No. 2), and a gill of Tomato sauce (see“ Sauces,” Lesson No. 6). N.B.—If liked, the Tomato Sauce might be omitted. 12. We mix the sauces together, add a few grams of Cayenne pepper, and salt to taste, and pour it into a stew- pan, put the lid on, and stand it by the side of the fire, to keep warm till required for use. 13. Half an hour before the head is finished, we wash the brains in cold water (removing all skin), and put them into the saucepan with the head, to cook for ten minutes. 14. We take the remaining bread crumbs and put them on a plate in the oven to brown. N.B.—We must be careful they do not get burnt. 15. We now take the tongue, and brains out of the saucepan, and cut them in small pieces. 16. We break one egg on a plate, and beat it slightly. 17. We take the rolled head out of the saucepan, take off the cloth, and place it in the middle of a hot dish, egg it over with the egg, and then cover it with the browned bread crumbs. 18. We put the tongue and brains round the head, and pour the sauce round. It is now ready for serving. 19. We pour the stock through a strainer into a basin and stand it aside to get cold. N.B.—This stock should be used for mock turtle soup (see “ Soups,” Lesson No. 7, from paragraph 7) ; the remains of the calf s-head, after serving, can be used for the soup, the forcemeat should be removed, and can be used for the balls, and the flesh should be cut up in small pieces and put in the soup.

150 National Framing School for Cookery. lemon rind and nutmeg (as much as would cover one side of a 3d. piece), we season it with pepper and salt to taste, add one egg, and mix all well together with a wooden spoon. 8. We fill the inside of the rabbit with this stuffing, and sew it up with string. 9. For trussing it, we place it on a board, cut off the fore joints of the shoulders and legs, press the legs close to the body on either side, and pass a skewer through each to secure them : draw back the head between the shoulders, and pass a skewer through to keep it back. 10. We grease a piece of paper with some clarified dripping or butter, and wrap it round the rabbit, to prevent it burning; we put it on a tin with about an ounce of clarified dripping. 11. We put the tin in a hot oven to bake for about one hour; we must watch it frequently and baste it well; a few minutes before it is done, we should remove the buttered paper, and sprinkle over the rabbit about a quarter of a saltspoonful of salt, and baste it well. 12. While the rabbit is baking we should make the sauce: we take one small onion and a shalot, peel them, cut them in slices, and put them in a stewpan with one ounce of butter. 13. We put the pan over the fire, and let the onion fry for about three minutes ; it must not burn. 14. We now add one ounce of flour, and stir it well; we pour in half a pint of stock, and stir well till it boils and thickens; we season it with pepper and salt to taste, and move the stewpan to the side of the fire to keep warm. N.B.â€”If mushrooms can be obtained they would improve the sauce: about six would be wanted, well washed, peeled, and cut in quarters, added to the sauce, and stewed in it gently for ten minutes. 15. For serving, we take the rabbit out of the oven, place it on a hot dish, carefully remove the skewers, and pour the sauce through a strainer over the rabbit.

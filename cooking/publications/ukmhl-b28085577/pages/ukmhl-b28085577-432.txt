INGREDIENTS. d. 2 oz. of pearl barley oj The rind of a quarter of a lemon oj 2 lumps of loaf sugar o| 1 Time required, about one hour. For Making Thick Barley Water (about one pint). d. 2 oz. of pearl barley o| The rind of half a lemon o| Sugar oj Time required, about two hours. Now we will show you how to make two kinds of Barley Water—Clear Barley Water and thick Barley Water. For half a pint of clear barley water:— 1. We take two ounces of pearl barley, and wash it well in two or three waters. 2. We put a kettle of water on the fire to boil. 3. We take a quarter of a lemon, wipe it clean in a cloth, and peel it very thinly. N.B.—We must be careful, in peeling the lemon, not to cut any of the white skin, as it would make it bitter. 4. We put the washed barley into a jug. 5. We put in the lemon peel and two lumps of loaf sugar. 6. When the water in the kettle is quite boiling, we pour one pint of it on to the barley in the jug.

Now we will show you how to make a Mince, served with Mashed Potatoes. 1. We take one pound and a half of potatoes, wash them well in cold water, and scrub them clean with a scrubbing brush. 2. We take a sharp knife, peel them, and carefully cut out the eyes and any black specks about the potato. 3. We put them into a saucepan with cold water, enough to cover them, and sprinkle over them one teaspoonful of salt. 4. We put the saucepan on the fire to boil the potatoes for, from twenty mimttes to half an hoitr. 5. We should take a fork and put it into the potatoes, to feel if the centre is quite tender. 6. When they are sufficiently boiled, we drain off all the water, and stand the saucepan by the side of the fire, with the lid half on, to steam the potatoes. 7. We put one ounce of butter, and one tablespoonful of milk into a small saucepan, and put it on the fire to boil. 8. When the potatoes have become quite dry, we should take the saucepan off the fire and stand it on a piece of paper on the table.

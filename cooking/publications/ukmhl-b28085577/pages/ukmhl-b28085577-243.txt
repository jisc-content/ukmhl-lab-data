Lessons on Cooking Fish.—Boiled Fish. 239 FISH. Lesson No. 14. BOILED FISH. Average cost of the Sauce to be served with boiled fish (about half a pint). INGREDIENTS. d. 1 oz. of but ter i | oz. flour oj Anchovy sauce or lemon juice o£ 1* Time required for boiling fish, about twenty minutes to three quarters of an kourt according to the size of the fish. Now we will show you how to Boil Fisk. 1. We put a saucepan or fish-kettle of water on the fire to boil. 2. We take the fish and clean it thoroughly in cold water. 3. When the water is warm, we put in the fish on a strainer or a plate (there should be sufficient water just to cover the fish.) N.B.—For salmon the water must be boiling, but for all other fish it should only be warm water. 4. We also put in some salt, enough to make the water taste salt. 5. We put the lid on the saucepan, and move it to the side of the fire to simmer gently for from twenty minutes to three-quarters of an hour (according to the size of the fish). 6. We must watch it and skim it occasionally. 7. When we find that the skin of the fish is cracking, we shall know that it is sufficiently boiled. While the fish is boiling we make Melted Butter sauce (see “ Sauces,” Lesson No. 7).

Lessons on Cooking Meat.—Roasting. 19 joint, we must sprinkle about a saltspoonful of salt over it, and then baste it well. 20. We must take a large dish and warm it well. 21. Now we can take the hook of the jack, and place the joint on to the hot dish, and draw out the hook. 22. We take about a gill of hot stock and pour it into the dish. [This makes the gravy, and when the joint is cut, the juices from the meat will add to it.] 23. We must take a piece of demy paper and cut it like a fringe. This we put round the end of the knuckle bone. N.B.—The dripping in the pan should be poured into a basin, and when it is cold there will be under the cruet °f dripping a good gravy. When the dripping is required for use it must be carefully removed from the top of the gravy, and clarified. (See Lesson on “Frying.”) Nearly all joints can be roasted in this way. Attention should be paid to the rules explained above concerning joints of meat without bone. 1

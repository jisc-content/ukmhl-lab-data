INGREDIENTS. d. \ lb. of flour, Salt | pint milk . 2 eggs 2 5 lb. fruit oj \ oz. butter o| Sugar . Oj Si Time required, about forty minutes. Now we will show you how to make a Batter Pudding with fruit in it. 1. We take a quarter of a pound of floitr and put it in a basin. 2. We add a quarter of a teaspoonful of salt. 3. We stir in gradually half a pint of milk. 4. When it has become sufficiently liquid, we should beat it with a spoon instead of stirring it, as that will make it lighter. 5. We break an egg into a cup, and then add it to the batter, beating it up lightly all the time, until it is thoroughly mixed. 6. We then break a second egg into the cup and add it to the batter, mixing it thoroughly as before. N.B.—Eggs should always be broken separately into a cup to see if they are good before cooking. The more the batter is beaten the lighter it becomes. 7. We take a pint and a half pie-dish and grease it well inside with butter. 8. We pour the batter into the pie-dish.

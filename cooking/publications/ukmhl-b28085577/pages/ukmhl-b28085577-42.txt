38 National Training School for Cookery. take away the stalks, and rub the leaves through a strainer,, or chop them up finely on a board. N.B.—The stalks of the herbs are bitter to taste, and can therefore only be- used for flavouring, and not for eating. 8. We put the meat, suet, and two tablespoonsful of bread crumbs into a basin, and mix them together. 9. We now add the herbs, half an ounce of flour, and a teaspoonful of salt. N.B.—If liked, a little chopped onion or chopped lemon peel might be added. 10. We add one gill of stock to the basin, and mix all' together lightly. 11. We take a board, flour it, and turn the mixture on- to it. 12. We also flour our hands, to prevent the mixture from- sticking. 13. We form the mixture into little balls, and we should sprinkle a little flour over them. 14. We break an egg on to a plate, and beat it very slightly with a knife. 15. We put the balls into the egg, and egg them well all over. 16. We now put them into the bread crumbs and cover them well, but not too thickly. N.B.—We must be careful to finger them as little as possible. 17. We put the rissoles into a frying basket, a few at a time, as they must not touch each other. 18. When the fat in the saucepan is quite hot and smoking, we put in the frying basket, and let the rissoles fry a pale brown. 19. If there is not sufficient fat to cover the rissoles, we must shake the basket occasionally, that they may get fried on all sides alike. N.B.—If there be no frying-basket, we should carefully put the rissoles into the fat with a spoon, and then we must turn them over, so as to get them equally browned. 20. We put a piece of kitchen paper on a plate. 21. When the rissoles are fried, we turn them carefully on to the paper to drain off the grease. 22. For serving, we put them on a hot dish.

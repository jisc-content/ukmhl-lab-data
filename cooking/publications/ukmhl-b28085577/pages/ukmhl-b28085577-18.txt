14 National Training School for Cookery. 7. When the black lead is dry, we brush it all over with a dry brush. 8. We then take another brush, and polish the range all over, so as to make it quite bright. N.B.—The bars of the stove should be done in the same way. 9. We take the sweeps brush, and sweep the remaining soot and dust from the stove, and thfe hearth. 10. We polish the steel handles and bolts of the oven, by rubbing them with emery paper. 11. The brass handles and bolts we should polish, with bath brickdust and a leather. 12. We get a flannel and a pail of hot water, put in it some soda, and wash the hearth all over. N.B.—We must not wet it too much. 13. We take a hearthstone, and rub it all over the hearth. 14. We then wring the flannel out in the hot water, and smooth the hearth over, rubbing it lightly all in one direction. 15. We must black-lead and polish the inside of the fender, in the same way as we did the range, and brighten the rim of it by rubbing it with emery paper. TO LAY A FIRE. 1. We should place a few sifted cinders at the bottom of the grate. 2. We then put in a piece of crumpled paper, and arrange the sticks over it, laying them across each other. 3. We now put a few pieces of coal on the top, rather to the front, so as to leave a good draught at the back to draw the fire. 4. When the fire has lighted, and has burned up a little, we can add more sifted cinders mixed with the coal. 5. We should only put small quantities of coal and cinders on the fire at a time.

Lessons on Cleaning. i6 TO CLEAN AN IRON SAUCEPAN. 1. We should wash the saucepan well, in hot water and soda. N.B.—-All the black should be removed, from the outside and bottom. 2. We must soap the palm of one hand, and rub the inside of the saucepan. N.B.—In washing any greasy utensil, it is best if possible, to use the hand instead of a flannel, as the latter retains the grease and so keeps putting the grease on again, instead of rubbing it off. 3. We mix some sand and powdered soda together, and then dip the soap into it, and rub the inside of the sauce- pan until it is quite clean and bright. 4. We now rinse it in water, and dry it with a cloth. 5. We should clean the lid in the same way. N.B.—A white enamelled stewpan is cleansed in the same way, great care should be taken to remove all the stains off the white enamel inside. N.B.—Salt might be mixed with the sand, and used to remove the stains from the enamel. TO CLEAN A COPPER STEWPAN. 1. We mix some sand and salt together on a plate, half the quantity of salt to that of sand. 2. We wash the stewpan well in hot water and soda. 3. We soap the hand, dip it in the salt and sand, and rub the inside of the pan, until all stains are removed, and it has become clean and bright. 4. We rinse it out well in the water, dry the inside quickly, and then turn over the pan, and clean the copper outside. 5. We should rub it in the same way with a soaped hand, dipped in sand and salt. N.B.—If there are many stains on it, an old half lemon, or vinegar, might be used to remove them. N.B.—Only the copper part should be cleaned with lemon or vinegar. 6. We now rinse it again thoroughly, and dry it quickly with a cloth.

130 National Training School for Cookery, PORK PIE. Average cost of “Pork Pie * (1 lb.) INGREDIENTS. s. d. £ lb. lard o 3 1 lb. pork (either loin or leg) o 10 Seasoning o oj x lb. of flour o 2 1 egg o 1 1 4-1- Time required two hours and a half. Now we will show you how to make a Pork Pie. 1. We put a quarter of a pound of lard and a quarter of a pint of cold water into rather a large saucepan. 2. We put the saucepan on the fire to boil. N. B.—We must watch it, as if it boils over it will catch fire. 3. We take one pound of lean pork (cut either from the loin or from the leg), put it on a board, and cut it up in pieces of about one inch square. 4. We put one pound of flour into a basin. 5. When the lard and water are quite boiling, we pour them into the middle of the flour and mix them well with a spoon. 6. When the paste is cool enough we should knead it well with our hands. N.B.—More water must not be added, as the paste is required to be rather stiff. 7. We take the paste out of the basin, and put it on a floured board. 8. We cut off* a quarter of the paste, and the remainder we mould into the shape of a basin, pressing it inside with one hand and supporting it outside with the other. 9. We should shape it as evenly as possible, and it should be about one-third of an inch in thickness all round. 10. We should take a knife, flour it, and cut the top of the shape level all round.

8o National Training School for Cookery. 6. We now add the stock, and stir again smoothly, until it boils and thickens. 7. We move the stewpan to the side of the fire, and stir in two tablespoonsful of cream. 8. We add one teaspoonful of lemon juice to the sauce. N.B.—We must be careful not to let any pips fall in. 9. We season the sauce with pepper, and salt according to taste, and, if liked, we might grate about half a saltspoonful of nutmeg into it. 10. We now stir in the minced chicken, ham, and mush- rooms until all are well mixed together. 11. We take a plate, and turn the contents of the stew- pan on to it. 12. We take a piece of kitchen paper, cut it to the size of the plate, butter it, and lay it on the top of the mixture, and stand the plate aside to cool. 13. When the mixture is cold,’ we put one pound and a half of lard,' or clarified dripping in a deep stewpan, and put it on the fire to heat. 14. We take some crumb of bread, and rub it through a wire sieve on to a piece of paper. 15. If rissoles are required, we put four ounces of flour on a board, and rub into it three ounces of butter, until both are thoroughly mixed, and there are no lumps remaining. 16. We mix the flour and butter into a stiff smooth paste with cold water. 17. We take a rolling-pin, flour it, sprinkle some flour over the board, and roll the paste out into as thin a sheet as possible. 18. We flour our hands, dip a knife in flour (to prevent any sticking), and form the chicken mixture into any fancy shapes for croquettes, either in balls or long rolls, &c., or we can roll it in the paste for rissoles. 19. We break an egg on to a plate, and beat it up slightly with a knife.

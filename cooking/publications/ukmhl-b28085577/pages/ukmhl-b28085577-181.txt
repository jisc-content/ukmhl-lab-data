L essons on Making Soup. —Bonne Femme Soup. 177 9. We take apint and a half of zvhite stock (see “ Lesson on Stock ”) and put it in another saucepan. 10. We put the saucepan on the fire to boil. 11. We must now make a “ liaison.” 12. We take the yolks of three eggs, put them in a basin, and beat them well. 13. We stir in one gill (quarter of a pint) of cream or milk. 14. We take a French roll and cut off all the crust. 15. We put the crust on a tin, and put it in the oven to dry for a minute or two. 16. When the stock is quite boiling, we pour it into the stewpan with the vegetables, and let all boil gently for ten minutes until the vegetables are quite tender. 17. We now stir in the liaison, straining it through a. hair-sieve into the stewpan. 18. We stand the stewpan by the side of the fire to keep- warm until required for use. N.B.—We must not let it boil as, now the "liaison " is added, it would curdle. 19. We take the tin out of the oven and turn the dried crust on to a board. 20. We cut this crust up into small pieces, or in any fancy shapes, according to taste. 21. We place these pieces of crust in a hot soup tureen and pour the soup over them. It is then ready for serving.

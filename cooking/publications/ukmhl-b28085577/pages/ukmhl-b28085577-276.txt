We season it with salt according to taste, and Cayenne pepper (enough to cover very thinly half the top of a three- penny piece). 5. We must stir continually until it thickens, and we must not let the sauce boil or it will curdle. 6. Just before the sauce is finished we stir in two tea- spoonsful of lemon juice. 7. We pour the sauce into a hot sauce-boat and it is then ready for serving.

N.B.—We must be careful that the sugar is quite dissolved, that there be no lumps left. 9. We then stand the stewpan on a piece of paper on the table. 10. We put the yolks of four eggs into a basin (the whites we should put aside, as they are not required for present use). 11. We pour the coloured milk into the eggs, stirring well all the time. 12. We stir the milk and eggs into the ingredients in the basin. 13. We also add one gill (a quarter of a pint) of cream. 14. We take a pint and a half mould and butter it inside. 15. We pour the pudding into the mould. 16. We butter a piece of kitchen paper and lay it over the top of the mould. 17. When the water in the saucepan is quite boiling, we place in the mould to steam (the water should only reach half way up the mould, or it will boil over and get into the pudding). 18. We let the pudding steam for one hour and a half. 19. For serving, we take the buttered paper off from the top of the mould, and turn the pudding out carefully on to a hot dish. N.B.—German Sauce (see “ Puddings,” Lesson No. io) can be served with the pudding if liked, either poured round it, or served separately in a sauceboat.

Now we will show you how to dress a Caulifloiver. 1. We take a cauliflower and wash it well in two or three waters, and take a knife, and cut off the end of the stalk and any withered outside leaves. 2. We put it in a basin of cold water, with a dessertspoon- fid of salt, and let it stand for two or three minutes. 3. We take a large saucepan full of water, and put it on the fire to boil. 4. When the water is quite boiling we put in a table- spoon fid of salt. 5. We take the cauliflower out of the salt and water, and place it in the saucepan with the flower downwards, and let it boil till it is quite tender for from fifteen to twenty minutes. 6. We must take it carefully out with a slice, and feel the centre of the flower with our finger, to see that it is quite tender. 7. After that time we take it out of the saucepan, and put it on a sieve to drain. 8. For serving, we place it on a hot vegetable dish.

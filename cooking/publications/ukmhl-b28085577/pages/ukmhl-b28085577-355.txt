INGREDIENTS. d. 1 lb. of patent flour \ Water j 3 3 Time required, about half-an-hour. Now we will show you how to make Norfolk Dumplings. 1. We put a saucepan of warm water on the fire to boil. 2. We put one pound of patent flour into a basin. 3. We add to it enough cold water to make it into a smooth dough;—it must not be too stiff. 4. We form this dough into round balls about the size of a large egg. N.B.—This quantity will make about ten dumplings. 5. When the water in the saucepan is quite boiling, we put in the dumplings, and let them boil for twenty minutes. 6. After that time we take them out of the saucepan, and they are then ready for serving.

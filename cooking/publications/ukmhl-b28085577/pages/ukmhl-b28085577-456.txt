Now we will show you how to fry sweetbreads. N.B.—Calves’ heart, or throat sweetbreads are what are ordinarily sold, lambs’ sweetbreads are more tender and delicate. 1. We take the sweetbreads and put them into a sauce- pan, with luke-warm water enough to cover them ; put the saucepan over the fire, and just bring it to the boil. N.B.—This is to blanch them, and should be done as soon as the sweetbreads arrive, in order to prevent their turning sour. 2. We take the sweetbreads out of the saucepan, lay them in a cloth, and gently wipe them; then put them on a board, and cut them in slices about half an inch thick. N.B.—If the sweetbread is small it can be fried whole. Lambs’ sweetbread need not be cut up. 3. We proceed with the siveetbreads as described in “Fish, Lesson No. 7,” from note 27 to end, excluding Notes 32, 33, and 40.

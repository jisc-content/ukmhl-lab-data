We sprinkle over it pepper and salt and two or three grains of cayenne pepper, according to taste ; or, about half a teaspoonful of mustard might be mixed with it. 11. We stir part of the grated cheese into the maccaroni and the remainder we sprinkle over the top. 12. We take one ounce of butter, cut it in small pieces, and put these pieces of butter about on the top of the maccaroni. 13. We put the dish in the oven (the thermometer at the oven door should rise to 240Â°), or in a Dutch oven before the fire for ten minutes; it should become a pale brown. 14.

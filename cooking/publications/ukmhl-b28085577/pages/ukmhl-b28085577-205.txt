Lessons on Making Soup.—Macaroni Soup. 20 r 7. We take two onions, peel them, and stick two cloves into one onion. N.B.—The outer skins of the onions can be put into a saucepan by the side of the fire to brown; when browned, they are useful for colouring gravies and soups. 8. We should skim the soup well and then put in the vegetables ; we also add a blade of mace and a teaspoonful of peppercorns. 9. We must move the saucepan to the side of the tire, and let it simmer gently for two hours and a half. 10. We should raise the lid slightly to let out the steam. N.B.—It is better to boil maccaroni separately, as the first water is not clean. The soup can be thickened with maccaroni, vermicelli, barley, or rice. 11. If the soup is thickened with maccaroni, we should put a saucepan of water on the fire to boil. 12. When the water is quite boiling we put in a quarter of a pound of maccaroni, and sprinkle about half a saltspoon- ful of salt over it. 13. We put the saucepan on the fire, and let it boil until the maccaroni is quite tender; it will take about half an hour. 14. We should feel the maccaroni with our fingers, to see that it is quite soft, and tender. 15. When it is sufficiently boiled, we turn it into a colander, to strain the water off, then pour some cold water on it, and wash the maccaroni again. 16. We put the maccaroni on a board, and cut it into small pieces about a quarter of an inch in length, it is then ready to be put into the soup. N.B.—If barley is used instead of maccaroni, it will take a much longer time to boil, but if vermicelli is used, it takes a very short time to boil. 17. When the soup is ready for use, we should put the maccaroni into a soup tureen, and strain the hot soup over it. It is then ready for serving.

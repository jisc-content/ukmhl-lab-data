Cooking Meat.—(Entries.)—Curried Rabbit. 83 '8. We put the butter back into the stewpan. 9. We now put in the pieces of meat, put the stewpan over a quick fire, and let it fry for ten minutes. 10. We must watch it and turn the pieces of meat occa- sionally, so that they are fried on both sides alike. 11. We take an apple, peel it, cut out the core, and chop it up as finely as possible on a board. 12. When the meat is fried we add to it two tablespoons- ful of curry powder, and half a teaspoonfid of salt, and stir well over the fire for five minutes. 13. We then put in the fried onions, the chopped apple, and one pint of good stock. 14. We move the stewpan to the side of the fire and let it simmer gently for two hours. 15. After that time we stir in one gill (quarter of a pint) ■of cream. 16. We take a lemon, wipe it clean with a cloth, and peel it as thinly as possible with a sharp knife (the peel we should put aside as it is not required for present use). 17. We cut the lemon in half, and squeeze the juice of it through a strainer into the stewpan. 18. For serving we take the pieces of meat out of the stewpan and arrange them nicely on a hot dish, and pour the sauce over the meat. N.B.—Boiled rice (see Lesson on ** Rice ”) should be served with the curry.

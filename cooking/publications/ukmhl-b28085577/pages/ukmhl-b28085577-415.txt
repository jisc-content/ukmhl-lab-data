Now we will show you how to make Ginger-bread Nuts. 1. We put one pound of flour into a basin with about half a saltspoonful of salt. 2. We also add half an ounce of ground ginger, three ounces of moist sugar, one teaspoonful of carbonate of soda, and allspice (about as much as will cover a threepenny piece). 3. We put half a pound of treacle and four ounces of butter into a saucepan, and melt them together over the fire. 4. We mix the ingredients together with two tablespoons- ful of milk, and then add the melted treacle and the four ounces of butter, and mix all well together into a firm paste. N.B.—We should be very careful that all the ingredients are well mixed and that there are no lumps left. 5. We flour a board and turn the paste out on to it. 6.

They are then ready for serving.

BREAKFAST DISHES. 40 H^rd-boiled Eggs and White Sauce. Hard-boil six fresh eggs, quarter, and place them on a dish. Make a white sauce by putting half an ounce of butter into a stew-pan, and when it is melted put in one ounce of flour, stirring it well for ten minutes; then add one gill of cream and half a tea- cupful of milk. Take one dozen button mushrooms and peel them and wash them, put them in a stew-pan with a piece of butter the size of a nut, squeeze over them a teaspoonful of lemon juice and a tablespoonful of cold water; put it on the fire and just bring it to a boil, first adding minced parsley and salt to taste. The sauce is then strained over the hard-boiled eggs, and the dish is served very hot. If more sauce is needed, use a little white stock to mix with the other. Sardines on Toast. Cut some toast into long pieces the length of a sardine and a trifle wider; butter, spread with anchovy paste; split a sardine and take out the backbone, lay a half on each piece of toast, and heat through. Oatmeal Cakes. Melt three ounces of lard in a saucepan. Take seven ounces of flour and three ounces of oatmeal, a tablespoonful of salt, and a quarter of a teaspoonful of carbonate of soda; mix with a spoon, stir in the melted lard. Break an egg into a tablespoonful of water and beat together. Pour this into the flour mixture and stir well together. Turn the paste on a board.

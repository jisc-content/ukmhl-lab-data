BREAKFAST. DISHES. 7 Fleed Cakes. Fleecl is to be bought from any pork butcher. Two • pounds of hour, one and a quarter pounds of heed, six ounces of butter; baked ten to fifteen minutes. Potted Pheasant, Lobster, or Liver. Roast the birds as for table, but let them be thoroughly done, for if the gravy be left in, the meat ■will not keep half so well. Raise the flesh of the breast, wings, and merrythought quite clear from the bones; take off the skin; mince, and then pound it very smoothly with about one-third of its weight of fresh butter, or something less, if the meat should appear of a proper consistence without the full quan- tity ; season it with salt, mace, and cayenne only, and add these in small portions until the meat is rather highly flavoured with both the last. Proceed with it as with other potted meats. Kedgeree. Half a pound of dried haddock, quarter of a pound of rice, two eggs, two ounces of butter, white pepper, and anchovy sauce. Throw the well washed rice into boiling water, and allow to boil for twenty minutes, then put into a sieve and turn a tap of cold water on it for two minutes to separate the grains, drain and put in a saucepan before the fire (without a lid) to dry. Melt two ounces of butter in a sauce- pan, stir in one ounce of fine flour, add three quarters of a pint of milk, stir till smooth; add a teaspoonful of anchovy sauce, the whites of two eggs chopped into large slices. Cut up tho fish, add it, also the rice, season with white pepper; stir over the fire till hot, pile on a dish, and garnish with the yolks of two eggs grated over the top of the pile, and tufts of green fried parsley round the base.

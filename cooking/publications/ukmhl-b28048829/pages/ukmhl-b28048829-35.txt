To this is added one pound of Â«ugar and the rind of a lemon grated; mix the two together, and leave it until the rhubarb is cooked. Have a large tin sauce- pan full of boiling water, and put the rhubarb in and stir it with a wooden spoon; the cover is put on, and for five minutes it may be left. When the cover is taken off, the rhubarb must not be left till it is done. It must be quickly turned with the spoon so as not to break the rhubarb. The moment it boils it softens; in about three minutes this happens, accord- ing as to whether the rhubarb is old or young. Strain it off quickly, only leaving a little juice to serve with it.

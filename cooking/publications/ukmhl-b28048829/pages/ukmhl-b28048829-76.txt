BREAKFAST DISHES. 62 chopped, some salt and pepper, half a cupful of milk, one egg, and two tablespoonfuls of butter. Boil milk before adding meat, rice, and seasoning; add the egg last of all when almost cold. Shape into balls and fry. Aspic Jelly. Stew two pounds of knuckle veal or mutton, put the meat into a stew-pan that shuts very closely, with two slices of ham, a bunch of sweet herbs, a blade of mace, one onion, the peel of half a lemon, a tea- spoonful of bruised Jamaica pepper, the same of whole pepper, salt to taste, and three pints of water. As soon as it boils skim it clean and let it simmer till quite strong and rich; dissolve one ounce of isin- glass in it when boiling. Strain it, and when cold take off the fat with a spoon. Then lay over it a clean piece of blotting-paper, and remove all parti- cles of grease. When cold boil it a few minutes with the whites 'of two well-beaten eggs and their shells. Take it off the fire, let it stand to settle, and pour it through a jelly-bag into a plain mould or basin that has first been dipped in water. Let it stand all night, and next morning turn it out of the mould by dipping the bottom in cold water. Orna- ment with green parsley and serve on a dish.

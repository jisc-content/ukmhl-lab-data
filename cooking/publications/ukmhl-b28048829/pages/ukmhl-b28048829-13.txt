Vll PREFACE. • • The compiler of this little hook has selected January, February, and March, the three first months of the year, because in them it is possible to get more variety of food than in any other three consecutive months, i.e. game, spring poultry, lamb, trout, sal- mon, &c. Mushrooms and tomatoes can be bought pickled, forced, or in tins ; all the other things given will be found to be in season during the months named. At the same time, the dishes given will be found, with the exception of pork in the summer months, and oysters in May, June, and July, to be obtainable at any other time of the year, excepting, of course, game. To an intelligent cook the receipts given, and the daily arrangement of breakfasts for three months, will suggest other dishes that will be equally suitable, or she will observe that other material prepared in the same way, when that given is out of season, will answer her purpose.

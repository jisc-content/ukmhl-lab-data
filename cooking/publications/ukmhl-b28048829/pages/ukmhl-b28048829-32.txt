BREAKFAST DISHES. i8 Sausages and Mashed Potatoes. Prick the sausages with a fork, and put them into a frying-pan with a small piece of butter. Keep moving the pan about and turn the sausages two or three times. In twelve minutes they will be cooked. Have ready some smoothly mashed potatoes, and place the sausages on it and serve very hot. Strawberry Jam or Apricot. Strip the stalks from some strawberries, weigh and boil them for thirty-jive minutes, keeping them very constantly stirred; throw in eight ounces of good sugar beaten small, to a pound of fruit; mix them well before putting on the fire again, and then boil quickly for twenty-five minutes. Scones. Mix into a smooth paste with half a pint of milk one pound of flour, half an ounce of cream of tartar, a quarter of an ounce of carbonate of soda, and one ounce of sugar. Pub three ounces of butter into the flour with the hands. Poll the mixture to insure the butter being well mixed with the flour. Poll the paste out to a sheet of one-third of an inch in thick- ness. Cut the paste into triangular pieces, each side about four inches long. Plour a tin and put the scones into it and bake them directly in an oven (240Â°) for forty minutes.

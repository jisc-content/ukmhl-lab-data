33 BREAKFAST DISHES. carrot, and two dozen button mushrooms, four cloves, a dozen and a half peppercorns, a bay leaf, two sprigs of thyme, a good bit of parsley. Stew these over a gentle fire, stirring and shaking them often ; then mix well with them a dessertspoonful of flour and let it take a little colour. Next add by degrees three- quarters of a pint of veal stock, and half a pint of sherry or Madeira. When this is done put in the bodies of the birds and boil for an hour and a quarter. Strain and clear the sauce quite from fat, pour it on the joints of game, heat them in it slowly, and when they are on the point of boiling dish them immedi- ately, with delicately fried sippets round the dish. Bloaters in Batter. Cut the heads and tails off two bloaters, split them open, and remove the backbones. Make half a pint of French batter, pour half of it into a greased frying- pan, lay in the bloaters with a little mustard rubbed over them, pour in the rest of the batter, and fry. Broiled Mackerel, whole. Empty and cleanse a large fresh mackerol, opening it as little as possible; hang it in a cool air till stiff. Make an incision with a sharp knife the whole length of the fish on either side of the backbone, and with a feather put in some cayenne and fine salt mixed with a few drops of pure salad oil. Lay the fish, wrapped in thickly buttered writing-paper, over a moderate fire on a well-heated gridiron which has been rubbed with r/uet; loose it gently should it stick, and when done equally on both sides turn the back to the fire. Half an hour will broil it well. D

BREAKFAST DISHES. 54 Deviled Biscuits, Take some milk biscuits, soak them in clarified butter or oil. Then rub them with a little curry- powder, ketcliup, some salt and pepper. Toast them on a gridiron over a clear fire. Serve very liot. Tomatoes Scalloped. Put six tomatoes through a sieve, add one cup of breadcrumbs, one teaspoonful of sugar, one of salt, one of pepper, a piece of butter the size of an egg. Butter a scallop-dish and bake in a quick oven. American Waffles. Boil one cup of rice quite soft. Take two table- spoonfuls of flour, two eggs, two tablespoonfuls of milk ; beat to a smooth \iaste ; keep till cold. Well grease the waffle-irons, pour in some of the mixture, and when done on both sides put on a warm plate and butter. Serve them very hot. A Potato Souffle. Mix into a smooth paste four dessertspoonfuls of well-boiled potato and one of flour with milk; then pour in the rest of the pint, salt and pepper it, and then put it into a very clean stew-pan with an ounce and a half of fresh butter. Stir it over a clear fire until it is of the consistency of cream, then add the yolks of six well-beaten eggs, and then stir in the whites. When whisked stiff enough to bear the weight of an egg, pour it into the souffle-dish, and bake it in a moderate oven. When done, hold a salamander over it for a few minutes, and serve with a napkin pinned round the mould.

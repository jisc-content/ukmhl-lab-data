PREFACE. vi of receipts are given for each breakfast, that if some are not suitable there are others which are emi- nently so. For instance, on January 1st pheasant rissoles are recommended, but as well there are receipts for kidneys a la maitre dâ€™kotel, potted shrimps, but- tered eggs, and quince marmalade, surely some of which dishes would not be beyond the most limited means. It will be found that some things, such as sweet- breads, for instance, are very expensive in London ; but on the other hand the writer knows places in the country where they are so little thought of as to be given away by the butcher with other meat that may be bought of him. Oysters, which are largely used in the breakfast dishes of this little book, can be bought at a cheap rate in tins, as well as lobster, and it will be found that the dishes prepared from them are almost as delicious as if made with the more costly article. If anyone has a prejudice against tinned food, as some have, let them, if they cannot manage the fresh article, pass that dish over, and content themselves with others they feel able to afford. Again, it may be contended that some of the dishes are too heavy and substantial for breakfast. Let it be pointed out that tastes differ in that respect, as in all others; and, moreover, what is a sufficient breakfast for a man whose occupation is sedentary, would be a very inadequate one for another whose days are spent in the open air, whether riding, shooting, fishing, or walking.

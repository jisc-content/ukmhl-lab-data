It will prove incomparably superior to a ham boiled in the usual way. To Bake a Ham. A ham for baking should be well soaked; then wipe it dry, then trim away any rusty places under- neath, and cover it with a common crust, taking care that this is of sufficient thickness all over to keep the gravy in. Place it in a moderately-heated oven, and bake for nearly four hours. Take off the crust and skin, and cover with raspings, the same as for boiled ham, and garnish the knuckle with a paper frill. This method of cooking a ham is, by many persons, considered far superior to boiling it, as it cuts fuller of gravy, and has a finor flavour, besides keoping a much longer time good. Duck Olives. Cut into two joints the legs of a cold duck or chicken; take off the drumsticks; mix half a teaspoonful of pepper with five or six teaspoonfuls of breadcrumbs, some mixed herbs, a very finely chopped onion, and two teaspoonfuls of chopped parsley. Cut four thin slices of bacon, sprinkle with the crumbs, roll up each joint of fowl in the bacon, tie securely; make hot in a frying-pan or before the fire. Serve on a piece of fried toast.

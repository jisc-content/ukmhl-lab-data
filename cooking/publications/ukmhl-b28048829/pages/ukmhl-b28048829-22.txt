BREAKFAST DISHES. 8 Anchovy Toast. Toast some thin dry bread, which must be cut in oblongs about the length and breadth of a sardine ; cut it before the toast becomes brittle, and again place in the oven to become brittle and thoroughly crisp; spread with anchovy butter made by just cleaning three anchovies, pound them in a mortar with one ounce of butter, cayenne pepper, a little nutmeg, and a teaspoonful of anchovy sauce; rub through a hair sieve, and use as directed. Wash your anchovies, wipe with a cloth ; divide the fillets by splitting down the back with the finger and thumb of both hands. The fillets must then be placed on the toast like lattice-work. Garnish with hard- boiled egg chopped. To Poach Eggs. Take for this purpose a wide, delicately clean pan, about half filled with the clearest spring-water; throw in a small saltspoonful of salt, and place it over a fire quite free from smoke. Break some new- laid eggs into separate cups, and do this with care-, that the yolks may not be injured. When the water boils, draw back the pan, glide the eggs gently into it, and let them stand until the whites appear almost set, which will be in about a minute; then, without shaking them, move the pan over the fire, and just simmer them from two minutes and a half to three minutes. Lift them out sepa- rately with a slice, trim quickly off the ragged edges, and serve them upon toasted bread freed from crust and buttered.

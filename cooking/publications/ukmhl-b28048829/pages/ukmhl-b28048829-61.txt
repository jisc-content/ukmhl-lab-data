BREAKFAST DISHES. 47 roll and extract the crumb. Then put half a dozen oysters and some cold turbot (with the oystersâ€™ liquor) into a stew-pan with twTo ounces of butter, a teaspoonful of pepper, salt to taste, a teaspoonful of anchovy paste, and half the crumb from the loaves. Let them simmer for six minutes, and stir in a table- spoonful of cream. Fill directly the holes in the loaves. Fit the tops on again, and put them in an oven to crisp. Serve on a napkin. Fried Beef Kidney and Onion. Take a beef kidney, cut it in slices, not too thick, and let them soak in warm water for two hours and a half, changing the water twice to thoroughly cleanse them. Dredge a very little flour over these slices, and fry a nice brown in three ounces of butter ; add some slices of onion or not, as preferred, seasoning them well with pepper, salt, and mustard. Arrange them in a circle round a dish, and stir a teaspoonful of tomato sauce into a quarter of a pint of good gravy with a lump of sugar in it. Fillets de Boeuf aux Truffles. Cut out the inside of a sirloin of beef, beat it well to make it tender, cut it in slices, trimming them neatly; lay them in oil and let them soak for ten minutes, then fry in butter. Chop up some parsley, lemon thyme, half a shallot, and slice some truffles (that have been previously cleaned and brushed, boiled for twenty minutes in some good stock, quarter of a pint and half a pint of white wine, pepper and salt), and add fifteen drops of vinegar. Lay the herbs in the middle of the dish and the fillets round, and the truffles round the fillets.

Season with pepper very highly, and some salt, a tender beef- steak previously cut into pieces about half an inch square. Have ready the paste rolled out thin, about six inches long by three broad; place the meat on the crust and place another piece over it, pinching down the edges together. Brush over with egg, and bake. If pork is used, put a previously baked apple, minus core and skin, into each pasty with the cut-up meat. Salmon Outlets. Cut slices one inch thick and season very highly with pepper and salt (fresh ground pepper); butter a sheet of white paper, and lay each in a separate piece, with their ends twisted, and broil gently over a clear fire, and serve with caper sauce. Fried Smelts. Smelts should be very fresh. Do not wash them, but dry in a cloth, flour lightly, dip them in egg, sprinkle with very fine crumbs of bread, and put them in boiling lard for five minutes. Fry a pale brown. Dry them before the fire on a drainer. Crimped Skate. Clean, skin, and cut the fish into slices; have ready some highly salted water, in which boil the fish till it is done (about twenty minutes). The

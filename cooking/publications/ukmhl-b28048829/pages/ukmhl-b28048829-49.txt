BREAKFAST DISHES. 35 Fried Herrings. Serve them a light brown with fried sliced onions. Hot Crab. Pick the meat out of a crab, clear the shell from the head; then put the meat, with a tiny pinch of nutmeg, salt, a good bit of pepper, three spoonfuls of vinegar, some breadcrumbs, and a good bit of butter, into the shell again, set it before the fire, and brown with a salamander. Serve dry toast to eat it on. Scalloped Cod or Lobster. The remains of boiled cod must be cleared of bones and mixed with a cup of milk, one dessert- spoonful of flour, some anchovy sauce, one teaspoon- ful of vinegar, a very little mustard, a little cayenne, a little black pepper, and some pieces of butter. Grease some scallop-shells, put in the mixture, grate breadcrumbs over, and bake a nice brown for three- quarters of an hour. Bloaters and Crumbs. Cut off the head and tail of a bloater, split it open, and take out the backbone; sprinkle it with two spoonfuls of breadcrumbs, half a teaspoonful each of dry mustard and chopped parsley, a little onion, a few drops of Yorkshire relish. Put four pieces of butter on the top of bloater, and cook in an oven or before the fire.

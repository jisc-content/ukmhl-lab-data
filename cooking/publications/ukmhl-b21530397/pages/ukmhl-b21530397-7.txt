is thick. Wash the rumps with yolks of eggs well beater, and strew over them crumbs of bread, a little pepper and salt, chopped parsley, and thyme, and grated lemon-peel. Fry in butter of a fine brown. While the rumps are stewing, lard the kidneys, and put them to roast in a Dutch oven. When the rumps are fried, the grease must he drained before they are put on the dish, and the pan being cleared likewise from the fat, warm the rice in it. Lay the latter on the dish ; the rumps put round on the rice, the narrow ends towards the middle, and the kidneys, between. Garnish with hard eggs cut in half, the white being left on ; or with different coloured pickles. SCOTCH MUTTON BROTII. Soak a neck of mutton in water for an hour ; cut off the scrag, and put it into a stew-pot with two quarts of water. As soon as it boils, skim it well, and then simmer it an hour and a half, then take the best end of the mutton, cut it into pieces, (two bones in each,) take some of the fat off, and put as many as you think proper; skim the moment the fresh meat boils up, and every quarter of an hour afterwards. Have ready four or five carrots, the same number of turnips, and three onions, all cut, but not small: and put them in soon enough to get quite tender: add four large spoonful ot Scotch Barley, first wetted with cold water. The meat should stew three hours. Salt to taste, and serve all together. Twenty minutes before serving, put in some chopped parsley. It is an excellent winter dish.

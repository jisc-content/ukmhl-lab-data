To 1 6 pounds of gooseberries, allow six pounds ofloafsugar, and a gallon of spring-water, bruise the fruit, and let them lay in water 24 hours, often stirring it; then press out the liquor into a clean cask, and let it ferment: when it has ceased, hung it up and let it stand a month; then rack it into another cask for six weeks longer; and bottle it up with a lump of sugar in each bottle. DAMSON WINE. To two gallons of water, put eight pounds of Malaga raisins, and a quarter of a peck of bruised damsons; put them in a tub; cover them over; and stir it twice every day for a week ; draw it off and colour it; put it in a cask ; bung it up for a fortnight; and it will then be fit to bottle CHERRY WINE. Pull them from the stalks, and bruise them, but do not break the stones; press the juice from them through a hair-sieve, and to every quart of liquor, ;dlow half a pound of sugar: fill a clean cask with it, and let it ferment as long as it makes a noise in the cask ; bung it up for six weeks; bottle it off with a lump of sugar in each bottle. Should they then ferment with any violence, let them stand without corks awhile ; then cork them tight, and in three months it will be fit to drink. GINGER WINE.

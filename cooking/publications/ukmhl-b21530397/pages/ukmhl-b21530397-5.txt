5 easily kept hot. The longer kept after drying, the higher it will he; if hard, it may require soaking three or four hours. TO DRESS A HAUNCH OF MUTTON. Keep it as long as it can be preserved sweet by the different modes: let it be washed with warm milk and water, or vinegar, if necessary ; but when to be dressed, observe to wash it well, lest the out- side should have a bad flavour from keeping. Put a paste of coarse flour or strong paper, and fold the haunch in : set it a great distance from the fire, and allow proportionable time for the paste; don’t take it off till about thirty-five or forty minutes before serving, and then baste it continually. Bring the haunch nearer to the fire before yon take off the paste, and froth it up as yon would venison. A gravy must be made of a pound and a half of loin of old mutton, simmered in a pint of water to half, and no seasoning but salt: brown it with a little burnt sugar, and send it up in the dish; but there should be a good deal of gravy in the meat; for though long at the fire, the distance and cover- ing will prevent its roasting out.—Serve with cur- rant-jelly-sauce. TO ROAST A SADDLE OF MUTTON. Let it be well kept first. Raise the skin, and then skewer it on again ; take it off a quarter of an hour before serving, sprinkle it with some salt, baste it, and dredge it well with flour. The rump should be split, and skewered back on each side. The joint may be large or small according to the com- pany : it is the most elegant if the latter. Being broad it requires a high and strong fire.

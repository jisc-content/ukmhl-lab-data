b«ttom to the sided with egg, bringing the former rather further out, and pinching both together; put egg between the edges of the paste, to make it adhere at the sides. Fill your pie, and put on the cover, and pinch it and the side crust together. The same mode of uniting the paste is to be observed ifthe sides are pressed into a tin form, in which the paste must be baked, after it shall be filled and covered; but in the latter case, the tin should be buttered, and carefully taken off when done enough ; 3nd as the form usually makes the sides of a lighter colour than is proper, the paste should be put into the oven again for a quarter of an hour. With a leather, put egg over at first. BAKED APPLE PUDDING. Pare and quarter four large apples ; boil them tender, with the rind of a lemon, in so little water that, when done, none may remain; beat them quite fine in a mortar; add the crumb of a small roll, four ounces of butter melted, the yolks of five and whites of three eggs, juice of half a lemon, and sugar to taste ; beat altogether, and lay it in a dish with paste to turn out. BOILED BREAD PUDDING. Grate white bread; pour boiling milk over it> and cover close. When soaked an hour or two* eat it fine, and mix with it two or three eggs well eaten. Put it into a bason that will just hold it; e a floured cloth over it, and put it into boiling " ater.—Send it up with melted butter poured over. It may be eaten with salt or sugar. Pruncee, or French plutabs, make a fine pud- ding instead of raisins, either with suet or bread pudding.

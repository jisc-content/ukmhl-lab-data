DOMESTIC COOKERY. FISH. OBSERVATIONS ON DRESSING FISH. If (.he fishmonger does not clean it, fish is seldom very nicely done; hut those in great towns wash it beyond what is necessary for cleaning, and hy per- petual watering diminish the flavour. When quite clean, if to be boiled, some salt and a little vinegar should he put into the water to give firmness; hut end, whiting, and haddock, are far better if a little salted, and kept a day ; and if not very hot weather i they will he good two days. Those who know how to purchase fish, may, by taking more at a time than they want for one day, often get it cheap: and such kinds as will pot or pickle, or keep hy being sprinkled with salt and hung up, or by being fried, 'will serve for stewing the next day, may then he bought with advantage. Fresh-water fish has often a muddy smell and taste, to take off which, soak it in strong salt and water after it is nicely cleaned ; or if of a size to hear it, scald it in the same ; then dry and dress it. TO BOIL SALMON. Clean it carefully, boil it gently, and take it out of the water as soon as done. Let the water he warm if the fish he split. If underdone it is very unwholesome.â€”Shrimp or anchovy-sauce.

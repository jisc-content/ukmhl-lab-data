17 a pound and a half of raisins ; boil the water, bat do not pour it on the fruit till it is quite cold; let it stand in a large tub 14 days, stirring it well each day.

Strain it through a hair-sieve, and with a. strong wooden spoon press the raisins as dry as you can; put it in a cask, and add the rinds of the other four oranges pared thin like the others ; make a syrup of the juica of the eight oranges with half a pound of lump-sugar ; put this in your cask; stir it well together; close it up tight from the air; let it stand two months to fine, and then bottle it off for use It will keep a long time, and improve by it.

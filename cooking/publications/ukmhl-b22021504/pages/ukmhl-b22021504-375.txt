CHAP. III. SCOTCH NATIONAL DISHES. 367 Garnish with yolk of hard-boiled eggs and fried onions, or use forcemeat-balls. Obs.—This is no bad dish, whatever country owns it. A more oriental complexion may be given to this dish by frying the rice in butter, stirring it with a fork till of a light-brown, and then stewing it in broth till soft.* AN OLIO. Boil, in a close-covered pot, a fowl, a couple of par- tridges, a piece of a leg of mutton, a knuckle of veal, and a few rump-steaks, also a piece of good bacon or ham.

Season these highly, and stew them in rich gravy.

Place it neatly on the dish for an edging; glaze with egg, and set it in the oven for a few minutes before heaping the currie' hash, pillau, or whatever the dish is, in the middle of it. An edg-

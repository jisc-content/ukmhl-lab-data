CHAP. VII.—VEGETABLES AND ROOTS. 227 are used. After all this trouble they are but the ghosts of green peas. They may also be scalded, bot- tled, covered with clarified butter, corked up, and the corks dipped in rosin; but nothing will preserve the sweet flavour and marrowy substance of the young pea. Cabbages, lettuce, greens, endive, leeks, cauli- flower, &c., if carefully removed in dry weather from the ground, without injuring the roots too much, and laid in a cold cellar, or on a stone floor, covering the roots with earth or sand, will keep through the -win- ter, even when the frost might destroy them if left in the garden; and this we conceive the best mode of preservation. TO STORE FRUITS OF DIFFERENT KINDS. This art is now so well understood, that in spring and early summer, apples, and even pears, are seen as plump and fresh as in the autumn when they were gathered. Gather the fruits when just ready to drop off easily, but not over-ripe—do not bruise the fruit in gather- ing—lay it to sweat for a week in heaps, covered with mats, flannels, &c. Wipe each apple or pear, one by one, and place them in glazed stone-ware gal- lon jars, bedded in fine sifted sand, dried in an oven; fill up the jars with sand. Pack each sort by itself, label the jars and close them, and keep them in an airy loft, but protect from frost by covering them with a thick linen cloth. N- B.—Eggs, fruit, and other things packed in straw acquire a very musty flavour. This, which is called being straw-tasted, may be avoided by using dried fern for packing.

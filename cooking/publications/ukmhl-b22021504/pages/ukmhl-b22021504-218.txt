VEGETABLES AND HOOTS. them with the tops downwards, keeping up the boil, and adding boiling water, when wanted, for from two to three hours; try a leaf, and if it draw out easily they are done. Drain them, and serve with melted butter in small cups, a very little in each, or with melted butter in a sauce-boat. Artichoke bottoms, if dry, may be soaked, and then stewed in clear broth, and served with a relishing forcemeat laid in each; or they may be boiled in milk and water, and served with cream-sauce. They are frequently used to enrich ra- gouts, turtle-soups, pies, &c. JERUSALEM ARTICHOKES May either be boiled plain, taken up the moment they are done, and served with melted butter poured over them, or cooked with a rich white or brown sauce. TO BOIL GREEN PEAS. Peas should not be gathered, or, at any rate, not shelled, till they are to be used. When the water boils put them in with a little salt and a bit of sugar ; skim it, and let them boil quickly for from fifteen to twenty-five minutes, trying when they are ready. Drain them, and put a few bits of fresh butter in the dish, turning them lightly over with a silver spoon till they are buttered. Boil a few sprigs of fresh mint by themselves; chop them fine, and lay in little heaps round the edge of the dish. Obs.—Some persons like the flavour of mint boiled with the peas. Buttered peas are rather going out of vogue, but buttering is a good old commendable cus- tom. Dr Kitchener allows “ a peck of peas to two hearty pea-eaters.” At this rate peas for a large party would occupy a tolerable space on a modern table. We would, however, allow a peck of young peas to six or eight persons. Peas are slaved in good white broth, with sliced lettuce and onion, or with sliced cucum- ber. Thicken the broth with butter kneaded in flour; season with white pepper and salt, and a sprig of mint, to be taken out before the stew is dished.

185 CHAP. VI.—PISH. HERRINGS AND MACKEREL. When boiled, serve them with butter and mustard. They may be broiled either split or whole, sprinkled with herbs, chopped crumbs, and seasoned with pep- per and salt; or collared, by splitting them, taking out the bones, seasoning with mixed spices, rolling up and baking them in a slow oven. Herrings are very good potted, and will keep a week without any expense ol butter. Clean, and season them highly with salt and mixed spices.

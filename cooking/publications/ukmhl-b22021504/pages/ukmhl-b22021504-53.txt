DIRECTIONS FOR CARVING. 45 A Fowl, with the Members on one Side cut off.â€” This dish is managed in the same way, whether boil- ed or roasted. In a boiled fowl, the legs are bent in- wards, trussed within the apron, and skewered so till served; in a roasted fowl they are left out and skewer- ed en long. The carver may remove the fowl from the dish to his own plate, particularly when there are two (as is usual) served in the same dish. The members and joints, as taken off, are to be placed in the dish, if not helped round as cut off, which is the best way, as the guests are not kept waiting, and the carver sees when he has enough cut. The carver must fix his fork in the breast, and take off slices from the breast on each side of the merry-thought, which are to be helped in the first place, or left till the whole is finished, as is chosen. Next separate the joint of the wing in the direction a b ; then separate the muscles, by fixing the fork in the pinion, and smartly jerking back the wing towards the leg. Pass the knife be- tween the body and leg, in the direction b d, and cut to the joint clear ; then, with the fork fixed, jerk the leg back, and the parts will give way. Turn over the fowl on your plate, and take off the other leg and wing; next the merry-thought, as in the circular line f g. Take off the neck-bone, by putting in the knife at g; and having the fork well fixed, jerk it off from the part which adheres to the breast-bone. The members being thus disposed of, the breast must be divided from the body by cutting right through the ribs down to the rump on each side. This done, turn the back of the fowl upwards on your plate. Lay your knife firmly across it, as if to hold it down, and, with the fork fixed in the rump, give it a jerk, when it will easily divide across; turn the rump from you.

CHAP. III. SCOTCH NATIONAL DISHES. 361 stoved howtowdie, with drappit Eggs. Prepare and stuff with forcemeat a young plump fowl. Put it into a yetling concave-bottomed small pot with a close-fitting lid, with butter, onions, spices, and at least a quarter-pound of butter. Add herbs if approved. When the fowl has hardened and been turned, add a half-pint or rather more of boiling wa- ter. Fit on the lid very close, and set the pot over embers. A cloth may be wrapped round the lid, if it is not luted on. An hour will do a small fowl, and so in proportion. Have a little seasoned gravy, in which parboil the liver. Poach* nicely in this gravy five or six small eggs. Dress them on flattened balls of spin- age round the dish, and serve the fowl, rubbing down the liver to thicken the gravy and liquor in which the fowl was stewed, which pour over it for sauce, skim- ming it nicely, and serving all hot. Obs.â€”This is a very good small dish. Mushrooms, oysters, forcemeat-balls, &c. may be added to enrich it; and celery may be put to the sauce, or the spinage may be and often is omitted. Chickens and young fowls are dressed as above in Germany with fried eggs, or they are steeped in lemon, spices, and pars- ley, and cut up, and fried, and served with eggs. a veal plory, or Florentine Pic. This Scotch dish is neither more nor less than a good veal-pie, with the addition of some stoned raisins and prunes, minced with beef-suet. SCOTCH WHITE PUDDINGS. Mince good beef-suet, but not too finely, and mix it with about a third of its own weight of nicely-toasted oatmeal. Season very highly with pepper, salt, and finely-shred scalded onions. Have the skins thorough- ly cleaned, and cut of equal lengths. Fill them with the ingredients, and fasten the ends with a wooden pin or small feather. Boil the puddings for an hour, pricking them as they swell in the pot, to let out the air. They will keep for months in bran or oatmeal. This is the French ceufs poches au jits.

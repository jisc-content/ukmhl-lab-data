CHAP. II. MISCELLANEOUS RECEIPTS, &C. 475 It is a great mistake at any time to think a bit of meat is so ruinous, and a great load of bread so cheap. A poor man gets seven or eight shillings a week; if he is careful he brings it home. I dare not say how much of this goes for tea in the afternoon, now sugar and butter are so dear, because I should have you all upon me; but I will say, that too much of this little goes even for bread, from a mistaken notion that it is the hardest fare. This, at all times, but particularly just now, is bad management. Dry pease, to be sure, have been very dear lately ; but now they are plenty enough. I am certain, then, that if a shilling or two of the seven or eight was laid out for a bit of coarse beef, a sheep’s-head, or any such thing, it would be well bestowed. I would throw a couple of pounds of this into the pot, with two or three handfuls of grey pease, an onion, and a little pepper. Then I would throw in cabbage or turnip, and carrot, or any garden- stuff that was most plenty; let it stew two or three hours, and it will make a dish fit for his Majesty. The working men should have the meat; the children don't want it; the soup will be thick and substantial, and requires no bread. Another cheap Soup.—Two pounds of shin of beef, or ox-cheek, a quarter-pound of barley, a halfpenny worth of parsley and onions, with salt, will make four quarts of good soup. A few potatoes, or any cheap vegetable, may be added.

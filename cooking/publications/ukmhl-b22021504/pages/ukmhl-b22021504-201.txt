193 CHAP. VI. FISH. WATER SOUCHY. Eels, gudgeons, whitings, flounders, &c. are all em- ployed for this dish. Whichever sort of fish you use, clean them well, taking out the gills, eyes, &c. Cut them in neat small pieces. Have a little good fish- stock made of the heads and fins, and seasoned with onion, parsley, a bit of lemon-peel, pepper, and salt.

Put bits of butter be- low and above the fish, and strew in, if to be very rich, chopped shrimps or prawns, or the soft part of oysters, or lobster-meat. Make and season nearly a pint of stock of the heads and trimmings; thicken and strain it over the fish, and cover the dish with a good puff-paste.

Parboil two good lobsters ; take out all that is good of the meat, and cut it in bits, and place it in a small pie-dish. Beat the spawn and shells, and stew them in water, with a blade or two of mace, and a little good vinegar. Strain this over the lobster-meat, and

121 CHAP. HI.—BROILING. y 5. We would, unless tlie fire is most tempt- ingly radiant, and the cook dexterous, recommend that pork-chops be dressed in the Dutch oven before a brisk fire, which will prevent their becoming black, and having the smeary appearance which those dressed on the gridiron too often have. TO BROIL CHICKENS AND PIGEONS. P. T. A BROILED fowl or pigeon is thought lighter than one roasted, and is more expeditiously cooked. It is there- fore preferred for the sick, or the hungry and hasty. Singe, as directed in the note, page 96. Pick and trussit; wash it, and cut down the back ; season the inside with pepper and salt, and place that side on a gridiron pre- viously heated, and put at a greater distance from the fire than for a steak. This will take a full half-hour to cook perfectly. The birds should occasionally be’taken off the fire, and rubbed with butter tied in a muslin rag. Particular care must be given to keep every broil- ed dish warm, as the smallness of the articles exposes them more to the action of cold air than meat cooked in larger quantities. Place your chickens or pigeons in a hot dish. For chickens, parsley and butter, or gravy and mushrooms, or sauce a la tartare. Garnish with -slices of lemon; and the liver and gizzard (the latter scored) highly seasoned with pepper and salt, and broiled. For pigeons—the sauce is melted butter, flavoured with mushroom catsup, or parsley and but- ter in the dish. Pigeons may be broiled without splitting. Truss as for boiling, and flatten the breast- bone. Stuff each pigeon with a bit of butter rolled in How hislippes grinned wide, “ What devil is this ?” the King cried, And ’gan to laugh as he were wode, “ What! is Saracen’s flesh thus good ? That, never erst, I nought wist! Hy (lodes death, and his up-rist, Shall we never die for default, While we may in any assault, Slee Saracens, the flesh may take, And seethen, rosten, stew and bake.” Romance of Richard Cceur de Lion.

CHAP. I.—BOILING. 80 when it is cold; but the taste of the guest must be the carver’s guide. By good management this meat will in cold weather keep for a fortnight or more. Cover it with several folds of soft cloth, and over these place a dish-cover. Cut off a thin slice of the hard outside before it is again presented at table, or on the sideboard. If underdone, the meat, after keeping some time, may be put into boiling pot-liquor, and get from 15 to 35 minutes boiling. This receipt is equally applicable to every piece of salted beef, whether Ribs, Brisket, or Edge-bone, (Scotlice Heuckbane,') only, as was said of fore-quarters, these pieces being less solid, require, in proportion to their weight, about a sixth less time in boiling. BEEF BOUILLI. This is another plain family-dish,—boiled fresh beef; but as economy, good sense, and, what is the same thing, good taste, reject this mode of dressing beef but in conjunction with the soup, which forms the better part of it, we leave the Bouilli till we give it along with the Bouillon, though obliged for con- nexion’s sake to notice it here.

The pipe, as it is technically called, must be cut out, and the mustiness which ga- thers on the surface, and in the folds and soft places, rubbed off occasionally. It is wdiitest when quite fresh, but most delicate when hung a feAv days in the larder, though not so long as to allow the juices to thicken, and the flavour to deteriorate. Hill wether mutton, from four to seven years old, is the best, whether for boiling or roasting. Choose it short in the shank, thick in the thigh, and of a pure healthy red. Chop off but a very small bit of the shank; if too much is taken off, the juices -will be drained by this conduit in the boiling. If you Avish to whiten the meat, blanch it for ten

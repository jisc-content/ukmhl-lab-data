2 ADVERTISEMENT TO THE SECOND EDITION. any particular dish., the French method of dressing appeared of importance, the difference has been point- ed out in Observations or Notes appended to the English receipt. (See, for examples, pp. 94, 139,151, 293, 317.) These scattered notices, therefore, toge- ther with the Compendium, form a System of French CooiSery more intelligible and better calculated to enlarge the knowledge of the English cook than any French work that can be obtained. They indeed contain the essence of them all, in the shape best adapted to the uses of the home-bred practitioner. The vanity and amusing self-importance of the art- ists imported to teach the refined cookery of France in our barbarian isles, has often drawn ridicule upon their art which ought to be exclusively confined to its conceited professors; for there is much, not only in the actual Cookery, but in the domestic economy of our refined neighbours, worthy of profound attention. (See page 324.) In the hope that the foreign graces, transplanted into this Volume, may considerably en- hance its value to the practical cook, and in the belief that a culinary system superior to either the French or English may be drawn from the combined excel- lencies of both countries, the Manual in its improved form is now submitted to the public. It is proper again to notice at the outset, that in mentioning many enriching ingredients, garnishes, and sauces, the things in common and fashionable use are always pointed out, but not always recommended. It has been the aim of the Editors to give as much information as possible; but its application must often be left to individual discretion. July, 1827-

PART FOURTH. CHAPTER f. LIQUEURS, CORDIALS, HOME-MADE WINES, BEERS, AND MISCELLANEOUS RECEIPTS. The best basis of all Liqueurs is pure rectified spirit, or uncoloured proof brandy or whisky,—provided the latter have no smoky or peat-reek flavour. Some fine Liqueurs require to be distilled; but, as this is a troublesome process, in small families they are gene- rally made by infusion, which succeeds very well. The syrup employed must be clarified as for preserves. Sometimes capillaire-syrup is used; but this, in most cases, is an unnecessary expense. Curafoa.—Infuse three drachms of sweet oil of orange-peel with a pint of rectified spirits and a pound of clarified syrup. Another Way.—Infuse five ounces of the dry peel of bitter oranges, beat to a paste, with a little sugar, in a quart of pure spirit and a pound of clarified sugar. Let the mixture stand for a week in a warm place, and strain it off, first through a jelly- bag, and then patiently through filtering-paper. N. B.— This is the mode of clearing all liqueurs and cordials, when straining is not sufficient to clear them. Noyeau.—To a quart of pure brandy, or aquavitse, put six ounces of clarified syrup, one ounce of French prunes, with the kernels broken, two ounces of sound peach, nectarine, or, what is better, apricot kernels bruised, a few grains of celery-seed, and a favour of essence of lemon or bitter orange. Infuse for ten days or more, and filter, adding a half-pint of water.

CHAP. VIII.—SAUCES, ESSENCES, &C. 238 MUSHROOM-SAUCE, WHITE,Jvi' Fowls, Veal, Rabbits, tyc. Wash and pick a large breakfast-cupful of small but- ton-mushrooms ; take off the leathery skin, and stew them in veal-gravy, with pepper, cayenne, mace, nut- meg, salt, and a piece of butter rolled in a good deal of flour or arrow-root to thicken, as the abounding gravy of the mushrooms makes them take a good deal of thickening. Stew till tender, stirring them now and then, and pour the sauce over the fowls. Those who like a high relish of mushroom may add a spoon- ful of mushroom-gravy, drawn by salting a few for a night, or a little mushroom-powder. Obs.—The mushrooms may be stewed in thin cream, and seasoned and thickened as above. Mush- rooms pickled white may supply the place of the fresh for this sauce. Lay them in milk for a little, and add some catsup to the sauce if you do not regard the colour.—See French Mushroom-Sauce. celery-sauce, white, for boiled Fowls, Turkey, fyc. Wash, pare, and cut down in thin slices, about two inches long, a head of celery, the younger the better. Blanch or boil it till tender in weak broth or water, and season with pounded mace, nutmeg, grated white pepper, and salt. Thicken it with a good piece of butter kneaded in flour. The juice of a lemon is a great improvement, or, for less delicate purposes, a little lemon-pickle. Obs.—French cooks stew the celery with suet or fat bacon, and use very little seasoning, which they justly think is unsuitable to celery. Brown Celery-Sauce.—Stew and season as in the last receipt, thicken with browned flour, and add a glass of red wine and a spoonful of catsup. lie-vinegar and a tea-spoonful of made mustard, brown sugar, and black pepper, stir these into a half-pint of oiled butter.

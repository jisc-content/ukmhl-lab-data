V.—BROTHS, SOUPS, AND GRAVIES. in a stew-pan, put to it four Imperial pints of boiling water, a slice of bread, a quart of shelled peas, some roughly-chopped green onions, spinage, and green lettuce, salt, and two dozen grains of black and Ja- maica pepper. Stew till the peas will pulp back into the liquor from which they were strained, or they may be pounded in a mortar. To this add a pint or more of young peas, the heart of a lettuce chopped, and, if approved, a sliced cucumber, first sprinkling the slices with salt and draining them. If the soup is thought too thin add rice-flour ; if too maigre, allow more but- ter ; if not green enough, add a little spinage chopped, or a quarter pint of very green spinage liquor, made by parboiling and squeezing the vegetable. Stew for half an hour, but do not let the soup boil, or the green colour will deaden and become a tawny yellow. Green shred mint in a very small quantity may be added to flavour the soup, five minutes before it is dished, with dice of fried bread. Obs.—This summer soup may be made from the liquor in which chickens, fowls, veal, mutton, or lamb has been boiled. If the peas are not quite young and sweet, a little sugar may be employed, and conse- quently less salt. GREEN ASPARAGUS-SOUP. Make this as green peas-soup. Slice and pulp a part of the asparagus ; put the other, cut into nice points, and dressed into the strained soup before serving; or fried bread cut into dice. AN EXCELLENT SOUP MAIGRE. Melt a half-pound of butter very slowly, and put to it four onions sliced, a head of celery, and a carrot and turnip cut down. When the vegetables have fried in the butter for a quarter of an hour, and are browned on all sides, put to them nearly four quarts of boiling water, and a pint and a half of young peas, with plenty of unground black and Jamaica pepper. When the vegetables are quite tender, let the soup stand to clear from the sediment, and strain it into a clean stew-pan.

Obs.—A fillet of the loin roasted makes a handsome French dish, served with Tomata sauce, or some sub- stitute, as cucumber sauce. TO ROAST A LEG OF MUTTON. P. S. T. ESQ. Mutton intended to be roasted may be kept longer than mutton for boiling, as the colour is of less im- portance. Cut out the pipe that runs along the back- bone, which taints so early; wipe off the mustiness that gathers on the surface, and in the folds and doublings of the meat, and below the flap.

N.B.—Potatoes browned in the dripping-pan, or a plain potato pudding placed below the dripping, were two favourite accompaniments to this dish at the Cleikum. Mashed turnip is another approved simple accompaniment. TO ROAST A SUCKING PIG. BY DR REDGILL. A Sucking Pig ! un coclion dc tail ! France and Eng- land, natural enemies on the relative merits of ragouts and roast beef, are in brotherhood here. The age on which every gourmand, whether insular or continental has set his seal, is, from ten days to double that number. Unlike the ways of other flesh, in this delicate crea-

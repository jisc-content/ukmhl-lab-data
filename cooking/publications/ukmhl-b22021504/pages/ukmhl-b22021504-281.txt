CHAP- I. MADE-DISHES. 273 a week in cold weather, washed and stewed plainly, is an economical as well as an excellent dish, whether for company or for family use. It may be divided diagonally, so as to skewer up neatly, and stewed in weak broth with roots, as above. Skim the fat care- fully off, and serve the soup, which will be very rich, on toasted sippets, and the meat by itself either gar- nished with cut pickles, or sliced carrot, or onions prepared for garnishing. See page 236. A rump is sometimes half-roasted, and finished in the stew-pot in weak broth, with some mild ale, wine, vinegar, cat- sup, a faggot of sweet herbs, and onions, mixed spices, jiickled mushrooms, See. This is an expensive dish, and has nothing to recommend it beyond the plainer- dressed rump. TO STEW OR RAGOUT A BRISKET OP BEEF. Take four or five pounds of a brisket, with the firm fat; wash and rub it with salt and vinegar before dressing it. Put it into a small stew-pan that will just hold it, with water or broth, and, when well skim- med, let it stew very slowly for an hour, and then put to it cut carrots, turnips, and small whole onions. WTien it has stewed slowly till tender, draw out the bones, thicken the gravy with butter rolled in flour and a little catsup, with plenty of mixed spices. Serve the meat by itself, with a garnishing of sprigs of cauli- flower, and a sauce made of thickened gravy, with more catsup, and a little made-mustard. Obs.—A haricot of beef may be made of the above, by dividing the meat into about a dozen neat pieces, browning them, and putting in a sliced head of celery and forcemeat balls, in addition to the ingredients ordered above. Another Way, or Bceuf Garni de Choux, an excellent Dish.—Boil firm white cabbage cut in quarters in any good broth, and season with carrots, onions, two bay- leaves, and a sprig of thyme. Moisten with a little top-fat. Drain the cabbage, press out the fat, and serve them neatly round the meat. 7

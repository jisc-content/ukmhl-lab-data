CHAP. VII. VEGETABLES AND BOOTS. 211 WINDSOR BEANS. Boil them in plenty of water with salt. Serve with or under bacon or pickled pork. Garnish with chopped parsley, or serve parsley and butter. FRENCH BEANS. Cut off the stalks, and strip off the strings. If the beans are old, cut them in two slantwise. Lay them in a weak pickle of salt and water for a half-hour. Put them into water that boils quickly, and when done, which will be best known by trying them, drain them, and serve with melted butter. Obs.—When old and large they are best split as well as cut aslant. TO BOIL CABBAGE, GREENS, SAVOYS, AND BRUSSELS SPROUTS. Strip off the coarse outer leaves, and pare off the coarse husk from the branch-stalks ; cut off the stem close to the bottom; wash them thoroughly, and put them on with plenty of boiling water in an open pot, and a little salt of wormwood, or a bit of soda. Divide half-grown cabbages, and quarter large ones. See that they be well covered with boiling water. They will take from fifteen minutes to an hour, or more, according to the age. Brussels cabbage are boiled as above, and arranged in the dish as asparagus. The French serve a white sauce, and send up a cruet, of oil with these small cabbages.—See Bubble and Squeak, Boiled Beef and Greens. SPINAGE FOR A SECOND COURSE. This delicate vegetable requires very careful pick- ing and washing. When perfectly clean, put it to plenty of boiling water and salt, and boil very quick- ly, pressing it down with a wooden spoon;—ten mi- nutes will boil it. Drain it and squeeze it dry, and throw it into cold water to preserve the colour green.

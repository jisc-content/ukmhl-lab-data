388 CHAP. IV.—PASTRY, PIES, &C. Lay stewed apples, rhubarb, or scalded gooseberries, in the crust, with coarse sugar to sweeten; add for apples a little lemon-peel or cinnamon. Cut the ed- ges, double up and pinch the crust, and bake the pas- ties in a moderate oven. If there be icing at hand they may be iced.

Vol-au-vent.—Cut, with a paste-runner, puff-paste which has got six turns, and been doubled into the shape of the dish in which the vol-au-vent is to be served.

Obs.—One main use of vol-au-vent is, that it gives a handsome form to things left cold, which could not otherwise make part of an entertainment for company. For second courses, vol-au-vent may be fancifully marked round the border in a wreath of leaves, and have sweetmeats or delicate dressed vegetables served on it. PUFFS.

CHAP- V.—BROTHS, SOUPS, AND GRAVIES. 163 CRAY-FISH SOUP. Make two quarts of fish-stock, in which boil a bunch of parsley, two onions, and two dozen of black and Jamaica peppercorns. For this have from two to three pounds of fish, fins, heads, &c., but all fresh. Boil to a mash, and strain the liquor till clear. Pick from four to five dozen of cray-fish, and stew till de- licately done, adding a little cayenne, and the spawn of a boiled lobster pounded, and stirred into the soup, which it will both thicken and enrich. O/je.—Soups are made of muscles, cockles, and pram ns. They all require good stock, plenty of pepper, and careful washing and picking.—As much of the flavour of delicate shell-fish is lost in washing them free of sand, the washings may be kept, strained repeatedly, and put to the stock. FORCEMEAT FOR FISH-SOUPS, OR FOR STEWS OF FISH. Beat the flesh and soft parts of a boiled lobster in a mortar, with a boned anchovy, the yolks of three eggs hard boiled, and a head of boiled celery chopped. Put to this a handful of bread-crumbs, cayenne, mace, a spoonful of mushroom catsup, a quarter-pound of melted butter, a large spoonful of oyster-liquor, or some oyster-pickle, and two or more eggs well beaten, to cement the composition. Mix it well, and form into egg-shaped balls, which fry or brown in a Dutch oven ; or the fish that makes the stock may be pound- ed for forcemeat. eel-soup. Take two pounds of eels, two quarts of water, a crust of bread, six blades of mace, two onions, a few corns of whole pepper, and a bundle of sweet herbs; cut and boil them till half the liquor is wasted, then strain it, and serve it up with toasted bread. This may make both a ragout and a soup. It may be made stronger by boiling it longer, or using broth instead of water.—See Fish and Sauce, National Dishes, also Fish Turtle.

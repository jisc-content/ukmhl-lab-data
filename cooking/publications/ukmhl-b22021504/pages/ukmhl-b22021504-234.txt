22b CHAP. VII.—VEGETABLES AND BOOTS. A WINTER SALAD. The basis of this is the same as any other salad, with the substitution of endive, celery, and beet-root pickle, also pickled red cabbage. Obs.—A Very pretty winter salad may be arranged by contrasting the colours, garnishing with the beet- root in slices, and the red cabbage and white celery cut in delicate straws. TO PRESERVE ROOTS AND VEGETABLES. Potatoes are of most consequence. Choose them of the middle-size, fresh from the mould, or the store- pit. Yellow kidneys are for the earlier part of the season; and red or calico potatoes for the spring months, as these keep best late in the year. Keep them in a cellar below ground, where the temperature is pretty equal, and never very low, and defend them well from frost and currents of air with straw or mats. In spring, have them turned over, and the growths carefully picked away, which process must be again repeated later in the season. Keep carrots and turnips, parsnips, and beet-roots, with their native mould about them, in dry sand : onions are best pre- served strung, or the small ones in nets, in a cool but not a damp place. Use the thick-necked spongy ones first; they may have the germ taken out, with a lard- ing-pin, and then be strung up, or they may be kiln-dried. Parsley may be picked, and dried by tying it in bundles to a rope, or drying it in a cool oven; and so may other herbs. French beans will keep by salting and closing them up, and soaking them before they are dressed; but they lose a good deal of their flavour and colour. Cucumbers, kidney- beans, endive, &c., may be parboiled and kept closed up in strong pickle; soaking them to freshen them before they are dressed. Green peas are shelled, scalded repeatedly, drained, dried in cloths, spread on plates, and put in a cool oven, and afterwards hung up in paper-bags to harden; soak them before they

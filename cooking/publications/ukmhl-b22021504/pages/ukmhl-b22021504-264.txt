Vinegar is an article perpetually wanted for various purposes in almost every family, and, compared with the first cost of the materials, it is a very expensive one. Though we are not perfectly convinced that the labour of the still-room is at all times what economists would call productive labour, we think that vinegar for or- dinary purposes may always be manufactured at home, as it is easily managed on a small scale, may be made of things that would otherwise be lost, and gives little trouble. Sugar Vinegar.—To every gallon of water put two pounds of coarse raw sugar. Boil and skim this. Put it to cool in a tub, and when sufficiently cold, add to it a slice of bread soaked in fresh yeast. Barrel it in a week, and set in the sun in summer, or by the fire in winter, for six months without stopping the bung- hole j but cover it with a plate to keep out insects. Cider Vinegar.—Put a pound of white sugar to the gallon of cider, and, jumbling them well together, let them ferment for four months, and a strong and well- coloured vinegar will be the result. Gooseberry Vinegar.—To every quart of bruised ripe white or green gooseberries put three quarts of spring water. Stir them well with the water, and let them steep for 48 hours, repeating the stirring. Strain through a flannel-bag, and put two pounds of white pounded sugar to every gallon of liquor. Put it into a barrel with a toast soaked in yeast, leaving the bung-hole as directed above. Keep the barrel in a warm place. White currants or raspberries make an excellent vinegar by following the same receipt. Pick the currants from the stalks.

An idea of this kind had, among many others, been for some time floating in the brain of the Nabob, which was rather fertile in projects ; but it would probably never have gone farther than the tongue, save for one of those fortuitous combinations of events which sometimes produce the mightiest consequences, and which about this time sent to St Ronan’s a personage of no less weight than the celebrated Dr Redgill. The Doctor had for some months been what his physician called “ an incipient invalid.” His powers of digestion, though still respectable, were of late rather de- clining ; but his appetite, “ he thanked God,” was vigorous as ever, his taste more refined, and his knowledge matured and extended in every branch of the science. He had been trying the Cheltenham waters in the previous season, and was now recommended by a Scotch physician, who had been singularly happy in the case of his friend, Alderman , to try the St Ronan’s Spa, the virtues of which were just then coming into repute. Like the bulk of mankind, attracted by the glitter of ap- pearance, Dr Redgill, on his arrival, established himself at the New Hotel: but here he soon became discontented with the accommodations, attendance, and, above all, the cookery; and, learning that a wealthy old East Indian—a sort of hu- mourist, who understood and loved good cheer—had fixed his head-quarters in a quiet, comfortable, well-ordered, old- fashioned inn, where excellent small dinners were served, the Doctor ordered his low-hung well-cushioned vehicle, and on the second morning of his residence at St Ronan’s Well, set out to reconnoitre the capabilities of this land of promise.

358 CHAP. III.—SCOTCH NATIONAL DISHES. best for hotch-potch, or the small, round, smooth- grained yellow kind peculiar to Scotland. Mutton makes excellent hotch-potch without any lamb-steaks. Parsley shred, white cabbage, asparagus-points, or lettuce, may be added to the other vegetables or not, at pleasure. WINTER HOTCH-POTCH. This dish may be made of either fresh beef, or of a neck or back-ribs of mutton, or a mixture of both. Cut four pounds of meat into handsome pieces. Boil and skim this well, and add carrots and turnips sliced, small leeks and parsley cut down, and some German greens finely shred, and put in only a little before the soup is completed. Season with pepper and salt. The quantity of vegetables must be suited to the quantity of meat, so that the soup may have con- sistence, but not be disagreeably thick. Serve the meat and soup together. This may be thickened with the fine part of toasted oatmeal. Have rice or Avhole pease boiled in it, which last is a great improvement. TO MAKE SKINK, CLll old Scotch Soup. Take two legs of beef, put them on with two gallons of water; let them boil for six hours, taking care to skim the soup well all the time, as the gravy should be very clear and bright; then strain the liquor from the meat, take out the sinewy part from the meat, and lay it aside till your soup is ready to serve up. Cut the sinews about an inch long. Have some vegetables cut, such as carrots, turnips, leeks, onions, celery, lettuce, cabbage shred small, and green pease, when to be had. Blanch the whole in water for ten minutes. Put the whole into the soup, and boil till quite tender. Serve up the sinews in the tureen with the soup. Season the whole with salt and pepper before dishing it. Obs. Herbs may be used in these soups; and white pease (boilers) are by many thought an improve- ment. Both are cheap and excellent family-dishes. Plain Scotch Fish and. Sauce Maigre.—This is, in fact, just a fish-soup. Make a stock ol the heads, points

18 INTRODUCTION. of Touchwood’s Curagoa, the Doctor was now so far molli- fied as to add to a grateful eulogium on the qualities of the liqueur an acknowledgment of the attention of his enter- tainer. “ Never mind it, man,” said the easy Nabob ; “ I at least am indebted to the delinquent sow; she abridges cere- mony and idle introductions. You must take a bachelor’s dinner with me to-day. No refusal positively. A glass of Meg’s good wine must atone for short commons. I vow this brush has done me good.” Nothing was farther from the real intention of Dr Redgill than to refuse an invitation, which the savoury steams now issuing from Meg’s kitchen, “ steams that might have cre- ated a stomach under the ribs of death,” rendered irresist- ibly seductive. With a decent show of hesitation, he yielded; and, snuffing up the incense-breathing vapours which ascend- ed the stair, followed the Nabob to a private parlour, where an old rich china basin, filled with the balmy and ambrosial fluid, was twice replenished for his solace; first, however, improved by a pin’s-point of crystals of Cayenne from a sil- ver pocket-case of essence vials, which had luckily escaped the taint of the stye. “ Excellent hare-soup—very excellent indeed I pronounce it, Mr Touchwood. All the blood preserved—the consist- ence—the concoction complete—the seasoning admirable. Sir, I abhor the injustice of withholding from the poor cook the praise that is her due. It is bad policy, Mr Touch- wood. This hare-soup, I say, is excellent; and, to my thinking, though a Scottish fashion, the very best way of dressing a hare. Sir, you are in snug quarters here. A sen- sible, discreet person, your hostess, though a little gruff at the first brush. Sir, all good cooks are so. They know their own value—they are a privileged class—they toil in a fiery element—they lie under a heavy responsibility. But, perhaps, after all, you travel with your own cook—many gentlemen do.”

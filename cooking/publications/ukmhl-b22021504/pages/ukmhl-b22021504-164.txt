156 CHAP. V.—BROTHS, SOUPS, AND GRAVIES. A PEPPER-POT.* This is now understood to be a-sort of clear-larder, Saturday’s dinner-dish, composed of every sort of shreds and patches. It ought properly, if fine cook- ery is attempted, to be an Olio, composed of a due ad- mixture of meat, fish, fowl, vegetables, and roots. To three quarts of water put a couple of pounds of whatever vegetables are plentiful (a good proportion being onions), and a couple of pounds of mutton-scrag cut into three or four pieces; or A fowl, or veal, or a piece of lean bacon, and a little rice. Skim it j and, when nearly finished, add the meat of a lobster or crab, cut in bits, or the soft part of a few oysters, or hard-boiled yolks of eggs. Take off all the fat that rises, and season highly with pepper and cayenne. Serve in a tureen. knuckle of veal soup, on excellent Scotch Soup. Take a large knuckle, or, if small, add a piece of the scrag. Wash it, and break the bones; place skew- ers in the stew-pan to keep the knuckle from sticking; cover it with water and no more; put in a head of ce- lery, a sprig of lemon-thyme, three onions, a carrot, a turnip, and two dozen black and Jamaica peppercorns, simmer till the knuckle is tender. Strain the soup. Cut the gristly parts of the knuckle and all that is good, into mouthfuls, and put to it a seasoning of white pepper and mace in powder, and rice-flour to thicken if it is wished. This soup may be made with rice or vermicelli; or the stewed uncut knuckle may be served in the soup; for many like to pick the gristles, a “ pleasing toil,” instead of having the meat cut for them by the cook. Ohs.—Some gourmands admire veal stew-soup made of Staggering-Bob,—that is an infant calf, whose bones are still gristle, and his flesh a jelly. The breast, knuckle, and shoulder-blade, are best for this purpose. * “ Where every thing that every soldier got. Fowl, bacon, cabbage, mutton, and what not Was thrown into one JBank, and went to pot.”

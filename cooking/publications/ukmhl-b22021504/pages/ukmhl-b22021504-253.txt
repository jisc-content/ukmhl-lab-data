CHAP. VIII. SAUCES, ESSENCES, &C. 245 frequently attempted, and succeed as far as is possible, considering that some of the seeds and spices are used green in compounding the genuine powder, and that in this country they are necessarily all dried. French cooks use saffron to colour currie-sauce, boiling the saffron, and rubbing it through a search. Where a bright colour is desirable, a tincture of saffron is less offensive than an over-dose of turmeric. Saffron is often used to colour cakes, puddings, &c.; but should be used with caution. a cheap general sauce for Hashes of Beef and Mutton. Make a gravy from the broken bones, gristles, and other trimmings laid aside when you cut down the meat. In this boil two onions, a faggot of parsley, or a little of the seed, a head of celery, or a little seed, a few sprigs of herbs, and a tea-spoonful of black and Jamaica peppercorns. Thicken this gravy with browned flour, and season with any thing convenient and economical that can be spared; for hash, though it may be good and savoury, is understood to be a frugal dish. Pickle-liquor, whether of onions, mush- rooms, oysters, or walnuts, will answer very well ; so will a little catsup, or shalot-vinegar; or a little currie-powder will cheaply give that favourite flavour to the hash. A few chopped pickled walnuts, nastur- tiums, or gherkins, are employed by some cooks, though we cannot recommend hard cut pickles in any made dish. They immediately lose their flavour when mixed with the sauce, and cause a “ sharp encounter” of the teeth, which is far from desirable.—See Hashes. white hash-sauce, for Veal roasted or minced, or for Fowls. Take the bones, gristles, and white trimmings of the meat, and stew them in clear weak broth or water, a small onion, and a good piece of thinly-sliced lemon- peel, salt, a blade of mace, or a few white peppercorns. Thicken the gravy with flour or potato-starch rolled in butter, and when it is boiled quite smooth, let it

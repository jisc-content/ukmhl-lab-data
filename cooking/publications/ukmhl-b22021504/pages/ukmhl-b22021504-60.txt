52 OP BILLS OF FAKE. between the centre-piece and the dish of fish to which each is appropriate; and this, with the decanted wines drank during dinner, foi'ms the first course. When there are rare French or Rhenish wines, they are placed in the original bottles (uncorked) in ornamented wine- vases, at the head and bottom of the table,â€”that is, be- tween the centre-piece and the top and bottom dishes; or if four kinds, they are ranged round the plateau.

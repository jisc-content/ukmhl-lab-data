CHAP. V. BROTHS, SOUPS, AND GRAVIES. 141 potage a la reine, the fashionable White Soup. Take a couple of large or three small fat pullets; clean and skin them: take also two pounds or more of veal cut into pieces; put these together into a very nicely-tinned stew-pan, with parsley, and moisten them with boiling veal-broth. Let this stew softly for an hour; then soak in the broth the soft part of a penny-loaf; cut the flesh off the breasts and wings of the chickens; chop and pound it in a mortar with the hard yolks of four eggs, the soaked crumbs, ten sweet almonds and three bitter, all blanched. Rub the compound into the soup ; strain the whole, and add a quart of sweet cream brought to boil by itself. Cow- Heel or Calf’s-Feet will make a good white soup. PLAIN ONION-SOUP. Chop a dozen large onions singly, and stew them in a small stew-pan with butter ; stir them about with a wooden spoon ; let them cook very gradually and not get brown. Put to this some very strong stock-broth, well seasoned; add pepper, cayenne, and salt, and, if nicer cooking is wanted, strain the soup, and put to it a pint of boiling cream. HIGH-FLAVOURED ONION-SOUP. Have a proper quantity of well-seasoned clear brown gravy-soup, in which a double proportion of onions has been boiled. To this, when strained, put a do- zen middle-sized onions, sliced and nicely fried; let those stew gently in the soup, but not to crumble’ the slices; season with pepper and cayenne, and serve with toasted sippets in the tureen. Button-onions cooked as tor garnishing bouilli, &c. may be used instead ot large ones fried ; and for those who like a lull-tasted soup, this may be thickened with potato- oui, or the pulp of peas. It must be simmered till the onions, both in substance and flavour, are blended (ready to melt away) with the soup. When very young mild onions are used, more weight must be allowed to obtain the same flavour. f 2

CHAP. V. BROTHS, SOUPS, AND GRAVIES. 158 skins, and every thing unfit for the tureen, should be trimmed away ; or, if boiled in the soup, it must be strained before the cold meat to be served is added. A MORE MODERN HARE-SOUP. Cut down the hare into nice pieces, and stew them with four onions, stuck with four cloves, four blades of mace, a bay-leaf or two, a faggot of parsley, with two or three sprigs of basil, thyme, and marjoram*. Simmer slowly in a little strong stock-broth, and when the juices are well drawn out, put more, till the whole quantity required is in. Simmer for another hour at least, and strain the soup. Take the best of the meat from the bones, pound it, moistening with a little of the soup. JPound also some soaked crumb of bread, or the dry mealy part of potatoes, and put this to the soup, which must now be seasoned to your taste with pepper, salt, cayenne, and catsup; or, keep the best pieces, if the hare be large, to serve whole in the tu- reen, cut into mouthfuls, and pound the others, which will make the soup have quite enough of consistence. The best pieces to serve are the fillets along the back-bone, which need not be boiled quite so long as the other parts, if to be thus used. PIGEON-SOUP, OR GAME-SOUP. Make a clear gravy stock of four pounds of lean beef, or scrag and shanks of mutton, two turnips, two onions, and four quarts of water boiled down to three. Put to this stock the gizzards, crops, and livers of four or five pigeons or partridges. The birds must be neatly trussed as for boiling, seasoned inside with ground white pepper and salt, and flattened on the breast.. Dredge them with flour, and brown them nicely in a frying-pan. Thicken the stock with but- ter kneaded in browned flour; strain and season it with white pepper, salt, and a little mace, and let the pigeons stew in it for twenty-five minutes, taking off the scum as it rises. Throw a few toasted sippets into the tureen before dishing the soup.

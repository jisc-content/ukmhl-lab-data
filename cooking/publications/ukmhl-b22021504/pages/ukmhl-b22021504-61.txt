OF BILLS OF FARE. 53 mestic and personal habits of the English; yet the custom is now partially adopted even on the conti- nent ; whence again some of our young fashionables and veteran men of travel have caught the filthy practice of eating with their fingers; not merely sa- lads and cheese, but oysters, devils, macaroni, &c., in this digusting trick far exceeding their French and Italian masters ; what in foreigners is an unpleasant habit, being in their imitators bad taste, if not ill- breeding and effrontery. The Dessert may consist merely of two dishes of fine fruit for the top and bottom ; common or dried fruits, filberts, &c. for the corners or sides, and a cake for the middle, with ice-pails in hot weather. Liqueurs are at this stage handed round; and the wines usually drank after dinner are placed decanted on the table along with the dessert, and the ice-pails and plates removed as soon as the company finish their ice. Where there is preserved ginger, it follows the ices ; or is eaten to heighten to the palate the delicious coolness of the dessert wines. This may all be better understood by noting the following exact arrangement of what is considered a fashionable, though not sumptuous, din- ner of three courses and a dessert.

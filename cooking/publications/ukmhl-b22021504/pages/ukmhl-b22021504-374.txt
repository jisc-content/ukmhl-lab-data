Obs.—The sauces ordered for boiled mutton and cow-heel are well adapted to this dish, if sauce must be had where it is so little required.* LEEK-PORUIDGE. Make this as cock-a-leekie, and thicken with toasted or fried bread. Use fewer leeks. Prunes are some- times put into this composition. PLUM-PORRIDGE. Boil and skim the liquor of a large shin for six hours. Strain off the liquor, and put to it a piece of veal cut from the fillet. Soften the crumb of a penny-loaf in the soup, and beat it smoothly. Thicken the soup with this, and put to it a half-pound of stoned rai- sins, and a half-pound of stoned prunes, a pound of currants 'well-cleaned, and some pepper, mace, and grated nutmeg. When the fruit is soft, the dish is ready. A little more bread may be used, if greater consistence is wanted, and the veal may be omitted. Pan-Kail, a Maigre Soup.—Mince cabbage, sa- voys, or German greens ; boil them in water, thicken- ed with meal and a piece of butter, salt, &c. Kail is also made by parboiling and mashing the greens, put- ting them to hot pot-liquor, and thickening with bread or pounded biscuit. A PILLAU. Stew some rice in broth, or with butter; and season it with white pepper, mace, cayenne, and cloves. Place two small fowls, or a few veal or mutton cut- lets, in the centre of a large dish, and lay some slices of boiled bacon beside them. Cover with rice; smooth and glaze the rice with egg, and set the dish before the fire, or in the oven, to brown for a while. * The reviewer of the first edition of this work in lllackwood s Magazine suggests, that there should be two heads and eight trot- ters, which admirable emendation certainly more than doubles the val ue of tlie receipt.

HADDOCKS IN BROWN SAUCE, An excellent Scotch Dish. Clean, cut off the heads, tails and fins, and skin from six to eight well-sized haddocks. Take the heads, tails, and trimmings, with two or three fish cut down, and boil them in a quart of water or broth, with a couple of onions, some sweet herbs, and a piece of lemon-peel; thicken with plenty of browned butter and flour, and season highly with mixed spices and mushroom-catsup; strain the sauce, and when it boils and is skimmed put in the fish cut into neat pieces, and, if you choose, previously browned in the frying- pan. If there be too little sauce, add some good beef- gravy ; put in a quarter-hundred of oysters and a glass of their liquor, or some muscles, and a little wine. Take out the fish, when ready, with a slice, and pour the sauce, which should be brown, smooth, and thick, . around them. Obs.—Haddocks may be stuffed with a fish-force- meat, and boiled in a sauce, as directed above. Some of the forcemeat may be made into balls for garnish- ing. Haddocks may also be stuffed, egged, and strew- ed with fine bread-crumbs, minced parsley, &c., and baked, basting them well with butter. Serve in a white sauce made of a pound or more of good veal, onions, and parsley, and thickened with plenty of butter kneaded in flour. Strain, and add a glass of white wine, the juice of a lemon, white pepper in fine powder, a quarter-hundred of pickled oysters, and a spoonful of the liquor. Pour the skimmed sauce over the fire. Garnish with sliced lemon and pickled samphire. This makes a very handsome Scotch dish. Whitings are dressed as above, with a white sauce, and codlings with a brown sauce.

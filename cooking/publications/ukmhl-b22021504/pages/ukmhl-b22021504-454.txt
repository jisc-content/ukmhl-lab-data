446 CHAP. V.—ORNAMENTAL DISHES, &C. worts. Yeast is made of the flour of pease, rye, po- tatoes, and wheat, mixed with sugar and water, after- wards fermented with good fresh yeast. Bad yeast may be improved by mixing in it flour and sugar, with a little warm water, or by bleaching it; that is, beating up the yeast with water equal in quantity to itself, and the white of an egg to each quart of yeast. In twelve hours pour off the thin. What remains will be improved yeast. Russian Yeast,—the be$t Substitute that me know.— Make a thick wort of ground rye or malt, and for a gallon of this take three ounces or more of leaven, and dissolve it in a little of the wort. Mix the whole, and add a half-pound of ground malt; shake the mixture for some time, and in half an hour add two large spoonfuls of good yeast; cover for forty-eight hours, and the whole will be good yeast. Another Substitute.—To a pound of good mashed potatoes, of the mealy kind, put two ounces of brown sugar. Pulp the potatoes through a colander, and mix them with hot water ; add two or three spoonfuls of good yeast. This is not so strong as beer-yeast, but it does for household-bread by using more of it. In the country, this substitute, as it is easily obtained, will be found particularly convenient. Camp Yeast.—Make a thin gruel of a gallon of spring water, with flour of rye, wheat, or pease; boil it, stirring it well for twenty minutes. Add to this a half-pound of raw sugar, and when as cool as new milk, put a quarter-pint of fresh yeast to this, and let it ferment, covered before the fire, or in a warm place. Pour off this part. Keep bottled a few spoonfuls of this to ferment the next quantity wanted. A gill will do for four quartern-loaves.

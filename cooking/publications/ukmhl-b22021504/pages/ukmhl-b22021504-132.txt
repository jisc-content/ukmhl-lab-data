CHAP. IV.—PRYING. 124 gently off, holding back the milky sediment which will have subsided. Mutton and beef suet and lard may be roughly chopped, have all the skin and fibrous parts taken out, and either be very gradually melted over a slow fire, or before the fire in a Dutch oven, taking away the fat as it drops. In this last process there is less danger of the fat acquiring a burnt taste than when melted into tallow over the fire. Strain the fat and keep back the sediment. Dripping and melted suet* are used for pie-crust, for basting and soups, as well as for frying. Their suitableness for all these purposes depends, in a great measure, on the way in which they have been melted and preserved. When dripping is to be kept for soup it may be seasoned, not otherwise. It may be very highly purified by twice clarifying. TO MELT LARD. Either melt it as in last receipt, or skin, beat, and boil the caul slowly, and lay it in a little water, working it with the hand. When it will easily break with the fingers, let it cool, and rub it through a search. Keep in bladders in a cool place. Another may,—Melt the lard in a stone jar set in boiling water; pour it care- fully from the sediment, and keep it in bladders or small jars. TO PRY STEAKS. DR R. Fry in butter pieces cut of the same size as for broil- ing. Fry them of a fine brown. The pan may be covered after the steaks are browned, which will ren- der them more juicy. When done, place them in a hot dish by the fire ; add to the gravy in the pan a small glass of red wine, a small anchovy boned, pepper, salt, and a minced shalot. Give it a boil up, and pour it over the steaks, which, like every fry and broil, must be eaten hot; or fried steaks may be eaten with • For an excellent way of using beef 6uet, see Paste of Beef, Suet for Meat Pies, &c.

CHAP. I. MADE-DISHES. 303 rich the stew. A breast may be dressed as above, but is better as a pasty. Venison-Collops, a Scotch Dish.—Cut the meat in thin cutlets, season them highly with mixed spices, and having browned them in the stew-pan, put to them a quarter-pint of strong brown gravy, the same quantity of claret, some fried crumbs, a little fine su- gar, and a glass of the best vinegar. Stew slowly in a closely-covered stew-pan, and dish the collops in the strained sauce. They may first be marinaded. Obs.—Venison makes the finest flavoured minced collops, surpassing either beef or hare ; and excellent steaks, when seasoned, dipped in butter, rolled in crumbs, and broiled quickly. But these steaks re- quire a gravy-sauce, unless the venison be very fat. CIVET OP VENISON. Cut the neck, or back-ribs, or breast, in small chops. Fry some pieces of good bacon in butter, and when melted, drain off the liquid and add flour. Brown the steaks in this roux, and then moisten with red wine, (Burgundy or claret,) and good broth. Add parsley, onions, pepper, salt, and also garlic if admired. Let this cook slowly, shaking the dish occasionally. Add small onions and mushrooms. Let the sauce be of good consistence. This is elegantly served en casse- role. MADE-DISHES OP COLD VENISON. To stew cold Venison.—Make a gravy of what re- mains about the meat, a little strong unseasoned mut- ton-broth, and a bundle of sweet herbs. When this is good, skim it, and add browned butter thickened with flour, also catsup, mixed spices, a little claret, and a spoonful of currant-jelly if it is liked. Boil this till smooth, stirring it well, and put in the venison cut in thin slices. Let it heat thoroughly, and taking out the herbs, dish it, squeezing a lemon into the dish. Garnish with slices of lemon and fried bread, or with cut pickles. To hash Venison.—Cut the meat as for other hashes, and warm it in its own gravy. Season and dish it on sippets.

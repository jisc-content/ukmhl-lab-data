CHAP. I.—BOILING. 82 large gigot, a fillet may be roasted, and the knuckle used for barley or rice broth. In French cookery, pars- ley, onions, and a clove or two of garlic, are boiled with this favourite joint. It is then glazed (a work of worse than supererogation) and served on a Sauce Espagnol.

Garnish with car- rot, or turnips cut in two; and pour over the meat caper-sauce, or parsley and butter. Serve mashed turnip or cauliflower. Pouring the sauce over boiled dishes, besides improving their appearance, is to be preferred, because, in carving, the juices of the meat, the natural sauce, flow out and mingle with the pre- pared relish, “ each improving each.” But this can only be done when the taste of the company is under- stood, and the sauce in no danger of becoming cold.

The ribs will do the same; or make Chops, Currie, Haricot, or Pie.—See Made- Dishes of Mutton. TO BOIL A LEG OF LAMB. Lamb is seldom boiled in Scotland, and there is good sense in the omission.

Veal plainly boiled is too insipid to be much re- lished for its own sake. But variety, economy, and veal broth or gravy, sanction this mode ot cookery. Boiled veal looks detestable when slobbery and red-

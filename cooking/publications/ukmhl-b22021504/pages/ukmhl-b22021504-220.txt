212 CHAP. VII.—VEGETABLES AND BOOTS. Put a piece of fresh butter and a little salt in the stew- pan, and, returning the spinage well squeezed, beat it fine. Spread it level on the dish, and scallop with a spoon, or score it in the form of diamonds or sip- pets, or press it in a leaf-shaped mould, and turn it out. Cream, the squeeze of a lemon, and mace, are added by some cooks ; or a little rich bland gravy, if to be served under a tongue, fricandeau, or breast of lamb. Spinage is often served with poached eggs. It is then boiled, pressed, beat up with butter and seasonings, and cut in the form of sippets, with an egg served on each:—it makes a pretty supper-dish. Tender young spinage, without any redundancy of vegetable blood or bile in it, may be boiled in a close vessel, with no more water than what hangs about the leaves when washed; but it is seldom so free of bitterness as when boiled in water ; and we can see no good reason for the omission. TURNIPS. Pare off all that would be hard, woody, and stringy when boiled. Boil them in plenty of water, for from three-quarters of an hour to nearly two hours, accord- ing to the age and size. Drain and serve them whole, or, if too large, divided. A bit of the green top shoot is left on young turnips and on Swedish turnips. Swedish turnip-tops are very delicate greens when young. TO DRESS TURNIPS For the Second Course,—a French Mode. Cut them into cubes, oblong forms, &c., or scoop them out as balls, pears, peaches, plums, &c., and, after boiling in salt and water with a piece of butter, dress them in melted butter, and season with nutmeg. Ohs.—They are useful to fill up a table when other vegetables are not to be got. TO WASH TURNIPS. When the turnips are boiled as above directed.

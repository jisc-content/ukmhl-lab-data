Bone the shoulder of mutton, when kept till very ten- der, and lay it to steep in wine, vinegar, herbs, and spices. Make a forcemeat of the trimmings and the kidney, tongue, &c. with oysters or mushrooms. Stuff the shoulder,—cover it with veal-caul; roast or braise it, and serve with venison-sauce. Garlic gives it the flavour of foreign cookery. Sheep’s Trotters.—Stew in a braise, and serve with sauce Robert. See French Cookery. MADE-DISHES OF COLD MUTTON. Dressed mutton may be warmed up either by hash- ing, stewing in broth, or broiling in a Dutch oven. The last mode is suitable to a blade-bone, which may be scored, seasoned, broiled, and served with any re- lishing sauce. To hash Mutton.—Cut the white underdone parts into thin slices, about the size of a shilling. Prepare a gravy from the gristles and other trimmings, and season it with pepper, salt, and onion. Skim off the fat, and strain it, and putting the meat to it, let it soak till thoroughly warm, but it must not boil. Minced Mutton with Cucumbers.—Mince the best parts left of a cold roasted leg, and stir this into a mince of stewed cucumbers. Let it heat, but not boil. Obs.—Minced mutton may also be served with en- dive. N. B.—Almost every dish made of mutton may be prepared of lamb. Casserole of dressed Mutton.—Line a mould with mashed potatoes; fill it with the mutton properly sea- soned ; cover the whole with more mashed potatoes, and bake and turn it out. Haricot of cold Mutton.—Cut the cold meat into chops, trimming off all superfluous fat, and simmer it very slowly in any strong well-seasoned broth you may have ready, or may make of the mutton-bones.

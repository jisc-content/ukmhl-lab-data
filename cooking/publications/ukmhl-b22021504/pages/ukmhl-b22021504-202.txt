CHAP. VI.—PISH. 194 cover with a light paste. A little soy, wine, cayenne, and catsup will make this pie more relishing. Obs.—Some knowing gourmands have those pies made of alternate layers of lobster and oyster-meat, and bread-crumbs, with balls of pounded oysters, and lobster-coral and essence of anchovies. AN EEL, MACKEREL, OR HERRING PIE. Skin and clean the fish, cut them in handsome pieces, and season highly with pepper, allspice, and salt; stick bits of butter about the fish, and put a little vin- egar in the dish. Cover it with a common crust. Obs.—The Club did not approve of this dish when covered with crust. It may have an edging. A SAVOURY SHRIMP OR PRAWN PIE MAIGRE. Have as many well-cleaned shrimps or prawns as W’ill nearly fill the pie-dish. Season with pounded mace, cloves, a little cayenne and Chili vinegar. Put some butter in the dish, and cover with a light puff-paste. Less than three quarters of an hour will bake them. AN EXCELLENT SALT-PISH PIE MAIGRE. This may be made of either cod or haddocks salted, but not too dry. Steep and boil the fish. Trim away all skins, bones, and fins, and cut them into thin handsome pieces. Boil hard, and peel half a dozen eggs, and slice them thin; do the same with as many well-sized onions. Have plenty of parboiled potatoes sliced. Place some bits of butter and a layer of potatoes in the bottom of a large pie- dish, then fish, then eggs, then onions, and again but- ter, thus filling up the dish, shaking pepper over every separate layer, and putting butter over each. Make a sauce of chopped hard-boiled yolks of eggs, melted butter, a little made mustard, and essence of anchovy, or soy, and pour it over the pie. Cover it with a puff- paste, or mashed potatoes, scolloped round the edge, and glazed with eggs. This pie will not require much of the oven.

Having washed, lay them, head downwards, in a pan of cold water and salt, which will bring out all in- sects, and boil them on a strainer in plenty of boiling water, with a little salt; some cooks add a bit of su- gar. Skim the water well: from ten minutes to twenty will boil them. When the stalks are nearly tender they are ready. If some heads are larger than others, put in the large ones first. 06s.—Brocoli is sometimes served at supper, like asparagus, on a toast. Melted butter is usually sent to table with both brocoli and cauliflower. Cauli- flower is very nicely dressed for a second course by pulling it into handsome branches, parboiling them, and then stewing a few minutes in a sauce of white broth, seasoned with mace, white pepper, and salt, and thickened with a little sweet cream, and a bit of butter kneaded in flour. TO DRESS ASPARAGUS AND SEA-KALE. Scrape the stalks of asparagus nicely clean; throw them into cold water; tie them up in bundles of about three inches thick, with tape or rushes; cut these bundles of equal lengths, leaving about an inch of stalk, and put them into a stewpan of quick-boiling water, with salt. Notice when the stalks are tender, and take them up before they lose their flavour or com- plexion. Have ready, nicely toasted, a slice of a large round loaf; dip it for a few seconds into hot water, and, laying it in the middle of the dish, serve the as- paragus upon it with the heads inward. Serve beat butter in a boat. The same receipt is applicable to sea-kale, except that no bread is served with it.* TO BOIL ARTICHOKES. Strip off the coarse outer leaves, and cut off the stalks. Steep and wash them in plenty of cold water, and boil • So well was the cultivation of vegetables understood by the Romans, that at Taverna asparagus were raised for the tables of the great, of which three weighed a pound. Nettle-tops, elder-buds, and diver, were among their pot-herbs.

300 CHAP. I MADE-DISHES. &c. Add a half-dozen of button-onions, some round slices of carrot, and a turnip cut down. Season with pepper and allspice, and serve the stew in a soup- dish. Obs.—This is a good and economical way of dress- ing cold roast mutton for family use. MADE-DISHES OF LAMB. Breast of Lamb with Cucumbers.—Chop off the chine-bone, and notching the breast well, stew it in good gravy for twenty minutes. Take it up, drain and score it in diamonds. Season it with mixed spices, dredge it with flour, and finish in a Dutch oven, or on the gridiron. Serve on stewed cucumbers. Lamb-Cutlets with Spinage.—Take cutlets from the loin ; flatten, season, and broil them; and placing stewed spinage neatly in a dish, lay the cutlets round it. Lamb-cutlets are also very elegantly served with a ragout of mushrooms or oysters, the cutlets laid around the ragout. Asparagus, or asparagus peas, is very suitable to lamb. Shoulder of Lamb stuffed.—Bone the shoulder, and fill up the vacancy with forcemeat. Braise the meat very slowly over embers, or a stove; or stew it plain- ly in the same manner. Glaze it, and serve with sorrel-sauce, tomata-sauce, or stewed cucumbers. Lamb-Steaks Ragout.—Stew them in veal-broth, to which a little sweet milk is put, and season with white pepper and mace. When nearty ready, thicken the sauce with a little mushroom-powder, a bit of butter rolled in flour, and add a large glassful of good cream. Lamb-Steaks Brown, see p. 119.—Flatten and season them. Brush them with egg, and roll them in a sea- soning of chopped parsley, bread-crumbs, grated le- mon-peel, nutmeg, and salt. Fry them of a fine light- brown, and pour over them some good thickened gravy, a glass of wine, and either a feAV stewed oys- ters or mushrooms. Skim the sauce, and serve the dish very hot, garnishing it with forcemeat-balls, fried bread, or cut pickles if requisite.

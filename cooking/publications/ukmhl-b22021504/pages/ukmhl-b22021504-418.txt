CHAP. V.—ORNAMENTAL DISHES. 410 soft, changing the water. Beat this in a marble mor- tar, and put to it a spoonful of ratafia, the juice of the orange strained, four ounces of fine sugar, and the yolks of four eggs. Beat these ingredients thoroughly well together for a quarter of an hour, and then by degrees mix them with a pint of cream that has boiled; keep beating till the whole is cold; then put it into custard-cups, and set these in a kettle of boil- ing water. Wipe the cups, let the cream thicken by cooling, and garnish with thin parings of preserved orange-chips. Obs.—By the addition of isinglass this cream may be made in a shape. Lemon-Cream.—Make as coffee-cream, but use le- mon-rind instead of coffee, to give the flavour. Obs.—1C very variety of cream may be made in the same manner, only changing the flavour, as pistachio cre&m of the nuts. Chocolate and tea creams, by em- ploying an infusion as in coffee. Orange-Jlotvers make an elegant cream. Canary or Sack Cream.—To a half-pint of cream add one of sweetmilk, and sweeten, put to it the beat yolk of an egg or two, and a bit of lemon-rind, and a glass of wine. Stir over the fire, but take care it does not curdle, Sgrve in glass cups, with bits of toast or small light biscuits. CREAMS OF PRESERVED OR FRESH FRUITS. Raspberry or Strawberry Cream, not iced.—Mash the ripe fruit, and boil down the drained juice with fine sugar. Have a strong whip made of sweetened cream. With what remains mix the beat yolks of eggs, and when cold, mix the fruit with this, and serve the whip over it. Obs.—This will make equally well of preserved jel- lies or jams, by freeing the latter of all seeds and skins; or it may be made in a shape by mixing an ounce of melted isinglass with a quart of cream, straining it, and when cool, adding the fruit-syrup with it, and filling the mould. Pine-Apple Cream.—Infuse the rind of a pine- apple in boiling cream, and proceed as in other creams, only this is almost always moulded.

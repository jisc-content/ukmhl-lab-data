CHAP. III. NATIONAL DISHES. 373 It is applicable to all kinds of game, poultry, and meat. Fowls may be stuffed with hard eggs, chop- ped parsley, oysters, &c. ; veal, with a forcemeat; goose, pig, and duck, with apples or onions, as the sauce is wanted. The things must be well skewered, or sewed before they are put into the dough, which forms a crust about the meat; thus combining bread, meat, and sauce, in one dish. LE BON DIABLE. This favourite bonne Louche, for which ive have ob- tained the receipt from a lady who has contributed many valuable articles to this work, is thus prepared at Pondicherry:—Score the devil, whether of duck, goose, or Turkey, deeply in all directions; and, sea- soning it highly with mixed spices, send it from the table to be broiled. Meanwhile take from each dish at table a spoonful of sauce or gravy, and, stirring this well in a silver saucepan over the fire, have it ready boiling-liot to pour over the grill, or Le bon (li- able, which is then handed round. Obs.—The parts usually deviled are the rump, the gizzard, and drum-sticks. Soy, lemon-juice, and made-mustard may be added to the sauce. See Devils and Salmis. INDIAN BDKDWAN. This eastern preparation is of the English genus, de- vil, or French Salmi. It is made of poultry, rabbits, venison, kid, game, but is best of the latter. Make a sauce of melted butter with cayenne, or afresh chilie if possible; a bit of garlic, essence of anchovy, and a sliced Spanish onion. Stew over a spirit-lamp till the onion is pulpy, when the Burdwan will be ready. Squeeze in a lime or Seville orange. Serve round very hot.* * It would be very easy to swell this section of the Manual with a formidable array of uncouth dishes and strange names, with Indian, Syrian, Turkish, and Persian Yaughs, Kabaubs, and ('us. cussuies, as modern travellers, and particularly tile French, have paid considerable attention to Asiatic cookery ; but this we consid- er mere waste of space, which may be more usefully employed.

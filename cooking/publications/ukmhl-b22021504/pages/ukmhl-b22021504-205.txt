CHAP. VI. FISH. 197 the spawn in a regular manner in layers or alternate pieces, so that when sliced it may have that marbled appearance, that look of mosaic work which so much commends the taste of the cook. Press the layers into a potting-can, and bake with butter in a slow oven for about a half-hour. When cold, take off the butter, pack the meat in small potting-cans, and pour clari- fied butter over it. Obs.—What is left of this butter will be very re- lishing for sauces. Potted lobster may be dressed as a fricassee in a Bechamel or cream sauce, or eaten cold. Lobsters for sauce when the fish are out of season, may be well preserved in this way. LOBSTER HAUT GOUT. H. JEKYLL, ESQ. Pick the firm meat from a parboiled lobster or two, and take also the inside, if not thin and watery. Sea- son highly with white pepper, cayenne, pounded mace and cloves, nutmeg, and salt. Take a little well-flavoured gravy—for example the jelly of roast veal, a few tiny bits of butter, a spoonful of soy or walnut-catsup, or of any favourite-flavoured vinegar, and a spoonful of red wine. Stew the cut lobster in this sauce for a few minutes. Obs.—This is one of those delicate messes which the gourmet loves to cook for himself in a silver dish held over a spirit-lamp, or in a silver stew-pan ; the prepa- ration of the morsel being to him the better part of it. TO BOAST A LOBSTER. When parboiled, rub it with plenty of butter, and lay it in a Dutch oven or before the fire; b^ste it till it froth; dredge lightly with flour, and baste again. TO BUTTER LOBSTERS. Warm the meat cut into nice bits, in a little good brown gravy. Season with spices, nutmeg, and salt, and thicken with butter kneaded in browned flour; or dress them white in clear gravy and a little cream, seasoning with white pepper and salt. Prawns and

CHAP. VI. FISH. 171 trails have been taken must be well cleaned from the blood, &c. Throw the whole into cold water made brackish with salt. Place the head and tail on the strainer, and put them in a fish-kettle of boiling water, with a little salt and vinegar; let them boil five minutes; lift the strainer, and lay on the slices ; take off whatever scum arises, for it is very easy to injure the colour of fresh salmon.

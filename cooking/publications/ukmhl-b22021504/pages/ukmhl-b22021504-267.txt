CHAP. VIII.—SAUCES, ESSENCES, &C. 259 Currie Vinegar may be made by steeping currie- powder, in the proportion of two ounces to the quart in the best vinegar, and straining and filtering for use. Raspberry Vinegar.—Pour on fresh-gathered rasp- berries, put into a large stone or china dish, the best champagne vinegar, in the proportion of a bottle to two quarts of fruit. Next day pour off the liquor, and pour a little more vinegar over the fruit; but where the fruit is plenty and cheap, you need not mind expressing the juice too carefully ; strain through a sieve, but do not bruise the fruit. To every pint of the vinegar and juice which are now blended, allow a full pound of good refined sugar. Break it in pieces, and dissolve it in the juice. Place the whole in a stone-jar, (not a glazed earthen one,) and put the jar covered in a kettle of boiling water for an hour; take off what scum arises; when cool, bottle the vinegar for use. This is an exceedingly pleasant beverage in hot weather. Two spoonfuls mixed with water make a delicious draught; but the large quantity of acid which it contains may in some cases render it an im- proper one. ROSE VINEGAR FOR SALADS, OR FOR THE TOILETTE. Put a quarter a pound of rose-leaves to four pints of good vinegar, and some roots of the Florence lily. Infuse till a fine tincture is obtained, and strain off the infusion. LAVENDER VINEGAR FOR THE TOILETTE, A FRENCH PREPARATION. To every pint of the best champagne vinegar put half an ounce of fresh lavender-flowers, and the thin rind of a lemon. Infuse for twenty-four hours in a stone- jar, then take the jar and set it over hot embers to di- gest for ten or twelve hours. Filter and bottle it, dip- ping the corks in wax. HERB WINES, &C.

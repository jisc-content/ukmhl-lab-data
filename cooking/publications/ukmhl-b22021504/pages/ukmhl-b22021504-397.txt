This is an elegant, though secondary class of culi- nary preparations, and is as much admired by the economist as the gourmand. Where dinners have been given, or are in course of preparation, it is easy to make a dish of savoury patties, with small trouble and almost no expense. Patties are made of a variety of things, as cold veal, fowl, rabbit, hare, lobsters, oysters, &c. They admit of all manner of seasonings, and must be nicely minced.

Stir the mince in this till quite hot, and fill up the patties, which are best baked empty, as the minced meat hardens in the baking. Rabbit and Hare Patties.—Mince the best parts of a cold roast rabbit or hare, very fine, with a little

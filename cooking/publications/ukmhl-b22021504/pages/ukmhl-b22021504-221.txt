CHAP. VII.—VEGETABLES AND ROOTS. 213 drain them, and mash them with a wooden spoon through a colander. Return them into the stewpan to warm, with a piece of fresh butter, white pepper, and salt. When mixed well with the butter, place them neatly in the dish, and mark in diamonds or sippets. Obs.—Mrs Dods put a little powdered ginger to her mashed turnips, which were studiously chosen of the yellow, sweet, juicy sort, for which Scotland is cele- brated,—that kind which, in our days of semi-bar- barism, were served raw, as a delicate whet before dinner, as turnips are in Russia at the present day. Mashed turnips to be eaten with boiled fowl or veal, or the more insipid meats, are considerably improved by the Cleikum seasoning of ginger, which, besides, corrects the flatulent properties of this esculent. Yel- low turnips, mashed and eaten with milk, are recom- mended in scurvy and consumption. A small pro- portion of turnips answers very well mashed with po- tatoes : they must be boiled for a good while before the potatoes are put in. They eat well with boiled or roasted mutton. CARROTS AND PARSNIPS. These roots, if old, require long boiling. Wash young carrots, and scrub them with a hard brush. Old ones must be scraped lightly, and when boiled, have the peel rubbed off with a coarse towel. They are served with boiled mutton or beef, whether fresh or salted. If large, they may be sliced, either length- ways or across. Obs—Some persons like cold carrot with cold beef; but they taste sweet and mawkish. Parsnips may either be mashed with butter or cream, served whole, or, if large, quartered. Turnips, carrots, and parsnips, will all warm up very well in a vessel plung- ed in boiling water. CARROTS THE FLEMISH WAY. Prepare (after boiling) in nice forms, as stars, wheels, &c., and stew them in melted butter, with minced parsley, young onions, salt and pepper. i 2

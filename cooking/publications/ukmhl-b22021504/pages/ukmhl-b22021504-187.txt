In the same manner salmon may be cabeached ; but if taken fresh out of the water, it is liable to break, which it will not do after being kept a few days. Obs.—Escabeche, in Spanish, signifies c Fish-Pic- kle.’ In-the seaports of Spain, they escabeche their fish, which they send inland as presents to their friends. The preparation is similar to the dish here mentioned, with the addition of a large portion of garlic and bay- leaves. The Spaniards eat it with ginger and salad, and sometimes stew it lightly.—Dr Hunter. TO DRESS SALT COD, LING, TUSK, &C. The fish must be soaked for a length of time corre- sponding to its dryness and the hardness it has ac- quired. Soak it in cold water for a night; that done, if still hard, beat it well with a paste-roller, or brush it with a hard brush, and soak it in lukewarm water. Let it come very slowly to boil. When it has sim- mered for an hour and a half by the side of the fire, take up the pieces ; clean off the tough filmy skin, and trim them neatly from bones, &c. . Place them in the stew-pan, or on the strainer, and pour boiling water over them, which will both freshen and soften the fish. Never allow the fish to boil till it is almost ready. Serve with egg-sauce, or parsnips mashed with plenty of butter. Mashed potatoes are also served with salt fish, and mustard must never be for- gotten. Garnish with hard-boiled eggs in circular slices, yolks and white. Obs.—At sea, salt fish is dressed after a very pala- table, if not refined fashion, by pulling it, when boiled, into flakes, and beating it up with mashed potatoes and butter. In New England, where the management of dry cod is very well understood, it is alternately soaked and laid on a table till sufficient- ly softened, which is thought a better method than I continual soaking-.

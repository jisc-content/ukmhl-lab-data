OF BILLS OF FARE. Tables should be like pictures to the sight. Some dishes cast in shade, some spread in light; Some should be moved when broken, others last Through the whole treat, incentive to the taste. King's Cookery. As landmarks to the inexperienced housekeeper, we subjoin a few bills of fare, observing, at the same time, that these must, in every instance, be left to individual taste and discretion. Bills of fare may be varied in endless ways,â€”nor can any specific rules be given for selecting dishes for the table, which must depend wholly on fortune, fashion, the season of the year, local situation, and a variety of circumstances. Neat- ness and propriety alone are of universal obligation in the regulation of every table, from the humblest to the most splendid. To the credit of the age it may be remarked, that modern fashion inclines more to a few dishes, well selected and elegantly disposed, than to that heterogeneous accumulation of good things with which notable British housewives used to con- ceal their table-linen. The culinary tastes of our po- lite neighbours are imperceptibly undermining some points of our ancient national faith. At genteel tables, very rich puddings, cakes, and fat meat-pies, have lost ground. Creams, jellies, and preserved and cara- melled fruits or compotes, take their place. Fish is more simply cooked than it formerly was. Putrid game is no longer admired; and the native flavour of all viands is more sedulously preserved by a better style of cookery. The manner of laying out a fashionable table is nearly the same in all quarters of the united king- doms ; yet there are trifling local peculiarities to which the prudent housewife in middle life must attend. A centre-ornament, whether it be called a dormant, a plateau, an cpergne, or a candelabra, is found so con- venient, and contributes so much to the good appear- ance ot the table, that a fashionable dinner is now sel- dom set out without something of this kind.

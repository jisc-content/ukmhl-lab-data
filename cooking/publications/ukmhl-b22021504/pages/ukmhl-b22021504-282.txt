CHAP. I.—MADE-DI6HES. 274 TO STEW A SHIN OF BEEF. Have the shin-bone sawed across in three different places. Place skewers in the stew-pot, and lay the meat on them with as much water as will nearly cover it. When it is skimmed, put in a bundle of herbs, a head of celery cut, four onions, and a dessert-spoonful of black and Jamaica peppercorns; cover the pot very close, and let the meat stew slowly for three hours, when cut carrots may be put to it, and afterwards cut turnip, with a dozen of small onions roasted and peel- ed. Make a sauce for the Bouilli, by thickening and then seasoning a pint of the gravy with catsup, spices, and a little made mustard. The French sauce hackee is also very suitable garnish with the onions. BEEF ALAMODE. The clod, the mouse-buttock, the rump, or the thick of the flank, may be dressed this way. Take from six to ten pounds, and rub it well with mixed spices and salt, and dredge it with flour. Lay skewers in the bottom of a well-tinned stew-pan, and on them spread some thin slices of good bacon; place the meat on these, with a few more slices of bacon above, and a small quantity of vinegar and gravy, or good broth. Make the stew-pan very close, and let the meat stew as slowly as possible over embers for two hours. Turn it, and put to the gravy a high season- ing of cloves, black and Jamaica pepper, with a few bay-leaves and mushrooms if in season, or a little cat- sup, and a few button-onions roasted. Let it again stew very slowly till the meat is tender. Pick out the bay-leaves, and serve the meat in a tureen with the gravy, which, if it is slowly stewed, will have thickened to the consistence of glaze. Veal is very good dressed in the same manner. The gristly part of the breast is best adapted for this purpose ; and le- mon-grate may be added to the seasonings, but no catsup. Ohs.—The Culotte de Bceuf d la Gellc of the French

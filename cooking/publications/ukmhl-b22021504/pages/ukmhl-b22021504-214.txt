CHAP. VI.—FISH. 206 roughly pounded, nine cloves, and a small dessert- spoonful of black pepper bruised. Pour over these ingredients a large half-pint of port wine vinegar, and simmer slowly in a silver or new block-tin saucepan, or earthen pipkin, till the bones of the anchovies are dissolved. Add a few grains of cochineal if the colour is not good. Strain the liquor through a hair- sieve, and, when cold, bottle it for use, securing the vials well with corks and. leather When to be used shake the vials before pouring out the sauce;—two table-spoonfuls will impart a high flavour to four ounces of beat butter, in which it must be simmered for a minute before it is served. TO REFRESH RUSTY ANCHOVIES, AND TURN THE LIQUOR TO ACCOUNT. Pick out all the best anchovies of your parcel, and pack them in a fresh glass jar, strewing a little bole- armeniac and salt between the layers ; cork and cover them over very close. Put the refuse into a clean saucepan, with a tea-spoonful of salt to every half- pint, four cloves of garlic peeled and chopped, a des- sert-spoonful of black pepper and another of ginger, and cloves in equal proportion,—all bruised. Add a pint of oysters with their liquor, or muscles and cockles in the same quantity, and boil till the bones of the anchovies are dissolved. Strain the liquor, and give it a boil up with a half-pint of claret and a glass of good vinegar. When cold, pour it into small bottles, and use, as catsup, to flavour hashes, fish-pies, or made-dishes. It is a high though cheap relish, and will go far in flavouring.

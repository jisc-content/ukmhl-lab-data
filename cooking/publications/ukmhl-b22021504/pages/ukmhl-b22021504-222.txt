214 CHAP. VII.—VEGETABLES AND ROOTS. BEET-ROOTS. Though chiefly used in winter salads, or for pickling, beet-roots may be dressed as parsnips, and served as a garnishing for boiled beef, or with salt fish. Wash, and, without touching with the knife, boil them whole, or bake them. If broken, the colour will fly. Par- boiled beet-root may be sliced, and stewed with small onions in a little cream or gravy, with seasonings and a spoonful of vinegar. Dish the slices of beet-root with the small onions round them. Beet-root, besides being wholesome and palatable, is exceedingly orna- mental in salads, and for garnishing, and makes a cheap and beautiful common pickle. TO STEW AND ROAST ONIONS. Scald and peel a dozen middle-sized, or four or five large Spanish onions. If old and acrid, parboil them, and stew very slowly for nearly an hour in good broth, with white pepper and salt; thicken the sauce with a little butter kneaded in flour, and, dishing the onions in a small hash-dish, pour it over them. A little mushroom-catsup may be added. Onions are roasted before the fire in their skins, peeled, and served with cold butter and salt. They are eaten either alone or with roasted potatoes, or with red or pickled herrings. In the latter case, we would re- commend mustard as well as butter. Obs.—Stewed and roasted onions used to be a fa- vourite supper-dish in Scotland, and were reckoned medicinal. The onions were stewed (after boiling) in a butter-sauce, to which cream was put,—the sauce blanche of France.* Onions may be farced. * k‘ We now,” said Touchwood, “ rarely see a dish of onions, yet I have much to say in behalf of this homely patriarchal relishf which is of such immense consequence in giving gusto to the food o, those who cannot reach the costly compound essences that are gra- dually subverting it in the kitchens of the rich. In the early part of the last century Swift sung— “ There is, in every Cook's opinion, “ No savoury dish without an onion

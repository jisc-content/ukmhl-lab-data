Mushroom catsup is the most esteemed of this class of preparations. Large flap mushrooms, which con- tain a great deal of juice, and do not answer for pick- ling or stewing, are best adapted to making catsup. Let the mushrooms be wholesome, (see page 217 ) Without washing them, pick off whatever looks dirty or corrupted, and breaking in pieces, lay them in an earthen jar, strewing salt about them. Throw a folded cloth over the jar, and set it by the fire, or in a very cool oven. Let it remain thus for twenty-four hours or more, and then strain off the liquor into a clean saucepan. To every quart of boiled liquor put a half-

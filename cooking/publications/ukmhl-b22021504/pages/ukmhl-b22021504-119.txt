Ill CHAP. II. ROASTING. done. Serve on a toast soaked in the dripping-pan, and put brown beef gravy in the dish. In this and the above receipt we recommend plain melted butter to those who wish to retain the native flavour of the birds.—Rice Sauce, or Pleydel s Sauce. TO ROAST PIGEONS. Let them be cropped and drawn as soon as killed, and Wiped inside as well as possible. They will be ready for the spit in from twelve to forty-eight hours, according to the weather, and are in high season from June to November. If kept too long, they lose the flavour. When to be dressed, they must be very well washed in several waters. Stuff with parsley par- boiled and chopped, and about the size of a nutmeg of butter for each bird, a few bread-crumbs, and the liver chopped, if it is liked. Season rather highly with pepper and salt. Twenty to twenty-five minutes will roast them. Dust with flour, and froth with fresh butter. Parsley and butter, or plain melted but- ter, is served in the dish, and is more suitable for well-flavoured birds of all kinds, than meat gravy, which has so strong a predominating flavour of its own.—Bread sauce, Orange gravy sauce, or rice sauce. Serve with dressed French beans, or asparagus, or cucumber. Garnish with fried bread-crumbs, or slices of orange. TO ROAST LARKS AND WHEAT-EARS. When well cleaned, dip them in yolk of egg, and roll them in bread-crumbs. Put a small bit of butter in each bird. Spit on a lark-spit, and fasten that to the spit. Baste with plenty of good butter, which is most essential in roasting all the smaller birds. Strew sifted bread-crumbs over the birds as they roast. From twelve to fifteen minutes will do them. Serve fried bread-crumbs, and garnish with fried crumbs or crisp f parsley. Obs.—Some good cooks put a thin small slice of bacon between the birds when they are spitted.

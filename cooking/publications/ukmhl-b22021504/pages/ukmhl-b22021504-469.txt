B.—For Brown Spruce use treacle instead of loaf- sugar, or coarse brown sugar. Ginger-Beer, of a superior Kind, for keeping.—Take four pounds of loaf-sugar, four ounces or more of bruised ginger, and four gallons of water. Boil for a half-hour, and skim this. Slice two lemons or more into a tub, and put to them one ounce of cream of tar- tar. Pour the hot liquor over this, and when cool, add a half-pint or rather less of fresh beer-yeast. Let this work for three or four days. Strain it off clear from the lees, and add to it, if it is to be kept, a half-pint of brandy. Bottle in a week or ten days, and wire the corks. Common Ginger-Beer.—Make as above, but take a third less sugar, (brown sugar will do), and no le- mons nor brandy. Ferment for four days, and bottle for use. Treacle-Beer, a Table-Beer.—Boil, for twenty mi- nutes, three pounds of molasses, in from six to eight gallons of soft water, and a handful of hops tied in a muslin rag, or a little extract of gentian. When cooled in the tub, add a pint of good beer-yeast, or from four to six quarts of fresh worts from the brew- er’s vat. Cover the beer (and all fermenting liquids) with blankets or coarse cloths. Pour it from the lees and bottle it. You may use sugar, which is lighter. N. B.—This is a cheap and very wholesome bever- age. A little ginger may be added to the boiling li- quid if the flavour is liked.* ON BOTTLING LIQUORS, AND ON CORKS, BOTTLE- WAX, &C. &C. “ The penny-wise and pound-foolish” principle is not shown in any part of domestic management more de- * Excellent plain directions for brewing ale and beer of malt, on the small scale, suited to families in the middling ranks of life, or under that, are given in Cobbett’s Cottaqe Economy.

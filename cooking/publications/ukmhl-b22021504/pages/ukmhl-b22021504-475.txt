CHAP. IX.—MISCELLANEOUS RECEIPTS, &C. 467 ture of made-mustard in coffee, is also reckoned good for rheumatic persons. Coffee is also considered bene- ficial in dull headache. Roasted acorns, beech-mast, rye, pease, beans, &c. &c., are all used as substitutes for coffee. Coffee-Milk.—Boil coffee-powder, according to the strength you want it, in new milk, for five minutes. Allow it to settle, and pour it off, or clear it with a few bits of isinglass. Chocolate, to make.—Never make chocolate till it is to be used. Boil equal quantities of good new milk, and water. Scrape down the chocolate according to the strength and quantity wanted, and take the milk and water off the fire. Throw in the chocolate and sugar, and mill it well and rapidly, that it may be served with the froth on it, and completely blended with the milk. Obs.—Chocolate is sometimes made in gruel for de- licate persons. Where much is used, it is thought an economical plan to make a pint of very strong choco- late, and to boil up a couple or three or four spoon- fuls of this, in milk, water, and sugar, as it is wanted, milling it well. Waters, for cooling Draughts, of preserved or fresh Fruits.—Lemon Water and Orange-juice Water Pour boiling water on the preserved or sliced fresh fruit, or squeeze out the juice, boil it up in a little thin syrup, and put water to it as it is wanted.

To stew Prunes.—Put them in a nice small sauce- pan with very little water, and stew till soft, but not to a mash. Gruels of Fruit.—Boil currants, black or red, or cranberries, in their juice, with sugar and nutmeg to taste, or use the jam of those fruits. Oatmeal Gruel, in the best Manner, as made in Scotland.-—Take very finely-ground oatmeal, of the best quality. Infuse as much as you wish in cold wa- ter for an hour or two.

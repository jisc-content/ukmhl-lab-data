CHAP. V.—BROTHS, SOUPS, AND GRAVIES. 167 a few minutes, still trying if it is ready, by putting a little to cool. This soup is preserved in various ways ; the best way, when for family consumption, is to put it into very shallow jelly-pots, to be covered up when cool. But it will be more conveniently kept on a voyage if poured out on a flat asset into tablets, which may be divided, when cold, with a paste-runner, and when thoroughly dried, packed for use, in bladder or lea- ther, and kept in a dry place. When the soup is to be used as such, to a pint of boiling water, to which parsley, or young onion, or any flavour that is re- lished, is given by previous boiling, add a little ground pepper and salt, and from an ounce to an ounce and a half of the portable soup. Boil for a few minutes, and serve with toasted bread. A drop or two of catsup will improve the flavour. N. B.—An excellent portable-soup is made of neats’- feet alone. The bones must be broken, and the oil carefully removed. French cooks that study economy often use ox-heels in making stock for soup, jellies, both sweet and savoury, and also for sauces. Livers are also employed, and are sliced, fried, and stewed for stock to ox-tail or Mullagawtany soup. SPRING FRUIT-SOUPS. These are made of gourds, peeled rhubarb, &c. &c. They may either be made of cream, milk, or of good clear gravy; and seasoned to the taste of the eater. Peel, clean, and blanch a bundle of sticks of rhubarb, cut them in three-inch lengths, and put them to a couple of quarts of good veal or beef gravy, with two or three onions, a few thin slices of bread, crust and crumb together, and salt and cayenne. Skim off all the fat • and scum; simmer till tender; strain and serve on toasted sippets. This soup may also be made with a half-pound of butter kneaded in a little flour. N.

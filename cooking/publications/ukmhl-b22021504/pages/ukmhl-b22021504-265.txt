CHAP. VIII.—SAUCES, ESSENCES, &C. 257 Vinegar of Wine Lees.—Boil the wine-lees quickly for half an hour, skimming it well. Cask it and add some chervil to it. Stop the cask, and in a month it will be fit for use. Verjuice.—Gather some ripe crab-apples, and lay them in a heap to sweat; then throw away the stalks and decayed fruit, and having mashed the apples ex- press the juice. A cider or wine press will be useful for this purpose. Strain it, and in a month it will be ready. It is the best simple substitute for lemon- juice that can be found, and answers still better in place of sorrel. The French, for many dishes, pre- fer verjuice to lemon.

Put yeast to the liquor when strain- ed. Obs.—Vinegar makes much more readily if put into a vinegar-cask. A common vinegar may be made of several other things, but the best sorts of vi- negar, champagne and red wine vinegar, must be bought.

INTRODUCTION. 27 tor told prosy college-stories of college-feasts, and gave La- tin toasts; Winterblossom related anecdotes of the bon-vi- vans of another generation, and hummed catches most vilely; and the young man smoked his cigar and the whole party at once. In this happy hour, on which favouring stars shed pros- perous influences, was the Cleikum Club instituted. To conclude the entertainment, the Nabob produced a single bottle of choice Burgundy, Mont Ratchet; and a special bumper was dedicated to the new-comer. Coffee four years kept was prepared by the Nabob’s own hands—coffee which he had himself brought from Mocha—in a coffee-pot of Pa- risian invention patronized by Napoleon. Mrs Dods was afterwards courteously summoned to make tea; and the plan of the proposed club was submitted to her judgment. She startled a good deal at first; and was several times in danger of bolting off the course. But once fairly engaged, her zeal was unbounded; and long experience ren- dered her the most efficient member of the convocation. An extended correspondence was arranged with known amateur gourmands as well as practical persons; and also with those clubs, both provincial and metropolitan, of which the eating, rather than the erudite preparation, of dinners, had hitherto been the leading feature. Meanwhile, as every thing requires time, while the kitchen stores and utensils were getting into order, the Nabob, aided by his friend, delivered what might almost be called a course of lectures on the science of cookery in all its branches. For these, though exceedingly valuable from the curious facts they contained, as well as for their philosophical deductions, Mrs Dods had not patience. ‘ Let us to the wark!” she cried ; “ what business ha’e thae lang ink-horn-tailed words wi’ teaching wives to make Cock-a-leekie, or Friar’s chicken ?” “ Ay, there it is," cried Touchwood, “ the very term stamps truth on my theory.”

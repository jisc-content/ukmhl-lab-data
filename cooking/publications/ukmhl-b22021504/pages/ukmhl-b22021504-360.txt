352 CHAP. II.—FRENCH COOKERY. when arranged on paper, may be iced, baked in a moderate oven, and dried before the fire. This paste swells very much, which must be considered in form- ing the things made of it. Choux of Paste Royal.—Form in the shape of balls larger than children’s marbles. Bake in a moderate oven. Dry them, and make a small opening in the side, into which put a little of any sweetmeat you like. Pains a la Duckesse.—Make as the choux, but flat- ten them with the rolling-pin to the length of four inches. When baked, slit them open at the end, and introduce the sweetmeat. Les Gimbletles a la Artois.—Make as the choux, but give them a deep dint in the middle before baking. Widen this by turning your finger round in it. Sift sugar over them when just done; glaze with a sala- mander, and put the sweetmeats in the cavity. Les Petits Choux, el les Gimblettes Pralines.*—Make them rather smaller than above directed; and before baking, but when glazed, sprinkle finely-pounded sweet almonds and sugar over them, and garnish with sweetmeats, as the others. Paste-Buttons and Melvilles.—These may be made better of paste royal than of puff-paste, and it may, as formerly said, be rolled out, and dressed in any form you choose, serving any preserved sweetmeat neatly upon it. Chantilly Baskets.—French cooks make these of very small choux of pate royale, instead of the ratafia- biscuits used in this country. The method is the same. When the little biscuits or choux are quite crisp, have ready some sugar clarified and boiled to crackling height. Run a small skewer into each bis- cuit, and dip it in the sugar. Fix them one by one, as dipt, round a dish that will form your basket. When one row is done, begin another. The candied sugar will make the biscuits instantly stick. Use ra- ther larger biscuit for the upper tiers, as the basket should widen at the top. Three or four tiers will be enough of height. The handle will be most easily * What we would call confected.

To arrange them so as best to distribute the several things served up, is all that a dinner of this sub- stantial kind admits of. The soups may be placed either at the top and bottom or at the sides of the table; though, when there are large dishes of fish, the former arrangement seems the more eligible. At a very long table four soups may be placed at the top, bottom, and sides, and the four comers be each fur- nished with a dish of fish ; in which case the stews, boils, and roasts, are to be placed in change for the soups. Such an arrangement will better ensure to each guest a ready supply. The French call this sort of dinner an Ambigu, and then they remove only the soups.

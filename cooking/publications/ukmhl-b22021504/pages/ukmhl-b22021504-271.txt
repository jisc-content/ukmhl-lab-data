It may either be seasoned with pepper, salt, cloves, cat- sup, &c. or not, and is perhaps as generally useful plain. When cold, skim the browning, and bottle it for use. Obs.â€”It is very difficult, nay almost impossible, to .prepare browning free of an empyreumatic flavour, which is necessarily communicated to the dish that is coloured with it. Where sauces can be coloured with the catsup, browned flour, and wine, which may be employed, it is .much better to avoid the use of brown- ing ; and soup may always be made of a sufficiently rich colour by previously browning the meat and onions, and by using toasted bread; for there is no brown soup into which one or other of these things does not enter. Many cooks boil onion-skins, which contain a yellow dye, to colour soups; and it is a common, but slovenly practice, where browning is wanted in a hurry, to melt a knob of sugar between the hot bowls of tongs, and drop it into a little soup. This, on an emergency, may be useful, but the neces- sity ought to be avoided. The refuse of mushroom or walnut catsup boiled in brine, with a bit of Spa- nish juice, onion-skins, and burnt toasts, make a good but coarse browning. ~ PICKLES. These are an important class of culinary prepara- tions, and one about which the cook and notable housewife make no little bustle, and feel no small pride. Pickles are chiefly intended for a relishing accompaniment to many sorts of made-dishes and sauces, though a few of them are merely ornamental as garnishings.

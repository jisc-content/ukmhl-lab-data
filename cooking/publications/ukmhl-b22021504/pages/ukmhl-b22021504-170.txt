BROTHS, SOUPS, AND GRAVIES. cream, or milk thickened with rice-flour and butter, instead of stock ; but the mixture of milk with fish or meat is less relished every day, and even yolks of eggs, between which and animal substances there is a closer affinity, do not gain ground. Wine is a good deal employed by the French in the composition of fish- soups, and the rough and dry wines suit some tastes better than cream. In like manner mild ale or beer is sometimes employed in this country. A clear gravy of cow-heels makes an admirable basis for fish-soups, and is believed to be employed by those who deal largely in these compositions in great towns. OYSTER-SOUP. Have two quarts of a good strong clear stock, whe- ther of fish or meat, but we prefer veal. Add to it the hard-boiled yolks of six eggs, and the hard part of a quart of fresh juicy oysters, previously well pounded in a mortar. Simmer for a half-hour, and strain it into a fresh stew-pan, in which have the oysters cleared of the beards, and very nicely wash- ed from shells and sand. Season with mace and cayenne, and let the oysters simmer for eight minutes, when the yolks of three eggs well beat may be stir- red into a little of the soup, and gradually mixed with the whole quantity, drawing aside the stew-pan, and constantly stirring, lest they curdle. When smooth and thick, serve in a tureen, and still stir the soup for a minute, to prevent curdling. Any other flavour that is relished may be given to this luscious soup. • bc'ta 'r‘ ANOTHER oyster-soup. After bearding the oysters, dip them in beat egg, dust them with flour; run them on fine wire skewers, and fry and drain them. Place them in the tureen, and pour the soup over them- The beards, nut (or hard part,) and all the oyster-liquor saved, must be put to the soup, and boiled a little before it is strained. Obs.—This soup may be thickened with the beat yolks of three eggs; or have a half-pint of boiling cream put to it before it is served.

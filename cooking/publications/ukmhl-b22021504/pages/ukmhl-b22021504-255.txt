CHAP. VIII.—SAUCES, ESSENCES, &C. 247 Sauce for a Plum or Marrow Pudding.—A glass of white wine, a half-glass of brandy or old rum, or rum- shrub, pounded sugar to taste, the grate of a lemon, and a little cinnamon, stirred into a little thickened melted butter; sprinkle a little cinnamon on the top. pudding-sauce,—A Store-Sauce. A pint of canary, sherry, or Madeira, a quarter-pint of old rum (pine-apple is best), or of good brandy; a quarter-pint of Cura9oa, a half-ounce of good lemon- peel, the same quantity of Seville orange-peel, and half an ounce of mace. Infuse this for ten days, shaking the bottle every day. Strain it, and add a half-pint of rich clarified syrup. Bottle for use. This may be mixed with wine, cream, thin syrup, eau sucre, &c. for a sauce to puddings and sweet made-dishes. essence of ham,—or Ham-Sauce. This may be bought in London and other large cities. In country situations, a highly-flavoured gravy, which makes a great improvement to other gravies, may be made by breaking ham-bones to pieces, and cutting down all the good pickings left on them. Let this just catch over a slow fire for a quarter of an hour, adding butter or meat-gravy (jelly-gravy if you have it), and stirring it lest the meat and bones burn. When the ham has been treated in this way some time, add broth, a bundle of sweet herbs, and onion and peppercorns; strain it for use.

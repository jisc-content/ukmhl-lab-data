French cooks, and some English ones serve fried fish on a napkin. In Scotland, herrings are often dipped in oatmeal, and fried in plenty of dripping, with sliced onions. In France mustard is served with fresh herrings, and the practice is com- mendable. All these fish are occasionally broiled either split (Scoliice speldered) or whole. Wipe them very dry, dust them with flour, and broil over a clear moderate fire. Haddocks salted and hung for a day, or split and boned, are very good when broiled. Skin them, dust them with flour, lay them on the gridiron, and, if not split, put the opened part downmost. Turn them a few minutes on both sides, and they are done. Serve with cold fresh butter. Finnans, and Findhorn haddocks, are skinned and dressed as above. They may be taken from the gridiron when just done, dipped in hot water if dry or hard, and wrapped in a cloth to moisten. Serve wrapped up in a napkin. Obs.—An imitation of the Finnan haddock is now made by salting for a few hours, splitting, and wet- ting the fish with pyroligneous acid, and hanging them to dry. Broiled haddocks, whether fresh or reisted, or as Finnans, are held in great esteem by those who relish a good breakfast. The latter com- modity is now regularly forwarded from Aberdeen to Edinburgh and London by the mail-coach. They may be very well dressed on a heater before the fire, or in a Dutch oven, and are equally fit for breakfast or sup- per. TO DRESS SLICES OF HOLIBUT, LING, OR TUSK, For a Maigre Dish.

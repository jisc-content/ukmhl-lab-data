Put a broken knuckle of veal, or the gristly ends of two knuckles, in a deep earthen pan, with two cow-heels, the half of a calf’s-head broken, four onions, a dozen of peppercorns, three blades of mace, and a few sprigs of lemon-thyme, a shalot, or any other flavour- ing substance that is best relished by those for whom the soup is prepared. Fill up the dish with water or weak broth; tie several folds of paper round the mouth of it, and set it in an oven for upwards of two hours. When it is cold take off the fat from the jel- ly, cut the meat into mouthfuls, and stew it up with the jelly till perfectly tender.

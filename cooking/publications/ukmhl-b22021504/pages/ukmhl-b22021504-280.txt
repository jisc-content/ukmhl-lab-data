CHAP. I. MADE-DISHES. 272 seasoning is to be avoided, it is proper that made-dishes should rather be piquant than insipid. TO MAKE GLAZE FOR MADE-DISHES. To glaze Tongues, Fricandeaux, Hams, Sfc.—Cut down knuckle of veal, shin of beef, feet and trimmings of poultry, and a few slices of bacon. Let them catch over a quick fire, and pour in a little broth made of cow-heels or calf’s-liead. Stew till this is a strong jelly; strain and pot for use. An economical cook will seldom need to make glaze. She will save it. MADE-DISHES OF BEEF. To ragout or stem a Rump of Beef—Except for some particular purpose, a rump to be stewed should not be very broad, nor above ten inches in thickness, unless it be salted a little. Cut out the bone neatly, and break it; and with that and what trimmings may be made in levelling the meat, make a little gravy, seasoned with onions, a carrot, and turnip, and a bunch of sweet herbs. Season the rump highly with cook’s pepper and a little cayenne, and skewer and tie it firmly up with tape. Lay skewers or willow twigs in the bottom of a nice clean stew-pot that will just hold the meat, and place the rump upon them, straining over it the gravy drawn from the bones. When it has simmered for an hour or more, turn it over, and put to it three carrots sliced, two turnips scooped to the size of marbles; and in another half- hour onions sliced, and a glass of shalot-vinegar, or plain vinegar, with a couple of minced shalots, and more pepper if required. Keep the lid close the whole time; and before dishing, put in a large spoonful of catsup, and another of made-mustard, with butter rolled in flour to thicken the gravy. The rump may be dressed more highly by filling up the hole whence the bone is taken with a relishing forcemeat, egging and browning it before stewing, and putting some wine to the sauce, which may also be enriched with BAveetbreads or kernels, parboiled and cut into bits. Obs.-—A rump salted for four days in summer, or

Dip them in beat egg, and then in bread-crumbs rubbed through a colander. Fry them in plenty of oil, lard, or clarified dripping, making it quite hot. Take care in turning not to break them. If wanted very nice they may be twice dipt in egg and crumbs, or in biscuit-powder. Lay them on a sieve reversed, to drain the fat from them.

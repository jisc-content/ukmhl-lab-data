Make and butter a toast; having pared off the outer crust, moisten it in hot water or broth, soak it in the dripping, and serve the partridge on the toast. This is lighter than fried bread-crumbs, which some cooks use for these birds. Pheasants require gravy. It may be made of scrag of mutton, or knuckle of veal, but is better of beef, and best of all of game when that is in plenty.—See Brown Gravy Sauce, Bread Sauce, or Rice Sauce. Obs.—We do not recommend the ornament of the pheasant’s best tail-feather stuck in its tail, but such things are still heard of.

The proverb says, what is one man’s meat is another man’s poison. Tie them on a bird-spit, and lay them down to a clear brisk fire. Lay slices of toast in the dripping-pan, to catch the trail. These birds and moor-game require to be de- luged with butter in basting. Dish them on the toasts, pour clear brown beef gravy very hot into the dish, and set it on a hot table, or over steam or a chaf- ing-dish. These birds will take from twenty-five to thirty minutes, in proportion to the size.—Sauce, Pleydel’s sauce for wild-fowl. Garnish with slices of bitter orange, or lemon, and fried bread-crumbs. Ohs.—French cooks staff woodcocks with chopped truffles, and either roast them, or dress them with fire under and over the pot. # T£> ROAST GROUSE, BLACK COCK, AND PTARMIGAN.

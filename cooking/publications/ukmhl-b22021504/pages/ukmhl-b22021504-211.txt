CHAP. VI. FISH. 203 TO SCALLOP OYSTERS. Having stewed the oysters, as above directed, for two or three minutes in their own juice, have some bread- crumbs moistened with their liquor, a good piece of melted butter, and a little wine. Place some of this in scallop-shapes, and cover with a layer of oysters, then more moistened bread-crumbs and oysters, and finish with the bread-crumbs mixed with a little grated lemon-peel and finely-shred parsley. Put some bits of butter over the whole, and brown before the fire, or in a Dutch oven. TO GRILL OYSTERS. Blanch them in a stew-pan in their own strained juice. Wash them out of this, and in another stew- ' pan give them a toss with a bit of fresh butter and a little chopped parsley; but do not let them boil. Place them in their own shells, previously well clean- ed, and put some bits of butter over them. Place the shells on the gridiron; two minutes will do them. Nutmeg is added sometimes, both to scalloped and grilled oysters, but we do not approve of it. TO BROWN OYSTERS IN THEIR OWN JUICE, A Scotch Preparation. Wash them in their juice, and dip them one by one m yolk of egg beat up with a very little flour, pepper, and salt. Brown a good piece of butter in the frying- pan, and brown the oysters nicely over a quick fire • draw them aside, and pour their juice strained into the pan; thicken it with a very little flour kneaded in butter, and when it boils stir the oysters among it for a few minutes. This answers for brown sauce to cod’s- head and shoulders, calf's-head, &c.; but when to be served as a stew it may have a little catsup, bread- crumbs, and minced parsley added to it. Serve in a hot narslet1StiU hT^ Lemon-Peel and chopped paisley wi be an improvement. Muscles may be dressed in the same way. ^

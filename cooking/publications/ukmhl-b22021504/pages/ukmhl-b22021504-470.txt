These should al- ways be of the best cork-wood, whether for pickles, catsups, made-wines, or even the cheapest commodi- ties. Bottles are best when new; but, if well kept and thoroughly cleaned, they will answer quite well. They should always be washed when set away empty, and kept with the head downmost. Bottles that have contracted a bad smell may be fumigated by a lighted match after they are well brushed and washed. The shot used for cleaning bottles should be carefully re- moved before they are filled. Bottle-wax is sold rea- dy prepared, or is easily made thus:— Bottle-Wax.—A pound of rosin, a pound of bees- wax, and a half-pound of tallow.

When ready to boil over, stir with a candle- end, which will allay the ebullition. To prevent Liquors from having a corked Taste.— Dip the corks in a varnish made of equal quantities of purified wax and suet melted together, and repeat the dipping till the cork-wood is covered with the mixture.

353 CHAP. II. MADE-DISHES. made by sticking the biscuits together round the ledge of a stew-pan, first ascertaining the width of the arch ; for really what is ordered in common receipt-books, about “throwing over an arch,” is easier said than done. An ornamental border of coloured drops of gum-paste may be given to this. Serve any thing sweet you pre- fer in the basket, which should be lined with cam- bric-paper. Bouchees de Dames, Ladies’ Lips or Kisses.—Make a paste as for fine biscuits, of six fresh eggs, with six ounces of sifted sugar, and three of potato-flour. Beat this very well; spread it thinly, and bake on paper on a buttered oven-tin for nearly twenty minutes. When fine, stamp out the paste the size of dollars, and glaze with white, rose, or violet-coloured icing, or some of each.—See To Ice Cakes. The Twins, or Meringues Jumeaux.—Whip the whites of eight eggs to a firm froth, and add to this a pound of fine sifted sugar ; or clarify and boil it to the second degree. Season with lemon-grate, and beat all very well together. Drop them on paper in the shape of an egg. Sift sugar over them. Bake them in a slow oven. When firm, draw them out, and stick two and two together, and put them to dry before the fire or in a hot closet. Obs.—These meringues or twins may be made as above, but flavoured with marasquin or orange-flowers confected ; but they must then be made smaller. As has been said, an endless variety of trifles is made of paste royal, by purchasing the proper cut- ters or stamps. Among the neatest are the petits pa- niers and petitcs brioches, of which the proper stamp will direct the forming. A Fruit-cake.—Roll out any bits of puff-paste you have left from more important preparations. Spread marmalade over them. Decorate with paste bands or straws. Glaze the cake with yolk of egg; bake it, and cut it into oblong pieces, and pile them on the dish. See Darioles, Flans, &c.

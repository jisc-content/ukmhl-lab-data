CIIAP. VIII.—SAUCES, ESSENCES, &C- 248 SAUCES OF SHELL-FISH, AND FISH SAUCES. LOBSTER SAUCE, OR CRAB SAUCE,/})?- Turbot, §C. For sauce you must have a /te??-lobster, fresh (alive if possible), and full of spawn. When boiled, pound the spawn and coral with a bit of butter, or a very little oil. Rub this through a sieve into a sufficient quantity of melted butter, and mix it smooth. Cut the meat of the tail, &c. into small dice, and put these to the sauce, which may be heated up, but not boiled. This sauce is rendered more piquant by anchovies pounded, catsup, spices, walnut or lemon-pickles, &c.; but for fresh fish it is certainly better unmixed with overpowering foreign flavours. Besides, these addi- tions can be made extempore at table. Crab Sauce is made nearly as above. Pick the meat from the great and small claws, and a little of the soft inside when not watery ; stir this into melted butter.* Ohs.—Lobsters for sauce may be preserved potted; and the live spawn may be kept in brine, or in an ice- house.—Sauces for Lobsters, page 197- A sprinkling of the red coral rubbed through a sieve makes a pret- ty garnish to turbot, holibut, or other white fish. Sauce a l-Aurore.—This kind of lobster-sauce is made of the spawn only. Pound the spawn with butter; rub it through a coarse sieve, and thin it with a little clear broth; season it with salt, pepper, and lemon-juice. Obs.—This is served in France with trout or soles. Oyster-Sauce, for boiled Turkey, Fish, §c-—Open the oysters when you are just ready to make the sauce; save their liquor, strain it, and put it to them, and give them a scald in it, and a soft boil. Pour them into a basin, and, after picking and beard- ing them one by one, return them into a stewpan, in which there must be in the proportion of half a pint * The inside meat of the small crabs, or cavies, make most deli- cate sauce, inferior only in name to lobster-sauce.—P. 1 •

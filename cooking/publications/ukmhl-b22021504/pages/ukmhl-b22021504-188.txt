CHAP. VI.'—FISH. 180 TO DRESS STURGEON. This fish does not eat well boiled. It may be roasted, or baked, basting with plenty of butter, and serving with a rich gravy relished with anchovy, wine, and juice of lemon ; or with any of the flavoured vinegars. Slices of sturgeon are egged, dipped in bread-crumbs, seasonings, and chopped parsley, and broiled era pa- pillote. Sauce,—oyster or lobster sauce, or melted butter, with a little soy and essence of anchovy. A nonsensical imitation of pickled sturgeon is made of a large turkey, boned and stewed in a rich pickle made of a quart of port wine vinegar, a pint of Rhenish wine, salt and spices. TEASED SKATE. From Dr Hunter s Culina. Take the dried wing of a skate, and after stripping off the skin, cut it into lengths of about one inch in breadth. Put the fish, so prepared, into water, and boil for the space of twenty minutes; after Avhich let it be put into the oven, where it should remain a quar- ter of an hour, during which time it will become so tender as to permit the bones to be drawn out. The flesh being now detached from the bones, it should be put into a cloth, and well rubbed with the hands till it puts on a woolly appearance, which it will soon do. Take a saucepan, and in it reduce about half a pound of butter into oil, when the teased fish should be put into it, and kept stirring for the space of fifteen minutes. When sufficiently heated, serve up. Obs.—Skate, so prepared, may be eaten as salt fish, with egg-sauce, mashed potatoes, or parsnips. The whole wing of a skate will require half a pound of butter when put into the saucepan. It is a good- looking dish, and prepared at a small expense, the whole wing not exceeding five-pence in value. Qlt im- proves this dish to stir potato-pudding in it, or to verve it in a dish with an edging, or casserole of mashed potatoes.]

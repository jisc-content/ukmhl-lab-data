PREFACE. It would be unnecessary to introduce this volume, written on a subject of universal interest and ac- knowledged utility, with any prefatory remarks whatever, were it not conceived, that the novel at- tempt of endeavouring to conciliate the lovers of what is called “ light reading,” and to gain then- attention to that which they may consider a vulgar and unimportant art, might alarm those graver and more prudent persons, who think, perhaps justly, the subject discussed of that earnest nature, which ac- cords ill with any thing fanciful or discursive ; and who may thence conclude the petty details and dis- play of internal machinery in the Work, idle, if not impertinent and out of place. These weighty ob- jections can only be met by the assurance, that the main business of this Manual has, in no respect whatever, suffered from an attempt to separate the culinary art from its fopperies and technicalities; and to render that branch of economy, in which the com- fort and respectability of domestic life is so much involved, more attractive to the young housekeeper.

After inserting the mould, set the pan over the fire, and watch it until boiling begins ; then draw it to the corner of the fire, or reduce the heat so that it may simmer very gently indeed, cover- ing it closely with the lid of the pan. The process of cook- ing will take from three-quarters of an hour to an hour. By that time, nicely set throughout, the mould should be lifted in the pan from the fire and allowed to remain in the water until the extreme heat subsides.

Stir with a wooden spoon until it assumes a pale golden colour, then mix into it the dried almonds, which should he very hot. Bemove the pan when this has been done and

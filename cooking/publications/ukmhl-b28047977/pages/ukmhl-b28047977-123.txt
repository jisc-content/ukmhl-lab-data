OH.A-I^TIErFS VIZI. ——♦ Fancy Pastry. .tt; jjJp'ANCY pastry may be considered as a branch of con- fectionery rather than of ordinary cookery. Never- theless it may be useful to have a few recipes to refer to, for such standard preparations as brioche paste, Genoese and Neopolitan paste, savarin paste, chou paste, &c., which are used in the composition of entremets sucres. Brioche paste:—Make an ordinary paste, as for light dinner rolls, with a quarter of a pound of well-sifted and dried flour, a coffee-cupful of sweet toddy, or a teaspoon- ful of Yeatman’s baking powder, and half a tumbler of warm water; mix it a little less stiffly than for bread, pat it into a lump, cover it, and leave it in a warm place to rise. Now take three-quarters of a pound of the same kind of flour, put it on your marble slab, make a hole in its centre, and add a salt-spoonful of salt, half an ounce of sugar, two table-spoonfuls of water (to dissolve the salt and sugar), ten ounces of butter, and four eggs. Mix these ingiedients to a paste, and add another egg; mix again, adding another egg, and continue the work till seven eggs in all have been used, by which time the paste should be smooth, and neither too soft nor too firm. When the first paste has risen well, mix the two together thoroughly, and put the whole in a basin in a warm place for four hours. Then turn it out upon the slab or board 7a

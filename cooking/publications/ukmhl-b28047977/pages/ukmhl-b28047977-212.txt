SWEET DISHES. 194 Meringues glacees make a presentable dish. They may be diversified in many ways for you can fill them with any nice ice. [See page 38 for directions for the making of Meringues.} As soon as formed to satisfaction, the hollowed meringues should he set in the ice-box. When wanted for service, they should be filled with the cream- ice chosen, taken from the ice-pail, and served complete, i.e., one reversed over the other, and the ice held in the centre.

Ee-place the roll in the oven, and stop the baking when the cake turns a bright yellow, and is spongy and light.

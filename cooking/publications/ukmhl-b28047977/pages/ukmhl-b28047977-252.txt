284 SWEET DISHES. Now, here we have the following proportions :—Six and a half ounces of various spices, to two of ginger. A cake containing a concoction of this kind may be, as another writer observes, “good for assisting digestion,’’ but I demur to its being called “gingerbread.” Let it rather he termed a “ spiced cake.” Treacle is generally considered a necessary ingredient in these cakes. It imparts, of course, a brown tint accord- ing to the quality of the sugar from which it is extracted. As commonly sold at home, it is the “viscid, brown, uncrystallized syrup which drains from brown sugar, during its formation, from the sugar refining moulds.” And in India it is generally made with jaggery which is turned to syrup with water, clarified, and then boiled until the proper consistence is reached. As, however, neither the flavour nor the colour of molasses are by any means essential in a gingerbread cake, I would use ordinary good brown sugar, and make a syrup of it using two pounds of sugar to the pint of water. This clarified and boiled to the consistence of honey will yield the refined kind of treacle sold by good grocers at home under the title of “ golden syrup.” Almond Gingerbread:—Mix an ounce of powdered ginger with a quarter of a pound of rice flour, or ground rice, and three-quarters of a pound of ordinary flour. Put into a jar, one pound of clear treacle, half a pound of sugar, eight ounces of butter, the peel of two limes very finely peeled, and their juice, and a paste made of six ounces of sweet almonds, with eight bitter ones, pounded with rose-water. Keep the jar in hot water, stirring it well until the butter melts, and the mass is thoroughly well mixed. When satisfactorily worked, stir the mixture, by degrees, into the flour. Beat together until quite light, add a heaped-up tea-spoonful of baking powder, and bake

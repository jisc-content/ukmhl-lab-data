221 CAKES, ETC. Rich Plum cake:—One pound of butter, eight large or ten small eggs, one pound of sugar, one pound of flour, half a pound of almonds, eight hitter ones, one pound of currants, one pound of raisins, half a pound of candied peel, and half a pound of citron. If you like spice, you may use it, according to taste, up to half an ounce, but I strongly advise you to try to dispense with it altogether. Commence by whisking the eggs as lightly as possible in a large enamelled bowl, and then, still using the whisk, add the sugar: having amalgamated these well, mingle with them the flour and the almond (which should have been pounded to a paste with rose-water beforehand), and a salt-spoonful of salt. Now, mix in, by degrees, the currants, raisins, citron, and candied peel. I need not say that the two first should be most carefully picked, stoned, and washed; and that the two last should be cut up into moderately small pieces. As each thing is put in, the whole mixture should be vigorously stirred about, so that thorough incorporation may be effected. Lastly, pour in the butter just sufficiently melted to be fluid, and a tea- spoonful of baking powder. The composition is now complete. Have ready the cake-tin lined with buttered paper in the manner already described, pour in the mixture and bake, in a moderate oven, for about three hours. This cake maybe “iced,” of course, with or without almond paste, according to circumstances. A plainer cake can obviously be produced by reducing the ingredients that conduce to so-called richness. Thus I would reduce the butter to half a pound, and the number of eggs to six ; instead of the almond paste I would put in a tea-spoonful of almond or ratafia essence; and one pound of currants and raisins instead of two. For the rest work as laid down in the former recipe. It is, of course, evident that exactly half of everything, or one-third less of every- thing, will produce a smaller, yet equally nice cake.

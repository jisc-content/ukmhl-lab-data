214 S WEE T DISHES. flays; accordingly, it will be found an excellent plan to have a tin cake-box,:—shaped like a band-box with a closely-fitting top,—made for the storing of them. A cake kept in a covered tin-box will retain its freshness better than if exposed to the air. A copper, or enamelled iron sugar boiler, is a utensil of the utmost use in this branch of the cook’s work; the sieve should not be one used for savoury work, and the mortar should be one reserved for the sweet branch only. In all other details the usual paraphernalia of the pastry-maker will come into play :—Baking-sheets, a good oven, a marble slab, and rolling pin, a strong all-wire whisk, a set of fancy cutters, and a set of fancy cake moulds. The three last named will not be wanted for ordinary cakes, but they will be found very useful when petits fours, biscuits, &c., have to be made. Returning now to the list of ingredients, I need hardly assert that a good cake cannot be made without good butter. It is the questionable quality of this ingredient that ruins nineteen cakes in India out of twenty. When the cake is just cut, the error may sometimes escape detection, but the next day it cannot be disguised, and a noisome rancidity sets in,—a rancidity that can almost be smelt. Now as a new cake ought not to be eaten, it stands to reason that we ought to pay the strictest attention to this very important particular. True economy should counsel us to do so. Once tainted with the unmistakable mustiness of bad butter, a cake is wasted, and with it all the good things that have been used in its composition. So I repeat my thread-bare advice,—if you cannot make good butter at home, use the excellent substitute sold in tins. The slight saltish taste will be beneficial rather than otherwise, for a little salt is always mentioned in recipes given for cakes made with fresh butter.

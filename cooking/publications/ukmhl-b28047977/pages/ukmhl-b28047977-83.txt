FBITTEBS. 65 to the boil, then remove the pan, and add, off the fire, half a pound of sifted flour; mix thoroughly, and stir over the fire for four minutes. Again take the pan off the fire, cool for ten minutes, mix into the paste, one by one, three eggs whole, each being thoroughly worked into the paste before another is added; if then too stiff, an extra egg or half-egg should be put in ; the consistence should be such that, when dropped from the spoon, the paste should retain a firm appearance, and not spread out or bulge. Divide it now into pieces the size of a walnut, pat them into shape with two spoons, then drop them one by one into a deep bath of hot fat. The paste will swell out, and hollow balls of a fine golden tint will be produced if the frying be properly conducted. Serve upon a napkin dusted over with sugar. The frying of Beignets souffles is a rather different process from that explained for ordinary fritters which are plunged into very hot fat and finished rapidly. In this case the fat should be sufficiently hot to cause only a slight fizzing when tested with the piece of bread. The pieces of paste should be dropped in two or three at a time, the frying should be gentle with slight acceleration of heat as it continues, and the fat should be stirred throughout the operation. Draining and drying on the wire drainer are obviously necessary. If plunged into very hot fat the balls turn very dark before they swell out sufficiently well to serve. Soupirs de nonne, or Pets de nonne, are made exactly in the same way in regard to all details as Beignets souffles; the only difference is that the balls are smaller, so the pieces of paste should be formed about the size of a boyâ€™s playing marble. Beignets mondainsThese are made of the same paste as Beignets souffles, the difference being that it

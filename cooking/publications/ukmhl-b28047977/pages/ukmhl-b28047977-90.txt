Pannequets legers:—The word “pannequet” is found in new French dictionaries with the English equivalent “pancake,” and some French writers use both “ crdpe,” and “pannequet” for the same thing. In Audot’s book you find the latter term explained as “ Crepe Anglaise,” and I cannot but conclude that “pannequet ” is simply a corruption of the English word “pancake.” Be this as it may, there is absolutely no difference whatever in the cooking, and the batter mixed for one will do for the other. Dubois gives a slightly different mixture for his pannequet leger, which may perhaps be tried for a change now and then. It runs as follows:— Put five ounces of flour into a howl, make a hole in its centre, break four eggs, separating the yolks from the whites, put the yolks one by one into the hollow, and work them with the flour, moisten further with a gill and- a-lialf of warm milk and half a gill of cream, sweeten with half an ounce of sugar and work into the mixture two and-a-half ounces of melted butter. When the batter is creamy, put the bowl away covered with a cloth for two hours. Then finish it with the four whites whipped to a froth, and cook the pancakes in the manner des- cribed for Crepes sautees. Pannequets a la Celestine :—Choose one of the batters already given, and make with it six little pancakes : as each one is made, roll up within it a dessert-spoonful of apricot jam : arrange the six little rolls on a very hot silver dish, dust them over with finely-powdered sugar, glaze them by passing a red-hot iron closely over the top of them, pour some brandy round them, set it on fire, and serve.

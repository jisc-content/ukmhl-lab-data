200 SWEET DISHES. Here is a list of fruits which either in jelly, or in jam, are well worth preserving:—The Bangalore strawberry, the Bangalore raspberry, Cape gooseberry* (a wild plant on the Hills, hut capable of being cultivated in every garden during the cold season), the guava, mango, peach, orange, melon, pine-apple, roselle, pear, and apple. Fruits with seeds, like raspberries, guavas, &c., are of course better in jelly than in jam. In the form of ‘ cheese ’ many fruits are nice. The process is simple. Whereas jelly may be described as the preserved juice of fruit, cheese may he termed its puree,—that is to say, the pulp and juice of the fruit deprived of skin, stones, &c. Clear cheese is, however, jelly reduced by gentle simmering to a more solid consistence. The nicest form of strawberry preserve is, of course, that in which the fruit is kept whole, and the syrup, in which it is suspended, as clear as possible. Strawberries preserved whole:—For this you will require two qualities of fruit : some perfect berries specially selected for the preserve; and some less good looking ones, very ripe, or those that have had bruised parts cut out of them, for the syrup. Commence by placing the selected berries in sugar: they should be very clean and very dry: in order to secure those essentials it is necessary first to bathe, and then to dry them, an operation demanding the utmost attention. Spread them on a large dish, without crowding, and dust over them double their weight of loaf-sugar well pounded and sifted. Now, having cleaned the berries intended for the syrup, and got rid of all earthy grit, turn them in as dry a state as you can into a China bowl : then, with a large silver fork, patiently bruise them, mixing with them their * Physalis Peruviana known as tiparee in Northern India where it is cultivated and much improved both in size and flavour.

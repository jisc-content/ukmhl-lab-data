156 SWEET DISHES Roly-poly puddingMix half a pound of finely- minced suet with one pound of flour, add a pinch of salt, a well-beaten egg, and about half a pint of milk to moisten. Roll out the paste quite thin,—a quarter of an inch thick, say, at the outside,—and of a width regulated by the size of the vessel in which you propose to boil the pudding. Spread a layer of jam evenly over the surface of the paste, leaving a margin all round for the joining of the side and ends of the roll. When ready, roll the paste up in the well-known manner, securing the edges firmly. Dip a cloth in boiling water, flour it well, tie the pudding up tightly within it, and put it into a saucepan of boiling water with a plate at the bottom of it to protect the pudding from catching or burning. A roly-poly pudding will require boiling for an hour and a half or two hours according to size. Jam, we all know, is the ordinary garniture, still a very superior roly-poly can be produced with prunes. Take half a pound of prunes, put them into a stewpan with a table-spoonful of sugar, a quai'ter of a pint of water, a glass of port or claret, and the juice of a lime. Stew very gently. When nice and soft, turn the fruit out upon a sieve and pick out the srones, mix the fruit with the syrup that has drained from it, and use it instead of jam. If you stew them like the prunes till soft to begin with, finely minced figs and dates make excellent puddings of this class. You can also fill a roly-poly with treacle, any cheese-cake mixture, lime, almond, cocoanut, citron, &c. Mince-meat, as used for mince-pies, may be advantageously used in this manner and a puree of ripe plantains, assisted by a few spoonfuls of strawberry or raspberry jam, will be found by no means unpleasant. The proper sauce for roly-poly pudding is a good custard flavoured as may be desired with essence or zest Wine and liqueur-flavoured sauces are quite out of place with puddings of this kind.

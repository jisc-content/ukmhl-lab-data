7 JELLIES. I do not think that there is much required in the way of instruction in jelly-making, though I shall presently des- cribe the process for the benefit of the uninitiated. What is wanted, I fancy, is variety,—to be shown how we can surprise our guests with something slightly more novel than the everlasting clear jelly flavoured with wine or liqueur. Now, by exercising a little thought, and a little good taste, this end can be attained without much difficulty, Taking clear jellies first; we can, of course, embellish an ordinary maraschino jelly with quarters of preserved apricots or peaches, a champagne jelly with strawberries, a noyeau jelly with greengages, &c., &c. Or we may take a few specimens of each kind of fruit, and set them in layers. But by far the pleasantest jellies are those made with fruit juices or syrups, garnished appropriately, and fla- voured, perhaps, with a liqueur which harmonizes with them. Of these there are several to choose from, as will be seen later on. The old-fashioned composition as clear as crystal and but for a sickly indication of sherry nearly as tasteless, very firm, very pink or yellow, and very orna- mental in the moulding has quite passed out of fashion. Jellies depend now-a-days almost entirely upon gelatine for their solidity, isinglass having been completely effaced by that preparation. This effect can also be produced, we know, by slowly simmering calves’ feet, ox heels, or sheep’s trotters, and then straining the liquid as will be explained later on : hut the improved gelatine, now pro- curable everywhere, has rendered that very tedious process unnecessary. The use of the calf’s foot in jelly-making was considered a great desideratum formerly when this species of food was universally recommended for invalids on account of its supposed highly nutritive qualities. Modern science has, however, negatived the idea that

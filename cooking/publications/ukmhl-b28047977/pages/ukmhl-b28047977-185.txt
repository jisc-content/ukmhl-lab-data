CHAPTER XII. +- On Ice-making, fHE process of making a good ice, or iced-pudding, is by no means elaborate, or difficult. If given the proper appliances, the cook has only to take ordinary pains, and follow a few hard-and-fast rules to be successful. The common apparatus for this work is, of course, the sorbetiere, or a deep wooden tub with a hole in the side at the bottom of it for the escape of water, and a long pew- ter pot with a tightly-fitting cover, furnished with a strong rectangular handle, and turning on a pivot fixed in the centre of the bottom of the tub. The tub is made sufficiently wide to yield a clear margin of five inches round the freezing-pot, -when the latter is fixed in the pivot in its centre : and the pin, fitted at the bottom of the freezer, is made sufficiently long to admit of a small bed of ice being laid between the bottom of the tub and the bottom of the pot. Accompanying the pail and pot, there is always a spatula,â€”pewter, with a wooden handle, or entirely of wood. This, the original and still very reliable ice-maker, has latterly been improved upon by the introduction of spherical sorbetUres fitted with a fan, something like the screw of a steamship, which is made to revolve in a vertical position by means of a cog- wheel and horizontal spindle worked by a handle at the

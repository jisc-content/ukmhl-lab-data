CAKES, ETC. 225 which it is to play a part, and remember that cakes of this class improve with keeping. Take the currants, raisins, candied peels and citron, and prepare each of them care- fully. Select the almonds, and see that they are pounded with rose-water. Examine the flour critically, atid see that it is dry and well-sifted. Reject every egg that seems doubtful. As a little extravagance is pardonable, set the milk for the butter at home, and be in that way sure of the quality of that important ingredient. The proportions of the various ingredients may be thus allotted :â€”Pour pounds of currants ; half a pound each of citron, candied orange, and candied lemon peel ; four pounds of the best dessert raisins, picked, and cut into pieces ; a pound of sweet almonds and twelve bitter ones pounded to a paste with rose-water, and a sherry-glass of maraschino (the weight of the almonds should be taken after they have been shelled and blanched), four pounds of butter, four pounds of flour, six good sized Indian eggs to each pound of flour, two pounds of the best loaf-sugar pounded, the zest of two oranges and four limes, a table- spoonful of lemon essence and one of vanilla essence; half a pint of brandy, and half a pint of Madeira. Work in this manner Having prepared the fruit, candied peels, almonds, etc., as before described, break the eggs into an enamelled bowl, and whisk them steadily until they are light and frothy; then add, by degrees, the sugar and zests still whisking continuously till well-blend- ed. To effect this properly, pounded loaf-sugar is essen- tially necessary; crystallised sugar would not dissolve at all. Next put in the flour also by degrees, and continue the whisking as you add it The fruit, almond paste, and peels must then be introduced, sprinkling them into the composition, so that the distribution may be equally effected. Lastly add the liquids, and the butter liquefied. 15

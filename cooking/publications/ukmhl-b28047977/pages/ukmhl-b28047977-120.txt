SWEET DISHES. 102 natives into “bimli ”), the papaw or papoy, when not quite ripe, the cape gooseberry sometimes called the Brazil cherry (cultivated in Central Indian gardens, as Tiparee, and vastly improved with a little attention), the Bangalore raspberry (a species of blackberry), &c., &c. A coffee-cupful of water should be poured into the pie-dish with fresh fruit, and, in the manner just described for apricot tart, the fruit should always he arranged in dome shape well above the level of the rim of the dish in order that the paste may he supported in that shape, and not lie hat. It is the practice of some cooks to prepare the fruit and paste of their tarts separately, and undoubtedly a good appearance is got by following that plan which may be thus described. The empty pie-dish is filled closely with rolls of crumpled kitchen paper piled up dome-wise as I have explained for fruit. The paste supported by the paper is laid over it in the usual way and baked. When nicely cooked the dummy tart is taken out the oven, and set to get cold, when it is brushed over with white of egg, frosted with sugar, and dried in the oven. Then a sharp knife is passed round the rim of the dish and the whole pastry cover detached. The paper having been removed, and the dish cleaned carefully, the separately cooked fruit with its syrup is put into it; the rim is then coated with white of egg and powdered sugar cement, and the pastry cover laid over it. The cover having retained the dome shape, looks very smooth, and is firm and crisp. It often happens that the best puff-pastry is spoilt by the steam which rises from the fruit during the baking which renders it soft and flabby ; careful ventilation will counte- ract this to a certain extent, but the ‘ dummy’ method is safer. This process can obviously be followed with tinned and bottled fruit easily enough.

SWEET DISHES. 16 sieve or a piece of muslin. Now put it into a saucepan, which plunge into a larger one containing boiling water, and thicken the mixture over the fire as you would a custard by simply stirring well till the desired consistency is attained. Let it get cool, then decorate a mould with blanched almonds, place it in ice, pour in the jelly, and let it set as in the previous receipts. This dish is sometimes called Jaune-manger on account of the yellow tinge it acquires from the yolks of eggs. It is, of course, opaque. Semolina flummery (Flamri do scmoulc)Put one pint of milk in the stewpan over the fire, stir in little by little enough semolina to bring the milk to the consist- ency of thick cream, add five ounces of sifted sugar also by degrees, stirring well, and such flavouring essence as may be liked. Continue to work the mixture for a few minutes, then take it off the fire and whisk into it the whites of four eggs. Replace the pan over the fire, and, using the whisk still, stir until the first symptoms of boiling show themselves. Immediately remove the pan now, cool its contents, and pour them into moulds that have been dipped into cold water, set them on ice, and in due course turn out the flamris. Serve with a fruit syrup or pur&e poured over the moulds. These flummeries are admirably suited for invalid diet. Blanc-manger is naturally suggested by the above, and a very useful sweet it is too. There are expensive methods of composing this dish as well as plain. I will consequently submit one of each kind. This is Gouff^’s Almond blanc-manger:—Blanch and peel six ounces of shelled sweet almonds, and a quarter ounce of bitter ones ; pound them in a mortar to a paste with rosewater and add a pint of water; mix the paste and water well till it becomes milky, let it stand for an hour

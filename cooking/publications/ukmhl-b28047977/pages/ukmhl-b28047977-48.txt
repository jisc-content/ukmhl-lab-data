30 SWEET DISHES. process of cream-making is concerned, and the following as to proportions :— Chocolate cream.—Make half a pint of chocolate cus- tard as already described, taking half the quantities there given. Work this in a custard saucepan quite smoothly, then add three-quarters of an ounce of gelatine, dissolve well, and pass all through a clean hair sieve into a bowl; when cold, whip into it two gills of stiffly whipped cream, and a teaspoonful of essence of vanilla if not already added to the custard. Put this into a mould, set in ice, and turn out when wanted. Pistachio cream.—Blanch, peel, and pound four ounces of pistachio nuts : make a pint and a half of vanilla cus- tard as already given, and add to it over the fire an ounce and a half of dissolved gelatine. Strain this when smooth into a bowl, add the pounded nuts, and a liqueur glass of Benedictine or other liqueur, with half a pint of whipped cream, set as usual, and turn out when required. Follow these proportions for almond or cashunut cream. Creme de groseilles vertes.—For this make a good gooseberry fool, adding for a pint of it an ounce of gelatine dissolved in a little milk, strain through a clean hair sieve, add a gill of whipped cream when cold, set in a mould, and finish as usual. This can easily be made with tart goose- berries or mangoes. Italian cream.—Mix together a glass of sherry, the juice and zest of three limes, and a quarter of a pound of sugar ; dissolve an ounce of gelatine in half a pint of rasp- berry syrup, add the wine and sugar, mix well, and strain into a bowl over ice; when cold whip into it half pint of cream, then pour the mixture into a mould, set it in ice, and turn it out when wanted.

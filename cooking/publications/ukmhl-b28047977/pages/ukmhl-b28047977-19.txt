CHA.PTBR X. Equipments and Materials, N the treatment of entremets sucres the strictest atten- ^ tion must be paid to cleanliness. Every vessel used must be scrupulously inspected, and even the room in which the work is carried out should be sweet and airy. When we remember how easily cream, fruits, and the other delicate articles used in this branch of kitchen work become tainted, and lose their fresh bouquet, common- sense should surely warn us to be careful. I confess that I cannot bring myself to beheve that it is possible to compose a really dainty cream or jelly in a kitchen reek- ing with savoury vapours, or with, what is 'infinitely worse, the smoke from wood-fires. Fortunately for us all, the cookery of sweet things can, in a great measure, be carried out in the house, away from the cook-room, and under the eye of the mistress. The mixing, for instance, of puddings, and the preparation of jellies, creams, cakes, and ices, might even be superin- tended in the dining-room. For operations that neces- sitate slight boiling, a small charcoal fire in an adjacent verandah will generally he found sufficient. When satis- factorily mixed, and made ready for baking or boiling, cakes, puddings, and the like can, of course, be sent to the kitchen : but the important stage should, if possible, be supervised in the house.

18G SWEET DISHES, souffle tiii that has been made very cold with crushed ice, put the mixture into it in layers with the ratafia powder shaken over each layer until the tin is filled, finishing the top with powder. Meanwhile, having chosen a roomy stewpan with a closely-fitting cover, arrange at the bottom of it a freezing mixture of ice, salt, and saltpetre; let this be at least four or five inches deep, well pressed down, place the souffle tin in the centre of this bed and pack round it enough freezing mixture to come within two inches of the top ; cover the souffle tin with paper, and cover the pan, closing the rim of the lid with a band of paste, and leave the souffle for a couple of hours, then examine as to the necessity of pouring off melted ice, and, replenishing the freezing mixture, act as may be necessary, close again tightly, leave for a further period of two hours, and finally serve the souffle, in its tin placed within a folded serviette or an ornamental paper case. Half a pint of puree and a table-spoonful of icing-sugar will suffice. Some very finely minced pine-apple may be whipped with the cream and embodied in the souffle. Iced souffles are set by professional confiseurs in refri- gerators called “ caves” but an excellent make-shift can be resorted to by utilizing a large stewpan in the manner I have described, provided that the lid can be pasted down to exclude all air. Various flavours can obviously be communicated to iced souffles; the powdered ratafia crumbs give a slight gra- nulation as is found in ordinary souffles; care must he taken in having a stiff apparcil d mousse or the setting of the souffle may he very difficult. Liqueurs are used in iced souffles as in other ices, and should be put into the syrup which, with the eggs, forms the custard.

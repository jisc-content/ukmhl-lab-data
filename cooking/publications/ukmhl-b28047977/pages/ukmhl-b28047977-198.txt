SWEET DISHES. 180 A Plombiere may be described as an association of cream ice with fruit, not moulded, but dished effectively in layers of spoonfuls straight from the freezer,- with fruit mingled with them. The compote cl la Prince de Galles, (page 52) may be cited as an example of a plombiere. ,\ \ Plombiere a l’abricot:—Having made a good apricot cream ice, keep it in the freezing-pot. Prepare a dozen half apricots with apricot glaze, as explained for peaches, (page 44), omitting the croutes ; let them get cold and firm. At the moment of serving, have ready a china or silver dish, made very cold by crushed ice : wipe it, and lay over the bottom of it a ring of spoonfuls of the ice, arrange a few half apricots in the centre, cover this with another layer of spoonfuls of ice, slipping in pieces of apricot, and building up a pyramid as quickly as possible. Serve at once. A liqueur-glass of rum should be mixed into this nearly frozen ice after adding the whipped cream. Plombiere d’Alencon is made with almond cream ice and minced crystallized fruit sprinkled with kirsch, a little of the same liqueur being worked into the ice towards the end of the freezing. The special feature of the dish is that it is arranged within a border of yenois paste, which, after baking, is set to get quite cold, and then glazed with apricot glaze ; the ice is laid within the border in spoon- fuls, and raised, layer by layer, in conical shape, the “ tipsified ” fruit being scattered amongst the layers. Taking Plombiere a Vabricot as a guide, it is clear that variety can easily be obtained by changing the flavouring of the ice, altering the liqueur, and substituting different fruit for the apricot.

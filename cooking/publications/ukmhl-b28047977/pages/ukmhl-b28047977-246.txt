SWEET DISHES. ‘228 ounce of finely minced citron, a salt-spoonful of salt, and a tea-spoonful of baking powder. Beat the eggs and sugar together, and, when light, mix in, by degrees, the flour the rose-water, brandy, and citron ; beat the mixture until it is very light and creamy, adding the butter melted, and baking powder the last thing of all: when thoroughly mixed, pour the mixture into half a dozen small square tins lined with well-buttered paper and bake them in a moderate oven for about fifteen minutes; or put it into a shallow tin, three-quarters of an inch deep and bake the slab as described for Genoise cake, page 110. When done the cakes, or the slab, as the case may be, should be covered with a layer of chocolate icing; set the icing, and if it be a slab then cut the cake into nice shapes, pile them on a dish, and serve at afternoon entertainments, or at dessert. Lisbon cakes:—Equal weights (say, half a pound each) of flour, sugar, and butter; six eggs, a glass of Madeira, four ounces of almonds pounded with a table- spoonful of rose-water, an ounce of minced candied peel, a tea-spoonful of essence of vanilla, a salt-spoonful of salt, and a tea-spoonful of baking powder. Mix in the manner just explained. Line half a dozen little tins with well-buttered paper, pour in the cake-mixture, and bake in a moderate oven from twenty minutes to half an hour. These little cakes should be masked with almond paste and plain icing, and treated as laid down for Canadian cakes.

SWEET DISHES. 160 Batter Puddings. We have already discussed the making of batter in con- nection with fritters and pancakes. The preparations there detailed will do equally well for puddings, hut per- haps a plain recipe will be acceptable Put four table- spoonfuls of dried well-sifted flour into a basin, make a hollow in the middle of it into which break, one by one, three yolks, saving the whites, mix well with the flour, adding a pinch of salt, then work in, by degrees, an ounce of melted butter and enough lukewarm water or milk to produce a smooth honey-like batter. When quite evenly mixed, put the bowl aside to rest, covered with a cloth or plate for two hours. Lastly, just before using, add the whites whipped to a stiff froth. With this either baked or boiled puddings can be made. For the former, butter a pie-dish, pour in the hatter, and hake in a moderately quick oven (quick enough, that is to say, to cause it to rise nicely, but not fierce enough to burn it) for forty-five minutes. For boiled batter pudding, put the batter into a but- tered basin, tie this up in a well-floured cloth, plunge into fast boiling water, and boil for an hour and a quarter. In each case flavouring, as may be desired, should be communicated to the batter : sugar should be dredged over these puddings after they have been cooked ; if put into the batter, it makes them heavy. It is quite essen- tial that the batter should be most carefully mixed in the manner described; if not perfectly smooth and creamy, it will not be light. An old-fashioned, yet excellent, pudding composed of fruit and batter is made in this way Butter liberally the inside of a pint-and-a-half basin, fill it nearly full with sliced apples, pears, mangoes, or pine-apple, pour in gently batter enough to fill.-the basin, then tie it up in

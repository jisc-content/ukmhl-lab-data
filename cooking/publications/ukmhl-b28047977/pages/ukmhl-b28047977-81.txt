63 FRITTERS. yolks, the spoonful of cream, the wine, cinnamon, and flavouring. Beat the mixture well for at least a quarter of an hour; and then add the whites of the eggs stiffly whipped. Prepare bath of boiling fat and pour spoonful after spoonful of the batter into it: as each fritter turns a golden yellow, lift it out of the fat, drain it, and serve the pile as usual on a napkin. Arrowroot fritters :—For these you want four ounces of arrowroot, a pint of milk, the yolks of four eggs, and a heaped-up table-spoonful of sifted sugar. Put the milk on to boil, sweeten it with the sugar, and flavour it with any essence or zest that may be liked. When it boils, stir into it the arrowroot which should have been smoothly mixed in a little cold water separately. Draw from the Are when the mixture has thickened nicely, and continue to work it well as you add one by one the four yolks. When it seems thoroughly mixed and smooth, pour it into a well-buttered baking tin, and bake for about ten minutes. Then take it out, cool it; when cold, turn the slab of cake out, stamp such shapes out of it as you may like, and finish as in the previous receipt. Merveilles frites:—Put into a bowl ten ounces of flour well dried and sifted, make a hollow in its centre ; into this break five eggs, adding four ounces of butter melted, one and-a-half ounces of sifted sugar, a pinch of salt, zest or essence to flavour, and four table-spoonfuls of brandy. Mix thoroughly, cover the bowl and leave it alone for an hour. When to be used, turn the paste out upon a floured slab, roll it out thin, and cut into ribbons an inch wide and three long ; drop these into a kettle of very hot fat as in the case of fritters, and when crisp and of a rich golden colour, drain, dry, and serve, well powdered with sugar. Note.—Half these quantities will yield a nice dish of merveilles, as will he seen in the next recipe which is very like it.

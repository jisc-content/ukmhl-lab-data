CHAPTER JXLVI. -♦ Biscuits and Dessert, Although we can now get excellent biscuits itn- ~ ^ ported from the best English makers at moderate cost, it is, I think, as well that my readers should have a few recipes to fall back upon in case of necessity. A Plain Wine biscuit not sweetened :—Into half a pound of the best well-sifted flour rub one and a half ounce of butter. Carry this out by degrees, that is to say do not put all the butter into the flour at once, mix it in bit by bit; then make a stiff paste of the flour and butter by stirring into them a quarter of a pint of lukewarm milk. Roll this out thin,—very thin,- cut it into rounds with a two inch cutter or the rim of a claret-glass; prick each biscuit with the points of a steel fork, then lay them out upon a lightly floured baking-tin, and bake in a very moderate oven. The pricked side should be turned down- wards. A pinch of salt may be rubbed in with the butter. Some people mix their paste for this biscuit in a different manner as follows Having dried and sifted the flour, they put it into an enamelled pan, then they dissolve the butter in the milk over the fire, and proceed to make the paste while the buttery milk is still warm. Keep these biscuits in a close-fitting tin.

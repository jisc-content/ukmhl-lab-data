PANCAKES, SOUFFLES, AND OMELETTES. 79 rest of the milk with an ounce of pounded loaf sugar and half an ounce of butter. When the mixture boils take the pan from the fire. Let it get cold, then mix into the batter a liqueur-glass of brandy, and the yolks of three eggs : work the batter thoroughly, lastly, adding the stiffly beaten whites of the eggs. Chocolate souffle.—An ounce of grated chocolate should be mixed into a batter made of two ounces of fine Hour moistened with half a pint of milk, &c., as in the foregoing receipt. If chocolat Meniar is used, less sugar may be liked. Almond souffle is a speciality, for it requires no flour, the thickness being provided by the puree, of the nut. Take a quarter of a pound of sweet almonds, and five bitter ones, and after blanching them, pound them in a wedgewood mortar to a paste, using a little orange flower water to assist the operation ; and two ounces of sugar, and when reduced to a perfectly smooth cream, as it were, incorporate with it half an ounce of fresh butter, then the yolks of three or four eggs, lastly blend the mixture with the stiffly whipped whites of five or six eggs : pour into your souffle, tin and bake immediately.

Rice souffle.—Boil a handful of rice in a pint of milk with a stick of cinnamon, and a few drops of any flavour- ino> lemon, or ratafia,—until the rice has absorbed all the milk: put it aside to get cold/and work into it the yolks of six eggs, finishing off' with the whites of eight e^s whipped to a stiff froth. Maccaroni souffle.—Proceed as with the rice souffle, cutting up the maccaroni into small pieces after it has been boiled. Vermicelli makes an equally nice dish.

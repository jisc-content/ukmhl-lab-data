157 PUDDINGS. Suet pudding:â€”Put six ounces of stale crumbs into a basin, and stir in with them two ounces of flour, and eight ounces of very finely chopped suet. Add to this a pinch of salt, two ounces of sugar, and the juice and zest of a lime. Stir together thoroughly, breaking into it one by one two whole eggs, and a very little milk to moisten. Put the mixture into a buttered basin, cover with a floured cloth, and boil fast for two and a half hours. Or the pudding may be shaped like a roly-poly pudding and boiled in a floured cloth in the same way. If required for service with meat, or as a savoury pudding, omit the sugar and lime, substituting a good seasoning of black pepper and salt. Sweet suet puddings can be served with golden syrup poured over them, with lemon syrup, or any fruit syrup that may be liked. Their composition can also be diversi- fied by the introduction of currants, raisins, chopped figs, dates, or prunes prepared as for roly-poly pudding. For nursery use, these puddings, if sufficiently well boiled, are most wholesome and nutritious. The idea that suet is too rich for children is absurd. In India, where it is difficult to provide them with the necessary amount of fat that then systems require, the suet pudding affords a ready disguise, which ought to be frequently taken advantage of. Obs. A light suet pudding is obtained without the use of flour, the proportions being six ounces of fine crumbs to four of suet, with one table-spoonful of sirgar, flavouring as may be liked, and a well- beaten egg. Golden pudding may be described as a suet pudding, to which a certain amount of marmalade or golden syrup has been added. For the proportions just given four table-spoonfuls of marmalade or golden syrup will be found sufficient. Mix this into the crumbs, &c , and omit the sugar. Boil for three hours.

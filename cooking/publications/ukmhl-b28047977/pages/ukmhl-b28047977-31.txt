JELLIES. 13 not quite as bright as the one in which the gelatine is first clarified independently. Whipped, or iced cream is gen- erally handed round with Bordeaux jelly, or, if served in a boiâ€™der mould, in the centre of it. Orange jelly is an inexpensive jelly that can be easily made when that fruit is in season. Make a syrup with one pint of water, and quarter of a pound of white sugar, adding to it the finely shred rind of four oranges, and of two limes. Skim it carefully, adding the juice of eight oranges and one lime, let it simmer gently for twenty minutes, and then strain it. Clarify an ounce of gelatine with a pint of water, the whipped whites of a couple of eggs, and a quarter of a pound of sugar. Strain it care- fully, and, when clear, mix it with the syrup. Pass the liquid through flannel till quite transparent. Now skin and peel a couple of oranges, divide them into quarters, removing all pithy skin, and gently squeeze out the pips. If available, each piece may be dipped with advantage in brandy or any nice liqueur, but that is not essential. Place the mould on ice, and set about the eighth of an inch of the jelly first; then dispose upon it a layer of neatly arranged orange quarters, cover them with jelly, and repeat the process in a second layer, finally filling the mould completely. Lemon jelly, or rather Lime jelly, is even a simpler sweet than the foregoing. Clarify an ounce of gelatine exactly in the same way as described for orange jelly, and, when strained and clear, mix it with a lime syrup made of the juice of four or five limes, a pint of water, and a quarter of a pound of sifted sugar. Pass all through flannel till clear. Garnish it with fruit if you wish, set it in a mould on ice, and serve. Or, more easily in one process as follows Take half an ounce of gelatine, half a pint of water, two ounces of sugar, the whites of two eggs, and the juice of four limes.

SWEET DISHES. 232 until it looks like a firm batter and stir in the whites of the eggs whipped to stiff froth; then pat the buns into shape, marking each one with a cross, and set them upon a well-buttered baking tin. Glaze in the manner just described. The Sally lunn is a good old-fashioned breakfast cake. Rub four ounces of butter into a pound of flour, add a tea-spoonful of salt and two of Yeatman’s powder heaped up; make the mixture into a light dough with half a pint of lukewarm milk, in which four yolks of eggs have been beaten, make the dough into thick muffin-like cakes, and bake ; or put it into muffin rings upon a well-buttered baking tin, and set them in the oven. If liked sweet, two ounces of sugar should be added. Tea cake:—Beat two eggs in a slop-basin. Warm a gill of milk and melt in it two ounces of butter. Mix the buttery milk and eggs together, and, by degrees, stir in a little less than three-quarters of a pound of flour, a pinch of salt, and an ounce of sugar. Beat altogether to a very light dough, stirring into it last of all a heaped-up dessert- spoonful of Yeatman’s baking powder. When quite thoroughly mixed, put the dough within rings upon a well-buttered baking-sheet, and bake for a quarter of au hour, or twenty minutes. The rings should be made of block tin, four and a half inches in diameter, and an inch deep. Omitting the sugar, this makes a delicious break- fast cake. Serve in a napkin straight from the oven. ♦—— Gingerbread. Gingerbread cake is a useful cake for luncheon, and it may be that few require instruction regarding it. There are, however, so many varieties of gingerbread, that it is just possible I may present a recipe or two not commonly known.

SWEET DISHES. 56 speak of the commoner substitute. Unfortunately there is a prejudice against ghee, justifiably created no doubt, for if not very good it is decidedly nasty stuff. But properly made and fresh, it is nothing more nor less than the bcurrc ipure of French cuisine, much used as a frying medium by cbefs and by no means to be despised. Ghee is, as a rule, insufficiently clarified by the Native; it is consequently advisable to carry out that process before using itput it into a clean vessel over the fire, bring it to the boil, boil for two minutes, remove the vessel, let the ghee settle, skim it, and strain gently through a fine sieve, omitting the dregs. Warm it again till it is as clear as oil. It should be noted that the leaves of the Moringa or horse-radish tree (Hyperanthera) possess the property of removing any taint there may be in ghee, or rancidity. A few should be boiled up with the ghee to effect this object. The quantity of the medium will depend upon the size and description of vessel you employ, and once for all let it be understood that the utensil called a “ frying-pan ” in English hardware lists is of no use for this species of frying. You do not want a wide and shallow vessel at all: you require a deep one of moderate width called a “frying-kettle,” the object being to obtain a bath of fat sufficient to cover the things to be fried without an un- necessary expenditure of the medium used. An eight- inch kettle for a seven-inch frying basket, for instance, would do very well for a moderate establishment. The frying basket is a most useful item of the equipment which can scarcely be dispensed with, although a per- forated ladle will often do for small things. A shallow pan with a meagre supply of fat will at best produce a flabby mahogany coloured thing by no stretch of the imagination recognisable as a bcignet.

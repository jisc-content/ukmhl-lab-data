96 SWEET DISHES. Mince pies :—Numerous recipes are to be found for the ‘ mince neat ’ of which these pies are made, perhaps the oldest form of sweet that has been handed down to us from very ancient days. Originally much meat was mix- ed with the sweet stuff, and receipts are still to be found in which minced beef appears. This is no longer used, and even butter is substituted for suet by some cooks. I give a good old recipe which I have always used and can safely recommend. Mince-meat:—One pound and a half of finely minced beef-suet, one pound and a half of best raisins, the same weight of currants, and the same of chopped-apples. Mix these four ingredients in a basin, adding one pound of sugar, and a half pound of mixed candied peel and citron, all finely minced : a sherry-glass of lime-juice, and the zest of three limes may now be sprinkled over the mince- meat, which should be well stirred about with a silver spoon. Next, put half a tea-spoonful of salt into a tumbler of brandy, and tea-spoonful of powdered mixed spice, stir it well together, and then pour it into the bowl. The mince-meat should now be emptied into a lai'ge jar, and be covered up for eight or ten days before it is used. It will keep for several weeks, but it should be occasionally looked at, and a glass of brandy stirred in to improve it. A little preserved ginger may be chopped up and added with the citron, &c., it is nicer, than the powdered dry ginger that some use. If your cook can make nice puff-pastry, following the rules I have already recorded, the mere pie-making will be an easy matter. Choose round patty-pans not more than three inches in diameter,—for I maintain that a mince-pie of larger size ought not to be encouraged,— butter them well and line them with the lightest puft- paste you can get, rolled out a little less than a cjuaitei of an inch thick.

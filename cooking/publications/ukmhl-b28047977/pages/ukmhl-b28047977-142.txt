124 SWEET DISHES. if necessary: cover the exposed end of the mould with buttered paper cut to fit it, and after that steam the pud- ding gently, in the manner just carefully described, for about three quarters of an hour : turn it out upon a dish after giving it five minutes to settle. In packing moulds for steamed puddings with cake, the best plan is to cut the cake into oblongs or fingers, about the length of the mould and a third of an inch thick, and arrange them crosswise (“headers and stretchers” as bricklayers say), leaving little spaces for the custard to filter through. Cabinet sauce:—Put eight yolks of egg in a stew- pan, with half a pint of plain syrup ; stir over a low fire, until the mixture coats the spoon, add a wine-glass of kirsch or cherry brandy, strain the sauce through a fine sieve, and serve it in a boat with the pudding. Obs.:—These old fashioned, eggy and thickened sauces have been, to a great extent, superseded by plain fruit syrups, or syrups flavoured with rum, liqueurs, or zests. It should be noted that a cold cabinet pudding with a liqueur flavoured syrup is as nice if not nicer than a hot one ; but it should be served as cold as possible. In some recipes for Cabinet puddings, you will find ratafias recommended as well as sponge-cake, and the flavouring of vanilla, instead of that of kirsch, and curacoa. Cream is given instead of milk for the custard sometimes, with crdme clc vanilla liqueur, and essence of vanilla to flavour it. Be the variation what it may, however, the principles of the pudding remain the same, viz. :—layers of dry cake or biscuit, with minced preserved fruits between them, filling a mould three parts full; then a rich custard, delicately flavoured, moistening by degrees the packed mould, thoroughly filling all interstices, and the part of the mould not occupied by cake ; lastly, the whole consolidated by gentle poaching, and served with a rich wine, or liqueur-flavoured sauce.

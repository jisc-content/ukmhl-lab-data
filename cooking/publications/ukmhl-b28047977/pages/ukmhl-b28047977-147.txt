PUDDINGS. V29 Sultana pudding (Ponding aux raisins sees) (steam- ed) :—Butter a quart mould, arrange therein, in a neat pattern, a number of Sultana raisins that have been carefully picked, washed and dried. Next begin to pack the mould with layers of sponge or stale Madeira cake, cut in slices to fit it, sprinkling over each layer a few spoonfuls of Sultanas, cut into small dice; when nicely packed, pour gently into the mould a rich cold custard made of the yolks of six eggs per pint of milk, and flavoured with vanilla lemon, or ratafia essence. Let the cake absorb the custard, and then add sufficient to nearly fill the mould. The exposed end of the pudding should then be covered with buttered paper, and the mould steamed for about an hour according to process III. An ornament cut out of citron may, if liked, be placed at the bottom of the mould to start with. A good deal depends upon the richness of the custard, a coffee-cupful of cream may, therefore, be added to it without hesitation ; and the composition will be improved if you toss the minced raisins in rum, or any nice liqueur, over the fire, until the dice have absorbed the spirit before using them. Madeira sauce may be served effectively with Sultana pudding :—Make two gills of clear syrup with white sugar and water, stir into it one gill of Madeira, add the juice of a lime, boil the mixture up and serve piping hot. N.B.—Steamed Sultana pudding for the nursery may be made with slices of bread instead of spongecake, and a plain custard made of three eggs to the pint of milk, instead of the minced raisins a little jam or marmalade may be spread over each slice of bread. Amber pudding (Ponding ambre) (boiled):—Shred finely half a pound of dry suet, and dredge some flour over it to prevent the minced atoms adhering to one another. Mix it with eight ounces of bread or cake crumbs, a table- spoonful of sugar, five eggs well beaten, the juice of a lime, and half a tin of apricot or orange marmalade. The 9

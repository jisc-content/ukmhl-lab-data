SWEET DISHES, 3& eggs called meringue is an old yet useful thing in sweet cookery. It now becomes necessary to introduce to notice the modern forcing bag with pipe, a handy article of the confectioner’s equipment which will be found of great- assistance to the ordinary practitioner, enabling him to produce neater shapes and patterns than were formerly possible with spoons, paper funnels, &c. It may be de- scribed as a bag made of linen open at one end and drawn to a narrow neck at the other, where a metal nozzle is fixed, into which pipes of various sizes can be screwed. The open end is made to close by drawing a string like a sponge bag. Thus, having filled the bag and drawn the string, the cook presses the neck of the bag forcing the cream or whatever is being used through the pipe. The occasions when this process is desirable will be indicated in due course. The making of meringues is one of them. First, however, it will be better to deal with the older method, for forcing bags may not be easily obtained by everybody. Put the whites of seven eggs into a bowl, and whip them as stiffly as possible ; add little by little half a pound of powdered sugar, mix well, and. with a table-spoon, set portions of the mixture at intervals on sheets of thin paper; each piece should b9 about the size and shape of an English fowl’s egg ; dredge some sugar over them, and set the sheets in the oven on a flat board well wetted. The oven must be at the gentlest heat, and the baking as slow as possible. About forty-five minutes should elapse in obtaining the desired tint. As soon as the portions of egg assume a pale yellow tint, remove them from the oven, and at once detach them from the paper with a palette-knife. Each meringue will present the shape of half an egg cut lengthwise, because the side of the mixture which lies upon the baking board becomes flattened.

Nothing can be more erroneous than to suppose that any pudding can be “boiled or steamed” as so many directions have it. Much depends, as wall presently be explained, upon the composition of the pudding; that is to say, upon the materials used in its making. ♦ PROCESS I.—BOILING. Taking boiling first, the standard rules may be sum- marized as follows:— See that the table, spoons, cups, bowl, basin—that all the accessories in fact—are as clean as possible. In old-fashioned establishments, where very excellent puddings are often met with, the method of boiling pud- dings in cloths alone is still followed, and many maintain that, when expansion is to be expected during the cooking, no other way is as efficacious. Nevertheless, it is now almost a universal custom to use pudding basins or moulds enveloped in cloths. In any case it is very important that cloths should be scrupulously clean. They should never be washed with soap, a good scalding in boiling water, and thorough rubbing in two ar three changes of water afterwards, is the correct method of cleaning them ; wffien washed, rinse them in clean cold water, wring them dry, and hang them in the sun.

86 SWEET DISHES. of the water, which should be kept at a simmering pitch. When satisfied that the whole of the fat has melted, sus- pend operations, take the pan from the fire and let it get cold ; when cold, the clarified fat will become congealed upon the surface of the water. Now take it off in flakes, drain every drop of water from it, and put it into a clean saucepan ; melt it again, and strain it through a piece of muslin into an earthenware bowl. The fat will again consolidate in a firm, pale, yellow cake, as it were ; far harder than butter, though quite as sweet and clean, and the very thing you want for ordinary pastry and delicate saute work. Suet, thus clarified, will keep perfectly good a long time : it is moreover infinitely cleaner and nicer than raw suet freshly handled by the butcher, and, good- ness knows, by how many other people. Keep the bowl of suet in a cool place : in the ice-box, if possible. The fat that is skimmed from the surface of the soup- kettle is just as valuable, for it is generally the melted ■marrow from the broken shin : you do not get much of it, I know, probably a breakfast-cupful, at the outside ; but it is quite first rate, and the favourite frying medium of the great Car&me. The fat from the under-cut of a cold roast sirloin can be made use of exactly in the same way as the raw suet: clarify it according to the rules already given, and pour it into an earthenware bowl. As I said before, the water used in pastry-making should certainly be slightly iced : it need not be as cold as that we like to drink; but it should be decidedly cold to the touch. Having all the ingredients at hand, vis. :—a bowl of cold well-clarified suet, some dry well-sifted Hour, a good ripe lime, some salt, and a small jug of iced water, proceed as follows Cool the slab ; weigh a pound of the Hour and

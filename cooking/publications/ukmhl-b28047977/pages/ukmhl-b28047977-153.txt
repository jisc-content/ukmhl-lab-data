PUDDINGS. 185 with noyeau. When the cake has absorbed the custard,— a process that you must allow a few minutes for—com- plete the filling of the mould with custard thickened with crushed ratafias, cover its exposed end with buttered paper, and steam it for an hour according to Process III. Apricot sauce (given for amber pudding) should accompany. Coffee cabinet pudding (Poucling d la Turque) (steamed) :—Make a pint and a half of coffee custard referring to the recipe given (page 22). Let this get cold after straining it. Rutter a plain Charlotte mould with warm butter, line the inside of it with strips of stale Madeira cake, three-quarters of an inch wide, and cut a round of the cake to fit the bottom of the mould. Pack the interior of the mould with cake cut into strips laid cross- wise, and scatter amongst the layers a few spoonfuls of coarsely cut preserved cherries, pour into the mould the coffee custard, letting it settle, and leaving a space at the top to allow for a slight rising, then cover with a piece of buttered paper and steam gently according to Process III. Coffee sauce This might perhaps be better described as coffee syrup. Put three gills of water into a small enamelled saucepan over a good fire, stir into it six ounces of loaf or caster sugar, boil quickly till partly reduced, and then add two gills of very strong black coffee. Some like a few drops of vanilla essence. Chocolate cabinet pudding (Ponding d la Sicilienne) is made exactly like the foregoing, substituting chocolate custard for coffee. Chocolate sauce:—Put six ounces of powdered sugar into a small enamelled saucepan with four ounces of unsweetened chocolate, and three gills of w'ater : stir over the fire till the chocolate is dissolved and the mixture smooth, A few drops of vanilla essence should be added.

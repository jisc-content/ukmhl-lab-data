175 ON ICE-MAKING. promiscuously, pressing all well down, and setting the mass to freeze compactly. This kind of ice looks well in a conical mould called a parfait mould, and combinations such as strawberry and almond, raspberry and lemon, chocolate and vanilla, pistachio and chocolate, &c., are to be recommended. Now regarding the preparation of various mixtures for cream-ices. Nearly every recipe for ordinary creams can be followed for iced creams (see remarks on this subject, page 25). As I have already explained, the foundation of all cream-making is a good custard. In the case of cream-ices made with fruit, especially with fresh fruit, an exception may be made in favour of pure cream alone when enough can be spared. The recipe given for straw- berry cream (page 26) may be taken as a good guide. The fruit worked to a puree should be passed through a sieve, sweetened, blended with the cream whipped to a stiff froth, moulded, and frozen in the usual way. A squeeze of a lemon brings out the flavour of fruit, and counteracts over-sweetening. The amount of sweetness may be regulated by taste.

If carefully treated, the American canned fruits provide the ice-maker with excellent materials. But cream, as every one knows, is more easily talked of than obtained in this part of the world. If at all doubtful regarding its quality, it is far wiser to fall back upon the

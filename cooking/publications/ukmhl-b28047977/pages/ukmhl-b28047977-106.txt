If you have a little good iced-butter to spare, the above proportions may be altered as follows :—Three quarters of a pound of suet, and one quarter of a pound of butter. The yolks of two eggs may be beaten up with the first quarter pint of water with advantage. Baking-powder may he used advantageously in pastry making: here is Yeatman and Co.’s recipe for puff-paste made in connection with their yeast powder :— Measure three breakfast-cupfuls of carefully-sifted flour and two cupfuls of butter, ('hoose a cool place to work in, see that the flour is good and dry, and the butter firm and free from moisture. Fill two shallow baking tins with broken ice, and set to work in this way:—Put the flour upon a cool slab, mixing into it a heaped-up teaspoonful of the baking powder; when mixed, form the flour in a ring, as it were, and in the centre throw the yolk of an egg and a teaspoonful of salt : add a little iced-water, and gradually work the flour into it from the inside of the ring, sprinkling additional water as you require it (about one breakfast-cupful altogether) until you have a smooth, fine paste, completely free from all stickiness. Pat this into a lump, and put it into the ice-box fora quarter of an hour; after that, roll it out pretty thickly, the size and shape of a dinner plate : put the butter upon it, and wrap the edges of the paste inwards, carefully covering the butter. Now turn it upside down, and roll it out very thin ; reverse it again, and fold it in three. Place it thus folded upon a clean baking sheet over one of the pans of broken ice, and lay the other pan of ice upon it. Eepeat this cooling process between each double turn afterwards, and use the paste as soon as five turns have been completed. Observe the free use of ice. advocated in this receipt, although it was composed for English and American

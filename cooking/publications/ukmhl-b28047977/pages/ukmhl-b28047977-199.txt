ON ICE-MAKING 181 Water Ices. Water Ices should be made in these proportions :— Half a pint of pure juice, or pur6e, to a pint of syrup (page 46) with a squeeze of a lime. A few drops of cochineal is given to pink ices. As with cream, so with water ices, •fruits in tins and bottles, jams, and prepared fruit syrups, may be used. In the case of the last, add the juice of a lime to the syrup as it is when poured from the bottle, and to a pint bottle, add a coffee-cupful of water. The process to he followed for water ices, therefore, is a simple one:—Make a nicely-flavoured sweet syrup, and ice it. The commonest attention will enable you to make syrups of strawberry, raspberry, currants, black, red, and white, Bangalore raspberries, mangoes, greengages, pine- apple, ginger, lime, peach, apple, pear, citron, marmalade, orange, apricot, cherry, &c. Moulding, when required, should be conducted in the manner described for cream- ices.

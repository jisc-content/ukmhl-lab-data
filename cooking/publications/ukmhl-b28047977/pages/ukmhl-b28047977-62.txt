44 SWEET DISHES. ready for their garnish which may be varied to a consider- able extent. Take for example :— A A Croutes aux peches:—Having laid out the crmltes in the manner just described—let us say twelve, so as to fix quantities accurately—open a tin of American preserved peaches, and select twelve half peaches of nice shape and firmness. Put these into a clean enamelled stewpan with just sufficient of the syrup of the tin to float them. Bring the contents of the pan nearly to the boil, then take the pan from the fire, and with a trussing needle or skewer take the pieces of fruit out one by one, laying each convex side uppermost on a croute. Return the pan to the fire, add enough syrup of sugar and water to make up a pint in all, stir in four table-spoonfuls of apricot jam, the juice of two limes, the zest of one of them, and a liqueur glass of rum, stir this over a fast fire, adding by degrees a dessert-spoonful of cornflour, and work the whole together until you get a golden velvety liquid as thick as batter. Pass this through a clean pointed strainer, as it cools over each peach masking both the fruit and the croute on which it rests. When cold the masking will be nearly firm. Encourage this by placing the dish of croiltes over ice, and when ready to serve, take them out one by one with a slice, lay them in compote dishes, and send round with them whipped cream or iced cream served separately. Some squeeze whipped cream tlnough a forcing bag upon the top of each croute, but I do not recommend it, for, unless very well managed, it looks messy. This preparation of syrup with apricot jam for masking fruit, croutes, etc., is called Apricot glaze.

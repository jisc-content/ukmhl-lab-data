226 SWEE.T DISHES. After tlie addition of the brandy, Madeira, essences, and butter, which, by the way, should be managed spoonful by spoonful, the whole composition will look smooth; it will then be ready for the oven. Choose a round tin, somewdiat shallow in proportion to its diameter, butter it with melted butter, line its bottom and sides with liberally- buttered white paper,—the bottom being protected from burning by at least a dozen layers of paper,—and pour in the cake mixture. Be careful not to allow it to fill the tin,—about a quarter of the depth should be left empty to admit of expansion during the baking, cover the top of the cake with a well-buttered paper to protect it from burning also, and then bake. The oven should be decid- edly moderate, and five to six hours should be allowed for the baking. When ready, remove it from the oven, let it cool a little, and then turn it out.

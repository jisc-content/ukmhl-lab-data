PANCAKES, SOUFFLES, AND OMELETTES. 75 however, think that the tin is the safer of the two for the Indian kitchen. The bazaar tin-man will make you a couple of tins, such as I have described, for a trifle, and if care- fully emptied, washed, and dried immediately after using they will retain a bright polish for a long time. Tin unten- sils are ruined by being washed and put away wet; rust soon settles upon them, and then they are done for. It is a good plan to paste round the wall of the tin on the inside a band of tbickish drawing paper, which may be allowed to extend a couple of inches or so higher than the tin, and thus protect the souffle when it rises from brim- ming over. Also to set the tin upon a wire drainer as a protection from burning at the bottom. Having procured a proper tin,—and, believe me, you can never make a real souffle in a shallow dish like a pie dish,—the first and easiest example for us to consider is the omelette soufflee. The difference between this dish and the souffle proper is that it is composed without any flour or milk : it is, in plain terms, a baked omelette. Nothing can be lighter than one of these souffles : if served at the right moment, they rarely fail to come off successfully. Take this recipe for a small one!—I3reak three eggs, separate the yolks from the whites, beat two of the former only with one and-a-half ounce of powdered sugar, flavour the sweetened yolks with lemon essence or vanilla and whip the three whites to a very stiff froth; when quite firm, mix them thoroughly with the yolks, pour the mix- ture at once into a buttered tin, put it into a fast oven, and serve it as soon as it has risen to perfection, dusting it over with powdered sugar an route to the table. Note. In putting the souffle mixture into a tin, be careful never to fill the latter. Leave at least a quarter of the tin empty to allow for the rising of the souffle. In the following receipt the proportion of whites to yolks

11 JELLIES. the jelly does not turn out after the first dipping, repeat the process. If you deliberate upon the recipe I have just given for the champagne jelly with fruit, you will at once perceive that it will serve as a guide for several clear bright jellies. All that you have to do is to vary the wine that is to flavour, and the fruit which is to garnish them. Thus, noyeau jelly with apricots, maraschino jelly with peaches, kirsch jelly with cherries, punch (milk) jelly with pine-apple, curacoa jelly with strawberries, chartreuse jelly with greengages, moselle jelly with angelica, vanilla jelly with pears, &c., are all composed upon a similar foundation. First:—gelatine and sugar dissolved in water with the whites of two eggs and the juice of one lime,—a clarify- ing process that is to say. Then careful straining; and when perfectly satisfactory as regards limpidity, the blending of the flavouring wine or liqueur. It should, however, be noted that the clarifying process just described refers to the old-fashioned opaque gelatine ; the modern sheet gelatine—especially the French ai’ticle— is as clear as glass and requires no special clarification. Half a pint of wine, or a full wine-glass of liqueur, is enough for the jelly I describe, which, allowing for loss during the clarifying stage, will be about an imperial pint and a quarter. When thus composed, there follows, of course, the setting process. If the quantity of liquid happen to fall short of the amount required to fill the mould, you can obviously add a little cold wrater, and a trifle more wdne or liqueur. But it is a wise thing, after you have selected the mould you intend to employ, to measure its capacity with water, and so note beforehand the exact quantity of liquid that you will require to fill it, and regulate the gelatine accordingly.

SWEET DISHES. 36 entremets for which pastry cases are required. These I propose to give here, for the paste used is not of any special kind. Let us take :— Creme a la Diplomate.—This is a ratafia cream set in a casing of cake. A stale madeira cake, if large enough, will supply the material for the case, or finger biscuits (Savoys). Choose a round Charlotte mould and out of a slice of the cake a quarter of an inch thick cut a top for the cream, and lay it on the bottom of the mould; this may be arranged in triangular-shaped pieces with the points joining in the centre if convenient. To line the wall of the mould cut strips of cake about an inch and a quarter wide, a third of inch thick, and the length of the side of the mould. Having cut enough of these to go completely round the mould, fasten them together one by one inside it, using glace royale, or cook’s adhesive paste, made with white of egg and icing sugar; mix this to about the consistency of good gum, and apply it to the sides of the cake strips with a brush as sold with bottles of gum, pressing them together. When dry the case will be found firm, but do not remove it from the mould. Mix a cream as follows for a pint and-a-half mould :— Make a pint of rich custard, and while hot mix into it an ounce of dissolved gelatine, add the zest and juice of a lime, and pass it through a clean hair sieve into a bowl set over ice, Now stir into it two ounces of finely grated ratafias and .a sherry glass of kirsch; mix well with a whisk and, as the mixture gets cold, whip it, passing into it two gills of whipped cream. Having set the mould containing the case in ice, pour into it the cream, shaking it well home, let it remain until firmly set, and then turn it out when required. The case will be found closely united to the cream. A red currant syrup flavoured with kirseh should be poured round the mould. In making

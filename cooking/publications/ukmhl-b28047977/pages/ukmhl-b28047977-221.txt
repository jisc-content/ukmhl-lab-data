FRUIT PRESERVING 20 3 pan cold, and gradually brought to the boil, being well stirred all the time ; it should be then cooled, and returned to the basin. If the fermentation be decidedly active, additional sugar is necessary. This should be gently dredged over, and stirred into the jam as it is heating. Avoid over-boiling, as it makes the jam waxy, and gives it a dark colour. If, after further watching, there are no signs of effervescence, the jam can be potted. The glass jars or pots must be dry and clean. Fill them with jam to within half an inch of the tops, lay over the surfaces rounds of paper cut to fit the jars and dipped in brandy. Tie over the top of the jars larger rounds of paper brushed over on the inside with white of egg : do this while the papers are wet, and they will contract when dry, fitting the tops of the pots like the skin of a drum, and excluding all air. For Strawberry jelly :—Equal weights of pure straw- berry juice and sugar should be boiled together for half an hour, skimmed clear of scum, and then potted. Extract the juice as explained in the first recipe. Raspberry jam made of the Bangalore fruit ought to be better called blackberry jam, for the berry is not a rasp- berry, nor has it the flavour of any fruit but the black- berry. For the jam, follow the recipe for strawberry jam. There are, however, two other methods of preserving this berry, viz. :—Blackberry cheese, and Blackberry jelly. The former is the more economical of the two. The fruit is very sweet, so half a pound of sugar to the pound of berries will be found sufficient. Crush the berries, put them into a preserving pan, and set it on the fire for twenty-five minutes : the fire should be a brisk one : add a glass of brandy while stirring and skimming the surface of the preserve. When skimmed clear, pass the whole through a clean sieve into a bowl, extracting the seeds

FRIT TEES. two of the eggs (according to the number used) well whisked to a stiff froth. The batter is then ready. The important points for observation here are, first that the batter should be prepared two or three hours before it is wanted, next that lukewarm water is used, and, lastly, that the bowl containing the mixture should be kept in a warmish place. By this method a slight fermentation sets in, as in the case of bread-making, which renders the batter very light. There is no better recipe than this to be found anywhere for frying batter, such as should be used for all fritter work, with a little sugar and a few drops of lime-juice, according to quantity in sweet cookery, salt in savoury. There is therefore nothing to be gained by adding a number of old-fashioned receipts for this pre- paration. The addition of a table-spoonful of brandy, rum or liqueur is optional and no doubt flavour is improved by it, but it does not in any way influence the quality of the batter in so far as its frying capability is concerned. A little practice enables a cook to judge when the bat- ter has reached the proper consistence. If too thick, it will form heavy lumps which no frying will penetrate and make crisp. It should be just sufficiently fluid to coat the spoon with a film smooth and creamy, one-eighth of an inch thick for plain fritters ; for fruit fritters it may be very slightly thicker. Assuming now that the batter has been properly mixed, the next important points are the frying medium, its quantity, and temperature. First touching the medium to be employed. Of this two kinds only need be considered for the Indian kitchen, clarified beef suet or fat, and ghee. The process of pre- paring the former is described in Chapter VII. I consider it by far the best medium for all round friture work, but it may not always be within reach, so it is necessary to

95 PASTBY. Fanchonettes are little puffs of a round shape like miniature mince-pies; they can be filled with any nice jam, or cheese-cake mixture. Fanclionettos d’abricots— round puffs, two and a half inches in diameter, filled with apricot jam (a dessert-spoonful) brushed over with white of egg and frosted with powdered sugar, make very excellent little morsels whether hot for dinner, or cold for the supper table or luncheon basket. Lemon or rather Lime Puffs are easily made. Take four or five limes, four ounces of preserved apples and four ounces of sugar. Peel the limes very finely, and boil the peel, then heat it to a paste, add four ounces of butter, the apple minced small, and a quarter of a poiind of sugar, with the juice of th6 limes. Put the mixture into a stewpan and let it simmer till it becomes as thick as marmalade ; when cold, lay a table-spoonful of this in the centre of a small square of puff-paste, fold it into a cocked hat, secure the edges with white of egg, frost the puff's with white of egg and sugar, and bake. Banbury Cakes, are cocked-hat-shaped puffs contain- ing a mixture, not unlike that for a mince-pie. This is a reliable receipt for it: half a pound of butter beaten to a cream or the same weight of beef suet finely minced, half a pound candied lemon and orange peel pared very thinly and finely minced, one pound of currants carefully picked, half an ounce of cinnamon, two and a half ounces of pounded sweet almonds, and a quarter of a pound of sugar. Mix all thoroughly and keep it in a jar, taking what you want from time to time. The juice of a ripe lime, and a wine-glass of good brandy should be stirred into the jar when the mixture has settled therein. When you make the puffs, follow the directions already given for three-cornered puffs, brush them over with white of egg and dust over it while wet a spoonful or so of powdered sugar.

CAKES, ETC, 215 Next in importance to the butter come the eggs. A mus- ty bazaar egg, odorous of the decayed straw upon which it has rested, for goodness knows how many days, will do almost has much harm as the milkmanâ€™s mixture of grease, to which I have just alluded. Select the eggs to the best of your ability, and, having broken the shells, empty the whites into one bowl, and the yolks into another, satisfy- ing yourself of the freshness of each egg broken.

Currant and raisins should be picked, stoned, washed, and dried, with the utmost attention, as already explained in the case of puddings. The grit caused by currant stones, or bits of stick, will spoil an otherwise excellent cake. The sugar is a very important item. It should be white and thoroughly refined.

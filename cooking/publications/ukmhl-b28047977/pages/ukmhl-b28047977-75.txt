57 FRITTERS. The temperature of the medium requires very careful attention, for upon it depends the success of the opera- tion—the crispness and colour of the fritter. If insuffi- ciently heated a leathery result will follow, and if too hot the colour will be bad. “ Test it as follows,” says Goufffi, “throw into it a crumb of bread the size of a nut; if it fizzes briskly and at once produces large air bubbles, the fat has reached the degree of heat required.” If smoke rises from the surface of the fat, the heat is too great. The best way of testing is to put the piece of bread on the point of a skewer, and try the fat at intervals of a minute till the right indications are observed. The fat bath being sufficiently deep and hot, the next thing to remember is that the immersion of the thing to be fried reduces the temperature of the medium, and that it is necessary in consequence slightly to accelerate the heat. Now note the colour of the fritter, and stop as soon as a deep golden yellow has been attained. After that there is the draining, and, lastly, the dusting of powdered loaf sugar. For all dishes belonging to the class we are now discussing, powdered loaf sugar is essential. For draining purposes a wire drainer as used by pastry cooks is the best appliance. Unfortunately this is not easy to procure, but a good substitute can readily be made in this way:—have a strong teakwood frame made fifteen inches by twelve; nail over this a piece of the smallest meshed wire netting; under each corner fix a little block of teak two and a half inches high and an inch square in thickness. These will form the props or legs to raise the frame above the level of the table. To use a drainer, place it as close as you conveniently can to the fire, putting under it a piece of brown or other absorbent paper folded in two to catch the drip; then, as 4a

SWfiET DISHES. 28 in a bowl, whipped cream is added; the whole being poured into a mould, and deeply embedded in ice until wanted. The speciality of these creams is their exceeding coldness, the moulds used for them must be hermetically closing ones, as used for ices, for they can then be com- pletely covered with ice and salt without danger. The only diffex'ence in fact between a cream a la Moscovite and an iced cream appears to be that the former is con- gealed with the aid of gelatine and intense cold, while the latter is frozen in the ice pail. The proportion of jellied puree to cream should be measure for measure equally. Yelyet cream:—Dissolve in a small enamelled stew- pan over the lire an ounce of gelatine with two gills of water and two of sherry, the juice of two limes, and sufficient sugar to sweeten the liquid nicely. Let it get cold, set it on ice, and, when beginning to congeal, add half a pint of whipped cream: pour the mixture into a mould, and bury it in ice till thoroughly firm. Creme au caramel, and Creme au praline.—These are made exactly in the same manner. For a pint and a half mould make a pint of rich custard, stir into it while hot an ounce and a quarter of dissolved gelatine, and a breakfast cupful of either caramel or praline made as already explained and well pounded ; stir well till cold, then whip the custard in a bowl over ice, and pass into it a gill of whipped cream, fill the mould, set in ice, and in due course turn it out. Dauphine cream.—(Creme a la Dauphine). Boil, strain and cool three gills of milk, turn this to a custard with five yolks of eggs, adding an ounce of sugar, and a little less than an ounce of soaked gelatine ; when well mixed and smooth, pass the custard through a clean hair sieve into a bowl set over ice. When cold whip the custard, and pass into it a gill of whipped cream. Set a pint and a half mould in ice

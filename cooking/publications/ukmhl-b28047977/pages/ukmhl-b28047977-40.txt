SWEET DISHES. 0,0 yolks requii'es attention, for if hurriedly attempted over too severe a fire, the result will be lumpy instead of smooth, more like o&ufs browillea in fact. For custard-making I recommend the porridge pot men- tioned in the Table of equipments. It is a roomy double saucepan on the bain-mane principle, and admirably adapted to custard-making. Plain custard.—One pint of new milk, five good-sized or six small eggs, three ounces of sugar, and a few drops of lemon-essence. Work as follows : — pour the milk into a very clean saucepan, flavour it with the lemon-essence, and a stick of cinnamon ; when on the point of boiling, strain it off into another saucepan, let it get cool, and stir in the sugar, and the yolks well beaten and strained; set the saucepan in your bain-marie, or in any roomy vessel partly filled with boiling water, upon the fire. Continue to stir with a whisk until it thickens, and when the mixture coats the spoon nicely, you may consider it finished. Pass the custard through a clean hair sieve into a bowl to get cold before serving. Another way is to mix the boiled milk with the yolks, sugar and flavouring in an enamelled bowl, to place the howl over a roomy vessel containing boiling water over the fire, and to whisk the mixture till it thickens suffi- ciently. Coffee custard.—For twelve glasses measure out four breakfast cupfuls of boiled milk, put it in a basin with one breakfast cupful of very strong, clear, and carefully strained coffee ; add the yolks of five eggs, and one apd a half ounce of pounded sugar; mix thoroughly and strain. Skim off all froth, and cook the custard as already described in a saucepan plunged into a larger vessel containing boiling water; when sufficiently thickened, pour the custard into the glasses, and set them in the ice-box.

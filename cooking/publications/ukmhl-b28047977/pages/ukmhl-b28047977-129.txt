FANCY PASTRY. Ill sifted, and the zest of two oranges or three limes. When well blended and warm, remove the bowl from the pan, beat its contents till they are cold and then add the, whites of the eggs stiffly whipped and two ounces and a half of flour with a sherry-glass of rum. Bake the paste in quite a moderate oven using it for service in moulds like savdrins, or in slab for cutting up like G6nois. Venetian paste is another form of Savoy : Beat to- gether in the same way four yolks and three ounces of sugar, add two ounces of fine almond paste, cool, and add the stiffly beaten whites with three ounces of flour and a liqueur-glass of noyeau.

Put half a pound of apricot jam into a stewpan, with half a pint of Madeira; boil for three minutes, stirring into it with a silver spoon a dessert-spoonful of arrowroot diluted with a little water. With this a smooth glaze will be produced. When the brioche is done, cut the bottom of it level, so that, when turned out of the mould, it will stand upright; turn it out, and cut it horizontally into four equal rounds ; spread over each round a layer of the apricot glaze and replace the slices again, one over the other, as formed in the mould; brush the outside of the cake with some of the rest of the glaze and serve what may remain in a boat as a sauce. This should come to table quite hot. A Timbale de brioche aux fruits is not difficult. Butter a plain mould and line it with brioche paste a

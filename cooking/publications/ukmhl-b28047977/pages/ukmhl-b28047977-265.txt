247 BISCUITS AND DESSERT. having sliced off this piece, put it on one side of your plate, and proceed to scoop out the stone with your silver spoon, detaching in that operation as little of the flesh of the fruit as you can. Having extracted the stone, scrape the pulp out of the slice you first cut off, and empty it into the cavity left by the stone ; now detach the rest of the pulp round it, and mix the whole well together, adding a liqueur- glass of liqueur brandy, and a dessert-spoonful of powdered loaf-sugar. If the mango be really well iced and a good one, the result will be found very pleasing. Inasmuch, however, as at a dinner party the eating of a mango may be considered out of the question, slices of the fruit, dressed as I have just described, iced, and served as a salad, form a very nice dessert-dish. The association of spirits and liqueurs with fresh fruit is considered by many to be quite as appropriate as the use of cream. In handing round melons, mangoes, pine- apples, strawberries, &c., therefore, I would always let the brandy accompany the cream, so that those who prefer the former may have an opportunity of indulging their taste. As a dessert-dish nothing is nicer for a change than a Strawberry salad:â€”Having obtained a nice dish of strawberries, pick off' their stalks, casting each berry into a slop basin full of cold water: stir them gently round in the water to get rid of sand, earth, &c., &c.; then set them on a clean sieve to drain : when thoroughly dry, arrange the fruit in a pyramid upon a dessert-dish, using a desseit-knife and fork to conduct the operation, and handling each berry carefully. When you have arranged the bottom layer of your pyramid, dust over it a layer of pounded loaf-sugar, continuing a similar process until you ciown the pyramid with the choicest berry; now measure a liqueur-glass of the best brandy you can command, and let the spirit trickle in and over your layers of strawberries;

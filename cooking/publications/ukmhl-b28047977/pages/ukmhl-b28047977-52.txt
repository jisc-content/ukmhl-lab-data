SWEET DISHES. 34 It need scarcely be pointed out that the top of the mould may be decorated with patterns cut out of crys- tallized fruit. Crearn may be added to the custard while it is cooling with great advantage. The quantities I have given are for a quart mould. # \ / Rice a Tlmperatrice (Biz a VImpiratrice) :—This dish may be served cold as well as in the form of an iced pudding.

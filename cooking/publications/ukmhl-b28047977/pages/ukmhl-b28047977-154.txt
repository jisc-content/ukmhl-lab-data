SWEET DISHES. 136 Of course, if prepared French chocolate Menier or Suchard is used both sugar and flavouring essence may be un- necessary or considerably reduced according to taste. There are so many kinds of chocolate in the grocery lists that it is impossible to fix proportions accurately. Both of these puddings are almost better when served cold, and the sauces are quite as nice. If liked, plainly whipped cream, sweetened and flavoured with either coffee or chocolate, as the case may be, may be substituted for the syrups. Pompadour pudding (Ponding cl la Pompadour) [boiled): Put into a basin four ounces of stale cake or bread crumbs, two ounces of pounded sweet almonds, with three bitter ones also pounded, seven ounces of finely-shred suet, two ounces of maccaroons crushed to powder, three ounces of sugar, two ounces of dried cherries, four ounces of candied peel and citron, a salt-spoonful of nutmeg grated, and a salt-spoonful of salt. When these things have been well mixed together, stir in seven whole eggs, and a sherry- glass of rum. Pour the mixture into a buttered mould (which it should fill completely), cover it with buttered paper, tie it up securely in a floured cloth, and boil it for three hours and a half. Almond sauce:—Boil together a quarter of a pint of water and a half that quantity of new milk. Pour into this while boiling, stirring all the time, a dessert-spoonful of arrowroot, previously diluted with a little water; add sugar to taste, and off the fire while cooling a little the beaten yolks of two eggs; flavour with twenty drops of almond essence and finish the sauce as you serve it with a liqueur-glass of noyeau. Lady Abbess pudding (Ponding a i'Abesse> (boiled) : —Choose a juicy eoeoanut, save its water in a bowl and scrape all the soft nutty part into it as in curry-making.

It is highly desirable that the saucepans, sieves, stew- pans, strainers, mortar, and baking tins, be set apart, and reserved for the sweet department only. The moulds may be of tin, tinned steel, or copper. If carefully cleaned and dried in the sun after using, the first will last a long time, and answer all purposes satis- factorily. The porridge pan will be found most useful for custard-making, being a pan within a pan, on the bain- marie principle.

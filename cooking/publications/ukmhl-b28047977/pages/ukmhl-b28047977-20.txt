2 SWEET DISHES. In addition to the reasons I have already mentioned, how unsatisfactory it is to send out wine, liqueur, jam, fruits, &c., to the kitchen, and when the dish comes to table to find a miserable parody of the thing we expected, with no flavour of wine or liqueur, and with certainly quite half the fruit or jam gone. In order to prevent the mysterious evaporation of these dainty and expensive ingredients, the eye of the mistress is therefore much to be desired. In the simple matter of sugar it is actually surprising to note how much nicer entremets are that a lady has superintended, than those that the butler and cook have concocted alone. The native cook over-sweetens everything unless carefully watched, and can rarely overcome his natural instincts when the chance of appropriation is placed before him. The utensils required for the preparation of sweet dishes are:— 2 stewpans, one 8 and one 10-inch, in white enamel. 3 small saucepans, one 4, one 6 and one 8-inch in ditto. 1 8-inch steel saute-pan. 1 10-inch do. omelette pan. 1 4-pint porridge pan. 3 hair sieves, in sizes. 1 set of tamis cloths. 2 perforated tin strainers 3 bowls in sizes, 12, 14, 16 inches. 1 marble 10-inch mortar and pestle.

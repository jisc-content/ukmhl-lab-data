2CX- Puddings—Class III (Miscellaneous.) gjl^-^STLY it may be as well to say a few words about plain puddings, and some of the standard English compositions which always seem popular. For instance, let us take the Dumplings, remembering that a really good apple or mango dumpling deserves a place in the menu of any quiet dinner. With many people, indeed, a well-boiled fruit-pudding is more popular than a tart. The preparation of a fruit dumpling, though simple enough, requires care. First there is the paste:— Put a pound of flour in a basin, mix with it six ounces of clarified beef-suet cut up into little pieces; put in a salt-spoonful of salt, and one of sugar; make a paste of this with half a pint of cold water, and, when nice and smooth, turn it out on a well-floured slab, and roll it out half an inch thick or a little thicker. Butter may be used instead of suet, but if the latter be clarified and pounded smoothly before using (see chapter vn) very little is to be gained by using butter. The addition of two well-beaten whole eggs to the water undoubtedly improves the paste. Choose a round basin, butter it well, lay the paste inside the basin, lining it, as it were, and leaving enoimh overlapping the rim to catch the piece of paste which is laid over the pudding after it has been packed.

52 SWEET DISHES. Compotes, the syrups of which are assisted by fruit juices, are often specially named by modern French cooks, viz.:—Compote cle poires cm sir op frambois'e,-, abricotc, fraise, <&c. Compotes are sometimes decorated superficially with broken jelly—punch jelly, for instance, over a pine-apple compote, &c. Those which are garnished with cream or water ices are \ called compotes a la Prince de Galles having been first introduced at Marlborough House. A compote of fruits assortis with vanilla cream ice is a favourite one. The syrups of these compotes should he nicely flavoured with liqueur. To prepare one of them properly the fruit should be arranged in a deep china dish and moistened with a rather thick syrup just sufficiently to come level with the top. The ice should be kept ready in its mould in the ice-pail. When the moment of service arrives, the dish having been set as cold as possible should be taken out of the ice-box, and the iced cream laid over its surface with a large silver spoon. This is sometimes arranged in a rough rocky way without reference to pattern, some- times in neat rows or circles of spoonfuls, and sometimes flat, smoothed over by the spatula. Note that the fruit should he as cold as possible for the effect of the ice with fruit at the ordinary temperature is as if the latter were warm. Fruits frappes au champagne is another variety of compote :—Prepare an assortment of fruit in the style of fruits doves. That is to say, having made the fruit very- cold, glaze it by gentle basting with cold syrup over ice. The bowl of silver or china holding the fruit should be kept as cold as possible, and, at the time required, iced champagne, in quantity sufficient to moisten the whole well, should be poured in.

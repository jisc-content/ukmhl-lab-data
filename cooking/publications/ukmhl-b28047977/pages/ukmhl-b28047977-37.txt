19 ■JELLIES. improvement, but, being entirely a matter of taste, is not an essential. And now for Calf’s-foot jelly, which, we must re- member, is not to be passed over in spite of preserved isinglass or the gelatine to which I have alluded, for in India we may at any time be unable to procure either of those substitutes. We will call it “ calf’s-foot jelly,” but we must use sheep’s feet or ox-heels to make it, since calves are rarely slain for the market in this Presidency. For a good-sized jelly, choose two ox-heels, or twelve trotters, clean them very carefully, split them, and put them into a large.stewpan, covering them with cold water; skim the surface continually as the water gets warm, bring gradually to the boil, after which reduce the heat and keep the temperature at the simmering point for six hours, occasionally adding a little hot water to make good the loss by evaporation. At the end of six hours, strain off the liquid from the feet, and set it in a bowl to cool. Remove the fat now with studious care, catching the small globules up with blotting paper. When satisfied that no grease remains, the clarifying must be carried out in this way. Pour the liquid, or if it has solidified (as it would on the Hills), put the jelly cold into a clean stew- pan with half an ounce of sugar for each trotter used, or six for the two ox-heels, and the juice and zest of three ripe limes. Set it on fire. Beat up the whites of four eggs in a basin with a few drops of water, take a coffee- cupful of the liquefied jelly, mix it with the whipped egg, working it well with the whisk, then pour it into the stew- pan with the rest of the jelly, and continue to stir freely until boiling sets in. Move the pan at once to the edge of the fire and let its contents simmer very gently for a quarter of an hour, then pour the jelly through flannel. Pour it back, and strain it again and again until it is per- fectly clear, after this leave it in a basin until you desire

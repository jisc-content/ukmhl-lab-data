SWEET DISHES. 112 quarter of an inch thick. Select any nice fruit you like, apples or pears in quarters, slices of pine-apple, apricots or peaches cut in halves. If the fruit be preserved, you can pack the mould at once with it, dusting it with pow- dered sugar, and sprinkling any nice liqueur over it. If it be raw, stew it first very gently in syrup, giving it a dash of brandy or liqueur. When the timbale is filled, cover it with brioche paste, fastening the sides securely with white of egg, but leaving an opening in the centre of the cover. Bake the timbale in a moderate oven: when done, cover the whole in the top with a fleuron of paste, turn it out of the mould on to a dish, reverse it upon another dish, remove the fleuron, and pour in a coffee- cupful of hot syrup, flavoured with noyeau; replace the fleuron and serve. Abricots a la Conde should be prepared in this manner :â€”Mix four table-spoonfuls of cornflour with one and a half pint of milk, and three ounces of sugar, flavour it with vanilla essence, and stir it over the fire till it thickens to a paste. Take half this paste, spread it on a dish, and let it get cold, then shape it into croquettes the size and shape of wine corks; dip them in egg, and roll them in rasped ratafia crumbs. Make a border of savarin, genois, or savoy paste (previously described), by baking it in a flat topped border mould: when turned out, it will form an oval or ring an inch and a half high. Strain a tinful of apricots from their syrup, and fry the croquettes of cornflour paste in hot fat; arrange the apricots in halves overlapping each other all along the surface of the savarin, garnish with the croquettes, fill the centre of the savarin with the rest of the cornflour paste diluted with boiling cream, garnish its surface with the remaining apricots in a little pile, and glaze the whole with the apri- cot syrup reduced and flavoured with noyeau. Serve hot

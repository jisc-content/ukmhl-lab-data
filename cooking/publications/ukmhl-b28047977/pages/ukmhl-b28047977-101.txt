chapter vii. ♦ Pastry. N sweet cookery our attention can be confined to :— (a) —Puff paste (pate feuilletee). (b) —Short crust (pdte a tcirte). (c) —Brioche paste (pate d brioche). (<l)—Fancy pastes (Grenoise, scivarin, Ac.) Puff Paste.—First, if you can possibly get one, you should use a marble pastry slab. In Madras, the chief diffi- culty the pastry-maker has to contend against is the high temperature. A jugful of iced water poured slowly over the surface of the slab (since marble retains cold far more readily than wood) is the surest safeguard. In fact, without iced water at his elbow, the cook can scarcely hope to turn out really light puff pastry. I have heard a good many people speak in high praise of the pastry that they have eaten on the Neilgherries, and express wonder that similarly excellent feuilletage is rarely met with on the plains. This, as I have said, is a mere matter of temperature. The next golden rule is that which enjoins scrupulous cleanliness. Everything connected with this department must be as bright and clean as possible. A third law, which I think the Native cooks rarely obey, is the oue that demands the careful weighing of ingredients.

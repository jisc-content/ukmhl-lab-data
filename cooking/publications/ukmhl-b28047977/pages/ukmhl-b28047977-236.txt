218 SWEET DISHES. Icing. It is customary to finish rich cakes with icing. The term is of course derived from the wintery appearance produced on the surface of a cake by a canopy of white sugar which is also sometimes described by the word frosting. Delicately-made pastes of almond, pistachio nut, etc., are associated with icing when an elaborate cake is required, and these preparations are frequently also called icings. I prefer, however, to keep the two things distinct : the icing or frosting as the outer covering on the one hand, and the pastes by their proper names on the other. Icing or Frosting:—It is, to begin with, necessary to have proper icing sugar for this preparation. In India, probably, this connot be purchased; but it can easily be made by pounding the best white loaf-sugar, and sifting it again and again, till the sugar is soft and powdery as flour. Having done this, proceed as follows :—Put the whites of five eggs into a bowl or enamelled basin over ice or in very cold water and whisk them to a stiff froth mixing with it, by degrees as the froth forms, a pound of the icing sugar; sprinkle this with a juice of a lime, and continue whisking until the icing is smooth, white, and glossy, but not as stiff as meringue mixture ; it will take a good deal of steady whisking to get this effect properly. To apply the icing, use a broad palette knife, spreading it evenly over the surface of the cake, and smoothing it neatly. This should be done while the cake is still warm after baking. When the icing has been laid on, the cake should be placed in a very moderate oven for the icing to dry and harden. Of course, icing can be tinted with cochineal, or spinach- greening. All ornaments must be laid on while the icing is still moist.

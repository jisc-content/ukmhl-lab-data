The apparatus required is by no means complicated :—simply a deep bucket or pail of wood sufficiently wide to hold the mould to be frozen, with plenty of room to spare for a plentiful packing of ice and salt at the bottom, side, and top. A vent for the escape of thawed ice is necessary in the side of the pail at the bottom.

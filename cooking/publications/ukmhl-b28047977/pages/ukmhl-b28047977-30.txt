12 SWEET DISHES. The vanilla jelly with pears, which I mentioned in the list just now, is a rosy pink one, flavoured with cr&me de vanille liqueur, tinted pink with raspberry juice, or syrup, and garnished with pears in slices. Jellies composed of fruit syrups may be taken next in rank to those which owe their flavour to the juice of the grape, or liqueurs. If you use the made syrups, which are sold for ice-making, your work will be remarkably simple, for you can clarify the syrup with the gelatine, i.e., dissolve the latter in the former, whisking with them the whites of two eggs and the lime-juice over the fire till boiling point is reached, then simmer twenty minutes, strain and cool; when cold add liqueur if desired. A dash of liqueur is always an improvement, but it must be kept subordinate to the flavouring of the fruit. Admirable syrups can obviously be made by diluting red or black currant jelly, or raspberry currant, and strawberry jam. The flavour of the raspberry will be found excellent. The juice of a lime should be always added when making syrups in this manner, and if you desire to make a pellucid jelly, the straining must be carefully attended to. Claret jelly (Gelee de Bordeaux):â€”Commence in the standard manner if you want it clear, and amalgamate the claret (or burgundy) with the clarified gelatine, as you did in the case of the champagne jelly. But the following recipe produces an excellent result. Remember not to use a tinned utensil. t One bottle of claret, four ounces of white sugar, one glass of brandy, the finely peeled rind of one well-washed lime, the juice of three, one tea-cupful of raspberry syrup (extracted from half a pound of jam, if you have none ready made) and one and-a-half ounce of gelatine. Boil all together, skim very carefully, and strain through a fine sieve. This will be a rosy, and a nice looking jelly, but

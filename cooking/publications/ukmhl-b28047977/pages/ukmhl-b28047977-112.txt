94 SWEET DISHES. cheese-cake mixture. Roll out some delicately-made puff-paste, till about a quarter of an inch thick or a little less; cut it (for cocked hats) into squares with sides of five inches, put the jam in the centre, and fold the paste over it in a three-cornered shape, by joining two of the opposite angles; wet and press the edges down closely, and brush the surface of the puff over with white of egg, dusting powdered sugar over it while wet. Put the puffs upon a well-buttered baking-sheet, and bake them in a brisk oven. For oblong puffs, cut the pastry into a rectangular shape, five inches long and four wide, place the jam in the centre, fold the long sides together, wetting, and pinching them together securely, and press the extremities closely also : brush the puff over with egg white, dust it with sugar, and bake. Pistachio-nut puffs should be made in this way :â€” Weigh two ounces of pistachio-nuts (shelled) and pound them with a spoonful of rosewater, add two table- spoonfuls of finely-sifted sugar, two ounces of butter, the juice of a lime, and a table-spoonful of grated ratafias. When these are thoroughly mixed, add the beaten yolks of three eggs, and a coffee-cupful of cream. Mix tho- roughly and lay the mixture upon your paste, covering it as already described.To embellish the puffs, after they have been baked make a thin cement with the white of an egg and some finely powdered sugar, brush the surface of the paste with this, sprinkling over it immedi- ately some finely-chopped pistachio-nuts. Set in the oven for a few minutes to dry, the pieces of nut will adhere to the puff-paste, and, on account of their delicate green colour, materially improve the appearance of the puffs. * With this mixture excellent pistachio-nut cheese-cakes can 1 e made. A spoonful of liqueur or brandy is an improvement. Add grated if too fluid.

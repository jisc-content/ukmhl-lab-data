118 SWEET DISHES. the majority of cases, produced by the eggs which enter into the composition. Flour assists this, and some farina- ceous stuffs such as rice, sago, and tapioca are adhesive. Bread crumbs contribute to firmness in a minor degree. We know, for instance, that dumplings can be made without eggs, and that boiled rice will form in a mould of its own accord when cold. It is, therefore, very dangerous to alter the proportions of the ingredients laid down in a receipt without trial. By following the recipe before you accurately, and by weighing each ingredient carefully, you ought to be quite safe ; the only thing, indeed, in which error is possible, is the number of eggs. These, we all know, vary in size, the finest egg of the country hen cannot be reckoned as equal to the one mentioned in an English cookery book, while the ordinary bazaar-bought egg may be considered scarcely better than half its value. My personal experience is that no particular advantage is derived from flour in puddings. Bread or cake crumbs seem to me to be preferable without flour, because they certainly produce lighter puddings free from waxiness. Currants used in puddings must, of course, be picked, plunged into boiling water, drained, and rubbed in a well- floured cloth ; they should then be dried in the oven for a few minutes. The hot water bath not only cleans them after the picking, but it also “ plumps” them, i.e., causes them to swell. Raisins and prunes should be stoned, scalded, and dried in a floured cloth. Almonds should be blanched, peeled, scalded again, wiped with a clean cloth, and sliced or shredded with a sharp knife. In mixing bread-crumbs, pounded ratafias, and other biscuits, with the ingredients of a pudding, the eggs will generally be found quite sufficient for the moistening of the mass. Milk makes a pudding heavy.

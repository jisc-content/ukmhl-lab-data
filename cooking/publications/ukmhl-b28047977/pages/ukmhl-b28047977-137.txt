119 PUDDINGS. Use suet freshly purchased and clarified. Mutton suet may be employed ; some people, indeed, consider it better and lighter for puddings than beef; but via/rroto, when obtainable, is nicer than either. It is, on the whole, safer to moderate the allowance of sugar in a pudding than to act up to the full amount recommended in a recipe. It should be remembered, in addition to what I have already said, that some sugars are more effective than others ; and, if required, powdered loaf-sugar can always be handed round. You see people take powdered sugar with the sweetest plum-pudding; and the sauces which generally accompany puddings are full of syrup. There is yet another reason :—gentlemen, as a rule, dislike a very sweet pudding, and ladies seem to be less fond of them than they formerly were. For superior puddings it will be found decidedly advan- tageous to sprinkle the currants, raisins, citron, candied peel, &c., with a little brandy, rum, liqueur, or wine. Having cut up the fruij according to the directions that maj' be given, put the mince into a basin and stir it about with a silver fork as you add the wine or spirit little by little. Let it rest, and stir it well before adding it to the pudding the last thing. The eggs used in puddings should be as fresh and sweet as procurable. There is, I know, a saying among cooks to the effect that an egg, unfit to be sent to table boiled in its shell, is quite good enough for an omelette or a pudding. Buttermen at home sell “ cooking eggs ” in a class inferior to their “new laid,” or “breakfast eggs.” The idea is nevertheless an erroneous one. A pudding will be all the better if made with fresh eggs, and, to add to its lightness, it will be found a good thing to beat the yolks and whites separately, and strain them before mixing them with the pudding ingredients.

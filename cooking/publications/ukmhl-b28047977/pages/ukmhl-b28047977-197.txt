179 ON ICE-MAKING. very little ‘ spinach greening ’ should be added just before freezing, and a table-spoonful of maraschino may be with advantage added to the frozen custard just after the whipped cream is stirred in. In other respects the receipt for filbert ice should be followed. N.B.—In the absence of pistachio nuts, a very excellent imitation can be made with:—Four ounces of almonds, a tea-spoonful of vanilla essence, a table-spoonful of maraschino, and one of rose- water. Chestnut Cream also within our reach at Christmas time here, requires, for a pint, twenty good chestnuts. These should be skinned and turned into boiling water for five minutes, so that the brown skin may be peeled off easily. After that, just cover the nuts with weak syrup, give that a tea-spoonful of vanilla essence, and simmer until the nuts are quite soft: then drain, and pass them through the sieve, using a little rose-water, add to the paste so obtained a table-spoonful of maraschino, and then go on with a custard of eight yolks as prescribed for filbert ice. h 01 Cashu-nut cream proceed exactly as laid down for almond, not forgetting the rose-water during the pounding. To the nut paste, add a table-spoonful of maraschino, and a tea-spoonful of vanilla essence. Cream ices may be made of rich custard and flavoured with liqueurs only, as in the case already given of Creme au the : a liqueur-glass to the pint is enough. Liqueurs should not be added (except in the cases given with nut pastes) until freezing has been nearly completed; they must then be briskly worked into the almost frozen mixture after the whipped cream has been added. Ginger cream ice is made by adding sufficient syrup of preserved ginger to a plain custard to flavour it thoroughly. A little of the preserve, chopped small, should be added to the ice with the whipped cream.

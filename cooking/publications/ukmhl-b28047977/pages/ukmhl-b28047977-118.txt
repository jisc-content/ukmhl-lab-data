SWEET DISHES. 100 forcing bag and pipe to effect that object neatly: close the ends with fieurons of pastry, return the cannelons to the oven to finish baking, and, when done, serve them piled one on top of the other upon a napkin, and well-dusted with powdered loaf-sugar. Some cooks cut the paste into a long strip and fold it round the cane spirally, closing the twist with white of egg stiffened with a little sugar; and some make cannelons without the aid of the cane or stick; they cut the pastry into little parallelo- grams, two or three inches long, and one or one and a half inch wide; in the centre of these they put a dessert- spoonful of the confiture, then fold the paste over it, closing the ends and joining the sides securely, and roll the cannelons into form; this operation should be carefully manipulated. The cannelons may then be baked, or dipped into a bath of boiling fat and fried like rissoles. For Cannelons d’amandes follow the directions already given as regards the making of the pastry case; for the preparation to fill them, proceed as follows:—Blanch and peel half a pound of shelled almonds, and six bitter ones; pound them to a paste in a mortar with rosewater moist- ening them with the white of an egg ; when well-pounded, add four ounces of sugar, and three eggs,—one at a time,—mix well, and put the paste in a basin till required. Tarts:—The majority of our tarts in India must be composed of preserved fruit which is, of course, cooked to a certain extent before it is exported; hut this does not prevent the production of very good tarts if the pastry he well-made, and the syrup carefully attended to. The latter point is important. The only advantage gained by the use of fresh fruit is the extraction in the baking of the tart of the natural juice of the furit, which, with the sugar put in with it, forms a syrup. Now the liquid which

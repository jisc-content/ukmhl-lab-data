123 PUDDINGS. Puddings,—Class I, The puddings that I propose to consider in this class are those which require ingredients more or less expen- sive, such as wine or liqueur; candied peel or citron ; preserved dessert fruits, apricots, cherries, and greengages, cream ; a large number of eggs, and so forth. In many instances puddings belonging to this class can also be composed less expensively. Take, for instance, plum pudding, which, as all know, may be made according to numerous recipes varying in richness from the top to the bottom of the culinary scale. If, therefore, the receipts I am about to give appear too costly, remember that they are essentially dinner party entremets, and unless modified discretionally are not recommended for ordinary occasions at home. 1 Steamed, ’ ‘ boiled ’ or ‘ baked ’ will be inserted in each case after the name of the pudding to indicate, at a glance, how it is to be cooked. Cabinet pudding (Poucliny de cabinet) {steamed):— break the yolks of ten eggs into a bowl, beat them to- gether for a minute and add, while stirring, three ounces of sugar, and a pint and a quarter of boiled milk : turn this to a custard, and strain the mixture through a fine sieve into another basin. Let this get cold. Next stone two ounces of raisins; pick, wash, and dry one and a half ounces of currants; and cut up into dice three preserved apricots, and two ounces of crystallised cherries. Now, butter a plain charlotte mould, put a round of paper at the bottom of it, and arrange upon that a layer of the mixed fruit; over that, place a layer of the sliced sponge- cake, and continue the system of layers of fruit and cake, alternately, sprinkling each layer with liqueur, until the mould is three parts filled ; then pour in the cold custard slowly, let it soak into the cake, adding a little custard

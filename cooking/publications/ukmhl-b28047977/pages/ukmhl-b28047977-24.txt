IX. Jellies, ,THE commonest care, and the slightest attention to a few simple rules, will ensure success in mak- ing jellies. In order to obtain the limpidity and brightness which in certain jellies are by some considered indispensable, it is advisable to use a newly tinned utensil. An enamelled stewpan, or glazed earthenware casserole and a plated, or wooden spoon, may also be recommended. The ves- sels thus used should be kept separately, and used for sweets only. A flannel jelly bag was at one time considered an item of the equipment which we could not get on without, but practice has proved to me that it is far better to use pieces of new flannel that have been thoroughly scalded in boiling water. For after a little usage, bags become musty, and will taint a jelly most unpleasantly. The pieces of flannel can be relegated to the scullery for cleaning purposes after they have done their work in jelly- making, so there is no extravagance in my recommenda- tion. A line sieve (reserved entirely for sweets) over which the piece of flannel should be spread, will answer very well for the straining of the finest jelly that may be desired, while the sieve alone will do very well for semi- opaque and opaque jellies made of fruit syrups,purees, etc.

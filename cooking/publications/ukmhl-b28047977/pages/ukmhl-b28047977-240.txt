SWEET DISHES. 222 A Plain Plum cake for office:—One pound of flour, one tea-spoonful of Yeatman’s baking powder, six eggs— or seven if they are small—half a pound of butter and sugar, half a pound of currants and raisins mixed, two ounces of chopped citron or preserved ginger, a glass of fruity Madeira, and a salt-spoonful of salt. Beat up the eggs and sugar, and the flour by degrees, then the currants and raisins, the citron, and the wine, lastly the butter melted, finish with the baking powder and bake. Raisin cake:—A pound of butter, a pound of flour, and a pound of sugar : ten eggs, a table-spoonful of rose-water, a pound of well-stoned raisins, a salt-spoonful of salt, and one of baking powder. Beat the eggs, one by one, till very light, add the sugar, flour, and salt. Toss the raisins in dry flour, mix them into the cake, stir well, adding the butter melted and a glass of brandy. Put in the baking powder, and bake in moderate oven. Madeira cake :—Break ten eggs into a basin and beat them well: add nine ounces of sugar to the beaten eggs by degrees : stir in nine ounces of flour, continuing the whisk- ing throughout the process. Drop into the mixture a tea- spoonful of the essence of lemon and pour in nine ounces of butter melted until it is fluid. Have ready some finely-cut slices of citron, and stir them into the mixture, finishing off with a glass of brandy, sherry, or Madeira, and a tea-spoonful heaped up of baking powder. Butter a cake-tin, line it with buttered paper, arrange a star at the bottom of the tin out of strips of citron, and pour in the mixture. Time to bake, one hour. Let the oven be moderately heated. The great thing to remember in making a Madeira cake is continual whisking. The cook s arm should never rest during the composition. It is, therefore, essential that the ingredients be all weighed, portioned off and ready, before the mixing commences.

CAKES, ETC. 217 way, is frequently overdone : a little chopped preserved ginger is sometimes useful, but I would reserve grated ginger for ginger-cakes only. Really good citron is an excellent thing, and I think that prunes, stoned, and cut up into dice, add to the pleasant flavour of a cake. Small cakes require a quicker oven than large ones, but, in any circumstances, the oven should, as a rule, be far more moderate in temperature than our cooks think. How often are cakes burnt externally before they are done in the centre ? The charred crust can, of course, be rasped away, but such a course is very wasteful, and to be avoided, if possible. Let the oven be moderate in its heat, and then the centre of the cake will be baked well before the outside is burnt. Observation.â€”There is a thing of the utmost importance in connection with cake-baking that I must not forget to mention, viz., that it is a very capital plan to place several layers of paper, well oiled with salad oil at the bottom of the cake mould to begin with; and, when arranged satis- factorily, to put a wall of well-buttered white paper, pro- tecting the side of the tin, also; this should be allowed to extend beyond the top of the tin a couple of inches at least to support the cake when it rises. The object of the thick foundation of paper is obvious : it protects the bottom of the cake from burning, and is a very necessary precaution, for, of course, the heat of the oven strikes with greater severity at the bottom of the tin than at any other part. To test the baking of a cake, make a skewer of wood, and press it into the cake; if it come out clean, the cake is ready; if it bring out with it a coating of dough, the cake must be baked still longer. 14a

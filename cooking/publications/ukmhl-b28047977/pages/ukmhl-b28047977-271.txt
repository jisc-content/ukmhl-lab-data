APPENDIX, 253 spread the mixture out on a slab (which has been brushed over with melted butter) a quarter of an inch thick, mark it into oblongs of an equal size, and cut them out before the nougat gets cold. These little nougats make a nice dish for dessert or the buffet of a reception party. Nougat is also used to form a shell or case for whipped cream, but to make one of these is by no means easy, because the mixture hardens so soon that great dexterity and practice are necessary to effect the object neatly while the nougat is still pliable. A nougat case can be made in the same manner as a charlotte case, viz. :—A round piece cut to fit the bottom of the plain mould selected, and the sides arranged in panel, oblong strips of nougat being joined together like the cake strips in a charlotte with glace royale, and all fixed in the same way to the round piece at the bottom of the mould. This is obviously a troublesome and messy process and even a fairly good result is scarcely appreciated. Better surely it would be to make as many neat strips of nougat as may be required to form a circle round a compote dish. These might be cut two inches long, an inch and a half wide, and a quarter of an inch thick, and the arrangement effected in this way :—Make a slab of Genoise paste to fit the compote dish and about half an inch thick, glaze it over with apricot glaze, round the edge brush glace royale and with its assistance arrange the pieces of nougat overlapping each other, fill the centre of the dish with whipped cream flavoured as may be desired as for charlottes. This would be a creme fouet- / tee au nougat and much more negotiable in the matter of helping than a regular case which is often too hard to break with a spoon.

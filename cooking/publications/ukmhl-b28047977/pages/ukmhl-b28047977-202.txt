184 SWEET DISHES. stiff whipping of the component parts is necessary. Ac- cordingly, flavouring that can be communicated by essence may be mixed with the syrup ; praline and caramel may be whipped into the cream in the form of powder; fruit must be reduced to the consistence of thick puree, and then icing-sugar must be whisked into it over ice till it is stiff, when it can be blended with the whipped cream. Nuts must be pounded to a paste and this must be whisk- ed into the custard. Chocolate must be crushed to powder and moistened with syrup, being stirred well over ice during the process, and then, when thick, it must be whipped with the cream. Variously flavoured mousses can thus be made easily enough. The conical mould is the best for them. The parfait differs but slightly from the mousse, as will be seen in the following recipe for:— / Parfait au cafe :•—Choose a conical parfait mould, line it with wet paper and cover it with ice. Break ten yolks of eggs into a basin, mix them well, adding eight ounces of icing sugar ; work the ingredients till they are smooth ; moisten now, little by little, with two and a half gills of strongly-made black coffee ; next, putting the basin in a vessel of boiling water, turn the contents to a custard, using a whisk for the purpose. When nice and thick, remove the basin, and continue whisking as in the case of the appareil a mousse till it is cold, and then over ice till it is stiff; now add a pint and a half of stiffly-whipped cream, pass the whole into the cold mould, shaking it well home. Close this securely, bury it in well-salted ice, like the mousse, and keep it covered closely from the air for four hours, when it can be turned out and served. Other parfaits can obviously be made on these lines. The Bombe requires a dome-shaped mould, wide rather than long. It is made with au ordinary cream-ice and au

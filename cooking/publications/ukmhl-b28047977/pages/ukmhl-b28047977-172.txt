154 SWEET DISHES. the hollow made by the paste with fruit and sugar, moistening it with lime-juice, a little syrup, and a dash of any liqueur that may be open. This having been done (the fruit should fill the paste pretty closely), cut a circular piece of paste, the size of the bottom of the basin, lay it over the fruit and draw the edges of the lining paste over it, wetting and firmly pinching the two together.

The American canned apples and pears are to be strongly recommended to those who are fond of dumplings. Besides those made of fruit, there ai'e, of course,

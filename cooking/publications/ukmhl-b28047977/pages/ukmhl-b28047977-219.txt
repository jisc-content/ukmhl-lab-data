fruit preserving. 201 weight exactly of pounded sugar. Immerse the bowl in a stewpan, or other vessel containing boiling water, place the latter over a slow fire, and cover the howl of fruit closely. Let the water boil slowly, and keep the fruit covered until the juice is drawn out, and begins to thicken. Now, pass the contents of the pan through a new freshly scalded hair sieve into an enamelled pan, pressing the pulp through also, and then boil it, skimming off the scum ; when the surface is clear, let it get cold. When perfectly cold, put the whole strawberries into the syrup, with all their sugar, and replace the pan over a very low fire gently warming its contents ; when warm, stop ; cool the fruit, again warm it, and continue alternate cooling and .warming until it is clear. Let the warming be very gradual, and on no account let the syrup boil. If you perceive that the fruit has a tendency to break, remove the pan from the fire, and do not replace it until the contents have become perfectly cold. When the preserve seems nice and clear, you may wind the operation up by carefully placing it in the glass jars or pots you have prepared for it. In choosing the strawberries for this treatment it is obviously a wise thing to try and get them of an even size. If unequal in weight, the light ones will cook too soon and be inclined to break before the large ones are enough done. Another method, especially for dessert strawberries, may be followed in this manner. Choose glass bottles in which fruit in syrup has been imported. See that they are clean and dry. Select ripe, berries of a nice appear- ance, and take care that they are clean and dry. Then put them into the bottles, shaking them well down. Next pour into the bottles a syrup produced by boiling twelve ounces of sugar with three gills of water. Cork the bottles securely and put them into a bain-marie pan or stewpan 13a

When this has been done, remove the pan, cool the apple, and, while cooling, prepare, in a separate saucepan, the following mixture:— Two table-spoonfuls of apricot jam, one sherry-glass of rum, and the juice of a ripe lime ; stir over the fire just to melt the jam, and then add it to the cold apple. Some like a slight addition of powdered cloves or cinnamon. When well blended, add one by one, mixing the whole thoroughly, five yolks of egg; put this into a pie-dish lined with puff-paste, and hake in a moderate oven for half an hour.

For No. 2, a somewhat richer preparation is propound- ed, viz. :—To the same weight of apples, five ounces of butter and the yolks of six eggs, wfith the whites of three added just before baking: when the surface is firm, a layer of finely-grated ratafia crumbs is shaken over it, and then the melted butter. No. 3 is the plainer :—Prepare the apples as in the first case, but omit the apricot jam and rum, giving the mix- ture the lemon juice only, and adding three well-beaten eggs. Line the pie-dish wfith well-buttered slices of Madeira cake, pour in the apple mixture, cover the top with more buttered slices, and bake until lightly coloured in a very moderate oven. During the baking a little melted butter may he sprinkled over the top of the pud- ding, and powdered sugar should he dredged over it to finish with.

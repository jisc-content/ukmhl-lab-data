49 COLD SWEET ENTREMETS. pyramid shape may be more convenient, while pine-apple “chunks” can be built up in a square form. The glazing is only applied externally. The arrangement.—whatever it may be—should be made in the china or silver dish in which it is to be served, and this must be set in the ice box to become as cold as possible. When very cold, the syrup, also cold, should be poured very gently, and in very small quantities at a time so as to trickle over the fruit. The cold will gradually fix this upon the surface, and the glaze will be formed, coating the fruit evenly. For appearance sake the syrup may be golden apricot colour, or rosy with raspberry or strawberry. / V Fruits dores a la Malaise.—Following the directions just given a pretty dish for a dinner party can be composed as follows :—Choose a round dish eight or ten inches in diameter; cut a round slice of Madeira or Genoise cake three-quarters of an inch thick and place it on the dish. It should be an inch less in diameter than the dish. Butter well and fill with the same paste a dariole mould (sugar-loaf shape) three inches across the bottom, and three and a half high. Bake, cool and turn this out, setting it in the centre of the round, and fixing it firmly to the latter with cook’s cement of sugar and white of egg. Pass a thin coating of syrup glaze over all, smoothing it with a palette-knife dipped in hot water, and then decorate with fruit by laying slabs of pine-apple cut in oblongs round the dariole, a ring of half apricots or peaches closely overlapping each other round the base, and a ring of glacbs cherries round the outside edge of the circle. If the top of the dariole has been hollowed with a cutter, it can be filled with a pyramid of the cherries. All having been arranged, and set in the ice-box to get as cold as possible, finish by glazing the whole as in fruits dores. Whipped cream may accompany this. 4

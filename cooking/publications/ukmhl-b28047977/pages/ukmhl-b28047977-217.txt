FRUIT FEU! SERVING. 199 aucl encourage the revival of a very useful item of house- keeping economy, I propose now to give the general rules to be followed in fruit preserving and a few simple recipes suitable to fruit procurable in India. ♦—— Rules to be observed in fruit preserving. 1. Let everything connected with the operation be as clean and dry as possible :—The fruit, vessels, and jars or pots, as the case may be. 2. If you have neither a copper nor a brass preserving- pan, use an enamelled iron, not a tinned utensil. 3. Use wooden, enamelled or silver-plated spoons, not iron or tinned iron. 4. It is by far the best economy to use the best sugar. Inferior sugar throws up a quantity of scum which is wasted ; the colour produced by it is dark, and its power as a sweetening agent is poor in proportion to its quality. 5. The bottom of a vessel used for preserving should not rest on the fire for the fruit nearest the heat is apt to catch at the bottom and burn, thus spoiling the whole contents of the pan. It is accordingly necessary to have a common iron rest or trivet made to raise the vessel an inch or so above the glowing charcoal. 6. Skim most carefully while the fruit is boiling, and stir after the sugar has been put in without ceasing. 7. Loaf sugar, broken rather small, about the size of a large pea, is better than Caster or powdered sugar which makes the jam too thick. 8. Follow the recipes carefully, for the processes vary according to the kind of preserve required.

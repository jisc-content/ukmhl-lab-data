COLD SWEET ENTREMETS. 51 Assuming that a fruit compote will often be required, perhaps a list of a few nice ones may be found useful:— i. Compote de peches (peaches), au marasquin. ii. Compote de reines-olaude (greengages), au Benedictine. iii. Compote de Agues (figs), au kirsch. iv. Compote de pruneaux (prunes), au Bordeaux. v. Compote d’abricots (apricots), au noyeau. vi. Compote de poires (pears), au zeste d’oranges. vii. Compote de pommes (apples), au rhum. viii. Compote de cerises (cherries), au kirsch. ix. Compote d’ananas (pine-apple), au pouehe. x. Compote d’oranges (oranges), au curacoa. xi. Compote de fruits assortis (mixed fruits). xii. Compote de bananes au zeste d’oranges. Among these compotes a liqueur flavouring predomi- nates, but it should be understood that I have no desire to insist upon this. The syrups may be perfumed with vanilla, lemon, almond, ratafia, &c., or plainly acidulated with lime-juice filtered. A little consideration will enable the mistress of the house to settle the question. The last compote in my list may be taken in illustration of a non- alcoholic one. Compote de bananes au zeste d’oranges:—Make a pint of clear syrup as already described. Put it in a clean enamelled stewpan on the fire, and as it heats up prepare ten plantains by peeling them, scraping off the fibre that may adhere to them and cutting them in halves lengthwise. When the syrup boils, slip in the pieces of banana, with- draw the stewpan at once, and let the fruit get cold in it: when cool, add the finely cut rind of two oranges and their juice filtered through paper. Finally, arrange the bananas in a china dish laid upon ice, pour the syrup over them picking out the orange peel which, remember, should have been left in the syrup half an hour to extract the flavour. Those who like to do so can add a liqueur glass of curacoa which “marries well” with oranges, but this is a mere suggestion.

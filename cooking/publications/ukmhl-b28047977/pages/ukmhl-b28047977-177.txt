PUDDINGS. 159 golden colour. The pudding can now he served. Pud- dings of this description are very apt to burn. Accordingly care is necessary in regard to the condition of the oven. Catching at the bottom of the dish may be prevented by setting it upon a wire drainer, or raising it above the oven floor on a small wooden frame, or trivet. A few notes as to proportions may be useful:â€” Four ounces of rice will absorb a pint of milk if put in cold and cooked slowly. In this condition it is, of Gourse, most nourishing and wholesome: the addition of milk in the pie-dish produces the milkiness required, for the rice has already swelled, and assimilated all the milk it can retain. Mrs. Roundell s method should be carefully con- sidered Put four ounces of rice into a jar with a pint of milk, closely cover the jar (with a screw top, if possible), and place it in a pan of boiling water, continuing the boiling until the rice is quite tender. Examine occa- sionally to assure yourself of this, and give the rice a stirring. About an hour and a half will be needed for this process. The rice is now ready for the pie-dish to be finished as in the first recipe. Sago can be treated like rice, as it possesses about the same power of absorption, four ounces to the pint of milk. To produce a milky sago, the recipe for milky rice should be followed. Tapioca lends itself to similar treatment after the preliminary crushing and preparation mentioned already (page 42). Vermicelli and spaghetti make excellent milky puddings if cooked, to begin with, until tender in fast boiling water or milk and water for about twenty mintes, After this they should be treated as the rice in the first recipe.

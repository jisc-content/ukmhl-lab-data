ON ION-MAKING. 169 salt, and lay a cloth over it to expel the air ; open the pot which should project some inches above the top of the pail, wipe it carefully with a clean cloth, and, having dosed it again, leave it to get thoroughly cold—say, for a quarter of an hour. It should then be opened, and the composi- tion to be frozen should be poured into it. And here it should be noted that the latter should never more than half-fill the freezer. Secure the top firmly, and turn the pot x-apidly backwards and forwards for five minutes. Now remove the top, and with your pewter spatula detach the portion of the mixture that you will find frozen, and adhering to the sides of the pot. Work the mixture about as quickly and as thoroughly as you can, and then replace the cover, and continue the turning. At intervals of five minutes a similar process should be followed; good freezing, remember, depends upon the frequent use of the spatula. At the end of half an hour, if treated as I have described, the mixture will be evenly set, and perfectly free from lumps. As soon as the ice has been thus com- pleted, the cover should be firmly put on again, and the whole of the top of it covered with some broken ice with a piece of coarse flannel or jhool-stuff laid over it. A properly made ice should be thoroughly smooth, and of the same consistence throughout. This effect is pro- duced by the aforesaid continual use of the spatula. Unless the pewter spoon be rapidly used and the gradu- ally frozen portion of the mixture frequently detached from the sides of the pot and amalgamated with the unfrozen part, uneven freezing will be the certain result, and worse—the part of the ice adhering to the side of the pot will be over-frozen like stone and be most difficult to detach. The method of freezing with a “ Paragon ” machine is clearly described in a paper accompanying it, 11a

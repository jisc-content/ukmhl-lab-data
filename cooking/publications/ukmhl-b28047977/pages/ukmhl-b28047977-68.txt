SWEET DISHES. 50 Compotes of fruit form almost a section by themselves among cold sweet dishes, nevertheless, if you know how to compose one or two of them, you can, with a little discrimination regarding flavours, and the amount of sweetness to allow for different fruit, be pretty sure of success with the whole category. In India, with the ex- ception of a few kinds of fruit procurable only in special localities, the cooking of the fruit for compotes need scarcely be considered, for the excellent preserved fruits of America, our Colonies, and France provide what we require ready made. The preparation of the syrup, however, is a different matter, while the flavouring is also a thing apart. The former has just been explained and need not be repeated. It should be noted, however, that for a superior compote a clear syrup is essentially necessary. Flavouring may be imparted in various ways :â€”by infusion, by essences, by juices, by wines, and by liqueurs. By the first process the perfume of orange, lime and citron can be obtained. Pare, as finely as possible, the outside of the rind with a sharp knife, excluding carefully all white which gives out a bitter taste, and put the parings into the prepared syrup; let them macerate for twenty-five minutes, and then strain off the syrup. Essences can, of course, be purchased. Lime and orange juice should be filtered through prepared paper which can be got at the chemists, and the juices of fruits drawn by gentle simmering can be strained through a fine hair sieve. The flavouring with wine or liqueur is easy enough. If reserved for addition till the last thing, a very little will suffice for a compote. Having got the syrup satisfactorily clear, the selection of fruit and flavouring ought not to be difficult. Cream whipped or iced may or may not accompany a compote according to taste, a sauce mousseuse (see Chapter III) or o-ood custard will often suffice when cream is scarce. O

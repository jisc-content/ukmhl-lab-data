5 EQUIPMENTS AND MATKRIALS. dusting of caster sugar never fails to attract the eye plea- singly. A sweet dish garnished with crystallized sugar may look fairly well, but the effect upon the teeth is far from pleasant. That the best milk and cream should be used need scarcely be said: those who keep cows of their own possess an incalculable advantage in this important par- ticular, for of course purchased milk is too often very poor in quality. People who desire to excel in their entremets sucres must admit of a little extravagance in the matter of eggs. The poverty of the milk aforesaid demands it, and the eggs themselves cannot be counted as equal to those of the European market. In following an English receipt in which two eggs are entered, it would be wise to use three in India, and if eight be named, I would issue twelve or fourteen, according to size. My recipes are composed in pursuance of this scale. Be very careful in having the best imported flour, and dry and sift it well before using it; the cleverest cook will fail to turn out good puff-paste with indifferent flour. .

By carefully reading a receipt and thinking over the ingredients that compose it, you ought, in nine cases out of ten, to be able to decide whether the wine can be omitted or not. I generally mention in my recipes whether the liqueur, etc., is really indispensable. Wine, as a rule, is, however, such a vast improvement when used in puddings, etc., that it seems a pity to leave it out, especially when the quantity recommended rarely exceeds a glass.

127 PUDDINGS. As in the previous recipe, the pudding ingredients may be reduced one-half, and instead of the cream, fresh milk, or milk and cream combined, may be employed. Fig-pudding (Ponding aux figues) (boiled) :—For this take six ounces of bread-crumbs, eight ounces of suet chopped very small indeed, and half a pound of dried figs cut into little pieces; mix these well together with five well beaten eggs, a quarter of a pound of sugar, and the zest and juice of two limes ; finally give it a pinch of grated nutmeg, salt and a glass of rum.

Note.—A fig pudding may be served ‘ on fire ’like a Christmas pudding.

Stone the raisins, wash, pick and dry the

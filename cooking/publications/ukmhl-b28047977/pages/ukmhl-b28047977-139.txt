It is advisable to protect puddings of this kind by laying a sheet of buttered paper over their surfaces as soon as they begin to colour. The lightness of baked batter puddings is assisted by adding the firmly whipped whites of the eggs used in their making at the last moment before baking ♦ PROCESS III.—STEAMING.

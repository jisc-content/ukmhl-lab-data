SWEET DISHES. 90 Apple cheese-cakes are simple :—Pare and core six ap- ples, or take six dessert-spoonfuls of apple jam, or a dozen pieces of apples in syrup. If the apples be raw, you must boil, or bake them, and then mash them very smooth : stir in the juice of three ripe limes, the yolks of four eggs, and two ounces of butter. If the apples be fresh, you must sweeten them ; if preserved, the mixture will be sweet enough without sugar: beat the mixture to a cream, and pour it into your patty pans, lined with puff-paste, as in the foregoing recipe. Lemon cheese-cake mixture should be made in this way :—Melt two ounces of butter, and stir two ounces of sugar into it; when dissolved, add the juice of two or three ripe limes; mix all well together and pour it into your pattv-pans. Another recipe runs as follows :—Half pound of sugar beaten with four eggs (leaving out the whites of two of them), the juice of three limes, and two ounces of butter: put all these ingredients into a stewpan, and stir them until they are as thick as honey, add a couple of spoonfuls of any liqueur, and fill the patty-pans. An excellent variety of cheese-cake is that served under the title of Rice cheese-cake :—Two ounces of best table l’ice, four ounces of fresh butter, four ounces of sugar, the peel of a lime, four eggs, a coffee-cupful of cream, a spoon- ful of orange-flower water, and a liqueur glass of maraschino or any liqueur that may lie available. When the ingredi- ents have been collected, proceed as follows :—Wash, pick, and boil the rice until it is tender, drain it: when free from water, pass it through your sieve, put it into an enamelled pan, and stir into it the butter, sugar, cream, and orange- flower water; add the eggs well-beaten, and mix all together, stirring over the fire till it is thick; then remove the pan, and let it get cool.

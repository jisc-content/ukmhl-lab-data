ON ICE-MAKING. 173 effort is made by the confiseur to captivate the eyes as well as the palates of his patrons. To produce this laud- able effect, vegetable colours—as perfectly innocuous as they are attractive—are now manufactured, Paris being the head-centre of the industry. Provided with these dyes, the confectioner can exercise his artistic taste as well as his culinary ingenuity, and accomplish the most pleasing varieties of colour. Those, however, who are not able to obtain Parisian colours can tint their ices very nicely with prepared cochineal, spinach greening, and fruit juices. Chocolate gives a rich brown, and coffee a pleasant light brown. If judiciously used, the ice-maker will find these materials effective enough for all ordinary purposes. In applying colours, however, we ought not to think of their effect upon the eye alone. We should endeavour to give a separate flavour with each tint. That is to say, it would be unscientific were we to make a quart of vanilla cream-ice, and having tinted half of it pink, to turn out a mould of ice, half pink and half cream-coloured, but uni- formly flavoured with vanilla. The consequence is that, if obedient to the strict rules of ice-making, the composi- tion of a parti-coloured ice necessitates double work, for each ice must be made separately, both as regards colour and flavour. Another thing to note is that a bi-coloured or tri-coloured ice can scarcely be made with any degree of economy for a small party. You cannot well make less of each sort than three-quarters of a pint, and it is often troublesome to make less than a pint. It is there- fore advisable to reserve such compositions for parties of not less than ten or twelve people. The combination of tints and flavours is not a difficult task the pale creamy tint of almond, or vanilla cream, contrasts well with the delicate pink of strawberry ; or

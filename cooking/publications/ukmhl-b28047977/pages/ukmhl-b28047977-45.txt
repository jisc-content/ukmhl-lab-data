27 CUSTARDS AND CREAMS. The Bavaroise is a dish in which cream and jelly are associated together, the mould being lined with jelly first, and the cream set within the lining. To line a mould proceed in this way. Having prepared half a pint of jelly ready for setting—it can be flavoured according to desire of course—put the mould after dipping it in water in a basin with crushed ice all round it. When it is very cold take it out, holding it with a cloth, and pour liquid jelly into it at once, turning the mould round so that the jelly may run over its inner surface, and become set by contact with the cold mould. If the coating seems too thin replace the mould in ice, and lay over the first layer a second one of the jelly operating in exactly the same way and returning the mould to its bed of ice. The cream, separately prepared, should now be poured into the cavity, and when turned out will be found to be enveloped in a casing of jelly.

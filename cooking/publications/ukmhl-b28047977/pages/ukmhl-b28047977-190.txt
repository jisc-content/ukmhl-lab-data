172 SWEET DISHES. work. As a rule an ice mixture, slightly over-sweetened when in its fluid state, will be found correct when frozen. Common white sugar can, of course, be used, but the true confectioner uses a made-syrup for this part of the opera- tion prepared as follows :— Clarified Sugar for iGes.—Take six pounds of good white sugar and put it into an enamelled pan, or an un- tinned copper boiler. Beat up the whites of four eggs with a pint of water, and pour the mixture over the sugar. Put the pan on the fire, and stir the sugar about with a wooden spoon until it rises ; then add cold water, and repeat the process every time the sugar rises until a pint of water has been so expended. By the time the whole pint has been poured in, the sugar will cease to rise, and a brown scum will form on the surface of the syrup. Skim this off carefully, and then strain the liquid through a piece of muslin. After this, return the syrup to the pan, and let it come to the boil, then remove it, let it get cool, and pour it into bottles for use. Syrup thus treated will mark from 30° to 32° when tested by the saccharo- meter, which is the measure of sweetness propounded by Gouffe for ice-making. The syrups, specially prepared for ices that are now sold by all oilman’s stores merchants, facilitate ice-making very materially, for independently of their being correctly sweetened, they are flavoured with fruit and prettily tinted. For another rather simpler method of clarifying sugar, see page 46. Talking of tinting I must not omit a few words con- cerning that important item in ice-making. Whether served at dessert, or as an C'litievicts ancitij an ice is nothing if it be not nice to look upon. Pale lemon yellow is accordingly contrasted with rose pink; delicate green with warm chocolate brown, or colder buff', and every

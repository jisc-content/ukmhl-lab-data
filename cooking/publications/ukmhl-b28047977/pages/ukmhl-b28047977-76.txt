SWEET DISHES 58 each fritter is clone, it is laid upon the wire net, is drained for a few minutes, and then dished. The drainer is sometimes set in the oven for a few moments to dry fried things before dishing them, it is very useful for draining fried fish, and is well worth the trouble of making on the score of cleanliness. Following all the instructions that have been given, the making of Beignets sucres or plain sweet fritters will be found simple. These may he flavoured in many ways :â€”by adding a flavouring essence to the batter, by mixing with it the zest and juice of an orange or lime, or by stirring in at the last moment a table-spoonful of liqueur, rum, or brandy. Having prepared this as may be desired, put the bowl containing it as close to the frying kettle as possible on one side, and arrange the drainer on the other. Put the kettle containing the fat over the fire, and beat it gradually. When assured by testing it that the tem- perature of the bath is correct, place your frying basket therein and cast a table-spoonful of the batter into the fat spreading it out as much as possible. On touching the heated liquid the batter will blister up and assume grotesque shapes: fan the fire steadily: then, as soon as it turns the rich golden tint you desire, raise the fritter from the bath, hold it in the basket over the kettle for a moment or two to drain, and then turn it out upon the wire drainer, so that the fat may drain off thoroughly. Continue the process, spoonful after spoonful, until the batter is finished and the draining also. Dish in a hot silver dish and dust over the pile of fritters a delicate frosting of powdered loaf sugar, and serve quickly. A nap- kin, tastefully folded or neat dish paper should be placed

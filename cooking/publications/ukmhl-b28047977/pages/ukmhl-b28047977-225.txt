207 FRUIT PRESERVING. throwing each quarter into the bowl of lime-water as soon as it is ready. This will prevent the discoloration of the fruit. When all the guavas have been thus prepared, take them out of the water, and place them in an enamelled pan, covering them with the lime-water. That is to say, pour in enough water to cover the fruit, and no more. Boil until the fruit is broken, but not exactly pulpy, then turn it out upon a fine sieve, or into a large jelly bag, and let every drop of liquid drain from the fruit. It is essen- tial that the draining should be left to itself : no assist- ance in the form of squeezing or pressure should be given during the process. It will take a considerable time to effect this draining satisfactorily. When drained, weigh, and return the juice to the preserving pan. Boil again, adding, by degrees, broken loaf-sugar at the rate of twelve ounces per pound of juice. Lime-juice, at the rate of ten limes to a hundred fine guavas, may now be added. Care- ful skimming is now most necessary, and when no more scum rises, and the jelly is quite clear, pour it while it is warm into an enamelled bowl, and if no signs of ferment- ation are observed after twenty-four hours, the preserve may be potted. A hundred good guavas ought to yield a nice quantity of jelly. Guava Cheese:â€”Proceed just as if you were going to make jelly, but save the pulp from which you strained the juice. After having strained the juice, save about a thud of it, and take the other two-thirds for jelly, pro- ceeding as already described. For the cheese, put all the pulp into the pan again, and moisten it with the portion of the juice that you kept back ; stir the fruit about in the pan well, adding to each pound eight ounces of sugar, and a sherry-glass of lime-juice ; boil this well, skimming and stirring and gradually reducing until it assumes the consistence of marmalade, then turn the contents of the pan out upon a sieve, and press the fruit through it with

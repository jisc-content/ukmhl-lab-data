23 CUSTABD8 AND CREAMS. But a better way to extract the flavour of coffee is as follows :—Roast a quarter of a pound of coffee berries and empty them, hot, into a bowl containing a pint of boiling milk just taken from the fire; let them infuse (as in making tea) for an hour, in the ordinary tem- perature of a warm kitchen, with a plate laid over the top of the bowl : then strain, add the yolks, and proceed as already described. For Chocolate custard the process is similar. Dis- solve six ounces of grated chocolate in a little hot water, with a tea-spoonful of vanilla essence, and, when melted, stir it into a pint of hot milk ; add the yolks of six eggs, sweeten, thicken, and strain. The thickening should be conducted as already laid down. Note.—If sweetened chocolate flavoured with vanilla is used, the sugar and flavouring must be regulated accordingly. Caramel custard.—This flavouring is easily got by melting two ounces of icing sugar in a small glazed earthenware casserole or new-tinned iron saucepan over a low fire, stirring patiently till the colour becomes a rich deep brown. If poured out upon a marble slab this will at once become as hard and brittle as glass and can be lifted by the palette-knife and pounded in a mortar to powder in which form it can be stirred into the custard. Praline or Burnt Almond custard is flavoured in a yery similar manner:—Melt three ounces of icing sugar in the same way as for caramel, adding to it two ounces of finely minced sweet almonds. Let the sugar turn to caramel, and then empty the mixture upon the marble slab, detaching it when firm and pounding it as in the foregoing case. Be very particular in both cases to work patiently over a low fire, if not the sugar may suddenly turn black, burn, and be spoilt,

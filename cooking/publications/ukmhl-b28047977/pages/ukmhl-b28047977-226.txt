•208 SWEET DISHES. a wooden spoon, catching up the seeds. Fill your jars with the cheese while it is warm, and, when it has settled down, cover them in the usual manner. Note here that the thrifty house-keeper should make jelly and cheese out of one lot of fruit, for she can make the former, as we have seen, out of two-thirds of the strained juice first, and then, with one-third reserved, she can turn the pulp of the fruit to advantage by converting it into cheese. Mango Jelly:—This jelly should be made of sliced mangoes of a good grafted variety nearly, but not quite ripe. Peel and slice them, proceeding after that exactly as laid down for Cape gooseberry jelly, but use a pound of sugar to a pound of juice. By amalgamating the pulp with some of the juice, and then reducing it, a nice cheese or mar- malade can be produced. Pine-apple Preserve:—Pare off the rough outside of the pines, and cut them into half-inch squares one-third of an inch thick, picking out the seeds and eyes, and carefully removing all bruises. The fruit should be quite ripe, but not “ on the turn ” as cooks say. To each pound of pine- apple allow twelve ounces of sugar, and a tea-cupful of water. Turn this to a syrup, and, when it is perfectly clear, put it with the cut up pine-apple into the preserving pan, and stew gently until the fruit is quite soft, and looks transparent.

Cut them in cube shapes, one and three-quar- ters of an inch long, three-quarters of an inch deep, and the same in width. Pine-apples, if perfectly ripe, may be preserved in syrup in the manner described for bottled strawberries. Let

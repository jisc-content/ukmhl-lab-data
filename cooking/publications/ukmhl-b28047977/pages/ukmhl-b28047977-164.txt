SWEET DISHES. 146 turned out. To satisfy this condition it is accordingly necessary to reduce the fruit to the consistence of marmalade by following this process to begin with :— Mince the apples after peeling and coring them quite small (say, three pounds, in order to fix a standard) and put this into a stewpan with five ounces of butter melted, eight ounces of pounded sugar, and the juice of two limes. Work this with a wooden spoon over a fattish fire without ceasing until it is reduced by the evaporation of the fruit juice to the condition indicated. Do not let it burn, and add a quarter of its bulk of apricot marmalade or jam. Let it get cold. When cold fill the mould carefully, disturbing the casing of buttered bread as little as possible, and finishing with the piece of bread previously prepared. Bake it in a moderate oven, head downwards, for twenty-five or thirty minutes. Before turning the Charlotte out, lay the mould on its side in a dish, so that the superfluous butter, melted in the baking, may drain off': serve with a liberal dusting of powdered sugar. Charlottes can he made of preserved apples, but the process of reduction must nevertheless be carried out to expel wateriness, and this refers to all fruits which may be used for Charlottes, whether fresh or preserved. During the cooking a sprinkling of rum or liqueur may be added if liked. The plantain being somewhat dry naturally does not require much exhaustion, but it should be minced and stirred over the fire with the apricot jam or marmalade and the butter until well blended. It should be noted, with reference to uncooked apples, that fruit of close grain like russets or Ribston pippins make better Charlottes than the looser woolly sorts, because they are less watery.

PUDDINGS. 125 Provided that the principles that have been carefully laid down are carried out, you can, of course, accommodate your ingredients to your resources and make a capital home or nursery cabinet pudding with bread instead of cake, and ordinary custard flavoured with vanilla or almond essence, and some currants and raisins. Yienna pudding (Pawling d la Victimise) (steamed):— Twelve ounces of stale sjionge or Madeira cake cut into oblongs, two glasses of fruity Madeira, the rind of two limes very finely peeled and minced, two ounces of sweet almonds (shelled), and half an ounce of bitter ditto, minced small, six ounces of raisins, and a burnt sugar (caramel) custard made of six yolks, three gills of milk and one of cream and two ounces of burnt sugar; the whole sweet- ened with three ounces of sugar. Proceed with the milk, cream, eggs, and burnt sugar to make a pint and a half of caramel custard (page 23), sweeten this with the extra sugar. Let this get cold. Piepare a quart mould as explained for cabinet pudding, fill it in the same way with the cake, almonds, and raisins, sprinkling every layer with the Madeira; finally pour in the cola custard very gently, cover the exposed end of the mould with buttered paper, and steam the pudding gently as explained already. This may be served hot or cold. For Yiennoise sauce:—Put an enamelled saucepan into your bain-marie, containing the following the yolks of two—or, if small, of three—eggs, an ounce of fresh butter, an ounce of caramel sugar, and a two gills of milk ; stir the mixture briskly as it gradually becomes hot and thickens ; lastly, stir into it a wine-glass of Maderia, and pour it over the pudding. The proportions given for this pudding and sauce may be 1 educed exactly one-half for a small dinner.

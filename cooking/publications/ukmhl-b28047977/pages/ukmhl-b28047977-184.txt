166 SWEET DISHES. Spaghetti:—Butter a plain mould and decorate it as in the foi’egoing, if desired. Weigh four ounces of spaghetti, vermicelli or macaroni, prepare it exactly like the rice, as explained above, and finish in the same manner. Sago and tapioca may also be similarly treated. Served cold, these puddings are very nice with stewed fruit, jam, or fruit syrups. Cocoanut rice-pudding:—For this it is necessary to prepare by infusion a strongly-flavoured cocoanut milk as in curry-making, substituting milk for water, and pouring a pint and a half of boiling milk into a bowl upon plenty of freshly-grated nut, allowing it to infuse for half an hour, or until the milk is cold. Then strain the milk, pressing out all moisture from the cocoanut into it. Now put two ounces of cleansed rice into the milk, bring slowly to the boil, and then simmer till the grains are soft. Again let the contents of the pan get cold, sweeten with an ounce and a half of sugar, sharpen with lime juice and zest, and beat into the mixture, one by one, four whole eggs and an ounce of butter. Put this into a well-buttered mould, decorated or not, as may be liked, and steam for one hour very gently. Cocoanut, sago, tapioca, or vermicelli, may be made on the same lines. N.B.—Remember that before being turned out of their moulds, all steamed puddings should be given a few minutes to set on being taken out of the vessel in which they have been cooked. If turned out immediately they frequently bulge, and spread themselves out in the dish in an unsightly manner.

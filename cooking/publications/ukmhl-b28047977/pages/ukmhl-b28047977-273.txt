APPENDIX. 255 Tipsy pudding with apricots :—Cut a stale Madeira cake into slices half an inch thick and with them line the bottom of a large glass compote dish, tipsify them with a syrup made as follows :—One gill of water, two and a half ounces of sugar, one sherry glass of rum, one claret glass of marsala, and the juice of a good lime. Let this soak in, and then spread a layer of apricot jam over the surface. Open a tin of American apricots and drain off the syrup ; sprinkle some of the rum and wine used in the syrup over the fruit and keep it on a dish ready. Make a pint of rich custard, flavour it with vanilla and add to it an ounce of dissolved gelatine. When this is cold, set the dish on ice and pour half a pint of the custard over the cake and jam, letting it set by degrees. When at length the cake, &c., is firmly congealed in custard, lay over its surface a layer of apricots rounded side uppermost. Pour more custard over the apricots, and let it consolidate. Garnish the surface with whipped cream, and serve straight from the ice. Notr.—This a good way of using a stale cake and some apricots which may be over from some other meal. Any other fruit may he used in this manner. Trifle:—The old-fashioned recipes for this dish were from the modern standpoint far too 1 travailles ’ as French cooks say—overwrought with process and ingredients— rich custard, rich syllabub and cream to boot with lavish tipsifving. The directions I am about to give will be found much simpler without sacrificing the general effect of the dish :— As in the case of the tipsy pudding, a cake foundation should be laid at the bottom of a compote with crumbled stale cake, grated macaroons and ratafias, two parts of the first and one part each of the other two. This should be quite an inch deep, and among the crumbled cake, pistachio nuts and almonds blanched and peeled should be scattered.

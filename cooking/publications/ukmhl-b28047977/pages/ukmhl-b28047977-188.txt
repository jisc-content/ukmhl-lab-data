170 SWEET DISHES. Moulding is, of course, the process by which the ice,— frozen en masse in the freezing pot,—is transferred to an ornamental or plain vessel for the purpose of acquiring a definite shape before being sent to table. This operation is obviously unnecessary when the ice is served in glasses, or simply handed round upon plates : the frozen mixture can then be kept in the freezer, and helped directly therefrom. Hermetically closing ice-moulds are of course necessary for moulding. These, thoroughly clean, must be filled closely with the frozen mixture which, to insure a neat appearance without crevices, should not be too firmly frozen. When the ice has been pressed and shaken well home in the mould, the closely fitting cover must be put on, and to prevent the possible taint of salt getting in through the joining, additional security should be obtained by fixing a band of paste round it. Another plan is to put a band of thin paper round the rim of the mould, and press the cover down enclosing the paper, then to smear the joining itself externally with fat, which, of course, excludes all moisture from entering the mould. This is wiped carefully off before taking off the cover. In turning an ice out of a mould it is only necessary to dip the vessel in water at the ordinary temperature: violent efforts to expel an ice from its covering should be inter- dicted, for the result is often a “ heap of ruins.” The foundation of so-called cream -ices, and iced-puddings is a well made custard of fresh milk and eggs, to which a small quantity of plain cream is added towards the end of the operation. Turn to page 25 for some remarks upon this subject. The process may be thus defined. First a very rich custard, flavoured according to desire, sweetened, and whipped when cold as hereafter explained: then the

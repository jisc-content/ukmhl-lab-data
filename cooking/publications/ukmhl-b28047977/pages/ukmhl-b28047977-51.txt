. c OHAPTER IV. 4. Cold Sweet Entremets. rp^AVING considered the composition of creams, jellies, blanc-mangers, etc., the next step to take will be the working out of a few recipes for cold dishes in which those preparations play an important part. Orleans Pudding (Crime, d /’Orleans):—Make a pint and a half of really rich custard flavoured with vanilla; stir into the custard whilst hot an ounce and a half of dissolved gelatine; when thoroughly mixed, strain the whole through a fine sieve. Have ready an ounce of candied orange peel, an ounce of candied citron cut into dice, an ounce of currants, and an ounce of raisins, care- fully cleaned, picked, and cut up: stir the fruits thus prepared over a very gentle fire with just enough rum to moisten them, let them absorb the spirit, then remove the pan. Having thus prepared the custard and fruit, open a tin of ratafias and grate enough of them to produce four ounces of powdered crumbs ; put your mould in ice as if for a jelly, and pack it in this manner :—First a layer of the custard, then, as soon as that is firm, a layer of the minced fruit, over that a layer half an inch thick of crushed ratafias, settingeach of the layers firmly by gradual additions of cust ird. When they are set satisfactorily, repeat the process—a layer of fruit, and one of crushed ratafias, set in custard,—until the mould is quite full- then leave it in the ice till wanted. 3

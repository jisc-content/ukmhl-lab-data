67 FRITTERS. Fritters can be made of stale cake and, as I have said, of cold plum-pudding. Assuming that you have a diy piece of cake left, and that you want an easily made sweet dish, proceed in this way :—cut the cake into slices, and divide the slices into convenient pieces for fritters, two inches long, three-quarters of an inch wide, and half an inch deep. Tipsify them with any wine you like, or with brandy, liqueur, or rum ; let them dry thoroughly, then dip them into frying batter made in the way already given, and fry a golden yellow : serve on a napkin, after draining carefully, followed by the dusting of powdered sugar. In the case of plum-pudding, the process is the same exactly. Beignets de macarons (Macaroon fritters):—Break up and soak four ounces of macaroons in half a pint of milk. Stir gently over a low fire to reduce the former to the consistence of porridge. Take off the fire and add four eggs and mix well over the fire again to thicken as in custard-making, keeping the mixture from boiling care- fully. , When nice and thick, turn it out on a buttered dish and having formed it with a wooden spoon about an inch thick, let it get cold. Finish as explained for custard fritters. 7 A / Croutes Dorees (French roll fritters) Easp the outer film of crust from a French roll, cut it crosswise into rounds three-eighths of an inch thick, lay these out on a dish and haste them with custard flavoured and sweet- ened as may be liked. Let the pieces of roll absorb the custard and remain marinading for ten or twelve minutes, then gently press out the moisture, dip them in beaten egg, roll them in biscuit raspings or grated ratafias, and fry fast in very hot fat; when of the right colour, drain, dry, and serve smothered with sifted sugar. Lastly, we come to fritters in which pastry is emploved.

BRITTERS. 59 in the silver dish to receive the fritters in the first instance. Noth.â€”All fritters should be served as quickly as possible, for of course, their crispness will decrease as they grow at all cold. Dishes containing them should not be covered, for the steam rising from them would have the effect of moistening and spoiling them. Fruit fritters, if carefully made, are always appreciated. The method of cooking them is, in principle, exactly that which I have just described. The treatment of the fruit, however, must be considered. All fruit intended to be cooked in fritters should be perfectly ripe, or stewed until quite tender. Even some varieties of tinned fruits require a little cooking. When tender the pieces, neatly cut, should be marinaded in liqueur, brandy, rum, or wine, with a fair allowance of sugar, a liqueur glass is sufficient for a small dish, with sugar enough to cover the surface of the fruit. Turn the slices frequently during the afternoon, and when cooking time arrives, drain them, pouring the syrup formed by the liqueur and sugar into the batter. Next lay them out on a clean cloth, for if at all moist the batter will not adhere to them. When dry dip them in the batter, using a trussing needle or skewer for the operation, and pass them gently into the hot fat. Finish exactly in the manner described for Be.igne.ts sucres. To ensure the dryness of surface necessary for the adherence of the batter, some cooks roll the pieces of fruit over upon a floured cloth before dipping them. If you use pine-apple, whether fresh or preserved, stew the slices till quite tender in syrup and cut them into strips for your fritters when they are cold. Soak them in their own syrup with a glass of rum, drain, and disy them on a cloth, and proceed as already explained. I would not cut fruit for fritters longer than a couple

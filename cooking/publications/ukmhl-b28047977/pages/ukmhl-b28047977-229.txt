‘ill FRUIT PRESERVING pint of brandy, this they pour round the fruit after having filled the jar. There is not, after all, a pin to choose between the two systems, for in the former, the sugar and brandy amalgamate and become a syrup in due course of soaking. Brandied peaches are preserved in this manner:— Stew the peaches in a syrup made in these proportions: seven ounces of sugar to each half a pint of water, turn- ing them frequently : when tender, put them with the syrup into glass jars (prune jars will do nicely), leaving an inch at the top to be filled with brandy, which should be poured in when the fruit is quite cold. Add the kernels of the peaches, blanched, and then cork down the jars securely. The green fig is not often met with at dessert in the form of a preserve, yet it is capable of being turned to advantage in that manner, as follows :— Green figs in syrup:—Choose a number of figs before they split from over-ripeness, and place them in a pan with sufficient cold syrup to cover them : then simmer them over a low fire till they are tender; take them out, reduce the syrup till clear and of the consistence of honey, and finish as in the case of brandied peaches. Good orange marmalade is so easily procured that it would be absurd to go to the trouble of making it at home. Roselle-jelly can be made by following any of the receipts for fruit jellies : it makes an excellent substitute for red currant jelly, and is by far the best thing to take with pork, being vastly superior to apple-sauce. In the old days, wild hog with roselle-jelly was looked upon as a xpecialiti!. The cultivation of the roselle is, however, fast- passing out of fashion.

ON ICE-MAKING. 171 freezing: when partly frozen, a cup of rich cream well whipped, and lastly any liqueur that may be named in the recipe: the freezing being after that completed. This is the standard method followed by the best artists. The custard or foundation must, however, be a really good one; from eight to ten yolks of eggs per pint will not be too many, and the thickening must be carried out en bain- marie, for a curdled custard would ruin the whole opera- tion. When thick and creamy the custard should be strained through a tamis, and when cold should be whisk- ed over a bed of ice. Cream before being added to an ice should be whipped over ice to a stiff froth, and it ought not to be stirred into the freezer, as I said before, until the custard is partly frozen. Gelatine in small quantity, say half an ounce to a pint, may be used as an assistant in the composition of an ice, or of an iced-pudding, especially in cases where the cook may be pressed for time. It should be separately dis- solved and stirred into the custard while the latter is hot. A firm yet cream cheesy consistency, if I may so describe it, is what the cook should endeavour to obtain in his cream-ices It is a mistake to think that perfection in an ice consists in very hard freezing. A mould of cream-ice that rebels against the pressure of the spoon, and necessitates the use of a dessert-knife is not to be commended, for the harshness betokens the presence of water, or weak milk. You can scarcely freeze really rich custard, or good cream, harder than firm cream cheese. Yet, although comparatively soft, such ices liquefy far less rapidly than the stubborn granite-like masses to which I have alluded. The sweetening of ices is a very particular part of the

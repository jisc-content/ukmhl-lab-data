To complete the dish choose a pie dish, butter it, lay in the rice over the bottom and u]D the sides, leaving a hollow place in the middle for the apple, put the latter into the hollow, and arrange it dome-wise at the top, laying rice over it, smooth the surface with a palette-knife dipped in hot water and then cover it with the meringkie mixture.

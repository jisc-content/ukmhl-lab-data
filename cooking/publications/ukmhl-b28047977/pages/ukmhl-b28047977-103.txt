85 PASTEY. think, accounts for those harsh, talc-like slabs of pale brown crust, piled up, one on top of the other, which so many of us are forced to accept as “ puff-paste.” Next, touching ingredients :— The Hour used should be the best imported, and in a moist climate, such as that of many parts of India, it is a sine qua non that it should be dried in the oven, and sifted to begin with, for the presence of damp in hour ruins pastry. One of the chief causes of failure in attaining light crust is the moisture and oiliness of the butter. All Madras-made butter contains water, and even English butter requires close pressure before the pastry-cook dare use it. Butter for this purpose should be firm, not frozen like a stone, but quite hard enough to cut into pieces. A judicious use of ice for this ingredient is, therefore, un- avoidable if you desire to use it with success in pastry. It is on this account that the modern French cook admits that suet makes lighter puff-paste in hot weather than butter . it is firm, dry, and capable of being evenly distri- buted ovei the dough ; at a time when, in nineteen cases out of twenty, butter is in a semi-state of liquefaction, and utterly unfit to mix with the flour. If, then, you cannot command a good supply of excellent butter, and undertake that it shall be iced as I have de- scribed, you will find it far better, as a rule, to use clarified beef suet. Clarified suet or fat.—Procure as much good, pale >ellow, fresh fat from a sirloin of beef (that surrounding the kidney is the best), and cut it into pieces. Place a large saucepan, or stewpan on the fire, and fill it three parts full of water; when the water boils, throw in the fat; by degrees it will melt, the skin and impure frag- ments will sink, and a rich oil will float upon the surface

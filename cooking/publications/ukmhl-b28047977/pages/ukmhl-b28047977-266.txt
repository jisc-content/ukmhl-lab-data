Then pile the pieces of pine in a tasty shape, dusting them liberally with powdered loaf- sugar, and finally moistening the whole with a liqueur- glass of good old rum.

Next, by making a slight incision half an inch long with the point of a knife along the thin end gently squeeze out the pips. If carefully done, the pips

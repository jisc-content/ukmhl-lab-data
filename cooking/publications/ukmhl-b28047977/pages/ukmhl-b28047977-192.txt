174 SWEET DISHES. raspberry, while the warm brown of chocolate can be hap- pily blended with either pink or cream colour. The yel- lower shades of orange, apricot, and pine-apple creams, harmonize nicely with the pale green of pistachio, and greengage, or with the russets of chocolate and coffee. Dark reds are hardly to be recommended as effective colours at night, yet the brilliant carmine obtainable from the juice of the Bangalore raspberry looks remarkably well with an almond or vanilla cream. Bearing these rules in mind, very attractive looking, as well as pleasantly flavoured ices, can be turned out with- out any great difficulty. Having made, let us say, a pint of strawberry, and a pint of almond cream-ice, a quart ice-mould should be selected ; now cut a piece of card- board to fit the centre of the mould, place it perpendicu- larly, dividing the mould into two partitions, and fill each side completely, one with almond cream-ice, the other with the strawberry ; when filled satisfactorily and care- fully pressed down, withdraw the card-board, close the mould securely and embed it in ice. When turned out, this ice will be pink on one side and cream-coloured on the other. If you want to have the ice moulded in rings of colour, the process is equally simple : nice measurement is alone necessary. Having frozen the two ices satisfactorily, and set the quart mould in the ice, take a couple of large spoonfuls of the almond cream and press them down evenly to form the cap of the mould ; next arrange a layer of strawberry ice a little thicker, say three spoonfuls; after that four spoonfuls of the almond, and so on, till the mould is filled in strips growing wider as you get nearer the bottom. For a mottled ice (glace marbree) fill the mould with spoonfuls of each ice, without reference to any pattern,

Take exactly half the weight of broken loaf-sugar, and amalgamate the juice and the sugar together in the pan off the fire and when dissolved give the jelly a final boil for ten minutes, skimming careful I v during the boiling. In order to test the jelly before potting, pour a spoonful of it on a cold plate; if it congeals, it is ready. Cape gooseberries can be bottled whole, if perfectly ripe, in the manner described for strawberries. A little brandy or liqueur may be blended with the syrup with advantage. The Guaya:—Of late years, careful cultivation has vast- ly improved this fruit, especially at Bangalore, where it is now not difficult to obtain a guava which, when quite ripe, is of creamy tint inside, and comparatively free from seeds. Jelly made from this variety of the fruit ought to be as clear as apple jelly, and about the same colour. Guava jelly of a darker tint suggests the idea that brown and not white sugar must have been used, that the preserve was overboiled and skimming dispensed w'ith or insufficient. Home-made guava jelly, or cheese, ought, therefore, to be vastly superior to anything that we can buy, eclipsing even the well-known Pondicherry preserve which, sold in little earthenware jars, is about the best in the market.

See that the guavas are ripe and free from bruises, then pare them, and quarter them,

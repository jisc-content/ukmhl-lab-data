SWEET DISHES. 196 completed. At the time of service a sherry-glass of rum, and a quarter of a bottle of champagne were poured into the ioe pail diluting the ice to the consistence mentioned. This was served in glasses. The modern version is simpler, for the mixture of wine with liqueur and spirits is no longer considered at all advisable. Briefly, then, the new punch may he described as a good water ice in which the flavours of lemon or lime and orange are blended, a little consistence given by meringue Italienne towards the end of the freezing, and a final flavouring of milk punch or, if not available, a liqueur- glass of curatjoa with the same of rum. A bottle of lemon syrup, and one of orange syrup as sold for ices may be blended and used for the syrup in- stead of a freshly made one as given in the next recipe. Assuming that about a quart of punch is required, make a lemon and orange syrup as follows :—put ten ounces of loaf-sugar into a pint and a half of water, add the zest of two limes and an orange; boil up, cool, and strain. Then stir into it a gill of lime juice and one and a half of orange juice. Pour the mixture into an ice-pail and freeze to the consistence of crushed ice, then stir in meringue Italienne made of four ounces of sugar and three whites of egg (see Marquise pudding) and finish with a sherry-glass of milk punch or the same measure half of rum and half of curaijoa. Serve in glasses. Following this as a guide you can make the following:— Sorbet au champagne:—Pine-apple water ice, the meringue Italienne, and a pint of champagne. Sorbet au kirschRaspberry water ice, meringue Italienne, and kirsch. Sorbet au rhum:—Lemon water ice, meringue ltah- mner, and rum.

Their distinctive features in the matter of garnish, adjuncts, packing, etc, will, however, be carefully recorded. / \ > Pouding glace a la Creole.—Make an ordinary cream- ice, pint or quart as circumstances may require, flavoured with the lemon essence, a liqueur-glass of rum being added after the whipped cream, before the actual com- pletion of the freezing. When nicely frozen, pack the pud- ding mould in this manner :—First a layer of the ice an inch deep, then a layer of thinly sliced Madeira cake over which a little rum has been sprinkled, then another layer of ice followed by one of minced pine-apple, continuing to put more ice, more cake, and more pine-apple, until the mould is filled, and well-pressed down. Now fix the cover on securely, closing the rim with paste or a band of paper spread with suet to keep out the salt, and bury the mould for an hour in crushed ice and salt when it will be ready to turn out. Iced Charlottes are now-a-days much simpler in pre- paration than formerly when the custom was to make a mould of ice and cover it, when turned out, with a cake case made a little larger than the ice mould. All that has to be done now is to make a charlotte case (see pages 36 and 37) and keep it as cold as possible until the time of serving, when the centre of it is filled in the style of the Plombiere described in the last chapter, viz., with spoon- fuls of cream-ice taken from the ice-pail, with a fruit garnish introduced at hap-hazard among the spoonfuls which should be piled dome-wise higher somewhat than the side of the cake case. All the trouble of moulding is thus saved. The fruit garnish must be cut into small squares and sprinkled with liqueur before being used. The selec- tion is, of course, a matter of taste, if in variety, say dried

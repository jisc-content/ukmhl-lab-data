PASTRY. 89 kitchens. Instead of the butter, I would try the clarified beef suet; at least, I would do so if I were unable to procure butter sufficient in quantity, of undeniable quality, firm, cold and quite free from water. As regards the equipment of this branch in regard to small details, the cook should have his pastry-cutters, patt)’- pans, tartlet-pans, &c. The patty-pans should be in different sizes; mince-pies, for instance, are generally made in larger pans than cheese-cakes. With pastry-cutters are made the dainty, little bouche.es d’abricots, d'c. .which look so nice when served en serviette: the cutters are sold in a small case, fitting into each other, and will be found a cheap and very useful item of the kitchen equipment. I recommend that all small pastry, such as puff’s, tartlets, cheese-cakes, &c., should be made a size or two smaller than you generally see them. As a rule, a cheese-cake is too large for one person. It is surely better to make little dainties like these of such a size that one can easily be eaten; they not only look better when made small, but, if not cut, can easily be heated up a second time. Round patty-pans, two and a half inches in diameter, will be found a very useful size. Thus provided, the following will be found a nice recipe for— A dozen small almond cheese-cakes. Weigh a quarter of a pound of sweet almonds (shelled) and blanch them, also blanch three bitter almonds ; pound them with a little rose-water to a creamy puree in a white wedgewood mortar; mix with the purde a quarter of a pound of finely-sifted sugar, two ounces of butter, two table-spoonfuls of noyeau, the juice of one lime, and the whites of two eggs whipped to a forth : mix all thoroughly, and pour the mixture into a dozen small patty-pans lined with puff-paste : bake in a brisk oven for twenty minutes and serve on a napkin dusted over with powdered loaf sugar. 6a

26 SWEET DISHES, to melt the gelatine); when melted, sti’ain off the whole into a bowl. Place the bowl on ice, and stir until its contents begin to set, then whisk into it half a pint of whipped cream. Fill a quart cylinder mould with the mixture, and put it in a basin with pounded ice all round it; cover the mould with a stewpan lid, and place ice upon it; in an hour and a half the cream will be firm. When set, have a basin of hot water—as hot as the hand can bear; dip the mould entirely into the water, take it out immediately, wipe the bottom of the cream with a clean cloth, put a dish over it, reverse it, remove the mould, and serve. If the cream fail to leave the mould freely, dip the mould in hot water again. Strawberry cream is composed as follows:—Warm the contents of a pound tin of good strawberry jam over a low fire with the juice of a couple of nice limes, and a gill of milk to assist the operation. Strain and press it through a sieve. Steep an ounce and a half of gelatine in cold water, dissolve it in a small saucepan, and strain it through muslin into the strawberry syrup. Tint the mix- ture a rosy pink with cochineal. Set it in ice, adding a pint of rich cream or custard well whipped, exactly as laid down for vanilla cream. This recipe can be followed for all fruit creams. The syrups sold for ices will save the trouble of passing jam through a sieve, but when they cannot be got, the jam can always be used. With fresh fruit the following proportions are accurate :— To a pound of picked strawberries four ounces of sifted sugar, one pint of cream or rich custard, and one ounce of gelatine. Begin by crushing the strawberries with a silver fork, and pass them through a clean sieve, into a basin containing the sugar. Soak the gelatine and dissolve it in a gill of milk over a low fire, cool this a little, add it to the strawberry puree and then stir in, well whipped, the cream or custard, mix, fill the mould, and set it in ice.

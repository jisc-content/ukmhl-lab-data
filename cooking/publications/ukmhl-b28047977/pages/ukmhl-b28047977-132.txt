Make a sauce in this way : put half a pint of plain syrup into a stewpan, with a claret-glassful of rum, and two table-spoonfuls of apricot jam ; boil, and thicken the sauce with a tea-spoonful of arrowroot and pass through a pointed strainer. Now turn out the cake, and cut it into two pieces horizontally along the centre, pour some of the sauce upon each piece, and let the cake absorb the liquid ; re-place the two pieces in their original form, put the cake on a dish, mask with the x-est of the sauce, sprinkle finely minced citron over it, and serve. Gateau a la Montmorency is very similar to the above :â€”Make dough as for rolls with a quarter of a pound of flour, and add, when risen well, to it a rich paste made of three-quarters of a pound of flour, half an ounce of sugar, three-quarters of a pound of butter, ten eggs, and a coffee-cupful of warm milk Amalgamate the pastes and proceed as in the previous recipe. The spdcialite is that you must mix a quarter of a pound of chopped crys- tallised cherries with the paste before you consign it to the mould. The sauce is made in the same way ; but it is flavoured with Ivirschenwasser. Scatter minced cherries over the glaze instead of citron.

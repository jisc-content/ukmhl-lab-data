SWEET DISMISS 84 Carelessness in this matter must obviously be the precursor of failure. The mere manipulation of pastry is, as I said before, a gift; still, every cook should remember that the less he thumps and mauls the dough the lighter it will be, and the quicker the work is done the better. The pastry-maker should wash his hands before going to work in very hot water, and plunge them into iced water afterwards, drying them well before proceeding to busi- ness. The frequent use of iced water, to cool the hands while working, will contribute to the success of the undertaking. It is here essential to observe that a little practice will enable the cook to mix his dough, in the first instance, with two strong wooden spoons, or with a wedgewood mortar, pestle and one spoon. This I consider a matter of material consequence. Setting aside all hypercritical notions of cleanliness, it stands to reason that the less the paste is touched by the warm human hand the better and lighter it will prove. Similarly, therefore, let the turns in the rolling-out stage be done with two spoons. If the mixing stage were carried out in a roomy enamelled iron pan, or bowl set in ice, the spoon process could be easily managed. Pastry should he made, if possible, in the morning before the real heat of the day has set in. If kept in a cold place, or in a covered dish laid over ice, it will keep perfectly well till required later in the day. A most important feature in pastry is, of course, its baking. Too slack, or too fierce an oven, will destroy all the careful work I have just described. A good hot oven is required, sufficiently brisk to raise the pastry, yet not severe enough to burn or even scorch it. The Native cook is inclined to err on the side of extreme heat, which, 1

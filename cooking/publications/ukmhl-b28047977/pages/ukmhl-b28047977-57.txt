COLD SWEET ENTREMETS. ay It is now necessary, while the meringues are hot, to scoop out the soft part in the centre of each, thus forming hollows. This requires great care ; a tea-spoon should be used, and the outer crust left intact. The hollowed cases, open side upwards, should now he arranged on a dish, and returned to the gradually cooling oven to dry thoroughly. The method, when the forcing bag is used, is to squeeze out portions of the meringue mixture upon the paper. These take a round shape of their own accord, and (the papers having been laid upon the wetted board; are baked and finished as explained for ordinary meringues. The advantages gained are the smooth round shape instead of the old oval, and variation of size at pleasure.

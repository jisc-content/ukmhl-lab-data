8 SWEET DISHES, jelly is either very nutritious, or very easily digested. It has accordingly lost the position it once held in the estima- tion of nurses, and we are at liberty to discard the calves' feet in favor of those handy little packets to which I have referred. It is by no means easy to fix the exact proportions of gelatine to fluid, having in view that perfection of setting which is neither too firm nor too liable to collapse. An ounce to a pint is the best general rule, but there are so many kinds of gelatine in the market now-a-days that the safest plan is to test the sort you use once, and note the result for future guidance Again, a jelly which has to sustain the weight of a heavy garnish of fruit must necessarily be stronger than one in which nothing has to be set; while another point fro remember is that the assistance of ice will always make a slight difference in the amount of gelatine requisite to effect firmness. As far as colouring is concerned no connoisseur will now admit of anything except the natural tints produced by the fruit juice or syrup used, the wine, or liqueur. The employment of artificial colourings, so dear to charla- tanism, is no longer tolerated by people of taste, nor indeed is excessive limpidity considered desirable when it is obtained at the expense of flavour. The syrups sold for making sweet ices provide us with materials for pretty-looking jellies, and save an infinite amount of trouble. For instance, an ounce-packet of gelatine dissolved over the fire with a bottle of strawberry syrup (sufficiently diluted with water to fill the pint mould that has been selected), and a squeeze of lime-juice, with a glass of noyeau, or maraschino added when cold, the whole strained through a fine sieve, and set firm upon ice, or, on the Hills, in spring water,â€”will be found a very presentable jelly indeed,

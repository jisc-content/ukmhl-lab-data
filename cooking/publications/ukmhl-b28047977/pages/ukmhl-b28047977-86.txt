SWEET DISHES. 68 These may be described as sweet rissoles, being made of jam or other nice preparation wrapped in pastry and fried. Properly speaking this kind of fritter is one of old time, having been introduced to the French cuisine by Marie Antoinette on her arrival from Vienna: hence its name “ Beignet d la Dauphine.” The paste may be puff paste or brioche paste, it should be rolled out quite thin (one-eighth of an inch thick) and stamped out in l'ounds with a two and-a-half inch cutter ; the allowance of jam, or whatever it may be, about the size of a filbert, or, say, a tea-spoonful, is placed in the centre of the round, the edges are wetted all round with the brush, and another round of paste laid over it, the two being joined by pinch- ing the wet edges all round. Brush over the fritters with beaten egg, let this dry, and then fry in the manner des- cribed for Beignets souffles—gently, in moderately hot fat at first, and then with increased heat until the proper colour is attained. Drain, dry, and serve, dusted over with sifted sugar. For the filling of Dauphincs there are jams (the original one was made with apricot jam), any cheese cake mixture, the composition described for ground rice fritters to which chopped pine-apple or preserved ginger may be added, the macaroon mixture mentioned for macaroon fritters, mince meat, &c., &c. Note.—To finish this chapter it only remains for me to add that, though a crisp fritter requires little assistance beyond that afforded by the lime and sugar, some varieties may perhaps be improved with an accompanying sauce, handed separately croquettes de riz, arrowroot fritters, croutes dorces, and custard fritters, for instance. A good variety of sweet sauces will be found in the chapter reserved for puddings from which selections can easily be made. Of course the sauce must never be put into the dish with the fritters.

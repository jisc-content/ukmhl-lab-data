FRUIT PRESERVING. 205 merits better attention, and one that would certainly well repay a little trouble at the bands of the market gardener. With regard to the Cape gooseberry jam, generally sold on the Hills, I believe I am right in saying that it is, as a rule, too sweet and waxy, the syrup, in which the fruit is preserved, being overcharged with sugar in the first instance, and then somewhat over-boiled. The conse- quence of this is that independently of its stickiness, the jam loses much of the flavour of the fruit. Cape Gooseberry jam:â€”First of all be sure that the fruit is ripe, clean, and that it is also quite dry. Weigh it, and take exactly a similar weight of sugar: to every pound, add the juice of a couple of ordinary limes : put the sugar and lime-juice into an enamelled pan with half a pint of water per pound of the former and boil for ten minutes. Now add the berries, boil up once and simmer until they are cooked. It is recommended by some to prick each berry before commencing this stage of the proceedings. The preserve is now ready, but it is, of course, wise to put it in a basin covered with a cloth for a day, so that any tendency to ferment may betray itself before potting. The syrup ought not to be thicker than that which is found in orange marmalade. Cape Gooseberry cheese is made like the above with this exception : After boiling the fruit and lime-juice together, turn the contents of the pan upon the sieve, and rub the fruit through it. Then put the puree so obtained into the pan again, and add the sugar, boil, skim, &c., as in the case of the jam. For Cape Gooseberry jelly put the fruit into the enamelled pan and keep it stirred gently over the fire till the juice is extracted. Strain this from the husks, either through muslin or a silk sieve, &c., when it has all come

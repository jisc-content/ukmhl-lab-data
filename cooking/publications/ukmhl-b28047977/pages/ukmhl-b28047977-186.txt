SWEET DISHES. 168 side of the machine. The “ Paragon ” freezing machine, made on this principle, is to be recommended as effecting considerable economy in time, labour and freezing material. The process of ice-making consists of three operations:— first, making the mixture ; next, freezing it; and, lastly, moulding it. The first, of course, is an operation requiring some experience and attention; the second is almost mechanical; and the third, a task that merely demands care, unless a parti-coloured mould of ice be wanted, when the operator’s good taste will be called into play. The composition of an ice. or iced-pudding mixture, is a thing that the mistress of the house ought certainly to superintend. Half an hour in the afternoon might well be spared for the work, and the result will generally atone for the trouble. She should choose the recipe, and satisfy herself that its directions are accurately followed. Freezing in the old fashioned way may be thus described: —Crush the ice somewhat roughly and mix it with some rough salt,—four parts ice to one part salt. Put a layer of the mixture at the bottom of the pail, and set the freezing-pot upon it, filling the space between the pot and the side of the pail with ice and salt, well jjressed down. Turn the freezing-pot to see that it can be moved easily, and complete the packing of the pail up to within half-an- inch of the rim of the pail. Native coolers, as a rule, break the ice into lumps of various sizes, generally far too large ; the consequence of which is imperfect freezing, and great waste of ice. The ice should be evenly crushed in pieces about the size of a filbert nut, and then the ramming down produces a consolidated mass of freezing mixture into which no air can find its way. As soon as the freez- ing-pot has been satisfactorily embedded, and yet works easily when turned, cover the top of the ice with a layer of

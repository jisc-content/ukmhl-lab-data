10 SWEET DISHES. macddoine of fruits:—dried cherries, preserved apricots, gzeengages, &c., cut into nice pieces. Put a border mould upon ice, and pour into it a little of the liquid jelly to the depth of the eighth of an inch. Set some of the fruit therein, t,o form the surface garnish of the jelly when turned out. Pour in enough liquid to cover the layer of fruit, and continue to arrange the remainder of the fruit in similar layers until the mould is completed. Observation.—In setting a jelly in layers, be careful not to commence operations until the liquid is cold; if in any way warm, it is liable to loosen the ornaments laid in your mould. On the other hand, do not let it get too cold, for if beginning to set, it would, when poured into the mould, fill it with air bubbles, which would destroy the appearance of the jelly entirely. It is a matter of import- ance also to pour each of the subsequent layers of a jelly into the mould as soon as the one immediately preceding has set, in order to guard against the formation of any film of moisture on the surface of the layer, which would pre- vent cohesions between the layers, and would in all pro- bability, cause the jelly to fall to pieces on being turned out of the mould.— [Gonffd.] Note that the old-fashioned advice as to oiling a mould before putting the liquid jelly into it is absolute rubbish : all that is necessary is to dip the mould into clean water to dampen its surface. It is obvious that the mould must not be at all greasy. In turning out a jelly that has become firmly set, let the cook be perfectly calm. Dip the mould in hot water for a few moments, and the jelly will slip gently out of its prison without a blemish. The native cook is wont to use force, and to try and eject the jelly by vigorous shaking. Teach him the uselessness of a such a course, and the danger that it entails upon the content? of the mould.

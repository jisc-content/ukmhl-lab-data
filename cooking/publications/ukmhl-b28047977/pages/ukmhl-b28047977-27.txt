9 JELLIES. It should be noted that while syrups may often be clarified in one process with the gelatine, wines and liqueurs ought always to be reserved for addition after the clarified liquid has become cold. Red wines should never be put into tinned utensils. During the hot weather, a most agreeable sweet can be made for ordinary borne consumption out of common tart fruits. These must first be very gently stewed with sugar, a little water, some lime-juice, and a glass of wine. When soft and sweet enough, strain off the liquid, pass the fruit through a clean sieve, amalgamate the syrup and the pulp of the fruit; after having dis- solved enough gelatine in the former, set it, let it get cool, and then set it in a mould upon ice. Custards that have been placed in the ice-box should accompany. A jelly of this kind is, of course, opaque, but it is not in the slightest degree less pleasant to the palate on that account. The French confiseurs call these purde jellies “pains,”—pain de groseilles, pain d’ananas, &c. We mu^t now proceed to discuss the composition of a few superior jellies, which should be reserved for special occasions, for, though easy to make, they are expensive. Champagne jelly with fruit (Gelee de champagne aux fruits) :—Put an ounce and-a-half of gelatine into a stew- pan with a quarter of a pound of sugar. Beat the whites of two eggs, mixing with them a pint of water, and the juice and finely-shred peel of one lime. Pour the liquid over the gelatine and sugar, place the pan on the fire, stirring its contents unceasingly until they just reach boiling point, and a thick white scum forms on the surface, using a small whisk for the stirring. Then remove the pan, and let the liquid it contains cool a little, after which strain it through flannel; pour it back, and strain it again and, if necessary, again, until it is bright and clear. When quite cold, adcl half a pint of champagne. Prepare a U

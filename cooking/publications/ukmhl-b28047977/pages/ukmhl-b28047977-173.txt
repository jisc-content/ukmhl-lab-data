155 PUDDINGS. dumplings made plain with currants, with flavourings of sorts, &c. These are generally made small, four or five forming a dish. Currant dumplings :—Wash, pick, and dry, in a floured cloth, a quarter of a pound of currants; take two ounces of powdered sugar, stir the latter into the currants, with a pinch of salt, and eight ounces of finely-chopped bread crumbs: mix thoroughly, adding eight ounces of finely- minced suet, the juice and zest of a lime, a few drops of lemon essence, and three well-beaten eggs Make a paste of these ingredients, roll it into balls, the size of large oranges, tie them in floured cloths and drop them gently into a large saucepan of fast boiling water, move them about now and then, to prevent their sticking to the bottom of the saucepan, and, when done, lift them out carefully, drain, remove the cloths, and serve them on a napkin. They will take half an hour if cooked in this form. The same composition may be rolled into an oblong shape like a ‘ roly-poly ’ pudding, and tied in a floured cloth, in which case it will require an hour and a half. Lemon dumplings are made in this way:—Chop half a pound of suet very small, and mix it with the same weight of finely-grated bread crumbs; blend the two ingredients with three well-beaten eggs, and a spoonful of milk if necessary, add the zest and juice of two limes, four ounces of sugar, and flavour the whole with lemon essence. Boil the dumpling in a basin, or form the paste into balls, and treat them as explained for currant dumplings. By substituting vanilla or ratafia flavouring for the lemon, but in other respects following this recipe, you can make vanilla or ratafia dumplings. For almond or cocoanut dumpling, use four ounces of the nut pounded with a little rose-water and add an egg. With puddings of this class a well-flavoured wine or liqueur sauce is an improvement.

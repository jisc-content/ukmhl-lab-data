122 SWEET DISHES. act as a buffer between the bottom of the mould and the bottom of the pan which, being immediately over the fire, would communicate too great heat to the bottom of the mould. Water in sufficient quantity to reach half-way up the mould should next be poured into the pan, and this, before the introduction of the mould, should be brought nearly to the boil. After the mould has been put in, the water should be allowed to reach boiling point, imme- diately after which the vessel should be removed to the gentlest heat, and its contents very quietly simmered closely covered up The pudding will be firm and fit to turn out in about fifty minutes from the time simmering commenced. Always let the mould rest for three or four minutes before turning it out, for if it be done immediately the pudding may collapse. This process, by no means difficult, insures the produc- tion of a most acceptable series of puddings. It effect- ually combats the error so often encountered, whereby a custard pudding is produced as full of holes as a gruy6re cheese surrounded by a watery sort of whey, the result of fast cooking. But cooks can scarcely be blamed, when authors instruct them to put these puddings into moulds tied tightly with cloths, and then to boil them fast in a closely covered vessel! No cloth is needed whatever, the only covering should be a piece of buttered paper, cut neatly to fit it, laid over the exposed end of the mould, and at least three-quarters of an inch should be allowed in filling the mould for the expansion of the pudding in cooking. Note.â€”When a mould is buttered, and ornaments of any kind are laid upon it, remember that the custard or pudding mixture must be quite cold before it is poured in; if at all warm, it would melt the butter lining, disarrange the pattern, and the pudding would probably not turn out well at the end of the cooking.

66 SWEET DISHES. is squeezed through a wide mouthed forcing hag, and shaped into crescents or circles. After the frying (which is conducted in a similar manner) and the draining, the beignets are allowed to become slightly cool, and are then brushed over with a glaze composed of melted sugar flavoured with rum. The wire drainer containing them is then pushed into a moderate oven to dry the glaze, and heat the beignets, after which they are served. It is worth noting that cold pudding can, if firm enough, be cut into convenient lengths, and either be egged and rolled in crumbs, or dipped in batter, and fried, forming an economical and decidedly nice rechauffe. For the crumbing of sweet fritters it will be found a good plan to use rasped biscuit, ratafias, or the broken pieces of biscuits at the bottom of a tin which, if lightly crushed in a mortar and sifted through a wire sieve, make excellent crumbings. Dry such debris in a moderate oven before crushing and keep the chapelure thus obtained in a dry place well corked down. Custard fritters are made out of a floury custard which the French call bouillie, the “hasty pudding” of old-fashioned English domestic cookery. The pre- paration should be made in this way:—Put eight ounces of Hour in a stewpan, mix into it three whole eggs, moisten with a little milk, and stir over the fire, adding milk by degrees until a pint has been expended in all. Keep the fire moderate, and work the mixture as smoothly as possible for twenty minutes. Remove the pan from the fire and dust into it two ounces of sifted sugar, three yolks of egg, and whatever flavouring you like, essence or zest. Spread the mixture out upon a dish which should be brushed over first with melted butter) about an inch thick and when cold cut it into convenient pieces, egg them, roll them in raspings, and fry in very hot fat.

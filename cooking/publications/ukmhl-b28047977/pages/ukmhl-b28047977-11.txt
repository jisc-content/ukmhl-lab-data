PREFACE TO THE FOURTH EDITION. /—c*>~ years have passed since the First Edition of Sweet Dishes was offered to the Madras public, and, although the work has been re- printed three times, I never had an opportunity of thoroughly revising it. This task, with the assistance of much practical experience during the last eight years, I have now carried out to the best of my ability. It need hardly be asserted that cookery of the best kind is continually advancing. Whereas some of the methods practised m the past may remain unaltered, and many standard compositions survive the reform- ing hand of time, progress asserts itself as time goes on by simplification by introductions here, and by primings there, while Fashion exerts its influence upon style, flavours, decoration and other details. In these circumstances, the revision of Sweet Dishes—untouch- ed for nearly nineteen years—has become renovation I he greater part of the new Edition has been re- written obsolete recipes have been removed, and newer ones substituted, while all that has been retained of he original matter has been carefully corrected. Brought up to its present standard, in short Sweet Dishes is, practically speaking, a new book.

109 FANCY PASTIiY. Napolitaincs may be ornamented with chocolate icing, pistachio icing, almond icing, rose icing, or any pretty icing you like. Savarin Paste is something like brioche:—Put one pound of flour into a basin, make a hole in its centre, and put in two tea-spoonfuls of Yeatman’s powder, or a coffee-cupful of sweet toddy moistening the surrounding flour with a couple of table-spoonfuls of warm milk ; let this rest a while, then add a gill of warm milk beaten up with two eggs, work this into the flour with a spoon, add another egg, three-quarters of a pound of butter, a quarter ounce of salt, half an ounce of sugar, and half a gill more warm milk, continue working with the spoon, and gradually add two more eggs. Cut up two ounces of candied peel into very small dice and mix it into the paste. Butter a plain cylinder or border mould, strew some finely-chopped almonds over the butter, half fill the mould with the paste and let it rest in a warm place: when it has risen to the top of the mould bake it in a moderate oven. When done turn it out of the mould, let it cool a little, and serve the savarin hot with a syrup flavoured with any liqueur. Sayarin au confiture -Bake this in a plain charlotte mould, eight inches in diameter, turn it out, let it get cold, aud cut the cake in slices; lay them on a pastry board, dust them over with fine sugar, spread each slice over with apricot glaze and rebuild the savarin, laying the slices over each other, and glazing over all with apricot glaze: replace the savarin in the oven to heat it up well, then take it out, boil a claret-glassful of Madeira and a tumbler- ful of syrup together, pour it round the dish and serve. A Savarin tipsified with rum mixed in the syrup is of course familiar to many people under the name of Sava- rin au rhum.

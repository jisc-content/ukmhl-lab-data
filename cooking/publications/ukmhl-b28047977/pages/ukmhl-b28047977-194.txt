Proceed to freeze, adding a coffee-cupful of whipped cream to finish with. Lemon Cream ice must be made with essence of lemon: the lime can only be recommended for water ices. The process is the same as that given for Vanilla Cream:— Boil a pint of milk with three ounces of sugar, flavouring it with vanilla (or lemon, or ratafia): let it get cold, turn it to a custard with the yolks of eight eggs, strain, cool again, whip, freeze it, and stir in a coffee-cupful of whipped cream when partly frozen.

When boiled and well frothed up, let it get cold,

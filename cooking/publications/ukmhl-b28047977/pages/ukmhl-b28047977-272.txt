254 APPENDIX, eggs is this :â€”The material to he whipped must be quite cold, and the basin also cold. If the weather he at all warm, or the kitchen hot, ice must be used for both. That is to say, the cream should be kept as long as possible in the ice box, and the bowl set in broken ice before and during the whipping. If this be done, the process can be very quickly and efficiently performed. Commence very gently, and slightly increase the vigour of the beating as it proceeds. Dubois recommends that the cream be kept for twenty-four hours in a refrigerator, but for all practical purposes from the morning skimming until the time required in the evening will be found sufficient. Cream requires no assistance in the shape of white of egg. That substance is only employed in the concoction of substi- tutes which in India especially are not to be despised. I need scarcely say that the fine art of substitution is largely practised in London where there is no excuse for it, alum, gum arabic, lard and other things being used to assist the deception. Very fair substitutes can be made by blending rich custard with cream aided with white of egg. Frangipane (page 32 ) can be blended with cream in the same manner. Half a pint of each with two wdiites of egg will be found about right. Let these be very cold before commencing the work, and set the bowl over broken ice. Begin with the custard, whisking gently and blending with it by degrees the stiffly whipped whites of egg. Lastly, add the cream separately whipped in a bowl over ice. Flavour- ing can be given to the custard or frangipane by zest or essence, sweetening also with icing sugar. Economy of time and labour will be secured by this amalgamation by degrees of the substances each separately whipped. Whipping becomes a very laborious undertaking if the com- ponent parts of the composition are mixed beforehand.

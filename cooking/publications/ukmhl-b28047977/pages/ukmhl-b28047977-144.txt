126 SWEET DISHES. Almond pudding (Ponding tiger aux amandes) (baked) : —Blanch and pound together half a pound of sweet almonds (shelled), six hitter ones, and a table-spoonful of orangeflower, or rose-water: beat up well the yolks of seven eggs, and the whites of three, separately; mix them into a quarter of a pound of fresh butter softened, but not quite melted, adding a pint of cream, and a quarter of a pound of powdered loaf-sugar. Incorporate the almond paste with this mixture, thickening it somewhat with three table-spoonfuls of white crumbs, or grated ratafias. Put the mixture into an enamelled stewpan, and stir it well over a low fire, so that it may thicken and be well blended. Do not allow it to boil upon any account. When well mixed, remove the pan, let its contents cool, add a glass of brandy or one of noyeau, and then pour it into a dish lined with puff-paste, brush its surface over with melted butter, bake for half an hour in a moderate oven, and serve liberally, frosted over with finely sifted white sugar. For steamed almond pudding, follow the foregoing recipe, as far as the addition of the crumbs, and then go on as follows : stir into the mixture the zest of a couple of limes or one good orange. Whisk all together as lightly as possible. Butter a plain charlotte mould thickly, arrange upon it a casing of ratafias, fixing them on the butter with the point of a skewer, then pour in the mixture very gently to disturb the casing as little as possible, and steam according to the rules of process No. 3. Noyeau sauce:—Make a syrup with three ounces of sugar, and a breakfast-cupful of water,—if too thick, add a little more water. Boil with the syrup the finely peeled rind of a lime, add the juice of the lime, skim and add a few drops of cochineal. Now stir the mixture for a couple of minutes, and strain it into a hot sauce boat, adding a wine- glass of noyeau just as you serve.

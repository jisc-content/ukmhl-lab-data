PUDDINGS 117 A good old recipe for the cleaning of pudding cloths— one peculiarly well-adapted for Indian kitchens—is given by Miss Acton in these words:—Pour three quarts of boiling water over a pint-measure of sifted wood ashes laid at the bottom of a roomy vessel, wash the cloths in this, or give them two or three minutes’ boil in it first, and then let the whole cool together. Rinse them afterwards in abundance of water, which should be changed several times. Before using a pudding-cloth—if assured of its clean- liness—dip it in boiling water, squeeze it dry, spread it out on a board, and dredge it with flour. Moulds and basins must be tied up tightly in pudding- cloths and they must be liberally buttered to facilitate the turning out of the puddings boiled in them. Plain moulds are far safer than fluted, for appearance is often spoiled by parts of a pudding sticking to some crevices in the pattern of a mould which the butter did not reach. To butter well, use a pastry brush and soft, not oiled, butter. Put the pudding into boiling water to begin with, and maintain that temperature throughout the process. The frequent fault of boiled-puddings, remember, is that they are not sufficiently done. Intermittent boiling is a great mistake. If you boil a pudding in a cloth without a mould or basin, you must move it about in the boiler now and then, or it will stick to the bottom of the pan. Lay a plate at the bottom of the boiler to prevent this. It should be noted that sugar, butter, and suet become liquefied in the process of boiling; the consequence is that, if their proportions be exceeded, it becomes highly probable that the pudding will not set firmly. Remember therefore that cohesion and firmness in a pudding are, in

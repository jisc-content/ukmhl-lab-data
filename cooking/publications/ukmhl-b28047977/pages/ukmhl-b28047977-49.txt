CUSTARDS AND CREAMS. 31 Spanish cream:—Put three table-spoonfuls of cooked rice into an enamelled pan, moisten with a gill of milk, stir in two table-spoonfuls of orange flower water, the juice and zest of an orange, and two table-spoonfuls of powdered sugar, set the pan in a larger vessel containing hot water, stir in the yolks of three eggs, and cook altogether as in custard-making. When well mixed and creamy, strain into a bowl and finish with half a pint of cream as in the foregoing. There is a preparation called “ Spanish cream ” by some cooks which is used for garnishing the surfaces of fruit compotes and other entremets which are served in flat dishes : Dissolve an ounce of gelatine in a couple of gills of rose-water, stir in the yolks of four eggs and the juice of two limes. Thicken as in custard-making, dredging in three ounces of icing sugar; when smooth, strain into a bowl, and pass into it half a pint of whipped cream ; when well blended empty the contents of the bowl into a shallow pan so that it may solidify as a slab half an inch thick. When set, garnishing patterns can be cut out of this with fancy cutters. If liked, half the cream may be tinted pink with cochineal, and then the garnishing can be arranged in alternate colours. Ginger cream (Crime cl la Chinoise)Make a rich custard with the yolks of six eggs, a pint of milk sweetened with two ounces of sugar, and three table-spoonfuls of ginger syiup. Dissolve in a little water one ounce of gelatine, strain it into the custard, and whisk the mixture well: set it on ice : when solidification commences, add half a pint of cream and four ounces of minced preserved ginger, mix thoroughly, and either pour it into a mould, or set it in a china-dish over a layer of choice fruit perfumed, as it were, with any nice liqueur. In either case the mould or dish must be set in ice for the cream to congeal properly.

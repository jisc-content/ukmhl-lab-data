241 BISCUITS AND DWSSERT. Ladies' Wine biscuit:—Mix three ounces of ground rice, and three ounces of finely-sifted loaf-sugar. Make them into a paste with four fresh eggs. Beat altogether for some minutes vigorously, then spread the mixture evenly and thinly on some sheets of well-buttered paper, place this in a buttered baking tin, and bake for twenty minutes. Then stamp out the paste so baked, into orna- mental shapes (stars, crescents, ovals, &c.), and mask them with rose-icing already given and put them into a warm oven till the icing sets. Pistachio biscuits:—-Take half a pound of pistachio nuts (shelled) and two ounces of sweet almonds (shelled). Blanch all the nuts and peel them. Next, pound them together, using rose-water during that operation. Whisk the whites of four eggs to a very stiff froth, and still whisking, pass in the nut paste with them with eight ounces of icing sugar, and the same of flour. When thoroughly beaten, and mixed together, add a liqueur- glass of maraschino. Roll the paste about half an inch thick, cut this into crescent shapes launch long; bake in a moderate oven. Whip the white of an egg with a table- spoonful of sugar to a smooth glaze, and when cold brush the biscuits over with it. Dry in the oven two minutes. If the colour be too pale a green, mix a little spinach- greening carefully made with the paste until you get the tint you require. Cocoanut biscuits are made by whisking five eggs briskly with nine ounces of sugar and then adding six ounces of grated cocoanut, four ounces of flour and a tea- spoonful of vanilla essence. This mixture will form a paste, which should be patted into cones with a wooden spoon or spatula. The cones should be laid upon well- buttered paper, and baked in tins until lightly coloured. Or it may be rolled and cut into any fancy shapes that may be liked. Finish as explained for pistachio biscuits. 16

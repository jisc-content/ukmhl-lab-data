MOUSSES. PABFAITS, BOMRES, </• SOUFFLES. 188 mixture as in custard-making. When of a nice consistence, take the bowl out of the water, and whisk its contents till cold, continuing the whisking over ice until the cust- ard is well frothed and firm, then add, by degrees, still whisking, a pint and a half of stiffly-whipped cream. The question of flavouring having been settled before com- mencing work, the preparation, whatever it may be, should be communicated when the two whipped substances are blended. The mould, lined with thin paper dipped in water, must be quite cold before the composition is put into it; for this reason it should be covered with crushed ice till wanted. The mixture must be shaken well home into the mould by tapping the bottom of it fairly briskly on a folded cloth laid upon the table. The closing of the mould must be carefully seen to in the manner described in the last chapter. It should then be buried in a very carefully prepared packing of ice and salt—plenty of salt, and the ice crushed small, and pressed closely down to expel all air. See that there is plenty of freezing material at the bottom of the pail, and pile it dome-wise over the top. Let it remain four hours, and if, during that time, there be signs of melting, renew the packing, pressing it well down, and covering the top again. A piece of jhool- stuff or blanket should be spread over the pail and its contents. If these directions are carefully carried out, failure is impossible. Let nothing be overlooked and every precaution taken. To twelve pounds of ice, allow four of salt. Regarding the flavouring :—This, as I have said, must not be communicated in a liquid state, for the chief thing to maintain is firmness in the appareil. If at all liquid, there will be difficulty in the freezing, and the special mousse consistence will not be attained. Hence it is that

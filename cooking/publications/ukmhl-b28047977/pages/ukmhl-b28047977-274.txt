The tipsifying liquid should be given a modern flavour with Benedictine, Kiimmel, Chartreuse or Kirsch in these proportions :—To one gill of water and two and a half ounces of sugar give a claret glass of the liqueur chosen. No mixture of wine should be thought of, the juice of a lime and a ripe orange should be added. This should be in sufficient quantity to moisten the cake thoroughly without pulping it, and should be regulated by the size of the dish required. A layer of raspberry jam should be spread somewhat thickly over the surface of the soaked cake, a little of the liqueur should be sprinkled over the jam, and the dish finished with whipped cream which may be slightly sweetened and flavoured with orange flower water, zest, essence, powdered praline or chocolate. A trifle would be modernised for instance by using Kirsch for the liqueur and scattering crystallized cherries over well whipped cream flavoured with praline. Wyvern’s plantain pudding (Ponding aux bananes) steamed:— Choose six ripe plantains, peel them, scrape off any fibre that may adhere to them, slice them in halves longi- tudinally, cross-cut the halves and divide each quarter thus obtained in two, lengthwise. Lay these pieces in a soup plate and marinade them with a liqueur-glass of maras- chino, or any liqueur available, the juice of a good lime, and a dusting of sifted sugar. Turn them about occasion- ally. Make the custard mixture already described for caramel pudding, mix thoroughly and strain it. Next take a pint border-mould, butter it well and line it with buttered paper, lay in it the slices of plantain crosswise, leaving spaces for the custard to filter thiough , when packed, pour in the custard, leaving half an inch for rising, and set the mould to steam very gently like caramel pudding till set. Let it get cold in the mould, then turn

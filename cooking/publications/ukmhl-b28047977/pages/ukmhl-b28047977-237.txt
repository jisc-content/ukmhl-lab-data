CAKES, ETC. 219 Chocolate icingPut six ounces of finely-grated cho- colate into a stewpan, dissolve it over a low fire with just sufficient warm-water to form a smooth but thick paste. Now take it from the fire, and stir in, by degrees, working the mixture with a spatula, enough icing-sugar to bring the contents of the pan to the consistence of ordinary icing. When smooth and firm enough, spread this over the surface of a cake as in the case of ordinary icing. Chocolate icing forms an agreeable surface-dressing for numerous pretty little cakes.-—the Gcnoise cm chocolate, and Biscuit d la Venitienne, for instance. It can be per- fumed with essence of vanilla. For Praline icing: —Instead of chocolate, use powdered paraline (see page 23), and work as just described. Coffee-icing is produced by a similar process. Make half a pint of the strongest black coffee you can in a per- colator, and gradually thicken with icing-sugar, adding the vanilla essence. Raspberry, strawberry, red currant and apricot icings are made in the same way, using strong syrup of the fruit as a basis. Rose-icing is simply ordinary icing flavoured with rose-water and tinted with cochineal. These icings are worth practising, for, as to be indicated later on, with their aid little cakes made of Savoy, or Genoise pastry, &c., cut into tasty little shapes, can be turned out most effectively for afternoon at-homes, recep- tions, &c. Almond paste, when properly made, is a welcome addi- tion to a rich cake. It is rarely met with in India, how- ever, at its best. I think, nevertheless, that, if attention he paid to the following recipe, a little improvement upon ordinary almond icing will be attained, Select a pound

Remove the pan again, work into it one by one three well beaten eggs, and an ounce and-a-half of grated ratafias. Lay the paste out upon a dish that has been dipped in cold water with a wooden spoon, pat it into a square about one-third of an inch thick and let it rest in a cold place for two or three hours. When required, stamp out of it ovals or rounds with a pastry cutter, flour them, dip them in beaten egg, turn them over in a cloth spread over with ratafia crumbs, and fry according to the directions given for fruit fritters.

In the meantime a cloth should be spread on a pastry board or on the surface of the table, and fine crumbs, which have been carefully sifted, dredged all over its surface The egged fritter is then laid on the centre of the crumbs, and, by gathering the four corners of the cloth together, lightly tossed among them. This will coat it nicely, the process being continued till all are done. Time should he given for crumbing to dry before frying. Potato fritters:â€”Take two large or three small pota- toes, four yolks and three whites of eggs, a table-spoonful of cream, half a glass of Sherry or Madeira, a little cinna- mon and a few drops of ratafia flavouring. Boil the pota- toes ; when nice and floury, drain them very dry, and pass them through a wire sieve into a bowl; add the four

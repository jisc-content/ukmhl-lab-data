101 PASTRY. accompanies tinned and bottled fruit is not as fully flavoured as fresh juice ; so it is advisable to improve it by boiling it down with half its quantity of bottled syrup (to which lime-juice will give a pleasant sub-acid, or a spoonful or two of jam. One recipe for preserved fruit tart-malving will be sufficient. For example, let us take apricot-tart:—Open a bottle or tin of preserved apricots. Fill a nice pie-dish with them, piling them up in dome shape to support the paste in convex form, and give them a slight dusting of sugar; pour the syrup that is with them in the bottle or tin into a stewpan with a liqueur-glass of lime-juice to sharpen it. Boil up, adding a table-spoonful of apricot jam, and stir continually as the liquid, by boiling fast, is reduced by about one-third of its original quantity. Cool this and pour it into the dish with the fruit. Then roll out a nice piece of puff-pastry; first, cut a thin strip of it to line the margin of the pie-dish; wet the edge of the dish and lay the strip round it. Next, cut a piece of pastry,—large enough to cover the whole tart,—rolled out about a quarter of an inch thick. Put this over the fruit, pressing it down round the edges firmly, trim off sharply all overhanging paste, scallop the rim all round with a paste jagger or mark it neatly with the prongs of a silver fork, and bake the tart in a well-heated oven. As soon as the tart is done, take it out, brush it over with the white of an egg beaten to a stiff froth, sift powdered sugar over it, and return it to the oven for a few minutes to dry. While, as I have said, tarts in India must to a great extent be made of tinned or bottled fruit, at certain seasons in many places local produce lends itself opportunely to this form of cookerymangoes, when not quite ripe, peaches, apricots, apples, pears, pine-apples, figs, guavas, plums, the tree tomato, bilimbi (corrupted by southern

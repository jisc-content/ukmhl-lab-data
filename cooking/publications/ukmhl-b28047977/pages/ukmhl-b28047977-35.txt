JELLIES. 17 or so and then strain it through a clean sieve into a basin. Next put an ounce of gelatine, a quarter of a pound of sugar, and one pint of water into a stewpan, stir over the fire until the gelatine is melted, and then strain through a fine sieve. When strained and cold, add the almond milk, and a tea-spoonful of orange flower water (to be got at the chemist’s) and mix the whole thoroughly. Put a border mould upon ice, fill it with the blanc manger, and when set firmly, yon can turn it out. This receipt is plainly capable of being followed substituting cocoanut for the almonds. Another is richer still :—Pound the almonds as in the foregoing receipt, add half a pint of water and let the almond milk stand to absorb as much flavour as possible. Now put half a pint of fresh cow’s milk, and a coffee- cupful of cream, with six ounces of sugar, and a few drops of vanilla essence, into a stewpan, dissolving in the liquid one ounce of gelatine. When liquefied, strain, let it get cool, and add the almond milk; pour the whole into a mould already placed in ice, and serve when set firmly. A plain one can be made in this way :—Beat three eggs with three table-spoonfuls of cornflour, flavour with a few drops of lemon, vanilla or ratafia essence. Take a pint of new milk, and three ounces of sugar; put these ingredients on the fire, and simmer them for five minutes ; strain the milk into the basin containing the eggs and cornflour, empty the whole into a stewpan and stir over a gentle fire till it thickens like a custard: add an ounce of liquefied gelatine, cool, pour the mixture into a mould, set it on ice, and, when firm, turn it out as you would a jelly.

CAKES, ETC. 233 For a superior cake of this description, the following proportions are given by an old authority :—Six ounces of sugar, six ounces of butter, one pound of flour, one pound of golden syrup, six eggs (ordinary Indian size), one ounce of powdered ginger, the juice of two limes and a table-spoonful of brandy. Beat the eggs to a froth, then add the syrup by degrees, beating tbe two together steadily, and continuing the beating as the sugar and flour are gradually put into the mixture. Add the butter (melted) also gradually. La°t of all, stir in the ginger, lime-juice, brandy, and, when thoroughly incorporated, pour the mixture into a shallow tin, previously lined with a well-buttered paper, and bake in a moderate oven. A gingerbread tin should be rectangular, and about three or four inches deep. Tbe use of spice in gingerbread is sometimes overdone. A very little, if any, is necessary. In speaking of the use of spices, the great Dr. Kitchiner enquired why people mixed spices? “If you require spice,” said he, “select one and stick to it.” Following this principle it would seem obvious that if you want gingerbread, you should be contented with ginger only as a flavouring agent. To prove, however, how people differ in taste, read the following recipe given in a curious old book for a “ powder for gingerbread ” :— “ Pound thoroughly in a moriar, two ounces of coriander seed, two ounces of caraway seed, two ounces of powdered ginger, half an ounce of grated nutmeg, half an ounce of cloves, three-quarters of an ounce of fennel seed, and three-quarters of an ounce of aniseed. Sift the powder thoroughly, then keep it like curry powder (which I should fancy it resembled) in bottles well corked down. When about to make a cake, dissolve one ounce of the powder in syrup made of a pint of water, with two pounds of sugar boiled to the consistence of treacle.” 15a

SWEET DISHES. 142 served upon a napkin, well-dusted with powdered loaf- sugar : the darioles should not be over one inch and three- quarters inches in diameter. Note.—With reference to the lining of pie-dishes with puff-pastry for baked puddings —a step very frequently recommended—it should be observed that such lining is not absolutely necessary. A well- buttered pie-dish suffices for any baked pudding, but it must be allowed that the pastry is an improvement.

Baked tapioca pudding (Ponding au tapioca):—A quarter of a pound of tapioca, three ounces of butter, a quart bottle of milk, ten eggs, a quarter of a pound of sugar, and a few drops of any favourite essence. Pound the tapioca as previously recommended (page 42), soak it in cold water to clean it, then strain and turn it into a stewpan with the milk ; let the tapioca simmer gently until tender : this will take about twenty- five minutes; then take it off the tire and let it get cold before adding to it the sugar and butter, the yolks of eight of the eggs beaten and strained, and two whole eggs; mix thoroughly, flavouring the composition with a few drops of essence. Lastly, add the whites of the eight eggs well-beaten, pour the pudding into a well-buttered pie- dish and bake it in a fairly hot oven for about three- quarters of an hour. Dust over with powdered sugar and serve. Baked lemon pudding (Ponding au citron) :—Put into a stewpan over a moderate fire four ounces of butter and six ounces of powdered sugar. Stir together well till boiling, then pour the liquid into a bowl. Let it get cold. Next break, one by one, and whisk together six eggs, strain them, and dredge into them little by little a dessert-spoonful of cornflour, whisking well to mix the

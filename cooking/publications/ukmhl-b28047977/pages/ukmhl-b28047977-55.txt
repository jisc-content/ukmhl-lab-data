37 COLD SWEET ENTREMETS. the case, avoid sticking any part of it to the mould; all that is necessary is to fix the pieces of cake together. Queen Mab’s pudding is made in the same way in regard to the casing of cake, but instead of the grated ratafias a gill measure of minced preserved fruits moist- ened, as for Nesselrode pudding, with maraschino, must be mixed into the cream, and syrup with maraschino served round the mould. The Charlotte belongs to this family, the difference being that the case open at the top is turned out dry when set, and brushed over with apricot glaze over which may be sprinkled chopped pistachio nuts or praline. Pure cream whipped, flavoured, garnished, and kept very cold in a bowl over ice, is put into the case just before serving. Sometimes, instead of the glaze, a band of inch satin ribbon, pink, pale blue, pale green, &c., is passed round the case and tied in a bow. After a little practice the making of a Charlotte case will present no difficulty whatever. The cream may be varied as follows :— x. ft la Turque:—whipped cream with coffee, ii. abricotde .-—whipped cream with finely chopped apricot. iii. franiboisce:—whipped cream with raspberry. iv. d la creole, .-—whipped cream with pine-apple mince, and rum. v. pralin ’e .-—whipped cream with praline, and noyeau. vi. d la Polonaise:—whipped cream with pistachio nut and kirsch. ’ vii. d la Victoria:—whipped cream with strawberry, and maras cliino. viii. « la Seville .-—whipped cream with orange, and curaeoa. ix. d la MonastCre :—whipped cream with Benedictine.

82 SWEET DISHES. For Frangipane or French custard,—the English custard being called by French cooks “ Crime Anglaise ”— beat well together in a bowl three yolks and one whole egg, adding by degrees one and a half ounce of sugar, three gills of new milk, one and a half ounce of butter, and three ounces of flour. Set the mixture in a custard saucepan over a low fire, and stir in two ounces of melted butter and two of almonds pounded with rum or brandy to a paste. When smooth and creamy, the preparation is ready for use in many ways, viz.:—to fill profiterolles, petits ehoux, eclaires or vicringu.es. Frangipane is used instead of jam for tartelettes, and instead of cream with fruits. Instead of almond paste the mixture may be flavoured with vanilla, ratafia, chocolate, burnt almond, &c.

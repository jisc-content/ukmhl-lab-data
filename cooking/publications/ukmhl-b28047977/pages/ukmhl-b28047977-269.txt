APPENDIX. (Recipes accidentally omitted.) Caramel pudding (creme brutee au bain marie) steam- ed :—Put two well-filled table-spoonfuls of icing sugar or pounded caster sugar into a small saucepan over a low fire, and with a wooden spoon stir without ceasing until it has melted and gradually assumed a rich chocolate colour. Stop as soon as this has been done, and pour the syrup into a clean plain charlotte mould (pint) which should be warmed before receiving it. When the syrup has spread evenly over the bottom of the mould, set it in a cold place, and as it cools, the caramel will set firmly at the bottom of the mould and ultimately form a cap for the pudding when it is turned out. Next make a rich custard mixture as follows:—Break three eggs into a bowl one by one, beating them gently together, and adding two extra yolks with three gills of cold, boiled milk; sweeten with three ounces of sugar, and flavour with lime or orange zest or any essence that may be liked. Strain this carefully through a hair sieve. Now, using a brush for the purpose, butter the inside wall of the mould containing the set caramel, and pour into it the custard mixture ; cover the surface of this (it should not quite fill the mould) with a piece of buttered white paper cut to fit it, and proceed with the process of steaming, viz.:— Lay a piece of folded paper at the bottom of a stewpan large enough to hold the mould with some little room to spare, pour into it almost boiling water in quantity suffi- cient to reach a little less than half-way up the mould'

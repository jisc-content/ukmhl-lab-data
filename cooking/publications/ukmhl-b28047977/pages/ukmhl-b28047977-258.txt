SWEET DISHES. 240 bitter ones and pound them to a paste with rose-water. Then mingle the almond paste with the white of egg froth, and heat them afterwards into the yolks and sugar. Now, add a quarter of a pound of flour by degrees, and stir into the mixture an ounce of citron finely minced, and an ounce of candied lemon peel also minced. When thoroughly mixed, put the mixture (half full) into shallow tins, like sponge-cake tins, and bake till they rise and begin to take colour; then turn them out, and let the bottom of the biscuits harden. Ginger biscuits:—Weigh eight ounces of flour, then four ounces of white sugar, and enough powdered ginger to satisfy your taste (probably a quarter of an ounce), mix the whole together with the yolks of five eggs well beaten ; stir in four ounces of butter liquefied, and, when satisfactorily amalgamated, butter a sheet of paper freely, and force the biscuit mixture upon it at intervals, allowing space for its spreading in the baking. Bake a light colour in a moderate oven. Sponge biscuits:—For these you must have a few little square tins. Beat the yolks of six eggs thoroughly, and stir into them half a pound of well-sifted sugar. Whisk until bubbles rise to the surface of the mixture, then add the whites, which should have been whipped to a stiff froth first. Beat all together, stirring in from five to six ounces of flour and a salt-spoonful of lemon essence ; when thoroughly mixed, pour it into the little tins, and hake. Sift powdered sugar over them before baking, and butter the tins liberally. The oven should be brisk. For Crisp biscuits a stiffish dough is required. To one pound of flour, add the yolks of two eggs, and just sufficient milk to mix the dough. Beat and knead the paste until it is quite smooth, then roll it out thin, cut it into rounds, and hake in a slow oven for about a quarter of an hour.

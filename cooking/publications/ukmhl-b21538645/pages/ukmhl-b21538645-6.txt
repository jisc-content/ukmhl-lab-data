8 PREFACE. To Bake Bread.—A half quartern loaf will take 40 minutes exactly, both the grid shelves may be filled with as many loaves as they will hold with the browning shelf over them. Reduce the gas for bread every ten minutes, and quite out for the last ten minutes. As regards Grilling.—The grills of different stoves vary somewhat in construction, but the method of grilling is very similar. Always light the gas and let the griller get red hot, and the gridiron underneath in the pan must be hot too. Then grease the bars and place the steak on the gridiron. Be careful not to allow the flames to touch the meat. Give the steak a fierce heat for one minute to seal up the outside and form a casing to keep in the red juices, then lower the flame a little and let it cook gently for about five minutes ; then turn the steak with a spoon or blunt knife or the steak tongs, turn up the gas to give the raw side of the steak a fierce heat for one minute, and then lower the flames to one half for the remaining five minutes. Chops will take about seven minutes (the same method as above being observed), and Cutlets five minutes. Meat cooked by the gas griller as above is very tender and juicy, and extremely nourishing, palatable and digestible. The grill is also very nice for grilling bacon and fish, and making toast, and cannot be equalled for Omelettes. Lastly, the one secret of Cooking successfully and economically with gas, is first of all to get the oven and browning shelf very hot with the gas full on, and to turn it down very low for Cooking.

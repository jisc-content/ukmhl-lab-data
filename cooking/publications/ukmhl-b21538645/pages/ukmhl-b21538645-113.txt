PASTRY. IRules for pastry. Make the pastry in the coolest place in the house, and have cool hands. Use a cold marble slab or pastry board and a straight rolling pin, and very cold water. Always finger it lightly, and make it quickly. Pastry should always go into a hot oven, so as to set the •crust and prevent the butter or lard from running out; the oven door should never be slammed, as it shuts in a current of cold air and prevents the pastry rising, On taking pastry out of the oven, do not let it stand in a draught, but keep it in a warm place to cool gradually, or the steam that is coming from it will condense and render the pastry heavy. Always place pastry underneath the browning shelf in hot oven, and reduce the gas flames every five minutes or every ten minutes. Cassolette pastry. Ingredients.—6 ozs. Flour, 2 ozs.

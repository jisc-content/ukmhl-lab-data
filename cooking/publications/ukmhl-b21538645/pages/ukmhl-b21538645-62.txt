HOT PUDDINGS. Hpple an£> ©range jfritters. Ingredients.—2 Apples, 2 Oranges, X lb. Flour, 1 gill tepid Water, 1 tablespoonful of Butter or Salad Oil, a pinch of Salt, the whites of 2 Eggs, a little Castor Sugar. METHOD.—Prepare the batter first by putting the flour through a sieve into a basin ; make a well in the centre, melt the butter in the warm water or add the salad oil, and mix this gradually with a wooden spoon to the flour, so that there be no lumps, and beat it well for five minutes ; then put the whites of eggs on a shallow plate, sprinkle a pinch of salt over, and whip up stiffly with a knife, then mix lightly with the batter. The oranges should be peeled and divided into sections, taking out the pips and as much pith as possible. Sprinkle them well with castor sugar, dip in the batter, have some frying fat hot about two inches deep, dip an iron spoon into the fat, then take a piece of orange covered with batter and slip it quickly into the frying fat and fry a light fawn colour ; drain on some kitchen paper, and serve piled up high on a dish. The apples should be pared thinly and the core taken out with a cutter, then cut in thin slices so as to form rings. Put these in the batter, and take out with a skewer and plunge in the boiling fat.

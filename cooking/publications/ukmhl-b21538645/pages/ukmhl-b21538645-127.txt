BREAD AND CAKES. 129 Method.—Mix flour and ginger together and pass through a wire sieve into a basin ; then add the peel cut in thin shreds. Put the butter, treacle, and sugar into a stewpan and set it just over a glimmer of gas so as to melt slowly and not burn. Then add it, when melted and only lukewarm, to the flour. Dissolve the soda in the milk, beat the eggs slightly with a fork, then mix altogether and stir well. Pour into a greased Yorkshire tin and bake for half an hour or 40 minutes. Note.—Place the Yorkshire pudding tin on a grid shelf just underneath the hot plate, with the gas flame p2-in. long. In ten minutes lower the gas to j^-in., and in ten minutes more lower still, and turn gas out for the last few minutes, or move cake to the top of oven or lower shelf to finish. Xuncb Cake.

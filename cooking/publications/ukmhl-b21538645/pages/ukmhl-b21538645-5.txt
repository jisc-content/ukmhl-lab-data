PREFACE. 7 flames to come up the sides of the saucepan, concentrate the heat underneath as much as possible. As soon as the con- tents of the saucepan come to boiling point, turn the gas nearly out, and it will keep gently simmering. To Bake Pastry.—Let the oven get thoroughly hot, the temperature should be about 240. Place the pastry on baking sheets, immediately under the solid or browning shelf and turn the gas down to half, diminishing the heat from time to time, and placing the pastry on the top of the browning shelf to finish off. Pastry requires a sharp quick oven to set it, and to keep the butter in; as soon as the pastry is set aud beginning to brown, the heat must be reduced. For Cakes.—A moderate oven is required, not so hot as for pastry, but when the cake is rising and browning, say in 5 to xo minutes, lower the gas considerably, and when nearly done, turn the gas quite out in the oven to let the cake soak well. If a large cake taking 2 hours to bake, lower the flames to half-an-inch on putting it in the oven, and after 10 minutes lower the gas and reduce the heat every half-hour, turning the gas quite out for the last half-hour. If the cake takes only an hour to bake, reduce the heat every quarter of an hour and turn it quite off the last quarter of an hour, and so on in proportion for either large or small cakes, placing them always upon an open grid shelf and underneath the solid or browning shelf till risen and brown. Small cakes such as Rock Cakes, require a sharper oven to set them into shape, but the heat must be reduced after 2 or 3 minutes. Any Cake burnt underneath is due to too much gas being used.

When the stock is quite cold, remove the fat and put the stock into a clean stewpan, add one carrot, turnip, onion, and celery cut up in rather large pieces, and one pound of raw beef which has just been passed through the mincing machine. Stir well in the cold stock and then put it on to boil, whisk well until just on boiling point, remove the whisk, put the lid of stewpan partly over and let it simmer for 15 minutes.

A wine glass of Madeira may be added at the last, or omitted, according to taste. jflemtsb Soup.

84 JELLIES, CREAMS AND COLD SWEETS. Botlefc Custarfc. Ingredients.—i pint Milk, 3 Eggs, sweeten to taste and flavour. Method.—Put the milk in a stewpan, with the sugar and any flavouring, to get hot. Stir the yolks; and whites of the eggs in a basin to thoroughly mix them, and pour the hot milk on, stirring all the time. Now strain it back into the stewpan to remove the tread of the egg and cook the custard well, constantly stirring until it thickens. Cook it over a very little gas and be careful it does not reach boiling point or the eggs will curdle. Pour into a jug to cool, and when cold fill the custard cups. The same mixture for a baked custard strained into a buttered pie dish instead of the stew pan. Great care must be taken not to let the milk come to the boil in the oven. Caramel Malnuts. Take some Marzapan and form in oval shapes.. Place the half of a peeled walnut on either side and insert a little stick or skewer at one end. Then make some caramel with lb. of loaf sugar, % gill of water, a little lemon juice, and 3 drops of acetic acid. Boil this to the snap over a glimmer of gas, dip the walnuts in quickly, giving them a thin coating of the caramel all over. Let them dry on an oiled plate or slab, and serve in fancy cases.

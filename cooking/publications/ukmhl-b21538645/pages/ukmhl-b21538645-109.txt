111 SALADS AND SAVOURIES. METHOD.—Blanch and beard the oysters, chop them into about four, mix them with the sauce, truffle and mushroom, and keep warm in a stewpan. Take the butter, divide it equally into six pieces, roll each piece into the shape of a cork, then roll in bread- crumbs and shape again ; egg it well, and again roll in the crumbs. Take a sharp knife, in order to mark a lid, then place the cassolettes when all are prepared in a frying basket, dip in very hot fat, and fry a light fawn colour. Drain for a minute or two on kitchen- paper, then with a pointed knife raise the lid marked by the knife, and drain the melted butter from the inside into a basin; fill each cassolette with the oyster mixture and replace the lid ; serve on a folded ser- viette. Garnish with parsley. NOTE.—Chicken or game can be prepared in the same manner, but would be more suitable for a breakfast dish. ©yster Savoury.

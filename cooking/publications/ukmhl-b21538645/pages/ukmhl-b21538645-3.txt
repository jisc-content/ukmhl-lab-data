Now that gas is recognized as the best medium for cooking, having great advantages over coal, both as regards rapidity, cleanliness and economy, my aim in this book is to be a help to those who have already a Gas Stove or are desirous of having one, therefore I have appended a few useful hints as to their management. First and foremost the Stove should be kept scrupulously clean. The oven well washed after using (if any grease has been spilled) with hot water and soda. The stoves are lined with enamel, therefore they can be washed as easily as a plate and dried with a cloth. The stewpans for use should be kept clean and bright. Iron saucepans may be used if â€¢quite free from soot as the soot would fall off and choke the boiling burners, causing an unpleasant smell. By simply turning a tap and applying a light it is in readiness for what- ever is required to be boiled, and the oven is perfectly heated in ten minutes, the heat throughout being uniform and from -day to day exactly the same temperature, and can be regulated

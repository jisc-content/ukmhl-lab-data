For Roasting.—Light the gas and turn it full on in the oven, allow the door to remain open until condensation has ceased, just about a minute or two, then close the door for ten minutes. Open the ventilator and put the joint in the oven, hanging it on the hook provided, to one of the shelves or to the top of the oven according to the size of the joint.

If roasting a leg of mutton, hang the leg the thickest end upward so that the greatest heat of the oven, which is at the top, shall be at the thickest end of the meat, the shank bone being down by the gas burners, where the heat is less, every part will be evenly cooked- Puddings and Pastry may be cooked at the same time, placing them on the grid shelf, over the meat and underneath- the browning shelf. The use of the solid or browning shelf is to cut the oven in two, giving the greatest heat just under the browning shelf, and a cool oven above, so that in every stove one can have two ovens, one very hot and one cooler. For Boiling,—Turn the gas full on but do not allow the

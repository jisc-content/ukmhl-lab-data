Sausage Meat, yi lb. fillet of Veal, pickled Walnuts, Gherkins and Chillies, a little ground Pimento, Pepper and Salt, 2 hard-boiled Eggs, 2 ozs. of Ham or Tongue.

Then commence to bone by dividing the bones at the shoulder and taking out the merry- thought, continue to press the flesh off the carcase with the thumb and divide any sinews with a sharp knife. The fowl should not be drawn, but the carcase taken out whole. On coming to the leg divide it at the joint, being careful not to cut the skin, and get the carcase out whole; then bone the legs and wings, scraping the flesh off with a knife. Take a pair of scissors and cut it down the back, and spread it out as large and as flat as possible. The veal should be put through the mincing machine and mixed with the sausage meat. Mix the pimento (one teaspoonful) with some pepper and salt, and sprinkle some of this seasoning on the chicken ; then half the sausage and veal spread evenly over and half of the other ingre- dients cut in strips, sprinkle more seasoning, then the rest of meat seasoning and pickles. Roll this up tightly and sew it up, tie it in a cloth and plunge it into boiling water and let it simmer for an hour and a half or braize it for two hours. When cooked take it

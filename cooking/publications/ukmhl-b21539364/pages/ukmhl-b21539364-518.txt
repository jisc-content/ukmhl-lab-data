434 General Observations on the Calf. 969.-TABLE OF THE RELATIVE VALUE OF VARIOUS PARTS OF VEAL. Giving the actual cost of the eatable portion of the various joints, after deducting Loss in Weight from Waste, Bone and different modes of Cooking. Great care has been taken in the preparation of these tables, all the joints having been carefully tested. The result shows that no joint can be reckoned to cost less than a shilling per pound. Veal is, nevertheless, not such an extra- vagant meat as it is generally considered to be, the waste in cooking, as may be seen by the Second Table, being not very great. Name of Joint.

pod General Directions for Carving Game. was in auld lang syne one of the necessary accomplishments of the youtlr ful squire; but, until side-tables become universal, or till we see the office of “ grand carver ” once more instituted, it will be well for all to learn how to assist at the carv- ingof this dish,which, if not the most elegant in ap- pearance, is a very general favourite. The hare, hav* ing its head to the left, as shown in the woodcut, should be first served by cutting slices from each side of the backbone, in the direction of the lines from C to D. After these prime parts are disposed of, the leg should next be disengaged by cutting round the line indicated by the figures E to F. The shoulders will then be taken off bypassing the knife round from G to H. The back of the hare shoufd now be divided by cutting quite through its spine, as shown by the line A to B, taking care to feel with the point of the knife for a joint where the back may be readily penetrated. It is the usual plan not to serve any bone in helping hare; and thus the flesh should be sliced from the legs aud placed alone on the plate. In large establishments, and where men cooks are kept, it is often the case that the backbone of the hare, especially in old animals, is taken out, and then the process of carving is, of course, con- siderably facilitated. A great point to be remembered in connection with carving hare is, that plenty of gravy should accompany each helping ; otherwise this dish, which is naturally dry, will lose half its flavour, and so become a failure. Stuffing is also served with it; and the ears, which should be nicely crisp, and the brains of the hare, are esteemed as delicacies by many connoisseurs. I436.-GROUSE. Grouse may be carved in the way first described in carv- ing partridge. The backbone of the grouse is highly esteemed by many, and this part of many game birds is considered to possess the finest flavour. GROUSE.

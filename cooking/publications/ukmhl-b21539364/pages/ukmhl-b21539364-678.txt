T russing. 5*4 The fowl, having been plucked and singed, must now be drawn. First, lay it back downwards on the table, cut a slit in the skin of the neck, draw out the neck and cut it off at the root. Afterwards cut through the skin, leaving enough to form a flap. Through this opening you must, with the middle finger, as shown, loosen the en- trails, doing this care- fully and thoroughly, that you may afterwards have less trouble in draw- ing the bird. The pre- this stage and drawing, LOOSENING INSIDE. ceding illustration ought to be useful for both showing how the entrails are placed. Secondly, cut off the vent and draw the fowl. To do this hold fowl as shown in illustration, and carefully take out all the entrails, specially careful not to break the gall bladder, for this accident may ruin the bird by im- the Be parting a very bitter taste to the flesh. The inside must then be carefully wiped out, as also the flap of skin at the neck, and should you by any accident have broken any part it is best to wash out the inside of the fowl, drying it thoroughly afterwards with a clean cloth. A very great deal of care is necessary in the drawing of all birds, till some practice has been obtained, but afterwards it is a comparatively easy task. Thirdly, dip the legs in boiling water, scrape them and cut off the claws ; also the tips cf the pinions. Some prefer to leave the trimming of the claws till the bird is trussed, when it is laid upon a board and the feet chopped off. FOWL BEING DRAWN.

RECIPES FOR COOKING VEGETABLES. CHAPTER XXIX. 1528.—BOILED ARTICHOKES. (Fr.—Artichauts au Nature!.) Ingredients.—To each£ gallon of water allow 1 heaped tablespoonful of salt, a piece of soda the size of a shilling ; artichokes. Mode.—Wash the artichokes well in several waters ; see that no in- sects remain about them, and trim away the leaves at the bottom. Cut off the stems and put them into boiling water, to which have been added salt and soda in the above proportion. Keep the saucepan uncovered, and let them boil quickly until tender ; ascertain when they are done by thrusting a fork in them or by trying if the leaves can be easily'removed. Take them out, let them drain for a minute or two, and serve on a napkin, or with a little white sauce poured over. A tureen of melted butter or oiled butter should ac- company them (Artichauts a la Sauce Blanche). This vegetable, unlike any other, is considered better for being gathered two or three days; but they must be well soaked and washed previous to dressing, or if left til! cold they can be served with olive oil and vinegar (a I'huile). Time.—20 to 25 minutes after the water boils. Average Cost, from 4d. to 6d. each. Sufficient.—A dish of 5 or 6, for 4 persons. Seasonable from July to the beginning of Sep- tember. CARDOON ARTICHOKE. The Composite, or Composite Flowers.—This family is so exten- sive as to contain nearly a twelfth part of the whole of the vegetable kingdom. It embraces about 9,000 species, distributed over almost every country; and new discoveries are constantly being made and added to the number. To- wards the poles their numbers diminish, and slightly, also, towards the equator; but they abound in the tropical and sub-tropical islands, and in the tracts of continent not far from the sea-shore. Among esculent vegetables, the lettuce, salsify, scorsonera, cardoon and artichoke belong to the family.

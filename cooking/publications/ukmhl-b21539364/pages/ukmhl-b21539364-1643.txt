Recipes for Manservant. 1501 3325.—TO PRESERVE CORKS FROM INSECTS. Dip the heads of the bottles when corked into quicklime slaked into a paste and let it harden on. Petroleum rubbed over the corks and necks will also serve to keep the insects away, but it is not quite so efficacious a method as the lime. 3326.—TO CLEAN CASKS. It is a most important thing that casks for wine or ale should be perfectly clean and free from any acid smell or mustiness before they are used. Lactic and acetic acid get absorbed in the wood very often, and do great damage to fermenting liquid. The ordinary way of washing a cask is with boiling water, and when cool examining it with a light inside. If there be any sour or musty smell, how- ever, lime must be used to remove it. Break the lime into lumps and put it in the cask dry (it will take from 3 to 4 lbs. for each cask), then pour in as many gallons of boiling water as there are pounds of lime, and bung. Roll the cask about now and then, and after a few hours wash it out, steam it, and let it cool. RECIPES FOR MANSERVANT OR PARLOUR-MAID. 3327—TO CLEAN PLATE. (A very excellent method.) Wash the plate well to remove all grease in a strong lather of common yellow soap and boiling water, and wipe it quite dry; then mix as much hartshorn powder as will be required into a thick paste, with cold water or spirits of wine ; smear this lightly over the plate with a piece of soft rag, and leave it for some little time to dry. When perfectly dry, brush it off quite clean with a soft plate-brush and polish the plate with a dry leather. If the plate be very dirty or much tarnished, spirits of wine will be found to answer better than the water for mixing the paste. PLATE-BRUSH.

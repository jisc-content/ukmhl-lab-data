595 Drawing Sinews of Turkey. 1281.â€”TO TRUSS A TURKEY. Having plucked and singed the bird in the same manner as a fowl, the next thing will be to draw the sinews. First, break the leg bones close to the feet, run a hook through, as shown in the illustration, and draw out the sinews. To do this successfully and with the least amount of trouble, it is necessary to have the hook above you, placed rather high up in the wall so that you can bring your weight as well as your strength to bear upon the bird. It is sometimes rather a hard task to draw the sinews, but it is an absolute neces- sity that they should be taken out, or the legs of the bird will be per- fectly uneatable. When the sinews are drawn, the legs should then be chopped off, as shown in the following illustra- tions. Young cock turkeys may be known by their short spurs and black legs, but if the legs are pale and rough and the spurs long, they may be taken as sure indi- cations of age. Turkeys of a medium size are, as a rule, far more tender than the enormous ones so greatly in favour for the Christmas dinner. These birds should never be dressed the same day that they are killed. In cold weather they may safely hang for a week, but if the weather be mild, then three or four days will be long enough.

RECIPES FOR INDIAN COOKERY. CHAPTER LII. 2870-RICE FOR CURRIES. Ingredients.—Rice, water, salt. Mode.—Wash 1 lb. of rice in several waters, then let it stand in cold water for half an hour to soak. Strain off the water and put the rice into a saucepan with enough water to cover it about 2 inches above add a little salt and boil over a brisk fire. When the rice is tender take it off the fire, and while the water is still boiling throw in a cupful of cold water, shake the pan, and then strain the rice and let it stand back from the fire, with a cloth thrown over the saucepan for a little time. 2871.—INDIAN CORN ROASTED Ingredients.—Unripe corn, butter, salt.

1054 General Observations on Ices and Confectionery. the thumb and forefinger of the right hand roll the paper round the cone, so that the point P shall turn round i, 5 ; continue rolling till the point 4 comes on c ; the line 4, 6 will then coincide with the opening, and the triangle 4, 2, 6 remain- ing, can be folded down into the centre of the cone, so that 2 shall coincide with 5 at the apex of the cone. 2293. To use the cone, fill it three-parts full, fold over one another the two sides at the top, and close by turning over the point in the middle. Cut the point according to the work, and for very fine work it is well to have a small metal nozzle that can be put inside the paper cone. To press out the icing, hold the cone between the first and second fingers of the right hand, with the thumb on the base of the cone, so that the icing may be expelled by a slight pressure, the left hand directing its course. A good way to begin cone decoration is to make a pencil sketch of the design you wish to illustrate, lay it under a piece of glass, and upon the glass trace with the icing. A little practice in this way will greatly help the amateur. 2294. Materials for Cone Decoration,—Whipped white of egg and sugar can be coloured in a variety of ways and serve for all kinds of ornamenta- tion, both for cakes and pastry, which can be hardened if necessary in the oven. Butter serves for savoury dishes such as hams and tongues, this also being coloured according to taste. FATENT ‘'FILTERING” REFBIGERATOR,

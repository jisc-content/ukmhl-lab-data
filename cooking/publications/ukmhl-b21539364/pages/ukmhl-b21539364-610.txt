520 General Directions for Carving Midton and Lamb. 1138.—SADDLE OF MUTTON. Although we have heard, at various intervals, growlings expressed at the inevitable “saddle of mutton ’’ at the dinner-parties of the middle classes, yet we doubt whether any other joint is better liked, when it has been well hung and artistically cooked. There is a diversity of opinion respecting the mode of sending this joint to table; but it has only reference to whether or no there shall be any portion of the tail, or, if so, how sadple of mutton. many joints of the tail. We ourselves prefer the mode as shown in the illustration here given; but others may, upon equally good grounds, prefer to have the tail shorter, or quite cut off. Some trim the tail with a paper frill. The carving is not difficult: it is usually cut in the direction of the line rom B to A, quite down to the bones, in evenly-sliced pieces. A fashion, however, patronised by some, is to carve it obliquely, in the direction of the line from D to C; in that case the joint would be turned round the other way, having the thin end on the right of the carver. 1139.—SHOULDER OF MUTTON. This is a joint not difficult to carve. The knife should be drawn from the outer edge of the shoulder in the direction of the line from A to B, until the bone of the shoulder is reached, many slices as can As as can be carved in this manner should be taken, and after- wards the meat lying on either side of the blade- bone should be served, by carving in the direction of C to D, and C to D. The uppermost side of the shoulder being now fin- ished, the joint should be turned, and slices taken off along its whole length. There are some who prefer this under-side of the shoulder for its juicy flesh, although the grain of the meat is not so fine as that on the other side.

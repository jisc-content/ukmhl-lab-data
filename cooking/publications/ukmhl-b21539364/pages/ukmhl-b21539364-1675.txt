1533 To Make Starch, RECIPES FOR THE LAUNDRY MAID. 3436. —TO MAKE STARCH. Ingredients.—Allow £ pint of cold water and 1 quart of boiling water to every 2 tablespoonfuls of starch. Mode.—Put the starch into a tolerably large basin ; pour over it the cold water, and stir the mixture well with a wooden spoon until it is perfectly free from lumps and quite smooth. Then take the basin to the fire, and whilst the water is actually boiling in the kettle or boiler, pour it over the starch, stirring it the whole time. If made properly in this manner, the starch will require no further boiling; but should the water not be boiling when added to the starch, it will not thicken, and must be put into a clean saucepan, and stirred over the fire until it boils. Take it off the fire, strain it into a clean basin, cover it up to prevent a skin forming on the top, and, when sufficiently cool that the hand may be borne in it, starch the things. Many persons, to give a shiny and smooth appearance to the linen when ironed stir round two or three times in the starch a piece of wax-candle, which also prevents the iron from sticking. 3437. -TO MAKE STARCH.

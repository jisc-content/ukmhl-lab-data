1644 Legal Memoranda. Accusations of idleness, want of cleanliness, or lack of ability, may be freely expressed where there is anything like ground for the statements, but to impute dishonesty is often a serious risk unless a conviction has been obtained. The utmost care is necessary, but an employer is not only to be excused, but commended, for such candour as may prevent another employer from placing confidence where it is clearly not safe to place it, therefore, an application from an intending employer justifies telling everything unfavourable that is strictly within the precise facts. On the contrary, the employer, who has got rid of a dishonest or disreputable servant, is not legally at liberty to speak against her in the way of gossip, and especially when there is an apparent desire to do the servant an injury out of any spirit of retaliation, when no application is made for the character. Such con- duct renders the gossip liable to damages. %* Numerous matters of interest with reference to household affairs (including gas, water, coal, bread, adulteration of foods, &c.) are dealt with at length in the “ Household Adviser,” price 2s. 6d.

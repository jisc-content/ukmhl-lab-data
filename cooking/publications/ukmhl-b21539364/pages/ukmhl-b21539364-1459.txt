Menus for Picnics. 1329 3026— PICNICS. One of the pleasantest forms of entertainment is a well-arranged picnic (if only a fine day be selected), while nothing is calculated to give greater dissatisfaction than a badly-managed one. To have chosen the wrong people (even one or two, who are likely not to make themselves agreeable), to have given people wrong seats in the various vehicles, or to have too many ladies in the party, are all often fatal errors. We say nothing of the mistakes made about the luncheon or dinner, when, as is often the case, the ladies provide this, each taking what she likes, with the result, that there is too much of one thing and too little of another ; plenty of salad and no dressing; two or three legs of lamb and no mint sauce ; an abun- dance of wine and no corkscrew; and such like little accidents. Given a happy party of young people, bent on enjoyment, these are trifles light as air, which serve rather to increase the fun than diminish it. But, on the other hand, the party may not all be young and merry ; it may be very distasteful to some to have to eat meat without bread, and almost impossible without salt, while, no corkscrew being at hand, it will rouse their indignation to see the necks of the bottles knocked off, or the corks incompletely picked out with a pen- knife ; and yet, in the annals of picnics, all these things, bread, salt and cork- screw have been forgotten. The easiest way to arrange that there should be nothing wanting, if the ladies provide the repast, is for one lady (the most competent) to make out a menu, adding all the little etceteras, and apportion to each one her share. The following menus for picnics may be found useful, the prices and quantities being given ; while a list of requirements, in addition to the viands, will be found at the foot. 3027.—PICNIC LUNCHEON FOR TWENTY PERSONS —SUMMER.

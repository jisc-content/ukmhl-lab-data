BREAKFASTS, LUNCHEONS, DINNERS, TEAS AND SUPPERS. CHAPTER LIX. MEALS. 2975. Of all the necessities of life, there are none that come before the material ones of eating and drinking. Whether we are ill or well, rich or poor, harassed or at ease, hard worked or lazy, it is certain that to live, we must eat and drink. Yet though we are one and all ready to acknowledge this fact, many underrate the importance of how we take our food, and of what it should consist. These are apt to cavil at those who make eating and drinking not only a con- sideration, but a study, although be they inmates of a household where the mistress of the house does devote some portion of her time to considering what is best and most suitable in the way of food and drink for all, they must confess that it is a good thing she looks upon this task as a duty.

A much wider class have not the means to provide good cooks, while some do not buy the best food, and yet, though they do not take any trouble to look after the meals of the household, they still expect their little ones to be healthy, their boys and girls to grow up strong, and their husbands to be always up to work. Higher cares, more ennobling occupations are quoted as excuses for their not busying themselves in looking after the creature comforts of those by whom they are surrounded, and in putting mind before body, education before food, they fall into error.

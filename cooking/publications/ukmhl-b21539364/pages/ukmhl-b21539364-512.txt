428 General Directions for Carving Beef 957-SIRLOIN OF BEEF. This dish is served differently at various tables, some preferring it to come to table with the fillet, or, as it is usually called, the undercut, uppermost. The reverse way, as shown in the cut, is that most usually adopted. Still the under- cut is best eaten when hot; consequently, the carver himself may raise the joint, and cut some slices from the under side, in the direction of from A to B, as the fillet is very much preferred by some eaters. The upper part of the sir- loin should be cut in the direction of the line from E to F and care should be taken to carve it evenly and in thin slices. It will be found a great assistance, in carving this joint well, if the knife be first inserted just above the bone at the bottom, and run sharply along between the bone and meat, and also to divide the meat from the bone in the same way at the side of the joint. The slices will then come away more readily. Some carvers cut the upper side of the sirloin across, as shown by the line from C to D ; but this is a wasteful plan, and one not to be recommended. With the sirloin, very finely-scraped horse- radish is usually served, and a little given, when liked, to each guest. Horseradish sauce is preferable, however, for serving on the plate, although the scraped horseradish may still be used as garnish. 958.-A ROUND OF BEEF. A round of beef, or ribs rolled, are not so easily carved as some joints, and to manage properly, a thin-bladed and very sharp knife is necessary. Off the outside of the joint, at its top, a thick slice should first be cut, so as to leave the surface smooth ; then thin and even slices should be cleverly carved in the direction of the line A to B ; and with each slice of the lean from the round a delicate morsel of the fat should be served.

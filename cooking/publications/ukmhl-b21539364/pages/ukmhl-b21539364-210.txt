In the hottest weather it should be turned out and scalded every day, but generally every day or two is enough, and in cold weather it may go on cooking with additions for the whole of a week. To make anything thoroughly boil is always the surest way of stopping fermentation ; to keep it luke warm the surest way of promoting it. Broth is more likely to ferment if it has vegetables in it. The amount of stock that can be made in this way astonishes most cooks. The stock-pot acts on the principle of the penny savings-bank. It also enables bones to be boiled as they very seldom are boiled. Most boiled meat is the better flavoured for being boiled in a stock-pot, and the stock-pot is always the better for the addition of meat liquor instead of water. However weak the stock is, it is always better to use it than water for soups and gravies. Vegetable stock is far better than none. White stAk is made of veal, and of bones that have been boiled once or contain only gelatine. No vegetable has of late gained so much in popularity as the tomato, nor is this surprising, now that it is so generally known what a valuable ingredient it forms in soups, salads and savoury dishes. We give recipes for tomato soups in “ Vegetarian Cookery ” as well as in the preceding chapter, but they may also be used with advantage in others, such as mulli- gatawny, to which the pleasant acid of the fruit is an im- provement. The tomato may fairly be considered a most generally useful vegetable, inasmuch as it can be cooked in such a variety of ways, while eaten raw, as a salad, it is most refreshing, and as a pickle, excellent. When fresh tomatoes are not to be had, tinned ones can be used for very many hot dishes, and answer extremely well for soup, for this vegetable is one of the best of the tinned imports. THE TOMATO.

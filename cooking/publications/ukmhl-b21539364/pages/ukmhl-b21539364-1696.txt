Place the quantity of bran required, according to the size of the poultice, upon the top of the boiling water, and when the heat has pene- trated the bran, stir it gently in. Pour off the superabundant water, and apply the poultice as hot as it can be borne. 3494. -BREAD POULTICE. Boil about | pint of water in a small, clean, lined saucepan.

Cut a slice of crumb of bread—the size required—out of a stale loaf, put it in a warmed basin, and pour upon it boiling water; leave it for a few minutes, with a plate over it, to soak. Then drain off all the water, spread the poultice on a piece of soft linen rag and apply it as hot as it can be borne. It is much neater and generally as efficacious to wrap up the poultice in fine muslin, so that the bread does not adhere to the skin, and the whole may be removed without any mess.

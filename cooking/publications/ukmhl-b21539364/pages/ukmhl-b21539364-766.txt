666 General Directions for Carving Poultry. remarked the very great difference in the large number of people whom a good carver will find slices for, and the comparatively few that a bad carver will succeed in serving. As we have stated in both the carving of a duck and goose, the carver should commence cutting slices close to the wing from B to C, and then proceed upwards towards the ridge of the breastbone : this is not the usual plan, but, in practice, will be found best. The breast is the only part which is looked on as fine in a turkey, the legs being very seldom cut off and eaten at the table : they are usually removed to the kitchen, where they are taken off, as here marked, to appear only in a form which seems to have a special attraction at a bachelor’s supper- table—we mean devilled: served in this way, they are especially liked and relished. The letters G C D show where the merrythought is placed, which can be removed in the same way as that of a fowl. A boiled turkey is carved in the same manner as when roasted.

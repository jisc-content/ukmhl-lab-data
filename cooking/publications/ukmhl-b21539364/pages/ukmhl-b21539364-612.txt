CHAPTER XVIII. GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON THE COMMON HOG. 1141 The Hog belongs to the order Mammalia, the genus Sus scrofa, and the species Pachydermata, or thick-skinned; and its generic characters are a small head, with long flexible snout, truncated; 42 teeth, divided into 4 upper incisors, converging, 6 lower incisors, projecting, 2 upper and 2 lower canine, or tusks, the former short, the latter projecting, formidable and sharp, and 14 molars in each jaw; cloven feet, furnished with 4 toes, and tail, small, short, and twisted; while, in some varieties, this appendage is altogether wanting, 1142. From the Number and Position of the Teeth, physiolo- gists arc enabled to define the nature and functions of the animal; and from those of the Sus, or hog, it is evident that he is as much a grinder as a biter, or can live as well on vegetable as on animal food; though a mixture of both is plainly indicated as the character of food most conducive to the integrity and health of its physical system. 1143. Thus the Pig Tribe of Mammals, though not ruminating, as might be inferred from the number of their molar teeth, is yet a link between the herbivorous and the carnivorous tribes, and is consequently what is known as omnivorous; or, in other words, capable of converting any kind of aliment into nutriment.

207 Relative Prices of Fish. TABLE OF RELATIVE PRICES OF FISH. Giving the real cost of Fish per lb. after deducting Bone, Waste and Loss of Weight by different modes of Cooking. Practical tests have been made of each fish in the following table, and very great care and ti-ouble has been taken to render them reliable and accurate, so that they may be really useful in estimating the actual relative value of the various kinds of fish. Many would fail to realise the great loss by bone and uneatable matter there is in most fish and how much they pay for actual food obtained. By consulting these tables it will be seen that such fish as soles and smelts are very expensive ones, also that some of the highest priced fish or parts of fish are not always the dearest. Thus, for example, a pound of flounders can be bought for 5d., but, by reason of the large amount of bone they contain they cost more than a pound of eels at ioi., while the so-called cheaper parts of salmon, yielding so much less actual eatable matter, are in reality not so economical as the best.

The relative loss per lb. will be the same whatever may have been the price given.

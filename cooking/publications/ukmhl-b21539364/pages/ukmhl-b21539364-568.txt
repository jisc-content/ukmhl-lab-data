482 General Observations on the Sheep and Lamb. usually subdivided in the manner shown in the sketch, in which the several joints are defined by the intervening lines and figures. SHEEP, SHOWING THE MODE OF CUTTING UP. Hind-Quarter 1. Leg. 2. Loin. 3. Chump end of loin. Fore-Quarter. 4. Best end of neck. 5. Scrag end of neck. 6 and 8. Shoulder and bladebone. 7. Breast. (1.) Leg.—This is the most economical joint for a family if it is sold, as is usual, at one penny a pound more than the shoulder, for unless there is a con- siderable difference in price it does not compensate for the greater proportion of bone in other joints. The leg of a sheep is roughly reckoned to weigh as many pounds as the whole sheep weighs in stones. Legs can be bought of all weights, from about five pounds to fifteen and sixteen. Mutton steaks are cut from the leg. (2.) Loin.—This is considered the best roasting joint. Two loins together make a saddle; rather a wasteful joint, because of the way it is carved. The upper part of the loin and leg together form a haunch. Chump chops are cut near the tail, where the proportion of bone is greater. (3.) Chump end of loin cut with the loins for a saddle, always roasted, or in chops for broiling. (4.) Best end of the neck.—Roasting, boiling, or for mutton cutlets, which it is more economical to trim at home than to buy ready trimmed. Small mutton is best for cutlets. (5.) Scrag end of the neck.—Broth, stews, or boiling. A low-priced joint, not very fat, but rather bony and wasteful.

Hutchinson’s Patent Coffee Mahers. - Another excellent contrivance for making really good and palatable coffee is to be fo Patent Coffee Maker, the invention of General Hutchinson, manufactured by Messrs Henry Loveridge and Co., and sold by all ironmongers in the United Kingdom and^he Colonies. It is made in four forms : the Matinee, for bedroom use and for making a cup of coffee in the early morning, and, indeed at any time when it may be required; the Cafet.ere in two kinds, one plain and the other ornamental, and the Urn, a large coffee maker for family use. The Urn and the plain Cafetiere are shown in the illustrations given in page 85. the capacities and prices of coffee makers, in each form, are as follows. Pints 1 1 H 2 3 4 5 Matinde IS5- Cafetiere, Plain — Cafetiere, Ornamental — Urn — The Matinees, of which the prices are given, are of planished tin : they may be had in polished brass at 273. and 29s. each. The ornamental form of the Cafetiere is nickel plated. The action of these coffee makers is simple and efficient. The coffee is put into the upper, or filtering portion, and boiling water is poured on it. After standing for four or five minutes, the tap is turned and the infusion is allowed to run through into the lower part, from which it is poured out perfectly free from grounds and as clear pure and bright as wine The full aroma of the coffee-berry is preserved and its pleasant and delicate aromatic flavour distinctly perceptible in the infusion, even to the last drop. The water is kept in contact with the coffee until it is required for use, which renders this coffee maker superior to all other percolators in which the water passes quickly through the coffee without having time to become fully impregnated with the odour and nutritive properties of the berry. 182. Ash’s Patent “ Piston ” Freezing Machine.—Ice is now so much used at English tables that it has become a necessary of household economy, and dessert ices follow summer dinners as a matter of course. Dessert ices are, by modern invention and ingenuity, placed within the reach of most house- keepers, and it is both pleasant and easy to make the ices by Mr. Ash s Patent “ Piston " Freezing Machine, which affords a quick, economical, and most simple method of freezing. Two ices, or an ice and an ice pudding can be made at the same time by this machine. The mixture to be iced is placed in the tubes or cylinders ; outside these tubes rough ice and salt are placed, the ice being pounded, and the salt and a little water added ; the piston is then worked up and down This movement produces a constant change and agitation of lhe ice and salt which is compelled to pass round and round the agitator Two stirrers are attached to the piston, and work at the same time with it ; these ' stirrers go up and down inside the cylinders, and stir up and mix the cream or water mix- ture undergoing the freezing process. This agitation of the cream, &c is neces- sary to prevent the future ice from being lumpy and snowy. When the freezing is complete, the stirrers are taken out of the cylinders and the ice pressed down firmly by a presser; this moulds it to the form of the cylinder. It is set by

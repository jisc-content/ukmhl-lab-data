Mode.—As pork does not keep long without being salted, cut it into pieces of a suitable size as soon as the pig is cold. Rub the pieces of pork well with salt, and put them into a pan with a sprinkling of it between each piece ; as it melts on the top, strew on more. Lay a coarse cloth over the pan, a board over that, and a weight on the board, to keep the pork down in the brine. If excluded from the air, it will continue good for nearly 2 years. Average Cost, 9 d. per lb. for the prime parts. Seasonable.—The best time for pickling meat is late in the autumn. The Universality of the Hog.—A singular circumstance in the domestic history of the hog is the extent of its distribution over the surface of the earth ; being found even in insulated places, where the inhabitanis are semi-barbarous, and where the wild species is entirely unknown. The South Sea Islands, for example, were found on their discovery to be well stocked with a small black hog; and the traditionary belief of the people was that these animals were coeval with the origin of themselves. Yet they possessed no knowledge of the wild boar, or any other animal of the hog kind, from which the domestic breed might be supposed to be derived. In these islands the hog is the principal quadruped, and the fruit of the bread-tree is its principal food, although it is also fed with yams, eddoes and other vegetables. This nutritious diet, which it has in great abundance, is, according to Foster, the reason of its flesh being so delicious, so full of juice, and so rich in fat, which is not less delicate to the taste than the finest butter. 1215.—TO BOIL PICKLED PORK. Ingredients.—Pork ; water. Mode.—Should the pork be very salt, let it remain in water about 2 hours before it is dressed; put it into a saucepan with sufficient cold water to cover it, let it gradually come to a boil, then gently simmer until quite tender. Allow ample time for it to cook, as nothing is more disa- greeable than underdone pork, and when boiled fast, the meat becomes hard. This is sometimes served with boiled poultry and roast veal, instead of bacon; when tender, and not over salt, it will be found equally good. Time.—A piece of pickled pork weighing 2 lbs., ij hour; 4 lbs., rather more than 2 hours. Average Cost, 9 d. per lb. for the primest parts. Seasonable at any time.

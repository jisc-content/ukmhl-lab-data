Carving of Leg of Mutton. 519 1136.—LEG OF MUTTON. This homely, but capital English joint is almost invariably served a*, table as shown in the engraving. The carving of it is not very difficult: the knife should be carried sharply down in the direc- tion of the line from A to B, and slices taken from either side, as the guests may desire, some liking the knuckle-end, as well done, and others preferring the more underdone part. The fat should be sought near the line C to D. Some connoisseurs are fond of having this joint dished with the under-side uppermost, so as to get at the finely-grained meat lying under that part of the joint known as the Pope’s eye ; but this is an extravagant fashion, and one that will hardly find favour in the eyes of many economical British housewives and house- keepers. LEG OF MUTTON. 1137.-LOIN OF MUTTON. There is one point in connection with carving a loin of mutton which includes every other; that is, that the joint should be thoroughly well jointed by the butcher before it is cooked. This knack of jointing requires practice and the proper tools; and no one but the butcher is supposed to have these. If the bones be not well jointed, the carving of a loin of mutton is not a gracious business ; whereas, if that has been attended to, it is an easy and untroublesome task. The knife should be inserted at A, and after feeling your way between the bones, it should be carried sharply in the direction of the line A to B. As there are some people who prefer the outside cut, while others do not like it, the question as to their choice of this should be asked.

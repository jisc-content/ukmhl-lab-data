Ingredients.—I chicken, or a small neck of mutton divided into cutlets, 6 large onions, 2 mangoes, 6 oz. of butter, rice, seasoning. Mode.— Peel and chop the onions and slice the mangoes, and put them into a stewpan with 4 oz. of the butter and the seasoning. Cut the chicken into joints and fry in the other 2 oz. of butter, then put it into the stewpan and let the whole stew for about an hour. Boil some rice as for curry, lay it on a hot-water dish, over this the joints of fowl, and again over this pour the sauce. Instead of preparing the rice in the ordinary way, it may be dressed as follows :— Wash three-quarters of a pound of rice, and boil it gently for a quarter of an hour in 1 pint of stock, then pour off the gravy, add 3 oz. of fresh butter to the rice, and stir over a quick fire until it is brightly and deepty coloured ; then moisten with a little stock, and season with a pinch of mixed sweet herbs, a pinch of grated nutmeg, and the thin rind of half a lemon. Simmer again until the rice is quite tender, without being broken, lift out the lemon rind, and add a quarter of a pint of thick cream. Spread half the rice on a hot dish, lay the pieces of meat or chicken upon it, squeeze a little lemon- juice upon them, and cover with the remainder of the rice. Garnish with hard-boiled eggs. 2875.-DUMPOKE. Ingredients.—1 chicken, forcemeat made from rice and fresh herbs with seasoning.

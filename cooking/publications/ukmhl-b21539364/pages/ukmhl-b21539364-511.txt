Ribs of Beef. 427 954.—BRISKET OF BEEF. There is but little description necessary to add, to show the carving of a boiled brisket of beef, be- yond the engraving here inserted. The only point to be observed is that the joint should be cut evenly and firmly quite across the bones, so that on its re-ap- pearance at table, it should not have a jagged and untidy look. 955.-BEEF TONGUE. Passing the knife down in the direction of from A to B, a not too thin slice should be helped ; and the carving of a tongue may be continued in this way until the best portions of the upper side are served. The fat which lies about the root of the tongue can be served by turning the tongue, and cutting in the direction of from C to D. BEEF TONGUE. 956.—RIBS OF BEEF. This dish resembles the sirloin, except that it has no fillet or undercut. As explained in the recipes, the end piece is often cut off, salted and boiled. The mode of carv- ing is similar to that of the sirloin, viz., in the direc- tion of the dotted line from A to B. This joint will be the more easily cut if the plan be pursued which is suggested in carv- ing the sirloin ; namely, the inserting of the knife immediately between the RIBS 0F bone and the meat, before commencing to cut it into slices. All joints of roast beef should be cut in even and thin slices, Horseradish, finely scraped, may be served as a garnish; but horseradish sauce is preferable fbr eating with the beef.

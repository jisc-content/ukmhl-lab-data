983 Caramel Sugar. 2117—CANDY OR THREAD SUGAR. (1st Degree.) Ingredients.—I lb. of lump sugar, 1 gill of water. Mode.—Having clarified the sugar by recipe, No. 2116, put it over the fire and let it boil until smooth ; dip the hand into cold water, dip the skimmer into the sugar, touch it with thumb and forefinger, and instantly open them, when a fine short thread of sugar will form; a few minutes’ more boiling and the thread will be longer and stronger, and has attained the first degree. 2118. —"SOUFFLE” SUGAR. (2nd Degree.) Boil the sugar still longer, then dip in the skimmer and blow the sugar off into the pan. If boiled long enough, bubbles will form on the holes of the skimmer.

Set the pan into another of cold water, and the caramel is then ready for use.

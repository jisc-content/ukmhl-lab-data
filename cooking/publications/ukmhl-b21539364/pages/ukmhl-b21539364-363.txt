283 Pish Carving. Note.—Many persons, in carving salmon, make the mistake of slicing the thick part of this fish in the opposite direction to that we have stated ; and thus, by the breaking of the flakes, the beauty of its appearance is destroyed. 607.-BOILED OR FRIED SOLE. The usual way of helping this fish is to cut it quite through, bone and all, distributing it in nice and not too large pieces. A moderately-sized sole will be sufficient for three slices; namely, the head, middle and tail. The guests should be asked which of these they prefer. A small one will only give two slices, a very large one may afford four. The thick part is generally thought better than head or tail. The head should be cut off, not laid on a guest’s plate. In helping Filleted Soles, one fillet is given to each person. (For mode of serving, see Coloured Plate A.) 608.—TURBOT. First run the fish-slice down the thickest part of the fish, quite through to the bone, from a to b, and then cut handsome and regular slices in the direction of the lines downwards, from c to ef and upwards from c to d, as shown in the en- graving. When the car- ver has removed all the meat from the upper side of the fish, the backbone should be raised, put on one side of the dish, and the under side helped as the upper. A Brill and John Dory are carved in the same manner as a turbot. Of the latter the head is the best part. Note.—The thick parts of the middle of the back are the best slices in a turbot ; and the rich gelantinous skin covering the fish, as well as a little of the thick part of the fins, are dainty morsels, and should be placed on each plate.

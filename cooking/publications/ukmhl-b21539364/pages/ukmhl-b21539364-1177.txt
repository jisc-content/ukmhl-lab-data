RECIPES FOR MAKING ICES AND CONFECTIONERY. CHAPTER XXXVIII. 2295.—TO FREEZE WITH OR WITHOUT A MACHINE. Ingredients.—Ice, half its weight in bay salt. Mode.—Break up the ice into pieces and put it in the outer receptacle in alternate layers with the salt. Put the mixture to be frozen in the inner receptacle, and let it be well covered with the freezing mixture. Stir or shake the mixture that you want to make ice of until it begins to set. If then it is to be served in rough pieces on plates, there is nothing more to be done; but if it is to be turned out of a mould, it must be moulded before it gets too hard, when it would not fill up the interstices and take a good shape, and then the mould must be set in the ice again, but this time without stirring. If fruit is to be set in the ice, it must be kept in a refrigerator until the last moment, and then set as a jelly mould is set. To turn it out, dip it into cold, but not freezing water. Time.—20 to 25 minutes. Average Cost of freezing, 2d. Sufficient.—I pint for 7 or 8 people. Seasonable at any time. 2296.—TO FREEZE WITH FREEZING MIXTURE. Ingredients.—I measure of each freezing powder, and one measure of water. Mode.—Proceed to freeze by preceding recipe, No. 2295, using the above mixture in place of the ice and salt. * Time.—30 minutes. Average Cost, 3d. Sufficient to freeze 2 pints of cream ice and 2 pints of block ice. Seasonable at any time.

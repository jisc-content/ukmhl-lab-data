96b Dessert Dishes and Small Savouries. 2068.—CURRANTS, CHERRIES, GOOSEBERRIES, OR RASPBERRIES. These small fruits look well in fruit baskets, the handles of which may be twined with green creeper. Currants may be mixed with good effect, cherries and raspberries may be arranged like strawberries, with the stalks turned inwards, and, should, like them, be piled in rows to form a pyramid.

These are merely arranged piled high in the centre of the dish, with or without leaves round the edge. Filberts should always be served with the outer skin or husk on them; and walnuts should be well wiped with a damp cloth, and then with a dry one, to remove the unpleasant sticky

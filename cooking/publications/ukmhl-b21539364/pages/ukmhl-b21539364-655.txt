Carving of Loin. 563 slicing pieces off inside the hole, gradually enlarging the circle; but we think this a plan not to be recommended. A ham, either hot or cold, is sent to table with a paper ruffle round the knuckle. 1226.-LEG OF PORK. This joint, which is such a favourite one with many people, is easy to carve. The knife should be carried sharply down to the bone, clean through the crackling, in the direction of the line a to b. Sage and onion and apple sauce are usually sent to table with this dish—sometimes the leg of pork is stuffed—and the guests should be asked if they will have either or both. A frequent plan, and we think a good one, is now pursued of sending sage and onion to table separately from the joint, as it is not everybody to whom the flavour of this leg of pork. stuffing is agreeable. 1227.—LOIN OF PORK. As with a loin of mutton, it is essential a loin of pork must be properly jointed before cooking, and the crackling must be scored. These points being at- tended to, there is no diffi- culty in carving the joint. The knife should be inserted at fig. a, and carried be- tween the bones along the dotted line to fig. b, dividing loin of pork. the joint into neat and even chops. Note.—The 6ther dishes of pork do not call for any special remarks as to their Carving or helping.

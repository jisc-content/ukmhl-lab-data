This invention is designed to meet an almost universal and daily want, viz., the means of Cooking, with^ certainty and precision, all the various sorts of Potatoes, Peas, Beans, Spinach, Cauliflower, Cabbage, Tur- nips, &c. The great advantage is that whatever is being steamed is kept entirely free from condensed steam, the condensation taking place on the outer body only, the tray being per- fectly dry, so that the vegetables after they are thoroughly cooked can be kept in the steamer for three-quarters of an hour without deteriorating in the slightest degree. The oval-shaped steamer is specially well adapted for cooking fish, such as Cod, Salmon, Whiting, &c. For instance, how often is the last named, by being left a few minutes too long in the water or steam^ spoiled ; but in this vessel the fish can be raised when partially boiled and finished, and kept waiting In the steamer dry and delicious. . DIRECTIONS .—The Diagrams clearly indicate the working of it.

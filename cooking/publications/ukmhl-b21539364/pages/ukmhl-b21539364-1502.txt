Note.—In Dinner No. 1, starting with the soup, which will take f hour, next by getting the soles and ptarmigan ready and putting them into the oven, it will be seen that there is time to broil the steak and to make a compote of tinned apricots cut in slices, with a little syrup or sugar and some white wine, also to make the sauce and have all ready in the time given. In Dinner No. 2, the soup takes less time, but the olives and haricot take a little time to prepare, while the jam tart takes the longest to cook, and should be started first. Sponge-cakes cut in slices and spread with jam may take its place, while stock can be quickly made with Liebig or other meat essence.

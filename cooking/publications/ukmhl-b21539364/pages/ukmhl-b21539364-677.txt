Singeing. 583 1270.â€”TO SINGE POULTRY. Hold the bird by the neck with the left hand, as shown in illustration, and with the right hand singe off all small feathers left on the bird with a lighted paper, moving this quickly so as not to scorch the bird. In this singeing those parts that will be hidden after the bird is trussed must be carefully gone over, but it is usual to again singe after trussing. In large kitchens there is sometimes a gas-tube, which is very convenient for singeing poultry, avoid- ing any chance of burning or scorching during the operation; but a lighted paper carefully used is all that is ac- tually necessary. It is an error to depend upon this singeing to take away the feathers that have been carelessly left in plucking ; if any should appear they must be pulled out, not singed off, or we may impart to the bird a disagreeable odour of burnt feathers. Birds that have been hanging for a day or two are very easily plucked, the feathers coming out readily ; but in hot weather, or when a fowl is required at short notice and has to be plucked directly it is killed, some little trouble may 1271.-TO TRUSS A FOWL In order to draw the bird properly it is well to know where to find the different parts of the inside.

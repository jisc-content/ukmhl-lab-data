RECIPES FOR COOKING MILK, BUTTER, CHEESE AND EGGS. CHAPTER XLII. 2575 -SEPARATION OF MILK AND CREAM. Mode.—If it be desired that the milk should be freed entirely from cream, it is generally poured into a very shallow broad pan or dish, not more than inch deep, so that the cream has not to rise through a great depth of milk. A system of deep set- ting is common in America, but is not much in vogue here. In cold and wet weather, milk is not so rich as it is in summer and warm weather, and the morning’s milk is always richer than the evening’s. The last-drawn milk of each milking, at all times and sea- sons, is richer than the first-drawn, and on that account should be set apart for cream. Milk should be shaken as little as possible when carried from the cow to the dairy, and should be strained into the pans very gently. Persons not keeping cows may always have a little cream, provided the milk they purchase be pure and unadulterated. As soon as it comes in, it should be poured into very shallow open pie-dishes, and set by in a very cool place, and in 7 or 8 hours a nice cream should have risen to the surface. Milk is the most complete of all articles of food ; that is to say, it contains all the elements which enter into the composition of the human body. 11 often disagrees with people of sedentary habits or bilious temperament. But, if exercise can be taken and a little patience shown, while the system accommodates itself to a new regimen, this article of diet is excellent for the majority of people; especially for those who have suffered much from emotional disturbances, or whose stomachs are in a relaxed condition owing to disease or to unhealthy modes of life. But there are really constitutions which cannot take to it; and they should not be forced. Of milk in the sick' room we speak in another place.

141 Vegetable Soups. Most cooks put in a couple of lumps of sugar when heating the soup for table. Note.—The rule is, that all clear soups should be of a light sherry-colour, and should not savour too strongly of the meat; and that all white or brown thick soups should have no more consistency than will enable them to adhere slightly to the spoon when hot. All purees should be somewhat thicker. Ingredients.—4 lbs. of lean beef or veal, £ a scrag of mutton, 8 oz. of vermicelli, 4 blades of mace, 6 cloves, £ lb. of sweet almonds, the yolks of 6 eggs, 1 gill of thick cream, 3 quarts of water. Mode.—Boil the beef, or veal, and the mutton, gently in water that will cover them, till the gravy is very strong and the meat very tender; then strain off the gravy, and set it on the fire with the specified quan- tities of vermicelli, mace and cloves, to 2 quarts. Let it boil till it has the flavour of the spices. Have ready the almonds, blanched and pounded very fine; the yolks of the eggs boiled hard; mixing the almonds, whilst pounding, with a little of the soup, lest the latter should grow oily. Pound them till they are a mere pulp, and keep adding to them, by degrees, a little soup, until they are thoroughly mixed together. Let the soup be cool when mixing, and do it perfectly smooth. Strain it through a sieve, set it on the fire, stir frequently, and serve hot. Just before taking it up, add the cream. Serve with sippets of fried bread. Time.—3 hours. Average Cost. 2 s. Der auart.

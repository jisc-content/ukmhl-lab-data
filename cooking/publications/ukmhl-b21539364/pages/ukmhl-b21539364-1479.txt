Glass Stands for Plants. 1345 3061. Plant Decoration.—Where expense and time are an object, both can be saved by employing delicate-looking ferns and other plants for table use, for so many lovely receptacles are made for them of china and glass that they look in many cases as pretty as flowers, in fact, prettier than flowers, unless the latter be most tastefully ar- ranged. On this page will be found illustrated three stands for holding ferns, the large, low one of which is suitable for a centre piece, and the two others, the shells, for corners. Maiden-, hair would look, perhaps, prettier in these than the ferns with which they are filled, but it would not stand the heat so well. Such vases as these, being more often than not of pure white china, look well placed upon a dessert centre cloth of richly-tinted plush or velvet, chosen in harmony with the dinner-service to be used. Of such vases as these for a small table four corner and a centre one might be sufficient. On a larger and rather long table, three vases, at least, would be needed to go down the centre and two on either side, thus outlining the shape of the table with the flower-stands. The stands for plants may be of any material. Although not so new as some of the other designs, the rustic glass stands, lined with plate glass, are extremely CENTRE BOWL. NAUTILUS STAND. pretty. Some of these are shown on page 1346, and also on that page appears one of these gracefully-formed vases of white china, called the “ Cactus," the faintly tinted flowers standing out well. Other pretty small plant, or fern vases, may be had of terra cotta and coloured china.

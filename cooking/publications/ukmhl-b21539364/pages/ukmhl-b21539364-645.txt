Mode.—Bacon for larding should be firm and fat, and ought to be cured without any saltpetre, as this reddens white meats. Lay it on a table, the rind downwards ; trim off any rusty part, and cut it into slices of any equal thickness. Place the slices one on the top of another, and cut them evenly into narrow strips, so arranging it that every piece of bacon is of the same size. Bacon for fricandeaux, poultry and game, should be about 2 inches in length, and rather more than one-eighth of an inch in width, or loin of veal, the pieces of bacon must be thicker. The following recipe of Soyer is, we think, very explicit; and any cook, by following the direc- tions here given, may be able to lard, if not well, sufficiently for general use. “ Have the fricandeau trimmed, lay it, lengthwise, upon a clean napkin across your hand, forming a kind of bridge with your thumb at the part you are about to commence at; then with the point of the larding-needle tnake three distinct lines across, half an inch apart; run the needle into the third line, at the further side of the fricandeau, and bring it out at the first, placing one of the lardoons in it; draw the needle through, leaving out a quarter of an inch of the bacon at each line ; proceed thus to the BACON FOR LARDING, AND LARDING-NEEDLE.

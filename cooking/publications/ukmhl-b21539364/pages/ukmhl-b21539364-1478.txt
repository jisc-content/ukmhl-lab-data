A FLORAL TABLE. CHAPTER LXIII. TABLE DECORATIONS. 3060. The decoration of tables at the present time is almost universal, and so does the taste for it grow and develop, that what was formerly left in the hands of the head servants in large establishments, who had no difficulty in packing the heavy epergnes with fruit or flowers, now forms a wide field of labour for artistic taste and skill. Hostesses in the season vie with each other as to whose table shall be the most elegant, and are ready to spend almost, if not quite, as much upon the flowers as upon the dinner itself, employing for the floral arrangement people who devote their time to this pleasant occupation. Home decoration is practised by those who have the time, which very fashion- able people can rarely spare, for its accomplishment, and we can imagine no household duty more attractive to the ladies of the house than that of making their tables beautiful with the exquisite floral produce of the different seasons, exercising their taste in devising new ways for employing the materials at their command Young people should have the taste for arranging flowers encouraged, and be allowed to assist in table decorations

1346 Table Decorations. 3032. Floivers for decoration should be those which are not very strongly scented. To some the perfume of such flowers as gardenias, stepha- notis, hyacinths and others is not offensive, blit to others the strong scent in a heated room, especially during dinner, is not to be borne. Otherwise, there is no dictating what the flowers should be. It is well to avoid many colours in one decoration, for, even if well grouped, they are seldom as effective as one or two mixed with white and green. It is a fashion to have a single colour for a dinner- table decoration, this being often chosen of the same tint as the hostess’s dress or the hangings of the room, though these are sometimes varied to suit the flowers. Again, all white flowers are very often employed, relieved by plenty of foliage. 3063. Vases and Flowers. — If there are vases of all kinds to select from, then almost any kind of flower can be used, but few people have many sets for dinner-table decorations. Some prefer rustic fern stand. low decorations, others high ones, but there is one rule that should always be in force, and that is, that the flowers and their receptacles should never interfere with the line of vision, but be above or below it. The great objection to the tpergnes of olden days was that they hid the guests from one another. If the vases be coloured ones, of glass or china, let the flowers, if they cannot be had of a corresponding tone, be white only, mixed with foliage. If the vases CACTUS VASE. RUSTIC GLASS BASKET. be of white china, use coloured flowers. If they are high stands, use those flowers which are naturally of high growth, with long stems ; if low, the reverse. Roses look always best in low stands or bowls, or in specimen tubes where only a single flower is placed.

Carving of Pheasant, 701 1437.—PARTRIDGES. There are several ways of carving this most familiar game bird. The more usual and summary mode is to carry the knife sharply along the top of the breast-bone of the bird, and cut it quite through, thus dividing it into two precisely equal and similar parts, in the same manner as carving a pigeon. Another plan is to cut it into three pieces, viz., by severing a small wing and leg on either side from the body, by following the line B to A in rhe upper woodcut; thus making two help- ings, when the breast will remain for a third plate. The most elegant manner is that of thrusting back the body from the legs, and then cutting through the breast in the direction shown by the line A to B : this plan will give four or more helpings if necessary. 1438.—PHEASANT. Fixing the fork in the breast, let the carver cut slices from it in the direction of the lines from A to B : these are the prime pieces. If there be more guests to satisfy than these slices will serve, then let the legs and wings be disengaged as in carving a fowl, following the dotted line to remove the latter first; the point where the wing joins the neckbone being carefully found. The merrythought will come off in the same way as that of a fowl. The most valued parts are the same as those which are preferred in a fowl. 1439.—SNIPE. One of these small but delicious birds may be given whole to a gentleman; but in helping a lady, it will be better to cut them quite through the centre, from A to B, com- pletely dividing them into equal and like portions, and put only one half on the plate. sims.

Loin of Veal. 47i 1037.â€”KNUCKLE OF VEAL. The engraving, showing the dotted line from A to B, sufficiently indicates the direction which should be given to the knife in carv- ing this dish. The best slices are those from the thickest part of the knuckle, that is, outside the line A to B. KNUCKLE OF VEAL. 1038.-LOIN OF VEAL. As is the case with a loin of mutton, the careful jointing of a loin of veal is more than half the battle in carving it. If the butcher be negligent in this matter, he should be admonished; for there is nothing more annoying or irritating to an inexperi- enced carver than to be obliged to turn his knife in all directions to find the exact place where it should be inserted in order to divide the bones. When jointing is properly per- formed, there is little diffi- culty in carrying the knife down in the direction of the line A to B. To each guest should be given a piece of the kidney and kidney-fat, which lie underneath, and are considered great delicacies. LOIN OF VEAL.

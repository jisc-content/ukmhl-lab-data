The quantity of fruits to allow for a dinner for eighteen persons would be one large pine or two smaller ones, one very large melon or three of the very small ones. If grapes were added, two good-sized dishes, at least, would be needed. Dried fruit, such as almonds and raisins and small dishes of crystallised fruit, would also form part of the dessert. 2.

In a party a Menu for six serves equally well for treble that number, but it is usual to have a choice of both soups and fish where there are a large number of guests.

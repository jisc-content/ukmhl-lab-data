Two together correspond to saddle of mutton, and is known as a baron of beef, but is very seldom seen. Almost invariably roasted, and for that purpose considered the best joint. Some of the kidney suet is always taken away, and some persons cook the under-cut or roll separately, instead of roasting it with the sirloin. The under-cut can seldom be bought alone, but if it can it is better than any part for entrees, such as grenadines, olives, &c. (2.) Rump.— Broiling steaks should be cut from here, but very often are not. For stewing, steak from another part does as well, and costs several pence less. Also roasted. A first-rate joint for any purpose, (3.) Aitchbone.—Often salted and boiled.

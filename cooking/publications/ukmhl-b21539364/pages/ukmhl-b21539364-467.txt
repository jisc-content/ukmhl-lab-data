RECIPES FOR COOKING BEEF. CHAPTER XIII. 863.—BAKED BEEF. (Fr.—Boeuf.) (Cold Meat Cookery.) Ingredients.—About 2 lbs. of cold roast beef, 2 small onions, 1 large carrot or 2 small ones, 1 turnip, a small bunch of savoury herbs, salt and pepper to taste, 12 tablespoonfuls of gravy, 3 tablespoonfuls of ale, crust of mashed potatoes. Mode.—Cut the beef in slices, allowing a small amount of fat to each slice; place a layer of this in the bottom of a pie-dish, with a portion of the onions, carrots and turnips, which must be sliced ; mince the herbs, strew them over the meat, and season with pepper and salt. Then put another layer of meat, vegetables, and seasoning ; and proceed in this manner until all the ingredients are used. Pour in the gravy and ale (water may be substituted for the former,but it is not so nice), cover with a crust or mashed potatoes, and bake for half an hour, or rather longer. Time.—Rather more than J hour. Average Cost, exclusive of the meat and gravy, 4d. Sufficient for 5 or 6 persons. Seasonable at any time. Note.—It is as well to parboil the carrots and turnips before adding them to the meat, and-to use some of the liquor in which they were boiled as a substi- tute for gravy; that is to say, when there is no gravy at hand. Be particular to cut the onions in very thin slices. 864.-BAKED BEEF. (Cold Meat Cookery. Another Mode.)

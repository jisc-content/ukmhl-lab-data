945 Sweet Omelet Seasonable at any time. Mode.—Mince the ham very finely, without any fat, and fry it for 2 minutes in a little butter ; then make the batter for the omelet, stir in the ham, and proceed as directed in recipe No. 2015.

Mix the ingredients for the omelet the same as in recipe No. 2015, and when the eggs are well whisked, stir in the pieces of kidney.

Slip it carefully on to a very hot dish, or what is a much safer method, put a dish on the omelet, and turn the pan quickly over. It should be served the instant it comes from the fire.

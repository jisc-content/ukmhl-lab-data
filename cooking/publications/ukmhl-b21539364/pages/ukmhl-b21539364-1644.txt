1502 Recipes for the Use of Domestic Servants. 3328.-TO CLEAN PLATE. (A nother way.) Mix to a paste Â£ lb. of prepared chalk with 2 dr. of spirits of camphor, 1 dr. of ammonia, 1 oz. of turpentine and a dessertspoonful of spirits. When the silver is clean and dry, dab on the paste with a sponge and leave it to dry before brushing off. 3329.-PLATE RAGS FOR DAILY USE. Boil soft rags (nothing is better for the purpose than the tops of old cotton stockings) in a mixture of new milk and hartshorn powder, in the proportion of 1 oz. of powder to a pint of milk ; boil them for 5 minutes ; wring them, as soon as they are taken out, for a moment in cold water, and dry them before the fire. With these rags rub the plate briskly as soon as it has been well washed and dried after daily use. A most beautiful deep polish will be produced, and the plate will require nothing more than merely to be dusted with a leather or a dry, soft cloth before it is again put on the table. 3330-LAMP TRIMMING. Lamp-trimming requires a thorough acquaintance with the mechanism after that, constant attention to cleanliness, and an occasional entire clearing out with hot water ; when this is done, all the parts should be carefully dried before filling again with oil. When lacquered, wipe the lacquered parts with a soft brush and cloth, and wash occasionally with weak soap-suds, wiping carefully afterwards. Brass lamps may be cleaned with oil and rottenstone every day when trimmed. With bronze and other ornamental lamps, more care will be required, and soft flannel and oil only used, to prevent the re- moval of the bronze or enamel. Brass-work or any metal work not lacquered is cleaned by a little oil and rottenstone made into a paste, or BISCUIT BOX.

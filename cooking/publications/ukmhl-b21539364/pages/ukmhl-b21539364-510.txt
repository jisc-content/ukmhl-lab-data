426 General Directions for Carving Beef1 952.—STEWED BEEF or RUMP-STEAK. (Fr.—Bifteck a la Sauce Piquante.) Ingredients.—About 2 lbs. of beef or rump-steak, 3 onions, 2 turnips, 3 carrots, 2 or 3 oz. of butter, £ pint of water, 1 teaspoonful of salt, £ tea- spoonful of pepper, 1 tablespoonful of ketchup, 1 tablespoonful of flour. Mode.—Have the steaks cut tolerably thick and rather lean; divide them into convenient-sized pieces, and fry them in the butter a nice brown on both sides. Cleanse and pare the vegetables, cut the onions and car- rots into thin slices, and the turnips into dice, and fry these in the same fat that the steaks were done in. Put all into a saucepan, add half a pint of water, or rather more should it be necessary, and simmer very gently for z\ or 3 hours ; when nearly done, skim well, add salt, pepper and ketchup in the above proportions, and thicken with a tablespoonful of flonr mixed with 2 of cold water. Let it boil up for a minute or two after the thickening is added, and serve. When a vegetable scoop is at hand, use it to cut the vegetables in fanciful shapes ; and tomato, Harvey’s sauce, or walnut-liquor may be used to flavour the gravy. It is less rich if stewed the previous day, so that the fat may be taken off when cold; when wanted for table, it will merely require warming through. Time.— 3 hours. Average Cost, is. to is. 2d. per lb. Sufficient for 6 persons. Seasonable at any time. GENERAL DIRECTIONS FOR CARVING BEEF. 953.-AITCHBONE OF BEEF. AITCHBONE OF BEEF-. A boiled aitchbone of beef is not a difficult joint to carve, as will be seen on reference to the accom- panying engraving. By following with the knife the direction of the line from A to B, nice slices will be easily cut. It may be necessary, as in a round of beef, to cut a slice off the outside before commencing to serve.

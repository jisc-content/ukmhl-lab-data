1269 Fruit Drinks. Mode.—These small silvery fish somewhat resemble whitebait, although a trifle larger. They are run on sticks, sprinkled with flour and a little salt, then fried in boiling lard as whitebait. They should be very crisp and dry. They are served with fresh cut green limes, instead of lemons as here, and are sent to table on the sticks, which are run through their heads, or, with greater elegance, strung upon a thin silver skewer. 2882.—TAMARIND SAUCE. Ingredients.—Fruit, a little pounded loaf sugar. Mode.—Fill a stone jar with thoroughly ripe tamarinds, and put into a cool oven until quite tender, adding during the stewing enough sugar, but not more than enough, to take away the extreme acidity of the fruit, then rub through a sieve. 2883.—FRUIT DRINKS. Ingredients for Pomegranate Drink.—4 pomegranates, £ lb. of pounded loaf sugaf, x pint of water, the juice of 2 limes. Mode.—Put the red pips of the fruit into a basin with the sugar, bruise all together, pour over the water, then the lime-juice and strain several times through muslin. Ingredients for Lime-juice Drink.—Fresh limes, iced water, loaf sugar, a little liqueur. Mode.—Squeeze the juice from the limes, strain it, and add pounded sugar to taste, and a little flavouring of liqueur, if liked. Put a little of this mixture in a glass, and fill up with water. All the cups, such as champagne and claret cup, are improved by the introduction of slices of fresh fruit, such as apricots or pine-apple.

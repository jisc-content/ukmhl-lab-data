521 Carving of Quarter of Lamb. 1140,—FORE QUARTER OF LAMB. We always think that a good and practised carver delights in the manipulation of this joint, for there is a little field for his judgment and dexterity which does not always occur. The separa- tion of the shoulder from the breast is the first point to be attended to ; this is done by passing the knife slightly round the dotted line, as shown by the letters A, B, C, D and E, so as to cut through the skin, and then, by raising with a little force the shoulder, fore-quarter of lamb. into which the fork should be firmly fixed, it will come away with just a little more exercise of the knife. In dividing the shoulder and breast the carver should take care not to cut away too much of the meat from the latter, as that would rather spoil its appearance when the shoulder is removed. The breast and shoulder being separated, it is usual to lay a small piece of butter, and sprinkle a little cayenne, lemon-juice and salt between them ; and when this is melted and incorporated with the meat and gravy, the shoulder may, as more convenient, be removed into another dish. The next operation is to separate the ribs from the brisket, by cut- ting through the meat on the line F to E. The joint is then ready to be •served to the guests ; the ribs being carved in the direction of the lines from I to K, and the brisket from G. to H. The carver should ask those at the table what parts they prefer, ribs, brisket—or a piece of shoulder. Leg of Lamb, Loin of Lamb, Saddle of Lamb, Shoulder of Lamb are carved in the same manner as the corresponding joints of mutton. (See Nos. 1136, 1137, 1138, 1139.)

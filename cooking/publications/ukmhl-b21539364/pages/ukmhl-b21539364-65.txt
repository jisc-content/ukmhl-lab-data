All the domestics mentioned in the above table would enter into the establishment of a wealthy nobleman. The number of servants, of course, would become smaller in proportion to the lesser size of the establishment. The follow- ing is a scale of servants suited to various incomes, commencing with— About £1,000 a-year—Cook, upper and under housemaid, man servant. About £750 a-year—Cook, housemaid, and man servant. About £500 a-year—Cook, housemaid, and foot-boy. About £300 a-year—Cook and housemaid. About £200 or £150 a-year—General servant, or girl for rough work. Tf there be any children, where the income will allow of it, nurses will be required in addition to the servants named. In the case of very moderate incomes a nurse sometimes combines the duties of housemaid if there are not many children, while in other cases it is necessary to keep a nurse instead of a housemaid, and let the plain cook be a general servant. 18. Daily Duties.—Having thus indicated some of the more general duties of the mistress, relative to the moral government of her household, we will now give a few specific instructions on matters having a more practical relation to the position which she is supposed to occupy in the eye of the world. To do this the more clearly, we will begin with her earliest duties, and take her completely through the occupations of the day. 19. Before Breakfast.—Having risen early, as we have already advised (set 3), and made a careful toilet, it will be well at once to see that the children, if there are any, have received proper care, and are in every way clean, comfort- able, and being well attended to. The first meal of the day, breakfast, will then

To arrive at the relative value of various foods, it is absolutely necessary to carefully estimate their different nutritive qualities. By this table it will be seen that some expensive foods are really even more costly than they appear at first sight, because of the small proportion of flesh- forming, or nutritive, quality they contain. As an instance of this, one shilling will buy only 7 oz. of salmon, containing 2 per cent, nitrogen, while the same sum will buy 30 oz. of shin of beef, containing 3 per cent, nitrogen, or 24 oz. of cheese, containing 4 per cent. The heat-giving qualities can be estimated by comparing the large percentage of carbon which such foods as oatmeal and potatoes contain with the small amount which is found in various meats. Thus one shilling will buy 136 oz. of hominy, containing 40'28 per cent, of carbon, or 192 oz. of potatoes, containing 81 per cent., whilst it will only buy 13 oz. of steak, which contains 11 per cent, of carbon. “ Once, weekly, remember thy charges to cast, Cnee, monthly, see how thy expenses may last."

Plain; very finely-minced lemon-peel, and when these ingredients are thoroughly mixed, add the eggs, which should be previously well whisked, and the lemon-juice. Beat the mixture well for a minute or two, then drop it from a spoon on to a buttered tin, about 2 inches apart, as the cakes will spread when they get warm ; place the tin in the oven, and bake the cakes of a pale brown from 15 to 20 minutes. Tims.—15 to 20 minutes. Average Cost, is. 6d. Seasonable at any time. 2448.—MACAROONS. (Fr.—Macarons.) Ingredients.—^ lb. of sweet almonds, £ lb. of sifted loaf sugar, the whites of 3 eggs, wafer-paper. Mode.— Blanch, skin, and dry the almonds, and pound them well with a little orange-flower-water or plain water; then add to them the sifted sugar and the whites of the eggs, wh ch should be beaten to a stiff froth, and mix all the ingredients well together. When the paste looks soft, drop it at equal distances from a biscuit-syringe on to sheets of wafer-paper; put a strip of almond on the top of each; strew some sugar over, and bake the macaroons in rather a slow oven, of a light brown colour. When hard and set, they are done, and must not be allowed to get very brown, as that would spoil their appearance. Time.—From 15 to 20 minutes, in a slow oven. Average Cost, is. 3d. per lb. 2449—RATAFIAS. Ingredients.—I lb. of sweet aim Jnds, \ lb. of bitter ones, -J lb. of sifted /oaf sugar, the whites of 4 eggs. Mode.—Blanch, skin and dry the almonds, and pound them in a mortar, with the white of an egg ; stir in the sugar, and gradually add the remaining whites of eggs, taking care that they are very thoroughly whisked. Drop the mixture through a small biscuit-syringe on to cartridge paper, and bake the cakes from 10 to 12 minutes in rather a quicker oven than for macaroons. A very small quantity should be dropped on the paper to form one cake, as, when baked,the ratifias should be about the size of a large button.

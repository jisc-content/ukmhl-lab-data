Like most of the close ranges already in use, it has the boiler on one side and the oven on the other side of a central fire-box, fitted with two — .. doors, each of which may be r “ —— — J opened independently of the other. Below the lower door is a hood with a door in it, the hood preventing the cinders from fall- ing elsewhere than into the ashes- drawer under the fire-box, as they will do in ranges in which there is no contrivance of this kind. Access to the fire-chamber, at the top of the oven, is secured by movable plates, and every facility is afforded for ventilating the oven and regulating the in- tensity of the heat. In front of the oven is a perforated plate, on which anything can be placed or rested when in course of being put into or taken out of the oven. The combustion in this kind of range may be rendered slow or quick as may be desired. It is manufactured in three sizes, the details of which in every respect are given below by the patentees, Messrs. Crabtree Brothers, Old Union Foundry, York Road, Leeds.

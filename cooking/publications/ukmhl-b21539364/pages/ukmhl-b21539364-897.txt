Indian 'Maize., 791 be sufficiently advanced by the beginning of autumn to serve as a vegetable. The outside sheath being taken off and the waving fibres removed, let the ears be placed in boiling water, where they should remain for about twenty-five minutes (a longer time may be necessary for larger ears than ordinary); and, when sufficiently boiled and well drained, they may be sent to table whole, and with a piece of toast underneath them. Melted butter should be served with them. Tinned maize is also sold. Time.—25 to 35 minutes. Average Cost.—Seldom bought. Sufficient.—1 ear for each person. Seasonable in Autumn. Note.—William Cobbett, the English Radical writer and politician, was a great cultivator and admirer of maize, and constantly ate it as a vegetable, bciied. We believe he printed a special recipe for it, but we have been unable to obi..in it. Mr. Buchanan, the late President of the United States, was in the habit, when ambassador here, of receiving a supply of Indian corn from America in hermeti- cally-sealed cases; and the editor of this work remembers, with considerable satisfaction, his introduction to a dish of this vegetable, when in America. He found it to combine the excellence of the young green pea and the finest as- paragus ; but he felt slightly awkward w'hen holding the large ear with one hand, whilst the other had to be employed in cutting off with a knife the delicate green grains. Another vegetable which Americans learnt to appreciate before we dis- covered its value is the tomato. Long before it was, as now, found constantly upon our tables, they consumed it in large quantities, eating it more as a fruit than a vegetable ; but it has of late years risen so highly in our estimation that it may now be considered as popular here as there. The yellow tomato, which is not so well known as the red, is grown chiefly abroad, where it bears aburdance of fruit.

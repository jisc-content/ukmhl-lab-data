590 T russing. 1276—TO SKIN AND TRUSS A HARE. First, cut off the fore legs at the first joint and the belly open length- wise. Secondly, raise the skin of the back and draw it over the hind legs, leaving the tail whole; then draw it* over the back and slip out the fore legs, easing it with a knife, if necessary, over the neck and head, and being very careful not to injure the ears, which are left on. In skinning this is the most deli- cate part, and one that is always found difficult by the amateur, but the appearance of a roast hare is spoilt if the ears are torn or otherwise injured. In our illustration it will be seen that the hare is hanging from a hook, and this will be found a most convenient way of accomplishing the skinning, as both hands are thus free and the skin can be thus far more carefully re- moved and with far greater ease than if the animal be laid upon a board. The same hook that is required for drawing the sinews of a turkey will also serve for the skinning of a hare or rabbit after the legs have been drawn out of the skin. Thirdly, cut open the hare in the manner shown in the following illustration, paunch it, clean the vent, and wash and wipe the inside thoroughly. HARE BEING SKINNED. PAUNCHING OF HARE. After skinning and paunching, if the hare be an old one it is well to wash it in vinegar and water. •1

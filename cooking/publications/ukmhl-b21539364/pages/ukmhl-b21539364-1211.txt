Relative Prices of Flour and Bread. 1089 ment just made as a basis of calculation, we are enabled to give the following table, showing the price of wheat and difference. The prices of wheat and flour are not carried out to pence, and the price of flour that will justify the rise or fall in the price of bread at this rate of farthings is not stated in precise accordance with the price of bread, but they are given, as far as possible, on an equitable principle of adjustment, so as to keep them at even money. Sometimes the buyer has a slight but unappreciable advantage, and sometimes the seller; the rate of progression in all the columns, however, may be looked upon as regulated so as to be perfectly fair to both parties in the main. A very simple way of reckoning what we should pay for bread in comparison with the price of flour is to take the cost per bushel of the latter, and it will be found that a penny in each shilling, or a twelfth part, is the price of a quartern loaf. Thus, for example, when flour is 55. per bushel a loaf should be 5^., or when 45. per bushel, 4d. per loaf. 2404.â€”TABLE OP RELATIVE PRICES OF WHEAT, FLOUR, AND BREAD, At per Quarter, Sack, and Four-Pound Loaf.

Fine pieces of coal placed in a decanter with warm water, and shaken for some time, will also remove stains left by wine, &c. 3332.—WASHING OF KNIVES. The handles of knives should never be immersed in water, as, after a time, if treated in this way the blades will loosen and the handles discolour. The blades should be put in a jug or vessel kept for the purpose, filled with hot soda water. This should be done as soon after they are used as possible, as stain and rust so quickly sink into steel. 3333 -KNIFE CLEANING. Knives are now generally cleaned by means of Kent’s or Master’s machines, which gives very little trouble, and is very effective; before, however, putting the knives into the machine, it is highly necessary that they be first washed in a little warm (not hot) water and then thoroughly wiped ; if put into the machine with any grease on them, it adheres to the brushes, and con- sequently renders them unfit to use for the next knives that may be put in. When this precaution is not taken, the machine must come to pieces, so causing an im- mense amount of trouble, which may all be avoided by having the knives thoroughly free from grease before using the machine. Brushes are also used for cleaning forks, which facilitate the operation. When they are so cleaned, see that they are carefully polished, wiped and with a good edge, the ferules and prongs free from dirt, and place them in the basket with the handles all one way. 3334.—TO KEEP KNIVES NOT IN USE. Without great care, knives not in use will soon spoil. They are best kept in a box in which sifted quicklime has been placed, deep enough to admit of the blades being completely plunged into it. The lime must not touch the handles, which should be occasionally exposed to the air, to keep them from turning yellow.

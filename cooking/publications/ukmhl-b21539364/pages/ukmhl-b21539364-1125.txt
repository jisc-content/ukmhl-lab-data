Preserved Mulberries. 1003 Time.—10 minutes to boil the syrup ; £ hour to simmer the fruit the first day, 10. minutes the second day. Average Cost, from 6d. to 8d. per lb. pot. Sufficient.—Allow about 1 pint of fruit to fill a i-lb. pot. Seasonable.—Make this in August or September. 2169.-ICED CURRANTS. (For Dessert.) Ingredients.— £ pint of water, the whites of 2 eggs, currants, pounded sugar. Mode.—Select very fine bunches of red or white currants, and well beat the whites of the eggs. Mix these with the water; then take the currants, a bunch at a time, and dip them in; let them drain for a minute or two, and roll them in very finely-pounded sugar. Lay them to dry on paper, when the sugar will crystallise round each currant, and have a very pretty effect. All fresh fruit may be prepared in the same manner; and a mixture of various fruits, iced in this manner and arranged on one dish, looks very well for a summer dessert. Time.—£ day to dry the fruit. Average Cost, 8d. for a pint of iced currants. Seasonable in summer. 2170.—PRESERVED MULBERRIES. Ingredients.—To 2 lbs. of fruit and 1 pint of juice allow 2^ lbs. of loaf sugar. Mode.—Put some of the fruit into a pre- serving-pan, and simmer it gently until the juice is well drawn. Strain it through a bag, measure it, and to every pint allow the above proportion of sugar and fruit. Put the sugar into the preserving-pan, moisten it with the juice, boil it up, skim well, and then add the mulberries, which should be ripe, but not soft enough to break to a pulp. Let them stand in the syrup till warm through, then set them on the fire to boil gently; when half done, turn them carefully into an earthen pan, and let them remain till the next day ; then boil them as before, and when the syrup is thick, and becomes firm when cold, put the preserve into pots. In making this, care should be taken not to break the mulberries: this may be avoided by very gentle stirring, and by simmering the fruit very slowly

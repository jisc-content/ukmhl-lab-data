664 General Directions for Carving Poultry. carver manages cleverly, he will be able to cut a very large number of fine slices off the breast, and the more so if he commences close by the wing, and carves upwards towards the ridge of the breast-bone. As many slices as can be taken from the breast being carved, the wings should be cut off; and the same process as described in carving boiled fowl is made use of in this instance, only more dexterity and greater force will most probably be required ; the shape of the leg, when disengaged from the body of the goose, should be like that shown in the accompanying engraving. It will be neces- sary, perhaps, in taking off the leg, to turn the goose on its side, and then, pressing down the small end of the leg, the knife should be passed under it from the top quite down to the joint; the leg being now turned back by the fork, the knife must cut through the joint, loosening the thigh-bone from its socket. The merrythought, which in a goose is not so large as might be ex- pected, is disengaged in the same way as that of a fowlâ€”by passing the knife under it, and pressing it backwards towards the neck. The neck-bones, of which we give a cut, are freed by the same process as are those of a fowl; and the same may be said of all the other parts of this bird. The breast of a goose is the part most esteemed ; all parts, however, are good, and full of juicy flavour. 1374.-PIGEON. A very straightforward plan is adopted in carving a pigeon ; the knife J.s carried sharply in the direc- tion of the line as shown from A to B, entirely through the bird, cutting it into two pre- cisely equal and similar parts. If it is necessary to make three pieces of it, a small wing should be cut off with the leg on either side, thus serving two guests; and, by this means, there will be sufficient meat left on the breast to send to the third guest.

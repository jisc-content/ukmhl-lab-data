702 General Directions for Carving Game. 1440.—HAUNCH OF VENISON. This is a grand dish for a knight of the carving-knife to exercise his skill upon, and, what will be pleasant for many to know, there is but little difficulty in the performance. An incision being made com- pletely down to the bone, haunch of venison. in the direction of the line A to B, the gravy will then be able easily to flow ; when slices, not too thick, should be cut aiong the haunch, as indicated by the line D to C ; that end of the joint marked C having been turned towards the carver, so that he may have a more complete command over the joint. Although some epicures affect to believe that some parts of the haunch are superior to others, yet we doubt if there is any difference between the slices cut above and below the line. It should be borne in mind to serve each guest with a portion of fat; and the most expeditious carver is the best carver, as, like mutton, venison soon begins to chill, when it loses much of its charm. 1441.-WOODCOCK. This bird, like a partridge, may be carved by cutting it exactly into two like portions, or made into three helpings, as described in carving partridge (No. 1437). The back- bone is considered a tit-bit of a woodcock, and by many the thigh is also thought a great delicacy. This bird is served in the manner advised by Brillat Savarin in con- nection with the pheasant, viz., on toast which has received its dripping whilst toasting; and a piece of this toast should invariably accompany each plate. 1442.—LANDRAIL. Landrail, being trussed like Snipe, with the exception of its being drawn, may be carved in the same manner. —(See No. 1439.) Ortolans are usually helped whole, but may be divided for ladies.—(See Snipe.)

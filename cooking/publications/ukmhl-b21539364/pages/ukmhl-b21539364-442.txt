362 Gravies, Forcemeats and Sauces. 807.-CROUTONS AND FRIED BREAD-CRUMBS. Croutons for Soup. Ingredients.—Bread, clarified butter. Mode.— Cut up some bread, minus the crust, into dice-like pieces £ inch square, fry them in clarified butter till they are of a light golden colour; they should be coloured evenly all over. Sippets and Croutons for Entrees. Mode.—Cut bread as before, but in heart-shaped pieces about 2 inches long and half an inch thick ; fry as for croutons for soup. For a border, the sippets look well alternately dark and light, the former made by dipping one side of the sippet into beaten white of egg in which a little flour has been mixed. Croutons for Vegetable Entremets. Mode.— Cut bread as before, but in triangular pieces one and a half inch long. Fried Bread-crumbs. Mode.—For fried bread-crumbs, put some dry crusts or thin slices of bread into a cool oven for a night, and when thoroughly dry and crisp roll them into crumbs. Fry them quickly in lard or butter, lift them out with a slice, and drain them well. They should be perfectly crisp before serving. Liaisons of eggs for thickening sauces (see par. 645) are made by mixing well-beaten yolks of eggs with double the quantity of milk or cream. This thickening must be carefully stirred into the sauce, which must not be allowed to boil or the eggs will curdle. Note.—Bread for croutons should be stale, and for all the preceding recipes should be cut about half an inch thick. For even the simplest hash these croutcns (which can be fried in good dripping for this purpose) are an improve- ment upjn sippets of toasted bread. Bread nicely fried is also preferred by many under poached eggs, instead of buttered toast, and is an excellent accom- paniment to our standard breakfast dish of eggs and bacon.

Administering Medicine. 1561 manner of applying it is shown in illustration No. 5. One or two turns are first taken round the wrist, then the bandage is put down the back of the hand, and with one or two spiral turns to the tip of the finger, from whence it is wound back to the root, and crossing the back is again passed round the wrist and tied. The method of bandaging the wrist is so clearly shown in the accom- panying two illustrations (Nos. 6 and 7) that it does not need explanation. In No. 6 is shown the commencement, with the first turns round the hand; in No. 7 the manner of making reverses in a bandage, which, in this case, is carried some way up the arm. 3516.—TO PUT AN ARM IN A SLING. Our illustration shows the way of putting on a sling which can be made from a large handkerchief, the ends being tied for safety in a reef knot. Care should be taken in arranging a sling that it gives the required support to the arm. 3517-—ADMINISTERING MEDICINE. Although this is given by medical advice, and at the time the doctor orders it as a rule, it sometimes happens that a bottle sent has only the indefinite directions such as “ A dessertspoonful twice daily ” or “ A wine- glassful every 4 hours,” and in the case of an amateur being the nurse it may not be given at the best times. When medicines have to be taken at intervals during the day, it is best to give it first at 10 o’clock in the morning; if only once during the day, then at 9 in the morn- ing or at bedtime ; if twice, at 10 and 4. It is always safest to have a medicine-glass marked with the different measures, for the size of the spoons may considerably vary in different households; and it cannot be too firmly impressed upon the nurse, whether professional or amateur, that regularity and exactitude in the administra- tion of medicine are absolutely essential, the only deviation from the time fixed for it being made when the patient happens to be asleep at the specified hour.

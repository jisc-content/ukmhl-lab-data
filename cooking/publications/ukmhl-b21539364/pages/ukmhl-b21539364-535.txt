Roast Loin of Veal. Seasonable from March to October. 997—ROAST LOIN OF VEAL. (Fr.—Longe de Veau Rotie.) Ingredients.—Veal; melted butter. Mode.—Paper the kidney fat; roll in and skewer the flap, which makes the joint a good shape ; dredge it well with flour, and put it down to a bright fire. Should the loin be very large, skewer the kidney back for a time to roast thoroughly. Keep it well basted, and, a short time before serving, remove the paper from the kidney, and allow it to acquire a nice brown colour, but it should not be burnt. Have ready some melted butter, No. 676, put it into the dripping-pan after it is emptied of its contents, pour it over the veal, and serve. Garnish the dish with slices of lemon and forcemeat balls, and send to table with it boiled bacon, ham, pickled pork, or pig’s cheek. Time.—A large loin, 3 hours. Average Cost, lod. per lb. Sufficient for 7 or 8 persons. Seasonable from March to October. Note.—A piece of toast should be placed under the kidney when the veal is dished. 998—LOIN OF VEAL WITH BECHAMEL SAUCE.

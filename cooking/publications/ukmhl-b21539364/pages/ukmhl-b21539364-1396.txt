The introduction of French cookery into England in years comparatively recent has been so general, that its adoption by many of us ought to have become frequent, ana it would argue ignorance, indeed, to be entirely unac- quainted with the various a las so often presented to us in the present day at dinners in good private houses, hotels and restaurants. Nor are we now averse to the many delicacies greeted in former years with the non-euphonious term of “French messes.” French cookery ranks deservedly high, perhaps higher than any other, and the land that gave birth to a Sava'rin, a Soyer and others, is justly proud of having raised the culinary art to the highest standard of perfection. Unfortunately cooking is an art which few of us practise, and in which still fewer of us ever excel. This latter fact is due almost entirely to the want of early cultivation.

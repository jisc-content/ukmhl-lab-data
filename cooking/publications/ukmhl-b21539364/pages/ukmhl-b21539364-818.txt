It must be used quickly, or kept in a covered tin, as it very soon absorbs moisture from the air, and turns bitter. Maize meal is also sold in packets, steam-dried and partially cooked. 1493.—HOMINY PORRIDGE. Ingredients.—Hominy, water, a piece of butter. Mode.—Pour boiling water on the hominy over night, and let it stand till morning. Then add more water if necessary, and boil it for at least half an hour. Stir in the butter just before serving. Note.—Hominy is the inner part of the maize, and bears about the same relation to maiz^-meal that coarsely-ground flour does to whole wheat meal. It is not so nourishing, but being less oily it keeps well, and has not the charac- teristic flavour of maize-meal, which is unpleasant to some persons. 1494.—WHEAT-MEAL PORRIDGE. Ingredients.—Wheat meal, coarsely ground; water. Mode.—Make as directed for oatmeal. 1495— LENTIL PORRIDGE. Ingredients.—3 oz. of lentil flour, I pint of water, salt, butter. Mode.—Put the flour and salt in a basin with a little cold water, add the rest of the water boiling, put it on the fire and boil it for 10 minutes. Stir in the butter just before serving. Half lentil and half barley or wheat flour is preferred by some people, and makes a close imitation of the Revalenta Arabica, so much advertised for invalids. 1496.-PEASE BROSE. Prepare and cook as above, using about 2 tablespoonfuls of pease meal, rather less than half a pint of water, 1 oz. of butter, and salt. 1497.-OATMEAL SCONES.

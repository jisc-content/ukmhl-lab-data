General Directions for Carving Poultry 66o GENERAL DIRECTIONS FOR CARVING POULTRY. ROAST DUCK. 1370.—ROAST DUCK. No dishes require so much knowledge and skill in their carving as do game and poultry, for it is necessary to be well ac- quainted with the anatomy of the bird and animal in order to place the knife at exactly the proper point. A tough fowl and an old goose are sad triers of a carver’s powers and temper, and, indeed, sometimes of the good-humour of those in the neighbourhood of the carver; for a sudden tilt of the dish may eventuate in the placing a quantity of the gravy in the lap of the right or left-hand supporter of the host. We will endeavour to assist those who are unac quainted with the “ gentle art of carving,” and also those who are but slightly acquainted with it, by simply describing the rules to follow, and referring to the distinctly-marked illus- trations or each dish, which will further help to bring light to the minds of the uninitiated. If the bird be a young duckling, it may be carved like a fowl, viz., by first taking off the leg and the wing on either side, as described at No. 1372 ; but in cases where the duckling is very small, it will be as well not to separate the leg from the wing, as they will not then form too large a portion for a single serving. After the legs and wings are disposed of, the remainder of the duck will be also carved in the same manner as a fowl; and not much difficulty will be experienced, as ducklings are tender, and the joints are easily broken by a little forcing, or penetrating by the knife. In cases where the duck is a large bird, the better plan to pursue is then to carve it like a goose, that is LEG, WING AND NECK-BONE OF DUCK.

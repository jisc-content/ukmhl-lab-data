An agreement upon any subject not creating a tenancy must have a sixpenny stamp. If an adhesive stamp be used, it must be put on and cancelled at the time of executing the instrument. Postage stamps are available up to 2s. 6d. Every solicitor is responsible for the proper stamping of the documents he is engaged upon. It is not essential that any of the documents before referred to should be stamped at the time of execution, but if not, and they are not subsequently stamped, they cannot be produced as evidence in any proceedings relating to them. The time allowed for subsequent stamping of an agreement under hand only is fourteen days; of a deed, two months. The stamping can be effected on application at Somerset House, or, in the provinces, to a local stamp office. The Commissioners of Stamps are authorised to allow stamping after the stipulated time in some cases, but such indulgence is very rare, and must be justified by extremely exceptional circumstances. If stamping be neglected within the stipulated time, it cannot afterwards be effected without payment of a penalty of £io, or, if in court, £11, in addition to the stamp originally required. I 3699.

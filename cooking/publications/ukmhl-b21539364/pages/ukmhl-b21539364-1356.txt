I230 General Observations on Invalid CooheVy. fluid form, fit to be taken at once into the body without any work for the feeble digestion of the invalid. 2769. Eggs should be given raw, or cooked as lightly as possible, and if beaten to a froth they are more digestible. The white is nourishing as well as the yolk, and is less likely to disagree with a bilious patient. 2770. As the patient convalesces the list of foods may be gradually added to—“ In febrile, acute inflammatory, and other conditions where an absence of digestive power prevails .... the food should be confined to such articles as beef-tea, mutton, veal, or chicken-broth, whey, calf's foot and other kinds of jelly, arrowroot, and such-like farinaceous articles, barley-water, rice, mucilage, gum-water, fruit-jelly, and the juice of fruits, as lemons, oranges, &c., made into drinks .... Where a little latitude is allowable, the employment of milk and eggs in a fluid form may be sanctioned. Bread jelly, which is made by steeping bread in boiling water and passing through a sieve while still hot, is also an article that may be used either alone, or boiled with milk. From this, as circumstances permit, an advance may be made to solid substances which do not throw much work on the stomach, such as rice, sago, tapioca, bread and custard puddings, and stale bread and toast sopped. Next may be allowed fish ; and the varieties to select are whiting, sole, flounder, or plaice, which should be boiled or broiled, and not fried. Whiting, of all fish, is that which proves lightest to the stomach. As power becomes restored, calves’ feet, chicken, game, and butcher’s meat—mutton to begin with—may be permitted to follow.” * And so on till ordinary diet is reached. * “ Treatise on Food and Dietetics."—Pavy, Published by Churchill, London.

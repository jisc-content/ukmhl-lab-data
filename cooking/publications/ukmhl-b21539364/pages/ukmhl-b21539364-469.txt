Beef d la Mode. 387 set it by the side of the fire to stew very gently, till the meat becomes quite tender, which will be in about 3 hours, when it will be ready to serve. Remove the bay-leaves before it is sent to table. Time.—3 hours. Average Cost, is. 8d. Sufficient for 6 persons. Seasonable at any time. 867.—BEEF A LA MODE. (Fr.—Bceuf a la Mode.) (Another Mode.) Ingredients.—6 lbs. of the thick flank of beef, a few slices of fat bacon, 1 teacupful of vinegar; black pepper, allspice, 2 cloves, well mixed and finely pounded, making altogether 1 heaped teaspoonful; salt to taste, 1 bunch of savoury herbs, including parsley, all finely minced and well mixed ; 2 onions, 2 large carrots, 1 turnip, 1 head of celery, pint of water, 1 glass of port wine. Mode.—Slice and fry the onions of a pale brown, and cut up the other vegetables in small pieces, and prepare the beef for stewing in the follow- ing manner:—Choose a fine piece of beef, cut the bacon into long slices, about an inch in thickness, dip them into vinegar, and then into a little of the above seasoning of spices, &c., mixed with the same quantity of minced herbs. With a sharp knife make holes deep enough to let in the bacon ; then rub the beef over with the remainder of the seasoning and herbs, and bind it up in a nice shape with tape. Have ready a well-tinned stew-pan (it should not be much larger than the piece of meat you are cooking), into which put the beef, with the vegetables, vinegar and water. Let it simmer very gently for 5 hours, or rather longer should the meat not be extremely tender, and turn it once or twice. When ready to serve, take out the beef, remove the tape, and put it on a hot dish. Skim off every particle of fat from the gravy, add the port wine, just let it boil, pour it over the beef, and it is ready to serve. Great care must be taken that this does not boil fast, or the meat will be tough and tasteless ; it should only just bubble. When convenient, all kinds of stews, &c., should be cooked on a hot-plate, as the process is so much more gradual than on an open fire. Time.—5 hours, or rather more. Average Cost, 5s. Sufficient for 12 persons. Seasonable all the year, but more suitable for a winter dish. Good Meat.—The Iyer of meat when freshly killed (and the animal, when slaughtered, being in a state of perfect health) adheres firmly to the bones. Beef of the best quality is of a deep-red colour, and when the animal has approached maturity, and been well-fed, "the lean is intermixed with fat, giving it the mottled appearance which is so much esteemed. Ii is also full of juice, which resembles in colour claret wine. The fat of the best beef is of a firm and waxy consistency, of a colour resembling that of the finest grass butter ; bright in appearance, neither greasy nor friable to the touch, but moderately unctuous, in a medium degree between the last-mentioned properties.

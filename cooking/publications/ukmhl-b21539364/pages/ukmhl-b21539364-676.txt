582 TRUSSING. CHAPTER XXIII. 1268. Trussing may be said to be one of the most important arts in con- nection with cookery. In London and other large towns where so much, if not all, the poultry and game is sent out ready prepared for cooking, many cooks do not make it a study ; but it ought, nevertheless, to be a part of the education of each one. Realising the importance of this branch of the cook’s art, and know- ing how difficult it is to learn from written instructions, we have prepared a series of illustrations to practically show the various stages in the preparation ol game and poultry for different modes of cooking. To obtain these and to ensure their being reliable guides for the uninitiated we secured the services of a special artist and those of a very experienced trusser. The latter taking each bird or animal in turn demonstrated t-he manner of plucking, singeing, drawing, trus- sing, &c., at each stage of which a sketch was made, so that we trust that by studying these drawings the amateur will be helped to acquire the proper method. 1269.—TO PLUCK A BIRD. Hold the bird in the left hand,as shown in the illustration,and commence to pull off the feathers from under the wing. Having plucked one side, FOWL BEING PLUCKED. take the other wing and proceed in the same manner till you have removed all feathers except the down.

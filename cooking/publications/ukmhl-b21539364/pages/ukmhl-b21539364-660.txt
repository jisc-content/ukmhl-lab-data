RECIPES FOR TINNED MEAT. CHAPTER XXI. 1238.—COLD MEAT. Ingredients.—1 tin of meat, parsley. Mode.—This is an excellent breakfast, supper or luncheon dish. It requires a skilful person to open the tin, or the dish will be spoiled as far as appearance goes. The meat should be turned out as firm and whole as it is possible to turn it out. With a flat instrument—a wooden paper-knife answers the purpose excellently—clear away every vestige of fat, jelly, dripping, &c., that may adhere to the meat; garnish with sprigs of parsley, and serve with mashed potatoes, pickles and salad. Another and a very good way is to remove all the best shaped and unbroken pieces and to arrange them in a circle on a dish. Fill up the centre with salad, and pour a thick mayonnaise sauce over. Garnish with hard-boiled eggs, beetroot, small lettuces, or meat jelly. Average Cost, is. per 2-lb. tin. Seasonable at any time. 1239.-BEEF COLLOPS.

1028 Recipes for Preserves, Pickles and Store Sauces. the mixed vegetables into smaller jars, without any of the vinegar; then boil the vinegar again, adding as much more as will be required to fill the different jars, and also cayenne, mustard-seed, turmeric and mustard, which must be well mixed with a little cold vinegar, allowing the quantities 1 named above to each gallon of vinegar. Pour the vinegar, boiling hot, over the pickle, and, when cold, tie down with a bladder. If the pickle is Wa ited for immediate use, the vinegar should be boiled twice more, but the better way is to make it during one season for use during the next. It ' will keep for years, if care is taken that the vegetables are quite covered by the vinegar. i This recipe was taken from the directions of a lady whose pickle was ' always pronounced excellent by all who tasted it, and who has, for many years, exactly followed the recipe given above. Note.—For small families, perhaps the above quantity of pickle will be con- j sidered too large ; but this may be decreased at pleasure, taking care to properly proportion the various ingredients. Keeping Pickles.—Nothing shows more, perhaps, the difference between a tidy, thrifty house- wife and a lady to whom these desirable epithets may not honestly be applied, than the appearance of their respective storeclosets. The former is able, the moment anything is wanted, to put her hand on it at once; no time is lost, no vexation in- curred, no dish spoilt for the want of “just a little something ; ” the latter, on the contrary, hunts all over her cupboard for the ketchup the cook requires, or the pickle the husband thinks he should like a little of with his cold roast beef or mutton-chop, and vainly seeks for the Embden groats, or arrowroot, to make one of her little boys some gruel. One plan, then, we strenuously advise all who do not follow to begin at once, and that is, to label all their various pickles and store sauces, in the same way •■as the cut here shows. It will occupy a little time at first, but there will be economy of it in the long run. pickle jar. Vinegar.—The term is derived from two French words, vin aigre, “sour wine" and should, therefore, be strictly applied to that which is made only from wine. As the acid is the same, however it is procured, that made from ale also takes the same name. Nearly all ancient nations were acquainted with the use of vinegar. We learn in Ruth, that the reapers in the East, soaked their bread in it to freshen it. The Romans kept large quantities of it in their cellars, using it, to a great extent, in their seasonings and sauces. This people attributed very beneficial qualities to it, as it was supposed to be digestive, antibilious, and antiscorbutic, as well as refreshing. Spartianus, a Latin historian, tells us that, mixed with water, it was the drink of the soldiers, and that, thanks to this beverage, the veterans of the Roman army braved, by its use, the inclemency and variety of all the different seasons and climates of Europe, Asia, and Africa. It is said, the Spanish peasantry, and other inhabitants of the Southern parts of Europe, still follow this practice, and add to a gallon of water about a gill of wine vinegar, with a little salt ; and that this drink, with a little bread, enables them, under the heat of their burning sun, to sustain the labours of the field. 2228.—PICKLED INDIAN MAIZE.

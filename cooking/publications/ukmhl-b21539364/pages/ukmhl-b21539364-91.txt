56.—POULTRY AND GAME. The cost of Poultry varies with the season, but comparing one year with another there will be found no great difference in price. Such, however, is not the ease with Game, for whilst in a plentiful year it is often very cheap, in a scarce one it is proportionately dear. POULTRY. Poultry. In Season. Best & Cheapest.

GAM E. In this variable climate no hard and fast rule can be laid down for the keeping of Game before it is cooked. In all cases it requires hanging; but while in winter it is safe to buy birds that have been shot some time, in damp or warm weather no such risk should be run. Game. In Season. Best & Cheapest.

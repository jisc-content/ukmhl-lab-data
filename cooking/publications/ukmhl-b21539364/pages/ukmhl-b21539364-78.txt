CHAPTER II. THE HOUSEKEEPER. 46. As Second in Command in the House, except in large establish- ments, where there is a house-steward, the housekeeper must consider herself as the immediate representative of her mistress, and bring to the management of the household all those qualities of honesty, industry, and vigilance in the same degree as if she were at the head of her own family. Constantly on the watch to detect any wrongdoing on the part of any of the domestics, she will overlook all that goes on in the house, and will see that every department is thoroughly attended to, and that the servants are comfortable, at the same time that their various duties are properly performed. Cleanliness, punctuality, order anf method are essentials in the character of a good house- keeper. Without the first, no household can be said to be well-managed. The second is equally all-important; for those who are under the housekeeper will take their “ cue" from her; an I in the same proportion as punctuality governs her movements, so will it theirs. Order, again, is indispens ible; for by it we wish to be understood that “there should be a place for everything, and everything in its place.” 47. Accounts.—A necessary qualification for a housekeeper is tha-t she should thoroughly understand accounts. She will have to write in her books an accurate registry of all sums paid for any and every purpose, all the current expenses of the house, tradesmen’s bills, wages, and other extraneous matter. As we have mentioned under the head of The Mistress (see 13), a housekeeper's accounts should be periodically balanced and examined by the head of the house. Nothing tends more to the satisfaction of both employer and employed than this arrangement. “ Short reckonings make long friends,” stands good in this case, as in others. The following table of expenses, income, or wages shows what any sum, from £1 to £100 per annum, is per quarter, calendar month, week, or day :— Per Year. Per Quarter. Per Month Per Week. Per Day.

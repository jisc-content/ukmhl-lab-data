If her husband is a hard-working professional or business man, or otherwise engaged earning the income that supports the house, it is simply her duty (and it is morally criminal to evade it) to spend the money he earns to the best, and not to the worst, advantage, for his health, comfort, and happiness; and as she participates in the advantage too, this is no great hardship.

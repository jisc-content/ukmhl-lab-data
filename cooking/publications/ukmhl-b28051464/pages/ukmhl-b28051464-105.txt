IOI CHAPTER IX. VEGETABLES.'* CUCUMBERS FRIED IN BATTER. Make a batter either of flour and water or of milk, egg and flour, pare a fresh cucumber, slice about half an inch thick, sprinkle it with salt and let it drain for a few minutes; dust with pepper, dip in the batter, and fry in hot fat till brown and crisp; drain, and serve hot. CARROTS, PICKLED. (This is a good way for utilising cold carrots.) Boil half a pint of vinegar for ten or twelve minutes with a teaspoonful of peppercorns, six whole allspice, a tiny blade of mace, half a teaspoonful of salt, and three lumps of sugar. Strain, and when cold pour it over the cold boiled carrots, which have been cut in rather thick slices and placed in a glass dish. * Vegetables are chiefly valuable on account of the potash and other salts which they contain.

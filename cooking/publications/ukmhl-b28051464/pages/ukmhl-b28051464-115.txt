111 Mustard Sauce. MINT SAUCE. (To serve with Eoast Lamb.) Requisites.—Two tablespoonfuls of finely chopped mint, half a breakfast-cupful of vinegar, a dessert-spoonful of sugar, one teaspoonful of salt, half a teaspoonful of black or white pepper. Method of Making.—Pick off the tenderest leaves of the mint, and do not use the large hard outside ones (these need not be wasted by people who have to buy mint, they can be dried and kept in a well-corked bottle, or can, with the stalks, be used for boiling with new potatoes or peas, both of which are greatly improved by being cooked with this addition), wash them well in two waters, dry between two folds of a clean cloth, chop fine, and put into a sauce tureen with the other ingredients. Mix well until the sugar is melted. This is best made a few hours before it is required, so that the flavour of the mint may thoroughly permeate the vinegar. Mote.—Mint sauce is always served cold. MUSTARD SAUCE. Fry one ounce of butter and the same of flour till browned well, add a breakfast-cupful of any kind of stock, a teaspoonful of tarragon vinegar, and either a dessertspoonful of English mustard, or better still, English and French mustard mixed; stir well, simmer for a minute or two, and serve.

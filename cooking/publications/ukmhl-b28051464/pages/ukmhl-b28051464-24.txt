Kitchen Economy. 20 then suddenly announce that “the coal is out,” when perhaps it is impossible to get more delivered im- mediately. Now if the simple plan was adopted of burning up the dust with the lumps it would never accumulate. Of course a fire cannot be lighted with dust or very small coal, but once it is red and bright, a little dust coal added from time to time keeps it going and saves the lumps; and if the fire in any room which is going to be unoccupied for some hours, as the dining- room from breakfast to luncheon, is banked up with dust coal that has been damped, it will “ keep in ” for two or three hours, and then with lumps and poking will make a good fire. In nurseries or bedrooms, when the fire needs to be kept in all night, damped dust may be usefully used up. Fire-bricks should be put into all wide, deep grates; they greatly save the consumption of coal. A fire-brick laid on the top of a fire saves coal, as it causes the fire to burn slowly, it gets nearly red hot, and then gives out heat. Fire-bricks can be bought for one penny each at most oil shops.

Roasting at an open fire, for instance, is the most extravagant of all methods of cooking, though un- doubtedly it produces excellent results as far as the palatability of the article cooked is concerned; but it is

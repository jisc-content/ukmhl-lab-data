These remarks apply also to broiling,, frying, and baking, and more especially to the latter, for the operation being carried on in a confined space, the volatile fatty acids generated are prevented from escaping, and thus permeate the cooked articles.” New Zealand or any mutton that has been long killed is not so suitable for boiling as that which is fresh, because it turns a dark colour; and New Zealand mutton, having but little fat, is not so good for boiling as freshly killed English meat.

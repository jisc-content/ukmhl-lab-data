Stock-Making. 25 in them. If but few joints are used in the house it is good economy to purchase a few pennyworth of bones from the butcher every week from which to make stock. This is no extravagance, for all the odds and ends of food with these bones, say 4d. or 6d. worth, will provide soup for the week. Every butcher will sell fresh bones and will crack them if he be asked to do so, or they may be smashed with a heavy hammer. A quart of water to two pounds of fresh bones is about the proper allowance. It is always important to carefully inspect all bones and remnants before putting them into the stock-pot, as if one should be musty or tainted it would cause all the stock to be wasted. Uncooked bacon rind should be scraped well for fear of its being rusty. The water in which meat, fowl, rabbits, calfâ€™s head, and white fish have been boiled should always be carefully saved, as this water makes excellent soup, or may be added to the stock-pot; but of course common sense points out that the water in which fish was boiled should be kept for fish soup, and not put into the ordinary stock-pot. The water in which fowl or veal have been boiled may be kept by itself for white stock, and from it many kinds of in- expensive ivliite soups may be made. The water in which haricot or kidney beans, celery, artichokes, etc., have been boiled makes good vegetable soup.

Brain Fritters. 89 To cook ihe Head. Tell the butcher to send it ready prepared for cooking. Wash it well and put it in a boiling pot with hot water to cover it completely, a tablespoonful of peppercorns, and a few cloves; boil gently till the bones can be drawn out (about three hours, or more if the head is very large). Lift the head on to a dish, pull out the bones and put them back in the liquor, and simmer this for half-an- hour more. Then strain and keep for stock. Cut the meat into neat pieces, removing the white, tough skin from the palate, make a thick gravy with some of the liquor, browning and thickening it, as at p. 32; add to it two tablespoonfuls of ketchup and one of vinegar; put in the meat, and serve very hot. Note.—This can be re-heated as required. BRAIN FRITTERS. (VERY DIGESTIBLE.) Any kind of brain—ox, calf’s, or sheep’s—can be used for this dish. Steep the brain in lukewarm salt and water for two hours, changing the water if necessary; tie it in a piece of muslin, put it in hot water and simmer for twelve or fifteen minutes (or twenty minutes to half-an- hour if a large ox brain is used). Take up and leave to grow nearly cold, then slice (if the brain is large) in thick pieces, sprinkle with a little pepper and salt, dip in flour and water batter, fry in nearly boiling fat, in a frying basket, till of a golden brown; drain, serve on a hot napkin with cut lemon and garnish of parsley.

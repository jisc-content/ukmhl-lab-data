Oatmeal Porridge. i53 much richer if there are crusts in it. Break the crumb and crust rather small, do not cut them up, pour cold milk over just to cover them, add a few lumps of sugar, and boil all together for ten minutes after it begins to simmer; the more crusts there are the more boiling it needs. This is most nutritious, and is an admirable way of using up broken bread if made a breakfast-dish for the children once or twice a week. On the other days may be given a dish than which there is nothing more nourishing or more economical—viz., OATMEAL PORRIDGE. Requisites.—Oatmeal, coarse or fine according to taste, water or milk, salt. Method.—Make one pint and a half of water or milk, or milk and water, come to boiling point, then directly pour in a breakfast-cupful of oatmeal with the left hand, stirring zm'ih the right hand ail the time till the meal and water are well ?nixed, then let it boil for ten minutes, add salt to taste (if this is put in at the beginning it prevents the meal from swelling properly), and con- tinue the boiling for another ten, or still better, twenty minutes, stirring occasionally to keep from burning. If made with milk it will burn more easily than with water. Should be made in an iron saucepan. If made as directed, it will be smooth and free from lumps. Under- done porridge is indigestible.

Ginger Pudding. 129 small teaspoonful of baking-powder, pinch of salt, milk, jam. Method.—Mix the baking-powder and salt with the flour, add the bread crumbs and mix thoroughly, moisten with enough milk to make a firm paste, roll out to half an inch thickness, spread with jam (apricot or rasp- berry if possible), roll up neatly. Dip a stout pudding- cloth in boiling water, strew thickly with flour, put the pudding in this and roll the cloth round it; tie ends firmly, but leave a little room for pudding to swell; plunge into fast boiling water and boil for three-quarters of an hour, or may be steamed the same time. This will be a small pudding, increase quantities to make a larger one, and boil it for a longer time. Note.—Any kind of suet-pudding may be made with bread crumbs and flour, if the crumbs be rubbed fine, and it will be found much more digestible than if made of suet and flour only. Many people who cannot eat suet-puddings made in the ordinary way can digest them quite well when made with the addition of bread crumbs. GINGER PUDDING.

Economical Entrees. 88 If preferred, some jelly can be made from the packet gelatine procurable at any grocers, making it according to directions on packet but flavouring as above, and clearing as directed for clear soup, p. 48. BEEF HEART (STUFFED AND BAKED). Tell the butcher to send the heart cleaned, ready for cooking; soak it in warm water for a couple of hours, put it into boiling water, and then simmer gently for two hours; place it on a dish, and when cool wipe it inside and out; stuff, either with a stuffing made according to that given at page 63 for baked haddock, or with “goose stuffing”—i.e., boiled potatoes mashed with plenty of chopped-up onions and pepper, or with “ duck stuffing ” —i.e., sage, pepper, and onions finely chopped together. Sew up with needle and coarse thread, cover with clarified dripping, and bake in quick oven for two hours; baste frequently with the melted dripping. Serve, with brown gravy, very hot. BEEF HEAD (i.e., OX HEAD OR OX CHEEK). This is a most economical dish for a large family. An ox’s head can be bought from two shillings upwards, according to season, etc. The meat from it can also be bought by the pound, but it is more economical to buy it whole, as excellent stock for soup can be made from the bones, and fritters from the brains.

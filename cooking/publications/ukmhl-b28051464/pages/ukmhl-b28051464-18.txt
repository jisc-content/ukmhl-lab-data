14 Introductory Note. matter is found in a vast number of food articles besides in the flesh of animals. Milk, eggs, cheese, oatmeal, semolina, macaroni, bread, etc., etc., are ex- tremely rich in it. Speaking of macaroni, Sir H. Thompson says: “ Maca- roni is, in fact, an aliment of very high nutritious power— being formed chiefly of the gluten, the most valuable part of the wheat from which the starch has been removed. Weight for weight, it may be regarded as not less valuable for flesh-making purposes in the animal economy than beef or mutton.” Lentils and semolina are also very rich in this substance. Lentils rank ex- tremely high as a nutritious food, so does semolina, which, like macaroni, is formed of the gluten of wheat. Sir William Roberts, F.R.S., writes: “The proteid of wheat is not quite identical with that of oats or barley. . . . Taking the lentil as the type of the leguminous group, it is to be observed that lentil flour contains twice as much proteid matter as wheat or oat flour, and almost twice as much lime.” Hence the value of lentil soups, stews, etc. With regard to the subject under our special con- sideration—economy—the authority just quoted says : “Lean beef contains, roughly speaking, twice as much proteid matter as wheat flour, but beef is about four times as dear as flour, so that you may estimate that proteids of animal source are about twice as costly as proteids of vegetable source.” It is to be feared that sometimes the continual use

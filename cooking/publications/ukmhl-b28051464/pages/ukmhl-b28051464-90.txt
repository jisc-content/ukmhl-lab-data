Using Up Cold Meat. 86 those who are partial to onions some fried or boiled and chopped onions may be mixed with the meat. TOAD-IN-THE-HOLE. The remains of beef or mutton too under-done to be agreeable eating as a cold dish can be converted into an excellent “Toad.” Rub a rather deep pie dish lightly with a cut clove of garlic; cut the meat into neat pieces. If a sheep’s kidney or half a pound of beef kidney can be had, free this from fat, cut it up, and add to the other meat. Put all into the pie dish, season with black pepper and salt, and pour over all sufficient batter (made by allowing one egg to half a pint of milk, a tablespoon- ful of flour and a pinch of salt, all blended smoothly together) to cover entirely. Bake in a brisk oven from half to three-quarters of an hour, according to size.

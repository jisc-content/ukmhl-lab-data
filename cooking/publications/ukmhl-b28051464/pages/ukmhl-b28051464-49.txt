45 CHAPTER IV. RECIPES FOR SOUPS (ECONOMICAL). CABBAGE SOUP. Requisites.—One quart of stock or water in which meat, etc., has been boiled, one head of cabbage, two ounces of clarified dripping, one tablespoonful of flour or corn flour (the latter is best), pepper and salt. Method of making.—Soak the cabbage in salt and water, so that it may be quite free from insects; boil until tender, put it into a colander and chop fine, care- fully pressing all the water out; put it then into a sauce- pan with the stock, dripping, salt and pepper, and put it on to boil. Put the flour into a basin, add a spoonful of stock or water, and blend till perfectly smooth; pour it into the soup when at boiling point, and boil for five minutes, stirring well. If the soup is preferred thicker- more flour may be used. If the tureen be rubbed with a bit of cut garlic the soup will be improved to the taste of those who like its savoury flavour.

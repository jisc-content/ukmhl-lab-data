30 Kitchen Economy. as perquisites must be unknown, especially as far as fat and bones are concerned. They are important items in kitchen economy, and must be turned to account just as much as the other food stuffs. SAVING OF WASTE IN BROKEN BREAD. Some notable housewives make the ignominious con- fession that in the matter of using up their broken bread they are, in schoolboy slang, fairly “stumped”; howto get rid of it they do not know. Of course, thrifty people say, “Don’t have any waste or broken bread; insist on every piece being eaten before a fresh loaf is cut.” This advice, excellent in theory, is, like much of the same kind, often unworkable in practice. Husbands and sons will rebel at the sight of hard heels of loaves, if you try to enforce the principle of eating remnants to the last mouthful; you cannot furnish the breakfast-table with nothing but the scraps left from the dinner bread; and in many cases if the rule was insisted on that the in- habitants of the kitchen should use up the broken bread from the parlour, rebellion would ensue, and that so frequently that more money would be spent on registry office fees than would pay the baker’s bill for a twelve- month. No; the broken bread cannot always be used up by eating it pur et simple; but nevertheless she must be a very unimaginative woman who cannot find means for disposing of even the very last crumb without necessitating a grumble from any one.

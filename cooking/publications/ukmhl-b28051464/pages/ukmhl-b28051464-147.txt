This pickle may be made with glace cherries, in which case omit the sugar. INEXPENSIVE LEMON MARMALADE (VERY GOOD). Requisites.—Lemons, water, sugar. Method.—Divide the lemons into quarters, remove the pips, and lay each quarter on a board and slice as thin as possible, peel and pulp together. To each pound of sliced fruit add three pints of cold water (if the lemons have very thin rinds and are very juicy, two pints or two pints and a half may be sufficient), then let it stand for twenty-four hours in an earthenware pan, after which boil all together until the strips of peel are perfectly tender. This will generally take about three- quarters of an hour, but if the skins are thick and rough more time may be needed; then pour through a colander, and weigh the pulp that remains when the liquor has flowed through, and to every pound of pulp add one pound and a quarter of sugar and one pint of the liquor that has flowed through the colander (the surplus liquor may be bottled for use as lemon squash); boil for three- quarters of an hour, removing carefully all scum. Try a little on a plate; if it jellies when cooled it is done, if not, continue boiling till it does. Note.—Sometimes lemons are very plentiful and cheap. Advantage should be taken of such a time to make this

75 The Epicure’s Steak. think the meat will stick to the pan, or the pan will crack, or something else untoward will happen, but once they take courage and try the plan they are delighted with the result. It is from the universal praise bestowed on this recipe whenever I have recommended it, and it has been tried, that I have devoted a whole chapter to expatiate on the value of the almost red-hot iron pan as a utensil for cooking chops and steaks. The science of the matter is that the albumen in the meat is coagulated on the outside, in the same way as in broiling or roasting, therefore the juice is kept in and not drawn out by being dissolved in warm fat. Fat also soddens the meat that is slowly cooked in it. Salt and pepper should never be sprinkled on meat while broiling, they also help to extract its juice. . THE EPICURE’S STEAK. Take an evenly cut fillet steak about an inch and a half thick, cook it as just directed. Place it on an extremely hot dish, put a piece of butter on it, sprinkle a spoonful of finely chopped parsley over it, and a squeeze of lemon juice. Serve very hot. Gravy is not needed for chops and steaks cooked in this way, because gravy will flow from the meat when it is cut.

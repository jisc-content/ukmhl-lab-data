Economical Dishes. 148 half-a-dozen mushrooms, and a truffle, white pepper and salt, and one egg. Pound all in a mortar* till thoroughly mixed and stuff the fowl with it, and bake for three- quarters of an hour, or one hour if the fowl is large. Glaze over with some brown stock in which gelatine has been dissolved, or with aspic jelly while liquid; or cover with thick white sauce in which a little gelatine has been dissolved. Garnish with cut up truffles, olives, and slices of beet-root cut into fancy shapes. This may not sound a very economical dish, but for a supper party it is really inexpensive, as it can be prepared at home, and a little of it goes a long way, as it is all solid cutting. BRAWN.

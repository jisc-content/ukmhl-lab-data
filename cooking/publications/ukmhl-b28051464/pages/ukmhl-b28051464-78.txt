74 How to Broil a Chop or Steak. for I have never yet found a cookery book which told its readers how to perform the simple feat of cooking chops and steaks on a pan so that they will taste as well as if done on a gridiron, and it is what every one who studies economy should know how to do, because broiling on a gridiron causes a good deal of waste of meat, and also needs time and trouble in the prepara- tion of the fire, for without a good clear fire such broiling cannot be done properly. On the pan, how- ever, you can broil on almost any kind of fire, in the following way:— Take a stout iron frying-pan (an enamelled pan or a thin tin one won’t do), see that it is quite clean and perfectly dry, put it on the fire and let it get nearly red hot, then take the chop or steak up with the sugar-tongs,* put it on the pan and turn it every fifteen seconds. Do not go away and leave it, but turn it regularly every fifteen seconds until it is done, which, according to the thickness of the meat, will be in from seven to ten minutes; so it is no great hardship to have to watch it for that short time. Then take up the meat and put it on a hot dish, and serve merely with a piece of butter placed upon it. Any one who eats a chop or steak cooked in this way will never patronise the greasy pan method again. People are sometimes quite afraid to try this recipe, they * Beef-steak tongs are sold for this purpose (in order to prevent prongs being stuck into the meat, which extracts the juice), but the sugar-tongs will do if the others are not procurable.

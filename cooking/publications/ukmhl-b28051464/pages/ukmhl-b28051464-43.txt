39 Frying. “ boiling in oil,” and the reason oil is used for the purpose instead of water is that it can be made hotter than water. Try with ever so great a fire, water can never be made as hot as oil. Water boils at 212° F., and whether it is boiling wildly or gently it is no hotter than this. Oil must be heated to 500° F. or thereabouts before it boils, but it is not necessary to get fat or oil up to this pitch of heat before cooking with it. In fact, if things were put into oil that was actually boiling they would be quickly burnt to a cinder. It is only necessary to raise the temperature considerably over that of boiling water in order to fry properly. Testing the oil with a thermometer is an expensive operation for most amateur cooks as they generally smash the thermometer, and a simpler and equally efficacious test can be made by throwing a bit of bread crumb into the oil or dripping, and if it quickly crisps up and turns a nice yellow colour the oil is hot enough for cooking in. In some cookery books “tables” are given of the different temperatures required for cooking various articles, and in some of these it is stated that the temperature required for frying whitebait is 400° Fahr., which is quite absurd, for if this delicate little fish were put into oil at such a temperature it would be a delicate little fish no longer, but would be quickly transmuted into charred shreds, and would be quite uneatable. Oil or fat when it boils does not bubble up as water does, but a slight smoke arises from it when near boiling point, and when this is seen it is very near burning point also. Another simple plan for

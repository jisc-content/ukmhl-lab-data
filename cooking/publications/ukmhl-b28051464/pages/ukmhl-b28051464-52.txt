Recipes for Soups. 4S into a very clean saucepan, and boil gently till the liquor is reduced to rather less than two quarts. Place the meat extract and sugar in a basin and strain the boiling liquor over it through a fine hair sieve. Stir well, put into a clean saucepan, and bring nearly to a boil, then pour in the whites of eggs well whisked and the crushed shells. (These are put in for the purpose of clarifying the soup, because they gather all impurities to them.) Mix well and boil up, then allow it to boil gently for ten minutes without touching or moving the saucepan, because if moved the clearing process will be interfered with. Then draw the saucepan quietly to the side of the fire and let it stand for twenty minutes, after which pass it through a jelly-bag.* It ought to be as clear as crystal; if not, pass it through the bag till it is clear. Boil up, add a glass of sherry, and serve. Note.â€”Those who try this soup will admit the absurd extravagance of many cookery book recipes involving quantities of stock meat, etc., for making clear soup. The above soup is quite fit for serving at any dinner- party, and the actual cost of making is extremely small. It may be varied by adding some green peas, or scraps of carrots and turnips chopped fine or cut out with fancy cutters, or Italian paste letters, previously boiled tender. It is just as good if made the day before it is wanted and heated up. * A jelly-bag costs but half-a-crown and will last for years ; an old bag is better than a new one, as it is thicker. There is no saving in making a jelly-bag at home.

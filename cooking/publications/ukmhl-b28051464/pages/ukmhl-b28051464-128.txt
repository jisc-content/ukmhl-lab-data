124 Pastry, Sweets, Etc. drain off the liquor, put the plums on a dish, and return the liquor to the saucepan with half a pound more sugar to the pint, and boil till it is a thick syrup. Have a flat dish covered with short crust (p. 117) baked, but allowed to brown as little as possible. Divide each plum and take out the stones, spread the plums over the crust (it should have a slightly raised border round the dish), and pour on them the thick syrup; pour it on slowly so that it may have time to sink in and not over- flow. Put into the oven for ten minutes and serve. PRUNE MOULD. Requisites.—One pound of prunes, five tablespoonfuls of claret (cheap claret at one shilling a bottle does very well), six tablespoonfuls of water, two ounces of castor sugar, half an ounce of gelatine. Method.—Stew the prunes in the water till tender (if the prunes are hard they will need nearly two hours stew- ing and rather more than the above quantity of water, but the best bottled prunes are tender, and are the most suitable for this dish, but they are more expensive. If the cheaper kind of prunes are used, wash them well before stewing), take out the stones, add the claret, sugar, and gelatine dissolved in just enough water to cover it. Pour into a border mould which has a space in the middle— the mould should first be dipped in water. Turn out when cold, and fill centre with custard or whipped cream, and if desired garnish with blanched almonds cut in spikes, or glact: cherries.

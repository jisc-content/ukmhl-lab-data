Pour over it half a pint of mushroom ketchup, half a pint of vinegar (if the roe is small less of these will be needed), add a seasoning of cayenne and salt, and three-quarters of a pound of salt butter broken up in pieces. Then put the whole into an enamelled saucepan and stir con- stantly; let it simmer for about ten to fifteen minutes, and pour into small jars;’ when cold cover with greased paper, or pour oiled butter over the top.

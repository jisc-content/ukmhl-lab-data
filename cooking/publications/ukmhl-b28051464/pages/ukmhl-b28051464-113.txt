109 H orse-Radish Sauce. Note.—A few drops of chilli vinegar may be added if hot condiments are liked, and to some tastes the addition of a little finely chopped onion when the sauce is used (not bottled with it) would be considered an improve- ment, or the vinegar taken from a jar of pickled onions may be used instead of plain vinegar. GRAVY FOR ROAST OR BAKED MEAT. Take the dripping-pan in or over which the joint has been cooked, pour off nearly all the fat, doing it very gently so as not to disturb the sediment, pour in a cup- ful of boiling water, a good pinch of salt, and if wanted thickened, a spoonful of flour; place the pan on edge of fire, and stir the gravy well while boiling for three minutes. Pour round the meat, never over it. HORSE-RADISH SAUCE. Requisites.—Three tablespoonfuls of finely scraped horse-radish, two tablespoonfuls of cream or milk, two or three tablespoonfuls of vinegar, one large teaspoonful of castor sugar, a small teaspoonful of salt, half a tea- spoonful of black or white pepper, two teaspoonfuls of French, or one of English, mustard. Method.—Mix all the ingredients thoroughly, make an hour or so before wanted, and serve hot or cold in a sauce-boat. If required hot, put the sauce in a jar, which stand in a saucepan of boiling water till the sauce is hot. It must not boil.

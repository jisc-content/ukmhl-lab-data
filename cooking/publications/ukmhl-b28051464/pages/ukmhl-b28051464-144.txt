CHAPTER XIV. INEXPENSIVE PRESERVES. HINTS ON MAKING PRESERVES. i. Don’t try to economise by buying cheap sugar for jam-making; it is the dearest in the end, because it throws up a great deal of scum, which in removing causes waste of jam. 2. Don’t try to economise by buying damaged or over- ripe fruit for preserving; it will not make good jam. 3. Remember that fruit for jam-making should not be wet from dew or rain, nor should it be dusty. 4. An enamelled pan is the best for preserving; iron pans or spoons injure the colour. Copper pans must be very clean and bright, or they may prove poisonous Alway use a wooden spoon for stirring. 5. Never place the preserving-pan directly on the fire, or the contents may burn; it should be on trivet bar or hot plate. 6. Don’t add the sugar until the preserve has boiled

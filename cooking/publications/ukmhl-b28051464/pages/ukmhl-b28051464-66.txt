If the fricassee is desired brown, mushroom ketchup may be mixed with it, or flap mushrooms, first slightly fried, may be stewed in the milk, or it may be coloured pink with anchovy or tomato sauce. When the sauce is suitably flavoured, thicken it (not too thick) with corn flour, put in the fish and heat it thoroughly, but do not let it get mashed or boiled. Make on a hot dish a neat wall of boiled rice, or of potatoes smoothly mashed with milk, put the fricassee in the middle, and serve hot. The mashed potatoes or rice will also help to make the fish “ go further.” Stewed mushrooms, if procurable, are a great addition to this dish. FISH A l’eSPAGNOLE. This is a favourite Spanish dish, and the same recipe may be used with remains of cold fowl, turkey, rabbit, etc. Take the remains of any kind of white fish, and the same quantity of rice that has been boiled till tender in water; mix with them several tomatoes (the more the better) which have been skinned and stewed in a little butter; add some salt, pepper, and a little more butter, and after mixing all well together heat in a saucepan till thoroughly hot, taking care they do not burn. A rub of garlic, either on the saucepan or dish in which the mixture is served, will be a great improvement to many tastes.

146 Inexpensive Preserves. TO PRESERVE RHUBARB (VERY GOOD). Requisites.—Rhubarb, sugar, a little whole ginger, almonds. Method.—To every pound of fruit allow one pound of sugar. Cut the rhubarb, after wiping each stalk clean, into lengths of about two inches, and put it with half the quantity of sugar into an earthenware pan, and let it stand till next day, then pour the syrup from the rhubarb and boil it with the rest of the sugar till it thickens, then put in the rhubarb and sliced ginger, about half an ounce of this to every two pounds of rhubarb, and some blanched sweet almonds split (the quantity of these must be left to the discretion of the maker). Toil the whole gently for an hour and a half, not longer, or it will become candied.

108 Sauces and Salad Dressings. Note.—Most cookery books direct that onion should be put into bread sauce; this is a great mistake, as the flavour would be disagreeable to many people, and is not suited to go with the delicate flavour of chicken, turkey, and pheasant, with which bread sauce is principally served. ECONOMICAL MAYONAISE SAUCE FOR BOTTLING. Requisites.—One pint of milk, one tablespoonful of flour, one wineglassful of vinegar, or better still, tarragon and plain vinegar mixed in equal quantities, two raw eggs, four ounces of butter, one tablespoonful of mustard. Method.—Put the flour into a small basin and add to it two tablespoonfuls of cold milk taken from the pint, blend this together with the back of a spoon until it is absolutely free from lumps and quite smooth, put the rest of the milk into a clean enamelled saucepan, and when it simmers pour in the flour and milk mixture and the butter and boil for fully five minutes, stirring well and taking care it does not get the least burnt, and while still hot, but not boiling, stir thoroughly in the eggs, which must be carefully cleared of the gelatinous thread which clings to the yolk, and well whisked, the mustard, and lastly when nearly cold, the vinegar. When quite cold bottle and cork well. It will keep for a long time if well corked, and is a delicious accompani- ment to cold meat, fish, salad, hard-boiled eggs, or any other dish which requires mayonaise sauce.

CHAPTER VIII. ECONOMICAL ENTREES AND SAVOURY MEAT DISHES. ASPIC JELLY. A PRETTY ENTREE. Make some jelly as directed for wine jelly at p. 126 but omit sugar, lemon, wine, and spices, and flavour it instead with onion or shalot, parsley, pepper and salt, boiled in the jelly, and tarragon vinegar added after the boiling. While this is still liquid, dip some pretty little shapes or moulds into cold water, place m them such things as shreds of the white part of lettuce, shrimps or prawns picked whole from the shell, whole oysters, shreds of hard-boiled egg, capers, peas, scraps of carrot, little bits of calfâ€™s head, chicken, fish, etc., or any such thing as convenience or taste may direct. Fill up with the liquid jelly, and when it is set turn out carefully, and serve garnished with sprigs of parsley, endive, etc. A little taste and practice will enable all sorts of odds and ends to be utilised in this way encased in aspic jelly. To produce a good effect the jelly must be made as clear as possible.

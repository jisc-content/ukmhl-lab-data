If the meat be put into a slow oven or to a dull fire, or too far off from the fire, the meat will only be gradually warmed, and the albumen instead of being quickly hardened on the outside will be dissolved, and therefore the juice will be drawn out. The result of such cooking will be soddened instead of savoury meat. After the first ten or fifteen minutes of brisk cooking the meat may be drawn a little further from the fire, or the heat of the oven may be gradually lowered to a point at which the meat will just slightly frizzle and can be finished at this degree of heat. . Boiling meat to serve as a joint, the same object is necessary, i.e., to form a seal or casing of hardened albumen round the meat, therefore it must be plunged into fast boiling water, and the water must be kept boil- ing for ten minutes, then for the rest of the time it should simmer. Large pieces of meat are more suitable for boiling than small pieces, which it is more economical to reserve for stewing. If the meat or bones, however be intended to make soup, exactly the opposite procedure must take place, because the object then is to extract all the goodness out of them into the water, therefore they should be cut or broken small, put into cold water, and gradually brought to a brisk simmer.* In making beef —or other meat—tea for invalids the water should not simmer, it should always be kept just under the simmer- ing point, in order to extract the albumen and juices is llme and gelatine iu bone; to extract these, prolonged boiling of bones is necessary in order to have rich soup from them. °

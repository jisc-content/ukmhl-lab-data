151 Savoury Sea Biscuits. CANADIAN TOAST. Cut four rather thick slices from a stale tin loaf, toast them a bright, crisp brown. Put four ounces of salt butter into a small basin of boiling water; when it floats on the top skim it off, a spoonful at a time, leaving a very small quantity of water in the spoon; pour some over each side of the slices until all the butter is used, pile on a hot plate, and put it in the oven for five minutes. SAVOURY TOAST. Put some clarified beef-dripping or bacon fat into a frying-pan, season it with salt, black pepper, mushroom ketchup, Harvey or Worcestershire sauce, and fry in it when nearly boiling some slices of a stale tin loaf from which the crust has been trimmed off. Drain before the fire. SAVOURY SEA BISCUITS. Soak some captainâ€™s biscuits in milk, dust with salt and pepper, put a bit of butter on each, and make very hot in the oven.

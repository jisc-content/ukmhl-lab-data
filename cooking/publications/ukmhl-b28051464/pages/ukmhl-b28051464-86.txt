Using Up Cold Meat. 82 into small sausages, brush with egg or milk, dip in fine bread crumbs, and fry a golden brown in plenty of fat. MACARONI VEAL. Mince half a pound of cold veal, mix with four ounces of minced ham and two tablespoonfuls of bread crumbs, pepper, salt, and powdered mace to taste; add a season- ing of chopped parsley, lemon peel, thyme and marjoram, a squeeze of lemon juice, a well-whisked egg, and enough stock to moisten the whole. Put this when mixed smoothly into a pie dish, cover with half a pound of macaroni which has been boiled till tender in salt and water (about half-an-hour), put a layer of fine bread crumbs over this, strew bits of butter over it, and bake for twenty-five minutes. If not sufficiently browned in the oven, may be finished before the fire. MEAT PASTRY. Take rather thin slices of any kind of cold meat, season well with pepper and salt, roll each slice up with a mushroom which has been fried for a minute or two in clarified dripping, or better still, in bacon fat; or if no mushrooms are at hand, roll the meat up with a slice of tomato, enclose each slice in a piece of puff paste (see p. 118), and fry in clarified fat till the paste is a light golden colour. Drain before the fire, and serve very hot.

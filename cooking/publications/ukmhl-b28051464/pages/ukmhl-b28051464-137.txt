133 Zebra Pudding. ZEBRA PUDDING. Requisites.—Bread crumbs, jam, custard made with custard powder, or an egg or two. Method.—Butter a basin, shake crumbs all over it, then put a thick layer of fine crumbs in the bottom, then a layer of any kind of jam, then more crumbs, and so on in layers till the basin is full. Over all pour a custard just sufficient to slightly moisten the whole; one egg to half a pint of milk (or Swiss milk) will be rich enough, or custard powder may be used. Cover with buttered paper, steam for three-quarters of an hour. Different sorts of jam or marmalade may be used. This is a good way for using up remnants of jams. Note.—To prevent pudding-cloths sticking to the bottoms of saucepans and burning, it is only necessary to put a plate into the saucepan under the pudding.

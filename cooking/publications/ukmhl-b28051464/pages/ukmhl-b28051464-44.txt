ao Methods of Cooking. testing the heat of fat or oil to see if it be fit for frying is to dip the fingers into cold water and sprinkle them into the pan; if the oil hisses up sharply the heat is right. . Frying in the real sense cannot be done on a flat pan, it should be done in a deep pan, a stewpan or saucepan, for instance, and much the best plan is to have a frying- basket; this is a wire basket into which the fish, cutlets, rissoles, etc., are put, and the basket is lowered into the pan and withdrawn when the cooking is completed. Some people may imagine that on account of the quantity of fat or oil used by this method of frying it is not economical; this is quite a mistake, for the same fat will do over and over again. It has been truly said, “ It is far cheaper in the long run to use two pounds of fat and cook things properly, and make the same fat do fifty times, than to use two ounces, cook the fish badly, and let the remains of the fat go into the grease-pot.” This is very true. The fried article must never, of course, be transferred straight from the frying-basket to the dish. It must first be turned on to blotting or kitchen paper (this costs about fivepence a quire), or on to an inverted sieve or a hot, clean cloth, and allowed to stand for a minute before the fire; the superfluous oil will quickly disappear. The only thing for which the flat pan should be used is for “dry frying,” as for instance, sausages, eggs, etc., and for this a flat pan with a little hot grease does very well. Bacon is much better if toasted before the fire than fried on a pan.

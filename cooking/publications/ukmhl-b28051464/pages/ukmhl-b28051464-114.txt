iio Sauces and Salad Dressings. MAYONAISE SAUCE (GOOD). Put the yolks of two eggs in a basin, carefully remove the gelatinous string, have ready a teacupful of salad oil and a teacup three parts full of equal quantities of tarragon vinegar and plain vinegar mixed, put a table- spoonful of thick cream, two teaspoonfuls of castor sugar, half a teaspoonful of salt, a teaspoonful of French mus- tard, and a sprinkling of white pepper upon the egg yolks; then take a dropper (the dropper used for filling a stylo- graph pen is just the right kind) and drop upon the egg first a few drops of oil, then a few drops of vinegar, and all the time keep stirring with the other hand, or rather blending the whole, with the back of a wooden spoon, until it is all thoroughly incorporated and quite smooth. If a tablespoonful or two of white jelly (such as remains from the water in which a knuckle of veal, calvesâ€™ feet, etc., have been boiled) is at hand, it may be substituted for, or used in addition to, the cream, rubbing it well in. The secret of making good mayonaise sauce is to drop the oil and vinegar alternately, and gradually to blend well so that the sauce may not curdle. The mayonaise may be coloured green with spinach or parsley juice* (the former is best, as it has not so much flavour), or pink with beet juice. * Cook some spinach with only the water that adheres to it after washing. When tender squeeze in a piece of muslin and a strong green juice will be expressed.

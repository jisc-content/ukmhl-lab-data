58 CHAPTER V. ECONOMICAL FISH COOKERY. Steaming.—This is an excellent method for cooking small fish, such as whiting and haddock, or for fillets or slices of cod, sole, etc., in cases where frying is likely to disagree. It is a much more economical way of cooking fish than boiling, because none of the nutriment of the fish is lost in the water. Method.—Put the fish, after being well washed in cold water, into a basin or jar, and either place this in a steamer over a saucepan of boiling water, or in a sauce- pan with water coming more than half-way up the side of the basin, and let the water boil round the basin or jar, the top of which must be covered either with the well-fitting lid of the jar, or with a cloth dipped in boiling water, and securely tied over top, or with a piece of stout tissue paper, which has been well greased, twisted tightly all round the edges of the basin. Time required, a very little longer than for boiling. If any scum gathers on the fish rub it off with a clean cloth, and put any liquor that has exuded with the steam into the sauce.

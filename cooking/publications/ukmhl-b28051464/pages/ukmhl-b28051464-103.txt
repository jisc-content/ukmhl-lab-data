99 Stewed Veal. spoonful of ketchup or any sauce at hand, pepper and salt, clarified dripping, thickening. Method.—The steak should be thick and without much fat; cut it into neat pieces and fry it on each side for two or three minutes in the dripping, just to brown it; the vegetables, pared and sliced, should then be fried in the pan after the meat, then put both meat and vegetables into a stew-pan with a closely-fitting lid, add the water or stock, and simmer very gently for two hours; then lift out the meat on to a hot dish, cover, skim the liquor if very greasy, add pepper, salt, and ketchup, and thicken; pour while boiling over the pieces of steak, and serve very hot.* STEWED VEAL. Put two pounds of veal cutlet into milk to cover it well, with a blade of mace, an onion stuck with cloves, and a teaspoonful of peppercorns. Stew gently for rather more than an hour, skim, strain. Thicken the milk when the meat is removed either with arrowroot, or if the dish is desired to be very good, with two eggs (these must not boil or they will curdle; put the milk and eggs into a jug as for a custard, stand in boil- ing water, and stir till thick). Add half a pint of boiled green peas, place on a dish and border with mashed potatoes. * Breast or “scrag” (i.e., throat part of neck) of mutton or lamb may be stewed in the same way. Peas may be substituted for the vegetables if desired.

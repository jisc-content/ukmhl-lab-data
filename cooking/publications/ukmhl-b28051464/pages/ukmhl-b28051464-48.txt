Methods of Cooking. 44 it firm. Six ounces of salt to gallon of water. Sea water is best if it can be had. Never pour water over fish in fish kettle, it breaks the skin; lower the fish into the water. Fish should simmer briskly; if it boils fast, the outside will be broken before the inside is cooked. Vegetables.—Water should be salted as for fish. All vegetables (except old potatoes, dried peas and beans, and Jerusalem artichokes) should be put into plenty of boiling water, which should be kept boiling briskly without a cover till they are done, when they must be at once lifted out, as they become soddened if left lying in the water. Old and stale vegetables require longer cooking than young fresh ones. “Vegetables boiled in water to which salt has been added are not so tender as they would be if no salt were added. The salt is generally put in to preserve the colour” (Wynter-Blyth, Diet, of Hygiene). Some cooks put a spoonful of moist sugar instead of salt into the water with green vegetables —and it would probably not affect their tenderness. The use of common washing soda in boiling vegetables should never be allowed. It is a caustic; and though it may make greens greener, it will injure the coating of the stomach. A couple of lumps of sugar and some mint should always be boiled with peas and new potatoes, their flavour is greatly enhanced thereby. Note.—If a crust of bread toasted till nearly black be put into the water where greens are boiling, it will prevent the horrible smell that arises when they are cooking.

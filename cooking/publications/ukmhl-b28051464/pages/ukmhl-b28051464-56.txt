Recipes for Soups. 52 boiling, parboil (after washing and soaking in warm water) and remove the skin, pound up with a spoon, mixing in a seasoning of nepaul pepper, salt, and powdered sage; roll them into balls, dip in beaten egg, and then in very fine bread crumbs, and fry in clarified fat till brown; drain, then add to soup. OYSTER SOUP. Can be made with tinned or foreign oysters. Requisites.—One tin of oysters, or a dozen or two of cooking oysters, one quart of the liquor in which either rabbit, fowl, or knuckle of veal was boiled, or stock made from veal or chicken bones, one pint of milk, white pepper, thickening of corn flour. Method.—Thicken the stock with the corn flour blended with the milk, boiling for five minutes, and season with pepper. Put the oysters and their liquor into an enamelled saucepan and let them become as hot as possible without boiling; if they boil they will become tough. After ten minutes slow stewing by the fire with a plate over the saucepan, put them into a hot tureen and pour the stock over them; serve with croutons (ie., small dice of bread fried in clarified dripping). If tinned oysters are used salt need not be added as they are salt enough. This soup can be made very rich and good by substituting cream for milk, and adding well-whisked yolks of eggs when the soup is in the tureen.

See that the pork is very good and sweet, rub each piece thoroughly with plenty of coarse salt, lay them one on top of another in a glazed earthenware pan, with plenty of salt between each layer and on top, cover with a cloth, and on top of this put a piece of wood with a weight on it to keep the pork in the brine which will form from the melted salt; cover with a closely-fitting lid, as if the air gains entrance the pork will not keep well. If properly pickled it will keep good for eighteen months or two years. Some people use one part of saltpetre to two of salt; it makes the lean of the meat red, but is not really necessary. Pork should be salted on the same day that the pig is killed.

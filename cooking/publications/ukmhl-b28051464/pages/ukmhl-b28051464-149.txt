Rhubarb Syrup. T45 operations. Do not cover till the day after putting in pots. RHUBARB SYRUP. Requisites.—Six pounds of rhubarb, weighed after the rough end of each stick is cut off, three quarts of cold water, three pounds of lump sugar, thinly pared rind and juice of two small juicy lemons, six cloves, a piece of root ginger about the size of half the little finger. Method.—Wipe , but do not skin the rhubarb, cut it into finger lengths, put them into a saucepan with the water and boil until the rhubarb is quite broken up, pass it through a canvas bag into a pan and let it stand till cold, then add the sugar, cloves, ginger, lemon-peel (taking care that only the yellow of the rind is pared off; if the white underskin is left on it will impart a dis- agreeable bitter flavour), and juice, and boil again till it becomes reduced in quantity and a little thick. When cold bottle and cork. This makes a delicious and most wholesome drink mixed with cold water, and also greatly improves the flavour of stewed or baked apples if a little be mixed with them. It makes an excellent accompani- ment to all sorts of farinaceous or bread puddings simply served as sauce, hot or cold. Note.—The amount of sugar may be increased or diminished according to individual taste, so also may the ginger and cloves be increased or omitted altogether by those who dislike their flavour. 10

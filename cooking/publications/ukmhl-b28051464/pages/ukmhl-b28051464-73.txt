Whitebait. 69 over it half a teaspoonful of vinegar, and cover with a layer of bread crumbs dusted with pepper and salt, moistened with the liquor of the scallops and a little vinegar, and strew bits of butter all over. Bake for twenty minutes, and brown the crumbs if necessary before the fire, adding a little more butter if requisite. WHITEBAIT. Some people may think recipes for cooking whitebait out of place in pages devoted to eco?iomical cookery, but they are not so in reality. Whitebait is not at all an expensive fish, but many look on it as a sort of unattain- able luxury only at the command of those possessing a first-rate chefâ€”in fact, some foolish people if they are giving a dinner actually hire a man especially to cook the whitebait! Now any girl of average intelligence can with a little practice learn to cook whitebait to perfec- tion; the only expense attendant on it will be the cost of two or three pints of the fish, which she will prpbably spoil during her practising. There is no need to invest in thermometers for testing if the frying fat be of the right heat, as by throwing a bit of bread crumb into the fat its heat can be accurately tested. If it crisps up a nice light brown in half a minute it is of the right heat for cooking the whitebait. You must, however, invest to the extent of two or three shillings in a frying-basket, as whitebait cannot be cooked without it. The basket will of course last for years, with care.

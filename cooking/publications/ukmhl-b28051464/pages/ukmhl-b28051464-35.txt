Using up Broken Bread. 31 Here are twelve ways for using broken bread :— 1. Grated fine and used for puddings; by this means the smallest scraps may be used.

Grated and used in rissoles, croquettes, kromeskies, etc. See Chapter VII. 4. As pulled bread to serve with cheese, p. 138. 5. For bread sauce, p. 107. 6. In soup, p. 46. 7. In boiled bread and milk for children, p. 152. 8. Dried in the oven on a tin till quite brown and crisp, pounded in a pestle and mortar, or rolled between paper with rolling-pin and sifted through a wire sieve. This, prepared at odd leisure moments and kept in a tin canister, is then always at hand for dusting over a ham or boiled bacon when the skin is stripped off after boiling Bread crumbs of this sort also make very rich brown puddings. 9. Rubbed fine and used for dipping fillets of fish or cutlets in after dipping them in milk or beaten egg or batter previous to frying. 10. For making forcemeat and stuffings of various sorts. 11. Cut in little squares and fried to serve with soup. 12. For mixing with batter for children’s pancakes, see p. 154.

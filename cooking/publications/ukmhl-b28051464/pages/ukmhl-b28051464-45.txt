Steaming can be done either in a steamer (i.e., a tin cylinder with a lid and holes in the bottom, and made to fit on a saucepan), or in a basin or jar standing in a pot of boiling water, or in a specially constructed “cook- ing pot,” which is made sometimes with six receptacles, one over the other, the different contents of each being cooked by the steam from the water in the lowest one. Potatoes and puddings are much better steamed than boiled in water. Toasting is the most delicate of all methods of cooking, but is of course only suited for small things. A trout, for instance, enclosed in buttered paper and slung on the hooks of a Dutch oven and toasted in front of a clear fire, makes a “plat” to satisfy the most epicurean taste.

Pork and Veal (which are dangerous to eat unless very well cooked), twenty minutes for each pound, and twenty minutes added to the time needed to cook the whole. This, it must be

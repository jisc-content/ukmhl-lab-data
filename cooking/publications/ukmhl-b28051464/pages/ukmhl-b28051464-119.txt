CHAPTER XI. HOME-MADE BREAD—PASTRY—SWEETS—CAKES. HOME-MADE BREAD. Requisites.—Seven pounds of flour, two ounces of German yeast, half an ounce of fine salt, water, or milk and water. (The German yeast can be bought at a grocer’s. It should be fresh.) Method.—Thoroughly mix the salt with the flour, dissolve the yeast in a teacupful of warm water, make a hollow in the middle of the flour, and add very gradually the barm (i.e., the yeast dissolved in water), and just enough extra warm water (never cold or hot) to make a firm dough. Then knead, with the doubled- up fists, for fully fifteen minutes, doing it thoroughly. When the dough has been sufficiently kneaded none of it will stick to the hands, then cover the basin with a warmed cloth, and stand it near the fire for an hour, when it will have risen and show cracks on the top, then knead it up again thoroughly and make into loaves, or fill tin shapes three parts full of the dough.

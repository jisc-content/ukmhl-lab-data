47 Clear Soup. CARROT SOUP. Requisites.—A dozen carrots (if very big, eight will do), one small onion, two quarts of water, or what of course is better, stock, or the water in which any kind of meat, tripe, rabbit, or fowl has been boiled. Method.—Wash, scrape, and slice the carrots, and boil in the water or stock till tender; if the carrots are young less than an hour will do. Then place a very clean hair sieve over a large basin, pour the contents of the sauce- pan into the sieve, and rub the carrots through with the back of a wooden spoon, occasionally taking a teacupful of the soup that has flowed through and pouring it over the carrots to help them through the sieve. Any hard, stringy part that remains behind must be thrown away. Put back in the saucepan and boil up. If the soup, when the carrots are all rubbed through, is not as thick as cream, it must be thickened with flour or corn flour, as at p. 32. CLEAR SOUP (ECONOMICAL AND EXCELLENT).

Method.—Wash and scrape carrots, peel onions and turnips, and put them with the water, pepper and salt

63 Potted Fish. GURNET OR HADDOCK, STUFFED AND BAKED. Tell the fishmonger to send the haddock prepared for stuffing. Make a stuffing of bread crumbs, seasoning of pepper, salt, thyme, parsley, and marjoram, etc, the grated or thinly-scraped rind and the juice of a lemon, or vinegar if a lemon cannot be procured, and suet or clarified beef-dripping finely chopped. The proportion of this last should nearly equal the bread crumbs. Moisten all slightly with milk, or much better, with a beaten egg, stuff the fish, and stitch it up with a needle and coarse thread. Place in a baking-tin with plenty of dripping over and round the fish, and bake for half-an-hour. Remove the stitching thread, drain the fish before the fire, and serve on a hot fish napkin, with garnish of lemon and parsley. Make a little milk sauce (p. 112) and flavour with anchovy, ketchup, or other sauce; send this to table in a sauce-boat. POTTED FISH (MACKEREL, HERRINGS, OR SPRATS). EXCELLENT BREAKFAST DISH. Tell the fishmonger to prepare the fish for cooking by cutting off heads, tails, and cleaning insides. Wipe them in a clean cloth to remove scales, and dip each lightly in fine flour, shaking to remove any superfluous lumps. Slice an onion (raw) and lay it in the bottom of a pie dish, with a teaspoonful of peppercorns, and two or three bay leaves (can be got at most green-grocers). Lay the fish neatly on these, sprinkle more peppercorns over,

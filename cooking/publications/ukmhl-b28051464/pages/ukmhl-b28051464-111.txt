CHAPTER X. SAUCES AND SALAD DRESSINGS. APPLE SAUCE. (To serve with Koast Goose or Pork.) Pare four or six apples, slice, leaving out the core and pips put into a saucepan with a tablespoonful or two ot water, one lump of sugar, and a bit of butter the size of a walnut. Simmer over the fire, stirring occasionally till the sauce is quite smooth. Serve hot. . Apple sauce must not be sweet; the acid is intended as a corrective to the richness of the goose or pork. BREAD SAUCE. (To serve with Roast Fowl, Pheasant, etc.) Put a breakfast-cupful of bread crumbs into a small saucepan, add a teaspoonful of peppercorns, half a tea- spoonful of salt, a blade of mace, and just enough milk to cover the whole. Simmer till smooth, stirring well to keep it from burning.

Melt a little butter or the fat of the tongue or clarified dripping in a small saucepan, put in the tongue and eggs, and stir over the fire till the egg is set, spread upon toast, dry or buttered, and serve hot, or spread upon bread fried in dripping. Chopped parsley may be added if liked, and if necessary the egg may be omitted, the tongue, seasoned, being heated in butter or fat and spread on toast. HADDOCK, SCRAMBLED. Boil a dried haddock in water for a few minutes till it comes easily off the bone, then with a fish knife and fork scrape all the fish free from skin and bone, put it into a saucepan with a little milk and a bit of butter and pepper, and stir it round till very hot. Spread on toasted rounds of bread. Serve hot. DEVILLED HERRINGS. Open the herrings and take out insides and back bones, cut off heads and tails, scrape off scales; rub the inside well with a mixture of made mustard, black and red pepper, and a few drops of vinegar; close the fish, rub the outsides with butter, pepper well, and grill or cook in a Dutch oven for about ten minutes.

As to the value of clarified beef dripping for frying, and the mistake of allowing it to be a “perquisite,” the following quotation from Sir Henry Thompson’s Food and Feeding is worth giving :—“ For frying, nothing perhaps is better than well clarified beef dripping, such as is produced, often abundantly, in every English kitchen; but the time-honoured traditions of our perquisite system enables any English cook to sell this for herself at small price to a little trader round the corner, while she buys, at her employer’s cost, a quantity of pork lard for frying material at double the price obtained for the dripping. Lard is, moreover, the worst menstruum for the purpose, the most difficult to work in so as to free the matters fried in it from grease; and we might be glad to buy back our own dripping from the aforesaid little trader at a profit to him of cent, per cent., if only the purchase could be diplomatically negotiated. But so sweet is acquisition by way of perquisite, that none of the present race of cooks appear disposed to part with this particular one for any consideration which can be offered. They are doubtless after their own fashion true to their order, and regard in. the light of sacrilege any interference with their principles and tradition.” This may be all very well for Sir Henry’s cooks, but in the kitchen presided over by a housewife who is managing a small income such things

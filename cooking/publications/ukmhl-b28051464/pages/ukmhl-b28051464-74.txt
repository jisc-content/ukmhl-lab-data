;o Economical Fish Cookery. FRIED WHITEBAIT. Procure the fish as fresh as possible; they should be bright and shining, and free from sea-weed, etc. Have a clean cloth well floured; put a small handful of white- bait at a time into this, roll the fish gently in it so that they may be equally floured, turn them into the frying- basket, shaking off carefully all unnecessary flour; have a deep stewpan nearly full of well clarified fat, see that it is of the right heat by testing with a bit of crumb of bread,* plunge the basket into it, and cook for about two minutes if the fish are very small, or three minutes if they are large. Drain on a sieve turned upside down before the fire. When all are done, pile on a hot napkin on a hot dish, and serve with thin brown bread and butter, cut lemon, and cayenne handed round on a separate dish. The bread should be divested of crust, buttered with good fresh butter, two slices pressed together sandwich- wise and cut in triangles. The cayenne cruet may be placed in the middle of the plate, the sandwiches and quartered lemon prettily disposed round it. DEVILLED WHITEBAIT (RED DEVIL). As the fish is being dished dust with cayenne or nepaul pepper, or both mixed. DEVILLED WHITEBAIT (BLACK DEVIL). Dust as above, but with black pepper. * See p. 39.

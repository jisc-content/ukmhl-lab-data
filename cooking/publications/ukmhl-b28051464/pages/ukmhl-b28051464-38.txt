CARE IN FLAVOURING. Over-salting or over-sweetening may be the cause of great waste, in fact all kinds of flavourings, condi- ments, and seasonings should be added with great care. Remember, it is always easy to add more sugar, pepper, or salt at table, but it is impossible to take out any of these when once put in. Dishes spoiled in this way may be made eatable next day by some additional stock or material to dilute the over-flavoured dish, but that is not much satisfaction to those who have lost their dinner, or part of it, by reason of the cook’s carelessness.* English cooks hardly ever use garlic as a flavouring, yet few things come up to it if used properly.

iS Kitchen Economy. oftener cold than hot is the neglect of thoroughly cleaning the flues. (The neglect of drawing out the damper of the special flue leading to the bath pipes is of course another reason why baths are often cold when they are required to be hot.) A vast deal of good fuel is thrown away in nearly every house in the shape of what careless servants call ashes. Now ashes and cinders are two very different things. Ashes have their use, but it is not in the fire-grate. They may be substituted for sand for scouring pots; they are very useful for fowl runs, but they are of no use for fuel. Cinders, on the other hand, make excellent fuel. For broiling, cinders added to coal make a capital clear fire; and for stewing, which demands a slow fire, a fire plentifully fed with cinders instead of coal is much the best. If the servants can be induced to use it regularly, a “cinder sifter”—i.e., a sort of wooden box on rockers with a wire tray and a closely fitting lid—-will soon repay its cost. It is the only satisfactory method by which cinders can be separated from ashes without causing dirt and dust to fly about. A 6d. wire shovel is the next best thing for the purpose, though of course it has not the advantages of the box. The use of a gas “ring,” or a small oil stove, will also save fuel immensely, as in warm weather the kitchen fire can be allowed to go out on days when boiling, steaming, stewing, or frying are the means employed for cooking, as all these operations for a small family can be conducted on these simple little contrivances.

WINE JELLY. Requisites.—One quart of jelly from calves’ or pigs’ feet, or cow-heel (see p. 92), two lemons, whisked whites and crushed shells of two eggs, half a pound of loaf sugar, three-quarters of a pint of wine (Marsala, sherry, port, or champagne), eighteen cloves, two inches of stick cinnamon. Method.—Skim all fat from the jelly, put it with all the ingredients but the wine into a saucepan, stir well together, then place it on the fire, simmer for fifteen minutes, gently taking scum off as it rises, but the pan must not be shaken, dash in a wineglass of cold water, boil five minutes more, very gently draw pan to side of fire, cover with a cloth and let it stand without boiling for half-an-hour, then add the wine. Wring a jelly-bag out of boiling water, sling it between two chairs before the fire, with a pan under, and pour the contents of saucepan into it. If the jelly is not clear run it several times through the bag until it is clear. A little gelatine will make the jelly stiffer if necessary. It must be dissolved and added to the other ingredients.

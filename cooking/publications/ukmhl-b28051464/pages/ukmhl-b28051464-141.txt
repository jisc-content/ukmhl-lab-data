Cheese Straws. 137 quantity of very fine bread crumbs, season with pepper and salt, and moisten well with milk, or better still with cream (a tablespoonful of cream from a sixpenny jug of thick cream mixed with a little milk would do admirably), thickly butter a small flat pie-dish, or some little fancy- moulds, put in the mixture, strew bits of butter on the top and bake, or, better still, cook in a Dutch oven before the fire till well browned on the top and cooked all through—about fifteen to twenty minutes if the fire is good. Sprinkle finely chopped parsley over the top a few minutes before the cooking is finished. Serve very hot. A PLAIN SAVOURY (CHEAP). Fry some small round unsweetened biscuits in clarified dripping, drain, dust with cayenne or nepaul pepper, spread with bloater paste, dust this with black pepper and a pinch of finely chopped parsley, add two or three drops of chilli or tarragon vinegar or lemon juice to each, and heat in the oven. Serve hot. CHEESE STRAWS, OR CHEESE BISCUITS. (These take the place of plain cheese at dinner-parties. They are much better and cheaper if made at home than if bought.) Requisites.—Two ounces of grated parmesan cheese (can be bought ready grated if desired), one ounce of lard, one ounce of butter, two ounces of flour, salt, cayenne.

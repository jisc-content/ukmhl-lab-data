116 Pastry, Sweets, Etc. The difference between baking in a tin or without is, that when baked in tins the bread is not so crusty as when baked without. The loaves or tins must be put into an oven that is sufficiently hot, or they will not rise properly; on this point the success of the baking will principally depend. If the oven is not hot enough at first the bread will surely be heavy. The proper tem- perature of the oven for baking bread is 410° Fahr. In bakeries the ovens have thermometers for registering the heat and preventing failure in this respect, but we can’t expect such things in ordinary households; but a simple test wi.l show the state of the oven. Place a slice of stale bread in the oven; if the oven is at the right temperature for bread-baking, this will turn golden brown in three minutes; or shake some flour on the oven shelf, and if it becomes brown in a minute, the dough may be put in. Far less damage to the bread will be done by putting dough into an oven that is too hot than too cool—you can scrape off burnt crust, but nothing can make a heavy loaf light after bad baking. Bread made with milk instead of water is very nice for afternoon tea. All sorts of additions and alterations can be made to the loaves to suit different tastes. Currants (they should first be well washed and well dried) and sugar will make a nice plain cake; sultanas and large raisins will make a plum loaf; sugar and seeds will convert it into a seed loaf; or the loaves may be simply sweetened and brushed with whisked yolk of egg before baking.

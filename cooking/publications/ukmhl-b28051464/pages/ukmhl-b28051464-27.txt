Stewing. 23 simmer. Secondly, it is economical, because all kinds of things can be made into a savoury stew, which, cooked in any other way, would be almost uneatable. An ancient fowl, for instance, stewed by the simple calcula- tion of an hour for every year of its age, may be turned into an appetising and savoury dish, whereas if boiled or roasted it would bring disgrace on the household manager who permitted it to be served at her table. Thirdly, in stewing, every particle of nutriment (a certain proportion of which, according to Professor Letheby’s table, is evaporated in roasting, baking, and passes into the water in boiling) is preserved, for though extracted from the meat it is preserved in the gravy and vegetables. Then again, scrap pieces of various kinds of meat, poultry, etc., too small for boiling or roasting, may, when stewed together with scraps of vegetables, be converted into an excellent dish. Stewing has also one other important advantage for busy housewives. It is the simplest and least trouble- some of all methods of cooking, and therefore saves the most time, as it does not need much attention. Basting is needed in roasting and baking; skimming in boiling; in both the fire needs much attention.

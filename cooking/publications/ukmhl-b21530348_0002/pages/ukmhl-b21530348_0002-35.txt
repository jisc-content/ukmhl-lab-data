ARTISTIC EMBLEMATIC GROSSES PIECES. Military.—This is an arrangement of Drums, made of cakes piped and iced with white sugar, surmounted by a helmet and wreath made in sugar, and surrounded by shells and shot made of coloured sweet jellies. The wreath is made up of angelica and candied cherries. The stand is moulded in paste, and is a trophy of war. Natal.—This piece represents an Ironclad made of cake iced oyer with chocolate. The guns and figures are moulded in sugar; the ship’s boats, with sails, are constructed of either paste or chocolate: and the sea is made with sugar or paste tinted a light green beneath the foam.

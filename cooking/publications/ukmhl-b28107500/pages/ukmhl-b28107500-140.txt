132 parts broken ice and 1 part of rough salt; shake it well down, so that the mixture goes underneath the cup- board of the cave, and fill well up, so that the lid will just slide over the ice and salt; re- place the lids; now fill the mould with the frozen cream from the freezer, and see that it is well pressed or shaken into the mould ; place the mould for to 2 hours in the cave ; when ready, dip the mould for an instant in cold water, and turn out as a jelly. If you wish to keep the ice in shape ; after it is turned out it may be put back in the cave and will keep perfectly several hours, so that ices can be prepared long before they are required. When anything is freezing in the cave do not open the door oftener than is necessary. When the cave is done with remove the brine and wash out with boiling water, and see that it is put away dry. N.B.â€”Any ordinary copper mould may be used for the ices in this cave. For description, sizes, and prices of caves, see page 142.

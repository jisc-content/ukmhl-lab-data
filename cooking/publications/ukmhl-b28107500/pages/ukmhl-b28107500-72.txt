64 PUDDINGS N o. 105. ARPLEY PUDDING. 1 lb. apples £ lb. vugar 2 eggs 3 oz. bread crumbs 1£ oz. of suet 5 pint milk 2 or 3 cloves Short paste A little nutmeg Make a short paste of 6 oz. of flour (page 105), roll out as thinly as possible, and with this line a pie dish, which must be greased at the sides, and wetted on the very edge, to prevent the pastry from slipping inside; ornament the edge with cut leaves. Meanwhile peel, core, and cut in slices the apples; put them into an enamelled pan, with two tablespoonfuls of water, and two cloves, stew gently until soft; rub the pulp through a wire sieve, and sweeten; mix with the bread crumbs the suet finely minced, one tablespoonful of sugar, and a little grated nutmeg. Put a layer of crumbs, then a layer of apple, in the dish, continuing this until the dish is filled within one inch of the top; bake in a moderate oven half-an-hour. Beat up the eggs, add to them the milk (boiling), a little sugar, and a few drops of essence of vanilla. Put the pan containing the custard into a pan of boiling water, and stir until it thickens; pour this on the top of the pudding, and bake very gently 10 or 15 minutes, or until the custard is set. Lift carefully out of the dish, and serve plain, hot or cold; or cream or custard sauce may be served with it.

107 No. 175. PARMESAN CUSTARDS. 4 eggs £ pint milk 2 oz. butter 3 tablespoonfuls of grated Parmesan Salt, pepper, and cayenne Beat up the eggs, add milk (boiling), Parmesan, salt, pepper, and cayenne ; pour into some very small buttered darioles, stirring all the time, so as not to let the cheese settle. Stand the moulds in a saucepan, allowing the water to come within half an inch of the top; simmer very gently until set. Cut some thin slices of bread, and stamp them out in rounds a little larger than the moulds; put the butter into a frying pan, and when quite hot fry the bread a pretty gold. Dish one custard on each, put a little pile of grated cheese on the top of each, and brown under a gas burner or in front of a brisk fire. Serve on lace paper, with parsley or cress garnish. No. 176.

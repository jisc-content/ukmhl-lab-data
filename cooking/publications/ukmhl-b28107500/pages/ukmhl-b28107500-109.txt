101 eggs (well beaten); beat 10 minutes, then add all the above ingredients; pour into a tin lined with oiled paper, and bake in a moderate oven 2J hours. If it is put into a shallow dripping tin, then it will not require so long baking. This may be covered when cold with almond paste (page 102) and when set with white icing (page 103). Then before the icing is set cover with large crystallized sugar; set in a warm place until firm. This cake will improve if kept three weeks before icing. It is always best to ice a cake just before it is required for use. No. 164.

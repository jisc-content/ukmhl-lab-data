To prepare potatoes for frying see they are well dried, then they may be peeled into ribbons or cut into thin slices, put into a frying basket, immersed in smoking hot fat, and fried brown and crisp; if thin, a few minutes will cook them. Drain on soft paper, sprinkle with minced parsley, pepper, and salt, and a pat of butter; serve quickly. If the potatoes are cut in thicker pieces, such as square blocks or quarter shapes, put them into the fat before it is quite smoking, and fry until tender, but not brown; then lift them out, re-heat the fat, and put the potatoes back for about a minute to brown and crisp.

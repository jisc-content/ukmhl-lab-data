Roll out the pastry and line a small pie dish, which must be buttered at the bottom and sides, and the edges wetted to prevent the pastry slipping inside. Ornament the edge with cut leaves, pour in the cocoanut, and bake half an hour, or until set. Whip up the whites of the eggs, with a dust of salt, until quite stiff, then stir in lightly two tablespoonfuls of castor sugar; pile on the pudding, and sprinkle with cocoanut; put in a slow oven until set. Serve hot or cold. No. 112.

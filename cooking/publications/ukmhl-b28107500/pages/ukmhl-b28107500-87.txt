JELLY A LA DUCHESSE. 1 quart water with the lemon juice Rind of 4 lemons ^ lb. lump sugar Whites and shells of 3 eggs 2 inches cinnamon stick Juice of 6 lemons 1^ oz. gelatine 4 cloyes Cut off the yellow rind of the lemon as thick as possible; crush the shells of the eggs, and beat them with the whites and a little water; put all the ingre- dients into a saucepan, stir until it boils ; cover the saucepan, and allow it to stand 10 minutes. Pass through the jelly bag a quart of hot water, then the jelly. Put into a mould one inch of the jelly, and ornament with candied fruits, and allow to set; then take three or four tablespoonfuls of jelly and whip until a white froth, pour into the mould, and when set pour on the top about one inch of the jelly, coloured a pretty red with cochineal; allow this to set, and fill the mould with the natural jelly. When quite firm, dip in warm water, and turn out very quickly, or the colours will run and spoil the jelly. Fine Leaf G-elatine, in lib. boxes, 2s. 6d., by post 2s. 9d., from H. M.

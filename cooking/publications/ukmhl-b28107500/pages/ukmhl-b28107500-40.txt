32 bird; lift out, drain, and remove the skin, set aside to cool; strain the liquid, and when cold remove the fat and use for aspic jelly (No. 89). Fill a border mould with part of the jelly, and when set dip in warm water and turn out. Melt the butter in a saucepan, add the flour, stir until smooth, then add the milk, ^ pt. aspic jelly, salt and pepper, boil this until it is reduced to half the quantity, pass through a fine hair sieve; colour part of this sauce a pretty pink with cochineal, allow this to get cool, but not set; joint the chicken neatly, and dip half of the joints in the cream sauce and the remainder in the pink sauce; put aside until firm, if not well covered dip them in the sauces again. When quite set arrange the pieces in the centre and on the top of the border of aspic. Put a little of the aspic into a forcing bag with a rose tube, and garnish the rough edges of the fowl, and round the base of the dish. A little chopped pars- ley, hard-boiled yolk of egg rubbed through a sieve, and any remains of the cold sauces may be used for garnishing. A base of salad may also be used instead of the border of aspic, if preferred.

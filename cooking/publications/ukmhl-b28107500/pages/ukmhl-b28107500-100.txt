92 No 151. CHILDREN’S TRIFLE. 1 pint milk 4 eggs A few drops cochineal ^ lb. Savoy biscuits or sponge cake A few minced pistachios 2 tablespoonfuls castor sugar 1 teaspoonful vanilla 2 tablespoonfuls of jam Separate the whites from the yolks of the eggs, whip up the whites to a very stiff froth, stir in very lightly a tablespoonful of sugar; put the milk into a saucepan with the vanilla, and a tablespoonful of sugar. When boiling, drop into it the whites formed into egg shape by means of two tablespoons, allow them to cook on one side, then gently turn them over—about H minutes on each side will be sufficient; lift them gently out on to a sieve to drain. When all are poached, beat up the yolks, and add half a pint of the milk in which the whites have been poached ; pour into a custard pan, and stir until the custard thickens; arrange the biscuits at the bottom of a glass dish, add a little jam; continue this until the dish is nearly full; add a few drops of cochineal to the custard, and strain over the biscuits. Arrange the egg balls round the dish and high in the centre; sprinkle with pistachios, or leave white, according to taste. If liked, the biscuits may first be sprinkled with brandy or sherry.

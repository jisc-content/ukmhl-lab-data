94 side of the bowl, skim this off and place it on a hair sieve to drain, continue to whip and skim off the cream as long as the froth rises. Three-quarters of a pint of cream should yield a large quantity of froth. Allow it to stand on the sieve for an hour, and when whipping it be careful to whip from side to sideâ€”not round, or the froth will not rise. Pile this very high on the top of the biscuits, then decorate it with merangues (see below) and candied fruit. It is best to put the cream froth and decorations on just before it is sent to the table. No. 154. MERANGUES. Whites of 3 eggs I 4 lb. of fine castor sugar A few drops of vanilla Add to the whites of the eggs a pinch of salt and vanilla, and whip them until very stiff; then very gently stir in the sugar, put the mixture into a ^forcing bag, and force them into a baking tin (warmed and rubbed over with a little white wax) into egg shapes or small rounds, according to the shape required; place these in a slightly warmed oven for an hour or until firm; care- fully take them from the tin, and take out the soft centre from the under side, and put them back in the oven until quite dry and crisp. When required for use they may be filled with whipped cream, flavoured with vanilla, ratafia, or candied fruits; stick two together, and serve in a pile. * Forcing Tube and Bag, Is. 4d., by post Is. 6d., from H.

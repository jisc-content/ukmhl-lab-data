PREFACE. The rapid sale of my book, “ Domestic Cookery,” and the enquiry, as well as the knowledge that a want exists, for a treatise dealing with choice dishes, has encouraged me to publish this work under the title of “ Choice Cookery.” The book is intended as a practical guide to those ladies desirous of becoming acquainted with the art of cooking in its choicest and most economical form, and as most of the recipes have been given at my public demonstrations, they will be found quite reliable. Although it contains many references to cooking by the aid of gas, yet the use of the Gas Range is not essential to a perfect preparation of the dishes given; but my experience convinces me that it is the most economical, convenient, and preferable method of cooking. See “ Domestic Cookery ” with special reference to cooking by gas. H. M. YOUNG, November 12th, 1888.

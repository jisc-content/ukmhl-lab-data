63 Â£ inch thick, and cut out a sufficient number of leaves to cover the top thickly; make a hole in the centre, form a rose with the paste, and insert it. Bake the pie in a moderate oven for half-an-hour, or until a nice fawn colour; then let it remain in a cool oven 1J hours longer. It will require about two hours to bake it through. Put the bones from the birds into a saucepan with one pint of cold water, a little salt and pepper, and simmer slowly hours; strain the liquid, remove the fat, add half-pint of aspic jelly, and boil until reduced to one-half. Allow this to get cold and firm. When the pie is quite cold remove the mould and the rose at the top; put the gravy from the bones into a forcing bag with a tube and force through the hole all over the top of the pie, so as to fill it, as the meat will shrink; replace the rose, and dish the pie, and garnish it prettily with chopped aspic jelly, cut leaves, minced parsley, lobster coral, and hard-boiled yolk of egg passed through a sieve. The top of the pie maybe painted over with a little cold but liquid jelly, then ornamented with a little jelly put into a forcing bag with a rose pipe. This pie may also be made with veal or pork. No. 104a. BROWN CRUMBS. Put some white crumbs into the oven, and, when a nice gold, put into a pan with a good piece of butter, a dust of salt and pepper ; shake well, then serve.

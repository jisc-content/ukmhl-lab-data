DOMESTIC COOKERY. 50 No. 79.—Breast of Mutton with French Beans. Prepare the breast just as you did for the peas, with the stuffing. Put it in a stewpan with sliced onion, salt, and pepper. Wash and cut the French beans. Put them on top of the mutton with ^ pint of water. When done, rub in a basin one spoonful of flour, one of moist sugar, two of ■vinegar, and browning to colour. Mind that you take off all the fat before you put the sauce in. No. 80.—Rolled Breast of Mutton Roasted. Lay the mutton on the board, take out the bones, beat it flat, make a forced meat as for the balls. Lay it on, squeeze the juice of a lemon over it, roll it up nicely, sew the seam along tight, sew the ends also ; put it down to roast, or if you. have a good oven, bake it, put some fat over it, boil some potatoes, careful they do not break, put them in the tin with the mutton to brown. All these are relishing and economical dinners for those who cannot afford more ex- pensive joints. No. 81.—Breast of Mutton Baked with Rice and Potatoes, Cut the breast of mutton in nice pieces, cut off the fat, take a deep baking dish, slice an onion at the bottom, salt, pepper, a little dried saffron.

DOMESTIC COOKERY. ICI- I knew a lady who insisted upon her daughters heading the table in turns, so that they should learn to carve well and gracefully, it is certainly a great acquisition for a lady when she heads the table to be able to carve well; of course, like everything else, it requires practice ; with attention it is soon learnt. Sirloin of Beef. This is a piece of beef that is tenderer than any other part, and looks better, that is why it is selected for par- ticular occasions. Now, as I told you before, the best part is the under cut, and for those who like it very tender you must turn it on one side and cut a thin slice out of the thick part, with a small piece of fat, and put a spoonful of gravy over. The upper part should be carved like ribs, and, as I said in recipe 116, a sirloin to be good must weigh from 14 to 16 pounds. The cook, before hanging either sirloin or ribs down to roast, should remove all the small bones from the top, by so doing the carver is assisted, and these little bones do for gravy or to put in the stock pot. All these observations should be strictly attended to by those who have large families or keep large establishments, or they will soon find to their cost the numerous expenses that occur from bad carving and bad management. Saddle of Mutton. As I told you before, this is by no means a profitable joint, you can cut very little meat from it, there is so much skin, fat, and bone, and what is left is generally hashed up with tomatoes or vegetables. But still for an occasion you may be compelled to have one. It is a joint that looks very handsome on the table. The method usually adopted in carving this joint is to pass the knife straight down the bone, and cut out long, thin slices, with a little of the fat.

DOMESTIC COOKERY. 3 soup is made according to the recipe it will be found equal to any mock turtle made from calfs head. A little cayenne improves its flavour, must be according to the taste of the parties it is made for. No. 4.—Giblet Soup. Take a set of giblets. Wash and clean them well, skin the feet, chop them and the wings in several pieces, also the neck. Cut the gizzard and heart in several pieces. Have a quart of the dark stock at the side. Having put the giblets in a small saucepan with a pint of water, with a little salt and pepper, an onion chopped fine, a little marjoram, and a pickled walnut, chopped small. Let them stew well, add a few small meat balls. When all this is well cooked, put them into the quart of soup. Mix a spoonful of flour with a spoonful of lemon juice in a small basin, mix it into the soup, stir it well. Serve it up to table very hot. This is a soup much liked. The liquor the giblets were boiled in improve the soup. I have not told you to put any browning, as I think the walnut will colour it sufficiently. If you have not walnuts, then use the browning. Eemember not to make these soups too dark or too thick. No. 5.—Ox Tail Soup. Have a large ox tail nicely chopped, every joint made into 2 pieces. Put it into a saucepan with 1 large carrot, a tooth of garlic, a little salt and pepper, pint and half of water. Let it boil till quite tender. Boil a few small meat balls with. When done take out the carrot, cut it up in pieces the size of dice, put it back into the saucepan with a quart of stock. Let it simmer for an hour. Have in your tureen the juice of a lemon, a dessert spoonful of browning. When you turn it into the tureen stir it well. The quantity will be quite enough for 8 or 10 persons.

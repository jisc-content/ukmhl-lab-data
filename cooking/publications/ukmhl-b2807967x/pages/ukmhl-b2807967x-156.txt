DOMESTIC COOKERY. 140 vegetables, put them in a jar with salt, peppercorns, cloves, allspice, and a few blades of mace. When you have filled the jar, put in as much vinegar as it will take cold, tie it down tight, put it in a dry place ; it will be fit for use in 3 months. No. 412.—Mustard Pickle. If you wish to make mustard pickles, prepare a jar as above, let it stand for 6 weeks, then take ^ lb. of the best mustard, mis it in a basin with ^ lb. of coarse brown sugar and a little cold vinegar, salt, pour off the whole of the jar of pickles that you had prepared. Let them drain through a sieve or colander; put that vinegar in a clean saucepan with a pint more, some ground marjoram and lemon thyme, ^ a little chopped fresh rind of a lemon. Let it boil, then stir in the mixed mustard and sugar with a penny- worth of dried saffron ; let it boil, it will come quite thick. Let it cool, then return the pickles to the jar and pour this mixture over. Let the jar be uncovered till the next day, then tie it up and place it away for 6 weeks. No. 413.—To Pickle Beetroot. It is always well to have some beetroot pickled, it is so often required for garnishing. Parboil 2 or 3 fine beetroots, skin them and let them drain well, slice them, put them in a jar with salt and ground pepper, a few allspice. Boil as much vinegar as you require to cover them, pour it over boiling hot, tie down when cold. No. 414.—To Pickle Lemon. Take some very fresh lemons, cut them in quarters, put them in glass bottles with plenty of salt, 2 or 3 teeth of garlic to each bottle, 3 or 4 cloves. Fill the bottle up with cold vinegar, cork tight; this is a delicious pickle, and a little of the liquor gives a fine flavour to made dishes. The liquor becomes almost like a syrup.

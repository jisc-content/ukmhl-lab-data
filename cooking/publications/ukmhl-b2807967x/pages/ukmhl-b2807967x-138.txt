DOMESTIC COOKERY. 122 make a very fine jelly. You need not put more than the 2 wine-glasses of rum, but you must put the juice of 3 large lemons instead of 1. Now that you have the full particulars how to make the jelly, you will have no difficulty from my directions to understand how to mix them in different colours, or how to ornament them for particular occasions. No. 350.—How to arrange Jellies with Fruit or Blancmange. Have ready the calfs-foot jelly or jelly made from isinglass, rub the mould very slightly with 2 or 3 drops of almond oil, do it with a small piece of clean rag, pour in some of the jelly just to take the pattern at the top of the mould. Set it to get cold; when set, take some fresh strawberries or bunches of currants. Wipe them well, see that they are quite clean; fix the fruit into the jelly lightly, so that they hang gracefully, then pour over another layer of warm jelly enough to cover them, let that set, then you can put in another layer of fruit, not too many. When this is quite set, fill your mould with the jelly, leave it in a cool place till you are ready for it; before you turn it out just loosen it gently all round with a clean cloth, only the top, then wring a cloth out of boiling water quite dry, pass it all over the mould. Turn the mould on a dish, it will easily slip out. No. 351.—To mix Jelly and Blancmange. Have ready a pint of jelly and 1 pint of blancmange, just slightly grease your 2 pint moulds. To make the blancmange pink you must get the pink sugar from the confectioners ; they sell it all ready, and when you make the blancmange you colour it with that: say you wish to mix it pink and white, then colour half of the blancmange and leave the other part white; put in to one mould a portion of the pink, into the other a portion of the white ;

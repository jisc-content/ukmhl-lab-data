DOMESTIC COOKERY. 176 Eggs and Anchovy. Boil some eggs very hard, lay them in cold water before you peel them for 5 minutes, cut each egg in 4 or 5 slices, wash and bone some anchovies, dry them well, spread on the bread some mayonnaise, put on 1 piece of egg with ^ an anchovy to each sandwich, place the 4 pieces of egg on the bread so that when you divide the 4 sandwiches you do not cut the egg, dish them up on a paper expressly for sandwiches, or a napkin. Salad Sandwiches. For these sandwiches you can only use mustard and cress, as lettuces contain too much water; it must be well washed and dried in a cloth. You must prepare first the sauce to put on the bread: you must boil 3 or 4 eggs very hard, take the yolks, pound them well in a mortar, put in a dessert- spoon of made mustard, 3 spoonfuls of Tarragon vinegar, a little white pepper and salt. When this is well mixed in the mortar, rub it through a sieve in a basin, when in the basin rub in it 3 tablespoonfuls of the best oil (if not thick enough you must add more yolk of egg, it must be thick), lay it on the bread, put in some of the salad, with a piece of boiled beetroot to each sandwich, see that the salad does not hang out of the bread. The salad sandwich must be made the last of all, and must be garnished with dry double parsley, and not too many on each dish. A card with the name of the sandwiches should be placed under each dish, and when the table is laid the space must be left where the dishes of sandwiches are to go, and in arranging for a supper see that you have an equal quantity of dishes, no odd one. At tlie request of my Nieces and several young Friends, I have added a recipe for making brideâ€™s cake.

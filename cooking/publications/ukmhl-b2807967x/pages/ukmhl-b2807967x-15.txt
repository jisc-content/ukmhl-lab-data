PliEFACE. XI These saucepans must not be used to cook anything else in. The inside of all these saucepans must be well scrubbed with silver sand after being used. Be sui’e to keep everything in its place, as much time is saved. Be particular in the cloths you use in the kitchen, you must have very coarse cloths to dry fish for fry- ing, and that cloth must not be used for any other pur- pose, and always rinse in cold water as soon as done with. The person who cooks always requires a cloth at her side. There must be separate cloths for the dishes, the tea- things, the glass, and the silver. Be sure as soon as you empty a saucepan to fill it with water until the time for washing them. Do not be sparing of boiling water to wash up, and always put a little soda in the water, as we cannot use soap, neither is it required vdth such a substitute as fuller’s earth. Have a lump put in the oven for a few hours, and keep a jar expressly for it. Put it in as soon as it comes out of the oven ; pour boiling water over it. It becomes as soft as cream. You must use this to scrub your tables and all the boards you use in cooking. Keep a separate brush to scrub your cooking utensils, it removes ail grease spots, and the boards will be beautifully white.

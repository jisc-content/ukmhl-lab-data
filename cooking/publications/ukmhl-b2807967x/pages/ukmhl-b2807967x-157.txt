141 DOMESTIC COOKERY. No. 415—To make Chili Vinegar- Boil a quart of the best vinegar; pour it over 2 dozen ripe chilis if not for immediate use; to every wine bottle of vinegar put in 1 dozen of ripe chilis, cork it down. The older it gets the stronger it will be. No. 416.—To make Tomato Sauce. Take a dozen large ripe tomatoes, slice them, put them in a preserving pan, let them simmer over a slow fire till all the juice is dry, then pulp it through a sieve, add salt and white pepper, fry 2 tablespoonfuls of oil with 2 teeth of garlic. T^Tien the garlic is brown take it out, put in the pulp with a little chili vinegar to flavour, do not make it too hot. Boil it for 10 minutes over a slow fire; when quite cold put it in small bottles, cork tightly and seal them with melted rosin. RELISHES FOR THE BREAKFAST TABLE. > No. 417.-Fried Eggs. Have a small frying-pan, put in a little oil or butter, let it boil; if oil, put a very small piece of bread to fry quite brown before you put in the eggs, break each egg separately in a teacup, be careful not to break the yolk, that spoils the appearance of the Med eggs, then put them into the pan.

To make good puff-paste, either butter or meat, you must be very particular not to handle it too much, and as light as you can ; before beginning it in the summer let the cold water run well over your hands. Sometimes in the summer you have to put it on ice to get it the proper firmness. The pufi-paste well made and well baked, while hot cannot be told from butter pastry. You must use puff-paste for all your pies and tarts, tartlets, and pigeon or giblet pies.

DOMESTIC COOKERY. 27 lemon, on top of that a slice of hard egg, on the egg a little chopped parsley, and on the top cross it with narrow strips of beetroot. This is a very handsome dish, and eats well cold with the jelly over it. 72.—Rissoles. Make a good forcemeat of cold meat, veal or poultry, well seasoned if of veal or poultry, chop with it a little cold smoked beef or sausage you may have in the house. Make- a fine puff paste of the veal fat (according to the receipt for Puff Paste), roll it out very thin. You may make them in balls or small triangular shapes, or long narrow ribbons,^ the edges must be well pressed together and brushed over with yolk of egg to prevent their bursting in the frying. Fry them in good clarified dripping or melted veal fat,, flavour the forced meat with a little lemon juice. 73.—Croquettes. Pound very fine cold poultry or veal, make it into deli- cate forcemeat, the flavour can be varied according to taste» With poultry a few mushrooms chopped will improve it. When you have mixed the forcemeat form it into balls round or the shape of olives, the size of small eggs, beat up two eggs, dip them well into the eggs, then into some fine bread crumbs or pounded vermicelli. Fry them in the same as the Rissoles, a handsome brown colour. These make very pretty dishes, and very economical, as they are made from what was left the day before. 74.—Italian Salad, Cut up the white part of any cold fowl that may be left, grate some cold smoked beef. Boil 4 eggs hard, have a lettuce nicely washed, also some mustard and cress. Take a salad bowl, put little heaps of the cold chicken, the grated smoked beef, the yolks of the eggs chopped, and some of the white, arrange it tastefully, mixed with little portions of the lettuce and mustard and cress, then put round some slices

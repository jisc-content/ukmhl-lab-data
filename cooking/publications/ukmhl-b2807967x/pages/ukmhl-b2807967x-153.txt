PICKLING I HAVE always endeavoured in Pickling to make it as easy as possible. I shall only write out a few useful recipes upon Pickling. No. 401.—Pickled Walnuts. Pickled walnuts is one of the most necessary pickles for use in cookery, therefore be sure to select some fine large ones as soon as they can be had. Prick them all over with a large darning needle, lay them on a fiat dish, sprinkle them well with salt, lay them out in the sun, turn them every day and add more salt; in 5 or 6 days they will become quite black. Then put them in a jar with d oz. of allspice, cloves, some peppercorns, some more salt; fill the jar with cold vinegar, tie it down tight, put it in a dry closet. They will be ready for use in 4 or 5 months, one in a stewed steak or meat pie improves the flavour. No. 402.—Pickled Cucumbers. Select a few green cucumbers when they get cheap, lay them in cold water for 2 or 3 hours to make them crisp, put them on a flat dish with salt for a day, then put them in a jar with a few cloves, allspice, black peppercorns, 2 or 3 blades of mace, plenty of salt, fill the jar up with cold vinegar,

To THE Baroness Lionel de Rothschild. Madame, Stimulated by the encouragement of your kind permission to dedicate this small work on the Art of Cookery to you, I trust the same will have the honour of your approval. I have done my endeavours to render the directions clear and concise, to be easily understood by young persons leaving public schools to enter service, and im- mediately to become moderately good cooks ; or, if this hook is in the hands of their mistresses, to enable them clearly to direct their servants therefrom. The Jewish formula of cooking is certainl}'' not con- fined to the old English of roast, boiled, or grilled, but largely partakes of the more savoury dishes of France, Italy, and Germany. Thus I have the pleasure to submit the produce of my experience in this art to the public, cherishing a hope that I have produced something required, and not altogether unwelcome ; and I earnestly hope that the subject matter, which I have arranged with care and attention, may be studied with profit by those for whom it is intended. Repeating, Madame, my thanks for your kind per- mission to dedicate this to you, I have the honour to remain, Madame, Your very obedient Servant, ESTELLA ATRUTEL.

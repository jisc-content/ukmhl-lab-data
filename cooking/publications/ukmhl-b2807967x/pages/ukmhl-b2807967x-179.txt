A FEW OBSERVATIONS UPON CARVING AND THE MEALS OF THE DAY, WITH BILLS OF FARE AND RECIPES FOR SAME. CAEVING. The art of carving is too nearly allied to the interest of n, family to be neglected. Firstly, by carving the joint properly it eats much better; secondly, where a joint is properly carved, there will remain enough of it to be sent LO table again; on the other hand, a joint badly carved is entirely spoilt. For instance, in the case of roast beef: If you do not like the outside, cut off the first slice very thin and lay it in the dish, then proceed to carve it very even from the thin part up to the top, (do not dig into the centre of the meat,) in this manner the joint will have a good appearance as long as it remains at table, and will retain the gravy. Hold your knife very lightly ; by so doing you will find carving much easier, it is a mistaken idea to press upon the knife. Many families are fond of cold meat, and are often prevented from having it from the joint being badly carved. Cooks are often blamed for the meat eating dry, when it is too frequently the result of bad carving.

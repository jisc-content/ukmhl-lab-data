DOMESTIC COOKERY. 28 of hard eggs. Make a mixture of 2 spoonfuls of the best salad oil, 2 of vinegar, 1 of tarragon vinegar, 2 yolks of eggs raw, some salt, pepper, a little mustard, and a tooth of garlic chopped very fine; this mixture must be all rubbed together like a cream, and not put on till dinner or supper time. This makes a very refreshing entree. You can vary the style of this salad by putting the fowl and meat in the centre, and making walls of the salad round with strips of beetroot and hard eggs. No. 75.—A few Eules for Forced Meats made from cold remnants. Forced meat may be made from any dressed material, such as beef, mutton, veal, poultry, sweetbreads and hash. The chief art is to mince them well, and give them their proper flavour and sauce. For veal, sweetbread or poultry these can be used together or separately. The usual seasoning are mace, nutmeg, white pepper, salt, mush- rooms, tomatoes, marjoram, and lemon thyme, the rind of lemon and sometimes the juice. If wanted to make pasties, you put a small quantity in a very clean small saucepan, with a little clear stock to warm, make a white sauce and throw over it, mixing it well, it must not be at all liquid as would spoil the pastry. Line your little tins, put in some of the mince, cover over with paste, turn the edges neatly, do not mark them, brush them over with the yolk of egg, bake in a quick oven. The seasoning for beef or mutton: salt, pepper, allspice, sweet herbs, and a little ketchup or walnut liquor, thicken with a little flour, make the sauce, fill your tins just the same. 76.—Stewed Mutton, with Turnips and Potatoes.

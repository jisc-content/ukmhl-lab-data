PREFACE. vni cart. Now the water, besides extracting the blood, which prevents many diseases, refreslies tlie meat, and by putting it on the board as described above, the water drains from it. Be sure not to salt it too heavily. The putting of poultry in water is a great improve- ment. It cleanses the inside and makes the flesh much whiter. I visit several Christian families, who have cooks that have lived in our families, and the cooks themselves have told me that they could not cook either meat or poultry without soaking it first. Fish requires an immense deal of washing and cleaning, and the skin well scraped, and then laid on a similar board to the one already described, and salted lightly, it hardens the flesh. Vegetables of all kinds require an immense deal of washing and laying in water, with a handful of salt to destroy any insect that may be in them, and before cooking they require to drain in a sieve or colander. Those who attend to the kitchen department, whether lady or cook, cannot be too par- ticular in all matters connected with the kitchen. A cook should be a pattern of cleanliness in herself and all ntensils requisite for cooking. Good cooking and cleanliness tend much towards the general health. Wives should remember that good cooking will keep their husbands in good temper. It certainly must be very annoying to the husband that, having provided well for his table, he finds his wife does not take the trouble to see it well cooked.

DOMESTIC COOKERY. 8 a fine soup at a very little cost—should it be more soup than you require for your dinner, divide into 2 pans. The whole of these recipes have been made by the writer. No. 17.—A Simple Way of Making Beef Tea. One pound of gravy beef cut in pieces the size of dice put into a pint of water with a very little salt, 2 cloves, 2 all- spice. Let it boil for 1 hour only. Toast a small piece of crust. Let it boil with to colour it. Beef tea without colouring looks insipid to invalids. Strain it tlmough a very clean sieve into a white basin. For weak stomachs made with 1 lb. of veal in the same way. No. 18.—Essence of Beef Tea. Cut up 1 lb. of beef into a mince, put it into a small jug, with only a pinch of salt. Stand the mug in a saucepan with boiling water, let it boil at the side of the fire for several hours. You must tie down the top of the mug for no steam to escape. From the 1 lb. of meat you will only have half a teacup of juice. A teaspoonful of this beef tea is worth a cup of the other. No. 19.—Meat Balls for Soups. Chop very fine ^ lb. chuck steak, a small piece of onion, a little parsley, a little marjoram, a few crumbs of stale bread, a little salt, pepper, nutmeg, a small piece of lemon peel chopped with; beat up an egg, use only half to mix these balls. Mix all the ingredients well, form them into very small balls, sometimes round and sometimes in the shape of small olives. Use them as you require. No. 20.—Egg Balls for Soups. Boil 2 eggs very hard; when done throw them into cold water for 5 minutes; then take the yolks only, rub them' quite smoth with a spoon, have about the same quantity of bread crumbs, a little salt, pepper, and grated nutmeg. Mix them with the half of egg left from the meat balls. Make them very small, as they swell very much.

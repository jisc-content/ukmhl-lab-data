9 DOMESTIC COOKERY. No. 21.—Suet Balls for Soups. Chop 2 oz. of suet very fine, 2 oz. of flour, a little salt, pepper, a little ground ginger, a little chopped parsley, a little lemon thyme, or marjoram. Mix it with a little cold water to a stiff paste. Then divide it into small pieces for the balls, throw them into the boiling soup; they require boiling for half an hour, in consequence of the raw suet. These balls are excellent in vegetable soup, and make a nice change. No. 22.—Bread Balls for Soups. Soak a piece of stale bread the size of half-penny roll, drain the water well from it by wringing it in a small piece of cloth, then put it in a basin with 2 oz. of chopped suet, a little parsley, marjoram, salt, pepper, grated nutmeg. Mix with half an egg, make into balls. These balls must be used as you require them to change the style of your cooking. The more you vary it the more agreeable it is, sameness in cooking is very disagreeable; a little taste and judgment will soon make you perfect. No. 23.—Browning for Soups Is neither meat or butter. When made must be put into a clean bottle and kept well corked, it will last for months. You merely put into a small yellow basin ^ lb. sugar, put it into your oven and let it get almost like hardbake, a deep brown colour. While it is bubbling up pour over it half a pint of boiling water off the fire, let it stand, then stir it well, strain it through a sieve, when quite cold bottle it for use. You should never be without it, it improves the appearance of all dark soup, stews, or any made dish. Now, I think I have written all that is required for your soups, the recipes that follow will be for the different sauces. The foundations for sauces are nearly all made alike. A good sauce is the making of the dish you require it for. It is a thing that I am very particular in, and would wish my young friends to be the same. I will commence with Egg Sauce, that requires great cai’e to prevent its curdling.

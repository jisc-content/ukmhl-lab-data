DOMESTIC COOKERY. 2^ an hour before the meat is done peel and half 3 or 4 potatoes, lay them on top, so that the steam from the stew will cook them, be sure that they do not break when ready for dinner, put the mutton in the dish, turnips and potatoes round, skim off the fat, have ready rubbed in a small basin a spoon- ful of flour with a little cold water, turn it into the stewpan, let it have one boil, put it over the mutton and vegetables. Chop a little green parsley, and throw over the whole, send up very hot with hot plates. This is a nice dish for a family. Do not forget what I told you before, when making these stews, if too much gravy draw it off in a basin, it will make a nice plate of soup, put in colouring to this dish. No. 77.—Breast of Mutton Stewed with Celery. Take a nice breast of mutton, not too fat, put it in a stewpan with salt, pepper, nutmeg, half pint of water. Cut and wash well a large head of celery in good size pieces, put it in with the mutton, and a tooth of garlic chopped fine, let it simmer nicely till tender, skim off all the fat. Rub in a basin a spoonful of flour with the juice of a lemon and a little dried saffron, put it into the gravy, stir it well. 78.—Breast of Mutton with Green Peas. Take a breast of mutton not too fat, lay it on your board. Make a nice dressing of soaked bread, parsley, salt, pepper, marjoram, grated nutmeg, the grated rind of a lemon; mix up with one egg, put it between the bone and flesh, skewer it through with a fine iron skewer, put it in a stewpan with some chopped onion, salt and pepper. When it has sim- mered for an hour, have washed some peas, put them in when done, chop some parsley and mint, put it in a basin with a spoonful of flour mixed with a little cold water, when you put in the peas, put three or four lumps of sugar, stir in the sauce just before you dish it up.

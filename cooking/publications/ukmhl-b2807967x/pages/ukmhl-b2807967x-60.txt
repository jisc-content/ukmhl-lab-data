44 DOMESTIC COOKERY. No. 115.—To Roast Ribs of Beef. A large piece of ribs looks better rolled, and it is nob an extravagant way of cooking them, as the bones and little trimmings make a very nice soup, or can be put into the stock pot. Roll them nicely, and skewer them light, if necessary tie them round with string. Put plenty of salt and pepper, and dredge them over with flour. You cannot roll a pair of ribs to look well.

Dish up in a well-dish, with horseradish round and a good gravy. Always add a little browning to make the gravy look rich. The under cut is the finest part and very tender, should any of it be left it will cut into nice fillets, fried and put into a good sauce. Be sure to take care of the gravy, always strain it.

This operation does not affect the flavour, only the appearance, which is very easily remedied, the porging takes away about 1 lb. or 1| lb. Therefore make a nice stuffing of force meat or veal stuffing, and put it in where the porging was taken from. You can then restore

DOMESTIC COOKERY. 26 No. 70.—Plain Boiled Calfs Head, French Fashion. Boil half a calfs head very carefully in a quart of water seasoned with salt and pepper, a bunch of marjoram, thyme, and parsley, and a large onion whole—be sure to take out the bunch of herbs—flour the head lightly before putting it on to boil, be careful of the brains and tongue. When done serve it on a very hot dish, send up in another small dish an onion chopped very small, and some very fine chopped parsley—the only sauce used with this is plain oil and vinegar. When the head is carved each person is served with a little of the onion and parsley, and then they assist themselves to the oil and vinegar to taste. It is a very nice dish.

Make a few small meat balls, boil them separately. A few egg balls and a few mushrooms. Let it all simmer together; put in a little browning to make it quite a light brown, the liquor must be quite transparent, and will be quite like a syrup—remember that it must be very nicely seasoned—do not forget the juice of half a large lemon well strained, put that in when you stir in the browning, be very particular in the dishing up. Place the half head in the centre of the dish with the cheek up, place the balls and mushrooms alternately; remember the mushrooms must be buttons. Boil two eggs very hard, when cold cut them in slices in a plate, cut some thin slices of lemon, chop a little green parsley, put a slice of

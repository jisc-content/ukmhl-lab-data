125 DOMESTIC CeOKERY. No. 359.—To make Ices. You should have a couple of freezers and a spaddle, 2 small tubs to put the freezers in to work, the rough ice must be broken in small ‘pieces, and you require also common bay salt. You begin by putting the freezer in the tub, then you make a layer of rough ice, then one of bay salt, until you have filled the tub. Youthen put the cream in the freezer, put over the top a sheet of white paper, then place on the lid, the paper keeps it tight. Then commence turning the handle right and left, look at it every five minutes, and scrape down the cream as it freezes with the spaddle until it is done. Then put’ it in glasses or in a dish—on a d’oyley—with 2 freezers; you can arrange your ices in 2 different colours, you should also have a couple of ice moulds, they have a cover top and bottom. I will now tell you how to put the ice in the moulds. Put on the inside of cover a piece of writing paper, shut up one side, then take the ice out of the freezers and press it down tight in layers of different colours. When full, remember it must be pressed down very tight, put over a piece of paper like at the bottom, then the cover; put the mould in one of your tubs in a bed of ice and salt for half-an-hour before you want it. When ready, take off one of the covers and push it out at the other end. You make either cream or water ice in the same manner.

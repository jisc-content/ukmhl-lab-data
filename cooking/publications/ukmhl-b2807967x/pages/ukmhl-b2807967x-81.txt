DOMESTIC COOKERY. 65 nutmeg; let them cook for an hour; rub in a basin a spoonful of flour, 2 eggs, the juice of a large or 2 small lemons, a little dried saffron to colour, rub it quite smooth, then turn it into the saucepan ; dish the fillets up and lay the sauce over them. This is a very pretty dish for dinner or supper, garnish with a little parsley. No. 183.—To Boil Soles. Boiled soles are very delicate. Wash them well and let them lay in salt for ^ an hour before boiling; put them in the fish kettle, just cover them with water, lay them in with the white skin on top: that is the proper side to send them to table : 20 minutes will boil a good sized pair. As soon as the water boils skim it, and when you lift it see that all scum is washed off; they must look beautifully white. Have a dish ready with a fish napkin, slip them off the drainer on to the napkin, garnish round with parsley. Serve with caper or anchovy sauce in the sauce tureen. No. 184 —Boiled Soles are very good with Montpelier Butter, Boil the soles as above, make the Montpelier butter ac- cording to recipe ; mind to rub it well through a sieve. When you use the butter you must not put the fish upon a napkin as above. No-185.—Stewed Soles with Tomatoes. Slice in a stewpan an onion very thin, a tooth of garlic, salt, pepper, and grated nutmeg, 2 spoonfuls of oil or 2 oz. of butter, let it fry for 3 minutes; then lay in the soles— white skin on top—with 4 or 5 red tomatoes sliced on the soles; let it cook for 20 minutes, or i an hour if the soles are large. Then take out the soles very carefully, lay them on the dish you intend serving them up; rub the liquor through a sieve, it will look like a thick tomato sauce; when strained add the juice of a lemon and a little cayenne ; put it back in the saucepan to get hot, then lay it over the soles. 5

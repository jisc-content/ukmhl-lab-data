DOMESTIC COOKERY. 93 pound, turn the milk with the almonds into a very clean saucepan, boil it up, strain it again into a basin for use. You use it just the same as you would milk, the almonds serve for many purposes, if you are making other sweets. I shall speak upon that again. HOT AND COLD PASTRY. It may not be amiss to observe in this place that, notwithstanding the number of articles of Pastry that may be made, you proceed nearly always upon the same principle and the same paste. It rests with the cook to change the arrangements and forms; it will always be found to be a compound of sugar and fat if for a meat dinner, and sugar and butter if for a fish dinner. The different Sweetmeats that serve for garnishing greatly contribute to improve the flavour and appearance. Puff-paste, which is sent up to table in so many forms, can only be made in one way. It may- be more or less thick or thin. The baking of pastry requires particular care and attention. You must make yourself well acquainted with the oven. The best prepared pastry, if not well baked, will be good for nothing. I would recommend strict attention to these remarks. Be particular also that your flour is dry.

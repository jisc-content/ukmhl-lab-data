Put on the pan with some boiling water, and enough salt to season the water, crack each egg separately, into a teacup, slip them into the pan, see that the water covers them, have a round of bread toasted and laid in the dish at the side of the fire ; take out each egg separately and lay it on the toast; each egg should look like a snowball; lay them on the toast, send up with hot plates. No. 419.—Eggs Stirred with Butter. Break as many eggs as you require in a small basin, beat them well with salt and pepper to taste, have in a small saucepan an ounce of butter, warm it well, turn in the eggs, keep stirring them with a fork, dish up on a hot dish, have hot plates ready. No. 420.—Eggs with Butter whole.

150 DOMESTIC COOKERY. No. 448.—Stewed Knuckle of Veal. Can be done with the same alteration. No. 449.—Collared Veal. Collared veal can be done just the same. Make the forced meat without any bread crumbs, and no pickle of any kind. You can put in hard boiled eggs, beetroot, and spinach. No. 450.—Stewed Sheep’s Tongues. As No. 60. Coloured with browning, and thickened with the fine meal. No. 451.—To Stew Calves’ Feet. Cut up 2 feet in pieces, put them in a stewpan with a pint of water, salt, pepper, grated nutmeg, marjoram, a little dried saffron, an onion and a tooth of garlic; let it simmer for 2 or 3 hours till quite tender, add some meat balls 1 hour before it is done. Just before you dish it up add the egg sauce, beat up 2 eggs, strain the juice of a lemon and a little chopped parsley. No. 452.—To Stew Sweetbreads with Button Mushrooms. Have 2 or 3 throat sweetbreads ; before putting them on to stew put them in a saucepan with boiling water for 10 minutes, take them out, shape them nicely, then stew them exactly like the calf s feet, add a few button mushrooms and a few very small meat balls; a couple of sheep’s tongues, cut in pieces after they have been boiled and put in the stew, makes a nice change; add the egg sauce. No. 453.—Meat Balls rolled in Onions. Boil 2 large Spanish onions, lay them on a plate, open them leaf by leaf, make up 1 lb. of chopped meat according

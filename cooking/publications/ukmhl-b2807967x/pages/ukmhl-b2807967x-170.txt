154 DOMESTIC COOKERY. No. 470.—Rissoles and Croquettes. Can be made by putting the rissoles in potato crumbled^ and the croquettes can be dipped in the sieved meal instead of bread crumbs. I have given as many recipes as are necessary. Any one of the ^ recipes can be used with making the necessary alterations, if for white stew, eggs only with the lemon, if for brown stew, the browning and the fine sieved meal. No. 471.-Boiled Fish. For the cooking of fish you must refer to the portion devoted to that cookery, and you will only have to make the same alterations. You can arrange every dish just as nice if you should require them for company. The only difference is the sauces for the boiled fish. You must beat up eggs for a good sauce, you will require 4 yolks of eggs, season it with salt, pepper, grated nutmeg, boil ^ pint of the liquor the fish is cooked in, and the juice of ^ a lemon; have some chopped parsley in the sauce boat. When the sauce has thickened, have ready the white of one egg whipt to a snow, that will give it a creamy flavour. No. 472.—To Fry the Fish during Passover- Wash and clean the fish well, lay it in salt, when you wash it off drain it well, then lay it in a nice dry cloth, beat up the egg in a plate and some of the finest meal you can pound and sieve. Let the oil boil well, put in a piece of the dry biscuit to get brown ; when well fried, take it out and begin to fry your fish. I find that during Passover with this fine meal the fish frys better than at any other time and takes no more oil or eggs. No. 473.—To Stew Halibut’s Head. Slice in a stewpan 3 or 4 onions with 3 tablespoonfuls of oil, let it fry, then put pint of water, salt, pepper, ground

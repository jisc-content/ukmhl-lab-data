When this is all ready lay in the steak, then the giblets, set it on the fire, and when it boils draw it to the side to simmer. Put in the balls when it boils. As soon as it is done rub in a basin, 1 tablespoon- ful of fiour, the juice of a lemon, a little cayenne, and browning to colour. Mix it all well together, have 2 eggs boiled hard, cut in quarters, to put round the dish. Make a good puff paste, line the dish, put in the steak at the bottom, then the giblets, the balls, and the hard egg quarters. Cover the dish with the paste, trim the edges neatly. Roll out a piece of paste, cut it in two strips, divide each strip in two to make four leaves for the top. Make a hole in the centre and form a piece of the dough the shape of a cork, cut the top across twice, put it in the centre of the 4 leaves.

Take 1-lb. of edge-bone steak, it is very full of gravy, cut it in nice pieces larger than for the pie, prepare all the seasoning the same and put it in the stewpan, steak at bottom, giblets on top, with small balls. Cut up a pickled walnut. Take the skin of the neck, tie one end, put in a little forced meat, then a hard boiled egg peeled, then some more meat, then another hard egg, then some more meat, fill it well, tie the other end, put it to stew with the other. When the stew is done take out the neck, cut it in even slices, stir in a basin a spoonful of flour, the juice of half a lemon, and a little of the walnut liquor. Turn it on the stew and mix it well. Mind that it does not look too dark when you dish it up. Put the slices of the neck round, it looks well as a garnish. Mind not to put the gravy over the eggs, it spoils the appearance.

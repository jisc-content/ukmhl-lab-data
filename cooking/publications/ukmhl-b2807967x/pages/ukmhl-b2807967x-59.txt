43. DOMESTIC COOKERY. nice brown, when done loosen it all round with a knife, and slip it on to a dish, garnish with parsley, and send it to table with a lemon for use. This is excellent cold. Cold meats prepared from these recipes will be found much more relishing than hashed up. The meat in general becomes tough. Cooked this manner it will be found much more easy of digestion for children and elderly persons. No. 114. A few remarks upon the roasting of Meat and Poultry. To roast well either meat or poultry you must not make a large fierce fire. The outside gets dried up or burnt, and the inside remains raw. I speak from practical experience. Few cooks roast well, therefore young beginners should pay strict attention to the rules laid down for them, and keep strictly to time in roasting. It is a part of cookery that should never be hurried, but have the necessary time required to do it well, and by so doing you will cook the joints well and save your coals, which is an important matter in the present expensive times. If the weather will allow it you should always have the joint intended for roasting hung up for two days in a dry place. After it is prepared, lay it in a coarse cloth (mind a very clean one) to dry it well. Put the seasoning, that is to say, sprinkle it with salt and pepper, and sprinkle lightly over it a little flour. Then prepare your tire, rake all the small dirt from the bottom bar, so that you give it a draught. Then have some coal and coke broke in small pieces, lay it in close so that for two hours the fire will not require touching. That time will roast a joint of ribs, or a good sized turkey or goose. The not making the fire well up at first causes a great deal of dust to settle on the dripping pan. Hang the joint to the fire so that it warms as the fire burns up. Then when clear you will have no trouble, only to see that it is well basted. That part of the roasting must be well attended to, otherwise the meat will be dry.

DOMESTIC COOKERY. 25 No. 67.—Sausage Eoll. Make a paste of ^ lb. flour, | lb. of chopped suet, a pinch of salt. Mix it with a little cold water, roll it out three times, lb. sausage, boil it and skin it, roll the paste out the size of the sausage, lay it on it and roll it up, and fasten the ends with a little yolk of an egg; brush the roll all over with the egg, bake it in a brisk oven. This is very nice for lunch, or for a side dish cut in rounds and garnished with parsley. No. 68.—Stewed Sweetbreads with Egg Sauce, Take 2 or 3 throat sweetbreads, put them in boiling water to plump them up. Take them out, put them on your paste board, shape them nicely. Cut a piece of the fat of smoked beef in length of two inches, put each piece through the larding needle, and run it through the sweetbread till it looks like a porcupine, place the sweetbreads in your stewpan with an onion sliced, a little marjoram, salt, pepper, grated nutmeg, put in a few small meat balls, a few button mushrooms, boil them first so that they do not make the stew dark. Make an egg sauce as before directed. No. 69.—Stewed Calves’ Feet with Egg Sauce. Cut 2 calfs feet in several pieces, slice an onion in a stewpan, with salt, pepper, grated nutmeg, a little marjoram. Put in the feet with a pint of water, give them a quick boil to skim the liquor, then let them cook slowly for 2 hours. Have some meat balls, not too small. When the feet are very tender, put in the sauce made as directed before, with a little chopped parsley. This dish, if well cooked, is much liked, but it must be well done and the feet very tender. For a large family bullocks’ feet cooked in same way is excellent.

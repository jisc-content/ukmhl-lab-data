This is a very useful and cheap jam for the winter. Made the same. No. 397 —Plum Jam. You must take out the stones, break some of the stones, and put the kernels in the jam. Always pound to pound. No. 398.—Greengage Jam. This is a very delicate preserve, and makes a useful jam for company, and in the season it is not expensive. Made just the same. No. 399—Preserved Cherries. This is a most useful preserve, as you can employ the cherries in so many sweets for occasions. Lay them with the sugar the night before, and drain off the syrup to boil the sugar with before you put in the cherries, as you should endeavour to keep them as whole as you can, put them in pots, cover with the syrup, cover down the same as the others. No. 400.—Cherries in Brandy or Rum. One is as good as the other. Pick some fine Morelia cherries, the larger the better, cut off half the stalk, put them in dry bottles, 1 oz. of sifted sugar in each bottle, fill up with cherries, then fill up with brandy or rum, cork the bottles, and put skin over them tied tightly.

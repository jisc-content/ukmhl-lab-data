COOKERY. Good Stock and Good Sauces are the foundation of Good Cookery. I will, therefore, begin with them. No. 1.â€”Slock for White Soups. Knuckle of veal, a brisket bone, 3-lb. of clod. Put into a very clean stock-pot. 4 quarts of water, pepper, salt, a blade of mace, 1 large onion, a tooth of garlic, 1 leek, 1 carrot, 1 turnip, 2 or 3 sticks of celery. Let it boil up quick, skim it well, then put it at the side to simmer for 3 hours. Eemember that fast boiling spoils everything. After it is well boiled and you find the meat leaves the bones, strain it through a nice clean sieve into one of those pans lined with white, into which put 1 pennyworth of saffron well dried and rubbed smooth. The next day you will find it a perfect jelly, from which you can make any clear white soup, such as vermicelli, macaroni, rice, and white sauces.

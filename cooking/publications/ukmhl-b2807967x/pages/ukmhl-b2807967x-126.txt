110 DOMESTIC COOKERY. No. 315.â€”To make Sister Cake, the Q,ueen of Cakes. 1 lb. of roll dough, 1 lb. fresh butter, 6 eggs, 8 oz. of ground almonds, 1 lb. citron, 1 lb. of orange and lemon peel, 3 lb. of loaf sugar clarified with 3d. of orange-flower water. Put the dough in a very nice pan, put it near the fire to warm, if the dough is cold it will not rise; melt the lb. of butter in a teacup of milk, take a piece of the butter first to rub your dish with, beat up the 6 eggs, put them in the pan with the dough, then put in the ground almonds, then the butter and milk, a small pineh of salt, beat it all well for 1 hour, have ready a nice round yellow dish, butter it well, cut up before you beat it the citron in slices in one plate, then the orange and lemon in another. Now put at; the bottom of your dish a layer of the mixture of dough, butter, almonds, &c., then a layer of citron, then dough, then orange and lemon. Continue making layers till you have used up all your ingredients. Eemember to make your layer very lightly, your oven must be ready for it as soon as it is made, not a fierce oven; it will take an hour to bake, it will rise very much. Put an iron skewer through to see if it is done ; if the skewer comes out clean it is done; have 2 oz. of Jordan almonds bleached, put them on a plate in the oven to dry and get a light brown colour. Put them by till the cake is done, put the 3 lbs. of sugar in a very clean saucepan with a pint of water, let it boil till it comes like a syrup, then throw the orange-flower water in, have the sugar ready when the cake is done, as it must be poured hot when the cake comes out of the oven, it will take it all. Just pass a knife round to let it soak, let the last layer on the cake be citron, put it on in pattern, then ornament it with the almonds and thousands. When it is cold you can turn it in a china or deep glass dish. It is a very superior cake, and is suited for the naming or confirma- tion of a son.

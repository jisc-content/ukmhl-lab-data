4 DOMESTIC COOKERY. No. 6.—Julienne Soup. Cut in thin long strips the length of 2 inches, half a carrot, half a turnip, a leek, 2 sticks of celery, a Jerusalem artichoke, a potato, several French beans, a few green peas, a small piece of lettuce, a little cabbage, in fact, a little of every vegetable you can get, but not much of each. Wash them well, strain through a colander. Put them into a clean saucepan with a pint of water, a little salt, pepper, a little grated nutmeg. Boil a few meat balls with the vege- tables. When quite done put it all into a quart of the stock. Put in a little browning to colour it. I have now shown you how the principal soups are to be made from the stock No. 2. No. 7.—White Soups to be made from Stock No. 1. Warm a quart of stock, and when it boils put in i-lb. of vermicelli, let it boil for 10 minutes. The stock is already coloured with the saffron. A couple of tomatoes cut small and boiled, then put them through a sieve, put it into the tureen before you dish up the soup. Also a little grated nutmeg makes it very agreeable. No. 8. Macaroni is made just in same manner. Italian paste and rice also. Tomatoes taste ivell with all these soups. No. 9.—Cressy Soup. Take 4 or 5 nice fresh-looking large carrots. Cut them in small pieces, put them in a saucepan with a pint of water, a little salt and pepper, let them boil to a pulp, rub them well through a sieve. Have ready a quart of stock No. 1. When hot, put in the liquor the carrots were boiled in and the pulp, let it all boil together if not thick enough. Rub a couple of spoonfuls of flour with a little cold water, stir it in. This soup should be as thick as good cream. A little cayenne pepper improves it. Have ready in the tureen a few very small pieces of toasted bread cut in the shape of dice and a little fine chopped parsley.

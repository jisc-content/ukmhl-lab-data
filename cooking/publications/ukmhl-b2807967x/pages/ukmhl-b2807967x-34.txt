Cut up a carrot in strips of 2 inches long, cut 2 turnips in pieces of an equal size, also an onion with salt and pepper, and a little grated nutmeg. Let it all stew till tender, thicken with a teaspoonful of flour and a little dried saffron. No. 48.—Fried Steak and Potatoes. Put a little fat in a pan. Season the steak with salt and pepper, and sprinkle a little flour over the steak. Fry it a nice brown colour. Have boiled and washed a few potatoes and mashed with the yolk of an egg, turn the potatoes out in the dish you intend sending up the steak. Shape it nicely, and lay the steak upon it. Serve it on a very hot dish. No. 49.—Broiled Steak with Carrots. Boil a carrot, cut it in the shape of dice, put your dish to get hot, take a tooth of garlic rub it over the hot dish to give it a flavour. Then lay the cut carrot, sprinkle over it a little salt and pepper, and pour over it a teaspoonful of salad oil. Take your steak off the gridiron, place it on top, and season it with salt and pepper. Serve it up directly. No. 50.—Steak and Mushrooms. Take some nice mushrooms, peel them, and wash them well, let them drain in a colander. Put on your meat fry- ing-pan, a little dripping, let it boil, put in your steak, sprinkle over it salt and pepper. When nearly done put in the mushrooms to fry. Have a hot dish ready, put your steak in, place the mushrooms round. Strain the fat from the frying-pan, then put in a little salt, pepper, and the juice of a lemon, and a little boiling water; set it over the fire and when it boils turn it over the steak.

You can change any of these arrangements for any others you may prefer from the recipes. SUPPER. Suppers for young people are better arranged on side tables for them to take it standing, for, unless in very large houses, you seldom find room for a sitting supper. I have always found that young ladies prefer these to sitting suppers, more particularly in the present day, when the dresses are so extensive, and take up so much room. Therefore a well arranged supper, consisting of several different kinds of sandwiches, with good jellies, blancmanges, creams, and various kinds of sweets with fruit, is as much as can be required. They are certainly less expensive, and dispense with the fatigue of carving which devolves upon the young gentlemen, who, I am sure, would prefer the enjoy- ment of the ball room. The table should be decorated with raised dishes of fruits and flowers gracefully arranged, with plenty of lights. This will form a very elegant supper, and you will find that suppers thus arranged will be far more agreeable to the company, who can then partake of all the good things without being obliged to seat themselves where ladies cannot rise without the danger of tearing their dresses, which is of far more importance to them than the finest supper.

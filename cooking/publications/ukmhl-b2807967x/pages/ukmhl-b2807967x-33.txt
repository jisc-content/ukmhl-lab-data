DOMESTIC COOKERY. 17 nutmeg; skim it; put a spoonful of flour in a basin with the juice of a lemon, a little browning to colour. Strain it all into a stewpan, and put in the rolled beef as you take it out of the saucepan. Put it in a dish with the balls round, pour the gravy over. Cold, it makes a nice dish for summer eating. No. 44.—Stewed Beef with Chestnuts. Take a nice piece of beef, 2 or 3-lbs., put it into a stew- pan, with salt, pepper, and a little grated nutmeg, ^ pint of water. Let it simmer gently for 2 hours. Boil 1-lb. of chestnuts for ^ an hour. Take them out of the water, peel them whole, ^ an hour before the meat is done put in the chestnuts to finish cooking. Rub a teaspoon ful of flour with the juice of ^ a lemon, and a little dried saffron. Be careful the chestnuts do not break when you put in the thickening. Dish them up nicely by putting them round the meat. This is a dish that is much liked. No. 45.—Steak Stewed with Walnut Liquor. Take a pound of the first cut of chuck steak, which is almost the best steak you can get. Put it in a stewpan with a ^ pint of water, salt, and pepper. Let it stew gently, for 1 hour till the liquor is quite reduced. Chop a small onion very fine to stew with. When quite done rub a pickled walnut quite smooth, stir it in the liquor. When you put the steak in the dish put the liquor over. This with a nice boiled potato, is very good. No. 46.—Steak Stewed with Tomatoes. Cut 3 or 4 good sized tomatoes, put them in a stewpan with an onion (remember always to use Spanish or Lisbon onion, they are much milder), salt, pepper. Put in the steak; as soon as it is tender take out the steak, rub the tomatoes and onion through a sieve. Put back the steak in the saucepan and throw over the sauce. 2

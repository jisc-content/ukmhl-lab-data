No. 107.—Boiled Salt Beef with Carrots and Greens. Take a nice piece of salt beef. You should always salt your own meat and tongues. I shall give you a valuable recipe for so doing. Put it in a deep saucepan with two or three carrots, let it boil quickly, skim it, then let it simmer at the side. Half an hour before dinner have a cabbage or some greens well washed, such as Scotch kale, let them drain well from the water, have a few plain suet dumplings boiled with also, they will only take half-an-hour. This dish will require rather more water, to 3 lbs. of meat put 3 pints of water. Dish up the meat in a good sized dish, put the greens and cabbage round, with two or three spoon- fuls of the liquor. The greens eat so relishing boiled in the salt liquor, the dumplings are sent in as vegetable, but are eaten with the meat. You cannot use this liquor. Half a pound of suet, ^ lb. flour, a pinch of salt, mix up with a little cold water, make them into four dumplings. No. 108.—Boiled Smoked Beef with Broad Beans. Take a nice piece of smoked beef, soak it first for an hour, put it in a saucepan, only half covering it, let it boil and skim it, then let it cook very gently according to its weight. Have ready picked | peck of the beans, put them in with the meat. Dish up the beef, strain the beans into a colander, put them round the beef, save the liquor till the next day for the fat, the liquor is no use, the fat does for frying chops. This dish eats well with roast veal.

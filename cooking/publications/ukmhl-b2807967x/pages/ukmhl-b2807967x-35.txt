19 DOMESTIC COOKERY. No, 51.—Stewed Breast of Veal- Take 2 or 3-lb. of breast of veal, lay it on the chopping board, have ready a stuffing made of soaked bread, marjoram chopped, lemon peel, parsley, pepper, salt, a little grated nutmeg, an ounce of chopped suet. Mix this with one egg. Place it between the flesh and bones, sprinkle flour over the breast, put it in a flat stew pan with ^ pint of water, salt, pepper, a little dried marjoram, and a good-sized onion sliced. Let it stew gently for 2 hours. Then take out the veal, put it on a dish until you have strained the liquor. Then put your meat back into the stewpan, and pour over the strained liquor, let it boil up, have ready in a basin a tablespoonful of flour rubbed smoothly with the juice of a lemon, a little dried safPron, turn this over your stew, baste it backwards and forwards with a spoon. Dish it up. A few button mushrooms or a few Jerusalem artichokes are very nice in this. No. 52.—Stewed Knuckle of Veal. Put a knuckle of veal in a stewpan, with a chopped onion, salt, pepper, a blade of mace, a bunch of marjoram, lemon thyme, and parsley (understand when I say a bunch you must take it out as soon as the meat is cooked). Let this cook for 3 hours. Then make a sauce like the last, and throw over it; have ready in ^another saucepan some rice according to this receipt. No. 53.—Stewed Eice to be eaten with Stewed Veal. Slice in a small saucepan an onion with a tablespoonful of oil, let it fry, then put in a pint of water, a little salt, pepper, and a little dried saffron. Wash a teacupful of rice, slice in 3 or 4 tomatoes. Let it simmer at the side of the Are till it has absorbed all the water and the rice is quite firm and dry. Dish this up round the knuckle of veal. This is a most nourishing disb, and if well cooked is very delicious.

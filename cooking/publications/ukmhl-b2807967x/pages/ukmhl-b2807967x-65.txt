40 DOMESTIC COOKERY. No. 130.—To Boil Tongues, Choose a nice plump tongue, if salted at home it is pre- ferable. Put it on in cold water, if you have a tongue saucepan it will keep the shape better; if not, boil it in a long stock pot, it should lay flat. Let it boil gently for 2-| hours, then it will be tender enough to skin, be careful you do not tear the flesh, return it to the water to finish boiling. To garnish it, if you send it up for company, boil some yery white turnips and some rich coloured carrots, boil them separately and mash them separately, with a little salt and pepper to flavour. Arrange them in alternate colours, with strips of spinach boiled very green. Cut a frill for the root of the tongue to cover it, fasten it on with a plated skewer. Another garnish that is also very pretty: boil some rice white and very dry, make a bed of it in the dish, lay on the tongue, have slices of lemon with slices of hard eggs, lay on chopped parsley, and strips of beetroot. The tongue, when taken out of the water, must be put on one of the chopping boards, and plump it up by pushing from the point to the centre, that must rise higher than the other part; a little glaze on the top makes it look rich. A smoked tongue must be soaked for 2 hours in cold water before you boil it. No. 131.—To fry Cold Tongue, If you have any left cut it in thin slices, and a few slices from the fat part. Have some fat boiling in your pan, dip the slices in bread crumbs seasoned, and then into egg, fry it a light brown. Have some potatoes well mashed, spread them in the dish, place the slices on arranged nicely, gar- nish with parsley. No. 132.—Cold Tongue Omelet, Cut the slices very thin, beat up 3 or 4 eggs with some chopped parsley, marjoram, salt, pepper, grated nutmeg. Put in the frying pan a little oil or fat to grease it, you must not have lOO much in or your omelet will not turn 4

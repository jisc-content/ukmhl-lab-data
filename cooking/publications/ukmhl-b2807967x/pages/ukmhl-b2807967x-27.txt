Take a large Spanish onion or two smaller ones, peel them, lay them in cold water for a of an hour, put them oh to boil with a little salt, when quite tender rub them through a sieve into a basin, take a small basin, put in a teaspoonful of flour, a tablespoonful of the fat from clear broth, it looks like pure butter, rub it with the flour; a little salt and pepper. Take about a of a pint of the liquor the onions were boiled in, put it in a nice clean saucepan with the onions you rubbed through the sieve; when it boils stir in the flour and fat you mixed toge- ther, let it boi-L up and serve it. Some like it thrown over the roasted shoulder, but I think that all sauces should be served separately.

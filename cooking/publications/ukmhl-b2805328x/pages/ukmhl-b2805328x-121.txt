LUNCHEON. 109 no more need be said on the subject. Curries, again, are useful for all kinds of lunches, so are sandwiches and fancy salads, but these are given separately. Sweets, again, are very favourite dishes for luncheon use, the more solid English puddings being especially acceptable, though, naturally, not in quite so plain a form as when served at tbe nursery- dinner'lunch. Omelets also, sweet or savoury, plain ov fourrees, or souffiees, are all approved, and so also are eggs in various ways, whilst, where the cook is to be trusted, dainty vegetable entremets should always have a place on tbe lunch table. Macaroni and rice in various forms, either as ^pilaff, d Vltalienne, aux tomates, &c., are also to be commended, and give a note of novelty to the ordinary lunch table ; recipes for these are given in another chapter. Lastly, a word must be said with regard to the actual table itself, which on festive occasions should be as carefully decorated as ever it is for late dinner. In this matter all sorts of whims and fads may be given a free rein with advantage, and colours which lose more than half their value under artificial light are most effective by daylight.

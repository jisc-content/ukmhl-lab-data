Ill LUNCHEON. and, generally speaking, the shoot, and not the lunch, is the raison d'etre of the outing, and the first point to be considered. Such decorative meals may therefore be left out of the question. Ex- perience has taught me that what a man in the turnips or on the hill likes best is something of this kind: A packet of neatly-cut sandwiches, a good slice each of bread and of cheese, a slice of cake or a biscuit, according to individual taste, and lastly some fruit. Attention must be paid to the following points : hunger will certainly be present, but thirst is, at all risks, to be avoided, for no matter how harmless and simple the beverages, the mere fact of drinking anything interferes with straight shooting. Cold tea a la Busse, for which directions have been given, is the most generally popular non-alcoholic drink, but, if sent, mind a fresh lemon, a sharp knife, and some loaf sugar is included with it. Each sportsman must be a rule unto himself as to the contents of his flask, but always see that in the lunch basket a small phial of spirit (whiskey, brandy, &c.,) is provided in case of accidents, and bear in mind that fortuitous burns and streams are usually fully as dangerous as the pretty little brook that tempted the enchanted fawn in days of old. Lastly there are the school lunches to be provided. In these days of advanced education the strain is so great that the luncheon interval should always be carefully provided for, and this is a point on which too little stress is laid in many schools, girlsâ€™ schools especially. In many lemonade (bottled), milk, and water are, possibly, supplied as liquid refreshment.

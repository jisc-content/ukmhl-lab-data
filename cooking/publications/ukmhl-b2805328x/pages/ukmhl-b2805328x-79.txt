For devilled fowl, pigeon, or game of any kind, divide the remains of any cold cooked bird into neat pieces, score each piece two or three times to the bone, dip in oil or liquefied butter, dust pretty thickly with mustard flour and the devil pepper, and broil over a sharp, clear fire, basting it lightly with a few drops of liquefied butter as you broil it. If preferred, made mustard can be used instead of the butter, putting little pieces of the latter over it at the last; or curry powder may replace the mustard altogether. Devilled Liver.—Wash, dry, and slice thinly some good caK’s liver, brush each slice over with mustard and chutney, sprinkle with the devil pepper, then dip in oil or liquefied butter, broil over a clear fire, and serve in a ring, with a mound of broiled and highly peppered mushrooms in the ^centre, and some crisply fried rolls of bacon round. If mushrooms are unattainable, replace them by tomatoes, peeled, sliced rather thickly, well spread with mustard butter, dusted with the devil pepper, and broiled or baked very quickly. Devilled Ham.—Season some sliced ham rather highly with the devil pepper, and broil over a sharp fire. Have ready some fried croutons dusted pretty thickly with the pepper and either minced chives or parsley, and spread generously with chutney and some “ devil sauce ” made thus : bring to the boil F 2

This is a Highland fisherman’s recipe. Steamed Smoked Haddock,—Skin the fish and lay it in a hot pan, add enough boiling water not quite to cover it, cover down the pan and cook on a hot corner of the stove for ten or fifteen minutes; then di'ain, spread a little butter over it, and serve with a dust of cayenne and a sprinkling of lemon juice, or, if liked, Worcester sauce over it.

Cleanse three good haddocks’ heads (or a cod’s head), wipe them quite dry, and remove the eyes from the outside so as not to make a hole through it.

Brush them over with ^oz. of dissolved dripping, roll them in breadcrumbs, let them stand for a minute or two

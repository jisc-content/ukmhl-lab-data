88 BREAKFAST AND LUNCH DISHES. Game Mould.—Stew any old birds or rabbits with a slice or two of ham, two onions, a blade of mace, and seasoning to taste. When sufficiently cooked to allow the bones to be slipped out of the meat, cut the latter up and keep it hot. Add a table- spoonful of ketchup to the stock and boil it up again sharply. Pack the meat lightly in a basin or mould, with sliced or quartered hard-boiled egg, strips of ham or tongue, &c., and pour the reduced stock all over it and leave it in a cool place till set. Serve plain, garnished with parsley or watercress, or, if jireferred, with chopped aspic, sliced tomatoes, artichoke bottoms, &c., seasoned with oil, vinegar, salt, and pepper. Galantine.—This is looked on by the average cook as quite beyond her ken, and her mistress considers it a dainty not to be dreamt of save for some very special function; yet, as a matter of fact, it is not necessarily either an expensive or a very recondite dish, as the following directions show. Choose a large fowl, bone it carefully, putting the bones and the well-washed giblets aside to make stock ; prepare a forcemeat with one part of bacon to one part of veal, seasoning this rather highly with spice, and mixing with it one pai-t of ham and cooked tongue in equal quantities, cut into dice. Now spread out the fowl, trimming the flesh so as to get the surface level, adding these trimmings to those parts which are thinnest. Now lay the forcemeat on this, adding to it, if liked, some truffles cut in dice, shred almonds and pistachios, and dust it all with seasoning ; then fold up the carcase in a roll, wrap it in a clean cloth.

It should be observed that different kinds of hams require different treatment, and are always better for being cooked in stock with a mixture of soup vegetables, herbs, &c., or else baked or roasted in a casing of water paste. Never forget that ham always requires soaking for a time extending from eight to thirty-six hours, so it is well when purchasing to inquire into the dryness and smoking of the joint.

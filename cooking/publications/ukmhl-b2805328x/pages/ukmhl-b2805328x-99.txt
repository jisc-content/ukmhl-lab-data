Moch Pate de Foie Gras.—Soak some calf’s liver for half an hour to get all the blood out of it, then wipe and dry it well, and proceed to lard it all over regularly with lardons of good fat bacon, jin. broad and jin. thick, till the liver is evenly larded and you have used up the same quantity of fat bacon as you have liver. Now rub the bottom of a good- sized pan over four or five times with a fresh-cut clove of garlic, and (for 31b. of liver) lay in two minced shallots, two bay leaves, a blade of mace, four or five peppercorns, two cloves, a saltspoonful of salt, the same of loaf sugar, five large whole tmffles, and fib. of best fresh butter. Let the larded calf’s liver simmer in all this as gently as possible for three and three-quarter hours, then take it up and place it in a pan or basin, pour the butter over it, and leave it till next day; then take off the butter and dissolve it in a delicately clean saucepan. Now mince and pound the liver to a very smooth paste, adding a teaspoonful of dry salt, a saltspoonful of white pepper, two tablespoonfuls of gravy, and two- thirds of the dissolved butter. Mix this all well together, and then stir in the truffles, either cut into little dice or small slices as you please; press the whole mixture when perfectly blended into a raised pie dish, smooth the top over carefully with a knife, run the rest of the butter over it, and keep the pate in a cool place. N.B.—If you can get two or three real goose livers and treat them in exactly the same way, they make a delicious pate.

CHAPTER III. FISH. Fish is a great stand-bj for breakfast, and can be served in a variety of ways, though the sinijiler and less highly-flavoured methods are generally j^referred, especially for fresh fish ; very constantly, however, the breakfast fish is prepared from the fish left over from the pi'evious day’s dinner. For these rechauffes the following recipes are of general application. Fish a. la Creme.—Flake any nice white fish with two silver forks into neat pieces, dusting them as you do so with white pepper, salt, and a few dro|3S of lemon juice (this can be done overnight, and in any case should be done whilst the fish is hot, as the skin and bones never come away so neatly if the fish is left till cold) ; have ready for each Hb. of flaked fish half a pint of good melted butter, bechamel, or white sauce, flavouring these with a dash of cayenne and lemon juice and some delicately minced chives or parsley ; heat the fish in this, and when thoroughly hot, dish on a hot dish with a garnish of fried croutons spread with maitre d’hotel or anchovy butter. Or: Prepare the fish and sauce as before, put the fish into a well-buttered pie or other fireproof

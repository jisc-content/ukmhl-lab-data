112 BREAKFAST AND LUNCH DISHES. wliilst buns, shortbread, or hard biscuits represent the solid food; these are not bad in their way, but by no means the best things at the time. It would be well if the authorities would personally investigate at intervals the condition of the liquids supplied. We all know the danger of questionable milk and water, and their purity is not to be lightly left to the dis- cretion of either tradesmen or servants. Buns, again, though “filling” (to use a schoolboy phrase), and palatable to most children, are not to be com- mended as a staple daily food, and, indeed, this kind of diet is really at the bottom of most of the dyspepsia from which only too many young people, girls especially, suffer so much nowadays. Let each child have its home-supplied lunch basket, and vary the contents of this as much as possible. Sandwiches, fourres and otherwise, may be the staple food if liked, but perhaps the best is good, solid, and generously buttered bread and butter, with fruit, and a slice of plain loaf or schoolroom cake. Cream cheese sand- wiches are favourites, so are sandwiches thickly buttered and dusted with pure cane (brown) sugar or grated chocolate. Sugar is wholesome if pure and not inordinately consumed, and the craving for sweet things and fruit so universal amongst children points to a natural want of their constitutions. But please remember rich cake, pastry, or a superfluity of bonbons does not come into this category. Plain, light, and appetising food is required, and variety is an important factor in the diet of children, concerning which, however, no more need be said here.

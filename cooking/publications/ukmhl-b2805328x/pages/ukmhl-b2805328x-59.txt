FISH. 47 your Avell-tioiired hands, pressing a clove into the round end to simulate the flower, and a piece of lobster feeler or of parsley stem into the j^ointed end for a stalk. Any odds and ends of fish—raw, cooked, or canned—may be used. This farce may also be moulded, steamed, and served with any nice sauce to taste. Fisk a VOrlie.—Flake any nice firm cold fish (previously freed from skin and bone), fresh or smoked haddock or salmon being particularly good, into rather large flakes ; season with jjepper, salt, and a little lemon juice, dip each j)iece into good and rather thick batter, and fry in plenty of hot fat, drain well, and serve either plain with fried parsley or with tomato sauce. Another version of this dish is known as Mock Whitehait. Lift the flesh free from the bones (use a sole for choice) and cut it into tiny strips about the size of a fairly large whitebait, toss these strips in a floured cloth till nicely and lightly coated, and fry them, a few at a time, in plenty of hot fat in a frying basket till they turn colour; now drain them for a minute over the pan, then turn them out to drain on the kitchen paper in front of the Are. When all have been cooked thus, sprinkle them with salt and coralline pepper (some cooks also use curry powder for this), and serve very hot with a quartered lemon and brown bread and butter. If cooked fish are used they will take but a minute or so to colour in the fat, which should be pretty hot; but if raw fish be preferred, put them into the frying kettle just as the fat begins to smoke, as they will take eight to ten minutes to cook properly.

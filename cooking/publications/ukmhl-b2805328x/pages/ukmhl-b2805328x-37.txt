(Eufs en Cocottes.—Butter six or more small fire- proof china cases or pipkins {cocottes), break a fresh egg into each, season with pepper (white and coralline) and salt, pour a teaspoonful of cream over each egg, stand the cases three parts their depth in boiling water, and set the tin containing them in the oven till poached. This is another dish that may be varied by putting grated ham, tongue, minced mush- room or truffle, &c., in the bottom of the pipkin, the egg on top, and a seasoning to match lightly dusted over the top, with a good spoonful of cream.

In France the egg yolks only are used for poaching.

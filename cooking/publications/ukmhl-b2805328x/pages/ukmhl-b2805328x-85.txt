73 HOT DISHES. aud buttered bread, place the fowl neatly on this, with a pat of butter on the bird, and serve very hot. If preferred this can be cooked in the oven, keeping it well basted, in a buttered dish, but it then misses the full flavour belonging to this dish.

Country Captain.—Trim neatly any remains of cold, cooked poultry or game, dip each little joint in flour, and then fry them till delicately browned in 2oz. of butter, with salt, black, and cayenne or coral- line pepper, and a spoonful of curry powder. When browned add the sieved pulp of two or three tomatoes, half a pint of tomato sauce, and a very little flnely minced parsley, and boil up again. Dish in a pile, with a garnish of fried croutons dusted with coralline pepper and minced parsley, and fried onion rings well drained and seasoned with pej)per and salt. Or: Slice off the meat of a good young fowl, or if preferred cut it into neat joints, sprinkling these all with curry powder; fry an onion sliced into rings in 3oz. or 4oz. of butter till delicately coloured and quite crisp; then take out the onion and keep the rings hot, putting the chicken pieces into the pan and the butter in which the onions were fried, and toss them over the fire till nicely coloured, when you dish them neatly on a very hot plate, garnishing them with the fried onions. Mutton, lamb, or veal, cut up into neat pieces, can be cooked in the same way. Of course a great deal depends on the goodness and flavour of the curry powder used.

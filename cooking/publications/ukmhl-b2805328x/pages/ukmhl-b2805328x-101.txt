COLD DISHES. 89 tying it neatly into shape with broad tape, and lay it in a deep pan, covering it well with the stock from the giblets, &c., and a wineglassful of sherry or marsala, bring it all to the boil, cover it closely, draw it to the side of the stove, and let it simmer gently but steadily for three or four hours (accord- ing to size). When done, lift the galantine into a basin, pour the liquor over it, and let it cool in this for an hour or so, when you remove the cloth, wrapping the galantine in a fresh one, after draining it well, and let it get cold between two plates under a weight. When perfectly cold, wipe off any fat that may stick to it, glaze it with some just liquid glaze, set it on ice till this is firm, and serve garnished with chopped aspic jelly. I have given the recipe in extenso, but it must be remembered that truffles, foie gras, pistachios, &c., though pleasant acces- sories, are not necessaries, and a very praiseworthy dish may be evolved from either an elderly fowl (such as poulterers sell in town cheap as a “ soup fowl ”) or even a breast of veal, which answers excellently if the simmering be of the gentlest and slowest, whilst the forcemeat may be replaced by delicate sausage meat, a small terrine of pate de foie gras truffe, cut into dice, being added for any extra special occasion. The liquid in which the fowl was cooked, if strained, fortified with ^oz. of leaf gelatine to the pint and reduced a third or so by rapid boiling, will act admirably as a glazing and decora- tive substance.

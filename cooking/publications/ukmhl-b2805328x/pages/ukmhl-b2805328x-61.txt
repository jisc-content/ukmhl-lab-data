FISH. 49 juice and milk, or any melted butter left over from the previous night. When very hot and well blended, pour this mixture on to squares of hot buttered toast, dust with coralline pepper and minced parsley, and serve. If preferred, squares of bread, fried till biscuit-crisp in plenty of hot fat, well drained, and dusted with pepper and minced parsley, may be used instead of the buttered toast; or, again, take as many little dinner rolls as you choose (the halfpenny size), cut off the top, scoop out the crumb, and fry the little cases to a pale golden brown and biscuit-crisp, and fill with the fish mince. Or, fry a finely-minced onion in butter, then fry in the same pan a spoonful of curry powder, moisten with a little milk and a little tamarind or tomato pulp, and stew till all is tender; then lay in the fish, dusted with coralline pepper and minced parsley, and when thoroughly hot serve on fried or toasted squares of bread. Lastly, there is Kedgeree, or, more properly, Kitchri. For this, flake or mince ^Ib. of cold fish and stir it in a pan with a full 1-^oz. of butter, two hard boiled eggs cut into tiny dice, with pepper, salt, and cayenne to taste, adding in at the last 3oz. or 4oz. of cooked Patna rice. Stir it all well together over the fire, and serve very hot. If preferred, one egg may be hard, the other soft boiled (eggs left over being capital for this), whilst many people use ^oz. or loz. more butter, frying in this at first a small onion or a shallot sliced in rings ; then stir in the rice, next the fish and its seasoning, then enough turmeric (about half a teaspoonful) to make it all a pale yellow tint, and lastly the eggs, serving it very hot.

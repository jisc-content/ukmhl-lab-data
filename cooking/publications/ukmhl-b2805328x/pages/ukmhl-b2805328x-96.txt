Lastly pour over it enough strong, richly flavoured stock (to which you may add a considerable dash of wine) to cover the head entirely, bring it to the boil, skim carefully, then draw it to the side of the fire and let it cook steadily, but slowly, for four to five hours. As soon as it appears to be cooked lift the pan off the fire, and, after allowing the stock to cool some- what, take out the head on to a large dish, and, if it seems to have shrunk, draw the cloth round it again more closely, but be careful always to preserve the shape; then lay it into a basin, pour its liquor over it, and leave it till the latter has cooled and set into a jelly. Now lift the head out on to a baking dish, and set it in the oven for a few minutes to melt off the greasy jelly that may be adhering to it, wipe it carefully, especially about the ears, and set these in position with tiny skewers. Brush it all over with dark, just liquid glaze, and leave it till set, when it is dished either on a large dish, or a socle, or a stand of boiled rice, and garnished with chopped aspic. In France the boarâ€™s head is carefully tied into shape between thin, wide boards to prevent its spreading, the ears are also cut off and cooked separately, being then fastened on at the last with a little lard forced out through a bag, and used to decorate the head generally; enamel eyes are added, and also tusks, either of the real j)ig or of wax or lard, as you please.

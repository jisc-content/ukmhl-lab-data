In summer a dish of daintily dressed fish, or a nice fish salad ; a dish of cutlets (either mutton, lamb, or veal), with a suitable vegetable garnish, or. one of broiled or braised fillets of beef served with any good sauce, such as bearnaise; a roast chicken with watercress salad, or broiled pigeons or game served with iced tartare sauce; a moscovite or a parfait, as your appliances admit of; with some pretty little savoury, such as anchois a la creme Pomel, &c., will make a dainty lunch enough. In winter soup may be given, generally clear (served in little cups, for choice), with any nice garnish to taste; or in very cold weather, when a drive in the country has preceded the meal, mulligatawny, ox tail, or hare (thick or clear), or a jpotage Victoria, Velours, or a la reine, may be substituted for the consomm^. This might be followed by a casserole of fowl, rabbit or any other of the chicken recipes given among the hot breakfast dishes, a well-made hash of venison or mutton (in a weU-heated hash dish), a salmon or lobster mayonnaise, and an omelette an rlium, finished with Stilton cheese, caviare, foie gras, &c., according to what may be available, and will be found generally acceptable. These are naturally the merest suggestions, and can be amplified to suit any taste or circumstance. Needless to observe that in the country, and in winter especially, the sideboard has a well marked part to play in the menu, as pates of all kinds, pressed or spiced beef, cold roast game, galantine, ooar's head, brawn, <fcc., are all available for lunch. But however you arrange your menu.

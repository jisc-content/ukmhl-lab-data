50 BREAKFAST AND LUNCH DISHES. Fresh fish may be broiled or fried, but for sea or other trout or herring it is best to roll it in oatmeal before frying it; or it may be brushed orer lightly with oiled butter or salad oil, preparing some long straws in the same way, and laying these on the grid and the fish on them. In this way the skin of the fish does not stick and tear at the bars, as often happens with delicate fish, like red mullet, for instance. . Fish Papillotes are a very nice way of cooking raw fish. Oil some square or heart-shaped sheets of white paper and set them near the fire till dry. Have ready as many nice fillets of fish as you have cases, and place one in each piece of paper, with a spoonful of tomato or any other nice, and rather thick, sauce to taste, with a seasoning of salt, pepper, and lemon juice, or with a d’Uxelles mixture; fold the paper over, rolling in the ends securely, and broil or bake in a well-buttered tin till the paper puffs out, and serve at once in the paper. These take from eight to ten minutes to cook. Salmon, sole (lemon sole, or plaice), haddock, mackerel, herring, whiting, or indeed any fish, are excellent served thus. Fish in Cases.—Fillet a sole (or any other fish) and skin it, seasoning the skinned side with white pepper, salt, and a drop or two of lemon juice, then roll each up, fastening it in place with a band of buttered paper ; put these little fillets in a buttered pan, squeeze a little lemon juice over them, cover down the pan, and set it in the oven, or at the side of the stove, for fifteen to eighteen minutes.

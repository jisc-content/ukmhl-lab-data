Sheep’s head is also good this way, but then add the tongue. Tongiie, to Boil.—A plainly-pickled tongue only needs soaking for an hour or so, but if smoked will need several hours. Trim it neatly at the root, wash it well, and put it on in enough cold water to cover it well; bring gently to the boil, skim well, add a few slices of onion and carrot and a good bunch of herbs with a few peppercorns ; draw it aside and allow it to simmer very gently for three or four hours according to size ; then lift it out, skin it carefully, set it out straight on a board, fastening it down at root and tip with fine skewers to keep it in shape, and leave it till cold, when it is taken up, trimmed and glazed, or not, as preferred. A good deal of fat must be trimmed off as a rule, but this is a matter of taste. Some j>eople roll the tongue whilst hot, tying it into shape with a broad tape, and weighting it between two plates till firmly set; or it may be rolled tightly and packed into a round tin which fits it exactly, a little of the extra fat being rolled in the middle to make it the right size. When quite set and cold it is turned out and glazed. Reindeer tongue is excellent on condition that it is properly soaked, a fact cooks seldom grasp, thinking more of its size than of its dryness. Soak it for three to four hours in cold water, then lift it out and let it dry in a cool, airy place ; then again soak and dry it, and repeat this once more, soaking and drying it three times altogether. Then scrape and trim it.

THE DUDLEY RECIPES 130 SALAD rpiHE mixing of salad is an art which it is easy to attain with care. The main point is to incor- porate the several articles required for the salad and to serve it up at table as fresh as possible. The herbs should be morning gathered ‚Äù and they will be much refreshed by lying an hour or two in spring water. Careful picking and washing and drying in a cloth in the kitchen are also very important, and the due pro- portion of each herb requires attention. The sauce may be thus prepared. Boil two eggs for ten or twelve minutes so that the yolks may become quite hard when cold. Rub them through a coarse sieve with a wooden spoon and mix them with a tablespoon of water or cream and then add two tablespoons of fine flask oil or melted butter. Mix and add by degrees a teaspoon of salt and the same quantity of mustard, mix till smooth and then incorporate with the other ingredients about three tablespoons of vinegar. Pour this sauce down the side of the salad bowl but do not stir up the salad till wanted to be served. Garnish the top of the salad with the white of the eggs cut in slices or these may be an'anged in such manner as to be ornamental on the table. Some persons may fancy they are able to prepare a salad without previous instructions, but, like every- thing else, a little knowledge in this case is not thrown away.

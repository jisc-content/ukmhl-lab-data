CHICKEN, GAME AND LIGHT DISHES 75 SOUFFLE OF QUAILS POACH some fat quails for one minute. Make a rich brown sauce with essence of quail bones, truffles, and a little onion. Line a silver bowl or deep dish with chicken forcemeat, place in the quails, then pour in the sauce. Cover all over with a souffle of chicken. Place a band of paper round the souffle dish. Reserve a little of the essence sauce to serve separately in a sauce-boat. GROUSE PIE Take six young grouse and draw them. Cut them in halves and remove the fillets from the bone, reserving the legs. Line a small deep pie dish with slices of streaky baconâ€”then place in the trails and livers of the grouse and some chopped chicken livers, also six chopped hard-boiled eggs, some minced parsley and some pieces of very good mushrooms which have been cooked in butter. Place the legs and fillets of grouse in this, then add some of the chopped liver, &c., then more grouse until your dish is full. Add a little very good gravy with a very small quantity of Harvey sauce and pepper and salt. Cover the top with thin slices of bacon. Make a cover with puff* paste and, with a paste brush, egg over with one beaten egg. Bake for two hours and serve hot or cold.

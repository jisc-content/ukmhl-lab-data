PUDDINGS AND SWEETS R 141 GAUFFRES rpiHREE fresh eggs, a quarter pound of flour, a quarter pound fresh butter dissolved, one glass of milk, one glass of cream. Put the yolks of the eggs in a basin with the flour and mix into a batter. Add the cream, milk, and butter, and the whites of the eggs which have been whipped very stiff. Bake in gauffre- irons, which are sold for the purpose, and serve very hot with whipped cream in a sauce-boat. OMELETTE SOUFFLE Break six eggs, separate the whites from the yolks; put three yolks in a basin with three ounces of sugar and half a grated lemon-peel, stir with a wooden spoon for five minutes. Put the six whites in a whip- ping bowl and whip them until they are very firm. Then mix them lightly with the yolks; this should constitute a very solid paste. Butter a round dish slightly, throw in the whole of the paste at once as lightly as possible, smooth it over with a knife and make an incision about one inch deep with the handle

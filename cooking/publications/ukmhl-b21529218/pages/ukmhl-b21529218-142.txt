THE DUDLEY RECIPES 114 guests. Leave in pickle for about 8 days. The quantity mentioned in this recipe is for a rump of beef of about eight to ten poimds. Naturally you can make half the quantity of pickle for a small piece of beef or more for a larger joint, and the beef should be boiled and served with small suet dumplings and onions, carrots and turnips. Â¥ BRAISED ROLL OF BEEF FLAMANDE Take a piece of sirloin of beef, about ten pounds, well covered with fat. Bone it, leaving the fillet adhering to the upper part; lard it with pieces of larding bacon, cut about a quarter of an inch square and four inches long; then roll the beef up closely, fasten it round with strong string so as to secure its shape. Break up the bones, place them with the trimmings at the bottom of the braising-pan, then place the roll of beef on the bones. Garnish with two carrots, four onions, a clove stuck in each, a faggot of parsley, bay leaf, and thyme. When fried a little, wet with one bottle of sherry, two glasses of brandy, one pint of good stock. Place the cover on the pan, and let all cook gently for about three hours, or until it is tender. When done, remove the beef to its dish, strain off the liquor, removing all fat. Reduce this to one half, add two large tablespoonsful of Espagnol sauce, and serve with vegetables. This dish is equally good cold as hot.

SAVOURIES 183 ANCHOVY TOASTS UT a slice of tin loaf or French roll about two inches in diameter and fry it in good clarified butter or fat. Spread it with anchovy fish nicely rubbed through a sieve, then place a few strips of anchovy fish. Sprinkle a little Parmesan cheese on top and serve hot. Take the fillets of six sardines, put them into the mortar, adding two ounces of the freshest butter. Pound well together, put it into a small basin, add a teaspoonful of anchovy sauce (more or less according to taste) and a little cayenne pepper. If the paste is too hard add a little thick cream and work it with a spoon like a puree. Cut the bread very thin and spread it with the paste. On the top of the sandwich put a very little butter and powder with the yellow of a hard- boiled egg which has been through a hair sieve. The same can be used on squares of toast as an entremet. Blanch half a pound of Jordan almonds, wipe them dry and put two ounces of butter or oil in a frying-pan. When quite hot fry the almonds until brown, but frying them gently. Drain them on a hair sieve and dust them lightly with cayenne. To be served very hot. Â¥ ANCHOVY SANDWICH FRIED ALMONDS

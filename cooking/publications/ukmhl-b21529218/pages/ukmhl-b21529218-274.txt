THE DUDLEY RECIPES 246 TO KEEP EGGS FRESH FOR A MONTH WITHOUT PRESERVING, AND PERFECTLY FIT FOR BOILING TV IP the egg each day in perfectly boiling water and slightly oil. A board is wanted fitted for the pur- pose, with holes to receive one in each. They must be turned every second day. RECIPE FOR PRESERVING EGGS The eggs should be placed direct from the nest into convenient sized jai's, tubs or barrels, and com- pletely immersed in lime water made thus: Mix four quarts of fine slacked lime with one quart of common salt in five gallons of water. Allow this to stand for a day or two, stirring the mixture from time to time until the water has absorbed the lime to saturation. TTien pour off the clear liquid, and to this add one ounce of borsuiic, and this is the pickle. The eggs should not be within two inches of the top of the lime water pickle. If kept a long time add a little more lime from time to time to keep up the strength. If required, eggs can be put in day by day as laid. When taking them out to boil thrust a needle point in one end to prevent cracking. It is essential that the keep- ing place should be cool—the colder the better—short of freezing. In putting in the eggs to preserve be careful to ascertain that none are cracked, or they will spoil the others.

THE DUDLEY RECIPES 116 an hour, then brown in a saute pan with some hot fat, or grill for fifteen minutes and serve very hot. ¥ BLACK PUDDING A Scotch Recipe ONE pint of pigs’ blood, stirred with a little salt until it is quite smooth. Then add some boiled double cream, three-quarters of a pound of fat from the inside of the pig, cut into dice and quite freed from skin : also a quarter of a pound of onions cut into dice and fried in butter without being coloured. Season with pepper, salt, and thyme. Add a little well-boiled rice. Have your skins ready and fill them loosely. Put them into boiling water, prick them well to pre- vent bursting, and let them remain until quite firm. When cold, cut them into long pieces and grill—serve very hot. ^ SCOTCH HAGGIS Boil the heart of a deer and a piece of the liver. When cold, mince it very fine. Grate also a teacupful of the liver and add to this a teacupful of coarse oatmeal and half a pound of deer’s suet finely chopped, one tablespoonful of black pepper, one tablespoonful of salt, and three finely chopped onions. Mix all well together and boil for four hours in a pudding basin, covering the top with paste, the same as for a beefsteak pudding, and serve in the basin very hot.

THE DUDLEY RECIPES 164 appearance like a forni sponge cake batter. This mixture must be put into a prepared souffle dish and placed in a water-tight circular tin box with a well- fitting lid and frozen. Three or four hours should freeze it. ¥ MOUSSE OF STRAWBERRIES OR RASPBERRIES PASS two pounds of the fresh fruit through a silk sieve, add two ounces of castor sugar, half a lemon and one quart of whipped thick cream. Mix lightly and freeze in a souffle bowl. Then make a hollow in the centre and fill in with some of the fruit which has been prepared and tossed in some of the puree. Cover the fruit over with the iced fruit cream and make the top smooth. Do not freeze it again but send it straight to table, otherwise if too much frozen the fruit will become hard. ¥ OATMEAL CREAM ICE Any quantity of whipped cream, flavoured with vanilla and a little sugar. When nearly frozen and just before serving stir in some coarse oatmeal which has been well dried in the oven without becoming brown. Serve enough in a glass dish.

THE DUDLEY RECIPES 106 HOT POT An Excellent Recipe for a Shooting Lunch Take a neck of mutton, cut it into nice thick cutlets and season. Lay the cutlets into a fire- proof dish. Line the dish with slices of potato and finely cut onion. Then lay in the cutlets and the pota- toes and onions in layers until the dish is full. Add then a pint of good gravy, and for the top of the dish slice again potatoes and onions. Take a paste brush and butter over the top. Place in the oven and let it get cooked and well browned before sending it to table. Run off the fat and add a little rich gravy into the hot pot. Â¥ MUTTON PIES Make some half-puff paste and line some cases about the size of a small saucer. Cut some mutton into small dice, add some chopped onion and season highly with pepper and salt, also some chopped mushroom and a little parsley. Use some very good brown essence mixed with a little Harvey sauce. Cook all together. When cold fill your pastry cases and place a cover of the paste over each, fluting round with a knife, and with a paste brush egg over with one beaten egg. Bake a nice brown and serve hot for a shooting or golf lunch.

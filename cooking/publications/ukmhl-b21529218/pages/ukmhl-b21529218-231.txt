BEVERAGES AND SYRUPS 203 TO MAKE COCOA FROM THE NIBS PUT into a stewpan four tablespoons of nibs and an egg-shell. Let this with two pints of water simmer gently for four hours. Then pass through a hair sieve into a basin. Put the nibs back into a stew- pan with a quart more cold water and let it simmer for three hours. Then strain through the sieve as before into the first quantity. Next morning set this to boil gently for two hours before serving. Be careful to put the nibs into cold water and let them simmer, not boil. Boiling quickly even for five minutes makes the colour brown and renders the taste bitter. HOT CHOCOLATE (AUSTRIAN RECIPE) Rasp about a quarter of a pound of chocolate and dissolve with a very little boiling water. Then pour on to this gradually two pints of new milk, work- ing it well with a wooden stick with crossed pieces of wood on bottom. The chocolate must be stirred with this stick worked between the hands incessantly whilst it is boiling to make it into a froth. Serve at once and very hot whilst it is frothy. Some whipped cream should be served with it to put on the tops of the cups of chocolate.

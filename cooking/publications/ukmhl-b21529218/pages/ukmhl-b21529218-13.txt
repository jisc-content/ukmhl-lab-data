PREFACE rriHE Recipes contained in this Volume are simple ones, and I have much diffidence in publish- ing themâ€”but my object has been to give direc- tions as clearly as possible, for the preparation of the dishes, so that any cook can follow them. I have also incorporated a few household recipes which may be found useful. It is hoped that the quotations with which the recipes are interspersed will be interesting. Many of them are from the best writers from a very early period of history and chiefly relate to Hospitality. G. E. D. March 1909 b

CHICKEN, GAME AND LIGHT DISHES in a saucepan of water on the fire. Let it stand till quite tender, then take the meat from the bones and pound it very fine with butter, and season with pepper and salt. The gravy in the pot with the rabbit must be added with the meat afterwards, and there will not be more than will moisten it. This is a capital recipe. MEAT JELLY FOR INVALIDS ONE chicken, one pound of lean veal, one pound of shin of beef cut up. Put into a jar without water. Stand the jar in boiling water in a saucepan on the hob until the juice is all drawn out. Season to taste and leave until it becomes a jelly. This is very strengthening. ASPIC JELLY SOAK for half an hour in water a quarter of a pound of leaf gelatine, strain it. Take one pint of good light stock, one tablespoonful of tarragon vinegar, a little onion, parsley, carrot, tarragon and chervilâ€”the whites of six eggs, whisked in about two tablespoonsful of water. Put this altogether into a stewpan, stir over the fire until it boils, strain through a soup cloth. The aspic should be bright and clear, and not too stiff*. 88

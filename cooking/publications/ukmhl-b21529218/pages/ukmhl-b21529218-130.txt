THE DUDLEY RECIPES 102 CUTLETS A LA DUPPLIN CASTLE HOP a handful of shalots, put them into a stew- pan with a piece of fresh butter, sufficient to fry them without acquiring any colour, pass through a wire sieve. Then take a piece of the shalot and two ounces of fresh melted butter and a good pinch of cayenne pepper. Mix together, dip each cutlet in this, then into bread crumbs. Put them into the gridiron, grill before a brisk fire till they are a nice brown. Dish up with a nice sharp sauce. Bone it and stuff it with the following stuffing, which is made of bread crumbs, suet, chopped parsley, a little thyme, pepper and salt, and one egg. Then roll it, and either braise or roast it. Serve it with a rich brown sauce and some kidneys if liked. HOW TO MAKE A GOOD HARICOT Take a tender neck of mutton, cut it into thick cutlets, trim them, and fry in a little fat on each side.

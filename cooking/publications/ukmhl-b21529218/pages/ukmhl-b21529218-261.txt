HOUSEKEEPERâ€™S AND TOILET RECIPES ORANGE MARMALADE SELECT the largest Seville oranges, as they usually contain the greatest quantity of juice, and take those that have clear skins, as the skins form the largest part of marmalade. Weigh the oranges and weigh also an equal quantity of loaf sugar. Peel the oranges, dividing the peel of each into quarters, and put them into a preserving pan. Cover them well with water and set them on the fire to boil. In the meantime prepare your oranges, divide them into gores, then scrape with a teaspoon all the pulp from the white skin, or instead of peeling the oranges, cut a hole in the orange and scoop out the pulp. Remove care- fully all the pips, of which there are innumerable small ones in the Seville oranges which will escape observation unless they are minutely examined. Have a large basin near you with some cold water in it, to throw the pips and peels into; a pint is suffi- cient for a dozen oranges. Boil these in the water, and having strained off the glutinous matter which comes from them, add it to the other parts. When 2 G 238

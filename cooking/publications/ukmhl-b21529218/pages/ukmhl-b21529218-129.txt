Pass the Bechamel also through a tammy, and mix these two in a saute pan, and let this mixture boil until it is quite thick and firm and than add a leason of two or three yolks of egg. When this is ready, cover the cutlets on both sides with the paste and dip them into two whole eggs beaten up. Then bread crumb them and shape the paste to the cutlets and plunge them for two or three minutes into boiling lard. If the lard is not boiling the paste will fall away. When the cutlets are done to a good colour let them strain on a paper, and serve with fried parsley as garnish in the middle of the dish. This must be served very hot. ¥ COLD LAMB CUTLETS Braise two necks of iamb, press them, and cut into neat cutlets—two cutlets to one bone—coat them with a light demi-glaze, serve with aspic in the centre of the dish, and a cold macedoine of vegetables served separately; also in a sauce-boat the following sauce : White sauce for cold cutlets, two tablespoonsful of mayonnaise sauce, one gill of whipped cream ; flavour well with spring onions and season.

SAUCES 47 SAUCE RAVIGOTTE TO half a pint of mayonnaise add one tablespoon of dry mustard, or better still the same quantity of Moutarde Ravigotte. With this add half an ounce of eschalots or of spring onions, mixed very fine with chervil, tarragon and burnett, and a tablespoon of Chili vinegar. ¥ SAUCE BIGARADE STRIP off in bands, as thin as possible, the rind of a bitter orange, but leaving some of the white pulp. Cut these strips into small shreds, and throw them for a minute or two into scalding water, drain the shreds and put them into a bain marie, with a little glaze and some Espagnole sauce and half of the orange, which must also be stripped of the white pulp. Boil this thoroughly and add a little best butter. ¥ SAUCE AU BEURRE NOIR Melt eight ounces of best butter in a saucepan, at the corner of the fire. When the froth falls, skin the liquid butter carefully and then let it brown slightly to the colour of a filbert nut. Take it off and add a little salt and a very little black pepper, and two teaspoons of vinegar, which has been previously boiled.

FISH The sauce is made from the fish-bones, a little white wine, hashed parsley and lemon-juice. Take a sole and free it from bone and skin. Take your cutlet bat and flatten the fillets. Place the fillets in a dish, season with salt and a little pepper. Pour thin cream over them and let them remain till evening. When about to fry free them with the hand from the cream, and dip them into flour. Then fry them in clean fat, not too hot. They should be of a golden colour. They should be served immediately on a silver grill or drainer, and dished with fried parsley. They spoil if allowed to stand. Small smelts can be fried in cream in the same way and served with a silver skewer run through them. FILLETS OF SOLE MONTE CARLO INE the bottom of a gratin dish with nicely seasoned spinach, then lay on the top of the spinach as many fillets as you require. Make a thin rich Bechamel sauce with plenty of cream. Sprinkle the fish with a lot of grated cheese (Parmesan). Pour the sauce over it and sprinkle another layer of Parmesan cheese. Put three or four tiny bits of butter on the top and bake a nice brown colour. SOLE ROTHSCHILD 28

THE DUDLEY RECIPES 86 MAYONNAISE STUFFING FOR ROLLS Mince the breast of a chicken and a little tongue or ham into fine dice, also some cress or lettuce finely shredded. Take two tablespoonsful of mayon- naise sauce and three or four tablespoonsful of thick whipped cream. Mix them gently together, adding the minced meat and the cress. Take a spoon and fill the rolls, replacing the piece of the crust on the top as a lid. Rolls can also be stuffed with potted meat of game, chicken, &c., or with foie gras instead of the mayonnaise if preferred. RIZ A RIZOT PUT half a pound of Carolina rice in a saucepan with one ounce of butter and a chopped onion. Stir it continually on the fire until it becomes a very light golden brown. Season it with salt and pepper (and, if liked, a small spoonful of puree of tomato). Moisten the rice with half a pint of consomme. Cook in a covered dish in the oven for thirty-five minutes. Just before serving stir the rice lightly with a fork, adding several small pieces of butter to make it moist and brilliant.

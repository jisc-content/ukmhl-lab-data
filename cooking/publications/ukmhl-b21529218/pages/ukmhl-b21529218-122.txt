Hunger is good kitchen meat. ¥ Of all appeals—although I grant the power of pathos and of gold^ Of beauty^ flattery^ threats^ a shilling—no Methods more sure of moments to take hold Of the best feelings of mankind which grow More tender^ as we every day behold^ Than that all softenings overpowering knell— The tocsin of the soid—the dinner bell, Byeon If an earthquake were to engulf England to- morrow, the English would manage to Tneet and dine somewhere among the rubbishy just to celebrate the event. Douglas Jerrold

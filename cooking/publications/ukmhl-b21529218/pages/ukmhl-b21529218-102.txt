THE DUDLEY RECIPES 74 DEVILLED QUAILS Bone the quails as you would for a galantine of chicken; beat them lightly to flatten them, then saute them one side of their skin for two minutes, then turn them and saute them again for one minute. The quails by this means are almost cooked, and in grilling them they finish cooking. To devil them use melted butter with English mustard and Worcester sauce, and serve them with a sauce brune mixed with vinegar, eschalot, Harvey, Worcester. Pass through a muslin and serve separately. QUAIL CUTLETS BORDELAISE Take six large fat quails. Bone them with the exception of the legs. Cut them in half and coat them with quail and foie gras forcemeat well seasoned. Wrap each half in a thin pig’s caul. Dip them in butter and bread crumbs which have been slightly browned. Place them in a hot oven to cook through. Serve them on a fried force meat border on a silver grid.—GRAPE SAUCE to be served with the quail cutlets.

THE DUDLEY RECIPES 238 RECIPE FOR BRANDY CHERRIES CUT the stalks off the best and largest Morelia cherries. Put them into wide-necked preserving bottles, adding two ounces of candy sugar to about one pint of good brandy. Cork securely and tie over with a bladder skin. Peaches may be treated in the same way. T^ROP them into a weak boiling dye until the skin can be wiped off. Make a thin syi*up to cover them. Boil until they are soft to the finger nail. Make a rich syrup and add—after they come from the fire and while hot—the same quantity of good not fiery brandy as there is of syrup. The fruit must be well covered. This can be put into glass jars and tightly covered with bladder, and kept for use as a dessert. ATHER before ripe. Scald in a jar put into boiling water, pare and stone them. Put into a syrup of half their weight of sugar in the proportion of half a pint of water to two pounds of sugar. Scald and then boil until they are clear.

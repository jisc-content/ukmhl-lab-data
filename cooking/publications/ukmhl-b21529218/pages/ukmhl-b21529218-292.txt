FRUITS IN ENGLAND dates^ two hundred and thirty pomegranates^ fifteen citrons and seven oranges. The last item is important^ as Le Grand d" A ussy could not trace the orange in France to an earlier date than 1333 ; here we find it hnown in England in 1290, and it is probable that this was not its first appearance. The marriage of Edward with Eleanor of Castile naturally led to a greater intercourse with Spain^ and consequently to the introductum of other articles of Spanish produce than the leather of Cordova, Olive oil and rice^ which had previously been the principal imports from that fertile country^ through the medium of the merchants of Bayonne and Bordeaux, It is to be regretted that the series of Wardrobe Boohs is incomplete^ as much additional information on this point might have been derived from them. At all events^ it appears certain that Europe is indebted to the Arab conquerors of Spain for the introduction of the orange^ and not to the Portuguese^ who are said to have brought it from China, An English dessert in the thirteenth century must^ it is clear, have been composed chiefiy of dried and preserved fruits, dates, figs, apples, pears, nuts, and the still common dishes of raisins and almonds, J.

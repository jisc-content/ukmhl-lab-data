PUDDINGS AND SWEETS 161 COMPOTE OF BLACK CURRANT Make a good custard, and when it is cold put it in custard glasses. Stew some black currants in a strong syrup and put on the top of the custard in the glasses. Then put on some more custard and pour over the top a thin caramel syrup. ¥ COMPOTE OF PRUNES WITH CREAM PUT half a pound of prunes into a stewpan and a little lemon peel and some sugar. Add water to cover them and stew till soft, then pass through a wire sieve. Add some gelatine—about six sheets. Put into a mould, and serve whipped cream in the centre. ¥ COUPE JAQUE Make a good compote of fruits, flavour with kirsch and maraschino, and let it soak in this for some hours. Then freeze a lemon water very stiff, also a strawberry cream, or any other pink cream ice would do. Serve in custard glasses, a small piece of lemon ice in the bottom, then some fruit drained from the syrup, strawberry ice on top, and garnish with one cheny and chopped almonds. Serve at once.

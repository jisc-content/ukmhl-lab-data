MEAT 97 M A VERY GOOD RECIPE FOR HASHED VENISON Make a water paste, and roll in this a piece of haunch of venison raw with plenty of fat. Roast it in the paste in front of the fire for about two hours according to the size of the meat. When cold, take it out of the paste and cut it into small thin slices with plenty of the fat. Place this in a stewpan with cover. The sauce for the hash is made with two tablespoonsful of red currant jelly, one tumbler of port wine, one tumbler of claret, three bay leaves, six black peppercorns, three cloves, one pint of good brown sauce which has been made of the venison essence (the shoulder or sinewy parts serve for this). First melt the jelly, then add the wine and spices and bay leaves. Let it reduce a little, then pour into it the brown sauce and let all simmer for about ten minutes. Then strain through a tammy or muslin. This is poured over the sliced venison, made very hot, but do not allow it to boil again. Serve in a hot water dish with slices of the venison fat cut very thin and laid on the top. If the haunch has little or no fat, thin slices of white beef fat can be substituted.

Good housewife provides^ ere a sickness do come^ Of sundry good things^ in her house to have some Good aqua composita^'" and vinegar tart^ Rose-water and trecude^ to comjort thine heart; Cold herbs in her garden for agues that burn^ That over strong heat to good temper may turn; White endive and succory^ with spinach enow^ All such with good pot-herbs^ should follow the plough; Get water of fumitory^ liver to cool^ And others the like^ or else lie like a fool; Ccmserves of barbary^ quinces^ and such With siropSj that easeth the sickly so much; Ask Medicus ‚Äù counsel ere medicine ye take And honour that man^for necessitys sake. Though thousands hate physic^ because of the cost^ Yet thousands it helpeth^ that else should be lost; Good broths and good keepings do much now and them Good diet with wisdom^ best comforteth man ; In health to be stirring shall proft thee best. For sickness hate movement; seek quiet and rest. Remember thy soul; let no fancy prevail^ Make ready to God-ward^ let faith never quails The sooner thyself thou submitted to God^ The sooner he ceaseth to scourge with his rod. Thomas Tusser

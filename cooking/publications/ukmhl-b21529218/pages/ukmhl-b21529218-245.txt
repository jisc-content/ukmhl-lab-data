Beat the eggs and sugar together to a smooth cream, add the flour and baking powder sifted, and the orange rind. Mix all well together and bake in a quick oven for a quarter of an hour. When cold ice it with French icing, made of half a pound of icing sugar worked well with the juice of the oranges. When well mixed pour this all over the cake. ¥ GATEAU A LA PORTUGUESE Half a pound of ground sweet almonds, two or three bitter almonds also gi’ound. Place in a basin the rinds of two oranges, finely grated, also the juice of the oranges, three-quarters of a pound of fine castor sugar, the yolks of sixteen fresh eggs. Stir all together until it becomes like a creamy sponge. Whisk the whites of ten eggs very stiff, and dredge the same into the mixture slowly and lightly with six ounces of potato flour.

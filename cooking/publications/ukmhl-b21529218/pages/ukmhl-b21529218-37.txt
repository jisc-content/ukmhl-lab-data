SOUPS 9 When all is tender pass through a tammy and return to the fire. Add one gill of cream and a few shreds of lettuce. Serve with croutons. CRECY SOUP ^|"^AKE six or eight red carrots. Peel them and cut them into small pieces, with a vegetable mire- poix ’’—carrot, onion and leek. Let them all fry in butter in a covered stewpan. Then wet with a veal and chicken stock. Let all cook until it is tender—pass through tammy and return to the fire, adding seasoning and a gill of cream. Serve with croutons. COCK-A-LEEKIE T> OIL from four to six pounds of knuckle of veal well broken, until the liquor is very good. Strain it and add a good-sized fowl with two or three leeks cut in pieces about an inch long. Put in pepper and salt to taste, boil slowly about an hour, then put in as many more leeks and give it three quarters of an hour longer. A somewhat similar soup may be made of good beef stock and leeks cut up and put in without a fowl, though this cannot properly be called Cock-a- Leekie.”

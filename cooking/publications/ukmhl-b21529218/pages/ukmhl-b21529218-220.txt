THE DUDLEY RECIPES 192 EGGS GRATIN 111AKE six new-laid eggs and boil them for seven minutes. Place them in their shells in cold water for a short time, then break off the shells, being very careful not to break the white of the egg. Have ready some croutes the size and shape of the eggs hollowed in the centres, and fried in butter a golden brown. Soak the croutes with white wine; let this dry, and fry the croutes crisp again. Place an egg on each croute, and cover over with a very good cream sauce made with Bechamel sauce, half a gill of cream, and two table- spoonsful of grated Parmesan cheese. Season, sprinkle a little more Parmesan cheese over the eggs, and lay on them some small pieces of butter. Place this under a grill to get very hot and to gratin, but not to harden the eggs. DEVILLED HAM MIX sufficient plain mustard with salt, black pepper, cayenne pepper, a few drops of Wor- cester sauce, water, and one tablespoonful of mayonnaise to make a paste thicker than ordinary mustard when mixed. Have thin slices of fat cooked ham, and spread the above paste thickly on one side, then place on, or in, a gridiron. Grill the paste side firsts then the plain side, and serve very hot. You will find that the paste side colours very quickly on account of the mayonnaise.

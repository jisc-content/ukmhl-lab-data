MEAT 109 say for about two hours. Then if tender, remove it and let it cool. Remove skin and all black part from the sides. Prepare a paste made of water and flour large enough to encase the ham. Sift over the ham some finely powdered sugar, glaze quickly with the salamander, and place the ham in the grate—the under side to be glazed most. Draw the ends of the paste towards each other with the help of a little moisture and so as to seal up the ham. Take a baking sheet and turn the ham over on to the glazed side—the sealed side to be underneath. Take your knife and decorate the paste with scores. Brush over with egg wash and make a little slit on the top to let out the steam. Put the joint in the oven until dry and well coloured. After taking the ham from the oven remove a little of the paste—sufficient to inject a glass of port, sherry or champagne. Put back the paste and make hot. The ham can then be served in the paste or removed entirely iust before serving. FOR A GOOD COLD HAM SOAK a green ham for two days, changing the water twice a day. Put it in a stewpan which is large enough to hold it, adding to the water two handfuls of brown sugar, two carrots, two leeks, and a bunch of herbs. Wrap the ham in a cloth and let it boil slowly for five hours. Take the stewpan off the fire and let the ham get cold in the liquid. When it is cold clean it and pare. Glaze it with sugar and a salamander.

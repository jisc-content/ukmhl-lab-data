CHICKEN, GAME AND LIGHT DISHES 73 five minutes. Strain and put in your sauce after it has been thickened. Cut a large croiistade of sandwich bread, brown it in clarified butter. The duck having been nicely browned and braised will be ready. Put it to keep hot in another stewpan, pour the gravy through a cloth, well skim off all fat, thicken with a little arrow- root (not too thick), boil for half an hour. Dress the duck on to the croustade, with little heaps of orange lemon, olives and raisins round it. Pour some of the sauce over it and serve the rest in a sauce-boat. If any garnish remains serve in a vegetable-dish. COLD DUCK IN ASPIC Take one or two Aylesbury ducks according to the size of the dish required. Make a strong merepoix ” of vegetables, a bouquet of herbs and a little raw ham or lean bacon. Wet this with about a pint of good consomme and a little Madeira. Let this cook for an hour, then put in the ducks and let them braise. Let all become cold. When cold take out the ducks. Make a light aspic of the liquor—adding a little more vegetable (onion, carrot, &c.), herbs, and a little more Madeira to strengthen it. Cut up the ducks and lay the pieces neatly in a terrine, filling it in with the aspic, which should be a light half-congealed jelly. Some foie gras can be laid in the bottom of the terrine if wished. This dish must be served quite cold.

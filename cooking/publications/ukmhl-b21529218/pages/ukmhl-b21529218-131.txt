MEAT 103 small turnips, and small round onions. Cut the vege- tables into neat pieces about one inch in length. When they are lightly browned add to the mutton a little dredge of flour wetted with any light stock you may have at hand. When cooked skim off* the fat and add one tablespoonful of Lea and Perrin’s Worcester Sauce, one tablespoonful of Harvey Sauce. A teaspoonful of flour wetted in the same way as before may be added if the sauce is not quite thick enough. When dishing up lay the cutlets first in the dish, then the vegetables, and sauce over them. MINCED MUTTON, BEEF, VEAL OR LAMB Take some fresh cold meat, free it from fat or sinew, and mince very fine. Take a stewpan with a little butter, one onion chopped very fine, and fry a little. Put the mince into the pan with the onion, wet it with a little light stock. Let it simmer for one hour. When nearly dry add one tablespoonful of Harvey sauce and one of Lea and Perrin’s Worcester sauce, half a teaspoonful of potato flour to make it thick. Let it partially dry, season with pepper and salt. Have ready a border of mashed potatoes nicely browned, place the mince in the centre. Put in the oven with a little good gravy essence run over the top, and when brown serve.

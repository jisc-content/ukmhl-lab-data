CHICKEN, GAME AND LIGHT DISHES K 77 A COLD RAISED GAME PIE fMO make the paste, take one pound of flour, four ounces of butter, a teaspoon ful of salt, one gill and a half of hot water. Place the flour on your slab, make a hollow in the centre. Put the butter, water and salt into a stewpan over the fire until it is heated, but not hotter than your hand could bear. Pour this gradually into the flour, and mix it quickly with your hand, taking care to knead the whole firmly into a compact paste, roll in a napkin and keep it in a warm place until ready for use. With this paste you line your raised pie mould, which has been well greased. Place it on a baking sheet with two thicknesses of foolscap paper round the outside of the mould. When the mould is lined with paste, you next line again with slices of fat bacon cut very thin. At the bottom of the mould place some forcemeat, made with veal and fat bacon in equal proportions, some foie gras, slices of truffles, some fillets of hare (or venison) well seasoned, pheasant, partridge, or any game freed from bone or sinew, repeat the foie gras, then again the forcemeat until the pie is full, putting in a little very good essence, sufficient to moisten the meat. Cover the top with the paste, ornamenting it with fancy leaves cut in the paste with a cutter, leaving a hole in the centre to let out the steam. Wash over with egg and bake for about four hours, steadily, then set on one side to cool. Have ready

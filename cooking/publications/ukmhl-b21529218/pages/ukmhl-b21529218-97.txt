CHICKEN, GAME AND LIGHT DISHES 69 When these are well coloured take them out and into the saucepan put a roux of one large spoon of flour and half a pint of consomme and a glass of French white wine. Mix well and place back the fowls and vegetables and leave them to simmer for fifteen minutes. They are best served in a deep earthenware fireproof dish. ¥ PATTIES A LA HEINE Make some half-puff paste and line some little cases with it. Fill them with some minced chicken, which has been prepared the day before in some very good white sauce well seasoned, and mixed with a little finely minced tongue. When the paste is cold, fill your tins with the mince and place a paste cover over each. Press the edges well all round and make a small fluting with a knife. Wash them over in egg wash and bake a nice light brown. Serve hot as an entree or cold in a travelling luncheon basket. ¥ FRIED QUENELLES Take some chicken forcemeat and make some quenelles. Poach them in the usual way. When cold dip them in butter and well-beaten egg. Roll them in bread crumbs and fry in clear butter a light brown, and serve hot with garnishing of fried parsley.

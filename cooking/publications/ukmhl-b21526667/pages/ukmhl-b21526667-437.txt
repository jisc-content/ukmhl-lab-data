Even with few cows, cheeses of value may be made from a tolerable pasture, by taking the whole of two meals of milk, and proportioning the thickness of the vat to the quantity, rather than having a wide and flat one, as the former will be most mellow. The addition of a pound of fresh-made butter, of a good quality, will cause the cheese made on poor land to be of a very different quality from that usually produced by it. A few cheeses thus made, when the weather is not extremely hot, and when the cows are in full feed, will be very advantageous for the use of the parlour. Cheese for common family use will be very well pro- duced by two meals of skim, and one of new milk ; or in good land, by skim-milk only. Butter likewise should be made, and potted down for winter use, but not to interfere with the cheese as above, which will not take much time. TO PREPARE RENNET, TO TURN THE 1IILK. •Take out the stomach of a calf as soon as killed, and scour it inside and out with salt, after it is cleared of the curd always found in it. Let it drain a few hours ; then sew it up with two good handsful of salt in it, or stretch it on a stick well salted; or keep it in the salt wet, and soak a bit, which will do over and over by fresh water. Another way.—Clean the maw as above ; next day take two quarts of fresh spring-water, and put into it a handful of hawthorn-tops, a handful of sweet briar, a handful of rose-leaves, a stick of cinnamon, forty cloves, four blades of mace, a sprig of knotted mar- joram, and two large spoonsful of salt. Let them boil gently to three pints of water ; strain it off; and when only milk-warm, pour it on the veil (that is, the maw). Slice a lemon intuit; let it stand two days; strain it again, and bottle it for use. It will keep good at least twelve months, and has a very fine fla- vour.

1 13 PORK. hams as long as they will bear, before you put them into the pickle 3 and sprinkle them with coarse sugar in a pan, from which they must drain. Rub the hams, &c., well with the pickle, and pack them in close; putting as much as the pan will hold, so that the pickle may cover them. The pickle is not to be boiled first. A small ham may lie fourteen days, a large one three weeks 3 a tongue twelve days, and beef in pro- portion to its size. They will eat well out of the pickle without drying. When they are to be dried, let each piece be drained over the pan : and when it will drop no longer, take a clean sponge and dry it thoroughly. Six or eight hours will smoke them, and there should be only a little saw-dust and wet straw burnt to do this 5 but if put into a bakerâ€™s chimney, sew them in coarse cloth, and hang them a week. TO DRESS HAMS. If long hung, put the ham into water a night 5 and let it lie either in a hole dug in the earth, or on damp stones sprinkled with water, two or three days, to mellow 5 covering it with a heavy tub, to keep vermin from it. Wash well, and put it into a boiler with plenty of water 5 let it simmer four, five, or six hours, according to the size. When done enough, if before the time of serving, cover it with a clean cloth doubled, and keep the dish hot over boiling water. Take off the skin, and strew raspings over the ham. Garnish with carrot. Preserve the skin as whole as possible, to keep over the ham when cold, which will prevent its drying. EXCELLENT BACON. Divide the hog, and take the chine out: it is common to remove the spare-ribs, but the bacon will be pre- served better from being rusty if they are left in. Salt the bacon six days, then drain it from that first pickle : mix as much salt as you judge proper with eight ounces of bay-salt, three ounces of saltpetre, and a pound of coarse sugar, to each hog; but first cut off the hams. l 3

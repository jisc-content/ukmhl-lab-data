DOMESTIC COOKERY. -266 TO BOIL CAULIFLOWERS. Choose those that are close and white, cut off the green leaves, and look carefully that there are no caterpillars about the stalk. Soak an hour in cold water, then boil them in inilk and water, and take care to skim the sauce-pan, that not the least foulness may fall on the flower. It must be served very white, and rather crimp. CAULIFLOWER IN WHITE SAUCE. Half boil it, then cut it into handsome pieces, and lay them in the stew-pan with a little broth, a bit of mace, a little salt, and a dust of white pepper; sim- mer half an hour, then put a little cream, butter, and flour; shake and simmer a few minutes, and serve. TO DRESS CAULIFLOWER AND PARMESAN. Boil a cauliflower, drain it on a sieve, and cut the stalk so that the flower will stand upright about two inches above the dish. Put it into a stew-pan with a little white sauce, let it stew till done enough, which will be but a few minutes; then dish it with the sauce round, and put Parmesan grated over it. Brown it with a salamander. TO DRESS BROCOLI. Cut the heads with short stalks, and pare the tough skin off them. Tie the small shoots into bunches, and boil them a shorter time than the heads. Some salt must be put into the water. Serve with or with- out toast.

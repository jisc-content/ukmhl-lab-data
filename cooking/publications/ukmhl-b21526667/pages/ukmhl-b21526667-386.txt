33ft DOMESTIC COOKERY. TO PRESERVE STRAWBERRIES IN' WINK. Put a quantity of the finest large strawberries into a gooseberry-bottle, and strew in three large spoons of fine sugar; fill up with Madeira wine, or fine sherry. TO PRESERVE STRAWBERRIES THE RICHEST WAY. On a dry day, gather the finest scarlet strawberries, with their stalks on, before they be too ripe. Lay them separately on a China dish, beat and sift twice their weight of double-refined sugar, and strew it over them. Then take a few ripe scarlet strawberries, crush them, and put them into ajar, with their weight of double-refined sugar beat small. Cover them close, and let them stand in a kettle of boiling water till they be soft, and the syrup be come out of them. Then strain them through a muslin rag into a tossing- pan, boil and skim it well, and when it be cold, put in your whole strawberries, and set them over the fire till they be milk warm. Then take them off, and let them stand till they be quite cold. Then set them on again, and make them a little hotter, and do so several times till they look clear ; but do not let them boil, as that will bring off their stalks. When the strawberries be cold, put them into jelly-glasses, with the stalks downwards, and fill up your glasses with the syrup. Put over them papers dipped in brandy, and tie them down close. STRAWBERRY JAM. Gather fine scarlet strawberries, just ripe, bruise, and put them into a preserving pan, with about a fifth part of red currant juice ; strew over nearly their weight of sifted lump sugar, and boil quickly fifteen minutes.

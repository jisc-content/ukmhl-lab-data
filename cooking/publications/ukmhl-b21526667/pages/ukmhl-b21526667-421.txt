HOME-BRKWEUY. 3/3 for ale ; for either pour the whole quantity of water hot, but not boiling, on at once, and let it infuse three hours close covered; mash it in the first half hour, and let it stand the remainder of the time. Run it on the hops previously infused in water ; for strong beer three quarters of a pound to a bushel; if for ale, half a pound. Boil them with the wort two hours from the time it begins to boil.

Let it stand twelve months in casks, and twelve in bottles before it be drank. It will keep fine eight or ten years. It should be brewed the beginning of March. Great care must be taken that the bottles are per- fectly prepared, and that the corks are of the best sort.

SWRKT DISHES. 303 mix with a tea-cupful of water, in which a bit of beet- root has been boiled, and run it through the bag when all the rest is run out 3 and this is to garnish the other jelly, being cooled on a plate ; but this is a matter of choice. This jelly has a very fine high colour and flavour. ORANGE JELLY. Grate the rind of two Seville and two China oranges and two lemons ; squeeze the juice of three of each and strain, and add the juice of a quarter of a pound of lump sugar and a quarter of a pint of water, and boil till it almost candies. Have ready a quart of isinglass jelly made with two ounces; put to it the syrup, and boil it once up; strain off the jelly, and let it stand to settle as above, before it is put into the mould. FRUIT IN JELLY. Put half a pint of clear calfâ€™s feet jelly into a basin, and when it be set and stiff, lay in three fine ripe peaches, and a bunch of grapes with the stalk upwards. Put over them a few vine leaves, and fill up your bowl with jelly. Let it stand till the next day, and then set your bason to the brim in hot water. As soon as it gives way from the bason, lay your dish over it, and turn your jelly carefully upon it. HARTSHORN JELLY. Simmer eight ounces of hartshorn shavings with two quarts of water to one ; strain it, and boil it with the rinds of four China oranges and two lemons pared thin ; when cold, add the juice of both, half a pound of sugar, and the whites of six eggs beaten to a froth : let the jelly have three or four boils without stirring, and strain it through a jelly bag. 2 v 2

PRESERVES. S3 it and strewed among them ; simmer till they begin to shrivel ; then strain them from the juice j lay them on a hot hearth, or in an oven, when either is cool enough to dry without baking them. The same syrup will do another six pounds of fruit. TO UKY CHERRIES THE BEST WAY. To every five pounds of cherries stoned, weigh one of sugar double-refined. Put the fruit into the pre- serving-pan with very little water; make both scald- ing hot; take the fruit immediately out and dry them ; put them into the pan again, strewing the sugar between each layer of cherries ; let it stand to melt; then set the pan on the fire, and make it scalding hot as before ; take it off, and repeat this thrice with the sugar. Drain them from the syrup; and lay them singly to dry on dishes, in the sun or on a stove. When dry, put them into a sieve, dip it into a pan of cold water, and draw it instantly out again, and pour them on a fine soft cloth ; dry them, and set them once more in the hot sun, or on a stove. Keep them in a box, with layers of white paper, in a dry place. This way is the best to give plumpness to the fruit, as well as colour and flavour. TO DRY CHERRIES WITHOUT 6UCAR. Stone, and set them over the fire in the preserving- pan ; let them simmer in their own liquor, and shake them in the pan. Put them by in China common dishes ; next day give them another scald, and put them, w'hen cold, on sieves to dry, in an oven of attempered heat as above. Twice heating, an hour each time, will do them. Put them in a box, with a paper between each layer.

Roll out a piece of tart paste two inches thick, and stamp a piece the size of the bottom of the dish, which is intended to be sent to table; then stamp another piece of puff paste, the same size and thick- ness, wash the first with egg, put the other upon it, and mark the centre with a cutter two sizes smal- ler, egg the top with yolks and bake it. When done take the centre part out to the mark, and fill it with fricassee of chicken, or fillets, soles, or lob- sters, &c. VEGETABLE PIE. Scald and blanch some broad beans ; cut young carrots, turnips, artichoke-bottoms, mushrooms, peas, onions, lettuce, parsley, celery, or any of them you have; make the whole into a nice stew, with some good veal-gravy. Bake a crust over a dish, with a little lining round the edge, and a cup turned up to keep it from sinking. When baked, open the lid, and pour in the stew. PARSLEY PIE. Lay a fowl, or a few bones of the scrag of veal, seasoned, into a dish ; scald a colander-full of picked parsley in milk ; season it j and add it to the fowl or meat, with a tea-cupful of any sort of good broth, or weak gravy. When it is baked, pour it into a quarter of a pint of cream scalded, with the size of a walnut of butter, and a bit of flour. Shake it round, to mix with the gravy already in.

FORCEMEAT. 197 s 3 selection from the following list, observing that of the most pungent articles, least must be used. No one flavour should predominate very much; yet, if several dishes be served the same day, there should be a marked variety in the taste of the forcemeat, as well as of the gravies. It should be consistent enough to cut with a knife, but not dry and heavy. FORCEMEAT INGREDIENTS. Cold fowl or veal. Scraped ham. Fat bacon. Beef-suet. Crumbs of bread. Parsley. White pepper. Salt. Nutmeg. Yolk and white of eggs well beaten, to bind the mixture. Oysters. Anchovy. Taragon. Savoury. Pennyroyal. Knotted marjoram. Thyme. Basil. Yolks of hard eggs. Cayenne. Garlic. Shalot. Chives. Jamaica pepper, in fine powder, or two or three cloves. The first column contains the articles of which the forcemeat may be made, without any striking flavour ; and to those may be added some of the different in- gredients of the second column, to vary the taste. FORCEMEAT, TO FORCE FOWLS OR MEAT. Shred a little ham, or gammon, some cold veal, or fowl, some beef-suet; a small quantity of onion, some parsley, very little lemon-peel, salt, nutmeg, or pounded mace, and either white pepper or Cayenne, and bread crumbs. Pound it in a mortar, and bind it with one or two eggs beaten and strained. For forcemeat patties, the mixture as above.

PUDDINGS. 219 Lettuces, white mustard leaves, or spinach may lie added to the parsley, and scalded before put in. TURNIP PIE. Season mutton-chops with salt and pepper, reserving the ends of the neck-bones to lay over the turnips, which must be cut into small dice, and put on the steaks. Put two or three good spoonsful of milk in. You may add sliced onion. Cover with a crust. POTATOE PIE. Skin some potatoes, and cut them into slices; sea- son them ; and also some mutton, beef, pork, or veal. Put layers of them and of the meat. AN HERB PIE. Pick two handsful of parsley from the stems, half the quantity of spinach, two lettuces, some mustard and cresses, a few leaves of burage, and white beet- leaves ; wash, and boil them a little ; then drain, and press out the water; cut them small; mix, and lay them in a dish, sprinkled with some salt. Mix a batter of flour, two eggs well beaten, a pint of cream, and half a pint of milk, and pour it on the herbs, cover with a good crust and bake. PUDDINGS, &c. OBSERVATIONS ON WAKING PUDDINGS AND PANCAKES. The outside of a boiled pudding often tastes dis- agreeably ; which arises from the cloth not being nicely washed, anil kept in a dry place. It should be dipped in boiling water, squeezed dry, and floured when to be used. u 2

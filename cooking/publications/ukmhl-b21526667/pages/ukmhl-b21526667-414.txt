DOMESTIC COOKERY. 366 ferment near the fire, without being covered. There will be a thin liquor on the top, which must be poured off; shake the remainder, and cork it up for use. Take always four spoonsful of the old ferment the next quantity, keeping it always in succession. A half-peck loaf will require about a gill. Another way.â€”Boil a pound of potatoes to a mash; when half cold, add a cupful of yeast, and mix it well. It will be ready for use in two or three hours, and keeps well. Use double the quantity of this to what you do of beer-yeast. To take off the bitter of yeast, put bran into a sieve, and pour it through, having first mixed a little warm water with it. TO MAKE BREAD. Let flour be kept four or five weeks before it is begun to bake with. Put half a bushel of good flour into a trough, or kneading-tub; mix with it between four and five quarts of warm water, and a pint and a half of good yeast j put it into the Hour, and stir it well with your hands till it becomes tough. Let it rise about an hour and twenty minutes, or less if it rises fast j then, before it falls, add four more quarts of warm water, and half a pound of salt3 work it well, and cover it with a cloth. Put the lire then into the oven ; and, by the time it is warm enough, the dough will be ready. Make the loaves about five pounds each ; sweep out the oven very clean and quick, and put in the bread ; shut it up close, and two hours and a half will bake it. In summer the water should be milk-warm, in winter a little more, and in frosty weather, as hot as you can well bear your hand in, but not scalding, or the whole will be spoiled. If baked in tins, the crust will be very nice. The oven should be round, not long; the roof from twenty to twenty-four inches high, the mouth small, and the doorof iron, to shut close. This construction will save fireing and time, and bake better than lorn-- and high roofed ovens.

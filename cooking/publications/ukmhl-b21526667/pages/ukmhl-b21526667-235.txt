187 SAUCES. TOMATA SAUCE, FOR HOT OR COLD MEATS. Put tomatas, when perfectly ripe, into an earthen jar; and set it in an oven, when the bread is drawn, till they are quite soft; then separate the skins from the pulp; and mix this with capsicum-vinegar, and a few cloves of garlic pounded, which must both be proportioned to the quantity of fruit. Add powdered ginger and salt to your taste. Some white-wine vine- gar and Cayenne may be used instead of capsicum- vinegar. Keep the mixture in small wide-mouthed bottles, well corked, and in a dry cool place. SAUCE FOR DEVILS. Thicken some good gravy (made of either fish or meat stock), with browned Hour, till it becomes a batter, add a dessert-spoonful of walnut ketchup, a tea-spoonful of essence of anchovies, the same of made mustard, 1*2 capers and a bit of eschalot, all finely minced, a tea-spoonful of grated lemon-peel, and a little Cayenne. Simmer for a minute, pour a little of it over the broil, and serve the rest in a tureen. APPLE SAUCE, FOR GOOSE AND ROAST PORK. Pare, core, and slice, some apples; and put them in a stone jar, into a sauce-pan of water, or on a hot hearth. If on a hearth, let a spoonful or two of water be put in to hinder them from burning. When they are done, bruise them to a mash, and put to them a bit of butter the size of a walnut, and a little brown sugar. Serve it in a sauce tureen. THE OLD CURHANT SAUCE FOR VENISON. Boil an ounce of dried currants in half a pint of water, a few minutes ; then add a small tea-cupful of bread-crumbs, six cloves, a glass of port wine, and a bit of butter. Stir it till the whole is smooth.

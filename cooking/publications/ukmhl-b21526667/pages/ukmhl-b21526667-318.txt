2/0 DOMESTIC COOKERY. LOBSTETR SALAD. Make a salad, and put some of the red part of tlic lobster to it, cut. This forms a pretty contrast to the white and green of the vegetables. Do not put much oil, as shell-fish absorb the sharpness of the vinegar. Serve in a dish, not a bowl. TO BOIL POTATOES. Set them on a fire, without paring them, in cold water; let them half boil, then throw some salt in, and a pint of cold water, and let them boil again till almost done. Pour off the water, and put a clean cloth over them, and then the sauce-pan cover, and set them by the fire to steam till ready. Many persons prefer steamers. Potatoes look best when the skin is peeled, not cut. Do new potatoes the same, but be careful they are taken off in time, or they will be watery. Before dressing, rub off the skin with a cloth and salt, and then wash. TO BROIL POTATOES. Parboil, then slice and broil them. Or parboil, and then set them whole on the gridiron over a very slow fire, and when thoroughly done send them up with their skins on. This last way is practised in many Irish families. TO ROAST POTATOES. Half-boil, take off the thin peel, and roast them of a beautiful brown.

Pour over an unboiled custard of milk, two or three eggs, a few pimentos, and a very little ratafia, two hours at least before it is to be baked; and lade it over to soak the bread. A paste round the edge makes all puddings look better, but is not necessary. ORANGE PUDDING. Grate the rind of a Seville orange ; put to it six ounces of fresh butter, six or eight ounces of lump sugar pounded : beat them all in a marble inortar, and add as you do it the whole of eight eggs well beaten and strained ; scrape a raw apple, and mix with the rest; put a paste at the bottom and sides of the dish, and over the orange mixture put cross bars of paste. Half an hour will bake it. Another.—Mix of orange paste two full spoons, with six eggs, four of sugar, four ounces of butter warm, and put into a shallow dish with a paste lining. Bake twenty minutes. Another.—Rather more than two table-spoonsful of the orange paste, mixed with six eggs, four ounces of sugar, and four ounces of butter, melted, will make a good sized pudding, with a paste at the bottom of the dish. Bake twenty minutes. AN EXCELLENT LEMON PUDDING. Beat the yolks of four eggs ; add four ounces of white sugar, the rind of a lemon being rubbed with some lumps of it to take the essence ; then peel, and beat it in a mortar with the juice of a large lemon, and mix all with four or five ounces of butter warmed. Put a crust into a shallow dish, nick the edges, and put the above into it. When served, turn the pudding out of the dish.

S4 7 PASTRY. Have ready washed and dried four pounds of cur- rants, and add as you make the pies, with candied fruit. LEMON MINCE PIES. Squeeze a large lemon, boil the ouside till tender enough to beat to a mash, add to it three large apples chopped, and four ounces of suet, half a pound of currants, four ounces of sugar; put the juice of the lemon, and candied fruit as for other pies. Make a short crust, and fill the patty-pans as usual. EGG MINCE PIES. Boil six eggs hard, shred them small ; shred double the quantity of suet: then put currants washed and pick one pound, or more, if the eggs were large; the peel of one lemon shred very fine, and the juice, six spoonsful of sweet wine, mace, nutmeg, sugar, a very little salt: orange, lemon, and citron, candied. Make a light paste for them. CURRANT AND RASPBERRY. For a tart, line the dish, put sugar and fruit, lay bars across, and bake. LIGHT PASTE FOR TARTS AND CHEESE-CAKES. Beat the white of an egg to a strong froth ; then mix it with as much water as will make three quarters of a pound of fine flour into a very stiff paste; roll it very thin, then lay the third part of half a pound of butter upon it in little bits ; dredge it with some flour left out at first, and roll it up tight. Roll it out again, and put the same proportion of butter; and so pro- ceed till all be worked up.

2G3 VEGETABLES. VEGETABLE MAKROW, TO BOIL OR STEW. This excellent vegetable may be boiled as aspa- ragus. When boiled, divide it lengthways into two, and serve it up on toast accompanied by melted butter; or when nearly boiled, divide it as above, and stew gently in gravy like cucumbers. Care should be taken to choose young ones not exceed- ing six inches in length. TO KEEP GREEN PEAS. Shell, and put them into a kettle of water when it boils; give them two or three walms only, and pour them into a colander. When the water drains off, turn them out on a dresser covered with cloth and pour them on another cloth to dry perfectly. Then bottle them in wide-mouthed bottles ; leaving only room to pour clarified mutton-suet upon them an Inch thick, and for the cork. Rosin it down ; and keep it in the cellar or in the earth, as will be directed for gooseberries under the head of keeping for Winter.— When they are to be used, boil them till tender, with a bit of butter, a spoonful of sugar, and a bit of mint. Another way, as practised in the Emperor of Russia's kitchen.—When they are to be used, let them lie an hour in water; then set them on with cold water and a bit of butter, and boil them till ready. Put a sprig of dried mint to boil with them. BOILED PEAS Should not be overdone, nor in much water. Chop some scalded mint to garnish them, and stir a piece of butter in with them. \ TO STEW GREEN PKA8. Put a quart of peas, a lettuce and an onion both sliced, a bit of butter, pepper, salt, and no more water

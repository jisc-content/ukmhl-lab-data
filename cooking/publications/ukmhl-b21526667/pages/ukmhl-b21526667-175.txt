1*29 POULTRY. DIRECTIONS FOR DRESSING POULTRY AND GAME. All poultry should be very carefully picked, every plug removed, and the hair nicely singed with white paper. The cook must be careful, in drawing poultry of all sorts, not to break the gall-bag, for no washing will take off the bitter where it has touched. In dressing wild fowl, be careful to keep a clear brisk fire. Let them be done of a fine yellow brown, but leave the gravy in: the fine flavour is lost if done too much. Tame fowls require more roasting, and are longer in heating through than others. All sorts should be continually basted; that they may be served with a froth, and appear of a fine colour. A large fowl will take three quarters of an hour; a middling one half an hour; and a very small one, or a chicken, twenty minutes. The fire must be very quick and clear before any fowls are put down. A capon will take from half an hour to thirty five minutes ; a goose an hour; wild ducks a quarter of an hour: pheasants twenty minutes ; a small turkey stuffed, an hour and a quarter ; turkey-poults, twenty minutes ; grouse a quarter of an hour ; quails, ten minutes. A hare will take near an hour, and the hind part requires most heat. Pigs and geese require a brisk fire, and quick turn- ing. Hares and rabbits must be well attended to : and the extremities brought to the quick part of the fire, to be done equally with the backs. DIRECTIONS FOR TRUSSING POULTRY AND GAME. In London every article is generally trussed by the poulterer of whom it is bought; but, n evert lieless, it frequently happens that, either from inexperience or negligence of the servants, and want of knowledge in the cook, the article appears on the table with disgrace.

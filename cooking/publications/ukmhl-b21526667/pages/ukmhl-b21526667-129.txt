BEKF. 83 most of the fat, and well seasoned, with salt, pepper, and spices. Parboil and skin as many potatoes as you think enough, but the proportion is 4 lbs. weight to 2 lbs. of meat. Peel 8 or 10 onions (for 4 lbs. meat), lay some sliced suet, if you have it, at the bottom of the stew-pan, if not, a tea-cupful of melted butter, put in a layer of potatoes, sliced, then a layer of chops, slice a layer of onions over them, then potatoes and mutton, and so on, letting the top layer be potatoes ; pour in half a pint of broth or water. A shank or small piece of ham will be an improvement. This should, like all other stews, cook very slowly ; when the meat is tender, the potatoes will, perhaps, be boiled to a mash, therefore, have some boiled whole, by them- selves, to be served round the stew. Beef (not rump) steaks, and any of the coarser parts, make a much better Irish stew than mutton. MARROW-BONES. Cover the top with floured cloth ; boil them and serve with dry toast. TRIPE may be served in a tureen, stew'ed with milk and onion till tender. Melted butter for sauce. Or fry it in small bits dipped in batter. Or stew the thin part, cut into bits, in gravy; thicken with flour and butter, and add a little ketchup. Or fricassee it with white sauce. SOUSED TRIPE. Boil the tripe, but not quite tender; then put it into salt and water, which must be changed every day till it is all used. When you dress the tripe, dip it into a batter of flour and eggs, and fry it of a good brown. TRIPE TO FRICASSEE. Stew a piece of the thick part of tripe, wrell boiled, in some clear veal stock, well seasoned. When suffi- ciently cooked, cut it in strips, shake it over the fire

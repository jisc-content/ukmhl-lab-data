DOMESTIC COOKKKT. '250 bars of paste, or a croquant cover over, and bake in a moderate oven. FRIED PATTIES. Mince a bit of cold veal, and six. oysters, mix with a few crumbs of bread, salt, pepper, nutmeg, and a very small bit of lemon-peel—add the liquor of the oysters ; warm all in a tosser, but don’t boil; let it go cold; have ready a good puff-paste, roll thin, and cut it in round or square bits; put some of the above between two of them, twist the edges to keep in the gravy, and fry them of a fine brown. This is a very good thing ; and baked, is a fashion- able dish. Wash all patties over with egg before baking. OYSTER PATTIES. Put a fine puff-paste into small patty-pans, and cover with paste, with a bit of bread in each; and against they are baked have ready the following to fill with, taking out the bread. Take off the beards of the oysters, cut the other parts in small bits, put them in a small tosser, with a grate of nutmeg, the least white pepper, and salt, a morsel of lemon-peel, cut so small that you can scarcely see it, a little cream, and a little of the oyster liquor. Simmer for a few minutes be- fore you fill. Observe to put a bit of crust into all patties, to keep them hollow while baking. LOBSTER PATTIES. Make with the same seasoning, a little cream, and the smallest bit of butter.

The raspberry-juice will serve to put into brandy, or may be boiled with its weight in sugar for making the jelly or raspberry-ice or cream. TO BOTTLE RASPBERRIES. Take an equal weight of crushed fruit and pow- dered loaf sugar, mix well together, and put them into wine bottles ; cork tight and rosin the corks. In this way of preserving without boiling, the colour and flavour are very fine, and they will keep through the year. RASPBERRIES WHOLE. Gather on a dry day, and after a dry night. To one pound of fruit allow half a pound of white sugar pounded, or white sugar candy ; put a layer of fruit and a layer of sugar, alternately, into a preserving-pan, and keep shaking till it boils, taking off the scum. Boil it ten minutes.â€”When cold, cover with brandy papers, and tie bladders over. TO PRESERVE GREKNGACES. Choose the largest, when they begin to soften ; split them without paring, and strew a part of the sugar of which you have previously weighed an equal quantity. Blanch the kernels with a small sharp knife. Next day, pour the syrup from the fruit, and boil it wdth the other sugar six or eight minutes, very gently; skim, and add the plums and kernels. Sim- mer till clear, taking off any scum that rises ; put the fruit singly into small pots, and pour the syrup and kernels to it. If you would candy it, do not add the syrup, but observe the direction that will be given for candying fruit. Some may be done each way.

DOMESTIC COOKEHY. â€˜208 EEL PIE. Cut the eels in lengths of two or three inches, season with pepper and salt, and place in the dish, with some bits of butter, and a little water ; and cover it with paste. COD PIE. Take a piece of the middle of a small cod, and salt it well one night: next day wash it; season with pepper, salt, and a very little nutmeg, mixed ; place in a dish, and put some butter on it, and a little good broth of any kind into the dish. Cover it with a crust; and, when done, add a sauce of a spoonful of broth, a quarter of a pint of cream, a little flour and butter, a grate of lemon and nutmeg, and give it one boil. Oysters may be added. Mackarel will do well, but do not salt them till used. Parsley picked and put in may be used instead of oysters. SOLE PIE. Split some soles from the bone, and cut the fins close; season with a mixture of salt, pepper, a little nutmeg and pounded mace, and put them in layers, with oysters. They eat excellently. A pair of middling sized ones will do, and half a hundred of oysters. Put in the dish the oyster liquor, two or three spoonsful of broth, and some butter. When the pie comes home, pour in a cupful of thick cream. SHRIMP PIE, EXCELLENT. Pick a quart of shrimps; if they are very salt, season them with only mace and a clove or two. Mince two or three anchovies ; mix these with the spice, and then season the shrimps. Put some butter at the bottom of the dish, and over the shrimps, with a glass of sharp white wine. The paste must be light and thin. They do not take long baking.

407 COOKERY FOR THE SICK. and cover close with a dish or coarse crust: bake till the beef is done enough for eating, with only as much water as will cover. When cold, cover it close in a cool place. When to be used, give what flavour may be approved. A QUICK MADE BROTH. Take a bone or two of a neck or loin of mutton, take off the fat and skin, set it on the fire in a small tin sauce-pan that has a cover, with three quarters of a pint of water, the meat being first beaten, and cut in thin bits; put a bit of thyme and parsley, and, if ap- proved, a slice of onion. Let it boil very quick, skim it nicely ; take off the cover, if likely to be too weak ; else cover it. Half an hour is sufficient for the whole process. A VERY SUPPORTING BROTH AGAINST ANY KIND OF WEAKNESS. Boil two pounds of loin of mutton, with a very- large handful of chervil, in two quarts of water to one. Take off part of the fat. Any other herb or roots may be added. Take half a pint three or four times a day. A VERY NOURISHING VEAL BROTH. Put the knuckle of a leg or shoulder of veal, with very little meat to it, an old fowl, and four shank- bones of mutton extremely well soaked and bruised, three blades of mace, ten pepper-corns, an onion, and a large bit of bread, and three quarts of water, into a stew-pot that covers close, and simmer in the slowest manner after it has boiled up, and been skimmed; or bake it: strain, and take off the fat. Salt as wanted. It will require four hours.

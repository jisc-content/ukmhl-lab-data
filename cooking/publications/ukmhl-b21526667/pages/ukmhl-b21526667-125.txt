79 BEEF. Observe, that it is owing to boiling hashes or minces that they get hard. All sorts of stews, or meat dressed a second time, should be only simmered ; and this last only hot through. BEEF X-LA-VINGRETTE. Cut a slice of underdone boiled beef three inches thick, and a little fat ; stew it in half a pint of water, a glass of white wine, a bunch of sweet herbs, an onion, and a bay leaf : season it with three cloves pounded, and pepper, till the liquor is nearly wasted away, turning it once. When cold, serve it. Strain off the gravy, and mix it with a little vinegar for sauce. ROUND OF BEEF should he carefully salted, and wet with the pickle for eight or ten days. The bone should be cut out first, and the beef skewered and tied up to make it quite round. It maybe stuffed with parsley, if approved; in which case the holes to admit the parsley must be made with a sharp pointed knife, and the parsley coarsely cut and stuffed in tight. As soon as it boils it should be skimmed, and afterwards kept boiling very gently. ROLLED BEEF THAT EQUALS HARE. Take the inside of a large sirloin, soak it in a glass of port wine and a glass of vinegar mixed, for forty-eight hours ; have ready a very fine stuffing, and bind it up tight. Roast it on a hanging spit; and baste it with a glass of port wine, the same quantity of vinegar, and a tea-spoonful of pounded allspice. Larding it im- proves the look and flavour; serve with a rich gravy in the dish ; currant-jelly and melted-butter, in tureens. TO ROAST TONGUE AND UDDER. After cleaning the tongue well, salt it with common salt and saltpetre three days ; then boil it, and likewise a fine young udder with some fat to it, till tolerably tender; then tie the thick part of one to the thin part of the other, and roast the tongue and udder together.

MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS. 1 1 people ought to form their conduct on their circum- stances, but it is presumed that a judicious arrange- ment according to them will be found equally advan- tageous to all. The minutiae of management must be regulated by every oneâ€™s fortune and rank; some ladies, not deficient in either, charge themselves with giving out once in a month, to a superintending ser- vant, such quantities of household articles as by ob- servation and calculation they know to be sufficient, reserving for their own key the l^rge stock of things usually laid in for very large families in the country. Should there be several more visitors than usual, they can easily account for increase of consumption, and vice versa. Such a degree of judgment will be respect- able even in the eye of domestics, if they are not interested in the ignorance of their employers; and if they are, their services will not compensate for want of honesty. When young ladies marry, they frequently continue their own maids in the capacity of house-keepers; who, as they may be more attached to their interest than strangers, become very valuable servants. To such, the economical observations in this work will be as useful as the cookery; and it is recommendable in them to be strictly observant of both, which, in the course of a year or two, will make them familiar in the practice. It is much to be feared that for the waste of many of the good things that God has given for our use, not abuse, the mistress and servants of great houses will hereafter be called to a strict account.

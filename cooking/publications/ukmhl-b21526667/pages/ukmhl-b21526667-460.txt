DOMESTIC COOKEKY. 412 EGGS. An egg broken into a cup of tea, or beaten and mixed with a basin of milk, makes a breakfast more supporting than tea solely. An egg divided, and the yolk and white beaten sepa- rately, then mixed with a glass of wine, will afford two very wholesome draughts, and prove lighter than when taken together. Eggs very little boiled, or poached, taken in small quantity, convey much nourishment, the yolk only, when dressed, should be eaten by invalids. A GREAT RESTORATIVE. Bake two calves’ feet in two pints of water, and the same quantity of new milk, in a jar close-covered, three hours and a half. When cold remove the fat. Give a large tea-cupful the last and first thing. Whatever flavour is approved, give it by baking in it lemon-peel, cinnamon, or mace. Add sugar after. Another.—Simmer six sheep’s trotters, two blades of mace, a little cinnamon, lemon-peel, a few harts- horn shavings, and a little isinglass, in two quarts of water to one; when cold, take off the fat, and give near half a pint twice a day, warming with it a little new milk. Another.—Boil an ounce of isinglass shavings, forty Jamaica peppers, and a bit of brown crust of bread, in a quart of water to a pint, and strain it. This makes a pleasant jelly to keep in the house j of which a large spoonful may be taken in wine and water, milk, tea, soup, or any way. Another, a most pleusant Draught.—Boil a quarter of an ounce of isinglass shavings with a pint of new milk, to half: add a bit of sugar, and, for change, a bitter almond. Give this at bed-time, not too warm. Dutch flummery, blamange, and jellies, as directed

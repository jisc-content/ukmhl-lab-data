DOMESTIC COOKERY. 212 PASTRY. RICH PUFF PASTE. Puffs may be made of any sort of fruit, but it should be prepared first with sugar. Weigh an equal quantity of butter with as much fine flour as you judge necessary ; mix a little of the former with the latter, and wet it with as little water as will make into a stiff paste. Roll it out, and put all the butter over it in slices, turn in the ends, and roll it thin ; do this twice, and touch it no more than can be avoided. The butter may be added at twice ; and to those who are not accustomed to make paste it may be better to do so. A quicker oven than for short crust. A LESS RICH PASTE. Weigh a pound of flour, and a quarter of a pound of butter, rub them together, and mix into a paste with a little water, and an egg well beatenâ€”of the former as little as will suffice, or the paste will be tough. Roll, and fold it three or four times. Rub extremely fine in one pound of dried flour, six ounces of butter, and a spoonful of white sugar ; work up the whole into a stiff paste with as little hot water as possible. CRUST FOR VENISON PASTY. To a quarter of a peck of fine flour use two pounds and a half of butter, and four eggs ; mix into paste with warm water, and work it smooth and to a good consistence. Put a paste round the inside, but not to the bottom of the dish, and let the cover be pretty thick, to bear the long continuance in the oven.

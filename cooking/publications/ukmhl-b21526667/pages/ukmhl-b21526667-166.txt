DOMESTIC COOKERY. 120 MUTTON STEAKS should be cut from a loin or steak that has hung ; if a neck, the bones should not be long. They should be broiled on a clear fire, seasoned when half done, and often turned ; take them up into a very hot dish, rub a bit of butter on each, and serve hot and hot the moment they are done. STEAKS OF MUTTON, OR LAMB, AND CUCUMBERS. Quarter cucumbers, and lay them into a deep dish, sprinkle them with salt, and pour vinegar over them. Fry the chops of a fine brown, and put them into a stew-pan; drain the cucumbers, and put over the steaks; add some sliced onions, pepper, and salt; pour hot water or weak broth on them ; stew and skim well. MUTTON STEAKS MAINTENON. Half fry, stew them while hot with herbs, crumbs, and seasoning ; put them in paper immediately, and finish on the gridiron. Be careful the paper does not catch : rub a bit of butter on it first to prevent that. MUTTON SAUSAGES. Take a pound of the rawest part of a leg of mutton that has been either roasted or boiled ; chop it ex- tremely small, and season it with pepper, salt, mace, and nutmeg: add to it six ounces of beef-suet, some sweet herbs, two anchovies, and a pint of oysters, all chopped very small ; a quarter of a pound of grated bread, some of the anchovy-liquor, and the yolks and whites of two eggs well beaten. I*ut it all, when well mixed, into a little pot; and use it by rolling it into balls, or sausage-shape, and frying. If approved, a little shalot may be added, or garlick, which is a great improvement. TO DRESS MUTTON RUMPS AND KIDNEY. Stew six rumps in some good mutton-gravy half an hour ; then take them up, and let them stand to cool.

SAVOURY PIES. *2 1 l the sweetbreads, and some oysters up to the top of the dish. Lay over the whole some very thin slices of ham, and fill up the dish with water; cover; and, when it is taken out of the oven, pour in at the top, through a funnel, a few spoonsful of good veal-gravy, and some cream to fill up ; but first boil it up with a tea-spoonful of flour. Truffles, &c., if approved. VEAL AND SAUSAGE PIE. Season a veal cutlet, and beat it well ; lay it at the bottom of a shallow pie-dish previously covered with paste ; lay on the veal a Bologna sausage, without the skin, cut into slices ; add another cutlet, and cover it with sausages in a similar manner. Put a paste over the whole, but use no water with it. The veal will give sufficient gravy. This is an excellent pie to be eaten cold. VEAL (or CHICKEN) AND PARSLEY PIE. Cut some slices from the leg or neck of veal; if the leg, from about the knuckle. Season them with salt; scald some parsley that is picked from the stems, and squeeze it dry; cut it a little, and lay it at the bottom of the dish ; then put the meat, and so on, in layers. Fill the dish with new milk, but not so high as to touch the crust. Cover it; and, when baked, pour out a little of the milk, and put in half a pint of good scalded cream. Chicken may be cut up skinned, and made in the same way. VEAL-OLIVE PIE. Make the olives as directed in page 93; put them round the dish, making the middle highest. Fill it up almost with water, and cover it. Add gravy, cream, and flour.

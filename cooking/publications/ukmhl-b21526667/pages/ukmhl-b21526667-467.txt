Put a tea-cupful of cranberries into a cup of water, and mash them. In the mean time boil two quarts of water with one large spoonful of oatmeal and a bit of lemon-peel; then add the cranberries, and as much fine Lisbon sugar as shall leave a smart flavour of the fruit: and a quarter of a pint of sherry, or less, as may be proper j boil all for half an hour, and strain off. SOFT AND FINE DRAUGHT FOR THOSE WHO ARE WEAK AND HAVE A COUGH. Beat a fresh laid egg, and mix it with a quarter of pint of new milk warmed, a large spoonful of eapil- laire, the same of rose-water, and a little nutmeg scraped. Don't warm it after the egg is put in. Take it the first and last thing. TOAST AND WATER. Toast slowly a thin piece of bread till extremely brown and hard, but not the least black ; then plunge it into a jug of cold water, and cover it over an hour before used. This is of particular use to weak bowels. It should be of a fine brown colour before drinking. BARLEY WATER. Wash a handful of common barley, then simmer it gently in three pints of water with a bit of lemon- peel. This is less apt to nauseate than pearl-barley 5 but the other is a very pleasant drink.

Fill the dish half way up with a mar- malade of apples: have ready the whites of four eggs beaten to a fine froth, and put them over the marmalade ; then sift fine sugar over it, and set it in the oven, which should be warm enough to give it a beautiful colour. ORANGE SOUFFLE. Mix a table-spoonful of flour with a pint of cream, put it into a sauce-pan, with two table-spoonsful of rose water, some orange and lemon-peel; stir till it boils, then strain and sweeten it: when cold add two table-spoonsful of orange marmalade. Beat six eggs, stir in a wine-glassful of brandy, mix with the other ingredients, and put all into a buttered shape ; place it in a sauce-pan of boiling water, over a stove: let the water boil an hour and a quarter without any cover to the shape. LEMON SOUFFLE. Pour three quarters of a pint of boiling water, over an ounce of isinglass, the juice of three lemons, and five ounces of sifted sugar; when dissolved, boil all together five minutes, pour it into a large basin, when the steam is gone off, whisk it till it becomes spongy, then put it in a glass dish. It should be made the day before it is wanted, and requires a long time to whisk it enough. SNOW BALLS. Swell rice in milk, and strain it off, and having pared and cored apples, put the rice round them, tying each up in a cloth. Put a bit of lemon-peel, a clove, or cinnamon in each, and boil them well.

DOMESTIC COOKERY. 1S8 GOOSEBERRY SAUCE. Cut off the tops and tails of a breakfast-cupful of gooseberries ; scald them a few minutes, then stir them into melted butter.—Or: mash the gooseberries after they are scalded, sweeten to taste, and serve, without butter. CUCUMBER SAUCE. Pare the cucumbers, slice, and cut them in small pieces, stew them in thin broth or melted butter; when boiled tender enough, press them through a sieve into melted butter, stir, and heat it up. This may be seasoned with mace, nutmeg, lemon-peel, and finely grated ham. But a dish of stewed cucumbers answers the purpose. LEMON SAUCE. Cut thin slices of lemon into very small dice, and put them into melted butter ; give it one boil, and pour it over boiled fowls. * CARRIER SAUCE FOR MUTTON. Chop six shalots fine ; and boil them up with a gill of gravy, a spoonful of vinegar, some pepper and salt. Serve in a boat. SAUCE FOR A SHOULDER OF MUTTON. When the shoulder of mutton is more than half done, put a plate under it, with some spring water in it, two or three spoonsful of red wine, a sliced onion, a little grated nutmeg, and anchovy washed and minced’ and a bit of butter. Let the meat drop into it, and when it is taken up, put to it a spoonful of vinegar. Put the sauce into a saucepan, give it a boil up, strain it through a sieve, and put it under the mutton.

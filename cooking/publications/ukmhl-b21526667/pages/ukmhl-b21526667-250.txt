202 DOMESTIC COOKERY, vary from an hour and a quarter to two hours and a half, according to the nature and quantity of the meat. Mutton will take the shortest time, and the brisket end of a breast of veal the longest. A fowl will be ready to serve in an hour. A sour apple or two, or cucumbers pared, seeded and cut small, are an excel- lent addition to the curry. Lemon juice should be mixed in before the curry is served when there is no other acid in it. A dish of boiled rice must be sent to table with it. Two pounds of meat is sufficient for a moderate sized curry, and six ounces of rice. CURRIED OYSTERS AN INDIAN DISH. Open one hundred oysters into a bason taking care not to lose any of their liquor. Put a lump of fresh butter into a stew-pan, and when it boils, add an onion cut into thin slices, and let it fry in the un- covered stew-pan until it is of a brown colour, then add another lump of butter and two or three table- spoonsful of curry powder. Mix these ingredients over the fire with a wooden spoon, and add gradually some broth or hot water; then cover the stew-pan and let the whole boil up; after it boils, put into the stew-pan the meat of a cocoa-nut grated or rasped with a sour apple chopped fine. Let the whole simmer until the apple is dissolved and the cocoa- nut tender, when add a cup-full of stiff thickening made of flour and water, and a sufficient quantity of salt. Let it boil for five minutes. Next put the oysters with their liquor and the milk of the cocoa- nut into the stew-pan, stir them well with the former ingredients, and let it stew gently for a few minutes, then throw in the juice of half a lemon. Stir the curry with a wooden spoon, and as soon as the oysters are done enough, serve it up with a dish of rice on the opposite side of the table. CURRY POWDER is made in different ways. One rule, however, is to be observed in all cases ; viz. when the powder is made, put it into a wide mouthed bottle, cork it down

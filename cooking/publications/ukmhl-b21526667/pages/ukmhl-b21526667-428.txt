DOMESTIC COOKERY. 3 SO of a pint of yeast, and so by degrees add a little more. In an hour pour the small quantity to the large, pour the liquor on clary-flowers, picked in the dry ; the quantity for the above is twelve quarts. Those who gather from their own garden may not have sufficient to put in at once, and may add as they can get them, keeping account of each quart.

If raisin wine be much used, it would answer well to keep a cask always for it, and bottle off one yearâ€™s wine just in time to make the next, which, allowing the six months of infusion, would

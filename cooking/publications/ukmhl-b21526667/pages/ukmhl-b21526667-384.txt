In a day or two remove the syrup, leaving only a little in each half. In a day or two more, turn them, and so continue daily till quite dry, in the sun or a warm place. Keep in boxes with layers of paper. PEACHES IN BRANDY. Gather peaches before they are quite ripe, prick them with a large needle, and rub off the down with a piece of flannel. Pass a quill carefully round the stone, to loosen it. Put them into a large preserving pan, with cold water, rather more than enough to cover them, and let it gradually become scalding hot. If the water does more than simmer very gently, or the fire be fierce, the fruit is likely to crack. When they are tender, lift them carefully out, and fold them in flannel, or a soft table-cloth, in several folds. Have ready a quart, or more as the peaches require, of the best brandy, and dissolve in it ten ounces of powdered sugar. When they are cool, put them into a glass jar, and pour the brandy and sugar over. Cover with leather, or a bladder.â€”Apricots and Plums are done in the same way. TO PRESERVE ORANGES OR LEMONS IN JELLY. Cut a hole in the stalk part, the size of a shilling, and with a blunt small knife scrape out the pulp quite clear without cutting the rind. Tie each separately in muslin, and lay them in spring water two davs, changing twice a day; in the last boil them tender on a slow fire. Observe that there is enough at first to allow for wasting, as they must be covered to the last. To every pound of fruit, weigh two pounds of double refined sugar, and one pint of water ; boil the two latter together with the juice of the orange to a syrup, and clarify it, skim well, and let it stand to be cold; then boil the fruit in the syrup half an hour; if not clear, do this daily till they are done.

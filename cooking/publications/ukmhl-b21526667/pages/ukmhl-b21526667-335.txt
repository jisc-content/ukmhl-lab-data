SWEET DISHES. FLUMMERY. Put three large handsful of very small white oat- meal to steep a day and night in cold water; then pour it off clear, and add as much more water, and let it stand the same time. Strain it through a fine hair sieve, and boil till it be as thick as hasty pudding; stirring it well all the time. When first strained, put to it one large spoonful of white sugar, and two of orange-flower water. Pour it into shallow dishes ; and serve to eat with wine, cyder, milk, or cream and sugar. It is very good. FRENCH FLUMMERY. Beat half an ounce of isinglass fine, put to it a quart of cream, and mix them well together. Let it boil softly over a slow fire for a quarter of an hour, and keep stirring it all the time. Then take it off, sweeten it to your taste, and put in a spoonful of rose water, and another of orange flower water. Strain it, and pour it into a glass or bason, or whatever else you please, and when it be cold, turn it out. DUTCH FLUMMERY.

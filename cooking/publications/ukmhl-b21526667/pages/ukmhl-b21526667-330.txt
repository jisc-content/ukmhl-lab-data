DOMESTIC COOKERY. <292 ditto of shalots, one ounce of cloves, ditto of mace, ditto of pepper, and one clove of garlic. Let all simmer till the shalots sink ; then put the liquor into a pan till cold ; bottle and divide the spice to each. Cork closely, and tie a bladder over. It will keep twenty years, and is not good the first. Be very care- ful to express the juice at home ; for it is rarely una- dulterated, if bought. Some people make liquor of the outside shell when the nut is ripe ; but neither the flavour nor the colour is then so fine. COCKJ/E KETCHUP. Open the cockles, scald them in their own liquor ; add a little water when the liquor settles, if you have not enough ; strain through a cloth, then season with every savoury spice; and if for brown sauce, add port, anchovies, and garlic—if for white, omit these, and put a glass of sherry, lemon-juice and peel, mace, nutmeg, and white pepper. If for brown, burn a bit of sugar for colouring. It is better to have cockles enough than to add water; and they are cheap. TO KEEP CAPERS. Add fresh vinegar that has been scalded, and become cold—and tie them close to keep out the air, which makes them soft.

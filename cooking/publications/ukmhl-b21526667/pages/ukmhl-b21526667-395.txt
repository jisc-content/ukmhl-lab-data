preserv r.s. 317 BIFFINS. Put a quantity of red biffins into a cool oven six or seven times j and, when they are soft enough to bear it, flatten them gently by degrees. Be sure to put them into a cool oven ;â€”if it should be hot, they will waste and be spoiled. TO PRESERVE JARGONELLE PEARS MOST BEAUTIFULLY. Pare them very thin, and simmer in a thin syrup j let them lie a day or two. Make the syrup richer, and simmer again ; and repeat this till they are clear j then drain, and dry them in the sun or a cool oven a very little time.

When they have stood a week, boil your syrup again, and pour it carefully into your jar, lest you break the tops of your pine-apples. Let it stand eight or ten weeks, and during that time give the syrup two or three boilings to keep it from moulding. Let your syrup stand till it be nearly cold before you put it on ; and when your pine-apples look quite full and gTeen, take them out of the syrup, and make a thick

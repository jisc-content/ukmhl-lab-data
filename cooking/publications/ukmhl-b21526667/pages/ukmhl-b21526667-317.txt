Those that have a white or yellow fur should be care- fully avoided, though many of them have the same smell (but not so strong) as the right sort. TO STEW MUSHROOMS. The large buttons are best, and the small flaps while the fur is still red. Rub the large buttons with salt and a bit of flannel, cut out the fur, and take off the skin from the others. Sprinkle them with salt, and put into a stew-pan with some pepper-corns ; simmer slowly till done, then put a small bit of butter and flour, and two spoonsful of cream ; give them one boil, and serve with sippets of bread. TO STEW SORREL FOR FRICANDEAU AND ROAST MEAT. Wash the sorrel, and put it into a silver vessel, or stone jar, with no more water than hangs to the leaves. Simmer it as slow as you can, and when done enough put a bit of butter, and beat it well. FRENCH SALAD. Chop three anchovies, a shalot, and some parsley, small ; put them into a bowl with two table-spoons- ful of vinegar, one of oil, a little mustard, and salt. When well mixed, add by degrees some cold roast or boiled meat in very thin slices; put in a few at a time, not exceeding two or three inches long. Shake them in the seasoning, and then put more ; cover the bowl close, and let the salad be prepared three hours before it is to be eaten. Garnish with parsley, and a few slices of the fat.

70 DOMESTIC COOKERY. When cold fold it in a sheet of paper, and it will keep in a dry place two or three months, ready for serving on bread and butter. THE DUTCH WAY TO SALT BEEF. Take a lean piece of beef; rub it well with treacle or brown sugar, and let it be turned often. In three days wipe it, and salt it with common salt and salt- petre beaten fine : rub these well in, and turn it every day for a fortnight. Roll it tight in a coarse cloth, and press it under a large weight; hang it to dry in a wood-smoke, but turn it upside down every day. Boil it in pump-water, and press it: it will grate or cut into shivers, like Dutch beef. BEEF A-LA-MODE. Choose a piece of thick flank of a fine heifer or ox. Cut into long slices some fat bacon, but quite free from yellow ; let each bit be near an inch thick: dip them into vinegar, and then into a seasoning ready prepared of salt, black pepper, allspice, and a clove, all in fine powder, with parsley, chives, thyme, savoury, and knotted marjoram, shred as small as possible, and well mixed. With a sharp knife make holes deep enough to let in the larding; then rub the beef over with the seasoning, and bind it up tight with tape. Set it in a well-tinned pot over a fire or rather stove; three or four onions must be fried brown and put to the beef, with 2 or 3 carrots, 1 turnip, a head or two of celery, and a small quantity of water; let it simmer gently ten or twelve hours, or till extremely tender, turning the meat twice. Put the gravy into a pan, remove the fat, keep the beef covered, then put them together, and add a glass of port wine. Take off the tape, and serve with the vegetables ; or you may strain them off, and send them up cut into dice for garnish. Onions roasted and then stewed with the gravy are a great improve- ment. A tea-cupful of vinegar should be stewed with the beef.

161 SOUPS. stand to be cold; take off the fat, which will make good paste for hot meat-pies, or will do to baste. Put to the soup a pint of split peas, or a quart of whole ones, twelve carrots, six turnips, six potatoes, six large onions, a bunch of sweet herbs, and two heads of celery. Simmer them without the meat till the vege- tables are done enough to pulp with the peas through a sieve, and the soup will then be about the thickness of cream. Season it with pepper, salt, mace, allspice, a clove or two, and a little Cayenne, all in fine powder. If the peas are bad the soup may not be thick enough, then boil in it a slice o£ roll and put it through the cullender, or add a little rice-Hour, mixing it by degrees. For the Ragout cut the nicest part of the head, the kernels, and part of the fat of the root of the tongue into small thick pieces. Rub these with some of the above seasoning as you put them into a quart of the liquor, kept out for that purpose before the vegetables were added, flour well, and simmer them till nicely tender. Then put a little mushroom and walnut- ketchup, a little soy, a glass of port wine, and a tea- spoonful of made mustard, and boil all up together before served. If for company small eggs and force- meat balls. This way furnishes an excellent soup and a ragout at a small expense, and they are not common. The other part will warm for the family. SOUP X-LA-SAP.

244 DOMESTIC COOKERY. The above butter will make a great deal of raised crust, which must not be rich, or it will be difficult to prevent the sides from falling. EXCELLENT SHORT CRUST. Make two ounces of white sugar, pounded and sifted, quite dry ; then mix it with a pound of flour well dried ; rub into it three ounces of butter, so fine as not to be seen—into some cream put the yolks of two eggs, beaten, and mix the above into a smooth paste ; roll it thin, and bake it in a moderate oven. Another.—Mix with a pound of fine flour dried, an ounce of sugar pounded and sifted ; then crumble three ounces of butter in it, till it looks all like flour, and, with a gill of boiling cream, work it up to a fine paste. Another, not sweet, but rich.—Rub six ounces of butter in eight ounces of fine flour; mix into a stiffish paste, with as little water as possible; beat it well, and roll it thin. This, as well as the former, is proper for tarts of fresh or preserved fruits. Bake in a moderate oven. A VERY FINE CRUST FOR ORANGE-CHEESE-CAKES, OR SWEETMEATS, WHEN TO BE PARTICULARLY NICE. Dry a pound of the best flour, mix with three ounces of refined sugar; then work half a pound of butter with your hand till it come to froth ; put the flour into it by degrees, and work into it, well beaten and strained, the yolks of three, and whites of two eggs. If too limber, put some flour and suear to make it fit to roll. Line your patty-pans, and fill. A little above fifteen minutes will bake them. Against they come out, have ready some refined sugar beaten up with the white of an egg, as thick as you can; ice them all over, set them in the oven to' harden, and serve cold. Use fresh butter.

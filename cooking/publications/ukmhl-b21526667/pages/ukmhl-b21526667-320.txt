It is extremely good boiled, and sliced with a small quantity of onion; or stewed with whole onions, large or small, as follows : Boil the beet tender with the skin on, slice it into a stew-pan with a little broth, and a spoonful of vine- gar ; simmer till the gravy is tinged with the colour, then put it into a small dish, and make a round of the button-onions, first boiled till tender; take off the skin just before serving, and mind they are quite hot and clear.

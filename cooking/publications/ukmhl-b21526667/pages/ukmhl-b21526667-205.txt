SOUPS. 157 If richness or greater consistency be wanted, a good lump of butter mixed with flour, and boiled in the soup, will give either of these qualities. Long boiling is necessary to give the full flavour of the ingredients, therefore time should be allowed for soups and gravies ; and they are best if made the day before they are wanted. Soups and gravies are far better when the meat is put at the bottom of the pan and stewed, and tire herbs, roots, &c., with butter, than when water is put to the meat at first ; and the gravy that is drawn from the meat should be almost dried up before the water is put to it. Do not use the sediment of gravies, &c., that have stood to be cold. When onions are strong boil a turnip with them, if for sauce ; this will make them mild. If soups or gravies are too weak do not cover them in boiling, that the watery particles may evaporate. A clear jelly of Cow-heels is very useful to keep in the house, being a great improvement to soups and gravies. Truffles and morels thicken soups and sauces, and give them a fine flavour. Wash half an ounce of each carefully, then simmer them a few minutes in water, and add them with the liquor, to boil in the sauce, 8cc., till tender. PLAIN STOCK. Having read the foregoing directions, get a leg or shin of beef, broken in two or three places, and well wash it. Cover with water, and boil it slowly as directed. An old fowl, if you have it, a rabbit, any trimmings of beef, mutton, or veal, heads, necks, giz- zards of poultry (quite fresh), may go into the stock ; also any fresh bones. Watch and carefully scum, then give it salt, to taste, and a large carrot, a head of celery, 2 turnips, and “2 onions. Simmer this so gently as not to waste the liquor, from four to five hours, then strain as directed.—Rabbits are excellent in the making of stock. More onions may be used than I p

DOMESTIC COOKERY. 80 Serve them with good gravy, and currant-jelly sauce. A few cloves should be stuck in the udder. This is an excellent dish. Some people like neat’s tongues cured with the root, in which case they look much larger; but otherwise the root must be cut off close to the gullet, next to the tongue, but without taking away the fat under the tongue. The root must be soaked in salt and water, and extremely well cleaned, before it is dressed: and the tongue should be laid in salt for a day and a night before pickled. TO PICKLE TONGUES FOR BOILING. Cut off the root, but leave a little of the kernel and fat. Sprinkle some salt, and let it drain from the slime till next day : then for each tongue mix a large spoon- ful of common salt, the same of coarse sugar, and about half as much of saltpetre; rub it well in, and do so every day. In a week add another heaped spoon- ful of salt. If rubbed every day, a tongue will be ready in a fortnight; but if only turned in the pickle daily, it will keep four or five weeks without being too salt. When you dry tongues, write the date on a parch- ment and tie it on. Smoke them, or dry them plain, if you like best. VVhen it is to be dressed, boil it till extremely tender ; allow five hours; and, if done sooner, it is easily kept hot. The longer kept after drying, the higher it will be : if hard, it may require soaking three or four hours. Another way.—Clean as above : for two tongues allow an ounce of saltpetre, and an ounce of sal-pru- nella; rub them well. In two days, after well rubbing, cover them with common salt, turn them every day for three weeks, then dry them, and rub over them bran, and smoke them. In ten days they will be fit to eat. Keep in a cool dry place. TO STEW TONGUES. Salt a tongue with saltpetre and common salt for a week, turning it every day. Boil it tender enough to

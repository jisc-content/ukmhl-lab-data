MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS. 9 much to the propriety of female management, as to the knowledge and activity of the father. The lady of a general officer observed to her man- cook, that her last weekly bill was higher than usual. Some excuse was offered ;—to which she replied :— “ Such is the sum I have allotted to house-keeping ; should it be exceeded one week, the next must repay it. The general will have no public day this week.” The fault was never repeated. March’s “Family Book-keeper” is a very useful work, and saves much trouble; the various articles of expense being printed, with a column for every day in the year, so that at one view the amount of expen- diture on each, and the total sum, may be known. Ready-money should be paid for all such things as come not into weekly bills, and even for them a check is necessary. The best places for purchasing should be attended to. In some articles a discount of five per cent, is allowed for ready money in London and other large cities, and those who thus pay are usually best served. Under the idea of buying cheap, many go to new shops, but it is safest to deal with people of established credit, who do not dispose of goods by underselling. To make tradesmen wait for their money injures them greatly, besides that a higher price must be paid, and in long bills, articles never bought are often charged. Perhaps the irregularity and failure of pay- ment may have much evil influence on the price of various articles, and may contribute to the destruction of many families from the highest to the lowest.

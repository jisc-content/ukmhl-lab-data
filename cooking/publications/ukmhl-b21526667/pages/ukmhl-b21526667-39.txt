MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS. 7 practice in other domestic affairs gradually fits them for their own future houses. Habit alone can make good carvers; but some principal directions are hereafter given, with a reference to the annexed plates. The mistress of a family should always remember that the welfare and good management of the house depend on the eye of the superior; and consequently that nothing is too trifling for her notice, whereby waste may be avoided ; and this attention is of more importance now that the price of every necessary of life is increased to an enormous degree. If a lady has never been accustomed, while single, to think of family management, let her not upon that account fear that she cannot attain it: she may con- sult others who are more experienced, and acquaint herself with the necessary quantities of the several articles of family expenditure, in proportion to the number it consists of, the proper prices to pay, &c. A minute account of the annual income, and the times of payment, should be taken in writing ; like- wise an estimate of the supposed amount of each article of expense; and those who are early accustomed to calculations on domestic articles will acquire so accurate a knowledge of what their establishment requires as will give them the happy medium between prodigality and parsimony, without acquiring the character of meanness. Perhaps few branches of female education are so useful as great readiness at figures. Accounts should be regularly kept, and not the smallest article omitted to be entered; and, if balanced every week and month.

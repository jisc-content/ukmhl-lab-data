SAVOURY PIES. ‘217 A WOODCOCK PI K TO BE EATEN COLD. The woodcock and partridge pie. are made nearly alike, only the entrails are made use of. When the woodcocks are picked, put the entrails by, and truss them as for roasting. Make the breast-bone flat, and broil them over some clear charcoal. When they are cold, lard them all-over ; then pound some bacon in a marble mortar, mix it with the livers of the woodcocks, which also bruise, with two or three leaves of sweet basil. Cut the entrails very small, and mix them with the other seasoning. Raise the pie, lay at the bottom some of the stuffing, and put the rest into the birds, putting between them some pounded bacon and fresh butter mixed together, with a very little mace, pepper and salt. When the pie is almost filled, take a cut- let cut quite round a fillet of veal, and over that some slices of bacon cut very thin. Then put on the lid. It should stand three or four hours, according to the quantity of birds, and when it comes out of the oven, set it to cool. HARE PIE, TO EAT COLD. Season the hare after it is cut up; and bake it, with eggs and forcemeat, in a raised crust or dish. When it is to be served, cut off the lid, and cover it with jelly-gravy, as in page 177- A FRENCH PIE. Lay a puff-paste round on the ledge of the dish : and put in either veal in slices, rabbits or chickens jointed ; with forcemeat-balls, sweetbreads cut in pieces, artichoke-bottoms, and a few truffles. a bride’s pie.

DOMESTIC COOKERY. 19<) FISH SAUCE WITHOUT BUTTER. Simmer very gently a quarter of a pint of vinegar and half a pint of water (which must not be hard), with an onion, half a handful of horse-radish, and the following spices lightly bruised ; four cloves, two blades of mace, and half a tea-spoonful of black pepper. When the onion is quite tender, chop it small with two anchovies, and set the whole on the fire to boil for a few minutes, with a spoonful of ketchup. In the mean time, have ready and well beaten the yolks of three fresh eggs ; strain them, mix the liquor by degrees with them, and, when well mixed, set the sauce-pan over a gentle fire, keeping a bason in one hand, into which toss the sauce to and fro, and shake the saucepan over the fire, that the eggs may not curdle. Donâ€™t boil them, only let the sauce be hot enough to give it the thickness of melted butter. FISH SAUCE A-LA CRASTER. Thicken a quarter of a pound of butter with flour, and brown it; then put to it a pound of the best anchovies cut small, six blades of pounded mace, ten cloves, forty berries of black pepper and allspice, a faw small onions, a faggot of sweet herbs (namely savoury, thyme, basil, and knotted marjoram), and a little parsley and sliced horse-radish: on these pour half a pint of the best sherry, and a pint and a half of strong gravy. Simmer all gently for twenty minutes, then strain it through a sieve, and bottle it for use: the way of using it is, to boil some of it in the butter while melting.

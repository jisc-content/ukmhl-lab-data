Mix the juice of the fruits with as much sugar as will be wanted, before you add cream, which should be of a middling richness. BROWN BREAD ICE. Grate as fine as possible stale brown bread, soak a small proportion in cream two or three hours, sweeten and ice it. WATER ICES OF ORANGES OR LEMONS. To a pint of juice put a pint of water, half a gill of brandy, sweeten it with clarified sugar, and freeze it well. ICE RATAFIA CREAM. Blanch a quarter of an ounce of bitter almonds, and beat them with a tea-spoonful of water in a mar- ble mortar ; then rub with the paste two ounces of lump-sugar, and simmer ten minutes with a tea-cupful of cream, which add to a quart more of cream, and having strained, ice it.

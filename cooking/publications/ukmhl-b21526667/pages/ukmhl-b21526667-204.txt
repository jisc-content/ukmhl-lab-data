DOMESTIC COOKERY. 156 colour of the soup. Soup made thus will have a finer flavour; though it will not make quite so good an ap- pearance as if the meat were not browned. Thickening for soup is made of bread raspings. Biscuit crumbs are also good, and, where biscuits are much consumed, the crumbs ought to be saved for the purpose ; particularly for delicate soup. The thickening most commonly used is made of flour rubbed in butter, or fat skimmings. Flour or meal is easily coloured, by being spread on a plate, and placed in a Dutch oven before the fire. Turn it with a spoon, and let it remain until it has obtained the colour you wish. Keep it covered close, for use. Potatoe flour, a table-spoonful, mixed smooth in a cup of water, will give a nice thickness to soup. Barley and oatmeal, also Indian corn meal, maybe used in the same quantity. This thickening should be put in after that scumming has taken place which the vegetables have made necessary. But the French mode of thick- ening soup is superior to any of the above. (See Roux.) Meat for soup should be cut into slices not more than an inch in thickness ; and much water should not be used at first, as good soup cannot be produced if a large quantity of water is used. The lid of the saucepan or stewpan should also fit tight, as the juices of the meat are more easily extracted if the steam does not escape. GENERAL DIRECTIONS RESPECTING SOUPS AND GRAVIES. When there is any fear of gravy-meat being spoiled before it lie wanted, season well and fry it lightly, which will preserve it two days longer ; but the gravy is best when the juices are fresh. When soups or gravies are to be put by let them be changed every day into fresh scalded pans. Whatever has vegetables boiled in it is apt to turn sour sooner than the juices of meat. Never keep any gravy, &e., in metal. When fat remains on any soup a tea-cupful of flour and water mixed quite smooth, and boiled in, will take it off.

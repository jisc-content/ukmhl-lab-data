DOMESTIC COOKERY. 316 with a tea-spoon, and mix with grated beef, tongue, or anchovies. Make a wreath of curled parsley to garnish. RAMAKINS. Scrape a quarter of a pound of Cheshire, and ditto of Gloucester cheese, ditto of good fresh butter; then beat all in a mortar with the yolks of four eggs, and the inside of a small French roll boiled in cream till soft; mix the paste with the whites of the eggs previously beaten, and put into small paper pans made rather long than square, and bake in a Dutch oven till of a fine brown. They should be eaten quite hot. Some like the addition of a glass of white wine.â€”The batter for ramakins is equally good over maccaroni when boiled tender ; or on stewed brocoli, celery, or cauliflower, a little of the gravy they have been stewed in being put in the dish with them, but not enough to make the vegetable swim. FONDU. Take equal quantities of grated Parmesan and good Cheshire cheese, and add about double the weight of this in beaten yolk of eggs and melted butter, beaten well together, add pepper and salt, and then put to it the whites of the eggs, which have been beaten sepa- rately 5 stir them lightly in, and bake it in a deep dish, fill only half full, as it will rise very much. Serve quite hot. POTTED CHEESE. Cut and pound four ounces of Cheshire cheese, one ounce and a half of fine butter, a tea-spoonful of white pounded sugar, a little bit of mace, and a glass of white wine. Press it down in a deep pot.

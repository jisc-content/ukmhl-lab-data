PART XII. COOKERY FOR THE SICK, AND FOR THE POOR. COOKERY FOR THE SICK. GENERAL REMARKS. The following pages will contain cookery for the sick ; it being of more consequence to support those whose bad appetite will not allow them to take the necessary nourishment, than to stimulate that of persons in health. It may not be unnecessary to advise that a choice be made of the things most likely to agree with the patient; that a change be provided; that someone at least be always ready-; that not too much of those be made at once, which are not likely to keep, as invalids require variety; and that they should succeed each other in different forms and flavours. A CLEAR BROTH THAT WILL KEEP LONG. Put the mouse round of beef, a knuckle bone of veal, and a few shanks of mutton, into a deep pan.

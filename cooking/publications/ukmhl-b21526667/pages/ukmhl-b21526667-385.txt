PRESERVES. 33? Pare and core some green pippins, and boil in water till it tastes strong of them ; donâ€™t break them, only gently press them with the back of a spoon ; strain the water through a jelly-bag till quite clear; then to every pint put a pound of double-refined sugar, the peel and juice of a lemon, and boil to a strong syrup. Drain off the syrup from the fruit, and, turning each orange with the hole upwards in a jar, pour the apple jelly over it. The bits cut out must go through the same process with the fruit. Cover with brandy paper. TO KEEP ORANGES OR LEMONS FOR PUDDINGS. When you squeeze the fruit, throw the outside in water, without the pulp ; let them remain in the same a fortnight, adding no more ; boil them therein till tender, strain it from them, and when they are tolerably dry throw them into any jar of candy you may have remaining from old sweetmeats ; or, if you have none, boil a small quantity of syrup of common loaf-sugar and water, and put over them ; in a week or ten days boil them gently in it till they look clear, and that they may be covered with it in the jar. You may cut each half of the fruit in two, and they will occupy small space. TO PRESERVE STRAWBERRIES W'HOLF,. Take equal weights of the fruit and double-refined sugar; lay the former in a large dish, and sprinkle half the sugar in fine powder over; give a gentle shake to the dish, that the sugar may touch the under- side of the fruit. Next day make a thin syrup with the remainder of the sugar, and, instead of water, allow one pint of red-currant-juice to every pound of strawberries; in this simmer them until sufficiently jellied. Choose the largest scarlets, or others, when not dead ripe. In either of the above ways, they eat well served in thin cream, in glasses. 2 G

DOMESTIC COOKERY. 146 and when done, put a little sprig of myrtle into the bill of each. Have ready a savoury jelly, as before, and with it half fill a bowl of such a size as shall be proper to turn down on the dish you mean it to be served in. When the jelly and the birds are cold, see that no gravy hang to the birds, and then lay them upside down in the jelly. Before the rest of it begins to set, pour it over the birds, so as to be three inches above the feet. This should be done full twenty-four hours before serving. This dish has a very handsome appearance in the middle range of a second course ; or when served with the jelly roughed large, it makes a side or corner thing, its size being then less. The head should be kept up as if alive, by tying the neck with some thread, and the legs bent as if the pigeon sat upon them. TO POT PIGEONS. Let them be quite fresh, clean them carefully, and season them with salt and pepper: lay them close in a small deep pan ; for the smaller the surface, and the closer they are packed, the less butter will be wanted. Cover them with butter, then with very thick paper tied down, and bake them. When cold, put them dry into pots that will hold 2 or 3 in each ; and pour butter over them, using that which was baked as part. Ob- serve that the butter should be pretty thick over them, if they are to be kept. If pigeons were boned, and then put in an oval form into the pot, they would lie closer, and require less butter. They may be stuffed with a fine forcemeat made with veal, bacon, &c., and then they will eat excellently. If a high flavour is approved of, add mace, allspice, and a little Cayenne, before baking. LARKS, AND OTHER SMALL BIRDS. Draw, and spit them on a bird-spit j tie this on another spit, and roast them. Baste gently with but- ter, and strew bread-crumbs upon them till half done ; brown and serve with fried crumbs round.

PART VII. VEGETABLES. OBSERVATIONS ON DRESSING VEGETABLES. Vegetables should be carefully cleaned from in- sects, and nicely washed. Boil them in plenty of water, and drain them the moment they are done enough. If overboiled, they lose their beauty and crispness. Bad cooks sometimes dress them with meat} which is wrong, except carrots with boiling beef. TO BOIL VEGETABLES GREEN. Be sure the water boils when you put them in. Make them boil very fast. Donâ€™t cover, but watch them ; and if the water has not slackened, you may be sure they are done when they begin to sink. Then take them out immediately, or the colour will change. Hard water, especially if chalybeate, spoils the colour of such vegetables as should be gteen. To boil them green in hard water, put a tea-spoonful of salt of wormwood into the water when it boilsj before the vegetables are put in. ASPARAGUS TO BOIL. Scrape your asparagus, and cut them in equal lengths, and tie them in small bundles} put them into boiling water with salt in it. Let the water keep boiling, and when they are a little tender, take them up. If you boil them too much they will lose both their colour and taste } toast some slices of bread, and dip them in the water the aspa- ragus was boiled in, then pour a little melted butter over the toast, and lay the asparagus upon it; serve them quite hot with melted butter.

DOMESTIC COOKERY. 14*2 pan, and the chickens on them. Put to them a few onions, a faggot of herbs, three blades of mace, a pint of stock, and a glass or two of sherry. Cover the chickens with slices of bacon, and then white paper ; cover the whole close, and put them on a slow stove for two hours. Then take them up, strain the braise, and skim olf the fat carefully : set it on to boil very quick to a glaze, and do the chickens over with it with a brush. Serve with a brown fricassee of mushrooms. Before glazing, put the chicken into an oven for a few minutes, to give a little colour. DUCKS ROASTED. Serve with a fine gravy : and stuff one with sage and onion, a dessert-spoonful of crumbs, a bit of butter, and pepper and salt; let the other be unseasoned. TO BOIL DUCKS. Choose a fine fat duck ; salt it two days, then boil it slowly in a cloth. Serve it with onion-sauce, but melt the butter with milk instead of water. TO STEW DUCKS. Half roast a duck ; put it into a stew-pan with a pint of beef-gravy, a few leaves of sage and mint cut small, pepper and salt, and a small bit of onion shred as fine as possible. Simmer a quarter of an hour, and skim clean : then add near a quart of green peas. Cover close, and simmer near half an hour longer. Put in a piece of butter, and a little flour, and give it one boil; then serve in one dish. TO HASH DUCKS. Cut a cold duck into jointsand warm it, without boiling in gravy, and a glass of port wine.

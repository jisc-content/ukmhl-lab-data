91 VEAL. CUTLETS ANOTHER WAY. Prepare as above, and fry them; lay them into dish, and keep them hot; dredge a little flour, and put a bit of butter into the pan; brown it, then pour a little boiling water into it, and boil quick : season with pepper, salt, and ketchup, and pour over them. Other ways.—Prepare as before, and dress the cut- lets in a Dutch-oven ; pour over them melted butter and mushrooms. Or, pepper, salt, and broil them, especially neck- steaks. They are excellent without herbs. VEAL COLLOPS. Cut long thin collops ; beat them well j and lay on them a bit of thin bacon of the same size, and spread forcemeat on that, seasoned high, and also a little garlick and Cayenne. Roll them up tight, about the size of two fingers, but not more than two or three inches long; put a very small skewer to fasten each firmly ; rub egg over ; fry them of a fine brown, and pour a rich brown gravy over. TO DRESS COLLOPS QUICK. Cut them as thin as paper with a very sharp knife, and in small bits. Throw the skin, and any odd bits of veal, into a little water, with a dust of pepper and salt; set them on the fire while you heat the collops ; and dip them into a seasoning of herbs, bread, pepper, salt, and a scrape of nutmeg, but first wet them in egg. Then put a bit of butter into a frying-pan, and give the collops a very quick fryj for as they are so thin, two minutes will do them on both sides: put them into a hot dish before the fire ; then strain and thicken the gravy, give it a boil in the frying-pan, and pour it over the collops. A little ketchup is an improvement. Another way.—Fry them in butter, only seasoned with salt and pepper j then simmer them in gravy, either white or brown, with bits of bacon served with them.

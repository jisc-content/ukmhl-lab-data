3 <26 DOMESTIC COOKERY. The fruit is so hard that, if it be not done as above, it requires a great deal of time. Stewing quinces in a jar. and then squeezing them through a cheese-cloth, is the best method of obtain- ing the juice to add as above, and dip the cloth in boiling water first and wring it.

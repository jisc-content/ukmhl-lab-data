86 DOMESTIC COOKERY. pepper, dredge with flour, and brown them in another stew-pan. Then strain the broth, pour it over them, and let it stew very slowly half an hour; thicken the gravy with white roux, or butter rolled in flour, add the juice of half a lemon, then serve the ragout. KNUCKLE OF VEAL WITH RICE. Cut off the steaks to cook as cutlets, or in a pie, so as to leave no more meat on the bone than will be eaten hot, for cold boiled veal is not good, and makes but a poor mince. Break the shank bone, wash it, and put it in a stew-pan, with â€œ2 quarts of water, salt, an onion, a blade of mace, and a bunch of parsley. When it boils, scum well, and put in 21b. of well- washed rice. This will require, at least, two hours gentle stewing. Put the meat in a deep dish, and lay the rice, drained from the liquor, round. Serve bacon and greens. SHOULDER OF VEAL. Cut off the knuckle, for a stew or gravy. Roast the other part with stuffing: you may lard it. Serve with melted butter. The blade-bone, with a good deal of meat left on, eats extremely well with mushroom or oyster-sauce, or mushroom-ketchup in butter. NECK OF VEAL. Cut off the scrag to boil, and cover it with onion- sauce. It should be boiled in milk and water. Parsley and butter may be served with it, instead of onion- sauce. Or it may be stewed with whole rice, small onions, and pepper-corns, with a very little water. Or boiled and eaten with bacon and grfiens. The best end may be either roasted, broiled as steaks, or made into pies. NECK OF VEAL A-LA-BRAISE. Lard the best end with bacon rolled in parsley

DOMESTIC COOKERY. 20t> 3 eggs well beaten, and mixed in from £ to a whole pint of spring water. Roll the paste out thin, double it up, and roll out again •, repeat this for the third time, and it is ready for use. BRIOCHE PASTE. Take ten fresh eggs, one pound of very dry flour, and three quarters of a pound of fresh butter, prepare some yeast in the following manner. Take some fresh yeast and mix it with some water, stirring it well; let it remain for an hour, pour off the water, and use the sediment only. Take a dessert spoonful of the yeast, a little hot water, and mix it with the fourth portion of the flour, this makes the yeast paste or leaven. Sprinkle some flour into a small stewpan, put in the yeast paste, make two or three slits on the top, cover it, and put it before the fire to rise, which it will do in a quarter of an hour if the yeast is good. Make a great hole in the remaining three-fourths of the flour, add a little salt, a tea-spoonful of sugar to correct the bitter taste of the yeast, and a little water to melt the salt; then take three-quarters of a pound of fresh butter, break it into small pieces, and put it into the middle of the flour, next break the eggs ; mix the whole well together and knead it thoroughly. After having well kneaded it over, spread it out thinly, and pour the yeast paste all over it, then well knead it again twice. As the quality of the Brioche greatly depends upon the intimately blending of all the materials, great attention should be paid to their well kneading and mixing. Take a large sieve or earthen pan, spread a towel in it, sprinkle a little flour, put the paste on it, and cover it with the towel. In sum- mer keep it in a cool place, in winter in a warm one; the paste is better when made a day before it is wanted> break it several times before you use it. You may make a great many different dishes with the Brioche by giving it various forms, using different flavouring materials and employing different means

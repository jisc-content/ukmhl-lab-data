SAUCES. 1S9 HAM SAUCE. When a ham is almost done with, pick all the meat lean from the bone, leaving out any rusty part ; beat the meat and the bone to a mash with a rolling-pin ; put it into a sauce-pan, with three spoonsful of gravy; set it over a slow lire, and stir it all the time, or it will stick to the bottom. When it has been on some time, put to it a small bundle of sweet herbs, some pepper, and half a pint of beef-gravy; cover it up, and let it stew over a gentle fire. When it has a good flavour of the herbs, strain off the gravy. A little of this is an improvement to all gravies. ACHA. Pound together in a mortar half a Spanish onion, four capsicums, and as much salt and lemon-juice as may suit your taste. A VERY FINE FISH SAUCE. Put into a very nice tin sauce-pan a pint of fine port wine, a gill of mountain, half a pint of fine walnut-ketchup, twelve anchovies, and the liquor that belongs to them, a gill of walnut-pickle, the rind and juice of a large lemon, four or five shalots, some Cay- enne to taste, three ounces of scraped horse-radish, three blades of mace, and two tea-spoonsful of made mustard ; boil it all gently, till the rawness goes off; then put it into small bottles for use. Cork them very close, and seal the top. Another.â€”Chop twenty-four anchovies not washed, and ten shalots, and scrape three spoonsful of horse- radish ; which, with ten blades of mace, twelve cloves, two sliced lemons, half a pint of anchovy- liquor, a quart of hock, or Rhenish wine, and a pint of water, boil to a quart: then strain off; and when cold, add three large spoonsful of walnut-ketchup, and put into small bottles well corked.

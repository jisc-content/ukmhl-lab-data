DOMESTIC COOKERY. S43 wholly excluded, it will be necessary to cover the bladder with another piece, separately tied. Put the jar into a kettle of cold water up to the bladders, and let them boil for three hours. Do not cover the kettle. TO PRESERVE FRUIT FOR TARTS, OR FAMILY DESSERTS. Cherries, plums of all sorts, and American apples, gather when ripe, and lay them in jars that will hold a pound ; strew over each jar six ounces of good loaf sugar pounded : cover with two bladders each, sepa- rately tied down ; then set the jars in a large stew- pan of water up to the neck, and let it boil three hours gently. Keep these and all other sorts of fruit free from damp. TO KEEP CODLINS FOR SEVERAL MONTHS. Gather codlins at Midsummer of a middling size, put them into an earthen pan, pour boiling water over them, and cover the pan with cabbage-leaves. Keep them by the fire till they would peel, but donâ€™t peel them ; then pour the water off till they are both quite cold. Place the codlins then in a stone jar with a smallish mouth, and pour on them the water that scalded them. Cover the pot with bladder wetted, and tied very close, and then over it coarse paper tied again. It is best to keep them in small jars, such as will be used at once when opened. DRIED APPLES. Put them in a cool oven six or seven times, and flatten them by degrees, and gently, when soft enough to bear it. If the oven be too hot they will waste ; and at first it should be very cool. The biffin, the minshul crab, or any tart apples, are the sorts for drying.

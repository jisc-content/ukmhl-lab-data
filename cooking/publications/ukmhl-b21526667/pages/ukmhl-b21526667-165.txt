Season the collops with salt, pepper, and mace; and strew over them shred parsley, thyme, and two or three shalots : fry them in butter till half-done; add half a pint of gravy, a little juice of lemon, and a piece of butter rubbed in flour : and simmer the whole very gently five minutes. They should be served immediately, or they will be hard. COTELETTES A LA MINUTE. Cut rather thin slices from an uncooked leg; put a good sized piece of butter in a frying pan, and when that is hot, lay in the slices of meat, and turn them often j keep them hot, when done, while you fry, in the pan, a good bunch of parsley, and what other herbs you like, chopped fine. Moisten these with a little good broth, let them stew in it a few minutes. Lay the cutlets in the middle of the dish, and the herbs round. A supper or breakfast dish. MUTTON KIDNEYS. Skin and split the kidneys, rub with salt and pepper, and pin them out with small wire skewers, to keep them open. Dip in melted butter, then lay them on the gridiron, the inside downwards first, that when you turn them the gravy may be saved. Have ready a little melted butter and parsley; put the kidneys on a very hot dish, and pour a little of the melted butter into each one.â€”A breakfast dish. MUTTON CUTLETS IN THE PORTUGUESE WAY. Cut the chops ; and half fry them with sliced shalot or onion, chopped parsley, and two bay-leaves j season with pepper and salt: then lay a forcemeat on a piece of white paper, put the chop on it, and twist the paper up, leaving a hole for the end of the bones to go through. Broil on a gentle fire. Serve with sauce Hobart; or, as the seasoning makes the cutlets high, a little gravy.

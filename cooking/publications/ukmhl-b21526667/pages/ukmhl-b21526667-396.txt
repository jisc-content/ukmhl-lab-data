DOMESTIC COOKERY. 348 syrup of three pounds of double-refined sugar, with as much water as will dissolve it. Boil and skim it well, put a few slices of white ginger into it, and when it be nearly cold, pour it upon your pine-apples. Tie them down close with a bladder, and they will keep many years without shrinking. TO PRESERVE GRAPES. Put into a jar some close bunches of grapes, but they must not be too ripe ; it matters not, whether they be red or white grapes. Put to them a quarter of a pound of sugar-candy, and fill the jar with com- mon brandy. Tie them up close with a bladder, and set them in a dry place. Morello cherries may be preserved in the same manner. TO PRESERVE QUINCES. Quinces may be preserved either whole, or in quar- ters, in this manner. Having pared them very thin and round, (and cut into quarters, if you choose it) put them into a saucepan, fill it with hard water, and lay your parings over your quinces to keep them down. Cover your saucepan close that no steam may get out, and set them over a slow fire till they be soft, and of a fine pink colour. Then let them stand till they be cold. Make a good syrup of double refined sugar, and boil and skim it well. Then put in your quinces, let them boil ten minutes, then take them off, and let them stand two or three hours. Then boil them till the syrup looks thick, and the quinces clear. Then put them into deep jars, and with brandy paper and leather over them, tie them up close. CUCUMBERS TO PRESERVE. Choose the greenest and most free from seeds, some small, to preserve whole, others large, to cut in long slices. Put them in strong salt and water, cover with vine leaves, and set them in a warm place till they are

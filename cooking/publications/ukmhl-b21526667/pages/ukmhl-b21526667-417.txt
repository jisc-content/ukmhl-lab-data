CAKES. ?6l) time; take it off, and pour the water into a vessel; let it stand till near cold ; then pour it gently out, and in the sediment will be seen the ingredients which have been mixed. The alum will be dissolved in the water, and may be extracted from it. If jalap has been used, it will form a thick film at top, and the heavy ingredients will sink to the bottom. EXCELLENT ROLLS. Warm one ounce of butter in half a pint of milk, put to it a spoonful and a half of yeast of small beer, and a little salt. Put two pounds of flour into a pan, and mix in the above. Let it rise an hour; knead it well; make into seven rolls, and bake in a quick oven. If made in cakes three inches thick, sliced and buttered, they resemble Sally Lummâ€™s, as made at Bath. The foregoing receipt, with the addition of a little saffron boiled in half a tea-cupful of milk, makes remarkably good. FRENCH ROLLS. Rub an ounce of butter into a pound of flour; mix one eeg beaten, a little yeast that is not bitter, and as much milk as will make a dough of middling stiffness. Beat it well, but do not knead ; let it rise and bake on tins. BRENTFORD ROLLS. Mix with two pounds of flour a little salt, two ounces of sifted sugar, four ounces of butter, and two eggs beaten with two spoonsful of yeast, and about a pint of milk. Knead the dough well, and set it to rise before the fire. Make twelve rolls, butter tin- plates, and set them before the fire to rise, till they become of a proper size ; then bake half an hour.

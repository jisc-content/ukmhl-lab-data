Dip them into yolks of eggs, and cover them with crumbs. Do the egg over them again, and then put more crumbs; and fry them a beautiful colour in lard. Soles in the Portuguese way. Take one large or two small: if large, cut the fish in two ; if small, they need only be split. The bones being taken out, put the fish into a pan with a bit of butter and some lemon juice, give it a fry, then lay the fish on a dish, and spread a forcemeat over each piece, and roll it round, fastening the roll with a few- small skewers. Lay the rolls into a small earthen pan, beat an egg and wet them, then strew crumbs over ; and put the remainder of the egg, with a little meat- gravy, a spoonful of caper-liquor, an anchovy chopped fine, and some parsley chopped, into the bottom of the pan ; cover it close, and bake till the fish are done enough in a slow oven. Then place the rolls in the dish for serving, and cover it to keep them hot till the gravy baked is skimmed : if not enough, a little fresh flavoured as above must be prepared and added to it. Portuguese stuffing for Soles baked. Pound cold beef, mutton, or veal, a little ; then add some fat bacon that has been lightly fried, cut small, and some onions, a little garlick or slialot, some par- sley, anchovy, pepper, salt, and nutmeg; pound all fine with a few crumbs, and bind it with two or three yolks of eggs. The heads of the fish are to be left on one side of the split part, and kept on the outer side of the roll ; and when served the heads are to be turned towards each other in the dish. Garnish with fried or dried parsley. An excellent way of dressing a large Plaice, especially if there be a roe. Sprinkle with salt, and keep twenty-four hours â€¢

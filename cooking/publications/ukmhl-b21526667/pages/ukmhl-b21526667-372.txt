MIXED MARMALADE. Pare and take out the cores of two dozen of apples and the same number of pears ; then add four dozen plums, of which the stones have been taken ; blanch the kernels, and pound them in a mortar with a little rose-water ; then put the whole into a jar with a little sugar, but no water. Bake them, but not in a hot oven. Having done this, beat them well in a preserv- ing-pan, stir in three pounds of sugar, and boil them for an hour; put the marmalade into small deep dishes, and dry it gently in a cool oven. ORANGE MARMALADE. Rasp the oranges, cut out the pulp, then boil the rinds very tender, and beat fine in a marble mortar. Boil three pounds of loaf-sugar in a pint of water, skim it, and add a pound of the rind ; boil fast till the syrup is very thick, but stir it carefully ; then put a pint of the pulp and juice, the seeds having been re- moved, and a pint of apple-liquor; boil all gently until well jellied, which it will be in about half an hour. Put it into small pots. LEMON MARMALADE. Do in the same way ; it is a very good and elegant sweetmeat, as well as orange marmalade. BARBERRY MARMALADE. Take some fine ripe barberries and strip them care- fully from the stalks ; then wash them in hard water, drain them, and bruise them a little, after which put into a clean jar, and let them stand for a short time.

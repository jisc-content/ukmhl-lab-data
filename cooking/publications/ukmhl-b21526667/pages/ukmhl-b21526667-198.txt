150 DOMESTIC COOKER V. roasted chesnuts blanched, and artichoke-bottoms cut in quarters, two or three yolks of eggs, and a little lemon juice. Cover close, and let them stew an hour softly. If the sauce is not thick enough, put a piece of butter rolled in flour, and shake it round. When it is thick, take up the plovers, and pour the sauce over them. Garnish with roasted chesnuts. Plovers may be roasted as woodcocks, with a toast under them and served up with gravy and butter. Plovers' eggs are a nice and fashionable dish. Boil them ten minutes, and serve either hot or cold on a napkin. TO ROAST ORTOLANS. Pick and singe, but do not draw them. Tie on a bird-spit, and roast them. Some persons like bacon in slices tied between them, but the taste of it spoils the flavour of the ortolan. Cover them with crumbs of bread. GUINEA AND PEA FOWL eat much like pheasants. Dress them in the same way (see page 147). HARES, if properly taken care of, will keep a great time: and even when the cook fancies them past eating, may be in the highest perfection ; which if eaten when fresh killed they are not. As they are usually paunched in the Held, the cook cannot prevent this ; but the hare keeps longer, and eats much better, if not opened for four or five days, or according to the weather. If paunched, as soon as a hare comes in, it should be wiped quite dry, the heart and liver taken out, and the liver scalded to keep for the stuffing. Repeat this wiping every day ; mix pepper and ginger, and rub on the inside; and put a large piece of charcoal into it. Apply the spice early to prevent that musty taste which long keeping in the damp occasions, and which also affects the stuffing. An old hare should be kept us long as possible, if to be roasted. It must also he well soaked.

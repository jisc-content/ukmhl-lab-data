233 PUDDINGS. lemon shred as fine as possible, six Jamaica peppers in fine powder, four eggs, a glass of brandy, a little salt, and as little milk as will make it of a proper con- sistence; boil it in a floured cloth, or a melon-mould, eight or nine hours. Serve with sweet sauce. Add sometimes a spoonful of peach-water for change of flavour. This pudding will keep, after it is boiled, six months, if kept tied up in the same cloth, and hung up, folded in a sheet of cap-paper to preserve it from the dust, being first cold. When to be used, it must boil a full hour. COMMON PLUM PUDDING The same proportions of flour, and suet, and half the quantity of fruit, with spice, lemon, a glass of wine or not, and one egg and milk, will make an ex- cellent pudding, if long boiled. A CHRISTMAS PUDDING. To 1 lb. suet add 1 lb. flour, 1 lb. raisins, 1 lb. currants (chopped fine), 4 oz. bread crumbs, 2 table- spoonsful sugar, 1 of grated lemon-peel, a blade of mace, i a nutmeg, a tea-spoonful of ginger, and 6 eggs well beaten. Mix well and boil five hours. CUSTARD PUDDING. Mix by degrees a pint of good milk with a large spoonful of flour, the yolks of five eggs, some orange- flower water, and a little pounded cinnamon. Butter a basin that will exactly hold it, pour the batter in, and tie a floured cloth over. Put in boiling-water over the fire, and turn it about a few minutes to pre- vent the egg going to one side. Half an hour will boil it. Put currant-jelly on it, and serve with sweet sauce. x 3

ANOTHER AND RICHER. Place some slices of very good ham, not all lean, at the bottom of a stew-pan, then some thick slices or pieces of knuckle of veal, a fowl or two, and some- thing of the game kind, if convenient; both these latter cut up. Let it be well heated, but not scorched ; add 3 pints of plain stock, a few chopped mushrooms, a little parsley, a very few green onions, a blade of mace, and 2 cloves. Scum carefully, and let this stew gently till all the ingredients are well cooked. It may be thickened either white or brown according to taste. See Thickening. A CLEAR BROWN STOCK FOR GRAVY-SOUP OR GRAVY. Put a knuckle of veal, a pound of lean beef, and a pound of the lean of a gammon of bacon, all sliced, into a stew-pan with two or three scraped carrots, two onions, two turnips, two heads of celery sliced, and two quarts of water. Stew the meat quite tender, but do not let it brown. When thus prepared it will serve either for soup, or brown or white gravy; if for brown gravy put some of the above colouring, and boil a few minutes. GRAVY SOUP. Wash and soak a leg of beef; break the bone, and set it on the fire with a gallon of water, a large bunch •of sweet herbs, two large onions sliced and fried a fine brown (but not burnt), two blades of mace, three cloves, twenty berries of allspice, and forty black peppers. Stew till the soup as rich as you choose ; then take out the meat, which will be fit for the serv- ants’ table with a little of the gravy. Next day take off the cake of fat; which will serve for basting, or for common pie-crust. Have ready such vegetables as

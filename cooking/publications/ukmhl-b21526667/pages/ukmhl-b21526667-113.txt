Set it in a stew-pan that will only just hold it, with some mutton or beef gravy not strong, half a pint of port wine, some pepper and all- spice. Simmer it close-covered, as slow as you can, for 3 or 4 hours. When quite tender, take off, then tape, set the meat in a dish 3 strain the gravy over it 3 serve with currant-jelly sauce.—This is the best way to dress this joint, unless it is very fat, and then it should be roasted.

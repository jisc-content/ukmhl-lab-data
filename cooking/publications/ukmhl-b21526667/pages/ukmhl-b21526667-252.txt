â€¢ 204 PART VI. PIES, PUDDINGS, AND PASTRY. OBSERVATIONS ON PASTRY. Pastry should be made on a slab of marble or slate ; because these substances, being cold and smooth, cause less waste than a board. Choose as cool a place as convenient for making it; and observe that the less it is touched by the hands the better ; nor should it be rolled much. If it is much wetted in making, it will be sure to be tough. RAISED CRUST FOR MEAT-PIES, OR FOWLS, &C. Boil water with a little fine lard, and an equal quantity of fresh dripping, or of butter, but not much of either. While hot, mix this with as much flour as you will want, making the paste as stiff as you can to be smooth, which you will make it by good kneading and beating it with the rolling-pin. When quite smooth, put a lump into a cloth, or under a pan, to soak till near cold. Those wdio have not a good hand at raising crust may do thus : Roll the paste of a proper thickness, and cut out the top and bottom of the pie, then a long piece for the sides. Cement the bottom to the sides with egg, bringing the former rather further out, and pinching both together j put egg between the edges

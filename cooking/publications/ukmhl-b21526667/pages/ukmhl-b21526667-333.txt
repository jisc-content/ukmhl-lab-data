SWEKT DISHES. Qsr, LENT POTATOES. Heat three or four ounces of almonds, and three or four bitter, when blanched, putting a little orange- ^lower water to prevent oiling; add eight ounces of butter, four eggs well beaten and strained, half a glass of raisin wine, and sugar to your taste. Beat all well till quite smooth, and grate in three Savoy biscuits. Make balls of the above with a little flour, the size of a chesnut; throw them into a stew-pan of boiling lard, and boil them of a beautiful yellow brown. Drain them on a sieve. Serve sweet sauce in a boat, to eat with them. A TANSY. Beat seven eggs, yolks and whites separately; add a pint of cream, near the same of spinach-juice, and a little tansey-juice gained by pounding, in a stone mortar, a quarter of a pound of Naples biscuit, sugar to taste, a glass of white wine, and some nutmeg. Set all in a sauce-pan, just to thicken, over the fire ; then put it into a dish, lined with paste, to turn out, and bake it. LEMON SPONGE. Simmer in a pint of water an ounce of isinglass, he rind of a lemon, and half a pound of lump-sugar. When it has been on the fire for half an hour, strain it through a lawn sieve ; when nearly cold, add the juice of three lemons and the white of one egg, and whisk it until it is white and thick. In the summer, a little more isinglass will be required.

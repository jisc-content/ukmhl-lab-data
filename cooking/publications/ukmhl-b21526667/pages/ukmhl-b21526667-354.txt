Take three gills of Lisbon wine, a gill of water, a stick of cinnamon, a bit of lemon peel, a small quan- tity of the juice, and a few coriander seeds ; sweeten well with lump sugar, and boil all together for ten minutes.

N.B. The same kind of cream may be put over cod- 1ms, gooseberries, or cranberries, when made into pies, only omitting the pippins. STEWED PEARS. Pare and halve, or quarter, large pears, according to their size ; throw them into water, as the skin is taken off before they are divided, to prevent their turning black. Pack them round a block-tin stew- pan, and sprinkle as much sugar over as will make them pretty sweet, and add lemon-peel, a clove or two, and some allspice cracked; just cover them with water, and put some of the red liquor as directed in another article. Cover them close, and stew three or four hours ; when tender, take them out, and pour the liquor over them.

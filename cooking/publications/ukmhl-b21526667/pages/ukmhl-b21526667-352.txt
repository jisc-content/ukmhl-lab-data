DOMESTIC COOKERY. 304 CRANBERRY JELLY. Make a very strong isinglass jelly. When cold, mix it with a double quantity of cranberry juice pressed as directed in a subsequent page, sweeten and boil it up; then strain it into a shape. The sugar must be good loaf, or the jelly will not be clear. STRAWBERRY JELLY. Boil two ounces of isinglass in a quarter of a pint of water till dissolved, skimming it all the time; then strain and let it cool. Mash a quart of fresh fruit in an earthen vessel, with a wooden spoon ; add pow- dered sugar and a very little water. Pass it through a jelly bag, stir the melted isinglass into it, and fill your mould. Raspberry and red currant jelly must be made in the same way. CRANBERRY AND RICE JELLY. Boil and press the fruit, strain the juice, and by degrees mix into it as much ground rice as will, when boiled, thicken to a jelly; boil it gently, stirring it, and sweeten to your taste. Put it in a basin or form, and serve to eat as the afore-directed jelly, with milk or cream. APPLE JELLY TO SERVE AT TABLE. Prepare twenty golden pippins; boil them in a pint and a half of water from a spring, till quite tender; then strain the liquor through a colander.

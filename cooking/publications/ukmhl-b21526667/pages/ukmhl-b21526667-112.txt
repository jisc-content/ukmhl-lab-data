DOMESTIC COOKERY. C6 VENISON. TO KEEP VENISON. Preserve the venison dry, wash it with milk and water very clean, and dry it with clean cloths till not the least damp remains; then dust-pounded ginger over every part, which is a good preventative against the fly. By thus managing and watching, it will hang a fortnight. When to be used, wash it with a little luke-warm water, and dry it. Pepper is likewise good to keep it. TO DRESS VENISON. A haunch of buck will take three hours and a half or three quarters roasting: doe, only three hours and a quarter. Venison should be rather over than under- done. Spread a sheet of white paper with butter, and put it over the fat, first sprinkling it with a little salt; then lay a coarse paste on strong paper, and cover the haunch; tie it with fine pack-thread, and set it at a distance from the fire, which must be a good one. Baste it often; ten minutes before serving take off the paste, draw the meat nearer the fire, and baste it with butter and a good deal of flour to make it froth up well. Gravy for it should be put into a boat, and not into the dish (unless there is none in the venison), and made thus :â€”Cut off the fat from two or three pounds of a loin of old mutton, and set it in steaks on a grid- iron for a few minutes just to brown one side 5 put them into a sauce-pan with a quart of water, cover quite close for an hour, and simmer it gently; then uncover it, and stew till the gravy is reduced to a pint. Season with only salt. Currant-jelly must be served in a boat. Formerly pap-sauce was eaten with venison ; which, as some still like it, it may be necessary to direct. Grate white bread, and boil it with port wine, water, and a large stick of cinnamon ; and when quite smooth take out the cinnamon and add sugar. Claret may be used for it.

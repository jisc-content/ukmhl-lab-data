POULTRY-YARD. 405 care is taken to keep the tame delicately clean. The tame one brings forth every month, and must be al- lowed to go with the buck as soon as she has kindled.

If not very well attended, their stench will destroy themselves, and be very un- wholesome to all who live near them; but attention will prevent this inconvenience.

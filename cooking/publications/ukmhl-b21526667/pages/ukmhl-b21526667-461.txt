Another.—Boil up half a pint of fine gruel with a bit of butter the size of a large nutmeg, a large spoon- ful of brandy, the same of white wine, one of capil- laire, a bit of lemon-peel and nutmeg. Another.—Into a pint of fine gruel not thick, put, when it is boiling hot, the yolk of an egg beaten with sugar, and mixed with a large spoonful of cold water, a glass of wine, and nutmeg. Mix by degrees. It is very agreeable and nourishing. Some like gruel, with a glass of table beer, sugar, &c., with or without a tea-spoonful of brandy. COLD CAUDLE. Boil a quart of spring-water j when cold, add the yolk of an egg, the juice of a small lemon, six spoons- ful of sweet wine, sugar to your taste, and syrup of lemons one ounce. % A FLOUR CAUDLE. Into five large spoonsful of the purest water rub smooth one desert spoonful of fine flour. Set over the fire five spoonsful of new milk, and put two bits of sugar into it; the moment it boils, pour into it the flour and water; and stir it over a slow fire twenty minutes. It is a nourishing and gently astringent food. This is an excellent food for babies who have weak bowels. 2 n 3

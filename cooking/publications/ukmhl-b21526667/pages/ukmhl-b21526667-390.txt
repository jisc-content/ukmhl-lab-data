DOMESTIC COOKERY. 343 be scalded, and so on till all be finished. Observe not to put one quantity on another, or they will be- come too soft. The next day pick out any bad or broken ones, bottle the rest, and fill up the bottles with the alum water in which they were scalded ; which must be kept in the bottles ; for, if left in the kettle, or in a glazed pan, it will spoil. Stop them close. The water must boil all the time the process is carrying on. Gooseberries done in this way make as fine tarts as fresh off the trees. Another way.—In dry weather pick the gooseberries that are full grown, but not ripe ; top and tail them, and put into open-moulhed bottles; gently cork them with new velvet corks; put them in the oven when the bread is drawn, and let them stand till shrunk a quarter part; take them out of the oven, and imme- diately beat the corks in tight, cut off the tops, and rosin down close; set them in a dry place; and if well secured from air they will keep the year round. If gathered in the damp, or the gooseberries’ skins are the least cut in taking off the stalks and buds, they will mould. The hairy sort only must be used for keeping, and must be done before the seeds become large. Currants and damsons may be done the same way. GOOSEBERRY JAM FOR TARTS. Put twelve pounds of the red hairy gooseberries, when ripe and gathered in dry weather, into a pre- serving-pan, with a pint of currant-juice, drawn as for jelly ; let them boil pretty quick, and beat them with the spoon ; when they begin to break, put to them six pounds of pure white Lisbon sugar, and simmer slowly to a jam. It requires long boiling, or it will not keep ; but is an excellent and reasonable thing for tarts or puffs. Look at it in two or three days, and, if the syrup and fruit separate, the whole must be boiled longer. Be careful it does not burn to the bottom.

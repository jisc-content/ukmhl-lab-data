147 GAME. TO KEEP GAME, &C. Game ought not to be thrown away even when it has been kept a very long time; for when it seems to be spoiled it may often be made lit for eating, by nicely cleaning it, and washing with vinegar and water. If there is danger of birds not keeping, draw, crop, and pick them; then wash in two or three waters, and rub them with salt. Have ready a large sauce-pan of boiling water, and plunge them into it one by one; drawing them up and down by the legs, that the water may pass through them. Lay them stay five or six minutes in; then hang them up in a cold place. When drained, pepper and salt the inside well. Before roasting, wash them well. The most delicate birds, even grouse, may be pre- served thus. Those that live by suction cannot be done this way, as they are never drawn : and perhaps the heat might make them worse, as the water could not pass through them ; but they bear being high. Lumps of charcoal put about birds and meat will preserve them from taint, and restore what is spoiling. pheasants and partridges. Roast them as turkey : and serve with a fine gravy (into which put a very small bit of garlic), and bread- sauce. When cold, they may be made into excellent patties, but their flavour should not be overpowered by lemon. to pot partridge. Clean them nicely ; and season with mace, allspice, white pepper, and salt, in fine powder. Rub every part well ; then lay the breasts downwards in a pan, and pack the birds as close as you possibly can. Put a good deal of butter on them ; then cover the pan with a coarse flour-paste and a paper over, tie it close, and bake. When cold, put the birds into pots, and cover them with butter. o 2

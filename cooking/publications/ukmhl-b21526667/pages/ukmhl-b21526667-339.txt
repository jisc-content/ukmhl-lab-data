SWEET DISHES. ‘2.91 2 c 2 of half a lemon grated fine ; and to botli as much sugar as will be pleasant. Mix half a pint of milk, half a pint of cream, and the yolk of one egg; give it a scald over the fire, and stir it all the time; don’t let it boil; add a little sugar only, and let it grow cold. Lay it over the apples with a spoon; and then put on it a whip made the day before, as for other Trifle. CHANTII.LY CAKE, OR CAKE TRIFLE. Bake a rice cake in a mould. When cold, cut it round about two inches from the edge with a sharp knife, taking care not to perforate the bottom. Put in a thick custard, and some tea-spoonsful of rasp- berry jam, and then put on a whip. CHANTILLY BASKET. A small quantity of warm clarified sugar boiled to a caramel height, dip ratafia cakes into it, and place them round the inside of a dish. Then cut more cakes into squares, dip them into sugar, pile them on the others, and line the inside with wafer paper, fill with sponge biscuits, sweetmeats, blanched almonds, and cream as for apple pie, put some trifle froth over that, and garnish it with rose leaves, or coloured comfits. GOOSEBERRY FOOL. Put the fruit into a stone jar, and some good Lisbon sugar ; set the jar on a stove, or in a sauce-pan of water over the fire; if the former, a large spoonful of water should be added to the fruit. When it is done enough to pulp, press it through a colander; have ready a sufficient quantity of new milk, and a tea-cup of raw cream, boiled together ; or an egg instead of the latter, and left to be cold ; then sweeten it pretty well with fine Lisbon sugar, and mix the pulp by degrees with it.

DIRECTIONS FOR CARVING. 31 wings. When the skewers are taken out, and the bird served, the following is the way to carve it: Fix your fork in the centre of the breast ; slice it down in the lines a, b; take off the leg on one side in the dotted line b, d; then cut off the wing on the same side, in the line c, d. Separate the leg and wing on the other side, and then cut off the slices of breast you divided before. Be careful how you take off the wings; for if you should cut too near the neck as at g, you will hit on the neck-bone, from which the wing must be separated. Cut off the merrythought in the line f, g, by passing the knife under it towards the neck. Cut the other parts as in a fowl. The breast, wings, and merrythought, are the most esteemed : but 4 • * the leg has a higher flavour. Partridge.—The partridge is here represented as just taken from the spit; but before it is served up, the skewers must be withdrawn. It is cut up ig the same manner as a fowl. The wings must be taken off in the lines a, b, and the merrythought in the line c, d. The prime parts of a partridge are the wings, breast, and merrythought. But the bird being small, the two latter are not often divided. The wing is considered as the best, and the tip of it reckoned the most delicate morsel of the whole. Pigeons.—Cut them in half, either from top to bottom or across. The lower part is generally thought the best; but the fairest way is to cut from the neck to a, figure 7, rather than from c to b, by a, which is the most fashionable. The figure represents the back of the pigeon ; and the direction of the knife is in the line c, b, by a, if done the last way.

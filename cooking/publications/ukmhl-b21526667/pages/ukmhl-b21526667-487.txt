439 DIRECTIONS TO SERVANTS. serve to clean the plate, and are the very best things to clean the brass locks and finger plates of doors. When the plate is quite dry it must be rubbed bright with leather. This is a very nice mode. In many plate-powders there is a mixture of quicksilver, which is very injurious; and, among other disadvantages, it makes silver so brittle, that from a fall it will break. TO CLEAN LOOKING-GLASSES. Remove the fly-stains, and other soil, by a damp rag j then polish with woolen cloth and powder blue. TO PRESERVE GILDING AND CLEAN IT. It is not possible to prevent flies from staining the gilding without covering it; before which, blow off the light dust, and pass a feather or clean brush over it; then with strips of paper cover the frames of your glasses, and donâ€™t remove it till the flies are gone. Linen takes off the gilding, and deadens its bright- ness ; it should therefore never be used for wiping it. Some means should be used to destroy the flies, as they injure furniture of every kind, and the paper likewise. Bottles hung about with sugar and vinegar, or beer, will attract them ; or fly-water put into little shells placed about the room, but out of the reach of children. TO CLEAN PAINT. Never use a cloth, but take off the dust with a little long-haired brush, after blowing off the loose part with the bellows. With care, paint will look well for a length of time. When soiled, dip a sponge or a bit of flannel into soda and water, wash it off quickly, and dry immediately, or the strength of the soda will eat off the colour.

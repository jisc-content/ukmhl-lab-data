Put a cup of water in the dish, and, if you have any ham in the house, lay a bit on each pigeon : it is a great improvement to the flavour. Observe, when ham is cut for gravy or pies, to take the under part rather than the prime. Season the gizzards, and two joints of the wings, and put them in the centre of the pie; and over them, in a hole made in the crust, three feet nicely cleaned, to show what pie it is. MOORFOWL PIE. Make it the same as pigeon pie, If beef steaks be used, there should be plenty of butter, rolled in flour. It must not be over baked. When done, it may be enriched by a hot sauce of melted butter, lemon- juice, and a glass of claret, poured in. PARTRIDGE PIE IN A DISII. Pick and singe four partridges ; cut off the legs at the knee; season with pepper, salt, chopped parsley, thyme, and mushrooms. Lay a veal-steak, and a slice of ham, at the bottom of the dish ; put the par- tridge in, and half a pint of good broth. Put puff paste on the ledge of the dish, and cover with the same ; brush it over with egg, and bake an hour. WOODCOCK PIE. Bone three birds, fill them with light forcemeat, with the entrails and some green truffles pounded in it; put them into a deep dish with a little force- meat round; cover with puff paste; egg and orna- ment the top, and when three parts baked, add to the birds a sauce made with the liquor of the bones of the woodcocks reduced almost to a glaize ; then add it to a gill of cullis, half a gill of Madeira wine; season to the palate with cayenne pepper and lemon juice.

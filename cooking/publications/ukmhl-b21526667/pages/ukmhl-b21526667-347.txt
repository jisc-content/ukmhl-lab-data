SWEET DISHES. ci99 quarters of a pint of new milk ; stir it well; then add a quarter of a pint of spinach juice ; set it over a gentle stove, and stir it one way constantly till it is as thick as a hasty pudding. Put into a custard-dish some Naples biscuits, or preserved orange, in long slices, and pour the mixture over them. It is to be 'eaten cold ; and is a dish either for supper, or for a second course. PISTACHIO CREAM. Blanch four ounces of Pistachio nuts ; beat them fine with a little rose-water, and add the paste to a pint of cream ; sweeten ; let it just boil, and put it into glasses. RHENISH CREAM. Dissolve an ounce of isinglass in a pint of hot water, and let it stand till cold; stir in it till all be well mixed the yolks of five eggs, the juice of three lemons, the peels of two ditto, half a pint of white wine, and half a pound of white sugar. Let all boil gently till thick enough to put into moulds. CLOUTED CREAM. String four blades of mace on a thread; put them to a gill of new milk, and six spoonsful of rose-water; simmer a few minutes ; then by degrees stir this liquor strained into the yolks of two new eggs well beaten. Stir the whole into a quart of very good cream, and set it over the fire ; stir it till hot, but not boiling hot; pour it into a deep dish, and let it stand twenty-four hours. Serve it in a cream dish, to eat with fruits. Many prefer it without any flavour but that of the cream ; in which case use a quart of new milk and the cream, or do it as the Devonshire scalded cream.

It is better to make only a small quan- tity of the paste at a time as it does not keep well. SAVOURY PIES. [fruit pies will be placed under the head pastry. OBSERVATIONS ON SAVOURY PIES. There are few articles of cookery more generally liked than relishing pies, if properly made; and they may be made so of a great variety of things. Some are best eaten when cold, and, in that case, there should be no suet put into the forcemeat that is used with them. If the pie is either made of meat that will take more dressing, to make it extremely tender, than the baking of the crust will allow; or if it is to be served in an earthen pie form ; observe the follow- ing preparation : Take three pounds of the veiny piece of beef (for instance) that has fat and lean ; wash it; and season it with salt, pepper, mace, and allspice, in fine powder, rubbing them well in. Set it by the side of a slow fire, in a stew-pot that will just hold it.; put to it a piece of butter, of about the weight of two ounces, and cover it quite close; let it just simmer in its own steam till it begins to shrink. When it is cold, add more seasoning, forcemeat, and eggs , and, if it is in a dish, put some gravy to it before baking; but if it is only in crust, don't put the gravy till after it is cold and in jelly, as has been described in page 177. Forcemeat may be put both under and over the meat, if preferred to balls.

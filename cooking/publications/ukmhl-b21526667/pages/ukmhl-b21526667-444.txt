t 39^ DOMESTIC COOKEIIY. sour, is also as good as cream to eat with fruit, if sweetened with white sugar, and mixed with a very little milk. It likewise does equally for cakes and riee-puddings, and of course it is economical to churn before the cream is too stale for any thing but to feed pigs. TO KEEP MICK AND CREAM. In hot weather, when it is difficult to preserve milk from becoming sour, and spoiling the cream it may be kept perfectly sweet by scalding the new milk very gently, without boiling, and setting it by in the earthen dish, or pan, that it is done in. This method is pur- sued in Devonshire, and for butter, and eating, would equally answer in small quantities for coffee, tea, &c. Cream already skimmed may be kept twenty-four hours if scalded without sugar ; and by adding to it as much powdered lump-sugar as shall make it pretty sweet, will be good two days, keeping it in a cool place. SYRUP OF CREAM, May be preserved as above in the proportion of a pound and a quarter of sugar to a pint of perfectly fresh cream ; keep it in a cool place two or three hours ; then put it in one or two ounce phials, and cork it close. It will keep good thus for several weeks, and will be found very useful on voyages. GALLING CURDS AND WIIEY, AS IN ITALY. Take a number of the rough coats that line the giz- zards of turkeys and fowls ; clean them from the pebbles they contain; rub them well with salt, and hang them to dry. This makes a more tender and delicate curd than common rennet. When to be used, break off some bits of the skin, and put on it some boiling water: in eight or nine hours use the liquor as you do other rennet.

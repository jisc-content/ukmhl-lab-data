^^2 C(ydRERY and Pastry. BILLS 6 peaches; brulfe them in the mortar ; take the thin parings of a dozen of le- mons and fix oranges; bruife an ounce of coriander feed; break half an ounce of cinnamon in fmall bits, and take twenty whole cloves ; mix all thefe ma- terials wdth the brandy. You may let them ftand a month or fix weeks, flir- ring them often; put it through afearce, and take a pound and a half of fine fu- gar ; clarify it, and mix it with the fpirits ; then bottle it; put the corks loofe in, and let it ftand until it is quite fine; pour it from the grounds into o- ther bottles. You may filter the grounds through a paper or cotton in a filler. As we have not many of thefe fruits, bitter almonds will fupply their place ; but take only the half of the cfuantity, and donâ€™t bruife them, but cut them fmall with a knife. You may put on a pint of good whilky on the materials, and put a good piece of fugar in it. It is a good ieafoning for puddings, or a common dram.

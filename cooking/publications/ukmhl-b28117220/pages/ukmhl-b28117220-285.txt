Cut in narrow strips. SHRIMP AND LOBSTER SANDWICH. One can meat chopped fine, equal part celery chopped fine, one teaspoon vinegar, and pepper and salt to taste. When ready to serve, mix with one very small cup of stiff mayon- naise. Have your bread well buttered, put in a leaf of lettuce and spread with mixture. This portion makes thirty-six sand- wiches. Elizabeth Kerckhoff. WALNUT SANDWICH. Shell half a pound of English walnuts. Put the kernels into a pint of boiling water; boil for a minute; drain, and cover with stock; add a bay leaf, a few celery tops and a slice of onion. Cook gently for twenty minutes, drain and skim; chop fine, add half a teaspoonful of salt and a dash of cayenne or paprika. Spread between thin slices of buttered bread. These are very nice served with lobster a la Newberg. WALNUT SANDWICH. Put nuts through a meat grinder, or chop them very fine; mix with salad dressing sufficient to make a paste. Spread on buttered bread. Peanuts may be used in the same way. Mrs. George Sinsabaugh.

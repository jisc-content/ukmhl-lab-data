232 Mrs. S. T. Rorer. landmarks club cook book. PEPPERMINTS. One pound of sugar, nine tablespoons of water. Boil from six to eight minutes. A pinch of cream of tartar when taken from the stove, with half a teaspoon of the oil of peppermint, or less if that is too strong. Beat until it is a creamy white and drop with a teaspoon upon a clean, bright tin sheet. POP CORN BALLS. Four cups New Orleans molasses, butter size of a walnut. Boil until it strings or settles in cold water, then add little baking soda and stir. Take off and mix with even dishpanful popcorn thoroughly. Grease hands and make into balls, wrap- ping each with waxed paper. Evelyn R. Lutz. CANDIED VIOLETS. Select the desired quantity of perfect sweet violets, spread them on an inverted sieve, and stand in the air until slightly dried, but not crisp. Make a syrup from a half pound gran- ulated sugar and a half pint of water, boil until it spins a thread; then take each violet by the stem, dip down into the hot syrup, put back on the inverted sieve, which should be slightly oiled, and stand aside for several hours. If the vio- lets then look preserved and clear, they will not require a second dipping, but if they look dry, as though a part of the leaves were not saturated with the syrup, dip them a second time. Then melt a half cup of fondant, add two drops of essence of violet and sufficient water, drop at a time to give the fondant a thin, grayish color; then dip the violets into this one at a time, dust with sifted crystallized sugar (or granu- lated sugar) and place on oiled paper to harden. Mrs. S. T. Rorer. CANDIED ROSE LEAVES. Proceed precisely the same as for candied violets, using a fine wire to lift the leaves in and out the syrup. The fondant must be flavored with drops of essence of rose, and colored with two drops cochineal.

235 FOR THE PICNIC PUNCHEON. been upon the ice an hour or more are an addition to this filling. Good sandwiches can be made from all kinds of sal- ads, and their name is legion. VEAL LOAF. Take three pounds of veal and one-half pound of smoked ham. Put through a meat chopper, carefully removing all shreds. Add one cup bread crumbs, half cup butter, two beaten eggs, a little salt and a teaspoon of good mixed sea- soning. Mold in loaf and bake two hours, basting as soon as there is sufficient liquid in the pan to do so. Florence Collins Porter. SANDWICHES. For winter sandwiches use chicken, tongue, ham, beef, mut- ton, duck, celery, caviar. For summer, cherries, pineapple and plums blend. Fruits should be chopped. The sandwiches may be cut in different shapes with an ordinary biscuit cutter, any style of crescent, which may be halved; the plain rounds may be halved or quartered. Plain finger shapes are always popular, and good sized squares are probably best of all for hungry picnickers. CHEESE AND NUT SANDWICH. A can of soft, rich cheese that you can mash walnuts in. Stir them well together (having chopped the walnuts) and spread between thin slices of bread a day old. Very nice. Mrs. E. C. Bangs, Pasadena. CHEESE SANDWICH. Grate desired amount of cream cheese, add a dash of cay- enne pepper and soften with a little melted butter. Spread rather thin between thin slices of buttered bread. Mrs. George Sinsabaugh. CHICKEN SANDWICH. Chop cold, cooked chicken very fine. Pound until smooth, adding gradually enough thick, sweet cream to make a paste. To each pint add a teaspoonful of salt, a dash of pepper, a teaspoonful of onion and a tablespoonful of lemon juice. Spread between thin slices of buttered bread. m;

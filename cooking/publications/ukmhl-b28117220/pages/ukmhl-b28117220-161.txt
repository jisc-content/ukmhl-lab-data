113 vegetables. STUFFED TO MATOS, BAKED. Choose large tomatos. Do not skin them but scoop out a small place at the top which fill with bread crumbs, minced on- ion, cayenne and salt. First fry the onions in a little butter, add the bread crumbs moistened with a little water, and sea- soned with a very little cayenne pepper and enough salt. Fill the cavities allowing the stuffing to project half an inch above the tomato and smooth it over the top. Bake. Miss Bessie Bonsall. TOMATO SOUFFLE. Take one-half pint tomato pulp that has been rubbed through a sieve; one ounce butter, two ounces grated cheese, one and a half ounce boiled macaroni, one ounce bread crumbs, one tea- spoonful made mustard; mix all together in a saucepan and stir over the fire until boiling; take from the fire, let cool; add first the yolks of two eggs and then the whites of three, with oven to bake quickly. Draw over with grated Parmesan cheese. Marie N. Griffith.

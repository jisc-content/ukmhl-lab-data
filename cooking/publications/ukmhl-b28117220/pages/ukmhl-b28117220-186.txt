CHAPTER XIII. PASTRY. If pastry is to be served, have it of the bestâ€”light, flaky and tender. To pastry belongs, first, puff paste; second, plain paste. Puff paste, which to many seems so difficult of preparation, is rarely attempted by any except professionals. As a matter of fact, one who has never handled a rolling pin is less likely to fail, under the guidance of a good teacher, than an old cook, who finds it difficult to overcome the bad habit of using too much force in rolling. It is necessary to work rapidly and with a light touch. A cold room is of great advantage. For making pastry, pastry flour and the best shortenings, thoroughly chilled, are essential. Its lightness depends on the amount of air enclosed and expansion of that air in bak- ing. The flakiness depends on the kind and amount of short- ening used. Lard makes more tender crust than butter, but lacks flavor which butter gives. Puff paste is usually short- ened with butter, though some chefs prefer beef suet. Butter should be washed if pastry is to be of the best, so as to remove salt and buttermilk, thus making it of a waxy con- sistency, easy to handle. Rules for washing butter. Scald and chill an earthen bowl. Heat palms of hands in hot water, and chill in cold water. By following these directions butter will not adhere to bowl nor hands. Wash butter in bowl by squeezing with hands until soft and waxy, placing bowl under a cold water faucet and allowing water to run. A small amount of butter may be washed by using a wooden spoon in place of the hands. PUFF PASTE. One pound butter, one pound pastry flour, cold water. Wash the butter, pat and fold until no water flies. Reserve two tablespoons of butter and shape remainder into a circular piece one-half inch thick, and put on floured board. Work two ta- blespoons of butter into flour with the tips of fingers of the

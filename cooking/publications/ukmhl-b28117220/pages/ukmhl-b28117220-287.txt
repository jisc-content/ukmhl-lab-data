INVALID COOKERY. 239 BARLEY BROTH. Wash well a cup of pearl barley; pour over it a quart of water and let boil until the barley is quite soft. Strain off the water, salt and give to the patient several times a day. Carrie T. Waddilovb. BARLEY WATER. A teacup of pearl barley to two quarts water; boil in a double porcelain boiler two and a half hours; add one cup table raisins an hour before you remove from stove. It will look milky and thick. Squeeze the juice of three lemons in a pitcher, sweeten and salt to taste; strain the hot barley wa- ter over the lemon ; pick out the raisins to add with the liquor. Throw barley away. Very acceptable to a fever patient. Mrs. Mossin. CURRANT ICE WATER. Press the juice from ripe currants, strain, add a pound of sugar to every pint of juice. The sugar may be dissolved either by stirring it in the juice in a saucepan over the fire, or putting it in bottles, setting them over the fire in a sauce- pan of cold water, allowing them to become gradually heated to a boiling point. When cold they should be taken out, corked, sealed, and put in a cool, dry place. Mix with ice water or Shasta water for a beverage. The juice of other acid fruits may be preserved in the same manner. FLOUR GRUEL. Put one pint milk on fire in double boiler. Mix one gill of cold water with one tablespoon flour, and add to the boil- ing milk. Cook twenty minutes, season with scant half tea- spoon salt; strain and serve hot. If this is desired more nu- tritious, add half cup raisins, and a grating of nutmeg if pa- tient desires. Mrs. Mossin. OATMEAL GEflJEL. â€¢ Sprinkle one generous tablespoon of oatmeal with one quart boiling water; set where it will simmer two hours. Add salt, scant half teaspoon. Strain as hot as may be best for pa- tient. Fill a delicate cup half full of gruel; add half or quar- ter cup cream or milk. Mrs. Mossjn.

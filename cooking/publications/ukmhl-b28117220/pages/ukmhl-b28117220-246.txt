Wipe the rhubarb until clean and dry, and cut into fine pieces without peeling. Peel six oranges; cut away the white under- skin ; take out the seeds and divide the oranges into quarters. Open each carpel that holds the pulp and take out that, being careful to save all the juice. Put the rhubarb, orange pulp and juice with il/2 pounds of granulated sugar. Stir until the sugar is melted; then cook slowly, until a fine mass. Put away in tumblers and cover with oiled or waxed paper. A very good jam of the rhubarb is also made without the oranges. Use one pound sugar to each pound of fruit, and flavor each pound with the grated yellow rind of .half a large lemon. Stii and skim frequently while cooking. MRS. W. S. Cross.

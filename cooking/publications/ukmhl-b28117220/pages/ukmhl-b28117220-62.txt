LANDMARKS CLUB COOK BOOK. LECHE DE PINA (MEXICO). (Pineapple Milk) : Six pints of milk, the yolks of six eggs, six ounces of pounded almonds, one pineapple. Sweeten the milk to taste and beat it into the yolks; strain and put on the fire. When it has boiled, add the pounded almonds and let it cook, then mix in the pineapple, previously mashed, and boil until it is thick, and remove from the fire. It should be quite thick, but not enough to cut into squares, and must also be eaten with a spoon or fork. It makes a dainty dessert. OTHER SPANISH-AMERICAN RECIPES. CALABACITOS CON CHILE VERDE. Half pound salt pork, two summer squash, one can of corn or the same amount of green corn cut from the cob, two onions, six green peppers. Fry onions and salt pork together, then add the vegetables and enough water to cook well. It should cook down very dry when done so that a little cream may be added before serving. Miss H.

CHAPTER IX. VEGETABLES. All vegetables except potatos, asparagus, peas, and cauli- flower should boil as fast as possible; these four only moder- ately. To prevent the bad odor arising from boiling cabbage, put it in plenty of boiling water, add a pinch of soda, cover closely, boil fast; keep boiling for half an hour, no longer. Onions should be boiled in milk and waterâ€”equal parts. Potatos should be pared before being boiled, if you wish to have them mashed and look white. Pour off the water the min- ute they are done and stand on the back of the stove covered with a napkin. Sweet potatos should not be pared, and they require longer cooking than the common potato. Potatos are good with all meats. Turnips, beets, cabbage, cauliflower, and greens are eaten with boiled meats. Mashed turnip, onion, and apple sauce, with roast pork.

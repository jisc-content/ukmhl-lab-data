CAKE. 165 over a rich golden brown; and in the last quarter it should settle a little; brown in the cracks, and shrink from the pan. Be careful not to take it out too soon. If necessary to move it, do it very gently, and never move it when it has risen to the full height, but is not yet browned or fixed in its shape. If cake brown before rising, the oven is too hot. When it rises more in the center, cracks open, and stays up, it is too stiff with flour. It should rise first on the edges, then in the middle, crack slightly, settle to a level again, when the cracks usually come together. Mrs. Lincolnâ€™s Boston Cook Book. TEST FOR OVEN. The following test for heating the oven is given by Miss Parloa: Put in a piece of white paper. If at the end of five minutes the paper is a rich yellow color, the oven is right for sponge cake; if light yellow, it is too cool; if dark brown, it is too hot. For pound or butter cakes it should be light yel- low at the end of five minutes. For gingerbreads and thin rolled cakes it should be dark brown. CELIA THAXTER CAKE.

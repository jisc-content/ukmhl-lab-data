Put a little sweet oil and butter into a frying pan; when good and hot, put in a slice of mashed garlic, not chopped; let it remain in until brown, so as to flavor the oil and butter, then remove it and add some chopped tomatos. When cooked, add well beaten eggs, with a little pinch of pepper (no salt), a little of the grated Parmesan cheese, and stir constantly for about two minutes. Serve immediately. Louise Guasti.

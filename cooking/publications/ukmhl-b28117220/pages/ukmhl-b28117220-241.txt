CHAPTER XVII. FRUITS, JELLIES, ETC. PRESERVES. General Directions. Skim off all scum as it rises. It is considered best, in jams and jellies, to boil and reduce them some before the sugar is added. Do not use a tin or iron spoon to stir jelly. By tak- ing out a spoonful in a saucer and setting it in cold water, the state of the jelly can easily be found out. Tin pans alter the color of any fruit. DIRECTIONS FOR CANNING FRUIT. Cook Sugar Fruit Water Cherries 5 minutes 6 ounces I quart i cup Raspberries 6 minutes 4 ounces 1 quart 1 cup Blackberries 6 minutes 6 ounces 1 quart 1 cup Strawberries 8 minutes 8 ounces 1 quart 1 cup Plums 10 minutes 10 ounces 1 quart 1 cup Bartlett Pears 20 minutes 6 ounces 1 quart 1 cup Peaches 8 minutes 4 ounces 1 quart 1 cup Boil full amount of sugar and water. Drop a portion of the fruit into the boiling syrup. When cooked the necessary time, dip out with a strainer and put into the hot jars. Repeat this process until all the fruit is cooked, then cover the fruit in the jars with the rich syrup and seal at once. Berries cooked this way will keep for years. Mrs. Dora A. Macneil. APPLE JELLY. Halve and quarter nice, large green apples. Take out the cores, wash and put them in a preserving kettle, with water enough to cover well. Let them boil until quite tender; take off and drain first through a colander, then a jelly bag. To every cup of juice add one cup of sugar. Let the juice come to a boil before putting in the sugar. Will jell in a few min- utes. Mrs. J. B. Duke.

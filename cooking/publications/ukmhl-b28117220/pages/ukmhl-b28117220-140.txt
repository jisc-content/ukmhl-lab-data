Mrs. J. G. Mossin. WHITE SAUCE. Put in a saucepan a lump of very fresh butter. When it is melted but not warm, stir in briskly the same volume of flour, one heaping spoonful of each making about one and a half pints of sauce. Slowly add in some tepid water, turning briskly on a very slow fire. When the sauce is perfectly smooth and thick, after ten minutesâ€™ cooking, salt and pepper it; take off from the fire and pour it slowly in a bowl containing a yellow of egg, raw, and a little vinegar, beating all the time. The sauce is then ready to serve. It is good with asparagus, arti- chokes, fish, etc. Marthe Durnerin. WHITE SAUCE. One cup milk, hot, one tablespoon of butter, one tablespoon of flour. Butter should be melted and bubbling before adding flour. Put in the flour all at once, stir smooth, add the hot milk slowly, allowing the sauce to boil up once between each ad- dition of milk. When done, add half teaspoonful salt, one- quarter teaspoonful pepper. Mbs. George H. Wadleigh.

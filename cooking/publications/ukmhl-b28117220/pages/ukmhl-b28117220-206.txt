Whip a pint of cream stiff. Then whip the prunes into this. Line a dish with sponge cake and fill the center with the prune cream. Set in ice box till ready to serve. Miss Ahbie McCrary, Sacramento. PRUNE WHIP. One-half pound prunes cooked very tender and sweetened; put through colander. Take whites of six eggs, beat very stiff; then beat in prunes gradually. Whip all together about five minutes; put in a mold and set in a cold place. This will keep several days, and is much nicer than the baked pudding. Serve with whipped cream unsweetened. Miss H. Knickerbocker. RASPBERRY SPONGE. Two boxes raspberries, two cups of sugar, juice of one lemon, one tablespoonful Knoxâ€™s gelatine, whites of three eggs. Wash and mash the berries, and put through a sieve; add the sugar and lemon juice. Soak the gelatine in a cup of water, and when dissolved pour into the mashed berries, and let it stand until it is as thick as jelly; then add the beaten whites and beat all together. Pour in a mold and place on ice. Mrs. Marion W. Stewart. ROSE CUSTARD. Milk two cups, eggs three cups, sugar half cud, raspbery juice half pint. Heat the milk to boiling.

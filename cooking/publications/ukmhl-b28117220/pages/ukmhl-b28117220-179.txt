ORANGE PUDDING FANCATELLI. Put the strained juice of ten oranges and the rind of three rubbed on lumps of sugar, into a basin with six ounces of bruised ratafias, six ounces of sugar, one pint of cream, ten yolks of eggs and six whites whipped. Add a pinch of salt and a little grated nutmeg. Work these ingredients together for five minutes with a whisk, and then pour the mixture into a pie dish already furnished with a thin border of puff paste around the rim, reaching half way to the bottom. Shake some bruised ratafias over the surface and set the pudding in a baking tin and bake for about half an hour, till it is light brown color. Phyllis Brown, England, 1879. ORANGE PUDDING.

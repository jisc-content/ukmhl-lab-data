LANDMARKS CLUB COOK BOOK. IV than a good concoction of chile. Green, it is chopped and fried with potatoes or meat or beans, to their great advan- tage. It is also used whole as a wrapper for stuffing of forced-meat, cheese, etc. When ripe, dried or fresh, it is ground up and cooked as the sauce of hundreds of dishes. Its “hotness” can easily be regulated without destroying its flavor, by soaking, by removing the seeds, by adding tomatoes, and so on. In any shape it is palatable, and in almost every shape beneficial to the system though some few people find the green chiles, particularly when un- cooked, too laxative. It is really a necessity of the arid lands ; an unequaled stimulant to the liver, which tends in these climates to become torpid. A number of the most famous and typical dishes of old- time California, New Mexico, Mexico and Peru, are here printed—most of them for the first time in English. There is very little precise measuring done among these old- fashioned cooks—much depends upon the instinct and prac- tice of the chef. I myself—who learned to cook for myself on the frontiers, and to cook well—always take “some” of this and “some” of that, and have not made a very bad dish in a good many years. As with my grandmother’s doughnuts--the first things I assayed to cook in my early “baching it” in New Mexico—there had to be a sort of enlightened guess-work on my part. But after a few trials my doughnuts were as good as anyone’s. So with these Spanish-American dishes. Even if the precise proportions could be given, they might be “too rich” for a strange palate at first trial. A reasonable cook, with the following directions, can yery soon adjust proportions to personal taste. When that shall have been done, the family dietary will have been enriched by just so many new, agreeable and hygienic dishes.

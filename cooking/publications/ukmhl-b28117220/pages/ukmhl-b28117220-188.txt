Two cups of flour, half teaspoonful of baking powder, half teaspoonful of salt, one tablespoonful of sugar, one egg, three- quarters cup of butter (or butter and clarified fat), one tea- spoonful of lemon juice, enough ice cold water to form a stiff dough. Sift all the dry ingredients and rub in shortening. Beat up egg and water and add to the mixture until you get a stiff dough. Roll out on well floured board about one-sixth of an inch in thickness. Kate E. Whitaker. PLAIN PASTRY. The proportion commonly used is four cups flour to one and a half cups shortening (half butter, half lard), one level teaspoonful baking powder. About a coffeecupful of water will give the right consistency. This will make three pies. Two cups flour, scant half cup of shortening, pinch of salt, one-half teaspoonful baking powder, ice water to moisten. This amount will make one pie with two crusts. h. c. w. BERRY PIES. Line deep plates with paste, fill as full as possible with the fruit, dredge over a tablespoonful of flour and two of sugar. A little more flour and considerably more sugar for cherries or currants. Wet the edges of lower crust, press the top crust down very thoroughly. Bake about forty minutes. COCOANUT PIE. Two cups grated cocoanut, one cup sugar, one quart milk, six eggs, one pinch salt. Makes three pies, baked just like custard. Mrs. W. H. Workman. CREAM PIE. Three eggs (yolks), one pint of milk, one cup of sugar, two tablespoonfuls of cornstarch. Beat together sugar, yolks of eggs and cornstarch. After milk has come to a boil stir in the mixture. Add a pinch of salt and cook till thick. Take the whites of the three eggs, beat to a stiff froth with two tablespoonfuls of sugar. Bake the crust before putting in the mixture. Spread whites over top and brown. Miss Whitaker.

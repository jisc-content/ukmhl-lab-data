196 LANDMARKS CLUB COOK BOOK. FIG marmalade. Three pounds of figs, two oranges, two lemons, two pounds sugar. Use pulp of the oranges, pulp and rind of the lemons; chop altogether; cook twenty minutes. Add ginger root if de- sired. H. C. W. GREENGAGE JAM. To every pound of fruit (weighed before being stoned) al- low three-quarters pound of sugar. Divide the greengages, take out the stones and put them into preserving pan. Bring the fruit to a boil, then add the sugar and keep stirring it over a gentle fire until it is melted. Remove all the scum as it rises, and just before the jam is done boil rapidly for five min- utes. Have ready half the kernels, blanched; put them into the jam. Give them one boil and pour the preserves into pots. When cold, cover down with oiled paper, and over these tissue paper, brushed on both sides with the white of an egg. Time for boiling, three-quarters of an hour after the sugar is added. Mrs. William S. Cross. GUAVA PASTE. To about a quart of guavas (after they are put through the sieve) half teaspoonful allspice, one teaspoonful cloves, one teaspoonful cinnamon, quarter teaspoonful mace. Cook the guavas with just enough water to keen them from burning. Pass through a sieve; heat them and put in the same amount of sugar as guavas. Cook until quite thick. Stir to prevent burning. Just before the paste is ready to take from the stove add the spices. Mrs. H. T. Christian LEMON MARMALADE (SPANISH). Twenty fresh ripe lemons, six oranges, five quarts of water, ten pounds sugar.

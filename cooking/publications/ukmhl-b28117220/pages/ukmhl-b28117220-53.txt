Spanish-American cookery. 5 PAPAS CON AJI (PERU). (Peppered Potatos) : Boil potatos of the best quality, not too soft. Make a smother of the best red chile (Mexican pep- pers), much lard, fresh cheese chopped fine, a little chopped onion, and a little fine vinegar. Put this in a saucepan, put in the potatos whole, and stir well while cooking, about 20 min- utes. Add a little broth, that the sauce may not be too thick. CARNE EN ADQBO (PERU). ♦ (Meat in Pickle-sauce) : Cut into small lumps a good-sized piece of fresh pork, and put it to fry. When half fried, add chopped onion and plenty of ground red chile, stir well, add a little strong vinegar, and cook 15 minutes. MIG AS (PERU). Soak stale bread, squeeze the water out, put it in a smother with plenty of lard, ground chile, chopped onion and a pinch sweet marjoram; add plenty of fresh cheese crumbled up, and stir all constantly till well mixed, say ten minutes. Dress with stoned olives (ripe), crumbled fresh cheese and hard-boiled eggs chopped. Goat’s cheese is best for Migas. TAMAE SERRANO (PERU). (Mountaineer Tamales) : Corn-dough made in the same method as for Creole tamales, and wrappers prepared the same. Take ]/o lb. lard, the pieces of pork cooked in the broth with which the dough is wet up; onion chopped very fine, country sausage-meat, peeled roasted peanuts, a few grains of anise, stoned ripe olives and a little good sweet wine (sherry or port). Fry all this together well, and let cool off. Put corn- dough in the wrapper as before, and in the center put one of each of the things in the sauce—meat, olives, etc.—and a quan- tity of the sauce. Cover with dough, tie wrappers as before and boil three hours. GATO DE EIEBRE. (Hare Pie ) : This dish will have a curious sound to many ears; but it is fit for a king, and held in grateful remembrance by those who have ever eaten it cooked by an expert. Kven

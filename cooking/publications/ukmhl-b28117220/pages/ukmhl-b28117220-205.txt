Take two good sized oranges, remove the rind and slice thin in a glass dish, covering each layer thickly with sugar; then set in a cool place over night. In the morning take a quart of water and squeeze in the juice of two large lemons; strain; add a cup of sugar, then let it come to a boil, and stir in slowly four tablespoon fuls of cornstarch, previously moist- ened with water. Let it boil until clear like starch, then pour it over the oranges and set away to cool. Before serving for dinner, take the whites of two eggs and beat to a. stiff froth and sweeten with pulverized sugar and spread it over the top and place here and there a thin slice of red jelly. It must be served with table cream for sauce. Dr. Harriet Welch, San Francisco. ORANGES WITH TRANSPARENT JELLY. Half a dozen oranges; make a hole at the top with a circular tin cutter about half an inch in diameter. Remove all the pulp and loose pith with a small spoon. Soak the oranges in cold water for one hour; rinse in cold water and drain on a cloth. Put them in a deep pan and surround with ice. Fill three with bright, pink jelly, and the rest with white. When the jelly is firm, wipe the oranges and cut into quarters. Serve them on a glass stand. Mrs. Stephen M. White. PEACH CREAM. Mash one quart of ripe peaches; add half pint of sugar.

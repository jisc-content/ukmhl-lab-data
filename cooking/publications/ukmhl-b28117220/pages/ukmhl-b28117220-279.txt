CANDIES. 231 sugar. Place in a moderate oven from a half to three-quarters of an hour, then remove kisses with a sharp knife. Mrs. A. Haas. OLD FASHIONED MOLASSES CANDY. Tnto a kettle, holding at least four times the amount of mo- lasses to be used, pour a quantity of good Porto Rico molasses; place over the fire and boil slowly about half an hour, stirring constantly to diminish the quantity. If there is danger of its running over, remove to back of stove, or check the fire. Be careful not to let it burn, especially toward the close of its boiling. Drop a little in cold water; if brittle and will snap apart like a pipe-stem, add a small teaspoon of carbonate of soda to a quart of molasses. Stir quickly, and pour into greased pans to cool. As soon as cool enough to handle with- out burning the hands, pull. The more and faster it is pulled the lighter it will be in color. PEANUT BRITTLE. One cup granulated sugar, one cup chopped nuts. Mash or chop the peanuts or walnuts. Put the sugar in pan over the fire and stir until melted. When a liquid, stir in the peanuts quickly and pour on a tin sheet, spread out quite thin with a broad blade knife, dipped frequently into cold water. Cut into blocks. Pauline M. Lutz. PINOCHE. Four cups brown sugar, one tablespoon butter, one cup milk, one teaspoonful salt, two tablespoonfuls vanilla, two cups chopped walnuts. Boil the sugar, butter, salt and milk until it drops hard in cold water. When done, pour in the vanilla and walnuts and stir constantly until well mixed. Pour on a buttered plate and cut into squares. Charlotte Workman. PINOCHE. Three cups brown sugar, one cup white sugar, enough sweet milk to mix thoroughly.

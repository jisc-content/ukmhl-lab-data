Cut off the stem ends, remove the seeds with a large spoon, and stuff the peppers with any kind of minced cold meat, mixed with an equal quantity of stale bread moistened with cold water, and properly seasoned with salt. Replace the stems, set the peppers in a deep earthen dish or plate, pour in as much cold gravy as the dish will hold, and bake them in a moderate oven for half an hour. They may be stuffed with sausage meat and bread. Cheese may be grated and mixed with bread crumbs for stuffing peppers, and they should then be fried instead of being baked. Mrs. M. J. Connell.

CANDIES. 233 Mrs. J. P. Waterman. GRILLED PECANS. Blanch the nuts; one cup of sugar, half cup of water; boil for a few minutes; drop in the nuts and leave for ten min- utes ; remove from fire, stir till it thickens and clings to nuts. Spread on wax paper to cool. Mrs. Belle M. Jewett. SALTED ALMONDS. Blanch the almonds by pouring boiling water over them, let them stand a few minutes and drain. Do the same with cold water. Then remove the skins and dry them on a clean towel. The next day put them in a shallow pan, sprinkle liberally with salt, and put on pieces of butter as large as the end of a finger quite near together. Put in a hot oven. Watch them carefully, and when they begin to brown, shake them often until they are an even light brown. If too much salt is on them when done, place them in a clean towel and rub them. Mrs. J. H. Barbour. SALTED BRAZIL NUTS. To each cupful of blanched nuts add one teaspoon salad oil, let stand half an hour; one tablespoon of salt to each cup of nuts, pinch of cayenne pepper to each quantity of salt, well mixed with nuts. Put in oven till brown. Mrs. Belle M. Jewett. SALTED PEANUTS. Shell and blanch raw peanuts; cover with boiling water with a little salt and teaspoon butter to a quart.

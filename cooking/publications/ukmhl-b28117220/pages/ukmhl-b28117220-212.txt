CHAPTER XV], CAKE. GENERAL directions for making cake. Cake is a mixture of part or all of the following materials: Eggs, sugar or molasses, flour, butter or cream, milk or wa- ter, fruit, soda, cream of tartar, spices, etc. An analysis of the hundreds of receipts given in the books would show that the general principles involved may be included under two divisions, namely, receipts for sponge cakes, made without but- ter; and receipts for pound or cup cakes, made with butter. Sponge cakes are made rich with eggs, the lightness depend- ing wholly upon the amount of air beaten into the egg; or an inferior quality is made by substituting soda and cream of tartar (or baking powder) for part of the eggs, and adding- more flour and milk or water. They vary in color according as the white or yolk of the egg is used. Butter cakes are varied in the same way, and also by the addition of fruit, or spices, or various coloring and flavoring materials. There is no one department in cooking where so much de- pends upon the baking as in making cake. The fire should be steady and not too strong. In many coal stoves it is ex- ceedingly difficult to bake cake by a morning fire, as so much coal is put on that the fire is too hot, and cannot be checked sufficiently. The oven should be less hot than for bread. Thin cakes require a hotter oven than those baked in thick loaves. If the oven be not hot enough at first, or be cooled too sud- denly during the baking, the cake will not be light. Cakes with molasses in them burn more quickly than others. Thin cakes should bake from fifteen to twenty minutes; thicker cakes from thirty to forty minutes; very thick loaves about an hour, and fruit cake from two to three hours. Whichever kind you are baking, divide the time into quarters. During the first quarter the heat is not manifested in appearance, ex- cept by the rising; during the second the cake should con- tinue to rise and begin to brown; then it should become all

CHAPTER XXIII. INVALID COOKERY. ARROWROOT JELLY. One cup boiling- water, two heaping teaspoonfuls arrowroot, two teaspoonfuls white sugar, three tablespoonfuls blackberry cordial. Excellent for children with bowel trouble. Mrs. J. F. Conroy. APPLE WATER. One apple, one tablespoon sugar, one cup boiling water, one strip lemon peel. Wipe a large, sour apple and cut it with- out paring, into thin slices. Put them into a bowl with the lemon peel and boiling water; cover it, and let it stand till cold. Add the sugar, and when dissolved strain it. RHUBARB WATER. One small stalk rhubarb, one cup boiling water, one strip lemon peel, one tablespoon sugar. Wipe the rhubarb, cut into pieces an inch long. Add lemon peel and foiling water. Let it stand till cold. Add sugar, and when dissolved strain it. BEEF EXTRACT. Soak finely-chopped lean beef in an equal weight of cold water for an hour, then gradually raise to a boiling point Simmerâ€˜for fifteen minutes and strain. QUICK BEEF TEA. Take a round steak (always the best piece of meat for in- valids), cut into pieces the size of your hand. Have ready a cup in hot water. P>roil your steak quickly on both sides, turning quickly to retain the juice; broiling only enough to start the juice. Squeeze with a lemon squeezer the juice into the hot cup; add a little salt, and carry to the invalid with the cup still in hot water, to prevent coagulation. Mrs. J. F. Conroy.

CHAPTER XI. # CHEESE. CHEESE BALLS. One cup of grated cheese (old), whites of two eggs, beaten stiff. Mix cheese and whites; add a pinch of red pepper and a little salt. Make into balls as large as walnuts, roll in fine bread crumbs and fry in deep fat in a basket. Serve very hot. This makes about ten balls. Serve with this, lettuce and French dressing.

Shape in small balls, roll in cracker crumbs, dip them in the yolks of the eggs wen beaten, then roll again in cracker dust; fry in deep fat and drain on brown paper. Mrs. E. A. Padgham.

When stone cold, roll as cro- quettes in egg and bread crumbs in small balls the size of English walnuts, and fry in hot lard. They must be very soft. Use only Edam cheese, if possible.

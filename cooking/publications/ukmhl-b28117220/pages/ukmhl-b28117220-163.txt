115 EGGS. even pieces of toast a trifle larger than the muffin-rings. Moisten them with hot water, and spread with a little butter. Remove the eggs carefully with a pancake turner, and place one on each piece of toast; then lift off the rings, and place a spot of pepper in the center of each yolk. Mary Ronald in “Century Cook Book.” BEATEN OMELET. Beat very light the whites of four eggs; beat until light col- ored the yolks of the four eggs; add three tablespoonfuls of milk, a speck of pepper, a sprinkle of salt. Pour this mix- ture into the beaten whites, and fold—not stir—slightly to- gether. Put into an omelet-pan a tablespoonful of butter; when melted and hot, pour in the eggs. As soon as set, shake slightly all the time, until firm; with a buttered knife keep the edge of the omelet from sticking to the pan. When firm and brown upon the bottom, place in a hot oven for about three minutes to thoroughly cook the top. When finished, turn once, put on a hot platter, and serve immediately. For a sweet omelet, add a tablespoonful of sugar, and omit pepper. Variations are made by spreading an omelet, just before turning, with chopped meat of any kind, with tomato, or with jelly. ANCHOVY EGGS. Boil eggs, halve and take out yolks. Mix with a little an- chovy-paste. Put mixture back into the white parts of the eggs, and skewer together with toothpicks to keep firm. Dip in beaten eggs and bread crumbs twice. Drop into boiling lard, brown and serve at once. Kate S. Vosburg. ANCHOVY WITH POACHED EGGS.

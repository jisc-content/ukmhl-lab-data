Charlotte E. Hahn. strawberries A LA ROMANA. Do not ruin the flavor by washing too much, nor letting them remain in sugar too long before serving. Put them in a bowl very carefully. If of a large variety, serve with caps and stems; add some powdered sugar and squeeze the juice of one- half a lemon for every saucer; then serve. Aurelio AMILLO. TOMATO PRESERVE. Take half-ripe tomatos ; put them in lime water over night. Then wash them in two or three waters; last put some boiling water over them. Then take five pounds of sugar to six pounds of tomatos. Boil the sugar with little water to a syrup quite thick. Then put in your tomatos and let cook very slowly till your syrup is niceâ€”it may take two or three hours. Last put some sticks of cinnamon and one lemon, cut in two. Mrs Ducommun. TOMATO PRESERVE. One pound of sugar to every pound of tomatos, with quarter pint of water; four lemons to a pound of tomatos.

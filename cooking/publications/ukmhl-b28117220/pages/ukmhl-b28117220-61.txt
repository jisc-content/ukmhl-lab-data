SPANISH-AMERICAN COOKERY. 13 viously mixed with a little milk) in a saucepan on the fire. Stir it constantly, being careful not to remove the spoon, and let it boil until you can see the bottom of the saucepan. Then add another one and one-half pints of milk and repeat the opera- tion; lastly add the remaining one and one-half pints of milk and continue to stir until you can again see the bottom of the saucepan. Two things of importance are, to stir constantly and never to take the spoon with which you are stirring it, out of the saucepan until you remove it from the fire; then continue to stir briskly until it is thick. Pour on a plate, let it cool and it is ready to serve. ALMOND PASTE (MEXICO). Six pints milk, sweetened to taste. Add the yolks of six eggs previously beaten with a little milk. Add four ounces al- monds, blanched and pounded up (with a wooden potato- masher is easiest). Put this on the fire; and when it thickens, add four ounces more of almonds toasted and pounded. Let it boil up three times and it is done. Turn into plates and sprinkle with powdered sugar. Next day put it into the oven until it becomes a light brown. WALNUT PASTE (MEXICO). Dissolve one and one-half pounds sugar in one quart milk. Strain it. Add one-half pound ground walnuts, and boil. When done, take it from the fire and stir till it thickens. CAJETA DE CELAYA (MEXICO). Six pints of cow’s milk, three pints of goat’s milk, mix and boil; allow it to cool, and remove the cream or scum. Burn one and one-half pounds sugar and then stir it into the milk, and add to it four and one-half pounds more of sugar, and six ounces of ground rice. Place the mixture on the fire and let it boil until it is thick. One can tell this, if when one takes a little of the paste in a spoon and whirls it around it adheres to the spoon. Then remove from the fire and add half a pint of sherry, stir until it is well mixed, and pour into plates or pretty dishes.

FISH. Mrs. J. G. Mossin. OYSTERS A LA POULETTE. Put one dozen freshly opened oysters in a saucepan with their juice; add half a pinch of salt and some pepper; parboil for three minutes. In another saucepan mix two ounces of good butter with one tablespoonful of flour; stir it on the fire until hot; add to the juice of oysters; let boil two minutes. Mix the yolks of three eggs in a half cup of sweet cream, and the juice of half a lemon. Pour it gradually in the saucepan, being careful not to boil it again. Mix the oysters with a little finely chopped parsley; pour the sauce over, stirring slightly, and serve very hot on triangular pieces of fried toast. Mrs. a. Haas. OYSTER RAREBIT. One pint oysters, three tablespoons butter, one cup oyster liquor, one-third cup bread crumbs, salt, paprika, mustard, cayenne, six slices buttered toast or zephyrettes, one saltspoon soda, one cup grated cheese. Drain oysters from liquor, wash and remove head, muscle, and mince them; mix with well- beaten eggs. Melt butter in double boiler and mix in cheese and seasoning.

Mix half a pound of icing sugar, quarter pound of ground al- monds and a few drops of flavoring, and the whites of two eggs, into a stiff paste. Then make into small balls. Have your hands well dusted with the icing sugar, or the mixture will stick. Roll them in fine grated chocolate and make “eyes” in them with a fork or a pair of scissors. Have ready a fryingpan with plenty of boiling butter (clarified), and put in the “pota- tos.” Be careful that they are not too close to one another. Drain and serve with finely chopped pistachios sprinkled over them. Mrs. William S. Cross.

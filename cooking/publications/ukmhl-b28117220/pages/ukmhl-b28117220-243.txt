fruits, jellies, etc. pound of fruit; add one lemon cut into small pieces to every two pounds of fruit. Boil all together till thick. Mrs. Herman Hellman. CRANBERRIES. Put three pints of washed berries in a granite kettle. On top of them put three cups of granulated sugar and three gills of water. After they begin to boil, cook them ten minutes, closely covered. Do not stir them. Remove the scum. They will jell when cold, and the skins will be soft and tender. Mrs. Capen. CRANBERRY SAUCE. One quart cranberries, iy2 cups sugar, juice half lemon. Cook slowly and put in mold. Mrs. Jerry Conroy. FIG JAM. Wash and wipe white figs; peel black ones. Cut in halves if medium sized; if large, cut in thirds. To eleven pints of figs (heaped measure) use seven pints of sugar. Put all the fruit and four pints of sugar in a kettle without water. Add the thin rind of four lemons, an ounce of cinnamon, stick, and let come to a boil gradually. Then boil rapidly for thirty min- utes, stirring all the time. Add the remaining three pints of sugar and boil ten minutes. Bottle and seal. If ginger is liked, a small piece of the ginger root may be put in each jar when bottling. Mrs. E. B. Millar. GREEN FIG PRESERVE. Materials: Green figs, one-half to two-thirds grown ; syrup, sugar, one pound to each pound of figs, using a little more wa- ter than usual, as the figs have no juice of their own. Make a cross-cut in each fig, from the top to about half way down. Place the cut figs in cold water, and let them soak for twelve hours or more. A small lump of quicklime may be added to the water. Drain the figs and parboil in fresh water until they can be pierced with a straw. Drain again, and boil in the syrup until perfectly clear. Mrs. Emmeline Childs.

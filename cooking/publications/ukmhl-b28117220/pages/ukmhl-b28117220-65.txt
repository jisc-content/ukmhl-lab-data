SPANISH-AMERICAN COOKERY. 17 put in stew-pan, cover with one pint of water, cook until the pulp on peppers is soft, about twenty minutes, strain through a colander into a deep bowl or pan, mash the chiles also through colander, the pulp will go through, leaving skins behind, mix the pulp well with the water, add the vinegar to this. Have frying pan hot, put in a heaping kitchen spoonful of lard, when melted and hot, put in a teaspoonful of chopped onions, â€¢let brown lightly, add heaping spoonful (also kitchen, and quite large) of flour, stir well together, then put in pepper pulp and the salt. Should sauce be too thick, thin down with boiling water. Cut olives in small pieces, grate cheese, and mince the onions or chives. Make a batter of the meal, flour, half tea- spoonful of salt, lard and egg, a little thicker than for hot cakes, fry in hot lard or oil, in small cakes; cook all the cakes first, dip them in chile sauce, one at a time, put on a hot platter, sprinkle olives, onion, and lastly cheese on each one, layer by layer, until all the cakes are used up, then pour sauce over all.

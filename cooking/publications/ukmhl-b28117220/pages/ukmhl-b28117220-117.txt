Put in deep bowl in layers. Pour over three tablespoonfuls salad oil; a sprinkle of paprika, salt. Cover closely and place in the refrigerator until chilled. ROSE SALAD. This salad was given to me by a member of the Sultanâ€™s household. I have tried it and found it very delicious. Pound in a mortar and pestle the leaves of three large red roses and six almonds. Heat, but do not boil, a cup of strained honey, add the rose leaves and rub through a fine strainer. Take twelve ripe figs, or those conserved in glass, the syrup of which can be used instead of honey. Arrange them in a mound on a glass dish, add a wineglass of Chartreuse to the rose leaf syrup and pour over the figs. Place candied rose leaves over the mound and about its base, ornamenting the outer rim with fresh roses and thin green leaves. Mulberries may be used in place of the figs, or strawberries or peaches, if you wish to make an American adaptation of an Oriental salad. Justine Ingersoll. SCALLOP SALAD. Soak the scallops in salted water, simmer five minutes in boiling water, drain, cool, cut in slices and marinate with French dressing. At serving, drain, mix with equal bulk of celery, dress with mayonnaise, shape in a mound. Miss Elizabeth Shankland.

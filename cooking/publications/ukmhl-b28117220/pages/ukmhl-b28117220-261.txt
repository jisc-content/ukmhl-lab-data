213 BREAD, ROLLS, ETC. CREAM BREAD. Dissolve a piece of 'butter the size of a walnut in one quart of scalding milk; add one pint of cold water. When cool, so that the flour will not scald, add two quarts of sifted flour and beat until very smooth. Dissolve one cake of compressed yeast in a little tepid water, and add to sponge and set in warm place for two hours. Then add to sponge one tablespoon of sugar, one tablespoon of salt, a lump of soda the size of a bean dissolved in a teaspoon of water, and stir in sifted flour until the mass can be handled. Knead twenty minutes or longer if it seems sticky, then let it rise two hours, when it will be ready to form into loaves. This amount should make three good sized loaves and a pan of rolls. Use very little flour when you make the bread into the pans. Knead each loaf five minutes; let them rise thirty minutes, and bake one hour. When taken out of the oven rub top crust with sweet butter and let cool without covering. Mrs. W. P. Craft. WHOLE WHEAT BREAD.

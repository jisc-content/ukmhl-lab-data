entrees. 75 * spoons of flour; let thicken and stir into the other ingredients. When cold form into balls, dip in egg, then in bread crumbs, and fry in deep, hot fat. Serve with tomato sauce. Mrs. Nannie M. Griffith, Johannesburg. CHICKEN CROQUETTES. Use cold roast or boiled chicken chopped fine (not too fine), three-quarters of a pound to one pound of mushrooms or half can mushrooms cut in small dices. Put into a saucepan a teaspoonful of grated onion and a tablespoonful of butter and let them begin to brown. Then stir in two heaping table- spoons of flour and half pint of chicken broth or of water mixed with the liquor of the canned mushrooms. Then add the chicken (chopped) and mushrooms, a palatable seasoning of salt and pepper and a glass of sherry. Stir the croquette mixture until it begins to boil, then draw the saucepan to the side of the fire and stir in the yolks of four raw eggs. After the eggs are added, pour the mixture upon an oiled dish and cool it. After the croquettes mixture is cold, fry the croquette as follows: Have ready a deep bowl containing two eggs beaten smooth, a large platter full of cracker dust or fine bread crumbs, and over the fire a frying kettle half full of hot lard. Wet the hands with cold water, form the croquettes like large corks, handling them very lightly and quickly. Roll them in crumbs, then dip them in the beaten egg and again roll in the crumbs. Fry them a golden brown in the hot lard. When the croquettes are done, take them out of the fat with a skim- mer, lay them on brown paper for a moment to free them from grease and then serve. Mrs. John T. Griffith. CROQUETTES OF* FISH. Take any kind of boiled fish, separate it from the bones care- fully, chop with a little parsley and salt and pepper to taste. Beat up an egg with a teaspoonful of milk and flour. Roll the fish balls and turn them in the beaten egg and cracker crumbs or bread. Fry a light brown, and serve with mayonnaise or lemon sauce. 6 Mrs. Hermann Hellman.

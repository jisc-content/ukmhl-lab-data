51 MEATS. let simmer until tender. Garnish' with boiled onions, sea- soned, basted with butter and browned in a hot oven. Skim the fat from the liquid in which the meat was cooked, thicken the latter with flour and water, strain and serve as a sauce with the meat. Mrs. M. T. Etchemendy. BCEUE A LA MODE (FRENCH). The piece chosen must be well beaten and a few incisions made in it, where thin pieces of salt pork are introduced. Melt some thin slices of salt pork over a rather brisk fire, and place the meat in it, turning it until it is brown on both sides. Do the same with some onions and carrots. Then lower the fire till it is very small, and pour in with the meat a glass of tepid water and half a glass of white wine; add a little sugar (about a teaspoonful), some pepper and cloves. Let it cook- ery slowly, keeping the pan tightly closed, for about six hours. This is excellent, either warm or cold. Marthe Durnerin. FILLETS DE BCEtTF AUX CHAMPIGNONS. Cut the meat in slices, not too thin. Sprinkle with salt and pepper, and allow to smother in melted butter for about an hour over a very slow fire. Then increase the heat until the meat has browned. Remove the meat from the pan and add one tablespoonful of flour mixed with some bouillon ; add the mushrooms which have been cleaned and peeled. Replace the meat and cook until the mushrooms are done. Serve with lemon juice. Pour the thick sauce over the fillets and place the mushrooms around. One may add a little Madeira wine to the sauce while cooking. The fillets may be served with- out the mushrooms, but with a tomato sauce. Mrs. Eugene O. McLaughlin. BEEF OMELET LOAF.

Mix well and form into a loaf. Put a little water and bit of butter with the pan. Turn a pan over the top and bake an hour and a quarter, basting occasionally. Mrs. John H. Norton.

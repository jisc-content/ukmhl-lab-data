LANDMARKS CLUB COOK BOOK. 84 “vfnison soy” for thf chafing dish. Prepare the venison in thin slices. Put into the chafing dish two large tablespoons of butter. When hot (boiling point) put in the venison. Cook until half done, and add one tablespoon currant jelly, one tablespoon (scant) Worcestershire sauce, one teaspoon chopped parsley, with salt and pepper to taste, and lastly one cup cream. Cover closely and cook until venison is done—eight or ten minutes. The “soy” is dependent for its deliciousness upon the proper quantities of jelly and Worces- tershire sauce. Stir often and serve on very hot plates with bits of toast cut in strips. Mrs. C. C. Carpenter.

CHAPTER VI. SALADS. APPLE ANDâ€™ CELERY SALAD. Prepare beforehand a good mayonnaise, seasoned well, and do not forget a pinch of cayenne. Peel tart crisp apples, one at a time, cutting in slices, and these in turn into dice, mixing and covering at once with the mayonnaise, a slice at a time to keep from turning dark. The celery should be one-half the amount of the apple; very crisp and white, and cut into bits, about one-half by one-quarter of an inch long. Mix the apple and celery in turn, and when altogether, put in a bowl with white lettuce leaves. If a richer salad is desired, English walnuts, blanched and broken in small bits, may be added, about one-quarter as much as the apple being used. 2. Beets may be used with celery instead of apple, and this makes a delicious salad, too. Cauliflower, a fine head, boiled whole and salted, and when tender allowed to cool and drain, makes a good salad served with mayonnaise poured over the whole, and garnished with small hearts of lettuce, and bits of boiled beets.

Boil briskly or they will change their color; twelve minutes will cook them. Throw them into a colander to drain. While hot, pour over a French dressing. Surround with lettuce leaves. Set in ice-box an hour before serving. Two ounces of cold boiled tongue cut in neat pieces is an addi- tion to this salad. Canned sprouts can be used when fresh ones are not in the market.

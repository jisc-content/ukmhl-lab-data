EGGS. 121 Miss H. Knickerbocker. "butter into an omelet-pan; melt the butter without burning it, pour in the eggs, and shake the pan (or use a fork) to detach the cooking egg from the side of the pan. Continue until all the egg is partly set, then fold the omelet; let stand a moment to brown delicately, then turn on to a serving-dish. Pour half a cup of hot Jamaica rum over the omelet; set on fire and serve at once. Miss M. T. Etchkmendy. CHERRY OR APPLE OMELET. One cup of flour, with milk, beaten stiff; then add two or three eggs (according to quantity) ; then thin batter with milk like tender pancake dough. Into this put a little salt and quarter cup sugar. Prepare pint seeded cherries or fine chopped apples. Put half tablespoon lard and half tablespoon butter in a shallow skillet, and heat. Into this pour cherries or apples, and quickly pour batter over. This will get nicely done in a few minutes. If necessary to brown on top, throw on plate and back into hot fat, or put in oven for a few min- utes. Serve with fruit on top and sprinkle generously with sugar. Nice luncheon dessert, and very quickly made with apples. Mrs. Koepfli. TORTAS DE HUEVOS. Six eggs, one onion chopped very fine, half cup flour, one level teaspoonful baking powder, half pound mild cream cheese. Cut the cheese in thin squares; beat the eggs as for omelet, add flour and onion, beat lightly, then add baking powder and salt; drop in piece of cheese. Have ready a pot of hot lard, as for croquettes; use a large kitchen spoon. Take up one piece of cheese at a time with as much of the egg mix- ture as the spoon will hold; drop into fat. When all are cooked, pour over chile sauce, as given below. CHILE SAUCE. Chop one onion very fine, fry until done; stir in two table- spoonfuls of red chile and a tablespoonful of flour; to this add boiling water until you have a nice thick gravy. The on- ion may be omitted. In that case, have your grease hot and stir in your flour and chile. When smooth, add water.

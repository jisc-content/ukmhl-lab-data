CHAPTER II. SOUPS. Broth or stock may be made by boiling the cracked joints of beef, veal, or mutton in water, in the proportion of two and one-half pints to each pound of bones and meat. The bones and meat should be of about equal weight. Chicken and veal added to beef make a more delicate soup. Put the meat in the pot, cover with cold water, and let it come to a boil, then skim. Next set the pot where it will sim- mer slowly four or five hours, when it should be done. The next day, when the broth is cold, and the fat which has hardened on the top has been removed, a nice jelly will be formed, which, if kept in a cold place, should keep one week. When vegetables are used, they should be added only in time to become well cooked. If onions are used, they should be fried in a little hot butter, before they are added to the soup. Potatos and cabbage should be boiled in separate water, before they are added to a soup. Just before dinner each day, if soup is to be served, it is only necessary to cut off some of the jelly, heat it, serve it alone or add any flavoring desired, as onion, tomato, asparagus, green peas, macaroni, vermicelli, tapioca, or any other flavoring. Stock should be kept in a stone jar, and is valuable aside from making soups, for gravies, sauces, and stews. TO CLEAR SOUP STOCK. Allow the white and ^hell of one egg for every quart of stock. Set it on the fire and stir till hot, let simmer ten min- utes, then add a cup of cold water, and strain through a fine strainer or napkin. * M. B. w., "How We Cook in Los Angeles.‚Äù ALMOND SOUP.

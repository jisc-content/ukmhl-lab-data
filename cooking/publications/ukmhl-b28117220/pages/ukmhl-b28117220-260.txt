Four cupfuls flour, quarter cup of butter, one of milk, quar- ter cake of compressed yeast, three tablespoons cold water, one tablespoon sugar, one teaspoon salt (scant measure), white of one egg. Melt the butter in the milk. Dissolve the yeast in the water. Beat the white of egg to a stiff froth. Add all the ingredients to the flour. Knead well, and let the dough rise over night. In the morning make into balls the size of large walnuts. Roll these into sticks a foot long. Place them two inches apart in long pans. Let them rise half an hour in a cool place. Bake twenty-five minutes in a moderate oven. They should be quite dry and crisp. HOP YEAST. Steep half a cupful loose hops in one quart boiling water, in a granite kettle, for five minutes. Mix one cupful of flour, one-fourth of a cupful of sugar and one tablespoonful of salt. Strain the hop water, and pour it, boiling hot, into the flour mixture. Boil one minute, or until thick. When cooled, add one cupful yeast or one cake magic yeast. POTATO YEAST. Six good sized potatos, grated fine. Pour over them one quart of boiling hop-water (not too strong, or it will make the bread dark). Add one-half cup of salt, and one cup of sugar. Stir it well, and when cool, add one yeast cake, or one cup of fresh yeast, or one cake magic yeast. Let it rise, and cork tight and keep in a cool place. Mrs. F. J. Wagner. MRS. MOSSIN'S RYE BREAD.

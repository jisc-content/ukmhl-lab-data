CHAPTER XIV. DESSERTS. frozen desserts. SUGGESTIONS FOR FREEZING. Pour the mixture that is to be frozen into the tin can, put the beater in this, and cover. Place in the tub, being careful to have the point on the bottom fit into the socket in the tub. Place on the cross-piece, and turn the crank to see if every- thing is in place. Next conies the packing. Ice should be broken in large pieces, put in a canvas bag and pounded fine. Put a thick layer in the tub; then a thin layer of salt. Continue until the tub is full, and pack down solid with a paddle or a piece of wood. Turn a few times and add more ice as the mass settles. Re- member that if the freezer is packed solid at first, no more ice or salt is needed. The water should not be let off, as it is one of the strongest elements in the freezing. Turn the crank for twenty minutesâ€”not fast at first, but very rapidly the last ten minutes. Turn back the cross-piece, wipe the salt and ice from cover, and remove cover without displacing the can itself. Work a large spoon up and down in the mixture until it is light and the space left by taking out the beater is filled. Cover the can, cork the hole from which the beater was taken, and set the tub in a cool place for an hour or more. Miss Parloa. Any mixture to be frozen should be thoroughly chilled be- fore it is turned into the can of the freezer, lest a second sup- ply of ice be needed. A mixture too sweet will not freeze readily; a mixture that is lacking in sweetness freezes quickly, but will be coaise and granular in texture. The proportion of salt to ice affects the time required in freezing, and, incidentally, the smoothness of the product. With a freezer operated by a crank, use three measures of ice

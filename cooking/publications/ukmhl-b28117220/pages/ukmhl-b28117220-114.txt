Take five tablespoonfuls of sour cream, two tablespoonfuls of vin- egar, half a teaspoonful of paprika, one pinch of salt and half a teaspoonful of hashed up chives; mix it well, so that the paprika does not form little balls. When well mixed add it to the cucumbers and serve. Mrs. M. J. Connell. EGG SALAD. Cover a platter with lettuce, using only the little yellow leaves. Boil eggs until hard, but not long enough so that the yolks will turn dark. Use eggs in proportion to number of persons to be served. Spread mayonnaise over the lettuce; cut up yolks and whites of eggs separately and not too fine. Place in alternate stripes, about two inches wide, on the let- tuce, taking care to have the stripes uniform and even. FISH SALAD. Any kind of cold white fish. If you boil fresh fish, put a little vinegar in to flake it. Add fresh beans, peas, carrots (this can be omitted) and beets; French dressing mixed thor- oughly with fish. When served, pour over a mayonnaise made with vinegar from capers; put a few capers on top. Miss Maurice. FRUIT SALAD. Cut the tops from one dozen oranges and scoop out pulp into a bowl; add one small box red strawberries, one-half pound fresh cherries from which the seeds have been re- moved, one-half teacup preserved fruit of any kind and three bananas, sweetening to taste. Stir thoroughly together and fill the orange skins. Whip one pint of cream stiff, and on top of each filled orange place a large spoonful of the whipped cream. Serve on delicate lettuce leaves as first course at a dinner or luncheon. FRUIT SALAD. Six large apples, almonds, celery; peel, core and chop the apples; blanc and chop the nuts; chop crisp celery; mix about equal parts of each with a cooked salad dressing. Just before serving stir in two-thirds cup of whipped cream. Mrs. H. Kerckhoff.

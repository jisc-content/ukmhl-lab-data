CHAPTER IV. POULTRY AND QAME. broiled chicken. Cut in half small chickens. Butter, salt and pepper. Broil over live coals about twenty minutes. Serve with bits of parsley and thin slices of lemon. Mrs. Jerry Conroy. CHICKEN EN FRICASSEE (FRENCH). The real fricassee must be perfectly white; it will be if the following directions are exactly followed. The chicken must be left entire, well cleaned and tied compactly. Put in a large saucepan a lump of fresh butter; when it begins to melt mix in two tablespoonfuls of flour, and pour in enough hot water (but not boiling) so that it may cover half of the chicken, when it shall be put in. Mix the sauce well; when it boils put the chicken in and also its neck and head; a little laurel and lemon peel, all of which should be taken out before serving. After half an hour of slow boiling, the pan being kept well covered, turn the chicken and place around it a dozen small round onions and cook again until done. If the sauce is too thin, take out the chicken and onions and let the sauce reduce by boiling. Just before serving, stir the sauce slowly into a yellow of egg well beaten. The chicken will be white and excellent, and the sauce is to be poured over it. Mushrooms which have been boiled separately will improve the fricassee if placed in it a few minutes before it is done. / Marthe Durnerin. FRIED CHICKEN. Cut in pieces, wipe dry, dip in flour, fry (first rapidly then steam slowly, so as not to dry up) in lard. Take up chicken, add two tablespoons flour to grease, let it cook up and add one cup milk and half cup cream for gravy. Mrs. Jerry Conroy.

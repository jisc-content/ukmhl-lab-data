CHAPTER X. EGGS BOILED EGGS. Soft-boiled eggs should have the albumen creamy, not hard. To obtain this, slow heat is required. Hence receipt No. I is recommended. No. 2 gives a soft egg, but the time is difficult to determine exactly. No. 3 gives satisfactory results. To have eggs hard, boil them for twenty-five minutes. The yolks will then be dry and mealy. When done, place them in cold water for fifteen minutes. Then roll them lightly on the table to crush the shells, which can then be peeled off easily, leav- ing the surface smooth and white. Use a sharp, thin knife for cutting them, so the pieces will be clean and smooth. No. 1 : Place the eggs in warm water, to heat the shells, so they will not crack when put into boiling water. Let the water in the saucepan boil violently; put the eggs in carefully, and when the water again bubbles, remove it from the fire; cover, and let the eggs remain in for five minutes. No. 2: Put the eggs into boiling water, and cook for three minutes, the water boiling all the time. No. 3: Place the eggs in cold water on the fire, and remove as soon as. the water boils. In these receipts have plenty of waterâ€”about a pint for two eggs. POACHED EGGS, NO. I. The white of a poached egg should be a white, translucent, jelly-like mass. To obtain this result, which makes it an easily digested food, it must cook very slowly, the water never reach- ing the boiling point. Place in a shallow pan as many muffin- rings as you have eggs to poach. Turn in enough boiling water to just cover the rings; add a little salt. When the water boils, draw the pan to the side of the range, and break an egg into each ring. It should take ten to fifteen minutes to cook the eggs to the translucent state desired. Have ready

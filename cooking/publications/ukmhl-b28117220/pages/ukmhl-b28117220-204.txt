156 LANDMARKS CLUB COOK BOOK. LEMON CREAM SPONGE. Four eggs, one cup sugar, two lemons, quarter box of gela- tine soaked in a teacup of cold water for an hour. ‘Beat the yolks with four tablespoons of sugar, add the juice and grated rind of the lemons, two tablespoons of hot water, the balance of the sugar and place in a double boiler until it is like soft custard, adding the gelatine just before removing from the fire. When it is cold and begins to set, add the whites of the eggs beaten stiff, and whip all together until smooth. Wet a mold in cold water and pour in the mixture. Serve with cream or a soft custard. This is nice molded with wine jelly. Mrs. W. H. Burnham, Orange. LEMON JELLY. Six eggs, two cups sugar, three lemons. Beat eggs until light; add sugar, juice and grated rind of lemons.

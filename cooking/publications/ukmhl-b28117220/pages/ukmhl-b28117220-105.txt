meats. 57 tongue is used. Then take half a cup of vinegar and half a cup of olive oil and pour over, cover tightly and let it set over night. Fresh tongue may be used, but the dried is much nicer. Mrs. Jambs C. Kays. STUEEED HAM. Boil ham, take off skin while hot, pour over it half cup vin- egar, then take two cups chopped meat or chicken, half cup chicken broth to bind, one cup cracker crumbs, salt and pep- per to taste. Then take a long skewer, make holes about one inch apart, put filling in holes. Make a paste of one cup brown sugar, half cup flour, cream enough to make soft paste, rub all over ham. Bake brown, baste with one pint sherry. When cold, slice thin and serve. Mrs. Jerry Conroy. HOW TO BOII, AN OLD VIRGINIA HAM. First weigh the ham, then scrub thoroughly with a stiff brush in luke-warm water, being careful to remove every par- ticle of mold. Cover it with cold water, add one pint of vin- egar and a tablespoon of herbs. Let it simmer slowly, keep- ing it on the fire, allowing half hour for every pound in weight of the ham. Take it from the fire and let it remain in the water until nearly cold, then peel off the skin and either sprinkle brown sugar and rolled cracker crumbs over the top or cover with a paste made with one teaspoonful of brown flour and half cup brown sugar, moistened with a little port wine. Then put it in the oven and brown nicely. Dress the knuckle with a white paper ruffle. Sauces to Serve with Hamâ€”Serve with brown sauce, flavored with half glass of champagne. To serve cold boiled ham, cut in thin slices, season highly with cayenne pepper or with mustard and lemon juice, and boil two minutes. Melt half glass currant jelly, add a tea- spoonful of butter and a little pepper, and when hot, add sev- eral small slices of ham. Let it boil up and serve at once. For herbs, use one tablespoonful herbs, consisting in part of thyme, summer savory, sweet marjoram; also use one stalk celery, one sprig parsley. Mrs. L. W. Blinn.

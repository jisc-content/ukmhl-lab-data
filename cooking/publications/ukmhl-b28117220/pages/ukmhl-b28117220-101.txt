A three or four pound pot roast larded, put in an earthen vessel and cover with vinegar and water to taste (one cup strong vinegar and two of water is good).

Put in kettle two tablespoons drippings and brown the beef well all over, and then pour in the vinegar, water, etc., and let boil two and one-half hours. Take out meat, thicken gravy and serve.

Into this flour nest break four eggs, add a pinch of salt and half a cup of luke-warm water and flour enough to make a stiff dough, work dough for fully twenty minutes, roll out very thin, same as rolling out pie crust, dredge with flour now and then to keep from sticking. Ret it remain on table to dry for about an hour, then roll it up in a tight scroll like a sheet of music. With a good sharp knife begin at the end and slice it into strips as thin as possible. While

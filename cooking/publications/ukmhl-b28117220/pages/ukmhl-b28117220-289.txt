INVALID COOKERY. 241 WINE WHEY. Three tablespoons milk; when boiling, add one tablespoon port wine. Strain and sweeten to taste for invalids. EGGS FOR INVALIDS. One of the most delicate ways in which to prepare an egg for an invalid is to beat the yolk and white separately until extremely light. Add a pinch of salt, pour into a china cup, which set in a saucepan of hot water, stirring constantly till scalded, but not cooked. When this is done slowly, the egg just thickens slightly, but puffs up until the cup is almost filled with the creamy custard. Set in the oven a moment and serve at once. Topeka Journal. OYSTER ROAST. Heat half pint oysters in their own liquor to boiling point, add one generous tablespoon butter, enough salt and pepper to season. Pour the oysters and liquor over a slice of hot toast. Serve at once. UNLEAVENED BREAD. Take graham, rye or oatmeal, add a very little salt, and water enough to make a batter as for griddle cakes; beat and work it, the more the better; have your oven hissing hot; make a thin loaf about a quarter of an inch thick.

White of an egg beaten very stiff; stir in very gradually ten heaping teaspoons of powdered sugar and one teaspoon starch, both sifted very fine. Stir constantly for about fifteen min- utes. If desired, flavor with rose-water or vanilla. While the cake is warm, dredge it with flour; then wipe it all off. This allows the icing to be more evenly spread. Spread smoothly with a broad knife, and set it in a cool place to harden.

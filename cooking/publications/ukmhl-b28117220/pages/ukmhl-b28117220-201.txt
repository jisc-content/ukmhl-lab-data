desserts. 153 MAPLE parEait. Beat the yolks of six eggs until light; add three and a quarter cupfuls of maple syrup. Place the mixture on the stove and stir constantly until the eggs have thickened enough to make a thick coating on a spoon. Turn it into a bowl and beat until it is cold. It will then be very light. When thoroughly cold add one pint of cream whipped to a stiff froth. Stir lightly together. Turn the mixture into a mold holding three pints, and keep in ice for four hours. Mrs. Bonsall. AMERICAN SHERBET. Secure some tin molds to imitate high-shaped wineglasses; fill them with cold, pure water; close them securely, and pack them in pounded ice. In the meantime mix in equal quanti- ties some fruit syrup, wine and orange or lemon juice. Al- most any kind of fruit syrup may be used. Pour the mixture into a freezing pot, and work it well until frozen. The sher- bet must not be frozen too firmly, yet it must be consistent enough to be piled up in pyramids in the ice glasses. When the water has frozen enough to take the form of the molds, turn it out carefully, drain out any liquid that has not frozen, and fill up the ice glasses with the frozen syrup, piling it up high. Stand the glasses on a fancy dish and pass them around. If desired, the water may be colored before being frozen in the molds, and a different color may be used in almost every mold. This will have a very pretty effect when served. Mrs. M. J. Connell. GINGER SHERBET.

Used on New Year’s Day in New York in the early sixties by an old New York beau. Half gallon old Jamaica rum, half gallon old Santa Cruz rum. The above proportions may be varied according to taste, one gallon of rum, however, being required. One gallon water, one small cup (demi tasse) of green tea, very strong drawn and strained, for above quan- tity of rum; juice of six lemons, thoroughly mixed with white granulated sugar; before mixing sweeten to the taste. Put in slices of lemon without the rind; large lump of ice to re- duce the strength. Just before serving, pour in one or more bottles of champagne, according to taste. Same proportions must be followed for a less quantity (except as to the rum above stated), particularly as to the green tea and lemons. The above, including melted ice and champagne, will make nearly three gallons of punch. Two bottles of champagne and the above make a very fine punch; excellent for a jolly good headache on the following morning. “Nunc est bibendum.’ (Copied verbatim from the original.) Mrs H. T. I,ee.

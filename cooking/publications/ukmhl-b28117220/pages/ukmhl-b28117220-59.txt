Bring cane molasses to a boil, with a few orange peels and sticks of cinnamon. As it starts to boil, add plenty of Amer- ican cheese, crumbled fine, walnuts, peanuts and cocoanut all well broken up, very small pieces of dry bread, a few cloves, and a little butter. Let it come to a hot boil, cool on plates and sprinkle with cinnamon. COCADA (PERU). (Cocoanut Sweets) : Grate an ordinary cocoanut, grate a sweet potato and remove the starch. The fibre that is left mix with the grated nut thoroughly as possible. Put in a kettle a little water with three lbs. sugar and make a syrup. As soon as this begins to boil, clarify it with an egg. Then put into it the mixed cocoanut and sweet potato, and stir well with a wooden spoon. When it is about to boil, add the well-beaten yolks of six eggs; stir, and let it come barely to a boil. Re- move and sprinkle well with cinnamon. CAMOTES CON DUECE (PERU). (“Candied Sweet Potatos”) : Parboil small, peeled sweet potatos, cut in quarters lengthwise. Let them merely come to a boil. Put them in cane molasses or brown cane sugar syrup, as if for candy. Add four cloves and a little pepper, well ground. Boil four hours over a slow fire. Before serving, sprinkle with powdered cinnamon. CANDIED PEACHES (MEXICO). Take twenty-five large peaches and let them lie in water for a little while; then remove the down by rubbing with a cloth. Stone them and put them in a kettle with two lbs. granulated sugar—a layer of peaches and a layer of sugar—add one-half pint water and place on a moderate fire. When the syrup is thick, take off the fire, and put peaches and syrup together in a dish. Flatten the peaches with a wooden spoon and turn from time to time, putting them in a place where the sun will shine on them. When they are nearly dry roll in colored sugar. They will keep a long time.

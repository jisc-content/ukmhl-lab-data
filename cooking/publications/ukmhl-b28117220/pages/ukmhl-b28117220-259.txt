CHAPTER XIX. BREAD, ROLLS, ETC. BREAD, BISCUITS, ETC. The first and indispensable requisite of good bread is good flour; the second, good yeast. It should be mixed as soft as can be handled; it will rise sooner, be lighter, more digestible, and keep fresh longer. Knead thoroughly. Put in warm place to rise. Bake in a moderate oven, with a steady fire. Ordinary sized loaves require one hour. Biscuit requires a quicker oven. BREAD. One cake Royal yeast, six cups water, half cup milk, one teaspoon salt, a small piece of butter, flour. Make a thin bat- ter of flour and three cups of water; to this add the yeast, which has been softened in warm water. When light, add the salt, butter, milk, three cups of water, and flour enough to make very stiff. Let it rise over night. In the morning add more flour. Knead .thoroughly and make into loaves. This recipe will make most delicious rolls. YEAST BREAD. One cake yeast, one pint luke-warm water, one quart new milk, one quart cold water, one tablespoon salt, two tablespoons sugar, flour, butter or lard. At noon soak the yeast in the warm water fifteen minutes, then stir in flour sufficient to make a stiff batter. Set it in a warm place (not too warm) until very light. In the evening scald the milk and add it, with the water, salt, sugar and flour, enough to knead. Knead it half an hour, then rub the top of the dough with butter or lard, to prevent its drying. In the morning knead another half hour, divide into six loaves, and when sufficiently light bake one hour in a hot oven. When taken from the oven, wet the tops of the loaves with sweet milk or butter to soften the crust.

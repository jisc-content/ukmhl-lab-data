Mks. J. O. Korpfli. t! LANDMARKS CLUB COOK BOOK. STEWED VEAL (german). Two or three pounds of lean veal cut in pieces ready to serve. Put two tablespoons of drippings in kettle and get very hot; put in veal, season with pepper, salt, bay leaf and trifle nut- meg, and let brown all over. Then slice in one good-sized onion and let brown. Cover with boiling water and stew for about an hour, just keeping enough water to make a nice gravy. Then put in two or three tablespoons sherry (or some white wine) and thicken with tablespoon flour in a little water. Let boil a few minutes and serve.

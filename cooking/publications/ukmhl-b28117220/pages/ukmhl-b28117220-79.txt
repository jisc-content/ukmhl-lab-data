FISH. 31 first layer enough cream sauce to cover. Then another layer of crab until the dish is filled. Sift some cracker crumbs over the top. Put some bits of butter on the top and bake a light brown. The cream sauce is made with a lump of butter, melted in a saucepan, to which a tablespoonful of flour is added.

Pick any cold fresh fish or salt codfish, left from the dinner, into fine bits, carefully removing all the bones. Take a pint of milk in a suitable dish and place it in a saucepan of boiling water; put into it a few slices of onion, cut very fine, a sprig of parsley minced fine; add a piece of butter as large as an egg, a pinch of salt, a sprinkle of white pepper; then stir in two tablespoonfuls of corn starch or flour rubbed in a little cold milk; let all boil up and remove from the fire. Take a dish you wish to serve it in, butter the sides and bottom; put first a layer of the minced fish, then a layer of the cream, then sprinkle over that some cracker or bread crumbs, then a layer; of fish again, and so on, until the dish is full; spread cracker or bread crumbs last on the top to prevent the milk from scorching.

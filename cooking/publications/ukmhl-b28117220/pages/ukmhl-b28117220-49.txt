CHAPTER I. Some Spanish-American Dishes of California, Mexico, Peru, etc. FURNISHED BY CHAS. F. LUMMIS. CHUPE, the “national soup" OF PERU. Boil potatos, white or sweet. Shrimps are the highest touch of Chupe, but in Peru they are as large as a young lobster. The large Barataria shrimps will do. In default of them, use slices of any large, meaty fresh fish—-cod, halibut, etc. A smother is made in a pot, with butter, salt, a pinch of sweet marjoram, a little strong vinegar and a little pepper. Into this put successively the potatos, cut in halves, the shrimps or fish, quarter of a pound (for an ordinary family) of fresh cream cheese, cut up into pieces the size of the finger, and break into it four eggs. Pour on the boiling water in which the po- tatos were cooked, and boil slowly for an hour. Properly made, Chupe is admitted by travelers to be one of the most delicious soups in the world. SANCOCHADO (PERU). In a pot set water to boil, salting it first. Take rump beef, with plenty of fat, soup bones, and some dried beef. Wash carefully, and put in the pot when the water boils. Add a handful of rice, and one of peas, soaked over night. When it boils again, skim thoroughly, and add parsnips cut up, a whole onion and a couple of red chiles. When the meat is very ten- der, set back and allow to settle. In serving, the soup should be sprinkled with green peppers, onions, parsley and coriander, all chopped very fine. AJIACO (PERU). Boil prime potatos. In a stew-pan prepare a smother with salt, ground red chile, plenty of lard or butter, and shredded onions. Put iy the potatos, cut up but not smashed, and plenty of grated fresh cheese. Stir well and add a little broth, that it be not too thick. Serve with hard-boiled eggs cut in four; and sprinkle with chopped parsley and grated cheese.

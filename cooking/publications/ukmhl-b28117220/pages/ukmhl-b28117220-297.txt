CHAPTER XXV. MISCELLANEOUS. CAMPHOR ICE. One-half ounce gum camphor with alcohol enough to dis- solve it, one-half ounce white wax, one-half ounce vaseline jelly. Put all together in a tin cup; heat enough to melt thoroughly. SUBSTITUTE FOR CREAM IN COFFEE. Beat the white of an egg, put to it a small lump of butter and pour the coffee into it gradually, stirring it so that it will not curdle. It is difficult to distinguish this from fresh cream. Many drop a tiny piece of sweet butter into their cup of hot coffee as a substitute for cream. COLD CREAM. Oil sweet almonds, seven ounces, French rose water four ounces, spermaceti two ounces, white wax 240 grains. Melt the wax and spermaceti, both shaved fine, with the oil. When nearly cold, beat in the rose water with a Doan egg beater, being careful not to let it separate. Benzoin or attar of rose may be added. J. F. W., Santa Barbara. SILVER POLISH. Alcohol six ounces, aqua ammonia half ounce, soft water three ounces; electro silicon to make it the consistency of cream. Keep the bottle tightly corked. Apply with a soft cloth and rub off when dry. J. F. W., Santa Barbara. JAVA WATER. One pound chloride lime, two pounds sal soda, fourteen quarts boiling water. Strain and bottle for use. This will remove fruit and wine stains. Dip in the water a few mo- ments until the stain disappears. It must be well rinsed in cold water before putting into hot. Mrs. J. G Mossin.

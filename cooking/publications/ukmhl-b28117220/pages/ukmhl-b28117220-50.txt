In separate dish beat up two to four eggs till very light; pour into them, without stopping beating, the minced onion, etc. When these are well beaten together, add a little flour and continue beating until the whole is well mixed. Then add the picked-up fish, pepper and salt, all the time beat- ing the batter. Have a pan of hot lard ready, as for dough- nuts, and chop the batter into this, a spoonful at a time, and cook them a delicate brown. Very delicious shrimp fritters are made in the same way. LOMITO (peru). Take a piece of fresh pork tenderloin and slice it as for beefsteak. Take a plenty of ground chile, a little cayenne pep- per, and dissolve all in good vinegar. Put the slices in this for one hour, and then lay them aside to dry ofif. To use, grease them with a little butter, and broil. PAPAS RELLENAS (peru). (Stuffed Potatos) : Mash potatos soft and moist and sea- son well with salt and pepper. Mince up cooked beef, and make a cone of it, with raisins, clove, a little good port wine, minced hard-boiled egg and stoned ripe olives. Cover this with the batter of mashed potato, forming a ball, and fry in hot lard like doughnuts, to a golden brown. Tamal criollo (peru). (Creole Tamales) : Take white hulled corn and mash thor- oughly. Put in a clean covered dish. Put in a pot to boil, a little water with morsels of fresh pork (or chicken), with salt. When it comes to a boil, take out the meat and wet up the corn-dough with this broth. Warm a pound of lard or but- ter, add ground chile and a little anise, and mix this thoroughly with the dough. Fry the pieces of meat well with a little lard and plenty of ground chile. Make a wrapper of clean corn husks six or eight inches long, lapping so they will thoroughly enclose an oblong roll two inches in diameter. Tie one end

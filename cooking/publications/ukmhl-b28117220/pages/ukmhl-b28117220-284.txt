Scrape out the soft portion of a dozen figs, rejecting the skins; rub this to a paste. Cut the thinnest slices possible, from a loaf of either white or brown bread ; butter and remove the crusts. Spread over the paste, roll the bread carefully, pressing for a moment until there is no danger of the roll opening. Then roll it in a piece of tissue paper, twisting the ends as you would an old fashioned motto, or it may be tied with a piece of baby ribbon. lettuce sandwich. Butter thin slices of bread, cover one slice with a crisp let- tuce leaf. Spread the leaf with mayonnaise dressing and lay on the other side of the sandwich. Mrs. George Sinsabaugh.

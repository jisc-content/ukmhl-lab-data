CHAPTER XXI. CANDIES. The materials used in the home manufacture of the finest quality of so-called French candy are neither expensive nor difficult to obtain. Aside from sugar, the basis of all confec- tions, these materials consist chiefly of flavors and colorings. These can be procured from your druggist or grocer. The basis of cream nuts, chocolate drops, buttercups, cream bars, cocoanut drops and many others is “fondant,” or, in other words, granulated sugar creamed. TO MAKE FONDANT.

Try the syrup by dropping into a cup of cold water; when it can be rolled into a ball, it is done and should be taken instantly from the fire and the kettle placed in a large vessel of cold water; now fla- vor with one tablespoon vanilla. While it is still warm—not hot—stir the mass briskly with a wooden spatula or paddle, always stirring in the same direction, until it is perfectly white and of a soft, creamy texture. Let the stirring be brisk and uninterrupted in order that the syrup may not granulate. After the sugar creams, turn it out on to a sheet of tin, or a cake board, and knead as you would dough or bread. When it is worked until perfectly smooth, the cream is ready for use, and should be put into an earthen jar and covered with a damp cotton cloth and closely covered. It will keep for weeks, and can be sliced like butter. CHOCOLATE CREAM DROPS. Balls the shape and size of small birds’ eggs are made of the fondant, and when they are hardened (which will be in

MEAT AND EISH SAUCES. 89 sauce. Mix the yellows perfectly with a little salt and vinegar; turn very regularly and always the same way, while you pour in little by little ten large spoonfuls of very fresh olive oil and one of vinegar. If well made, the sauce becomes thick and nearly white. Mustard and “fines herbes” chopped very fine may be added according to taste.

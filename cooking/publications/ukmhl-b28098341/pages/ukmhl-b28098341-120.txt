Well beat your eggs; add to them six ounces of pounded and sifted loaf-sugar, a glass of brandy, a glass of white wine, and sufficient flour to make it a very stiff batter. Have a quart of milk warm from the cow poured upon it while you continue beating; and when it is well frothed, put it into a buttered dish; place it in a quick oven, and bake it for a quarter of an hour. Serve immediately. BITTER-ALMOND CUSTARDS. Boil two or three bitter almonds in a pint of new milk; gradually add the yolks of four eggs, beaten and strained: remove the almonds, and either boil or bake the custards. CODLIN PIE. Put some small codlins into a glazed saucepan, lay vine-leaves over them, and add enough water to cover them: place them by the side of a very slow fire; keep the steam from escaping, and when they are nicely greened, take them out, arrange them in a dish with plenty of powdered loaf-sugar; put a rim of paste round the dish and a top of light crust."

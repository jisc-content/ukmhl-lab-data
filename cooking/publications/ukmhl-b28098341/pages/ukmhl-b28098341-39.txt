FEBRUARY. 87 venial sin of tasting soup at Easter is visited by the infliction of a cold in the head for a whole year after, how much more terrible must the retribution that awaits the bad-living wretch who wilfully and deliberately abstains from the time-honoured dish, ordained for this day! And nest to the fate at- tending those who are insensible to the importance of eating pancakes, may the severest misfortunes befal all who bring them into disrepute by preparing them badly ; for though I have called pancakes golden- hued, and tender, and savouiy, they are oftener so hard, so heavy, so scorched and greasy, that con- scientious gourmets are fully justified in declining to touch them; and the reason of this proceeds from the persistence of English cooks in indiscriminately making, use of both whites and yolks of the eggs, instead of the yolks only, which should alone be employed; besides this, they persevere in frying our pancakes in butter or dripping, and do not care much whether this boils before putting in the batter. Now, next to lard or oil, a French friture should be preferred for frying pastry ; this should be made by melting down equal parts of the loin fat of beef, pork, and veal, straining it off and keeping it in jars until wanted.

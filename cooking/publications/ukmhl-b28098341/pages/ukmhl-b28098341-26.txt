24 EVERYBODY’S PUDDING BOOK'. half a pound of butter or lard to one pound of flour will be sufficiently rich for family purposes—these being either mixed by first working in a portion of the butter with the greater part of the flour, then adding a very little water, and finishing by rolling out the paste very thin and applying the remaining butter and dredging in the rest of the flour, then folding it up and rolling it until of the necessary thickness; or, most of the flour may be made into a very stiff paste with a little water and the beaten white of an egg, afterwards repeatedly rolled out and buttered and dredged with flour until the requisite weight of each be employed. For very light crusts, a small quantity of sugar is added, and more butter is allowed—sometimes in an equal proportion to the flour; but in making paste for fresh fruit tarts no sugar should be used, as the steam rising and con- densing in cooking makes the crust eat limp and tough. Eemember, for all kinds of bakiug, the heat of the oven should be what the French call gay, but on no account violent. And now, since we cannot be profuse in our em- ployment of eggs this month, we will select only those puddings and tarts in the composition of which eggs either do not enter, or are at least but sparingly required.

Boil the rest of the lemons in a good deal of water until quite tender; heat and rub them through a sieve; add them to the other ingredients ; pour in half a pint of white wine; let it simmer by the fire for an hour; then gradually mix it with the beaten yolks of four eggs and the whites of two; strain it into a tart-dish edged with a rim of puff-paste, and bake for twenty minutes. DATE PUDDING, BOILED. Soak six sponge-cakes in sufficient cream to moisten them; then take four ounces of fresh dates freed from their stones, cut them into thin slices length- wise ; add them to the sponge-cakes with two eggs, a little grated lemon-peel, and two ounces of pounded loaf-sugar. Mix the whole together; put it into a buttered basin, and boil it for an hour and a half. SNOW PANCAKES. When the snow is on the ground it may be advan- tageously employed for pancakes instead of eggs.

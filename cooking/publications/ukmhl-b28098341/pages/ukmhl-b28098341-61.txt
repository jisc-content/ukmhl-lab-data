Beignets are a neat little dish, something similar to fritters, only that the fruit employed in tho composition of beignets, instead of being minced or sliced thin, is cut into rather thick pieces and soaked in warm brandy before being dipped into batter. Beignets d’orange are made thus: carefully tear off the peel, and with a sharp knife cut the oranges into tolerably thick slices; take away tho pips, and lay the fruit to soak in brandy placed in a saucepan upon the hob. Then prepare a batter by mixing enough flour with half a pint of milk to form a light batter; add the white of an egg beaten to a froth, and a dessert-spoonful of brandy. Drain your slices of fruit, dip them into the batter, and fry them

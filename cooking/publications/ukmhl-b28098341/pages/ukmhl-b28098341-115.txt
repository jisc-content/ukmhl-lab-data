In backward seasons black currants are plentiful until nearly tbe middle of August. Stem your fruit, but you need not top them. Line a pudding-basin with a light paste ; strew sugar over it; then put in your black currants; add more sugar and a teacupful of cider, or an apple or two sliced thin; cover with a top crust; tie a cloth over it, and boil for two hours. N.B. Never put water with fruit puddings or pies: lemon-juice, grape-juice, or cider is admis- sible, but water should on no account be used. H

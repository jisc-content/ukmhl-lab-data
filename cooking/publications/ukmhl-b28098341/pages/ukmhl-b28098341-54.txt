CUSTARD FRITTERS- Beat the yolks of four eggs with a dessert-spoonful of flour, a little nutmeg, salt, and brandy; add half a pint of cream; sweeten it to taste, and bake it in a small dish for a quarter of an hour. "When cold, cut it into quarters, and dip them into a batter made with a quarter of a pint each of milk and cream, the whites of the four eggs, a little flour, and a good bit of grated ginger; fry them of a nice brown; grate sugar over them, and serve them as hot as possible. LENT MINCED PIE. Take the yolks and whites of four hard-boiled eggs; shred them fine ; add to them three or four apples pared, cored, and chopped small, half-a-pound each of dried currants and raisins stoned and cut up, two ounces of sugar, a quarter of a pound of mixed candied-peel, and the juice of two Seville oranges. Stir the whole well together; line a dish with a puff- paste, lay in your mince, cover it with a top crust, and bake for three-quarters of an hour in a gentle oven. If preferred, you can make it into small pies, and bake them for twenty minutes.

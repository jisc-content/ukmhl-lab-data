Pour it into a dish, and serve. A little spice may be added if preferred. This is the ordinary manner of treating gooseberry fool; but the more elegant way is to half fill small china or custard cups with the plain sweetened fruit- pulp, then put in a thick layer of raw cream, and strew powdered spices thickly on the top. Serve as you would custards. RASPBERRY FRITTERS. Take the crumb of a penny-roll grated, add to it rather less than a pint of boiling milk : when this is cold, mix with it the beaten yolks of four eggs; sweeten it, and stir in sufficient fresh raspberry- juice to turn it an agreeable pink colour. Drop small spoonfuls of this batter into a pan of boiling lard, and, when done, stick them over with sliced blanched almonds.

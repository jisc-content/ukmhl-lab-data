AUGUST. 123 YORKSHIRE PUDDING. This pudding is usually baked in front of the fire under roasting-meat; but it may be done in an oven as other puddings. Take three eggs and three table- spoonsful of flour, a glass of brandy, and a little sugar; beat these together for a quarter of an hour, then gradually add a quart of new milk, put it into a square tray, lay some bits of butter upon it, place it in a quick oven, and as soon as it is well browned on the top, cut it into square pieces, turn them, and when done, arrange them in a dish well covered with sifted loaf-sugar. GIPSY PUDDING. Cut some thin slices of stale bread; spread one side thickly with jam of any kind; pack them into a buttered tart-dish, and pour over them the yolks of six eggs beaten up in a gill of French brandy. Bake for twenty minutes, and sift sugar over it before serving.

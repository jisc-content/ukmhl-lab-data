OCTOBER. 137 cinnamon; pour it over the bread, and when nearly cold, beat three eggs and pour into the dish. Bake for half an hour in a moderately-heated oven. MARLBOROUGH PUDDING. Line a tart-dish with a very thin paste ; then take one ounce each of candied lemon, orange, and citron peel, sliced exceeding thin; lay these at the bottom of the dish; then melt over the fire six ounces of butter; add six ounces of powdered loaf-sugar, the yolks of four eggs well beaten, and a dessert-spoonful of orange-flower water : pour these ingredients over the sweetmeats, and bake for three-quarters of an hour. BLACK CAP PUDDING. Take a pint of new milk; mix into it by degrees three tablespoonfuls of fine dry flour; strain and simmer it over the fire until pretty thick; then add two ounces of butter ; let it grow cold, and stir in the yolks of four eggs beaten and strained, and half a pound of currants washed and dried. Put it into a well-floured cloth; tie it tight; place it in boiling water; move it about a little to prevent its settling, and boil it one hour and a half. Serve with sweet sauce poured over it.

JUNE* 87 JUNE. Ok oranges and lemons, and preserves and grocersâ€™ fruit, we are now almost independent, for the cur- rants are beginning to turn red, and the raspberries are ripening, and the good old gooseberries are full grown, and if we call anything in aid besides our own fresh fruits, it is merely for the sake of present- ing a variety; and cheesecakes and custards are never to be despised, especially when set off by a cherry tart or gooseberry pie. Some epicures too are averse to acids; and although a raspberry pudding or a gooseberry fool may be pronounced ambrosia by some, there are others who assert them to be the most objectionable edibles ever introduced. This proves that all our prejudices should be consulted by the considerate caterer; and it is gratifying tc. know that our gardens and larders are at this time so replete, and the resources of cookery so diversified and unlimited, that, by paying attention to the dif- ferences of taste, every one may be pleased with the provisions set before him.

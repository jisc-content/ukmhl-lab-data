44 EVERYBODY'S TUDDING BOOK. ORANGE CUSTARDS. Boil tlie rind of half a Seville orange until it is perfectly tender; take it up, and beat it smooth; add to it the juice of a Seville orange, a tablespoonful of the best pale brandy, four ounces of pounded loaf- sugar, and the beaten yolks of six eggs. Whisk all well together for ten minutes, then by degrees pour in a pint of boiling milk. Keep heating until it is cold, then put the custard into cups, and place them in a shallow pan of boiling water to set. Stick some very thin pieces of candied orange chips over the tops, and serve either hot or cold. BREAD PUDDING, BOILED. Put a pint of new milk into a saucepan, place it upon the lire, and stir in four ounces of fresh butter; as soon as this is melted, throw in as much grated white bread as will make it pretty thick: add two ounces of sugar, a little salt, ginger, and nutmeg, four beaten eggs, and a spoonful of rose-water; when all is well mixed, put it into a buttered basin and boil it for half an hour. Serve with any sauce pre- ferred. Two ounces of sultana raisins or cleaned currants may he added to this pudding if approved of.

Cover a pie-disk with a rich paste; then take twelve hard-boiled eggs, lay them in the dish, throw in half a pound of butter cut up, and half a pound of well-cleaned currants: heat up four eggs in half a pint of white wine, sweeten it well, pour it in, put on a top crust, and bake it for half an hour. RATAFIA PUDDING. Boil two or three laurel-leaves in a pint of cream; then take them out, and stir in a quarter of a pound of butter, a quarter of a pound of grated biscuit, a glass of white wine, a little nutmeg and a sufficiency of sugar. Take it off the fire, cover it up, and when nearly cold, put in two ounces of blanched sweet- almonds and the yolks of four eggs. Mix all well together; put it into a dish, and bake half an hour. GREENGAGE PUDDING OR TART. Take some greengage plums, not over-ripe : do not stone them, but lay them either in a basin lined, or pie-dish edged, with a rich crust; add a good quantity of white sugar, cover with a top crust, and boil or bake for an hour and a half.

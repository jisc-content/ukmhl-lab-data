JUNE. 97 CHERRY PUDDING. Pull your fruit from the stalks, and put it into a pudding-basin lined with a very rich suet-crust; strew in plenty of sugar, pour in a glass of brandy, cover it with a top crust, tic it down, and boil it for two hours. Separately whisk half a pound of fresh butter and the yolks of eight eggs until both form a snow, then beat them together, add a quarter of a pound of pow- dered loaf-sugar and a gill of brandy; line the inside of a tart-dish with a very thin paste, pour in the pud- ding, arrange some citron-chips on the top, and put it into a pretty quick oven for twenty minutes. N.B.â€”This pudding, as well as most of those which have an under-crust, should be either lifted or turned out of the baking-dish to be served. FRENCH PRUNE PUDDING.

139. OCTOBER Remember, whether for tarts or for preserving, never put spices with quinces. POTATO SUET PUDDING. Take a pound of mealy potatoes boiled and mashed smooth; add four ounces of chopped beef-suet, three eggs, a little milk, sugar to taste, and a good dessert- spoonful of powdered ginger. Put it into a well- floured cloth and boil for an hour. Serve, turned into a dish, with saffron or sweet sauce poured over it. CRANBERRY TART OR PUDDING. Take half a pint of cranberries, pick them from their stems and throw them into a saucepan with half a pound of white sugar and a spoonful of water ; let them come to a boil; then retire them to stand on the hob while you peel and cut up four large apples; put a rim of light paste round your dish; strew in the apples; pour the cranberries over them; cover with a lid of crust, and bake for an hour. For a pudding, proceed in the same manner with the fruit, and boil it in a basin or cloth.

FEBRUARY. 47 and mix with six well-beaten eggs : tie it in a floured cloth, and boil it for three hours. POUND PUDDING. Take half a pound of fresh butter, and an equal weight of sugar: beat the butter to a cream, then add six very well-whisked eggs, half a pound of flour, four ounces of currants, two ounces of candied lemon-peel shred fine, and a little lemon-juice. Beat all together for a quarter of an hour; put it into a buttered mould, and boil it for two hours and a half. CHOCOLATE TART. Well beat the yolks of six eggs, add to them two dessert-spoonsful of flour, half a pint of new milk, two ounces of sugar, the fresh-grated rind of a lemon, a teaspoonful of powdered cinnamon, and a quarter of a pound of the best French chocolate scraped smooth. Put all this into a saucepan, stir it over the fire until it gets pretty thick, then let it stand until cold. Line a tart mould with a thin puff-paste, lay in the pudding, beat up the whites of the eggs to a very high froth, put them on the top, and bake for twenty minutes. When done, sift sugar over it, and glaze it with a salamander.

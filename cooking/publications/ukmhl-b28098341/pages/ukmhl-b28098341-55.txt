MARCH. 53 AMBER TART. Beat a quarter of a pound of fresh candied orange- peel until it is a paste; put it into a saucepan in which you have melted a pound of very fresh butter; add three quarters of a pound of finely-powdered loaf- sugar ; stir all together, then put in the well-beaten yolks of twelve eggs. When sufficiently thick, pour it into a tart-mould lined with a light paste; put a cover of crust over it, and bake it in a slow oven for forty minutes ; when done, lift it out of the dish, and serve it either hot or cold. EGG PIE. Take a pound of either marrow or fine beef-suet chopped small, twelve eggs boiled hard and minced, a little beaten cinnamon and grated nutmeg, a pound of currants, washed, picked, and dried in a cloth, two or three spoonsful of cream or new milk to moisten it, a quarter of a pound of powdered loaf-sugar, and a glass of brandy. Mix it well together, and put it into a dish lined with a puff-paste, bake it for an hour or forty minutes, according to the heat of your oven, and, when done, squeeze in the juice of a lemon, and pour a little cream upon the top. This is best if eaten hot.

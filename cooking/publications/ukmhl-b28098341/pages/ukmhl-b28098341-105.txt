103 JULY. FRENCH RASPBERRY TART. Choose a pint of very fine ripe raspberries, either red or white; stem them, and throw them into a boiling syrup, made with a quarter of a pound of loaf-sugar and a tablespoonful of water; withdraw them immediately from the fire; line a tart-dish with a puff-paste rolled as thinly as possible; lay in the fruit and syrup, observing to keep the raspberries as whole as possible; put it into a quick oven for twenty minutes; strew more sugar over it, and glaze it; or, if to be served cold, pour raw cream over it. RIPE GOOSEBERRY PUDDING. Scald a pint of ripe gooseberries in very little water; when tender, mash them in the liquor in which they were boiled; pulp them through a sieve, and add to them the beaten yolks of four eggs, a quarter of a pound of sugar, and a quarter of a pound of blanched sweet almonds lightly chopped. Mix all very well together, and bake it in a pie-dish edged with a rim of puff-paste. Half an hourâ€™s bakina will do it. Serve with cream.

It is a great mistake to put spices with fresh fruit of any kind—a few cloves or a little mace tend rather to augment the insipidity than to refresh the flavour of even apples and pears; of course an exception is made in regard to fruit fools, which generally require spices. EOSE CUSTAEDS. Take six ounces of dressed beetroot; pound it in a mortar until perfectly smooth ; add enough rose-water to make it pass through a sieve; strain into it the whites of three eggs, beaten, and a pint of thick cream; stir it over the fire until sufficiently thick; then serve in custard-cups or in a glass dish. EICH EICE PUDDING, BAKED. Well wash half a pound of Carolina rice; swell it in water until tender ; let it cool; add to it a quarter of a pint of cream, the yolks of five eggs and the whites of three, half a pound of marrow, a glass of brandy, half a pound of currants washed and picked, a quarter of a pound of sugar’, and a dessert-spoonful of ratafia. Mix the whole well together ; put an edge of crust round your dish; lay in the pudding, and hake in a moderate oven for forty minutes.

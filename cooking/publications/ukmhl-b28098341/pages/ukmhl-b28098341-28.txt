Line the rim of your pie-dish with puff-paste, then pare, core, and cut up half a dozen apples; mix them with the juice of a lemon and a little of the grated rind, half a pound of cleaned currants, a quarter of a pound of white sugar, and a quarter of a pound of sliced fresh butter; lay this into your pie-dish, cover it with a delicate thin crust, and bake it for an hour. CURRANT FRITTERS WITHOUT EGGS. Take half a pint of mild Scotch ale, gradually stir flour into it until it forms a tolerably thick but smooth batter. Beat it up veiy briskly, and add an ounce of cleaned and dried currants. When your frying-pan of boiling lard is ready, put in a spoonful at a time here and there until the pan is covered with fritters; shake them that they may not catch, and when they are beautifully browned on both sides, take them up and serve with lemon-juice and sifted white sugar.

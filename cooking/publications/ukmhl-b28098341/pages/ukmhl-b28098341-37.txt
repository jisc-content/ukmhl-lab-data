b 0 JANUARY. THE PORTLAND PUDDING. Well beat the yolks and whites of four eggs, add to them one tablespoonful each of flour and sugar, a pound of raisins, and a pound of veal-suet: mix the whole well together; put it into a buttered basin; tie it well down with a floured cloth, and boil it for five hours. Serve with sauce poured into the dish. COMMON CURRANT DUMPLINGS. These are made with some plain suet-paste into which are sprinkled some cleaned dried currants, in the proportion of two ounces of currants to a pound of paste : too many currants make the dump- lings heavy. Boil them half an hour.

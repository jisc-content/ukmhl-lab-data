OCTOBER. 135 OCTOBER As autumn comes round, the calls upon ortr hos- pitality daily press more and more heavily upon us; and now, in the hunting month of October, it seems that our whole thoughts should he devoted to the entertainment of not only those whose pheasants, hares, and partridges dignify our tables, hut the less fortunate of our friends, who only own to a very distant acquaintance with these aristocratic eatables. In October every oneâ€™s appetite is in good order; and whether our convives consist of the proverbially hungry hunter, or more soberly-inclined bodies, we have the satisfaction to find that at this season ample honour is done to the provisions we set before them.

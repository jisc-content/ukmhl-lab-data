AFRTL. 63 APRIL. Spring is coming to us once again ; already the ver- dant fields rejoice our sight, and enricli tlie quality of tlie milk, cream, and butter which lend perfection to those puddings that we presently enjoy, while the blooming fruit-trees give gracious promise of many a pleasant pudding for us in prospectu. And not alone upon horticultural assistance do we need de- pend ; the hedge-row flowers and garden vegetables will likewise contribute to extend our resources for stimulating and gratifying our epicurean predilec- tions; for notwithstanding it may appear to some a downright heresy for us to pervert the blossoms of the earth to culinary uses, and it may be imagined that one must be hard pushed for a pudding when reduced to descend to the vegetable creation for the requisite materials, yet from its vernal prestige there is really quite a sentiment attached to cowslip pudding; and as to tansy fritters and spinach tarts, they may successfully compete with any preparation the art of cookery has ever produced.

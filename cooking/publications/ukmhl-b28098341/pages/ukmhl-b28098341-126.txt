EVERYBODY’S rUDDIMG BOOK. 124 SEPTEMBER. The commencement of the shooting-season naturally suggests to the epicure the interesting question of what pudding goes best with game ? The answer generally is, that almost any pudding may be satisfac- torily introduced when game has once made its appearance upon our dinner-tables. However, as we all have our preferences, I may as well acknowledge that in my opinion few things follow each other with more agreeable propriety than does a bread pudding succeed a brace of roasted partridges. Some people may pronounce in favour of a pippin tart, others make choice of pumpkin pie or damson pudding; but I still maintain that there is something in the simplicity of a bread pudding, which accords better with the con- dition of satisfaction in which the palate is left after partaking of game, than any more savoury or appe- tizing composition yet propounded by cook or gour- met. Next to a bread pudding I would recommend —by way of contrast to dessert fruits which are now so plentiful—a macaroni, sago, pearl barley, or many other equally desirable puddings which are to bo found in the menu of the month.

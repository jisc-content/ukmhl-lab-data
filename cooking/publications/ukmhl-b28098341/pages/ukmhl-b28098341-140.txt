everybodyâ€™s budding book. 138 BULLACE, OB HARVEST PLUM PUDDING. Line a basin with a good pudding-crust, not too thick; put in your fruit with plenty of sugar, and a teacupful of cider. Cover it with a crust, and boil it for two hours. If you have honey instead of sugar with any kind of plum pudding, it makes it much more delicious. BISCUIT PUDDING, BOILED. Boil a pint of new milk; pour it upon three penny Naples biscuits, grated; cover it close, and when cold, add the beaten yolks of four eggs and the whites of two, a dessert-spoonful of flour, and sugar to taste: boil it for one hour in a buttered basin, and serve with egg sauce. QUINCE TART. Choose your quinces quite ripe, peel and cut them into quarters, but do not core them ; put them into a jar with some sugar and sufficient grape-juice to pre- vent their being diy. Place them in an oven, and let them do slowly until tender, then line your tart- dish with a rim of paste; put in your fruit and syrup; cover it with a top crust, and bake for forty minutes.

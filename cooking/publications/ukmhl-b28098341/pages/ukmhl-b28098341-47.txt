FEBRUARY. 45 HASTY FRITTERS. Make a light hatter with half a pint of fresh mild ale and sufficient flour : add a few currants or chopped apples; heat it up briskly: have some very hot fri- ture in a frying-pan, drop in the hatter, a spoonful at a time, turn the fritters with an egg-slice, and, when browned on both sides, lay them in a dish, throw sifted loaf-sugar over them, and serve gar- nished with orange cut into slices and quartered. THE BUCKINGHAM PUDDING. Chop a pound of suet very fine, add to it half a pound of raisins stoned and halved, two eggs, a little nutmeg and ginger, two spoonfuls of flour, and the same of sugar. Mix these ingredients together; put the pudding into a well-floured cloth, boil it for four hours, and serve with wine-sauce. THE PRIOR S PUDDING. Beat half a pound of fresh butter to a cream; add two eggs, beat these also; then gradually mix in half a pound of flour, two ounces of sugar, and a little nutmeg. Put it into a small basin, tie it down, and boil it an hour and a half. No liquid is required in this pudding.

112 everybody's Iâ€™UDDING book. AUGUST. Already tlie summer tide is ebbing gently; but although the days are palpably decreasing, our appe- tites and our digestions proportionably improve: and wliat inexhaustible attractions the season pos- sesses ! The full-flavoured fruits of August are of the richest and the most mellow kind: the many- coloured plums are in their prime, and fragrant apri- cots, savoury greengages, juicy pears, painted nec- tarines, blush-cheeked peaches, and bland, unctuous figs, appear in all their pomp at our desserts, while the fruits of humbler growth, such as apples and late cherries, are left to be on active service as entremets upon our dinner-tables ; and the almost total disappearance of winter fruits from our stores gives us full leisure to apply ourselves to the enjoy- ment of the produce of our own gardens: and in the agreeable asperity of our English fruits we find wherewith to refresh our palates, in readiness for the more cloying fruits of other countries, which very soon will be consigned to our shores.

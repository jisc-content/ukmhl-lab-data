The Art of Preparing Vegetables for the Table 6 upon one vessel amongst many the artistic care that is possible in the case of the experimental cook, who is chiefly bent on scientific recreation.

When rain water is used soda is not wanted, and in fact will do more harm than good. Certain white vegetables quickly change colour during the cooking process, and in such cases a simple course of procedure suffices to preserve the colour without damage to the vegetable. Take blanched Cardoons for an example. When boiled in water containing soda, although they were white when they went into the pot, they will be black when they come out. The way to prevent this is to throw them into water in which there is a little lemon juice, and let them remain until required for the pot. Then squeeze a few drops of lemon juice into the boiling water, taking care not to use any soda, and the difficulty is conquered.

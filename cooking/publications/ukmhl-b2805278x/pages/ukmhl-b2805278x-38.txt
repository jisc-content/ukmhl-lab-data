The Art of Preparing Vegetables for the Table Instead of boxes a couple of long and very wide boards stood on edge and supported from the outside make a convenient and effective trough. The packing of the roots with soil can be commenced at one end and be gradually extended through the entire length until the part first used is ready for a fresh start. Breaking the leaves is better than cutting, and it may begin about three weeks after the roots are stored. From well- grown specimens heads may be obtained equal to a compact Cos Lettuce, and by a little management it is easy to maintain a supply from October until the end of May. The quantity of salading to be obtained from a few roots is really astonishing.â€™ The full-grown but unripe Cobs of Maize or Indian Corn make a dish which is comparatively un- known in this country, although it is much esteemed by the few who are familiar with it. The Cobs must be taken before the seeds become hard. Remove the sheath and fibres, and plunge into boiling water with salt, and keep boiling for twenty minutes ; then try them, and, if not done, give them a few minutes more. When sufficiently cooked, drain, and serve on toast, with a tureen of melted butter. The flavour is pecu- liar, and by some is likened to Asparagus.

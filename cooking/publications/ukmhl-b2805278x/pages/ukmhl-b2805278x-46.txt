The Art of Preparing Vegetables for the Table 36 J^ETTUCES Lettuces are easily prepared as salads, but care should be taken not to steep them in water for any length of time, for this destroys their flavour and ex- plains why hotel Lettuces are frequently unfit to eat. When Lettuces are obtained fresh from the garden, and are quite free from vermin, they need not be washed at all. Cut through the stump and remove with it all the coarse outer leaves, and the blanched interior will be found so dry and clean and whole- some-looking that it will be sheer folly to allow water to touch it. A cook who was famous for his salads declared that he had learned many things by observation, but there was nothing he so valued of his practical wisdom as the using of all saladings without washing unless it was absolutely needful, as of course it frequently must be. Take a Lettuce from the ground, wrench off the outer leaves and eat the interior as it is, and you have a real delicacy. Take another, trim it, pur it in water for half an hour, and then taste it and note the difference. It is customary with cooks to steep Lettuces, Celery, and other saladings for hours, and even for days, until they have no more flavour than paper shavings. For stewing, Cabbage Lettuces are preferred, as they are also for a dressed salad. Having trimmed away all the coarse parts, stew them in good brown gravy, and finish as recommended for Endive.

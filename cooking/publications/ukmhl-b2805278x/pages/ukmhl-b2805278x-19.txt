The Art of Preparing Vegetables for the Table 9 13 may also be boiled with Silver-skin Onions and served with a good white sauce and a few freshly cooked Brussels Sprouts dotted amongst them, after the sauce has been poured over them. This vegetable requires careful cooking, as it is ■always eaten in a critical spirit, and when well dressed , ^:the cook will be sure of a reasonable amount of praise. If it is necessary to keep Asparagus a few days before cooking it, stand the stalks upright in water in narrow •vessels, such as common beer-jugs. If put in open bowls, the stalks will be at an angle and the tops will bend towards the light, and will not look well when cooked. But Asparagus cannot be too fresh, and no more should be cut at one time than can be used at once. . Prepare by scraping the stems from the head downwards; shorten them to one length, and tie them in convenient bundles. Boil quickly, with the lid off the pot, until quite tender, which will be in about ten minutes when the heads are fresh, or fifteen minutes if they have been cut a day or two. Dish on toast that has been dipped in the water, and serve with white sauce. There are many variations of the process. One consists in standing the bundles upright in a somewhat narrow pot, and then putting in sufficient boiling water (with the usual allowance of salt) to about half the depth of the Asparagus. Then start the boiling with the lid on the pot. By this method the stems are softened and the tops are cooked in the steam only.

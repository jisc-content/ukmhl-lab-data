The Art of Preparing Vegetables for the Table trifle underdone than a little overdone, but better still if perfectly done, tender, fragrant, full of flavour, and as green as grass. Serve without any sauce w hat- ever. Any gravy that is passing will suit them, but they may be served with melted butter, or with plain butter shaken amongst them and a slight sprinkling of pepper added. Cabbage Greens, or Collards as they are commonly called, furnish a very delicate dish. In flavour they are immensely superior to the finest matured hearts of Cabbage, no matter how quickly these may have been grown. Collards are as much a test dish as Potatoes, and one of the first that a young cook should learn to manage. Even old shop Greens may be served up in perfect colour and flavour by an experienced cook, while the freshest and most delicate Greens ever grown will be but trash unless handled with skill. Only decision and smartness of action are required, for the actual cooking is the simplest matter in the world. But the slow stewing process will not do. Given a poor fire and a careless cook, and Cabbage Greens will have no temptations. Trim the Collards so as to remove the coarse out- sides, and split the stumps if they are sufficiently large to require it. Boil them quickly with salt and soda until quite tender, then drain and serve hot without any flavouring whatever. Young Greens will need only ten to twelve minutes of fast boiling

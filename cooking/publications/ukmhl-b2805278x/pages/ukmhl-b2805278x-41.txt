The Art of Preparing Vegetables for the Table P UCUMBERS Cucumbers require careful handling by the cook, but they are of great value and may be used in a variety of ways. To serve as a salad, pare a suffi- cient portion, beginning at the flower end, for all Cu- cumbers are bitter near the stalk, cut in thin slices, and then just cover with a mixture of equal parts of salad oil and white vinegar, with a very little pepper and salt. By paring only as much as is to be cut up, the remainder can be saved for future use, but it would soon become worthless if peeled and then put away. Cucumber may be added to any soup or stew, and is especially good in a rich haricot. Cut in thin slices and add at the last moment; boil up for a few seconds only, and the dish may then be served. If the Cucumber is cooked for any length of time, it will melt away. This may be allowed in the case of a haricot, as the flavour will be there if the slices are no longer visible. A few thin slices boiled up in a light clear soup make an elegant variation, and will be welcomed as a change. A substantial dish of Cucumber and eggs may be prepared as follows : Cut a Cucumber into thick slices and slightly dust with flour on both sides, put these into a stewpan with a little good stock, minced Parsley, and a lump of sugar, and let them simmer for a quarter of an hour, then add a dessert-spoonful of pounded white sugar, the yolks of two eggs, and a little salt and pepper, and one dessert-spoonful of vinegar and half that quantity of Worcester sauce ; 3i

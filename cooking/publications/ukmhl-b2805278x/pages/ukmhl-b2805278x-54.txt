The Art of Preparing Vegetables for the Table 44 of late years to renounce the use of Mint in cooking Peas, for the reason that with such fine Peas as are now commonly grown in gardens Mint is an intru- sion, and tends to disguise rather than enhance their proper flavour. With the first early Peas, perhaps, we must continue to employ the established adjuncts, and we will proceed to cook a dish of these. They are to be fresh gathered and not to be shelled until wanted, and when shelled they are not to be washed. We must have a pot containing just enough boiling water to cover them, for to boil them in a large quantity of water in the way of a Cabbage or Cauliflower is a mistake. The water must be salted as usual, in the proportion of a dessert- spoonful of salt to every quart, and there should be added the same quantity of moist sugar. There must be no soda, for that is ruinous to young Peas. When the pot is fast boiling throw in the Peas, and keep it boiling with the lid on. You may add a few picked leaves or a bunch of Mint at discretion. If Mint is not handy Savory may be substituted, but on this point we give no positive directions, our business being to turn out the Peas as green as grass and with as much of the proper flavour of Peas as possible. The use of sugar in a moderate proportion does certainly tend to maintain the true flavour of Peas, for, like salt, it prevents the escape of their juices. Rut Mint is an added flavour, and it is a matter of taste whether it is used or not. For our own part we prefer Mint in all cases except when we have very fine Late Marrow Peas, and then we think we are best off without it.

The Art of Preparing Vegetables for the Table 30 texture, and requires rather less boiling than a com- mon Cabbage, but otherwise it may be dealt with in the same way. Various kinds of Cress come into the hands of the cook for several purposes. If they are not young and fresh they are worthless. In our large towns these articles must, as a rule, be purchased, and as regards Water Cress there is no objection to buying it ; but other kinds that have been cut, packed, marketed, and then retailed, often reach the consumer in poor condition. When derived from the garden all the kinds are useful, and more especially Water Cress and Australian Cress. Cresses are often thrown into water and left some time to be ready for use, but it is bad practice. They can be much better kept in loose bunches, standing in large jam-pots or common beer- jugs, with the stems in water. At the last moment they should be picked and rinsed and sent to table with some of their proper crispness and flavour in them. An excellent spring salad may be made with equal parts of Corn Salad and Water Cress, taking care to throw out all stalks and stumps. A tiny touch of the flavour of Mint will be an improvement, but it is not necessary. In the dressing there should be nearly twice as much oil as vinegar, but not a drop more of either than the vegetables will absorb. When there is any accumulation of liquor at the bottom of the salad bowl, it is a proof that the salad was not dressed with perfect skill. RESSES

If quite tender, serve ; if not, give them a few minutes’ more cooking. We allow butter and cream in this dish as a proper complement of flavours—in other words, a proper harmony. But on the score of health we much prefer to omit them, for greasy Mush- rooms are indigestible, and a very piquant dish may be made by stewing the buttons in good gravy with sufficient flour to thicken, a little nutmeg to flavour, and, if needful for a finish, a dash of Worcester sauce. Many people who have suffered through eating Mush- rooms were more indebted to the grease than to the vegetables for the unpleasant consequences.

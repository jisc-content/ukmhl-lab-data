The Art of Preparing Vegetables for the Table 35 for about an hour and a half, then add a few small Onions, or large Onions minced, and cook again for - an hour, then add butter, pepper, and salt, and serve in their own thick sauce. j^NOL OHL OR JCoHL ABI (See Turnip, page 66.) j^EEKS Leeks are cooked in a variety of ways, and per- haps the best way is to stew them in good gravy, as recommended for large Onions. Leek soup is made by boiling in weak stock half-a-dozen or so of Leeks, with all their green tops and outsides cut up rather small, and about double their bulk of green Pea shells, for about an hour. Then thicken with oat- meal, flavour with pepper and salt and a very little sugar; boil up and strain, and it is ready for the table. For a party of tourists or yachtsmen, Leek soup makes a capital beginning to a dinner, but is too rustic and substantial for the epicure, who should be kept in complete ignorance of its delectable qualities. Leek milk is often prescribed for a cold, and no doubt is a proper medicine. Cut up the Leeks, using green tops and outsides (all perfectly clean, of course), and boil in milk until it becomes quite thick. There should be no flavouring added, not even salt.

The Art of Preparing Vegetables for the Table 21 as may be needful to prevent burning. Now remove the cover, and keep the vegetable stewing while you add one tablespoonful of pounded loaf sugar, and the like quantity of vinegar, and a flavouring of Worcester sauce, with pepper and salt. Stir well about, and keep it boiling for a few minutes, and then serve on a dish with some selected pieces of pickled Red Cab- bage or Beet as a garnish. If properly cooked it will be thick, glutinous, and very savoury. pAPSICUMS AND j^HILIES These are of much greater use to the cook than is generally supposed. Home-made Cayenne may be depended on for wholesomeness, whereas the pur- chased article is sometimes adulterated with deadly drugs. A few drops of Chili vinegar added to a soup or ragout will brighten the flavour far more effectually than grocerâ€™s pepper, however good. To prepare Chili vinegar, put any kind of Capsicums or Chilies into strong vinegar in the proportion of one ounce to a quart, cork close, and place it in the storeroom. At every reasonable opportunity shake the jar or bottle, and at the end of a fortnight strain off the vinegar and throw away the refuse ; then bottle securely for use. Chili vinegar should be made fresh every year, because it does not retain its fine qualities for any great length of time, and, if carelessly bottled, becomes worthless very soon. But with proper care it will keep a year, and is invaluable.

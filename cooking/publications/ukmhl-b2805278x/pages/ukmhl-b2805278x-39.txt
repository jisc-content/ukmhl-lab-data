The Art of Preparing Vegetables for the Table 29 ALAD Often in early spring Corn Salad is of the greatest value both for salads and to cook as Spfinach. The plant being cut over in green tufts and slightly trimmed, makes a most elegant salad with the usual dressing of oil and vinegar, in which the oil should predominate to bring out the singularly pleasant flavour of the vegetable. When boiled as Spinach, it should be chopped up with butter and flavoured with a very slight dusting of grated nutmeg. Corn Salad has yet to be appreciated as it deserves. This plant supplies us with a good Cabbage and a good imitation of Asparagus or Sea Kale, the first in the head of the plant, the second in the midribs of the larger leaves. The cook may considerately advise the gardener to grow this excellent vegetable on his best ground, because fat stalks are wanted, and when well grown they are tender and delicately flavoured. To prepare the stalks or midribs is easy enough, but they should not be made ready until the moment has nearly arrived for cooking them, for they suffer deterioration if kept for any length of time in water. Cut them in convenient lengths, tie in bundles, and boil fast, with a liberal allowance of salt and very little soda, for about fifteen minutes. When quite tender, drain and serve with melted butter or a thick savoury brown gravy. The top cabbage is loose in OUV RONCHUDA

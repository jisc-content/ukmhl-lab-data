34 \ The Art of Preparing Vegetables for the Table 1 he white beans are usually employed, but coloured Kidney Beans answer equally as well, though they are less agreeable in appearance. To serve them plain it is necessary to put them to soak in water overnight, and to allow fully two and a half hours for cooking them ; put them in a pot, and just cover with cold water and let them boil up, then draw them aside and keep them simmering, occasionally looking to see that they do not burn, to prevent which, add a little water as may be needful, taking care not to add too much. To finish the cooking properly, the water should not be poured off, but be allowed to dry away until the beans are found swimming in a thick sauce of their own making. Add a lump of butter and a liberal allowance of pepper and salt, boil up, stirring the while, and when quite thick dish them for the table. Managed in this way they are delicious and thoroughly digestible, but if too much water is used the sauce will be poor and thin, and the cooking, so far, a failure. ,To serve them dry, simmer with water and salt, and a lump of butter, until quite tender, then pour off the water, but do not drain them, carefully stir them round with more butter, and pepper and salt, and then put them on the fire again to thicken what little liquor remains, and before they burn dish them. The mode of serving them in their own gravy may be varied by adding a little minced Parsley and the juice of a lemon, after which boil up and serve. Another useful mode of treatment consists in soaking them as advised and stewing them in stock

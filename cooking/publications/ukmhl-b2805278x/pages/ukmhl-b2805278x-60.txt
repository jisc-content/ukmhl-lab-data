In the first place, then, secure a melter, such as the Regent, if it is convenient to steam them in their jackets; or a firm but floury Potato, if they must be sent to table out of their jackets and by the boiling process. Having cooked a certain number, the object should be to keep them hot as long as possible without spoiling. They should not touch porcelain until they are to be put upon the table. They may remain in hot iron pots a long time with a thick white cloth over them and the lid down without any serious harm, but from the moment Potatoes are put into porcelain dishes they begin to deteriorate, because the steam that they give out cannot escape, and is of course again absorbed.

The Art of Preparing Vegetables for the Table 33 pared as follows : Take the best parts only of the blanched vegetable and boil in water, with salt, for ten minutes, then drain and chop fine, and put it into a stewpan with a little stock, and flour enough to thicken it, and about a dessert-spoonful of pounded sugar ; let it simmer five minutes, adding a little more stock if there is danger of burning ; when quite tender, add the juice of a lemon and boil up once and serve. At least six heads of Endive will be required to make a dish. A very little grated nutmeg is allowable as a final flavouring. In this country Garlic is so little used that the men- tion of it may appear superfluous ; but as the Con- tinental masters of cookery employ it freely, we shall have to concede that it may possess some virtues. As a matter of practice Garlic may be used legiti- mately whenever and wherever Onions and Shallots are allowable; but the quantity should be small, the cloves finely minced, and the cooking should be the least possible. If Garlic is cooked for any length of time it becomes rank, but cooked for a few minutes only, the flavour is delicious. When added to a ragout, it should be put in with the Parsley and have only five minutesâ€™ cooking. ARICOT j3 E AN S The reason why Haricot Beans are not more fully- appreciated is because they are often badly cooked.

The Art of Preparing Vegetables for the Table 16 pORECOLES All kinds of Kale are cooked in the same way as Collards (or Cabbage Greens), but each separate sort requires somewhat different management, which a little experience will teach. Curled Kale is the most elegant of all the winter Greens on the table, and quite tender and delicious. Cottagerâ€™s Kale and others of the cabbaging class need to be cooked in plenty of water, or they may be a little rank. But these are all fine vegetables, and always better after having been touched by frost. pROCCOLI Broccoli require careful cooking, for if not well managed they are likely to be objectionable both in odour and flavour. Trim with care so as to retain enough leaves to hold the flower together and to form a green clothing. But, having these requirements in mind, remove as much as you dare of the outside, and then put the Broccoli in water head downwards, and add a good quantity of salt. In the course of half an hour or less all the vagabonds that have hidden themselves in the flower will have crept out and fallen to the bottom of the pan dead. Plunge the Broccoli into boiling water with the usual allowance of salt, but no soda, and boil fast for at least fifteen minutes, and then see how they are going on.

The Art of Preparing Vegetables for the Table 26 for it is not good to steep them in water before cook- ing. Having cut them into convenient lengths and tied in small bundles, boil them with a little salt until tender, which will be in about twenty minutes. Serve on toast with white sauce. When intended to be eaten as a separate dish, prepare a sauce of cream and pounded mace, which put over the fire until thick ; or, in the absence of cream, prepare a sauce as advised under Cauliflower, but flavour with mace instead of nutmeg. Celery may be stewed in stock, and when done thickened with cream and flour with a little pounded mace, and served in the gravy. In some households Celery soup is regarded as a great delicacy. To make it, shred two entire and per- fectly clean plants into a saucepan, together with the remnants of a fowl, a few slices of lean ham, and one quart of stock. Simmer for three or four hours. Clarify the soup with the white of an egg, and strain it nicely; then add some small prime pieces of blanched Celery which have previously been boiled in stock until they are tender. When served as a salad, Celery must be carefully trimmed and washed, and so cut that it can be drawn out of the glass in convenient portions, for often one gets too much, and it is not an easy matter to return it when once taken. Another point of importance is not to prepare it too soon, for if kept in water any length of time the delicate flavour is very seriously diminished.

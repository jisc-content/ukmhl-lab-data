Another weak point is using them too old, for they can hardly be too young if fairly well grown. When quite young, cook them whole with the rind on, and about a quarter of an hour of fast boiling will be sufficient. Then take them out and let them drain and press them slightly. Cut them open and take out the seeds, and, if necessary, remove the rind also, but this is really needless with very young Marrows.

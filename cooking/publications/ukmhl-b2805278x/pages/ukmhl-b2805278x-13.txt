The removal of dirt is not the onl) object of washing, for it is needful sometimes for the dislodgment of vermin such as earwigs, caterpillars, and slugs. We will take a Cauliflower or a Cabbage in which there may be lurking some small intruder. Throw into a pail or bowl a lump of salt, fill up with cold water, and, if necessary, add a little hot water ‘ to take the chill off,’ and then plunge the vegetable into it. In a short time the caterpillars and slugs will generally wriggle out. Between boiling and stewing there is a vast differ- ence, which the cook should thoroughly understand. To serve a dish of greens of any kind with a beautiful colour, a fresh appetising fragrance, and a flavour that shall gratify all palates, there must be a little briskness in the cooking. The pot should contain plenty of water, a reasonable quantity of salt—say two tablespoonfuls (equal to two ounces) to the gallon— and, if need be, a very small quantity of soda.

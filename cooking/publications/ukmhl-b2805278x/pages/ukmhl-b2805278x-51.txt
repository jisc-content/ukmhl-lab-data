The Art of Preparing Vegetables for the Table employed they give life to every dish that contains them. Large Onions may be melted down for a most delicate dish by simply trimming them slightly and putting them in a pot with a lump of butter and keeping on the hot plate or half over the fire for about a couple of hours. By that time they will be melted through and ready for the table without any more cooking. A few of the outer coats being removed, the interior will be found in a state of the highest perfection, with all the proper flavour of an Onion and all its fine healthful qualities. Stewing in water or stock is a less perfect method, but will generally suit those who can condescend to eat a cooked Onion. Remove a few of the outer coats and cook in a small quantity of water or gravy until quite tender, which may be in from one to two hours, then mix about a teaspoonful of flour with a dessert-spoonful of Worcester sauce, add a good piece of butter, boil up three minutes, and serve. If this is nicely managed, the Onions will be quite tender and floating in a thick and savoury gravy. If cooked in plain water, it is only necessary to drain off the water and serve. Whenever Onions are boiled to be served as a dish, only one or two of the outside coats should be removed, for if severely stripped they lose a great part of their flavour and with it the best of their wholesome properties. But when used in stews they must be stripped freely, and the coats that are removed may be put aside for flavouring when bones are boiled

The Art of Preparing Vegetables for the Table 27 j^HlCORY If stewed and served with melted butter, Chicory bears a slight resemblance to Sea Kale. Its chief value, however, is for use as a winter or spring salad, or for eating in the same manner as Celery with cheese. It is so wholesome and delicious that very soon Chicory will be regarded as indispensable. The preparation of the roots involves no difficulty whatever, but as the process does not appear to be generally understood, we quote the following particulars from the third edition of ‘The Culture of Vegetables and Flowers from Seeds and Roots,’ by Sutton & Sons.* * In autumn the roots should be lifted uninjured with the aid of a fork, and only a few at a time as required. After cutting off the tops just above the crown they can at once be started into growth, and it is essential that this be made in absolute darkness. French growers plant in a warm bed of the tempera- ture suited to Mushrooms, but this treatment ruins the flavour and has the effect of making the fibres woolly. It is far simpler and better to put the roots into a cellar or shed in which a temperature above the freezing point may be relied on, and from which every ray of light can be excluded. They can be closely packed in deep boxes with light soil or leaf- mould between. If the soil be fairly moist, watering will not be necessary for a month, and had better not be resorted to until the plants show signs of flagging.

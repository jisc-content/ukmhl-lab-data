The Art of Preparing Vegetables for the Table 15 and the rich crimson colour makes it very tempting in appearance, especially when presented in some of the shapely forms for which cutters are specially made. There are advocates for the pickling of Beet in a raw state, but many persons find it as unendurable as pickled Cabbage, and for the same reason—their nerves are shocked by the uncooked vegetable. An- other objection is that after the bottles are fastened down the Beet continues to absorb the vinegar. To save the pickle from ruin, filling up has to be resorted to again and again, until frequently the operator’s patience is worn out before the thirst of the Beet is satiated. Boiling the roots is preferable to baking, but the time need not be quite so long as for roots intended for immediate consumption, because the hot vinegar will help to complete the cooking. One hour or an hour and a half will suffice for large roots, and three-quarters of an hour for those of medium size. Thoroughly cleanse them without cracking the skin, and put them into smartly boiling water. In a separate vessel, boil the requisite quantity of white wine vinegar flavoured to taste with salt, mace, ginger, and a few shreds of horse-radish. The roots must be promptly skinned, cut into thin slices, and put into small jars which will not succumb when the hot vinegar is poured into them. Fragments of Beet from the cutter need not be wasted, but can be pickled sepa- rately. Do not fasten down until quite cold, and keep the jar thoroughly air-tight. When once opened the contents must be used quickly.

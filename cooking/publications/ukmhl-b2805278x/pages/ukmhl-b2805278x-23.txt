The object of cutting them across is to keep the seeds in them, for as the green shell becomes tough with age the ripening seed acquires a fine flavour, and when cooked is as tender as the yolk of an egg. j^EET â€”ROOT A Beet-root requires to be carefully handled, because, like a bottle of wine, all the goodness runs out the moment you crack it.

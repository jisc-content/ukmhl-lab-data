But melters give no trouble in the steamer, and therefore the cook who cannot make time to manage melters in one kind of pot has but to consign them to another, and allow a longer time for the steaming process. There are several sorts of Potatoes that eat well but do not look well when cooked. A little manage- ment will help them very much to present a respectable appearance.

The Art of Preparing Vegetables for the Table 53 a hot dish, and score the surface to give an artistic finish. It is not wise to mould or to brown this dish, for appearances are in this way gained at the expense of the digestion. Potatoes well mashed are delicate and wholesome ; Potatoes moulded and browned lose their flavour, and in some degree their wholesomeness. Too much cooking is as great an evil as too many cooks. The perforated implement for rendering mashed Potatoes light and granular is so eminently successful that the result may not inappropriately be described as Potato Flummery. Certainly the dish does look very tempting, and there its merits end. Serve two dishes of mashed Potatoes, one in the fashion recom- mended above, the other passed through the perfor- ated masher, and each diner will be able to determine whether appearance or utility shall be king. J\ADISHES Radishes are somewhat indigestible when full}' grown, but when quite young are suitable for the most delicate digestion. When employed in salads a very few minced or thinly-sliced red Radishes will suffice to give colour and flavour ; if used in too large a pro- portion, they render the salad coarse. An agreeable way of using them is to lay a few very young scarlet Radishes on the top of the salad as a garnishing, and let those have them who choose. Then the well-dressed salad can be eaten without them, to the advantage perhaps of the seniors at the table.

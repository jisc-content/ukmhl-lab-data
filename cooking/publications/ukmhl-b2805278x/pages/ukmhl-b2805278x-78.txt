The Art of Preparing Vegetables for the Table 68 pressed. Cut them smaller, if needful, for the table, and send up with plain butter or a tureen of good melted butter. If to be mashed, proceed as advised for Turnips, but they need not be beaten through a colander, for they are never fibrous as old Turnips are. Small delicate Marrows should be served on toast, but this is not advisable with large ones. Marrows make a good dish if boiled until about half done, then drained and cut into smallish pieces. Dip these in egg and bread-crumbs and fry in hot fat or butter to a* nice golden-brown colour. Very young Marrows may be sliced raw, the seeds need not be removed, and if brushed with egg and dusted with crumbs, and fried, will be found delicious and quite sufficiently cooked. Ripe Marrows may be cut for soups as required, in which case the rind and the seeds must be removed, and the slices put in the soup about half an hour be- fore the dish is to be served. When once a Marrow is cut, the whole of it should be eaten as soon as pos- sible, or mildew will make a quick end of it. Spottisivoode & Co., Printers, Ncw-street Square, London.

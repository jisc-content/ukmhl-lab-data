SOUPS, BROTHS, PUREES. 46 3. Throw away the water and put the ham, vege- tables, herbs, and the head, also the bones from the head (the brains must be taken out), into two quarts of cold water; salt, pepper, and cloves must also be put in. 4. Allow this to boil up, skim, and then allow to simmer five hours. 5. Take out the head, cut off some nice pieces to serve in the soup, and serve it separately either with parsley and butter or thick brown sauce. 6. Mix one ounce of butter and two ounces flour in a small stew-pan. Allow the flour to brown, then stir the thickening thus made into the soup, having strained out the bones and vegetables and taken off the grease. 7. Allow it to boil five minutes, and pour into the tureen over little squares of the head and the wine. 8. Serve forcemeat balls if liked with this soup, either in it or handed separately.

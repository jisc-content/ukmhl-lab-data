PREFACE. Believing that soup-making is but imperfectly understood by any but first-class cooks, I have deter- mined to bring out this small book of receipts for making it with such minute and clear directions, that the veriest novice in the culinary art cannot avoid a satisfactory result if she faithfully carries out my instructions. Middle-class housekeepers generally contend that soup is an extravagant luxury, but I maintain that is quite a mistake, for I know from long experience that a “ stock-pot ” in a household encourages thrift and prevents waste. All bones of cooked joints can be broken up and put into it; necks, gizzards, and hearts of the poultry, carefully washed beforehand, very much improve the flavour of ordinary stock, and which would otherwise probably find their way to the “ pig-tub; ” any little trimmings of cutlets, steaks, and the short bones that are sawn off the best end of a neck of mutton ordered for cutlets, &c., &c.

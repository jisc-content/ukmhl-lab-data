PREFACE. IX of cold water, with a little salt and a dozen pepper- corns, just brought up to the boil, and well skimmed. Then it should be allowed to simmer gently for from four to five hours. The meat should be carefully lifted out, put in a dish with a board over it on which a six-pound weight is placed to press the joint into shape. When the meat is cold, it must be trimmed neatly and thickly glazed with good beef glaze that is sold by all grocers. The water in which the meat was boiled makes excellent stock that can be reduced in quantity, and thereby increased in strength, by being boiled rapidly with the lid off" the saucepan, which with the addition of vegetables and herbs is quickly converted into good clear soup. A boiled rabbit occasionally is not bad eating, and the liquor used for cooking it can be added to rather flavourless stock with great advantage. A boiled fowl every now and then is appreciated, and a good housekeeper, with an eye to replenishing the soup supply, will do well to order one every now and then. A boiled leg of mutton, or even the best end of a neck, served with caper sauce, is liked by many people, and the water in which mutton is boiled is most useful reduced and added to other stock, or used, as it is, for broths, oyster soup, or any soups prepared with milk. It must not be thought that I am recommending housekeepers to be continually providing boiled meats with an eye to the “ stock-pot,” as nothing is more

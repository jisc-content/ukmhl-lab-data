vm PREFACE. I do not advocate a “ stock-pot ” being allowed to remain on the fire all day long, however, but think it should be clean and ready for use every morning, when all the pieces of bone and meat that can be spared should be put in it; then after lunch, when the kitchen fire is not much required for other saucepans, the bones and meat should be weighed and a quart of water allowed to every pound; this, with a little salt, should be boiled up, skimmed, and allowed to simmer not longer than six hours, during which time a little water should be added every now and then to raise the scum, which must be skimmed off or the soup made from the stock will be difficult to clear. The meat and bones at the end of this time must be strained off and the stock put in a clean, uncovered basin, and stood in a cool larder for the night, to be boiled up Avith vegetables next day and used as required for soups, aspics, gravies, &c., &c. In a large, and even in a small household, soup can be made regularly, and very good soup too, enough for a daily supply, without any extra expense at all, if a little forethought is exercised in ordering the daily supplies. For instance, what so nice for luncheon or breakfast as an occasional joint of cold pressed beef 1 Cooked as follows it affords five or six quarts of excellent stock. A joint of brisket of beef is required, weighing six or seven pounds, at seven pence a pound, best English beef. This should be put in six quarts

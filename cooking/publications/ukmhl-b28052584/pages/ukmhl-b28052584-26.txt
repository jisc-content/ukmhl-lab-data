SOUPS, BROTHS, PUREES. 22 with a little burnt sugar or a pinch of Crosse and Blackwell’s colouring salt. To Clear Soup with Raw Meat, No. II. Supposing the stock you wish to convert into clear soup is rather poor and flavourless in quality, it is better to use raw beef for the process of clearing rather than white of egg, proceeding as follows : Take half a pound to a pound of raw beef-steak (the quantity depends on the stock to be cleared, half a pound ought to clear a pint and a half), and mince it in a sausage machine, then take one carrot, one turnip, one onion, cut them in small pieces, and with the meat whisk into the cold stock, which must be put in a saucepan over the fire and brought slowly to the boil while the whisking continues. Just before the boiling point is reached take out the whisk, and when the liquor boils up remove the saucepan to the side of the fire for twenty minutes, strain very carefully and slowly through a thick cloth as many times as it requires for the soup to become perfectly bright and clear. N.B.—It will be seen in the foregoing receipts for stock that the proportion of meat to water is one pound to one quart. This ought always to be borne in mind when making stock; also in clearing stock

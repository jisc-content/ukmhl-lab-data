260 On Liqueurs, Ratafias, and Elixirs. a quantity of the cake for a long time in spirits of wine, is also a noxious ingredient. The almond- cake is used to impart to the adulterated brandy a taste resembling the kernel flavour which the genuine article possesses. The extract of capsicums and ex- tract of grains of paradise, known in the trade by the name of the devil, are also frequently used. The extract of capsicums is made by putting a quantity of the small East India chilies into a bottle of spirits of wine, and keeping it closely stopped for a month. The same process is followed in reference to grains of paradise, and they are both used to impart an appear- ance of strength. They infuse into the spirit, a hot, pungent, fiery flavour, which no one of good taste— no one, indeed, whose organs of taste were not vitia- ted by a long indulgence in ardent spirits—would at all relish. Colouring of burnt sugar is also had re- course to, to deepen the colour of the brandy ren- dered too pale by the preceding mixtures, and it is further employed to answer the same end with rum. Saffron, mace, terra japonica, spirits of sweet nitre, and prunes, are used to improve the flavour of brandy, and new brandy is made to look like old by the addi- tion of aqua ammonia;. On the German liqueurs I have not yet touched. The principal among these are the Pomeranzen, Wacklwlder, and the Kiimmel. The Pomeranzen is made by adding to a quart of spirits of wine ninety drops of oil of orange and a quart of the syrup.

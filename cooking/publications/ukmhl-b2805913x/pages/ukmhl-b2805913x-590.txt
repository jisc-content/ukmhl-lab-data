The best cheeses in France are those of Xeufchatel in Normandy, of Brie, which is much eaten in Paris, and above all, the Jromage de Roquefort en Rouergue, now called Aveyron. To my taste this is the best of all dry cheeses; it has some analogy with Stilton, but is much finer. Eoquefort cheese is manufac- tured in the village whose name it bears. Some portion of the excellence of this cheese is due to the cellars in which the straining; or refining; of the cheese takes place, and some portion to the peculiar manner in which the animals are milked; a process which is explained by M. Giron de Bazareinques. Roquefort cheese is made of a mixture of sheep and goat’s milk; the first communicates consistence and quality, the latter whiteness and a peculiar flavour. Roquefort cheese may be had in perfection at Corcellets’ Palais Royal, and at Morel’s in Piccadilly. Gruyere cheese is made in the canton of Fri- burg, in Switzerland, and in the provinces of Franche, Comte, Bresse, and Bugey. There is a cheese made in the Mont d’Or, in Auvergne, which has a high flavour. At large dinners in London, cheese is oftenest eaten in the form of ramequins, or grated Parmesan, and other preparations; but at small dinners the Stilton, the Roquefort, the Chester, the double Gloucester, or the Somersetshire cheese is invariably produced.

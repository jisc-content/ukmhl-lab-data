Ancient and Mediaeval Cookery. 21 Beauvais, of Cotentin and the Ardennes, were again, as under the old regime, cut up into cutlets, and the cooks soon appeared. Instead of serving as chefs de cuisine, butlers, intendants, and maitres d'Mtel, they now were called citoyens, pensionnaires, and rentiers; for there were no grands seigneurs to employ them. For a while there was some inconvenience, but a Frenchman sooner accommodates himself to circum- stances than any other human being, and such of the cuisiniers as had saved somewhat from the ship- wreck of the Revolution formed eating-houses, taverns, and restaurants. These establishments have since become the temples of good cheer and gour- mandise, in which wandering Englishmen spend and have spent millions upon millions of money; but it is an historical fact known to few, that the greater number of these restaurants owe their origin to the Revolution.* The complete overthrow of the French kitchen, the work of three centuries, might have been * Previous to 1789, says the “Almanack des Gourmands,” tom. i, p. 162, there were not one hundred restaurateurs in Paris. Now (in 1803) there are five times as many. Speaking at random and without book, there are at present 4000 or 5000, great and small. The author of the “ Almanack des Gour- mands ” falls into the strange mistake of attributing the in- crease of restaurateurs to an Anglomania. “ It is well known,” says he, “ that the English almost always dine at a tavern.” What inconceivable ignorance!

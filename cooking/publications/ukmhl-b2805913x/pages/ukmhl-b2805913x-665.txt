273 Ale, Beer, Cider, and Perry. requires that the liquor shall be light, brisk, sparkling, and agreeable. I have no means of knowing the number of brewers in Paris at present, but there were forty 120 years ago, who annually made about 75,000 muids of beer (the muid is 300 pints). Little more than seventy years ago there were but twenty-three brewers in Paris, of whom the revolutionary Santerre was the most celebrated in the Faubourg St. Antoine. On the 10th of August he became commandant of the National Guard; on the 11th of December, he conducted Louis XVI. to the bar of the National Convention ; and on the 21st of January, 1793, he commanded with Berryer the troops that were pre- sent at the execution of this unfortunate prince. It was the brewer Santerre who interrupted the mon- arch when he essayed to speak from the scaffold, and who caused his sovereign’s voice to be drowned by beat of drum. Santerre more than once showed the white feather, as the epitaph written on him proves: “ Ci git le General Santerre, Qui n’avait de Mars que la bierre.” That there are now as many brewers in Paris as there were a century ago may be well doubted. At the peace in 1815, a number of English and Scotch brewers went over, and entered into brewery specu- lations in Paris and the provinces; but the greater number of these were Avliolly ruined, and repented, when too late, of their short-sighted imprudence.

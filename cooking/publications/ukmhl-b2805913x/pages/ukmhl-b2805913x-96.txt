Chapteh VI. MEATS. “ EINDFLEISCH ’’—BEEF. 330. “ liindfleiscli zu Sieden ”—Beef to Boil. Ix Germany beef is almost invariably boiled with regard to soup ; and is used fresh instead of salted. Beat the piece of beef well; set it on the fire in cold water. Skim when it begins to simmer. Do not let it boil, or it will be hard. Simmer it from two to three hom-s, according to the size. When carrots and celery-roots are boiled with it, they require almost as long cooking as the beef. Herbs for seasoning should only be added half an hour before serving. Salt should be added when the meat is nearly done, as it hardens the beef when put in at fii-st. Prepare the soup ac- cording to any of the directions given under the respective headings of soups; and serve the meat either with horse- radish sauce, beetroot in vinegar, “ marinu-ter haringe,” or any approved hot or cold sauce. Cherries or plums, preserved in vinegar, are also serv-ed with the plain boiled beef. 331. “ Oxenfieisch zu Braten ”—Boast Beef.

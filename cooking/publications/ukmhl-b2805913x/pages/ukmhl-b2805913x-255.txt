In difierent localities several kinds of “Kuchen” are called “ Torten,” and these are as frequently called Kuchen elsewhere. Those about to be described hereafter have, with some exceptions, a tart paste for their foundation. They are baked in shallow tins, or on the large sheet tins used in the baker’s oven. These are covered with very thin tart paste, the edge of which is raised a little by moulding with finger and thumb. They are spread over with whatever they are named after, and when baked they are cut into square, oblong, or three-cornered pieces, as they are taken off the tin. The better kinds are baked in round tins with rims an inch deep. The following pastes are used.

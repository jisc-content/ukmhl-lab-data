MEATS. I2I “ SCHWEINFLEISCH PORK. 450. “ Schiceinsbraten ”— Roast Pork. Beat the meat well, rub it with salt and pepper. Score the skin with a shai’p knife rather deep; cross the scoring diamond-ways. Bake or roast it a pale brown, with frequent basting. 451. “ Nierenhraten ”— Loin of Pork. Score the skin each way, sprinkle it with salt, and when half baked, strew it with caraway-seeds. There must be enough water in the baking-dish to keep the fat from burn- ing. Baste it frequently. When done pour off the fat in the baking-dish; add water and salt to the brown gravy, and strain it. 452. “ Gefullte Scliiveinsrippe ”— Stuffed Ribs of Pork. Choose a young loin of pork. Have the bones jointed. Peel and quarter several sour apples, with which fill the pork. Skewer or sew it, that the apples cannot escape. Rub a little butter over the meat, and bake or roast it a pale brown. Then transfer the meat to a stew-pan ; add a cup of boiling water; cover and let it steam above two hours. Supply a little water as the sauce diminishes, and baste the meat frequently. Draw out the thread when dishing. Pour the fat off, and salt the gravy. 453. “ Sanrer Schwemebraten ”—Sour Roast of Pork. Any part will do for this. Take the skin off. Lay the pork in a salting dish. Strew over it a tablespoonful of salt, some sliced onions, a handful of sage-leaves, some thyme and basilicum, six cloves, a dozen juniper-berries, and a plentiful dusting of pepper. Pour over a small cup of vinegar. Let it lie a few days in this marinade, turning and basting it twice a day. When ready for cooking, lay the meat in a baking-dish, with its pickle and ingredients. Baste the meat several times with this, but, before the leaves or onions burn, take the dish out of the oven and pour in some hot water, rinse it round, and strain the gravy; add this again to the dish, and return it to the oven. Baste the moat often until well done, then take the fat off the sauce, and add more water if necessary.

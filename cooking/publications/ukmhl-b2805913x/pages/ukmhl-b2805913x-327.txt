COFFEE. 315 person, with water proportioned to the number of cups to be served. One good way of preparing the infusion easily, to ensure serving it hot, is to place a common coffee-boiler beside the fire to get well heated; put in this an ounce and a half of coffee, pour on it a pint of boiling water, cover instantly, and in a few seconds pour out a cup and return it twice, then leave it to settle. Meanwhile make the serving coffee-pot as hot as can be with boiling water before the beverage is poured carefully into it. Increase or diminish the above proportions of coffee according to the strength desired. Serve hot milk with it, or cream, excepting when Coffee noir is taken after dinner without either.

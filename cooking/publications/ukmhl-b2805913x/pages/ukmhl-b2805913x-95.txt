Let no one condemn this homely sauce without tasting it. Cut three or four ounces of streaked bacon into very small dice, and fry them in a stew-pan a pale colour but crisp. Beat the yolks of three eggs with a spoonful of flour, a small wineglass of vinegar, and half as much again water ; add a spoonful of made mustard, some salt and pepper. Put this to the bacon in the stew-pan, and stir it over the fire until thick and smooth. The bacon fat supplies the place of oil. When quite cold use it for potato or any other salad. It must be stirred while cooling. Should it be thicker than cream, thin it with a little vinegar and water, well stirred in.

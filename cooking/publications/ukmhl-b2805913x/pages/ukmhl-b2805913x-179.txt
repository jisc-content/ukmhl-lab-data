Chapter IX. “ KALTESCHALEN.” These refreshing preparations of summer fruits and other things might be acceptably substituted for pies and tarts at English tables, when pastry is objected to. It is difficult to give a nice translation of the compound word “ kalteschale.” Cold-bowl would neither sound well nor be expressive of what it is. We therefore advise our readers to pronounce the a in schale like our a in far and call it by its own old name. The kalteschale must be sent to table as cold as possible, either in a bowl, tureen, or glass dish. When wine is used, it should be thin claret or German white wine. Sherry has too distinct a flavour. 603. “ Apfelsinen oder Pomcranzcn Kalteschale ”— Orange Kalteschale. Rub off the yellow rind of six oranges with half a pound of lumps of sugar. Peel off the yellow rinds with a knife, and throw them into a pint and a half of cold water. Peel the white skins off, and slice the oranges thin, from the eye, as you would a lemon. Sprinkle the slices with powdered sugar, which must be strewn plentifully over them, in a china bowl or deep glass dish. Strain the water from the peels, and put the lumps of sugar to dissolve in it. Add to this the juice of three or four oranges and a bottle of light white wine. Pour it over the sliced oranges and keep it in a cold place till required. Servo with sponge-cakes or sippets of fancy bread.

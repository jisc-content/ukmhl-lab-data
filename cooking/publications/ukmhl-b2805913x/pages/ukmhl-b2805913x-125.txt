Beat the meat well; stick long slices of shalot all over it with the lard- ing-pin. Put butter in a baking-dish. Lay in the mutton, and sprinkle it with salt. Bake it in a moderate oven, with frequent basting, adding a little water now and then to the dish. When done, lake the fat off the gravy ; brown a little flour in butter, and add the gravy from the baking-pan to it. Or, rub a spoonful of potato-flour smooth, with water, and thicken the gravy with this, boiled a few minutes. 426. “ Hammelhraten 7)iit Kiiohlauch”—Roast Mutton ivith Garlic.

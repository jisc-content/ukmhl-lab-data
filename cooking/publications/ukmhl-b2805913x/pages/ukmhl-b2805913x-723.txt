On Wines, Ancient and Modern. 331 of wine for all seasons of the year. “ In the first place,” says he, “ there are the wines of Pomard, Beaune, and Volnay; then the white wine of Meul- sant; and lastly the Nuits qui n’a pas son pareil et ne pent etre assez prise.” It is the district of Nuits which produces the Bur- gundy called St. George and the Mprsault wines. Here, also, the curious wine called Mont Rachet is made of three distinct kinds of grape grown on the same aspect, with no ditference that can be discovered in soil; and yet, says Redding, one species is so good as to bring three times the price of the others. The wine produced at Volnay, a village situated about three miles from Beaune, was in Barry’s time, who wrote in 1775, exactly eighty-nine years ago, the finest and most volatile wine in Burgundy. In the year of a good vintage, there is no better wine of entremets than Beaune. It is of a fine red colour, has no noxious qualities, does not heat the blood like other crus of Burgundy, will keep a long time without spoiling, and will bear water carriage. I have drunk excellent Beaune in the remotest cor- ners of Hungary and Transylvania, in the heart of Poland, nay, even in the midst of Russian snows. It is a favourite wine both at Petersburg and Mos- cow, where great quantities are consumed, mingled with ice and water in the summer months. In order to drink Beaune in perfection, it should not, how- ever, be more than four or five years old.

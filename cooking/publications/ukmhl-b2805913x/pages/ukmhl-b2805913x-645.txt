The creme de vanille is not an unpleasant cordial, and is stomachic, and slightly stimulant. Ireland invented that horrid burning beverao’e called scuhac, shubach, or usquebaugh. This liquelr, called usquebaugh, or schubagh, had its birth in the sweet, clean, neat little town of Drog-he-da; or, as it was called in the time of Cromwell, Tredagh.

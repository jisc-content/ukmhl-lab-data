Lay them twelve hours in water, then wipe them dry. Have ready a perfectly clean small barrel, or un- glazed earUien crock, at the bottom of which put a layer of vine-leaves, sour cherry-leaves, and two or three walnut- leaves. Then lay in cucumbers, close together, with a leaf or two between them, and cover them with wild cherry-leaves ; then again cucumbers as before, with here and there a sprig of green dill and half a walnut-leaf. Over each layer of cucumbers put vine and cherry-leaves to cover them, and so on till the vessel is full. Make a weak brine of a handful of salt to the gallon of water. Pour this over the cucumbers, which must be quite covered with salt water. Put a cover and weight on the top, stand them in a warm place for a few days till bubbles begin to appear on the brine, then remove them to a cold and shady place.

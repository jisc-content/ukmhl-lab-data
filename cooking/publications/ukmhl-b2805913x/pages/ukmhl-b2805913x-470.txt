78 Dinners and Dinner-giving. entrees at the first course, and a couple of small roasts, a couple of removes, and a few entremets at the second course, and what can any reasonable man want in addition ? If tlie dinner be composed exclu- sively of English, let the remove be a haunch or saddle of mutton, a roast turkey and ham, a braized leg of mutton, a fillet or a sirloin of beef, and surely there is enough to create “ a soul under the ribs of death,” with the entrees of lamb, mutton, and veal cutlets, with fillets of pheasants, vol au vents hlan- quette, of sweetbreads and such like. In April, May, June, and July, fricassees of chickens, leverets, pigeons, fillets of rabbits, with quails, ducklings, turkey poults, and guinea fowls may be served for entrees and second courses ; while in August there is venison, grouse, and wheatears. In September, Oc- tober, November, and December, there are partridges, grouse, blackcock, golden plover, snipe, woodcock, wild duck, hare,and pheasants; while in the two last months of November and December, ox-tnil, mulliga- tawney, mock turtle, and glblet soups may do fre- quent duty, with turbot, crimped cod, haddock, and .brill for fish. For entrees in the winter months there may be pork cutlets, quenelles, mutton cutlets, rabbit curries, &c. T am now speaking, of course, of dinners of some pretension; but there are every day given in England those quiet little family dinners of six or eight per- sons, which are the perfection of social life.

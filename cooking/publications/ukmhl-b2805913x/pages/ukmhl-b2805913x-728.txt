336 On Wines, Ancient and Modern. two before dinner and placed in the dining-room, within the wake of a temperate fire. I go farther than most persons, and maintain that most red wines should not be iced. It maybe answered, that “ there is no wine more iced than Claret in all the Indian presidenciesbut this Claret so iced is not the pure juice of the grape. It is a loaded wine made for the market, which every genuine lover of Claret should abhor. It was the custom in the first society of Bordeaux, and always at the prefecture, in the days of Baron d’Haussey, afterwards Minister of Marine to Charles X., to serve Claret with a tepid napkin round the claret-jug or decanter into which the wine was poured, or round the green glass bottle itself, if, as indeed it more frequently happened, the wine was not decanted. This gentle heat brings out ad- tageously the flavour and aroma of the wine. As to the period of the dinner when Burgundy should be introduced, all I would say is this, that it should not be served later than the roast. A glass of Pomard, Nuits,or Chambertin,may be very well taken after the first mouthful of a good haunch of South Down or a Jilet de bceuf d la Poivrade is swallowed. Neither should I object to a repetition of the dose (whatever Lord Brougham, who contends for Claret after game, may say to the contrary) after swallow- ing a slice of w'oodcock, partridge, or that excellent bird, so justly bepraised, the golden plover; but to reserve Burgundy for the entremets, sucrh, or dessert.

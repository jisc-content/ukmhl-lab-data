26 Ancient and Mediaeval Cookery. Cour des Comptes as amounting to 6000 francs, or 240Z. of our money. A rare epoch in the history of cookery was the publication of the first number of the “ Almanach des Gourmands,” which appeared in the beginning of the year 1803, and which the late Duke of York called the most delightful book that was ever printed. The sale of this work was prodigious. 22,000 copies of the four first years were speedily disposed of, and the work subsequently went through new editions. As the book is very scarce everywhere, and not to be found in England, I may be pardoned for dwelling on it. Gastronomy became the fashion of that day. Every one spoke on the subject; many wrote on it. Cookery passed from the kitchen to the shop, from the shop to the counting-house, from the counting- house to the studies of lawyers and physicians; thence to the salons and cabinets of ladles and statesmen. The object of life, according, at least, to our simple English notions, seemed reversed: people in Eng- land eat to live; in France, they appeared to live only to eat. This was in consonance with French cha- racter and practice. To return, however, to the “ Almanach des Gour- mands.” Each volume contained an almanac for the year in which it was published, and a species of nu- tritive itinerary of the difterent traiteurs, rotisseurs, restaurateurs, porkmen, poulterers, butchers, bakers, provision, sauce, and spice shops, milkmen, oilmen.

Chapter IV. SAUCES. Where many sauces are required, it saves much time and expense to keep on hand the following “ Coulis,” or stock, which may become the foundation of, and be converted into, almost any sauce, taking the name of the chief ingredient added for its completion. 166. “ Braune Coulis ”— Brown Gravy Stock. Cut in small pieces a pound of lean veal or beef and half a pound of lean ham or bacon, both uncooked. Put them in a stew-pan with a quarter of a pound of butter, a carrot cut in slices, a root of celery and one or two of parsley, two or three shalots or an onion sliced, six cloves, and half a teaspoonful of pepper. Set these over a good fire, stirring occasionally till the whole begins to brown. Dredge in as much flour as the fat will absorb. Let this brown well; keep stimng that it may not burn; then add by degrees some plain broth and gravy, if you have any remains, to thin it. Cover closly, and let it simmer for an hour beside the fire. The stock must be thick as cream when done. Strain it through a sieve into an earthen vessel; leave it in a cool place, and take the fat off when cold. It will keep good two or three weeks in winter, and half the time in summer, if not covered closely, and if it is refreshed once or twice by giving it a boil. 167. “ Wcisse Coulis ”— White Gravy Stock Is made with veal, as above, excepting that the flour must bo added just as the gravy flrst drawn is beginning to turn yellow. Add clear broth before the flour has time to brown, and finish as directed.

CHAPTER XVII. COFFEE. I 'TER the dessert comes Coffee, and it is now fitting that I should make a few O remarks on the best means of making that agreeable and stimulating beverage. The coffee tree is a native of Arabia. The use of the berry extended itself to Mecca, Medina, and then to Cairo in Egypt. It continued its progress north- ward; and in 1554, under the reign of Solyman the Great, became known to the Inhabitants of Constantinople. The Venetians introduced coffee to the western parts of Europe. In 1644 it was brought to Marseilles, and in 1657 to Paris. Ac- cording to Le Gi'and Dâ€™Aussy, the custom of drink- ing coffee became general in Paris in 1669, through the example of Soliman Aga, ambassador of Mahomet IV. The coffee is an evergreen shrub, rising to twenty feet in height. The fruit is a round, fleshy berry, and great care is taken to conduct little rills of water in small channels to the roots of the trees.

INTRODUCTION. VI habit upon taste, as regards the table. We are, indeed, uncon- scious for how many things we like best in eating and drink- ing, our taste is an acquired one. Whoever began with liking pickles or pungent flavours of any kind ?—Olives, porter, claret, game gamey, mutton high, woodcocks’ trails, and many other delicacies ? In England, perhaps more than in any other country, we are apt to despise things to which we are unaccustomed; and, from reluctance to try strange flavours, many an excel- lent dish remains unknown to us. This reluctance, however, does not exist to the extent it formerly did; so many travel and bring home recollections of agreeable dishes which they would like to have produced at their own tables, but of the preparation of which they are ignorant. To supply this want, with regard to German cookery, and for the use of the vast numbers of Germans in England who have English cooks, this work has been compiled. I will conclude by observing that for the same expense at which ordinary family dinners are provided and served in England, or dinner parties given—with a little atten- tion to acquire the necessary knowledge, a little reflection upon what was yesterday and will be to-morrow, with the courage to defy mere routine, and to dare to be original— dinners may be served, attractive from novelty and very pleasing by their excellence and variety. It is hoped that this book on German National Cookery may assist in efl’ecting so desirable an object.

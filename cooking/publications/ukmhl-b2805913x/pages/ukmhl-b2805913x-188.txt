Chapter X. “ KLOSSE,” OK “ KNODELN.” (Various Little Light B.alls.) These purely national dishes claim a long descent. In England, instead of having refined on them, we have only had them handed down in the form of provincial dumplings, which are mostly heavy masses, evincing no relationship to the good old Saxon light and delicate klosse. Their chief ingredients were always eggs, bread, coarsely ground com, meat, and fish. In later periods, potatoes, rice, &c., have furnished varieties. No translation can be given of the names without depriving them of their traly distinctive qualities. 631. General Rules for Making Klosse. The bread used for them must be light, and without crust, either grated, crumbled, or soaked in cold milk or water. They must be lightly handled. Dip the fingers in water while forming them into balls the size of an egg, either egg- shaped or round. Lay them apart. Put them carefully into gently boiling soup, water, or milk. Wet the spoon as each one is dropped in. Chives, onions, parsley, or spice may be left out, and the flavour altered, in any of the recipes given. All klosse should bo served as soon as they are ready. Cold ones are good next day, sliced, dipped in egg, and fried. 632. “ Kartojfel Klosse"—Potato Klosse. Stir four ounces of butter to a creivm. Add by degrees three well-beaten eggs and three-quarters of a pound of grated potatoes, which must have been boiled some hours before.

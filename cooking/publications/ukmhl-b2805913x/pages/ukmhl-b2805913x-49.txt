FISH. 37 A little finely minced parsley, or a delicate seasoning of any favourite herb, may be mixed with the mass, but not as a mle. 132. “ Forellen ”— Trout. To boil these, as indeed several other kinds of fish, put vinegar, salt, sliced onion, bay-leaf, spice, and pepper into the water. Let this boil, to win the flavours; sot it aside to cool a little ; then lay in the fish and simmer slowly till done. Garnish, and serve with any approved sauce. 133. “ Forellen in Aspic ”— Trout in Jelly. Wash the trout carefully. Form them into rings with the tail in the mouth. Boil water as above, with a little vinegar, salt, a shalot, or clove of garlic, and any approved seasoning. When this is cold, lay in the fish, and simmer a few minutes after the water has just come to a boil. Take out the fish carefully, and, when drained, baste them with clear fish jelly. When the first basting has set, repeat another, until they have a nice coating of jelly. Then arrange them gently and garnish to taste. Any other fish, such as haddocks, whitings, smelts, &c., are good in this way. 134. “ Gebackene Hdringe.”—Fried Dutch Herrings. Wash them and cut ofif the fins. Lay them in milk to draw out the salt; then wipe dry and lay them in a little wine. Dredge them with a little flour; egg and crumb them ; and fry them in butter. Sauerkraut, potato salad, or potatoes in any foi-m, may be served with them. 135. “ Gebackene Fiische Hdringe ”—Fried Fresh Herrings. Clean and dry them thoroughly. Lay them open and draw out the bones. Grate bread and mix with the ci’umbs some pepper and a little nutmeg. Egg and crumb the fish, as also the roes. The herrings must have been opened along the under thin side, so that the back skin is not broken. Having proceeded as above, fold them together and fry them in very little butter. Egg and crumb the roes and fry them apart. Drain well before serving. Potato salad is excellent with these, or plain boiled potatoes and sour sauce.

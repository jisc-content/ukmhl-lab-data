On Fish. 154 furnishing occasion for the epigrams of Martial, and the scathing satire of Juvenal. Red mullet is only prime during the warm weather, and is best done en papillote. It may also be done en caisse aux fines herbes, a Vitalienne, and a la Cardinale, but in no way is it so good as en papillote. Mullet should never be drawn ; it is sufficient to take out the gills, as the liver and trail are the best parts of the fish. When we know that Apicius spent £60,000 to vary the taste of sauces, we can well believe that a sum of £240 was given in the olden time, at Rome, for three mullets of a large size. I will only speak of two other fishes, the john- dory and the lamprey. The john-dory is finest on the western coast of England, and is best plain boiled. Quin, the actor, a great gourmand, was remarkably fond of this fish and red mullet, and used to go down to Exeter for the purpose of eating them. One morning after his arrival in the west, his valet came in to call him as usual. ‘‘Well, John, any dory in the market?” “ No, sir.” “Very well; I’ll lay a-bed to-day. You may call me this time to-morrow.” There are two kinds of lampreys—the marine lamprey, found at Worcester and Gloucester, where it is dressed and preserved, to be heated up with a wine. The other, the lampem, is found in the Thames from October till March. The lamprey is in the best condition in April and May. Receipts

Chapter XIII. PRESERVES—“ EINGEMACHTE FRUCHTE.” 990. It is unnecessary to detail here those methods of preserving fruits which are the same everywhere, especially as the rules given in the following recipes may be applied to every kind. In many parts of Germany earthen pans are preferred to metal for boiling down fruit. Season them first; always use loaf sugar ; moist is apt to ferment. For most kinds of jam, the fruit and sugar maybe put on the fire together ; three-quarters of a pound of sugar to each pound of fruit. Keep it stirred continually till boiled down thick and smooth. When quite cold, tie over the jars. The narrower stone jars, holding from six to a dozen pounds, are best for keeping large quantities of family preserve. Fill them quite full; let them stand a night; then, without break- ing the jelly on the top, cover them a good half-inch thick Avith moist sugar, and tie them over. Paper will do, instead of bladder ; keep them cool and dry. For the finer preserves, clarify the sugar as follows. 991. “ Zucker zu Ldutern ”— To Clarify Sugar. Break up the requisite quantity of sugar in large lumps, allowing three-quarters of a pound to each pound of fruit. Dip each lump into oold water quickly, and put it into the preserving-pan. The quantity of water absorbed by the lumps in dipping will he right for boihng. Watch carefully that it does not boil over. When it has come to a boil, let it simmer slowly, and be ready with a cold spoon to check it whenever it begins to rise. When it forms little heads, it is boiled enough.

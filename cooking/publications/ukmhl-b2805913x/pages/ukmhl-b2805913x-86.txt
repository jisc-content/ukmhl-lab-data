Chapter V. SALADS. 286. Geixeral Rules. Fresh salads ought not to lie long in water; the withered only long enough to crisp them. The outside leaves are thrown away; the inner' ones parted, well rinsed, and examined, thrown into a cullender or salad-basket to drain, and thence into a napkin held by its four comers, and shaken lightly until it absorbs the water hanging about the leaves. Handle the salad as little as possible in cutting. Do not mix it with dressing until the moment of serving; and then it is usual to put the liquids at the bottom of the howl, and stir up at table. Salads of fish, meats, or potatoes are better made half an hour before they are used, excepting such as are mixed "with leaf-salad. Let chives or onions be handed apart when used, not mixed in. All salads may he garnished in a variety of ways, to give them a nice appearance, with such thiugs as beetroot, fresh and pickled, cut in stars or other thin slices, small, tufted watercress, thin rings of hard-boiled eggs, nasturtium leaves and flowers, fresh cucumber thinly sliced, radishes, &c. These aiTanged with taste, but not entirely covering the salad, have an enticing effect. 287. Vegetable Salads. Every kno^vn vegetable is, in Germany, when cooked plain, used cold for salad. The above rules for garnishing are applicable to all. They are cut up, when cold, according to taste, and the plainest dressing is of oil and vinegar, salt, pepper, and any approved herb.

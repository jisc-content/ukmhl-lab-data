SAUSAGES. 317 1126. “ Gerducherte Brat Wiirste''—Smoked Sausages, Mince the pork fine, and to every six pounds of pork allow a pound of fat bacon, chopped apart, and not so finely minced as the fresh meat. Season with salt, black pepper, and a little saltpetre, in the proportions given in No. 1117. Moisten the meat with a sprinkling of cold water. Mix all well. Fill the skins with a proper-sized funnel, and if any air spaces appear prick them with a needle. Hang the sausages in smoke a few days, more or less, according to the strength of the smoke. 1127. “ Frankfurter Brat'Wurste ”— Frankfort Sausages. Frankfort sausages are made with any parts of the pork as it comes to hand, fat and lean together, finely minced. Season with salt, pepper, a little nutmeg, and some ground coriander-seeds, as much in proportion as the pepper. Use a little red wine to moisten the meat as you mince it. Fill carefully prepared skins of either the pig or sheep. 1128. “ Schudbische Brat Wiirste ”—Su'alia7i Sausages. Shoulder, side, or any part of the pig will do, fat and lean, just as it is. Mince the meat to a paste. To every twelve pounds allow five ounces of salt, an ounce of black pepper, a quarter of an ounce of saltpetre, and half an ounce of garlic pounded to a pulp with a spoonful of water. If the garlic is new a little less will do. Eub it quite smooth, so that not a morsel of substance remains ; then add a spoonful or two of water, and sprinkle the meat with it when the mincing is half done; mix the salt and pepper and strew them in also at this time. These sausages are excellent either boiled or fried, to be eaten hot or cold; and are also especially good smoked and boiled. 1129. Mecklenburg Brat Wiirste"—Mecklenburg Sausages.

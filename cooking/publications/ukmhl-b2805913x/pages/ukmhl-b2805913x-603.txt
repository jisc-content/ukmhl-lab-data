Dr. Roques thus speaks of asparagus in his “ Observations sur les Plantes usuelles :—“ The as- paragus grows naturally in the woods, in the hedges, in the sea-sand, and on the banks of rivers. The ancients knew and cultivated asparagus. Athenaeus speaks of field and mountain asparagus; he says the best are those which grow naturally, without being sown. Martial, Pliny, and Juvenal also speak of asparagus. The Romans especially esteemed those of Ravenna. Nature, says Pliny, wished that asparagus should grow wild so that they might be gathered every where by everyone; but being improved by cultiva- tion, the blades astonish by their thickness. They are sold at Ravenna at three to the pound.” In Covent Garden Market, in the season, it is very common to find asparagus so fat that six weigh a pound.

Quicker than asparagus is boiled, became a proverb among the Romans.* Juvenal mentions a large lobster sur- rounded with asparagus, and promises, in the eleventh satire to his friend Perseus, a plate of mountain * “ Yelocius quatn asparagi coquuntur.” Suet.

Half a pound of flour, the yolks of four eggs, a little salt, sugar, either nutmeg or gi-ated lemon, and cream or milk enough to give a rather thick batter; must be briskly and well stirred. Then add the whites of the eggs, whisked to a snow; about two ounces of butter must be made quite hot in a stew-pan, and into this pour the batter, over a brisk fire. Cover, and let it remain till a nice brown crust has formed at the bottom, of not too dark a colour. As soon as this encrusting takes place, break up the scbmarn with a little iron spatula or fork, and let it sot and brown again; then break it up smaller by tearing it lightly apart, and serve it without delay. If salad is to he served with schmarn, leave out any flavour- ing of nutmeg, &c., if disapproved of, as also the sugar. To the above schmarn either cream, stewed prunes, or fruit-syrup may ho added at table.

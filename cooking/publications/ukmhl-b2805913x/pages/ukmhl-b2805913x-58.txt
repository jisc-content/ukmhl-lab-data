GERMAN NATIONAL COOKERY. 46 Two dozen of good-sized crayfisli will be found enough for half a pound of butter. 164. “ Sardellen Butter ”— Sardine Butter. Wash a dozen of sardines quickly in cold water. Scrape off any scales and take the bones out. Pound the prepared fish in a marble mortar, with a piece of fresh butter, adding by degrees more and more butter, until half a pound is mixed in. Add a little cayenne pepper and some salt, and work into a smooth paste. The sardines in oil, which are imported in small boxes or bottles, need not be washed; merely scrape off the scales and take out the bones. Ample salt must be added with the caj'enne pepper in the pounding. Press the paste into a jar or into small potting-pans. Sardine butter is excellent for sandwiches, or spread on toast, to be handed after the soup at dinner. 165. “ Anchovis Butter”—Anchovy Butter May be prepared in the same way as sardines, and is equally useful. A very little ground mace may be added with the cayenne pepper if.approved.

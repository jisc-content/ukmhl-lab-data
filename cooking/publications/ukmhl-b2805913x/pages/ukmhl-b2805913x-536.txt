144 How to clean and boil Fish. fish beyond what is necessary for cleaning, and by perpetual watering, diminish the flavour. "When quite clean, if to be boiled, some salt and a little vinegar should be put into the water to give firm- ness ; but cod, whiting, and haddock, are far better if a little salted, and kept a day; and if it be not very hot weather, they will be good for two days. Fresh-water fish has often a muddy smell and taste: to take this off, soak it in strong salt and water after it is nicely cleaned; or, if of a size to bear it, scald it in the same compound; then dry and dress it. The fish must be put into the water while cold, and set to boil very gently, or the outside will break before the inner part is done. Crimped Fish should be put into boiling water, with salt; and when it boils up, pour a little cold water in to check extreme heat, and let it simmer for a few minutes by the side of the fire.

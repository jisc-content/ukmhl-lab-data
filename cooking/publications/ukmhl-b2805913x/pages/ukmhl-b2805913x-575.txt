Nonius says, “ Egre gi^ alunt et bonum succum corpori suppeditant.”* Some writers, such as Athenasus, -ZElian, and Aris- totle, would have us believe that turkeys were known to the ancients under the name of Meleagrides, but this is a mistake. It is a nice question when turkeys first appeared in France, and who first introduced them. La Mare, in his “ Traite de la Police,” would have it that it was Jaques Coeur, the treasurer of Charles VII.; but this is also an error. According to Champier, who wrote his treatise “ De Re Cibaria,” in 1560, they were only introduced into France a few years before he wrote. Here are his words:— “ Venere in Galllas, annos abhinc paucos, aves quae- dam externae, quas gallinas indicas appellant: credo quoniam ex Insulis Indiae nuper a Lusitanis His- panisque palefactae, primum invectae fuerunt in urbem nostrum.” In the French poets of the thirteenth century, and in authors still more ancient, there is frequent men- tion of capons. Madame de Sevigne speaks of the “ poulardes de Can,” and of the “ bonnes poulardes de Rennes.” In Regnard’s “ Comedy du Bal,” a.d. 1696, the author speaks in praise of “ les poulardes de Caux.” Long—nearly a century—antecedent to this, our *“Ludovici Nonni Dieteticon," Antverpiae, mdcxvi.

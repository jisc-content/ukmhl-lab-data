Chapter XIV. ESSIGE.—VINEGARS. 1057. “ Ohst Essifj''—Fruit Vinegar. Apples, pears, or any other juicy fruit, must be well crushed with a stamper, and put in a suitable tub. On two bushels of fruit, pour four gallons of boiling water. Stir well, and let it stand in a warm place a week, skimming off the impurities whenever fermentation rises. Then strain the whole through fine, strong linen, pressing the pulp. Put the juice in a barrel, stir in a pint of yeast, and throw in a piece of bread. Let the cask be quite full; put the bung in loose, and throw a piece of flannel over it. Let it stand in a warm place a month or six weeks, when the vinegar will be fit to bottle. 1058. “ Ohst Essig ”—Fruit Vinegar. (No. 2.) Windfalls may be collected for vinegar, and any bruised fruit will do, but not apples or pears that are black. Crush the fruit well; if you have a cider-press use it. Put the juice in a tub, to stand eight or ten days. Take off the scum as it rises with fermentation, then put the juice in a cask and set it in a warm place. The barrel must be quite full, and any remains of juice must be bottled to fill it up with as the vinegar wastes with fermentation. When this is over, cover the bunghole with a piece of linen. In spring you may either draw it off into a clean barrel, or bottle it, without disturbing the sediment. 1059. “ Trauhen Essig ”— Qrape Vinegar. Grapes that will not ripen, treated as above, make excellent vinegar. It is well to use a vinegar cask, or one which has been rinsed out with vinegar.

On Salad. 210 soon sported a vehicle, in order the more readily to transport him from place to place, together with a livery servant carrying in a mahogany case every'- thing necessary, such as differently perfumed vinegars, oils with or without the taste of fruit, soy, caviare, truffles, anchovies, ketchup gravy, some yolks of eggs. Subsequently he caused similar cases to be manufactured, which he furnished and sold by hun- dreds. By degrees the salad-dresser realised a fortune of 80,000 francs, with which he ultimately returned to France.” Three centuries ago, we learn from Champier, who wrote in 1560, that many materials were used for salads which are not thought of now; among others, fennel, marshmallow-tops, hops, wild marjoram, elder-flowers, and a species of nettle. Tomatas and asparagus were also at this pei’iod used as salads. In a “Memoire pour faire un Ecrlteau pour un Ban- quet,” published in the sixteenth century, I find in the list of salads the following:— 1. Salade blanche. 2. Salade verte. 3. Salade de citron. 4. Salade d’entremets. 5. Salade de grenade. 6. Salade de Houblon. 7. Salade de laitues. 8. Salade d’olives. 9. Salade de perce-pierre.

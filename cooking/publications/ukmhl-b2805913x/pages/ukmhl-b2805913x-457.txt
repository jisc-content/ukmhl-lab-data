Modern Cookery and Cookery Books. 65 cookery are, Vatel, La Chapelle, Grimod de la Rey- ni^re, Beauvilliers, Ude, Laguipierre, Car^me, and Plumeret; but receipts of more general utility for the public at large will be found in the “ Cuisinier Royal ” and the Cuisiniere Bourgeoise.” Many of the receipts of Careme require alterations and additions, but some may be adopted in their en- tirety. Of Careme’s cookery, however, the distinguish- ing characteristic is profuse expenditure. In order to render such a system not merely easy of adoption, but possible, men cooks, splendid establishments, and colossal fortunes must become much more universal than they ever have been or ever can be. The object of all should now be not to render the introduction of French cookery difficult and expen- sive, but easy, and within the reach of persons of mo- derate fortune. The present age is distinguished as an age of rapid progress, and the improvements suggested now may, in this day of easy and inexpensive communication with the Continent, become permanently rooted to the British soil before 1869. p

Clear the meat from skin and gristle as it is cut up into small pieces. This expedites the mincing whether it is done by machine or hand. Mix together four ounces of salt, a quarter of an ounce of saltpetre, and an ounce of fresh-ground black pepper; strew this among the meat when you begin the chopping. Mince it very fine.

302 GERMAN NATIONAL COOKERY. 1081. “ Kirsch Liqueur ”— Cherry Liqueur. Weigh a pound of morella and a pound of sweet black cherries. Open them and take out the stopes. Crush the latter. Put them and the fruit in a large bottle, with half a pound of sugar, a quarter of an ounce of stick cinnamon, and a dozen cloves bruised. Pour in a quart of brandy. Cork it close. Strain it off clear in a fortnight. 1082. “ Kiimmel Liqueur ”—Caraway Liqueur. Bod half a pound of sugar in half a pint of water. Mix this, while hot, •svith an ounce of caraway-seeds and a quart of brandy. Cork it close at once. You may filter it after a week’s standing. 1083. “ Vanillen Liqueur ”— Vanilla Liqueur. Break up two whole pods or sticks of vanilla. Put them in a bottle with three pints of brandy or proof gin. Let this in- fuse a fortnight. Then boil a pound of sugar in a quart of water to a clear syi’up. Add the spirit and vanilla. Let all simmer together ten minutes, then filter and bottle it. Saffron or cochineal may be used for colouring, if pre- ferred. PUNSCH—PUNCH. 1084. “ Punsch Essenz ”— Punch Essence. Peel six lemons and two Seville oranges verj"^ thin, and put the peelings in a glass retort or large bottle, with the juice of ten lemons and the two oranges ; add a quart of arrack or fine rum. Cork this well, and let it stand a week ; then put a pint of very good amber-coloured wine over a clear fire, with two pounds of loaf sugar, and boil this to a clear syrup. While it is cooling, filter through fine flannel the spirit from the peels ; add this to the syrup before the latter is quite cold. Put it in small bottles and cork them well. A third or fourth part of this essence in hot tea, water, or wine, gives excellent punch at once.

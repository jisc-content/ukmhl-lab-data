166 The Roast. uaiy and February, we have widgeon and woodcock, snipe, teal, wild duck and black game, hares, &c. All this game is better flavoured and better roasted in England than in France. In April, we have excellent lamb for a first course, with guinea-fowls and ducklings for a second. In May we have poulardes and quails, turkey poults, &c., for a second. Venison begins in June, and in August we have grouse, and that excel- lent bird the golden plover. A little later come partridges, black cock, and then snipe and wild duck, while lamb and mutton alternate in the first. Mutton, whether as a roast, or an entree in the shape of cutlets, can be alike served; and with Swift’s receipt for roast- ing mutton, I will conclude this branch of the subject: “ (Gently stir and blow the fire, Lay the mutton down to roast, Dress it quickly, I desire; In the dripping put a toast. That I hunger may remove;— hlutton is the meat I love. On the dresser see it lie; Oh ! the charming white and red! Tiner meat ne’er met the eye. On the sweetest grass it fed; Let the jack go swiftly round. Let me have it nicely brown'd. On the table spread the cloth. Let the knives be sharp and clean. Pickles get and salad both. Let them each be fresh and green. With small beer, good ale, and wine, 0 ye gods ! how I shall dine !

It is a mistaken notion to think that beer is a modern beverage, or that its use is exclu- sively confined to England.

Diodorus and Theo- phrastus state that the Gauls called their beer zythus. If this be true, it is not improbable that they received from the Egyptians both the name and the beverage. Be this as it may, it is certain that the insensate order which Domitian gave, to tear up all the vines in Gaul, rendered the use of beer but the more general.

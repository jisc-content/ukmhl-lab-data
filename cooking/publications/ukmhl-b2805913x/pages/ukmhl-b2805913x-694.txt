Thus armed the Hebe makes the round of the table, and pours out to each guest a glass of the bitter nectar it is her business to distribute. The effect of the coup du milieu is stated to be almost magical in renewing the appetite, but on what principle it pro- duces this result physicians must determine. The coup-dJavant is little practised in Paris, though greatly used in Russia, Sweden, and the north of Germany. It consists of a large glass of vermuth, or of simple brandy, which is presented to each of the guests by way of appetiser. Physicians differ in opinion as to the virtues of the coup-iTavant: it is said rather to dispose the stomach to digestion ; but, be this as it may, the Russian stomachs, where the coup-d!avant is so much practised, are far more vigor- ous than the English or French. It may be that from the effects of the climate some such stimulant is required. The coup-cCapres consists, as Dr. Hen- derson states, of half a glass of pure wine taken Immediately after the soup. This is considered so salutary a practice, that it is proverbially said to take a crown out of the pocket of the physician. The wine offered for the coup-daprh in France is gene- rally a good Beaune or Macon; whilst in England it is commonly sherry or ^Madeira. In any -event it should be a good sound wine ; for the palate, at that early stage of a dinner, is most sensible to taste and flavour.

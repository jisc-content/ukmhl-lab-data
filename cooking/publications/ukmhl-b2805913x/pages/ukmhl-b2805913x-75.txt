63 SAUCES. 237. “ Strasbourg Sauce ”— Strasbourg Sauce. Rub well in a mortar the yolks of three hard-boiled eggs with the juice of a lemon. Bone three sardines, and chop them very fine, with two shalots, and a dessert-spoonful of capers. Add these to the eggs, with two tablespoonfuls of mustard and one of sugar, some salt and cayenne pepper. Pound all quite smooth together; then add four table- spoonfuls of Florence oil; and when this is well mixed in, add by degrees half a pint of white vinegar. Strain through a coarse sieve, and bottle the sauce for use. It is good for cold meats or fish. 238. “ Krduter Sauce”—Herb Sauce. Scrape or slice^thin a large stick of horseradish. Strip the leaves from a sprig of winter savoury; the same of thjune, basilicum, marjoram, and a very little tarragon. Slice two shalots and a clove of garlic. Put all in a saucepan ■with a ,pint of water, a wineglassful of ■vinegar, and the juice of a lemon. Add half a teaspoonful of celery seed, ample salt, some black and cayenne pepper, with enough brown onion-chips to colour the sauce richly, or, instead of these, plenty of sugar bro^wning. Let all simmer ten minutes after coming to a boil; then strain it, and when cold, pour it into small bottles for use.

Lcmery, that " coffee fortifies the stomach and brain, promotes digestion, allays the headache, suppresses the fumes caused by wine, makes the memory and fancy more quick, and people brisk that drink it.” This last effect, says he, has been observed by the shepherds of Africa, who took notice, that before coffee was used, and that their sheep fed upon this kind of pulse, that they skipped about strangely.* I shall close my observations on coffee by giving a receipt of Dr. Roques for a cafe a la creme frappe de glace. It is a delicious breakfast during the sum- mer heats. Here it is:—“Make a strong infusion of Mocha or Bourbon coffee; put it in a porcelain bowl, sugar it properly, and add to it an equal por- tion of boiled milk, or one-third the quantity of a rich cream. Surround the bowl with pounded ice.” Doctor Bonnafous, of Perpignan, recommended this beverage to such persons as had lost their appetite, or who experienced general debility. This agreeable epicurean one day said to a patient, Dr. Roques, who was himself in the profession,—“ Study, my friend, that which is good, that which pleases your palate. Try to become a Viiile friand; commence a series of gastronomic experiments without infringing a regi- men. You will be the better for it, and in certain circumstances you will exercise on sickly people in- clined to gourmandise an unlimited power. Break- Traite des Aliinens,” par Lciuery.

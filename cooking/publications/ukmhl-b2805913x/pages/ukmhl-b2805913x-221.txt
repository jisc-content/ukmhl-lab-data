FARINACEOUS DISHES. 2og 757. “ Kirschen Aufiaiif"—Chernj Aujlauf. {Xo. 2.) Boil a quarter of a pound of flour in a pint and a half of milk until thick and smooth ; take it from the fire, and keep stirring till half cold. Beat a quarter of a pound of butter to a cream; add six well-beaten eggs, a quarter of a pound of sugar, and a small spoonful of powdered cinnamon, otir these well into the thick milk, and then add a pound and a half of black cherries. Bake as directed for others. 758. “ 2Iandel Aujianf”—Almond Aujlaaf. Boil a pint and a half of milk, and in it a large cup of bread-crumbs, keeping all stirred until it thickens ; then turn it out to cool. Meanwhile, mix a quarter of a pound of pounded almonds with a couple of tablespoonfuls of sugar, a little gi’ated lemon-peel, and the yolks of six eggs, with their whites whipped to a snow. Stir all together gently ; butter the mould well, shake in as many crumbs as will adhere to it; fill and bake at once. 759. “ Oitronen Aitfiavf"—Lemon Aujlauf May be proceeded with as in the foregoing directions for others, using lemon only to flavour, the yellow peel of one or two lemons grated, and the juice mixed in when the egg- snow is added. Bake in a moderate oven thirty to forty minutes ; serve with sifted sugar. “ KOCHE.” The term “ koch,” literally cook, is a somewhat indefinite one; simply expressing a dieh of the kind indicated by its chief ingredients. The “ koch” is very light, delicate, and rich, either baked or steamed in a tin mould. In various localities there are dishes compounded of nearly the same ingredients as the koch, and treated in a similar way, such as the auflauf, or soufllee, but they are diti'erent in some parti- culars. Wo have no suitable term for it in English—Spomjc puddimj is the nearest; but this does not do it justice; nor is custard right. We must therefore call it a mould, after the name of its principal ingredient. p

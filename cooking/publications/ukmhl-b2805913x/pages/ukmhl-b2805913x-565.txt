173 Boiling. or fried, may be served in twenty ways—a la hol- landaise, (i la Sainte Menetiould, a la Perigeaux, a la jprovenqale. As to salmon, the same observation may be made. It may be served a la Saint Cloud, a. la genevoise, a la v'enitienne, a la Rogale, in Jilets aux anchois, d la d'Artois, a la Sainte Menehould, en pa- pillotes, d la d'uxelle ; but, unless you have a superior cook, salmon is best plain boiled. I will conclude with the following remarks as to the time required to boil poultry. Turkeys, capons, fowls, chickens, &c., are all boiled in the same manner, allowing time accordino- to their size. A chicken will take about twenty minutes. A fowl, about forty minutes. A poularde or capon, about an hour. A small turkey, an hour and a half. A large turkey, two hours or more. Rabbits should be put into a basin of warm water; then put them into plenty of Avater, and boil half an hour. If large, three quarters of an hour. Of frying I would merely say, that the frying is the finest and most delicate when good olive oil is employed. “ II est reconnu que c’est avec la bonne huile d olive que se font fritures les plus fines, les plus dclicates.

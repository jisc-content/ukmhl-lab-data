172 Boiling. Though boiling does not require so much nicety and care as roasting, yet it is seldom perfectly performed. It requires patient watchfulness and vigilance. It is natural,” says Count Rumford, “to suppose that many of the finer and more volatile parts of food must be car- ried off by the steam when the boiling is violent. The water should be heated gradually until it boils, for the the slower the meat boils the more juicy and tender will it be. Meat freshly killed takes longer to boil than when it has been properly hung, and meat killed in cold or frosty weather takes longer to boil than meat killed in summer. Meat or poultry should not be allowed to remain in the water after they are done, as they soon become sodden. It is usual to boil lamb, veal, and pork longer than beef or mutton. Of course all vessels in which meat is boiled, should be clean and wholesome. Vessels of copper, brass, and lead must be avoided in cookery, unless the inside be well tinned. The best sauce- pans are of iron, tinned in the inside. I would ob- serve, that salmon requires nearly as much boiling as meat, that is to say, about a quarter of an hour to every pound of fish.

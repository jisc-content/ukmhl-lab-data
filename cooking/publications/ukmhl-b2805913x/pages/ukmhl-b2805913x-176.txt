164 GERMAN NATIONAL COOKERY. must be soft when done, but not thin with liquid. Peel and quarter a few apples ; stew them slowly with a little sugar, butter, and very little wine; they must not be done to a mash. Dish the cabbage, as high as it will stand, in a flat dish, and garnish it \vith the quarters of apple, as unbroken as possible. Ked cabbage this way is excellent with roast goose, game, sausages, roast pork, “ beer ham,” pork cutlets, &c. 594. “ Weiss-Kraut ”— White Callage. Cut out the stalks of white winter cabbage, excepting in the tender leaves. Cut or pull them all to pieces. Put a good piece of butter, or goose dripping, into a stew-pan, with an onion chopped fine. When hot, put in the cabbage, sprinkle it with salt, and cover close to cook in its own steam till soft and yellow. Half an hour before serving, dredge in a little flour, add pepper and some caraway-seeds, if approved. See that it does not burn or become drj'. Thin it with a little milk or broth if necessary. 595. “ Rosen Kohl ”— Brussels Sprouts Must be well washed in salt and water, boiled till tender, thrown into cold water, strained, and warmed up in melted butter. 596. “ Kohlrabi ” or “ Kohlruhen ”— Callage Turnip or Cole Rape. This excellent vegetable is comparatively little known and cultivated in England. The flavour of the kohlrabi much resembles cauliflower. Peel them as turnips, cut them in halves and quarters, and boil them in salt and water till a fork goes easily through them. Boil the tenderest green leaves of the kohlrabi tops, and when done, strain and chop them like spinach, and return them to a stew-pan, with a little butter, to make them hot. Cut up the kohlrabi into small slices. Have some plain and rather thick melted butter, made with milk, in the saucepan. Put the slices into the sauce with a little salt and a grate of nutmeg if approved. Give them a boil up, and serve A\*ith the green laid round as a wreath.

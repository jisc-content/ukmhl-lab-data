Chapter VIII. VEGETABLES. 545. “ Kartoffeln,” or “ Erdapfehi in saurem Rahm ”— Potatoes in Sour Cream. Peel, mash, and slice potatoes a quarter of an inch thick. Put them into a stew-pan with some butter or goose lard, salt, pepper, and minced chives, or an onion. Let them brown a little, and, as they colour, stir them from the bottom occasionally, without breaking the slices. "When nearly done, beat up the yolks of two eggs, with a cup of sour cream or milk : pour this over the potatoes, and let them stew five minutes longer. 546. “ Saure Kartoffeln ”— Sour Potatoes. Cut two or three rashers of rather fat bacon in small dice, and also an onion. Fry these yellow in a stew-pan. Add a tablespoonful of flour mixed in water or broth, some salt, pepper, vinegar, and a teaspoonful of sugar. When this boils, put in the potatoes, half boiled, and sliced. Let them simmer till done, but not to mash. Bay-leaves are often simmered in the sauce, which must be agreeably acid. 547. “ Petersilien Kartoffeln ”— Potatoes uith Parsley. Prepare a sauce as in the last recipe, leaving out the vinegar. Add a grate of nutmeg, and a very little thyme or maijoram. Put in the sliced potatoes, and strew among them a good handful of chopped parsley. Simmer them till tender, but not broken. Add milk if the sauce dries away.

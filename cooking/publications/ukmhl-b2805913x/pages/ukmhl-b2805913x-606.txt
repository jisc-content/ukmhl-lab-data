214 The Dessert. it too often harasses and obstructs. Lachappelle {port-queue of Louis XIII., and his major domo) goes further, and mentions that all persons who make a point of eating dessert after a good dinner are fools, who spoil at once their wit and their stomachs. “Reject, therefore, once for all,” says another French author, the Macedoines glacees de fruits rouge, the white cheeses a la Bavaroise, the petits pains a la duchesse, the fanchonnettes de vulaille, the vol-au-vent a la violette. Experienced diners out never touch these things, not even at the end of a second course. When we speak of experienced and clever people, who know what they are about, we would speak of those gourmands so gifted, and so superior in all the affairs and business of life, such as Lorenzo de Me- dicis, Leo X., Raphael, Prince Talleyrand, George IV., the Emperor Alexandei*, Castlereagh, and Pitt himself.” M. F. Fayot, who writes biographies of Canning, and political articles in the French newspapers, ought to have known that Pitt did not care for such knick-knackeries as Pistachio nuts, and creme a la vanille. Though the dessert was originally invented in Italy, yet the usage was early transplanted into France. In the works of St. Gelals I find some lines, in which he sends fresh cherries to a lady on the first of May. IIow' this fruit could be thus early produced, without the aid of hot-houses, is difficult to imagine. From Champier, however.

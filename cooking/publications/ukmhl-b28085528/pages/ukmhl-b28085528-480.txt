HINTS TO THE MISTRESS. It is generally unAvise to take serA'ants from a po.sition inferior to that they are expected to fill. When engaging them, their duties should be described, and not made to seem less than they are. In taking the character, questions should be put as to the morals, habits, cleanliness, capability, and health of the servant; and there should be no hesitation or prevarication in the ansAvers. At the same time, it is necessary to observe the stylo and order of the house from Avhich the chiu-acter is taken, and also of the person giving it. It Avill be found a good plan to Avrite doAvn the daily Avork of each servant, and the hours for doing it, as avcU as the days on Avhich extra cleaning is to be done. The hours for rising, meals, retiring, and all matters on Avhich order and comfort depend, should also be Avritten doAvn.

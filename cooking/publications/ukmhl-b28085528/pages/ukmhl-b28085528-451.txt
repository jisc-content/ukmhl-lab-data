The following day, they mitst be closely covered with strong cap paper,* which must be made to adhere round th6 edge, and then brushed over with the white of egg, so as to exclude the air. Each pot shoidd be written upon, to show its contents and date of making. Fruit for jellies and jams must be quite ripe, fresh, and gathered in dry weather. The proportions are given in each receipt; if they be used, and the directions strictly followed, the preserves cannot fail to be good, and the cost is something less than half that paid for those bought ready made.

321 DINTS TO THE MISTRESS. STORES. The Hints to Servants will serve as a foundation to this plan, as it is impossible to lay down positive rules for every family. The merit or demerit of servants should never be made the subject of conversation. Servants should be forbidden to relate what they hear of neighbours and friends. Firmness, kindness, and punc- tuality in all relations between mistress and servant, will encourage obedience and respect. The kitchen and larder should be visited daily by the mistress; and every room in the house should be inspected by her, at least once a week. Great comfort will be found in the regular system of writing ‘ bills of fare; ’ they ensure the dinner ordered being served, and act as a check to tradesmen’s books. They should be kept, and at the end of the week com- pared with the books. Errors are then easil}' detected. Keceipts should be filed, and kept at least one year. A strict account of expenditure, with date of payment, should be kept; it is always satisfactory, and often useful as a reference to correct mistakes. The .subjoined outline of a month’s housekeeping expenses for four persons may in some degree guide the young housewife. The calculation is made on the prices of the best London trades- men of the present period (1863), and admits of the ‘ bills of fare’ being followed. The amount will frequently vary; but at the end of the year it will be found a tolerably accurate estimate on which diminution or increase may be made. The calculation admits of an occasional visitor.

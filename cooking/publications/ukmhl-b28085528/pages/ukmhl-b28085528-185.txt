When a Mayonnaise for company is required, the following mode of preparing the salmon will be found preferable to plain boiling. For twelve or fourteen persons have a piece out of the middle of a large fish, weighing four or five pounds. Put into a bright stmvpan four shalots and half of a good sized carrot, sliced, a piece of garlic the size of a pea, four sprigs of jjarsley, a sprig of cheiril, a sprig of thyme, a bay leaf, a laurel leaf, a tea- spoonful of salt, and six ounces of butter; boil for five minutes. Put in the salmon, with a pint of Marsala (or any Avhite wine), and a pint of water ; boil up quickly, then simmer very gently for thirty minutes ; drain. When quite cold take off the skin, pull out the bones, divide the fish into fiakes two inches square, and finish according to the receipt for Mayonnaise; using the quan- tities accoi'ding to the number of persons to be served. 62. BOILED TROUT. Put the fish into nearly boiling water with a tablespoonful of salt; boil up quickly, then simmer till done. A trout weighing one pound will require twelve minutes; two pounds, fifteen minutes; three pounds, twenty minutes. After the water boils, skimming must be carefully attended to. Serve on a neatly folded napkin, with a tureen of good melted butter, unless other sauce bo ordered.

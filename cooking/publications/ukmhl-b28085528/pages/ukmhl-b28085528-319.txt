POTATOES. PEAS. 159 404. POTATO BALLS. Mash the potatoes as in the foregoing receipt; make them up into balls the size of a potato ; brush each one over with beaten egg, and brown them either in a quick oven or before the fire. 405. FRIED POTATOES. Pare the potatoes and cut them into four quarters, and divide each quarter into two ; let them stand in cold water ten minutes; drain, and wipe them quite dry; throw them into a stewpan half filled with boiling fat, and try to a pale brown colour. Take them out with a slice, and place, them on a sheet of white blotting paper on a sieve, to absorb the fat before serving. Note.—There are wire nets made to fit stewpans, expressly for frying potatoes, into which they are placed and plunged into the fat, and when done quickly withdrawn. This mode insures the potatoes being better done and with less trouble. 406. GREEN PEAS, PLAIN. The peas must be young, fresh gathered, and fresh shelled. A pint and a half of peas will require three pints of water, with a tablespoonful of sugar and a teaspoonful of salt dissolved in it. Put the peas in, with a good sprig of firesh mint, while the water boils rapidly; keep the lid off the saucepan, and boil fast for fifteen or twenty minutes; drain in a colander, take out the mint, turn the peas on to a hot dish, put an ounce of fresh butter in the centre, and send to table immediately. 407. GREEN PEAS A LA FRAN^AISE. (French fashion.) Put into a ste\vpan the heart of a lettuce, pulled apart, two spring onions, a pint and a half of young fresh-shelled peas, two tablespoonfuls of loaf sugar, a tcaspoonful of salt, half an ounce of fresh butter, and a teacupful of water; simmer gently for half an hour, shaking the saucepan constantly. Take out the lettuce and onions, drain off the water, and put in an ounce of fresh butter; shake till well mixed with the peas, and serve very hot. Note.—It is better to shake the saucepan than to stir the peas with a spoon, as they would bo mashed by the spoon.

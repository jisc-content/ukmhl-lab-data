A slice weighing one pound will require a quarter of an hour ; two pounds, twenty-three minutes, five pounds from a very large thick fish, thirty minutes; the same weight from a small fish, twenty-five minutes; four pounds of a split fish, twenty minutes; a whole fish Aveighing seven or eight pounds, thirty minutes. Serve the salmon on a fine napkin, neatly rolled round the edges, and Avith shrimp sauce, unless any other be preferred; the quantity, according to the number of persons ; three-quarters of a pint is sufficient for five or six.

REMAKES AND DIRECTIONS TO BE EEMEMBERED. In writing receipts, it is impossible to give in each, every detail; it must therefore be rmderstood that ‘ a spoonful,’ whether table, dessert, tea, or saltspoon, be used, means a spoon of the ordinary- size for kitchen use, filled, but not piled. The same observation applies to cups and glasses. When carrots, turnips, celery, onions, mushrooms, potatoes, lemons, &c., are ordered without specification, the medium size must be understood; ‘ pepper,’ either kind ; ‘ mustard,’ made or w?i-made ; ‘ dry flour,’ dried, but not haked; ‘ dried crumbs,’ bread prepared as directed; ‘ water,’ cold. K these remarks be remembered, no difficulty can arise, as in all cases where detail is necessary, it is given in the receipt. Kitchen Utensils.—Exti-eme cleanliness is indispensable to good cooking. Pots, stervpans, saucepans, fryingpans, and every other utensil, must be kept bright inside. Each time they are used, they should be well washed with hot water, scoured rvith silrer sand and a wisp of hay (which should always be at hand), rinsed and dried before putting them away. Soda should not be used, as it soon destroys the tinning of. the vessels. Pudding-cloths, jelly-bags, and sieves should be washed several times in very hot water, without soap or soda, and dried in the open air. Paste- slabs, rolhng-pin, moulds, earthen pans, and the lids, tables, &c., must be kept scrupulously clean. The Oven.—The oven requires attention both in cleansing and heating, or it will not work satisfactorily. It should be swept and weU rubbed with a wet cloth every morning. l\Iore or less fire must be applied to obtain the degree of heat required, which may be ascertained by putting in a piece of stale crumb of bread.

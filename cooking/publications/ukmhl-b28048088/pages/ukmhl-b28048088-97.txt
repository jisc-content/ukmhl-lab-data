85 TREE TABLES. Scheme 51. The old-fashioned flower known as “cherry pie” makes a lovely table decoration, especially when combined with purple foxglove. Let the table slip be of deep orange. Use white cut glass or silver baskets to contain the flowers, and com- bine them with maidenhair ferns and smilax. Long trails of the latter should connect the five baskets—one in the centre, the others at the four corners of the centre-piece—with each other. Sweets, orange and mauve, in silver dishes. Menu cards orange coloured, with mauve lettering; rolls, etc., tied to match. Scheme 52. The small sunflowers make a lovely table decoration, especially when combined with asparagus fern. The table-cloth in this instance should be of yellow art linen with a drawn thread border, the table slip of brown velvet, worked with a design of sunflowers. Use the tallest centre-piece you possess to hold the flowers, which will probably require wiring, as they are of the top-heavy variety; and then arrange the latter as lightly as possible, taking care to use plenty of fern. Smaller glasses to correspond should hold from one to two blooms and some ferns, and be dotted here and there

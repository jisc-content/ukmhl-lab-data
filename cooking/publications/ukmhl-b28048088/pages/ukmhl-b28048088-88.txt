78 DAINTY DINNER TABLES. silk gauze, ruffled as lightly and artistically as possible. A copper bowl filled entirely with lavender, and nothing else, should serve for a centre piece, and specimen glasses of a Queen Anne pattern, or quaint little copper vases, if you can get hold of any, should be similarly filled and dotted here and there. At the four corners of the table place flat fan- shaped bunches of lavender tied with true lovers’ knot bows of scarlet ribbon. The bonbon dishes should be of copper—the flat fancy ash-trays in quaint, odd shapes sold at any art shop for 6|d. each will serve your purpose most admirably; but they must be lined with a fancy dessert paper before the goodies are put in, or else the latter should be each in its little paper case,—the sweets of scarlet and mauve, and before each guest two or three sticks of lavender tied together with a scarlet ribbon should be placed. The menu cards must be of mauve with the lettering in scarlet, and the dinner rolls should be tied with scarlet ribbon. Table glass of scarlet and Nuremberg, and in each finger-bowl a stump of lavender should float. To those who are fortunate enough to live in or near the lavender districts, or who possess a bed of lavender, this scheme should commend itself; but to dwellers in towns I fear the idea is not so practicable, as it is mostly the dried lavender which comes their way.

“don’ts” for amateur florists. 41 man’s; it costs but 6d. per packet, and is very easily applied. If you do not like the idea of the silver specimen glasses, tiny baskets or hampers with the lids off might be similarly treated and placed one at each of the four corners of the table centre, one at each end, and one at each of the four corners of the table. The candles should be pale yellow in hue, and in silver candlesticks, while the candle shades should be of either white or pale yellow silk to match the table slip. The sweets may be either the yellow nougatines or abricotines before men- tioned, or else pale yellow fondants or chocolates with yellow icing. A nice variety too, upon the ordinary hackneyed sweets, may be made by using glaceed tangerines, or apricots in their place; and there is a sweet made of iced and preserved melon, which is also of a pale yellow hue, and is more- over, besides being eminently delicious, very moderate in price, costing as it does but is. 6d. per pound. A pound should be bought at a time, and then the tiny squares may be cut from it as required. Scheme 7. Another exceedingly pretty table scheme wherein primroses figure could be worked out thus :— The centre slip should be of pale Parma violet mauve, the silvered baskets before referred to being filled with primroses and violets mixed.

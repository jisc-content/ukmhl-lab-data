SUPPER PARTIES. 137 room can be found for them. Rose-coloured wax candles and shades, rose-coloured sweets in silver dishes; rose-coloured menus with silver lettering. All dishes to be tinted rose-colour so far as is possible. Table glasses of pink Bohemian ware. Ices tinted pale rose-colour. This would be a pretty scheme for a supper given in honour of a sailor son who is just entering his profession. Scheme 6. Table-cloth of white linen down which must run long lines of green satin ribbon, finishing at either end of the table in true-lovers’ knots. Centre-piece of green Nuremberg glass on a black iron scroll-work stand, filled with white giant chrysanthemums, asparagus-fern, and long trails of smilax. Specimen glasses of Nuremberg ware filled in a similar manner. Table glass of pale green and white crystal. Ices tinted a pale green. Menu cards of white, pale green letter- ing. Sweets pale green fondants and white dragees. White wax candles in black iron scroll- work candelabra. Note.—The candle shades may be of either green or white silk, but personally I should prefer scarlet silk, as the lovely rosy shade cast by this hue warms up the white decorations and is eminently pretty.

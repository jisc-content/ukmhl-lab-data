8l TREE TABLES. Scheme 45. Foliage Table.—It is equally suitable for either a luncheon or a dinner, and for either autumn or winter. Let the table centre be of bright scarlet or pale mauve gauze. Use either green Belgian pottery vases or Nuremberg specimen glasses. A large one for the centre-piece, eight or ten smaller ones —according to the size of the table—to be placed, one at each corner of the centre slip, and one at each corner of the table. Fill these entirely with feathery ferns, grasses of all sorts, trailing ivy, and, if obtainable, asparagus ferns. In spring, yellow catkins or young tree shoots; in later spring, with the young leaves and blossoms of the lime tree; and in autumn with berberus, Virginia creeper, red or copper-beech leaves, etc. All the leaves should be arranged as lightly as possible, and if this is properly done the effect should quite equal that of even the prettiest of flower tables. The sweets should be scarlet or mauve (accord- ing to the colour of the table- slip) and green, and be contained in either the green pottery dishes or in tiny Nuremberg ones, according to the vases used. Rolls and salt-sticks to be tied with scarlet and green ribbons; table glass of Nuremberg, and scarlet menu cards with green lettering. 6

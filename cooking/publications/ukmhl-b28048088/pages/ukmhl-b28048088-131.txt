VERY INEXPENSIVE TABLES. I IQ the dinner rolls and salt-sticks tied up with pale pink and blue ribbons in true-loversâ€™ knots bows; the table glass should be of white crystal, and the finger-bowls should have a spray of geranium and forget-me-not floating in each. If you possess any Dresden china figures holding baskets, these might with advantage be dotted here and there, the baskets aforesaid being filled with the pink and blue flowers. A 9d. or is. bunch of forget-me- nots should be ample for this table, with, say, a bunch of the same size of ivy geranium; so you see this too may be considered a very inexpensive scheme. A judicious intermixture of maidenhair- fern would be a great improvement, if you are fortunate enough to possess the latter without having to buy it; otherwise it may be dispensed with.

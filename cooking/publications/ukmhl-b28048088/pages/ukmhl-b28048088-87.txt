TREE TABLES. 77 Use a large dinner-plate filled with wet moss, as described in the foregoing scheme, and let it stand on an inverted saucer. Smaller saucers filled with the wet moss should stand one at each of the four corners of the table, and the clematis must be arranged in one and all of them in such a manner that their domestic and humble origin is completely hidden. If a scarlet table-slip be used, a judicious mixture of scarlet geraniums skilfully introduced will lend more brightness to the table. The clematis should be arranged in long trails, as before described, so that very little, if any, of the table-cloth is visible, except just that portion occu- pied by the plates, knives, and forks, etc. The sweets must be mauve and scarlet, menu cards mauve with scarlet lettering, or vice versd, and the dinner rolls tied up with strands of the two ribbons, the table glass, both in this and the foregoing scheme being of white crystal. If an orange-hued centre-slip is used in place of the scarlet, the sweets, etc., should be deep yellow, as nearly orange as is procurable, and mauve, the menu cards mauve with orange lettering, the rolls tied with ribbons of the two colours, and the table glass preferably Nuremberg.

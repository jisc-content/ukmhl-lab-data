DAINTY DINNER TABLES. 148 ribbon to match the hue of the centre slip. The foregoing is for a luncheon or dinner. If a tea- party is given to celebrate the interesting event, and a buffet-table is used, the front of the table might be further adorned by sprays of flowers tied with strands of ribbon of either blue or pink, and securely pinned in place. If candle-shades are used, these, if not pink, should be white, as blue is by no means a becoming shade. At christening parties the cake, with its device of a cradle and Cupids, should occupy the place of honour on the table in front of the happy hostess and mother.

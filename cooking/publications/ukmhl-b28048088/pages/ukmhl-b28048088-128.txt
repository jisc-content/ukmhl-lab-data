n6 DAINTY DINNER TABLES. Scheme 78. But we have not exhausted the possibilities of that seaweed yet. Combined with violets it pos- sesses a fresh attraction. Use one of the green Belgian pottery squat-shaped, pinched-in three- cornered bowls. Arrange two bunches of the sea- weed in this, and fill the centre with three penny bunches of violets, the table slip being of pale green Liberty velveteen. At each of the four corners a green Belgian pottery vase filled with the seaweed and a bunch of violets. Sweet dishes of the green pottery filled with crystallized violets. Menu cards of green, with mauve lettering. Candle shades of either pale green or scarlet. Table glass of Nuremberg green, and if scarlet shades are chosen, of scarlet Bohemian ware. The objection may perhaps be urged that the introduction of scarlet for candle shades is hardly a happy sug- gestion, and that, there being no other touch of scarlet in this scheme, it would be rather sudden. Scarlet shades, however, with very few exceptions are always permissible, and the scarlet here, if used, could be carried out in the table glass, and would thus tend to warm things up generally.

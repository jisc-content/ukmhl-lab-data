37 CHAPTER III. SOME “DONGS’’ FOR AMATEUR FLORISTS. The following rules should always be borne in mind when arranging flowers:— Don’t try to pack too many flowers into one glass, under the mistaken idea that you are giving the onlooker the impression of a profusion of flowers. You will only spoil what might be a good effect by doing so. Don’t fill your glass too full of water. About three-parts full is the right quantity. Don’t use over-moist sand. Don’t use moss without moistening it well. Don’t omit to change the water in your specimen glasses every day. Don’t forget that a pinch of powdered charcoal added to the water will make all flowers last quite twice as long as they would otherwise do. Don’t forget to clip the split ends of the flower stalks when you change the sand or water in your vases. Don’t wire flowers if you can possibly arrange them well without doing so. They wither more quickly when wired.

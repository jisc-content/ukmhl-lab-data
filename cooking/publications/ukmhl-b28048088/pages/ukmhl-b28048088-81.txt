COUNTRY TABLES. 71 silvered over in the manner I have already de- scribed might be utilized. Tiny silver vases or white crystal specimen glasses with silver stems should be dotted here and there, irregularly, down the length of the centre slip, and four others should occupy each end of the table. If you lack the vases, smaller “silvered” baskets must take their place, and at each corner of the table-cloth an ordinary white finger bowl, filled with acacia blooms in such a manner that the bowl is entirely concealed, should stand also. The menu cards should be pale mauve with silver lettering, or better still, white with mauve lettering, and a spray of acacia painted in the left-hand corner. The candle shades used should be white silk, but personally I prefer mauve wax candles {without shades) in silver candlesticks. The sweets should be pale mauve and silver chocolates, the dinner rolls, etc., being tied with mauve gauze or bebe ribbons, and the table glass should be pure white crystal. If you happen to have by you a big bunch of silverpenny in good condition, this might be inter- mixed with the acacia blooms and leaves with very good effect. Scheme 38. A lovely scarlet and mauve table could also be carried out by means of acacia blooms intermixed

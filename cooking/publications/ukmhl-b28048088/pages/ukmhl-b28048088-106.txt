94 DAINTY DINNER TABLES. together and fastened (apparently) at each of the four corners by a lovers’ knot bow of the three shades. In the centre place a china sedan-chair entirely filled with flowers, pale pink sweet-peas, blue forget-me-nots, and maidenhair fern. Get half-a-dozen tiny wicker baskets—failing these, toy hampers will do—-and suspend them from the necks of the shepherdesses by means of bebe ribbons, one in pale pink, another in pale blue, and so on. Fill the baskets or hampers, as the case may be, with the pink sweet-peas, forget-me-nots, and maidenhair fern. Place old-fashioned silver orna- ments here, there, and everywhere, such as quaint spoons, snuff-boxes with the lids open, a dessert paper inside filled with sweets. Let the sweetie dishes proper be of silver filled with sweets in the above three colours, the guest cards being of pale pink and pale blue, with the names written in green ink. The menu cards should be of pale blue, with the lettering in pale pink and a deep border of pale green. The ices should be pale green (Pistachio ices are the requisite colour), or Napolitaine—viz., pale green, pale blue, and pale pink, in pink and blue baskets. The salt-sticks and rolls must be tied with ribbons of the same colour, and the candles should be of pale green and pale blue wax in Dresden china candelabra, with pale pink shades. The above is not only a pretty but an exceedingly uncommon scheme, and is sure to be largely admired.

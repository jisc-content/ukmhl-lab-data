SUMMER TABLES. 49 SCHEME 14. Another pretty table could be carried out on somewhat similar lines as regards the colour scheme by using scarlet geraniums in place of the roses. These, however, will be found rather more difficult to wire.

To revert for a moment to sweet - peas. A charming pink-and-green table might be carried out as follows :â€” The table-cloth should be of green art linen with a deep hem-stitched border, the centre slip of pale green satin or pale green Liberty silk gauze, the vases of pale apple-green glass, filled with the sweet-peas and green oaten grasses.

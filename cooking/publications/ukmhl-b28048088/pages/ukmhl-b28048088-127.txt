VERY INEXPENSIVE TABLES. 115 either of the four corners place flat fan-shaped bunches of the ivy and silver honesty tied up with cerise ribbons. The centre-piece should be a white china bowl, supported by Cupids filled with the seaweed-fern, silver honesty, and trails of ivy. Other vases similarly filled should stand in front of host and hostess, and be dotted about here and there. And just above the top of the plates of host and hostess, the trails of ivy should be caught together with a loversâ€™-knot bow of cerise ribbons. Candles without shades, in black iron scroll-work candelabra. If you particularly desire shades, they should be white, as up to now I have seen no cerise ones on the market, and red and cerise do not accord amiably. The sweets too, must be either white or green in hue, and the menu cards green, with silver lettering. By-the-way, if liked, the sweets could be the chocolate almonds which are sold, I believe, coated with silver and cerise paper. They only cost is. 6d. a pound, so they are by no means an expensive luxury, as four ounces are ample for, say, four or six people. The table glass should be of white crystal and Nurem- berg green. Possibly scarlet Bohemian glass could be used, but I question if it would not clash with the cerise ribbons aforesaid. This scheme is more suitable for a country dinner-table than for a town one, as ivy, which can be had for asking in the country, is by no means cheap to buy in town.

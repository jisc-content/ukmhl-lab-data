DAINTY DINNER TABLES. I4 to more serious matter, so let us return to the practical arrangement of flowers, as against the poetic and fictional. The first thing then, as I have said—if the sum you can afford to spend upon blossom is only a limited one—is to see that the specimen glasses and vases provided for their reception have narrow, but not too narrow necks. You must remember that flowers, if well arranged, will present quite twice as gallant an appearance in vases of this sort as they would in the quaint china bowl before referred to, or in large specimen glasses. As regards the kind of vases and glasses to be employed, I would advise you to, if possible, invest in, say, two or three sets, and ring the changes on these. For example, one set might be of white Coalport china. Imitation Coalport can be bought very cheaply, and if modern, even the real is by no means unduly expensive. If you do not care for Coalport—and I have met people who do not—there are the really exquisite modern imitations of old Leeds to be had at very modest prices; and in this case the dinner service should. I think, match also. So much for china. In glass there are the delightful modern reproduc- tions of old Nuremberg in the quaintest goblet and a dozen other forms besides; and the prices for these, I would remark, commence as low as 6d. or 8^d. each. Truly a modest sum when one considers their dainty grace.

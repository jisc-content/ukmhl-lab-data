SCHEMES FOR DINNER PARTIES. 89 border. The table slip of plain pink satin, and at each of the four corners a lovers’ knot bow of pale pink satin ribbon, whose ends shall reach to each of the four corners of the table. In the centre stand a bowl of white Coalport china, supported by three Cupids, filled with the carnations and ferns. Tiny vases, eight or ten in number, according to the size of your table, should stand here, there, and everywhere, filled with the pink carnations, etc. In front of each guest place a boutonniere of the pink carnations and ferns. The menu cards must be pale pink with silver lettering, the table glass of pink Bohemian, the sweets palest pink in silver bonbon dishes. In each finger-bowl a pale pink carnation should float, and the guest cards should be of pale pink, with the names written in silver ink.

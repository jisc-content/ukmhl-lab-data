84 DAINTY DINNER TABLES. quite an ideal table may be arranged with their aid. The table-cloth should be of white hem-stitched linen, and the table centre of white silk gauze. Use the Devonshire pottery vases already described. A quaint, three-handled mug as a centre-piece, and two othersâ€”one for the top and one for the bottom of the table slip. Arrange the carrot leaves and white marguerites, or the common wild moon-pennies will do when marguerites are not to be obtained, in the mugs. The sweets to be white and yellow, the menu cards white with yellow lettering, and the rolls, etc., tied with white, yellow-bordered ribbon. Candle shades of either white or yellow, with white or yellow wax candles. Scheme 50. Another pretty autumn table could be carried out with gorse and bramble sprays, combined with single dahlias. In place of a table slip arrange a bed of gorse, carpet-like, in the centre. Stand a copper bowl on this, filled with long sprays and trails of bramble, and single dahlias (yellow). A smaller bowl to be placed at each end, and at each corner of the table flat sprays of the bramble, intermingled with gorse, and tied with broad yellow ribbons. Menu cards of yellow with brown letter- ing, rolls tied with yellow and brown ribbons, and table glass of Nuremberg. Yellow sweets in copper dishes.

COUNTRY TABLES. 67 painted in the left-hand corner. The candles should be of yellow wax in white Coalport china candlesticks, with shades of pale yellow silk or crinkled paper. The rolls should be tied up with pale yellow ribbon, and a tiny cowslip ball should float in each finger bowl. The table glass should be either-of white crystal or green Nuremberg, and if you wish to preserve the illusion, you might serve a cowslip liqueur with your ices, if you have them, or failing this, with the after-dinner coffee. The liqueur may be made thus:—Mix half-a-bottle of cognac with half-a- bottle of cowslip wine, pour it over four ounces of sifted sugar, and leave for a few days, stirring occasionally in order that the sugar may dissolve better. Then bottle and use as required. Note.—The cowslip balls above referred to should only be made just before they are required. The above is, as I have said, essentially a “country table,” for though in their season cowslips are to be had in town, and had cheaply, yet, as they are of the order of flowers which wither very quickly, they are practically half-faded by the time they reach the London market, and are therefore not to be had, and cannot be seen, at their best. Scheme 34. When other flowers are unobtainable, or some- thing a little novel is desired, try a gorse table.

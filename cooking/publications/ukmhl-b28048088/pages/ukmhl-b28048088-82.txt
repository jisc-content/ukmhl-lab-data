DAINTY DINNER TABLES. 72 with scarlet geraniums and their leaves. In this case the table slip, if liked, could be of scarlet gauze, the sweets being scarlet fondants and mauve nougatines or violets; the dinner rolls being tied with two strands of ribbon, mauve and scarlet; the menu cards mauve with scarlet lettering, and the table glass entirely of scarlet Bohemian make. Stick to the silver bowls or baskets to hold the flowers, and if you possess the silverpenny utilize this also. Any quaint scraps of old silver, tiny trays, bowls, spoons, etc., you may own should also be called into requisition, and arranged on the gauze centre slip will add to the general effect. This also may be called a very inexpensive floral scheme, for many dwellers even in the London suburbs are the proud possessors of an acacia tree, whose blooms are rarely if ever utilized in the above manner, simply because they do not happen to think of the matter.

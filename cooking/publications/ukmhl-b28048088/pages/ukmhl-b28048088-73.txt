63 COUNTRY TABLES. A big bowl in the centre, or better still, a rustic green rough basket filled with mignonette, etc.; the green vases being similarly filled, and placed one at both ends of the table centre, and one at each of the four corners. The table centre in this instance should be of silk gauze in a dull shade of green, as nearly as possible that of the mignonette leaves. The sweets should be of pale green, and pale blue fondants; the rolls, etc., being tied with strands of bebe ribbon in the two shades. The menu cards of dull green, with pale blue lettering; and the candles, of pale blue wax, should be placed in the green Belgian pottery candlesticks I have more than once described. Candle shades should be omitted. Pretty as this scheme is, I must confess it is more suitable for a luncheon than a dinner table, as it does not look so well by lamplight as by daylight. Among other country tables—i.e., schemes wherein flowers of the commoner or wild class play the principal part—I may mention a marigold table, a bluebell or harebell table, and a broom or yellow gorse table. Scheme 31. The marigold table is really lovely. Select, if possible, the marigolds with the big brown hearts in preference to the double and all yellow variety.

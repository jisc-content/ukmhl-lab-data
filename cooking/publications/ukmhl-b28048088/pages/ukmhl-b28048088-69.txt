59 COUNTRY TABLES. flowers known as “ bachelors’ buttons.” The table-cloth should be of white linen. The table- centre of white satin embroidered with a con- ventional design of the bachelors’ buttons afore- said. For the benefit of the uninitiated, I may state that the flowers known by this title are a species of pink-tipped double daisy. The centre- piece should be a low bowl of white Coalport china, supported by four Cupids, full of wet sand. Fill this with bachelors’ buttons and mignonette, and place vases upheld by Cupids and similarly filled wherever there is an available space both on the centre slip and table-cloth. All these should be connected by strands of palest pink and white gauze ribbon, tied midway into a lovers’ knot. The best way is to make the lovers’ bow and ends separately, and then secure them to the looped strands by means of small pins; if this is done with care the artifice will never be detected, and less ribbon will in all probability be required. The sweets should be pale pink and white dragees or fondants, and the rolls and salt-sticks should be tied up with the gauze ribbons. The candle shades, if candles are used, should be pale pink, and the candlesticks those I have previously described as being of white Coalport china. A prettier floral scheme for, say, an engagement lunch or dinner it would, I think, be hard to find. This, too, is essentially a country table.

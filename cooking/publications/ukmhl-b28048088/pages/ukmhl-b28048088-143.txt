CHRISTMAS DECORATIVE SCHEMES. I2p Scheme 4. Table slip of pale green Liberty velvet. Vases of white Coalport china, filled with lilies-of-the- valley and scarlet poinsettias. White Coalport china bonbon dishes filled with scarlet nougatines and the tiny green pea sweets which are filled with chartreuse. (Note.—Both these latter only cost 2s. a pound, and four ounces of each should prove ample.) Table glass of white crystal and hock glasses of pale green. Dinner rolls and salt-sticks to be tied up with green scarlet ribbons. Candles of scarlet wax in white Coalport china candlesticks, with candle shades of pale green silk. Menu cards of white Early English paper, with scarlet borders and pale green lettering. A boutonnitre of lilies-of-the-valley and scarlet poinsettias to be placed in front of each guest. The Coalport vases above referred to are very inexpensive, and a whole set may be bought for as low as 10s. 6d. or 12s. 6d. Of course this is but the modern sort, and the other is, I believe, both scarce and dear. Scheme 5. Centre slip of ruffled Liberty silk gauze. Copper bowl in middle filled entirely with scarlet tulips and slender sprays of mistletoe. Four tiny bowls at either corner similarly filled, connected with scarlet velvet ribbon tied into true-lovers’ knots 9

8o DAINTY DINNER TABLES. as by candle-light it would, I fear, be apt to look rather dingy. Scheme 44. Another pretty and uncommon luncheon table might be worked out by combining nasturtiums with the mignonette. Let the table centre be of flame coloured velvet, as nearly as possible the shade of the flowers themselves. Use the green Belgian pottery bowls and vases, the biggest bowl you possess as a centre-piece, filled with mignon- ette and nasturtium flowers and leaves, and long trails of the latter should be allowed to hang over the sides of the bowl and vases. Flat sprays of the nasturtiums should be placed at each corner of the table. The table glass must be Nuremberg, and in each finger-bowl place a single nasturtium flower. The sweets, since flame-coloured goodies are, I fancy, unobtainable, should be of pale green.

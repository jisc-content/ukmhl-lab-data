90 DAINTY DINNER TABLES. and again, and if carefully put away, will come out each time looking perfectly fresh, and ought in fact to last indefinitely if only they are taken proper care of. But to go on, the dinner rolls and salt-sticks should be tied with pale pink ribbons to match those on the table centre. The ices should be contained in tiny pink baskets in the shape of a carnation, and ought by rights to be pale pink in colour, in which respect, so far as is possible, the rest of the viands should match them. So much for a pink table. Scheme 56. If you wish for a variation on the above, you might intermix deep red carnations with the pale pink ones, and use red Bohemian table glass in place of the pink, the menu cards being pink with deep red lettering in place of the silver; and the boutonnieres of pale pink and deep red carnations intermixed. In either case the candles should be of pale pink wax in silver candlesticks, and have pale pink silk shades. It is worthy of note that the latter is by far the most becoming shade for the complexion, feminine or masculine, it is possible to choose; hence my recommendation. Oneâ€™s guests are invariably at their best when they feel they are looking their best also, and this I believe is equally true of men as of women.

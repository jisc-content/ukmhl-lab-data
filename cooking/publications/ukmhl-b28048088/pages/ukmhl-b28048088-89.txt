79 TREE TABLES. Scheme 43. Have you ever tried a table composed entirely of mignonette ? I can assure you that it is charm- ing in the extreme. The table slip should be of dull green velvet, with a big, green Belgian pottery bowl filled entirely with mignonette by way of a centre-piece. Vases of the same ware should be dotted about here and there, as irregularly as possible, and filled with mignonette. Long trails of srnilax should outline the table centre, and at each corner of the table a big bunch of mignonette, tied first with wire so as to hold them firm, and secondly with a long trail of srnilax in the best imitation of a true lovers’ knot and long ends you can achieve should be securely pinned. The bunches should be arranged in such a manner—viz., with the stalks pointing towards the leg of the table, that the ends of the srnilax will fall over the table-cloth and hang down. The effect, properly carried out, is exceedingly pretty, for the table appears to be draped in srnilax. The sweets should be pale green, the menu cards green with pinky lettering, and the table glass throughout of Nuremberg. The rolls, if ribbons are used, must be tied with pale green. T he sweet dishes should be of the green Belgian pottery in preference to silver. This scheme is more suitable for a luncheon than a dinner table,

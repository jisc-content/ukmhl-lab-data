DAINTY DINNER TABLES. 50 tall gris de dlandres jugs (in plain pale grey, not those having blue introduced) to hold these, and let your table-cloth be of the green art linen afore- said. Use a plain strip of grey velvet by way of centre slip—it should be of the exact shade of the gris de Flandres ware, however, or else you must use none of it, and in all other respects proceed exactly as described above. Scheme 17. A parrot table is essentially a summer scheme, and one which is, moreover, as a rule, highly successful. It is certainly quite out of the common. The table-cloth should be of green art linen. For a centre slip you must invest in a long strip of the parrot velvet1: bright green parrots on a bright scarlet ground. Have a tall, slender Nuremberg glass by way of centre-piece. Fill it with scarlet poppies and tall green oaten grasses, and use your smaller vases of the same glass similarly filled. Sweets : bright scarlet and green liqueur peas. Tie the dinner rolls with ribbons to match, and let the menu cards be of bright green with scarlet lettering. Candles of scarlet wax in silver candlesticks—brass if preferred, and indeed I am not at all sure but that the latter is the most suitable—with scarlet silk or crinkled paper shades. Bright green candle shades, as I have before 1 You can get velvet in this design at any art shop.

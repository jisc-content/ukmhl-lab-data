THE ARRANGEMENT OF FLOWERS. 27 the flowers require wiring. This “ sounds difficult ” I know to the amateur would-be florist, but it is not so in reality. The following is the approved method:— Take two reels of wire; one thick, one thin. The wire can be bought at any good ironmonger’s. The thicker kind, which is called stubb wire, is used, so to speak, to strengthen the flower and to form an artificial stalk, when the flowers in question have only short stalks, or, as in the case of heavy-headed flowers, to support the head. Take then a suitable length of stubb wire and pierce the top of the stalk close to the bud. Be careful to do this as nearly as possible in the centre, then turn down the upper end very lightly yet firmly—i.e., the end which has gone through the flower. Next take a piece of the very fine wire and twist it firmly, yet not tightly, round the stalk of the flower and the piece of stubb wire. This will give a solid and yet pliable stem, which can easily be bent in any direction you please. Have the vases filled with the wet moss, and then insert the wired flowers and foliage, etc. Ferns may be wired in precisely the same way, but the piece of stubb wire should pierce the stem close, yet not too close, to where the leafage begins. For maidenhair fern, however, which has a very delicate stalk, only the finest kind of wire should be used, as the stubb wire is too coarse. By-the-way, it is worth while to note that the latter

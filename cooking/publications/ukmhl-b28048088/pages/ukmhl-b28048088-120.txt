io8 DAINTY DINNER TABLES. star of Bethlehem. The specimen glasses were of white crystal in white china holders similarly filled. The menu cards were of white. The ices were white on white china ice-plates. The dinner rolls and salt-sticks were tied with white ribbons, and the sweetmeats were white in white china bonbon dishes. The only touch of colour about the whole affair was the tender green of the lily leaves and the pale gold hearts of the white marguerites, which just relieved the whole from insipidity. Person- ally, I think our hostess was lucky in that she had broiling weather in her favourâ€”but oh! fancy a white luncheon on a dull, grey, drizzly afternoon ! For those, however, who like the above scheme and yet are wishful of introducing just a little colour, I would recommend a table slip of palest yellow satin velvet or gauze. This, while pre- serving the freshness and daintiness of the scheme, will, so to speak, warm it up a little, and take away from the over-frigid aspect it might otherwise possess. If by candlelight, I would say keep the white scheme, but let your candle shades be crimson.

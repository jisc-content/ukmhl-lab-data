Having got your long line of roses ready, secure one end of it to the vase at the top of the table as tightly as possible, then take the line straight to the centre- piece, secure it again, and from there pass it first to the right-hand vase then back to the bowl again, then to the next vase, and so on until all are con- nected with the centre bowl in long drooping chains, finishing up at the vase at the bottom of the table.

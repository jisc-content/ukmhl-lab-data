TABLES FOR CHILDREN’S PARTIES. 125 thing for the purpose. When the mirror has to be restored to its ordinary use, the flowers and letters that cannot be got away can easily be loosened by means of a cloth dipped in very hot water, and applied again and again until the fragments can be readily wiped off. Scheme 86. A variation on this might be made by using yellow marguerites in place of white ones, in which case the table-cloth should be white, and the centre slip, if one is used, either white or yellow satin or silken gauze. Scheme 87. Another pretty name table might be carried out with violets, the cloth being of pale green, with a mauve centre slip; or of pale mauve, with green Liberty velvet slip. The name, “ Violet,” should be written in a slanting direction at either end of the table, and the flowers should be violets, the ordinary English variety intermingled with Parma violets and a little maidenhair-fern. To contain these use either the Nuremberg glasses or the green Belgian pottery vases, of which I have sung the praises so loudly more than once. Scheme 88. A “rose” table is very easily carried out. One in yellow roses would be lovely worked out thus.

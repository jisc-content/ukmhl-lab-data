82 DAINTY DINNER TABLES. Scheme 46. A lovely table done entirely in white and green could be carried out with lime-tree blossoms and the young leaves and buds. The centre-slip should be of white satin, white cut glasses should hold the young leaves and blossoms, the sweets to be pale green and white, the menu cards pale green with white lettering, the dinner rolls tied with pale green ribbons, and the candles of green wax in silver candlesticks, with white silk or crinkled paper shades. The leaves, of course, must be arranged with the greatest possible care, or a heavy and dowdy effect will be the result. A variation on the above might be obtained by using the blossoms only, in conjunction with the asparagus fern or smilax. As the stalks to the blooms are very short, they will require wiring to enable them to appear to advantage. Scheme 47. A lovely table can also be arranged with yellow catkins and small variegated ivy. Let long trails of the latter hang over the sides of the vases or glasses, outline the table centre, and be arranged in flat sprays, tied with yellow ribbon, at each corner of the table. The sweets in this case might be pale yellow, and the table slip should be either grey-green velvet or as near as possible the shade of the catkins, or of pale yellow gauze. Candle

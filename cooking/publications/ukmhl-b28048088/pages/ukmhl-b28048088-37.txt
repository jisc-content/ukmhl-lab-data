THE ARRANGEMENT OF FLOWERS. 2Q number of blooms. This will of itself give a certain symmetry and grace—more especially if you are careful to intermix the foliage, whether of the flowers or ferns, if the latter be used, as evenly as possible. As regards the flowers themselves, we might here, I think, well learn a valuable lesson from the Japanese, who are admittedly the first (artistic) florists in the whole world. They never commit the vulgar error of grouping some half-dozen different varieties of the same flowers—all of them of violently opposing colours to each other—in one unharmonious whole, as is the wont of the amateur florist in England and elsewhere. At the very outside they never use but two blooms at one and the same time, and the result is something which has to be seen to be believed, I assure you. Take a hint from them, O amateur florist with small means at your disposal for the purchase of flowers, if you would achieve an artistic success with your limited number of blossoms. The result, I am sure you will say, will be so much more satisfactory that you will want to repeat the experiment as a regular thing. Among the flowers which accord amiably with each other, however, will be found the following 1. Wallflowers and forget-me-nots. 2. Pale yellow roses and violets. 3. Pink sweet-peas and lavender.

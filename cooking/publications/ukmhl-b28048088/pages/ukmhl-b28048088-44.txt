DAINTY DINNER TABLES. 36 dishes. Note.—If you use copper dishes, see that they are first duly lined with a dessert paper, and then indeed I think you may, when you look on your own handiwork, feel a certain amount of pardonable pride. Don’t choose a foggy evening for this special scheme of decoration.

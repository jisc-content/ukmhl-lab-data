COUNTRY TABLES. 55 with silver stems and feet, so much the better. Six will be required at least, and more if your table is a large one. Failing these, you must fall back upon tall, slender, white crystal glasses. Fill them with pale pink poppies and feathery and silver grasses, and arrange them in zig-zag fashion down the table. Use pale pink candles in silver candlesticks. Let your sweet dishes be silver, and have pale pink bonbons, menu cards of pale pink with silver lettering, and the salt-sticks, dinner rolls, etc., tied with pale pink ribbons. If shades are used for the candles, they should be of pale pink silk or crinkled paper also. The odd pieces of silver before referred to should be arranged to the best possible advantage on the centre slip. Really, when finished, I donâ€™t think you could find a prettier table anywhere, for the satin-covered zinc bowls, if properly arranged and filled, should give the impression of satin cushions covered with flowers. This table could also be achieved by means of pale pink peonies, but the latter must first be stripped of their huge and somewhat un- gainly leaves, and should moreover be wired, as they are rather heavy-headed, as well as heavy- leaved, and are apt to droop most ungracefully unless supported artificially. The zinc tins are obtainable either in diamond or oblong shape at any good ironmongers, and only cost a few pence. They should be filled with wet sand in preference

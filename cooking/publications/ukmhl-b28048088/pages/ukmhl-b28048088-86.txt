DAINTY DINNER TABLES. 76 between for the dinner-plates, knives and forks, glasses, etc. The effect should be that of a huge star-shaped decoration, the empty spaces being left between the points of the star. Flat vases, or specimen glasses, preferably of Nuremberg, should be placed here, there, and everywhere as irregularly as possible. The sweets, of course, must be pale mauve, and the bonbon dishes should be silver. If for a candlelight table, the candles should be of mauve wax, in silver candlesticks. The menu cards must be mauve with silver lettering, and the' rolls, etc., should be tied up with mauve ribbons. This is one of the prettiest decorations possible for a small dinner party, as, being flat, it enables con- versation to become general, rather a difficult matter when one cannot see one’s opposite neighbour. The above scheme, though, would only be prac- ticable for those who are fortunate enough to possess a wisteria vine. Scheme 41. Yet another wild-flower table could be charm- ingly achieved with wild clematis, or, for the matter of that, with the cultivated, if wild is not forthcoming. In this case I think the table centre should be of either bright scarlet—I am presuming that the purple clematis is to be used—or deep orange.

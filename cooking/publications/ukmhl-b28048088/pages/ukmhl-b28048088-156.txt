142 DAINTY DINNER TABLES. pale pink with silver lettering, and the dates of the marriage at the top. Salt-sticks tied with silver and pink ribbon, and the rolls tied similarly. White or pale pink wax candles in silver candela- bra, with pale pink silk shades. (The ever-pretty inverted-flower shapes, such as a rose or a poppy design, are by far the prettiest; or the crick-light fitments fitted to an ordinary candlestick or candle- sticks are charming and very inexpensive. Indeed, to my mind the “ Crick Lites ” are to be recom- mended in preference to any ordinary candles, as not only do they give a far better light, but they are absolutely safe, and there is no danger of the shades catching fire, owing to the presence of the protecting glass-shade. The price, by the way, of these lights is exceedingly moderate—one shilling per box, and each light burns for five hours; whilst the glasses cost but ninepence each, and the prettiest imaginable shades are to be had from sixpence each and upwards.) Yellow or scarlet may be substituted for the pink flowers, if fancied. In this case, of course all the rest of the accessories must match.

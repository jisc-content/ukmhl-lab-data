III. Those who are accustomed to more elaborate prepara- VEGETARIAN PRACTICE. In offering a few remarks in relation to the Vegetarian practice, it will be important to consider what are the jiresent habits and circumstances of our readers as to dietary arrangements, in order to enable them to adopt the practice as nearly as possible there- to. We Tvish our observations to be regarded as the suggestions of social friendship, rather than as formal and systematic instructions ; but as we cannot, in this instance, enter into all the particular requirements of our friends, we will endeavour to describe the principal varieties of cii’cumstance and condition, and it mil be for those who are desirous of adopting the prac- tice to recognise, in the descriptions given, that which most accords with their own particular case. Various as are the cir- cumstances of domestic life, they may, as a general rule, be found described in the foUomug classes :— I. Those who seek to adopt the most simple and natural food for the promotion of health and economy, and for theii- physical, intellectual, and moral discipline, and who subsist on a diet ep- tirely composed of fruits, farinacea, aud vegetables. Sugges- tions adapted for persons of this class Tvill be found on page 47. II. Vegetaiians having similar objects in view to those above descnbed, but who still prefer to partake of mUk, eggs, etc. and also persons hitherto accustomed to a diet composed princi- pally of farinaceous food, vegetables, and fruit mth some iiortion of flesh, but who desire to abandon the latter, and to supersede it with something consistent mth domestic economy, good taste, and humane feeling. Information adapted for this class will be found on page 50.

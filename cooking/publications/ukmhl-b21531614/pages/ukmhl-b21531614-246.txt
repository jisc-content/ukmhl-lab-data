VEGETARIAN COOKERY. 233 No. 636.—Red-Currant Jelly. To two-thirds of red currants, add one of white, gathered when quite ripe and dry; squeeze them, without picking; strain, and press the juice through a hair sieve, and immudicddy make it quite hot, but do not let it boil; to each pint of juice, allow one pound of sugar, finely powdered, and also made quite hot in a moderate oven ; spread on a large flat dish ; have it ready to put to the hot juice ; add it by degrees, stirring it till the sugar is perfectly dissolved, and pour it into jelly-pots or glasses immediately. No. 637.—Red-Currant Jelly. Boil and skim three pints of red-currant juice; put four pounds of loaf sugar into a pan with rather more than a pint of boiling water, and when it boils, add the hot juice; let the whole boil seven or eight minutes, and after taking off the scum, pour the jelly into cups or glasses. No. 638.—Damson Jelly. Put fine ripe damsons in a stew-pot mth very little water ; set it in a moderate oven till the fruit is sufficiently done for the juice to be strained from it through a hair sieve ; allow a pound of sugar to a pint of juice ; boil twenty minutes; try a few drops on a plate, and if it wiU set it is sufficiently done. As the clear juice only is required for the jelly, the fruit may be used for damson cheese, or for puddings. No. 639.—Raspberry Jelly. Put the fruit into a preserving pan, or into a jar, set in a pan of water on the fire ; when near boiling, strain carefully through a hair sieve ; to each pint of clear juice, allow fourteen ounces of sugar, stirring it off the fire till the sugar is dissolved; then boil twenty minutes, and pour it into jelly-pots or glasses. Gooseberry jeUy may be made in precisely the same way, allowing one pound of sugar to each pint of juice. As only the clear juice is required for jelly, the fruit may be used for puddings, adding sugar and boiling a little.

Twelve pounds of flour, one ounce and a half of salt, three ounces of German yeast, and one table-spoonful of sugar. Mix the salt with the flour. Rub the sugar and yeast with a very little cold water till quite smooth ; stir into it one quart of lukewarm water ; take out the spoon, and let it remain a few minutes to settle. Make a hole in the middle of the flour; clear off the yeast, carefully, through a tin strainer (leaving the sediment at the bottom), and stir it into'the flour till like batter ; set it in a rather warm place, covered with a cloth, till well risen ; then add nearly two quarts more water, and knead it well; set it again to rise, and when well risen, make it up in loaves, and bake in the usual way. A stale loaf may be renewed by being dipped in water, and then set in a moderate oven till thoroughly heated. Tea-cakes and muffins may be renewed in the same way, laying them on warm tins. o

163 VEGETARIAN COOKERY. No. 375.—Stewed Cherries. Take the stalks off a pound of Kentish cherries, and put the fruit into a pan, with quarter of a pound of sugar and the juice of a lemon ; place them over the fire, occasionally shaking the pan round; simmer about two minutes; take them out with a colander-spoon, and put them in a basin till cold ; reduce the syrup to a proper consistency, and pour it over the cherries.

Strawberries may be used instead of raspberries. No. 379.—Stewed French Plums. Put half a pound of French plums into a pan, with half a pint of water, the rind half a lemon, cut thin, two cloves, and

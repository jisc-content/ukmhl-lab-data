INTfiODUCTIOU. S3 Denmark, Poland, Germany, Turkey, Greece, Switzerland, Spain, and Portugal; the bone and muscle of all these countries being built up upon the vegetable products of the earth. As examples presented in the history of individuals, there are many that could be cited, both of ancient and modern times, as Pythagoras, Plutarch, Zeno the stoic, Diogenes the cynic, Plato, Epicurus, Proclus, Empedocles, Socion, Quintus Sextus, Apollonius Tyana:us, Porphyry, and recently, Kitson, Haller, Drs. Cheyne and Lambe, Newton, Shelley, Hufeland, the benevolent Howard, Swedenborg, Wesley, and others, as well as many of the present time who are identified mth the Vegetarian movements in this country and America. Manjf instances to prove the health, longevity, and strength of classes of men carrying out this practice, can also be quoted from the experience of the world. The pattamars of India, who travel such extraordinary distances on foot, as carriei-s of despatches, mentioned by Sir John Sinclair, subsist upon moderate portions of rice ; the Poles and Hungarians of the Carpathian mountains were of the hardiest and most untiring soldiers in the army of Buonaparte, their great endurance being justly traceable to the simplicity of their dietetic practices ; whilst the men who lift and carry the heaviest bur- dens, as the porters of Morocco, Smyrna, and Spain, with the coolies of Canton, are aU adherents to the simplest habits of diet. The Greek boatmen, again, are instances demonstrative of superiority as to sfrength and development of body, as well as hilarity, which characterizes them, and bestows a cheerful- ness over all their occupations. We quote one or two instances, to add force to omâ€™ remarks upon this subject, and made neces- sary, perhaps, by the erroneous opinion prevalent, that beef-fed and porter-drinking labourers of Great Britain are the strongest men in the world ; while, in fact, their utmost lifting of weights and carrying of burdens does not in any degree approximate to the ordinary labours of the various classes of men of whom we are speaking, whose diet is, notwithstanding, black bread, figs, dates, raisins, and other such fruits, and whose choicest bever- age is a glass of iced water.

No. 706.—Mushrooms Take any quantity of button mushrooms; wipe them with flannel and salt, putting them into water as they are done; then wash them, and put them into a clean brass or block-tin pan, adding salt; set them over a slow fire for ten or fifteen minutes; drain them in a sieve, and spread them on a cloth till cold; then put them in bottles, with the cold liquid previously drained from them ; cork the bottles, and either cement them, or use Betts’s capsules. No. 707.—Onions. Peel some small onions, and put them as they are done, into a jar of strong salt and water; cover them, and change the brine once each day for three successive days ; then set them over the fire in milk and water, till near boiling; drain, and lay them between two clean cloths; when dry, put them in jars or bottles ; boil some distilled vinegar, adding salt, white pepper, mace, and one or two bay leaves, and when cold, pour it on the onions. They will not look white with any other vinegar. No. 708.—Walnuts. Boil some strong salt and water; skim it well; pour it over the walnuts, and let them remain six days; make a strong brine; ^drain, and put them into it, and let them remain a week; then drain,and dry them with a cloth; poiu over them, when quite hot, as much good vinegar, boiled with mace, all- spice, bruised vinegar, scraped horse-radish, and black pepper- corns, as ivill cover them ; a little garlic and mustard seed may be added, and when cold, cover, and tie them closely. They will be ready in six months. Walnuts are more liable to become black and soft when they have been steeped in brine, but are sooner ready for use. They should be gathered before the shells become hard. 8

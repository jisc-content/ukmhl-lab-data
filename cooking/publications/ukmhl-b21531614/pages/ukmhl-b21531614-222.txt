VEGETARIAN COOKERY. 214 of butter, six ounces of currants, or Sultana raisins, the grated rind of a lemon, and half a pint of buttermilk. Rub the soda very fine, and mix it well in the flour, adding a pinch of salt, then the sugar, grated lemon-peel, and currants, or raisins, the butter, melted, and the eggs, well beaten; mix all well together with the buttermilk, and bake immediately in buttered tins, in a rather quick oven.. CAKES. No. 554.—Almond Cake. Six ounces of sweet almonds, half a pound of powdered sugar, seven eggs, six ounces of flour, the grated rinds of two lemons, and one spoonful of orange-flower water. Pound the almonds with the orange-flower water, till quite fine; then add the yolks of the eggs, well beaten, and the lemon-peel; gradually stir in the flour as lightly as possible; add the whites of the eggs, beaten to a strong froth, and bake in a buttered mould, in a moderately hot oven. When set in the oven, the mould should be placed in a pie- dish, to prevent the cake being burnt. No. 555.—Almond Cakes. One ounce of almonds, five ounces of flour, two ounces of butter, five ounces of sugar, and one egg. Rub the butter in the flour, add the sugar, finely powdered, the egg, well beaten, the almonds, blanched and pounded, and a little almond flavour; mix all together ; roll it in balls about the size of a nutmeg; sift fine sugar over, and bake them lightly on a buttered tin. No. 556.—Almond Biscuits. Half a pound of almonds, three quarters of a pound of loaf sugar, quarter of a pound of flour, six eggs, the grated rinds of two lemons, one ounce of candied citron, and one table-spoonful of rose-water, or orange-flower water.

269 TEOETARIAN COOKERY. No. 760.—Linseed Cough Syrup. Three ounces of linseed, one ounce of liquorice-root, one ounce of Italian-juice, one large lemon, and two ounces of sugar-candy, honey, or brown sugar. Wash the linseed, and set it on the fire, with the Hquorice- root, and Italian-juice, in three pints of water; after boiling a little, set it where it will just simmer, closely covered, for three or four hours, occasionally stirring it; strain it through a sieve, and put it into a clean pan with the juice of the leihon, sugar-candy, or honey, and simmer quarter of an hour. This syrup does quite as well stewed in a covered jar in a moderate oven, stirring it occasionally. Half a tea-cupful to be taken warm, three or four times a day. No. 761.—Orange and Lemon Syrup. To twelve oranges, allow three lemons; squeeze out the juice, and strain it, adding as much loaf sugar as ivill make it a nice thick syrup. A small wine-glassful to be taken three times a day. No. 762.—Substitute for Cod-Liver Oil. One tea-spoonful of powdered gum-arabic, one tea-spoonful of powdered loaf sugar, two tea-spoonfuls of olive oil, and the yolk of an egg, well beaten. Mix all well together, adding as much warm water as will make it of the consistency of cream. This quantity is for one dose, to be taken every night. It is better to have the gum-arabic and sugar mixed at the chemist’s, and kept iu a bottle.

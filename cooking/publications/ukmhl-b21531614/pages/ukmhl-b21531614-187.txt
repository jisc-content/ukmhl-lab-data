One pint and a half of cream, the whites of three eggs, one ounce and a half of isinglass, * six ounces of white sugar, a very little saffron, and two table-spoonfuls of orange-flower water. Dissolve the isinglass in three quarters of a pint of water, add- ing the saffron, steeped in orange-flower water; when strained, put it into a pan, with the cream, sugar, and the whites of three eggs, well beaten; let the w'hole boil together quarter of an hour, and then strain it through a lawn sieve into a mould, previously dipped in cold water. No. 440.—Lemon Cream. One pint of cream, two eggs, four ounces of white sugar, and one lemon. Beat well the yolks of the eggs ; put them to the cream and sugar, adding the rind of the lemon, pared very thin; set it on a moderate fire, stirring constantly till it boils; pour it into a basin, and stir till nearly cold; put the juice of the lemon in a .. bowl, and pour the cream upon it, stirring till quite cold, and serve in a glass dish. No. 441.—Orange Cream. Four oranges (one Seville), the yolks of four eggs, one pint of cream, five ounces of sugar, and two spoonfuls of orange-flower water. Pare the oranges very thin, and boil the peel till tender; then * It boB been reasonably objected that Isinglass is not a proper element of Vegetarian cookery ; but it does not appear that it has yet been entirely superseded by any extract from the vegetable kingdom. Irish moss and Iceland moss are found to answer very well in some instances, as in re- ceipt No. 457 ; and it is probable that when chemical science shall be more completely applied to the art of preparing food, a substance superior in all respects to the isinglass commonly used, will be obtained from vegetable productions.

It is quite true that in times past, as well as now, there have always been eminent men of the medi- cal profession who have supported views in favour of abstinence from flesh as food; and some there now are, who, like Dr. Mattson of Boston, and the physicians and surgeons who have joined the Vegetarian organisation, “having formerly in common with their medical brethren believed that the flesh of animals, as food, was essential to the full development of the physical constitution, have, since facts opposed to this belief have been presented to their attention, seen abundant reason for changing their opinions, and now ibllow out abstinence from the flesh of animals, as food, in their own cases, and prescribe this in all others where the prejudiees of society will permit them.” We conceive, therefore, that society has more to blame its o\vn

INTRODUCTION’. 6 as in other respects, that ho is a fruit and grain eating animal, closely approximating in his physical constitution to the simi®, a tribe of animals subsisting entirely on fruits, roots, and grain, and provided with teeth similar to those of man, the principal difference being, that the canine or eye-teeth are generally much more developed than in man. Indeed, the canine teeth argument is very unfortunate, in proving far too much for the mixed diet system ; since, if accepted as ordinarily presented, as indicating that man is to consume flesh, the inference would be, that the monkey tribe, as well as the horse and the camel, which possess these teetli more developed than man, should necessarily be more carnivorous than he. We have probably bestowed somewhat more attention upon this opposing argument than it in itself merits, since the objec- tion is but the result of false reasoning, and has never been enter- tained by the greatest naturalists and physiologists who have fully directed their attention to this subject, a few brief extracts from the writings of whom we here present, as confirmatory of our position, as well as for the redemption of those great authorities from the popular error attempted to be fixed upon them. Linn^us, one of the most celebrated naturalists, speaking of fruit, says“ This species of food is that which is most suitable to man: which is evinced by the series of quadrupeds; analogy; wild men; apes ; the structure of the mouth, of the stomach, and the hands.” ♦ Baron Cuvier, whose knowledge of comparative anatomy was indisputably profound, and whose authority is therefore entitled to the greatest respect, writes thusFruits, roots, and the succulent parts of vegetables, appear to be the natural food of man : his hands afford him a facility in gathering them ; and his short and comparatively weak jaws, his short canine teeth, not passing beyond the common lino of the others, and the tuberculous teeth, would not permit him either to feed on herb- age or devour flesh, unless those aliments were previously pre- pared by the culinary processes.” Gassendi, after a careful comparison of the teeth of man with those of other animals, declares ” Wherefore, I repeat that * “ Li.VN.Ki Am.'enitates Academic®," voL x. p. 8.

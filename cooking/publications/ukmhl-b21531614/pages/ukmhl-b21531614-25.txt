INTRODUCTIOK. 17 strong appetites upon these sxibjects than the medical profession, wliich may have many things to say which cannot now be borne, and we look to the progress of knowledge to reinstate this class of professional men in their true position of advisers to secure hc^th, instead of being, as is now generally the case, called, in the perversions of society, only to minister to the results of error and disease. A difficulty is presented at this stage of our progress, in the conviction of the consumers of the flesh of animals, as to the very different results produced by food of a farinaceous and vegetable nature, and that derived from the flesh of animals. We at once admit that the sensations, the result of partaking of food composed wholly or in part of flesh, are very different; but this arises from the stimulating and febrile action of flesh upon the stomach, and may be due, and most probably is, to causes involved in the concentrated character of flesh as com- pared to its bulk, or to the absence of the alkaline characteristics of such food, and thus to its general abnormal effects upon the system. To whatever cause, however, the stimulation and febrile effects of flesh are due, they certainly exist, and account for the difference in sensation produced by such food as com- pared with the bland and calm effects resulting from the diges- tion of farinaceous and vegetable products. Flesh may be popularly considered the brandy of diet, as communicating to the system a degree of that stimulation which answers, in kind, to the stimulus of alcohol, and actually produces on the coats of the stomach the heightened febrile action which Dr. Beau- mont observed, and which is altogether apart from its nutritive or normal heat-forming principles, whilst the meal of farina- ceous food (nearly altogether heat-forming in its principles) was digested, leaving the coats of the stomach cool, and of their natural colour. It is to the above-mentioned febrile effects of flesh, that the heightened pulse, and degree of more restless habit consequent upon partaking of flesh as food is due. Unquestionably, the changes of the system occur in another way on the mixed than on the Vegetarian diet, and with less favourable and healthful action, as well as less of endurance, whether physical or mental, c

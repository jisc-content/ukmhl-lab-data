253 VEGETARIAN COOKERY. No. 691.—Lemon Essence. Rasp or grate the lemons very thin ; to quarter of a pound of raspings allow a pound of white sugar, powdered or rolled ; mix till well incorporated, press it down in small jars ; cover with white paper, brushed over with white of egg, a little beaten, and in one month it ivill be ready. No. 692.—Quintessence of Lemon-Peel. To one drachm of the best oil of lemon, take two ounces of the best rectified spirits of wine, introduced by degrees till the spirit completely mixes with the oil. Tliis useful preparation possesses all the fragiance and flavour of the freshest lemon-peel; a few drops on sugar will be sufli- cient to flavour anything in which it may ho used. No. 693.—To Keep Lemon-Juice. Keep the lemons in a cool place several days ; then cut them, and squeeze the juice into a basin ; sti'aiu it through thin and afterwards through thick muslin, and pour it into small phials, perfectly clean and dry; fill them so near the top as only to admit half a tea-spoonful of olive oil into each; cork the bottles, and set them upright in a cool place. When wanted for use, open only such a sized bottle as will be used iu a day or two ; ivind a bit of clean cotton round a skewer, and dip it in so as to remove the oil. The juice will then be as fine as when first bottled. No. 694.—Evitrton Toffy. Two pounds of brown sugar, three quarters of a pound of butter, and twenty drops of essence of lemon. Warm, and rub a pan with butter; put in the sugar with five table-spoonfuls of water, and boil it over a slow fire till it becomes a smooth, thick syrup; then stir in the butter, and when it has boiled about three quarters of an hour, drop a little into a cup of cold water, and if it becomes hard, it is enough ; stir in the essence of lemon, and pour it about half or three quarters of an inch thick, on dishes warmed and buttered. Essence of ginger may be used instead of essence of lemon.

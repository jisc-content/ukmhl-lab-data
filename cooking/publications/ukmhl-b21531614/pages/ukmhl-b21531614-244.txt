236 VEGETARIAN COOKERY, No. 628.—Greengage Jam. Pare the plums and take out the stones. To eaeh pound of fruit, allow a pound and a quarter of loaf sugar ; boil the skins and stones in a pint of water. Put the fruit and sugar into the pan, adding the water, strained from the skins and stones, and let it boil half an hour, or forty minutes. No. 629.—Plum Jam. After taking out the stones and cutting out any bruised spots, set the plums over a slow fire with half a pint of water ; when scalded, rub them through a hair sieve; to each pound of pulp put one pound of powdered loaf sugar; set it over a brisk, clear fire, stirring it well to prevent burning; when it boils, skim it well, and boil quickly a quarter of an hour, stirring it all the time, and then pour it into small pots. Plums of any kind, more especially the larger kinds, as green- gages, magnum-bonums, apricots, or large red plums, may be used. No. 630.—Strawberry Jam. Weigh some ripe scarlet strawberries ; bruise them, and add a little juice of red currants; allow twelve ounces of sugar to each pound of fruit; set it over a clear fire ; boil forty minutes, and pour into sweetmeat-pots. No. 631.—Apple Jelly. Pare and cut a peck of apples ; put them with the rinds of two lemons, pared thin, into a pan, with sufficient water to cover them, and let them boil till reduced to a pulp; then strain through a flannel jelly-bag, and when the juice is quite clear, boil it half an hour, adding the juice of four lemons, and the sugar, allowing one pound to each pint of juice, carefully skim- ming it the whole time. Pour it into small jars, and when cold, cover them in the usual way. The colour of the jelly may bo greatly improved by adding a few drops of burnt sugar, which may be done by holding a hot Italian heater over the jelly, applying the sugar to it (so that as it dissolves it may drop into the jelly), and stirring it well.

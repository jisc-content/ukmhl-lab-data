INTRODUCTION. 31 the promulgation of the appointed food of man, as simply and beautifully presented in the words,—“Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed ; to you it shall be for meat.’’* And the more earnestly do we refer to this, because the scientific revelations of the greatest enlightenment have hitherto declared for precisely the same character of food ; manifesting that what was prescribed when all things were declared to be “ very good,” is still the natural and best food of man. We submit, therefore, that the above objection originates merely in a misconception of Scripture. As a fit sequel to the various argmnents already presented in the treatment of our subject, we now approach the experience of the system we would commend to the attention of the public, and regret that our space for this department is far too limited to admit of more than a bare reference to the evidence that could be brought to bear upon it. The doubt so frequently expressed as to the possibility of subsistence upon a diet apart from fiesb, ought long since to have been exploded, by the mei’e notice of the animal creation, where we see the massive carcasses of the herbivorous animals actually built up on the simplest products of natui-e, and to a degi'ee of strength and endurance of fatigue altogether surpassing those of correspond- ing developments in the carnivorous classes of animals. We will not, therefore, anticipate doubts at this stage of our reasoning, as to the practicability of the Vegetarian system of diet, since these must necessarily be removed by a very limited inquiry upon the subject. Wo present, however, the con- clusion arrived at by the able writer in the Meview from which we have already quoted: “ In concluding, then, that the Vegetable kingdom is perfectly capable of supplying the necessary wants of man under all ordinary circumstances ; and that, in particu- lar, it is quite-adequate to the production of an amount of physical force which can probably not be permanently sur- passed on any other dietetic system, wo consider that the advocates of Vegetarianism have a wide and secure basis of ex- perience, such as can scarcely be shaken by any negative testi *Gen. i. 29.

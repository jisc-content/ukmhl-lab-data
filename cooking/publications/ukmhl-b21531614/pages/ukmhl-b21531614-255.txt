VnOETARIAN COOKERY. 247 No. 667.—Mulberry Syrup. Pick the mulberries, and put them in a jar mth very little water; set the jar in a pan of water on the fire; when suffi- ciently done, that the juice will easily separate from the fruit, strain through a fine hair sieve ; to each quart of clear juice allow one pint and a half of clarified S3rrup ; boil over a slow fire till perfectly clear, and bottle it when cold. No. 668.—Orange Syrup. Squeeze the juice when the frait is in its best state, and strain through fine muslin or flannel; take equal quantities of juice and clarified syrup; boil it mth a little of the rind, pared very thin; when quite clear, pour it into a jug, and when cold, bottle it in small bottles. Lemon Syrup may be prepared in the same way, allomng half a pint more of the clarified syrup to a pint of lemon-juice. No. 669.—Raspberry and Currant Syrup. To four quarts of water put eight pounds of broken sugar and two beaten whites of eggs, stirring it whilst cold till the sugar is nearly dissolved ; set it on the fire, and proceed as directed with Clarified Syrup (No. 662); when clear, add one quart of currant and one of raspben-y-juice which has been pressed from ripe fruit and strained ; boil it briskly half an hour, taking off the scum quite clean ; when cold, put it in a stone jar, adding a very small bit of isinglass, about one eighth of an ounce, dis- solved in a little of the syrup ; close it well, and let it remain undisturbed for three months, and then, if perfectly clear, bottle it. No. 670.—Vinegar Syrup. Dissolve three pounds and a half of sugar, well bruised, in two pints and a half of good vinegar ; boil it gently to form a syrup, skimming it till clear from any scum. A table-spoonful of this, or ginger syrup, is an agreeable addition to any of the milder syrups, when mi.xed with water.

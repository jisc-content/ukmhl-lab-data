42 INTRODUCTION. instance, the full breadth and importance of the question come at length to be recognised and appreciated. We would not be understood to speak of the good of adherence to this system, otherwise than as the result of obedience to laws in intimate relation with the greatest happiness of the human constitution ; but claiming thus much for it, it will be seen that it involves important consequences to the physical and moral peace of the world. We fear it is vain to regard mankind as the sole object for the exercise of the principles of peace, and to say that when these prevail in relation to him, unity and harmony of purpose will characterize the conduct of men, whilst the fact is overlooked that the conduct of mankind is powerfully influenced for evil by the cruelties and mistaken practices carried out towards the bnite creation. We contend, then, for our system, as essential not only to the harmonious relations of manâ€™s nature necessary to secure happiness, but also to his har- monious relation to the external world intended to surround him ; and that the degree in which man practically acknow- ledges the importance of these and other kindred principles, will be that in which the peace and harmony of the world can exist. It is therefore no objection to this that the world seems disorganised and contentious to the last degree, ever involving itself in acts the very opposite to those we would advocate as incident to the fairer and better history of man living in full accordance with the laws of his being. The discouragement of knowing the world as it is, necessarily ever detracts much from the philanthropic effort to make it what it ought to be ; but though our views have to be judged of in the disadvantage of erroneous practice (requiring, if fully apprehended, to be exam- ined with clearer perceptions than those influenced by the system against which we are contending), our strongest hopes are buUt upon the convictions which the practice of our princi- ples will necessarily produce, and to this practice we believe facts such as we have stated wOl, day by day, lead the enlight- ened and reflective of all classes. Our system, then, is the result of no new doctrine, but of principles established in human nature, and of a practice as old ns the history of man. Vegetarianism, in its mission, thus

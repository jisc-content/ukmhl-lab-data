Mix the soda and a very little salt with the flour ; rub in the butter ; add the egg, well beaten, and as much buttermilk as required to make it a stiff paste ; knead till quite smooth, then roll it; cut out the biscuits, prick them, and bake imme- diately in a moderately hot oven. No. 544.—Rusks. Three pounds of flour, six ounces of sifted sugar, six ounces of butter, one ounce of German yeast, and one pint and a half of new milk. Rub the butter well in the flour, adding the sugar, and a tea- spoonful of salt; put the milk and a little wann water to the yeast in the usual way ; mix it into the middle of the flour so as to form a light batter; cover and set it to rise; when risen, mix, and let it rise half an hour longer ; then roU it into cakes about five or six inches in length and two inches broad, and bake in a moderately hot oven. When baked, and quite cold, cut them in thin slices, and dry them on tins in a moderate oven, tm-ning them over occasionally. No. 545.—Cheese Snaps. Divide a new loaf, when quite hot, by pulling it in halves ; take out pieces about the sise of a walnut, ivith a fork ; put them on a dish, and set them in a rather quick oven to brown lightly.

VEGETARIAN COOKERY. 115 No. 203.—Tomato Sauce. Take off the stalks, cut in two, ten or twelve tomatoes; squeeze them a little, to get out the water and seeds ; then put them in a jar, with a capsicum and three table-spoonfuls of water; cover, and set them in a moderately hot oven till quite soft; rub them through a sieve into a saucepan, adding a little salt and white pepper; simmer over the fire a few minutes, and serve in a sauce-tureen. Another way is to add to the pulp a dessert-spoonful of flour, or a table-spoonful of fine bread crumbs, and three table-spoon- fuls of hot water; stew gently ten minutes; take it off the fire, and stir in t\vo oimces of butter, till quite melted, and serve as above. No. 204.—White Sauce. Half a pint of mushroom broth, quarter of a pint of new milk, half an oimce of onion, a blade of mace, one ounce of flour, one ounce and a half of butter, juice of a lemon, two yolks of eggs, and four table-spoonfuls of good cream. Set the milk and mushroom broth on the fire -\vith the onion, cut iu pieces, and the mace, and boU ten minutes ; stir the flour and butter, previously mixed, well in till it boils; let it stand near the fire or stove, stirring it occasionally, till it be- comes quite smooth ; then pass it through a fine tin strainer ; return it into the pan, with a little sauce and the juice of a small lemon ; beat the yolks of the eggs, and add the cream; strain it into the sauce, and stir it over a moderate fire, but do not let it boil, or it wiU curdle. A very good white sauce may be made by putting a few mushrooms, previously rubbed through a sieve, into some but- ter sauce, adding a little cream and seasoning powder (No. 214). Wlien sauces are finished with eggs, use only the yolks, and mix them first with a spoonful or two of the sauce ; then with the whole, off the fire ; when well mixed, set the pan on the fire, stirring it constantly till near boiling, but on no account allow it to boil after the eggs are put in.

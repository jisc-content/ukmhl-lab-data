93 VEGETARIAN COOKERY. VEGETABLES. All green vegetables should be as fresh as possible. Put them into cold water with some salt in it, for about ten minutes, to clear from soil or insects. If not quite fresh, let them remain in the water some time longer; drain in a colander, and put them into a pan with plenty of boiling water, adding salt, and a small piece of soda ; cover the pan till boiling, but not after- wards ; then boil quickly, and carefully remove any scum which may rise. Do not allow them to remain in the water after they are done, but immediately drain them in a colander, and finish each kind as directed in the receipts. Peas and spinach do not require so much water as most other green vegetables, but only just sufficient to cover them. Cauliflowers and broccoli require especial care in boiling, as the flower is easily broken and their appearance spoiled ; boil them quickly for a few minutes, and then moderately till tender, which may be easily ascertained by trying the stem with a fork. All vessels used in cooking vegetables should be particularly clean. Soft, is preferable to hard water in cooking all kinds of vegetables. No. 112.—Artichokes. Strip off a few of the outer leaves and twist off the stalks ; lay them, rvith the leaves dorvnwards, in cold water with salt in it, for half an hour ; wash and drain them well; put them into a pan of boiling water, adding salt and a small piece of soda ; keep them covered with the water by placing a plate over that will fit inside the pan, or partly cover with the pan-lid, adding boil- ing water as required ; boil about two hours ; to try them, draw out a leaf, and if it comes out easily, they are sufficiently done ; drain, place them in a vegetable dish, and serve with butter- sauce in a boat. No. 113.—Jerusalem Artichoke.s. Wash and brush the artichokes, but do not peel them ; boil them as potatoes ; drain and peel them, and serve hot in a vegetable dish, with butter sauce poured over them.

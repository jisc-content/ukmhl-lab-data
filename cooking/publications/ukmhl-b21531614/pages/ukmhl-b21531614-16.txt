INTUODUCTION. 8 We now call attention to the following statistics, presenting the composition of various articles of food, the results of the analyses made by distinguished chemists, principally of the Liebig school of chemistry, including those of Dn. Lyon Play- FAin, Boussingault, and others, in which the composition of food is presented under the three great heads of requirement already mentioned, premising merely, that in addition to mat- ter to foim the animal heat and the blood of the body, as well as ashes, a certain amount of innutritions matter accompanies most articles of food, and that this has been declared by certain physiologists to be of considerable importance ; bulk, as well as nutrition, being considered essential to the healthy action of food in the process of digestion.

We see, however, notwithstanding this allowance, how erroneous is the impression which has been entertained as to the high nutritive value of

INTRODUCTION. 27 the latter of these callings, which compels many of our fellow- creatures to pass their lives in an occupation more or less degmding, and in nearly every case offensive (where depravity has not completed its work) to the tastes and preferences of the individual. Far then from having hostUity to any class of men thus condemned to an unfavourable occupation, we would merely no longer by our demands necessitate the existence of such a class, neither degiading any human beings, nor subse- quently looking do^vn upon them as inferiors, but giving to such, in the progress of our principles, an occupation more in accord- ance with the enlightenment of morals, as well as >vith their early preferences. To the almost invariablj' suggested difficulty of “ What shall be done with the animals ?” in the praetice of our system, we simply direct the attention to the fact, that as the disuse of the flesh of animals as food must necessarily be progressive, the difficulty here presented would be as progressively obviated—a less demand ever inducing a diminished supply—till the number of cattle would be reduced, as is already the case mth certain classes of animals which are not consumed as food, and which still do not exist in inconvenient numbers; On the objections raised from the wants of society as to various articles of commercial demand, produced as results of the slaughter of animals for food, sueh as leather, fur, and various other articles, we have simply to remark, that these are merely questions of demand and supply, which the necessities of the time will of themselves completely settle. Already have we, in the limited demand set up for various articles, felt, gutta- pereha, and india-rubber, tending to supersede the use of the skins of animals ; and as soon as the demand is more generally raised for other substitutes of this nature, will the supply as certainly follow, just as has been demonstrated by the iuterest- ing illustration of the sequence of supply to demand in connec- tion with the Penny Postage system. The quills of the goose’s wing formerly supplied the letter-writing world in the heavy postage system ; but since the penny stamp was introduced, as a mighty lever to the progress of truth and civilisation, pro- ducing its millions of letter-writers, the goose quill became in-

When the potatoes have been boiled and dried, mash them with the butter and half a pint of milk, and rub them through a wire sieve into the flour. Mix the remainder of the warm milk with the yeast, and when settled, pour it to the flour, and mix all together ; let it rise before the fire ; then make it into common-sized rolls, and bake them in a quick oven. No. 508.—Luncheon Cake. One pound of flour, two drachms of bi-carbonate of soda, three ounces of sugar, three ounces of butter, and half a pint of sour buttermilk. Mix the soda well with the flour; rub in the butter ; add the sugar, and buttermilk; mix all together; put it into a buttered tin, and bake immediately in a quick oven. No. 509.—Soda Cake. One pound of flour, quarter of a pound of butter, quarter of a pound of sugar, half a pound of currants, three eggs, a large tea-spoonful of carbonate of soda, and a tea-cupful of milk.

Either toast them lightly; or lay them on a cake- tin, and cover them with a clean wet cloth; set them in tho oven, and when hot through, butter them in the usual way. No. 519.—Crumpets. Two pounds of flour, half a pint of new milk, one pint of water, one egg, and half an ounce of baking powder.

When all the dough is made into balls, the first which was laid on the tray will be ready for baking, and will spread out into the form of a mufiBn ; lay each one on the hot plate or bake-stone, and as the bottom begins to change colour, turn it on the other side, being very careful to avoid burning.

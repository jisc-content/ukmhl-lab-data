INTRODUCTION. 4 tinal canal. The supposed seientific reason for the consumption of flesh is more generally presented than any other; and the statement that man has got an arrangement of teeth intermediate between those of the herbivora on the one hand, and the carnivora on the other, has led to the strange conclusion that man was des- tined to eonsume both flesh and vegetable produets ; the strength of the argument depending on a eomparison of the teeth and the intestinal eaual of man, with those of the herbivora and carnivora, to the latter of which they -have been said most to approximate. ilen are prone, in their examination of this question, in which appetite is coneerned, to attempt to reason from their likings and practice, instead of taking nature alone as theiiâ€™ standard, and being ready, in the impartial view of the faets she presents, to convict themselves, in case of need, of having departed from the natural and best food of man. It is quite true, that the in- ternal structure, and the teeth of man, indicate that he is an animal different, and intermediate in his conformation, in most respects, to the classes of animals consuming herbage only on the one hand, and flesh solely on the other. But whilst the mistaken process of measuring man from the crown of the head to the feet has been resorted to, by way of comparison as to the proportionate length of the intestinal canal with those of the two tribes of animals above mentioned, which are measured from the head to the termination of the spine only (thus making him approximate in the physiological structure to the condition of the flesh-eating animals), the broad fact has been altogether overlooked, that, taking man as an intermediate animal, there is an intermediate character of food which precisely suits the var- ious organs of mastication and assimilation which have been con- sidered as the standard of comparison, and that this diet consists of fruits, roots, gi'ain, and vegetables. An impartial view of the question, therefore, presents man as an independent species of animal, with a specific character of food in relation to his physi- cal constitution, altogether differing from herbage on the one hand, or flesh on the other; and when the comparisons insti- tuted between him and other animals are fairly carried out, the intestinal canal is not merely six or seven times the length of his body, but twelve times, leading to the conclusion, in this,

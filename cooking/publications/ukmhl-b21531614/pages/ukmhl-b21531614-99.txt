VEGETARIAN COOKERY. G1 Boil the eggs hard ; cool them in water, taking off the shells, and mince them; boil the milk; add the flour and butter, previously mixed together, and the parsley, chopped; season with pepper and salt, and boil it four or five minutes; then add the eggs and shake the whole frequently till thoroughly heated, but without stirring, and garnish with toasted sippets and lemon. No. 105.—Poached Eggs. Pour some boiling water from a tea-kettle (after standing a minute or two to settle) into a broad stew-pan ; put in a dessert- spoonful of salt, and a table-spoonful of vinegar; when the water boils, if any scum arise, skim it; take the pan ofif the fire ; break the eggs separately into a cup, and slip them care- fully into the water ; cover the pan, and place it over a very moderate fire, and when the water boils and the whites are properly set, take them up carefully with a slice ; tiim off the ragged part of the whites, and lay the eggs on squares of buttered toast. No. 106.—To Preserve Eggs for Boiling in the Shell. Take any quantity of fresh laid eggs ; boil them one minute and a half, and when wanted for use, boil them the usual time. No. 107.—To Preserve Eggs for Winter use. Put the eggs in a deep earthen jar or stew-pot in lime-water, with half a pound of salt in it. To prepare the lime-water, put four gallons of water to three pounds of slaked quick-lime in a covered vessel, and when clear it is ready for use. If covered with salt only, they keep very well. In preserving eggs, great care should be taken that the shells be perfectly free from cracks.

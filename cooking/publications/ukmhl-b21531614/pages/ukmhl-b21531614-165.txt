157 VEGETARIAN COOKERY. No. 352.—Prune Tart. Scald the prunes, and after taking out the stones, put them into a saucepan with a little water and sugar; simmer over a slow fire about ten minutes ; then pour them into a basin, and when rather cool, add a little raspberry vinegar or lemon-juice. Line a flat dish with paste ; put in the prunes ; cover with paste, and bake in a moderately hot oven. No. 353.—Tarts. Koll out some puff paste (No. 364) about a quarter of an inch thick; cut it in round cakes with a tin eutter about three inches across ; then cut a piece out of half the cakes with a tin cutter about two inches across, leaving a rim or border about half an inch broad ; wet the edges of the cakes ivith as little water as possible, and lay the rims of paste on each cake ; bake in a moderately hot oven ; lay them on a dish, and when quite cold, put preserved fruit in each tart. No. 354.—Tartlets. These are tarts without covem, made in flat dishes. Cover the dish with puff paste; then put a thin strip of paste round the edge of the dish, and fill the centi-e wth rasp- berry jam, or any other preserved fruit. Decorate the top of the jam with narrow bars of paste, crossed all over, or stamped leaves. No. 355.—Turnovers. Roll out some short paste (No 366), about one-eighth of an inch thick; cut it in pieces about four inches in length and between two and three inches in breadth ; lay on each a little raspberry jam, or any other preserved fruit, without syrup; turn the edges over, wetting them as little as possible with water; press them lightly together, and also the ends ; lay them on tins, and bake in a moderately hot oven. Ice them (as in No. 369), and return them to the oven for a few minutes, or set them in a Dutch or American oven before the fire.

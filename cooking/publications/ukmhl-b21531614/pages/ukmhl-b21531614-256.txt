VEGETARIAN COOKERY. 248 No. 671.—Lemonade. Pour a quart of boiling water on the rind of a lemon, pared very thin; cover it, and when cold, add the juice of three lemons, and white sugar as required, and strain through muslin. A little cinnamon or ginger boiled in the water is an agree- able addition. No. 672.—Orange and Lemonade. Three China oranges, one large lemon, and three ounces of sugar. Rub off the rind of a lemon and some of the orange with the lumps of sugar; put it in a jug with the juice of the fruit, strained; pour on a quart of boiling water, and when cold, strain through muslin. No. 673.—Portable Lemonade. One lemon and quarter of a pound of loaf sugar. Rub off the rind of the lemon with the sugar, broken in pieces; bruise the sugar; add the juice, strained ; put it into a jar ; and when wanted for use, dissolve a table-spoonful of it in a glass of water. If too sweet, a very small portion of citric acid may be added. It will keep a considerable time. A large table-spoonful of lemon syrup in a small tumbler of water, answers very well for lemonade. No. 674.—Apple Beverage. Boil five or six ripe juicy apples, each cut into several pieces, in two quarts of water, till quite soft; strain through a sieve, and add sugar as required. No. 675.—Apple Beverage. Set two quarts of water on the fire, and when boiling, put in four quite ripe pippin apples, each cut in eight slices, without ]taring; boil till the apples are quite soft; pass the water through a sieve, pressing the apples gently against the sides of the .sieve, but not rubbing them through ; add sufficient honey to make it a little sweet, and serve lukewarm.

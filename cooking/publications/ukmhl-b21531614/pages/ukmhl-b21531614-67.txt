VEGETARIAN COOKERY. SOUPS The precise time required for the preparation of soups, depends upon the quality of the water used ; the limits given are gene- rally applicable, soft water producing the earliest and most satisfactory results. The soups containing peas, beans, lentOs, or barley, should be prepared the day previously, and heated when required. No. 1.—Almond Soup. Ingredients.—Two ounces of almonds,* one pint and a half of new milk, half a pint of cream, one table-spoonful of flour, one onion, one root of celery, and one ounce of butter. Instructions.—Blanch and chop the almonds small; boil them gently one hour, in a pint of milk, with the onion and the white part of the celery ; take out the onion and celery ; mix the flour and butter together ; add half a pint of-milk, a little Cayenne pepper, mace, and salt; stir the soup on the fire till it has boiled a few minutes ; add the cream, and when it boils, serve immediately. ’ No. 2.—^Asparagus Soup. To be made in the same way as green peas soup, adding such green vegetables as may be in season ; reserving some of the tender green part of the asparagus, cut in small pieces, to put in after the soup has been rubbed through a sieve. Serve with toasted bread, cut in small square pieces. * For the convenience of those who have notan opportunity of weighing the ingredients, it may be stated, that one large table-spoonful of each will be about equal to one ounce ; one tea-spoonful to a quarter of an ounce. But weighing should bo resorted to wherever it is possible.

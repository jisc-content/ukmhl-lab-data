Como with us, wo would say, and trace the treatment of the ox and the sheep through all their varied stages of cruelty; from the peaceful glade where we behold them in a comparative state of nature, through all the horrors of railway transit and market cruelties, to the “ den of infamy,” where the acts of pro- viding flesh for the table are perpetrated ; and then witness the cutting up and exposure of the various parts of these animals, subsequently tracing them through the domestic operations brought to bear to convert them to the ordinarily approved dishes of the table ; and we are convinced that the adult, as well as the child, would feel repugnance, and would ask the question, “Is this necessary?” if the understanding did not at once accord with the instincts, and declare for a fruit and farinaceous diet in all its purity and beauty, in which the intel- lect and moral feelings, combined with the instincts of nature, can alone rejoice.

Our further remarks have reference to the other position wo hold, that the Vegetarian system of diet is essential to the har- monious relation intended to exist between man and the external

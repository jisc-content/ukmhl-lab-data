INTRODUCTIOK. 11 Nothing could be more conclusive on the question at issue, than the statements here presented as the unbiased decisions of chemical research ; from which it is seen, that far from the nu- triment found in the flesh of animals being peculiar, and superior to that to be obtained from vegetable products, it is merely vege- table nutriment—the proximate principles of vegetables, origin- ating in the vegetable kingdom alone, whence they are transferred to the flesh of animals ; and which, withorrt the process of feed- ing animals for their flesh, could be derived simply and directly Irom the products of the soil. From a consideration of the above argrrments, we arrive at some most important conclusions of a social and political natrrre. With the facts of the compositiorr of food before us, and the knowledge that the nutriment to be derived from the flesh of animals is only vegetable nrrtriment taken in a secondary way, we can readily see that the ordinary impression of the necessity of mixing the flesh of animals with food to heighten its nrrti'itive qualities, and, iir popular phrase, ‘ ‘ making it go farther, is altogether fallacious. We fiird, for instance, in appealing to the facts of the composition of food, that the economic question of “ what does it cost to produce 100 lb. ^yeight of the blood of the body from the various articles of food in ordinary consumption ? is answered in a way altogether condemnatory of flesh as food, when the cost of relying upon the nutriment of flesh is com- pared with that of the identical elements of nutriment derived from vegetable products, as may be readily observed on an in- spection of the following calculations.

VEGETARIAN COOKERT. 149 PANCAKES, SWEET OMELETS AND FKITTEKS. No. 324.—Pancakes. Ten ounces of flour, one quart of milk, three eggs, and a small tea-spoonful of baking powder. Mix the baking powder, rubbed very fine, and a little salt with the flour, stirring in as much milk as will make it a stiff batter; when beaten smooth, add the remainder of the milk, and lastly, the eggs, well beaten; melt a little butter in a fry- ing-pan ; pour in as much batter as will cover the bottom of the pan, to make the pancakes about the thickness of a penny- piece, not thicker; when nearly set, shake the pan round a little, and if the pancake will move freely, turn it over, adding a little more butter; when lightly browned, turn it again, and almost immediately slip it out of the pan on a hot dish, set over a pan or deep dish of boiling water, rolling up each pancake as it is fried, and serve immediately with sugar and lemon-juice. No. 325.—Apple and Custard Pancake, Apples, four eggs, and quarter of a pint of cream. Beat the eggs well, adding the cream and a little cinnamon, or a little almond flavour. Cut the apples in thin slices, and fry them in butter; when browned a little, turn them over; pour in the custard; fry it a light brown; turn it out carefully, and serve with sugar sifted over. No. 326.—French Pancakes. Two ounces of flour, four eggs, throe quarters of a pint of milk, the grated rind of a lemon, and one ounce of white sugar. Mix the flour, sugar, lemon-peel, and a pinch of salt, with a little of the milk; stir till quite smooth; add the yolks of the eggs, well beaten, the remainder of the milk, and then the whites of the eggs, beaten to a stiff froth; put a little clarified butter into six saucers, and bake in a moderately quick oven ; when done, lay two together with preserved fruit between, sift sugar over, and serve immediately.

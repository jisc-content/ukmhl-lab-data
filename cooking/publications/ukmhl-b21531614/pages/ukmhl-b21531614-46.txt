INTRODUCTION. 88 for the table, is offensive both to the eye and the touch ; and thus it is, that all undepraved by the practice feel an instinc- tive dislike to handle it, unjustly condemning the butcher and the cook to do that which would be most repulsive to their own feelings. In our large cities, in many cases, we even inflict fines for the caiTying of butchers’ meat through the streets un- covered ; and whilst our “ Smithlields,” “ Leadenhalls,” and “ Billingsgates ” are notorious as public nuisances, our “ Covent Gardens,” and exhibitions of fruits and flowers, are ever asso- ciated ■with grateful sensations, presenting a contrast in favour of the latter, which all the instinctive feelings of our nature powerfully unite to confirm. The instincts of children, more than those of adults, speak clearly upon this subject; and it is obvious, notwthstanding the force of custom from one generation to another, that the preferences of children are for the fruits and farinaceous sub- stances of the table ; and where, as in Scotland and some parts of the continent, they are trained to the age of eight or ten years 'without any kind of flesh as food, when first partaken of, it is with loathing ; and when they learn to identify it with the living animals familiar to them (with that instinct which adults even frequently demonstrate in not being able to consume the flesh of classes of animals with which they have had some peculiar friendly relationship), it is mth the greatest difficulty that this natural repugnance to flesh is overcome. We contend, then, that it is vain to say that the instinctive feelings of man are supplanted by the force of custom : and om' faith in the humanities of existence leads us strenuously to con- tend for the position, that the slaughter of animals is opposed to the moral nature of man, and that the practice of consuming the bodies of animals but obtains for want of reflection, and through that pell-mell state of existence which keeps the true facts of the case from being reasoned upon. We consider it would be a libel upon the tenderest portion of our nature, to suppose that the fl<'sh and blood of animals could continue to be the food of any but the degraded of society, were it not for the keeping out of sight of the true incidents and accompaniments of slaughter ; and there is no resisting the force of the fact, that the beuevo-

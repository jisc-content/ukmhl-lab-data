VEGETARIAN COOKERY. 206 butter on each side; close them together; then with a sharp knife cut it in quartera, and serve very hot. If more than one muffin be required, cut each separately, and place them lightly one upon another, on the plate. No. 528.—Ferment for Bread. Half an ounce of hops, a few slices of apples, four spoonfuls of treacle, one quart of water, and three quarters of a pound of flour. Boil the hops and apples in the water twenty minutes ; strain off the liquor; add to it the treacle, and stir in the flour, or as much as will make it the consistency of thin batter; cover lightly, and set it in a moderately warm place, till fermentation takes place, which will be in a few hours, and then mix it with the flour. Make the bread in the usual way, except using about double the quantity of the ferment that would be required of common yeast. No. 629.—Flour Yeast. One pound of flour, and quarter of a poimd of brown sugar. Boil the ingredients with a little salt in two gallons of water one hour; when milk-warm, put it in stone bottles and cork it close.

First Momiiig.—BoH two ounces of the best hops in four quarts of clear soft water half an hour ; strain through a hair sieve, and when it becomes about milk-warm, put in two table- spoonfuls of salt, and half a pound of brow sugar ; beat one pound of the best flour with some of the liquid till smooth, then mix all well together, and let it remain two days. Second Morning.—Boil and dry three pounds of good mealy potatoes, mash them well, and mix with the above. While the yeast is in process, it should be kept in a rather warm place, but not too warm, and stirred frequently.

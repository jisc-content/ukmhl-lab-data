187 VEGETAKIAN COOKERY. Put half a pint of cold water to the isinglass; let it remain twenty minutes; put it in a pan with another half-pint of boil- ing water, stirring it till dissolved; then strain it, and add the sugar, the grated rinds of the lemon, and the Seville orange, the lemonade, and juice of the oranges and lemon; boil all together five minutes, and then strain it through muslin. This jelly will not be very clear, but the colour may be im- proved by adding a little saffron. No. 466.—Cream Sponge. One quart of cream, one ounce and a half of isinglass, six ounces of loaf sugar, and one lemon. Boil the isinglass in the cream; strain it into a basin, and let it remain till cool, but not set. Take off the rind of a lemon with the sugar ; then grate the sugar into a bowl; squeeze and strain the lemon-juice upon it; add the cream, and whisk all together till it begins to stiffen ; put it into moulds, and let it remain till the follo\ving day. No. 467.—Lemon Sponge. Three lemons, half a pound of loaf sugar, one ounce of isin- glass, and the white of one egg. Put the rinds of the lemons, pared thin, into a pan with the isinglass and a pint of water; set it on the fire, stirring con- stantly till the isinglass is dissolved ; strain, and let it remain till nearly cold ; then add the sugar, powdered, the juice of three lemons, strained, and the white of an egg, beaten to a froth ; whisk the whole together three quarters of an hour, and pour it into a mould.

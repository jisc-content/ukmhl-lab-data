261 VEGETARIAN COOKERY Soak the sago in cold water a few minutes, and boil it gently about an hour, adding the salt; pour it into soup-plates, and serve with molasses or sugar. No. 722.—Sago and Rice Porridge. Equal quantities of sago and ground rice. Proceed as with sago porridge. No. 723.—Bread Porridge for Infants. Pour boiling water on some thin slices of good light white bread; when cool, drain off the water, and mash the bread till quite fine, adding sufficient new milk to make it a proper thick- ness. It may be warmed as required, but should not be boiled; sugar may be added. When made with water only, it should be boiled a little. No. 724.—Brewis. Cut some bread in thin slices (toasted, if preferred) into a basin ; pour boiling water upon it, and cover with a plate ; let it remain a few minutes, and then stir in a piece of butter, and a little salt. Oatcake toasted and cut in pieces is frequently used. No. 725.—French Panada. Break a stale penny roll in pieces; put it in a saucepan with just sufficient water to cover the bread ; stir it well over the fire, allowing it to boil five minutes; then add half a tea-spoonful of salt, and one ounce of fresh butter; mix, and take it from the fire ; beat the yolk of an egg with two table-spoonfuls of milk or water, and pour it into the panada, stirring very quickly half a minute. Any other nice light bread would answer the purpose as well as the roll. Panada should be rather thicker than gruel, and may be made of milk, but water is preferable, being lighter and most digestible.

Thus our views may well support a little surprise or merriment in t>he uninformed ; and the more so, since there are few cases where attention is brought to bear upon the system in which impressions in its favour are not produced. It is singular, though fortunate for the treatment of this ques- tion, that some of the strongest arguments in relation to external evidence are deduced in support of our system from the im- partial examination of facts supposed to constitute some of the strongest popular objections, and such as are, in the first in- stance, commonly directed against it. We purposed that our exposition of the system should, as much as possible, be shaped by the nature of the objections raised in the minds of individuals in their opposition to the practice of Vegetarianism ; and thus we shall address ourselves to several of the strong points which have hitherto ui)held the practice of consuming the flesh of animals as food.

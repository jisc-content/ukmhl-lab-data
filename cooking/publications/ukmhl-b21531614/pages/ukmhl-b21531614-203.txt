VEGETAKTAN COOKERY. 195 ITo. 495.—Breakfast Bread. Three pounds of flour, three quarters of an ounce of German yeast, two mealy potatoes, one ounce of butter, and one pint and a quarter of new milk. Boil and dry the potatoes ; mash them with the butter and a dessert-spoonful of salt, and mix well with the flour. Pre- pare the yeast with half of th6 milk, a little warm; strain it off into the middle of the flour, stirring it a little ; cover it, and let it remain all night; warm the remainder of the milk, and mix in the dough ; set it before the fire to rise for half an hour ; then make it up in rolls ; lay them on the warm tins; cover with a thin cloth, and when risen a little, bake them in a quick oven. No. 496.—Bre.ad for Buttered Toast. Two pounds of flour, half a pound of boiled potatoes, one ounce of German yeast, half a pint of milk, and a tea-spoonful of salt. Mix the salt with the flour, previously dried; then put in the warm milk, and half a pint of warm water with the yeast; cover with a cloth, and set it before the fire ; when risen, add the potatoes, well dried and mashed, and when well mixed, set it in a warm place to rise, and bake it in a tin, in a moderately hot oven. No. 497.—Scalded Bread. To about one third of the quantity of coarse brown flour in- tended to be used, stir in as much boiling water as will make it a rather stiff paste. Prepare the German yeast as before, allow- ing one ounce to four pounds of flour; set it to rise in sponge with a little lukewarm water ; when well risen, and the scalded flour is become cold, mix, and knead well together, adding the usual quantity of salt and water as required ; let it rise well; put it in a tin ; bake in a quick oven till half done; then care- fully remove it to the upper part of the oven; let it remain several hours, having the oven moderately cool the latter part of the time ; when well baked, fold it in a clean wet cloth, and put it in the cellar a day or two before it is out.

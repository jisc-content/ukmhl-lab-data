VEGETAUIAN COOKERY. 194 No. 492.—Bread with Miller’s Baking Powder. Two pounds of wheat-meal, two tea-spoonfuls or half an ounce of baking powder, and one pint of cold water. Rub the powder very fine, and mix with the meal and salt; pour the water on gradually, stirring it quickly with a wooden spoon into a light dough, which wU not require kneading ; put it in a tin, prepared in the usual way, and either bake imme- diately in a quick oven, or let it remain fifteen or twenty minutes. That all may be well mixed, it is best only to make up one or two loaves at once, which requires only a few minutes, and then another portion in the same way., No. 493.—Bread with Soda and Buttermilk. Brown Bread.—Six pounds of flour, one ounce of carbonate of soda, and four pints of buttermilk. While Bread.—Four pounds of flour, half an ounce of carbo- nate of soda, and two pints of buttermilk. Mix the soda well into the flour, either by rubbing it in with the hands, or sifting it through a fine sieve, adding a little salt; then mix in the buttermilk, quite cold ; put the dough into tins or earthenware baking-pans, warmed and rubbed over with a little butter, and bake immediately in a quick oven. No. 494.—Breakfast Bread. Four pounds of flour, one ounce of German yeast, and one pint of warm mOk. Put the flour into an earthen bowl, adding a little salt. Dis- solve the yeast in three quarters of a pint of warm water; make a hole in the middle of the flour, and clear off the yeast through a fine sieve into the flour, stirring it to set the sponge; cover it and set it in a warm place to rise ; when risen, stir in the warm milk, and when well mixed, return it to a warm place for about three quarters of an hour ; mould it into rolls, twists, or small loaves; place on warm tins, and bake in a quick oven.

237 VEGETARIAN COOKERY. No. 632.—Apple Jelly. Take out the stalks and cut out the blossom end of seven pounds of good ripe baking apples, without paring or taking out the cores; cut them in pieces, and boil or bake in tw'o quarts of water till reduced to a pulp ; pour it into a jelly-bag, placed near the fire; when clear, allow eight ounces of loaf sugar to each pound of fruit, the strained juice of a lemon, and the rind, finely grated; then boil the whole till it becomes a tolerably stiff jelly; strain it again through a bag or a piece of coarse thin muslin, and pour it into moulds or jars. No. 633.—Barberry Jelly. Pick the fruit, and put it into a jar with sufficient water to cover it, set the jar in a pan of cold water on the fire, and let it remain until the barberries are broken, then strain the juice through a jelly-bag; allow three quarters of a pound of pounded loaf sugar to each pint of juice, and boil it about twenty minutes, or until it will set; then pour it into small moulds. No. 634.—Blackberry Jelly. Pick the blackberries, which should be quite ripe, and put them in a jar with the rind of a lemon, pared thin; cover closely, and set them in a pan of water over the fire, till reduced to a pulp ; then strain, and to one pint of juice, allow one pound of loaf sugar, and the juice of a lemon, strained; boil to a jelly, and pour it into small pots, or shallow jai-s. No. 635.—Black-Currant Jelly. To every two pounds of black currants, when picked, allow one pound of white currants, and half a pint of water ; set them over the fire to scald, but not to boQ ; then bruise them well ■with a wooden masher ; take them off the fire, and immediately press them through a hair sieve ; to each pint of juice, allow a pound of bruised or powdered loaf sugar, and boil it ten minutes, taking off the scum. The cun’ants should be gathered dry, and quite ripe.

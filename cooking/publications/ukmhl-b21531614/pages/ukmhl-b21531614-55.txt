VEGETARIAN TRACTICE. 47 THE FIRST STYLE. Although this is the most simple style, and excludes all the productions of the animal kingdom, it comprehends a great variety of food; and it having been shovm by the facts of chemistry that the nutritive principle is identical in vegetable and animal substances (“ Introduction,” p. 10), this style wdll be found consistent with the teachings of chemistry, as it is also with those of the most eminent expounders of physiology. For scientific information on this subject we refer to Smith’s “ Fruits and Farinacea the proper Food of Man.” We proceed to point out the particular receipts adapted for this style :— Soups.—Nos. 19, 20, 21, 22, 27, 33, and 36.

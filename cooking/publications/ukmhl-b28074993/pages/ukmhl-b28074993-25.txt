Taylor, of Ohio, and author of “The Children c the White House.’’) ^|®^OTHING perhaps is of more help to a house Slpffe keeper than to be able to concoct at short notice a good soup. A meager lunch, or a light dinner is often turned into an attractive meal by the addition of a soup. Below is given one of the most simple of quickly-made soups: Place one tablespoonful of butter in a stewpan till it boils but does not brown. Add two tablespoonftils of flour; when all is thoroughly mixed add one tea- spoonful of salt, one teaspoonful of celery salt, one saltspoonful of white pepper. Boil one quart of milk, and add the hot thickening. Eemove the bone and skin from one small can of salmon; mince or chip it; add the flsh to the milk, which, when once boiled, serve immediately.

STATESifENâ€™S DISHES; 42 ROAST BEEF. BY MBS W. D. BYNUM. (Wife of Representalive from Indiana.) E best pieces for roasting are the tenderloin, eighth ribs are best. If you get a rib-piece, have the butcher take out the bone, and roll and skewer the meat in shape. If there is much fat on the surface, cover the roast with a paste of flour and water. This should be removed half an hour before the meat is done. Have the oven rather hot, if you like beef rare, and allow twelve minutes to the pound. If preferred well done, have the oven moderate and cook a longer time. Serve with gravy.

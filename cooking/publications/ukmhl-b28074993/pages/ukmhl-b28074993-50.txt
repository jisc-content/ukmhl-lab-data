STATESMEN'S DISHES; 40 STUFFED HAM. BT MRS. T. C. OATCniNOB. (Wife of RepresentAtive from Mississippi.) *ELECT a very fine quality of ham, a newly- cured ham if possible. Boil it slowly until it d is so well done that the bone can be removed. (It can be taken out or not, as you please.) For the dressing take one pint toasted bread or crackers, two tablespoons of celery seed, one-half tablespoon of black pepper, one-half tablespoon of spice, one-half tablespoon of cloves, one tablespoon of mustard, three tablespoons of sugar, six yolks of eggs, some good pickle and two or three onions chopped fine, a little vinegar; mix all well. Make incisions to the bone all over the ham and press the dressing into the in- cisions, forcing it through the lean part of the ham; then spread the remainder of the dressing over the top of the ham and glaze with white of egg. Bake slowly for about an hour. â€¢

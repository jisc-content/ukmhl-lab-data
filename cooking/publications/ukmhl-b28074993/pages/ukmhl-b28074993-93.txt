89 AND UOW TO COOK TEEM. BONED CHICKEN. BT MIS3 JULIA DABLINO STBOKO. (Daughter ot ex-Assooiate Justice Strong, of the Supreme Court.) up a chicken into quite small pieces; skin it and pour over three pints of cold water. Boil it until the bones slip out of the meat easily; then take out all the meat; throw back the bones to boil in the liquor longer. Chop the meat with the rind of one lemon, having squeezed the juice into the boiling liquor. Put the meat, well-seasoned, into a jelly-mold, and when the liquor is boiled down fully one-half, strain it over the meat in the mold. Next morning turn out and servo with salad.

79 AND HOW TO COOK THEM. CURRIED MUTTON CHOPS. BT ME8. JOS. E. WASHINGTOK. (Wife of Representative from Tennessee.) ST the best rib chops, and have them cut about an inch thick. Put them in melted butter several hours before cooking. Half an hour before they are to be eaten slip the pan in which they are with the butter into the stove and melt the butter a second time. Then dip them into the following preparation: A loaf of stale bread rolled and sifted until it is like meal, the yellows of six hard-boiled eggs, three teaspoonfuls chopped parsley, two tea- spoonfuls of grated onion, one teaspoonful of thyme, one teaspoonful of sweet marjoram, salt, pepper (black and red), etc., and two tablespoonfuls of curry powder. Mix this thoroughly together. When the chops have been rolled in this put them in a deep pan and add the melted butter and Port or Madeira wine enough to keep them from burning. Cook twenty minutes, basting frequently; cut heart-shaped papers, butter them well and wrap a chop in each, folding the edges carefully. Slip in the stove for two minutes, and serve very hot. 6

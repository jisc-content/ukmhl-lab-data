6 PREFACE. has ever before been offered the public. All the ladies Tvho have kindly contributed are noted in Washington circles, and far beyond those confines, as hostesses and housekeepers. They are universally recognized as leaders, and the excellence of their en- tertainments hjis done very much toward building up the reputation of the Capital for refined hospitality. The recipes given are for dishes which have re- ceived the enthusiastic commendation of the most critical dinera-out. Most of them are specialties upon which the ladies pride themselves, and not a few ai e the inventions—the “creations” a French chef de cuisine would say—of the fair conti ibutors. We are tempted to expatiate at length upon many of these—to relate of some that they are cherished heirlooms, which have been in the families for gener- ations, and handed down from mother to daughter; of others that they were conceived and elaborated years ago by young wives, anxious to excel in attract- ive tables, and retained by them because they accom- plished their design. But to give these their proper history would make this book many times its present size; so we must refrain. Trial will demonstrate more fully than any words can state the unusual value of these recipes. Washington, D. C., May, 1890.

AND HOW TO COOK THEM. 198 DROP CAKE. BY KBS. ALONZO ITUTK. (Wife of Representative from New Hampshire.) SHEEE eggs, two teacups of sugar, one coflee- cup of rich sour cream, (if not possible to get it rich, put two tablespoons of butter to it,) one-fourth a teaspoon of soda, one-half a teaspoon of salt, one-half a medium-sized nutmeg. Stir in slowly sufficient flour to make a thick batter, but not stiffâ€”about the consistency of pound cake. Bake in muffin-pans, heated and well-buttered, dropping a tablespoonful of the batter in each ring. Baked in a oven that is well-heated at first, and grows cooler as they bake. One-third of a teacup of currants mixed in is an improvement.

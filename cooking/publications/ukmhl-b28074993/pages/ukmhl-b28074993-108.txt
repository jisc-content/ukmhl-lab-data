STATESMEN'S DISHES; 104 GREEN VEGETABLES. BY MR8. S. A. OBAIQ. (Wife of Representative from Penneylvauio.) greeu vegetables must be washed thor- WAmi oughly in cold water, and then be dropped into water which h:is been solted and is just beginning to boil. There should be a tablespoonful of salt for every two quarts of water. If the wa.ter boils a long time before the vegetables are put in, it has lost all its gases, and the mineral ingredients are deposited on the bottom and sides of the kettle, so that the water is flat and tasteless, the vegetables will not look green and have a flne flavor. The time of boiling green vegetables depends very much on the age and how long they have been gathered. The younger and more freshly they are gathered, the more quickly they are cooked.

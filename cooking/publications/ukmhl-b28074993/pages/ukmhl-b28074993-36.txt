32 STATESMEN'S DISHES; CODFISH FAKE. BY OOL. OH.BEBT K. PIKBCE. (Senator from North Dakota.) SkS^AKE some codfish—old salt fish, the saltiest you can buy, and take all you can get. Then g boil it well, just as long as you want to; boil all the salt out of it,' or as much as you can get out. Of course you boil this in water. The gravy is the most important part. You boil some plain water and put in butter—^lots of butter—and flour; but be care- ful about flour, not to get too much. The gravy wants to be of a consistency between Washington milk and real cream. Have a big pot of boiled potatoes, boiled with their jackets on. For one person take four of these big mealy potatoes, take jackets off and mash very flne all over a big dinner-plate. Spread this area of potato with the fine codfish, leaving no part uncovered. Next, pour gravy over the entire surface of fish. Pour copiously, after which black pepper must be used, very black pepper, which lights up the gravy and gives expression to the entire dish. The codfish is now ready for eating, and if made with strict regard to recipe will not fail of a result.

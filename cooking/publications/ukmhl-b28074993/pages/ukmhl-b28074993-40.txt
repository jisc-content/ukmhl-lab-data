STATESMEN'S DISHES; 36 BAKED CHICKEN. BY MRS. THOMAS B. KEED. (Wife of the Speaker of the House of Representatives.) ^^^ELECT a tender fowl, if possibleâ€”to have it fresh is imperative; dress it carefully; fill with any desired dressing; thrust the legs through the hole made in drawing it at the back; pinion the wings close to the sides; dredge with salt and a little pepper, and place in a dripping-pan with about one-half teacup of water. Put it in a moderate oven and do not disturb it for fifteen or twenty minutes. Then begin to baste it, repeating the pro- cess frequently till testing with a fork shows that it is done. If it browns too rapidly, turn another pan over it at the last. Serve with gravy. If the chicken is tough, parboil slowly till partly done, and put to bake with the broth.

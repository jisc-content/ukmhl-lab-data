189 AND HOW TO COOK THEM. SNOW CAKE. BY MBS. M. H. Mâ€™CORD. (Wife of Reproseiilatiye from Wisconsin.) IITES of eight eggs, two cups of white sugax, one cup of butter, well washed; one cup of sweet milk, one teaspoon of soda and two of cream tartar sifted into two cups of flour, and one of corn starch. Beat the butter to a cream, then beat in the flour; beat the whites of eggs to a stiff froth, and beat the sugar into that; into this stir the milk, then add the two mixtures together. This can be baked in a loaf, but is better baked in layers, between which is spread a layer of boiled frosting, with almonds pounded to a paste, mixed into it; or with a spread of whipped cream between the layers.

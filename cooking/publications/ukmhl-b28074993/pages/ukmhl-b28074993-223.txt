Our dinners are made attractive, the same as when we kept house, and entertained on a larger scale. To illustrate, I will give a description of a pink dinner. The table was set as usual when company is invited, only that pink was the prevailing color. First a scarf of pink satin, under lace, was laid across the middle of the ta,ble, and on this was placed the central ornaments. In the very center was a pot of ferns, with broad pink satin ribbon twined in and out of the open-work edge, and some la France roses arranged among the green. At each end of the central scarf were baskets of pink bonbons. The menu cards were tied with knots of the pink satin ribbon, with the name of the hostess on one end and date of the dinner on the other, painted in gold letters. The cards of the guests were pink flower petals; the gentlemen’s a long lily leaf, and the ladies’ a rose leaf.

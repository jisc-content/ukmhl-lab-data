Ill IND HOW TO COOK THEM. CRAB SALAD. BY MRS. J. B. Mâ€™KKE. (Dnug)iter of the President.) ^OIL one dozen crabs thirty minutes, adding a little salt to the water. When cold pick out the meat. Make a mayonnaise dressing as follows: Beat the yolks of two eggs, add pepper, salt and mustard and mix well together. Then slowly add half a pint of olive oil, or enough to thicken the dressing. If too thick, add a few drops of lemon juice or vinegar. Great care should be exercised in pouring the oil, as it will curdle if poured too fast. Now mix the crab meat and the mayonnaise together. Garnish a dish with crisp lettuce leaves or water- cresses, place the crabs in the center, and serve.

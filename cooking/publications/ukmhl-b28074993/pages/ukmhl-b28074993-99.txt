AND HOW TO COOK THEM. 9S CAULIFLOWER. BY MRS. W. O. ABNOLD. (Wife of Represeutivlive from Rhode leland,) IT a cauliflower in a disk of cold salted water, with the flower down, and let it soak for two hours. Tie in a cloth and put into boiling water with a little salt, and boil until a fork will pen- etiâ€™jvtc the stem easily. If the cauliflower is fresh, it will boil in twenty minutes. When boiled, take it up carefully and put into a dish with the flower up. Have ready a sauce made of one-half pint of milk, a small pinch of salt, and one-half tablespoonful of butter. Let this come to a boil. Take a table- spoonful of flour mixed with a little cold milk, and stir into the boiling milk, and let it boil up once. .Pour a little over the cauliflower when ready to serve, and serve the remainder in a gravy-boat. A table- spoonful of Worcestershire sauce may be added to the sauce if liked. 0

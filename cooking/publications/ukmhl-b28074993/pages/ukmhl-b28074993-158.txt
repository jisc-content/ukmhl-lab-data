184 STATESMENâ€™S DISHES; CHARLOTTE RUSSE. BY USB. ALONZO NUTK. (Wife of Representative from New Hampshire.) a sponge cake in the proportion of eggs and two-thirds of a cup of sugar, it in a brick-shaped cakepan about four inches deep. Take one and a half pints of new cream; set it on ice till perfectly ice-cold; put one- fourth box of gelatine (more if the weather is warm) to soak in one-half cup ot cold milk; whip the cream to a solid froth; fill up the cup of melted gelatine with boiling milk; let it get cold; put to the cream two cups of sugar, a tablespoonful of vanilla and a pinch of salt. Stir together the whipped cream, the gelatine and sugar, stirring constantly from the bottom, so that it will combine thoroughly without clotting before it is set. When the cake is done turn out on a sieve to cool. When cold place it bottom up in a clean pan the same size and shape of the first. Slice it cross- ways, taking out every alternate slice, without leaving a single crumb; then fill the spaces thus left with the mixture, filling in with a spoon carefully, a little in the bottom of each, holding the slices straight, till there is enough to keep them from tilting sideways. Fill up to the top and set on ice about six hours if the weather is hot. Serve in slices. Another pan may be filled with the odd slices.

43 AND HOW TO COOK THEM. ROAST VEAL. BY MB8. ALFRED C. UARMEB. (Wife of Repreaeiitulivu from Pennxylvnnia.) a leg of veal and remove the bone, making several incisions in the thick part beside. Make a stuffing of crackers, eggs, chopped fat pork, sage, pepper and salt, enough to fill the holes. Bind and skewer carefully together. Theu take very thick and fat pickled pork, cut it into slices as thin as you can with a very sharp knife, and cover the veal entirely over with it, binding it se- curely with strips of muslin (cords would cut the meat as it cooked); put it in a deep dish and set it in a steamer; let it steam three hours. Kemove it, and put it in the oven in a dripping-pan with the gravy in the dish, and bake it an hour and a half or two hours moreâ€”according to size, basting it constantly. Peel off the fat and serve hot.

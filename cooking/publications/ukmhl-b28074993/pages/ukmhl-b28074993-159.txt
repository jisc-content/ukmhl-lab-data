106 AND HOW TO COOK THEM. A PUDDING SAUCE. BY MBS. JOHN B. HENDERBON. (WUb of ex-Senator from Missouri 5EING a pint of milk to the boiling-point, and then stir in a generous teaspoonful of corn starch, previously rubbed smooth with a little of the cold milk; add also a tablespoonful of sugar. Let it cook for two or three minutes to thoroughly cook the starch, and then let the mixture get entirely cold. Flavor it with sherry or any of the flavorings, and just before serving stir in smoothly the whites of two eggs beaten to a stiff froth. As the egg froth is not cooked, the sauce will not keep very long at its best, perhaps half an hour.

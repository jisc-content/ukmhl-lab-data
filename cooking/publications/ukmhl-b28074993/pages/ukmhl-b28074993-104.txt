STATESMEN'S DISHES; loo ASPARAGUS. BY MRS. BENJAMIN F. SHIVELY. (Wife of Kepresentaiive from Indiana.) ELECT green asparagus; it is always sweeter and more tender than the white variety. After breaking off the hard part, take a sharp knife and strip off the outside skin, beginning at the cut end and drawing it upward as far as it will peel off. Put the stalks into a saucepan, sprinkle over them a little salt, and cover them with boiling water.. Cook till tender, about twenty minutes. Season with cream, and thicken with a little flour rubbed into an equal quantity of butter. Serve hot.

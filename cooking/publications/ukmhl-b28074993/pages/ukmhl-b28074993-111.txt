107 AND HOW TO COOK THEM. LOBSTER SALAD. BY MBS. JOHN WANAMAKKR. (Wife of the Posliimaler-General.) gPLIT two good-sized, fine, freshly-boiled lob- sters. Pick all the meat from out the shells, then cut it into one-inch lengths, equal pieces. Place it in a saucepan on the hot range, with one ounce of very good fresh butter. Season with one pinch of salt and half a saltspoonful of red pepper, adding two medium-sized sound truffles cut into small disk-shaped pieces. Cook for five minutes, then add a wineglassful of good Madeira wine. Eeduce to one-half, which will take three minutes. Have three egg yolks in a bowl with half a pint of sweet cream; beat well together and add to it the lobster. Gently shuffle for two minutes longer, or until it thickens weU. Pour it into a hot tureen and serve hot.

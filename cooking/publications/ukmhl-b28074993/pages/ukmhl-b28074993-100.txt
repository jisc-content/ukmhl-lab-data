STATESMEN'S DISHES; 96 SPINACH. BY MBS. JOHN M. FAEQUHAB. (Wife of Eepresentatlve from New York.) â– ASH the spinach in several waters, and keep in cold water until time to cook it. Then put it into boiling water enough to cover it, and add a little salt. Cover the pan and boil briskly till tender; it will sink when done. Take it from the water immediately, season it with butter, and cover with hard-boiled eggs in slices.

160 STATESMEN'S DISHES; CIDER JELLY BT MRS. D. J. BREWER. (Wife of Associate Justice of Supreme Court.) »AKE one package of Cox’s gelatine; dissolve it in one pint of cold water. When it is thoroughly dissolved add one pint of cider and one quart of boiling water, (the cider must be sweet, and the very best;) to this add, also, two pounds of best granulated sugar, a pinch of ground cinnamon, the juice of two lemons, and the grated peel of one. Let it come to the boiling-point, strain and turn into molds. It must be kept in a cool place of course. This is not only an excellent dish in a general way, being as good as wine jelly and clear as amber, but it is unequaled in sickness where stimulants are prohibited. In warm weather it takes a little more gelatine to the same amount of fluid, than in cold weather.

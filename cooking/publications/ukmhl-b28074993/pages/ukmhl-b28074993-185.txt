181 AND HOW TO COOK THEM. STRAWBERRY SHORTCAKE. BY KBS. JOHB K. FABC^TTHAB. (Wife of Eopresontative from Now York.) fNE quart of flour, three heaping teaspoons of baking powder; sift together thoroughly and rub in one ounce of butter; mix with a pint of sweet milk, using a spoon. The mixture will be softer than common piecrust. Do not try to mold or roll out the dough, but spread it on tins by patting with the hand till it is about an inch in thickness. Bake slowly till the cakes have had time to rise, then increase the heat. Split the cakes hot from the oven, spread the halves liberally with good butter, and cover them with fruit previously sweetened; place one on the other, the upper half reversed of course. Serve at once. When strawberries are gone, red raspberries or white currants are good in their place, and also peaches of a fine flavor. All these fruits should be sweetened an hour or two beforehand.

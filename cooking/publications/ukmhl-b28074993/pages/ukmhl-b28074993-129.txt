12B AND HOW TO COOK THEM. MILK PUNCH. BT HKS. BOSWELL P. FLOWEK. (Wife of Representative from New York.) ?EEP the thinly-pared rinds of eighteen lem- ons in one quart of proof whisky or rum (better) for three days in a closely-covered vegetable-dish. Then add five quarts of whisky, three quarts of boiling water, and pour it on the sugar and dissolve it; lemon juice (which has been squeezed and bottled when the lemons were peeled), white sugar three and a half pounds, grated nutmegs two; mix all in a large crock, and then pour in boil- ing milk two quarts. Let it stand till cool, stirring it well, tlien strain through a flannel bag as for jelly, the curds on no account to be removed until the liquor has been strained quite clear. Eeturn the first quart to the bag, as it may not be quite clear, when strain through a flannel with filtering-paper. Bottle and cork well. It improves by age, and if properly pre- pared will keep all Winter.

148 STATESMEN’S DISHES; CARDINAL RICHELIEU PUDDING. BT MBS. CHA8. H. GIBSON. (Wife of Bepresontstivo from Mnryland.) SurS^AKE eight eggs; beat whites and yolks sepa- rately; first balance the eight eggs with pul- verized sugar and four eggs in flour, after it has been sifted twice; beat sugar and yolks together, then add the whites and the juice and rind of a large lemon; the rind must be grated fine. Last of all add flour, which must be cut in with a knife. Don’t stir at all after adding flour. Grease a pretty mold (a Turk’s head is the best) and pour the batter in. Bake quickly. Then make three pints of rich custard, the yolks of five eggs to a pint; sweeten and season with vanilla. When the cake is perfectly cold—it should always be made a day or so beforehand—cut it carefully across twice, and spread currant or pine apple jelly, or the preserved grated pine apple, be- tween the layers of cake; put it together carefully so it will not be seen it has been cut; then have onc-half pound of almonds blanched and stick them thick all over the cake with small, thin pieces of citron, and then pour one-pint of good sherry wine over the cake; let it stand all night; keep the custard on the ice, and just before dinner put the cake in a handsome dish and pour the custard all over it. This is a dish fit for the gods.

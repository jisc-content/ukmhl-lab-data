STATESMEN'S DISHES; 60 SALT-RISING BREAD, BT KBS. T. B. 8TOCKOA.LB. (Wife of Represeutatlve from Missiasippl.) gAKE a quart of milk and water, equal por- tions. Stir in flour to make a stiff batter, that will not run from the spoon, but drops like drop-cake batter. Add a teaspoonful of salt; put it in a warm place; let it stand three or four hours, and then, if water rises on the top, stir in a little more flour. After it rises make up your dough just as you would ordinary bread, using the rising instead of yeast, adding about a gill of milk or water and a little more salt, and lard about the size of an egg; knead it well and put it into well-greased pans and let it rise. Be careful not to jar it while rising. Bake the same as yeast bread.

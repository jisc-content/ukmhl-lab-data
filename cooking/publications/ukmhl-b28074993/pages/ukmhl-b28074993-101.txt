97 AND HOW TO COOK THEM. LIMA BEANS. BT MRS. MOSES D. STIVKBS. fWife of RepresentatiVO from New York.) beans should be fresh and tender, but if they are not a pinch of soda in the fii*st water will take away much of the strong taste. Parboil in water till they are half done, then turn off the water and renew from the teakettle, with just enough to finish cooking them. When they are thor- oughly cooked season with butter first, letting it brown slightly, with a pinch of salt (unless the butter is quite salt), and a little sugar. After this has cooked into them thoroughly, pour in enough cream to make a little gravy; let it boil up once, and serve.

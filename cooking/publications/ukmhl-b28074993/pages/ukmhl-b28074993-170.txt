100 STATESMEN’S DISHES; OLD-FASHIONED SPONGE CAKE. BY UBS. M. B. WAITB. (Widow of Chief .Tustioe of the United States.) Weigh the sugar and put it iu the mixing-bo vd; break the eggs, putting the yolks with the sugar and the whites in another dish. Beat the whites of the eggs until they will not drop from the rods; beat the yolks and sugar to a cream and until the sxigar dissolves; strain the lemon juice and add it with the grated; put to the eggs and sugar. When the yolks and sugar are very light add the whites, beating all very hard until well mixed; sift the flour two or three times with the salt in it. If “New Process flour,” take out one table- spoonful of it, as it takes less than the other kind. Add the flour a little at a time, stirring it in lightly. If the flour is beaten in, the cake will be tough. Put the mixture about one and a half inches thick into flat pans; sift fine sugar thinly over the top, and bake in an oven that is hottest at the bottom; try with a straw in about a half hour. If done it will not stick to the straw. Do not be alarmed if it falls a little when taken from the oven, but do not jar it or turn, it out until it is partially cool.

AND HOW TO COOK THEM. 68 0 FRIED CAKES. BT MRS. GEO. B. BRICENER. (Wife of Represenlative from Wisconsin.) ^EA-SUEE one cup each of milk and giâ€™anu- lated sugar into a mixing-bowl; stir till dissolved; beat three eggs well and stir in; take two quarts of flour and three heaping teaspoons of baking powder, sifted together; mix the whole into a soft dongli, using as little flour in manipulating it as possible. Cut into rings and fry in very hot lard. Mixing the sugar and milk together first keeps the dough from soaking grease, and avoiding the use of a great deal of flour in working with the dough makes the cakes puffy and delicate.

lOB AND HOW TO COOK TEEM. STEWED CORN. BY iU8S PH(SBE W. OODZINS, LluB. (Ez-Unlted States Marshal, Eastern District of Missouri.) SPLIT the kernels of corn before removing from the cob, and in cutting off cut them several times through, leaving a large part on the cob to be scraped off, so as to make a fine mass of the whole. Take a pint of milk or cream, bring it to a boil, and put the corn in and boil slowly in a closed porcelain kettle for fifteen or twenty minutes, with a very little salt and sugar. It is better still when steamed.

AND HOW TO COOK THEM. 189 PLUM PUDDING. BT MBS. JOS. B. H’BONALO. (Wife of ex-Senator from Tndi.aiia.) [IS pudding is best when prepared, all but milk and eggs, the day before using. Seed and cut in half one pound of the best bloom raisins; pick, wash and dry before the fire one pound of Zante currants, commonly called plums; dredge the fruit well with flour, to prevent its sinking or clog- ging ; take one pound of fresh beef suet, freed firom the skin and string, and chop very fine; one pint of grated bread crumb® and a half pint of sifted flour; a large quarter of a pound of best sugar, a large table- spoonful of powdered mace and cinnamon mixed, and two powdered nutmegs; all the spice to be steeped in a half pint of mixed wine and brandy; put away these ingredients separately, closely covered, and let them stand all night. Next morning finish the pud- ding, which requires at least six hours’ boiling. Beat wine and eggs together until very thick and smooth; then add one pint of rich milk, then the bread crumbs and flour; mix with the sugar the grated yellow rind and juice of two lemons, and add to the mixture gradually all the prepared ingredients, stir- ring hard. If too thick add more milk; if too thin add more bread crumbs; take care not to have too much bread or flour, or the pudding will be heavy; add two teaspoonfuls of baking powder, one quarter of a pound of citron; boil in tin molds; serve with lemon sauce, or with butter and sugar beaten to a cream and flavored with nutmeg and rose.

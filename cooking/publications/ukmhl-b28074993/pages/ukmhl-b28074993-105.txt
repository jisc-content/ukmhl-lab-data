AND HOW TO COOK THEM. lOl GREEN PEAS. BT MRS. J. B. WII-LIAMS. (Wife of Representative from Illinois.) ASH before shelling, not after. When the peas are all shelled, take the tender pods and boil them ten or fifteen minutes in water enough to cover them; then skim out the pods and pour in the peas; boil them slowly about twenty minutes, then season with sweet cream and a little salt. Take care that there is not too much water; there should be about half a teacupful around them when they are thoroughly cooked, which must be seasoned and dished with the peas. When the peas are a trifle old, or not a very sweet variety, a spoon- ful of sugar will improve them.

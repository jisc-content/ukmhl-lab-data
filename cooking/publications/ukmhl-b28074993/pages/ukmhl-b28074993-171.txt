167 AND HOW TO COOK THEM. GERMAN ALMOND RINGS. BT MRS. WM. WINDOM. (Wife of Secretary of the Treasury.) jNE-HALF pound blanched almonds, one-half pound pulverized sugar, one-half pound puff- paste, whites of six eggs. Roll the paste very thin and cut out with a tumbler or tin biscuit-cutter. From each cut a smaller one from the center so that the ring will be three-fourths of an inch wide. Beat the whites to a stiff froth; then add the sugar and stir with the dish in boiling water until the me- ringue is quite thick. Into this stir the almonds, which have been previously sliced very thin. Cool. Then with a small silver knife place this mixture on the rings. Bake in an oven at the temperature proper for cake. Can be kept for two or three weeks.

46 AifD HOW TO COOK THEM. ROAST TURKEY. BY Mas. GBO. yt, SMITH. (Wife of Representative from Illinois.) Sj^ylEST stew the fowl slowly for half an hour; then fill with any desired dressing. Secure the legs; run a skewer through the wings, fastening them to the body; skewer the neck fast to the body underneath, and tie all securely with twine. Place it in a covered roasting-pan that will retain all the steam, and therefore all the flavor; pour the liquor over it and baste it once in a while, but not so frequently as if in an open pan. By the time the turkey is nicely browned it will be done through, as the covered pan prevents it from coloring prema- turely. Serve with giblet gravy and cranberry sauce. GIBLET GRAVY. Boil the giblets for two hours; then take them out, chop the gizzard and heart, braid the liver, and put them back again. Thicken with one tablespoon- ful of flour wet with cold water, season with salt and pepper. Let this simmer one hour longer, and when you dish the turkey turn the drippings into the gravy, boil up once, and send to the table. Make all the gravy for poultry this way, omitting the chopped gizzard in chicken gravy.

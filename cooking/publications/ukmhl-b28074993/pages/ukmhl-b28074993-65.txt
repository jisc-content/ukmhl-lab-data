I AND HOW TO COOK THEM. 61 JOHNNY CAKES. BT KBS. W. O. ABNOU>. (Wife of Bepreeentatlve from Bhode Island.) fNE cup of Indian meal, a pinch of salt, butter the size of a walnut; pour over this enough boiling water to make a stiff batter, after being well stirred. Set for three or four minutes in a dish of boiling water; then thin with sweet milk until the batter drops easily from the spoon. Put on a hot, buttered griddle in spoonfuls, and when brown, turn them over and brown the other side. This will make six good-sized cakes. Water may be used in place of the milk, but the cakes will not brown so nicely in that case.

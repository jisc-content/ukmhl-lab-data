141 AND HOW TO COOK THEM. SNOW PUDDING. BT MBS. JAB. I.. PUGH. (Wife of Senator from Alabama.) ^^WOVEE one-half box of gelatine with cold water and let soak a half hour. Pour over it one pint of boiling water; add two cups of sugar, and stir until dissolved; add the juice of three lemons and strain the whole into a tin basin. Place this in a pan of ice-water and let it stand until cold. Then beat with an egg-beater until white as snow. Beat the whites of four eggs to a stiff froth, and stir them into the pudding. Turn the pudding into a mold that has been dipt into cold water, and set it away to harden. Make a sauce with the yolks of the eggs, one quart of milk, and a half-cup of sugar. Scald the milk; beat yolks and sugar together, until light, add them to the milk and cook two minutes. Take from the fire, add one teaspoonful vanilla, and turn out to cool.

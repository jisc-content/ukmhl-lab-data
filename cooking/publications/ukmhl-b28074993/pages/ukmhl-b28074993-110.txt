AKE the meat, free from skin and fat, of two large boiled chickens, cut in dice; with this mix thoroughly an equal quantity of good white crisp celery, cut in small pieces; three olives, chopped; two teaspoonfuls of capers; make a dressing of six spoonfuls of best imported olive oil, two tablespoonfuls of vinegar, two teaspoonfuls of salt, and a dash of red pepper; pour over the salad, and let it stand for several hours in the ice-box. Pre- pare a mayonnaise in the following manner: Break two eggs very carefully, and put the yolks into a soup-plate; then add, drop by drop, a pint bottle of best olive oil, stirring steadily one way with a silver fork.

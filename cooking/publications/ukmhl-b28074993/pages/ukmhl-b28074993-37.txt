ds AND SOW TO COOK TEEM. TERRAPIN. BT BOK. THOMAS P. BATABD. (Late Secretary of State.) lKE two “counts” and boil in the shell; after allowing them to cool, remove the shell, take out the gall-bladder, and cut the ter- rapin in good-sized pieces; put in a chafing-dish, and to this add small cupful of rich cream, half a pound of butter, and a couple wineglassfuls of sherry or madeira. Most epicures prefer madeira because of its richer flavor. No one has ever tasted terrapin prepared after this recipe who is not a convert to its excellence.

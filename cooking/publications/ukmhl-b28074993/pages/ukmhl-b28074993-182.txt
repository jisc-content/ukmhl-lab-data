178 STATESMEN'S DISHES; WHAT-IS-LEFT-OVER CAKE, MBS. JOHN H. OEAB. (Wife of Representatiye from Iowa.) IN making the cakes above, there may be small portions of the batter from each left. In such a case I have used it as follows, making a new cake, for which the above title is as good as any. Bake in layers and put together as follows: First a layer of fruit cake, then a layer of silver cake, an- other layer of fruit cake, then a layer of gold cake, a third layer of fruit cake, and last of all a layer of the snow cake. Spread jeUy between; quince pre- ferred. Cover with icing.

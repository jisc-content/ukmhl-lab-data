STATESMEN'S DISHES; 34 FISH CHOWDER. BT CAPT. O. E. THORNTON. (Pfty Director, D. 3. Navy.) ^AKE one-lialf pound fat salt pork, cut into slices and fry out well. Slice four lai'ge onions and fry in the pork-fat until they are a light brown. Stir constantly to prevent burning, and thus making the chowder bitter. Put this into a pot with three quarts of boiling water, and let it boil twenty minutes. Skim out the pieces of pork and onion and add ten potatoes, sliced, not too thin, and boil twenty minutes; then add two pounds of solid fish-shred and boil ten minutes, if the fish is not cooked; add salt and pepper to taste. When cooked stir in slowly a thickening made of two table.spoon- fuls of farina mixed in cold milk, and let it boil up once only. Put the pot back on the fire, and, after letting it stand a few moments, skim off the scum which will rise to the top, and serve. Eecipe suffi- cient for eight persons.

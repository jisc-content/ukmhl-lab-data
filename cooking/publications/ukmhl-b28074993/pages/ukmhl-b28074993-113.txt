109 AND HOW TO COOK THEM. POTATO SALAD. BY MRS. S. A. CRAIG. (Wife of Representative from Pennsylvania.) SAKE ten medium-sized cold potatoes and one small onion, chopped fine—the onion very- fine; half dozen hard-boiled eggs, the white chopped fine; mash the yolks and add to them one teaspoon each of ground mustard and sugar, one tablespoon of melted butter, some salt and pepper. Eub all together well and put into the potatoes, with about four tablespoonfuls of Durkee’s salad dressing and half a cup of vinegar. Then chop up stalks of celery to about the same quantity of the chopped potatoes and mix in. Slice a few more boiled eggs and lay on top, and garnish the edge of the dish with the celery-tops.

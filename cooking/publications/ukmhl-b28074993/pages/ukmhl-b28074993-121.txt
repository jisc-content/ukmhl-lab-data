AND HOW TO COOK TEEM. 117 PICOLLI BT MBS. HBNBY VT. BLAIB. (Wife of Senator from New Hampshire.) NE-HALF bushel tomatoes, one quart onions, three small peppers, three pounds sugar, one ounce mustard seed, two tablespoons each of cinnamon, cloves and allspice. Slice the tomatoes the night before, and put a layer of tomato an inch thick, then a good handful of fine salt, and continue until the whole are sliced. In the morning squeeze the fruit out and add the onions, cover with vinegar, and let it come to boil. Then drain off the vinegar, add a gallon of fresh vinegar and the rest of the ingredients. The pickle is much nicer if the spices are tied in thin muslin bags, and it is more delicate if the cinnamon is twice the amount of the cloves and allspice. Cook till tender.

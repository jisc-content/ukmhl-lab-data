AND HOW TO COOK THEM. 47 ROAST DUOK. BY MRS. JOUN J. INGALLS. (Wife of the Prenldent pro tern, of the Senale.) sOAST two wild ducks. When cold carve nicely, rejecting the wings. Put into a stew- pan one pint of water, one pint of tomatoes, strained; one tablespoonful of onion juice, salt and pepper to taste. As soon as this boils up throw in the sliced duck and boil 15 minutes. At the last moment thicken with a little cornstarch and throAV in two dozen olives. When all is well heated through serve at once. This is delicious when well prepared.

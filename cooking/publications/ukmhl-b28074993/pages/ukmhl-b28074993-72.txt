STATESMENâ€™S DISHES; 68 CREAM TOAST, BY MISS U 8. SWAN. (Slster-in-law of Senator Morrill, of Vermont.) SLWAYS bake one loaf to be used especially for toasting; have it shapely, and bake it so thoroughly that it will be neither soggy nor full of holes. Stale or dried bread should never be used. Cut into slices of medium thickness, brown the bread until it matches the crust in color, butter and cover with a hot cream dressing, which has just been allowed to come to a boil. Toast made with care is the daintiest breakfast dish conc,eivable.

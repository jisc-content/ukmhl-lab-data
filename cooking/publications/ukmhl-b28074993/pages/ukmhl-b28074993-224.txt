220 BTATMMElirB DIBHEB; A GOOD BAKING POWDER. BY MR8. MARY A. DENISON. (Author of **That Husband of Mine.'*) ^ETTER than all the yeast powders is this one, which has been in use for twenty-five years, in a family that knows what good things are: One-half pound tartaric acid, one-half pound best baking soda, one quart of flour. Sift thoroughly six or seven times through a fine sieve. This is stronger than ordinary baking powder.

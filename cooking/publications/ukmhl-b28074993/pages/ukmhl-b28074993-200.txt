BTATESMEN'a DISHES; 190 SAUCISSONS DE CHOCOLAT. BT BOBS. BESSIE SNIDEB. (Daughter of Representative from Minnesota.) ■AKE two cakes of “ German’s sweet choco- late,” put in a pan, and the pan in another larger one of hot water; leave on the stove until thoroughly melted, taking care that nothing whatever is put in the chocolate; then keeping it in the pan of hot water, take to the table and pour in honey until the chocolate is easily molded; mix in a cupful of blanched sweet almonds cut into pieces about the size of a pea, a pinch each of powdered cloves and cinnamon. Then mold with the hands into rolls about five inches long and an inch thick; wrap in tin foil cut previously into sheets of the right size. Put in the refrigerator to cool. The little sausages will keep for months, and in fact grow better with age, to my mind. To serve them, slice into thin slices, and put in a dainty little bonbon dish.

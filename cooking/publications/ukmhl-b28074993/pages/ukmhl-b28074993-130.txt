126 STATESMENâ€™S DISHES,- APPLE TODDY. BY MRS. JOS. B. WASHINGTON. (Wife of Represeiitativo from Tennessee.) ^AKE twelve large apples till thoroughly done; put into a jar while hot and mash them well; pour on them three quarts boiling water; cover the jar and let stand till cool; then add three pints brandy, one pint Jamaica spirits, one-half pint of peach brandy, one-half pint curacoa; sweeten to your taste. Let it stand a day or so, occasionally mashing the particles of apple; then strain for use. If apples are small use sixteen or eighteen. If you wish to keep the toddy add one pint brandy and more sugar.

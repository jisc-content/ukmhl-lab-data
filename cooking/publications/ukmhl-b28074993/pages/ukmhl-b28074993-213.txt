209 AND HOW TO COOK THEM. CRYSTALLIZED FRUIT. BY MBS. CHAB. E. HOOKBB. (Wife of Kepresentative from Mlssiaslppi.) *AKE a wine jelly according to the recipe found in a box of Coxâ€™s gelatine, always using sherry wine, on account of its color. Have ready a mold of any shape, according to fancy, in which to crystallize the fruit in layers, of which use any delicious variety. The first layer could be of a banana cut in thin slices, placed at the bottom of the mold. Then pour over it some of the jelly; then of oranges, sweet and juicy, about two, with the seeds extracted, and cut in small pieces; then pour more jelly over this, and so on until you may have five or six varieties of fruit. For this recipe candied figs and limes are delicious. Mix through the fruit about two dozen English walnuts, well-minced up. As the layers of fruit are placed in the mold sprinkle a little sugar over each. When the mold is full of jelly and fruit put its top on securely, and keep it surrounded and covered with ice. When the contents of the mold are hard enough to slice, slip them out carefully and place on fancy dish, serving with whipt cream, the same as for Charlotte Eusse. 14

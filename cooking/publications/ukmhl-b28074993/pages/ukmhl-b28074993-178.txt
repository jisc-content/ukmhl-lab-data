174 STATESMEN'S DISHES; SPONGE CAKE. BY MBS. JOHN H. REAGAN. (Wife of Senator from Texas.) |AKE the whites of twenty eggs, two gobletfnls of flour, three of pulverized sugar, two tea- spoonfuls of extract of lemon essence, and one of cream of tartar. Sift the flour carefully, mix the sugar, eggs and lemon thoroughly and stir in the flour gradually, taking care not to toughen it by too much beating. The great test is in the baking. The oven should be very hot, and it should be baked but a few minutes, until it is a light brown.

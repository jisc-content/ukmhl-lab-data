84 The Bachelor and the Chafing-dish. Curries of lobsters, scallops, shrimps, and crabs are especially delicious. Veal chops, sweetbreads, and salmon may be treated the same way. Rice Compote.—This is the way I saw Mrs. Rorer make it: Into the chafing-dish went four tablespoonfuls of sugar, four of sherry (claret is equally good), and one sliced banana. To this was added four tablespoonfuls of cold boiled rice. It was kept covered while the banana cooked tender to keep the wine flavor from escaping. When the cover was raised to add one-half a pineapple, shredded in with a silver fork, the odor was de- licious, and everybody sniffed approvingly. Two minutes’ cooking finished it. Calf’s Liver and Bacon.—Slice both liver and bacon quite thin : cook well in the chafing-dish until the liver is thoroughly browned and curled. Chops or Steaks.—Dredge them with flour. Have the frying-pan perfectly clean and hot, then put in butter or clarified, fresh beef-suet, which makes excellent fat for frying ; put in the steaks (or chops), and turn them frequently to preserve the gravy. In fifteen minutes, if the fire be in proper condition, they will be cooked ; dredge them with a little salt and pepper before you take them

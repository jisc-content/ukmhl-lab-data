( Marjory Moore's Lovers. By ADELAIDE SERGEANT. Neely's Library of Choice Literature, j Paper, 50c. This is a strongly written story, with a vein of tragedy running through its length. The reader almost immediately conceives a peculiar sympathy for the little country girl whom the benevolent old Squire, with a love for music, assists to a career of fame upon the stage as a fair violinist. Marjoryâ€™s fortunes, like those of many others who court the applause of the fickle public, suffer a collapse, and the arm upon which she has expected to lean fails her; but in the end she finds a heart of gold and the story ends happily. It is really a charming romance, and will please a large share of the reading public. The well-known authoress has never given us a stronger picture of humanity in its various phases. Marjory is decidedly feminine, and naturally chooses the lover whose handsome face appeals to her girlish heart; but through better trials she learns her lesson, and when the storms have passed finds a safe harbor in the heart of the honorable lover who has lived but to serve her since girlhood.

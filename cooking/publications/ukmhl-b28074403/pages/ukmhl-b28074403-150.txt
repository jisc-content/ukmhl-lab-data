136 The Bachelor and the Chafing-dish. tions are realized in any way, pointing to books, I can hardly fancy that “ The Bachelor and the Chaf- ing-dish ” will ever be an authority. Perhaps I am trifling with my publisher and my public alike. It will surely be thought so if, perchance, some dyspeptic being should fail in any one of the recipes here given, and I may have much to answer for. But I can truthfully say that naught has been set down in malice, and if some testy fellow may upbraid me, I pray that the one to whom I have ascribed as my incentive will forgive with “his intentions are well meant! ” D.

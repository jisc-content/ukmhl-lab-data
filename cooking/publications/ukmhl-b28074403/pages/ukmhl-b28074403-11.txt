I have more than once observed in pub- lic prints, of big and little circulation, that although the art of cookery ought to be the most attractive study in domestic economy, yet women as a general rule manifest less interest in it than men. In fact, the most important piece of machinery in woman's domain is usually relegated to an engineer of faultlessly persuasive ignorance. The more she may be mentally equipped to preside over the kitchen realm the less she seems inclined to have anything to do with it. On the other hand, men ap- pear to have an instinctive fondness for meddling with everything appertaining to the art of cookery, for such it is come to be under ingenious skill and logical deduction. I have partaken of a more elab- orate and tasty dinner gotten up in a yacht’s small galley than I have ever had from “ Bridget’s ” great kitchen with all her conveniences, and I have at- tended informal dinners where everything served was cooked directly in front of me on a chafing- dish with but very little trouble, that produced a feast worthy of the gods.

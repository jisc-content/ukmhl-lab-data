The Bachelor and the Chafing-dish. 20 “It depends greatly on the condition of one’s stomach, I should say,” I said timidly. I always tried to enjoy everything the way he did. “ Yes ; it does depend on the stomach. I can see that. This one which you have just eaten is capi- tal.” We puffed our pipes in silence for a few mo- ments. Then, after a new brew of hot Scotch, Henderson said: “Now let me fix you up some- thing—just to top off with. We will have a Scotch woodcock ! ” “ Let’s talk about it instead. Really, I haven't an appetite. What is it ? ” He gave me a look of despair, and then resign- edly said, between puffs: “ If you want some- thing appetizing, you couldn’t think of anything better.” As for me, I never could get up much interest eating anything when once I had dined. But I’ll challenge any one to withstand Henderson’s seduc- tive ways. I have always thought that if I were a housekeeper I would do all my marketing just be- fore the meal hour. Even a raw carrot or a turnip had charms for me then. Many a time, on such occasions, have I wondered why it was difficult for even the most blase housekeeper to resist the tempta- tion of a fine-looking head of cabbage.

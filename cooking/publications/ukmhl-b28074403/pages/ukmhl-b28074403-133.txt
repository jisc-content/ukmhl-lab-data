The Autocrat and the Chafing-dish. 121 Three silver chafing-dishes stood ready on the side-table, one being placed in front of the host for each course. The servant passed him the ma- terials for making each dish just as they were wanted, everything being temptingly placed on the side-table close at hand. The first was simply an imported appetizer. Directions for the three following courses can be found by consulting the index. The quail was cooked as the recipe is given for spring chicken. The last, a violet sorbet, espe- cially delighted the women; the recipe I obtained from the Hotel Waldorf, as follows : One gallon orange and lemon ice, one-half bottle Creme Yvette, and two teaspoonfuls of vegetable violet color. Creamed Oysters A la Eugene McCarthy. â€”Here is a recipe for two : One pint oysters, one cup cream, one-half cup sherry, two tablespoonfuls Worcestershire, two drops tabasco, two walnuts of butter, small bunch celery cut fine, salt to suit. Stew until the gills of the oysters frill.

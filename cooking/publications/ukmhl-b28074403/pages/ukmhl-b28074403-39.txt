Camping out with “ £d.h 29 of coffee. I do not think it was very good then. Ed said it wasn’t; but it was the experience I got that was so tremendously valuable—don’t you know. We were talking it over the other night. Ed was smoking his old meerschaum pipe and tell- ing me that I didn’t know beans about cooking, or even catching fish, in those days. I said that even if I didn’t I got pretty good milk when I went for it. Then we discussed coffee, and came to the conclusion that there were two good ways of making it, and in the long run, unless it was for a demi tasse at the end of a dinner, the old- fashioned way of boiling it was the most satisfac- tory. But we hatched out three good recipes, and here they are : First.—See that you get good coffee, one part Mocha and two parts Java, ground fine. Fill a good-sized cup with it and mix well into this a raw egg and the shell. Now let your water—say a quart—come to the boiling point, then add to this the mixture. Let it stand for at least ten minutes and keep at the boiling point—at least let it boil up twice—then pour in a cup of cold water. Let stand for five minutes longer then serve with creat- or hot milk. This ought to make a c.up of dohoso coffee.

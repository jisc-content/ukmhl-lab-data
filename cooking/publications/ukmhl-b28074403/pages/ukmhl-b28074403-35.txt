The Lord Harry. 25 ing dish I gave him was “ Crofite clams,” then a “Billy Deutsch ragout,” and very frequently a “Bill Traver’s cocktail.” There was a seductive sound about the latter that caused Harry to look anxiously waiting when I first mentioned it. But it was nothing but very hot water. But the thing that really saved Harry’s life (and it helped me a good bit, too) was a brandy mixture. He liked it so well that he thought it ought to be printed in some way for the good of other poor devils in distress. So here it is: Mix a gill of brandy and a gill of cinnamon water, yolks of two eggs, half an ounce of powdered sugar, two drops of oil of cinnamon. I told Harry to take three tablespoonfuls of this every quarter of an hour if he was very exhausted. But he took it all at once and said he needed it that way !

n Salads and Sauces. prawns, or shrimps are dressed in the same way as salads. Sauce Mayonnaise.—Beat up well the yolks of two fresh raw eggs, a teaspoonful of salt, and a quarter as much Cayenne; mix with this by slow degrees four tablespoonfuls of oil, till it is about the consistence of cream, and then stir in grad- ually two tablespoonfuls of vinegar. It requires great care in mixing. A half a teaspoon of mus- tard may be added. Sauce A l’Italienne.—Chop an anchovy quite small, and rub it quite smooth with a teaspoonful of made mustard and a tablespoonful of oil; then add by degrees three more tablespoonfuls of oil, one of garlic vinegar, and one of good wine vinegar; stir till all be smooth and creamy, and serve in a separate bowl, to be added to the salad at table. A salad can be made of almost anything—from tomatoes and cucumbers to sardines, or veal in place of chicken. A great deal in mixing and dressing must be left to the judgment of the salad-master, and any one with good taste and love of feasting stands an equally good chance with Dumas in hit- ting upon something tasty in the way of an original juxtaposition of condiments and meats.

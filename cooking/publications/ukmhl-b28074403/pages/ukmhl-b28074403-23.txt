Mushrooms for “fim.' *3 ing could be better. But oh, for a broiled mush- room on toast! ” “You shall have it.” “ In a chafing-dish ? Come off, old man ! ” This is how I did it : In the first place, they were fresh—just from the field where I had found them. Into the chafing- dish I put some sweet olive-oil—just enough to flood it. Then a teaspoonful of paprika, a divina- tion of black pepper, and a pinch of salt. Into this I placed the mushrooms, hollow part upward, put on the cover, and they browned in—well, say ten minutes. Turning them into a covered dish, I put two slices of bread into the hot pan with half an ounce of butter. In a few seconds they were heated sufficiently to serve the mushrooms upon.

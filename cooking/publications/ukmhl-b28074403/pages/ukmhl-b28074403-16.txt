Rub this around in the pan until it begins to simmer. Now add to this a smooth teaspoon of paprika, a couple of table- spoons of beer or ale, and mix well with a spoon. Empty the cheese into this and manipulate it well until it becomes the consistency of batter, mean- while adding more ale by degrees. Put in a modi- cum of salt, and either a tablespoonful of prepared English mustard or two of the French, and stir well until the cheese begins to bubble. There are some people who like the added flavor of Worces- tershire sauce. I never had a rabbit become stringy if, at this stage, I took care of it and let it thor- oughly cook while stirring. Have your bread or toast ready, and with a fork plunge each piece into the rabbit, thoroughly covering it, and then quickly serve on a heated plate. I do not think it makes much difference whether ale or beer is usedâ€”in fact, milk is an excellent substitute. Paprika is preferable to red pepper. It actually helps to digest the cheese.

The Bachelor and the Chafing-dish. 102 accomplished the oysters and mushrooms were ready to be put together, and the eggs and cream were mixed with them. The whole was allowed to get very hot without boiling, and was served with pieces of puff paste cut into half-moons. Oyster Rabbit.—Clean and remove the hard muscles from half a pint of oysters ; parboil them in the chafing-dish in their own liquor until their edges curl, and remove to a hot bowl. Put one tablespoonful of butter, one-half pound of cheese (broken in small bits), one saltspoonful each of salt and mustard, and a few grains of Cayenne into the chafing-dish ; while the cheese is melting, beat two eggs slightly, adding them to the oyster liquor ; mix this gradually with the melted cheese ; add the oysters and turn at once over hot toast. Oysters in a Loaf.—Drain fifty good, fat oys- ters. Put them over the fire ; watch carefully to a boil. Drain ; add to the liquor sufficient milk to make one pint. Rub together two tablespoonfuls butter and two of flour. Add milk and liquor. When boiling add oysters, the yolks of two eggs added quickly, a tablespoonful of parsley, and a palatable seasoning of salt and pepper. Serve hot in a boat made from stale bread nicely fried.

i JM/AQRINKLES DIAPASON I read in the Sun that the boys and jgP girls were gathering autumn leaves ^ in the country, and a poetical descrip- tion of the azure haze in the air, the sunshine of gold, and the splashed colors of the rainbow painted on the foliage, set me to think- ing. I had really allowed myself to forget for the moment that God was visiting anywhere near me, and I was fired by a sudden desire to go and witness some of His transformation scenes outside the city gates. I had one friend in the country whom I knew would welcome me; so I telegraphed to Nym Crinkle at his house in the Ramapo hills, and this was his reply : Come on up. I have a new Alderney cow to show you; a short-horn bull ; the dog has pups ; the ground is covered with chestnuts and apples, and the sun rises every morning Nym met me at Spring Valley as the 4.57 train came in. He was on the back seat, with an extra coat for me because, as he said, I probably thought it was just as warm eight hundred feet above my New York office. “ Rube ” drove, and remarked as we bowled along over the road that if I’d go to Nymsden. where you can see it.

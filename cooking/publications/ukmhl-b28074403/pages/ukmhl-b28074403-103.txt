The Autocrat and the Chafing-dish. 91 “Howard’s Hash: The Kind of Hash that Mother Used to Make.”—Chop the corn-beef and the boiled potatoes together very fine; put into the chafing-dish (over the hot-water dish) with a prodigality of butter, and season well. Keep up constant turning until well heated through. Add a little water if too dry, and let simmer for a while. Hash A la Murrey.—Cut into small pieces two pounds of corn-beef, and cut into dice raw potatoes which, when cut up, will equal in bulk the cut-up meat. Cut up one large sour apple, and chop all together. Cut up fine two medium-sized onions and a large sweet Spanish pepper. Now put into a large frying-pan a scant tablespoonful of beef drippings or oil—butter will not do ; when hot add the onion and fry a delicate brown. Next add the pepper, toss about for a few moments, then add a gill of strong beef-stock, after which the other chopped ingredients and a pint more of beef- stock or strong broth. Mix well, cover, and sim- mer thirty minutes. Should the moisture evaporate too quickly before the ingredients are cooked, add more of the broth. Stir to prevent sticking to the pan. Taste for seasoning, and put away until next day, when it should be warmed in the chafing-dish with hot-water dish underneath it.

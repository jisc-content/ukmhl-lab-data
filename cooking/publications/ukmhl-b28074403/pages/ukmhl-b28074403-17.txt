7 Chasing the Rabbit. “ A golden buck ” is simply a Welsh rabbit with a poached egg dropped upon it. The late William J. Florence, the actor, once asked me for a good recipe for a Welsh rabbit. I was prompted to send him the following: Should you ask me, friend and actor, “ Whence the flavor of the rabbit, Whence its odor and its smoothness, Whence its subtle fascination ? ” I should answer, I should tell you : “ From the method of its mixture, From the choice of its ingredients, And the time of introduction, This the way to make a rabbit: * Give me of your cheese, O grocer 1 Good fresh dairy cheese domestic— Cheese quite fresh, not old and mouldy.* Cut it then in dainty fragments— Fragments cut in sizes equal; Light the spirit-lamp and place it ’Neath the blazer brightly gleaming} Then a lump of butter placing In the blazer, watch it creaming, Creaming in the heated blazer ; Then with deftness add the substance— Creamy substance, cut in fragments.

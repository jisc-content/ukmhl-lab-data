spending two or three dollars for our dinners the way we have been doing ? There are the Appleby-Joneses, who are rather high tarts, and they get ever so much more than we do, with wine included, for only fifty cents apiece ! ” So Tom and I determined to forsake the “ Studio ” or the “ Clifton ” for a while, and see how things worked along on Twenty-fifth Street. There were three places, next door to each other, that held out alluring signs, and canopies down to the sidewalk in case the night was wet. Our first dinner was aston- ishing. How they could do it we didn’t know : half a dozen courses, claret, all the black coffee you wanted, and only ten cents to the waiter. To be sure, the oil on the salad tasted as though it had been made out of old shoes, and the salt was of the quality that hides are preserved in. Yet it wasn’t necessary to gorge ourselves with either, and we considered in the first hour of our enthusiasm that we had struck oil, even if it were of an inferior kind.

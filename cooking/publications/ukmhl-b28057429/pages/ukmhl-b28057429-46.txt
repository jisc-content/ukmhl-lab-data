42 2 oranges, i lemon, -pint water, *^-gill kirschwasser or cognac brandy, colouring, and few glace cherries. Method.—Put the fruit pulp and syrup, sugar, orange juice, and lemon juice into a stewpan, add the water, boil up, skim and strain ; when cold, incorporate enough saffron or yellow vegetable colouring to give the mixture the desired tint. Now add the liqueur (Kirsch or brandy), and freeze in the usual manner. Serve in little glasses or cups, and just a few tiny pieces of glace cherries on top of each glass. 64.—SORBET AUX PECHES. (Peach Sorbet.) Proceed in the same manner as in the the foregoing recipe, but use peach pulp in place of apricot pulp. When sufficiently frozen fill the glasses intended to be used, and sprinkle some finely chopped pistachio nuts over each. No colouring matter need be used for this sorbet. When grapes are procurable, 18-20 white grapes added to either the peach or apricot sorbet will improve the flavour considerably. 65.—SORBET DE MELON. (Melon Sorbet.) Peel a ripe melon, cut it into slices and pound in a mortar, rub the pulp through a fine sieve, put it in a stewpan with half- a pint of water, half-a-pound of loaf-sugar, the juice of 2 lemons and 1 orange. Strain, and freeze when cold. When partially frozen add 1 gill of champagne, and a y -gill of cura9oa or maraschino. Mix thoroughly, re-freeze, and serve. A small quantity of crystallized melon peel, finely chopped, may be put on top of each glass if liked.

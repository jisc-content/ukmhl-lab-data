45 through a sieve or tammy cloth. Boil up with the sugar, skim, and let cool in a china basin or pan. Proceed to freeze in the usual way. When partially frozen add the minced pineapple, previously steeped in a little brandy, and sprinkled over with castor sugar. Now add the liqueur, and about a gill of finely-crushed ice. Mix well, and serve. 73.—GRANITE AU CHAMPAGNE. Freeze 3 pints of lemon water, as directed in recipe No. 37, then add half a bottle of champagne. Mix thoroughly, and incor- porate carefully about half a pound of soft fruit, such as strawberries, apricots, or peaches, all cut into dice. Lastly, stir in a small quantity of crushed ice. It is then ready for serving. Note.—A large number of delicious sorbets and granites (or “granitos,” as they are sometimes called) may be prepared without being either elaborate or expensive by using various kinds of fruit in season, adapting a formula for blending and propor- tions in the foregoing recipes, all of which will be found workable. An ingeniously- minded cook should therefore have no diffi- culty in producing a constant change in these dishes, especially during summer, when they are so much appreciated. 74.—PUNCH A LA NICOISE. Make a quart of lemon-water ice (No. 37 or 38). When partially frozen incor- porate an Italian meringue in the pro- portion stated in recipe No. 55. Also 2 tablespoonfuls of rum and a glassful of champagne. Mix well, and fill up some plain or coloured imitation glasses (see No. 56).

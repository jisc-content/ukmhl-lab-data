38 It is, therefore, hardly possible for me to give the recipe for each of these. I will, however, enumerate the most important ones in which the representative kinds are fully dealt with and explained. 54.—SORBETS. The word “sorbet” derives its origin from sherbet, thus sorbet originally implied an effervescing cooling drink, this being iden- tical with the Oriental sherbet. It was sherbet, we are told, that gave delight to the feasts of Saladin, which shows that the article was associated with all the romance and luxury of Moslem life. We may thus take it for granted that the word sorbet is of Arctic origin, which signifies a beverage frozen into a semi-solid state. Nearly all sorbets and punches contain a small proportion of alcohol in the form of liqueur, spirit, or wine. This may be omitted, but the flavour and character of the ice is thereby spoilt, or at least imperfect. I would, therefore, recommend that a small quantity of the alcoholic liquors be employed in accordance with the directions given in the recipes. 55.—ITALIAN MERINGUE. Used for Sorbets, Punch, etc. Dissolve half-a-pound of loaf sugar in about a gill of water, and boil in a copper sugar boiler till it reaches 40 degrees Fahr. on Senn’s saccharometer. Stir in by de- grees the whites of three eggs beaten to a very stiff froth. Whisk this for about three minutes over the fire, and use as •directed.

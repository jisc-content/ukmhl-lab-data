37 53-—GLACE DE GINGEMBRE. Ingredients.—4 ozs. preserved ginger (in syrup), 1 orange, 2 lemons, the white of 1 egg, 1 pint syrup. Method.—Cut up the preserved ginger, and pound till smooth with a little of its syrup in a mortar, rub it through a fine sieve, and put in a stewpan. Rub two or three lumps of sugar on the orange so as to extract the flavour of the rind, put this into the pan with the fruit pulp, and add the strained juice of the orange and lemon, also the pint of syrup, and about half a gill of water. Boil up, skim, and strain. When cold, freeze in the usual manner. Whisk the white of egg to a stiff froth, and incor- porate with the mixture when about half frozen; then finish freezing, mould or serve rough. A tablespoonful of liqueur, cura9oa or maraschino, can be added if liked. SORBETS, GRANITES, etc. (Demi-Glace.) The general character of these ices is that they are of a semi-frozen consistency; the mixture consists usually of syrups, fruit juices, fruit pulps, coffee or tea, flavouring essences, liqueurs or wines. Most of these, especially the sorbets and punches, are served immediately before the roast; this, it is said, prepares one for the more perfect enjoyment of the succeeding dishes, i.e.> the roast and the entremets courses. The characteristic points about these ices is that they are never moulded, for they are served in fancy glasses or cups, each holding just enough for one person. There are some hundreds of different kinds of sorbets, granites, punches, and cremolates.

57 Method.—Put the sugar in a copper- pan or sugar-boiler, add to it about y2 pint of water, and boil it to thick syrup, and remove the scum. Whisk the eggs, yolks and whites, in a basin for about io minutes, then pour in the hot syrup. Mix thoroughly, and pour into a copper egg-bowl, stand it over a brisk fire, and whisk the mixture until it becomes of the consistency of cream ; add the double cream, and whisk a little longer. Allow it to cool, and fill into a plated souffle dish, lining it with a paper band to come about an inch above the rim, so as to prevent the souffle from running over. Place the dish in a round tin (a large cask tin will be found the most suitable for this purpose), fasten it with a tight-fitting lid. Line the bottom of a pail with crushed ice, mixed with freezing- salt ; place the tin on this, pack the sides of the pail with ice and salt, and put some on the top; freeze this for about 3 hours. To serve, take out the tin, wipe it, remove the lid, take out the souffle, remove the paper band, place the dish on another dish with a folded napkin. Sprinkle the top with grated chocolate, and send to table immediately. 97.—SOUFFLE FRAPPE AUX FRAMBOISES.

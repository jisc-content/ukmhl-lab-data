35 46.—GLACE A L’EAU DE FRAMBOISE S. (Raspberry Water Ice.) Ingredients.—i y2 lbs. ripe raspberries (picked), the juice of 2 lemons, iy pints syrup. Method.—Rub the fruit through a fine sieve into a basin, add the lemon juice and the syrup; strain and freeze.

(Strawberry Water Ice.) Rub 1 y2 lbs. of small ripe strawberries through a fine sieve, and proceed to add the same ingredients as indicated in recipe No. 46, omitting the raspberries. 48. —GLACE A L’EAU D’ABRICOTS. (Apricot Water Ice.) This is made exactly the same as peach water ice, in No. 43, using apricot pulp instead of peach pulp ; a little liquid saffron, or saffron paste, should be added in order to give the ice a nicer tint. 49.—GLACE A L’EAU DE GROSEILLES. (Red Currant Water Ice.) Ingredients. — 1 lb. red currants (stripped), y2 lb. raspberries (picked), 1 quart syrup, the juice of 1 lemon. Method.—Rub the fruit, currants and raspberries, through a fine sieve, boil the syrup, and pour over the fruit pulp ; add the lemon juice, and strain when cold; freeze as usual. The syrup used for this ice should be of good consistency (rather longer boiled), owing to the acidity of the fruit used. c 2

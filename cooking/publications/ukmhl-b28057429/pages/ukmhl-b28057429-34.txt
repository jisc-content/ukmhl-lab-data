30 which must be bright and clear (not smoky). Allow it to boil; remove the scum that rises to the surface, and boil it till it registers 220 degrees Fah. on the saccharometer. Senn’s saccharometer is advised for this purpose, because it is most reliable in giving the correct degrees the syrup has reached in boiling. This instru- ment can be used for testing the heat of fat, or for registering the oven heat, as well as for sugar-boiling, for it registers up to 382 degrees. Every degree, from boiling water to the degree of caramel, is marked in plain letters against the figures, de- noting the exact state of heat. Senn’s saccharometer is made in a solid brass casing, and is unbreakable. It can be obtained from Messrs. Jones Bros., 13-14, Dover Street, Piccadilly, W., price 7/6. 34.—SYRUP FOR WATER ICES.—No. 2. Put 3 lbs. loaf sugar, a pinch of cream of tartar, and a quart of water into a copper boiler; beat up the white and shell of an egg, and add to the above. Bring it to the boil, and allow to cook (boil) for about 10 minutes. Remove the scum; reduce to the desired consistency, i.e., 220 degrees on Senn’s saccharometer. Strain, if neces- sary, and let cool. The syrup is then ready for use. 35.—GLACE AU CONFITURE. (Water Ice made from Jam.)

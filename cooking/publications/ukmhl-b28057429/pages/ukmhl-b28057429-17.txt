J3 mass. When a freezing machine is used the process is practically the same as above described. When icing mousses, souffles, sorbets, granites, coffee, etc., the process of freezing is somewhat different, but in such cases I will give the needful directions when dealing with the respective recipes of these dishes. When the mixture above described has frozen sufficiently firm the water should be drawn off from the pail or tub, and when it is desired to keep it for some time longer in the pot before moulding or serving it, more ice (crushed ice) should be put in the tub; very little salt should be used when refilling. In lifting the lid off the freezing pot, great care must be taken so as not to get any salt into the mixture, for if the least quantity of salt should get into it, the whole of the ice mixture ice pudding mould. is likely to become spoilt. FREEZING WITHOUT ICE. The following ingredients can be used with perfect success for freezing where ice is scarce or unattainable. Although dearer to use than ice and salt, it will be found most useful by those who are unable to get ice :â€” Take 2 parts of sulphate of soda, 1 part of muriate of ammonia, 1 part of nitrate of potash ; pound separately each ingre- dient in a mortar, and mix with water.

66 chocolate icing, royal icing, about il/2 pints of strawberry ice cream, io wafer cornets, i oz. of chopped pistachio kernels, custard ice for filling cornets. Method.â€”Break the eggs into a copper bowl or basin, add the sugar, and whip well for a few minutes. Stand it over a stewpan with boiling water and beat vigorously with a whisk for about 20 minutes. Butter and flour a large saute- pan. When the mixture is sufficiently worked, stir in by degrees the sifted flour, the sifted ground almonds, and the butter (melted), mix all well but carefully, pour into the tin, and bake in a moderately heated oven from 25 to 30 minutes. When cold, cut out as many rounds as are re- quired, but each one must be smaller than the other. Stamp out the centre of each round thus obtained to form rings about an inch or 1^ inches broad, leaving the largest and the smallest one whole. The largest will form the bottom and the smallest the top of the gateau. Have some apricot jam made liquid, place the large round on a dish, spread the tops and bottoms of the rings with apricot jam and fasten them together, commencing with the largest, so as to form a pyramid. Allow the gateau to set, and coat the outside with chocolate icing. Ornament with royal icing to taste. (Do not fix the top layer.) Fill the cornets with a previously prepared custard ice, sprinkle the tops with chopped pistachio kernels, fasten them by means of a little icing in a row round the gateau. When the dish is required for table, re- move the top piece and fill with strawberry ice cream, replace the top, and serve. The chocolate icing may, if liked, be sub- stituted with strawberry or orange fondrnt icing.

39 56.—IMITATION GLASS MOULDS AND CUPS. Used for serving all kinds of Ices. Special kinds of moulds are required for this, which are generally made in two parts. Fill the sides with plain or coloured water (red, yellow, or green tinted). When the shapes are to be opaque add a little milk to the water. Place the moulds in a charged souffle ice cave, or failing this, pack them carefully into a tin large enough to hold the mould or moulds, and allowing sufficient room for the ice (crushed ice) and salt to surround it or them. Allow about three hours for freezing. Great care must be taken to prevent any salt water pene- trating into the moulds, else the ice which is to be served in them will be spoilt. When ready unmould them carefully. 57—SORBET AUX FRAISES. (Strawberry Sorbet.) To a quart of strawberry water ice (half- frozen) add half-a-gill of sauterne wine and a small glass of cura5oa; colour it with a few drops of carmine, mix thoroughly, and serve when sufficiently frozen. 58.—SORBET DE GROSEILLES AU MARASQUIN. (Gooseberry Sorbet with Maraschino.) Stir 1 pint of picked green gooseberries in ^-pint of water, to which add y2-lb. of loaf sugar, and the juice of 2 lemons. Rub through a hair sieve, colour with a little spinach greening, to give it a pretty light green colour. When cold add half-a-gill of maraschino. Freeze partially, and serve in small glasses. Garnish with a few stoned cherries, previously tossed in a little syrup flavoured with maraschino.

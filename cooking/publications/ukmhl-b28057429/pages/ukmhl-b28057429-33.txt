29 together with the Kirsch liqueur. Freeze in the usual way, mould, or serve in glasses. 32.—ANOTHER WAY. Sweeten a pint of very strong coffee with 4 ozs. of sugar. When cold, add 1% pints of good, fresh cream, lightly whisked, and freeze. This ice is improved if the coffee is first partially frozen and the whipped cream is added afterwards. WATER ICES. So-called water ices are mostly prepared from the juices of ripe fruits, mixed with the needful proportion of syrup. In making these, it must be borne in mind that if the mixture is made too sweet there will be a difficulty in the freezing, and as the sweet- ness of the various kinds of fruit differs, great and special care must be taken in mixing syrup with fruit pulps or fruit juices. In order to test the correct con- sistency of syrup the use of a saccharometer is strongly advised. Syrups can, with ad- vantage, be used for cream and mixed ices, ice puddings, mousses, souffles, sor- bets, granites, etc., in fact, with all mix- tures or drinks that are to be frozen where syrup is used these remarks are applicable. In such cases where fresh fruit is not obtainable jam is often used, and as all jams are made with sugar, it is essential that this be taken into consideration when mixing the syrup. 33.—SYRUP FOR WATER ICES.—No. 1.

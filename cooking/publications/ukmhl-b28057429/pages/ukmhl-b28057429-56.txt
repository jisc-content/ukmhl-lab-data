52 pan of boiling water, and stir steadily with an egg-whisk till the mixture acquires the consistency of thick cream. Pass through a fine sieve, and now add the remainder of cream, whisk all over the ice until quite cold. Fill a mould, cover it securely, and set it in salted ice, as directed in No. 84. Allow about two hours to freeze. To serve this or any other moulded ice, remove the mould from the ice, dip it quickly into cold water, wipe it, and unmould the iced shape on a dish with folded napkin, and garnish with ice-wafers. 8g.—MOUSSE AU MARASQUIN. Ingredients.—4 yolks of eggs, y lb. loaf sugar, % pint water, y gill Kirsch- wasser, y2 gill Maraschino, about y2 pint cream ice and freezing salt. Method.—Put the sugar and water in a copper-pan, boil up slowly, remove the scum, and boil until it becomes a syrup, registering 240 deg. by Senris Saccha- vometer. Beat up the yolks of eggs in a basin, stir in the hot syrup, add the 2 liqueurs, stir with a whisk over a stewpan of boiling water for about 6 minutes, taking care that the eggs do not curdle. Place the basin in a cool place, stirring the contents whilst cooling. Have ready a plain charlotte mould, lined with white paper. Add the cream, well whipped, to the mixture when cool, and fill the mould. Cover with a piece of paper close up to the lid, so as to hermetically seal the mould, bury it in a pail of crushed ice and freezing salt; let it remain thus for at least 2 hours. When required for serving, immerse the mould in cold water, wipe well, remove the lid, turn out on a dish covered with a folded napkin or dish-paper, remove the paper lining, and serve quickly.

12 pot has been turned for a short time some of the ice around it will sink, when the tub or pail must be replenished with more crushed ice and salt. When this is done, wipe the top of the freezing pot with a wet cloth, and place a damp cloth or a piece of sacking (damped) on the top of the ice, between the pot and tub or pail; this is done to prevent the escape of frost, and to keep out the warm air. When this is done, lift off the lid of the pot, wipe carefully the inside of it, and pour in the mixture you wish to freeze; replace the lid tightly, and proceed to turn the pot by the handle of the lid as quickly as possible. Use one hand only for turning. In a very short time a thin coating of the frozen mixture will be noticed on the side of the freezing - pot; this must be scraped down with the spatula, and as soon as another layer is formed it must be dealt with in the same manner, but each time the mix- ture should be well worked up (mixed) with the spatula ; this, and the turning, is continued until the mixture has acquired the desired consistency, i.e., a creamy MELON ICE MOULD.

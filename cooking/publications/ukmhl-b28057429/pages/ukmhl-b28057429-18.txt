H 4 ounces of the above mixed with about i gallon of water will make a good freezing mixture. USEFUL HINTS AND RULES ON ICE-MAKING. Before dealing with the individual recipes for making ices, I shall give the following simple rules and hints, which should be strictly observed by those who desire to benefit by the recipes and instructions given on the subject :— 1. —Do not put hot or warm mixtures into the freezing pot, as by so doing much of the ice will get wasted. 2. —Be careful in weighing and measuring the various ingredients required. Use the exact proportions stated in each recipe. 3. — Keep a quantity of syrup on hand ; if kept in corked bottles it will keep good for a long period, and will always be ready when wanted. 4. —In adding- sweetening ingredients, sugar or syrups, remember that too much sugar will prevent the ice mixture from getting firm, whilst too little sugar will cause it to freeze too hard. 5. —Avoid, as much as possible, the use of tin or copper utensils in the manu- facture of ices, because, by their use, an objectionable flavour is often introduced, and the ices are apt to get discoloured. 6. —Keep the mixtures to be frozen out of the freezing pot until you are ready to attend to the process of freezing. 7. —In colouring and flavouring ices use harmless vegetable colours, fresh ripe or preserved fruits and liqueurs, and get the best and purest obtainable. 8. —Do not take the lid off the freezer before the lid is carefully wiped, so that no salt can possibly get into the mixture.

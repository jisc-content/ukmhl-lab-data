Ingredients.—y2 pint preserved mixed fruit (cherries, apricots, peaches, &c.), y^ teaspoonful Cavona essence, y2 pint cream, y2 gill Marsala, 1 tablespoonful grated chocolate, 1 gill syrup, 1 glass Maras- chino, y oz. leaf gelatine, a little milk, 1 small lemon, 1 oz. blanched almonds. Method.—Cut the fruit into dice or small slices. Preserved fruit may be used if fresh fruit is not obtainable. Glace cherries are preferable to fresh cherries for this dish. Moisten the fruit with the syrup, boil up, add the liqueur, and let cool. Arrange the fruit neatly in a silver or glass compot dish, pour over about half the syrup. Mix the remainder of syrup with the sherry, add to it the gelatine pre- viously soaked in a little milk ; stir over the fire until the gelatine has dissolved. Add the rind of half a small lemon finely grated, the Cavona flavouring, and the juice of the lemon. Strain into a basin, and let cool. Whip the cream. Stir this into the above. When the cream begins to set pour it slowly over the fruit, and place it on the ice, and place some broken ice round the mould. Keep it thus for about two hours. Just before serving sprinkle the top with grated chocolate, and garnish with strips of blanched almonds. 105.—POUDING GLACE A LA NESSELRODE.

70 n6.—ORANGES GLACEES A LA NAPOLITAINE. (Iced Oranges, Neapolitan Style.) Ingredients.—4 - 6 fine, even - sized Dranges, vanilla custard, wine jelly, spinach greening, 1 glass green Chartreuse. Method.—Wipe the oranges, make an incision on top of each with a pastry cutter about \]/^ inch diameter, remove the covers with a small knife, and lay them aside till later. Scoop out the centre of the oranges with a small teaspoon, being careful not to break the skin (the pulp may be used for some other purpose.) Arrange the orange shells in a tin, place the tin in a basin or tub surrounded with broken ice. Fill the oranges in alternate layers with vanilla cream and jelly, the latter being prepared in two colours (red and green), being flavoured with raspberry and cura<;oa, or Chartreuse. Each layer must be set before the other is poured in. Put on the covers before the top layer is set. Wrap the oranges in kitchen paper, and place them in the ice cave for about two hours. When well set and firm, cut the oranges carefully into quarters (this is best done with a knife dipped in hot water), dress them on a dish with a folded napkin or dish papers, and serve. 117—ICED FRUITS. Any desirable fruit may be iced by dipping, first, in the beaten white of an egg, then in coarse or granulated sugar. Do this until the sugar coating is sufficiently thick. Peaches should be pared and cut in halves, and sweet juicy pears are treated in the same way. Cherries, strawberries, and other small fruits are iced with the stems on, only the largest being chosen. Pineapples should be cut into thin slices,

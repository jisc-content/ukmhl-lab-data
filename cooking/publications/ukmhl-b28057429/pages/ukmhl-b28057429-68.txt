64 or essence of vanilla, 8 yolks of eggs, i glass Maraschino, 2 ozs. glace cherries. Method.—Slit the chestnuts, blanch them, and remove the husks and skins, cook till tender in milk, adding the vanilla pod if the latter be used. Take up the chestnuts, pound them in a mortar, and rub them through a fine sieve. Boil a gill of the milk, and pour over the egg yolks ; when cooked, strain to the puree of chest- nuts. Boil the sugar to a syrup in a pint of water, add this to the chestnut puree. When cold add half the cream. Put the mixture in a freezing-pot, and freeze till almost set ; now add the Maraschino and the cherries, cut into small dice or slices. Whip the remainder of cream, and add also. Continue to freeze, stirring the mixture frequently. When the mixture is sufficiently frozen fill up one or two moulds. Close them tightly. Wrap up in paper, and bury in ice and salt. Let it thus remain till required for table. 106.—GLACE PLOMBIERE A LA JAPONAISE.

i6 employed, the quantities of sugar or syrup given should be regarded as the approximate items. The quality of most fresh fruits as regards to sweetness is more or less im- paired in wet or dry seasons; this is one of the reasons why some special care is re- quired in the use of sugar or other sweetening ingredients as far as fruit ices are concerned. The quantities given are, unless otherwise stated, calculated for a full service (6-8 persons); if more or less is required, the ingredients can easily be increased or decreased, as the case may be.

Pass through a fine strainer or tammy. Add the vanilla again, and remove it when

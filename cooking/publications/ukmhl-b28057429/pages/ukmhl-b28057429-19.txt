i5 9-—In moulding ices, press in the mix- ture tightly, and wrap the mould in white paper ; avoid the use of fat or lard to cover the openings, the paper will do this. THE MOULDING OF ICES. See that the moulds you wish to use are thoroughly clean and dry, put in the frozen mixture (cream or water-ice mixture). Shake it down, and press well into the mould. Close up the mould, and if any leakage should be apparent, cover it with a little butter or lard—this is needed when old moulds are used. Wrap up the mould or moulds with kitchen paper, and bury in a pail of crushed ice and salt (use 3 parts of ice and 1 part of salt); keep it thus for about two hours. UNMOULDING AND SERVING ICES. When the ice is required to be served, take out the mould, remove the paper and the butter or lard (when the latter is used), dip the mould for a few seconds into cold water (tepid water may be used, but more care is then required), and turn out into a dish, the same as you would turn out a jelly. Garnish the dish with a few ice wafers or ice biscuits, and send to table at once. THE RECIPES. Having explained the necessary pre- liminaries for ice making, I shall deal with the individual recipes for making the various mixtures. In giving these recipes, whether for cream ices, water ices, fancy ices, souffles, or sorbets, I have tried to give, as near as possible, the correct quantities of ingredients needed ; but as the amount of sweetening, sugar or syrup, required depends to a large extent upon the kind and quality of fruit

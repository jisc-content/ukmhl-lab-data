6g 114.—CHARLOTTE GLACEE A LA PRINCESSE. Prepare 1 y2 pints of rich ice cream cus- tard, flavour it with a small glass of liqueur brandy, add y2 gill of whipped cream; freeze this to the usual consistency for moulding. Line one or two plain Charlotte moulds with white paper, previously rubbed over with good olive oil. Trim some finger or savoy biscuits, and range them neatly round the inside of the moulds. Mix an ounce of finely-cut glace cherries with the ice mixture, and fill the moulds. Place the mould or moulds in a charged ice cave for two hours. When required for table unmould, carefully remove the paper, and ornament the top of Charlotte with whipped cream coloured a pale pink, using a forcing bag with a rose tube for this purpose. This must be done very quickly, as it needs to be served immediately. 115.—DENISES GLACES. (Ice Cream Sandwiches.) This is a most convenient and dainty way of serving almost any kind of ice. The ice wafers manufactured by Messrs. Peek, Frean & Co. are best adapted for this dish. These wafers being quite plain and of delicate light make, the true flavour of the ice is in no way impaired. When the ice cream or water ice is sufficiently frozen to allow it being spread, cover a number of ice wafers with a layer of the ice; place a wafer on the top of each like a sandwich. Pack them in a charged ice pail or cave, place a paper between each layer, and keep thus till required for table. Messrs. Peek, Frean & Co. supply a most useful Ice Cream Sandwich suitable for this purpose.

PREFACE. E object of offering this little book to the culinary profession is to add a new and up-to-date supplement to the number of standard Cookery books already in existence. Only in very few instances has this subject before been assigned a separate volume. Few cooks are acquainted with the art of making Ices, and those who know this branch of the culinary art are constantly in need of novelties. It is therefore hoped that the present volume may supply a want, which has prompted the author to produce in the present form. The art of making Ices is unquestionably one of the most fascinating branches in cookery, and in compiling the various recipes for Iced Dishes, the author has exercised every care to meet the actual needs of those who are desirous of culti- vating this interesting and useful branch. It is the authorâ€™s sanguine conviction that those who follow the recipes described in this little book will be rewarded with results both pleasing to the eye and acceptable to the palate. C. H. S.

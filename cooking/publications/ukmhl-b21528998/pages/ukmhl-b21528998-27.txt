G^4S STOVES AND OVENS. ii lights and burns in the cup and pipe. When this happens, pure gas is burnt, showing a yellow flame and making a loud, roaring sound, while if properly lighted it has a blue flame and is silent. Pure gas yields a deposit of carbon which coats burner, stove and any utensil brought in contact with it, rendering them sooty and greasy, but the mixture of gas and air is so intensely hot as to burn up any im- purities in the gas itself, so that the surroundings are not soiled in the least. Gas ovens are fitted with the same kind of burner, and the same rules apply to the lighting of them. The ovens are lined with various materials, but they are generally of a non-porous character. Consequently, when the enclosed air in the oven is first heated, the moisture generated by the hot air in contact with the cold sides cannot escape readily, and it is advis- able to open the door once or twice at short intervals until it dries off. Then the oven may be closed and allowed to heat until the metal case is hot. Sufficient time must be allowed for this before food is placed inside to cook, for as long as the oven is absorbing, instead of reflecting heat, no regular temperature can be maintained. The roof of the oven is generally of fire-clay, which is not a good reflector; but, if better browning is required, a bright oven shelf placed close over the article to be browned keeps the heat from rising and throws it back. Except for such a purpose, solid sheets of metal should never be used in a gas oven. As the heat is all generated at the bottom, the oven cannot be hot throughout if a hindrance is offered to the rising of the hot air; therefore all shelves should be formed of bars or gratings, or if of

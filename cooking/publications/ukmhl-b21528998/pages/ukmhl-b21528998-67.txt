5i STOCK. When the stock is required definitely for brown or dark soups, the meat may be first seared on a hot pan, without fat, till a good brown, and the onion may be baked or burned brown; but if required for general pur- poses, this is better not done, as it would render the stock unfit for some dishes. The meat and bones should be put in the proper proportion of cold water, and, if possible, allowed to steep for an hour or more, stirring occasionally, so that the cold water may act upon all the particles and draw out the juices. The application of heat coagulates the albumen in meat, and the juices are then less easily extracted. Salt added to the cold liquid helps to draw out the juices. Stock should be slowly heated, and as it nears boiling- point careful skimming is required to remove any im- purities which may arise, but discretion must be used so as to remove only scum and not the coagulated juices which rise also in the form of a thick brown substance. When well skimmed, put in the vegetables. If added sooner, they render perfect skimming impossible, as they also float, and the scum adheres to them. After all materials are in the stock-pot, long, slow cooking is required—at least four hours of slow simmering—and, provided the temperature is kept sufficiently low, a longer time may be given with advantage. If it is desired to make second stock from these materials, the time of the first cooking should not be excessive, or there will be no flavour left to extract. The chief food value of second stock is its gelatine, which is very insipid, the chief value of first stock is the juice of meat contained in it. Second stock is made from the materials strained out of the first stock when finished, with a little fresh vegetable added and the full quantity of seasonings

METHODS OF COOKING. 4i cooked in an oven, where the principal inlet of air is by the door when opened for basting. The actual differences between roasting and baking are not great, the terms being frequently interchanged. Meat loses rather less weight when baked than when roasted, but the flavour of baked meat is inferior and less developed. The heat of an oven being steadier, baking takes somewhat less time than roasting. In a gas oven having an open floor the current of air is not impeded, and such baking very nearly approaches roasting, and the flavour is generally acknowledged to be the same. Stewing is cooking slowly with a small quantity of liquid in a covered vessel. The method is specially suitable for the coarser and cheaper parts of meat, which are thus rendered tender without loss of their juices. The usual plan is to make a gravy flavoured and coloured to suit the stew, and after the ingredients are well blended and cooked to lay the meat in the boiling liquid. After about two minutes’ boiling, the temperature is reduced to simmering (about 160° T.), a lower tem- perature than that required for a large joint of “ boiled ” meat. The time depends greatly on the quality of the meat, but none will stew satisfactorily in less than from H to 2 hrs., and the longer allowance is to be preferred. Frying is cooking by contact with fat at a very high temperature. It may be considered under two heads, generally known as the wet and dry methods, or by the terms “ friter ” and “ sauter ”. Wet frying is the better and more successful as well as by far the cheaper and easier method, but there are a few things for which it is not suited. The number is, however, very limited, the majority of fried dishes being distinctly better cooked in a bath of fat than in a shallow frying pan. In wet

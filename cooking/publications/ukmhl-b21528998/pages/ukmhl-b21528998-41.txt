COOKS' STORES. 25 and pickles will be found infinitely better when home- made and in small quantities, the flavour in general being much purer and stronger than that of those made for sale. Roux.—This is the foundation of thick sauces, and is the thickening ingredient of gravies. It may be used whenever a combination of butter and flour, either white or brown, is required, and if properly made in quantities, will effect an immense saving of time and trouble. Equal weights of butter and flour must be fried together. If for white roux, the heat must be low enough to avoid risk of colouring, but if brown roux is required the mixture should fry till it becomes a pale creamy shade. Either kind of roux will keep well for a considerable time if placed in wide-necked bottles or jars, tightly packed, or “ run ” into them to prevent air being enclosed, and then kept corked when not in use. One tablespoonful of this roux is equivalent to 1 oz. butter and 1 oz. flour. Glaze.—Although rather costly, glaze keeps well, and is a most useful material. It is simply strong meat and bone stock, reduced by excessive cooking to the con- sistency of glue, which becomes dry and hard when cold, and in that state may be kept for months. It may be made at home, but the process is long and troublesome, and the glaze frequently becomes burnt and useless when made in small quantities. Considering the time, cost of materials and trouble involved, home-made glaze cannot be considered economical. It is used for two purposes—for enriching and colour- ing sauces, gravies, etc., and for glazing dishes such as galantines, tongues, etc. The bought glaze is run into skins which adhere closely, and must be carefully removed either by peeling before or straining after

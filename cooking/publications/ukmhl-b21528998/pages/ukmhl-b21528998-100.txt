Perfect mixing of the various ingredients before moulding. 4. The consistency of the mixture at the time of being moulded. For creams the proportion of gelatine varies, there being so much difference in the materials used. Whipped cream, if mixed with other cold materials, has itself some degree of stiffening power, while in those creams having custard for a base the stiffening is still more marked. Syrup also and fruit pulp require less gelatine than thinner fluids, such as milk or water, but in all creams, as in jellies, allowance must be made for varying tem- perature of the weather. Creams should not be very stiff, only just stiff enough to stand steadily, and should cut easily without pressure. To insure this, extreme accuracy is necessary and weighing ingredients is essential. A common fault is to have creams too sweet. The materials used are generally so rich that if much sugar is added the result is cloying. In those creams that have custard for the foundation care must be taken that the custard is quite cold before the whipped cream is added. If warm, it reduces the cream to liquid and destroys its soft spongi-

INVALID COOKERY. 49 The food must be freshly cooked at the time it is required, not re-heated ; therefore it should be prepared in quantities just sufficient for one meal. The greatest care should be taken not to serve more than is allowed or needed at once, more harm being done by over than by under feeding. The greatest nicety and daintiness must be observed in dishing and serving. However disinclined a patient may be, appetite will come more readily at sight of a pretty, bright dish than when it is carelessly or roughly served. Cleanliness, simplicity, punctuality and neatness in the preparation and serving of invalidâ€™s food must be considered as important as the proper administration of medicine. 4

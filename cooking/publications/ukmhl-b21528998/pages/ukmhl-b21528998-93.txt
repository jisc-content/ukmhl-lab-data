OMELETS. 77 if roughly handled the whites are broken and watery, while if not thoroughly blended they separate and cook in tough pieces, unpleasant to taste, and leaving the omelet unaffected by their lightness. Both kinds should be quickly cooked, but the omelet souffle requires rather less heat than the simple omelet. Have all the surroundings thoroughly hot, the frying pan not merely hot in the middle but all over and the butter hot without a suspicion of colouring. For the omelet bottom heat only is required, and should be applied evenly as well as quickly, as the omelet toughens if too long or unequally cooked. The omelet is folded either in two or three before removing from the pan so that the bottom folds over and encloses the still liquid top. The omelet souffle is set with top heat after frying on the bottom, and when tinted brown and cooked a broad knife should be slipped under, right across the middle of the pan, and the omelet lifted on the knife so that the two sides fall and the top is on the outside. The dish for serving should be quite hot and ready the moment required. The doubled omelet souffle must be laid on the hot dish, instantly covered, and not exposed to air in carrying from the kitchen. Meat or fish added to omelets must be previously cookedâ€”except oysters, which require no cooking. Any materials added must be finely minced to prevent their weight carrying them to the bottom of the pan, where they would scorch.

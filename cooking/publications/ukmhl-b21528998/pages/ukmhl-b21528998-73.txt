(57) GRAVY AND SAUCE. Gbavy is the juice of i;he meat which escapes during cooking and partially solidifies in the receiver. Being heavier than the fat which escapes at the same time, it settles at the bottom, allowing the fat to be poured off. This residue when mixed with stock, and seasoned, forms a clear brown fluid of agreeable taste. When the joint is pork or the richer kinds of poultry, i.e., geese, ducks, the gravy is usually thickened, as thick gravy modifies the extreme richness of the meat. If the meat yields very little gravy, a substitute can be found in good stock or some of the many preparations to be purchased now, such as Bovril, Liebig, Yimbos, etc. Gravy should be perfectly free from fat, dark in colour and clear. The colour may sometimes be rather pale, especially from roast joints; that from baked is better, as the dripping tin in the oven, being hotter than the receiver of a hastener, helps to colour the juices as they drip. When deficient in colour a few drops of caramel may be used with advantage. The fat must be perfectly drained away, the slightest grease remaining being a sign of carelessness and most objectionable. If necessary, transfer the gravy sediment to a clean pan; this sometimes will help to prevent greasiness. The stock used may be second, that being good enough for all ordinary gravies; but if no stock is forthcoming,

48 PRINCIPLES OF PRACTICAL COOKERY. other purpose, and capable of being scalded or scoured. Much invalids’ food is cooked by the process of steaming, and this being frequently done in jars, these vessels must be very thoroughly cleansed and examined, as the com- mon glaze is liable to crack on the surface, and thus to first absorb and then communicate flavour. White lined iron saucepans are the best to use, but the lining must be perfect and uncracked, or they are open to the same objection as the earthenware jars. The materials used must be of the best quality and absolutely fresh, and as great a variety as possible should be provided. The manner of preparing should be the simplest, and seasoning and flavouring very carefully regulated by the patient’s taste, remembering that in illness the palate is very sensitive and would find ordinary seasonings too strong, and that certain seasonings and flavourings are not very wholesome and sometimes for- bidden. Fat or grease of any description must be care- fully avoided and removed. If it is impossible to leave it entirely out of the cooking, it must be taken away before serving, which can generally be done by skimming or laying pieces of clean absorbent paper on the surface. There are a few cases in which a very moderate amount of fat is not objectionable, but the fact must be ascertained, for a patient will often reject food altogether because a cup of soup or beef tea has been brought with specks of grease floating on the surface, though the quantity may be ever so small. A patient’s food must be given as punctually as his medicine, and it must not be forgotten that it is as unpunctual to have food ready too soon, and spoiled by over-cooking or waiting, as to be too late and find the appetite gone.

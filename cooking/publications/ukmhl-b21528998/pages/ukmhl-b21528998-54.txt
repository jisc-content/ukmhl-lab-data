38 PRINCIPLES OF PRACTICAL COOKERY. screen of bright metal which surrounds the hanging joint, and by reflection of heat cooks the sides turned fiom the fire, while at the same time the screen protects from draughts of cold air which would check the cooking. These two portions are not always joined, as the jack may be attached to the wall over the fire-place, and the screen arranged in any desirable position; they are, however, generally combined. Small joints and poultry, game, etc., are as a rule roasted in what is known as a game or Dutch oven. The principle of construction of a Dutch oven is the same as that of the “ hastener,” but as it has no jack connected with it the meat must be turned by hand. The great advantage of roasting as a method of cook- ing is that the juice of the meat can be retained more perfectly than by any other method except grilling, which for small and comparatively thin cuts, may be considered the counterpart of roasting, and in the same way heightens and improves the flavour of the food. To secure the retention of the juices, the surface albumen of the meat should at first be exposed to intense heat, and in this way a coat or rind is formed through which no liquids can pass. As the juices are naturally drawn out- wards, moderate heat would soon drain the joint and leave it dry and stringy if this first exposure to intense heat were neglected. No after attention will rectify a first error in this matter. It follows, then, that a fire bright and clear, and large enough to cover the surface of the joint, is essential; and the fire must be so ar- ranged that there shall be no considerable alteration in the heat during the time of roasting. Unless a fairly high temperature is maintained, the hardened surface will gradually become softened by the juices, and then these

MARKETING. 19 Vegetables.â€”Green vegetables are always at their best when cheapest and most plentiful. Out of season they have never the same flavour however well they may be grown. The absolute freshness of vegetables cannot be too strongly insisted upon, for when stale they are unwholesome. When fresh vegetables are in good con- f dition they are crisp and of a bright colour, any softness or faded yellow appearance shows they are stale. A leaf, pod or stalk should break with a sharp crack when bent. | Certain vegetables with stalks may be kept for a short time if the stalk only is placed in water, but such though usable are not equal to freshly gathered ones. Cucumber, vegetable marrow and asparagus last best, but leaf, stalk or pod vegetables do not keep at all well. Parsley may be kept several days if the stalks only are placed in water, but as soon as it begins to fade and become limp it should be destroyed. It is only wholesome while crisp. What are known as root vegetables are, of course, stored for use all the year, and do not perceptibly deteriorate, though the flavour is finer when fresh. To keep well they should not be stored till fully ripened, and then must be carefully arranged in cool, but not too cold, dry chambers. Moisture or warmth will cause growth and sprouting, which always lessens their value. A brick floor with sand or sacking to protect from frost is con- sidered the best means of preserving root vegetables. Onions should be hung up in a cool dry place. If allowed to sprout the flavour becomes rank and coarse.

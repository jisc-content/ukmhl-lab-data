(76) OMELETS. Omelets may be considered as of two kindsâ€”omelets and omelet souffles. In the first whole eggs are used, in the second the whites are separated and added in froth. The omelet pan should be of fairly thick material with rather sloping and shallow sides, so that a knife can easily be slipped round ; it must be kept exclusively for the one purpose, if taken for indiscriminate frying the omelets suffer. It should be kept clean by wiping while still hot with paper, and then a dry cloth, but should never be washed, as water renders it more liable to catch and burn. The butter used for frying is incorporated during cooking with the eggs, it should therefore be unsalted, and must not be allowed to become over-heated, as the slightest browning of the butter will spoil both appear- ance and taste. Salt butter is more liable to burn, and also gives a rough and rather bitter taste, and for all sweet omelets, at any rate, the salt is in excess.

In the omelet souffle, however, the yolks require little beating, but the whites can hardly be too stiff. They must be freshly whipped and used at once.

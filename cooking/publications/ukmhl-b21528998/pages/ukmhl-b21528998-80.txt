(64) PASTRY. Pastry is a combination of flour and fat, and may be suet, short, flaky or puff pastry, according to the materials used and the method by which they are combined. All kinds may be baked, but only suet crust is suitable for boiling, while short and puff pastry may also be fried. The fat used is known by the general name of shortening. In using suet as shortening, it must be perfectly freed from skin and chopped or scraped to fine powder that it may amalgamate perfectly with the flour. Other shortenings are oil (not much used in England, except by vegetarians), lard, dripping and butter. Butter and lard are sometimes used in combination to reduce expense. All shortenings should be as free as possible from salt and from water, and very fresh and sweet. Nothing could be much more nauseous than any trace of rancid- ness. The proportion of fat to flour varies according to the richness required, from less than half to nearly, and in the case of rich puff paste to quite, equal weights. Where the shortening is less than half the weight of flour, a small quantity of baking powder is used to give crispness and shortness to the crust, but pastry in which it is used does not keep well, and should be eaten while quite fresh.

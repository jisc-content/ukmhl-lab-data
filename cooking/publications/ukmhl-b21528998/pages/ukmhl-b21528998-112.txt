96 PRINCIPLES OF PRACTICAL COOKERY. possible. For this purpose a whole tongue is often used, this being not unlike, in outline, the breast bone, which it replaces. The tongue is surrounded with sausage and forcemeat to the capacity of the skin, and the edges are drawn together with needle and thread. While in boning poultry and meat the great object is to get the bone out, in boning fish it is usually to take the flesh off. The process is known as filleting and is generally done by the fishmonger, but when this is not the case the single rule for boning must be strictly adhered to—keep the knife on the bone—lifting the flesh with the left hand while the knife slips in between the bone and the flesh. Flat fish are divided down the middle of each side well into the bone, and the boning is begun at either side of the incision. Eound fish are cut down the back, the flesh is laid open from one side and the bone is removed from the other. Occasionally round fish are really boned, the whole fish minus the bones being returned to its proper shape, as in anchovies, sardines, herrings, haddock, etc., in this case the fish would be split down the front, not the back, and stitched together after boning. Joints of meat are usually prepared by the salesman, but are not difficult, merely requiring time, patience and care, so as not to cut or tear the flesh. The cavity is generally filled with forcemeat. Sometimes only portions of the bone are removed, rendering the joint more shapely or convenient to carve, or allowing the insertion of force- meat for purposes of seasoning.

92 PRINCIPLES OF PRACTICAL COOKERY. plentiful; and even in cases where it costs more to make than to buy many people prefer to have home-made jam. The fruit for jam making should be ripe, but not over- ripe or crushed, and it should be gathered in dry weather. The best kind of sugar is the most economical, as the common kinds make much more scum. Jars need careful overlooking before use, they must be free from cracks, clean and dry. Bright brass, aluminium or an enamel pan should be used, iron or tin-lined pans will discolour some fruits. A clear fire is needed; bright, but not fierce. If an open coal fire is used it is a necessary precaution to have all loose soot swept away from the back of the fire- place, and from the chimney as far as can be reached, before beginning jam making. The pan must not be set on a quite fiat surface of fire or the jam will be likely to burn, strong flames up the side of the pan must be avoided for the same reason. The proportion of sugar may vary somewhat according to the fruit usedâ€”a common rule is equal weights of each, but this is not always necessary. Too little sugar will result in fermenting jam, too much will cause candying in the jars. The jam maker must steer between these two points, and it must be remembered that too long con- tinued boiling may boil away so much liquid that the jam candies even though proportions were right at the beginning. It is important to remember also that it is the fruit, not the sugar, that requires cooking, and there are cases where it is wise to boil and skin the fruit before adding any sugar ; this is the invariable rule with jellies. There are three chief methods of boiling jam : (1) boiling the fruit before adding sugar ; (2) making a syrup and then boiling the fruit in it; (3) putting fruit and sugar in the pan together. Each method is good for

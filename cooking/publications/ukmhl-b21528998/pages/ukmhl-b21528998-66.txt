(50) STOCK. Stock is of various kinds, but we may now consider it as first and second. First stock is made of entirely fresh materials; second stock, of the same materials after the first stock has been strained. Stock materials are : meat or bones, according to the quality desired; carrot, turnip, onion, celery, parsley, herbs, salt and pepper. If the stock is required to have flavour of any special vegetable, increase the proportion of that one, but otherwise let them be fairly equal in quantity, remembering, however, that overmuch carrot tends to sweetness, while excess of turnip is liable to cause the stock to become sour. This last vegetable may be omitted altogether in very hot weather. The meat and bones should be cut or broken small to present as large a surface as possible to the action of the water which is to withdraw nutriment and flavour from them. All fat should be removed from bones and meat so as to avoid greasiness. The vegetables may be left in rather large pieces, as they are in the stock much longer than is needed for actual cooking, and if cut too small become powdered and may be too fine to remove by straining. The herbs, if dried ones, must be tied in a bit of muslin, as, being fine and powdery, they could not otherwise be perfectly strained out. To avoid a sediment forming, stock for high-class or clear soups is seasoned with pepper corns instead of grou,nd pepper.

52 PRINCIPLES OF PRACTICAL COOKERY. repeated, the original seasonings being quite exhausted. The amount of water need not be so carefully calculated, sufficient to cover the stock materials being enough, for it must be remembered that there is not so much nutri- ment or flavour to extract, although the longer cooking and the higher temperature that may safely be applied to second stock draws out the gelatine more freely. This accounts for the fact that second stock, which, we know, cannot be so good as the first, is, however, a much stiffer jelly when cold. To this stock may be added any bones or trimmings from cooked joints, remains of cooked vegetables, gravies or sauces, except those containing milk. Second stock can never be cleared perfectly; therefore, almost any food that is fresh and wholesome may be used for it without fear of spoiling. Stock made from beef, or chiefly from beef, is always more or less brown. If white is required, veal is the principal ingredient, and the flavour is improved by the addition of a ham bone and the carcases of poultry, game or rabbits. For cei'tain high-class soups the stock is made entirely from poultry. Whatever the materials used, the method never varies. The object being to extract the juices and nutriment, cold water must be applied and long cooking at a low temperature. Beef stock is usually made from shin of beef, the thicker and more fleshy part being used for the best, while the more bony and cheaper parts make good ordinary stock. Knuckle of veal is the part used for white stock. Fish stock is made from the bones, skin and trimmings of white fish. These are broken small and generally flavoured with onion, parsley, herbs and seasonings. The proportion of water used is rather larger, as the

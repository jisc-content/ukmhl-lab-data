i5 MARKETING. lean and fat intermixed; very lean meat is generally of inferior quality. The fat should be a pale straw colour; bright yellow fat often indicates that the~beast lias been fed on oil-cake, and though quite wholesome, the meat wastes in cooking, and is somewhat greasy and rich. If the whole beast is inspected, the condition of the tongue is a test. It should be plump, clean-skinned, and the fat at the root of a pinky-white tint. If it is dark, rough-skinned, with dead white fat, the meat is probably hard and tasteless. A line of gristle under the outer skin indicates an old beast, and the meat is generally tough. Mutton. —Flesh fine-grained and firm, rather paler than beef, and the fat whiter. Mutton with yellow fat, or from which much moisture” exudes, is not good. The finest mutton is four or five years old, but such is rarely met with. A general idea of the age of the animal may be gathered by inspecting the colour of the breast-bones, young sheep having pinky breast-bones, while after about four years they become white. Lamb is judged as mutton, but the lean is paler in colour. Yeal.—Flesh fine in grain and dry ; if moist and clammy, it is not fit for food. Fat white and firm; the lean a pale pink. Choose veal from small animals ; if large, they are apt to be coarse and tough. If any greenish or yellowish spots are to be seen, the meat is unfit for food. The fat round the kidneys should be firm and dry ; the kidneys large and well covered with fat; the liver clear—free from gristle or spots ; the sweetbread firm, plump, of a delicate colour and free from stringiness. Pork.—The lean should be pale pink, the fat white and clear, the skin thin, smooth and cool to the touch.

32 PRINCIPLES OF PRACTICAL COOKERY. saline, and are, therefore, not only a valuable, but an essential part of our diet, modifying a superfluity of animal food. Some contain starch, others albumen, a very few fat. Insufficient care in the preparation and cooking of vegetables has caused them to be regarded as unpalatable and unnecessary, while cost in some districts makes them somewhat a luxury. Vegetables are of such variety as to be difficult to classify. Those which we consider actual foods may be broadly divided into Root and Green, but these must be again divided, the Roots into roots proper, tubers, and bulbs ; the Green into stems, leaves, leaf stalks, flowers, seeds and seed vessels. All these should be used as fresh as possible. Roots, tubers and bulbs will keep during the winter if carefully protected from frost and damp, and when spring comes from so much warmth as will cause sprouting, as this makes the flavour coarse and strong, and in some cases renders the vegetable worthless. To keep well, they \ must be gathered when fully but not over-ripe, and should be quite sound and good. One decayed root will cause others to perish ; they should therefore be over- looked from time to time and the worthless ones re- moved. Bulbs keep best if hung by their stalks or in net bags exposed to dry, cool air, while tubers or roots are better stored on a brick floor covered with sand or sacking. These stored vegetables are good for flavouring, but are hardly fine enough to be presented as a vegetable course ; still when others are scarce they may be used for this purpose, extreme care being taken with their preparation. They should be carefully selected of uni- form size or they do not cook equally; the skin, which is liable to become hard and thick with keeping, perfectly

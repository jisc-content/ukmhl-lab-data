(28) PRESERVED FOODS. Perishable foods are kept for long periods after being “preserved” by various processes, the principal being drying, salting, or excluding air. Used at first for certain simple foods to give fresh and varied diet to travellers and sailors, the idea has been carried out to such an extent that there is now hardly any kind of food which cannot be preserved by some method. Some of these when preserved are not in any way inferior than when in a fresh state, and may be prepared by several methods, but the majority do not improve by the process, and although invaluable at times, would never be preferred to fresh foods. Some are comparatively useless to people on shore, or within reach of shops, and are also more costly than the fresh article, but as a substitute when this is out of season or reach, they are most valuable, while the fact that they may be kept in perfect condition for an indefinite time makes them a boon to house- keepers. There is an almost endless variety of preserved foods, by far the larger number being “canned” or “tinned,” and in dealing with these there are certain important points to remember. 1st. Meats are already overcooked—unavoidably so owing to the temperature required, to drive out the air which contains the putrefying agent, they therefore require nothing more than heating and seasoning.

74 principles oe practical cookery. must be cut into small pieces, so that the weight will not carry them to the bottom of the tin. The mixing together of the various ingredients must be very thorough before the whites are added. These come last, and must be very carefully handled. The object is to carry into the heavier mixture a quantity of air, which expands in heat, and so makes the souffle light. Great care must therefore be taken not to break down the froth and squeeze out the air, while at the same time mixing it thoroughly with the other substances. When the whites are mixed in the cooking must not be delayed ; pour into the prepared tin and set in the pan of boiling water, with the lid tightly secured and the temperature reduced to simmering. Cooking must be continued very steadily and without opening the pan for fully half the time allowed. Then, if there is any ques- tion as to the condition, the lid may be very slightly and carefully lifted at one side, and the souffle examined. If cooking too fast or too slow alter the position without jarring the pan or allowing an inrush of cold air, which at that stage might entirely spoil the souffle. If the recipe has been tried before and you can rely on its accuracy and arrange not to open the pan till the cooking is completed your chance of success is much greater. When you expect the souffle to be done, lift the lid and paper and touch the centre lightly with a teaspoon. If done it should have risen about half as high again as the raw mixture and feel slightly firm and dry in the middle. It should then be quickly and lightly lifted from the pan, the paper removed and the souffle turned on to a hot plate as quickly as possible, turned again into its original posi- tion, set on the dish for the table and served instantly. If placed on a very hot dish and covered at once with a

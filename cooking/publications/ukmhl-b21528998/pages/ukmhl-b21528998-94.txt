• GELATINE AND JELLY. (78) The essentials of good gelatine for cookery purposes are : (1) absolute tastelessness ; (2) uniformity of strength. Inferior gelatine has frequently both the taste and odour of glue, and although these stronger and coarser kinds are useful and even preferable for certain manufac- tures, nothing could be more objectionable as food. The gelatines prepared by different firms vary greatly in their power of stiffening liquids. It is wise, there- fore, to decide on some one good preparation and work with that only ; in no other way can we insure uniform results. The clearness of a jelly does not altogether decide the quality of the gelatine used, as inferior kinds often clear more easily than some of the finer kinds, but no gelatine can be considered good for cooking purposes unless it does clear perfectly. There are two principal kinds of gelatine, pipe or ribbon, and leaf gelatine. The pipe—sometimes known as packet gelatine, from the fact that it is frequently sold in ounce packets, is of varying thickness, and always requires steeping and softening in cold liquid before it is dissolved. After softening it should be gradually heated, being stirred all the time, brought to boiling-point and actually boiled for a few seconds in order to prevent the slight stickiness often observable in jellies that have been hastily made. All pipe gelatine should be strained after

There are many right ways of making bread, and plans found successful and convenient in large bakeries are not altogether adapted to private houses, and vice versa, but the same general principles apply in all cases. Yeast is a vegetable organism which lives and grows in the presence of suitable nourishment, moisture and moderate heat; extreme heat kills it. There are various kinds of yeast; what are known as home-made yeasts and leaven are seldom used where any other is easily procurable, as they are troublesome to keep in good condition and their results are uncertain. Brewers’ yeast, too, varies much in strength, but the best brands of dried and compressed German and French yeasts may be relied upon as having uniform results, and are therefore fast taking the place of other kinds for bread making. This yeast when good has a greyish colour and a fresh smell; if spots of brown are seen in it, or if the smell is unpleasant, it is not worth buying.

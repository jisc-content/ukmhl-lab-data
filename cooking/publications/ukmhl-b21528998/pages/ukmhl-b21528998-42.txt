26 PRINCIPLES OF PRACTICAL COOKERY. dissolving. When used for glazing it must be dissolved with a little stock or aspic jelly, and laid on with a brush in straight broad strokes ; avoid working the glaze, as this destroys its brightness and evenness of surface. For cold dishes one coat must be allowed to harden before another is laid on, and in order to secure a smooth and glossy surface the last coat of glaze should be poured instead of brushed over. Cheese.â€”The cheese most generally used in cookery is Parmesan. It is very hard and grates more finely and 11 readily than any other, besides being less oily when heated. It is sold ready grated, but is much more ex- pensive in this form, and frequently not so well flavoured i \as that bought in bulk and grated at leisure. It keeps ' good for a long time if closely corked and in a dry place, put damp always spoils cheese. The dry portions of 'almost any cheese may be grated and kept in the same way as Parmesan, even Gray ere, a very soft cheese, will, if dry, grate and keep for some time. In addition to stores prepared at home, a good cook ' or economical housekeeper will have the store-room stocked with such articles as are in constant request, remembering that a dish is easily spoilt by lack of one < ingredient, and substitutes are rarely satisfactory. There is no economy in substituting the wrong thing for the right one. A good well-stocked store-cupboard, or room is economical also when considered from another point, as it is always cheaper to buy in large quantities, and goods bought from small shops, a little at a time, are often of inferior quality. Paper is required for many purposes connected with cookery, and should be included in kitchen stores. What

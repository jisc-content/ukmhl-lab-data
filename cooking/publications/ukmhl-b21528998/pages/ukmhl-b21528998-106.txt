go PRINCIPLES OF PRACTICAL COOKERY. constantly used, or in large quantities, but in addition to the initial cost, the amount of salt and ice required to keep them charged for many hours is very considerable. The ice should be finely chopped to allow of it lying closely round the vessel containing the mixture and so keeping the temperature low and even, a condition not assured where the ice is in blocks of any size. A large needle or fine skewer is the best for breaking up the ice where there is no machine crusher used, and if tapped with a light wooden mallet will give no trouble. When crushed, the ice must be mixed with about one-third of its own weight of rough rock salt and then packed closely round the receiver in the freezing tub. The time required to freeze a cream varies very much, being greatly influenced by the temperature of the atmos- phere, as well as by the kind of machine. A machine which exposes a large surface of the cream to contact with the freezing mixture will always freeze more quickly than one where the cream is deep and thick, and of course a small quantity of cream will freeze much more quickly than a large amount. Therefore, never attempt to use any machine for a larger quantity than it is certified to contain. Everything required in the process should be ice cold before being brought together, and the work should be carried through in the coldest possible place. But even more important is accuracy in the proportion of materials, both in the mixture to be frozen and in the freezing mixture.

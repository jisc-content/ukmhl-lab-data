4 PRINCIPLES OF PRACTICAL COOKERY. Elaborate fancy tins are cleaned in the same way, but a wooden skewer also is necessary to clean the mouldings. Occasionally all such tins should be washed, great care being taken to dry them perfectly. Dripping and Baking Tins.—Fill quite full with water and a little soda and put to boil either over a gas jet or in the oven. If containing fat, pour it off, and wipe the hot tin with paper to absorb the greasiness before using water and soda. Wire Whisks.—Give special attention to the point where the handle joins the wires; mixtures containing gelatine, eggs, etc., are not always easily removed from crevices. Einse the whisk in boiling water, dry each wire with a cloth, then dry near a fire. Without this care the inner side of the wires will become rusty. Wire Frying Basket.—Wash with soda and hot water, then rinse in hot water without soda. Wipe well; but, as it is impossible to wipe between the wires, the drying must be completed in a cool oven or near a fire. Wire Broiler.—Do not wash a broiler. Clean well while hot with plenty of paper, then with a clean, dry dish-cloth. Keep a broiler where no dust can get to it, or washing, which is undesirable, will be necessary. PANS.—When choosing iron pans, it should be remembered they are sold both with and without a lining of tin. A good tin lining does not rust quite so soon as iron, and is less likely to discolour foods, such as milk, etc. The tin wash is of varying qualities. The cheaper kinds soon wear off, and if exposed to great heat melt and run down the sides of the pan, forming rough- nesses that are difficult, if not impossible, to clean perfectly. However good the quality of the tin lining, a

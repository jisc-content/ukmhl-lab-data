METHODS OF COOKING. 43 unsightly. Flat fish can be fairly well fried by this method, or, indeed, almost any thin substance, as thin edges are not affected in this way ; and for pancakes and other articles of similar nature it is the best method. It is rarely possible to use the fat from the dry method a second time except for dishes of the same kind, as the fat is always more or less flavoured by the food cooked in it. In wet frying, however, though the first outlay is greater, if properly used and kept the fat remains good as long as it remains at all, and much less is absorbed by or removed with the food. It must be carefully strained and removed from the pan after each time of using. Broiling, sometimes called grilling, is cooking by the direct action of fire brought almost into contact with the meat. The outer surface is burned or seared, the albumen hardened and the juices, which have a tendency to escape on the side turned from the heat, are retained in the meat by frequent turning. The fire for broiling must be very clear, intensely hot, and high in the grate. The utensil required for broiling is a gridiron, the bars of which are greased and heated to prevent sticking and subsequent tearing of the meat. The gridiron is laid quite close over the glowing coal, so that the lower surface is dried and hardened at once. The meat must be turned at very short intervals, before the juices have been driven from the fire to the opposite surface. If once allowed to reach the surface, they will be thrown off in turning and lost, the meat being correspondingly im- poverished. By constant turning the juices are kept moving backwards and forwards, and the meat remains moist and full of flavour. Each side should be exposed to the fire about three times, and it is not desirable to use meat less than 1 inch or more than 1\ to 2 inches thick

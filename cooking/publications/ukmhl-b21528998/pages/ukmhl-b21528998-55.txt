39 METHODS OF COOKING. will escape. The gravy will be greatly enriched in such a case, but the meat will suffer in proportion. Only the best quality of meat, and the tenderest joints, are suitable for roasting. Inferior meat or even the coarser joints of the best quality will not be satisfactory. A very im- portant point in connection with roasting meat is the basting, the constant pouring of hot fat, i.c., dripping from the joint, over the surface, not only assists in pre- venting the outward flow of juices, but also prevents the dry heat of the fire making the surface over-brown or cindery. A joint should be basted about every five minutes, but towards the end of the process rather less frequent basting is required. The joint should be placed quite close to the bars of the fire for the first ten or fifteen minutes ; after that first hardening it may be drawn slightly back and a steady temperature maintained till the end. The time allowed varies with the kind of meat and also with the different joints. Beef needs least time, then mutton, veal, and, lastly, pork. Thick pieces, such as rounds, legs, fillets, etc., must have a few minutesi longer per lb. allowed than ribs, shoulders, loins, etc.j Remembering these general rules, fifteen minutes per lb. will be the shortest and thirty minutes the longest time required; but in the case of beef individual taste must be consulted, so many people preferring beef under-done,! while the other three kinds are generally well cooked,/ pork, especially, being most unwholesome if not thoroughly cooked. For boiling and baking meat the same rules apply as for roasting, the time depending on joint and weight, the same time being allowed for similar joints.

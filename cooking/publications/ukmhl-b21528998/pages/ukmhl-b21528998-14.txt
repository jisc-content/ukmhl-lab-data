X INTRODUCTORY. arrive at a more satisfactory result with far less out- lay of money, time and temper. In the hope of helping some of my students and fellow-workers to achieve more easily and quickly this most desirable result, I have collected the points I have deemed most useful and important, and over which there is least controversy, and placed them in this condensed and portable form. Though not pro- fessing to have made any discoveries or to have anything new to say, I do hope that I may help to save some of the valuable time that often has to be spent in searching through a multitude of books for the somewhat varied information required by a student, professional or otherwise. It has always been a problem in the quite elementary stages of work, how to give a pupil such rules and guides as may prevent a too disheartening application of the experientia docet stultos principle. Teachers are not always at hand, and if they were, viva voce instruction is only one help where many are needed. The difficulty is to give the preliminary theoretical help in a systematic and connected form under the special heading to which it belongs. It is often necessary to do a large amount of more or less valuable reading before a practical point is reached, and then it is possibly one isolated fact, and the same process is needed to acquire each of the many helps required. It has been my intention to remove in part this difficulty, and I sincerely trust that some at least may consider that my effort has not been in vain.

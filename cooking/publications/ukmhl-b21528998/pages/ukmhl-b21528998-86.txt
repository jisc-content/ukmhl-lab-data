Pound Cakes.—As the name implies, the typical pound cake has equal weight of various ingredients, a pound to a pound of butter, sugar, eggs, flour, fruit, etc. Though this strict proportion is not always followed, a pound cake has always a considerable quantity of butter, eggs and sugar. The usual method of mixing is, therefore, to beat the butter and sugar to a cream, then add eggs and flour alternately, beating the mixture well between each addition. Last of all, the fruit and flavour- ing are put in. Much of the success of these cakes depends upon good beating, so as to blend ingre- dients and to enclose as much air as possible ; but it must be remembered that there is such a thing as over- beating eggs for cakes, though the other extreme is a more common fault. Pound cakes, if large, need very careful baking—a moderate and uniform heat of oven for a considerable time, then gradually decreasing heat is essential. Other things being equal, the smaller the cake the hotter the oven should be; but in no case do cakes require extremely gx-eat heat. 2. Plain Cakes. — These, containing as they do smaller proportion of butter and eggs, are generally mixed by rubbing the shortening into the flour, then (7°)

(13) MARKETING. Mabketing and economy are two words frequently found side by side, and rightly; but it is necessary that the real meaning of the word economy should be understood. Economy in marketing may be defined as receiving full value for the money spent. To exercise this true economy, we must purchase at the time things are in their best condition and season, and in exactly the quantities suitable. Perishable foods should be bought in the quantity re- quired for each dayâ€™s consumption, dry or tinned foods according to opportunities of storage. Flour, grains, sugar, dried fruits, etc., do not spoil if kept in a cool, dry place, and both these and tinned foods are generally cheaper when bought in quantities. All marketing is best done where there is a quick sale and constant renewing of the stock. In small or country shops things frequently remain long on hand and deteriorate. Fish and vegetables can scarcely be bought too fresh, though there are a few of both classes which take no harm if kept a little while. Poultry is best when quite fresh ; game must be kept some time to develop the flavour and make the flesh more tender. Mature meat, as beef and mutton, requires keeping in a cool, dry place for some days before cooking; but immature meat, as veal and lamb, should be cooked when freshly killed.

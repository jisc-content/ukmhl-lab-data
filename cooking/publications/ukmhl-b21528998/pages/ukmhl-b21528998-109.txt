93 JAM AND FRUIT JELLY. some purposes; in all cases steady boiling is required. Jars, after filling, may be covered while hot with paper brushed over with flour paste or other substances, or when cold with gummed paper or any material that will keep out the air. The old-fashioned plan of first a thin paper soaked in brandy laid on the jam, then a cover for the jar, or writing paper brushed over with white of egg, is good, but scarcely necessary. If jam is to keep well it must be stored in a cool, dry, airy place. Fruit Jellies.—The materials for jelly should be chosen in the same way as for jam, but a few points need special emphasis. There is in fruit a naturally gelatinous substance known as pectin, some fruits contain more than others, all fruits contain their greatest quantity at the time of maturity, and if left hanging on the trees this substance diminishes. As the “ setting ” of jelly depends largely upon the quantity of pectin, it is essential fruits should be gathered at the point of maturity—green fruits just before they begin to colour. Dampness or watery fruit dilutes the jelly-making substance, therefore the rule about gathering in dry and if possible in sunny weather. Cane sugar is desirable for all jam, but it is necessary for jellies. Beet sugar, though good for many purposes, contains more water than cane does, and refiners say it is impossible to do away with this difference. After sugar is added jelly must be boiled quickly, and, as soon as it sets, be taken from the fire at once.

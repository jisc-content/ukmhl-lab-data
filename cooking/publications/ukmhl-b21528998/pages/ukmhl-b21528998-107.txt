JAM AND FRUIT JELLY. Most fruits are Dot only fermentable, but contain in them- selves substances that can cause fermentation. The air in every place abounds with germs that cause decay, and all processes of preserving fruit are directed against the activity of these agents. What are known as bottled fruits are heated to prevent fermentation and then covered from the access of air. Though sugar in small quantities helps forward fermentation, a strong solution hinders it alto- gether, therefore sugar is much used in the preservation of fruit. By jam is generally meant fruit preserved by simply boiling with sugar, the fruit being more or less broken up in the process. When it is desired to keep it perfectly whole a syrup must first be made; this when boiling is poured over the fruit and left to cool; the syrup is then drawn off, again boiled and again poured over; this is repeated several times according to the kind of fruit in hand. The last process is the careful boiling up of the whole. Fruits preserved in this latter way may be removed from the syrup, dried, and crystallised in a syrup of about 35Â° by the saccharometer, but as the drying ought to be done at a fixed temperature and crystallisation needs special apparatus, these processes are rarely attempted at home as small quantities cannot be considered worth the outlay required. On the other hand, home-made jams are often a great economy, especially where and when fruit is (90

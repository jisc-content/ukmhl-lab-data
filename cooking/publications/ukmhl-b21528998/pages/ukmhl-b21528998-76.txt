If this precaution is not taken, either the skin must be taken off, which in- volves waste of material, or it must be broken down into the sauce, making it lumpy and rough, and necessitating passing through a sieve or tammy. If we consider sauces separately and by name, there is literally “no end ” to them. But they may all be classified under a few heads, plain and high-class together.

Boiling (of fresh meat).—This is cookery by im- mersion in boiling liquid, which after a few minutes is reduced to simmering. The object of the high tem- perature at first is to harden the surface albumen and so seal the pores and prevent the escape of the juices. If continued too long, this degree of heat would tend to toughen the joint throughout ; after the first few minutes, therefore, the heat must be reduced to about 180° Fah. The pan used for boiling meat should be only just large enough to hold the joint, and the quantity of liquid no more than is required to cover it. For the boiling of salt meat the general rule of first hardening the surface is not to be followed. The salting of meat withdraws a large proportion of its juices, while at the same time the salt hardens the fibres, and this hardness would be intensified by extreme heat. Very salt meat is sometimes steeped in cold water to extract some of the salt, but whether this is done or not, the rule for boiling salt meat is to immerse it in cold or tepid water and bring slowly to boiling-point; boil for about 5 mins, to seal the pores and prevent any further loss of juice, then reduce to 180° Fah., and maintain a uniform temperature till the meat is cooked. Salt meat takes longer to cook than fresh meat, and the saltness may be much qualified by boiling vegetables with the meat, turnips being especially useful for this purpose. Baking is cooking in close, dry heat, the air being rarely changed. It is the term generally applied to meat

42 PRINCIPLES OF PRACTICAL COOKERY. frying a large supply of fat is required, sufficient to com- pletely cover the article of food to be fried, but the fat should not much more than half fill the stew-pan in which it is placed. It should be slowly heated till of the right temperature. The heat of the fat before using is a most important point. Unless the heat be sufficient before the first plunge, the outside will not become crisp, and the food will be greasy. As a general rule, the correct heat for frying is known by a pale blue vapour rising from the surface of the fat, or it may be tested with a small piece of white bread, which should quickly acquire a golden colour if the fat is hot enough to use. The average temperature of fat for frying is about 380° Fah. For fish, 360° to 370° Fah. Meat, 380° Fah. Parsley, 400° Fah. Before frying in a bath of fat, food should be covered with some material that will harden instantly when heated, and so prevent the flavour or juice passing into the fat and the entrance of the fat into the food. The substances generally used for coating are either egg or batter, and instructions for the proper use of each will be found in another place. A great help, though not an essential for wet frying, is a frying basket to fit the pan, as by this the food can be removed quickly and without danger of breaking. A frying basket should always be made hot in the fat before any food is placed in it, as the cold basket would lower the temperature of the fat too much. The dry method of frying (sauter) is less satisfactory, in that it is difficult, even after much practice, to produce a uniformly coloured surface. A small quantity only of fat is needed, and where the fat, i.e., the heat, ends, a crack is formed in the outer coat, through which flavour escapes and fat enters; the appearance is also rendered

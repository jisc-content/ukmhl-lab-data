IOO PRINCIPLES OF PRACTICAL COOKERY. sponding points at the other side. Tie the ends of the legs and the tail together firmly, or pass a skewer through the thick sinew at the back of the leg close to the joint, then through the thin shell-like bone of the body and out at the other side. Either method is correct, the latter often keeps the bird a better shape. Boiled Fowls.—After drawing the sinews, cut off the ends of broken bone. Loosen the skin from the legs and body that the legs may be pushed up inside the skin of the body. Tie the legs to the tail underneath the skin, draw the skin smoothly over and stitch neatly. Truss as for roasting, but use a trussing needle and string instead of a skewer so that the fowl may be folded in a buttered cloth. Ducks, Geese, etc.—These do not usually have the sinews removed as the feet are left on after being well scalded and scraped. There is, however, no reason why the sinews should not be drawn, and it would probably render the flesh much more tender and palatable, but it is not customary. The wings are folded as for fowls, the foot and leg are twisted round towards the body so that the foot lies on the back of the bird and the leg is kept in position by a skewer used as for fowls. Game, either for roasting or boiling, is trussed as roast fowl with a few small points of difference. The head is sometimes left on, drawn to the side and fastened with the same skewer as the wings. In pheasants the tail feathers are sometimes replaced after cooking, but it is a fashion that is quickly dying out. Quails, snipe, etc., are generally trussed on their own long bills and when this is done the greatest care must be taken to thoroughly cleanse the bill inside and out. Very small birds have the point of the wing removed with the feathers, it being

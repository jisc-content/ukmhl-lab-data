62 PRINCIPLES OF PRACTICAL COOKERY. It is a common mistake to imagine that meat once cooked needs only to be heated. Having lost a great deal of its juices in the first cooking, when re-heated in good well-flavoured stock or gravy considerable time is re- quired to blend the flavour. If plenty of time is not given to the process, the flavour of the meat will be quite distinct from that of the gravy, and in all probability the former will be hard and tough. Long, gentle simmering is as necessary for cold meat as for fresh. Hash (by which we understand meat in slices or small pieces, say half-inch cubes, cooked in a good gravy, with garnish of vegetables, rice or sippets, etc.) should be prepared from the best remaining parts of a joint; while mince, being cut much finer, may be prepared from the smaller and less sightly parts, these also being quite suitable for mincing with a machine for rissoles, pates, etc., where the meat is required to be almost a paste. Mince, of whatever kind of meat, should always be chopped with knife or chopper, a machine generally makes it too nearly into a paste, which, when heated, presents a greasy appearance that is most uninviting. In all cases special care must be taken to use seasonings and flavourings suitable to the flavour of the particular meat used. Having lost much of the colouring substance during the first cooking, this must be supplied in the “ made dishes,” and for this we have frequently recourse to caramel. If, however, a thick sauce or gravy is required, the flour for the thickening may be coloured by browning or frying. Where onion is admitted as a flavourer, browning it first will greatly help to give colour to the dish, caramel supplementing when necessary; while the best of all colourings is the dark, rich jelly frequently found under the c&ke of dripping poured from a joint.

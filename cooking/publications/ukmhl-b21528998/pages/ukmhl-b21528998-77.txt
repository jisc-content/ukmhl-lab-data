(61) COLD MEAT COOKERY. Cold meat is by most people objected to as unappetising and not easily digested. The re-heating, however, re- quires much more care than is generally given to it, and the want of this care frequently results in unpalatable hashes and stews to which cold meat would be infinitely preferable. The method of successfully re-heating depends greatly on the condition of the meat; stewing, which requires long, slow cooking, being quite unsuitable for meat already overcooked, while frying, a quick method, would be equally unsuited to the more underdone parts. All gristle, skin and fat that will not be eaten should be removed when preparing the meat for / re-heating, as there is no economy in serving these things, and the dish will be spoiled by their presence. When beef, veal, chicken, etc., are no longer to be served in their original form, the usable parts should be cut into pieces and trimmed carefully, the bones, gristle and any overcooked edges being placed with a little vegetable, herbs and seasoning in a pan with cold water and simmered gently to extract all flavour and furnish a supply of stock for gravy, etc. Scraps of mutton or pork yield more disagreeable odour than any- ( thing else; therefore for these meats the above method \ is not to be recommended, either gravy or good ordinary \ stock should be used instead.

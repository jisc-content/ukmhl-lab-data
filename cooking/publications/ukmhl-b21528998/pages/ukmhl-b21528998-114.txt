g8 PRINCIPLES OF PRACTICAL COOKERY. Drawing.—When the bird is singed proceed to draw it or empty the body. Cut off the head about two or three inches from the body and split the skin on the back of the neck for those two or three inches, or until the back- bone is reached. Loosen the skin and remove the piece of neck wrhere it joins the backbone, and you will have left a flap of loose skin which will cover the aperture. Take out the crop, which will be found in the front of the neck. Insert one or two fingers at the triangular hole at the neck, and keeping them close to the inside of the bones of the body carefully break and loosen all the threads and integuments which attach the internal organs to the frame. Turn the bird and at the tail make a small cut across just between the tail and the vent. Keep this incision as small as possible or the bird will be unsightly and torn. Insert the fingers at this cut and loosen the remainder of the inside in the same way as from the neck, taking great care not to tear or break anything inside. When all is free, with two fingers take hold of the gizzard, the large hard portion of the interior, and care- fully draw out the whole contents of the body. If this is roughly or carelessly done the gall bladder may break and an unpleasant bitter taste will be imparted to the flesh. When quite empty wipe out the fowl with a clean damp cloth. Trussing.—Break the bone of the leg half way between the foot and the next joint. Twist the foot round till the skin gives way at the break ; this will expose the white glittering sinews which are to be taken up one at a time with a skewer and drawn out of the body. To draw the sinews successfully the legs and feet of the bird must be quite perfect. If the claws have been cut the sinews are

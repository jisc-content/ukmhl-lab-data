CHOICE, CARE AND CLEANING OF UTENSILS. 3 used for jelly or clear soup cannot be greasy, no soda is required. Wash the bag, still wrong side out, till the water remains quite clear, then wring tightly. If possible, wring through a wringing machine and dry in the open air. Tammy Cloths.—These, being chiefly used for sauces, etc., containing some amount of butter, must be washed in soda and water; use no soap, wring tightly and shake well. Dry in the open air if possible. Metal Jelly Moulds.—After use these should be washed in warm water, avoiding the use of soda. The outside should be brightly polished, but the inside simply washed; any polishing material could not be entirely removed from the crevices inside an elaborate mould, also the rubbing necessary for polishing would wear away the lining of tin, which in copper moulds it is of great im- portance to keep perfect. If, after long usage, a copper mould shows signs of the tin lining wearing, the mould should be re-tinned. Jelly moulds should be used for cold mixtures only. Pudding Moulds.—If these cannot be washed im- mediately the pudding is turned out, let them soak in hot water without soda. Every crevice of the moulding must be cleaned, if necessary, with a wooden skewer. An iron one should not be used, as it might scratch and cause roughness, or possibly even pierce a thin part of the metal and render the tin useless. After washing, dry near a fire before putting away. Cake Tins.—Plain cake tins and patty pans do not need constant washing. Clean them while still hot, first with paper, to remove all grease, then finish with a dish- cloth, dry or tightly-wrung out of hot water. If a damp dish-cloth is used, dry the tins also by the fire.

CREAMS. 85 ness, while if hot it may cause the cream to curdle. The gelatine too must be allowed to cool considerably after dissolving before being added to either custard or cream. It is not always stated in recipes that cream is to be whipped, but there are very few cases in which it is not better whipped than plain. Care must, however, be taken not to over-whip it, as that will result in its separating into two parts, neither of which will improve the dish. It will generally be found best to pour the thinner materials on to the whipped cream. Being so light and yet solid it does not easily mix with more liquid substances, and yet perfect mixing is essential. It may be taken as a rule that the thinner materials should be very gradually poured on to the more solid and the whole worked smooth by degrees. This mixing must be done before the gelatine begins to solidify or it will be lumpy. After thorough mixing the whole should be stirred from time to time until the first sign of stiffening, when it is ready for moulding. In cases where solid substances, as fruit, etc., are incorporated in the cream the solidifying must be more advanced before moulding, the pieces must be sus- pended and upheld by the stiffness of the mixture or they will sink in the mould, and on turning out will be found in a cake on the top. For the same reason all fruit should be cut in very small pieces, or its weight will cause it to fall. Moulds for jellies and creams require care both in their selection and preparation. Mixtures containing acids or fruit juices should be moulded in delf. Metal moulds frequently cause discoloration and sometimes impart a disagreeable flavour to such substances. As delf moulds are of unequal thickness, it is impossible to turn out the contents in perfect condition by applying external heat to

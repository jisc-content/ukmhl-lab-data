PUDDINGS. SECTION XIV.—PUDDINGS. l.-PUDDINGS. When you boil your puddings take particular care that your cloth be clean, and remember to dip it in boiling water; flour it well and give it a shake before you put your pudding into it. If it be a bread pudding, tie it loose, but tie it tight if it be a batter pudding. If you boil it in a basin, butter the basin and boil the pudding in plenty of water. Turn it often and do not cover the pan; when it is done enough take it up in the basin and let it stand a few minutes to cool. Then untie the string, wrap the cloth round the basin, lay your dish over it, and turn the pudding out. 2—BEEF-STEAK PUDDING. Ingredients. Quantities. Method.

METHODS OF COOKING. ROASTING. "DOASTING is the simplest and most generally adopted ■** way of cooking fresh meat; it may be done in the oven, or before the fire on a spit, or suspended from a bottle-jack—most people prefer this method, as tending less to deteriorate the flavour of the meat. For a large joint the fire should be strong and even ; for a smaller joint it should be brisk—in either case the length of the fire should be a little longer than that of the meat, so that the ends of the joint may be roasted equally with the centre. Large joints are improved if they are allowed to lie in the dripping pan near the fire until warmed through, before they are hung up to roast. Great care must be used in roasting meat on a spit not to run this through the best part of the joint, as the gravy escapes by the holes made by the spit— the same remark holds good with skewers: string should be used as much as possible instead of skewers, to prevent the loss of gravy. The time generally allowed for roasting is a quarter of an hour to each pound of meat, and the joint is tender in proportion with the slowness of the roasting. There are, however, some points to be noted with regard to time that should be remembered; fresh meat takes longer to roast than does meat that has been hung for some time; young meat requires less cooking than that of older animals; and fat meat takes longer than lean meat, which should be covered with buttered paper before roasting, to prevent burning and dryness. Small—and especially thin—joints may be put down to a

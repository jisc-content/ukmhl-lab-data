xiii METHODS OF COOKING. covered with the fat, they are fried on both sides at once, and do not require turning, or any handling or touching, until they are removed from the basket. Butter, oil, lard, dripping, and clarified suet are all used for frying; of these, lard, dripping, and clarified suet are most used in general cooking. Olive oil answers extremely well for frying fish, and, if strained and carefully kept, can be used several times. Fat, also, may be used more than once for meat, if carefully strained and kept quite fresh. Butter is generally used only in frying vegetables for stews, when it forms part of the gravy, and for light and delicate dishes. No fat that has been used for one kind of food should ever be used for any other kind, as it invariably con- tracts the flavour of the articles fried in it. To test the heat of the boiling fat wait till it has left off bubbling, then dip your finger in water and shake it over the pan; if the fat crackles and sputters the heat is right, and the articles can be put in. The fat used must be per- fectly fresh, clean, and free from salt, otherwise the food will be spoilt in flavour and colour. All fried food must be carefully drained before it is sent to table; it should be so dry that it scarcely leaves a trace of grease on the cloth or paper on which it is served. Omelets should be fried in a special enamelled pan kept for the purpose, and never used for any other kind of food. The butter in which they are fried must be boiling hot, but not brown, or it will spoil the colour of the omelet. BROILING. The success of broiling depends almost entirely on the brightness and clearness of the fire: there should be a steady glow at the top, without smoke or flames. Much

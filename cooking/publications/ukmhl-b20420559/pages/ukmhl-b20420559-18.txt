MYRA'S COOKERY BOOK. xii heat, which need not be great for simmering, should be even and uninterrupted. In boiling poultry or white meats, a piece of bread with- out crust, and a little butter or beef suet, may be added to the water to soften it, and to keep the colour and improve the flavour of the joint. STEAMING. Steaming is often preferred to boiling for some kinds of food, such as potatoes, rice, vegetables, macaroni, fish, and sweet puddings. The steamer fits into the top of a sauce- pan made for the purpose, and any article that has no strong flavour may be boiled in the water contained in the sauce- pan, and which provides the steam for the steamer. The food to be steamed is prepared as for boiling, and the lid of the saucepan must be firmly closed to prevent the escape of the steam. Steaming is an excellent way of warming cold puddings and meat, as it entirely preserves their original flavour. FRYING. There are two chief points on which the success of fry- ing depends ; one is to have a sufficiency of fat to cover the articles to be fried, and the other is to have this boiling before anything is put into it. No food can be properly fried in a thin layer of warm grease ; there must be plenty of it, and it must be at the right degree of heat. A deep pan is therefore necessary for frying any but very flat objects, such as soles; and an admirable plan is to put the articles to be fried into a kind of wire-work basket, which is dipped into the pan of boiling fat, and then taken out with the fried articles in it when these are cooked.

xv METHODS OF COOKING. with the seasoning and other ingredients, the lid is put on and the stewpan is placed where it will have slow but well- regulated heat, until it is ready to serve. The regulation of the heat is an important point in all stews, as the flavour of the dish depends almost entirely on the care that is taken to keep it steady and even, never too fast nor too slow, for an error in either direction will destroy the flavour, and either harden the meat or leave it insufficiently cooked. Once fairly started a stew should be interfered with as little as possible ; even raising the lid checks the process of cooking, and the fragrant steam that escapes is so much lost from the flavour. Good stock or gravy is absolutely necessary to make a rich and well flavoured stew; water or thin stock can only be used for Irish stews and similar homely family dishes. Stewing is the most economical process in cooking, as nothing is put into a stew that is not eaten, unless it is perhaps the bunch of parsley and herbs put in to flavour the gravy. No method of cooking is more easy, yet none is so often a failure, chiefly because the gravy is too thin and flavourless, and the stew is allowed to boil at a gallop, when it should simmer very gently. When cold meat is to be served as a stew, the gravy must be first made and simmered with the vegetables, seasoning, flavouring, etc., until it is of the right consist- ence ; any thickening it requires should be put in at the very first stage; the addition of flour towards the end of the cooking should be avoided as much as possible, as it does not mix well, and often gives the gravy a raw flavour. If it is necessary to thicken the gravy a little more, this should be done by adding a little butter kneaded with flour, or a little prepared white or brown roux. The gravy when thoroughly cooked is strained, if necessary, into another saucepan, and the meat, cut in neat slices and perfectly

248 MYRA'S COOKERY BOOK. REMARKS ON OMELETS. The number of eggs used for an omelet should never exceed twelve, as a thick omelet is far less delicate than a smaller one. The omelet pan must be perfectly clean and never used for any other purpose. The eggs are best when beaten with a fork, but they should not be beaten for more than a minute or two, otherwise they become thin, and do not set well. Omelets are much lighter if a few small pieces of butter are beaten up with the eggs, or added to the beaten eggs immediately before frying. The butter in the pan must be quite hot, but not coloured, before the eggs are put in. All kinds of vegetables, cold meat, poultry, game, fish, macaroni, etc.; can be added to omelets to flavour them; they must first be broken or cut in small pieces and lightly fried in butter, 21.-EGG CHEESE, or fondue.

MYRA'S COOKERY BOOK. 134 SECTION VII.—PORK. l.-ROAST SUCKING PIG. Order. 12. 13- Ingredients. Quantities. Sucking pig... Sageandonion stuffing Flour Good gravy ... Lemon juice.. Bread, apple or tomato sauce £ or i pint Very little A few drops Method. Well clean. Stuff (if veal forcemeat is preferred, stuff with that). Sew it up with strong thread. Truss it like a hare with its fore-legs skewered back, and its hind-legs forward. Dry it well. Dredge over it. Set it before a clear fire. Baste it with butter till there is enough of its own gravy. When it is done, cut off the head, split it in halves, divide the pig with a very sharp knife down the centre, lay the backs together, put the ears on each side, and the halves of the head at each end of the dish. Pour over. Squeeze over. Send some of the same gravy to table in a sauce-boat. May be eaten with it at will.

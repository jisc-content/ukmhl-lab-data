Oranges Sugar Peel them, and take off as much of the white skin as possible, without breaking it. Divide them in quarters. Pass a needle and cotton through the thick white centre of each quarter, and tie it in a loop. Hang them all by the loops on wire hooks shaped like an S, and hang the hooks by the upper part on a string stretched from wall to wall. Boil on a quick fire until it bubbles and has slightly turned colour, but see that it does not go beyond this point. Take each hook by the top, and dip the orange in the boiling sugar. Take it out immediately, and hang it up on the string. Dip in each quarter separately, till all are done. Let them hang till dry. Serve at dessert.

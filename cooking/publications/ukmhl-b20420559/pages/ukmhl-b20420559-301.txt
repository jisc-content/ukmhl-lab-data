275 PASTRY. SECTION XIII.—PASTRY. ON MAKING PASTRY. As the heat of your oven must be regulated by what you intend to bake, the following rules should be carefully attended to:— 1. Light paste requires a moderate oven, but not too slow, as that will deprive it of the light appearance it should have, and too quick an oven will catch and burn it, without giving it time to rise. 2. Tarts that are iced require a slow oven, or the ice will be brown before the paste is properly baked. 3. Raised pies must have a quick oven, and be well closed up, or the pie will fall in at the sides; and it should have no water put in till just before you put it in the oven, or the crust will look sodden. l.-CRISP PASTE FOR TARTS. 1. Mix 1 oz. of loaf sugar beaten and sifted, with 1 lb. of fine flour, £uid make into a stiff paste with a gill of boiling cream or milk. 2. Work 3 oz. of butter into it. 3. Roll it very thin and make your tarts or pie-crust. 4. Ice your paste by beating the white of an egg a little, and rubbing it over the paste with a feather. 2.-RICH PUFF PASTE. 1. Rub a pound of butter very fine into a quarter of a peck of flour. 2. Make it into a light paste with cold water, just stiff enough to work it. 3. Roll it out to the thickness of a five-shilling piece, and put a layer of butter all over it. 4. Sprinkle on a little flour, double it up, and roll it out again. 5. Double it and roll it out seven or eight times, when it will be fit for all sorts of pies and tarts that require a puff paste. 3.-LIGHT PASTE FOR TARTS. 1. Beat the white of an egg to a strong froth, and mix it with as much water as will make f lb. of flour into a tolerably stiff paste. 2. Roll it out very thin; lay 3 oz. of butter in thin pieces upon it and dredge it with a little more flour. 3. Roll it up tight, then roll it out again, and continue until J lb. each of butter and flour be used. 4. Cut it into square pieces, and make your tarts. This will require a quicker oven than crisp paste. t 2

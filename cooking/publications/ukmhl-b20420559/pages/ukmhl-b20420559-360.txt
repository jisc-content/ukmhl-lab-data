334 MYRA'S COOKERY BOOK, JELLY FOR COLD MEATSâ€”(continued). Order. Ingredients. Quantities. Method. Salt Whites of eggs' 2 Vinegar and water Cold water ... A little Add if needed. Skim carefully as the scum rises. Beat up with a little water. Stir the boiling jelly vigorously with one hand, and pour in the whites of egg quickly with the other. Dip a clean white cloth in, and fasten it by the corners over a basin. Add when the jelly boils up again. When the whites of eggs are well incorporated pour the jelly slowly through the cloth. Strain 2 or 3 times, if necessary, until the jelly is quite clear. Let it get cold and serve it cut in blocks with boned turkey, or other cold meats. 17.-ASPIC FOR POULTRY. This is made in the same way as the preceding, with the addition of a little more lemon juice. While the jelly is still liquid, truffles, mush- rooms fried in butter, and preserved gherkins are arranged in layers in it, the jelly being allowed to get firm between the layers. 18.-TO CLARIFY JELLY. Simmer the calfs' feet gently for several hours, strain the liquor through a sieve and let it get cold. When cold take off the fat and put the jelly back on the fire, adding to it the strained juice of one lemon ; take off the scum when the jelly begins to boil. Beat up the whites of two or three eggs in a basin with a little water, take the jelly off the fire, stir it quickly with one hand and with the other pour in the beaten whites of egg very suddenly. Put the saucepan back on the fire at once and the moment it begins to boil pour in a glass of cold water and let it boil up again. Strain it at once through the jelly bag, and repeat this two or three times if necessary. If the jelly is not required immediately let it simmer gently on a slow fire, until it is sufficiently reduced without boiling, then pour it into an earthen jar and keep it in a cool place. It will keep good for some time.

When well mixed and smooth, form into oblong balls with the spoon. Sprinkle on the board and roll the quenelles in. Have ready a large saucepan full. Throw in the quenelles one by one and boil for 3 minutes. Take them out and drain them. Serve in mock-turtle soup or alone with rich gravy, or dip in egg and bread crumbs and fry as croquettes. Note.—Quenelles are also made of remains of cold fowl, game, or fish, and butter can be used in place of veal fat. In poaching quenelles it is well to cook one first to see that the mixture is of the right consistence. It should be light and yet firm; if it is too heavy add the beaten white of an egg, if, on the contrary, it swells in the water and is limp when taken out, add a little milk to the mixture before poaching any more. 52-CALF'S LIVER FORCEMEAT.

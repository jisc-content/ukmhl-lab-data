BREADSTUFFS AND CEREALS. Ill Ash Cake.,—Same kind of dough. Form it into balls as big as hen’s eggs, roll in dry flour, lay in hot ashes, and cover completely with them. Corn Bread (Superior).— 1 pint corn meal, 1 pint flour, 3 tablespoonfuls sugar, 2 heaped tablespoonfuls butter, 3 teaspoonfuls baking powder, 1 teaspoonful salt, 2 eggs, 1 pint (or more) milk. Rub butter and sugar together. Add the beaten eggs; then the milk. Sift the salt and baking powder into the meal and flour. Pour the liquid over the dry ingredients, beating well. Pour bat- ter into well-greased pan, and bake thirty to forty minutes in moderately hot oven. Can also be made into muffins. Cor\i Batter Bread.— 1 pint corn meal, 2 pints milk (or water), 2 eggs, 1 teaspoonful salt. Beat the eggs light; add the salt; then the meal and milk, gradually, until well blended. Bake about thirty minutes. This is the standard break- fast bread of the South, easily made, and (if the meal is freshly ground) delicious. A little boiled rice, or hominy grits, may be substituted for part of the meal. Snow Bread.—After a fall of light, feathery snow, superior corn bread may be made by stirring together 1 quart corn meal, yz teaspoonful soda, 1 teaspoonful salt, 1 tablespoonful lard.

5 PROVISIONS. Flour.—The plain kind is best. The self-rais- ing is easily ruined by moisture, and will not do for thickening, dredging, etc. Corn Meal— Some like yellow, some prefer white. In either case it is much the best when . freshly ground. A welcome change from hot wheat bread or biscuit, and can be served variously as johnny cake, pancakes, or mush. Useful to roll fish in, before frying. Rolled Oats.—This, and other breakfast cereals, according to taste, and only for variety sake. Nu- tritive value low, in proportion to bulk. Rice.—Deserves a higher place as an all-round food than our people generally give it. Beats all other cereals in sustaining power plus digestibility. Can be cooked in many ways, and all of them are easy. Combines well with almost anything else, and so lends variety. Packs well and keeps well. Macaroni.—Nutritious, but bulky. Good in soups and stews. Break it into inch pieces and pack so that insects cannot get at it. Baking Poivder.—Get the best, made with pure cream of tartar. It costs more than the alum pow- ders, and does not go so far, bulk for bulk; but it is much kinder to the stomach. Baking soda will probably not be wanted, as it requires butter- milk in baking, except for sour-dough. Occa- sionally needed for other purposes. Salt Pork (alias middlings, sides, bellies. Old Ned, et al.).—Commendable or accursed, according to how it is used. Takes the place of lard and butter on very light marching trips. Nothing quite equals it in baking beans. Savory in some boiled dishes. When fried, as a piece de resistance, it successfully resists most people’s gastric juices,

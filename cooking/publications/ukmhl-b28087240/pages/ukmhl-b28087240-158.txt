CAMP COOKERY. 136 arate vessel. If tea is left steeping more than five or six minutes the result is a liquor that will tan skin into leather. To boil tea is—well, it is like watering a rare vintage. You know what the old Colonel said: “My friend, if you put water in that wine. God’ll never forgive you!” Chocolate.—For each quart of boiling water scrape up four tablespoonfuls of chocolate. Boil until dissolved. Then add half a pint milk. Stir with a peeled stick until milk has boiled up once. Let each man sweeten his own cup. DESSERTS. Dried Fruit.—Evaporated or dried apples, apri- cots, peaches, prunes, etc., are misprized, under- rated, by most people from not knowing how to prepare them. The common way is to put the fruit on to stew without previous soaking, and then boil from one-half hour to two hours until it is more or less pulpy. It is then flat and insipid, besides unattractive to the eye. There is a much better way. Soak the fruit at least over night, in clear cold wrater—just enough to cover. If time permits, soak it from twenty-four to thirty-six hours. This restores the fruit to its original size and flavor. It is good to eat, then, without cooking. To stew, merely simmer gently a few minutes in the water in which the fruit was soaked. This water carries much of the fruit’s flavor, and is invaluable for sauce. California prunes prepared in this way need no sugar. Dried apples and peaches have none of the rank taste by which they are unfavorably known, but resemble the canned fruit. Apricots properly soaked are especially good.

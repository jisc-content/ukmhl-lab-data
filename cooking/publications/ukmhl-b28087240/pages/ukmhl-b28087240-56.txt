CAMP COOKERY. S4> loblolly pines make quick fires but are soon spent. The gray (Labrador) pine is considered good fuel in the far North, where hardwoods are scarce. Seasoned tamarack is fairly good. Spruce is poor fuel, although, being resinous, it kindles easily and makes a good blaze for “branding up” a fire. Pitch pine, which is the most inflammable of all woods when dry and “fat,” will scarcely burn at all in a green state. Sycamore and buckeye, when thoroughly seasoned, are good fuel, but will not split. Alder burns readily and gives out con- siderable heat, but is not lasting. The wood of the large-toothed aspen will not burn when green, yet when dry it burns freely, does not crackle, lasts well, and leaves good coals. The best green softwoods for fuel are white birch, paper birch, soft maple, cottonwood, and quaking aspen. As a rule, the timber growing along the mar- gins of large streams is softwood. Hence drift- wood is generally a poor mainstay, unless there is plenty of it on the spot. The best kindling is fat pine, or the bark of the paper birch. Fat pine is found in the stumps and butt cuts of pine trees that died on the stump. The resin has collected there and dried. This wood is usually easy to split. Pine knots are the tough, heavy, resinous stubs of limbs that are found on dead pine trees. They, as well as fat pine, are almost imperishable, and those stick- ing out of old rotten logs are as good as any. The knots of balsam fir are similarly used. Hem- lock knots are worthless and will ruin an axe. The thick bark of hemlock, and of hardwoods generally, is good to make glowing coals in a hurry. In a hardwood forest the best kindling, sure to

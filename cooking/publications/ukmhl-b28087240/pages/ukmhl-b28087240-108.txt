Leave it there ten to twenty minutes, depending upon size. The newspaper will scorch, but the in- ner wrappers will not. The result is a dish fit for Olympus. (Up De Graff.) Small fish can be steamed in wet basswood leaves, or other large leaves, without buttering. For another method of steaming, see page 60. Fish, Boiled.—None but fish of good size should be boiled. If the fish is started in cold water and not allowed to boil hard, it will be less likely to fall apart, but the flavor will not be so good. It is better to wrap the fish in a clean cloth and drop it into boiling water well salted. A tablespoonful of vinegar, or the juice of a lemon, improves the dish. Leave the head on, but remove the fins. Boil very gently until the flesh will easily part from the bones. Time depends on species; from eight to ten minutes per pound for thick fish, and five minutes for small ones. Boiled fish require considerable seasoning and a rich sauce, or at least melted butter, to accompany them. Besides vinegar or lemon, onions, carrots, cloves, etc., may be used in the water. Recipes for sauces follow. (See also pages 63 and 80.) Butter Sauce.— 2 heaped tablespoonfuls butter. 1 heaped tablespoonful flour. 1 teaspoonful salt. ys teaspoonful pepper. Put the butter in a cold pan, and rub into it the flour, salt, and pepper, beating well. Then pour on a scant half-pint boiling wrater. Cook two min- utes. Use immediately.

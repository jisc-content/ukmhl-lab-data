89 FISH AND SHELLFISH. Eel, Broiled.—Skin, clean well with salt to re- move slime, slit down the back and remove bone, cut into good-sized pieces, rub inside with egg, if you have it, roll in corn meal or dry bread- crumbs, season with pepper and salt, and broil to a nice brown. Some like a dash of nutmeg with the seasoning. Eel, Stewed.—Skin the eel, remove backbone, and cut the eel into pieces about two inches long; cover these with water in the stew-pan, and add a teaspoonful of strong vinegar or a slice of lemon, cover stew-pan and boil moderately one half hour. Then remove, pour off water, drain, add fresh water and vinegar as before, and stew until tender. Now drain, add cream enough for a stew, season with pepper and salt (no butter), boil again for a few minutes, and serve on hot, dry toast. (Up De Graff.) Fish Roe.—Parboil (merely simmer) fifteen minutes; let them cool and drain; then roll in flour, and fry. MISCELLANEOUS.

To grill: Prepare three tablespoonfuls melted butter, one-half teaspoonful salt, and a pinch or two of pepper, into which dip the frog legs, then roll in fresh bread crumbs, and broil for three minutes on each side,

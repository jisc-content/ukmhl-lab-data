♦ ' 4 CAMP COOKERY. sugar, and coffee—our guns and rods furnish us variety.” This sounds sturdy, but there is a deal of humbug in it. A spell of bad weather may de- feat the best of hunters and fishermen. Even granting that luck is good, the kill is likely to be of one kind at a time. With only the six articles named, nobody can serve the same game in a va- riety of ways. Now, consider a moment. How would you like to sit down to nothing but fried chicken and biscuit, three times a day? Chicken everlastingly fried in pork grease—and, if you tire of that, well, eat fried “sow-belly,” and sop your bread in the grease! It is just the same with trout or bass as it is with chicken; the same with pheasant or duck, rabbit or squirrel or bear. The only kind of wild meat that civilized man can relish for three consecutive meals, served in the same fashion, is venison of the deer family. Go pre- pared to lend variety to your menu. Food that palls is bad food—worse in camp than anywhere else, for you can’t escape to a restaurant. Variety of rations does not mean adding to the load. It means substituting three 5 lb. parcels for one 15 lb. parcel, and no more. Let us consider the material of field rations, item by item: Bread.—It may be well to carry enough yeast bread for two or three days. It helps out until the game country is reached and camp routine is established. Hardtack (pilot bread, ship bis- cuit) is a last resort, and can be recommended only for such trips or cruises as do not permit baking. It is a cracker prepared without salt or grease, and kiln-dried to a chip, so as to keep well. He who can eat it without grumbling may be said to have filed his teeth.

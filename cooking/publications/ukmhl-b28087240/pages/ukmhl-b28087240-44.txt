CAMP COOKERY. 22 Bail ears should project as little as possible. Lids should have fold-down rings instead of knobs. If the bails interfere with nesting, substitute light chains. Ordinary coffee pots are too tall and slender. The best form is what is known as a coffee boiler (see illustration), which nests inside a com- paratively small pail, boils quickly, has a bail, Cooking Kit for Six. Nesting in space 11x12% inches, and weighing 17% lbs. and is fitted with a solid spout that will not melt off. A similar article of tin is known as a “miner’s coffee pot.” When compact nesting is aimed at, discard the coffee pot in favor of a lidded pail. It has the advantage that no aroma escapes through a spout. Use a percolator of aluminum (cylindrical, not egg-shaped) that is large enough for both coffee and tea, and remove its wings. Tin cups that nest inside the coffee pot have the lower part of the handle free. Get the 1^- pint size (5x2%$ in.). Small cups and small plates are a nuisance in camp.

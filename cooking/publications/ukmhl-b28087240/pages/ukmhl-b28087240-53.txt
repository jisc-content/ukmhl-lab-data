31 FIRES. stick. Now cut three or four green crotches from branches, drive a nail in the small end of each, invert the crotches, and hang them on the lug- pole to - suspend kettles from. These pot-hooks are to bd of different lengths so that the kettle can be adjusted to different heights above the fire, first foi* hard boiling, and then for simmering. If kettles'were hung from the lug-pole itself, this adjustment could not be made, and you would have to-' dismount the whole business in order to get one kettle off. Then get two thick, flat rocks and bed them under the lug-pole to support your fire-irons or the frying pan itself. A pair of green logs will do if there are no rocks handy. There is much in knowing how to select fuel. As a rule, hardwoods make good, slow-burning fuel that produces lasting coals, while softwoods make a quick, hot fire that soon dies to useless ashes. The following woods will scarcely burn at all when they are green: aspen (large-toothed), black ash, balsam, box elder, buckeye, hemlock, pitch pine, sassafras, sourwood, sycamore, tamarack, tupelo (sour gum), water oak, poplar (tulip), and service berry. Butternut, chestnut, red oak, red maple, qnd persimmon burn very slowly in a green state. Such woods are good for backlogs, hand- junks, or andirons, and for side-logs in a cooking- fire that is to be used continuously. Yellow birch and white ash, on the contrary, are better for a camp-fire when green than when they are sea- soned. It may be said, in general, that green wood burns best in winter, when the sap is down. Trees that grow on high, dry ground burn better than those of the same species that stand in moist

132 CAMP COOKERY. without a full day’s previous preparation and the resources of a city grocery. Mulligatawny, for example, requires thirty-two varieties of spices and other condiments. No start can be made with any standard soup until one has a supply of stock made of veal or beef, mutton or poul- try, by long simmering and skimming and strain- ing. In camp, stock can be made expeditiously by cutting one or two pounds of venison into thin slices, then into dice, cover with cold water, boil gently twenty minutes, take from the fire, skim, and strain. A tolerable substitute is Liebig’s beef extract dissolved in water. Onion, cloves, mace, celery seed, salt, and red or white pepper, are used for seasoning. Sassa- fras leaves, dried before the fire and powdered, make the gumbo -file of the creoles. Recipes for, a few simple, nourishing soups, are given below: Squirrel Soup.—Put the squirrels (not less than three) in a gallon of cold water, with a scant tablespoonful of salt. Cover the pot closely, bring to the bubbling point, and then simmer gently un- til the meat begins to be tender. Then add what- ever vegetables you have. When the meat has boiled to a rag, remove the bones. Thicken the soup with a piece of butter rubbed to a smooth paste in flour. Season to taste. Croutons for Soup.—Slice some stale bread half an inch thick, remove ci*ust, and cut bread into half-inch dice. Fry these, a few at a time, in deep fat of the “blue smoke” temperature, until they are golden brown. Drain free from grease, and add to each plate of soup when serving. (See also page 114.)

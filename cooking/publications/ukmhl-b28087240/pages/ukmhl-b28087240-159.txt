BEVERAGES AND DESSERTS. 137 Jelly from lJried Fruit.—I was present when a Southern mountain woman did some “experi- encin’/’ with nothing to guide her but her own wits. The result was a discovery of prime value to us campers. Here are the details—any one can follow them: Wash one pound of evaporated apples (or com- mon sun-dried apples of the country) in two wa- ters. Cover with boiling water, and put them on to stew. Add boiling water as required to keep them covered. Cook until fruit is soft (about half an hour). Strain off all the juice (cheesecloth is convenient), and measure it. There will be, prob- ably, a quart. Put this juice on the fire and add half its own measure of granulated sugar (say a scant pound—but measure it, to make sure of the proportion). Now boil this briskly in a broad, uncovered vessel, without stirring or skimming, until the juice gets syrupy. The time varies according to quality of fruit—generally about twenty minutes after coming to a full boil. When the thickened juice begins to “flop,” test it by letting a few drops drip from a spoon. When the drops thicken and adhere to the spoon, the syrup is done. There will be a little more than a pint. Pour it out. As soon as it cools it will be jelly, as good as if made from fresh fruit and much better than what is commonly sold in the stores. The apples remaining can be spiced and used as sauce, or made into pies or turnovers, or into apple butter by beating smooth, adding a tea- cupful of sugar, spicing, and cooking again for fifteen or twenty minutes. If preferred, a second run of jelly can be made from the same apples. Cover again with boil-

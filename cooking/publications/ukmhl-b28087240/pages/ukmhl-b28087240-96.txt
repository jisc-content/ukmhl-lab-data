74 CAMP COOKERY. prepared, is not half bad. The French-Canadians found that out long ago. Skin and clean carefully four muskrats, being particular not to rupture musk or gall sac. Take the hind, legs and saddles, place in pot with a little -water, a little julienne (or fresh vegetables, if you have them), some pepper and salt, and a few slices of pork or bacon. Simmer slowly over fire until half done. Remove to baker, place water from pot in the baking pan, and cook until done, basting frequently. This will be found a most toothsome dish.” Muskrat may also be broiled over the hot coals, basting with a bit of pork held on a switch above the beastie. Woodchuck.—I asked old Uncle Bob Flowers, one of my neighbors in the Smokies: “Did you, ever eat a woodchuck?” “Reckon I don’t know what them is.” “Ground-hog.” “O la! dozens of ’em. The red ones hain’t good, but the gray ones! man, they’d jest make yer mouth water!” “How do you cook them?” “Cut the leetle red kernels out from under their forelegs; then bile ’em, fust—all the strong is left in the water—then pepper ’em, and sage ’em, and put ’em in a pan, and bake ’em to a nice rich brown, and—then I don’t want nobody there but me!” Beaver Tail.—This tid-bit of the old-time trap- pers will be tasted by few of our generation, more’s the pity! Impale the tail on a sharp stick and broil over the coals for a few minutes. The rough, scaly hide will blister and come off in sheets, leaving the tail clean, white, and solid.

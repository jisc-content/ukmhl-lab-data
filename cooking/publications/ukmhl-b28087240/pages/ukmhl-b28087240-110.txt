Five or ten minutes before serving, split some hard crackers and dip them in cold water (or use stale bread or biscuits similarly), add them to the chow'der, and pour in about a pint of hot milk. The advantage of first frying the pork and onion is that the fish need not then be cooked over- done, which is the case in chowders started with raw pork in the bottom of the kettle and boiled. Another Fish Chowder.—Clean the fish, parboil it, and reserve the water in which it was boiled. Place the dry pot on the fire; when it is hot, throw in a lump of butter and about six onions sliced finely. When the odor of onion arises, add the fish. Cover the pot closely for fish to absorb flavor. Add a very small quantity of potatoes, and some of the reserved broth. When cooked, let each man season his own dish. Ask a blessing and eat. (Kenealy.) Fish Cakds:—Take fish left over from a previous meal and either make some mashed potatoes (boil them, and mash with butter and milk) or use just the plain cold boiled potatoes. Remove bones from fish and mince it quite fine. Mix well, in propor- tion of one-third fish and two-thirds potato. Sea- j son with salt and pepper. Then mix in thor- | oughly a well-beaten egg or two (or equivalent of desiccated egg). If it seems too dry, add more egg.

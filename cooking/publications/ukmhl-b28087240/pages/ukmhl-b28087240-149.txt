VEGETABLES.—SOUPS. 127 (about an hour). If you wish them mild, boil in two or three waters. When cooked, drain and season with butter or dripping, pepper, and salt. Boiled milk, thickened, is a good sauce. Green Corn.—If you happen to camp near a farm in the “roasting-ear” season, you are in great luck. The quickest wajr to roast an ear of corn is to cut off the butt of the ear closely, so that the pith of the cob is exposed, ream it out a little, impale the cob lengthwise on the end of a long hardwood stick, and turn over the coals. To bake in the ashes: remove one outer husk, stripping off the silk, break off about an inch 'of the silk end, and twist end of husks tightly down over the broken end. Then bake in the ashes and embers as directed for potatoes. Time, about one hour. To boil: prepare as above, but tie the ends of husks; this preserves the sweetness of the corn. Put in enough boiling salted water to cover the ears. Boil thirty minutes. Like potatoes, corn is injured by over-boiling. When cooked, cut off the butt and remove the shucks. Cold boiled corn may be cut from the cob and fried, or mixed with mashed potatoes and fried. Greens.—One who camps early in the season can add a toothsome dish, now and then, to his menu by gathering fresh greens in the woods and marshes.* As a salad (watercress, peppergrass, dandelion, wild mustard, sorrel, etc.): wash in cold salted water, if necessary, although this abstracts some of the flavor; dry immediately and thoroughly. * Nearly a hundred edible wild plants, besides mush- rooms and fruits, are discussed in my Camping and Woodcraft, Chap.

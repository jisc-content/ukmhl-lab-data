121 CHAPTER X. VEGETABLES.—SOUPS. FRESH Vegetables.—Do not wash them until just before they are to be cooked or eaten. They lose flavor quickly after being washed. This is true even of potatoes. Fresh vegetables go into plenty of fast-boiling salted water. Salt prevents their absorbing too much water. The water should be boiling fast, and there should be plenty of it. They should be boiled rapidly, with the lid left off the pan. If the water is as hot as it should be, the effect is similar to that which we have noted in the case of meats: the surface is coagulated into a water- proof envelope which seals up the flavor instead of letting it be soaked out. In making soup, the rule is reversed. Dried Vegetables.—Beans and peas are to be cooked in unsalted water. If salted too soon they become leathery and difficult to cook. Put them in cold, fresh water, gradually heated to the boil- ing point, and boil slowly. Desiccated (dehydrated) Vegetables.—Follow directions on package. Desiccated potatoes of the ordinary kind require long soaking in cold water. Then put them in water slightly salted and pro- ceed as with fresh potatoes. They may need boil- ing in three’ waters. Canned Vegetables.—The liquor of canned peas,

78 CAMP COOKERY. cooking, was brought forth. Through it at the wings George stuck a sharp wooden pin, leaving the ends to protrude on each side. Through the legs he stuck a similar pin in a similar fashion. This being done, he slipped the noose at the end of the twine over the ends of one of the pins. And lo and behold! the goose was suspended before the fire. It hung low—just high enough to permit the placing of a dish under it to catch the gravy. Now and then George gave it a twirl so that none of its sides might have reason to complain at not receiving its share of the heat. The lower end roasted first; seeing which, George took the goose off, reversed it, and set it twirl- ing again. Time-table for Roasting Birds.—A goose or a middling-sized turkey takes about two hours to roast, a large turkey three hours, a duck about forty-five minutes, a pheasant twenty to thirty min- utes, a woodcock or snipe fifteen to twenty min- utes. Wild Duck, Baked.—The bird should be dry- picked, and the head left on. Put a little pepper and salt inside the bird, but no other dressing. Lay the duck on its back in the bake-pan. Put no water in the pan. The oven must be hot, but not hot enough to burn; test with the hand. Baste frequently with butter or bacon. A canvasback requires about thirty minutes; other birds accord- ing to size. When done, the duck should be plump, and the flesh red, not blue. This is the way to bring out the distinctive flavor of a canvasback. Seasoning and stuffing de- stroy all that. A canvasback should not be washed either inside or outside, but wiped clean with a dry cloth. Duck should be served with currant jelly, if you have it. (See also page 55.) Wild Duck, Stewed.—Clean well and divide into convenient pieces (say, legs, wings, and four parts of body). Place in pot with enough cold

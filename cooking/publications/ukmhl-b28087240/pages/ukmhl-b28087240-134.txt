112 CAMP COOKERY. Then, in a cool place where snow will not melt, stir into above one quart light snow. Bake about forty minutes in rather hot oven. Snow, for some unknown reason, has the same effect on bread as eggs have, two tablespoonfuls of snow equaling one egg. It can also be used in making batter for pancakes, or puddings, the batter being made rather thick, and the snow mixed with each cake just before putting in the pan. Substitute for Baking Soda.—Take the white of wood ashes, same quantity as you would use of soda, and mix dry with the flour. It makes bread rise the same as soda, and you can’t tell the difference. The best ashes are those of hick- ory, dogwood, sugar maple, and corncobs; beech, ash, buckeye, balsam poplar, and yellow poplar are also good. “Gritted Bread.”—When green corn has be- come too hard for boiling, but is still too soft for grinding into meal, make a “gritter,” as fol- lows: Take a piece of tin about 7x14 inches (unsolder a lard pail by heating, and flatten the sides); punch holes through it, close together, with a large nail; bend the sheet into a half cylin- der, rough side out, like a horseradish grater; nail the edges to a board somewhat longer and wider than the tin. Then, holding the ear of corn pointing lengthwise from you, grate it into a vessel held between the knees. The meal thus formed will need no water, but can be mixed in its own milk. Salt it, and bake quickly. The flavor of “gritted bread” is a blend of hot pone and roasting ears—delectable! Hard corn can be grated by first soaking the ears over night.

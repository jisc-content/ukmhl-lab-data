CAMP COOKERY. 40 plish this just now. So reach in with the jack- knife, cut carefully around the rectum and urinary organs, keeping as close to the bone as possible, and free everything from the cavity. If water is near, wash out the abdominal cavity and let it drain. To remove the head; flay back the skin for sev- eral inches at base of neck, cut through flesh, etc., to the backbone. . Search along this till you find the flat joint between the faces of two vertebrae, separate these as far as you can; then twist the attached part of the body round and round, until it breaks off.* In butchering, sane the liver, heart, brain, milt (spleen), kidneys,-and the caul fat. The caul is the fold of membrane loaded with fat that covers most of the intestines. In removing the liver you need not bother about a gall-bladder, for a deer has none. Many a tenderfoot has been tricked into looking for it. If one is in a hurry, and is not particular about the hide, he can do his butchering on the ground. In that case, lay the animal on sloping ground, with its head uphill; or bend its back over a log or rock; or turn it on its back with its head twisted around and wedged under one side. In butchering an elk or moose that has antlers, first remove the head. Then turn the body on its back and prop it in position with a couple of three-foot stakes sharpened at both ends, a hole being dug for a mooseâ€™s withers. Sometimes only the haunches, sirloins, and tongue are saved, these being cut away without skinning or gutting the carcass. *Directions how to skin a head for mounting are given in my Camping and Woodcraft, Chap.

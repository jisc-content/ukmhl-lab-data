CAMP COOKERY. 8 Butter.—For ordinary trips it suffices to pack butter firmly into pry-up tin cans which have been sterilized by thorough scalding and then cooled in a perfectly clean place. Keep it in a spring or in cold running water (hung in a net, or weighted with a rock) whenever you can. When traveling, wrap the cold can in a towel or other insulating material. Butter will keep fresh a long time if melted and gently boiled for a while, skimming off the scum as it rises, until the butter is as clear as oil, and then canning it. One-third less of this clarified butter equals the quantity of ordinary butter called for in any recipe. Nut butter may be used as a substitute on bread. Cheese.—According to taste, and only for occa- sional use. A small bottle of grated Parmesan for macaroni, etc. Lard.—The amount will depend upon whether you use much lard in baking, and whether you fry with it or with bacon grease, oil, or butter. Olive oil is superior as a friture, especially for fish, but more expensive and more bothersome to carry. Milk.—Sweetened condensed milk (the “salve” of the lumber jacks) is an abomination. The dif- ferent brands of plain evaporated milk vary much in quality. Choose by actual test. The five cent cans are most convenient. Two varieties of powdered milk (skimmed and whole, respectively) may be procured. The kind called “Trucream” makes four quarts of rich milk to the pound, by dissolving in water. Potatoes.—If you can carry fresh ones, choose those with small eyes and of uniform medium size, even if you have to buy a bushel to sort out a peck.

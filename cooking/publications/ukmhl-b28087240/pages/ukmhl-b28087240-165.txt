BEVERAGES AND DESSERTS. 143 Plain Plum Duff.— 1 quart flour, 1 heaped teaspoonful baking powder, 2 tablespoonfuls sugar, 1 lb. seeded raisins. % lb. suet (or see below). Venison suet chopped fine, or the fat of salt pork minced up, will serve. Marrow is better than either. Mix the dry ingredients intimately. Then make up with half a pint of water. Put this into a cloth bag prepared as in the preceding recipe. Since suet puddings swell considerably, the bag must be large enough to allow for this. Place in enough boiling water to cover, and do not let it check boiling until done (about two hours). Add boiling water as required to keep the bag cov- ered. Turn the bag upside down when pudding begins to set, or the fruit will all go to the bot- tom ; turn it around now and then to prevent scorching against sides of pot. When done, manipulate it like cottage pudding. Serve with sweet sauce. A richer duff can be made by spicing and add- ing molasses, or the rind and juice of a lemon. Sweet Sauce for Puddings.—Melt a little but- ter, sweeten it to taste, and flavor with grated lemon rind, nutmeg, or cinnamon. Brandy Sauce.—Butter twice the size of an egg is to be beaten to a cream with a pint of sugar and a tablespoonful of flour. Add a gill of brandy. Set the cup in a dish of boiling water and beat until the sauce froths. Fruit Sauce.—Boil almost any fresh fruit un- til it is quite soft. Squeeze it through cheese- cloth, sweeten to taste, heat it, and pour the sauce over your pudding. Spices may be added during the final heating.

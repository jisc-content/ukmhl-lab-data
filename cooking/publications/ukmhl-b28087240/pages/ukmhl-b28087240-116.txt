CAMP COOKERY. 94. move to a hot plate. Slice the liver (that of any ' large game animal) thin. Flour and pepper it and place it in the pan. Turn frequently until done; then place a slice of bacon on each slice of liver and pour over it a gravy made as follows: Bacon Gravy, Thin.—Pour off the fat and save it for future use. Pour in enough water to supply the quantity of gravy desired. Add the juice of a lemon. Boil and pour upon the bacon. If a richer gravy is desired, follow recipe given below. Pork Gravy, Thickened.—This can be made with ham or salt pork, as well as with bacon. To make gravy that is a good substitute for butter, rub into the hot grease that is left in the pan a tablespoonful of flour, keep on rubbing until smooth and brown; then add two cups boiling water and a dash of pepper. A tablespoonful of catchup may be added for variety. If you have milk, use it instead of water (a pint to the heap- ing tablespoonful of flour), and do not let the flour brown; this makes a delicious white gravy. Salt Pork, Fried.—Same as fried bacon, above. Pork should be firm and dry. Clammy pork is stale. Salt Pork, Broiled.—Same as bacon; but it is usually so salty that it should be parboiled first, or soaked at least an hour in cold water. Salt Pork, Boiled.—Nearly always cooked with vegetables or greens; hence need not be soaked or parboiled. See page 58. Pork Fritters.—Make a thick batter of corn meal one-third and flour two-thirds, or of flour alone. Fry a few slices of pork until the fat is tried out. Then cut a few more slices, dip them in the batter, drop them in the bubbling fat, sea- son with salt and pepper, fry to a light brown.

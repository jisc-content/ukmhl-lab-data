FIRES. 29 tripod, under the hanging pot, with their curls down. Around them build a conical wigwam of the other sticks, standing each on end and slant- ing to a common center. Leave free air spaces be- tween the sticks. Fire requires air, and plenty of it, and it burns best when it has something to climb up on; hence the wigwam construction. Now touch off the shaved sticks, and in a mo- ment you will have a small blast furnace under the pot. This will get up steam in a hurry. Meantime get two bed-sticks, five or six inches thick, to support the frying pan. The firewood will all drop to embers soon after the pot boils. Toss out the smoking butts, leaving only clear, glowing coals. Put your bed-sticks on either side, parallel and level. Set the pan on them, and fry away. So, in fifteen or twenty minutes from the time you drove your stake, the meal will be cooked. A man acting without system or forethought, in even so simple a matter as this, can waste an hour in pottering over smoky mulch, or blister- ing himself before a bonfire, and it will be an ill mess of half-burned stuff that he serves in the end. When making a “one-night stand,” start a small cooking fire the moment you stop for camping and put your kettle on. \ Then you will have coals and boiling water ready when you begin cooking, and the rest is easy. For baking in a reflector, or roasting a joint, a high fire is best, with a backing to throw the heat forward. Sticks three feet long can be leaned against a big log or a sheer-faced rock, and the kindling started under them. Often a good bed of coals is wanted. The

Outing How To Books Have been carefully selected from the out-door books of the Outing Publishing Company. No title is add- ed to the list until its readers have demonstrated its exceptional merit as a practical manual. Consequently these books offer complete and reliable courses of in- struction in outdoor life. They sum- marize the experience of experts, and they are especially helpful in the selection and purchase of equipment and supplies. Wherever possible they have been made pocket size for easy transport- ation. Every copy is printed on high grade bookpaper, artistically illustra- ted and bound attractively. They serve equally well in the open, in the library and as gifts. @OUTING> PUBLISHING COMPANY/?^ .315 FIFJTH AVLNUE â€™^ lii NEW YORK CITY

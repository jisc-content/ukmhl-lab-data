CAMP COOKERY. 12G get dry and scorch. The longer they boil the more digestible they become. Beans, Baked.—Soak and parboil, as above, both tire beans and the pork. Then pour off the water from the pork, gash the meat with a knife, spread half of it over the bottom of the kettle, drain the beans, pour them into the kettle, put the rest of pork on top, sprinkle not more than one- half teaspoonful of salt over the beans, pepper liberally, and if you have molasses, pour a table- spoonful over all; otherwise a tablespoonful of sugar. Hang the kettle high over the fire where it will not scorch, and bake at least two hours; or, add enough boiling water to just cover the beans, place kettle in bake-hole as directed on page 56, and bake all night, being careful that there are not enough embers with the ashes to burn the beans. Baked beans are strong food, ideal for active men in cold weather. One can work harder and longer on pork and beans, without feeling hungry, than on any other food with which I am ac- quainted, save bear meat. The ingredients are compact and easy to transport; they keep indefi- nitely in any weather.

Put them in enough boiling salted water to cover them. Cover the kettle and boil gently, lest the onions break. They are cooked when a straw will pierce them

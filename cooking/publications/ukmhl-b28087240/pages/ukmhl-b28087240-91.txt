69 GAME. Curry of Game.—Cut some birds or other small game into rather small joints. Fry until lightly browned. Score each joint slightly, place a lit- tle curry powder in each opening, and squeeze lemon juice over it. Cover the joints with brown gravy and simmer gently for twenty minutes. Serve with rice around the dish. (See also Curry Sauce, page 80.) Game Pie.—Make a plain pie crust as directed in the chapter on Desserts. Cut the game into joints. Season rather highly. Moisten the joints with melted butter and lemon juice, or put a few thin strips of bacon in with them. Cover with top crust like a fruit pie and bake not too long; time according to size. Squirrels, Fried.—Unless they are young, par- boil them gently for y2 hour in salted water. Then fry in butter or pork grease until brown. A dash of curry powder when frying is begun im- proves them, unless you dislike curry. Make gravy as directed on page 63. Squirrels, Broiled.—Use only young ones. Soak in cold salted water for an hour, wipe dry, and broil over the coals with a slice of bacon laid over each squirrel to baste it. Squirrels, Stewed.—They are best this way, or fricasseed. For directions see pages 59 and 52. Squirrels, Barbecued.—Build a hardwood fire between two large logs lying about two feet apart. At each end of the fire drive two forked stakes about fifteen inches apart, so that the four stakes will form a rectangle, like the legs of a table. The forks should all be about eighteen inches above the ground. Choose young, tender squirrels (if old ones must be used, parboil them until tender but not soft). Prepare spits by cutting

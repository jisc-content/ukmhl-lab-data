CAMP COOKERY. 16 each of the one-inch and two-inch widths will be useful in a hundred ways. This plaster is waterproof and air-tight. It will stick to any dry surface (wood, metal, glass, cloth, leather, or skin), and will stay there until purposely re- moved; yet it can be peeled off and reapplied many times. As an instantaneous mender of rents and stopper of holes or cracks it has no equal. One of the most bothersome things in shifting camp is to secure opened cans and bottles from spilling.

To protect the bottle from breaking, run a strip around it at top and one at bottom. The caps of baking powder cans or similar tins can be secured to the bodies in the same way. With a broad strip you can seal a box or chest water-tight, stop a leak in a canoe, or mend a broken rod, a paddle, a gunstock, or even an axe- handle (first nailing it). A chest or cupboard can be extemporized from any packing box, in a jiffy, by cleating the top and using surgeon’s plaster for hinges.

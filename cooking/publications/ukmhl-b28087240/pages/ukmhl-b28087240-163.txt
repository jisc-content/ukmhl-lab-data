BEVERAGES AND DESSERTS. 141 hour. Season with butter, sugar, and cinnamon. Fruit Cobbler.—Make up your dough as di- rected under Fie, excepting omit baking powder, and use l/> pound of mixed butter and lard to 2 pints flour. Mix with coldest spring water, and have your hands cold. After putting under crust in greased pan, pour in scant 3 pints of fruit, which may be either fresh, canned, or evaporated (soaked as explained under Dried Fruits), leav- ing out the free juice. Cover with upper crust, bake brown, and serve with milk or pudding sauce. Puddings are either baked in an oven or re- flector, or boiled in a cloth bag. Baked puddings are quickest and easiest to manage. A few ex- amples of single jDuddings are given below. They may be varied indefinitely, according to materials available. Deep tin pudding pans are convenient to bake in. Snow may be substituted for eggs (see page 111). Rice Pudding.—Mix 1 pint cold boiled rice with 1 quart milk and sugar to taste. Put in a well- greased pan, dust nutmeg or cinnamon over the top, and bake slowly one hour. Seeded raisins are an agreeable addition, and a couple of eggs make the pudding richer. Mix them in before baking. To stone them, keep them in lukewarm water during the process. Fruit Pudding.—Line a deep dish or pan, well greased, with slices of buttered bread. Then put in a layer of fruit, dusting it with sugar and dotting with small lumps of butter. Repeat these alternate layers until the dish is full, the last layer being bread. Bake l/2 to % hour, with moderate heat. Eat hot, with the sweet sauce given below.

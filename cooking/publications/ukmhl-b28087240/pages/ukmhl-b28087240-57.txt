FIRES. 35 be dry underneath the bark in all weathers, is procured by snapping off the small dead branches, or stubs of branches, that are left on the trunks of medium-sized trees. Do not pick up twigs from the ground, but choose those, among the downwood, that are held up free from the ground. Where a tree is found that has been shivered by lightning, or one that has broken off without ujwooting, good splinters of dry wood will be found. In every laurel thicket there is plenty of dead laurel, and, since it is of sprangling growth, most of the branches will be free from the ground and snap- dry. They ignite readily and give out intense heat. It is a good test of one’s resourcefulness to make a fire out of doors in rainy weather. The best way to go about it depends upon local con- ditions. Dry fuel and a place to build the fire can often be found under big uptilted logs, shelv- ing rocks, and similar natural shelters, or in the core of an old stump. In default of these, look for a dead softwood tree that leans to the south. The wood and bark on the under side will be dry —chop some off, split it fine, and build your fire under the shelter of the trunk. To light a match in the wind, face the wind. Cup your hands, with their backs toward the wind, and hold the match with its head pointing to- ward the rear of the cup—i. e., toward the wind. Remove the right hand just long enough to strike the match on something very close by; then in- stantly resume the former position. The flame will run up the match stick, instead of being blown away from it, and so will have something to feed on. Never leave a fire, or even a spark, behind you. Put it out.

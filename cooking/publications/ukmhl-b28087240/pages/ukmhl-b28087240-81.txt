MEAT. 59 Remember this: put fresh meat in hard boiling water for only five minutes, to set the j uices; then remove to greater height over the fire and boil very slowly—to let it boil hard all the time would make it tough and indigestible. Salt or corned meats go in cold water at the start and are gradu- ally brought to a boil; thereafter they should be allowed barely to simmer. Fish go in boiling salted water. Boiling meat must be kept covered. At high altitudes it is impossible to cook satis- factorily by boiling, because water boils at a lower and lower temperature the higher we climb. The decrease is at the rate of about one degree for every 550 feet ujd to one mile, and one degree for 560 feet above that, when the temperature is 70°. With the air at 32° F., and the barometer at 30 inches, water boils at 212° at sea-level, 202.5° at 5.000 feet, 193.3° at 10,000 feet, and 184.5° at 15.000 feet. These figures vary somewhat accord- ing to the purity of the water, the material of the vessel, etc. To parboil is to boil only until tender, before cooking in some other way. STEWING. This process is slow, and should be reserved for tough meats. Use lean meat only. First brown it with some hot fat in a frying-pan; or jaut a couple of ounces of chopped pork in a kettle and get it thoroughly hot; cut your meat into small pieces; drop them into the fat and “jiggle” the kettle until the surface of the meat is coagulated by the hot fat, being careful, the while, not to burn it. Add a thickening of a couple of ounces of flour and mix it thoroughly with the fat; then a pint of water or soup-stock. Heat the contents

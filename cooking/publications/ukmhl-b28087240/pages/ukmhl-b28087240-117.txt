CURED MEATS, ETC.—EGGS. 95 and eat while hot. It takes the stomach of a lum- berjack to digest this, but it is a favorite variant in frontier diet. Pork and Hardtack.—Soak hardtack in water until it is partly softened. Drop it into hot pork fat, and cook. A soldier’s resource. Ham, Fried.—Same as bacon. Parboil, first, for eight or ten minutes, if hard and salty. Ham and Eggs.—Same as bacon and eggs. Ham, Broiled.—If salty, parboil first. Cut rather thick slices, pepper them, and broil five minutes. Ham that has been boiled is best for broiling. A little mustard may be spread on the slices when served. Ham, Boiled.—Wash the ham, and let it soak over night in cold water. In the morning, cover it well with fresh water, bring to a boil, and hang the kettle high over the fire where it will boil gently until dinner time. When the bone on the under side leaves the meat readily, the ham is done. If you have eggs, the nicest way to serve a boiled ham is to remove the skin, brush over the top of ham with yolk of egg, sprinkle thickly with finely grated crumbs or cracker-dust, and brown in an oven. Pork Sausages.—Cut links apart, prick each with a fork so it will not burst in cooking, lay in cold frying-pan, and fry fifteen to twenty minutes j over a slow fire, moving them about so they will brown evenly all over. Serve with mashed po- tatoes, over which pour the fat from the pan. Apples fried to a light brown in the sausage grease , are a pleasant accompaniment. Corned Beef, Boiled.—Put the ham into enough cold water to cover it. Let it come slowly to a boil, and then merely simmer until done. Time,

Black birch also ranks here; it has the advantage of "doing its own blowing,” as a Carolina moun- taineer said to me, meaning that the oil in the birch assists its combustion so that the wood needs no coaxing. All of the birches are good fuel, ranking in about this order: black, yellow, red, paper, and white. Sugar maple was the fa- vorite fuel of our old-time hunters and surveyors, because it ignites easily, burns with a clear, steady flame, and leaves good coals. Locust is a good, lasting fuel; it is easy to cut, and, when green, splits fairly well; the thick bark takes fire readily, and the wood then burns slowly, with little flame, leaving pretty good coals; hence it is good for night-wood. Mulberry has similar qualities. The best of the oaks for fuel, especially when green, is white oak; it also splits very readily. The scarlet and willow oaks are among the poorest of the hardwoods for fuel. Cherry makes only fair fuel. White elm is poor stuff, but slippery elm is better. In some respects white ash is the best of green woods for campers’ fuel. It is easily cut and split, is lighter to tote than most other hard- woods, and is of so dry a nature that even the green wood catches fire readily. It burns with clear flame, and lasts longer than any other free- burning wood of its weight. Most of the softwoods are good only for kin- dling, or for quick cooking-fires. Liquidambar, magnolia, poplar (tulip), catalpa, red cedar, and willow are poor fuel. Seasoned chestnut and pop- lar make a hot fire, but crackle and leave no coals. Balsam fir, basswood, and the white and

UTENSILS. 23 carry my own cup at my belt or in my pouch, for it is wanted ten times a day. It is of white enam- eled ware. If every man does this, there will be no trouble about cups nesting. Plates, too, should be of enameled ware, for it is so much easier to clean than tin or aluminum. Let them be deep and generous (9)4-inch soup plates, nesting in the frying pan). The frying-pan handle is a perennial problem. The best form of detachable handle that I know of is Darlingâ€™s. A stick can be inserted in it, for long-distance frying, by those who do not know that frying should never be done over a fierce fire, nor that a few coals raked to one side do the trick. Few camp cooking kits include a baker, al- though it is almost essential for comfortable life in the woods. The most portable form is the fold- ing reflector sold by most outfitters. It is similar to those that our great-grandmothers used to bake biscuit in, before a hearth fire. The top slants like a shed roof, and the bottom like another shed roof turned upside down, the bread pan being in the middle. The slanting top and bottom reflect heat downward upon the top of the baking and upward against its bottom, so that bread, for in- stance, bakes evenly all around. A prime advantage of this cunning utensil is that baking can proceed immediately when the fire is kindled, without waiting for the wood to burn down to coals, and without danger of burning the dough. Fish, flesh, and fowl can be roasted to a turn in this contrivance. It has several better points than an oven, chief of which is its porta- bility, as it folds flat; but it is inferior for corn bread, army bread, etc., and impossible for pot- roasts or braising.

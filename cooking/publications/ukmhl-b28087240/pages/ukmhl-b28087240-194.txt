OUTING HOW TO BOOK No. I. THE BOOK OF Camping Woodcraft By HORACE KEPHART It fits the ■pocket—an encyclopedia in 4% by 7 inches. Copiously illustrated 331 pages. Cloth, decorative. $i.JO postpaid. “'-pHE BOOK OF CAMPING AND WOOD- X CRAFT,” by Horace Kephart, is author- itative in every detail. No more valuable book on life in the woods has been produced. It has an added charm for the old timer at tramping and camping—so much knowledge is here confined in so small a space; for the individual starting out on his first ‘‘open road” pilgrimage it is a veritable gold mine; for the man ‘‘just going out for a few days” it fills the same need. And back of all this is the fact that the book reads like a novel, so charmingly is it written. LIST OF CONTENTS.

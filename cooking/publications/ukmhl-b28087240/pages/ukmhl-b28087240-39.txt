PROVISIONS. 17 wood for its weight that we have, and will not splinter. For the ends and lids of small chests, j^-inch stuff is thick enough, and -inch for the sides, bottoms, and trays. The bottom should have a pair of ^-inch cleats for risers and the top a similar pair to keep it from warping, unless the chests are to go on pack animals. Strap-hinges and hasp, a brass padlock and broad leather end- straps (not drop-handles) should be provided, and the chest painted. The best size is 24x18x9 inches, this being con- venient for canoes and pack-saddles. A pine gro- cery box of this size, with S^-inch ends and %-inch sides, top, and bottom, weighs only 10 pounds, and will answer the purpose very well. Screw a wooden handle on each end, say 5x2 inches, with a hand-hold gouged out of the un- der side. Check off every article in the outfit as it is stowed, and keep the inventory for future refer- ence. Then note what is left over at the end of the trip. This will help in outfitting for the next season.

CAMP COOKERY. 2 domestic cook-book. Yet the trick is easy, when one knows how. Light outfitting, as regards food, is mainly a question of how much water we are willing to carry in our rations. For instance, canned peaches are 88 per cent, water. Can one afford to carry so much water from home when there is better water at camp ? What, then, is best to substitute for the peaches? Let us see.â€” An average can of peaches weighs 2j4 lbs. Evaporated apples are only 26 per cent, water, and sugar has none at all. A pound of the ap- ples and a pound of sugar cost three-fourths as much as the peaches, weigh a fifth less, are a little bulkier, but pack better on the trail. In camp, let the apples be stewed soft in plenty of water, and used as sauce. There is left a quart of hot juice. Into it put the pound of sugar. Boil, without stir- ring or skimming, until the juice gets syrupy, and pour into a vessel to cool. Result: somewhat more than a pint of as good jelly as can be made from fresh apples themselves. The sauce and the jelly will go much farther than a can of peaches, and there is more variety. The following table is suggestive: More than % Water. Fresh milk, fruit, vegetables (except potatoes).

50 CAMP COOKERY. dish is nearly or quite done. Remember this: salt draws the juices. The juices of meats and fish arc their most palatable and nutritious ingredients. We extract them purposely in making soups, stews, and gravies, but in so doing we ruin the meat itself. Any fish, flesh, or fowl that is fit to be eaten for the good meat’s sake should be cooked succulent, by first coagulating the outside (searing in a bright flame or in a very hot pan, or plunging into smok- ing hot grease or furiously boiling water) and then removing farther from the fire to cook grad- ually till done. The first process, which is quickly performed, is “the surprise.” It sets the juices, and, in the case of frying, seals the fish or meat in a grease-proof envelope so that it will not be- come sodden but will dry crisp when drained. The horrors of the frying-pan that has been unskill- fully wielded are too well known. Let us camp- ers, to whom the frying-pan is an almost indis- pensable utensil, set a good example to our grease- afflicted country by using it according to the code of health and epicurean taste. Meat, game, and fish may be fried, broiled, roasted, baked, boiled, stewed, or steamed. Frying and broiling are the quickest processes; roasting, baking, and boiling take an hour or two; a stew of meat and vegetables, to be good, takes half a day, and so does soup prepared from the raw ma- terials. Tough meat should be boiled or braised in a pot. FRYING. Do not try to fry over a flaming fire or a deep bed of coals; the grease would likely burn and catch aflame. Rake a thin layer of coals out in

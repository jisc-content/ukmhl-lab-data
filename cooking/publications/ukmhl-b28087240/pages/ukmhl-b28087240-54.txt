CAMP COOKERY. 32 soil. Chestnut cut on the summits of the southern Appalachians burns freely, even when green, and the mountain beech burns as ardently as birch. Arbor-vitae (Northern “white cedar”) and chest- nut burn to dead coals that do not communicate flame. They, as well as box elder, red cedar, hemlock, sassafras, tulip, balsam, tamarack, and spruce, make a great crackling and snapping in the fire. All of the soft pines, too, are prone to pop. Certain hardwoods, such as sugar maple, beech, white oak, and sometimes hickory, must be watched for a time after the fire is started, because the embers that they shoot out are long-lived, and hence more dangerous than those of softwoods; but they are splendid fuel, for all that. The following woods are very hard to split: Blue ash, box elder, buckeye, cherry, white elm, winged elm, sour gum, hemlock (generally), liquidambar (sweet gum), honey locust, sugar ma- ple, sycamore, tupelo. Some woods, however, that are stubborn when seasoned are readily split when green, such as hickory, beech, dogwood, su- gar maple, birch, and slippery elm. Firewoods that split easily are: Hackberrv, red oak, basket oak, white oak, ash, and white birch. Best of all Northern firewoods is hickory, green or dry. It makes a hot fire, but lasts a long time, burning, down to a bed of hard coals that keep up an even, generous heat for hours. Hick- ory, by the way, is distinctly an American tree; no other region on earth produces it. The live oak of the South is most excellent fuel. Follow- ing the hickory, in fuel value, are the chestnut oak, overcup, post and basket oaks, pecan, the hornbeams (ironwoods), and dogwood. The lat-

Rice Muffins.—Mash very smooth half a pint boiled rice. Add slowly, stirring to a thinner paste, half a pint of milk, three beaten eggs, salt. Then make into a stiff batter with flour. Bake like dropped biscuits. Risotto.—Fry a sliced onion brown in a table- spoonful of butter. Add to this a pint of hot water and half a pint of washed rice. Boil until soft, adding more hot water if needed. Heat half a pint canned tomatoes, and stir into it a teaspoon- ful of sugar. When the rice is soft, salt it; add the tomato; turn into a dish and sprinkle over it a heaped tablespoonful of grated cheese. Rice, Curried.—Same as Risotto, but put a tea- spoonful of curry powder in the tomatoes and omit cheese. Grits, Boiled.—Put in plenty of boiling unsalted water. Boil about thirty minutes; then salt and drain. Grits, Fried.—Same as fried rice. “Breakfast Foods.”—According to directions on packages. Left-over Cereals.—See Mixed Cakes, page 114.

CAMP COOKERY. 6 and is nauseous to many. Purchasable at most frontier camps. Breakfast Bacon.—Better for most purposes than salt pork. Seldom obtainable outside of towns. Get the boneless, in 5 to 8 lb. flitches. That which is sliced and canned is a poor substi- tute either in flavor or wholesomeness. Smoked Ham.—Small ones generally are tough and too salty. Hard to keep in warm or damp weather; moulds easily, and is attractive to blow- flies. It is best to get both bacon and ham un- wrapped, and sew them up in cheesecloth yourself; then you are sure they were not mouldy to start with. Dried Beef.—Cuts from large hams are best. Of limited use in pick-up meals. A notori- ous thirst-breeder. Not comparable to “jerk’d” beef, which, unfortunately, is not in the market.* Canned Meats and Poultry of all descriptions are quite unfit for steady diet. Devilled or potted ham, chicken, tongue, sausage, and the like, are endurable at picnics, and valuable in emergencies, as when a hard storm makes outdoor cooking im- possible. Canned corned beef makes a passable hash. Extract of Beef.—Liebig’s is useful in adding flavor to gravy or soup, and may be needed in case of illness. Canned Fish.—Not so objectionable as canned meat, because preserved in oil. Salmon, sardines, mackerel, can be worked into palatable dishes for hasty meals now and then. Go light. ♦For the process of jerking venison or beef, see mv Camping and Woodcraft, p. 222. I have found that it succeeds even in the wet climate of the Southern Ap- palachians. (See also page 45.)

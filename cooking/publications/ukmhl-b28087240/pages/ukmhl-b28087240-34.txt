CAMP COOKERY. the men’s personal tastes. However, the follow- ing table, based upon my own experience and al- lowing for many contingencies, may at least be useful as showing how to go about it. The table gives four distinct estimates of food required by four men in two weeks, graded ac- cording as they travel light or heavy, in warm weather or in cold. The quantities will suffice without counting on game or fish. The difference between “light” and “heavy” is chiefly due to fresh potatoes and canned goods. It will be noticed that the cold-weather ration that I give is more liberal than that for warm weather, and that the addition is mostly in fatty and oily foods. A man who eats little fat meat when living in the city will find that when he travels hard in cold weather and sleeps in the open air his system will demand more fatty food. The experience of travelers in the far North bears out the results of scientific analysis, that foods con- taining fats and oils are more nutritious and heat- producing than any others. But a steady diet of bread and bacon is likely to breed scurvy; so a supply of vegetables and fruits should be added. Men living in the open also develop a craving for sweets that is out of all proportion to what they experience in town. This is a normal demand, for sugar is stored-up energy. I have allowed liberally for this, and also for the increased con- sumption of coffee and tea that is the rule (owing somewhat to the fact that they lose strength from exposure to the air). The table is chiefly valuable as showing the proper ratios of the meat, the bread, and the veg- etable and fruit components. Under each of these headings the items can be varied a great deal, ac-

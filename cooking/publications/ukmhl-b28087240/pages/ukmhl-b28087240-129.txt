BREADSTUFFS AND CEREALS. 107 larly done. Time, twenty to twenty-five min- utes in a reflector, ten to fifteen minutes in a closed oven. Dropped Biscuit.—These do away with bread- board, rolling-pin, and most of the work, yet are about as good as stamped biscuit. Use same proportions as above, except turn in enough water to make a thick batter—one that will drop lazily from a spoon. In mixing, do not stir the batter more than necessary to smooth out all lumps. Drop from a big spoon into the greased bake-pan. Army Bread.—This is easier to make than bis- cuit dough, since there is no grease to rub in, but it takes longer to bake. It keeps fresh longer than yeast bread, does not dry up in a week, nor mould, and is more wholesome than biscuit. It is the only baking-powder bread I know of that is good to eat cold—in fact, it is best that way. 1 quart flour, 1 teaspoonful salt, 1 tablespoonful sugar, 2 heaped teaspoonfuls baking powder. Mix the dry ingredients thoroughly. Then stir in enough cold water (about iy2 pints) to make a thick batter that will pour out level. Mix rap- idly with spoon until smooth, and pour at once into bake-pan. Bake about forty-five minutes, or until no dough adheres to a sliver. Above quan- tity makes a ltyj-pound loaf (say 9x5x3 inches). Breakfast Rolls.— 1 quart flour, 2 level tablespoonfuls butter, 1 egg, 1 teaspoonful baking powder, 1 pint cold milk (or enough to make a soft dough). Rub butter and flour well together, add beaten egg, a pinch of salt, and the milk, till a soft dough is mixed. Form into rolls and bake quickly.

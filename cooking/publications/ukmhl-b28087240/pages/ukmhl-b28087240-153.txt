VEGETABLES.—SOUPS. 131 we have learned better. Cut about four pounds of the bloody meat into convenient pieces, and wipe them as clean as possible with leaves jr a damp cloth, but don’t wash them. Put the meat into a five-quart kettle nearly filled with water, and raise it to a lively boiling pitch.” Here I must interfere. It is far better to bring the water gradually to a boil and then at once hang the kettle high over the fire where it will only keep up a moderate bubbling. There let it simmer at least two hours-—better half a day. It is impossible to hasten the process. Furious boil- ing would ruin both the soup and the meat. Nessmuk continues: “Have ready a three-tined fork made from a branch of birch or beech, and with this test the meat from time to time; when it parts readily from the bones, slice in a large onion. Pare six large, smooth potatoes, cut five of them into quarters, and drop them into the kettle; scrape the sixth one into the soup for thickening. Season with salt and white pepper to taste. When, by skirmishing with the wooden fork, you can fish up bones with no meat on them, the soup is cooked, and the kettle may be set aside to cool.” Any kind of game may be used in a similar way, provided that none but lean meat be used. Soup is improved by first soaking the chopped-up meat in cold water, and using this water to boil in thereafter. Soup should be skimmed for some time after it has started simmering, to remove grease and scum. To any one who knows petite marmite or poule- au-pot, these simple directions will seem barbarous and so they are; but barbarism has its compen- sations. A really first-class soup cannot be made

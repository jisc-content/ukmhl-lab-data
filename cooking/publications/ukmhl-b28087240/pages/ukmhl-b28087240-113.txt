FISH AND SHELLFISH. 01 shrivel—they should remain plump. Add two- thirds pint of milk, let all scald through, remove from fire, and season to taste. Never boil oysters in milk. Oysters, Fried.—Drain the oysters, and dry them on a soft cloth (then they will not absorb grease). Have some desiccated egg prepared, or beat light the yolks of two or three eggs. Have enough smoking hot grease in the pan to cover all the oysters. Dip an oyster into the egg, then into rolled cracker or dry crumbs, and repeat this.

110 CAMP COOKERY. To Mix Bough Without a Pan.—When bark will peel, use a broad sheet of it (paper birch, basswood, poplar, cottonwood, slippery elm, etc.). It is easy to mix unleavened dough in the sack of flour itself. Stand the latter horizontally where it can t fall over. Scoop a bowl-shaped depres- sion in top of flour. Keep the right hand moving round while you pour in a little water at a time from a vessel held in the left. Sprinkle a little salt in. When a thick, adhesive dough has formed, lift this out and pat and work it into a round cake about 2% inches thick. CORN BREAD. Plain corn bread, without flour, milk, or egg, is hard to make eatable without a Dutch oven to bake it in. Even so, it is generally spoiled by be- ing baked too fast and not long enough to be done inside. Johnny Cake.— 1 quart meal, 1 teaspoonful salt, 1 pint warm (but not scalding) water (1% pints for old meal). Stir together until light. Bake to a nice brown all around (about forty-five minutes), and let it sweat fifteen minutes longer in the closed oven, removed from the fire. Yellow meal generally requires more water than white. Freshly ground meal is much better than old. Corn Dodgers.—Same as above, but mix to a stiff dough, and form into cylindrical dodgers four or five inches long and 1^ inches diameter, by rolling between the hands. Have frying-pan very hot, grease it a little, and put dodgers on as you roll them out. As soon as they have browned, put them in oven and bake thoroughly.

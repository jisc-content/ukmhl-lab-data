102 CHAPTER IX. BREADSTUFFS AND CEREALS. WHEN men must bake for themselves they generally make biscuit, biscuit-loaf, flap- jacks, or corn bread. Bread leavened with yeast is either beyond their skill or too trou- blesome to make out of doors; so baking powder is the mainstay of the camp. Generally the batch is a failure. To paraphrase Tom Hood, Who has not met with camp-made bread. Rolled out of putty and weighted with lead? It need not be so. Just as good biscuit or johnny cake can be baked before a log fire in the woods as in a kitchen range. Bread making is a chemical process. Follow directions; pay close attention to details, as a chemist does, from build- ing the fire to testing the loaf with a sliver. It does require experience or a special knack to guess quantities accurately, but none at all to measure them. In general, biscuit or other small cakes should be baked quickly by ardent heat; large loaves re- quire a slow, even heat, so that the outside will not harden until the inside is nearly done. The way to bake in a reflector or in a “baker” has been shown in the chapter ■on Meats. If you have neither of these utensils, there are other ways.

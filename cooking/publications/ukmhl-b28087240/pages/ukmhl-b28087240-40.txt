18 CHAPTER II. UTENSILS. A PARTY going into fixed camp, within wagon call of the railroad, can carry a sheet-steel stove. A good pattern is the Klondike stove shown in the illustration. Its best feature is the size of the fire-box, which takes in wood twenty-eight inches long and thick enough to keep an all-night fire, the stove being closed air- tight. The top of the Klondike, 14x30 inches, is free for utensils; the oven, above it, takes a 10x14 pan for baking or roasting. Oven, legs, and pipe stow inside the body of the stove, leaving space for a 12xl3x9%-inch galvanized box that holds cooking utensils for four persons and can be used in camp as a dish-pan or as a vermin-proof box for provisions. When packed for transportation, the stove measures 30x14x12 inches, and weighs 29 pounds (complete with box and utensils, 43^/2 pounds). In rough country, especially if camp is to be shifted frequently, a stove is out of the reckoning. If pack animals are taken, or the trip is by canoe, without long and difficult portages, it pays to take along either a folding grate or a pair of fire irons. Various patterns of grates are shown in outfittersâ€™ catalogues. I have used one called the Gem which is satisfactory of its kind. It weighs 3)4 pounds, is 16x28 inches when set up, and folds into a package l!/2xl9 inches.

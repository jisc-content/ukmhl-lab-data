ENTREES. 166 otherwise wasted scraps. Well do I remember find- ing one day in the larder a saucerful of tiny morsels of flaked fish flanked by some skin and the bones and trimmings of the fish. “ Why, you have for- gotten to give Pussy her supper last night! ” I observed. “ Pussy’s supper, ma’am, indeed no ! She had it all right enough ; why that’s my savoury for to-night, ma’am! ” and sure enough, up came some tiny little souffles that evening evolved from scraps I should have thought any cook justified in emptying into Pussy’s plate. If we only realised it, servants are as fond of fancy work as their mistresses, and if you teach your cook to look on these little dishes as fancy work it will add enormously to the daintiness of your menu, whilst actually reducing the weekly sums inscribed in those dreadful red-covered “ weekly-books,” which are such a nightmare to most housewives. Only don’t begin encouraging this culinary embroidery on the score of economy, please! Admire their beauty, and their niceness, and so get her into the way of such things, and you will gradually find her amour- propre is wakened to the amusement of contriving into what shapes she can twist remnants that other- wise she would have denounced you as a skin flint for wishing to utilise.

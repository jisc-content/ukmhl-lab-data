45 CUTLETS, FILLETS, &c. prepared are egged, breadcrumbed, and fried, the farce having been previously laid on the side of the fillet. (Cutlets are also very good served in this way.) Finally, there is the Chateaubriand steak, which was originally a piece of rump or fillet steak cut about l|in. thick and placed between two pieces of ordinary steak about |in. thick, this being then broiled until the outside meat was all but a cinder, when it was served with the outer meat removed, and was found cooked just to perfection. This is, however, now simply an extra thick steak or filet, of which the outer sides are fairly scorched over a clear grill fire, leaving the centre rather underdone and very juicy ; it is then served with a tiny ball of maitre d’hotel butter placed on a hot dish underneath it, a similar ball being placed on top of each filet, and a demi- glace thickened with maitre d’hotel butter being served round it, together with souffle or straw potatoes. The above will give some idea of the different ways of serving fillets of beef, whilst of veal it may be said that almost any recipe given for either mutton or beef cutlets or fillets will suit veal; the following, however, is the conventional “ veal cutlet ”: Take either the “ noisettes ” from the best end of the neck as described for mutton, or a slice cut from the fillet about fin. thick, and shape this into rounds, batting these out neatly ; either flour these well or dip them in egg and breadcrumb, in either case frying them in clarified butter till of a pale golden brown, and perfectly cooked (underdone white meat is unpardon- able), which will take from twelve to fifteen minutes

ENTRIES. 214 ' Sauce JBearnaise.—Put into a pan three or four shallots, some roughly crushed allspice or black peppercorns, as you please, and a tiny bit of mace, pour to this a gill of tarragon vinegar and half a pint of water, and allow it to boil-in to half; then strain and leave it till cold. Strain three or four eggs into a pan, and stir them over a slow fire with enough of the above liquid to produce a rich custard, then stir in bit by bit 2oz. of fresh butter, and when these have all been worked in, sprinkle in a tea- spoonful of minced tarragon, and serve.

This sauce should be like mayon- naise in appearance and consistency. Indeed, it is often called “ hot mayonnaise.” Sauce a la ID'Orleans.—Bring to the boil two tablespoonfuls of the best Orleans vinegar, then add to it a full tablespoonful of rich espagnole sauce, and let this heat; now work into it bit by bit l^oz. to 2oz. of fresh butter, being careful not to add the next piece till the first is perfectly dissolved; then stir into it a dust of cayenne and of caster sugar, with a good pinch of finely minced parsley, and serve. Sauce Frangaise.—To the quantity of Bearnaise sauce given above add half a gill of good tomato puree, with an ounce of very strong chicken stock;

CHATJFROIX, &c. 1S5 truffles, when the dish becomes chaufroix de per- dreaux a la Demidoff. Tomates a VAlgerienne.â€”For these, properly speaking, you require tomato moulds, but, really, any pretty little shapes will do. Line whichever mould you choose with well-coloured tomato aspic, and fill with the following mince: Pound and rub through a wire sieve the breast of a cold cooked fowl (or an equivalent amount picked from the rest of the carcase); mix into this two tablespoonfuls each of veloute sauce and liquid aspic, stirring in lightly and quickly half a pint of stiffly whipped cream. When the tomato moulds are full press them closely together, and set them on ice for at least twenty minutes; they are then turned out and served on a border of aspic jelly with a good lettuce mayonnaise in the centre. Another dish of tongue and chicken may be made in much the same way; slice down a nice red tongue, and cut these slices into cutlet shapes ; have ready a puree of fowl prepared as for the tomato, only substituting four tablespoonfuls of mayonnaise aspic for the veloute and plain aspic jelly; add to this farce the remains of the cut up tongue, and, if at hand, either some sliced truffle or dice of pate de foie gras, setting this in little cutlet moulds ; mask both the tongue and the chicken cutlets with very clear aspic jelly, and dish them alternately round a pile of any nice mayonnaise. This is called in France Tranches de langue a Vecarlate. Any intelligent cook will find it easy to use up almost any scraps of meat, poultry, or game on the lines of the above recipes.

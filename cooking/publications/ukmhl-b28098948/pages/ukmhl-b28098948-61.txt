CUTLETS, FILLETS, Ac. 49 5oz. of chicken meat—that picked from the rest of the carcase will do—then mix it with 5oz,. of panade, also previously pounded, and work the two together in the mortar, seasoning it to taste with white pepper, salt, coralline pepper, and a very tiny grate of nutmeg; adding an ounce of fresh butter and the yolks of two eggs, to bind it all) ; now brush them over -with yolk of egg, and roll them in bread crumbs, half seasoned with minced truffles and half with grated ham; fry a delicate colour, and serve in a circle with a ragout of cucumber, stewed in cream sauce. Yeal, rabbit, &c., can be used thus. F. a la Cardinal.—Fillets cut as for supreme and cooked in the oven in a well buttered baking dish, with a squeeze of lemon juice, and covered with a buttered paper; they are then dished in a circle, the centre being filled with a ragout of truffles, and a sauce cardinals round; cardinal sauce is really a rich allemande sauce coloured to a delicate pink with crayfish or lobster butter. A shelled prawn is often laid in each fillet for this dish. F. aux huitres.—For this slice down the fillets rather thinly, and cook as in the previous recipe; then dish in a circle, filling the centre with a rich oyster sauce. (Some cooks spread a delicate oyster farce over the fillet and cover this with another, fixing tbem together by means of lardoons of seasoned fat bacon, and then cook as before.) F. a Vecarlate consists simply of fillets of chicken sautes and dished alternately with slices of very red cooked tongue, a rich allemande sauce being served round. E

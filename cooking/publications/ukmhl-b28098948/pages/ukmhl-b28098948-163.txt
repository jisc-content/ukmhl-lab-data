RECHAUFFES. 151 tied back into shape, and steamed or stewed in butter till cooked, then dished after removing- the tape, and served with any nice white sauce poured over them. Onions again are admirable stuffed. Peel and blanch some good equal-sized onions for fifteen minutes, then remove a little from the centre, and replace it with an equal quantity of good, highly-seasoned beef force-meat or sausage meat, binding this farce with an egg, or a nicely seasoned sheepâ€™s kidney may be used; arrange them on a buttered baking dish, strew a few browned breadcrumbs over them, and bake in a sharp oven till nicely browned. Serve very hot. Black game is excellent cooked thus, though any nice mince of cooked meat does well for it.

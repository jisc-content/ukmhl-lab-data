ENTRIES. 98 potato either browned in the oven or left white, or a casserole of rice answer admirably for these ragouts. For the casserole of rice well wash lib. of good rice, add to this a quart of water, with pepper and salt to taste, and cover with a good slice of bacon; when the rice is well burst and soft, pound it to a paste in a mortar, and when perfectly smooth (its beauty depends on this) roll it up into a ball and turn it on to a baking sheet covered with a sheet of buttered paper, and shape it into a plain round like a Char- lotte mould (chefs of course mould this rice into all kinds of shapes, but the above is quite enough to expect from the ordinary plain cook), and when quite smooth, brush it all over with liquefied butter, and set it in the oven till delicately browned; then scoop out the inside, leaving the sides fin. thick, and smoothing the inner surface with the back of a spoon previously dipped in hot water. This casse- role can be prepared some time beforehand, and keeps well if stored in a dry place. Some cooks butter moulds and fill them with the mashed potato or pounded rice and bake them till nicely coloured, turning them out and scooping the inside away when cooked. This of course saves trouble. These cases can manifestly be made any size required. Besides these, first rate cooks make butter cases for such ragouts as are given above; but, though I have known a so-called plain cook who made these to perfection, they are hardly within the scope of the average “ good plain cook.” I give the recipe, how- ever, for anyone bent on experiment.

F. de Veau d la Menagere.â€”Cook the liver exactly as in the preceding recipe, then strew over the meat a teaspoonful of finely chopped and well washed shallot, about twice as much well dried flour, and about a tablespoonful of finely minced parsley ; moisten this all with a full gill of wine, either white or red, and the same of stock, let it all boil up and serve at once. There are one or two recipes which are much appreciated in France, and may well come in here, though it is somewhat difficult to class them; such are, for instance, Lapin en Matelotte: Skin, well wash, and dry a rabbit, and cut it into neat joints, then fry it in batter with some mushrooms and a good-sized onion cut into rings; when lightly coloured and firm, dust it all well with flour and moisten it with a good gill each of wine and stock; then bring it to the boil and let it simmer gently till about halt cooked; now add to it a small eel, skinned and cut up, a spoonful of capers, and two or three well washed, boned, and minced anchovies; let this all simmer together till cooked, then pour it all on to a very hot dish, and serve garnished with croutons of fried bread.

The moulds used for this mixture must be well buttered, never more than three-quarters filled, and both covered with, and stood on a buttered jDaper, whilst the cooking must be carefully watched. In the case of all these light steamed mixtures it is well to cook a tiny portion first to see if you have really got the proportions right, as this saves disappointment later. Like souffles, &c., creams are cooked when the centre feels firm on being touched with the finger. Be very careful in turning any of these out, for if this is hurried, or the paper is torn away hastily, the sub- stance will certainly tear, whilst if a knife has to be used to loosen it at the sides it will look ragged and uneven.

L6 ENTREES. the hone, producing alternately a boned and a bone- less cutlet, all of the same thickness, and then care- fully remove the bones from the former; you will now have a chop as at Fig. 2. (You will see that, also like the surloin of beef, the loin of mutton possesses a miniature undercut (known in France as the filet mignon), shown at point A) Now bat this out as advised for cutlets. (Please remember— what too many cooks forget—that “ batting ” is not synonomous with mashing, but should be done gently and with discretion, or the cutlet, chop, or steak will be reduced to an unappetising and mangled mass of purplish red, anything but inviting, either to the eye or the palate.) When nicely batted, trim off all the skin, B B, together with as much of the fat as you judge convenient, either retaining all the undercut fat, and delicately skewering it round the lean part (previously gently pressed into shape with the wet knife), as at Fig. 3, or else removing it almost entirely, as at Fig 4. The latter is perhaps the best way of treating large mutton. The cutlets thus prepared are known as “ noisettes,” though strictly speaking the whole of the undercut is in French termed the “ noix,” and becomes noisettes when sliced straight down in rounds, or “ filets mignons ” when cut into longitudinal slices. These noisettes are also termed escalopes, grenadins, medallions, &c., according to the method of their serving, or at times, of their garnish; at the same time, these latter terms are nowadays more frequently applied to beef or veal, or even fish, than to mutton. These noisettes may be cooked when trimmed, by

Now trim it neatly, removing all superfluous fat and skin, leaving only an even layer or border of the former about |-in. thick all round as in Fig 1; then just where the lean meat stops make a straight cut right down to the bone, as at B D, and then clear the bone down to C from all flesh, skin, &c., scraping it nicely.

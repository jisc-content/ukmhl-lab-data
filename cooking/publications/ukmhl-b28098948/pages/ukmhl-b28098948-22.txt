10 ENTRIES. Every dish sliould be as daintiiy served and decorated as is consistent with its nature, and with the least amount of handling. Any garnish that suggests the “ pawing” (I can use no more refined phrase) of one’s food is distasteful, and no amount of so-called decoration will make up to the connois- seur for the repulsion such dishes evoke! Some years ago there was a craze (American I believe in origin) for coloured dinners, when every dish had to bear its share of a certain fixed scheme of colour. Now, such an idea is all very well when the colour chosen can be obtained naturally, as, say, a red and greeu, or a brown and cream mixture; but when it comes to the host’s liveries, or the hostess’s toilette being matched by the menu, it is carrying the idea too far, and is an atrocity one must admit, sorrow- fully, that women alone could have inaugurated.

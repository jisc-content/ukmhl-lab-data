TIMBALES, VOL-AU-YENT, PATTIES, &c. 95 meat, cooked poultry livers, and red pepper, with, pepper and salt to taste, some pieces of butter, and a very little stock from the stock pot; cover with another disc of the polenta, and bake for an hour. This may be made in just the same way with macaroni. (These dishes lend themselves most suc- cessfully to a vegetarian style, tomato sauce or vegetable stock replacing the meat sauces, whilst mushrooms, artichoke bottoms, &c., can be used instead of the meat itself.) Timbale de Macaroni a la Roviaine.â€”Line a well buttered mould which has been rather thickly sprinkled with vermicelli, with good lard paste, pressing this well home into the shape of the mould; have ready stewed a rabbit or an old fowl (or a corresponding amount of cooked veal, or other white meat, as long as it is lean) cat up small, 2oz. of boiled macaroni, and a little cooked vermicelli, all cut into inch lengths, 2oz. grated Parmesan cheese, a little very finely minced shallot or chives, pepper and salt to taste, and either a few blanched almonds or a handful of pignole, or fircone kernels (these are not indispensable adjuncts), mix these all lightly together and place in the mould; add from one- fourth to one-third of a pint of cream or new milk, cover with a round of the paste and bake for an hour. Turn out and serve with brown, white, or tomato sauce as you please. This, like a good many of the other timbales, is very nice if the ragout is packed into a well buttered pie dish, then covered with puff paste in the ordinary way, and baked like the common pie.

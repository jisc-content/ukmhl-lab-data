159 CHAUFROIX, &c. but it is most certainly, if carefully made, a very seductive one. For the meat jelly put into a delicately clean pan loz. of leaf gelatine, a pint of well flavoured stock (white or brown, according to the use you intend putting it to), a sliced onion, a bay leaf, a bunch of herbs, a few peppercorns and allspice mixed, and the white and shell of an egg, and bring these all very gently to the boil, whisking them well together till the boil is just reached, then run it all through a wanned jelly bag. It should be crystal clear, but if not, strain it through the bag again. How for the second version of this dish : Prepare the conventional white sauce of commerce, stiffen it with vigorously acidulated aspic jelly in the propor- tion of two parts aspic to one of white sauce, and with this mask thickly some slices cut from a cold fowl, either roast, boiled, or stewed, as may be con- venient, and when this first coating is set, glaze with the plain aspic, and serve, in all probability with slices of tinned tongueâ€™and canned peas, or a tinned macedoine. How, I do not for one moment assert that if carefully prepared this roughly described dish may not result in a distinctly appetising little entree on an emergency, and if the masking sauce is well flavoured, the aspic not unduly acid, and especially if the dish be modestly styled chicken in aspic, and tinned garnish be eschewed, it will meet with much approval, but a supreme en chaufroix, or en aspic, however nicely prepared, it simply is not, and never will be ! For an entree en aspic, the meat used may, or may not, have been cocked for the purpose. Of course.

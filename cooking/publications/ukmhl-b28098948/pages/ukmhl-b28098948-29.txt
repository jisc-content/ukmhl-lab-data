CUTLETS, FILLETS, &c. 17 any of the methods advised for cutlets, and fuller directions for their treatment are given below Another method, and one much to be recommended when they are to be used cold en chaufroix, or mayonnaise, is to have them stewed. For this purpose the whole of the best end of the neclc or loin should be put into the pan with vegetables, stock, seasoning, spice, Ac., and then gently braised till cooked, when it is lifted out and allowed to get quite cold. It is then cut into cutlets, and these are trimmed and served egged and crumbed; or coated with rich forcemeat on both sides ; either wrapped in paper cases (en papilottes) and broiled, or used cold as they are en chaufroix or cn mayonnaise. By far the most difficult method of cooking cutlets is to broil them, and it is one that requires much practice, though at the same time it is well worth the trouble, as it is undoubtedly the most delicate way of serving them, the crisp, fresh, burnt taste, always characteristic of a broil, harmonising with and enhancing any garnish with which it may be served. The proper method is as follows: Have a delicately clean and bright gridiron, and rub its bars lightly with a morsel of suet; see that your fire is clear as well as sharp; then dip each cutlet singly in some hot butter, melted, or, better still, into good salad oil, and lay each on the grid, allowing the latter to be very near the fire at first so as to let the surface of the meat catch (though without actually burning), thus sealing up the pores, and keeping in the juice of the meat. Turn them frequently whilst cooking (they will take about eight to ten minutes), c

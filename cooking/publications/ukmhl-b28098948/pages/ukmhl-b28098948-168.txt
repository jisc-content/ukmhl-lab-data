ENTREES. 156 1 its presence beyond the dainty firmness, and the delicate glazy surface it imparts. But this delicacy is the outcome of knowledge and care, and as its use descended to those who possessed neither that know- ledge nor that care, only the result, i.e., the stiffness of such sauces, was noted, and as to such persons gelatine was gelatine, and cost was a consideration, sufficient attention was not bestowed on the quality of the stiffening substance; so when carelessly melted (more or less) in boiling sauce, it was discovered to be lumpy, and very often distressingly rough and gluey in flavour; accordingly a substitute was sought for and discovered in the bottled aspic jelly offered by various enterprising firms as a garnish, in which the rough taste of the gelatine was hidden by the flavouring. This being convenient, was accordingly added recklessly to any sauce that was to be used cold, regardless of the nature of the latter. As a matter of fact the strong taste of vinegar, flavoured or plain, which is such a marked characteristic of aspic jelly, is absolutely destructive of the delicacy of any sauce of which acidity is not a feature, overpowering as it does the natural savour of the foundation condiment.

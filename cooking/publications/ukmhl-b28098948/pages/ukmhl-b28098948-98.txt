ENTRIES. 86 and a vol-au-vent is that the latter is always made with puff paste, and is allowed to rise to the fullest capacity of the paste ; whereas, for a timbale, short paste is used, well pricked to prevent its rising, and is made in a mould, in which the timbale crust is kept till the last minute. For the paste take |lb. of fine sifted flour, 4oz. butter, half a teaspoonful of salt, the yolk of an egg and about a gill of water (this depends a good deal on the flour) ; make a well or hollow in the flour (technically called a “ bay ”), and into this put the egg, salt, butter, and two-thirds of the water, and with your fingers work this all to a rather firm dough; next dip your fingers into the flour to free them from the paste sticking to them, sprinkle a little more water over it, and work it up till it comes clear away from the sides of the basin in a ball; then throw a doubled cloth over the basin till the paste is wanted, when you roll it out, and with it line a well buttered mould, pressing the paste well to take the shape sharply (one of the jointed moulds with hinged sides, is the nicest for this, as the timbale when cooked can be more readily and safely turned out), prick it well all over, put a sheet of paper inside and fill this with rice, &c., and bake; a cover to match should be prepared from puff paste, and cooked with the timbale. Formerly, a timbale was cooked in a stewpan, and, indeed, properly it is a form of pie, mostly served cold. Another method is to line a mould with the crust, as described above, then pack it with whatever you mean to fill it with, generally a rich ragout of chicken, macaroni, cream, Parmesan

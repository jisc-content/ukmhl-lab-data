Next to oil undoubtedly comes beef dripping, a medium objected to, however, greatly by many so-called “high class cooks,” partly through ignorance, partly through a dishonest fear of loss, as such persons appear to consider the sale of the household dripping a perquisite quite compatible with a character for honesty!

White sauces depend for their flavour a good deal on the little additions made to them in the process of finishing off, as they are developed into their separate divisions ; but brown sauce must taste fairly strongly of good, well flavoured stock, though no actual distinctive flavouring must be permitted when it is simply to serve as the foundation of richer and more intricate sauces, such as poivrade, browu Italienne, Ac.

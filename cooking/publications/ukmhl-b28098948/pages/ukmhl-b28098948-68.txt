Meanwhile cook the fillets of the hare, pre- viously sliced down and batted out neatly, in butter, wine, and stock, in the usual way under a buttered paper in the oven. Get ready the sauce by pour- ing what you have left of the stock on to a couple of ounces or so of brown roux, letting this cook together for about ten minutes till slightly reduced and thickened, then wring it through a tammy or a fine hair sieve, and re-heat in the bain-marie, adding to it half a gill of port wine, a tablespoon ful of red currant jelly, and some dried cherries (allowing three or four for each fillet), with a seasoning of salt and coralline pepper; let this all simmer together

Next the cold sauces, required for cliaufroiz and other cold dishes, must be considered. These in the present day the average “ good cook ” generally produces by mixing to a given proportion of any sauce required a certain amount of aspic jelly in a state of liquefaction: the two are then boiled—or not boiled, as the cook fancies—till somewhat reduced, when they are poured over the article to be covered or “masked” (as it is technically termed), when just on the point of setting. Now this certainly produces a very nice liquid for masking purposes—especially when the reduction has been attended to—but for high class cookery such a sauce tastes too strongly of vinegar to be judged altogether correct by the gourmet. If you are giving a dish, say, of quails en aspic, then by all means use this aspic-stiffeued sauce; but where it is simply a case of a chaufroix, the sauce chosen should be thickened bv reduction or boiling-in till stiff enough to coat any piece of meat, &c., by its own density.

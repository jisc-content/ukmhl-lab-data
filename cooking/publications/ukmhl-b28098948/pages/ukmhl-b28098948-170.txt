158 ENTRIES. of the very best leaf gelatine (I always use Mrs. A. B. Marshall’s gelatine, as for these delicate pre- parations the most easily soluble and most tasteless kind is indispensable) for each pint of sauce; let it all boil together till reduced about one-fourth, then add a gill of double cream for each pint of sauce, and use just as it is setting. Put the pan containing this sauce in another half full of warm (not boiling) water to keep it just at setting point, lift each fillet separately on a broad-bladed or palette knife, and pour over it (or “ mask ” it, as it is technically called) the stiffen- ing sauce from a spoon, being careful to cover it all thickly and smoothly, and then leave it till set. The masking must then be repeated, only this time use meat jelly prepared as below instead of the sauce, to ensure the surface being nicely glazed. When set, dish the fillets neatly in a circle alternately with sliced tongue, foie gras tniffe, or plain truffles as you choose, filling up the centre with turned and farced olives, tiny cubes of foie gras, salad, &c., to taste, either with a plain or a mayonnaise salad dressing, and serve. If you prepare a supreme in this way and mount it on a border mould of cold chicken cream set in a mould lined with the chicken jelly, and fill up the centre with oysters bearded, and tossed in white mayonnaise and crisped celery, serving it as Supreme a VAmericaine, you will score a distinct success. I do not recommend this as an economy, for, as I have observed before, a supreme can never, from its nature, be anything but an expensive dish (though properly managed as I have also previously shown, it need not be extravagant),

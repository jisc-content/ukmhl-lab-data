Where wine is required, though vintage wines need not be em- ployed, good sound liquor, however light, is indis- pensable, and is, moreover, easily procured by those who care to look for it. Corked, soured, or stale wine is absolute destruction; sour, coarse stock is distinctly unwholesome; whilst roux made of inferior flour and bad butter can never be anything but disagreeable, and if stale from overkeeping is pretty sure to be indigestible. Roughly speaking, brown sauce is simply melted butter made with well-flavoured brown stock, but espagnole is somewhat differently prepared: Fry together a carrot, turnip, two or three green onions, a tomato or two, and some mush- rooms if handy, all sliced or roughly chopped, a bunch of herbs, and a good slice of lean smoked ham, in butter or clarified dripping till nicely coloured (a very tiny pinch of caster sugar sprinkled over all this is declared by many chefs to improve both the appearance and the flavour of the subse- quent sauce) ; then moisten it either with rich brown stock, or good brown sauce (in the former case when boiled up it must be blended with a spoonful or two of the brown roux) and boil it up sharply till reduced a fourth part; now tammy or sieve it, adding a little sherry or Madeira, lemon juice, and seasoning to taste, let it just boil up and as you pour it into the scalded-out sauce boat, add a small piece of butter, which should dissolve on its way to the dining-room.

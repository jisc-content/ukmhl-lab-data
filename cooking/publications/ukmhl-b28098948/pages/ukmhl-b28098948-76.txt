In fact souffles once mastered, form a dainty and invaluable method of using up all sorts of scraps that would otherwise be wasted, and for that reason should really form an important part of the succeeding chapter on rechauffes. However, for gala use, the meat should always be raw, and if possible sieved after pounding, though for ordinary household use this rather troublesome process may be omitted; but any way care must be bestowed on the smoothness of the pounding. Mousses differ from souffles by their lightness, as for the above proportions four egg yolks should be used, and a good spoonful or two of stiffly whipped cream should replace one of the egg whites.

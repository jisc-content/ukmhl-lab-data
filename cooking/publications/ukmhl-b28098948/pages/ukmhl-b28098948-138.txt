126 ENTRIES. by having everything wanted at hand; have the basin of batter, covered with a cloth, at your side, and arrange the objects to be dipped in it neatly on a plate or dish, after carefully draining off the marinade. Have ready the fat, which should have reached the point of being perfectly still, with a very thin blue vapour just beginning to rise (if this vapour is too evident the friture is too hot, and anything put into it will burn) ; test the fat by throwing in a small piece of breadcrumb, and if it frizzles up, producing large air bubbles, andbrowns in under a minute, the fat is ready, and the fritters should be dropped in gently at once, being careful to have each one thoroughly covered with the fat. You should always use a wire fiying baslcet for this purpose, but if you do not possess one (which, however, every well arranged kitchen should do, as they are anything but costly utensils), lift each fritter out with a skimmer, and hold it over the pan for a minute or two to let the fat drain off; then at once lay it on a sheet of clean kitchen or blotting paper, or on a clean cloth. (Some cooks set the fritters as done on a wire drainer and stand them for a moment or two in the mouth of the oven or on the kitchen fender.) When quite dry dish them on a hot dish, piling them up and dusting them well with minced parsley, coralline pepper, &c., as you please. Remember not to crowd your pan; only so many should be fried at once as the pan will hold comfortably; but be sure and let the fat cool a little before putting in the next lot, or they will be burnt. Be sure to strain your fat each time after using it, by letting it cool for twelve or fifteen

ENTRIES. 62 perfectly amalgamated, when yon dilute them with a gill of water, millc, or good stock (this varies accord- ing to the meat used, as brown or espagnole sauce for brown meat or game; veloute, or bechamel for chicken or any white meat; or fish stock for fish), let this cook over the fire very gently (being careful not to let it colour if for white meat), for eight or ten minutes, to insure the flour being perfectly cooked; then stir in the minced or pounded meat (using your judgment as to whether you add 3|oz. or 4oz., according to its solidity) with seasoning and flavouring to taste, and lastly the yolks separately, stirring one well in before adding in the next; and lastly stir in quickly and lightly the whites of the eggs whisked to a very stiff froth, and at once pour it all into the papered souffle tin or case, and set it in a sharp, but not fierce oven ; as, though this must be hot enough to raise the souffle quickly, it must not be so hot as to darken the surface too rapidly at first; in fact, after a few minutes the heat may be slightly slackened. The quantities given will require about half an hornâ€™s cooking. The mixture rises enormously in the cooking, therefore the case (whether tin, china, or paper, and about 5in. across, and 4in. deep) should not be more than half full to start with, and should have a band of well-buttered, stiffish paper (projecting fully 2in. above the edge of the case), firmly tied or fastened round it to prevent the contents of the mould running over and wasting. (See Fig. 12 of papered mould.) If preferred the above mixture may be cooked in small paper or china cases instead of one large

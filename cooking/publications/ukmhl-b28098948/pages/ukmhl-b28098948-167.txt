This, however, was necessarily a somewhat costly method of preparing sauces, and only suited to the households of such as could afford to postpone considerations of economy to the gratification of their palates. So as demo- cracy spread even into the kitchen, cooks learnt first to utilise stiff meat jelly (made from inferior joints and bones) for the foundation of their sauces, and thus diminished the boiling-in process needed to ensure the density of the preparation; and then latterly, even well known chefs availed themselves of the stiffening properties of isinglass, and later on of the finest leaf gelatine.

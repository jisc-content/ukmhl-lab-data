Curries.—The meat for curry should properly be freshly cooked for the purpose, but very palatable dishes of this kind may be made with cooked meat, granted a little care. For the ordinary form pre- pare a nice curry sauce (see sauces), and when ready lay in the meat cut into neat pieces, with some hard- boiled eggs, either sliced or quartered, and leave it to soak in this for as long a time as you can afford ; when wanted heat very gently without allowing it actually to cook, and serve very hot with a dish of boiled rice. Few people realise how easy it is to re- serve curry. Let the curry left over stand in its dish, in its own gravy, till wanted, then stir in half an ounce each of butter and delicately fried onion, a teaspoonful of curry fried in the pan in which the onions were cooked, and a gill or so of milk, reheat gently, and you will be astonished to find what a tempting dish it will make. Another way of utilising the remains of a curry is the dry curry. For this lift the pieces of meat out of the curry with just so much sauce as will stick to them; melt half an ounce or so of butter (or even clarified dripping) in a pan, and lay in the meat, rather wide apart so that the pieces do not touch, and let them evaporate over a very slow fire, stirring them gently with a delicately clean wooden spoon, till the sauce becomes dry and powdery, when the meat will be ready.

About |oz. to foz. of the gelatine to the pint of sauce will be sufficient, according to the density to which you have reduced the latter. This addition, though giving body and adhesiveness to the sauce does not affect its flavour as would aspic, which always, from its nature, must impart a strong acid taste to whatever it is mixed with. So I would ask my readers to understand that unless the word aspic is mentioned in connec- tion with any dish where cliaufroix is named, it implies that the sauce—whatever its nature—is simply stiffened with from -|oz. to foz. of Mrs. A.

Before concluding this chapter a few words or so must be said regarding garnishes.

Such things are all very well for a wager, but are not high class cookery, in any shape or form.

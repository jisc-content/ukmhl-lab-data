CHAPTER XI. SAUCES. The question of sauces is always a puzzle, "both to the average cook and to her mistress, and it cannot unfortunately he asserted that either can answer it satisfactorily. Even plain melted butter, simple as it really is, appears to present enormous difficulties, judging by the results only too frequently seen in the national sauce boats. Yet without sauces, and well-made ones at that, few, if any, entrees are possible. The secret of this failure is in almost all cases the insufficient cooking of the flour and butter founda- tions. Unless the flour is thoroughly cooked every sauce built upon this foundation will have a raw, harsh flavour, which nothing will eradicate entirely.

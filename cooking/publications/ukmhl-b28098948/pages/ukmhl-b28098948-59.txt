47 CUTLETS, FILLETS, &c. cutlets for egg and crumbing, and dust these well on both sides with salt and quatre ejrices, or pepper and a very little grated nutmeg ; have ready a mix- ture made by mincing finely a good slice of bacon, a shallot, and a spray or two of parsley and tarragon, mixing this well with one raw egg, then spread a layer of this mince over each cutlet, and brush it over afterwards with the yolk of an egg; sprinkle a well buttered baking dish with finely grated bread crumbs seasoned with a little salt and white pepper, and lay in the cutlets side by side, moistening them with half a gill each of stock and of claret, and let them bake till cooked, which they will be, when the stock, &c., is nearly all absorbed. Three well-known German dishes must be mentioned, as they belong to the fillet and cutlet genus. The first is Wiener schnitzel. For these cut the veal into rather thin fillets, rub these well with pepper and salt, and dip them into a good but rather light batter (or, if pre- ferred, beaten egg yolk), then into crushed rusks {zwieback), and fry a golden brown in plenty of butter or lard. Serve well drained, sprinkled with a squeeze of lemon juice, and a garnish of fried eggs, capers, and filletted sardines arranged in a kind of trellis over all. Gulasch: Cut about a lb. of nice fillet of veal (free from all skin, sinew, &c.) into dice; cut up two small potatoes and one apple, washed and peeled in the same way, and mince down 4oz. of bacon. Melt l|oz. fresh butter and fry in this half an onion finely minced, till slightly coloured, then lay in the minced veal, seasoning it with salt and pepper, and cook it gently for ten minutes over

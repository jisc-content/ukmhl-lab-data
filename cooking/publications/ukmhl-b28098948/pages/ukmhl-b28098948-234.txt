222 ENTREES. the whites of two eggs, pour over it a quart of warm water, and a short gill of brown vinegar; bring this gently to the boil, whisking it a little at the first to mix the ingredients well, and when it boils up, strain it through a warm jelly bag. It should be quite clear, but if not, run it through the bag a second time. (The meat aspic jelly is made in precisely the same way, only substituting a quart of well flavoured stock for the water.) This jelly will be pretty stiff, as it is intended for borders; if only needed for garnishing and chopping l|oz. to 2oz. of gelatine will be found ample. (It may be observed that if aspic jelly is not in constant use it will be best to strain it through a clean napkin instead of the jelly bag, as the vegetables, vinegar, &c., might give an un- pleasant flavour to any sweet jelly run through the bag afterwards, however carefully the latter is scalded out.) Be careful of the temperature of the liquid added to the ingredients, for if too hot, or boiling as some cooks advise, it will curdle and set the egg whites at once and not clear well. Whisking the jelly too long, i.e., after it has nearly reached boiling point; using a greasy or dirty pan, or allowing the gelatine to touch anything greasy, are both causes of clouding. To chop aspic, sprinkle a sheet of white paper well with cold water, and cut up the aspic with a well wetted knife, on this; sprinkling it with a very little more cold water if necessary, and chop as fine as possible, for the finer it is the more brilliant it will be. If to be put on with a forcing bag and pipe, be sure the latter are well wetted before putting in the jelly, or it will not

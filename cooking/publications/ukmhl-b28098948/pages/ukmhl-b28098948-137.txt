It should be remembered when oil is used that it must be very slowly heated, and be kept all the time at as low a temperature as is compatible with its use. Having settled your pan and your frying medium, the next thing to consider is the batter. For this mix the yolks of two eggs with two tablespoonf uls of good salad oil, and then work into this carefully and smoothly about 3|oz. of fine sifted flour, and half a saltspoonful of salt; when you have got this to a perfectly smooth paste add to it gradually enough tepid water to bring it to a smooth batter, that when finished will coat the spoon you use in mixing it sufficiently to hide the material of which the spoon is made whilst showing its shape. (If too thick, thin it carefully with a little more tepid water till you get it right.) This batter should be well beaten for ten minutes after mixing (at which time it should be a thick sauce), and as soon as ready should be set aside in a fairly warm corner, carefully covered with a doubled cloth, and allowed to stand at least two- hours before use. Just as it is to be used, stir into the batter lightly and quickly the white of one egg whipped to the stillest possible froth with a dust of salt. There are many forms of batter, and almost every household has its own special make, but the above will be found excellent for savoury use of all kinds, and the quantities given are sufficient for a small dish of fritters.

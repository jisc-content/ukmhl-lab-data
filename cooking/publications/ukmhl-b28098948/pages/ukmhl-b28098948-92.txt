It is always advisable when preparing this dish to poach a little in a small mould, so as to be sure of having the consistency right. Pain a la Nemours.—Prepare a rich creme mixture with the flesh of two or three partridges (reserving, however, the breast of one), using a reduced Sauce Madere instead of the usual white sauce ; fill the plain, well-buttered mould with this (or a timbale mould is prettier), and poach or steam for three-quarters of an hour; just before serving it slice down the breast previously set aside, and cook these slices in the oven in a well-buttered baking tin, seasoning them with a little sherry, pepper, and salt; turn out the mould and pour over it a very smooth Perigueux sauce, have ready heated a bottle of Financiere garnish, mix the cooked fillets with this, arrange this all in little heaps round the mould, and serve at once. Pain de Lievre.—Take the fillets from the back of a good hare, cutting each fillet into three or four pieces, as you please, trimming them neatly, and larding them with tiny lardoons of par-boiled bacon, arrange these on a buttered baking tin with a little claret or port wine, pepper, and salt, and cover them with a buttered paper. With the rest of the flesh make a creme farce, fill a border mould with it, being careful the mixture settles down well into the tin, and poach for twenty-five or thirty minutes according to the size of the mould; just about ten minutes before it is ready, cook the little fillets in the oven

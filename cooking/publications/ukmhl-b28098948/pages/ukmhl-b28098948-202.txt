190 ENTRIES. a couple of jars containing white and brown roux respectively. Uoux is practically the French synonym for thickening, and being used in the first instance for the stronger-flavoured brown sauces, was always of a chestnut brown, or roux colour. When, how- ever, economy in labour and material suggested the advisability of replacing in white sauces the costly process of reduction by a thickening differing only in colour from that used for the darker, fuller flavoured condiments, a roux blanc was invented; a contradiction in terms doubtless, but an intelligible one all the same. Both are very easily prepared, and, as said before, add greatly both to the cook’s success and to the saving of labour. To begin with a roux brun—put into a pan from 4oz. to 6oz. of butter, and melt this very gently over a clear, slow fire, stirring into it as it melts an equal quantity of fine, sifted flour, and allow it to cook gently over the fire till it assumes a soft, even, fawn colour ; the slower it is cooked the better it will be, as if in the least hurried it will most likely burn, or, at any rate, catch, and will develope a spotty colour, and an acrid, harsh flavour, which no subsequent dosing with wine, cruet sauces, &c., will ever entirely overcome. When it has reached the required colouring, which will probably take fully half an hour, if not more, a slight seasoning of salt should be added to it (do not overdo this, as it is only used as a preservative, the actual seasoning of the sauce being added later). This paste will keep in a cool place for several days, and may be used as required thus—take out with a spoon the amount you need (remembering that a 1

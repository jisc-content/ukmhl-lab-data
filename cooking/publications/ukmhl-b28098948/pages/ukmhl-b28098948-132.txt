Choose your meat, what- ever it may be, and remember, if thriftily inclined, that the more kinds of meat used the merrier. Remove all skin, sinew, gristle, and a good deal of the fat, and chop it up as finely as possible with a sharp chopping knife; add to it a fifth of the quantity of meat, of sausage meat, and half as much breadcrumbs as you have sausage meat, seasoning it with pepper, salt, and a little parsley. Now put into a pan a nice piece of butter, according to the amount of meat you have, and, as soon as this melts, lay in a finely chopped shallot or a small onion, and let it brown delicately, keeping it stirred in the process.

Then turn into it the meat, &c., sprinkle it with a teaspoonful of fine flour, and keep it well stirred over the fire for five minutes, at all events (more if you have a rather large quantity of meat), then pour into it from half a gill of good stock upwards, according to quantity, and let it cook very gently over a slow fire for half an hour, when you add a tiny squeeze of* lemon juice, and serve garnished with fried croutons, plain or spread with savoury butter.

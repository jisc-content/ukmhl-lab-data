Marshall’s leaf gelatine is used, as this, in addition to its undoubted and guaranteed strength and purity, needs no previous soaking, dissolving very readily in a very little hot liquid. Where other gelatines are used a previous soaking in cold water is always necessary, and nearly half as much again in quantity should be used. Whenever gelatine is used the utmost care should be taken to have it thoroughly dissolved, for if not, itwill coagulate and form gluey lumps through the mixture, giving a ■disagreeable, raw, and gluey flavour to the whole thing; a flavour, moreover, generally laid to the •account of the gelatine, whereas it is most usually the result of carelessness on the cook’s part. Macaroni, to Boil.—The great thing to remember about this is that macaroni must be put on in plenty •of boiling water and kept at the boil all the time it is cooking, adding sufficient salt with the macaroni. Directly the paste is cooked dash into the saucepan •containing it a tumbler or more of ice cold water to throw it oft: the boil, and drain off the macaroni at once. It is difficult to say how long it will take to cook, as this depends a good deal on the size and quality of the macaroni itself. From twenty to thirty minutes, however, is a fair guide; but the best way is to try it by biting a morsel of it. If it bites soft, yet short, it is cooked, and the sooner it leaves the pan the better. In England macaroni is systematically overcooked, when it is woolly and pappy. All macaronis and pastes are cooked thus, and too much water cannot be given.

TIMBALES, YOL-AU-VENT, PATTIES, &c. 93 have cheese, then lay into this mixture some poultry livers, bits of game or poultry, pieces of ham, &c. (you really can put in pretty much what you please), and let it all simmer together very gently forty to forty-five minutes. Now dot some morsels of butter over the bottom of the paste-lined timbale, sprinkle this with grated cheese and a little pepper, and then lay in the mixture you have been cooking, cutting the macaroni into lfin. lengths and dusting each layer lightly with cheese, pour over it any gravy you may have left, cover over with more jaaste, pinching the edges well together, and bake for half an hour. Then turn out and serve plain or with rich gravy. This dish may be varied almost indefinitely. For instance, T. a la Napolitaine, Avhen tomato sauce diluted with gravy is used instead of pure gravy, and stewed beef cut into neat pieces, cubes of fat and lean bacon, and herb-farce meat balls are stirred into the macaroni, the whole being finished off as before; T. alia romana, when tiny sausages, the breasts of any little birds, cooked brains, &c., are all mixed into the gravy-steeped macaroni, and the whole is again finished off as before. Another form of filling is with raviolis; for this you need nouille paste made with -^lb. fine flour, half a tec spoonful of salt, the yolks of fdur raw eggs, and sufficient milk or water to bring it all to a stiff paste; roll this out very thin, then cut it into oblongs about 2in. or 3in. long by lin. to l|in. wide; put into each of these a spoonful of finely minced meat, raw or cooked, rather highly seasoned with herbs, &c., and moistened with a little gravy,

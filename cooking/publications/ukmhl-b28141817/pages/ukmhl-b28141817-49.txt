37 FISH AND FISH SAUCES. little flour, a great deal of butter, if possible, fish stock should take the place of water, and the liquor of the shell fish should be added thereunto, while care must be taken that the sauce does not boil, or the oysters will be tough. The addition of lemon, nutmeg, or anchovy is a matter of taste. Another old English sauce which has its merits when served with boiled cod, whiting, or haddock is egg sauce. The eggs should be divided into eight parts, not chopped fine, and the melted butter should be made rich, clear, and transparent, with a delicate dash of lemon-juice ; and here I may add by way of paren- thesis anent melted butter, how odd it is, considering this sauce is supposed to be our sole invention and idea in the line, that we so seldom meet with it well made. It is not the fault of cookery books ; in most of these one finds a reliable recipe for melted butter, which, if tried, would prove excellent in its results ; it is the fault of cooks. They will think melted butter is better made with milk than with water, whereas the former entirely prevents the transparency which should dis- tinguish this sauce ; they will, when induced to use water, have it hot instead of cold, mix it with flour first into a lumpy paste, and then add a piece of butter, which naturally floats on the top of the mixture in oil, instead of being incorporated therewith, as it is if the right sequence is followed, by the butter and flour being first kneaded together into a perfectly smooth paste, and the cold water added thereunto. They will consider five minutes ample time for the concoction of melted butter, whereas a quarter of an hour at least of gentle simmering, stirring, and lifting is needed to destroy the rawness of the flour, and to give the sauce that clearness and smoothness which are the charms of well-made melted butter.

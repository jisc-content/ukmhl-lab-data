79 CURRIES. curry powder, another of curry paste, two cloves of garlic, a little fresh fennel, bay leaf, and ground ginger and cinnamon. Simmer these very slowly by the side of the fire for three or four hours, then add a teacup- ful of freshly-grated cocoanut, a small tablespoonful of tamarinds, a few drops of tarragon vinegar or lemon- juice, and a lump of white sugar. This curry needs really no more moisture or thickening, but if the first be desired, cocoanut milk should be used, if possible, or, if there be none, ordinary milk—never stock or water ; while for thickening, a little rice boiled to a pulp is best. The curry sauce may be rubbed through a sieve or not, as thought best (I myself prefer it left as it is), and two hours before serving, the meat, fish, or vegetables should be added, and the whole allowed to simmer very slowly by the side of the fire till it is needed. If it be an egg curry, half an hour will be long enough to allow the eggs to cook in the sauce. The remains of such a curry will make an excellent mulligatawny soup the next day, if added to some stock, and slightly thickened with ground rice. The best of all curries is prawn, and close on that comes crab or lobster, either of which is delicious, when prepared as a dry curry, by leaving the fish to dry and flake in the sauce by the side of the fire till all moisture is consumed, and it looks like a heap of fine light-brown filaments. This is not a dish, however, which can be ordered at a minute’s notice, as it takes forty-eight hours to prepare. Shrimp curry is a very fair substitute for the more costly prawn, and scallops also make an excellent curry, but should be cut up previously into two or three pieces each, as otherwise they are apt to be tough. Fish curries, not of shell fish, do not rank high as a rule, but eels make a very good and rich dish, properly prepared.

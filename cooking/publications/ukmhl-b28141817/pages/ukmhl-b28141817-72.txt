A fowl stuffed and roasted in this fashion will be a welcome relief from the eternal roast chicken with bread sauce, of which we are most of us weary. A spatcli-cocked chicken, served with fine fresh mushrooms and well- fried potatoes, is one of the distinctive triumphs of English cookery. Boiled chicken is a different thing, if a handful of tarragon be stuffed into it before cooking, and a clear tarragon sauce poured over it when it is done ; while a puree of endive may be mentioned as going specially well with a fowl so dressed. All kinds of poultry or game are delicious cooked gipsy fashionâ€”i. e. fried in a stewpan with bacon, a little butter, and a clove of garlic, then stewed slowly with two Spanish onions, four tomatoes, and a large glass of sherry (a little sweet red Spanish pepper is an improve- ment). Another dish of Southern origin is duck stewed whole with olives, than which there are few things better. Duck stewed with lettuce and peas is also excellent, but the bird must be cooked separately from the vegetables. A wrinkle with regard to duck roasted in the ordinary fashion, with sage and onion stuffing, is to finish it, when it is on the table, by scoring it deeply with the carving-knife, and scattering into the furrows so formed salt and white or black pepper, then pouring over it a glass or two of Burgundy (previously warmed, not heated, so that it may not chill the duck). Baste the bird for a few moments with the wine, and then cover it up, so that the seasoning may soak in for a minute or two. If the process is novel to you, the results will be a revelation. A fricandeau of veal forms an excellent remove ; and a veal cutlet of 1| lbs. weight, cut four times the

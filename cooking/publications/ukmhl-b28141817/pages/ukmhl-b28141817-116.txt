104 DINNERS IN MINIATURE. For iced souffles or biscuits an ice cave is necessary, and it is less trouble than a machine, if iced asparagus, curry, &c. are needed. There are regular machines for crushing ice, wherein to freeze your ices, or to serve between an outer silver dish and a glass one containing a mayonnaise, or to set oysters on ; but in default of such conveniences a rough and ready plan, which answers perfectly well, is to keep a bag of coarse sack- ing in which to place the ice, already roughly splintered with an ordinary ice-breaker ; draw the strings of the bag tight, and hammer on the ice within it hard with a large wooden mallet. By this means the ice can be pounded as line as you please in a very short time. Small moulds are more in fashion now than large ones, but do not choose them of too fanciful or peculiar a design, or you will soon grow dead sick of them. Darioles are really the most useful. A Savarin mould is a capital thing, not only applied to its own use, but for jellies, aspics, &c. The simpler cake tins are the better, and for scolloped oysters, &c., the little French brown china pipkins have quite usurped the place of the real scollop shells. For egg-beaters I prefer the Dover for general use, but small whisks made of loops of wire are necessary for clearing jellies, aspics, soup, whipping iced souffles, Savoy batter, &c., and for making meringues, no plan is really as sure and safe as beating the whites of eggs on a plate with the blade of a knife.

Despite this, their services are very valuable; canapes of all lands are easier to arrange with their aid, and so are cake icings, &c. Meringues and eclairs can be prettily shaped with them, and rose forcing-pipes of

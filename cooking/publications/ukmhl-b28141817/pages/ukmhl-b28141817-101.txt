89 SAVOURIES. very acceptable item of the second course, while eggs. “scrambled” with tomatoes are delicious. If there is nothing ready which can be mixed with buttered eggs, they should be served on an anchovy toast, or one spread with either potted meat or fish, or some of the old- fashioned smoked Hamburg beef grated. Time would fail to mention but a few of the other ways of doing eggs; “a la cocotte,” baked in little china cases with butter ; “a l’Aurore,” or “au gratin,” with cheese ; “ a la maitre d’hotel,” hard boiled, cut in slices, and heated in a very rich maitre d’hotel sauce, made from bechamel —all these are good, and the addition of truffles makes the last named a special dainty. Plovers’ eggs also should, I think, come before the sweets, however they are served. Dressed crabs and iced savoury souffles should perhaps be included under the head of mayonnaises, but may be mentioned here as very excellent cold second-course dishes. No one can prepare a dressed crab so well as the fishmonger, and it is therefore better to order it from him ready to serve. Iced souffles are easy to make and delicious to taste. Cold fish, flesh, or fowl, torn lightly into small shreds, should be mixed with some well-seasoned mayonnaise sauce. A layer of this mixture should be spread at the bottom of a china souffle dish, and covered with some aspic jelly, whipped into a stiff froth ; then another layer of the mixture, followed by more jelly, till the mould is full. It should be buried in ice for two hours, and served with some chopped aspic jelly covering the top. Salmon or crab is excellent dressed in this way. Cheese fondus, souffles, ramequins, &c. are capital savouries, and a careful housekeeper will see that all trimmings of paste left over in pie or tart making are made into cheese sticks or such trifles.

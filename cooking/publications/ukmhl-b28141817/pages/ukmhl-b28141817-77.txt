SALADS AND MAYONNAISES. Go A good dressing for this kind of salad (a little more elaborate than the ordinary French vinaigrette) consists of two tablespoonfuls of salad oil, one dessertspoonful of tarragon vinegar, one small teaspoonful of anchovy essence (or, better still, of Osbornâ€™s paste), half a small teaspoonful of raw mustard, and a pinch of powdered sugar, salt and white pepper being added with dis- cretion.

The mixture above prescribed will be found available for all kinds of salads, except mayonnaises. In fact, many people will prefer this simple dressing to the richer mayonnaise, even for Russian or Italian salads.

The rules for lettuce salads apply equally to the similar salads of endive, Batavian, watercress, mustard and cress, barbe de capucine, &c., all included under the generic term, green salad. These are principally suited to serving with cold meat, poultry, or fish. Salads consisting of cooked vegetables generally now F

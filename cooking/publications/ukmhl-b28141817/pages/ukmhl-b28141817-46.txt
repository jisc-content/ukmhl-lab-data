34. DINNERS IN MINIATURE. When clear soup ia served, a small dish of grated Parmesan may be handed round with it, and also powdered sugar, if liked. Fried croutons, with purees, should be very daintily cut, and fried a light gold brown, and not more than the third of an inch square. They may be prepared early in the day, and made hot in the oven. Celery salt in a caster is acceptable to many people, especially with purees. Parmesan is also served with tomato or Italian soups, and another good addition to these latter is the trimmings of cheese sticks, rolled out thin, stamped with the tiniest of tin cutters into discs or crescents, and baked of a light gold-brown. I have forgotten to say that the stock for everyday clear soup may be made of bones flavoured according to the formula given earlier in this chapter. Any trimmings of meat, &c. can be addedâ€”the bones or carcase of a fowl being a specially desirable addition. If carefully made, properly cleared with white of eggs and flavoured with a little Liebig and sherry, such clear soup leaves little to be desired.

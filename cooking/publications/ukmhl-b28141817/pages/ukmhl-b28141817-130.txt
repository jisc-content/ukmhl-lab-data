118 DINNERS IN MINIATURE. Eel soup is excellent, and eel pie, well made, is supreme among fish pies, while an eel aspic is one of the prettiest supper dishes. They are also very good spatch-cocked, hut I prefer them stewed, either with wine or en mate- lote. Here is the recipe for the former dish, which you may turn into a matelote by the addition of some oysters, mussels, crayfish, and button mushrooms. Cut the eels into pieces three inches long, and put them in a stew- pan, together with lialf-a-pint of good well-flavoured stock, a bit of glaze, or a teaspoonful of Liebig, two glasses of sherry, a teaspoonful of anchovy, ditto chopped parsley, and a few button onions or a tea- spoonful of chopped shallot. Stew very gently for half an hour, or until the eels are nearly done. Knead two ounces of butter with one of flour in a small saucepan, and let it fry over the fire for a few moments—not to colour, but just to prevent the flour from tasting raw. Put this thickening into the stewpan where the eels are, and stir gently, so that it is thoroughly mixed in with the sauce ; add some button mushrooms, simmer for five minutes longer, and serve garnished with fried sippets.

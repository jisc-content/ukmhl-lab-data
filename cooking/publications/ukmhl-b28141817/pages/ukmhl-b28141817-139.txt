Chop up the fragments of jelly which remain in the tin, and garnish therewith the base of the cutlets. Young Housekeeper.—Spinach Souffle.—If you want something new in the way of a second-course vegetable, I cannot suggest anything better than a spinach souffle, especially as you say you are fond of spinach. The vegetable must be boiled, or rather stewed in a buttered saucepan, with only just enough w’ater to prevent its burning. When cooked it must be wrung perfectly dry, well chopped, and rubbed through a fine wire sieve, and placed in a stewpan with two ounces of butter, and a gill of cream to every pound of spinach, add a little powdered sugar, nutmeg, pepper and salt, and when it is a smooth green paste remove it from the fire and let it cool slightly before working into it the raw yolks of three eggs. When cold, add the whites of the eggs whipped to a stiff froth, fill a souffle dish—a china one is best—in the ordinary manner, and bake for forty minutes in a moderate oven. Before serving, strew a little grated ham over the souffle, and you will find it a quaint and enticing dish. Busy Bee.—Potato and Truffle Mayonnaise.—As you are tired of Italian salad as a second-course dish you might try a truffle and potato salad, which, in spite of its fame, is a dish more often praised than met with. It may either be dressed with vinaigrette (the ordinary French mixture of oil and vinegar) or a la mayonnaise —in your case the latter is best. Boil, skin, and slice 2 lbs. new potatoes, and put them in a bowl with three- quarters of the contents of a small bottle of truffles sliced thinly, and a gill of good mayonnaise sauce

DINNERS IN MINIATURE. 16 them. Nothing looks worse than beer in a delicate, undersized glass. If spirits are needed, the old English square-cut glass bottles or the Black Forest hour-glass ones cannot be bettered; while the small dark-brown glass flagons with squat bodies and round handles stuck to their short necks are inoffensive, even if not beautiful. A word as to napery, for an ugly pattern on the damask cloth often helps to destroy the beauty of the whole table. Avoid sprawling flowers and trellised ornaments, and be careful that the design is a con- ventional one, and not too large for your table. Nothing, to my thinking, is so beautiful as the plain white damask guiltless of pattern, especially if a table centre be used. A moire pattern also is charming in effect, and Japanese zigzag, crackle, and hawthorn designs are also very suitable. Mrs. Tulliverâ€™s liking for spots is not to be despised ; they look prim, delicate, and pretty. Of course the napkins should match the cloth. Unbleached linen woven with white often has a warm and charming effect, of which a wise woman will be glad to avail herself ; but if you do so, I warn you to be prepared for objections. Your husband even may not like it. Men are more conventional than women, and the whiteness of table napery is as much an article of faith with them as that of a dress shirt.

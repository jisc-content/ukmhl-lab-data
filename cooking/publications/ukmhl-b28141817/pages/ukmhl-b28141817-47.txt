' 35 VII. FISH AND FISH SAUCES. The great majority of English people, especially English men, prefer their fish itself plainly dressed, for the reason that it is usually excellent of its kind, firm, fresh, and delicate. The English epicure may appreci- ate elaborate cooking in the matter of entrees, and those varieties of dishes which our forefathers classed together under the somewhat contemptuous collective name of kickshaws ; but he does not care much for eels en matelote, or saumon au bleu, or sole aux fines herbes by the side of his turbot, his cut from the very middle of the finest salmon, his perfectly-fried sole, or the red mullet which, wrapped in its envelope of oiled paper, and unchanged by herbs or sauce, preserves the exquisite flavour which is all its own—the woodcock of the sea. Such being the case, the sauce to be served with the fish gains in importance, and before entering on the subject of dressed fish, I would fain say a few words on the subject of the best sauces to accompany various fish when plainly cooked, suggesting (as I have done before) that the name of each fish be entered in a book of private recipes, with the sauces most approved of as its accompaniments bracketed opposite, so that a moment’s glance will suffice to show what choice is open in the matter.

DINNERS IN MINIATURE. 24 of Russian cucumbers, sardines, anchovies, or other viands of the smoked or pickled description. Unquestionably for eight months of the year the king of hors d'ceuvres is the oyster. There are oysters and oysters ; they are, however, no longer as ruinous as they were some few years back, and have the advan- tage of making little or no demand on the cook’s time or care. But let them be served Yankee fashion, four or six on each plate in their deep shells, on a bed of crushed ice, and the quarter of a lemon in the centre. Have the brown bread-and-butter daintily cut, and cayenne, black pepper, and Chili vinegar handed round as swiftly as may be.

If the large-roed, unpressed Astrachan caviare can be obtained, it has but one fault—it is too good for its purpose. As Dick Swiveller said, “ beer cannot be tasted in a sip,” and it is doing good caviare scant honour to make it only the preface to a meal.

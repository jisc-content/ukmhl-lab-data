DINNERS IN MINIATURE. 26 but care must be taken that they are sufficiently piquant. Epicurean butter with a thin slice of cucumber is parti- cularly good, and such sandwiches look better cut out with a round tin cutter. Quite another class of appetizers which fulfil their purpose well are those of the vegetable order.

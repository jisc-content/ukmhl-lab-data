50 DINNERS IN MINIATURE. the work of a first-rate cook, can be produced when crumbs of fresh bread, rubbed through a coarse wire sieve, are used. The bread-crumbs must be dry, and they must be fine. Another cause of failure is the employment for this of bakers’ raspings, which are often coarse, and always too deep in colour, besides tasting burnt. Odd scraps of bread dried (not burnt) in the oven, pounded and finely sifted, are the most satisfactory material. Again, it cannot be too often insisted on that it is useless attempting to fry croquettes, &c. in a shallow frying-pan. If a small, deep stewpan be used, the quantity of fat need not very greatly exceed what would be spread shallowly over the broad surface of the frying-pan. The stewpan method has one disadvantage, that only one or two croquettes can be fried at once, and so it takes rather more time and trouble ; but the difference in results well repays the slight amount of extra labour involved. The beaten egg works better, too, if a dessertspoonful of water be mixed with it. And another great point to be remembered is, that the instant the object to be fried is crisp and of a light gold colour, it must be lifted on the skimmer or in the wire basket from the fat, and set to drain in the screen on a sieve, over which is folded some cooking paper to absorb what little grease may remain on the surface of the friture. Half a minute’s superfluous frying may turn a triumph into what, if not a failure, is a very modified success.

TABLE GARNITURE. 13 England. The worst of it is that the paste and glaze are both so soft, that the destruction of a whole dinner set at the hands of a “ breaker ” (as I have known some servants described) can be accomplished in a really incredibly short space of time. But, given care and the possibility of replacing the broken pieces (not an easy matter when you have to send to Florence for them), any one who wishes for a somewhat bizarre but fascinating and artistic dinner set will be well satisfied with one of Cantigalli pottery. Many people have a fondness for “blue and white,” and the willow pattern and the Dresden onion pattern are now so well reproduced, and so cheap, as to prevent any one rushing into the purchase of horrors. Only in blue and white china beware of the vivid shades of the colour, or you will grow to hate the broad faces of your dinner plates ere six months have gone. Chosen rightly, a blue and white service is pleasant and homely - looking, albeit it ties one down rather as regards table decorations. Given time, patience, a certain amount of cash, and a taste for poking about after curiosities, and perhaps one of the most satisfactory ways of obtaining a pet dinner plenishing at a reasonable price is to pick up a whole service, in separate pieces here and there, of old Nankin, Oriental, white Leeds, or Spode, whichever your worship’s fancy inclines you to. This can still be done, though it is a more difficult and costly business than of yore. It does not matter the various articles differing slightly in pattern, so long as the general effect be harmonious ; and in the course of your quest you are likely to come across other quaint and dainty items towards your board’s perfect equipment, such as green-handled, scimitar-bladed knives, curious fish trowels adorned with pierced work, and punch ladles

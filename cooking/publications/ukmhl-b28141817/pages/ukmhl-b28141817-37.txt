hors d’geuvres. 25 cult to procure. The smoked cod roes are nice as a change. Anchovies, sardines, lax, tunny, smoked salmon, and herrings preserved in white wine are all good, and may be served plain or pounded with butter, seasoned, and spread on toast. The old, simple fashion of having four or five kinds of hors d'oeuvres at once, such as anchovies, olives, thin slices of Brunswick or Bologna sausage, reindeer tongue, &c., is a very good one. They may be served either in small separate dishes, so that each guest may choose what he will, or a small plate containing an assortment may be placed to each cover. For these varied hors d'oeuvres the Russian warehouse may be recommended as providing a variety of out- landish, but toothsome, relishes. Stuffed olives should be served on circular pieces of fried bread, spread with some kind of savoury butter, and the same remark applies to another of the simplest and best hors d'oeuvres, the plover’s egg, with which to tamper further is mere wasteful and ridiculous excess. Stuffed eggs are a very favourite hors d'oeuvre with many people, and the recipes for them are legion. Per- haps they are a somewhat heavy introduction to dinner ; but they make an agreeable change. Caviare eggs are particularly good, and more novel than those prepared with anchovy or Parmesan ; the latter of these two, indeed, is out of place at the beginning of a meal.

Canapees and crusts are again without number, and to single out recipes for a few of the best would more than fill a chapter of this book. Very delicate and savoury sandwiches make by no means a bad beginning ;

Mary K.—Iced Grab Souffle.—You will find this recipe a really delicious cold entree, and it is not much trouble to prepare when there is some good aspic at hand. Shred all the white meat of a good- sized crab into a basin, and when it is all pulled apart with two silver forks into tiny white flakes, add the rich part of the crab and a gill of good mayonnaise sauce, with a little cayenne ; mix all these well together. In another basin half melt (so that it is just not quite solid) half pint aspic jelly by dipping the basin in some hot water, and then whip the aspic with a Dover egg- beater till it is all a thick froth, like the old-fashioned lemon sponge or Russian jelly. When it is thoroughly whipped mix it into the prepared crab before it gets quite stiff and set, and then fill the lining of a souffle mould with this mixture, and cover with whipped aspic, and freeze in an ice cave or buried in ice and salt. Serve with a napkin pinned round the dish. SWEETS, DRINKS, ETC.

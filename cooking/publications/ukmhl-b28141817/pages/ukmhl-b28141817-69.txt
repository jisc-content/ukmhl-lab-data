XI. REMOVES. Plain roast joints of the usual order need not detain us long ; hut it may be as well to remind all students of the art of dining that, to the cultured palate, roast meat almost inevitably demands the accompaniment of a simple salad, dressed plainly, with oil, vinegar, pepper, salt, and a fourniture of daintily-chopped herbs. Though, to my thinking, a loin of mutton gains im- mensely by being cut saddle fashion, this must always be a matter of individual taste, and the process cannot be defended on the ground of economy. It is only very young housekeepers who need the suggestion that Welsh mutton is an untold refinement on the English sheep, when a joint of mutton is a part of the evening meal. Ribs of beef should be rolled, both for the sake of convenience in carving and of economy. A good and not general accompaniment thereunto is horseradish butter, when horseradish sauce is not desired.

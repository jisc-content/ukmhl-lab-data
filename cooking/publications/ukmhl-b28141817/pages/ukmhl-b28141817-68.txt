DINNERS IN MINIATURE. 56 replaced by the little paper or china cases filled with the ragouts, which were used formerly to form the garnish of the flaky puff-paste vol au vent cases, which, unless she possessed that rare gift, a hand for pastry, seemed beyond the power of the ordinary cook ! Any good cookery book will supply a legion of recipes for vary- ing the contents of these cases, according to the occasion and the season of the year. Francatelli’s is especially rich in them. Space fails me to deal more fully with the infinite variety of “side dishes,” to use the old- fashioned name, which will suggest themselves to any one who studies the art of arranging a menu day by day.

Guisinez doucement is the grand maxim to be specially remembered, in regard to entrees in particular, and an important item to impress on your cook is never to use flour in the thickening of a sauce for sweetbread or cutlet or fillet. A little—a very little potato flour, mixed first with a little cold water and added to the hot sauce, will give it sufficient thickness, without impairing its transparency, smoothness, or flavour.

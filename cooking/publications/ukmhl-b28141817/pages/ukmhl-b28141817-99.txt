87 SWEETS. rather more than a tablespoonful of rum and a squeeze of lemon-juice. When iced, the cakes can be decorated with glace fruits or chopped pistachios as preferred. These are charming little cakes, and as good to eat as they are pretty to look at. Among hot sweets may be mentioned fruit fritters, beignets souffles, pancakes, &c., but only the first need special mention. Bananas make incomparable fritters ; slices of oranges are good, and so are halved greengages. Tinned peaches, apricots, or pineapple serve well ; but whatever fruit is used should be soaked in a little rum, Maraschino, or kirsch, and sugar, before being dipped in the batter, which should also be flavoured with the liqueur. Whatever you do, let your sweets be real of their kind, your custard made with eggs and milk, guiltless of corn-flour or custard powder ; your whipped cream genuine, not eked out with white of egg ; and your jelly made from calvesâ€™ feet, not gelatine ; while, if you like that insipid dish blanc-mange, eat it under that name, and not under the alias of Italian cream, owing to the addition of a handful of dried fruits.

DINNERS IN MINIATURE. 66 accompany roast meat ; their variety is infinite, and as few or as many vegetables as you please may enter into them, whilst, in more elaborate guise, they form the foundation of Italian, Russian, Dutch salads, &c. For tomato salads the fruit is used raw. The ripe, round, smooth, rosy-red tomatoes should be chosen, and a pretty effect may be gained by having a centre of the golden-coloured fruit. The tomatoes should be cut into slices half an inch thick, then freed from the seeds and juice, which should be mixed in with the dressing, for which I have already given the recipe, with the addition of a teaspoonful of fresh lemon thyme, chopped very fine, another of chopped capers, and a fairly liberal addition of powdered sugar. Tomato salad is the only one besides the fruit salads of melon, orange, &c., which needs the addition of more than a pinch of sugar; but it is wonderful how lavish a spoonful it will stand. The addition of claret is im- portant, and so is the thorough rubbing with garlic of the dish in which it is mixed ; but the great point is to prepare the salad some hours before it is needed, so that the flavours may be thoroughly amalgamated. It looks much better served in a soup plate or shallow glass dish than in a bowl. Cold boiled salsify, celeriac, Jerusalem artichokes, and cauliflower, and the preserved artichoke bottoms, all make delicious salads, and may all be served with or without beetroot and hard-boiled eggs. Beetroot and raw celery, beetroot and boiled and sliced Spanish onion, carefully boiled small dried white haricot beans, lentils, Brussels sprouts, &c., are also excellent in salads.

DINNERS IN MINIATURE. 88 Jolm Dory is a fish which once ranked higher in the estimation of epicures than it does at present; but, to my mind, there is no flat fish, not excepting turbot, of so fine a flavour, and Dutch sauce enhances its claims to appreciation, though the saying of the wit and gourmet of the last century, that no marriage ever gave him so much pleasure as the union of good John Dory with delicate Ann Chovy, deserves remembrance. But let your anchovy sauce consist of well-made melted butter, with a foundation of fish stock if possible, and to this add, not the flavourless essence of anchovies, but four or five anchovies washed, boned, and pounded with butter and a grate of nutmeg, and rubbed through a sieve, then stirred into the sauce. Capers are a good addition. Shrimp sauce should be made after the same fashion, the heads and shells being pounded in a mortar with two boned anchovies and a very little nutmeg and cayenne. A large lump of this butter should be added to the sauce as well as the picked shrimps, and what is left thereof may be utilized, spread on toast, as a savoury for the next day’s dinner. Lobster or crab butters, made by pounding the inferior parts of the fish in the same way, should be used in these sauces also. With fried fish I think sauces unnecessary; a quartered lemon/cayenne, and bread-and-butter are the best accompaniments to fried soles or whiting, even as they are to whitebait or smelts, and fried parsley is the prettiest garnish. If, however, anything further be liked, anchovy, shrimp, or maitre d’hotel butter, served in pats, is preferable to a liquid sauce. Should you hold an opposite opinion, tomato sauce may be approved of with fried soles or filleted whitings, and mussel, matelote, or piquante sauce will be found to agree excellently with spatch-cocked eels. With boiled mackerel there is no sauce so individual

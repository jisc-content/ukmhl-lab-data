Melt 1 oz. of butter in a sautepan, in which arrange the prepared fillets so that all the pointed ends meet together in the middle of the pan, forming the radii of a circle. Place a small round flat lid on them or circular weight, so as to prevent the tips of the fillets from curling up in cooking. Sprinkle a little chopped parsley and some clarified butter over them, with pepper and salt, and place them in a moderate oven to cook for twenty minutes. Then dress them in a circle in an entree or vegetable dish as you would cutlets, and pour over them some matelote sauce prepared with fish stock, previously made from the bones of the sole, flavoured with herbs and vegetables, boiled for an hour and a half, strained off, and thickened with 1 oz. of butter kneaded with 1 oz. of flour, well stirred into the stock, and simmered for a quarter of an hour. Put a gill of this sauce into a small stewpan, together with a glass of French white wine, the liquor of a dozen oysters, or of a pint of mussels when oysters are out of season ; stir well over the fire, and add the oysters, a quarter of a pint of shelled and bearded mussels, the tails of a dozen crayfish, or, in default of them, 3cl. worth of picked shrimps, half a small tin of button mushrooms, and three anchovies cut in small pieces ; stir together till they are hot, and then pour the sauce over the filleted soles, letting the ragout—i. e. the oysters, mushrooms, &c.—be piled in the centre. This sauce is the one used for a matelote of eels, or sole a la Normande, and is excellent with many kinds of dressed fish. Write and tell me how you succeed with this dish ; it is so good that it deserves a little trouble being taken over its concoction. Mrs L. C.

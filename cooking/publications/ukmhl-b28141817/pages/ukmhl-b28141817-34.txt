DINNERS IN MINIATURE. 22 ficent colour coup is easily struck by a great mass of pink, crimson, and white peonies, in a large china bowl or Nankin tureen ; and if you have any fine plate or charger, be it Chinese, Persian, Rhodian, Italian faience, or Hispano-Moresque, you may make it minister to your table decoration by placing a flat semi-circular, grace- fully-arranged spray or wreath of any flower upon it, so as only to partially hide its beauties, and make it serve as the centre ornament. It may, if you please, be filled with rose-water. If a specimen vase be put to each person, they are better small and low, or they are apt to get knocked over. For dessert services, the modern white Leeds and Wedgwood are as pretty as anything ; and so are the Nuremberg finger-glasses, with their cool olive tint and pretty bosses. Do not forget the sprays of oak- leaved geranium, lemon verbena, or myrtle ; or else the slice of lemon to float in these last. Dâ€™oyleys may be made of scraps of coarse old lace or Eastern embroidery. Those worked by the Turkish refugees are very beauti- ful, and for everyday use I have seen some charming little round ones in Irish damask, with Renaissance dragons and scrolls in blue or red. These, outlined by hand with silk, would be smart enough for any occasion. For the cigarettes handed round after dinner there are any number of dainty receptacles now made in polished wood or morocco, or one of the little brocade trays so much in vogue lately does perfectly well, and looks very pretty.

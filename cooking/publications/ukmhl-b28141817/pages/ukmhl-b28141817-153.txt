RECIPES. 141 picked leaves of chervil, finely-chopped trufflesâ€”these and many more should surely give you sufficient variety for aspics, mayonnaises, chaudfroids, canapees, &c. For sweets, jellies, and creams . there are no prettier garnishings than preserved fruits, red-currant jelly, almonds, pistachios, &c. For fried entrees, I can tell you of a most original and fascinating garnish, invented by a man cook of my acquaintance, that is, fried gelatine. The kind which is cut in shreds must be used, not the sheet, and it must be fried in a wire basket set in a saucepan of boiling lard, when it will swell and burst and frizzle into a crisp, gold-coloured froth. For plain French salads you may garnish with nasturtium or borage blossoms. They look extremely pretty, and are good to eat. For clear soup, when you are in a hurry and have no time to prepare savoury custard, raviolis, or tiny duchesse loaves, put in some picked leaves of chervil. This is very nice when the soup itself is flavoured with the herb. THE END.

HOES D’OEUVEES. CAVIARE.—The nearest approach in England to the Russian method of serving this dainty is to mix it with a little salad oil and a squeeze of lemon-juice, and spread it thickly, when so prepared, on hot buttered crumpets, or, better still, on the thin pikelets which may be procured in Derby and other northern towns, also, I believe, at some London bakers, and which are very like the Russian cakes used for this purpose. If served at the beginning of a meal, it should be spread on small squares of dry toast, well-buttered, care being taken not to be niggardly as regards the caviare. Caviare eggs, made by mixing the pounded yolks of hard-boiled eggs with a like quantity of caviare, a little salad oil, a few drops of lemon-juice, and cayenne, and filling the half whites with this mixture, form a pretty liors cVceuvre. especially if they be set on fined circular croutons spread with watercress butter. The caviare and egg mixture might also be set in aspic jelly, small dariole moulds being used for the purpose. If you are fortunate enough to procure the large grained im- pressed caviare, it cannot be better treated than by simply serving it in its jar, with the accompaniments of fresh butter and crisp toast. Caviare sandwiches are delicious, and small balls of caviare should be strewn

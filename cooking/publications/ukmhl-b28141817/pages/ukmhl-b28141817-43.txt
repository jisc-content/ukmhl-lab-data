01 SOUPS. 0 1 garnish as I have before described, omitting the turnip, but adding a blade of mace, and boil for an hour and a half. Not more water should be used than will cause the stock, when strained and cold, to assume the appearance of a clear, limpid jelly. This broth is the best of all foundations for bouillabaisse, bisque, oyster soup, or fish mulligatawny (which may be specially mentioned as an admirable soup, garnished with picked shrimps or prawns). Fish stock is also very good thickened Avith a liaison of a little cream and two yolks of eggs, or simply strained and served over poached eggs, one in each plate.

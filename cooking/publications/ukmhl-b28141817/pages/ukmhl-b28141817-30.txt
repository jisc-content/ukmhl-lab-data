DINNERS IN MINIATURE. 18 on the table itself ; but when the latter is small, they take np a great deal of room which can ill be spared ; and a standing lamp is open to the same objection. A hanging dinner lamp, with a large silk shade spreading widely enough not to focus the light entirely on one spot of the table-cloth, leaving those dining in outer darkness, is with a small table the best expedient. If you happen to have pretty candlesticks you wish to utilize, they will be quite as effective on the sideboard (which is seldom sufficiently illuminated), and the absence of lights on the table will give you ample room for your centre ornaments. Before considering the decoration of the table, a few words as to the laying of each place may not be entirely useless. Personally I dislike to have spoons and forks in front of me as well as to the right and left, till one is as fenced in as the Light Brigade itself ; while another small matter which annoys me in a private house is a napkin so elaborately folded as to recall an Italian restaurant ; the simple diamond folding is quite sufficiently ornamental. Teach your maid to get the arrangement of each cover exactly similar, and to see that the lines on either side the table between one claret glass and another, &c., are straight as a die, that all the distances are evenly proportioned, and that all the articles are placed so as to be as little as may be in any one’s way, while as near as possible to every one’s hand. Just above the forks a small salt-cellar and pepper-caster (cayenne also, if liked) should be put for each person ; and below these, to the left, a tiny plate, containing six or eight olives or some salted almonds. These latter, however, many people prefer served hot with the coffee after dinner. Salad plates should not be placed on the table till needed ; then they are set on the left hand.

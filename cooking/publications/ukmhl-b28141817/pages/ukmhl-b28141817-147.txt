(York).—Iced Gooseberry Fool and Coffee Mousse.-—Do not have too many sweets for your stand- up supper ; very few people take them now, and straw- berries and cream will make up for all deficiencies, especially if you have a large glass bowl of iced goose- berry fool on the supper-table, and have it replenished as often as need be. There is no better sweet at this time of year, but it must be carefully made. Stew very slowly a quart of green gooseberries with half a pound of white sugar, and a little water to prevent the fruit burning. Rub through a hair sieve, and use very little vegetable greening to make it a pretty colour ; then add a liqueur glass of brandy or Maraschino, half a pint of cream whipped stiff, a little nutmeg and grated lemon-peel. Mix all well together, and freeze either in a freezing machine or in a pewter mould or can, buried in a tub of rough ice, mixed with salt and saltpetre. If iced in this way the fool will take two hours, and must be worked with a wooden spoon from time to time. A good custard may be used instead of cream, but the fool will not be so delicate. Coffee mousse, which you mention, is a delicious sweet, and may be served either frozen or simply cold. You must make a tea-cupful of the strongest and clearest coffee— essence of coffee, in fact—using a quarter of a pound of coffee to the tea-cup of water. Put the coffee, when made, with two yolks of eggs and an ounce of sugar, in a gallipot in a saucepan of boiling water, and stir over the fire till the mixture thickens ; then let it get cold. Whip a pint of cream quite stiff, and add the coffee to it by degrees, so that it is smooth and thick. It looks best served in old china tea-cups and saucers.

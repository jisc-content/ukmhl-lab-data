DINNERS IN MINIATURE. 62 few epicures who will not welcome a grouse pudding, properly made with light thin crust well rolled out f and the daintiest table will be graced by a lark pudding, deftly compounded half of larks and half of Chipolata ragout, i. e. very small round sausages, small quenelles, bits of bacon shaped like marbles, the red parts of carrots also turned into little balls, roasted and peeled chestnuts, button mushrooms, and—if you wish to be extravagant and luxurious—truffles ; “ all worked up together in one delicious gravy ” of brown sauce, and a glass of Madeira or good sherry. For the right com- position of a rump-steak pudding six elements are needed—steak, kidneys, larks, mushrooms, oysters, and hard-boiled eggs ; the result, with cunning seasoning, should be a triumph.

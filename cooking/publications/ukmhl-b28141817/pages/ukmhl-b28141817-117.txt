B ATT ERIE DE CUISINE. 105 different sizes are most handy for making quenelles and preventing the chief trouble thereofâ€”their deft shaping with spoons. If the quenelles be forced through the pipe into a buttered stewpan, and then hot water gently poured round them previous to poaching, there will be very little trouble and no difficulty in the process. This chapter is not intended to give a complete list of kitchen furnishings, but a few small conveniences likely to be forgotten may be added. Apple-corers, vegetable punches and shapers, and larding needles have been already mentioned. Steak tongs and cucum- ber slicers are also useful, and a cherry-stoner is a most convenient little implement. For lemon-squeezers, the glass ones recently introduced are infinitely the best. Wire trays, such as are used by confectioners for cakes to dry on, are very handy ; and a little brass skillet for making transparent icing or mulling wine (and for nothing else) is almost a necessity. Our grandmothers had their silver saucepans for such refined purposes. Always have plenty of nice clean wooden spoons. A palette knife should be kept for smoothing over surfaces masked with cream or Vienna icing, &c., and a propos of cakes, a box of circular cutters, wherewith to stamp out little dessert cakes, &c., should not be forgotten. The expensive and cumbrous old-fashioned weighing machine may well be avoided and a spring balance chosen in its place, as being far. cheaper as well as more convenient and satisfactory.

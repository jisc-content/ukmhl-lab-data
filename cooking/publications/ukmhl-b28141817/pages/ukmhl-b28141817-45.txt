SOUPS. 33 the patience of the cook or on the sum allowed for the weekly housekeeping. I have said nothing about the familiar soups, mock turtle, Scotch broth, pea soup, cock-a-leekie, and hotch- potch, because, though excellent meals in themselves, they are for that very reason unfitted to be the com- mencement of a dinner. Their real place is at lunch on a cold, frosty day. But the soup served four days out of the seven in most houses is some form or another of consomme, and it is necessary to remember the different forms of garnishing the stock so that it shall have a certain variety. Bonne femme, jardiniere, and Brunoise are all favourite forms of soup made by the addition of various vegetables, differently cut up, to the clear stock. To my own taste, there is nothing so simple and good as small squares of savoury custard, and this is easily pre- pared earlier in the day. If ravioli or quenelles are being prepared for other purposes, a few may be reserved for the soup of the next day. They must be very small. A poached egg in each plate is very nice, and has the advantage of being a really practical addition to the dinner of an invalid ; then many people are fond of croute au pot. A few asparagus points, green peas, or French beans, cut in dice, look well either by themselves or together with the savoury custard or quenelles. Last year the fashion obtained of little cubes or balls of various colours in the soup ; the black and white ones being formed respectively of truffle and white of egg, but this is a somewhat troublesome garnish for every day. If any one clings fondly to the old fashion of maccaroni or vermicelli in the soup, it is a necessity to have them boiled first in water, and well drained ; as if they are boiled in the soup they impart a disagreeable gruelly taste of stale flour.

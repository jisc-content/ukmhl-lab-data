DRESSED FISH. 45 my readers. The first converts that humble fish, the fresh herring, into a dish worthy any table. The second is of Greek origin. Clean and wipe four fresh herrings, cut off their heads and tails, but do not wash them ; make three slight incisions slantwise on either side of each fish, and rub them all over with French mustard (English mustard mixed with tarragon vinegar serves quite as well), into which you have stirred a clove of garlic scraped fine, and a tablespoonful of chopped parsley, or of parsley and tarragon in equal parts. Place the fish in a china baking dish with 2 oz. of butter broken over them, and a glass of claret, and set in the oven for ten minutes; then turn the fish, baste them with their liquor, and strew in a handful of fine bread-crumbs ; replace in oven for another ten minutes and serve. Rub a white baking dish well with garlic, and place therein a layer of skinned tomatoes cut in slices, then a layer of filleted fish (plaice or sole), another layer of tomatoes, and so on till you have used up both them and your fish. Season with pepper and salt, and pour about a wineglassful of salad oil over the fish. Cover with oiled paper, and set in a slow oven to cook very gently for three-quarters of an hour.

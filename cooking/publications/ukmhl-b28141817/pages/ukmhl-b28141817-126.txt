114 DINNERS IN MINIATURE. produce a very fair imitation of the Proven 9al stew. Slice two good-sized Spanish onions rather thinly, and fry them for a few minutes in a wide shallow stewpan, with a bay leaf, a clove of garlic, and two tablespoonfuls of salad oil, till the onions are a pale brown ; then put into the pan one red mullet, a small slice of cod, a small sole, and a fresh haddock or whiting, together with the flesh of a small lobster, all cut into fillets, or pieces about three inches long. Add enough warm water to just cover the fish, together with four tomatoes cut in slices and freed from seeds, half a large lemon, without the pips or rind, cut in small dice, a dessertspoonful of Spanish sweet red pepper, a little salt, a pinch of saffron, and two glasses of French white wine. Set on a hot fire and boil quickly for about twelve minutes, when the fish should be done. Mix a small dessertspoonful of flour with a little of the fish gravy, so that it is smooth, and throw it into the soup ; it must not be enough to thicken it, only just to prevent its being quite as thin as water. Add a tablespoonful of finely-chopped parsley, and boil for one minute longer. Line a tureen or deep dish with the crusts of French rolls cut half an inch thick. Pour the gravy of the bouillabaisse over these, and if you like the pieces of fish also, or you may serve the latter in a different dish, both fish and sauce, however, being helped together into soup plates. It is an admirable dish and will help you to keep fast days both luxuriously and economically, as it is very nourishing. Lover OF SOUP.â€”I am not surprised at your com- plaint that your cook cannot make good Julienne soup as one has it abroad. It is a thing one hardly ever gets rightly made in England. Even the best cooks here conceive it to be clear soup, with a few shreds of vegetables added, instead of a weak consomme, full of shreds of vegetables, and with a distinct herbal flavour.

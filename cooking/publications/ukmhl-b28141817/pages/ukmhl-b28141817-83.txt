SALADS AND MAYONNAISES. 71 disguise the taste of the oil, and so may by some people be regarded as making the salad rather sickly. With melon or pineapple no oil is needed ; they should be cut into convenient pieces, and a squeeze of lemon-juice and sprinkling of powdered sugar is all they require. Chopped tarragon and chervil may be added or not, according to taste. Herring, sardine, and anchovy salads are all more suited to serve as hors dâ€™oeuvres than as second-course dishes, but in then right place they are excellent; and so is a salad of pimentos (the large Spanish peppers) dressed with olives, Norwegian anchovies, and capers, and seasoned with vinaigrette.

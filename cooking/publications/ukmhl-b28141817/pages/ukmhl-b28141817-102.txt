90 DINNERS IN MINIATURE. To a very simple class of savouries belong those which can be handed round in a pot, accompanied by dry toast and fresh butter ; but under this head comes the king of all dainties, the matchless foie gras. After this comes caviare, and then the tribe of potted meats, ail of which, when home-made, may be excellent, and are also an economical way of using up scraps of ham, tongue, salmon, or game. Bloater paste from the shops is usually abominable ; but bloater paste made at home, with the soft roes added, and a sufficiency of fresh butter, is a delicacy no epicure will despise. Haddocks, kippers, smoked salmon, or mackerel, &c., are equally good treated in the same way, the pastes made there- from not only being good served plainly, but available for the concoction of tiny savoury raviolis or souffles, and making a capital savoury spread thickly on a hot toasted and well-buttered crumpet. Crumpets so toasted and spread with caviare are the nearest approach to which we can attain to the Russian blini cm caviare, unless we can procure the thinner and more delicate cakes, known in the north by the name of pikelets, but not generally obtainable from a London baker. They are far superior to crumpets for this purpose. Smoked cods’ roes are also very good served as above. The soft roes of bloaters are better served on toast, and so are devilled sardines or fillets of bloaters or kippers. Devilled anchovies, smoked salmon, or tunny, on the contrary, are best on devilled biscuits, well soaked in oil before being grilled. All this class of savouries must be served very hot. Savoury toasts are of two kinds—hot and cold, anchovy, marrow, and Bombay toasts ranking highest among the former class. The first and second of these need no description, though a passing remark may be made that every true gourmet prefers his marrow toast

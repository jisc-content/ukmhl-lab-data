DINNERS IN MINIATURE. ] 02 The point of braising, as distinct from stewing, is that the meat is raised above its liquor and basted with it instead of being immersed therein, and the temper- atures above and below the stewpan are equal one to the other. With regard to the salamander—Mrs. Rokesmith’s bate noire—it may be observed that, useful as it is, cooks are apt to prefer the hot shovel, and they have some excuse. The salamander takes some time to get hot, is cumbrous to use, and, if the range be small, destroys the fire ; so, on the whole, a cheap shovel may be retained for the especial work of brown- ing dishes that need it, will cost less at the beginning, and, properly used, will last for a long time.

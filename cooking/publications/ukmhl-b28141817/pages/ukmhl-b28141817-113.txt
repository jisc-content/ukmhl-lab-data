BATTERIE DE CUISINE. 101 the economy as well as the luxury of the house, and a large iron boiling pot is one of the expensive items which cannot be omitted from your list. But do not be led into the purchase of a fish-kettle in which your slice of salmon or cod, or your chicken turbot, will be well-nigh lost, and which takes up most of the available space on the top of the stove. If you have ever occasion to boil a whole salmon, you can borrow the necessary kettle from your fishmonger. For every day for six or eight people quite a small kettle is sufficient, and far more convenient. A bain-marie is an immense convenience and luxury, and, if the dinner be somewhat elaborate, it needs experience to know how the cooking is improved and the cookâ€™s time and temper saved by the sauces, &c., each emptied into their separate stewpot, having been prepared beforehand, and all at the right time, and gently warming up in their bath of boiling water. But a huge bain-marie, such as is usually sold, stultifies its own convenience. Get your tinman to make you a tray of block-tin some 15 inches square and 4 deep ; then choose some six or eight small steel stewpans, deep, but of small diameter ; put these into the tin, and rigorously forbid their ever being used on the fire except in their water bath, and for the purpose of warming up the sauces, &c., that have been prepared earlier in the day. A wire frying basket is imperative, and so is a deep stewpan for frying in, and a nice frying-pan kept for the exclusive use of omelettes. Braising-pans are often offered to young housekeepers, but they are expensive ; and fricandeaus, &c. can be perfectly well prepared if set in a closed stewpan in the oven, allowed to simmer gently, basted frequently, and the salamander passed over them before serving.

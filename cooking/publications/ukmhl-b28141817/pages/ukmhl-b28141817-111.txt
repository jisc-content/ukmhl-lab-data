99 XIX. BATTERIE DE CUISINE. ■» MOST housekeepers who have read Our Mutual Friend have sympathized with Mrs. John Rokesmith when, in her attempts to master the culinary art under the direction of The Complete British Housewife, she was brought to a standstill by that exasperating mentor’s directions to “ take a salamander ” as coolly as she would say “catch a Tartar,” and have felt with Bella when she shut up the book with a bang, apostro- phizing her instructress, “ Oh, you are a stupid old thing ; where on earth do you think I am to get it ? ” Yet the Complete British Housewife had some reason on her side. True, a bad workman blames his tools ; but delicate cookery is much aided, and time and trouble much economized, by various simple contriv- ances which the ordinary cook scorns, and which her mistress does not understand. But there is another variety of cook yet more aggravating, and that is she who lays the blame of all her failures on the inadequacy of her kitchen plenishing, and who, when her much- tried mistress supplies her with the utensils so strenu- ously demanded, leaves them to rot and rust unused in the seclusion of the scullery or the damp cellar, whence they only emerge to reach the dustman’s cart, and to be sold as old iron. Is this an unusual experience ? I trow not.

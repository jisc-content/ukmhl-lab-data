SIMPLE ENTKliES. 47 entree is synonymous with a rechauffe. Now, though several entrees for everyday use can be made excellently well from cold viands, many more absolutely require fresh meat; while of those for which cold meat is used, care must be taken that the exhausted juices of the meat are reinforced by good strong stock of some sort, otherwise the dish will be neither nourishing nor appetizing. Another very important point in the preparation of many entrees is the use of the larding needles. Even when these useful articles are found in a small kitchen — which is less often than might be expected, consider- ing they only cost a few pence—they are too often allowed to rust unheeded ; yet fillets, fricandeaus, and sweetbreads are dependent on larding for their full flavour and tenderness ; and one of the first things a mistress should do is to insist on the larding of such things. It is not extravagant; a slice of fat to be cut into strips for larding can be pared off the top of a piece of breakfast bacon without being much missed, and should prove amply sufficient for an entree for three or four people. Bacon rinds and trimmings, ham bones, &c., should always be kept, being often quite enough to give the necessary flavour in recipes that require the bottom of the stewpan to be covered with fat bacon ; or in sauces such as tomato, where the addition of ham is almost a necessity. For the wine needed in the composition of many entrees and sauces, it is not a bad plan to keep a bottle of sound—not fine—port and another of sherry for cooking purposes, and to give out to the cook the requisite quantity as occasion requires. By this means you keep a check on the consumption, and are also able to tell exactly the amount the wine used in cooking costs you, which you cannot well do if it be supplied

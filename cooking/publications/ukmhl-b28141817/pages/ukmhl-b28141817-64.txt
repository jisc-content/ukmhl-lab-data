DINNERS IN MINIATURE. the various kind of cutlets—I can add nothing to the series of recipes for them and their garnishing and sauces which may he found in most good cookery hooks. I would only suggest the claims on our notice of the double cutlet, cut twice the usual thickness, and so preserving the juiciness and flavour of the meat, and also utter a protest against the egging and bread-crumb- ing of cutlets in general. Cutlets should be sauted ; by this method they retain their essence, with an added savour and zest the bread-crumbed cutlet never pos- sesses ; while a word also should be spoken for the Maintenon cutlet, which of late years seems somewhat to have fallen out of favour among us.

These are none of them novel suggestions, and, as I have said, refer- ence to the pages of the cookery books will enable my readers to vary them ad infinitum. Entrees of fowl vary from the simply fricasseed remains of yesterday’s chicken, to the most elaborate inventions of Ude or Cafeme.

Midway between these two extremes come such dishes as fowl a la Marengo, which is, to my mind, the best of all forms of dressed chicken. It is a good plan, when there are but two people to be provided for, to split a

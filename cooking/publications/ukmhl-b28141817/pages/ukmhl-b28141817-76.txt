DINNERS IN MINIATURE. 64 ing ruins the flavour of lettuce ; and there may be some truth in this. If you can gather a lettuce fresh from the garden, its heart untainted by worm, slug, or mould, by all means simply wipe the crisp leaves with a clean cloth before using them ; but London lettuces often need refreshment, and in this case it is a good thing to stick them up with their stalks in water for an hour or so, and then rinse them lightly but thoroughly with running water. Never let salad lie soaking in a pan of cold water. When rinsed, whisk the lettuce to shake out the wet, break the leaves lightly apart with the fingers—never let a steel knife touch the vegetable if you value your reputation as a salad-maker—tearing each leaf in two, so that the pieces shall not be un- comfortably long, but not any smaller (shred and minced lettuce salad are one of the reproaches of the British housewife), shaking them lightly in a clean cloth till they are freed from any remaining moisture. Some people dress their salads by placing the lettuce, &c., when washed and dried, in a bowl, and pouring over it in order the components of the dressing or vinaigrette, then sprinkling the fourniture or Seasoning over it, and finally mixing. I prefer the more method- ical, and, I believe, the more artistic, method of first rubbing the bowl well with garlic, then placing therein the chopped herbs, and adding to them the oil, vinegar, &c., mixing well, and leaving the sauce for a little while, so that it may be well impregnated with the flavour and perfume of the herbs before the salad is mixed therein. If half the lettuce be then placed in the bowl and well tossed up, and the second half then added, the whole salad will be quickly and thoroughly mixed, every leaf enjoying its right modicum of sauce and seasoning, which is not always the case when the rougher method is employed.

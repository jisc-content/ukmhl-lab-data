DINNERS IN MINIATURE. 7G regards flavour, but in colour leave something to be desired. Yams and sweet potatoes are at present a fancy with some people, though those who have been used to them in the tropics, as a rule, dislike them, finding them sickly and insipid. Mushrooms are really too good to be stuffed or otherwise diverted from their native simplicity ; but if you wish to taste them in true perfection, choose those of a good size, of a globular shape, with light-coloured gills—the very large, flat, dark flaps are best simply saute with butter—place these in a small buttered fire- proof dish, and put a large lump of Devonshire cream in the centre of each mushroom, pour some more cream round them, season slightly with pepper and salt, cover the dish closely with another on the top, and set in the oven for ten minutes ; a squeeze of lemon may be added before serving, and buttered toast or fried croutons served with them. Small button mushrooms are best stewed in a saucepan, either with gravy or butter, and a little milk ; they should be thickened slightly with flour, and seasoned with lemon-juice, pepper, and salt. Morels are best stewed in a rich, wine gravy. They may be served in patty cases or croustades : and puff- balls of the right sort and gathered young (the white Lgcqperdon giganteum is the best) may be cooked in the same way, though they are very good cut in slices and sauted. English truffles are a dainty which should be sought for during the period they are in season, and may then often be had at a moderate price at Covent Garden. They may be simply cooked in butter and served in a napkin, or stewed with wine—sherry or Madeira. Potato croquettes are delicious with a truffle craftily concealed in each of them.

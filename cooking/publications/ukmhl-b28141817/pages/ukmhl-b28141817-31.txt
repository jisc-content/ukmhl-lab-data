19 TABLE DECORATION. Most persons object to too large an array of knives and forks, and would prefer to have them supplied as need arises ; and everybody dislikes the huge weapons we have wielded for so many years. The dessert spoon and fork and the cheese knife are large enough for every purpose, and the table will look neater if they only are employed. The glasses set on the table should be those suited to the wines. The laying of the sideboard and side table properly conduces a good deal to the appearance of the dining- room, and the dainty sideboard cloths now used are another charming item in a well-stocked linen cup- board. The German damask ones, with patterns in blue, gold, or red on the white ground, are very pretty, and may be made quite beautiful by outlining the design with coloured silk of a rather deeper shade. White damask may be enriched in the same manner, and further elaborated by darning in the ground with the same shade of colonr as used for outlining. Homespun linen adorned with coarse old lace, drawn work, or macrame, suits an old oak sideboard better than almost anything else. The laying of the sideboard must, of course, depend upon its size. If it needs supplementing with a side table, the sideboard itself should be as pretty as possible, leaving the less ornamental requisites for the side table. Many people nowadays object to the dessert being brought into the hot dining-room till it is wanted, but those who are less fastidious will gladly avail themselves of the opportunity of it to decorate the sideboard as nothing but fruit can do. With the dessert may be placed the wine, the powdered sugar and cream, and any other pretty accessories ; while extra plates, glasses, forks, &c., mineral water siphons, and bread may be relegated to the side table.

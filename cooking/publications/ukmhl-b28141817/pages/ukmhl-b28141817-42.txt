The French pastilles de legumes should also be kept at hand, but they need to be used with extreme caution, or otherwise they give the soup a disagreeable burnt taste ; a quarter of a ball, or even less, will sufficiently colour a quart of soup. The flavouring given above will serve for most purposes.

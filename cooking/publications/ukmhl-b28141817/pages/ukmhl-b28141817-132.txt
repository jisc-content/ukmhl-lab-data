DINNERS IN MINIATURE. 120 thinly sliced, a little celery (or celery seed), a small carrot sliced thin, a little parsley, thyme, and bay leaf, nutmeg, pepper, and salt, and rather more than half a pint of milk. Let this boil quickly over the fire for twenty minutes, stirring all the time, and taking great care it does not catch or burn. Rub through a tammy or sieve into a basin ; add \ oz. of butter, a tablespoonful of finely-chopped parsley, a squeeze of lemon, and a teaspoonful or more of tarragon vinegar, according to taste.

Put the duck in a stewpan, together with a little carrot and celery, a small clove of garlic, a little bay leaf, parsley, and thyme, an onion stuck with four cloves, and half a gill of salad oil. Fry the duck in this slowly on the top of the stove till it is a light brown on all sides, then add enough stock to just cover the vegetables, but not the duck, cover with the lid of the

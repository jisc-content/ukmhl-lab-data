CURRIES. 81 curried, but cut into small dice and mixed with some rich and thick tartar or mayonnaise sauce, with which lias been blended some thoroughly good curry powder. As to the freezing, it may be accomplished without an ice machine, by filling two cocoa tins, with lids, one with the curry and the other with nicely boiled rice, each grain separate ; then burying the tins for two hours in a mixture of ice, saltpetre, and salt. When they are needed, half fill a number of little white china souffle dishes with the curry, filling up with the rice. Serve in a silver dish, embedded in crushed ice. Curried rice is more suitable as a breakfast dish or a garnish for cutlets than for serving by itself at dinner ; but if it be garnished with fowlsâ€™ livers, or scraps of ham or tongue, or small balls of liver forcemeat, it may make its appearance now and again at the latter meal. Curried vegetables are among the best of their tribe, and are better when two or three different sorts are mixed together. Celery, sea-kale, broad beans, French beans, peas, cauliflower, young carrots, celeriac, beetroot, Jerusalem'artichokes, and, last but not least, mushrooms, are among the best for this purpose. They should, of course, be previously cooked before being stewed in the curry sauce. Another excellent accompaniment of curry, with which I have only lately become acquainted, is cucum- ber shredded into very thin fine strips (as vegetables are prepared for Julienne soup, only thinner), well salted so as to drain out the water, and then dressed with oil and a little tarragon vinegar, chopped green chillies, and three anchovies, washed, boned, and chopped up small.

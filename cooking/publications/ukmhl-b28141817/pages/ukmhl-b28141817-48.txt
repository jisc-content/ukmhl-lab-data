DINNERS IN MINIATURE. 36 Salmon, the king of fish, really needs no sauce when boiled, beyond melted butter and cucumber ; but, to my mind, the melted butter usually known by that name is advantageously replaced by pure fresh butter, oiled and skimmed, to which is added, when it is boiling, some tiny sprigs of picked parsley, and, the instant these are crisp, a spoonful of French or tarragon vinegar.

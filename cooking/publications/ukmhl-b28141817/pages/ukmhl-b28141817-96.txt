DINNERS IN MINIATURE. 84* great saving of time and trouble in the concoction of any chocolate sweets ; but when they are used vanilla must always be added. Baked chocolate or coffee custards are simple and economical. The little castle puddings are always nice, especially when flavoured with lemon, steamed, and served with wine sauce, and when baked and rolled in a kirsch syrup they are better than any baba or savarin. Fruit tarts should always be served cold ; and the cream handed with them is better whipped, in the opinion of many people. To dwell on creams of various kinds would take too long, but I may mention among the less frequent forms of this dainty, creme brulee, and viz Vimperatrice, tempered with apricot jam, custard, vanilla, &c., besides whipped cream. One of the nicest and most quickly-prepared sweets is cream, whipped stithy, sweetened, flavoured with vanilla and cognac, or lemon, and mixed with brown bread-crumbs. It should be served piled high in an old china bowl, and strewn with more crumbs and glace cherries. If you like a compote of chestnuts, pile some stithy-whipped plain cream in a dish, and cover it with the chestnuts rubbed through a coarse sieve, then place round it a wreath of slices of orange compote, flavoured with Maraschino, or bananas dressed with rum. Coffee- mo usse, gooseberry fool, or egg nogg (made of whipped cream, raw yolk of egg, powdered sugar, sherry, lemon- juice, and a dash of rum), and similar semi-liquid sweets look very pretty served in tea or coffee cups and saucers of old china. You may have the saucers placed round, and the cups handed on the large cake or bread- and-butter plates of an old-fashioned service in lieu of a tray. This looks quainter than custard glasses, which are old-fashioned.

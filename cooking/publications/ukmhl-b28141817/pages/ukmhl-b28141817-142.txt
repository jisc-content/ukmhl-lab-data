130 DINNERS IN MINIATURE. some patty pans with very thin short paste, and then fill them with the folloAving mixture ; Blanch ^ lb. pistachio kernels, and pound them in a mortar till they are quite smooth, with a whole egg, a little grated lemon- peel, and ^ lb. castor sugar.

With a smaller cutter of the same shape, stamp the upper surface of the cakes thus formed, so as to make an incision about \ inch deep. Remove the inner round, and scoop out the interior of the cake, so as to form a hollow case. Almost fill these cases with whipped cream, flavoured with a little vanilla or lemon, and cover the top of the cream with a spoonful of apricot jam or apple jelly. Melt £ lb. icing sugar in a saucepan, with the juice of a lemon and two table- spoonfuls of white rum or French brandy.

Decorate with chopped pistachios while the icing is yet soft.

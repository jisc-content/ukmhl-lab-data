BATTERIE DE CUISINE. 103 ance at table. A casserole is a great addition to one’s cooking gear, and should always be sent to the table with a napkin pinned neatly round outside. Of late years the mode has obtained in Paris of sending up dishes in the vessel wherein they were cooked, the croute au pot in its brown earthenware pipkin ; the sole Normande in its baking dish ; the stewed fowl in its casserole, &c. A marble pestle and mortar are expensive, and the less weighty ones in Wedgwood ware serve equally well for most purposes. For making puff pastry a marble slab is a great luxury, and can be acquired at a sale for a few shillings. Machines for facilitating the manual labour of cookery grow more numerous and more complex every year, but the ones really needed are not ruinous. A coffee-mill and a mincing machine are perhaps the most indispensable, but a mechanical bread-grater is a very useful addition to the kitchen, and so is a deft little contrivance for cutting up vege- tables for soup. A coffee-roaster is really required if you wish coffee to fulfil its noblest possibilities, and is not expensive. Two American notions I have seen described which should surely be as successful here as across the Atlantic—a cake-beater, which would obviate the weary toil incident to the making of pound or sponge cake, and a meat-chopper which really cuts instead of mashing meat. There is such a variety of ice machines that it is difficult to exalt one above its fellow ; but after due experience I should declare for the American Star machines, as satisfactory in every way—durable, simple, reliable, and cheap. An ice machine is a really econo- mical extravagance, and helps one to vary one’s dinners at a small cost ; sorbets or granitos, ice puddings, ordinary ices, or iced coffee being all possible with it.

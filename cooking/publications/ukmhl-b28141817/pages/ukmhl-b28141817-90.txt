DINNERS IN MINIATURE. 78 cookery book recipes will enable one to produce even a poor likeness of the staple dish of Hindostan. In the first place it is not possible here to pluck the herbs and spices from the tree and shrub, and to pound them freshly as required for the curry ; yet on this depends much of the incomparable flavour and subtlety of an Indian curry. This, however, is but one of the reasons of failure, which are many.

DINNERS IN MINIATURE. 132 a large claret-glassful of brandy, ditto rum, ditto Maraschino. Mix all these thoroughly, and freeze well, as the amount of alcohol in the mixture makes this a somewhat tardy process. When the punch is frozen quite firm, have ready two whites of eggs, whipped stiffly, into which you have lightly mixed 2 oz. powdered sugar, as for meringues ; stir this by degrees, and a little at a time, into the punch with a wooden spoon, working it in thoroughly till the mixture becomes less solid, and more resembles a very thick cream. It must be suffi- ciently liquid to enable you to pour it into the glasses in which it is served. If you carry out this recipe carefully, Helen herself could have served the heroes with no more divine nepenthe than will be the result. Claret Granito is a less troublesome and less costly sorbet to prepare. Squeeze the juice of six oranges and one lemon to half a pint of syrup, and add to this the rind or zest of four oranges, rubbed off on sugar, and a bottle of claret. Taste to see if sweet enough, and then freeze; a liqueur glass of Curagoa may be added. Y. P.—Brown Bread Cream.—Here is a delicious sweet which will take very little time to prepare, "when next your dinner has to be expanded at a moment’s notice. Whip a pint of good cream quite stiff, sweeten with powdered sugar, flavoured with a teaspoonful of essence of vanilla, and a liqueur glass of French brandy. Have 6 oz. of coarse brown bread-crumbs, made by rubbing the bread through a cullender, and mix these lightly but thoroughly with the cream. Pile as high and rockily as possible and strew with a few more crumbs, and 2 oz. of glace cherries, or at this time of year you might use small fresh or wild straw- berries, previously steeped in a little liqueur and lemon- juice.

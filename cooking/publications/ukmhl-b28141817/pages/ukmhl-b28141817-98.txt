Icing should he used when the cake to be decorated is largely compounded of butter, while the flavoured butters are more suitable when the cake is of sponge. A good variety of the latter kind is a tall sponge cake—it must be very fresh, and home- made, if possible—cut horizontally into slices, each of which must be spread thickly with coffee or pistachio- green butter (flavoured with Chartreuse).

This cake should be baked in a plain round tin, and, when cold, be served either covered with whipped cream, or soaked with rum or a mixture of sherry and brandy, and masked with any sweet butter preferred. This is a cold sweet of a really high order, and is easy, though somewhat tedious, to accomplish.

So prepared, the cakes should be masked with dull icing, prepared by just melting (not boiling) lb. icing sugar, with

11 III. TABLE GARNITURE. Fine linen, clean and white ; silver as bright as it could be ; bubble-clear glass, and spotless porcelain, together with wax lights galore ; and after dinner a dark and polished expanse of old Spanish mahogany, wherein were reflected the golden gleam of sherry and the tawny glow of port, and in which could be caught the mirrored glimpses of the rich tints of the fruits which decked the board—these were the principles of table arrangement and decoration some thirty years ago. They are so perfect, as far as they go, that it is incumbent on us, who have adopted a more elaborate fashion of ornamenting our tables, to give a reason for the faith that is in us, and to let all our adornments have their basis in sense and simplicity. A centre arrangement and decoration has always been allowed since the times of the mediEeval “ salt,” and it is well to work outward from this in our minor arrangements, and so make them keep their places. The basis which has first to be considered is the glass, china, plate, and linen which, when selected, will have to serve us for many years ; with which our various dainty devices of fruit and flowers (changing with the changing year) will have to harmonize, and which, therefore, should first harmonize with each other, and be as simple in colour and graceful in form

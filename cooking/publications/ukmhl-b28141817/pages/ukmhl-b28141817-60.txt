DINNERS IN MINIATURE. 48 from what is drunk at table. Claret and Chablis or Sauterne, however, cannot be so treated, as they will not keep, and they are really the wines best suited to delicate cooking, sherry and port being too heavy and alcoholic for most dishes. Keeping a few half-bottles of light French white wine on hand will often save the extravagant use, or rather misuse, of sherry in dishes where white wine is a necessity ; and one glass of Chablis being given to the cook for the required purpose, the two glasses remaining will serve as a fair excuse to a wife for beginning that day’s dinner with the luxury of oysters. To speak first of twice-laid entrees, the very first dish that faces us is that bete noire, hashed mutton. Franca- telli’s recipe for mutton hashed venison fashion is so successful in transforming that tough and tasteless dish into an entree worthy of the name, that I am fain to give it here, very slightly modified. The mutton should be cut in rather larger and thicker pieces than usual, well floured and seasoned with pepper and salt. The sauce is prepared by chopping a teaspoonful of eschalot very fine, and boiling it for five minutes with a glass of port wine, a dessertspoonful of Oude or Worcester sauce, a teaspoonful of Liebig dissolved in two tablespoonfuls of hot water, and a dessertspoonful of red currant jelly. The meat should simmer very slowly by the side of the fire in this sauce for half an hour—if it boils it is spoilt —and be served in an entree or vegetable dish, garnished with fried sippets and accompanied by French beans. If it be carefully prepared in this fashion, it will be a very captious critic who objects to hashed mutton. Hashes and minces are legion, while rissoles, cro- quettes, and all their tribe need but scant mention. I may, however, quote an excellent simple recipe for a croquette mixture, which is capable of infinite variety.

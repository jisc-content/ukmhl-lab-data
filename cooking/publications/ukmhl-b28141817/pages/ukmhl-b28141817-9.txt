PREFACE, The number of admirable cookery books already in use renders it advisable to say that this little book does not attempt to usurp their place, but to supplement them. It is the hope that so considered it may supply a want which has prompted its re- appearance in this form. The handful of recipes at the end, gathered from the Cookery Correspondence of The Queen, may seem to have been selected with small care as to their sequence or arrangement. As, however, they were such as were inquired for by readers of this series of papers, the apparent demand for them must be the excuse for their insertion here. E. Earl. Tonbridge, October, 1891'.

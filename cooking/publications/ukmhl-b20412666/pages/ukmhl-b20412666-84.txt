Sturgeon, Stewed. â€” This is one of the best ways of cooking a portion of this fish. Take two or three slices about an inch thick, let them steep in vinegar awhile. Dry them, dip in flour, and place in some frothing butter in a covered stewpan. Let them brown on both sides, then remove the fish, and in its place put a few shallots, half a small carrot cut into dice, and some button mushrooms. When these have browned, cover them with half a pint of clear veal broth, a good tumbler- ful of claret, a teaspoonful of salt and pepper mixed, then replace the slices of sturgeon. Let all stew together for up- wards of an hour, when remove the fish on to a dish, sti'ain the sauce from the vegetables, thicken it with a little flour rolled in butter, and add a spoonful of some sharp sauce. Pour over the fish on the dish.

If this is very red the flesh will prove to be red, though not so red as salmon. There are two or three kinds of trout: common, sea, and white trout. Sea trout reaches a good size, white trout never does. River trout are most delicious and highly esteemed ; the most delicate in flavour are those which weigh from three- quarters to one pound. Trout, which is in season from May to September, is in perfection in June.

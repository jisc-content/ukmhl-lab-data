CHOOSING AND BUYING FISH. I3 Carp and tench are pond rather than river fish, and both have a great fondness for burying themselves in mud, and ov^^ing to this the flesh has often a shght muddy taste ; for this reason the fish should lie in strong salt and vi^ater for a few hours, then be well cleansed in clear spring water. Both are at their best in the winter months. The tench, though a smaller fish, is richer and more delicate than the carp. They are useful fish to families residing in the country. Although the pike attains to a consider- able size in England, it is small in com- parison with its brethren found in Russian and Lapland waters. Indeed it more truly deserves to be called a Russian fish, so much more abundant and popular is it there. In colour the skin is a pale olive- grey, with several yellowish spots on the sides, and the mouth is furnished with a prodigious number of teeth, which has earned for it the name of ''fresh-water shark." It was at one time a very popular article of food, and is still considered a good fish for the table. In some countries the fish is salted and dried, and the roe made into caviare.

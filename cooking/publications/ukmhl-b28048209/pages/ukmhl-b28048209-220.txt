212 dower. That known as Zephyranthes Candida produces a single flower in October, with three white interior lobes, the three exterior being fringed with pink. It delights in a warm, dry soil, and is quite hardy, the only care it requires being to be taken up every third or fourth year for division of the bulb. The Zephyranthes Atamasco is equally hardy with the fore- going, and, if anything, handsomer. The Zephyranthes rosea is best grown in a frame, in pots. UNWIN BROTHERS, LIMITED.

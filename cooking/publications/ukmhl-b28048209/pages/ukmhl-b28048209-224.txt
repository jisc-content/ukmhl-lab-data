T. FISHER UNWIN, Publisher, 11, Paternoster Buildings, London, E.G. 5 THE STICKIT MINISTER AND SOME COMMON MEN S. R- CROCKETT Eleventh Edition. Crown 8vo., cloth, Os. “ Here is one of the books which are at present coming singly and at long intervals, like early swallows, to herald, it is to be hoped, a larger flight When the larger flight appears, the winter of our discontent will have passed, and we shall be able to boast that the short story can make a home east as well as west of the Atlantic. There is plenty of human nature—of the Scottish variety, which is a very good variety—in * The Stickit Minister’ and its com- panion stories ; plenty of humour, too, of that dry, pawky kind which is a monopoly of ‘ Caledonia, stern and wild ’; and, most plentiful of all, a quiet -arception and reticent rendering of that underlying pathos of life which is to 6e discovered, not in Scotland alone, but everywhere that a man is found who can see with the heart and the imagination as well as the brain. Mr. Crockett has given us a book that is not merely good, it is what his countrymen would call ‘ by-ordinar’ good,’ which, being interpreted into a tongue understanded of the southern herd, means that it is excellent, with a somewhat exceptional kind of excellence.”—Daily Chronicle. THE LILAC BONNET SUN- BT S. R. CROCKETT Sixth Edition. Crown 8vo., cloth, 6s. % * Mr. Crockett’s * Lilac Sun-Bonnet ’ ‘ needs no bush.’ Here is a pretty love tale, and the landscape and rural descriptions carry the exile back into the Kingdom of Galloway. Here, indeed, is the scent of bog-myrtle and peat. After inquiries among the fair, I learn that of all romances, they best love, not ‘ sociology,’ not ‘ theology,’ still less, open manslaughter, for a motive, but Just love’s young dream, chapter after chapter. From Mr. Crockett they get what they want, ‘ hot with,’ as Thackeray admits that he liked it." Mr. Andrew Lang in Longman s Magattne.

F. C. GOULD’S FROISSART. SIR BLUNDELL DE MAPLE PEOTESTETH THAT TOWEL-HORSES WOULD HAVE BETTER SERVED THE ARMY THAN THE HORSES THAT HAD BEEN BOUGHT IN HUNGARY. TWO VOLUMES. 1. FROISSART S MODERN CHRONICLES, 1901. 2. FROISSART’S MODERN CHRONICLES, 1902. TOLD AND PICTURED BY F. C. GOULD. Each volume Cloth, foolscap 4to, 3T. 6d. Also a Fine Edition of Vol. //., limited to 50 copies, on Japan Papery numbered and signed, 21 s. net. “The second volume of Mr. F. C. Gould’s ‘Froissart’s Modern Chronicles ’ is fully equal to the first. The rich vein of pure gold, which the artist-author has struck, is far from exhausted. F. C. G. ranks easily first among English political caricaturists ; w'e doubt, indeed, if he is surpassed by any living exponent of his very special craft.” Daily Telegraph. “Mr. Gould, I think, may well be ‘orgulous’ in having written a delightful work of light satire, in which, as in all he does, there is never a foul stroke. No words of mine can paint the joy of the lover of humorous pencil-work, who shall get hold of the ‘ Modern Chronicles.’ It is, after all, as a picture-maker that F. C. G. stands entirely alone.”— Vanity Fair. “The drollest, most ingenious, and most versatile of living political caricaturists. ”— World. T. FISHER UNWIN, 11, Paternoster Buildings, London, E.C. 29

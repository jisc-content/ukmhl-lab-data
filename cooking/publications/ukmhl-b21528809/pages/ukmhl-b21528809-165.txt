ENTREES *53 of sifted sugar, half a tea-spoonful of made mustard, a tea-spoonful of French mustard, and a liberal squeeze of lemon juice. Make very hot, pour over and around the veal, and serve at once. If liked, this sauce may be made rather richer by using two ozs. of butter instead of one, and some cooks add also the well beaten yolks of two eggs. In the latter case the sauce must not be allowed to boil up after the eggs have been added, or it will curdle, and be spoilt. It should be made very hot, but it emphatically must not boil. A little cream is also an improvement. About half a gill will be sufficient.

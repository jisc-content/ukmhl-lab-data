233 ICES sugar in a clean enamelled iron stew-pan, add to it half a pint of water and the juice of a large lemon freed from pips and carefully strained; bring gently to the boil, add the cherries and kernels, and continue boiling for ten minutes. Next drain through a hair sieve into a clean basin, and reserve. Place the cherries, etc., in a mortar, and pound them to a stiff paste. Then add them to the syrup, together with a few drops of cochineal, by way of colouring. Add a pint of either sweetened milk, cream, or custard, whichever is most convenient, and a wine-glassful of kirsch. Mix and put through a hair sieve. Place in the freezer, and freeze in the usual way. If to be moulded, this must be done as usual when three parts frozen. Then turn out carefully and serve with wafers handed separately. Creme de Chocolat.—This is a very favourite ice with children, and is equally nice for a dinner-party or a supper or garden- party menu. Take f lb. of Cadbury’s vanilla

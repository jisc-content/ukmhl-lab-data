HOUSEKEEPING 299 £i a week per head will allow of quite luxurious living. Let it be remembered that ios. per head in the dining-room means about 8s. per head for the kitchen, and i is. per head (dining- room) ios. for the kitchen; and the latter is quite ample, even with a large establish- ment to cater for. The 15s., 17s. or £1 above mentioned referring of course to the dining-room catering solely. To revert for a moment to the other end of the scale, it is possible to keep house for as little as 8s. or 9s. per head per week, but this sum will only allow of the plainest possible food. No poultry unless it be foreign, and of course foreign meat, while rigid economy must be practised. On an average it will I fear be only possible to allow meat once a day, for alas, now-a-days the purchasing power of a sovereign (as regards butcher meat more especially) is only just about half what it was two or three years back.

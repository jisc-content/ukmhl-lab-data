Note, however, that it must not be sweetened, as the marmalade is quite sufficiently sweet in itself, and if too much sugar is added the ice will not freeze properly. Very nice, too, for a children’s party is a rice cream ice, which is made thus:— Creme de Riz.—Place a pint of fresh milk in a clean stew-pan. Add to it 4 ozs. of castor sugar, the peel, but not the pith, of a lemon, a little cinnamon, and two or three bay leaves. Simmer very slowly until the milk tastes strongly of the flavouring, but take care that it does not reduce. Mean- while mix 3 ozs. of ground rice to a creamy paste by means of a little cold milk. Then add, by degrees, the flavoured milk, stirring all the while. Return to a clean double sauce-pan, and bring very gently to the boil, stirring all the time. Continue to stir until the mixture leaves the sides of the sauce-pan.

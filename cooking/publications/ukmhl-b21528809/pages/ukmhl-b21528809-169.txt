ENTREES 157 of sweet herbs, a tea-spoonful each of finely minced parsley and shallots, and a little grated lemon peel. Add just enough weak stock or water to cover, and simmer slowly for an hour, taking care that the stock does not reduce, i.e. boil away. Then strain off, reserve, and when cold clear it free from fat. Note that if in a hurry this may be done by straining the stock through a serviette previously wrung out tightly in cold water. Place an oz. of butter in a clean stew-pan. As soon as it oils, add the joints of fowl, and cook till of a bright golden brown hue. Then strain away all the remain- ing grease. Add the stock made as described above, together with a couple of ozs. of previously cooked mushrooms and a glass of cooking sherry and cook till tender. Thicken with from half an oz. of flour and half an oz. of butter to an oz. of each, kneaded together. Stir till of the consistency of double cream, make very hot, and serve accompanied by dressed macaroni.

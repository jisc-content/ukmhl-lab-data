7 INTRODUCTION wonderful palates, refined to a degree, and equally I have met with women of gentle blood in whom palate was to all intents and purposes an unknown quantity. Granted then that palate is the first, second Good health . . . . a sine qua non and third requisite in the woman who aims at for a cook making cookery her career, there are yet others to be taken into consideration, and of these good health is the principal. An anaemic girl should emphatically not choose a cookâ€™s career. The close proximity to the fire, the enervating atmosphere of even the best ventilated kitchen imaginable, the draughts, the constant changes from heat to cold, from the extreme warmth of the kitchen where she perhaps has to grill a chicken to the iciness of the larder where she has to dive into the refrigerator for something, or prepare a drawn sauce, or an ice, the constant association with food, food, food, from morning till night is in itself quite sufficient to destroy any but the most robust appetite. All these things are extremely bad for the anaemically inclined.

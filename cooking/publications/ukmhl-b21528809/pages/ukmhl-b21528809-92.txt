8o COOKERY AND HOUSEKEEPING How to make a successful Bechamel sauce every cook self-taught or otherwise should possess is “The Book of Sauces,”* by S. B. Pownall, which deals with the subject of sauce-making in its entirety. Let me add here that a cook who can make a simple Bechamel sauce to perfection can achieve any sauce no matter how elaborate. The following is a reliable recipe for an ordinary Bechamel sauce of average thickness. Place rather more than half a pint of milk in a delicately clean sauce-pan, add to it a bouquet garni, i.e. parsley, thyme, bay-leaf, etc., tied together. An onion notched in order to allow the juice to escape. A slice of turnip and a little celery, or failing celery use celery seed tied up in a bit of muslin. Cover the sauce-pan tightly, bring the milk to the simmering point, and then let it con- tinue to simmer for fifteen minutes, but take care that it does not reduce. Next strain the milk and reserve it. Place i oz. of butter in a clean pan, and let it just melt, * Published by Chapman & Hall.

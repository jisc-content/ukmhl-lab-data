STOCKS, SOUPS, PUREES, ETC. 47 Consommes I have already told you how stock may be cleared, i.e. by allowing 6 ozs. of scraped raw beef to every quart of stock, and then adding the well-whisked white of an egg, and simmering slowly for an hour.

Add to it the well- s beaten whites of two large eggs and the egg-shells, which must be well crushed and then mixed with the whites. The shells should, of course, be washed before they are broken. Mix thoroughly, and then add to it a pint and a half of the stock remaining. Place in a clean sauce-pan and bring gently to the boil, stirring all the while. Then draw the pan to the side of the fire, and simmer very gently for twenty minutes.

39 METHOD OF BRAISING as indicated above, and then when the joint Bceuf a la has been dished up, a gill of tomato catsup, and from two to four ozs. of previously cooked macaroni cut into two-inch lengths must be added at the same time as the port wine, which may be increased to a wine- glassful. Make hot and finish as directed. In the genuine Boeuf a la Napolitaine garlic finds a place, but this may be omitted if disliked. From half a clove to a clove of garlic very finely minced and fried at the same time as the other vegetables is the right quantity to use. Mutton, veal and beef are all suitable for this recipe also, whilst a tough old rooster may be made to appear quite a tender spring chicken when treated in the same mode.

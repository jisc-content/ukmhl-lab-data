23 INTRODUCTION proceeds to over-garnish it. I have generally found that pupils from the Cookery School are the worst offenders in this respect, send- ing to table dishes “all glorious without,” but lacking, alas! most sadly within. The self-taught cook should aim at the The happy happy medium, and learn to dish up daintily and quickly at the same time so that that most desirable of consummations may be arrived at—a dish which looks as good as it tastes, and tastes as good as it looks! And above all let me impress upon the send things self-taught cook the importance of sending things hot to table. The flavour of the daintiest dish imaginable is spoilt if it arrives on one’s plate in a luke-warm condition. Personally I hold that a hot plat cannot be too hot, the time for transit from kitchen to dining-room, the serving, etc., etc., tend so much to diminish the heat, and a luke-warm dinner is neither a very appetising nor a very digestible form of hospitality.

*55 ENTREES add half a pound of mushrooms (previously cleaned in the usual way, i.e. with a bit of flannel and a little salt), and continue to simmer slowly. When done dish up the meat on a hot dish and garnish it with the mushrooms. Remove the onion, mace, clove, etc., and thicken the liquor in which it was cooked with an oz. of flour and an oz. of butter kneaded together, add pepper and salt to taste. Make very hot, strain through a heated gravy strainer over and around the veal, and serve accompanied by chipped potatoes or artichoke chips. Fowl and pheasant may also be cooked after the fore- going fashion, and will be found very good. Indeed, an old fowl treated a la blanquette if allowed plenty of time for cooking is practically indistinguishable from a spring chicken. When stock is not to hand, milk may be used in its place. Indeed some cooks always use milk for a blanquette, but per- sonally I have found that stock gives the best results.

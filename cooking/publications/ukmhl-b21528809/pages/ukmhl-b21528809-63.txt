A tiny grate of nutmeg may also be added if the flavouring is liked. Colour a pale green by means of a few drops of spinach green- ing, or pink, with a few drops of carmine colouring. Butter a round jam-pot very thickly, and then strain the mixture into this through a fine gravy strainer. Place in a sauce-pan half full of boiling water, and steam till firm. Note.—The water should only come half-way up the jam-pot. Leave till cold, then cut into strips, and each strip into tiny squares or fancy shapes. Rinse quickly in very warm water, and then add to the soup. Note.—If made a day or two before it is required, the custard—i.e. the pot contain- ing it—should be left in cold water, or else it will spoil and be unfit for use. This latter, by the way, is one of the most delicate garnishes it is possible to make.

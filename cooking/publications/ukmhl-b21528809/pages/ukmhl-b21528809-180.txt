168 COOKERY AND HOUSEKEEPING Pheasant, Teal, Ptarmigan, etc., cooked after the same recipe is bound to be a success, but if the slightest portion of grease is allowed to remain behind, the flavour will be spoilt. Pheasant is excellent treated after this recipe, and so too is black game, ptarmigan or partridge. Hazel hen or guinea fowl may also be cooked in the same manner; while even a rabbit is amenable to it. Widgeon and teal are also suitable, but with these plain olives should be used in place of the olive farcis indicated in the recipe. Wild duck, too, may be treated in the same manner, but in this case a few finely chopped red chillies should be added for the better- ment of the sauce. Ordinary olives, or the olives farcis indicated in the recipe may be used at discretion, but owing perhaps to the strong flavour of the duck the ordinary (i.e. unstuffed) olives, I am inclined to think, give the best results. With wild duck a wine-glassful of cooking port, and a few grains of cayenne are a great improvement to the sauce.

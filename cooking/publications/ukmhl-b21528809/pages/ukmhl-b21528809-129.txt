VEGETABLES IN GENERAL 117 or three cucumbers into one-inch lengths. Place them in a marinade composed of a table-spoonful of oil, two table-spoonsful of vinegar, and a table-spoonful of salt, and leave for two hours. Next place two ozs. of fresh butter in a clean stew-pan, add to it a little grated nutmeg, a dessert-spoonful of sifted sugar, and let it just melt. Then drain the cucumbers carefully, and add them. Simmer very slowly over a slack fire for thirty-five minutes, next drain off the butter, add a gill of well made white sauce, the well beaten yolks of four eggs mixed with half a gill of cream, and a dessert-spoonful of finely minced parsley. Make very hot, then add the juice of half a small lemon, first strained carefully. Make hot again, but do not allow the sauce to actually boil, or it will curdle and be spoilt. Garnish with a border of fried fleurons of pastry, and serve at once. Cucumbers which are old and tough will require rather more cooking than those which are young and tender.

ii4 COOKERY AND HOUSEKEEPING carefully, and reserve. Place two ounces of fresh butter in a clean stew-pan, as soon as it oils add to it two finely minced shallots, a table-spoonful of minced parsley, a little grated nutmeg, the juice of half a lemon freed from pips and carefully strained, and a little minced chives and chervil, about half a tea-spoonful of each. Make very hot, but do not allow the butter to reduce. Then add the beans, and toss again for three or four Croutons of minutes. Pile up in the centre of a hot dish, garnish with fried croutons, which, by the way, are best made from stale bread, and serve. They should be about a quarter of an inch thick, and are better for a garnish for vegetables such as beans, spinach, cabbage, etc., if cut into finger lengths. Note that to fry croutons successfully the fat must absolutely boil before they are added, and too many should not be fried together, or the fat will become chilled and spoilt.

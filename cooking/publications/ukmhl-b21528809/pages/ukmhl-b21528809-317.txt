HOUSEKEEPING u V 3°5 nection let me remark en passant that she will find a knowledge of book-keeping of in- estimable service to her. Weekly books should be carefully checked and paid weekly, all small sums which may be said to come under the heading of petty cash, sundries, or current expenses, no matter how small, should be entered in a book each day.

There should be a fixed time once a week, once a month, or once a quarter for paying everything, and of all of these the “ once a week ” system is the best, the cheapest and in the long run the surest road to really successful housekeeping. “No bills of any sort” should be the No bills young housekeeper’s first motto, whether she be professional or amateur for in that way lies Success.

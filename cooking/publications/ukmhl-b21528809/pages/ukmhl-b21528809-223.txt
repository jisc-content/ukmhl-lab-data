2 I I SAVOURIES Yet another nice cold savoury may be made thus :— Cro£ttes A la Royale.—Take the hard Croutes a la Royale boiled yolks of three eggs, a table-spoonful of anchovy paste, and a table-spoonful of fresh butter. Work all well together, season highly with pepper and salt, and add a few drops of lemon juice. Have ready some rounds of fried bread, allowing one for each person. Pile the mixture on to these, dust with cayenne and serve. Another variation on the above may be made by halving the eggs, and then filling the whites with a mixture made as described. In this case the savoury is know as “GEufs aux Anchois.”

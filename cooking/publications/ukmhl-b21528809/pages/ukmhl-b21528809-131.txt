VEGETABLES IN GENERAL 119 met with in England, and therefore it possesses the charm of novelty. Take two green artichokes. Soak them in salt and water for at least a couple of hours before they are required. Then pull off all the outer leaves carefully, and trim the bottoms quite smooth with a very sharp knife. Next divide each artichoke into quarters, and remove all the fibre. Trim as neatly as possible, and parboil in salted water for five or six minutes. Then drain thoroughly. Spread a fireproof china sautapan with two ozs. of fresh butter, dust this over with a dessert- spoonful of sifted sugar, then add the quar- tered artichokes. Season highly with pepper and salt. Add a large glass of white wine, and a gill of very strong stock. Cover the pan, and simmer very slowly over a slack fire for about three quarters of an hour or a little longer; by this time if cooked with sufficient gentleness the artichokes should be of a deep yellow hue, and brightly glazed. Dish them up conicalwise, showing only the fonds.

243 NURSERY COOKERY degree. Then strain through a cloth, which has been wrung out in cold water, into a clean saucepan; add salt to taste. Make hot and serve at once. The foregoing are all recipes suited for quite tiny children just past the milk diet stage, but when they get a little older, say from two years onwards, a little vegetable by way of flavouring, say an onion or a little celery, may be cooked with the broth with advantage. Leeks, too, are good, and now and again a little carrot will do no harm, while Spanish onions are decidedly good, especially for children who are inclined to be very wakeful or who do not sleep well. Turnips, however, are to be avoided, as they often give rise to indigestion. Of course, it must be under- stood that a little of any of the vegetables named are only cooked in the soup; they must not be served in it, as in the majority of cases they would do positive harm to the childâ€™s digestion.

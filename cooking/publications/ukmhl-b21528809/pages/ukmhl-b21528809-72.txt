60 COOKERY AND HOUSEKEEPING with a quart of either stock or milk. If economy is an object water will do. Add to it an oz. of butter, pepper and salt to taste, and a tiny grate of nutmeg. Simmer very slowly until cooked. Meanwhile take all the white meat from a large fresh crab and reserve it on a plate. Add the re- mainder of the crab to the cooked rice, place in a clean mortar, and pound vigorously till it becomes a paste. Next add to it a quart of well flavoured stock (note, it should be boiling hot), and rub the whole through a hair sieve, return to a clean saucepan. Add to it the claw meat, chopped first into neat squares, season to taste with a little, a very little, cayenne, a little essence of anchovy, and a few drops of carmine colouring. Fin- ally add a pint of cream, or half a pint of milk and half a pint of cream, stir over a slow fire until very hot, but do not allow it to actually boil or it will curdle and be spoilt. Serve with fried croutons handed separately.

ICES 215 % spoilt. Here are some recipes for very simply made and inexpensive ices :— Cr&me Glacee a la Vanille Well whisk two eggs together, the yolks first and then the whites. Add to them \ lb. of sifted sugar, and, by degrees, a pint of new milk. Place in a clean enamelled iron stew-pan over a slow fire, and whisk continuously until nearly boiling. Then add to it £ oz. of the best leaf gelatine. Continue to stir until the gelatine has thoroughly dissolved. Then strain through a hair sieve, add a few drops of essence of vanilla, and place in the freezer. Work until three parts frozen, and then, if it is to be moulded, empty it into the mould, pressing it down carefully. Place a piece of white paper between the ice and the cover in order to prevent sticking, and leave in the freezer until completely frozen. Turn out carefully, and serve with wafer biscuits, handed separately.

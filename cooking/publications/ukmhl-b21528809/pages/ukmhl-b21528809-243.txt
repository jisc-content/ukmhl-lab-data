231 ICES Take a Hovis loaf (it must be stale, but not too stale, or it will be unfit for use), and crumble sufficient to yield one pint of bread- crumbs. Place these in a clean basin, and add to them eight table-spoonfuls of maraschino or chartreuse. Mix thoroughly, and leave for half-an-hour. Then add to them a pint of either new milk or cream, the latter for preference. Mix again and freeze. When frozen, serve piled high on a fancy dessert- paper, and hand wafers separately. If liked, this ice may also be moulded. In that case it should be three parts frozen first, before being placed in the mould. Then finish as directed for the other ices. Where the flavour of maraschino is not liked, noyeau or benedictine may be substi- tuted for it, but as all these are very strong liqueurs indeed, it would be perhaps advisable to dilute them with half the amount of ordi- nary fruit syrup, such as orange or lemon, which will not destroy the flavour of the liqueurs in question.

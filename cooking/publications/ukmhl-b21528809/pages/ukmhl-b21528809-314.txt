302 COOKERY AND HOUSEKEEPING sheet, being replaced by a clean one. This in a family of average size—father, mother, two children, nurse, and two maids would mean four single sheets and one double one every week. Six sheets in all. All white counterpanes or white bedspreads should be changed at least once a month; for the nurses and for the servants’ beds the coloured linen bedspreads may be recom- mended when economy has to be very strictly studied, but for the nursery whenever possible white should be used. Servants’ coloured counterpanes need only be changed once in six weeks. Pillow slips should be changed once every week on the servants’ beds, and twice a week on the mistress’ and the chil- dren’s. While the pillow shams for outside use, will only require changing once a fort- night if carefully folded every night. Of towels four to each room should be allowed, and a bath sheet weekly. Servants, one towel each weekly and one bath sheet each, which latter should last a fortnight.

STOCKS, SOUPS, PUREES, ETC. 41 small households fresh bones would have to be bought. I give a recipe for both modes. Take three pounds of cooked meat bones, and chop them into pieces of a suitable size (remove the marrow, if any, as this makes such a nice savoury). Place the bones in a deep stew-pan, add to them two quarts of cold water and three tea-spoonfuls of salt. Bring very gently to the boil, then add a bouquet garni, i.e. parsley, thyme, bay leaf, etc., a dozen pepper-corns, an onion stuck with a couple of cloves, two carrots, scraped and sliced, a turnip peeled cut into small pieces, and, if possible, half a stick of celery. Continue boiling for five or six minutes, then remove any scum which may have arisen, cover the pan, draw it to the side of the fire and simmer very slowly for five or six hours, but take care that the stock does not reduce. There is little danger of this, however, if it is allowed to cook sufficiently slowly. Next strain the stock through a hair sieve into a clean basin, and leave in Soup from cooked meat bones of various kinds

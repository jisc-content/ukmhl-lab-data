286 COOKERY AND HOUSEKEEPING general thing, whole days are not often allowed in small establishments. A very important item of housekeeping is the regulating of The Coal Bill The better It is practically impossible here to state regulation of . the Coal Bill what amount of coal should be used in a household, because the average varies so much. Some kitchen ranges I have met with can dispose of a ton a week ! Two great aids to economy as regards the coal bill are, first; to insist that the kitchen dampers are rigidly kept in when the fire is not needed for cooking purposes; secondly, the cinders. Now the average maid, I am aware, regards the sifting of cinders with something akin to horror, and I am afraid in my heart of hearts I secretly sympathise with her, for a more disagreeable operation on a hot, or for the matter of that, a cold day, it would be difficult to imagine.

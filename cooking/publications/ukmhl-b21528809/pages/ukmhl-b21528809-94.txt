82 COOKERY AND HOUSEKEEPING Two very The two most important things to bear in thing^Â°when mind when making sauces of this kind are, sauce making ^ ^ flour anJ butter must be SUfH_ ciently cooked before the milk is added, and that the mixture must be taken from the fire and whisked till smooth after each quantum of milk has been added; and 2nd., that the mixture should on no account be allowed to come to the boil until it is perfectly smooth and creamy, and quite free from lumps. Once a lump has been boiled it is not possible to smooth the sauce except by straining it. Where lumps are present this implies a cer- tain amount of waste. Bear in mind that it is useless to try and make sauce successfully upon a very fierce fire, as the sauce is almost certain to catch and be spoiled. Melted butter is made in precisely the same way, but water is used in place of the milk indicated in the foregoing recipe, and the butter and flour used are in the propor- tion of 2 ozs. of butter to an oz. of flour. The water of course is not flavoured, and only salt is used as a seasoning.

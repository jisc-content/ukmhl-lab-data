HOUSEKEEPING 261 of her own, or whose health is not of the most robust order, that offers a good field to the young professional housekeeper. As I have already said the first of her necessary qualities is that she must be strong. Supposing such an one possessing no previous experience desires to fit herself for a post of this kind. How may she best set about it? There are, it is true, one or two domestic centres, or training colleges where it is possible to obtain a course of instruction (long or short according to the amount one is prepared to pay), in all the domestic arts, but with these I do not pro- pose to deal, since the fees, moderate though they may be, are in the vast majority of cases quite out of the question.

How can she best set about her course of self-instruction ? Colleges for Domestic Training Notably The Guild of Household Dames, Cheltenham. Terms on Application

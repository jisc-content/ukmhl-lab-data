CONCERNING FISH COOKERY, ETC. 75 spoonful of anchovy essence, a tiny grate of nutmeg, and pepper and salt to taste. Toss all together over a slow fire until very hot, but do not allow it to actually boil, or it will curdle and be spoilt. Then use as directed above. Another nice plat of fish is red or grey mullets, with fine herbs. For this, take from three to four mullets and wash them well in salt and water, then dry carefully. Place them in a thickly-buttered fireproof china dish, and sprinkle them thickly with minced parsley, chopped mushrooms, minced shallots, and fried bread-crumbs; add pepper and salt to taste, and moisten with half a wine-glassful of Harvey sauce, a glass of port and a tea-spoonful of essence of anchovy. Bake in a moderate oven for from twenty to thirty minutes. When done, dish up on a hot dish; add to the liquor in which they were cooked a little grated nutmeg, the juice of half a lemon, freed from pips, and, by degrees, half a tea-spoonful of flour.

116 COOKERY AND HOUSEKEEPING to them two finely minced cabbage lettuces, a dozen spring onions, a good sprig of parsley, a spoonful of sifted sugar, and salt to taste. Cover tightly and stew very gently for thirty-five minutes; should any liquor remain, reduce it quickly, then dredge in by degrees a dessert-spoonful of dried and sifted flour, and two ounces of butter. Toss over the fire until very hot. Dish up on a hot dish, garnish with fried croutons, and serve at once. The spring onions may be omitted if liked, but they are a great improvement to the dish. If used they should be cut into one-inch lengths. When spring onions are not to hand a dessert-spoonful of finely minced chives may be used in their stead. Indeed some cooks prefer this mode. French beans are also excellent if treated after this recipe, but they require much longer stewing, and the amount of butter should be increased to two ounces. CoNCOMBRES A LA PoULETTE. Cut tWO

93 CHAPTER VI HOW TO This useful chapter will greatly simplify the recipes, and should be mastered by all, except those who are thoroughly versed in the various branches of cookery. Mix This deserves very careful study, for next in importance to care in measuring, comes the manner of mixing. The most accurate measurement of the best materials is often rendered useless by a neglect to put them together properly, and the blame is usually charged to the oven or the recipe. There are three distinct ways of mixing; stirring, beating, and cutting or folding. Stir Let the bowl of the spoon rest slightly on the bottom of the mixing basin, then move it round and round in widening circles without lifting the spoon out of the mixture, except to scrape the sides of the bowl occasionally. Stir slowly at first, to avoid spattering; add the liquid gradually, and be sure the bowl of the spoon (not the edge or the tip merely) touches the bottom and sides of the basin. This is mashing as well as stirring, and the mixture soon becomes a paste. When perfectly smooth and free from lumps, add more liquid until you have the desired consistency. We stir flour and water together for a thickening, or butter and flour and milk for a sauce. We stir when we rub butter to a cream, or when we make a batter or semi-dough. When we make a stiff dough we stir first and then turn the tt^hole mass over, bringing the knife or spoon round the basin and cutting up through the dough.

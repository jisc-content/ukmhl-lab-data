530 THE COMPLETE COOK Pot-Pourri of Fruits Ingredients— One pint of pale brandy. Mixed fruits. White sugar. Almonds. Method.—Put the brandy into a stone jar which will hold, or nearly hold, one and a half quarts. The jar must have a tight- fitting lid or cork. As the various summer fruits come into season, put them into the brandy with an equal quantity of sugar; thus a breakfastcupful of sugar to each one of fruit. Stir each day with a wooden spoon. Use strawberries, pineapple, raspberries, currants, blackberries, peaches, apricots, cherries, plums, grapes, etc. Plums, peaches, and suchlike varieties must be peeled, stoned, and cut each into eight pieces. Cherries must be stoned, grapes seeded, pineapple cut in dice, strawberries husked. As the seeds of small fruits harden with the brandy, it is better to mash them and use only the strained juice ; this applies to rasp- berries, blackberries, and currants. About a month after the last fruit is added the pot-pourri is ready for use. About an ounce of shelled and shredded sweet almonds adds considerably to the flavour. This makes a delicious variety of fruit salad. Preserved Plums Ingredients— To each pound of plums And half a pint of water. Allow two breakfastcupfuls of loaf sugar, Method.—Stalk the plums and prick each several times with a needle. Put the sugar and water into the pan'; when the sugar dissolves, bring it to boiling point and boil it until it will form a thread when tested between the finger and thumb. Lay the fruit in a pan, pour over the syrup and leave until next day. Then drain off the syrup, reboil, and again pour it over the fruit; repeat this on the third morning. Try the fruit; it should now be quite tender and perfect in shape ; if it is not tender it must be gently boiled until it is. Put a few plums into each bottle. Strain the syrup and reboil it until it forms a thread between the finger and thumb, and fill up the bottles with it. Cork tightly and cover with resin, wax, or bladder.

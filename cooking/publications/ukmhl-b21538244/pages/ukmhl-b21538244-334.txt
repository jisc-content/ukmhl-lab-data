THE COMPLETE COOK 286 by the side of the fire sufficiently long to permit the scum to rise, and by its removal clear the sauce and remove all grease. In white sauces it is also necessary to blend the flour with the butter and let it cook gently in it for a few minutes, but without allowing it to colour in the vety least. By doing this the butter is absorbed by the flour, the starch grains cook more quickly, and the flavour and appearance of the sauce are greatly improved. Undercooking sauces results in a rough, raw taste due to the starch grains of the flour not being thoroughly burst and cooked. This is unpleasant and indigestible. Overcookhig sauces—If this occurs through some error of judgment it often causes the butter to separate from the flour, this making the sauce oily. The Consistency of Sauces Sauces are required chiefly for two purposes;— 1. To coat or mask some article of food, eg. a chaudfroid sauce. 2. To flow smoothly round some preparation or other, e.g. sweet melted butter sauce poured round a pudding, or tomato sauce round cutlets. Should the sauce be too thick or too thin for the purpose it is intended, it must be described as a failure. A coating sauce should be sufficiently thick for it to smoothly cover the back of a wooden spoon when it is dipped in. If it all drips off it is too thin. A flowing sauce must be thin enough to flow smoothly round the pudding or meat, etc. It must not form ridges or lumps as it is poured round, if it does it is faulty. Strain or Tammy sauces in order to render them perfectly smooth, unless they contain some ingredients such as capers, parsley, etc., which it is necessary not to remove. Anchovy Sauce Add about one teaspoonful or more, according to taste, of anchovy essence to half a pint of White or Bechamel sauce.

EGGS AND OMELETS 427 Melt the butter in the pan ; when it has nearly stopped bubbling, pour in the eggs and whisk them with a fork over a quick fire until they are just setting. Draw the mixture all down to the handle side of the pan, tilting it well up, press in the centre with the spoon so as to form a hollow. Put in a little jam, fold the mixture neatly over it and shape it like an oval cushion. Slip the knife under to prevent the under side sticking. Turn it upper side downwards on to a hot dish, dust it with a little castor sugar, and score it three times across with a red-hot skewer, or brown it with a salamander. Swiss Omelet Prepare and cook a mixture as for Savoury Omelet, but in- stead of onion, herbs, and parsley mix into the eggs two table- spoonfuls of lightly fried streaky bacon cut in small dice.

THE COMPLETE COOK 38o Decorate the top of each with any pretty design cut from the white of egg and a few sprigs of chervil. Set these decorations with a few drops of aspic. Place a shelled prawn in each mould, fill up the moulds with melted aspic, and leave them to set. Dip the moulds into tepid water, turn the jelly on to a dish, and arrange some chopped aspic lightly round. Note.—If prawns are very expensive put two shrimps into each mould. Preserved prawns may be used. Various other ingredients can take the place of prawns, i.e. bearded oysters, dice or balls of foie-gras, stuffed olives, fillets of lax (bought in tins), plovers’ eggs, etc. Prawn Ingredients— Small rounds of fried bread. One dozen prawns. Two tablespoonfuls of grated cheese. One tablespoonful of breadcrumbs. Method.—Shell the prawns, put six on one side, and chop the rest. Put the paste into a mortar with the crumbs and cheese and pound them together, adding enough slightly whipped cream to bind them smoothly. Stir in the chopped prawns and season with cayenne or coraline pepper. Put a small heap of the mixture on each croute and place a whole prawn across the top. Arrange on a lace paper. Note.—Mayonnaise sauce may be used instead of cream. Coraline pepper is not so hot as cayenne, is a lovely scarlet, and gives a pretty touch of colour to any dish. Preserved prawns may be used, if liked. Crofites Two teaspoonfuls of prawn or shrimp paste. A little cream. Cayenne or coraline pepper.

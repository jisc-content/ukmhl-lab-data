187 FISH Souffles of Salmon Ingredien ts— One pound of raw salmon. One gill of cream. One gill of white sauce. One white of egg. Two fillets of anchovies. Three-quarters of a pint of cardinal sauce. One tablespoonful of lobster coral and a small tablespoonful of butter. Salt : cayenne. Method.—Wash and dry the fish. Remove the skin and bones. Pound it with the anchovies, after wiping them free from oil. When fine add the sauce, white of egg, and the coral butter, prepared by washing the coral, drying it in the oven, pounding and sieving it with the butter. Pound all these again and season carefully with salt and cayenne pepper. Then rub the mixture through a fine wire sieve. Whip the cream till it will nearly, but not quite hang on the whisk, mix it in very lightly. Thickly butter some small dariole moulds and three parts fill them with the mixture. Place these in the steamer, cover the tops with greased paper, and steam them gently for about thirty to thirty-five minutes. Turn them carefully out, press each lightly with soft paper to remove any grease. Arrange them on a hot dish and pour the hot cardinal sauce over and round them. If liked a little chopped truffle or parsley can be sprinkled on the top of each. Note.—Tinned salmon can be used. If preferred the mixture may be steamed in one large souffle tin. If there is no lobster coral and the mixture is too pale a colour, cautiously add a drop or two of cochineal. Prepare this as for Souffles of Salmon, but use half a pound of raw whiting free from skin and bone and half a pound of lobster meat instead of salmon. Proceed as for Oyster Fritters. But as the scollops are large and somewhat tough, divide each into two or three pieces according to their size, and stew them gently in a little fish stock or milk till they can be easily pierced with a skewer. Then drain them well, lightly drying them in a cloth, and follow the direction given for Oyster Fritters. Souffles of Lobster Scollop Fritters

Boil the milk, add the sugar, lemon rind, and brandy; let it cool slightly, then strain in the beaten egg. Mix all well together and pour it on to the bread. Let it soak for ten minutes. Butter a small mould, put the mixture in it. Twist a piece of greased paper over the top and steam the pudding very gently for one hour. Turn it carefully on to a hot dish and serve with it some plain sweet sauce, or whipped and flavoured cream. Note.—If the bread is very stale, more milk may be needed, as it will soak up so much, also longer soaking will be required. Suet Puddings Ingredients— Four level tablespoonfuls of flour. Four lightly rounded tablespoon- fuls of crumbs. Three rounded tablespoonfuls of chopped beef suet. for Invalids Half a teaspoonful of baking powder. One saltspoonful of salt. A gill of milk. Method.—Sieve together the flour, baking powder, and salt, then mix with them the crumbs and suet, the latter must be chopped very finely. Mix these ingredients to a soft dough with the milk. Well butter a pudding basin, put in the mixture, twist a piece of buttered paper over the top, and steam the pudding gently from three to four hours.

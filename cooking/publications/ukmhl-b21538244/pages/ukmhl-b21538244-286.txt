Tie the slice of slitted bacon over its breast. Roast the pheasant before a quick clear fire for about thirty to forty-five minutes, according to its size. Baste it frequently with butter or good beef dripping. When the cooking is about three parts done, remove the bacon and dredge the bird lightly

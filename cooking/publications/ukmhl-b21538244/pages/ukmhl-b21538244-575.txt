CAKES AND BISCUITS 501 becomes crisp at the edges, and will crack, not roll. The same thing happens if it is too slowly, or over baked. Swiss Roll {Rich) For this use the Genoese Cake Mixture. Bake and roll it as directed for Stviss Roll (Plain). Sultana Cake Foundation Cake Mixture, with the addition of one level breakfastcupful of sultanas and three tablespoonfuls of chopped peel. Walnut Wafers Ingredien ts— Two tablespoonfuls of butter. Four tablespoonfuls of castor sugar. Eight tablespoonfuls of flour. Four tablespoonfuls of milk. Two tablespoonfuls of finely shelled and chopped walnuts. A few drops of lemon juice, or orange flower water. Method.—Cream the butter and sugar until quite soft. Stir in the milk very gradually, almost drop by drop, add the flour lightly, and the flavourings and walnuts. Very slightly grease a shallow baking tin. Spread some of the mixture very thinly on it and mark it into squares. Bake it in a moderate oven for about five minutes. Have ready the handle of a wooden spoon very slightly oiled, roll the wafers quickly round it so as to give them a curled appearance. This rolling should be done really at the oven door, so as to prevent the mixture cooling, as it then becomes too set to roll. Note.—Pine kernels, hazel nuts, or almonds can be used instead of walnuts, varying the name of the wafer. Wedding Cake Ingredients— Ten level breakfastcupfuls of flour. Four breakfastcupfuls packed solidly of butter. Four level breakfastcupfuls of castor sugar. Six level breakfastcupfuls of currants. One piece of citron peel.

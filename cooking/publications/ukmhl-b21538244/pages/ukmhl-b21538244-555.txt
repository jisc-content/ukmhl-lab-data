485 CAKES AND BISCUITS Hot Cross Buns Proceed as for Buns, but add more spice, and less, or no fruit, as desired. Mark a cross on the top of each bun after shaping it, and if liked more solid than the others, do not allow them to rise for so long after shaping and marking them. Cherry Cake Proceed as for Foundation Cake, adding about two to three dozen glacd cherries cut in quarters. Chocolate Cake Ingredien ts— One and three-quarter teacupfuls of flour. Half a pound packet of plain chocolate. One solid breakfastcupful of butter. Four tablespoonfuls slightly rounded of ground rice. {Illustrated) Six level tablespoonfuls of castor sugar. Four eggs. One level teaspoonful of baking powder. Essence of vanilla. Two tablespoonfuls of milk. Chocolate and royal icing. Method.—Line a square or round cake tin with greased paper. Chop the chocolate and dissolve it smoothly in the milk. Beat the butter and sugar to a soft cream. Sieve the flour, ground rice, and baking powder. Beat the eggs one by one into the butter and sugar, then stir in the dissolved chocolate. Add the flour, etc., lightly, flavour it with a few drops of vanilla, and pour the mixture into the tin. Bake the cake carefully in a moderate oven for about an hour. It burns easily. Turn it carefully out of the tin, remove the paper, and let it become cold. Trim the top and sides quite evenly, dust off loose crumbs, and pour the chocolate icing evenly over and let it set. Decorate the top prettily with a little white royal icing. Mote.—If it is inconvenient to make royal icing, merely decorate the top with chopped or shredded pistachio nuts, chopped and browned almonds, or desiccated cocoanut, putting any of these on before the icing is quite set. If liked, cut the un-iced cake up into slices, next into fancy shapes, then ice and decorate them.

CHAPTER XXIV EGGS AND OMELETS Eggs in Cookeryâ€” 1. Give increased nutriment, richness of colour, and flavour to foods. 2. Lighten mixtures by their power of entangling and re- taining air, owing to their glutinous nature. 3. Bind mixtures, giving increased tenacity to dough. 4. Soups and jellies, etc., are clarified with the whites, the albumen of which, when whisked with hot liquids, coagulates into a porous mass, which acts as a filter, entangling in its meshes any solids and impurities in the liquid, which, unless removed, would cloud it. Eggs are most digestible when consumed raw, or at most very lightly cooked. Albumen, of which eggs are mainly composed, becomes tough and leathery with fast, or long cooking, instead of being of a soft jelly-like consistency. If needed for poaching or whisking, eggs are best if they have been laid about thirty-six hours; before then the whites are not thick enough, being almost milky, with a curdlike appearance when cooked, but they are then in perfection for boiling. Those with dark shells are thought to possess larger and richer yolks. To Preserve Eggs for the Winter 1. Choose sound, perfectly new-laid eggs; handle them carefully, as any rough motion may cause the vTite and yolk to become mixed, by rupturing the membrane which separates them, and then the egg soon spoils. 2. Place them pointed end downwards in a large crock in a solution of water-glass, that is, silicate of soda. The tins are procurable with full directions from any stores or chemists. 27

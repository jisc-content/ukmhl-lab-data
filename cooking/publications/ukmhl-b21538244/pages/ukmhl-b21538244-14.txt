VI THE COMPLETE COOK A rule hitherto rarely followed, but strictly adhered to throughout this book, is that raw meat be invariably quickly washed, then dried. All thinking persons who use their eyes and common sense should agree with this essential process, for even if a fraction of nutriment be lost, the gain in cleanliness will be ample recompense. It is a matter on which several eminent members of the medical profession have written strongly. I am greatly indebted to Mrs. Charles Clarke, Lady Super- intendent of the National Training School of Cookery, etc., Buckingham Palace Road, for her courtesy in permitting photographs to be taken of dishes prepared in her School.

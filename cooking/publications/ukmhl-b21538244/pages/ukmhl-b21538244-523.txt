Then arrange the meat on a hot dish, with the potatoes round and the onion in the middle. Season the gravy carefully and pour it over. Note.—If preferred, lamb chops may be used, and less onion, according to taste. Stewed Tripe Ingredients— Half a pound of the best tripe. One clove. A few thin slices of Spanish onion. Salt and pepper. Half a pint of milk. Sippets of toast. Two teaspoonfuls of flour. Method.—Wash the tripe well. Put it in a pan with cold water to cover it, and a little salt. Par-boil it for five minutes, then take it out and carefully scrape off all fat. Cut the tripe into neat square pieces, about one and a half inches long. Put the slices of onion into enough cold water to cover them, and par-boil them for five minutes, then drain off the water and chop them finely. This makes the flavour less strong and renders them more digestible by getting rid of some of the essential oil. Put the tripe, milk, clove, and onion in a stewpan with the addition of a little salt. Cover the pan and let the tripe simmer very gently for two hours, or till it is perfectly tender. This is a most important point. Mix the flour smoothly and thinly with a little cold milk. Take out the clove. Pour in the mixed flour and stir it over the fire till it boils. Season the sauce carefully and arrange the tripe neatly on a hot dish with sippets of toast round. Note.—If allowed, potato straws are an excellent garnish for this dish.

467 INVALID COOKERY To boil the Flour.—Tie six or eight large tablespoonfuls of ordinary flour in a pudding cloth and boil it fast in plenty of water for about four hours. Leave it till cold. It will then be in a hard ball, and must be grated before it is ready for use. This method renders the flour peculiarly easy to digest, and is often ordered by medical men. Gruel higredients— Half a pint of boiling milk. Castor sugar or salt to taste. Two rounded teaspoonfuls of the best fine oatmeal. Method.—Mix the oatmeal smoothly and thinly with a little cold milk. Then pour on the boiling milk, stirring it all the time. Pour it back into the saucepan, and cook it gently for ten minutes, keeping it well stirred. Strain it and add salt or sugar to taste, and serve it very hot; unless it is so, it is practically useless. Note.—If liked, a tablespoonful of brandy or sherry may be added to the gruel after it has been strained; in that case, use sugar, not salt. Or another variety may be obtained by using rum in the place of brandy and by adding a small piece of fresh butter. Prepared patent groats may be used instead of the oat- meal, and water instead of milk. Irish Moss Drink Ingredients— A teacupful of Irish moss. Castor sugar to taste. One pint of cold water. A little lemon juice. A glass of sherry or Marsala. Method.—Wash the moss very thoroughly, then let it soak overnight in cold water. Next day strain out the moss, put it in a clean saucepan with the pint of water, and let it boil gently for an hour. Strain off the liquid, add the lemon juice, sherry, and sugar to taste. Great pains should be taken in the flavour- ing, so as to disguise the somewhat unpleasant characteristic flavour of this seaweed. Lemon Posset Ingredients— Two raw eggs. One pint of water. Two glasses of sherry. The rind and juice of a lemon. Two tablespoonfuls of fine fresh breadcrumbs. Sugar and nutmeg to taste.

CHAPTER XXX 518 ICES How TO Make Ices Utensils needed— A freezing machine, or the old-fashioned but reliable pewter freezing pot. Homely substitute—a large milk-can, with a well- fitting lid. A freezing tub, with tap to draw off water. Homely sub- stitute—a zinc bath. Wooden spatula. Homely substitute—a strong, clean bone paper knife. Moulds must be of pewter. Freezing Mixture— Rough ice and coarse freezing salt, seven pounds of ice to one pound of salt. Chip the ice very small with an ice-pick or strong darning needle. Pack the ice and salt in layers in the freezing tub, packing it solidly together. Fit the pot in while packing so as to leave a space for it. How to Freeze Mixtures Too much sugar makes the mixture slow and hard to freeze ; too little sugar causes the ice to be too hard. Never put any mixture into the freezing pot until it is quite cold, or time and ice are wasted. Very great care is needed to wipe the lid of the freezing pot well round before taking it off, otherwise salt may get into the mixture. When the mixture is in the pot and the pot well closed and in the ice, turn it round and round, slowly at first, then more rapidly. After a few minutes’ rest wipe the lid round, take it off and scrape down any mixture frozen to the sides of the pot, and beat the mixture well until quite smooth. Use the spatula for this. Put on the lid, spin the can again, then scrape down and beat the mixture, and continue this until the whole of it is evenly frozen all through. It may be stiffly

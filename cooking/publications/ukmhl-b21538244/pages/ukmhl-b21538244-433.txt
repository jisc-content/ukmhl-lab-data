CREAMS 369 Method.—Cut the slice of cake into an octagonal shape. Each of its eight sides should be the width of one of the wafers, and the slice about an inch in thickness. Spread the sides of the slice thinly with a little of the icing and stand the cake on the dish with a lace paper underneath, and press the wafers gently upright against the sides on to the icing, which acts like glue and keeps them in position as it hardens. Put the icing into a forcing bag and join up the sides of the eight wafers where they touch the next one. Put a rose of the icing on the top of this sugar line and press on to each two halves of walnuts at regular intervals. Now a complete wafer case is made. Chop four large tablespoonfuls of the walnuts and add them gently to the whipped cream. Add sugar and brandy to taste. Put a large pipe into the bag and fill in the wafer case with this cream, etc., or a spoon can be used. Heap the cream high in the centre. Decorate it with a few halved walnuts and a light sprinkling of chopped pistachio nuts. Tie the wafers round with a pretty white ribbon and serve as cold as possible. Note.—Glace cherries and other fruits can be used instead of walnuts, and the cream flavoured in any way desired. 24

CHAPTER II COOKING STOVES COAL—GAS—OIL Coal Ranges To attempt cooking before understanding the cooking range, its mechanism, cleaning, etc., is as foolish as for an engine driver to be ignorant of the working of his engine. Yet to hundreds of housewives and cooks the kitchen stove is a sealed mystery ; if it is satisfactory all very well and good, if it will not “draw” and is generally inefficient, they blame the maker, builder, etc., and make it the handy excuse for raw or burnt food, lack of boiling water, etc. If this chapter is given a little study, with the help of the accompanying photos, much that has hitherto been puzzling should be solved. There are two kinds of coal stoves in common use. 1. An open range. 2. A closed range. In the first, the fire grate is not covered on the top, most ot the flame and smoke passing directly into the chimney. In the second, the top of the fire is enclosed under iron plates, and the flame, etc., is drawn round the ovens and boiler, by varying draughts, before it is allowed to escape out into the centre flue. Closed ranges are most generally used, but open ranges are still largely met with in country places and in the north. The Advantages of Open Ranges are: 1. They burn slowly, as the draught is less sharp; this lessens the amount of fuel and labour of stoking. 2. They aid in ventilating the kitchen; a matter of vital importance where the kitchen is also the living room of the family.

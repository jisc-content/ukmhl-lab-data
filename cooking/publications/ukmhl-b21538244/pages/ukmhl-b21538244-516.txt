446 THE COMPLETE COOK Oyster Scollops Ingredients— One dozen oysters. One gill of milk. One rounded tablespoonful of Salt and pepper. butter. Breadcrumbs. Two teaspoonfuls of flour. Method.—Well butter some small scollop shells. Melt the butter in a saucepan, stir in the flour smoothly. Add the milk and stir it over the fire till the sauce boils. Add any strained liquor there may be from the oysters and season them carefully. Beard the oysters, note they are free from grit, and cut each in four pieces. Put these in the sauce. Divide the mixture evenly into the shells, sprinkle some breadcrumbs all over the top, and on these place here and there some very small pieces of butter. Bake them in a quick oven until they are nicely browned on the top. Serve in the shells, placing each one on a lace paper on a small plate. Note.—Scollops are excellent done in this way, though hardly as digestible. If there is any suitable sauce left over in the larder use that instead of making it fresh. Stewed Oysters Ingredients— One dozen oysters. Half a gill of cream. One level tablespoonful of flour. A little lemon juice. One rounded tablespoonful of Salt and pepper. butter. A dust of nutmeg. Half a gill of milk. Method.—Put the oysters with their liquor in a stewpan; if there is not enough liquor to cover them add a little water. Heat them till they plump up and the beards begin to curl slightly, then take out the oysters, beard them and cut each in half. Melt the butter in a stewpan, stir in the flour smoothly, add the strained liquor in which the oysters were cooked and the milk. Stir these over the fire until the mixture boils; let it cool gently for three or four minutes, then season it carefully and add lemon juice. When this sauce is well off the boil, add the oysters and the cream ; make them very hot, without letting them boil, as if they do, the oysters will be tough and indigest- ible. Serve on small plates with sippets of toast and cut lemon round.

PREFACE IN compiling this book, modelled as it is on the lines of that excellent work, The Boston Cookery Book by Mrs. M. J. Lincoln, several special objects have been kept in view. I. To give thorough grounding in the principles of each cooking process, so that the operator’s work may be rendered intelligent, not merely mechanical. 2. To so apply certain recipes that, by the suggested variations of ingredients and utensils, the title of the book may be fairly earned, yet without unduly increasing its size. 3. To give such clear directions that a reasonable success may be assured. This work is not intended for those who are already masters of the culinary art, nor yet primarily for the wealthier house- holds, but rather for the average housewife whose income permits of no thoughtless expenditure. In the following recipes measures are almost invariably directed to be used, in lieu of weights. Doubtless this will give rise to some unfavourable comments, but such a course was not decided upon without careful consideration. The reasons for its adoption were mainly because— I. Under certain circumstances weights and scales are impracticable, i.e. when yachting, camping out, etc. 2. The majority of cooks appear to have a racial antipathy to them, even if close at hand, yet their scruples do not extend to a cup and spoon.

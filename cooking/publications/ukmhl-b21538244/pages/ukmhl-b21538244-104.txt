THE COMPLETE COOK 72 9. Worrying the patient as to what he or she would fancy to eat. Milk Pudding 1. Wrong proportions of the farinaceous preparation to the milk. 2. Careless sweetening. 3. Too rapid cooking. Pastry 1. Insufficient shortening allowed. 2. Damp flour used. 3. Rubbing the shortening in too heavily and too much. 4. Making the pastry in a hot place. 5. Much handling with hot hands and over-kneading. 6. Water not perfectly cold and pastry made too wet. 7. Too little water used, so pastry dry and crumbly. 8 Uneven and heavy use of the rolling pin. 9. Not baking the pastry quickly enough after moistening it when baking powder is used. 10. Oven too hot, so pastry burns, or too cold, so that it becomes dry and chippy. Roasting 1. Fire dull or smoky. 2. Surface of the meat not hardened rapidly enough, so the nutritious juices are lost. 3. Too fierce a heat kept up for too long, especially for large joints, so the exterior is charred before the inside is cooked. 4. Small joints and birds dried by being cooked too slowly. 5. Insufficient basting. 6. Meat over or under cooked owing to lack of experience or carelessness in apportioning the time. 7. The gravy too pale, weak, greasy, or badly seasoned. 8. Meat rendered sodden by pouring the gravy over, instead of round the joint. Re-heating Cooked Meat 1. Using water for gravies instead of stock made from the bones, rough pieces, etc. 2. Hardening the meat by placing it in boiling gravies, or extracting its remaining juices and flavour by putting it in cold gravies.

496 THE COMPLETE COOK Orange Filling Proceed as for Lemon Filling, using the rind and juice of one orange, instead of lemon; but one teaspoonful of lemon juice will be found an improvement. Pineapple Filling Ingredients— One teacupful of cream. Four tablespoonfuls of castor One teacupful of grated pine- sugar. apple. One teacupful of crushed and sieved ratafias, or macaroons. Method.—Whip the cream until it will nearly, but not quite, hang on to the whisk. Mix in very gently the ratafia crumbs, pineapple, and sugar, and use at once. This cream filling will not keep, so use confectioners’ custard if not for immediate use. Macaroons Ingredients— Three level teacupfuls of ground almonds. Two level breakfastcupfuls of castor sugar. One slightly rounded tablespoon- ful of rice flour. About six whites of eggs. Method.—Mix the almonds, sugar, and rice flour in a basin. Add the whites of eggs, and work the mixture with a wooden spoon for about ten minutes, or until it becomes quite white. It must be a soft mixture, but not so much so that it loses its shape when moulded. Add the essences, and put the mixture into a forcing bag with a large plain pipe. Lay the wafer paper on a baking sheet, force out the macaroons to about the size of half a crown, put a few thinly shredded almonds on the top of each, and bake them in a moderately hot oven for about twenty-five minutes. Lift them off the tin when cold, and break off the uneven edge of the wafer paper. Note.—If there is not a bag and pipe, shape the mixture the size of walnuts, place well apart, and flatten them down slightly. Nouille Biscuits Ingredients— Three and a half teacupfuls of flour. Two raw yolks of eggs. Half a teaspoonful of vanilla essence. Half a teaspoonful of ratafia essence. Six shelled almonds. Sheets of wafer paper. Half a level teaspoonful of salt. Cold water if needed.

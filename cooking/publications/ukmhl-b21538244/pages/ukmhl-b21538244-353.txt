CHAPTER XV PUDDINGS AND PASTRY Apple Amber Pudding {Illustrated) Ingredients— Six large sharp apples. Three tablespoonfuls of castor sugar. Three eggs. One lemon. Two rounded tablespoonfuls of butter. Method.—Peel, core, and quarter the apples. Put the butter in a stewpan, warm it, then add the apples, sugar, and grated lemon rind, and let them stew slowly till they are in a soft thick pulp. Rub this through a hair or fine wire sieve. Beat in the yolks of the eggs and add the cinnamon. Damp the , edge of the pie dish, roll out the pastry thinly, cut off a strip and press it on the edge and inside the dish so as to line it. Cut out the rest of the pastry into small fancy rounds about the size of a sixpence. Brush the edge of the pastry with a little white of egg or water. Arrange the fancy rings of pastry round on it, overlapping each other. Put the apple mixture into the dish and bake it in a quick oven till the pastry is cooked and the centre mixture set, probably it will take about twenty-five minutes. Have the whites of eggs beaten to a very stiff froth and mixed with three level teaspoonfuls of extra castor sugar and a drop or two of vanilla. Heap this meringue roughly all over the apple mixture. Dust the surface well with castor sugar and here and there place a glace cherry. Replace the pudding in the slowest part of the oven till the meringue feels crisp and is delicately tinged with brown, then serve at once. Note.—The edging of pastry can be left out, but the effect is less good. The addition of cinnamon is a matter of taste. Angelica or other fruits can be used as decoration. 303 Three ounces of any good pastry. About ten glace cherries. Half a level teaspoonful of powdered cinnamon. Vanilla.

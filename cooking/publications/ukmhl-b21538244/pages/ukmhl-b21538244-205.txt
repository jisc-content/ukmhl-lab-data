173 FISH serve them in the shells on a fish-napkin or lace paper. A slice of cut lemon may be laid on each. Note.—All sorts of fish are suitable for this; oysters, shrimps, prawns, and lobsters are excellent. If there is any suitable sauce left over, use it instead of making fresh. Baked Fish Souffle Ingredients— One breakfastcupful of any cooked chopped fish. One teacupful of cooked potato. Two raw eggs. Two rounded tablespoonfuls of butter. Two tablespoonfuls of milk or cream. Two teaspoonfuls of chopped parsley. Salt: pepper. Method—Butter a deep au gratin, souffle, or pie dish. Melt the butter, add the mashed potatoes, and beat them together till hot and light. Add the prepared fish, parsley, milk, yolks of eggs, seasoning, and lastly lightly mix in the whites of eggs beaten to a very stiff froth. Turn the mixture into the dish and bake it in a quick oven till well browned and puffed up. Serve it at once in the dish in which it was cooked. Dried Haddock, Grilled Ingredients— One dried Finnan haddock. Pepper. One level tablespoonful of butter. Method.—Trim off the ends of the fins and tail. Well wash the fish in warm water and dry it. Heat and grease the gridiron. Brush the fish over with the butter, warmed until it is slightly oiled. Fasten it in the gridiron and turn the yellow side to the clear brisk fire. Grill it quickly till lightly tinged with brown and well puffed out. It will take about ten to fifteen minutes, according to its thickness. Turn it once and grill the other side. Then lay it on a hot dish, rub it over with a little butter, add a dust of pepper, and serve immediately. Dried Haddock, Baked Proceed as for Grilled Haddock, but lay it on a greased baking tin in a quick oven and bake it till cooked. It may, if necessary, be held in front of the fire for a minute, just to colour it a little.

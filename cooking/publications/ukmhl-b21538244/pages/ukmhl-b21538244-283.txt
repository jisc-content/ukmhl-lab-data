CHAPTER XII GAME HOW TO ROAST DIFFERENT VARIETIES OF GAME A Few General Hints Endeavour not to break the skin of the birds when plucking them. Game should never be washed inside or out, merely wiped with a clean cloth slightly damped. The birds should be kept in shape by using string when trussing them, not skewers, if they can be avoided. Birds that are badly shot cannot be hung for any length of time, as they soon become uneatable. Waterfowl of all descriptions are best cooked and eaten when freshly killed. Woodcock also deteriorate if kept for long. Prevent the breasts of game becoming dry during the process of roasting, by tying a slice of fat bacon over them. Cut a few slits in the bacon to prevent it curling up. As game lacks fat in itself, it needs special attention as regards the basting, or it becomes dry and shrivelled. The sauce and gravy for roast game are served separately, never poured into the dish. Carefully fried potatoes in any form should be served with all varieties of roast game. How Long to Roast Various Kinds of Game As a rule game is preferred by the majority slightly under, not over cooked ; the exact opposite to poultry. Exceptions to this rule are, however, made for pheasant and partridge. Blackcock require about 45 to 60 minutes Capercailzie „ „ 45 „ 60 „ t6

STOCKS I2I order to utilise them as food. Thus pot-liquor is much weaker than stock, but still valuable for family broths and sauces. The Management of the Stockpot Place the stockpot or large clean saucepan on the stove; fill it a quarter or half full of cold water, according to the probable supply of scraps to hand, and add a teaspoonful of salt. Collect the pieces of bone, meat, vegetables, etc., to be used, add them and let the pot simmer gently for about five or six hours, adding suitable scraps from each meal. Empty the Stockpot every night, straining the contents off into a clean basin. Thoroughly wash and air the stockpot, put it on the fire next day with the strained stock and fresh scraps, or those from the day before if it is thought all nourishment has not boiled out of them. Skim the stock free from fat before I'eturning it to the pot, saving the fat to clarify later. Add more water if the liquid has reduced too much. This liquid is then always at hand to draw off or ladle out, to use instead of water or expensive meat extracts, for preparing soups and sauces. Prepare Fresh Stock once a week, or even more frequently in warm weather. Do not waste any stock that may be left over if it is still fresh, but use it for Glaze Put the strained stock into a saucepan, leave it uncovered and boil it quickly till only about a third of the stock is left, but the amount will depend on the quality of the stock. Keep it well skimmed during boiling. When sufficiently reduced, the remaining liquid will be a dark brown colour and about the same thickness as hot glue would be. Cool it a little, pour it into a clean jar, and when cold it will be like hard, dark brown glue. To Keep Glaze It will keep for several weeks in a dry place, or if required to do so, for a much longer period ; pour on to it when cold a little warmed lard dripping, or butter.

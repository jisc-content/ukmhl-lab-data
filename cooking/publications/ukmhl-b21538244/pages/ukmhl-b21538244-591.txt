MetJwd.—Divide the sugar equally into three basins. Grate the orange rind into one and the lemon rind into another. Add a tiny pinch of tartaric acid to each basin. Strain enough orange and lemon juice into the respective basins to make the sugar into a stiff yet pliable paste. To the contents of the third basin add raspberry essence and water with a few drops of cochineal until the desired consistency is obtained. Dip the tip of a skewer into the yellow colouring, next into the orange mixture, then knead well until the whole lump is a uniform pretty yellow tint. Shape it into balls ; make them into oval shapes, and put a tiny strip of candied orange peel on each. Shape the lemon and rasp- berry creams in the same way. On the lemon put a tiny strip of candied lemon peel, and on the raspberry a shred of pistachio nut. Allow to dry for a short time in a warm place.

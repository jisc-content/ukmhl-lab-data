36o THE COMPLETE COOK to refilter. What runs through before the filter, composed of whipped whites and crushed shells, is in the cloth, is always cloudy. Should the jelly still appear cloudy, refilter what is in the second basin, but rinse the basin each time. Be most careful not to touch or stir the sediment in the cloth; give the jelly plenty of time to run through, and keep it in as warm a place as possible, and covered over so as to prevent the jelly cooling and setting. Should it begin to set in the cloth, very gently place a tin mug or round mould half full of boiling water in the cloth. When all the jelly is clarified it can be used as desired. Note.â€”All clear jellies are clarified in exactly the same manner.! A speck or two of flour, dirty eggshells, lemons, spoons, etc., or a greasy cloth, or one that has been washed with soap, will effectually prevent a jelly from being clear and sparkling. In very cold weather use about two or three sheets less gelatine; if very hot, about four extra, or if the jelly has to be packed for travelling, or is to be set with a large amount of fruit, etc. If wished, the jelly can be tinted to any desired tone of red with cochineal after straining.

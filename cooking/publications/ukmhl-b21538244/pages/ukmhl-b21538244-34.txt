lO THE COMPLETE COOK round paste brush, costing about tenpence, is for many things far preferable to a dish-cloth. The bristles penetrate into all crevices, the brush is very easily kept clean, the right hand need never be put into the water, and if a good brush is bought and it is soaked overnight in cold water before it is used, the bristles will never come out, and will last till they are worn to a stump.

If possible it should be placed at least six feet from the house, and be small in comparison to the house, so that it will require to be frequently emptied. It must be made of galvanised zinc, or some non-absorbent material; all wooden boxes and baskets are to be condemned, also fixed brick dust-bins. It should be removable, so that it can be carried out and thoroughly emptied, and a lid is essential, otherwise the contents become moistened with rain, and moisture fosters decay. No vegetable parings, bones, tea leaves, etc., should find their way into the dust-bin, all these must be burnt, after drying them as much as possible. Common sense should dictate that

io8 THE COMPLETE COOK one another, or sauces or garnishes of a similar colour or character. Aim at variety in every detail. lo. Write out a detailed menu for both cook and parlour- maid, so that there is no excuse for incompleteness in any item. It is vexatious to all parties to have to wait for, or do without, some necessary accompaniment to a dish, such as mint sauce for the lamb, red currant jelly with venison, castor sugar or cream with the fruit tart, etc,; but it is inconsiderate and sense- less to expect a flurried, busy cook to recollect everything herself. For the successful execution of a menu, have all the required apparatus and every possible ingredient in the house two or three days beforehand. Perishable goods such as salads, vegetables, fish, cream, and so on, must of course be sent in on the day itself This plan prevents ingredients being forgotten or disappointments at the last moment. Also exercise forethought, and insist that all preparations practicable shall be put in hand two or three days in advance, in order to reduce the work on the day of the dinner to a minimum. THE USUAL ACCOMPANIMENTS TO SERVE WITH VARIOUS STANDARD DISHES Time-honoured rules and customs and scientific knowledge have made it almost compulsory that with these dishes at least some of the following adjuncts are served :— Hors d’CEuvre Oysters.—Quarters of lemon, or white vinegar: thin brown bread and butter : cayenne.

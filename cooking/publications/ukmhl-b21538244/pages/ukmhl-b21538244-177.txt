VEGETABLE PURGES AND THICKENED SOUPS 145 Mix the cornflour smoothly and thinly with a little cold water. Pour it into the boiling soup and stir it till it boils well and thickens. Let it continue to boil for about five minutes, then see it is correctly seasoned and serve it in a hot tureen with toast cut in dice or croutons. It should be as thick as good cream; if the tomatoes are very juicy more cornflour may be added. Note.—Cooked ham or bacon will do, or even a ham bone can be cooked in it to give the desired flavour. The same amount of semolina, small sago, or crushed tapioca can be used to thicken this soup instead of cornflour, but this must be sprinkled in dry, then stirred till it is cooked.

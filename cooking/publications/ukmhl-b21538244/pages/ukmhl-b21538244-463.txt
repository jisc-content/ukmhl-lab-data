SALADS 397 Egg Ingredients— F'om- hard-boiled eggs. One lettuce. Three tablespoonfuls of cream. Three tablespoonfuls of Mayon- naise sauce. Salad One tablespoonful of chopped parsley. One tablespoonful of chopped celery. One teacupful of cooked macaroni. Salt and pepper. Method.—Shell the eggs, slice three of them thickly. Separate the yolk and white of the remaining one, rub the yolk through a wire sieve or strainer, and chop the white finely. Wash and prepare the lettuce and pull it into small pieces. Cut the macaroni into one-inch lengths. Whip the cream until it will just hang on the whisk, mix the Mayonnaise sauce lightly into it, and see that it is nicely seasoned. Put a layer of lettuce into the salad bowl, then one of egg, next macaroni, celery, parsley, and dressing, and so on until all ingredients are used. The last layer should be of lettuce. Decorate the top prettily with the yolk and white of the egg. Note.—If preferred, the cream may be omitted. Fish Salad The ingredients and preparation are the same as for Salmon Mayonnaise. A couple of hard-boiled eggs will be an im- provement, and if intended for a homely meal, a plainer dressing might be used and beetroot substituted for the more elaborate garnish. French Ingredients— Two lettuces. Four tablespoonfuls of salad oil. Two tablespoonfuls of tarragon or French wine vinegar. One teaspoonful of French mustard. Salad Two teaspoonfuls of chopped chives or spring onions. One teaspoonful each of tarragon and chervil. Salt: pepper ; castor sugar. Method.—Wash and prepare the lettuces. Put the mustard, salt, and a good dust of pepper and sugar in a basin. Mix the vinegar smoothly into them and then the oil. Arrange the lettuce, chives, and herbs tastefully in a salad bowl. Sprinkle over the dressing, taking care that every leaf is seasoned. Serve at once. Note.—Chives or onions may be left out, if wished.

Welsh Rarebit Ingredients— About a breakfastcupful of Cheddar or any rich cheese, cut in small thin pieces. One rounded tablespoonful of butter. Two tablespoonfuls of ale, cream, or milk. One level teaspoonful of made mustard. Salt; cayenne. Hot buttered toast. Method.—Put the butter into the stewpan, or chafing dish, add the ale or milk, and when it is hot put in the cheese, seasoning, and mustard. Stir continuously over a slow fire until the mixture has become thick, smooth, and creamy. Have the toast hot, crisp, neatly trimmed, and ready on a hot dish. At once pour the cheese over the toast, sprinkle a dust of red Hungarian pepper, or a few grains of cayenne, if liked, over each, and serve at once, or it becomes tough. Note.—The quality of the cheese makes all the difference to this dish; it should be mild, soft, and rich, or it is a failure.

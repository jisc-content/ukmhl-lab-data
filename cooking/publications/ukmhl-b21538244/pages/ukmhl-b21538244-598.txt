THE COMPLETE COOK 524 Have all utensils in order and to hand, to avoid delay. Use wide-mouthed jars—those with glass inner covers and screw metal tops are best—and keep them in hot water until needed for filling. A clamp is convenient, with which to hold the jar over the pan while filling it. Use a broad, shallow pan—an oval boiler answers well—put rings of stones in it, on which to stand the jars. Put the fruit into the jars. Stand them in the boiler, pack them round with hay, and pour in the boiling hot syrup. A cold spoon can be put into the jars to lessen the risk of cracking them. Generally one cup of sugar to one cup of water is used for the syrup for small juicy berries, and one cup of sugar to two cups of water for large fruit such as pears, plums, etc. For fruits which need cooking, boil the jars and their contents in the boiler for five minutes, or until the fruit is just soft, but not broken. Fasten the tops securely, giving them an extra screw down about every half-hour until the fruit is cold. It is best to keep the jars bottom upwards. Thick tinfoil can be used for jars of which the covers are lost. Proceed as directed for Crab Apple Jelly, using the ordinary sharp cooking apples. A few drops of cochineal will be needed to tint it prettily. Method.—Peel, quarter, and core the apples. Put them into the preserving pan with the sugar and about a teacupful of boiling water. Stew them until the fruit is tender, if necessary adding a little more water. Stalk and examine the blackberries carefully, add them to the apples, and boil steadily until the jam sets, when allowed to get cold. Remove all scum as it rises, and stir it constantly. Pour the jam into dry heated jars and cover securely. Note.—Blackberries may be used alone, but apple is a great improvement. Apple Jelly Blackberry and Apple Jam Ingredients— Four pounds of blackberries. Six sharp apples. Nine breakfastcupfuls of loaf sugar.

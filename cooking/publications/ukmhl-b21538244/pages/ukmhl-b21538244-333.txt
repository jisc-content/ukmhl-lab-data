CHAPTER XIV SAUCES Many so-called good cooks fail when called upon to prepare various sauces. It is considered to be one of the highest branches of cookery, as it calls for so much discretion in selecting wisely, and skill in blending, flavours and ingredients, so as to carry out the characteristic features of the sauce and yet suit the tastes of the diners. The flavour of sauces must never be allowed to predominate over that of the meat, game, etc., which they are to accompany. Many inexperienced cooks think to hide defects, or to improve sauces by a liberal use of bottled sauces, wine, etc. ; this is a mistake, and rarely succeeds in its object. It is absolutely necessary for cooks to taste the various foods they prepare, and never more so than when concocting a sauce, for it is impossible to lay down hard-and-fast rules for seasoning and flavourings. Foundation Sauces With a few exceptions the actual foundation sauces, from which an almost unlimited supply of varieties is prepared, are only two in number: Espagnole, a rich brown sauce. BMiamel, a rich white sauce. Plain household sauces have for their foundation a less rich brown sauce and white sauce. Master these foundation sauces completely and a little experience will soon teach variations. Much of the success of brown sauces depends on the correct frying of the flour in the butter. This is done not only to colour the flour and thereby the sauce, but to develop a rich nutty flavour, obtainable by no other means. It is imperative also that the sauces are gently simmered 28s

386 CHAPTER XX CHEESE COOKERY Cheese Aigrettes Ingredients— Four rounded tablespoonfuls of Vienna flour. Six rounded tablespoonfuls of grated Parmesan cheese. One rounded tablespoonful of butter. Two whole eggs and one extra yolk. A breakfastcupful of hot water. Salt: cayenne. Frying fat. Method.—Spread the flour on a tin and dry it very slowly in the oven ; it must not colour at all. Then pass it through a wire sieve and measure it. Put the water and butter into a saucepan ; when it boils, add the flour all together, take the pan off the fire and stir and beat the mixture until it is smooth. Cook it over a gentle heat, stirring it all the time until the “panada’’will leave the sides of the pan without sticking to them. If over- cooked, or cooked too quickly, the butter will separate, and a fresh quantity of “ panada ” must be made. Add the cheese and let the mixture cool slightly. Beat in the eggs thoroughly one at a time. Season carefully and turn the mixture on to a plate. When the first signs of a faint smoke rise from the fat, put in small teaspoonfuls of the mixture and fry the aigrettes a light brown. At first they sink, then float, and must be very slowly fried for about ten or twelve minutes. If the fat is too hot they become heavy and too dark a brown. When fried, drain them on soft paper and sprinkle with a little of the grated cheese and serve at once, heaped up on a hot dish. Note.—These will keep well in a tin for a week if put into it cold, and re-heat quite well a second time in a moderate oven.

Warm the jelly until melted, stir it into the cream. Colour and flavour it as desired, stir gently until it is just beginning to set, then pour it over the cakes. Should it set too quickly, slightly rewarm it over warm water. Note.—If there is not any jelly, use instead four sheets of leaf gelatine melted in a gill of sherry, water, and lemon juice mixed. More sugar will be needed to sweeten it. If the sweet jelly is not very stiff, or the weather is very warm, dissolve in the jelly one or two extra sheets of gelatine.

Method.—Sieve the sugar through a hair sieve. Beat the whites until slightly frothy. Make a well in the middle of the sugar, pour in the whites of eggs and mix them gradually into the sugar with a wooden spoon. Add the strained lemon juice slowly. It must be so stiff that any pattern made with it does not blur but remains clear and sharp. If too thin, work in a little extra sieved icing sugar; if too stiff, a little more white of egg or lemon juice. Beat the icing very thoroughly to whiten it, and it is ready to use. Note.—If it is not used at once, lay a piece of wet muslin or paper right down on it to prevent the surface becoming hard.

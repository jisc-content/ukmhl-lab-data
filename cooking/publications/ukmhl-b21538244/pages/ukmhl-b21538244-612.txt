THE COMPLETE COOK 538 one tablespoonful of the best French kind, to eight tablespoon- fuls of ground coffee. Coffee pots of fireproof ware are usually most popular; they must be kept scrupulously clean, cleaning the spout as well as the pot. The cause of ill-flavoured coffee is frequently an unclean pot. To Roast Coffee Put about two tablespoonfuls of coffee berries into a saute pan, with a tiny piece of butter. Shake these over a slow fire until they are a good dark brown. The butter lubricates the berries, prevents the escape of much of the fragrance, and is quite absorbed before the roasting is done. If accidentally any berries become burnt, throw them away, otherwise they will spoil the flavour of all. Grind the berries as soon as they are roasted, and keep the powder in tins with tight-fitting lids. To Make the Coffee Ingredients— Allow one heaped tablespoonful of proportion slightly when several coffee to each breakfastcupful cups are required, of boiling water, reducing the Method.—Scald the pot, and place it in a saucepan containing boiling water. If it is a perculator, put the coffee powder into the upper part, and pour on the boiling water, a little at a time until the necessary quantity has been added. When all has run through, the coffee is ready. Or place the powder in a heated jug, or pot, pour on the boiling water, and let it stand for five minutes at the side of the stove; then pour three or four cupfuls backwards and forwards, and let it stand for five minutes to settle. Strain it into a hot coffee pot, and it is ready. Serve it in hot cups, with hot milk. To Serve Coffee Cream, scalded milk, and loaf sugar are essential accompani- ments to coffee. Put about one teaspoonful of cream and two of milk into each cup—these amounts must vary with the size of the cup—then fill up with coffee. Let each person add sugar according to taste. The milk should be slowly heated, but not boiled, as this spoils the flavour.

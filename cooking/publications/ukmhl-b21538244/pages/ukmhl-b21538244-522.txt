452 THE COMPLETE COOK Raw Beef Sandwiches Ingredients— Two ounces of fresh lean steak. Salt, pepper, or castor sugar. Thin slices of brown or white bread and butter. Method.—Wash quickly, wipe, and shred the meat very finely. Pound it and rub it through a coarse sieve. Season the meat well, using either salt and pepper or, what is strongly recom- mended by many to disguise its flavour, castor sugar. Spread a slice of bread and butter with some of this mixture, cover it with another slice and cut into fancy shapes. If a little finely chopped parsley is permitted, it will be found a great improvement. Note.—These sandwiches are very digestible and nourishing. Gravy Toasts Ingredients— Slices of thin crisp toast. Salt and pepper. About half a gill of strong gravy from beef, or mutton obtained during the cooking. Method.—Cut the toast into dice or rounds the size of a penny. The joint that is cooking must be well pricked with a fork so that the gravy may flow out easily; do this while the meat is still underdone. Some gravy can be obtained from the dripping tin, taking care that it is quite free from grease. Heat the gravy without boiling. Lay the toast in a hot soup plate or cup. Season it, then pour over the gravy, and serve. Note.—If preferred, plain bread or rusks may be used in the place of toast. Invalid’s Irish Stew Ingredients— Three mutton neck chops. One gill of cold water. Two medium-sized potatoes. Salt and pepper. Half a small Spanish onion. Method.—Wash and dry the meat quickly, trim off all but a thin rim of fat from each chop. Peel and slice the onion, put it into cold water, bring it to boiling point and par-boil it for five minutes. Then drain off and throw away the water. Peel the potatoes and cut them into large dice. Grill the chops quickly for a minute or so on each side, then lay them in the pan,

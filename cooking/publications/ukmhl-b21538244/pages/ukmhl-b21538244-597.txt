CHAPTER XXXI JAMS AND PICKLES Useful Hints on Jam Making 1. Use fresh, dry, sound, not over or under ripe fruit. 2. Good cane sugar is the most economical. 3. Use bright, clean, thick metal pans, either copper or enamel-lined iron. 4. Stir with wooden or silver-plated spoons, never with iron or tin. 5. It is generally safe to allow a pound of sugar to a pound of fruit unless otherwise directed. 6. The quantity of water depends on the juiciness of the fruit and the season. 7. Boil jams quickly, stir and skim well. 8. Boil them until the preserve sets in a jelly when some is cooled on a plate. 9. Empty the jam from the pan directly it is cooked into clean, dry, heated jars. 10. Tie the jars down at once, and store in a cool, dry place. Bottling Fruit Bottling fruit is to preserve it, either with or without sugar, by sealing it in air-tight jars and not cooking it sufficiently to destroy its natural flavour. Some authorities state that filling the jars with cold water and sealing immediately will keep fruit, but most kinds are improved by the addition of more or less sugar. Iviportant Points in Bottling Have the fruit perfect in shape and quality. The syrup, of water and sugar, boiled to “ the thread,” clear and boiling hot. Have the jars clean, hot, filled to overflowing, and sealed quickly and thoroughly. 5=3

THE COMPLETE COOK 204 just below boiling point. Do not let the water evaporate entirely, but add only enough to just keep the meat from burning. Cook very slowly, the time will depend on the quality of the meat; probably it will take about two to three hours. It must be very tender but not ragged. This is excellent hot, or cold ; if the former, serve with it any good brown sauce. Potted Raw Beef, Chicken, etc. Ingredients— One pound of topside of beef. Three tablespoonfuls of butter Three allspice. Three cloves. MetJiod.—Wash the meat, dry it, and cut it into very small pieces. Put half the butter into an earthenware stewing jar, let it melt, then put in the beef, bay leaf, and the spice tied up in muslin. Cover the jar tightly with greased paper and let it bake in a very slow oven for about two hours. Lift out the spice and bay leaf and pound the beef and butter in a mortar, then rub the paste through a hair sieve. Should it seem in the least dry, add some more oiled butter until it is a stiff smooth paste. Season it rather highly and press it firmly down into small jars. Smooth the surface of each until perfectly level. Then clarify any butter left, or take more if required, and when the meat is quite cold, pour the warm clarified butter over the top till the meat is covered. Let this set. In cold weather this will last ten days or more. Note.—Raw veal and ham can be used, or rabbit or chicken. If ham is used less butter is required. Steak and Kidney Pudding higredients— One and a half pounds of steak. Salt and pepper. Half a pound of ox kidney. Two tablespoonfuls of flour. Three-quarters of a pound of suet pastry.

Dip each piece of steak and kidney into this mixture, put a piece of kidney on a slice of steak and roll them up neatly. Three peppercorns. One bay leaf. Salt and pepper.

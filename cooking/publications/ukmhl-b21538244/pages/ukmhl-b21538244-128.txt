96 THE COMPLETE COOK Grease Moulds and Basins See they are perfectly dry, then brush them over every- where evenly with warmed clarified dripping or butter. These should not be so hot that they trickle down into the top of the mould, but should cling to the sides, giving them a creamy appearance. Blanch Almonds and other Nuts Place them into boiling water; boil them just sufficiently long to soften the skins, then rub these off with the fingers. Use a Salamander Make the iron plate which is attached to the long handle red hot; hold it over the top of the food that requires browning, being careful not to hold it too close, or it will scorch. An inexpensive substitute for a salamander is an iron shovel heated and used in the same way. Chop Parsley Wash the parsley well; remove all the stalks; gather it up in the fingers in a bunch and cut it through several times. Then chop it to a fine powder; fold this in a cloth, rinse it well in cold water, then squeeze it very dry and turn it on to a plate. Blanch Meat and Vegetables This is done to extract some undesirable flavour or sub- stance, or to partially soften. Place them in cold water, bring them quickly to boiling point, boil about half a minute, then drain off the water and use as directed. If it is necessary to blanch parsley, tarragon, or chervil it is best to only dip them several times into boiling water. Whip Cream Cool the cream well, stand in a cool place and pour the cream into a cool basin. Should the cream be so thick that it appears ropy add a little milk. Use the ordinary whisk of hooped wire or a fork. Whisk the cream gently till it is lightly frothed ; if it is to be flavoured, add now the required castor sugar and flavouring essence. Continue to whisk gently till the cream will just hang on the whisk. One turn too much at this

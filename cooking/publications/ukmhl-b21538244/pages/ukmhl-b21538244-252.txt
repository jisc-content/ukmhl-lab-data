214 THE COMPLETE COOK oven and let it cook very slowly for two and a half hours. Add the wine and jelly and see the gravy is nicely seasoned. Wipe round the top of the casserole with a cloth dipped in hot water. Pin a folded dinner napkin round and serve it at once. Note.—Mutton may be used instead of lamb. Shoulder of Mutton, Stuffed Ingredients— A shoulder of mutton. One and a half breakfastcupfuls of fresh crumbs. One teacupful of chopped suet. Two table§poonfuls of chopped ham. One tablespoonful of chopped parsley. Two teaspoonfuls of powdered herbs. One egg. Seasoning. Method.—Wash and well dry the joint. Lay it with the curved side turned downwards, and with a sharp knife cut back the flesh from the shoulder bones. Cut it off as cleanly as possible till every piece of bone is removed. Spread the boned meat flat out on the board and dust it with a little salt and pepper. To make the Stuffing: Mix the crumbs, suet, parsley, ham, and herbs with seasoning and the beaten egg. If the latter does not seem sufficient to bind it, add a spoonful or two of milk. Spread this mixture over the cut side of the meat, leaving a margin of about an inch round bare. Roll the joint up from side to side neatly; tie it in shape with tape or string and roast it. (See directions for Roast Meat.) Serve with thick gravy, baked or grilled tomatoes and red currant jelly. Note.—Lamb may also be cooked in this fashion. Leave out the ham in the stuffing if liked. Leg of Mutton, Stuffed and Roasted Ingredients— The same as for Stuffed Shoulder of Mutton. Method.—Proceed as for Stuffed Shoulder of Mutton, but remove the bone without cutting the leg open. Work the flesh back gradually from each end and fill the cavity thus made with the stuffing. Tie a piece of greased paper over each end of the leg to keep the mixture in and roast it. (See directions for Roast Meat.)

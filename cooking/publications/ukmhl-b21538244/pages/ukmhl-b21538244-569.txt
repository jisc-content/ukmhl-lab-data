497 CAKES AND BISCUITS Method.—Sieve the flour and salt. Beat the yolks, put them in the centre of the flour. Work in as much of the flour as the yolks will take up, then add enough water to make a very stiff dough. Knead this for about ten minutes, until it feels as smooth as velvet. Roll it out as thin as a sheet of notepaper. Stamp it out in rounds the size of the top of a breakfastcup. Prick each biscuit several times, lay them on a floured baking tin, and bake them in a quick oven for about eight to ten minutes, or until crisp and a light yellowish brown. Pack in tins when cold. Pineapple Cake Foundation Cake Mixture. Add to it four heaped table- spoonfuls of preserved pineapple cut into dice; four tablespoonfuls of the pineapple syrup; leave out the milk and lemon rind. Note.—Glace pineapple can be used, but in that case the milk will be required. Queen Ingredients— Four rounded teaspoonfuls of butter. Five rounded tablespoonfuls of flour. Four rounded tablespoonfuls of castor sugar. Cakes About two dozen glace cherries. Two lemon rinds. Three eggs. Half a level teaspoonful of baking powder. Method.—Well butter some small queen cake tins. Sieve the flour and baking powder through a wire sieve. Quarter the cherries. Grate the lemon rinds on to the sugar. Beat the butter and sugar to a soft white cream, add the eggs one by one, and beat well in. Stir the flour in very lightly. Add the cherries and half fill the tins with the mixture. Bake the cakes in a moderately hot oven for about fifteen minutes. Note.—Currants may be used instead of cherries, and patty tins if the others are not to hand. Ratafias Prepare a mixture as for Macaroons but only use four rounded tablespoonfuls of ground almonds, one level table- spoonful of rice flour, no vanilla or chopped almonds. The rounds should only be made the size of sixpence. 32

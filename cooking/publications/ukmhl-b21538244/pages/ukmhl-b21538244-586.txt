512 THE COMPLETE COOK thickness, the latter should be about an eighth of an inch thick. Place these pieces one on the top of the other, arranging the colours as prettily as possible and brushing each layer with a little water before putting on another. Roll the pieces lightly together, trim the edges and cut into any pretty shapes, such as diamonds, cubes, crescents, etc. Note.—If preferred, the topmost layer can be brushed over with a little melted chocolate, before it is cut up and sprinkled with fine desiccated cocoanut, chopped pistachios, almonds, etc. To Melt Chocolate for Coating Purposes Purchase good coating chocolate, or, failing that, good plain chocolate. Grate or chop it finely, put it in a jar, place it in an upturned saucer in a saucepan containing a little hot water. Cover the jar, and keep the water hot but not boiling, until the chocolate is dissolved. Do not stir it. When the chocolate is dissolved, beat it for ten minutes. Rewarm it, again beat it, and it is ready for use. It should be kept warm over hot water while it is being used, and will require beating occasionally. Note.—Sweets coated with chocolate will never be successful if they are coated on a wet foggy day or in a hot steamy room in which saucepans, etc., are boiling. Chocolate Almonds Ingredients— Sweet almonds. Good coating chocolate. Method.—Shell the almonds and slightly brown them in the oven. Grate the chocolate, put it in a jar or cup, place this in a pan of boiling water, and let it melt gently (see Directions for Melting Chocolate). When the almonds are cold, dip them into the chocolate, then lay them on an oiled tin and leave them to harden. Chocolate Ginger or Pineapple Proceed in exactly the same way as for Chocolate Almonds but, of course, the ginger and pineapple must not be put in the oven, and will require cutting to a .convenient size and shape. Note.—Almost every variety of fruits, nuts, or sweetmeat mixtures may be coated in this manner.

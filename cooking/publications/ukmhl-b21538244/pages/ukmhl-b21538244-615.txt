Method.—Pick over the sloes and prick each one several times with a needle. Put them in a large stone jar ; they should half fill it. Add the cloves, candy coarsely pounded, and the shelled almonds. Fill up the jar with gin. Cork down tightly and shake the jar well every day for a month or more. Strain off the gin through fine muslin into clean dry bottles. Cork them tightly, resin the corks, and store in a cool dry place for two or three months. Note.—An excellent Wine may be made from the sloes after they have been used for the gin, by pouring two quarts of boiling water on to the strained sloes, adding six fresh almonds and a little more sugar candy. Let it stand for a month, then strain and bottle; it is a lovely colour and excellent flavour, though less strong than the gin. Tea Ingredients— Allow a teaspoonful of tea to reduce the proportion of tea each half-pint of water or when a large cpiantity is re- breakfastcupfuls required : but cjuired. Method.—Have the water freshly boiling, see the pot is quite clean, scald it, and put in the required quantity of tea. Pour on the w'ater, and let it stand for about three to five minutes in a warm place. Excellent pots are now sold containing strainers in which to put the tea. These can be withdrawn after the tea has “ stood ” long enough. If the tea is allowed to stand too long on the leaves, the fragrant aroma is wasted, and the tannin is extracted. Note.—A slice of lemon is a good substitute for milk in tea. Iced or Russian Tea Method.—Make tea as above. Strain it off the leaves and allow it to become cold. When ready to serve, put two lumps of sugar in a glass, fill it with broken ice, add a slice of lemon, and fill up the glass with cold tea.

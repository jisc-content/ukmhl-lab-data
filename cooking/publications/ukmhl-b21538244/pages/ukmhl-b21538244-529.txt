A little brandy or rum may be used in the place of vanilla if it is advisable to make it still more strengthening. Savoury Meat Jelly higredien ts— Half a raw fowl. Half a pound of lean beef. Half a pound of lean veal. Five sheets of gelatine. One teaspoonful of chopped shallot. One inch of carrot and celery. A bunch of herbs. Half a glass of sherry. One teaspoonful of meat glaze. One and a half pints of water. Salt and pepper. Method.—Cut off all fat from the chicken and meat, and cut them into small pieces; put them in a saucepan with the cold water and a little salt, and let them soak for half an hour. Now add the herbs, carrot, celery, shallot, and glaze, and simmer all for four hours, keeping the lid tightly on the pan. Melt the gelatine in a little warm water. Strain off the meat liquor into a basin and add the dissolved gelatine, wine, and seasoning. Strain this through a fine hair sieve or a piece of muslin and leave it until cold, and use as required. PUDDINGS FOR INVALIDS Apple Cream Ingredients— Two medium-sized cooking apples. Castor sugar to taste. Half a gill of cream. Three ratafias. Method.—Peel, core, and slice the apples, then stew them until soft in two tablespoonfuls of water. Rub them through a fine wire sieve. Whip the cream till it will just hang on the whisk. Stir it lightly into the apple pulp. Sweeten it to taste and colour it a pretty pale pink with a few drops of cochineal, if liked. Pile up the mixture in a glass dish and grate the ratafias over the top. Serve it cold. Note.—The ratafias may be omitted if the patient is on strict diet.

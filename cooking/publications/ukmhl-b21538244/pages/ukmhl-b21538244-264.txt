224 THE COMPLETE COOK Meat Porcupine Ingrcdicn ts— One breakfastcupful of chopped cooked ham or bacon. Two breakfastcupfuls of cooked chopped veal, poultry, or lamb. One egg. One teacupful of stock. One teacupful of mashed potato. Three teaspoonfuls of chopped parsley. One teaspoonful of lemon juice. Two ounces of raw fat bacon. Method.—Mix the chopped cooked veal and ham, parsley and potato. Add the beaten egg, lemon juice, and enough stock to bind the mixture so that it will not crumble. Season it carefully. Well grease a baking tin. Shape the mixture into the usual form of a galantine. Cut the raw bacon in strips one inch long, and a quarter of an inch wide. Make holes in the meat shape with a skewer, insert the strips of bacon, leaving the ends of it half an inch out. Should the holes be made too large, gently push the meat up round the bacon. Bake in a moderate oven till the roll is hot through and the bacon is browned. Lift it carefully on to a hot dish, and pour round any good brown or tomato sauce. Note.—Chicken, rabbit, or other meat can be used. Tongue instead of ham, and fresh breadcrumbs for the potato. Baked Meat Roll Use the same mixture and make in the same way as for Meat Porcupine, but instead of larding it with bacon brush the surface over with an extra beaten egg, and cover it evenly with browned breadcrumbs. Also add a heaped tablespoonful of dripping to the tin and baste the roll with it frequently.

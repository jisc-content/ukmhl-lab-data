THE COMPLETE COOK 458 serve it heaped up in a pyramid form on a hot dish. Garnish it with neat sippets of toast. Note.—Chicken or pigeon may be used in the place of pheasant. INVALID JELLIED FOODS Chicken Jelly Ingredients— One fowl. Salt and pepper. One pint of cold water. Method.—Chop the fowl into small pieces. Put it in the pan with the water and a little salt. Let it simmer slowly for one hour. Then take out the bones, pound them in a mortar, add them again to the other ingredients, and let them simmer for another hour, skimming occasionally. Strain off the liquid through a fine sieve or piece of muslin. Season it carefully and serve cold, a few spoonfuls at a time. Note.—Before adding the seasoning, ascertain that it is allowed. Egg Jelly Ingredients— Two new-laid eggs. Three and a half gills of water. Half a gill of lemon juice. Five sheets of gelatine. Two lemons. One teacupful of loaf sugar. Method.—Wipe the lemons and pare them very thinly. Put the rinds into a pan with the water, sugar, and strained lemon juice. Bring these to boiling point, add the gelatine and let it dissolve. Then draw the pan to the side of the fire and let it cool slightly. Beat up the eggs and add them gradually to the other ingredients, whisking well all the time. Heat the mixture carefully for a few minutes, but on no account let it boil, or the eggs will curdle. Strain the jelly into a mould and leave it till cold. Note.—Orange rinds and juice may be substituted for lemons, if liked. Jellied Milk Ingredients— Half a pint of new milk. Three sheets of gelatine. Half a gill of cream. Six lumps of sugar. Half a gill of water. A few drops of vanilla. Method.—Put the water, sugar, and gelatine in a pan over a slow fire and let the gelatine dissolve; stir it occasionally.

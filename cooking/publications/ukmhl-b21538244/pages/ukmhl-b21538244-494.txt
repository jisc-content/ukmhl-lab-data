424 THE COMPLETE COOK The chief points to remember are:— Keep the omelet pan for omelets only, and do not permit it to be washed, only rubbed with paper till clean. A copper tin-lined pan is desirable, but an ordinary iron one will answer quite well, or one of fireproof chinaware. Use fresh butter and the best eggs : only a few ingredients are needed, but these must be of the best. Omelets made with three to four eggs are sufficiently large to manage conveniently. See all the ingredients and apparatus, both for cooking and serving, are at hand before starting to prepare the omelet. Beat the eggs lightly till whites and yolks are mixed, but not frothed, except in the case of the souffle varieties. A tablespoonful of milk or cream to every three eggs is an improvement. The butter for frying must be so hot that it is just ceasing to bubble when the egg mixture is poured into the pan. The fire must be very brisk and clear; slow cooking makes a tough omelet. The exterior should be delicately browned and crisp, while the mixture inside is only just set, being soft and creamy. Omelets must be served immediately they are cooked, or they sink and become tough in a very few minutes. Cheese Omelet Prepare and cook a mixture as for Savoury Omelet, but leave out the herbs, onion, and parsley, and stir into the eggs a heaped tablespoonful of grated Parmesan cheese. Sprinkle a little of the same over the surface when the omelet is served. Fish Omelet Ingredients— Three eggs. One tablespoonful of milk. One rounded tablespoonful of butter. One tablespoonful of cooked chopped fish. One teaspoonful of chopped parsley. Half a tablespoonful of any fish sauce or milk. Seasoning. Method.—Be careful there is no bone or skin with the fish. Heat it with the parsley, a small bit of the butter, and enough sauce or milk to well moisten it. Add the seasoning and keep it hot. Beat up the eggs, add the milk, and a little seasoning. Heat the butter in the omelet pan. When it has nearly left off

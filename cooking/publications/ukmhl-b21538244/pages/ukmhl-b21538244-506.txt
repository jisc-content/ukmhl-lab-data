THE COMPLETE COOK 436 spices. If there is no beef tea available, use some good meat extract. Port wine may be used instead of claret. Jellied Beef Tea Ingredients— Half a pint of strong beef tea. Salt and pepper. Two leaves of sheet gelatine. Caramel colouring. Method.—Dissolve the gelatine in a little hot water, then strain it into the beef tea. Season it carefully and add a few drops of caramel to improve the colour ; this is quite harmless. Pour the jelly into little moulds and leave them to set. To turn them out, dip the tins into tepid water and shake them gently. Note.—Clear soup could be used instead of beef tea. Jellied Beef Tea. No. 2 Ingredients— One pound of lean raw beef. One quart of cold water. -One ox or calPs foot. Half a teaspoonful of salt. Method.—Wash the meat and foot quickly and dry them. Scrape the meat into fine shreds. Lay it as soon as scraped in the water with the salt and let it stand for half an hour. Chop the foot into small pieces. Put it and the meat and water into an earthenware jar. Cover it tightly. Place the jar in a saucepan of boiling water on the fire. Let the water boil steadily round the jar for about eight hours, taking care to replenish it as it boils away. If more convenient place the jar in a slow oven. Then strain off the solid parts, season the liquid, and put it aside till cold. Remove any grease that may rise on the top. Note.—This is particularly strengthening, and beef tea in a jelly makes an agreeable change. It may be heated, if liked. Beef Tea and Malt Extract Ingredients— Half a pint of beef tea. One small teaspoonful of malt One tablespoonful of fine fresh extract. white crumbs. Salt. Method.—Heat the beef tea without boiling it, add the crumbs, stirring all the time, then add the malt extract. See that it is nicely seasoned, and serve.

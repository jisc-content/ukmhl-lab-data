CHAPTER XXVI .k 475 BREAD AND SCONES White Bread Ingredients— Six heaped breakfastcupfuls of flour (half quartern). Half an ounce of compressed yeast. One and a half breakfastcupfuls of tepid water. Two level teaspoonfuls of salt. One level teaspoonful of castor sugar. Method.—Warm a basin and the flour; this saves time. Sieve the flour and salt into the basin. Put the yeast and sugar into another basin ; cream them together until liquid. Add the tepid water; if too hot it will kill the yeast plant, and the flour will not rise. Make a well in the flour and strain in the yeast and water. Stir in a little of the flour from the sides, leaving a wall of it all round the yeast and water. Cover the basin, and put this “ sponge,” as it is called, in a warm place to rise for about twenty minutes, or until the surface of the yeast and water is thickly covered with bubbles. (When letting a dough of any sort rise, the time required depends on the warmth of the weather and room, and where the basin is placed. If the latter is too hot, the dough rises too rapidly and the bread may be heavy ; if too cool, the action of the yeast is delayed.) Then knead all the flour into the “ sponge,” using the hand Add more tepid water if the dough is too stiff It should be as soft as possible, without actually sticking to the fingers. It is better made a little too soft than too dry. Dough that is to be made into special shapes and baked without the support of a tin should be stiffer than tin or pan bread. When mixed, turn the dough on to a floured board and knead it well with the hands until quite smooth and elastic. This is done so that all the ingredients are evenly distributed and no balls of dry flour left in the dough. Use as little flour as possible while kneading, and on no account put back the little wads of dough off the fingers and scrapings of the board. Take care the kneading is

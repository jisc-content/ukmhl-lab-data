Two tablespoonfuls of lemon juice. Method.—Wipe the oranges and pare off the rinds very thinly. Put them in a pan with the water, sugar, and lemon juice. Heat these gently, add the gelatine, and stir until it is dissolved. Pour in the orange juice. Strain the jelly into a pretty mould, having first rinsed it in cold water. Leave the jelly till cold and set. Dip the mould into tepid water, shake it gently on to the left hand and slip the jelly out on to a glass dish.

Remove all pulp without damaging the peel. Make the jelly as already described. Colour one-half of it a pretty red with cochineal. Arrange the halves of peel in ice or in a shallow baking tin, so that they keep each other steady. Fill some with the coloured jelly, others with the plain. Leave until set; then with a sharp knife cut each in two. Probably some of the sippets will not be quite full of jelly, in that case with a sharp knife trim off the edge of peel, taking care not to break the jelly. Arrange them on laurel leaves. Note.—Should there be a little hole made in the centre of the cups of orange when scooping out the pulp, fill it up with a little butter before putting in the jelly.

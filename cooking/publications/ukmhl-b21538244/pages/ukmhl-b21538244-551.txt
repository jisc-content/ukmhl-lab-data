CHAPTER XXVII CAKES AND BISCUITS Helpful Hints about Cake Making 1. See the oven is heating before starting to make the mixture. 2. Sieve all flour to remove any lumps and to aerate it, this lightening the cakes. 3. Line all cake tins, except tiny ones, with greased paper. 4. Use good butter and eggs; good dripping is better than bad butter. 5. “Fold” (see How to Fold, etc.) flour into the eggs, etc., as lightly as possible. 6. Clean all fruit, and take the sugar out of the peel. 7. Fruit cakes need rather a hot oven just at first, in order to set the mixture quickly; otherwise the fruit sinks to the bottom. 8. Until a cake is set, do not move it, and shut the oven door very gently, or, if a light mixture, it will fall, and have a hole in the middle. 9. To prevent a cake getting too dark on the top, lay a sheet of paper over it, resting it on the edges of the paper band lining the tin. 10. To see if cakes are cooked through, push a clean skewer into the centre. If baked sufficiently, it will be quite clear and bright on withdrawal. 11. Leave all cakes tilted up against the edge of a plate, or place them on a sieve, when taken out of the oven, to allow the steam to escape, not to condense in them. 31

THE COMPLETE COOK 58 5. Small cakes baked slowly become dry and hard. Therefore—i. Beat eggs and butter and sugar well together. 2. Never beat the mixtures after adding the flour and fruit. 4 and 5. Bake large cakes slowly and small cakes quickly. The Principles of Frying 1. Moisture in any form causes hot fat to splutter and spoils the colour and crispness of the article fried. 2. Foods placed in fat, before it is the right heat, become greasy, sodden, indigestible and badly coloured. 3. Very hot fat seals the outside of the food to be fried at once, preventing grease soaking into or juices escaping from the food. 4. Overheated fat is dangerous, and makes food fried in it very unwholesome. Therefore—i. Dry all foods to be fried as much as possible. 2. Wait till a faint bluish smoke rises from the fat before putting in the food. 3. Be careful the fat does not become overheated and burn. If the smoke rises very thickly the fat is too hot, and if the pan is not removed from the fire it will burst into flame. The Principles of Invalid Cookery 1. The digestions of invalids are very weak, and must be given as little work to do as possible. 2. Invalids require nourishing foods to regain their strength. 3. Illness leaves invalids usually with very little desire for and often a great disinclination against food, so they must be tempted to eat. Therefore—i. Prepare all foods so that they can be easily digested. 2. and 3. Select nourishing articles of food and serve them in small portions as daintily as possible. The Principles of Vegetable Soups. 1. Cold liquids soften pulse or dried vegetables, but spoil the colour of fresh ones. 2. Fat is necessary for health, if it is lacking in any food the deficiency must be supplied. 3. Fast boiling wastes liquids by evaporation.

395 CHAPTER XXI SALADS American Nut Salad Ingredients— Equal quantities of prepared apple, Mayonnaise or cream dressing, shredded celery, and chopped Olives or gherkins, nuts. Seasoning. Lettuce. Method.—Any mixture of nuts can be used, those met with usually are almonds, peeled walnuts, and pine-kernels. The walnuts may be par-boiled and then peeled, if liked, but this slight cooking will soften them somewhat. Equal portions of each variety used are not necessary. Peel the apples with a silver knife ; if large, cut in eight pieces lengthways ; remove the cores and slice thinly. Shred the celery thinly across each stick. Mix all these together with a liberal amount of the dressing used, and arrange them with the prepared lettuce round as a border in the salad bowl. Garnish the dish with stoned olives or strips of gherkins. Carrot Ingredients— One breakfastcupful of cooked carrot, cut in dice. One lettuce. Half a lemon. A small stick of horseradish. Salad Salad oil. Any salad dressing preferred. Salt, pepper, and castor sugar. One teaspoonful of chopped parsley. Method.—Lay the dice of carrot on a dish. Sprinkle them with the parsley, salt, pepper, castor sugar, and grated lemon rind and a few drops of oil. Mix all lightly together and heap them up in a salad bowl. Wash the lettuce and tear it in small pieces; toss these lightly in any good salad dressing, then arrange them in a border round the carrot. Garnish with a few tufts of grated horseradish.

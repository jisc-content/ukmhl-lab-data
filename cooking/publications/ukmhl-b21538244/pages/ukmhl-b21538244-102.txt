THE COMPLETE COOK 70 5. Neglecting to soak it before heating it. 6. Heating it too rapidly. 7. Allowing it to boil. 8. Overseasoning it. 9. Neglecting to remove any fat from the surface. Bread Making 1. Inferior flour and stale yeast used. 2. Yeast plant killed by overcreaming it with the sugar. 3. Water too hot or cold. 4. Sponge set to rise in too cold or hot a place. 5. Dough made too dry or moist. 6. Dough insufficiently kneaded, or chilled by kneading it too long. 7. Dough soured by : (a) Allowing it to rise too rapidly. (d) Subjecting it to uneven distribution of heat. (c) Letting it rise too much, so that the gas escapes and the dough sinks. 8. Oven too cool, so the yeast plant is not killed rapidly enough after the dough is put in the oven. 9. Oven too hot, so the exterior of the loaves is too dark before being cooked through. 10. Oven too cool, so the bread is too pale in colour, and dry and hard owing to the slow baking. 11. No test applied to ascertain if the loaves are baked through. 12. The steam not permitted to escape from the loaves, so it condenses in them, causing them to become sodden and heavy. Cakes 1. Using bad or damp flour, rancid butter, cheap, dirty fruit, inferior sugar, and eggs of doubtful freshness. 2. Rubbing the butter into the flour, or creaming the butter and sugar insufficiently. 3. Insufficiently beating in the eggs. 4. Beating the mixture after mixing in the flour. 5. Mixing all the ingredients carelessly, so that they are not evenly distributed. 6. Baking large cakes quickly and small cakes slowly. 7. Omitting to test the cakes to ascertain if they are cooked through.

Serve with extra milk or cream, if liked, or with jam or stewed fruit. Note.—Inferior rice will never make good creamy puddings; condensed milk may be used and the sugar left out, if it is a sweetened brand. If skimmed milk is used, a little more butter can be added, or scraped suet. Lemon rind, a dust of powdered cinnamon or vanilla may be used as flavouring.

Method.—Wash the rice. Boil the milk, sprinkle in the rice and let it simmer gently until about half cooked. Then add the sugar and salt and pour it all into a double saucepan, or a large covered jar can be placed in a pan with boiling water to come half-way up the jar.

Add a flavouring of vanilla or nutmeg and stir in the cream whisked until it will nearly, but not quite, hang on the whisk. Serve the rice as cold as possible, heaped up in a glass dish. It must not be moulded, as even when cold it must be a soft creamy mass. Serve with any stewed fruit. Note.—The cream may be left out if wished, but more milk must be added to make it the desired consistency. Rice Croquettes Ingredients— Four level tablespoonfuls of rice.

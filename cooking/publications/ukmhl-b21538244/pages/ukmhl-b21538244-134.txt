102 THE COMPLETE COOK Scrape Horseradish Scrub the root well. Peel the brownish outside off. Use a sharp knife, scrape downwards and obtain the thinnest shavings possible, as thick pieces are unpleasant to eat. Bone Meat and Poultry Anyone who can use a sharp knife and scrape and cut meat or fish from a bone without cutting her own flesh, can bone anything from the smallest bird, chop, or fish, to a leg or forequarter of lamb or a turkey. A small knife with a sharp, short, pointed blade is all that is required. It is well to begin on a small scale by removing the bone from a chop. The aim is to remove the flesh from the bone, without cutting into the flesh or destroying its shape more than is necessary. To Bone a Leg of Mutton Cut it off at the first joint, insert the knife near the joint, leaving all the gristle and tendons on the bone. Then begin at the thick end and scrape the fat away from the bone, then follow it (you can easily tell by feeling if you cannot see it) until you come to the joint. Leave all the gristle and cords on the bone and continue scraping off the flesh until the whole bone is out. It could easily be cut through from the outside to the bone and remove it in that way, but the flesh would have to be sewn together and much of the juice would escape. After removing the bone, stuff the cavity left and sew the skin together at the smaller end. Then bring the edges together at the upper end, crowding all the flesh inside, and sew the skin together tightly. This gives a rectangular form of solid meat and stuffing. When exposed to the air in a hot oven the juices are kept inside; the meat is more con- veniently served, and when cold does not become hard and dry. Any other pieces of meat are boned in a similar way. To Bone a Bird, Fowl, or Turkey In this case the flesh is to be kept in the skin in order to preserve the shape. The skin should be firm and unbroken and the bird should not be drawn. Remove the head, singe

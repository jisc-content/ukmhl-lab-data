One teaspoonful of sherry. One gill of tomato pulp sieved. Seasoning. Method.—Warm the jelly, sieved tomato pulp, and sherry, simmer it for one or two minutes.

One rounded tablespoonful of butter. Two rounded tablespoonfuls of cornflour. One onion. Two tablespoonfuls of ham or bacon cut in dice. A bunch of parsley, herbs, and a bay leaf. One pint of stock. Six peppercorns. Salt. Method.—Melt the butter in a stewpan, chop the onion, add it and the ham, spice, and herbs, and fry them gently for fifteen minutes. Put in the sliced tomatoes, add the stock and the cornflour mixed smoothly with a little cold stock or water. Simmer the sauce gently for fifteen minutes, stirring it well. Season it carefully. Rub it through a hair or fine wire sieve and serve it in a hot tureen. Note.—If the tomatoes are very watery and the sauce seems too thin, boil it quickly for a few minutes with the lid off the pan. If too acid add a dust of castor sugar.

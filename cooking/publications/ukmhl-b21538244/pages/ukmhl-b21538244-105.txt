COMMON CAUSES OF FAILURE 73 3. Gravies spoilt by making them : (a) Too thick or thin. (/>) Too dark or pale. (c) Careless seasoning. 4. Hardening the meat by letting it boil and re-cook, instead of merely re-heating it. 5. Not allowing the meat to remain long enough in the gravy to become flavoured by it, in the case of curry, hash, mince, etc. Sauces 1. Wrong proportion of ingredients used, especially flour, to liquids, so that the consistency is too thick or thin. 2. Burning the butter when heating it. 3. Letting the roux (butter and flour) become brown for a white sauce during the glazing process. 4. Browning the roux for a brown sauce too much, so that the flour tastes bitter. 5. Browning the roux insufficiently for a brown sauce. 6. Not stirring the flour in smoothly. 7. Adding hot liquids too quickly, so that lumps form. 8. Neglecting to stir the sauce till it boils, so that it becomes lumpy. 9. Boiling it insufficiently, so that owing to the uncooked starch grains, the flour tastes rough and raw. 10. Failing to remove any scum. 11. Over or under seasoning. 12. Neglecting to strain the sauce. Stewing 1. Insufficient vegetables used. 2. Too much liquid added. 3. Boiled instead of simmered. 4. Grease not removed. 5. Too much, or insufficient time for cooking allowed. 6. Pan not closely covered, so loss of flavour, aroma, and liquid result. 7. Carelesss seasoning and unsightly serving. Steaming 1. Moulds and basins insufficiently greased. 2. A greased paper not twisted over the top, so condensed steam leaks in.

WHAT TO DO WHEN THINGS GO WRONG 91 lid ; re-heat and serve as usual. More liquid has sometimes to be added. Cream Over-whipped Result.—Rough and curdled. Remedy.—None, so as to be able to use it as whipped cream, but if it is whipped a little more it will become butter, and with a little salt added it is delicious for immediate use as fresh butter. Fruit Preserves that will not Jelly This may arise from insufficient boiling, or, which frequently happens, because the fruit, through some reason or other, lacks the necessary gelatinous substance it should contain to form jelly. It then merely becomes gummy. Remedy.—For the first error continue to boil it for a longer time. If the fault lies in the fruit, add some juice strained off from apples stewed in a little water. The apples should not be peeled or cored. Add the juice, mix it well in and reboil the preserve. An Insufficiently Cooked Pudding Residt.—When turned out it breaks, and the centre is dis- covered to be unset. Remedy.—Regrease the basin or mould, slip the pudding back into it. Cover again with the cloth or paper and reboil, steam, or bake it as the case may be. Jelly too Stiff Remedy.—Melt it, adding more wine, water, lemon juice, etc., pour it back into the mould and reset it. A Cream that Sets too Rapidly Result.—It becomes rough and knotty as the gelatine is being stirred into it, and fails to take the shape of the mould. Remedy.—Put the mixture in a basin over a pan of hot water, stir it gently till it melts, then whisk it lightly off the fire till it is just beginning to set again, then pour it into the mould. Greasy Soups, Sauces, Gravies, etc. Remedy.—Boil them gently, letting the heat be greater on

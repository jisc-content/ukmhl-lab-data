THE COMPLETE COOK desired tint and flavour. For piping, the butter should be allowed to cool again. Note.—If liked, the coffee icing may be dispensed with and the top and sides spread very smoothly with the butter filling and then the top piped with the same. Cookies Ingredients— About two level breakfastcupfuls of flour. One level breakfastcupful of castor sugar. Four rounded tablespoonfuls of butter. Two eggs. One tablespoonful of milk.

Three rounded tablespoonfuls of butter. Three rounded tablespoonfuls of castor sugar. Two eggs. Quarter of a teaspoonful of baking powder. The rind of half a lemon. Method.—Sieve the cornflour and baking powder. Grate the lemon rind on to the sugar. Beat the butter and sugar until like whipped cream. Whisk in the eggs one at a time.

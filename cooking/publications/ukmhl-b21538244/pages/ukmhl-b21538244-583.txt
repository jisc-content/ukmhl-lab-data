509 SWEETMEATS A Few Hints for Amateurs Stigars.—Use the best cane or icing sugars obtainable, and rub the latter invariably through a hair sieve. Glucose.—Is like clear white honey and is but a few pence per pound. Essences.—Should be specially powerful for confectionery. Colourings.—Use vegetable paste colourings usually, but liquids are also needed at times. Pans.—Must be kept only for sweet-making. Hands.—Never use highly scented soaps when washing these, as the flavour is apt to be imparted.

Graming indicates that the dissolved sugar has re-formed again into crystals. The Thennoineter may burst if put at once into boiling syrup; it should first be placed in hot water. Marble Slabs.—Let these warm a little in cold weather before pouring on boiling sugar.

Overboiling or Graining.—Should this happen, add about half the water added at first, and reboil it to the desired degree. Toffee.—For this and similar sweets always use a pan much larger than is actually needed for the quantity to be boiled, as these varieties boil over very quickly. Water.—For testing boiled sugar, have the water as cold as possible, changing it frequently.

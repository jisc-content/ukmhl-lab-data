423 EGGS AND OMELETS Scrambled Eggs Ingredients— Three eggs. Salt and pepper. Two tablespoonfuls of milk. Hot buttered toast. One tablespoonful of butter. Method.—Have ready some neatly trimmed slices of hot buttered toast. Break the eggs into a basin, beat them with a fork until yolk and white are mixed, and add the milk and seasoning. Melt the butter in a small pan, pour in the egg mixture and stir it with a wooden spoon over a slow fire until the mixture becomes a soft creamy mass. Heap it up neatly on the toast, and serve at once. Note.—If liked, a little chopped parsley may be added to the mixture, or a tablespoonful of chopped ham, tongue, poultry, game, fish, or mushrooms. Steamed Eggs Ingredients— Two small eggs. Salt and pepper. A small piece of butter. Method.—Well butter two fireproof china pannikins or small cups. Break an egg carefully into each. Sprinkle them with salt and pepper. Put them into a pan with boiling water to come half-way up them. Cover them with a piece of buttered paper, and let the water boil gently until the eggs are lightly set. Serve them immediately in the cases in which they were cooked. OMELETS It is stated that an Englishwoman cannot master the art of omelet-making, in which her Continental sisters excel. It is merely a matter of taking a little pains to learn the few simple rules, and to remember that “ Practice makes perfect.” The first two or three trials will probably not meet with success, but after that a person of average intelligence should have acquired something of the necessary skilful manipulation. There are various kinds of omelets :— Plain savoury. Stuffed. Sweet, Souffle.

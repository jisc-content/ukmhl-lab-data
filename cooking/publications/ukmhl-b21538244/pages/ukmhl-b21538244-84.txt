CHAPTER IV THE MOST IMPORTANT CHAPTER IN THE BOOK:— THE PRINCIPLES OF COOKING—THE METHODS OF COOKING: THEIR SPECIAL POINTS—COMMON CAUSES OF FAILURE —AVERAGE TIMES RE- QUIRED FOR COOKING FOODS—TEMPERATURES REQUIRED: JUDGING WITH AND WITHOUT A THERMOMETER—TABLE OF MEASURES. THE PRINCIPLES OF COOKING Master these and it should be comparatively easy to follow intelligently any recipe; also to detect where, as is sometimes the case, the directions are unscientific. What is a Principle? It is a great fixed law from which rules are formed. There may be exceptions to rules but never to principles. The Principles of Boiling Potatoes 1. Peeling potatoes thickly causes waste. 2. Exposure to the air after the skins are removed causes discoloration. 3. Salt is necessary for the health, and potatoes are deficient in this mineral. 4. Fast boiling breaks potatoes before they are cooked. 5. Moisture caused by the retention of the steam prevents potatoes being dry and floury. Therefore—i. Peel potatoes thinly. 2. Lay them in cold water after peeling. 3. Add salt to the water in which they are cooked. 4. Boil them gently. 5. Drain off the water carefully and dry them well by the side of the fire.

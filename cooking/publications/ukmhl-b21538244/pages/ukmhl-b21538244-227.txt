193 FISH seasoned flour. Beat up the egg on a plate. Put the crumbs on a sheet of paper. Brush the fish thoroughly with egg, lift them on to and cover them with crumbs. Shake off the loose ones and flatten the surface by gently pressing the crumbs with a knife. Have ready a deep pan of hot fat. When a faint smoke rises from the fat, put in one fish at a time and fry it a golden brown. It will take about five to eight minutes accord- ing to the thickness of the fish. After the first two minutes draw the pan somewhat to the side, in order to lessen the heat, or the fish will be too dark a colour before being cooked through. Drain the fish on soft paper. Arrange them on a lace paper on a hot dish. Garnish the fish with heaps of fried parsley and cut lemon. Note.—Very small fresh haddocks may be fried in a similar manner. Fried Fillets Ingredients— Four skinned whitings. Two rounded tablespoonfuls of flour. One raw egg. One tablespoonful of salad oil. of Whiting One teaspoonful of chopped parsley. Half a lemon. Salt and pepper : fried parsley. Breadcrumbs : frying fat. Method.—Wash, dry, and fillet the whitings. Mix the flour with a little salt and pepper. Beat up the egg, mix it with the oil, parsley, and a teaspoonful of lemon juice. Smooth the fillets, trim off any rough edges. Dip them in the flour, etc. Then brush them over with the beaten egg, etc., and crumb them. Skewer the fillets round like rings, using pointed matches for skewers, and dip each end of the fillets in egg to make them stick more firmly. Should any egg and crumbs be removed in the skewering, retouch the patches up. Fry the fillets a golden brown, in plenty of smoking hot fat, drain them on paper, draw out the little skewers carefully, and serve the rings heaped on a hot dish. Garnish them with fried parsley and cut lemon, and hand with them a tureen of fish sauce. Note.—Strips of filleted sole, haddock, or plaice can be fried in this way, but require trimming to make a neat ring. 3

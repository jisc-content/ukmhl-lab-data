THE PRINCIPLES OF COOKING 55 4. Boiling hardens the albumen in meat, making it difficult to digest. Therefore—i. Scrape the meat finely. 2. Place it to soak in cold water. 3 and 4. Never permit beef tea to reach boiling point. The Principles of Re-heating Cooked Meats 1. Re-heated meat contains less nutriment and flavour than when it is freshly cooked. 2. Great heat will harden the albumen in the meat, thus making it tough. 3. Cold gravies will draw out the remaining juices of the meat. Therefore—i. Season the mixtures carefully, using stock made from the rougher portions for gravies. 2 and 3. Place the meat in hot, but not boiling, or cold gravies, and re-heat it gently without letting it boil. The Principles of Steamed Puddings, etc. 1. Grease prevents mixtures sticking to basins and moulds, if they stick the puddings break. 2. Water soaking into the mixtures causes puddings to be heavy. 3. The slow cooking by steam takes a longer time, but renders food more digestible than when it is boiled. 4. Food that is steamed loses none of its nutritious elements in the water, as is the case with boiled foods. Therefore—i. Grease all basins. 2. Cover the basins over and see the water cannot boil into them. 3. Steam mixtures for a longer period than if they are boiled. 4. When possible steam foods instead of boiling them. The Principles of Making Sauces 1. Hot liquids added quickly to flour cause the starch grains to form lumps. 2. Starch grains that cook unevenly form lumps. 3. Insufficiently cooked starch grains are indigestible and have a rough taste.

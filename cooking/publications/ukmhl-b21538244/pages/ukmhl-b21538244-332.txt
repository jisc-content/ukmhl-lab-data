284 THE COMPLETE COOK Method.—Mash the potatoes. Chop the carrots, cabbage, and onion. Mix and season them well with salt and pepper. Make the dripping very hot in the frying pan. Put in the mixture, spreading it evenly over the pan. Fry it for about five minutes, then raise a corner and see if it is browned ; if so, put a plate over the pan and turn the cake on to it. Slip it back again into the pan with the browned side uppermost and fry the second side. If necessary, add more dripping for the second frying. Serve it whole on a hot dish, or cut into four pieces. Note.—Any sort of cooked vegetables can be used including beetroot, this latter would of course colour the cake. It is excellent with potatoes only. Method.—Unless there is need of great haste, boil the marrow uncut and unpeeled. In this way no flavour is lost. Put the marrow into boiling water and boil it for twenty to thirty-five minutes, or until tender when pierced with a skewer. Then peel, quarter, and remove the seeds. Lay the pieces on a slice of dry toast in the vegetable dish with the white sauce poured over, or served separately. Peel, quarter, and seed the marrow, place the pieces in a steamer and steam them for about thirty minutes to one hour, or until tender. This is the best way to cook marrow, as no flavour is lost. Serve it as for Boiled Marrow. Vegetable Marrow, Boiled Ingredients— A vegetable marrow. Toast. Three-quarters of a pint of white sauce. Vegetable Marrow, Steamed

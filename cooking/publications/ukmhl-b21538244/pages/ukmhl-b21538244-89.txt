THE PRINCIPLES OF COOKING 57 Therefore—i. Keep pastry cool and handle it as little and lightly as possible. 2. Mix plenty of fat with the flour, or if the supply of fat is limited, add baking powder. 3 and 4. If baking powder is used, bake the pastry as soon as possible after adding the moisture. The Principles of Stewing 1. Boiling hardens the albumen contained in the meat, making it tough. 2. Long slow cooking in a moist heat softens the fibres of the meat, rendering them easily masticated and digested. 3. Much of the aroma and flavour of foods is lost, and liquids wasted by evaporation, if cooking vessels are left uncovered. Therefore—i. and 2. Simmer foods to be stewed, do not let them boil. 3. Use a covered utensil to retain all the aroma and flavour of stews. The Principles of Making Milk Puddings 1. Starch grains swell with moisture and heat to about three times their original size. 2. Imperfectly cooked starch grains are indigestible. 3. Milk, if cooked quickly, deteriorates in flavour and wastes by evaporation before the grains of rice, etc., used are cooked. Therefore—i. Use barely 2 ounces of rice, etc., to one pint of milk, so that the grains have enough moisture to absorb and sufficient room for their increased size. 2. and 3. Cook milk puddings as slowly as possible, so that the grains have time to cook and the quantity and flavour of the milk is preserved. The Principles of Cake Making 1. Correct beating introduces air into mixtures. 2. Beating, after adding the flour and fruit, results in the air being forced out of the mixture. 3. Air when it expands with heat raises and lightens mixtures. 4. Large cakes baked quickly burn on the outside before they are cooked through.

44 THE COMPLETE COOK SHORT MARKETING HINTS By doing your own marketing, “ order books ” are avoided, the pick of the market is secured, and full advantage can be taken of any commodity which is very abundant. Fish is particularly liable to sudden rises in price, and, by studying the daily fluctuation, the expensive kinds may often be dis- pensed with, and the less sought after, and consequently cheaper, varieties substituted. Ready cash, or at least weekly accounts, command the lowest prices and at the same time give independence to bestow custom where best value is given. Cheapened foods are but rarely good bargains, the reductions arising from the loss of their primary freshness. To buy “the whole at a shilling,” instead of half of it at sevenpence, is no economy, if there is but small chance of using it wFile it is fresh. Take advantage of the seasons, so that variety may be secured, when each food in its turn becomes abundant and therefore cheap. Deal at good shops with a brisk trade, as the goods are fresher and there will be a larger selection from which to choose. Goods out of their natural season, but still in the markets, are expensive, and often the flavour is but poorly developed. Meat The flesh of young animals is less easily digested and less nutritious than that of mature ones. No joint of meat, even if low in price, can be deemed economical if very fat or bony. Therefore steaks and small pieces without bone are less expensive than they at first appear to be. Meat should not be moist and watery, and, if properly cooked, it should not shrink and waste greatly. If the colour is of a deep purple, or a pale pink, it is a sign of inferior and often of diseased meat. There should be but little smell from meat, and that not unpleasant, and such parts as kidneys and liver should be quite free from discoloration or spots. Beef is the most economical meat to buy, as it has the least bone and most nutritive material in a given bulk.

FISH SOUPS 159 Oyster Ingredients— Two dozen sauce oysters with their liquor. Two quarts of fish, or white stock. Two rounded tablespoonfuls of butter. Two rounded tablespoonfuls of flour. Half a gill of cream. Bisque Half a gill of hot milk. Two raw yolks of eggs. Half a lemon. A bunch of parsley and one bay leaf. One blade of mace. Ten white peppercorns. Salt: cayenne : nutmeg. Method.—Put the oysters with their liquor in a small pan, heat them gently till the edges curl up and the oysters begin to plump up; then take them off the fire, beard and halve them and strain the liquor. Save this and the beards. Melt the butter in a saucepan, add the flour, mix it in and stir it over the fire for two or three minutes, do not let it colour. Add the stock, oyster liquor, and beards, parsley, bay leaf, mace, and peppercorns. Stir all these till the soup boils, and let it boil gently for half an hour. Keep it well skimmed. Then strain the soup through a hair sieve or tammy cloth. Pour it back into the saucepan, reboil it; add the milk and strain in the yolks of eggs beaten up with the cream; let the soup cool a minute or so before adding this liaison, or the eggs will curdle. Re-heat without boiling the soup, add a careful seasoning, a few drops of strained lemon juice and, just before serving, the pieces of oyster. Note.—A plainer soup is made by leaving out the yolks and cream and using a little more flour if it is too thin. Tinned oysters may be used when fresh oysters are unobtainable.

THE COMPLETE COOK 312 Cabinet Pudding Ingredients— About four stale sponge cakes. Glace cherries, or mixed candied fruit. One pint of milk. One whole egg and two extra yolks. Three tablespoonfuls of castor sugar. A few grains of salt. Vanilla, or some other good essence. Method.—Well butter a mould, decorate the bottom prettily with some of the fruit. Break up the sponge cakes, pack them loosely into the mould in layers with a little fruit cut in small dice. Bring the milk nearly to boiling point, beat up the eggs, add the milk when slightly cooled gradually to them, stirring all the time, then add the sugar, salt, and essence. Pour the custard over the cake in the mould. Let it stand to soak for at least half an hour. Cover the top with a piece of buttered paper and steam it very gently for one hour. Turn it on to a hot dish and serve with it a good sweet sauce. Note.—If preferred, raisins may be used instead of candied fruit. A few macaroons, or ratafias, coarsely crushed and mixed with the cake are an improvement. If liked, this mixture may also be baked. Chelsea Pudding Prepare a custard as directed for Baked Custard Pudding, but before pouring it into the pie dish, put in a thick layer of any sieved cake crumbs, such as stale sponge cake, macaroons, etc. Then add a good layer of any jam or stewed fruit next the custard and cook the pudding in the same way as baked custard.

THE COMPLETE COOK 342 sultanas, chopped peel, castor sugar, grated lemon rind, and coloured milk. Beat up the eggs and add them with the wine. Let the mixture stand for half an hour, or longer, if the bread is stale. Have ready a greased mould or basin, put in the mixture, cover the top with a piece of greased paper, and steam it for two hours. Turn it carefully on to a hot dish and serve with it any good sweet sauce. Note.—If a cheaper pudding is preferred, omit the wine, and the juice of the lemon may be used instead. For a richer pudding add half a teacupful of cream. Windsor Tartlets Ingredients— Six ounces of any good pastry. Two eggs. Four rounded tablespoonfuls of butter. Four level tablespoonfuls of castor sugar. One rounded tablespoonful of cornflour. Five powdered macaroons. Eighteen glac^ cherries. One piece of lemon peel. Half a tablespoonful of chopped almonds. Method.—Put the butter and sugar into a basin and beat them to a cream. Add the yolks of eggs, one at a time, and beat each well in. Chop the cherries and peel, add them and the powdered macaroons to the mixture, mix thoroughly, add the almonds and cornflour. Roll out the pastry and line some small patty tins thinly with it. Whisk the whites of eggs to a stiff froth and stir them lightly into the mixture. Fill each lined tin three- parts full. Bake them in a moderate oven until the mixture is set and the whole is a delicate brown. Dust them with castor sugar and serve either hot or cold. Note.—Place crossbars of pastry over the mixture, if liked. Any stale cake crumbs can be used instead of macaroons. Yorkshire Pudding Ingredients— Batter No. i. One well-rounded tablespoonful of beef dripping. Method.—Put a shallow Yorkshire pudding tin into the oven with the dripping in it. When the tin and dripping are hot, pour in the batter. This makes the pudding lighter than if a cold greased tin is used. Plenty of dripping is required for

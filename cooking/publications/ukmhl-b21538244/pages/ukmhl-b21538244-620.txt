Add more boiling water, if needed. Test if the grains are cooked by eating a few. Directly they are soft, pour the rice into the strainer again. Pour some fresh boiling water over it to rinse it well. Spread the rice on a clean cloth, on a dish or a tin, and put it in the screen in front of the fire, or on the plate rack, to dry.

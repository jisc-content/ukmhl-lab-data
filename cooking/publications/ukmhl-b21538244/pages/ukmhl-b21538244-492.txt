Savoury Eggs Ingredients— Six hard-boiled eggs. One level tablespoonful of butter. Two rounded tablespoonfuls of chopped cooked chicken. Two teaspoonfuls of chopped parsley. One teaspoonful of chopped chutney. {Illustrated ) Half a level teaspoonful of curry paste. One tablespoonful of cream. Salt. Three tablespoonfuls of boiled curry rice. Two slices of bread an inch thick. Method.—Boil the eggs for twenty minutes. Shell them at once and cut each egg in half roundways. Take out the yolks without breaking the cups of the whites. Keep the latter hot. Rub the yolks, butter, and curry paste through a wire sieve, or gravy strainer. Mix in the chicken, chutney, parsley, cream, and seasoning. Heat the mixture gently and heap it up quickly in the cups of the white. Have the bread trimmed to fit the dish, one round being much smaller than the other. Put the larger one in the dish, the smaller one on the top of it. Arrange a ring of eggs on the lower ring and the remainder on the upper one, so as to form a pyramid of eggs. Shake round a border of hot boiled rice, prepared as for a curry, and serve. Note.—Any meat, game, or fish can be used instead of chicken. These are also excellent cold. Scotch Eggs Ingredien ts— Four hard-boiled eggs. One raw egg. Four raw pork sausages. Frying fat. Breadcrumbs. Salt and pepper. Method.—Boil the eggs twenty minutes. Remove the skins from the sausages and season the mixture with salt and pepper. Shell the eggs, roll each in flour, then coat it with a quarter of the sausage meat, keeping the shape of the egg as much as possible. Beat up the egg, brush the coated eggs with it, and cover them with crumbs. Fry them slowly a golden brown in hot fat. Drain them on paper, then with a sharp knife cut each egg across in half. Serve each either hot or cold on a neat round of fried bread.

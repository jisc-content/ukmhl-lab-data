212 THE COMPLETE COOK Loin Chops en Papillotes Proceed exactly as for Cutlets, but be careful to trim off all but a thin rim of fat, and allow five or more extra minutes for the baking. Grilled Mutton or Lamb Chops Proceed as for Grilled Steak, using neatly trimmed loin or neck chops. The former will, of course, take a longer time to cook than the latter, which are smaller and thinner. Loin chops will take about ten to fifteen minutes. Serve as directed for the steak. A little cutlet frill may be placed round the end of the bones in the neck chops. Haricot Mutton Proceed as for Stewed Steak, but use a pound and a half of best end or middle of the neck of mutton cut into neat chops. Probably about an hour will be sufficient to make the chops tender. Hot-Pot Ingredients— Two pounds of neck chops. Four sheep’s kidneys. Two pounds of potatoes. One tablespoonful of butter. Half a pound of onions. Stock or water to half fill the pot. Half a pound of mushrooms. Seasoning (a red chilli, if liked). Method.—Wash the chops, trim off any superfluous fat and save it for clarifying. Peel the potatoes, cut them in slices about an inch thick. Wash, stalk, and peel the mushrooms. Peel and slice the onions as thinly as possible. Skin, halve, and core the kidneys. Put a layer of onion in the special hot- pot dish sold for the purpose, then the other ingredients in layers until the dish is full, ending with one of potatoes. Pour in the well-seasoned stock. Put tiny bits of butter here and there on the top. Cover the dish with a piece of thick greased paper, and stand the pot in a moderately hot oven for about three hours. For the last hour remove the paper in order that the potatoes may brown. Send to table in the hot-pot with a clean table napkin neatly pinned round it. Note.—If a veritable “pepper-pot” is required, use one or more red chillies. A dozen sauce oysters are sometimes added to this dish and greatly improve it. The mushrooms and kidneys can be left out for a plainer dish.

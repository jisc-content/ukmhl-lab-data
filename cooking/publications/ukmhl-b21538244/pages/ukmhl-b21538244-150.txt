THE COMPLETE COOK Ii8 Curries are always popular in hot weather, strange though it may seem. Never use any tinned foods if a bulge outwards is noticed in the tin, a dent is of no consequence. Never use butter for greasing cake tins unless it is clarified, as the salt it contains causes it to make the mixture stick and burn easily. Monday is not a good day for marketing, for unless large first-class firms are dealt with there is danger of being supplied with the surplus stock from Saturday. Never place meat, fish, pastry, etc., right on the ice: put it on a plate or baking sheet and fix that on the ice. The cold will penetrate sufficiently, and the food does not become sodden. Remove meat at once from any paper it may be packed in, as the latter will absorb the juices: for the same reason never permit it to lie on a wooden board. Frozen fish may be sufficiently thawed by laying it in cold water for a short while.

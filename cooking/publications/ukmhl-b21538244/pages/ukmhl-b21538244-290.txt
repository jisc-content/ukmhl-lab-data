248 THE COMPLETE COOK Roast Haunch of Venison Ingredients— A haunch of venison. Beef dripping. Flour. About four tablespoonfuls of butter. Water. Method.—When the meat has been sufficiently hung, wipe it well with a clean cloth, trim off any rough pieces, and brush the haunch well over with some warmed dripping: then roll it up in a well-greased paper. Make a stiff paste of flour and cold water, roll it out about three-quarters of an inch thick, and cover the venison all over with it. Over this tie another piece of greased paper. These precautions are necessary to preserve the fat from burning or being overcooked before the lean is roasted. If a large haunch of buck venison, roast or bake it for about four to five hours, one of doe venison will take usually about three to three and three-quarter hours. Baste the joint well during cooking. About half an hour before the cooking is completed, remove the papers and paste, dredge the meat lightly with flour, and baste it well with butter. Then serve the haunch on a hot dish, fasten a paper frill round the knuckle bone, and serve it as quickly as possible, as venison fat cools very quickly. Good brown gravy, red currant, cranberry, or rowan jelly should accompany this dish. Note.—If the covering of paste is not used the venison will require a shorter time to roast.

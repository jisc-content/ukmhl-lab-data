For the large cake, tie a thick band of paper round outside the tin, as well as the usual inner layers. If the oven is liable to burn cakes underneath, put a shabby pastry or meringue board under the tin. About seven to eight hours will be needed to bake one cake, made of the whole quantity. If liked very dark, caramel can be added with the brandy.

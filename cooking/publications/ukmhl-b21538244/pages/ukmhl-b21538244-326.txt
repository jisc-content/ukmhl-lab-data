28o THE COMPLETE COOK Salsify or Oyster Plant Fritters Ingredients— One pound of salsify. Lemon juice. Two tablespoonfuls of dripping. Batter No. 2 or 3. One tablespoonful of grated cheese. Frying fat. A little oil and vinegar. Method.—Wash and scrape the salsify and lay it in cold water. Have a pan of hot water on the fire, add to it the dripping, a tablespoonful of lemon juice, and one of salt. When the water boils put in the salsify, and with the lid half off the pan let it simmer gently for about half an hour, or until it is tender. Drain off the water and cut the salsify into pieces about two and a half inches long, sprinkle them with a few drops of oil and vinegar and a dust of pepper. Have the frying batter ready and the pan of hot fat. Dip each piece of salsify into the batter, lower it gently into the faintly smoking fat, and fry the fritters a golden brown. Drain them on paper, sprinkle with cheese, and serve at once. Savoys, Boiled Follow exactly the directions given for Boiled Cabbage. Scarlet Runners, Boiled Ingredients and method exactly the same as for French Beans, but sometimes they require somewhat longer boiling. Method.—Trim off all the stump except just enough to hold the stem together. Wash each piece most carefully, as it often harbours much grit and even worms. Tie several pieces together in small bunches with tape. Lay them in boiling salted water and boil quickly for about twenty to thirty minutes. Try with a skewer to see if the pieces are tender. Lift them out of the water carefully, drain well, untie the bunches, and serve in a hot dish, with a sauce tureen of melted butter or white sauce, some of which can be poured over if liked. Note.—Seakale is excellent cold, sprinkled with a little tarragon vinegar and a tureen of slightly whipped and seasoned cream, or Mayonnaise sauce handed with it. Seakale, Boiled Ingredients— One pound of seakale. Boiling water. Salt. Melted butter.

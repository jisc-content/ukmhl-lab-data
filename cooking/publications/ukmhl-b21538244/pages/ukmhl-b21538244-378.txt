THE COMPLETE COOK 328 Method.—Mix all the dry ingredients together in a basin, strain on to them the lemon juice, the wine, and brandy, and mix all well together. Put the mixture into clean dry jars and cover them securely with parchment paper. Norwich Puddings Proceed as directed for Lemon Castles, but add two table- spoonfuls of cleaned currants or sultanas, French Pancakes Ingredients— Two eggs. A breakfastcupful of milk. Two rounded tablespoonfuls of flour. Two rounded tablespoonfuls of castor sugar. Method.—Beat the butter and sugar to a soft cream. Beat the eggs until frothy and stir them in. Beat well. Add the flour and salt lightly, then the milk gradually. Butter some small circular tins or old saucers. Half fill them with the mixture and bake them in a quick oven for about ten to fifteen minutes, or until lightly browned and set. Have ready a thickly sugared piece of paper on the table and some stoneless jam heated. Turn the pancakes brown side downwards on to the sugar, put about a teaspoonful of jam on one half, fold the other half over like a jam turnover, and serve them im- mediately. Remarks on Pastry Puff pastry, when skilfully made, is light and tender, and so delicate that it cannot be touched without crushing. It should be thoroughly baked, and is therefore suitable for tarts and patties and the upper crust of pies. It is no more injurious than the ordinary pastry seen on many tables, as it contains no more shortening than much of the pastry made with a “guess measure” of lard. It is not so much the amount of fat the pastry contains that makes it indigestible, as the inferior quality of the fat (such as rancid butter or impure lard), or the sodden, greasy, half-cooked paste. Pastry that is light, dry, and flaky, is more easily separated by the gastric fluids than that which is heavy. Many house- keepers use lard in making pastry, as it is cheaper than butter, Two rounded tablespoonfuls of butter. Jam. A few grains of salt.

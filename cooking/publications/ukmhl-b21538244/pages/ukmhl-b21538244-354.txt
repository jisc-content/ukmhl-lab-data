THE COMPLETE COOK 304 Gooseberry Amber Pudding is made in the same way, using about a pound of the fruit, which must be first washed and “ topped and tailed.” If these are very hard, a spoonful or so of water may be necessary. Should the purde be too juicy, add a few cake crumbs. Leave out the lemon rind and cinnamon. Apricot Amber Pudding The same as Apple Amber. Use about a pound of fruit; un- ripe apricots are excellent. Stone them before stewing. Add a few shredded almonds or kernels from the stones to the pulp. Amber Pudding from Dried Fruits Make it the same as Apple Amber, but soak the pound of dried apples, figs, apricots, etc., overnight, and stew them in a little of the same water till soft. Sieve them, add butter, etc. Baked Apples Two or three tablespoonfuls of Demerara sugar. Water. Method.—Peel and core the apples. Put them in a pie dish, fill the centres with sugar and lemon rind mixed together, pour in enough water to cover the bottom of the dish. Bake the apples in a moderate oven until they are soft, but not broken, basting them frequently with the juice. Serve them on a clean dish with a little castor sugar sprinkled on them. Note.—If preferred, a clove may be placed in each, instead of the lemon rind, and merely prick the apples once or twice, and do not peel or core them. Ingredients— Six sour apples. The rind of a lemon. Dutch Apple Cake Ingredients— Two breakfastcupfuls of flour. One breakfastcupful of milk. One teacupful of butter. Two level teaspoonfuls of cream of tartar.

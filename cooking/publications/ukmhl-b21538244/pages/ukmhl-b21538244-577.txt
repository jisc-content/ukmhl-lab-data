CHAPTER XXVIII 503 CAKE ICINGS How TO Ice Cakes Cut the top of the cake level, grate off any overbaked parts, and brush off all crumbs. Turn the cake over so that the bottom part becomes the top. Put the cake on a cake stand, a movable one, if possible, or a large dinner plate turned upside down. Divide the Almond Paste into three. Roll out one-third into a round that is just a very little smaller than the top of the cake; lay it on the cake and lightly roll it out until it fits the top. Make the rest of the paste in a strip as nearly the depth and circumference of the cake as possible. The thickness of the paste varies according to taste. If a large cake, it is easier to make two or three strips for the sides, smoothing them neatly together on the cake. Keep the upper edge of the cake sharp and straight, also the sides flat, not curving outwards. Let this almond icing dry overnight, as otherwise it is apt to discolour the white icing. Have the Royal Icing made, and spread a thin layer of it all over the top and sides of the cake. Use a wide bladed knife and keep turning the cake round. Now and then the knife should be dipped in very hot water,â€”this helps to smooth the icing, but it must not be made very wet. Let this first layer dry in a warm place. Put on a second layer of Royal Icing when the first is hard. Let the second be about a quarter of an inch thick, more or less, according to taste. This layer needs to be put on very evenly and smoothly, free from ridges, and great pains should be taken to have the upper edge sharp and straight, not rounded. Let the second layer remain until next day if possible, and then pour over the Boiled Icing. This last is not always used, but it gives a very superior finish to the cake. This sets quickly; the cake is then ready to be marked out in some design for piping. Slightly pressing down with fancy tin cutters is one way of marking the design; or pricking round a paper pattern; or very lightly tracing it on the sugar

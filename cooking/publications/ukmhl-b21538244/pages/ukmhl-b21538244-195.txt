FISH 163 on paper and shake over the rest of the cheese. Serve the fritters as quickly as possible, as they deteriorate every minute after they leave the fat. Note.—The cheese can be left out if disliked. Pieces of kipper can be used instead of bloaters. Cod’s Head and Shoulders Steamed Ingredients—- A cod’s head and shoulders. Salt. Half a lemon. Half a pint of oyster sauce. Method.—Wash and dry the head, remove the eyes. Rub the fish over inside with a little salt and the cut lemon, about two hours before cooking it. This will improve its flavour. Put the fish into a steamer and cover it over with a piece of greased paper. Steam it steadily for about thirty to forty-five minutes, or until the flesh can be easily separated from the bone. Lift it out carefully on to a hot dish, with a heated fish-napkin under it. Garnish it with cut lemon and serve the sauce in a separate tureen. Cooked in this manner, the fish will lose neither nutriment nor flavour. Note.—If there is not a steamer available, place a large pie dish upside down in a fish kettle, or oval boiler, lay the fish on it, cover it with paper, and pour down by the side of the pie dish enough boiling water to come barely half-way up the dish. It must not touch the fish. Any other fish can be steamed in this manner, and it will be found a far superior method of cooking it to boiling. The time must vary with the thickness and variety of fish. Cod’s Roe with Anchovy Sauce Ingredients— One cod’s roe. Salt : pepper : butter. Half a pint of anchovy sauce. Method.—Wash the roe, if the skin is broken tie it up in a piece of fine muslin. Boil it in salted water for twenty-five minutes. Let it become nearly cold, then peel off the outer skin and cut the roe in thick slices. Butter a fireproof oval dish, lay in the roe. Pour the sauce over and place the dish in the oven till the sauce and fish are thoroughly hot. Send to table in the fireproof dish. Note.—Any other suitable sauce for fish can be used.

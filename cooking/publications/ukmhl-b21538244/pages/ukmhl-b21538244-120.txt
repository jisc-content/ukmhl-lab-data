88 THE COMPLETE COOK frequently till the water has evaporated and they appear dry. Add a nice lump of butter or dripping, some salt and pepper, beat them well with a fork, and serve as a dish of mashed potatoes. Custard Curdled From being allowed to boil. Remedy.—For a custard made with a pint of milk, mix two level tablespoonfuls of cornflour smoothly with a little cold water or milk. Strain the curdled mixture on to this cornflour, mixing it smoothly. Stir this over the fire till it boils and thickens. Whisk in one extra beaten egg if possible, re-heat it for a minute or two and add sugar and vanilla to taste. Mayonnaise Sauce Curdled Through heat or the oil having been added too quickly. Remedy.—Put an extra raw yolk of an egg into a basin, add the curdled sauce to this yolk, drop by drop, stirring it well all the time with a wooden spoon. A Discoloured White Soup or Sauce Through using a dirty or badly lined pan or spoon, or through slightly browning the flour when mixing it with the butter. Remedy.—Add a drop or two of caramel to colour it a pretty brown; or colour it a delicate green with a little spinach juice or green vegetable colouring ; or if neither of these colours is permissible add one or two raw beaten yolks of eggs to make it a pale yellow. The name may require altering to agree with the changed colour. Overboiled Fish Result—A broken, unsightly mass. Remedy—Remove all skin and bones, breaking the fish into as large flakes as possible. Put this flaked fish into the fish sauce that was prepared for the boiled fish ; heat it without breaking it; season it carefully and turn the mixture on to a hot dish. Place crofitons or sippets of toast round as a border; sprinkle across a few lines of chopped parsley and serve as fricasseed fish.

426 THE COMPLETE COOK Rum Omelet Proceed as for a Sweet Omelet, but use no jam. After rolling it over and shaping the mixture, turn it on to a hot dish, dust it well with castor sugar, and pour round it half a glass of warmed rum. Set this on fire and pour the flaming spirit over the omelet as long as it will blaze, and serve it at once. Savoury Ingredients— Three eggs. One rounded tablespoonful of butter. One tablespoonful of cream or milk. One teaspoonful of chopped parsley. Omelet A few sprigs of tarragon and chervil. A small pinch of powdered sweet herbs. A small half teaspoonful of grated onion. Salt: pepper. Method.—Season the pan to make sure the mixture will not stick. To do this, heat the pan with a tiny scrap of butter in it, rub it well over and then off with a piece of soft paper. Beat the eggs until slightly frothy, add the cream, chopped parsley, tarragon, chervil, herbs, onion, and seasoning. Heat the butter in the pan until it has nearly ceased bubbling and is gaining the faintest tinge of brown. Pour in all the egg mixture ; keep the pan over a quick fire. As soon as the under part of the mixture sets, raise it up with the flat of the knife or fork and let some of the unset mixture flow under. Continue this until all the egg is very lightly set. Tip the pan up towards you. Shape the creamy mixture with a fork or knife into a bolster-like cushion against the side. Cook it for a moment, and then with a dexterous twist of wrist, pan, and knife roll the omelet over on to the other side and cook the upper surface. Turn out immediately on to a hot dish and serve at once. Note.— Leave out the tarragon and chervil if it is not procurable. Sweet Ingredients— Three eggs. One level tablespoonful each of castor sugar and butter. Half a teaspoonful of vanilla. Omelet About one tablespoonful of heated stoneless jam. A few grains of salt. Method.—Season the omelet pan as directed for the Savoury Omelet. Beat the eggs together, add the salt, sugar, and vanilla.

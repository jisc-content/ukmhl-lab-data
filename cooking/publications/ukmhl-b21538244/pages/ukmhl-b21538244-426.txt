THE COMPLETE COOK 364 Note.—Any other pretty decoration can be used for the mould, or if more convenient the cream may be poured into an undecorated mould, but the effect is less good. Small creams set in dariole moulds are made in the same manner. Fig Cream or Mould {Illustrated') Ingredmits— One gill of milk. Three tablespoonfuls of castor One gill of cream. sugar. Five sheets of French gelatine. Three yolks of eggs or two whole Eight dried figs. ones. One teaspoonful of lemon juice. Method.—Examine the figs and stew them with the sugar until perfectly soft in just enough water to cover them. Should they seem inclined to stick before they are soft, add a tiny drop more water. When soft, cut them up in small dice. Beat the yolks of eggs with the milk, strain this custard into a jug, and stand it in a pan of boiling water ; stir until it thickens, taking care it does not boil. Add this to the figs, etc.; add the cream whipped until it will hang on the whisk, also the lemon juice. Strain in the gelatine dissolved in two tablespoon- fuls of water, after cooling it a little. Mix well, and just as it is beginning to set pour the mixture into a mould rinsed with cold water. When cold and set turn it out carefully. Note.—If preferred, use half a pint of milk and no cream, and call it Fig Mould. Flavoured Creams Ingredients— One pint of cream. Vanilla or any other flavouring to Three level tablespoonfuls of taste. castor sugar. Wafers. Cochineal. Method.—Whip the cream until it will only just hang on the whisk, then very lightly stir into it the sugar and flavouring. Put half the cream into another basin and colour it a delicate pink with a few drops of cochineal. Heap the two coloured creams up roughly, blending the colours prettily, either in little ice tubs or on small glass plates, and serve with them ice wafers. Note.—If liked, a macaroon slightly soaked with sherry, or a small spoonful of fresh fruit may be placed in each ice tub, and the cream heaped on it.

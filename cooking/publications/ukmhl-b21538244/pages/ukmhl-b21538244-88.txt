THE COMPLETE COOK 56 4. Sauces that are made too thick or thin or badly seasoned are spoilt. Therefore—i. Add hot liquids slowly. 2. Stir sauces continually till they boil. 3. Boil sauces thoroughly. 4. Pay careful attention to the consistency and flavour of all sauces. The Principles of Making Batters 1. Correct beating introduces air into the mixture, and air expands with heat. 2. Starch grains swell and soften in cold liquids. Therefore—i. Beat batters carefully till the surface is well covered with bubbles. 2. Allow batters to stand for an hour or so before cooking. The Principles of Bread Making 1. The yeast plant grows, if acted upon by warmth and moisture. 2. Great heat or cold or rough usage kills the yeast plant. 3. During the growth of the yeast plant it throws off carbonic acid gas. 4. This gas in its endeavours to escape from the dough, and with its expansion, caused by the heat of the oven, raises the dough, making it light and porous. 5. If the gas is permitted to escape before baking, the dough sinks and the bread is heavy and sour. Therefore—i and 2. Avoid great heat or cold for the yeast plant, and do not overcream it. 3, 4, and 5. Do not overprove the dough and bake it in a quick oven to expand the gas it contains and to kill the yeast plant. The Principles of Making Pastry 1. Heat, heavy handling, and rolling, make heavy pastry. 2. The ebullition of any description of fat, mixed with the flour, raises and lightens it. 3. Baking powder when moistened throws off carbonic acid gas, which raises the flour in its endeavours to escape from it. 4. If this gas is permitted to escape before the pastry is cooked, its action is lost and the pastry will be heavy.

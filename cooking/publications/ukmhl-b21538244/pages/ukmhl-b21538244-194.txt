i63 THE COMPLETE COOK To Skin Fish For haddocks, whiting, and fish of a similar shape, cut a thin narrow strip off down the backbone, taking off the back fins and also those on the underside. Loosen the skin round the head and bony part of the gills, take the skin between the thumb and finger and pull it off towards the tail. Repeat this on the other side as well. Dipping the fingers in salt will pre- vent them from slipping. For soles and other flat fish, except plaice, the skin on each side is raised just by the tail, the little finger pushed in under the skin right along the fins, the raised piece of skin by the tail seized in the thumb and finger and pulled off towards the head. This is repeated on the other side also. In plaice the skin adheres so tightly that it can only be removed by cutting it off gradually with a sharp knife, working from the tail to the head. To Grill Bloaters Ingredients—• Bloaters. Pepper. Butter or dripping. Method.—Trim them neatly, split the fish open and pull out the backbones with the fingers. Heat and grease the gridiron, lay on the fish and grill them before a sharp clear fire for about six to eight minutes. Serve them on a hot dish, rubbing each over with a little butter and adding a dust of pepper. Note.—These can be most successfully cooked by toasting them on a toasting fork or hanging the fish in a Dutch oven. Bloater Fritters Ingredients— Two bloaters. Frying Batter No. 2. Two tablespoonfuls of grated Frying fat. cheese. Pepper. Method.—Split the bloaters open and remove skin, backbone, and as many other bones as possible. Divide each half fish into three or four pieces, according to the size of the fillets. Mix three parts of the cheese with the frying batter. Season the fish with a light dust of pepper, and dip each piece separately into the batter, see it is well coated. Fry the fritters in plenty of fat, so hot that a faint smoke is rising from it, until they are a light brown. Drain them when cooked

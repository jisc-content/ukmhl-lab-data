47 SHORT MARKETING HINTS small and smooth, the animal is young; if rough and deeply cut, the animal is old. The haunch is considered the prime roasting joint. Hajns.—Select a short, thick ham, rather than a long one. If it is cut, note that the fat is free from a yellowish tint and not coarse, also that the lean is springy to the touch and not over red, for if it is, it is liable to be hard. As all meat becomes tainted near the bone first, push a clean skewer close against it, and on pulling it out it should have no unpleasant or rancid smell, nor should it appear greasy or have soft particles of fat sticking to it. If these signs are observed, it shows the curing is faulty. Bacon.—The rind should be thin, smooth, and elastic, the lean a deep pink and adhering closely to the bones. The fat of a pinkish white, free from the least sign of yellow streaks or patches. A gammon may have the skewer test applied in the same way as a ham. Fish Rules applicable to all Varieties The eyes should be bright and full, the gills a clear, bright red. The body stiff, with the flesh firm and elastic. The colours and markings should be clear and bright. The smell should be fresh and not unpleasant. The girth of the fish should be large in comparison to its length. Very large fish will probably be old and tough. If a “cut” of fish is bought, avoid that having a loose, fibrous, or watery texture, the grain should be fine and close. All shell-fish should weigh heavily in comparison to their size. Special Points in Certain Varieties Cod should have large head ; thick shoulders ; small tail; clear, silvery, bronze hue of skin ; liver white. Salmon.—Small head and tail; thick shoulders; silvery scales; flesh, a bright, rich, yellowish red. Skate should be creamy, white, thick, and broad. Mackerel.—Pearly white underneath; markings very dis- tinct and bright; it must be very fresh when eaten, or is not wholesome.

THE PRINCIPLES OF COOKING 59 Therefore—i. Use cold liquids for pulse and dried vegetable soups, and boiling for fresh vegetable. 2. Add fat of some description to the soup, as vegetables are deficient in fat. 3. Boil soups slowly. The Principles of Roasting or Baking Meat 1. If the juices are permitted to escape when cooking meat, it becomes tasteless and loses much of its nutriment. 2. Hardening the outside albumen of meat by sharp heat forms a coating over the surface and keeps in the juices. 3. Basting meat prevents it becoming dry and shrivelled. Therefore—i. and 2. Expose meat to great heat for the first ten minutes. 3. Baste meat frequently. The Principles of Grilling 1. A dull slow fire fails to harden the outside albumen of the meat or fish, etc., the result being the food becomes dry and hard owing to the evaporation of its juices. 2. A smoky fire imparts an unpleasant flavour to grilled food. 3. Coarse inferior parts of meat become tough and dry if cooked by the process of grilling, owing to the rapid cooking. 4. Perforation of the meat, etc., permits the escape of the juices, thus their flavour and nutriment are lost. 5. The application of heat to only one side of meat, etc., permits the escape of its juices on the other. Therefore—i. and 2. Make up a good fire some time before it is required, in order that it may be sharp and clear. 3. Select small choice juicy pieces of meat, etc. 4. Never stick a fork or skewer into the lean of meat, etc., in order to turn it, but into the fat or skin. 5. Turn the food to be grilled frequently. The Principles of Meat Soups 1. The larger the surface of meat exposed to cold water, the more easily and completely will the juices be extracted. 2. Cold water extracts, boiling water hardens the albumen and keeps in the juices of meat. 3. Bones require fast boiling to extract the nutriment they contain.

The density of the smoke and the speed with which the bread colours, shows whether or not a great degree of heat has been attained. Baking—Place a sheet of white paper, or a little flour on the oven shelf. If it at once turns black it is too hot for anything. If in about three minutes it turns dark brown, it is correct for bread and puff pastry. If in about three minutes it turns light brown, for fruit pies and small cakes. If in about three minutes it turns dark yellow, for large pies and cakes. If in about three minutes it turns light yellow, for sponge- cakes, gingerbread, milk puddings.

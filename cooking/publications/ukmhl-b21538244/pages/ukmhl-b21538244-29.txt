7 KITCHEN UTENSILS drawbacks are that they are expensive and so thin that the cooking is very rapid, thus they are hardly so useful in cases where slow cooking is essential. Block Tin Goods are suitable for fish kettles, light kettles, and for use for oil and spirit lamp cookery, but the very cheap tin ware is not worth buying, as frequently a spout or handle will drop off the first time of using. A Steamer, fitted with several compartments over one boiling pot, is most useful and economical, notably where the top space on a stove is limited. A Bain-Marie is really invaluable, especially in families, such as a medical man’s, where some member of it is liable to be unpunctual. The pans of food are kept hot in a shallow pan about 6 or 8 inches deep, which is filled with boiling water; this prevents the contents of the smaller pans boiling or becoming dry. A Mincing Machine will save much time and give better and more professional results when cold meat, etc., has to be chopped for entrAs and suchlike. Fireproof Ware, in the form of casseroles, au gratm and soufflA dishes, are now ’argely used in every up-to-date kitchen, and are invaluable. They are so ornamented that the food is not only cooked but served in them, so there is no loss of heat, a most important point.

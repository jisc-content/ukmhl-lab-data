THE COMPLETE COOK 240 Method.—Cut the fowl straight down through the backbone, but not through the breast. Wipe it with a damp cloth. Season it well inside and out with salt and pepper. Open it out quite flat like a book and keep it in place with two skewers. Brush it all over with the melted butter and sprinkle it with the chopped parsley and onion. Grill it before, or over, a clear fire for about twenty minutes, turn it frequently, and just before it is done, sprinkle over it a few brown crumbs. Remove the skewers and serve it very hot, with tomato or any other piquant sauce. Note.—Pigeons, pheasants, partridges, and grouse may all be treated in this manner with excellent results. Boiled Turkey Proceed as for Boiled Fowl, but it will require considerably longer cooking. Allow fifteen minutes to each pound the bird weighs. It is usual to stuff turkeys either with a veal, sausage, or oyster farce. Devilled Legs Ingredients— The legs of a cooked turkey. One rounded tablespoonful of butter. One teaspoonful each of French and English made mustard. Method.—Chop off the ends of the “ drumsticks,” gash each across several times. Brush them over with the melted butter. Mix together the mustards, peppers, salt, and chutney, then spread this mixture over the legs. Sprinkle them with a few crumbs and grill them over a clear sharp fire till they are crisp and well browned. Serve them on a hot dish with a few tiny bits of butter placed here and there. Note.—If preferred, the chutney and French mustard may be omitted, merely using pepper and ordinary mustard. of Turkey One teaspo’onful of chutney. Salt: cayenne and black pepper. A few browned crumbs.

HOW TO 105 Rub Purges, etc., through Sieves Put under, a basin or plate that the sieve will just fit over, and select a wooden spoon that is neither too large nor small to hold comfortably. Put the shallow top of the sieve upper- most, and put some of the mixture to be sieved on it, do not attempt too much at a time. Grasp the spoon sufficiently high up for the first and second fingers of the right hand to be almost inside the bowl of it, this enables the proper pressure to be used. Give heavy long strokes of the spoon, drawing it towards you. Add more of the mixture as required. Much of the thicker portion sieved will remain suspended underneath; it is best to stop every now and then and scrape it from under the sieve with a clean iron spoon, it then needs less force to rub the fresh mixture through. Prepare a Meringue Board A board made specially for this purpose should be about three to four inches thick ; it resembles a very thick pastry board. The latter can be used if a meringue board is not procurable, but as it is thinner there is less to protect the underside of the meringues from the heat of the oven shelf. Brush over the board on one side very lightly with salad oil. Cover this side with one or more sheets of foolscap paper according to the size of the board. Lightly oil this paper also, being most careful to use as little oil as possible. Should the paper be difficult to keep quite flat, fasten it down with drawing or ordinary pins. It is then ready for the meringue mixture to be forced on for baking.

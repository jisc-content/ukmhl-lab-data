THE COMPLETE COOK 472 diet is still mainly milk, and no meat should usually be given till two years of age. The Proportions in zvhich to Mix the Food For the first few months, to each tablespoonful of boiled milk add two tablespoonfuls of boiled water and half a tea- spoonful of sugar-of-milk. This is quite inexpensive, and much better for infants than cane sugar. If not obtainable, add fine white sugar. Gradually lessen the water till at three months give equal parts of milk and water, and at six months two parts of milk to one of water. The food must be freshly mixed for every bottle, not re-warmed. The Bottles Use plain boat-shaped glass bottles with short indiarubber teats and no long tubing. Keep them perfectly clean. Wash them in warm water containing a little soda. Keep them when not in use and the teats, the latter turned inside out, in a basin of water with a little carbonate of soda in it. Be sure and rinse them well before using. An extra bottle or two and some teats should always be in the house ; but in case of an accident, the teat can be fixed on to a clean medicine or oval soda-water bottle. The Milk must be perfectly fresh, and it is best boiled, unless the dairy it is obtained from is above suspicion, because: 1. Often it is more digestible, though it will have lost a certain proportion of its nutriment. 2. There is less risk of disease being conveyed by it. Milk that is not absolutely fresh may cause very serious illness and even death to infants. Keep milk in perfectly clean jugs or basins covered with muslin or perforated paper. Never let it stand in the can or near sinks, drains, or strong-smelling foods. Condensed Milk though valuable at times, should never be given for too long a period, as it contains too much sugar and too little cream. Babies fed on it grow very fat, but would soon develop tendencies to rickets. The best brand of milk in the market must be used. Should infants be unable to digest cowâ€™s milk with water.

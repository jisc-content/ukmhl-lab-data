194 CHAPTER X MEAT To Roast or Bake Meat of all Kinds The Fire.—Build up a good fire in ample time before the joint is to be put down to roast, as it is essential that it be sharp and clear. A smoky, dull, or dying fire is useless to roast in front of, or to heat the oven. Judge by the size of the joint whether a very large fire will be required or not. If it has to be remade during the roasting, push the red coal to the front and put on the fresh at the back. Time to be Allowed.—The variety of meat, its shape, and proportions of bone, lean and fat must all be taken into consideration. Weigh the joint, then consider the above mentioned points. For legs of mutton, shoulders of mutton, loins of mutton, saddle of mutton, sirloin of beef, ribs of beef, allow a quarter of an hour for each pound the joint weighs and one extra quarter of an hour, e.g. a leg of mutton weighing eight pounds will take two hours and a quarter. For joints of lamb, veal, and pork, having a fair proportion of flesh and bone, allow twenty minutes to each pound the joint weighs, and one extra twenty minutes, e.g. a leg of pork weighing five pounds will take two hours. For thick solid joints without bone, or if boned and stuffed, such as fillet of veal, topside of beef, rolled and stuffed shoulder or loin of mutton, allow twenty-five minutes to each pound, and twenty-five minutes extra for the veal, and in the case of the two latter, twenty minutes to each pound, and an extra twenty minutes. Some exceptions— Freshly killed meat will always require more time to cook it than will well hung. In hot weather less time is usually needed.

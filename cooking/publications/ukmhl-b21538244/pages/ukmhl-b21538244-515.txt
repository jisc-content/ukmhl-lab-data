445 INVALID COOKERY put them in a shallow pan with boiling water to come half-way up them, lay a piece of buttered paper over the top, and steam them very gently for about fifteen minutes or until they are lightly set. Unless they are cooked very gently, they will be full of holes. Turn them carefully on to a hot dish and serve at once with bread and butter. Small Fish Ingredients— Four rounded tablespoonfuls of any cooked fish. One rounded tablespoonful of fresh breadcrumbs. One egg. One slightly rounded tablespoon- ful of butter. Moulds Four tablespoonfuls of milk. One teaspoonful of chopped parsley. One gill of parsley sauce. Salt and pepper. Method.—Remove all skin and bone from the fish. Put it in a mortar and pound it well with the crumbs, parsley, warmed butter, beaten egg, milk, and seasoning. Well butter some small dariole moulds. Fill them half full of the mixture. Cover the top with greased paper and steam them gently for about half an hour, or until the mixture feels firm when pressed in the centre. Then turn them carefully on to a hot dish and pour the parsley sauce over and round them. Note.—Any other sauce can be used. It is a wise plan to let the moulds stand for a minute after taking them out of the water. The mixture shrinks from the sides of the tin and they are easier to turn out. Oyster Sandwiches Ingredien ts— Four oysters. Salt: pepper. Slices of thin brown or white Half a lemon. bread and butter. Method.—Strain the lemon juice into a cup. Beard the oysters and lay them in it, while the bread and butter is being cut. Stamp the bread and butter into rounds the size of the top of a claret glass. Place an oyster on a round, dust it with salt and pepper, press a second round over the oyster, pressing the edges neatly together. Serve them on a lace paper. Note.—These are most nourishing and digestible. In some cases it would be advisable to halve the oysters and cut smaller rounds of bread and butter, just the size for one mouthful.

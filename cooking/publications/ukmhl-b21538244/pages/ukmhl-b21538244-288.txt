Serve each bird on a slice of toast; arrange them on a hot dish ; garnish with washed and seasoned cress. Serve with them quarters of lemon and good gravy. Follow the directions given for the ingredients and method for Roast Snipe. Add a little port wine, or claret, and lemon juice to the gravy which is to accompany them. Roast Teal Follow the directions given for Roast Wild Duck, allowing about twenty to thirty minutes for the roasting. Method.—Trim off the feet, remove the gizzards, and truss them in shape all on one long skewer, pushing it in, so as to secure the bacon over the breast of each, and also keep the birds in a compact shape. Brush them over with warmed butter. Roast them before a sharp clear fire for about ten to twelve minutes, basting them frequently. Put the toast under the birds in the dripping tin to catch the gravy from them. When they are cooked, draw out the skewer ; remove the bacon and place each bird on a piece of toast. Arrange them in a circle on a hot dish garnished with watercress and quarters of lemon. Potato straws may be heaped in the centre. Fried crumbs should be handed separately.

VEGETABLES 279 Method.—Melt the butter in a saucepan, put in the potato, beaten yolk, and cheese, and mix all well together. Season the mixture to taste with salt and pepper and a dust of nutmeg. Shape the mixture in pieces about three inches long, one and a half wide, and a quarter of an inch thick. Mark the top in a lattice pattern with the back of the knife. Brush it over with the other beaten yolk. Put the pieces on a greased baking tin in the oven and bake them a delicate brown. Serve them in a hot dish. Note.—The potato mixture may be flattened out and stamped out into rounds the size of the top of a claret glass, instead of squares, if liked. Potatoes a I’Hollandaise Ingredients— One and a half pounds of new potatoes. Two rounded tablespoonfuls of butter. One yolk of egg. About two tablespoonfuls of thick white sauce.

Put them in a hot vegetable dish and keep them hot. Melt the butter in a saucepan, add the sauce, stir it over the fire until it is hot.

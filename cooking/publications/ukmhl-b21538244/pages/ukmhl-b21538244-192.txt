160 CHAPTER IX FISH Fish, on account of its abundance, cheapness, and wholesome- ness, is invaluable as an article of food. It is less nutritious and less stimulating than meat, and as it contains little fat, particularly the white varieties, it is easily digested. Fish is usually divided into three classes; 1. White fish, e.g. whiting, sole, turbot, cod, etc. 2. Oily fish, eg. salmon, herrings, eels, etc. 3. Shell fish, e.g. oysters, lobster, crabs, etc. White Fish have the fat or oil in the liver only, resulting in the flesh having a particularly white appearance. This class is the most digestible. Oily Fish have the oil distributed throughout the body, all through the flakes of the flesh. This gives it a dark tint, and the fish is much richer and more nutritious than white fish, but far less digestible. Shell Fish are not digestible, owing to the close texture of their flesh. An exception must be made in the case of oysters, for when raw, they are almost self-digesting and most nutritious. Other varieties are popular and harmless to those with normal digestions, providing that the fish is absolutely fresh. Fresh Water Fish should be cleaned as soon as possible—at the waterside many advise—as they soon acquire a rank, muddy flavour. Should

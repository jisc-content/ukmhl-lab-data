INTRODUCTORY. Packed in small compass, the reader will find, it is hoped, in the following pages, a fairly comprehensive guide to every-day economical cookery. Recipes which have been tested and approved are given as plainly and simply as possible. In the preliminary chapters it is explained briefly how and why good cookery and wholesome food preserve health, and often restore it when impaired ; how the natural pleasures of feeding depend on it ; and why wholesome and enjoyable meals are cheaper than the poorly- cooked, monotonous meals still too common in many English homes ; the question being one of selection and cooking rather than cost. They touch also upon the nature and qualities of food in its various forms, and the philosophy of Roasting, Boiling, Frying, Baking, and the several processes of cooking.

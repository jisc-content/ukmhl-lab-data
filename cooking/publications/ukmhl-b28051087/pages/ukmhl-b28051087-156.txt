FOOD EXTRACT.—This is superior to most, if not all other, Meat Extracts, owing to its richness in stimulating and restorative properties. It contains, as shown by analysis, less ash and water, and more sub- stances soluble in alcohol, and more nitrogenous compounds, than the best-known Extracts. VEGETABLE EXTRACT is a pure Extract of Fresh Vegetables. It imparts an agreeable flavour to Soups, Sauces, Stews, Gravies, Meat Jellies, etc., while its stimulating properties are analogous to those of Meat Extracts, making it a valuable addition to all diets, and all but indispensable to Vegetarians. FISH EXTRACT is similar in flavour, and equal in stimulating properties, to ordinary Meat Extracts. FOOD LOZENGES. — For Sportsmen, Excursionists, and others. These Lozenges will be found very supporting in the absence of proper meals. SOUPS. The Company’s Soups are guaranteed to be manufactured from the very best materials, and besides being most palatable, are of high dietetic value. They are divided into two classes, the UnCOllCCIl- trated and the Highly Concentrated. 1.—The Unconcentrated, in ordinary pound tins, requiring, however, the addition of an equal quantity of water.

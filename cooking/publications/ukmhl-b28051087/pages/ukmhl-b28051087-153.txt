AVDERTISEMENTS. 153 ENOCH MORGAN’S SONS’ SAPOLIO CLEANS PAINT, MARBLE, TINWARE; POLISHES BRASS, COPPER, AND ALL METALS. WHAT IS SAPO LIO? It is a solid, handsome cake of scouring soap, which has no equal for all cleaning purposes except the laundry. To use it is to value it. What will Sapolio do ? Why, it will clean paint, make oil-cloths bright, and give the floors, tables and shelves a new appearance. It will tako the grease off the dishes and off the pots and pans. You can scour the knives and forks with it, and make the tin things shine brightly. The wash-basin, the bath-tub, even the greasy kitchen sink, will be as clean as a new pin, if you use Sapolio. One cake will prove all we say. Be a sensible housekeeper and try it. Many articles pre- tend to do the work of Sapolio. They are good after their kind, but—well, JUST TRY SAPOLIO. A small Bowl of Water, a Cake of SAPOLIO, and a Cloth will do more cleaning than a Pail of Water and three Cakes of ordinary Soap. ENOCH MORGAN’S SONS’ COMPANY, 31, SNOW HILL, LONDON, E.C.

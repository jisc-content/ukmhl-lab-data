FOR BOILING, ‘The Best.’ for BAKING, for ROASTING, for GRILLING, for STEWING, for STEAMING, ‘ The Best.’ for FRYING. No Smoke. No Smell. No Fixing. No Flues. No Danger. These Celebrated Stoves are no new thing, untried and unknown ; they have been before the public for many years. The proof that they are highly appreciated by those who use them is found in the Testi- monials we are continually receiving and in the increasing demand for our make. Every Stove is manufactured on the most improved scientific principles with the object of increasing the efficiency and reducing the cost. All the valuable improvements for which our Stoves are noted are secured by letters patent. Eor Roasting they are specially adapted, as the joint is more evenly cooked than it would be with an ordinary range. For Baking Bread, Pastry, etc., there is no method by which this can be done better ; in fact, many ladies have informed us that they prefer our Stoves for Pastry and Bread because the whole arrange- ment is under control, whilst a coal range oven never is—this is the real secret of Bread Baking and of Good Cooking.

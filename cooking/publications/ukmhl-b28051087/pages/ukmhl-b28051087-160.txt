Van Houten’s GUARANTEED PURE AND SOLUBLE. Cocoa is THE BEST and really THE CHEAPESTi n the end. The British Medical Journal says:—‘Van Houtkn’s Cocoa is admirable. In flavour it is perfect, and it is so pure, well prepared, and rich in alkaloid, that it may with great advantage be largely used in public institutions, as well as in private families.’ The Lancet remarks :—... It goes a long way, and is really cheaper to use in the end,’ etc. On account of the great strength of this Cocoa, a cup costs no more than a cup of tea; but being not only a most delicious, but also a highly nutritive beverage, this Cocoa is really much cheaper than tea.

Invaluable in Railway Stations, Hospitals, on hoard, in the Camp, for Workmen (at home and to take to their work), etc., etc. TRY IT ONCE, AND YOU WILL USE IT ALWAYS.

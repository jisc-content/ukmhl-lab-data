H Brilliant Set Blacli polish. The large and increasing demand for this article is the best proof of the opinion of the public as to its merits. The finest possible Polish is produced with the smallest possible quantity—this in itself is the test of its purity. No waste, no dust, no dirt, and may be handled without soiling the fingers. ‘ROYAL PALACE BLUE? Used in Her Majesty’s Laundry. The finest, purest, and best Blue yet made. John Johnson & Co. have the greatest confidence in recommending the ROYAL PALACE BLUE, not only for its magnificent colour, but for its permanency, which, owing to a secret chemical property their mode alone possesses, Linens, Laces, and other Fabrics rinsed in a solution of the Royal Palace Blue will retain intense whiteness for at least six months longer than those that have been rinsed with any other square Blues, or, indeed, with any other Laundry Blue whatever. TESTIMONIAL FROM HER MAJESTY’S LAUNDRESS. To Messrs. John Johnson & Co. Gentlemen,—You may Indeed state it as a fact that since I first began to use your Royal Palace Square Blue, now about eleven years ago, I have not used any other for the finest linens and the most delicate fabrics in Laces, and for the best of all reasons, and that is because articles put away in drawers during her Majesty’s absence are taken out again when required as white and as bright as when put away, which no other Blue I ever tried would produce. —Yours truly, MARGARET BROWN. Royal Laundry, Sept. 20th, 1SS6. ‘^oVePeign’ l^nif e polish Purchasers of Knife Polish arc advised to be particular in asking for the ‘SOVEREIGN’ BRAND, that being tko finest Powder yet made.

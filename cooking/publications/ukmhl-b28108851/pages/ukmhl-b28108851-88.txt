84 Buckmasters Cookery. A bouquet garni. A faggot of herbs, is constantly referred to in cook- ing, and is a mixture of parsley, thyme, and bayleaf, and sometimes marjoram, rosemary, and a clove of garlic; these are tied into a bunch, and are used for seasoning. Wash the parsley, and arrange the other herbs so that they are enclosed within the parsley. The ends of the parsley should be folded over to more effectually enclose the herbs, and then tied round with string. A small handful of parsley, weighing say one ounce, one sixteenth in weight of thyme, the same weight of bay-leaves, the same weight of marjoram, and, if used, one clove only of garlic, constitute an ordinary bouquet garni, or faggot of herbs. Dried herbs. These should always be to hand, and are best pre- pared in the following way: Gather the herbs just before flowering, which is when their flavour is the strongest. Dry them quickly in an over or before a screen, and pick out all the stalks. Gouffe recom- mends the following preparations :â€”quarter ounce of thyme, one-eighth ounce of marjoram, quarter ounce of bay-leaf, one-eighth ounce of rosemary. These are to be pounded in a mortar, with half ounce of nutmeg, quarter ounce of whole pepper, half ounce of cloves, one-eighth ounce of cayenne pepper, and passed through a fine hair sieve, and kept in a dry place in a well-stoppered bottle. In these proportions a good seasoning is secured. The proportion for mixing with salt is one ounce of the mixture with four ounces of dry salt. This mixture is called spiced salt.

Fish. 61 appearances given to them by artifice. The best way is to seize every opportunity for examining fish when fresh caught, this will give you more exact knowledge than anything in cookery books. There is a close analogy between the constituents of fish and meat, but the nutritive value of fish is very inferior; you cannot have the same nourishment from fish as you can from equal weights of mutton or macaroni. Before cooking, all fish should be thoroughly cleaned, but not allowed to soak unnecessarily in water, although some fish require a good time to cleanse, nor should they be ever roughly handled. In preparing fish there is no occasion for cruelty. I once spoke to a cook who was brutal enough to justify his cruelty by saying that the more eels suf- fered the better they tasted; I am sorry to say that this absurd and utterly false impression exists in the minds of many cooks. Fish should be well cooked, but not allowed to remain in the water or fat an instant after they are done. Nothing but the experienced eye of a cook can see when a fish is ready; all directions as to time are more or less fallacious; but to persons who have not had much experience it may be of service to notice when the eyes begin to start, and to use a thin plated skewer as a probe; to test the easy Svtparation of the meat from the bone. The minute any fish is sufficiently boiled raise it, and place the fish strainer across the kettle to drain, and if you have to It eep it a few minutes cover the fish with two or three fo Ids of clean flannel. To let the fish soak in water, or to keep watering it all day in the sun, is the best way to spoil the flavour of fish.

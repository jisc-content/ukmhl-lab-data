Sauces. 203 arise from mixing the whole quantity of butter with the flour at once. If too thin, mix a tablespoonful of flour with half an ounce of cold butter, take the sauce off the fire and â€¢ # allow it to cool for a few minutes, add the mixture of flour and butter, and stir while off the fire. When melted, put the sauce over the fire again till just boil- ing, then add a small piece of butter before serving. The essential condition of success is that the flour and butter should be of the very best, or good melted butter is impossible, no matter what recipe is followed. The butter, unless good and fresh, gives an unpleasant flavour to the sauce. Melted butter is sometimes pre- ferred slightly acid, when a little lemon-juice is stirred into the sauce before serving. All plain sauces should have a simple but decided character, and be served as hot as possible. They should therefore never be made until just before they are wanted. Sauces with liaisons or creams should be well stirred, and never allowed to boil after the liaison or cream is added. The same care must be exercised with lemon-juice, pickles, and other acid mixtures. For sauces use clean stewpans, those of enamel or porcelain are the best, and stir always with a wooden spoon.

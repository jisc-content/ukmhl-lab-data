5i The Function of Food. It is very important that every poor woman should know how to spend her money on what is really worth the money, and to make what she purchases go as far as possible by good cooking. I want them to know that from vegetables alone a wholesome, economic, and nourishing diet may often be prepared, and that flesh meat is greatly overrated as food. Why are haricot beans, peas, lentils, oatmeal, macaroni, Indian meal, milk, and rice, not more used ? It is because people are ignorant of the value of these foods, and the art of making them savoury by cooking has yet to be learnt. As a rule, children, not only of the poorer classes, but of the middle classes, are often underfed, and many of their ailments arise from a debility of constitution brought about by under or improper feeding; and to give strength, quinine, cod-liver oil, port wine, and stimulants are given instead of good food. The diet of children should be three good meals a day; a breakfast, with cocoa, milk, macaroni, porridge, or eggs; a dinner of meat, vegetables, and pudding; a substantial supper, like the breakfast, with cocoa or milk. This is the dietary of health, a diet capable, with pure air and exercise, of making a strong body and a strong mind, and a diet which will often improve weakly children and protect them against many diseases. There is no period of life when more food is required than in childhood and youth. The hard- working labourer does not exhaust a greater quantity of nutritious food than a strong, healthy, growing boy or girl of twelve years of age. And up to that age they should have the same education.

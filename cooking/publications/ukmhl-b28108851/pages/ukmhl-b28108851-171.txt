Rissoles. 167 baked. If the spice is to hand, this pie is no more trouble, nor does it take more time than an ordinary- veal and ham pie, and is much better. Precautions.—The chief point to be borne in mind is not to have it too highly seasoned, and the meat should be free from gristle and skin. RISSOLES. Ingredients. Minced Meat. Puff Paste. Hot Fat. 1. Make a puff paste. 2. Roll the paste out to the thickness of a penny piece. 3. Place small balls of meat (the same as prepared for croquettes, page 221), and put the balls of meat at distances of two inches from each other. 4. Moisten the paste round these balls of meat with a brush dipped in water. 5. Fold the flap of the front part of the paste over the balls, just as you would fold a sheet of paper lengthwise. 6. Press all round them with the edge of the thumb. 7. Cut them out with a fluted round tin cutter. 8. Place them on a dish sprinkled with flour : having cut out a sufficient number, (9) fry them in a frying basket in hot fat, at 385°, and serve with fried parsley on a napkin. The difference between a croquette and a rissole is this,—the rissole is always fried in a puff paste, the croquette in egg and bread-crumb. Precautions.—Take care to have a good paste and the rissoles neatly made.

Sir Thomas Lawrence used to invite his sitters to dinner that he might better understand the natural expression of their characters. It should be the study of the wife to make the plainest food varied and attractive by cooking, and she has a right to expect in return love from her husband and children, and a kindly interest in all the affairs of the family. STEWS. • Stewing is the basis of what is called made dishes. The roughest and coarsest parts of meat may be made tender by stewing. It is the kind of cooking I would especially recommend to the wives of working men in preference to frying. The perfection of stewing de- pends upon the slow process by which the cooking is accomplished; the temperature should never exceed i8o°. We often fail because we are in too great a hurry; but a stew, like everything else, suffers from being over-done. No rule can be given; everything depends upon the intelligence and judgment of the cook. The lid should be removed as little as possible. An occasional shaking of the stewpan will often save the trouble of stirring. Stewing is the most economical kind of cooking; the flavour and nourish- ment of all the materials are secured; and if the dish be not greasy and highly seasoned, the meat is made tender, savoury, and easy of digestion.

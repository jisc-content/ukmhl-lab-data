Take the oil bottle and place your thumb over the top and let the oil fall in at short intervals, drop by drop, and well mix. The great art is to thoroughly mix the oil before adding more. 3. After adding about forty or fifty drops of oil you may now add it, in quantities of a teaspoonful, till you have used about four ounces alto- gether, which will make about half a pint of sauce. 4. Add by degrees half a tablespoonful of tarragon vinegar, one tablespoonful of good vinegar, and pepper and salt to taste. As a rule this sauce should be well seasoned. If desirable, slightly rub the basin in which the sauce is mixed with an eschalot or garlic. Some think a finely-minced eschalot and parsley are agreeable additions to this sauce, and it is sometimes made without the egg. Precautions.—Gradually and thoroughly stir in the oil till the sauce is of the consistency of cream, and of a pale straw colour. Do not add the vinegar until the egg and oil are well mixed. Tartare Sauce.—Add to half a pint of white mayonnaise sauce, prepared as above, without flavour- ing, one tablespoonful of dry mustard, half an ounce of eschalots or spring onions, and half an ounce of gher- kins, minced finely with one tablespoonful of ravigote (minced chervil, tarragon, and burnet), a tablespoonful of Chili vinegar, and a small pinch of cayenne pepper, mix thoroughly with the white lpayonnuise and it is ready.

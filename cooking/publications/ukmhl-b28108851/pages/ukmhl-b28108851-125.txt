Hashed Mutton. 121 HASHED MUTTON. Ingredients. 2 Eschalots. Cold Mutton. Tomato Sauce. Bouquet garni. I oz. of Butter. Walnut Ketchup. 1. Cut up neatly from a leg of mutton or other joint all the meat in slices of about the same size. 2. Remove all the fat, skin and bone, and every piece which is burned or blackened by the fire, or the hash will have a strong disagreeable flavour. The parts not used for hash may go into the stock-pot. 3. Melt in a quart stewpan one ounce of sweet butter, add two finely minced eschalots and a dessert- spoonful of flour, and stir for five minutes, or till it is brown. 4. Now add two gills of stock, salt if neces- sary, half a teaspoonful of whole pepper, one clove, three allspice, a small bouquet garni, a teaspoonful of walnut ketchup, or half the quantity of Worcester sauce, and a tablespoonful of tomato sauce. 5. Stir continually till the contents come to the boil. 6. Boil five minutes. 7. Strain into another stewpan, and let the sauce cool before adding the meat, or it will harden. 8. When cold lay in the pieces of meat. 9. Place the stewpan over the fire, occasionally shake, but be careful not to let the hash boil. 10. As soon as the meat is sufficiently warmed through, serve with sippets of bread fried in butter or dripping. Precautions.â€”Do not allow any of the fat, tough skin, or gristle to go into the hash, and only let the meat be warmed through in the sauce.

The particles of the tissues change more rapidly in youth, and this pro- bably explains why young meat is more tender than old, and why any excess in youth is more easily cast off. The principal daily requirements of the body are the repair of tissue and the maintenance of tempera- ture. Every vital action produces heat, and these actions must continue throughout life. Where the food is insufficient, and where there has been no storing of fat or nitrogen, the body falls into weakness and disease, and this is the natural tendency of all underfed or improperly-fed people; and with persons imperfectly nourished there is generally a low state of morality. Half the applications for hospitals and dispensaries come from persons who want food, and one cannot fail to be struck with the pale attenu- ated appearance of labourers who are undersized, twisted, and doubled up, and worn out before persons well fed and in comfortable circumstances begin to feel the influence of years. In all our large towns the same thing is observable. The declining physical power of the labouring poor is a matter of regret, and as a natural result opium eating, smoking, and drink- ing are, in many localities, on the increase. Pure air, physical exercise, temperance, and a sufficiency of plain wholesome food are the conditions of health and happiness laid down by a higher authority than a parish vestry. The best offering you can make the poor is to instruct them in the art of cooking, and teach them what constitutes food : and the most fitting memorial of Godâ€™s goodness is the provident and careful use of the blessings which He has provided.

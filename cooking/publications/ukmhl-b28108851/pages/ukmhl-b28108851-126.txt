Buckmaster s Cookery. 12 2 IRISH STEW. Ingredients. A Neck of Mutton. 6 Onions. Potatoes. 1. Take a neck of mutton, trim off most of the fat, and cut into as many cutlets as you have bones; shape them, and sprinkle them with pepper. 2. Peel six moderate-sized onions ; and for every pound of meat take one pound of potatoes. 3. Blanch or parboil (which is the same thing) the vegetables sepa- rately, and cut them into slices. 4. Take a clean three-quart stewpan, and add half a pint of water or stock. 5. Arrange a layer of potatoes at the bottom of the stewpan, then cutlets, then onions; then potatoes, then cutlets, then onions; and finish the top with a good layer of potatoes. A rasher or two of bacon or ham is a valuable addition. 6. Stew very slowly till the cutlets are done. 7. Have sufficient stock or water to prevent the stew from burning. Scrag end, or inferior pieces of meat, or the remains of previously cooked meat, may be used; and if the mutton is not very fat, add a little butter or dripping to the contents of the stewpan. HUNTERâ€™S PIE. Mash the potatoes, arrange the meat and onions in an earthenware pie-dish, same as for Irish stew. The top of the potatoes should be covered with greased paper, or they will bum before the meat is cooked. The top may be glazed with white of egg, or the pie may be baked in a mould. Mashed potatoes make a good pastry for layers of meat.

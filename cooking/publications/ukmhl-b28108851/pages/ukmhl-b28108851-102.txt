After all the meat available for a hash has been cut away from a leg of mutton or other joint, (1) break the bones into pieces; the addition of a pound or two of fresh bones will be desirable. 2.

Add one dessertspoonful of whole pepper and allspice in equal parts, and salt to taste. 5. Set the saucepan on- the fire, and let the contents simmer for four hours. 6. Strain the broth. 7. Remove the fat, and use the stock for any kind of thick soup. 1. Pass through a hair sieve the carrots and one of the onions. 2. Melt an ounce of butter in a three- quart saucepan, and stir in a tablespoonful of flour. 3. When the two are well mixed, (4) add a little of the stock, (5) then the carrot and onion pulp, and gradually the remainder of the stock, or so much of it as will produce a puree of the consistency of pea soup. 6. Pour it boiling hot over small dice of toasted or fried bread. Precautions.â€”Take care that the soup is not too strongly flavoured with the vegetables,

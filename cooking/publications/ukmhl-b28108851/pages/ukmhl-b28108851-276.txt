272 Buckmaster s Cookery. slightly varied from the following recipe, is one of the best examples of good English cooking. 1. Pick, draw, and singe a fowl about three pounds. In singeing use a spirit lamp with alcohol, and be careful not to break the skin or blacken the fowl. All poultry should be carefully singed; it tightens the skin and de- stroys the small down. 2. Some prefer cutting up the fowl, and putting the pieces to soak for an hour in cold water before boiling, but the following method is gene- rally adopted. 3. Put the chicken into a clean three- quart stewpan with sufficient warm water to cover it. 4. Add one onion, with a clove, a little salt, and a bunch of parsley or a small bouqueigarni. 5. Skim when neces- sary. 6. Let it come to the boil, and simmer for ten minutes; remove it to sieve, and drain it for three minutes. With the liquor in which the chicken was boiled prepare a sauce. 7. Add two ounces of butter and two table- spoonfuls of flour, and thoroughly stir. 8. Prepare and blanch for five minutes a dozen mushrooms, in just suf- ficient water to cover them. 9. Add the juice of half a lemon and (10) strain into the sauce and put the mush- rooms aside; be careful that they are not broken. 11. Neatly cut up the fowl into ten pieces, keeping the skin on each piece. 12. Finish cooking the pieces in the sauce,which will take from twenty to twenty-five minutes. 13. Arrange them neatly on a dish. 14. Strain over the sauce and garnish with the mushrooms. Four crayfish make a good garnish, or croutons of bread fried in butter. A little cream is a great improvement to the sauce. Precautions.â€”It is necessary to have a young fowl, and it must not remain in the sauce longer than is necessary.

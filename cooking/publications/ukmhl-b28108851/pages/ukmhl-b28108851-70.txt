Buckmaster s Cookery. 66 bath is first raised to a temperature of 220°, then to 230°, then to 260°, and the time occupied is about three hours : this is a temperature of 48 degrees hotter than boiling water, which is said to be necessary to remove all the air and life germs; every little cell containing air and water is broken-up, and the steam and air escape at the small hole, which is suddenly closed with the soldering iron. The tins are put aside to cool, when the external pressure of the atmosphere often forces the tops into a battered shape and makes them concave. You will understand from this process why preserved meats lose much of their flavour. The steam issuing from the tin may be condensed, wljen it is found to be nothing but water with a slight flavour of the meat. The osmazone upon which the flavour of the meat depends has been separated by the boiling, and while the flavour of the meat is injured, the flavour of the jelly is increased, and we can have this flavour in the soup. If science is to do anything for cooking, there ought to be some method of restoring this flavour of meat, much in the same way as a manufacturer of scents prepares from a few substances the perfumes of new-mown hay, violets, jasmine, and other flowers, without any of them being used in the manufacture. Du Broussin, a celebrated gourmand, used to say, if my cook were not able to prepare any kind of fish to eat like partridges or woodcocks, then he has not learnt the true art of cookery. Another method of preserving meat has been pro- posed, known as the antiseptic process, which consists in the use of sulphurous acid and other chemicals.

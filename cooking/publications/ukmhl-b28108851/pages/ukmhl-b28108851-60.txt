56 Buckmaster1s Cookery. The usual method of frying is the most wasteful kind of cooking, although in most houses it is believed to be economical. A little fat or butter is melted in a frying-pan, and when the frying is finished the fat is so discoloured and burnt as to be of no further use. It is not possible to fiy a moderate sized pair of soles in less than a quarter of a pound of fat. In eight fryings you have used two pounds of fat. Now if you had taken two pounds of fat at first, and slowly melted it in a clean saucepan or stewpan till the fat had risen to the proper temperature you might have fried much better, and your fish would have been of the same colour on both sides, and the fat could have been used for ten or a dozen pair of soles instead of eight. The most economical way of frying is to have plenty of fat, and the quantity can be kept up by daily addi- tions from saucepans, dripping-pans, and fat meats. All kinds of fat, except bacon fat, may be used for frying until it becomes of a dark brown colour ; it must then be clarified by melting with water, or strained into hot water, when all the impurities fall to the bottom, and the fat, when cold, can be removed in a solid state. When the fat has become nearly black from use it has decomposed and lost its frying pro- perties, and will give a bad colour and taste to every- thing fried in it. Different liquids come to a boiling temperature at different degrees of heat. Water boils at 2120, and all the coal in the cellar will never enable you to obtain a higher temperature. Fats and oils require a much higher temperature, from 500° to 650°, before they come to the boiling point, and this is why fat is

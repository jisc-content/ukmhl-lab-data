241 Vegetables. HARICOT BEANS WITH EGGS. Ingredients. Haricot beans. Milk. Parsley. Flour. Eggs. Butter. 1. Soak half a pint of haricot beans all night in plenty of cold water. 2. Pick out all the imperfect ones, and put the rest on to boil in plenty of warm water. 3. As the water boils away add a little more cold. 4. When the beans are cooked (they will take about two hours) strain through a colander. 5. Put four eggs on to boil for ten minutes. 6. Remove the shell from the eggs. 7. Chop up about half a tea- spoonful of parsley fine. 8. Make a white sauce, thus: (a). Put one ounce of butter and half an ounce of flour in a stewpan and mix together over the fire; (b). Add half a pint of milk and boil for one minute, (c). Remove from the fire and stir in the raw yolk of one egg and a little salt. 9. Put the beans into a tureen. 10. Pour the sauce over. 11. Put an egg at each corner and sprinkle a little parsley on each one. All sautes require a brisk fire, so that the meat may obtain a good colour. Care must be taken that the butter does not burn, or the flavour of the dish is spoilt. When once the boiling point has been reached no addition of fuel will enable you to reach a higher temperature. Eggs should always be broken one after the other and smelt, for although the egg may be good, it may have an unpleasant flavour by being packed in damp straw or hay. No good cooking can be done with bad dripping or butter; imelling and tasting are necessary before purchasing butter.

There is often a little difficulty in freezing, which generally arises from the water or cream being too sweet. It will then be necessary to add a little more water or milk. Too much sugar in solution prevents the liquid from freezing. The quantities given in the following recipes are for one pint and a half of ice. For Freezing, see page 300. CHERRY-WATER ICE.

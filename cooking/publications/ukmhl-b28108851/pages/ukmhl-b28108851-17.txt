Early English Food and Cooking. 13 ' was in the reign of Henry VII., when almost every peasant had his pig and cow, with plenty of milk and right of common. Before the Reformation the people of England were celebrated for good living, hospitality, and abundance of food. The roast beef and plum pudding of old England, which are our standard national dishes, are as old as the hills. “For what are your soups and your sauces, Compared to the beef of old England ? And, oh ! the old English roast beef! ” The yeoman and peasant lived on cabbages, fish, cheese, butter, soup, pork, rye bread and milk ; the barons and ecclesiastics on roast beef, venison, game, fish, soups of the most varied kind, and meat bathed in delicious sauces, and wines. Long before France attained any distinction, English cooking was the best cooking in the world. With the Reformation a great change took place. Vegetables, soups, and fish, were regarded as popish food; and the making of soup and the cooking of fish generally fell into disuse and larger quantities of meat occupied their place. We know that “ The monks of Chertsey made good broth * On Fridays when they fasted.” With the breaking up of the monasteries and large establishments, cooks opened inns and hotels and the art of cooking gradually declined ; and in the reign of * There are a large number of recipes for fast-day or vegetable soups in the Liber Cure Cocorum, of about the time of Henry VI.

Roll out two-thirds of the paste to half an inch in thick- ness, with which line the basin. 6. Have ready cut into slices, about the size of the palm of the hand and a quarter of an inch in thickness, two pounds of a rump or beefsteak with a little of the fat included. 7. Lay the pieces upon a dish. 8. Season with two tea- spoonfuls of salt and one of black pepper. 9. Sprinkle a little flour over, move them about a little until each piece is well covered with flour and seasoning. 10. Lay them within the paste, putting in whatever seasoning may remain upon the dish; a dozen oysters, blanched and with beards removed, is an excellent addition. 11. Pour a gill of water over, moisten the edges of the paste. 12. Roll out the remainder of the paste to form a lid, which place over, pressing it down with the thumb. 13. Tie the basin in a pudding- cloth, and put it into a saucepan containing enough boiling water to well cover it. 14. Keep continually boiling for nearly two hours, adding a little more boiling water occasionally to keep up the quantity. 15. Take it up, untie the cloth. 16. Run a sharp pointed skewer into the pudding, and if the meat feels tender, it is done (if not it will require more boiling); turn it over upon your dish, lift the basin carefully from it, and serve. A few mushrooms are an improvement. Precautions.â€”The steak must be tender, or made so with a kreatone (seepage 128), the pudding well boiled, and the basin not too full.

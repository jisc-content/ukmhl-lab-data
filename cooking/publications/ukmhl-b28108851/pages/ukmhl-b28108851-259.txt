Veal a la Bourgeoise. -o:? VEAL A LA BOURGEOISE. Ingredients. 5 lbs. of Veal. Bacon. Bouquet garni. 40 Button Onions. Carrots. 1 pt. of Stock. Clove. Onion. Salt. 1. Take five pounds of fillet of veal and lard it. 2. Put it into a clean stewpan with four ounces of fat bacon cut into inch cubes. 3. Let the veal take a light brown on both sides. 4. Sprinkle with a little salt. 5. Add one onion with one clove stuck into it, and a bouquet garni. 6. When the meat begins to stick slightly to the stewpan, add a pint of stock. 7. Cover the stewpan and let the contents simmer for forty minutes. 8. Prepare thirty or forty button onions and the same number of pieces of carrot cut into pieces the same size and shape as the onions. 9. Remove the onion and bouquet garni, and put in the button onions and carrot. 10. Add, if necessary, a little more stock or hot water. 11. Cover the stew pan, and simmer for thirty or forty minutes longer. 12. Remove the veal carefully on to a hot dish, so as not to break it. 13. Place the vegetables round the veal, and pour the gravy over it. If the gravy is too thin it must be reduced by rapid boiling and stirring. Precautions.â€”The lid of the stewpan should not be removed more than is necessary, and before adding the stock an occasional shake of the stewpan is desir- able. Be very careful the meat does not take too high a colour or burn.

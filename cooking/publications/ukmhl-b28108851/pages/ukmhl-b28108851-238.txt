Toast. 1. Wash the kale and tie it in bundles. 2. Put it into boiling water with a little salt, let it boil quickly for twenty minutes. 3. Drain it, and serve on a toast with melted butter (page 203) or white sauce (page 210). Sea kale is sometimes stewed in good gravy; it must then be boiled for ten minutes in water, and afterwards stewed in gravy for a quarter of an hour. CARROTS. Ingredients. Carrots. Eschalots. Chives. Butter. 1. Scrape clean and wipe, but not wash, fifteen or twenty small young carrots. 2. Put them in a stew- pan with two ounces of butter. 3. Cover the stewpan, and from time to time give it a shake. After fifteen minutes (4) add a little pepper and salt, and some finely minced parsley and chives, or eschalots. 5. Put on the lid, occasionally shake till the carrots are tender. Old carrots should be previously well blanched, and cut into slices, and finished cooking in the sauce. Precautions.—If the carrots are not young they should be nearly cooked before adding to the sauce.

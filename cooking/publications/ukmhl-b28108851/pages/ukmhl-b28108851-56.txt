52 Buckmctster's Cookery. If it be admitted that from the food the body is continually built up and kept in health, how can it be expected if the food be insufficient, or, from its nature, incapable of making healthy blood, that we can have anything but a weak race of men and women always complaining of ill-health ? The stomach has often to work and waste its power on a mass of useless material. Masters of schools and parents should not measure the appetites of children by their own wants. A morbid condition of the skin, ringworm, and debility of constitution in children are often traceable to imper- fect nourishment Where there is an insufficiency of food, or, what is the same thing, improper food, the vital functions go on and the body lives on itself; and this explains in some degree the frequent occurrence of consumption in rapidly growing and ill-fed youths. The intellectual culture and progress of a boy depend very much on physical power. In looking over the advertisements of boarding schools, it is a matter of regret that a plain substantial diet is not always recog- nised. I do not undervalue the importance of light, cleanliness, physical exercise, temperance, and pure air and good water ; but all these are unavailing with- out abundance of wholesome, well-cooked food. As this question is very important, parents should be as particular about the food as they are about the education of their children. Insufficiency of food has given rise to an impression that children are over-worked. Cases of over-pressure in schools may generally be traced to hunger and hereditary weak- ness.

Eggs. There are many varieties of peas. I have met with some called marrowy melters, and these are far the best. 1. Soak a pint of peas for ten hours in rain or soft water—the bad ones float and can be removed. 2. Drain them. 3. Tie them up loosely in a clean cloth, and put them into plenty of cold rain water, peas will never boil soft in hard or salt water. 4. Let them come to the boil. 5. Then simmer till the peas are tender; the time will vary with the kind of peas, but never less than two hours. 6. Drain them over a colander. 7. Pass them through a clean wire sieve. 8. Season the pulp with pepper and salt.' 9. Beat up one or two eggs with an ounce of sweet butter, and stir it into the pulp. 10. Thoroughly mix with a wooden spoon. 11. Have a clean cloth, and tightly tie up the pudding. 12. Let it boil for another half hour. 13. Turn it on to a dish and serve. This is usually served with fat pork, and is a very sensible and nutritious dish for working people. Precautions.—Be careful in the selection of the peas, and be sure that they are soft enough to pulp before turning them out.

Buckmasier s Cookery. 284 Precautions.—Keep the mixture free from the pan while cooking, and do not beat more than just sufficient to thoroughly mix the yolks and whites. FRITTERS. Ingredients.—\ pint of Milk or Water. 4 ozs. of Butter. 5 ozs. of Flour. 2 ozs. of White Sugar. 3 Eggs. A few drops of Flavouring Essence. A very little Salt. 1. Put the milk, butter, sugar, and salt into a stew- pan over the fire. 2. As soon as the contents boil, withdraw the stewpan, and add the flour gradually. 3. Stir the whole well together with a wooden spoon | over the fire until it becomes a thick paste. 4. Add the flavouring and one egg, and mix thoroughly. 5. Add the other 2 eggs, and mix again. 6. Have a sauce- pan three parts full of hot fat. Drop pieces of the paste into the fat about the size of a pigeon’s egg. 7. Turn them about continually in the fat till they are more than double the size: when done they should be hollow balls, about the size of an orange. Dish them up in pyramid shape, and sprinkle castor sugar over them. If preferred the underside can be opened with a knife and a little preserve inserted. The next day they may be served cold for luncheon, cut in half, and the hollow of each filled with whipped cream of two colours. SALADS. Salads are a very simple and harmless luxury, and in summer they make an agreeable addition to our ordi- nary food ; if the vegetables are fresh and eaten with plenty of oil, salads are rarely unwholesome. In this country we are perfect savages in the making of salads.

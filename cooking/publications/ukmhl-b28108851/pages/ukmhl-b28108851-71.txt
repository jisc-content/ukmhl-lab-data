Tinned Meats. 67 The object is to prevent the decomposition of fresh meat by excluding the oxygen of the air. This pro- cess has met with little success, and the meat so preserved tastes strongly of the chemicals, nor is the process a very reliable one. Another plan is known as the concentrated process. About 30 lbs. of meat is reduced to 1 lb., and this is called the essence or extract of meat, and is recom- mended for making beef-tea and soups. Almost every chemist and grocer sells this extract of meat; but we cannot depend on extracts of meat as an article of food any more than we can depend on a teaspoonful of flavoured alcohol for beer and spirits. The stomach requires quantity as well as quality. There is no method of making meat or vegetables more nutritious, in the sense usually understood. If you have one pound of extract and dilute it with thirty pounds of water, you have only one pound of solid matter in solution. You may desiccate vegetables and meat and free them from water, so as to occupy a smaller bulk, and when you have done this you have done all that you can do. What we have to consider is, Can these meats be used as an economic, wholesome article of food, with other things ? None of the nutritive or flesh-forming properties of the meat are lost in tinning, and you have 4 lbs. of solid cooked meat, without bone, which . are equal to at least 6 lbs. of butcherâ€™s meat. The prejudice against preserved meat may be gradually overcome by the middle and upper classes eating it. Several varieties of soup may be prepared from i tinned meat. D 2

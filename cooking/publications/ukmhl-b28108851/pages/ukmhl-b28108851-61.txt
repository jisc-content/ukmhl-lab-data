Frying. 57 used instead of water. If we could obtain the same temperature with water as with fats and oils we could fry as well, or better, in water, because everything fried would be free from any greasy taste. What takes place when a drop of water or sprig of parsley falls into hot fat ? If the temperature of the fat is not more than 212° no visible effect takes place, but if the temperature be above 2120 the water is con- verted into steam and explodes. The higher the temperature the more violent and rapid the explosion; and if any considerable quantity of water were thrown into hot fat it would be dangerous, because the fat would be thrown all over the kitchen. . From several experiments made in the Cookery School I am en- abled to give the following temperatures (Fahrenheit) for frying:— Soles . . . . . 380° Rissoles . • 385° Croquettes . - • 385° Cutlets • 3S5° Fritters • - • • 385° Potato chips •' 385° Whitebait 400° When anything is egged and bread-crumbed and fried in hot fat, the thing fried is not in contact with the fat, because the albumen is at once solidified, and forms a covering through which the fat never pene- trates. The temperature of the fat slightly varies according to the nature of the things fried, and as we use a thermometer to determine the temperature of our

On Whipping Eggs and Cream. 293 Precautions. â€” The most careful cleanliness is essential to success. Earthenware or copper moulds should be used. The jelly should not be stirred after it begins to boil. A little melted isinglass is some- times added at No. 25, which gives firmness to the jelly in hot weather. ON WHIPPING EGGS AND CREAM. Whipping the whites of eggs requires more care and attention than almost any other operation. It appears very simple, but often fails from the non-observance of a few simple rules. 1. See that the basin and whisk are perfectly clean, cold, and dry. 2. In break- ing the eggs (which should be done separately) into a teacup, see that no portion of tire yolk falls into the basin. 3. Be sure the whites are all fresh, smell them before pouring into the basin, one stale white will prevent the rising. 4. Always whip in one direction. If two persons whip the same eggs, one in one direction and the other in the opposite direction, the whites will never rise. 5. Do not stir the eggs while whipping. 6. A cool air is helpful. 7. Do not mix anything with the whites before whipping except a small pinch of salt. 8. The whites of two eggs are better whipped on a plate with a broad knife. In whipping cream the chief things to be observed are : 1. That the cream is fresh. 2. That the basin and whisk are clean, dry, and cold. In hot weather it is a good plan to stand the basin on ice. 3. Always whip one way, and be careful not to stir. 4. Do not mix sugar, flour, or anything with the cream before

Bucbnasters Cookery. 2S6 cucumber, celery, mint, parsley, beetroot, dandelion, tarragon, chervil, sorrel, and tomatoes. On the Con- tinent cold meat, fish, fowl, game, and previously cooked vegetables, are more often served as salads than green uncooked vegetables. Ravigote (p. 206) is sometimes sprinkled over the salad. Above all things be particular with the sauces and jellies, meat or fish, served as part of the salad. Chervil must be used in small quantities. Nasturtium leaves and flowers, and other suitable flowers, with boiled beet-root may be used to ornament salads. I should like to see prizes given at vegetable and flower shows for the best salads. MACEDOINE SALAD. Ingredients. French Beans. Green Peas. Mayonaise Sauce, Carrots. Celery. Beet-root. Turnips.

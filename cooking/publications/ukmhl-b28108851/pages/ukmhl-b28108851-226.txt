Beat up an egg, adding a teaspoonful of oil and a teaspoonful of water. 2. Well roll each croquette in flour, then the egg mixture, and then in dried bread crumbs. 3. Cover thoroughly and put them aside on a dish. They are now ready for the frying-basket, and should be fried to a golden-brown colour in fat, at a temperature of from 380° to 390° All cro- quettes are made the same way. Garnish with fried parsley. These were some of the methods adopted in the Cookery School for cooking Australian meat, but the recipes are numerous. Precautions.—Do not attempt to form the croquettes till the material is firm enough to shape. Fry in a frying-basket. In the preparation of Australian beef and mutton, the most important thing is the preparation of some sauce by which the meat is disguised and made savoury. A number of dishes beside Australian meat depend entirely for their success upon the sauce ; the meat is simply to give a body to the dish, and the body of such a dish may be, and often is, very mysterious, but the flavour delicate and refined. In this way the gristle of meat, the tough legs of fowls, and pieces regarded as inferior, may be made delicious by skilful arrangement. All previously cooked meat, and especially preserved meat, require not cooking but judiciously warming. In tinned meats you always have a strong jelly, which can be made the basis of a number of sauces.

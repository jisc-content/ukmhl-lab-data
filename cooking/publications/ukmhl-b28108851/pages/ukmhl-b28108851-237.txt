Vegetables. 2 33 Precautions.—Be careful the butter is sweet, and not of too brown a colour. COLCANNON Ingredients. Potatoes. Green Vegetables. 1. Boil potatoes and greens or spinach separately, in equal quantities. 2. Mash the potatoes. 3. Squeeze the greens dry. 4. Chop them quite fine. 5. Mix all together in a basin, with a little butter, pepper, and salt. 6. Put the whole into a mould, previously well buttered with a brush. 7. Let it stand in a hot oven for ten minutes, and then turn out. Precautions. — Let the vegetables be free from water, and the mould properly buttered, or the col- cannon will break on turning out. ASPARAGUS. Ingredients. Asparagus. Vinegar. 1. Scrape the sticks of the asparagus, wash them, and cut them into equal lengths. 2. Divide the sticks into bundles of ten or twelve, tie them together, and stand them in salted boiling water with a dessert- spoonful of vinegar. Take care not to over-cook— about fifteen or twenty minutes will be sufficient—or the heads, which are the most delicate part, will break off in the saucepan. When sufficiently cooked, re- move them carefully and serve on buttered toast.

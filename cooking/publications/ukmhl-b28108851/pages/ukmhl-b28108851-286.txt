282 Buckmasters Cookery. A PLAIN OMELETTE WITH HERBS, Ingredients.—3 Eggs. Pepper and Salt. Parsley. Butter. 1. Break three eggs separately into a cup and pour them into a basin. 2. Add a small teaspoonful of finely chopped parsley, and a small pinch of pepper and salt. 3. Whisk the mixture for fifteen seconds. 4. Melt three-quarters of an ounce of butter in a frying- pan without browning. When it is in a state of froth (5) give the mixture two or three whisks, and pour into the centre of the pan. 6. Stir very slightly till the mixture begins to thicken. 7. Give the pan an occasional shake to keep the mixture free, or strike the handle of the pan with the left hand, so as to produce a gentle vibration. As soon as the mixture is suffi- ciently firm, fold half the omelette neatly over into an oval shape. When of a golden colour turn it on to a hot dish, and serve immediately. Precautions.—The frying-pan must not be more than six inches in diameter for three eggs, the fire not too fierce, and all care must be taken to prevent the mixture burning. If there is any tendency to burn, a little butter placed under the omelette will generally prevent it. CHEESE OMELETTE. Ingredients.—3 Eggs. Parmesan Cheese. Cayenne. 1. Mix as before, but introduce into the omelette mixture a dessert-spoonful of grated Parmesan cheese. 2. Add a little pepper and salt, and sometimes a few grains of cayenne pepper. 3. Sprinkle the omelette when it is turned out with a little grated cheese. Precautions.—The same as before.

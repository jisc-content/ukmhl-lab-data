Put the blanched vegetables into a stewpan, also the cabbage lettuce and peas, add a iump of sugar and half a pint of the filtered soup. 26. Reduce the soup to a glaze by boiling quickly at first and then gradually slackening the hear. 27. Stir occasionally. 28. When the vege- tables are covered with a glaze add the filtered soup, and let the contents just come to the boil. 29. Stand the stewpan aside to slightly boil for half an hour, and the soup is ready. This soup may be served with the shredded vegetables warmed in a little stock, or it is sometimes served with a savoury custard which is prepared as follows :— 1. Take the yolks of two eggs and the white of one egg and put them in a pint basin, add half a gill of the soup and a saltspoonful of salt. 2. Whisk well to- gether. 3. Butter evenly the inside of a gallipot. 4. Pour the mixture into the gallipot. 5. With the back edge of a knife butter a piece of kitchen paper large enough to cover the gallipot. 6. Tie the buttered paper over the top of the gallipot same as for pre- serve. 7. Take a saucepan of hot water and when it just comes to the boil stand in the gallipot; the water should not touch the paper. 8. Simmer for a quarter of an hour, if it is allowed to boil the custard is spoilt. 9. Remove the gallipot, take off the paper, and turn the custard on to a plate. 10. Cut the custard into diamonds or fancy shapes. 11. Boil up the soup and pour it into a hot tureen. 12. Add the savoury custard to the soup in the tureen, and serve. Precautions.—Be careful not to boil the water in which you cook the custard.

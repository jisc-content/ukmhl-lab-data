Broiling. 73 the flesh of the leg may be tried in the same manner. Cooks attach importance to the “steams drawing to the fire.” When the meat is nearly done, remove the buttered paper, if any has been used, and sprinkle over the meat a little salt, and put the ends of the joint to the fire ; and endeavour to obtain a clear brown colour before the fire. If you wish the meat to be frothed, dredge very lightly a little well-dried flour over the sur- face, and give it time to crisp; do not baste after the flour.

It is an easy method of making a small portion of fish or meat savoury, but it is not the cooking for families. Things broiled should be turned with steak tongs; a fork should on no account be used ; and without a clear, bright fire broiling is impossible. The principle is the same as in roast- ing ; the albumen of the meat or fish is coagulated, which forms a crust, and so retains all the juices. .Delicate appetites are often encouraged with a nice broiled fish. The national beef steak and mirTon chop have made us the best of broilers. There are still a few places in London where you can have a steak or chop cooked to perfection. Two gridirons are best—one for meat, the other for fish. The bars of gridirons are often too large and obstruct much of the heat. The gridiron should be very clean, and if bright when purchased it should be kept so, and always be washed before putting away. Before putting anything on the gridiron let it get thoroughly hot; the reason for this is obvious; much of the heat of the fire is

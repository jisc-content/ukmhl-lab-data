70 Buckmaster s Cookery. an ounce of small cardamoms, quarter of an ounce of Cayenne pepper, quarter of an ounce of cinnamon, quarter of an ounce of cummin seed. Thoroughly pound in a mortar and mix together, and keep in a close stoppered bottle. Another Recipe.â€”Half an ounce of Cayenne, one ounce of mustard, half an ounce of black ground pepper, half an ounce of salt, four ounces of turmeric, four ounces of crushed coriander seed, one ounce of pounded cinnamon, one ounce of ground ginger, two ounces of fenugreek, and a quarter of an ounce of allspice all well mixed. Before proceeding with a curry I would suggest the reading over all the recipes, so as to exercise the in- genuity and intelligence of the cook by joining parts of several recipes. A nice curry is a favourite and economical dish, and not difficult of preparation. Our relations with India made curries popular before the failure of the potato, and the greater necessity for using rice had made this kind of cookery more general. All kinds of food may be dressed as a curry. The important thing, as already mentioned, is to have a good stock, and the art consists in seasoning so as to suit the taste of those for whom the curry is pre- pared. The Indian cook adapts his seasoning to the particular dish and the taste of his master, a thing not always considered in English cooking.

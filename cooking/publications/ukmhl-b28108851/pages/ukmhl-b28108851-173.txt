Take half-a-dozen eggs, separate the yolks, and put them aside. 2. Whisk the whites to a stiff froth, with a tablespoonful of powdered lump-sugar. 1. Take one quart of milk, sweeten it to taste, and bring it nearly to the boil. 2. Take two dessert-spoons and shape the white of the egg and drop them one by one on to the milk, which should now be on the point of boiling without boiling; when the eggs are set on one side, turn them over ; a few seconds will be sufficient. 3. Take them out and drain on a sieve. When the egg froth is used up (1) strain the milk into a stewpan; let it get cold. 2. Mix gradually with it the yolks of the half dozen eggs with a little vanilla or lemon, or any flavouring you like. 3. Put the stewpan containing the milk and the yolks of eggs into a saucepan of hot Avater, rising about two-thirds the height of the inner vessel, and keep stirring over the fire till the custard thickens. This is in fact a bain-marie, like a carpen- ter’s glue pot. 4. Pile up the eggs on a dish, and as soon as you observe small lumps on the side of the stewpan containing the custard, remove it instantly

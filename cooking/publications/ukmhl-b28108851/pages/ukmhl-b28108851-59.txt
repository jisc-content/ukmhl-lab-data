FRYING. “Fish must swim twice—once in the water and once in the fat.” “Fried sole.;—you know, served with little kickshaws.” / There are two methods of frying : the dry method, as when we fry an omelette or a pancake ; and the wet method, as when the thing fried is immersed in fat. For dry frying we generally use a frying-pan; for wet frying a frying-kettle. As a bath for frying purposes we generally use fat. The light-coloured dripping of roast beef and the fat skimmed off broth are to be preferred. The next best fat for frying is beef suet, chopped fine and melted down over a slow fire without browning. Lard is the fat generally used for frying; but it is liable to leave an unpleasant flavour. When you can see the bottom of the stewpan through the liquid fat it is sufficiently melted. Let it cool for a few minutes, and strained through a pointed strainer. The reason for allowing the fat to cool a little is to prevent its melting the strainer. When butter is used greater care is required, because it rises rapidly in temperature and requires a slow fire. Oil requires even more care: it should be warmed for half an hour over a slow fire so as to prevent any rapid rise in temperature, and boiling over.

ON THE PREPARATION OF OMELETTES. ABRIDGMENT OF LECTURE DELIVERED BEFORE HER MAJESTY, AT THE SCHOOL OF COOKERY, MAY, 1873. May it please your Majesty :— The specimen of cooking which is now to be pre- sented takes only five minutes, and is within the reach of almost the poorest of your Majesty’s subjects. The materials cost fourpence, and they furnish a savoury and nourishing dish. An omelette is seldom properly cooked even in France, which gives it its name. It is never found in the homes of the poor in this country, and in the houses of the rich it is often very badly prepared. There is no occasion for an omelette pan and spoon. A clean frying-pan and spoon will answer perfectly well. And we endeavour to show in this school not only the best and the most economic methods of domestic cooking, but the various uses to which kitchen utensils may be fairly applied without injury. To make simple food wholesome and palatable by cooking was a duty imposed on man from the very earliest period of his civilization. An abundant supply of food, and its proper preparation by cooking, are matters intimately connected with the physical well- being and happiness of your Majesty’s subjects, and from a long and close connection with the working classes, through their schools, clubs, and institutes, I may be permitted to say, that the interest which your Majesty has shown in this School of Popular Cookery will be very valuable and gratefully appreciated by all classes of your Majesty’s subjects.

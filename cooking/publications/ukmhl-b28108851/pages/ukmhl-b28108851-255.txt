Braised Fillets of Beef. 2 51 bouquet garni, (parsley, thyme, bayleaf and, if liked, a sprig of marjoram, an eschalot, a clove of garlic). 8. Scrape and clean two young carrots and split them in halves. 9. Peel an onion and wash a quarter of a stick of celery. 10. Put all these vegetables into the saute pan. 11. Add some good stock but not enough to come over the fillets. 12. Baste the fillets con- tinually. 13. Cut a piece of paper the size of the saute pan and butter it. 14. When the stock comes to the boil lay the paper neatly on the fillets to prevent the too rapid browning of the meat. 15. Remove the paper and baste frequently, returning the paper each time. 16. Place the saute pan in a hot oven for half an hour to brown the meat. 17. Re- move the meat and reduce the stock 18. When in the oven remove the paper and occasionally baste. 19. Remove the fillets from the saute pan, arrange them on a hot dish on a circle or oval of mashed potatoes. Keep the dish hot and, if necessary, reduce quickly the sauce to what is called half a glaze. Strain the sauce over the meat and fill up the centre with mixed vegetables, green peas, French beans, carrots and turnips cut into small dice. Precautions.â€”Have the fillets all the same thick- ness. Be careful not to allow the stock to boil over the fillets; the stock should be very good and not too highly flavoured. This should be considered in the use of herbs and vegetables. It is sometimes neces- sary to brown the fillets with a salamander.

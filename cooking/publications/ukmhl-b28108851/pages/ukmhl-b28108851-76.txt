It is therefore quite clear that boiling, especially when the liquor is turned into broth, as it should be, is the most economic kind of cooking. When meat is boiled, much of the albu- men remains in the water, and when flavoured with vegetables and herbs, and thickened with meal, you have a highly nutritious soup, much used in every country except our own.

142 Buckmaster s Cookery. ) TO BOIL MACARONI. Ingredients. I lb. of Macaroni. 1 Onion. 1 Clove, x oz. of Butter. 1 teaspoonful of Salt. There are several kinds of macaroni, but whatever the name or kind, it is all manufactured from the same raw material or paste, and whatever dish you wish to prepare, the cooking must always be the same. It should never be soaked in water before boiling. The proper way is to break it into convenient lengths, wipe it with a clean cloth, and plunge it into plenty of boil- ing water with a teaspoonful of salt; an onion with one clove stuck in it, and one ounce of butter. The length of time it will take to cook will be from twelve to twenty-five minutes, according to its age; newly prepared macaroni does not take more than ten or fifteen minutes. Keep it boiling, try it now and then with the thumb and finger, and as soon as it yields easily immediately stop the boiling by adding a pint of cold water which should be in readiness; then drain over a colander, and the macaroni is ready.

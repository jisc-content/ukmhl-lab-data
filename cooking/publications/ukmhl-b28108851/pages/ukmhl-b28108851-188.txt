184 Buckmastcr's Cookery. FILLETED SOLES. Soles and other flat fish are sometimes filleted, that is, the flesh is removed from the bones. To fillet a sole, wash it and remove the black skin, scrape or skin the other side; lay the sole flat on a board, and with a sharp kitchen knife make one cut from the head to the tail, along, and down to the backbone, now hold the knife obliquely (the ribs forming a guide for the knife), ease the fillet gently with the left-hand and cut from the backbone to the fins, and in two cuts the fillet may be removed; but this requires a little practice to do neatly and quickly; one sole gives four fillets. Thick firm soles are best for filleting. The head, fins, and bones may be put into a stewpari and simmered for stock, which is useful in many fish sauces. FILLETS OF SOLES A LA MAIL RE D’HOTEL.

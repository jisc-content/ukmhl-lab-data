Remove the gristle from the lean, and pare away the meat and skin from the inside of the bone; this is to give the cutlets the requisite shape. 9. Sprinkle the cutlets on each side with two pinches of salt and one small pinch of pepper. 10. Oil them slightly. 11. Make them into shape with the flat side of a knife. 12.

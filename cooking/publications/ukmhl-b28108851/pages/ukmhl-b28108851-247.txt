Take a young rabbit properly prepared for cook- ing, and cut it into pieces the size for carving. 2 Wash each piece of rabbit separately in cold water, and change the water if necessary. 3. Remove the pieces on to a sieve to drain.. 4. Melt in a clean stewpan three ounces of sweet butter without burning or browning. 5. Take two small onions, peel them and chop them up finely. 6. Fry the onions to a pale brown in the butter with constant stirring. 7. Take a slice and carefully remove the onions on to a piece of kitchen paper to absorb the fat, or they may be strained from the butter, in which case return the butter to the stewpan. 8. Put the pieces of rabbit into the stewpan and let them brown, turning them occasionally so as to take colour on both sides; this will take, over a brisk fire, about ten minutes, and requires constant attention. 9. Take an apple, peel it, core it, chop it up finely, and put it aside. 10. When the rabbit is sufficiently fried, add two dessertspoonfuls of good curry powder, half a teaspoonful of salt, and stir for five minutes so as to thoroughly mix. 11. Add the onions, the apple, and a pint of good stock, free from fat. 12. Cover the stewpan and stand it aside for the contents to simmer slowly for two hours, with an occa- sional shake. 13. Stir in gradually a gill of good cream. 14. Squeeze in the juice of a lemon through

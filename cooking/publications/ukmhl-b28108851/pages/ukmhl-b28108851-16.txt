Biukmasters Cookery. 12 monks of St. Swithin, we find, made a formal com- plaint to the king that the abbot had ordered the withdrawal of three out of the fourteen courses usually served at dinner. Fourteen courses at dinner show a very advanced cooking. The clergy, both regular and secular, kept excellent tables, and were given to hospitality—no one was turned from the door without a meal. A Venetian gentleman who visited England in 1500, says, “The English are great epicures, and by nature very avaricious; they indulge in the most delicate fare themselves, but give their household broth, coarse bread and beer, and cold baked meat, which, however, they allow them in great abundance.” The monks of Canterbury, except on special days and seasons set apart by the church, had seventeen courses daily, besides dessert, dressed with all sorts of flavours and sauces which pleased the taste. The entertain- ments given to the poor by the nobles and prelates at Christmas, Easter, and Whitsuntide, diffused a taste and desire among all classes for good living. It would perhaps be a good thing if the poor and the noble met more frequently at the same table, for men do not proceed from rude habits of life except by con- tact with a higher civilization. The barons imitated what they had seen in the palace, and the yeomen and humbler classes, so far as they were able, imitated the example of the barons. Then, as now, only in a more powerful degree, the aristocracy influenced the life and habits of other classes, but the rapid develop- ment of a moneyocrac.y has broken the chain, and I doubt if the food of the agricultural labourer in Buck- inghamshire is so abundant or so well cooked as it

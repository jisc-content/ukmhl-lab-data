Buckmasier's Cookery. 58 rooms, so we ought to use a thermometer much more in cooking. We can never raise cooking to a science until we have more exact language and methods. Too high a temperature must in all cases be avoided, and this temperature is indicated by the smoke rising from the kettle. The different degrees of heat are generally determined by throwing into the fat a small sprig of parsley, or a drop or two of water, or a piece of bread the size of a small nut; if ebullition is produced at once, and large bubbles rise to the surface, the fat has reached a temperature known in the kitchen as hot fat. For warm fat the bread should only give rise to small bubbles with scarcely any fizzing. If too many things are put into the frying-basket they will be badly fried, because the temperature of the fat will fall below the point necessary for proper frying. The most successful frying is when the tem- perature rises four or five degrees during the frying. Fried things should be of a golden-brown colour, crisp, and free from fat. The surface fat is removed by placing the things fried on kitchen paper as they are taken from the kettle. Use your fat first for frying delicate things such as rissoles, fritters, croquettes, and vegetables, and never fry anything but fish in fat after it has been once used for fish. Fresh fat must now be taken for rissoles, and used up for fish. This involves two lots of frying-fat, which is the most economical plan to adopt. The fat when not in use should be kept in clean glazed earthenware jars or white basins. If we had a thermometer protected by a cage or basket, and the words Rissoles, Croquettes, and so on,

Early English Food and Cooking. 15 practised as an art, if it had ever been taught as a necessary part of a woman’s education, it would never have fallen to its present condition, nor would we have, as is now too often the case, a girl engaged as a plain cook incapable of boiling a potatoe, or toasting a slice of bread. In a disputed will case, one of the witnesses kept saying he knew the testator was a man of sound mind, and that he led a godly and pious life. The judge asked, “ What do you mean by a man leading a godly and pious life ? ” “ Please your lordship, he spent most of his time and money in teaching the poor to make cheap soup.” It would be a good thing if all who lead, or who think they lead a godly and pious life, were able “ both by precept and by example,” to teach the poor how properly to perform the common duties of life. The difference between new bread and stale bread in a family, is one loaf in five. The objects in cooking food are— 1st. To make it softer, so that it may be more easily masti- cated and digested. 2nd. To destroy life-germs, and make it more pleasant to the taste. Warm food is more digestible than cold food. Children and old, feeble persons require warm food more than strong adults, Tea is a most expensive substitute for food. Never take tea without something to eat. Home-made bread keeps fresh longer than bakers’ bread, and is more economical and wholesome. Ten pounds of flour will produce from 13 to 14 lbs of bread. The reprehensible practice of using alum is to enable the flour to absorb more water, and make the bread weigh heavier. Alum deteriorates the bread and injures the stomach.

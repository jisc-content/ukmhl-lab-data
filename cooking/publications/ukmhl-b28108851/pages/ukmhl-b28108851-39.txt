I shall be met with the oft-repeated objection that there is no time for these things; but how many dreary hours are occupied over the piano, how large a portion of time is swallowed up with this accomplishment; and, when we consider its practical value on the after- life of a girl, is it worth the time and money bestowed upon it? I do not say you are not to learn the piano, but what I do say is, that your whole force of thought is not to be exhausted on it. It would not take a tithe of the time to learn how to make a fricassee of chicken or to fry a pair of soles in hot fat, as it does to learn a sonata which may be easily forgotten; cookery once learnt is never forgotten.

Making pastry, preserving fruit, pickling, making ketcup, cultivating, gathering, drying, and compounding herbs, are elegant, healthful occupations.

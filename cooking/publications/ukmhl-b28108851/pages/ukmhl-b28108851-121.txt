117 Soups. MACARONI AND VERMICELLI SOUP. TO MAKE TWO QUARTS. Ingredients. 3 oz. of Vermicelli. Parmesan Cheese. Stock. 1. Take four ounces of vermicelli and blanch foi five minutes in boiling water with a little salt. 2. Drain in a colander. 3. When cold plunge it into four pints of boiling stock. 4. Skim. 5. Simmer gently for ten minutes, with frequent stirring, and it is ready. Rice, tapioca, sago, and all macaroni soups are prepared in the same way. When macaroni proper is used, it should be wiped with a clean cloth, boiled, and cut into one-inch lengths before adding to the boiling stock. Some boil the vermicelli or maca- roni or pastes separately in boiling stock or water, drain, and put into the tureen, and pour over the boiling stock. Vermicelli and all pastes for soups are varieties of macaroni, and should be of the best quality. A plate of grated Parmesan cheese should be served with these soups. Precautions.—Be careful to have the vermicelli done, but not too soft by over boiling. TAPIOCA SOUP. Ingredients. Stock. Tapioca. 1. Take three tablespoonfuls of tapioca to every quart of stock. 2. When it boils shake in the tapioca, stirring it continually with a wooden spoon. 3. Boil a quarter of an hour, and serve. Precautions.—Stir when adding the tapioca, which should be crushed fine before using.

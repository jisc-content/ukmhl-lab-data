Fish. 201 • BAKED SPRATS. Ingredients. Herbs. 2 lbs. of Sprats. \ lb. of Bread Crumbs. * 1. Mix in a basin a teaspoonful of fine herbs with a little pepper and salt, and half a pound of bread crumbs. 2. Rub the sprats in a clean coarse cloth to remove the scales. 3. Strew over a tin dish some ol the mixed bread crumbs. 4. Arrange on these n layer of sprats, but not to cover each other. 5. Sprinkle the sprats with the mixed bread crumbs, and so on for three layers of sprats. 6. Finish with a good layer of the bread crumbs. 7. Put on the top a few pieces of butter the size of a nut, and place the dish into an oven for twenty or thirty minutes. This is a cheap, excellent dish. Precautions.—The sprats should be fresh and carefully wiped, but not washed. Cleanliness is an essential condition of all cooking. The kitchen may be small, dark, and badly arranged, but it should be kept clean. Many a dinner has been spoilt by a dirty spoon or a dirty saucepan, and failure in cooking is often attributable to want of cleanliness. In washing cooking utensils the water should be changed as soon as it becomes greasy, or the thing washed is made dirtier. The brightness of the outside of a saucepan is a poor apology for the dirt inside. I once took down six bright shining stewpans before I could find one fit for melted butter. Kitchen utensils should be frequently examined, especially those made of copper; as soon as the copper begins to show inside they should be re-tinned, a badly tinned stewpan will give a bad colour to everything cooked in it, especially sauces and jellies.

Beef & la Mode. 141 1. Take five pounds of thick flank of beef, and two slices of fat bacon half an inch in thickness. 2. Remove the rind, and cut the bacon into strips of half an inch ; this will give you pieces half an inch in section. 3. Sprinkle the strips of bacon with pepper. 4. Tie up the beef and lard it in the direction of its grain. 5. Place it in a stewpan, with two quarts of stock, the rind of bacon, and two calf’s feet, all previously blanched, and the feet boned. Proceed exactly as for the pot au feu, add a tea- spoonful of salt. 6. Let it come gradually to the boil, and skim. 7. Add four small carrots, one onion with three cloves stuck in it, a bouquet garni with a clove of garlic, and a little pepper. 8. Close the stewpan tightly, and simmer slowly for four hours. 9. When the beef is done take it out, with the calf’s feet and carrots, and put them aside to keep hot. 10. Remove all the fat. 11. Strain the liquor through a pointed strainer into another stewpan. 12. Reduce over a brisk fire for half an hour. 13. Remove the string, place the beef on a dish, and garnish with carrots and calf’s feet. 14. Pour over the reduced liquor, and serve. If required cold, put it into a basin, or earthenware mould, with the calf’s feet, vegetables, and liquor, which will gelatinize into a solid mass. When cold it can be turned on to a dish. In summer the vegetables soon turn sour. Precautions.—The gravy should be thick and gelatinous, and slow cooking is necessary for success. Be sure to skim the gravy when you are reducing it.

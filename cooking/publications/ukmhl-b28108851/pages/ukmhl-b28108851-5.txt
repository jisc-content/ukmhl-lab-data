NEW EDITION, CAREFULLY REVISED. “The number of inhabitants which may be supported in any country, upon its internal produce, depends as much upon the state of the Art of Cookery as upon that of Agriculture. . . . but if Cookery be of so much importance, it certainly deserves to be studied with the greatest care. . . . Cookery and Agriculture are arts of civilized nations ; savages understand neither of tliem.”^- Count Rum fono. LONDON GEORGE ROUTLEDGE AND SONS Broadway, Ludgate Hill NEW YORK; 9 LAFAYETTE PLACE

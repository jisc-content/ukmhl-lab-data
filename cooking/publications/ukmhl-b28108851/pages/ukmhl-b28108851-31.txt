On Stock Soups and Pot an Feu. 27 books fast-day soup; it is, however, generally thick- ened and improved by the addition of yolk of egg, cream, tapioca, sago, oatmeal, milk or butter, or some of these either separately or mixed. A meat soup may be regarded as a decoction in water of gelatine, osmazome, and the flavouring of the materials used in its preparation. No house should be without a little stock ; it is the foundation of all meat soups, sauces, and pure'es. It is to a cook what oil is to an oil painter; it is the life and soul of all domestic cooking, and has its origin in the French pot au feu. In preparing a stock the object is to extract from the materials the best broth, and for this purpose we should have a saucepan or stock-pot of tinned iron ; this is the cheapest and best, because it can be easily cleaned, and without a clean stock-pot or saucepan both the flavour and quality of the stock are injured. In France a glazed earthenware pipkin is often used, and there is no reason why something of the kind should not be used in this country. A grey earthenware jar which will stand the fire, with a suit- able lid, is a better looking utensil in a poor manâ€™s house than a saucepan. It can be easily kept clean, and retains the heat longer.

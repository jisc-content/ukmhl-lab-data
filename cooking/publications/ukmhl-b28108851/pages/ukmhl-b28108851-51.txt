47 Mistresses and Servants. If there is any tendency to vulgarity in the style or colour of the mistressâ€™s dress or bonnet, any large display of electro-plated jewellery, these will be exag- gerated by less educated persons. Teach your servants good taste in dress, not by tracts, and sermons, and ill-natured words, but the more powerful example of a meek and quiet spirit; and a mistress ought to feel rather complimented than angry when her example is followed by others. The love of ornament is no doubt instinctive in a woman, and those who have had a better education should guide and direct it among those who have not had the same opportunities. If your servant wants a brooch and deserves one, give her one on her birthday. A clean, neatly dressed, cheerful servant, is a perpetual charm in every house- hold. The only certain method of making good servants, is to make those dependent on you respect and love you. They cannot be made by fear to fulfil your wishes, but love and respect will command anything. The subject may appear too homely and common-place to require consideration; it is however, in the present day, one of importance. We are all in some sense servants one of another; the rich are as dependent on the poor as the poor are on the rich. There is a mutual servitude and a mutual obligation in every condition of life, and there is no sense in assuming high looks, and thinking and acting otherwise. The best servants are those who are best served ; and the goodwill and kindness which we show to others are by them ac- corded to us; for it is a sin to suppose that domestic servants are by nature worse than their mistresses.

Fish. 197 Precautions.—The pieces of fish should be about: the size of half-inch dice, and are easily removed from the bones, if done before the fish is cold. Do not attempt to form the croquettes till the mince is firm. FISH PUDDING OF A HADDOCK. Ingredients. Haddock. Fotatoes. Butter. Egg. Cayenne. 1. Wash your haddock in cold water. 2.

9 WHAT PLASMON IS. I The name PLASMON distinguishes our preparations of Milk Albumen or Casein from the analogous preparations of all other Manufacturers, and is our Registered Trade Mark. PLASMON is the albumen of pure fresh milk in the form of a dry, soluble, granulated cream white powder. Albumen (termed proteid) is the nourishing principle contained, in varying quantities, in all foodsâ€”whether animal or vegetable. It is the principal substance in the food which is absorbed by the system for forming and feeding all the com- ponent parts of the human body (blood, muscles, nerve, bone, brain, etc.), and for renewing the waste which is continually taking place in the system. Flesh-forming albumen is only present in very small quantities in most foods; it results, therefore, that a large bulk of food is eaten without perfect nourishment being obtained. The albumen (proteid) in fresh milk is the very nutriment itself provided by Nature, and is therefore the most perfect form of food. But the milk albumen (proteid) is liable to speedy changes, which render it insoluble and indigestible. The methods used by casein or proteid manufacturers in the drying of the casein or proteid of milk alter the nature of the albumen, and any addition of a free alkali (carbonate of soda, potash, etc.), however minute in quantity, to the dry casein, renders the proteid worthless as a nutrient, and probably harmful to the digestive system. It has been the aim of science to overcome this difficulty,

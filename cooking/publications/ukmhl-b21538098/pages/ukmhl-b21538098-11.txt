7 INTRODUCTION. Report on the Culinary Value and Possibilities of Plasmon in “Food and Cookery,’’ August, 1903. Edited by C. Herman Senn. SINCE the science of dietetics has become more intimately allied with the art of cookery, it has been recognised that the so-called “rich foods” are not always the most nourishing. That is to say, there are many substances which, while most useful as stimulants and producers of fat, are practically devoid of all flesh-forming and waste-repairing properties. Such foods taken in excess are positively harmful, loading the human system with substances difficult to eliminate and which induce disease. At the other end of the scale are starchy and watery foods, of less nutrient value. Of course, the aim in planning a dietary or cooking a meal must be to properly choose different foods, so as to provide a well- balanced ration. But with the modern exigencies this is not always easy to do, and hence has arisen the necessity for prepared foods. These are, as a rule, associated with the feeding of the young, the aged, and the ailing. There are certain preparations, however, which have a far wider application. Take Plasmon as an instance. Plasmon is a white granulated substance, devoid of scent or flavour ; so it can be easily manipulated, and when used in cookery does not alter the taste of any dish. It is, therefore, safe to use. Now let us consider the advisability of using it. Well, Plasmon is the scientifically prepared albumen of pure fresh milk. It is an albumen which is in no way altered, so that it possesses all the nourishing qualities of the albumen of meat, white of egg, or milk, without the bulk of water. Unlike the casein of cheese, the albumen in this preparation is chemically unaltered ; consequently it is quite digestible and easily assimilated. As albumen is the chief requisite

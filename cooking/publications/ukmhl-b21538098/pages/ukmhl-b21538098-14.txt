10 and to preserve the albumen (proteid) of milk in its natural unaltered condition. Plasmon is the result of prolonged investi- gations. It is the albumen (proteid) of pure milk, containing its most important original salts, prepared by a process which does not alter its vital and physical properties or in any way lessen its nourishing effects. The albumen (proteid), as in fresh milk, remains absolutely pure and soluble, though in a dry granulated form, and retains its properties unchanged for an indefinite period. Plasmon added to any food—no matter how poor such may be in albumen (proteid) substance—at once raises the nourish- ing value of the food, a teaspoonful of the Plasmon powder being equal to the nutriment contained in | lb. of prime fillet of beef. It is flavourless and odourless. Plasmon, owing to its high nutritive qualities and the perfect way in which it is assimilated, invigorates the digestive system, so that other foods taken with it, or after it, are more easily digested. Although it increases the weight, it does not do so by inducing an undue accumulation of fat—in fact, owing to the ease and rapidity w'ith which it is assimilated, Plasmon not only gives strength to the digestive system, but speedily rectifies all abnormalities in nutrition ; while semi- starvation from imperfect digestion becomes impossible, so do the many evils which result from the morbid absorption of fat and the use of non-nourishing foods. A feature which demonstrates the strengthening qualities of Plasmon is that when it is taken regularly the craving for alcoholic stimulants—even among confirmed inebriates—is subdued. Plasmon, being free from flavour and smell and perfectly soluble, is an ideal food-enricher for all classes of the com- munity, applicable, therefore, to all descriptions of foods.

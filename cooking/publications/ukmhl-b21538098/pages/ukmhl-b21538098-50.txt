54 PART VI.—IN VALID COOKERY. The following recipes have been specially prepared for invalids (particularly diabetics), but practically every one of these will be found delicious and quite suitable for ordinary use. If not required for patients suffering from obesity, diabetic affections, gout, and certain forms of skin diseases, sugar should be substituted for saccharin in the sweet dishes. Although saccharin (a preparation from coal-tar) possesses a sweetening power many times greater than cane or beet sugar, it is not a food, and is therefore of no value except medicinally. It is to be noted that Plasmon lightens dishes and greatly facilitates digestion and nutrition. 118.

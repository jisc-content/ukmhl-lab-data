0 THE FOOD OF MAN. J'ut as the function of food may, in the widest sense, he taken to he the renewal of the material consumed in the various processes of life, including, of course, the great heating process, this one fact stands clearly out, viz., that the food which man requires for his sustenance must contain, in proper proportion, all the constituent elements of the human body ; and that it is most desirable also that these elements should exist in the food in combinations more or less identical severally with the structures of the body, so that the food need not be laboriously resolved into its elements, to be re-formed into new combinations, suitable for assimila- tion and incorporation. It is for this reason that animal food is more easily and more readily assimilated than vegetable food, and that a larger bulk of the latter is required to provide (he same given amount of nutri- ment as the former. Foods may be said to be the more perfect the more of such directly assimilable combinations they contain. The chief materials of which the various structures of the body arc severally composed may be briefly enumerated as follows :— Water — required to maintain the indispensable fluidity of the vital juices; fat—the reserve store of combustible matter, generated from saccharine and other carbonaceous substances; fibrin, albumen, gelatin, ehondrin, &c.—salts of potash, soda, lime, magnesia,

102 POULTRY AND GAME. It may be cursorily observed here that we are not very advanced yet in England in the breeding and fattening of geese, that is to say in comparison with certain parts of France, Holland, and Germany. In the latter two countries the chief object of the fattening process is the same as with us in England, the production of solid, nutritious flesh, to wit, and wholesome fat. But in certain parts of France, more especially in Toulouse, and most of all in Stras- burg, the object is to produce morbid enlargement and fatty degeneration of the liver of the unhappy bird. Toulouse enjoys the great advantage of a very fine, superior, race of geese, which, properly fed, will attain to twice the weight of the common species. This race is of broad and massive build, short-legged, and, as a general rule, gray in plumage. A wide membraneous bagr or sack stretches from under the craw down to the bell}7, which thus actually trails on the ground. Large accumulations of fat find room within the folds of this bag. As the fattening progresses the bird grows more and more unwieldy, until at last it loses all power of moving about. This species of the genus goose is bred more especially in the departments of the Garonne* Haute Garonne, Tarn, Gers, and Ariege, where it forms well- nigh the most important branch of rural industry.

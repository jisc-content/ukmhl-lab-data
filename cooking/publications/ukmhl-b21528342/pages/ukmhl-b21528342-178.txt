CONDIMENTS. 1GG to obtain this precious matter so necessary to health and life * At this present time every one, at least in the British Isles, may command an almost unlimited supply of salt, which also has its drawback. We are apt to use this great blessing in excess. It may be laid down as a safe rule for the kitchen and table that undersalting is less inconvenient, and less likely to be hurtful, than oversalting. You can always add to a deficient quantity of salt, whilst you cannot take the excess away. Of course I am perfectly aware that there are many ways and methods and processes recommended by the ingenious to effect this desirable end, and there may certainly be some of these more or less effectual; only, I am sorry to say, my personal experience in this matter makes me slightly doubtful of this. In cookery instructions no general quantitative rules can well be laid down for the use of salt. Experience * Our actual “ taxers ” would seem to act upon a similar notion with regard to beer and spirits, in attempting to raise still higher an already exorbitant tax. They may chance to find their notion a very serious mistake and blunder. It would be better for the revenue and for the cause of temperance to lower the duty and to put down by the strong hand of the criminal law the infamous adulteration of wine, beer, and spirits, which forms one of the blackest plague spots of our time. Were our fermented liquors but pure there would not be half, nay, not a fourth, the intempe- rance which we have to deplore at present.

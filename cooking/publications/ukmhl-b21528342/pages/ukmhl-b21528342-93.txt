After a time—shorter or longer according to the temperature—the stiffness relaxes, and the flesh enters into the incipient stage of decomposition, which tends to soon render it soft and tender again. It is at this stage that in our latitudes it is fittest for the processes of cooking. The few general remarks I have to make upon these processes, some of which have moreover already been touched upon incidentally, may be briefly summarised under the several heads of Boiling, Stewing and Breusing; and Roasting, Baking and Frying and Broiling. I place Boiling, Stewing, and Braising,first, because the processes of boiling flesh are by many able judges considered to be more simple, more easy, and more economical than roasting, &c. Within certain limits, I am much inclined to be of the same opinion. Every process of cooking flesh is unavoidably attended with a certain loss of weight, which admittedly is larger in roasting, &c., than in boiling, &c.,—that is to say, of course, if every product of the process is properly utilised. Boiling has two very distinct, widely different objects in view, to wit, either to extract part of the juices, whilst attending to the tenderness of the cooked flesh, or to retain, as fully as practicable, the gravy in the meat. To effect the former purpose put the joint in cold

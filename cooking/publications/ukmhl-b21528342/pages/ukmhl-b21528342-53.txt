PANTRY, LARDER AND CELLAR. 41 which a contrivance of this kind may be put. I simply make the suggestion. A few words about pots and pans may not be thought altogether out of place here. Copper and brass vessels, carefully attended to, look very nice in a kitchen, and, if properly tinned, find their uses in many ways. It must not be overlooked, however, that tinning comes rather expensive, and that it is inexpedient to prepare food with acid ingredients in it even in tinned brass or copper vessels. At least, it is always advisable not to keep the food in them longer than necessary for cooking, but to transfer it soon to earthenware, tin, tin-plate, or tinned or enamelled iron vessels. Meat messes should never be kept overnight in even well-tinned copper or brass, or, fur the matter of that, in iron or tin-plate vessels, as they are apt to acquire a disagreeable flavour in them. In the earlier part of my career glazed earthenware vessels were to the fore, and I remember well that such vessels would (jven stand the open fire. Many an omelette have I eaten fried in a glazed earthenware pan. I am afraid the best earthenware now-a-days will not always stand a fierce fire;* but I know that it will * At the Healtli Exhibition sets of fire-proof pottery were shown. I believe they will stand a fierce fire ; but I have not had a chance of giving them a trial. I have found Chinese earthen pots suited to the spirit lamp, and to gas and charcoal.

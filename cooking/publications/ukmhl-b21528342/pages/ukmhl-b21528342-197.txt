185 SALADS. I, for my part, prefer my salad dressing made simply with oil, vinegar, salt, a sprinkling of pepper, a little tarragon, mint and chervil for seasoning, a dash of Worcester or Harvey, and a drop or two of garlic vinegar. I am rather careful with the salt, as nothing is easier than to oversalt a salad. Also, I do not hold with the notion that it takes three parts of oil to one of vinegar. As a rule, I find three oil to two vinegar anrply sufficient. The best Lucca oil only should be used, and the best French vinegar (proof strength of five per cent, pure acetic acid, sp. gr. of 1019). Hard- boiled eggs, anchovies as per foot note, slices of beet, finely chopped onions or shalots (moistened with vinegar, which gives them a nice colour), may be placed on the table in small plates or dishes, to be added to the salad according to taste. If you have no garlic vinegar at hand, you may give just the faintest suspicion of garlic, such as cannot possibly incommode or offend the most fastidious, by rubbing a cut clove of garlic on the soft side of a bread than absurd. Yet have I seen it done over and over again. But a few anchovies are an improvement. Only, they should be pro- perly prepared. Wash your anchovies repeatedly and thoroughly in cold water, place them in a stone or glass jar with the best French vinegar, and let them stand a few days before using them. By this time the bones are quite soft, so it matters not whether you take them out or leave them. Out your anchovies—one per person—up very small, and add them to the salad dressing.

FISH AND SHELLFISH. 13G pound of asparagus tops, the juice of a lemon, a table- spoonful of ketchup, and salt and cayenne to taste. Stew for about half-an-liour, with constant stirring. Just a few minutes before the stew is taken off the fire, add the minced meat of the lobster and crab, as this should never be boiled twice over, which would only make it more indigestible. Some add also a boiled fowl, but I think there is no need of this. I have a notion the dish is quite complex enough as it stands.

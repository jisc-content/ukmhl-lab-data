I incline much to this French coffee pot, as it is both expeditious and economicalâ€”which the so-called Vesuvian and Venetian hydraulic apparatus certainly are not. Our old cook used to make her coffee in an earthen biggin, into which she suspended a funnel-shaped muslin bag sewn all round to a silver ring at the top with hooks to catch hold of the rim of the biggin.

The socks used for the purpose should be quite new from the shop, and should, moreover, be boiled for half an hour in clean soft water to remove the least trace of extraneous matter of any kind.

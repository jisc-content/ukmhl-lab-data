M EATS. CO and a half hours claimed by some authorities. Let me remark here that a set of sharp table-knives forms a most important adjunct to proper mastication. I am sorry to say that I know but too many people who, though gifted with splendid teeth, will persist in swallowing their meals in unchewed lumps, sowing thereby the seeds of incurable dyspepsia in after years. I may add from my own dire experience that when some years ago I was irrationally forced to dispose of my dinner within twenty-five minutes, the fierce demon of gastrodynia and gastrorrlioea laid bold of meâ€”and, alas, even to this day I have not done chewing the cud of bitter repentance of my weakness in trying to submit to an unnatural rule. There is also a popular belief that underdone meat as a rule is more' tasty and nutritious, and more easily digested than well-cooked meat. This is simply a superstition, which, like all superstitions, has a tendency to be hurtful. Meat done to a turn is always the most tasty, the most easily digested, the most nutri- tious, and the most wholesome. I am quite aware, of course, that there are a great many people who will dissent more or less from this view of mine, and I will not venture to affirm magis- terially that I am right, and all the dissenters are wrong. I also fully admit that the other extreme of over-cooking meat is vastly the more hurtful of the two.

FERMENTED DRINKS. 228 jars, aud let them stand three days in a cool place, opening them from time to time to give them a stir with a stout glass rod. Then pour off the liquid from each jar gradually into another large crock, through a rather coarse hair sieve, to -which transfer finally also the residuary pulp from the jar, working it through. Let the last portion of liquid still remaining in the dregs drain off into the crock, through a clean linen cloth that has been washed in boiling water and dried again. Bottle the Strawberry Rum or Extract in Imperial quart bottles, cork and seal these and lay them down horizontally in a dry cool cellar or other suitable place. The dregs will yield a very good punch, with about half a pint of the mixed spirit added, and the proper proportion of boiling water poured over, with sugar and lemon juice to taste. To make Strawberry Punch, moisten a pound and a half of sugar in a bowl with five to six ounces of clear fresh lemon juice, add two drops each of lemon and orange essence, and pour in one of your imperial quarts of Strawberry Rumâ€”stir the mixture, and add two quarts of boiling water. Cover the bowl, and let it stand till the evening, when you will find it a truly delicious liquor. Bottled, it will keep four or five days; the bottles should always be laid horizontally.

INTRODUCTION. r> It is by no means unlikely, I am afraid, that some of the hints given by me may be thought a trifle over trivial, or even may lay me open to sneering comments upon my presumption in professing to teach grand- mothers the simple art of sucking eggs. I humbly plead guilty to the charge, hut I would urge in extenuation my belief that there may he some granddaughters, at least, that stand in need of such rudimentary instruction, and perhaps even not a few grandmothers whose remembrance of the lessons of their earlier life may occasionally require a little reviving. Some months ago I came accidentally upon a little book with “Don’t” on the title page, if I misremember not. Among other items of sage advice there was a caution to young people not to use their knife to carry the food to the mouth. Well, I thought at the time the author might have omitted such an extremely common-place and apparently superfluous injunction. Since then, however, I have had occasion to see, even in generally genteel families, the knife used in lieu of the fork, and this by children of more than twelve.

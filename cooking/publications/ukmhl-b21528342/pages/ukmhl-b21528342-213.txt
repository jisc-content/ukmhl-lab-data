C0FFE2. 201 an:l other parts of the Continent, coffee is but too often roasted black. Besides, many roasters think the addition of a small lump of butter, na}r, even of an onion, a desirable improvement. Why not a clove of garlic or two, which would be just as rational. By the side of such vagaries even the adulteration of coffee with chicory, &c., looks almost less hurtful. And, to crown all, I am credibly informed some of these wonderful coffee makers and improvers in certain parts of France and Germany have of late taken to a new refinement. They wash the coffee before roasting it. Yes, ni plus ni moins, as the French say: they put the raw beans on a colander, and pour cold water over them. Then they rub the wetted beans in a cloth, and try to dry them again in the sun or in an oven ; or they simply put them into the roaster wet as they come from the rubbing cloth ! All who know that the drying of the bean is one of the most important processes on coffee planta- tions, and how the least indication of a coming shower is apt to fill the planterâ€™s soul with dismay, lest it should come down upon his precious drying beans, depreciating their value, must be at a loss to fix upon an intelligible reason or motive for this strange pro- ceeding. Well then, bean washers assert as their chief reason that the beans may be artificially coloured, forsooth, and the water will take the false coloring off!

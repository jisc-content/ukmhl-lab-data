MEATS. 09 lowest part, into which a large tube with tap is screwed air-tight. This tube is connected with an air-pump. The lid has another large aperture, into which another tube with tap is screwed air-tight. This tube is connected with a large tub, placed at an elevation of some 15 to 18 feet above it, filled with the requisite quantity of pickle made with water, spiced vinegar, salt, and sugar in suitable proportions. The meat to be pickled is packed into the box as closely as can practically be done. The lid is now put on and soldered over air-tight. The tap in connection with the tub is of course turned off, whereas that connected with the air pump is turned on, and the pump set to work. A small steam engine will answer best. When the air is thoroughlv ex- hausted, the tap is turned off, and the connection with the air pump severed, whilst the tap in the lid is fully turned on, whereupon the pickle is drawn with tre- mendous force into the box, so as to penetrate every part of the pork inside. The apparatus will serve over and over again. I know very little indeed of mechanics— as for the matter of that, of anything else, poor Jacobsen used to tell me—so I cannot say what difficulties may be in the way of the realisation of the suggestion here made. I venture simply to throw it out for the con- sideration of those who may know more about it; J would also plead in extenuation of any crudeness and

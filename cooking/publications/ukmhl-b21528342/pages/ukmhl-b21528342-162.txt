At last they actually brought mo before the Juge de Paix, a dull German, who could not see the alleged insult, and fined the prosecutrix five francs for bringing me there upon a trumpery charge. After this reminiscential digression, I crave permis- sion to give two recipes, the one how to bake the hind legs of the frog, the other how to make tasty ragout of them. Put the hind legs in a suitable vessel with a mixture in equal parts—according to requirement—of water and French vinegar, to which add a handful of salt. Whip the legs about with a broom, to thoroughly cleanse them, and wash them in several waters. Melt one to two ounces of butter in a saucepan, and lay in the frog legs, a few shalots in thin slices, and a little salt, put on the lid tight and stew over a slow fire until nearly done.

If you use an enamelled frying-pan for roasting your coffee, on no account whatever use it for any other purpose, as there is barely a smell that coffee will not attract and acquire to the impairment of its fragrance. I am told that Mr. William Sugg has lately invented a self-acting coffee-roasting apparatus. I have had no occasion yet to try this new invention, so cannot speak from personal experience of it’s working.

MEATS. 59 Beef is also the most easily digested meat, two and three-quarters to three hours sufficing for the purpose, whereas mutton takes from three hours to three hours and a quarter. Lamb, which is an immature meat, is said to be more easily digested than full-grown mutton. Veal and pork are held to be much more difficult of digestion. With regard to this it may be said, however, that the process of mastication makes a deal of difference. Perfect mastication brings every particle of the flesh under the teeth, and makes the salivary glands fully perform their appointed part in this most important process of life. Saliva is indispensable to digestion. With imperfect mastication there is incomplete secre- tion of saliva, and the stomach has to work double tides to make up the deficiency. This is more par- ticularly the case with veal and pork, where the under- done and lumped flesh has a tendency to elude the teeth, especially when there happen to be gaps in the incisors or grinders. In such cases cutting the flesh into very small bits, and turning them over and over in the mouth, to give the salivary glands full time to act, will wondrously aid digestion; so that well-roasted veal or pork, properly cut and properly masticated, within the limits set by the state of the teeth, will not take more than from three and three quarters to four and a quarter hours to digestâ€”in lieu of the five hours to five

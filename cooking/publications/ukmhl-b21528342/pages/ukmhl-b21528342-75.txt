MEATS. G3 doubt, very difficult to digest; so is pig’s flesh hardened and shrivelled up by over-roasting, or boiled to rags. Even that admirable digestive agent, the acid pepsin glycerin, which is prepared from the stomach of the pig, may fail to make a proper impression upon such most unsuitable food. I remember having seen it recommended somewhere to turn cold pork scraps into a dainty dish* by frying them in butter or lard! I have also many times sat ruefully behind a dish of boiled or roast meat, pork or other, boiled up once more in curried stock. Such curries are not good to eat, and often utterly in- digestible. True, to make cold mutton or white meats into a currie is one of the most appetising ways to turn them to the best account; but it must be done properly, without giving the meat another boiling, which cannot but harden and toughen it, and make it indigestible. The proper way is to cut the cold meat very small. Take a quart of good stock to two and a half or three pounds of cold meat. Chop a small onion or two, or three shalots very fine, and fry in lard to a light yellowish-brown. Blend two ounces of flour and half * I may remark here en passant that there are many cold scraps that may by proper culinary treatment be made into very palatable dishes; but certainly not into “ dainty ” ones in the proper acceptation of the term. There are also certain scraps only fit at the best to go into the stock pot.

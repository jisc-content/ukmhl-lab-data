MEATS. Cl Only somehow I cannot help thinking that if we are to eat our meals cooked, they may just as well he properly cooked and well done than he left half raw. I remember some years ago when I was in Paris, Howard Paul invited me to an “ English dinner ” in the Rue Vivienne, and I shudder even now when I think of the waiter bringing in triumphantly a piece of raw beef, which he placed before us with conscious pride as “ Rosbif Anglais, tout saignant.”* We sent the choice morsel back, to the intense amazement and disgust of the waiter and of the Maitre d’Hotel. The same remarks apply of course to all other meats, especially to veal, lamb and pork. Mutton is more delicately flavoured than heef. It is generally held to be a lighter food, though it is by no * In certain parts of Germany ancl France a “ delicacy ” is much patronised by a great many people which is eaten not only “tout saignant,” but absolutely raw. A raw steak (as fresh as it can be got) is minced, mixed with finely chopped shalots and parsley, and salt and pepper added to taste. A raw egg is broken over this mess, and the dainty dish is placed before you, with oil and vinegar to add as you may fancy. I do not wish to stand on any one’s toes, and there may be people in England inclined for that sort of food ; but I, for my part, must freely confess that I abominate the very sight of it. In Strasburg I used to be invited nearly every day to partake of it, as most of my friends did very freely. There was a Saxon officer who would actually intrigue to get me asked along with him to such raw steak and egg feasts, simply that he might do me the Christian charity to relieve me of my portion—in addition to his own.

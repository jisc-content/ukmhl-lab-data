On the continent they steer clear of this inconvenience by simply looking upon vegetables as separate and distinct foods, not mere adjuncts to meat, and making them accordingly into palatable independent dishes. They use butter on the continent, or lard, dripping, goose fat, duck fat, suet, rendered with milk, and mutton fat (from young animals only), also melted with milk, for the preparation of palatable vegetable dishes. These fats must be absolutely free from all albumenoid or other admixture. They should be kept in stone jars, tied over with perforated paper, in a cool and airy place. If the least taint is observed in a fat, it should at once be re-melted. Fresh vegetables, especially of the cabbage tribe, should be put at once into fast boiling water, in small successive portions, to prevent stopping of the boiling. Salt should be added only, towards the end of the cook- ing, as its earlier application would simply tend to harden the vegetables. They should also be boiled in open pans, to prevent the return of the parts driven off by the heat. Boiling water should always be kept at hand, to re-fill in case of need.

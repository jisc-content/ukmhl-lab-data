215 TEA. me; so much so, indeed, that when a few years later on I passed a vacation in Berlin with a schoolfellow, I one day surprised the lady of the house by artlessly telling her that I was afraid the tea she was making at the time would not turn out nice, as she had omitted the dance and the incantation! Well, well! I was then only rising thirteen, and so a fool’s pardon was readily granted me. When the tea had thus been left to draw altogether some four to five minutes, cook trans- ferred the contents of the pot to a Chinese teapot, heated previously with boiling water. It seems that our best tea-makers are agreed now that four to five minutes’ infusion will extract from tea all that it is desirable should be extracted. Tea should always be made with soft water. The addition of soda to hard water to adapt it for tea making is, in my opinion, objectionable, as it must tend to destroy the respiratory action of the tea, and to im- pair its flavour. Distilled water and rain water, though the very perfection of softness, will not do for tea- making, as they contain neither air nor mineral ingre- dients. The Chinese take their water in preference from hill springs or running streams. Tea should always be made with water newly boiled, and boiled slowdy rather than fast. The water should be actually bubbling when it is poured on the tea. Tea is best with unboiled milk or cream.

A few, more humanely disposed, perhaps, or a little more sensible, will allow their fattening geese at least the enjoyment of the light of day and a little freedom of motion ; and I have had occasion, over and over again, to see that these trifling indulgences do not act adversely upon the development of the liver, as is generally urged by the cold-blooded advocates of the more cruel system. The geese are crammed twice or three times a day, according to the greater or lesser rapidity of di- gestion. The poor bird is dragged forth, for the purpose, from its narrow cage by the feeder, who places it firmly between her knees, opens the beak with one hand, and crams the softened maize down the gullet with the other, generally simply with her finger. Less expert crammers use a funnel, with a smooth wood or ivory stick to expedite the descent of the food. When the feeder thinks the bird has had enough for one meal, she thrusts it back into its living tomb, leaving it to digest in helpless immobility its forced gorging, till its turn comes round again for another repetition in the same unnatural act in the same sad drama of suffering. It takes from a fortnight to a month to cram a goose to the proper “ sticking ” or throat-cutting point.

This is the aqueous solution with which meat beginning to putrefy should be repeatedly brushed over in every part, say for about half an hour, after which it is to be thoroughly washed, first in lukewarm then in cold water. This will leave it free from all putrid taste and smell. To prepare a solution of salicylic acid in French brandy, dissolve about a quarter of an ounce of the acid in a pint of the best Cognac. This may be used to keep compotes, preserved fruits, &c. Fresh strawberries, for instance, intended to be used for a bowl in winter, are washed, let drain, and put into a suitable jar, which is then filled up to the brim with good wine, mixed with the alcoholic salicylic acid solu- tion, in the proportion of about two ounces to the quart. The jar is then carefully tied over with a double layer of properly moistened parchment paper. Smoked ham and Gotha and Brunswick summer sausages may be easily kept by brushing them over with alcoholic solution of salicylic acid, packing them in perfectly dry straw, sewing them up in canvas, and .suspending them free in a cool and airy place.* * This excellent preservative will lie found equally useful for a variety of similar purposes. Thus, for instance, where part of a bottle of wine has been poured out, the rest may be kept good by adding a teaspoonful of the alcoholic solution per half bottle of wine.

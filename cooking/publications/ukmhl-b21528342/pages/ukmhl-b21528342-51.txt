PANTRY, LARDER AND CELLAR. 30 As regards your water-bath, a few ounces of salt dissolved in it will enable the temperature to rise several degrees—(in a saturated solution even up to 14 F.)— above the boiling point of water—which may sometimes be desirable. Have nothing to do with skewers and spits; they only serve to make holes in the joint, through which the nutritious juices escape. Use twine or string in- stead to tie round the joint if necessary. Never keep coffee or tea in tin canisters, as the tannic acid in these commodities is not unlikely to affect the metal, to however trifling an extent, which will of course react upon the quality of the coffee and tea. The best way of keeping these and other pantry goods is in glass, porcelain, or earthenware jars. There are certain glass jars in which French plums are supplied to the English market. These generally hold two or three pounds. Their over-lapping screwed covers make the sand, and plunging it immediately into cold water, it should make the water fiz. In smaller kitchens stewpans, some four to six inches deep by six to nine inches in diameter, may he used instead of the large sand-bath. Many year's since I suggested to a Birmingham maker of frying- pans the use of double-bottom plates, with a thin layer of tho- roughly ignited sand interposed, which, I expressed my belief, might to some extent protect the frying contents from burning. The gentleman, however, did not see it. Perhaps some other maker may try it now—only mind, this is simply a notion of mine, and that I will not undertake to guarantee its success.

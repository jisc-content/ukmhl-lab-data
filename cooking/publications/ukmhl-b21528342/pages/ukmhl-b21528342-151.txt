MOLLUSCS AND TURTLE. 139 impoverished, and some even altogether destroyed; and it will take many a long year before we can reasonably hope to restore our supplies. As to the old prices ever ruling again in the oyster market, it would be over san- guine to expect it. Salmon was at one time the poor man’s food : is it at all likely that it ever will be so again ? The oyster is mostly eaten uncooked, with lemon or vinegar, and pepper or cayenne. It is also made into patties, stews, scallops and sauces, &c. It should be borne in mind, however, that all processes of cooking tend to harden the oyster. Many, many long years ago, when a boy, I was fond of Huitres farcies, or stuffed oysters, a Russian delicacy, prepared by opening a dozen oysters in the deep shells, bearding them, rinsing them in their own liquid, then putting in each a mince of basil, thyme, savory, parsley, shalot, two or three capers, a small mushroom, all finely chopped, grated lemon-peel, the size of a small nut of butter, a few grains of cayenne, a little roast veal, finely minced, and some pounded biscuit (unsweetened), moistened with half a dozen drops of lemon-juice and twice as much Madeira wine—(Marsala will do equally well; so will Hock or Chablis)—covering them with their shell, and baking them in a hot oven, in a pan with concave cover filled with live charcoal. Blue points, Portuguese, French, and Dutch oysters will do for this dish.

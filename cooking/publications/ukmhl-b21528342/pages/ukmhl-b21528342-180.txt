CONDIMENTS. 16S detected by addition of nitrate of silver, with the latter by adding chloride of barium. A white deposit is proof positive of the presence of the one or the other of these acids. Vinegar forms the foundation of many sauces and a variety of pickles. It is often used flavoured with garlic, tarragon, mint, and other herbs, &c. To make Garlic Vinegar, pull your garlic any time between June and September—August answers best. Chop two or three ounces very fine, and tie them in a small muslin bag. Suspend this in a well stoppered quart jar, and fill up with best French vinegar, with two ounces of salt dissolved in it. Put the stopper in tight, and let the jar stand a full fortnight to three weeks, shaking it well every day except the last two days, to allow any floating impurities to subside. Then decant the clear liquid and strain or filter into small bottles. Cork the bottles well. This acetic essence of garlic is very powerful, and should be used most sparingly and with proper judgment. So subtle and penetrating is the flavour that a few drops of the essence will be found amply sufficient to impart to broth, gravies, soups, ragouts, and salads, that delicate suspicion of the presence of garlic which the French call sowpgon cl’ail; whilst the least excess in its use may spoil the finest and most tasty dish. Shalot Vinegar may be prepared in the same way.

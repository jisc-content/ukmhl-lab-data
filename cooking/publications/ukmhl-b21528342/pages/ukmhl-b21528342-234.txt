222 FERMENTED DIIINKS. “ neat," as it is termed, but always more or less largely diluted with water, according to the actual strength of the spirit, which depends upon the proportion of alcohol in it. This proportion differs widely in the various spirits—rums, brandies, whiskies, arracks, gins, fcc.— supplied by the trade. The legal standard strength is fixed at 49'24 per cent, by weight of alcohol to 50'76 per cent, of water—which is very nearly half and half. This is called proof. Spirits containing more water than 50'7G per cent, are said to be under proof; when they contain more alcohol than 49‘24 per cent, by weight they are over proof. By Act of Parliament whisky, brandy, and rum are not to be sold weaker than 25° under proof, gin not weaker than 35° under proof, which means that the former should always contain 39-4, the latter 36-5, per cent, by weight of alcohol. There is much reason, however, to doubt that spirits of the legal strength are always supplied by the retail trade. Over proof, or even proof spirits, are, as a rule, to be procured only wholesale. On the Continent, more especially in Germany and Holland, but also in France, I have often met with fine old rum of close upon 70 per cent, alcoholic strength. I am told that the old navy rum supplied to the fleet contains 58 per cent, by weight of absolute alcohol. I believe also that there are many reputable firms in the United Kingdom that sell good and genuine spirits of stated strength. The

SO PROVISIONS AND REQUISITES IN KITCHEN, and mechanical nature, I think they may be easily tiu improvement iu ovens—baking or roasting, viz.,—a wrought iron frame of the inside width and height of the oven, consisting simply of two uprights, resting on solid stands, with a bar laid across on top, to hook the joint to which is to be roasted in the oven. By this simple contrivance the joint is made to hang free, surrounded equally on all sides by the hot air of the oven. The dripping pan—preferably an earthenware one—is placed underneath for the Yorkshire pudding, potatoes, &c. 1 have tried the frame and I have found it answer. The uprights should have two or three hooks fixed on them to receive nets stretched across for doing fish, &c. The cross bar should be constructed to receive an earthenware or porcelain cylinder made in two halves to screw together, per- forated throughout the lower part. Butter, lard, or whatever other fat may be required for basting, according to the nature of the joint, &c., mixed and worked up into a paste with some flour, to prevent too rapid melting, is placed in the cylinder, which is suspended from the bar just above the roasting joint. This, with clever management, will make the basting almost automatic. I have tried the frame and have found it a success. As regards the automatic basting cylinder here suggested, I cannot speak positively; but as the difficulties in the way can only be of a technical

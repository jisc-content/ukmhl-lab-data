FISH AND SHELLFISH. 120 or frying. The first of these processes is by no means the most tasty way of preparing fish for the table, nor is it economical, as a notable portion of the nutritive juices escapes into the water. Broiling, where appli- cable, is a much better way, the fish being more tasty, and no loss of substance incurred. Baking, stewing, and frying are also superior ways of preparing fish for the table. “ Salting,” says Mr. Tegetmeier, “ though often neces- sary to preserve fish when caught in large quantities, is not a desirable mode of preparing white fish. It extracts a very large proportion of the nourishment and hardens the fibrin; and if the salt has to be extracted by soaking in water before cooking, as in the case of salt cod, very little nourishment remains. The fat of the oily fish, as herring, &c., is not removed by salting; hence they are very valuable as food when preserved in this manner.” Fresh water fish has occasionally a musty smell and taste, which a few hours’ immersion in a strong solution of salt in water will remove. Fish is most commonly cooked in the mass, but occasionally it is cut in slices. This operation is called crimping. Fresh water fish, unless of large size, is generally put into boiling water, and removed from the fire after a short time. Large fresh water and sea fish is, as a rule.

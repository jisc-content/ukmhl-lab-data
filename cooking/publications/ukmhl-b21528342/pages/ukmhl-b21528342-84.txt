MEATS. 70 imperfectness of the scheme given that it is drawn from memory, after many long years. More recently it has occurred to me that if the plan is at all realisable, it might be turned to account for the preservation of meat—simply substituting for the piclde thoroughly clarified de-albuminated melted fat—beef fat for beef, mutton fat for mutton, &c. To this end the box should be lined inside over the tin with woollen felt, and covered outside with the same material. The pieces of meat (fresh killed if possible) should be packed most closely. To ensure the almost absolute absence of air from the box, some carbonic acid gas might be let in after exhaustion, and drawn off again. Provision would, of course, have to be made for this purpose. I am sadly afraid this suggestion, too, may incur condemnation as clumsy and visionary; yet, I honestly think it worth a trial. Exclusion of air is, at all events, admittedly a chief factor in the preservation of meat from decomposition. The non-conducting lining and covering tends to shield the contents of the box from thermic action. Meat might be kept fresh in this way long enough, at least to make it reach our shores undecomposed from the most distant parts. I may as well just intimate that I am not altogether unacquainted with the several processes of preserving meat by cold; by desiccation; immersion in antiseptic

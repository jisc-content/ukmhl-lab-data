MEATS. 04 an ounce of best currie powder with the stock, add the fried onions or shalots, half an ounce of lemon juice, an ounce of butter, half an ounce of Worcester sauce, quarter of an ounce of Liebigâ€™s extract, and forty grains of salt. Put the stock, with the other ingredients, except the meat, in a saucepan over the fire, or on the hot-plate, and let it just come to the boil, with constant stirring. Then add the meat, give the pan a shake, remove from the fire, and dish. This will leave the meat tender, and make a most tasty currie. There are various ways of boiling the rice for this currie. In the first place, there are two sorts of rice almost indifferently used in some kitchens, though there is a most notable difference between the Indian or Patna rice, to wit, and the Carolina, or American rice. In the former the grains remain upon cooking quite distinct; in the latter they are generally broken up into a mucilaginous mass. As a rule, the Patna is preferentially used accordingly for curries; the American, especially the South Carolina variety, for puddings. Some high authorities tell you to put the Patna in cold water, let it boil up, drain off the water, replace it by the same quantity of cold water, let it boil up again, strain off the water once more in the colander, stand the latter on the hot-plate, and stir constantly with two forks until the rice is quite tender. By this means every grain will be left distinct.

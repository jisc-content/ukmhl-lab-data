POULTRY AND GAME. 1)0 mushrooms, half a pint of Laubenheimer or Niersteiner a large ladleful of good broth, the half of a lemon cut in slices (peel and pips removed), and a laurel leaf. Cover the stewpan close, set it again on the fire or hot plate, and let the bird stew slowly until it is nearly done. Then take the pan off the fire, and let the contents cool. Make your paste with fine flour and best fresh butter, and line a suitable pie dish with it. Lay in the peacock with the breast upward, covered with a thin rasher of fat bacon, cover as usual with paste, brush over with egg, and bake in a well heated oven forty to forty-five minutes. The colour ought to be bright yellow. Add to the sauce left in the stewpan, from which the bird has been transferred to the pie dish, a few ladlefuls of good broth and the juice of the other half of the lemon, and keep hot. Take the baked pie out of the oven, raise the top, and pour in the sauce. Stick the peacockâ€™s head on the top, and serve the pie hot. I venture to hint that in stuffing Turkey for roasting it may be found an improvement to substitute pork sausage meat for the suet as directed in cookery books, and to add to the stuffing a quarter of a pound of chopped sultana raisins. It may be found worth a trial. Another hint. Instead of preparing apple sauce separately for Roast Goose, take a suitable number of pippins or other sweet apples, pare them, remove

PANTRY, LARDER AND CELLAR. 37 ledges at back and sides, with two- or three-bladed chopper, will also be found most useful; there ought also to be several smaller chopping boards, for onions, herbs, &c., so that incongruous articles need not be chopped on the same board.* * A full-sized pastry board, with proper rolling pin, is one of the most desirable articles in a kitchen ; so is a cucumber sheer. If 3rou can possibly get a large German sheer, with four or five superposed sharp-edged, blades, set to a narrow guage, which will answer for slicing cucumbers and cabbages in the most expeditious and even way, you will find it a most desirable article. A lemon squeezer, with glass to receive the juice, is also a most valuable thing in a kitchen; so is a good mincing machine. A large iron box, filled with sand, which may be heated to a very high degree, will be found a great convenience for doing eggs to a nicety in from three to four minutes, when contain from less Ilian an ounce to two ounces of pure juice. But that it might look pedantic it would he better to say half an ounce instead of a tablespoonful, two drams in lieu of a teaspoon- ful, and to calculate your quantities accordingly. This simply by way of indication. In this book tablespoonful always means half an ounce, teaspoonful two drams. * I have seen onions, parsley, mint, apples, capers, raisins, meat, anchovies, suet, lemon peel, and sweet herbs chopped suc- cessively on the same board and with the same chopperâ€”without a thought even of an occasional cleaning of either board or chopper between the operations. There should be separate choppers as well as separate boards for articles of different kinds.

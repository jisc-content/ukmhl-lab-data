VEGETABLES. 1G2 be readily procured in London, as all German provision dealers import it. Put a pound or two of the article in a suitable stone jar, with slices of fat bacon at the bottom and in alternate layers. Place the jar in a moderately hot oven, and let it stew from five to six hours. Serve with Frankfurt sausages, or boiled ham or pork, or corned beef. In Germany they stew sourcrout occasionally with a mixture in equal parts of butter, lard, and beef suet; also, for the sake of economy, with lard and rape seed oil mixed. I must say I admire neither way, though I, of course, would jmefer the former, if driven to adopt either. A dear friend of mine, a gentleman of the Hebrew persuasion, most liberal minded, is very fond of Frank- furt sausages and sourcrout. He maintains that the sausages are made of beef. You may also line the jar (bottom and sides) with rashers of fat bacon. Put in half a pound of sourcrout, then a sausage, then a quarter pound of sourcrout, another sausage, and so on to the top, and let it stew gently till done. To do Frankfurt sausages by themselves to perfection, heat water in a saucepan to fast boiling; then put in your sausages, and let them boil eight minutes. Serve with the sourcrout, or with horseradish sauce, or with mashed potatoes. Of Cucumbers I shall have occasion to speak in the chapter specially devoted to salads.

CONDIMENTS. 167 is the best guide in this, as in many other questions of proper proportions. Its affinity for water makes salt a great preserving agent for meat and other substances; putrefaction requiring the presence of moisture, which salt absorbs. The use of salt in the preservation of meat has been spoken of already, and commented upon in the proper place. In some countries, as in France and Germany, for instance, salt is largely employed for the preservation of green vegetables for use in winter. Vinegar also is a favourite condiment, and a powerful agent of preservation. It has the faculty of softening the fibres of meat, and making them tender. It may be derived from a variety of sources, as all saccharine matters are capable of acetous fermentation ; and in former times, when it was by no means easy to get good vinegar everywhere at a moderate price, it was often made at home from weak solutions of sugar, with or without the aid of the so-called vinegar plant.

UNFERMENTED BEVERAGES. 200 important branch of mixing and blending several kinds of beans together so as to combine body and fragrance. do not think French coffee dealers and coffee makers care very much to cultivate and practise that branch ; and when they do, I have my doubts whether sufficient care is taken by them to bring the different beans to be blended to the same degree of dryness before proceeding to mix and roast them. The natural result is that one class of beans may only just be reaching the stage of light-yellowishness when the other classes may actually have passed through the umber-brown to the black stage of torrefaction, and may be burning to cinders. The proper sizing of the beans, again, is but rarely attended to: a small bean may be burnt to coal by the time a large one is only just properly roasting. These are im- portant points, which are but too often ignored and neglected in France just as much as elsewhere. It is in the process of roasting that the volatile aromatic oil to which coffee owes its fragrance is generated or evolved. The generation of the oil com- mences when the beans are roasted to a yellowish- brown colour; it is completed when the beans are assuming a chestnut-brown tint. Continued roasting beyond this point can only lead to the destruction of the oil generated in the earlier stages of the process. When the beans are burnt to blackness the oil has completely passed offâ€”and unfortunately, in France

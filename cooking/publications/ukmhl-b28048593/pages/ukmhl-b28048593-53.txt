SOUPS. 37 ‘ But his neat cookery ! He cut our roots in characters ; And sauced our broths, as Jtmo had bec7i sick. And he her dieter.'—‘ Cymbeune,’ Spoonful of pickled cucumber or beans will do instead ; a dessertspoonful of flour, one ounce of butter, a teaspoonful each of salt, brown sugar and soy. Cut the vegetables in slices. Mix the curry powder with the dessertspoonful of flour and sprinkle the cut vegetables with it. Put the butter in a stewpan, and when melted add the vegetables and fry a light brown. Take the quarts of water, boiling, and add it to the vegetables, herbs, spices, salt, sugar, lemon rind, apples, and soy, and boil for six hours. Before removing the soup from the fire to strain it, add a teaspoonful of flour and the curry paste, mixed smoothly in two or three tablespoonfuls of cold water. Boil for ‘ / love a table furnished with full plenty.' Massinger.

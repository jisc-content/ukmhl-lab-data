ENTREES. 73 ‘ The simple olives, best allies of wine, Must 1 pass over in my bilt of fare P Byron. Xentil Collops, ID, These are made of the same mixture as the steak, but, instead of being fried in one piece, it is made up into six or seven round cakes about an inch thick. These, after being fried, can be served up with lentil gravy and finely-chopped olives, with tomato sauce, or with a piquante sauce flavoured with pickled walnuts. Xentil Ci'dne, ID, Half a pint of lentils, one pint of water, three ounces of bread, one ounce of butter, one egg, nutmeg, pepper and salt, one tablespoon- ful of cream. Wash the lentils, put them into a saucepan ‘ With olives evergreen the ground is strewed.' Dryden.

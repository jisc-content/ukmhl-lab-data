ENTRIiES. 75 ‘ But from the mountain's grassy side A guiltless feast I bring, tomato, an onion, a teaspoonful of chopped sage, two ounces of butter, an egg, pepper and salt. Boil the lentils for two hours; drain over a wire-sieve. When the water has drained off, place the sieve over a basin, and with a spoon mash the lentils through. Chop the onion fine, and fry it with half the butter in a small saucepan. When it is a nice brown colour, take it from the fire, and measure out a dessertspoonful of it. To this add the tomato and sage finely chopped. Mix these ingredi- ents with the mashed lentils, adding pepper and salt and the remaining butter, and set the basin aside. When the mixture is cold and firm, take out rather more than a dessert- ‘ A scrip with herbs and fruit supplied, A nd water from the spring.' Goldsmith.

BREAD AND BISCUITS. 173 ‘ One poor pennyivorth of bread to all this intolerable quantity of sack!’—‘ Henry IV.’ Dissolve the sugar in half a pint of water and mix the yeast with the water ; when smooth add the milk-and-water ; mix the salt well with the wheatmeal ; stir the yeast mixture into the meal with a wooden spoon for three or four minutes, until it is as stiff as a thick batter ; fill a greased baking-tin about half full with the batter and place it in a screen before the fire at a temperature of 90° Fah. The tin must be turned occasion- ally in order that the bread may rise equally. The time required for rising will be about three-quarters of an hour. The bread must be baked in a hot oven that is gradually allowed to cool. It will take from one hour to an hour and a quarter baking. ‘ They were all sitting dowti together to their lentil soup ; a large wheate7i loaf zvas in the middle of the tablel—‘ Sentimental Journey.’

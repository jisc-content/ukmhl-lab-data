BREAD AND BISCUITS. N 2 179 ‘ Which in the dough they kneaded, rolling cakes, And baking them over the crackling tho7-ns ; With a small wooden spoon stir into the yeast one dessertspoonful of light-coloured moist suear and two of flour, adding lukewarm water until the basin is half full of a thick batter. Stand the basin near the fire out of draughts for thirty minutes, when, if the mixture has risen properly, it will be at the top of the basin, and, when stirred, show itself very light and ropy. Rub into this three pounds of white flour, three ounces of butter, and half a teaspoonful of salt, and as much lukewarm milk and water as will make the whole into a soft* dough. When this has risen place it on a floured pastry-board, and roll across once, leaving the dough about an inch and a half thick. With a deep cutter ‘ So that the savour spread throughout the ca7)ip Of nciu bread smoking. ’ Edwin Arnold.

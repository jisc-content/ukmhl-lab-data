BREAD AND BISCUITS. 167 ‘/f this your care ? Ne'er did you dream that meal ivas made from corn ; Which is not groit'U jmtil the ea}'th be plough'd ; Which is not garner'd up until 'tis c7/t; Which is not fit for use 7intil 'tis grotnid ; Nor usM then till kneadedmto bread.'—Sheridan Knowi.es. JBreab anb Biscuits. JSreaO*iroafting. INTRODUCTORY REMARKS. O make good brown bread, wheatmeal is essential ; white flour mixed with bran — a mixture often used for this purpose—will not make palatable brown bread. Wholemeal—that is, the whole grain ground together—is too coarse and irritating for many digestions ; but to Decorticated wheatmeal there is not this objection. In ‘Afet/links I see the old oak table spread, The clean white trencher, and the good brown bread.' Southey.

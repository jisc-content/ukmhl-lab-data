INTRODUCTION. viii ‘ The business of the kitchen's great, For it is fit that 7nen should eat. ’ Sir John Suckling. In our great-grandmothers’ times every woman of noble birth had her still-room, in which she prepared, or presided over the preparations of, such delicacies as belong to the higher branches of cookery. It is one of the healthiest signs of the present time that the idea of feminine dignity is again compatible with homely occupations. To profess ignorance of the domestic arts is now regarded as rather an indication that a woman is under-educated, or even under-bred, than as a proof of her cultivation. I do not, of course, claim that this little volume is a comprehensive cookery-book. From the thousand and one books already before the public, each housewife may select ‘ I a77t 710 Quaker at 77ty food. I co7ifess I a77i 7iot indiffere7it to the kinds of it. Those u7ictuous 77iorsels of deer's flesh we7-e 7iot 77iade to be received with dispassio7iate services. I hate a 77ia7t who swallows it, affecthig 7iot to know what he is eatmg. I suspect his taste m higher matters'—Charles Lamb.

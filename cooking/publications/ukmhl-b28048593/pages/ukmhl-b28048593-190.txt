BREAD AND BISCUITS. 174 ‘ Contented she earned and ate her brorvn bread.' ‘ Scottish Songs,’ TObeatmeal JSreab with BabiuGs=ipowber. One pound wheatmeal flour ; a saltspoonful of salt; a teaspoonful of baking-powder; three-quarters of a pint of cold water. Put the ingredients into a basin, and mix them lightly with the water, using an iron spoon. This forms a wet dough. Fill a greased bread-tin two-thirds full, to allow space for rising, and put it immediately into a hot oven to bake for three-quarters of an hour. When done, turn it at once out of the tin to cool. This bread will become dry sooner than that made with yeast, so must be made more often. ‘ Let husky luheat the haughs adorn, A nd aits set up their a^unie hor7i. ’ Burns.

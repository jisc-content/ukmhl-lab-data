SWEETS. 148 ‘ What should we talk of dainties then. Of better meat thanks fit for men ? These are but vain: GiUGer Cream. The well-beaten yolks of four eggs, a quarter of a pound of preserved ginger thinly sliced, a pint of milk or cream, half an ounce Nelson’s gelatine soaked in cold water for five or six hours and then dissolved in a quarter of a pint of warm milk, sugar to taste, two tablespoonfuls of the ginger- syrup. Put the eggs and ginger into a stewpan with the milk, syrup, and sugar ; stir over a slow fire till the preparation begins to thicken, but do not let it boil. When nearly cold, add the dissolved gelatine ; whisk gently till the cream begins to set, and stand for four hours, or longer if convenient. ‘ That's only good Which God hath blest, and sent for food.' IzAAK Walton.

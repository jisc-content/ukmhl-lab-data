ENTREES. 72 ‘ Erudite cutlets dressed all ways but plain.'’ Moore. Put the lentils into a saucepan with a quart of water and a teaspoonful of salt. Boil quickly for three hours, stirring occasionally, as they are apt to burn. When all the water has been absorbed, remove the saucepan from the fire. Stir quickly into the lentils the bread (previously soaked in boiling water and squeezed dry), the butter (melted), the onion and sweet herbs, and the egg (well beaten). Put the saucepan back on the fire, and stir for a few minutes for the egg to set; then turn out the mixture on a flat dish to cool. When cold and firm, shape into small cutlets, egg and breadcrumb, and fry in the usual manner. ‘ This night I hold a long accustomed feast. ’ ‘Romeo and Juliet.’

INTRODUCTION IX ‘ Marlow. Let's see yozir list of the larder, then. I ask it as a favour. I always match my appetite to my bill of fare.' ‘ She Stoops to Conquer.’ for herself. The receipts here to be found are, for the most part, either original or revivals of dishes well-known a hundred years ago. Each one has been personally tried, not once, but many times. Great pains have been taken to give the methods of each receipt so clearly and fully that if the instruc- tions are exactly followed, even the novice may succeed at the first trial ; and with this object in view I must beg the experienced cook to excuse me if occasionally they seem a little prolix. In addition to receipts, I have given a few everyday menus for the assistance of young housekeepers, to whom the arrangement of dinner in a tasteful and economical way offers ‘ Your usual style of meal—that is, plenteous, comfortable and in its perfection—should be that to which you zuelcome your friends, as it is that of which you partake yourself.'—Thackeray.

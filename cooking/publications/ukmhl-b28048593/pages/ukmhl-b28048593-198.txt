BREAD AND BISCUITS. 182 ‘ Frae inorn to e'en it's nought but toiling. At baking, roasting, frying, boiling ; Beat the butter and suQrar to a thick cream in a basin with a spoon-whisk ; then add the eggs two at a time, whisking continuously, and for twenty minutes after all the eggs are in ; then drop in the flour a little at a time so that the batter is kept free from lumps ; then add the remaining ingredients. Pour the batter into two deep one-pound cake-tins, lined with well buttered kitchen-paper, and raised an inch or two above the tins, as this will help the cakes to rise and keep them from scorching. Bake the cakes in a moder- ately hot oven for an hour. Before taking them from the oven, test if enough baked by putting a wooden skewer through them. If the skewer comes out dry, the cake is done ; ‘ An tJw the geiitry first are strcchin. Yet e’en the ha' folk fll their pechan Wi’ sauce, 7'agouts, an' sic like trashtrie. That's little shoi't o' dowivight u'astj'ie.'—Burns.

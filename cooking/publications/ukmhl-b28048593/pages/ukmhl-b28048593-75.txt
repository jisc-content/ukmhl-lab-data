ENTREES. 59 ‘ The rafters of the sooty roof Bore %vealth of^vinter cheer ; Of seafowl dried^ and solands store. And gammons of the tusky board—‘ Marmion.’ Place the kromeskies in a cool place until required. Then have ready some thin batter in a basin, and boiling lard in a saucepan. Dip the kromeskies into the batter, and then drop them into the lard. In two or three seconds they will be cooked ; lift them out with a fish-slice, and drain on a sieve before the fire. Care must be taken that the lard is the exact heat, or the kromeskies will have either a burnt or sodden appearance. Dish up on a doily, or embossed blotting- paper. Garnish with fried parsley, and serve as hot as possible. lEgg Dadoles, Four hard-boiled eggs and the raw yolks of two eggs in addition, five ounces of bread- ‘ At the top a fried bacon and liver were seen.’ Goldsmith.

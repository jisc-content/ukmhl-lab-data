BREAD AND BISCUITS. ^ Look at me / / make my oivn breads and there's no difference between one batch and another from year's end to year's end.'— G. Eliot. Set three quarts of water to boil in a sauce- pan ; when the water boils, put in the hops and set the pan to boil for two hours ; re- move from the stove. Allow the liquor to stand until it is milk-warm, then add the salt and brown sugar. Add the flour gradually to the liquor, beating the mixture lightly with a spoon to keep it smooth. Set aside in a warm place for forty-eight hours. At the end of this time add the mashed potatoes ; keep the mixture in a temperature of about 90° Fah., and stir several times during the next twelve hours ; let it stand a night, and in the morning strain the mixture through a sieve and pour into a stone bottle ; cork securely. Two days after it has been bottled ‘ 1 would give you a roasted capon first, And a good ring loaf of wheaten bread: Southey.

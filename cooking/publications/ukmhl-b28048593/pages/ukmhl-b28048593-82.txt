Beat these ingredients well together with a wooden spoon, and pour into a buttered mould. Cover the top over with kitchen-paper, and steam very slowly for half an hour. Remove the mould from the steamer five minutes before turning it out to allow the creme to set. Serve hot with white sauce. The creme can be served up a second time, either as a cold entree, covered with mayon- naise sauce, or it can be cut in slices, egg and breadcrumbed, and fried like cutlets.

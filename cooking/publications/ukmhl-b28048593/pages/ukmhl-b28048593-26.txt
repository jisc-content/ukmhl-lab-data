STOCKS. ‘ Of old, when Scan-on his companions invited. Each guest bi ought his dish, and the feast 7vas united. If our landlord supplies us with bef and 7uilh fish Let each guest bring himself and he brings the best dish.’ Goldsmith. /IDavonnaise Sauce. The yolks of four eggs, half a pint of cream, either fresh or sour ; one dessert- spoonful each of salad oil, tarragon vinegar, and common vinegar ; one teaspoonful of mustard. Whip the yolks up slightly with the cream, and put them into a saucepan. Mix the re- maining ingredients smoothly together, and add them to the eggs and cream. Put the pan on the fire and stir the sauce rapidly with a wooden spoon until it is scalded, then remove from the fire. (Great care must be taken that the sauce does not curdle ; it will not do this if kept from boiling.) If the sauce is to be served cold it will require ‘ Hogsheads of honey, kilderkins of mustard.'—Byron.

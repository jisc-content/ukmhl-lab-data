SAVOURIES. 105 ‘ Then an ei^g for your supper, ivith lettuces white.' Lick; 11 Hunt. an ounce of grated Parmesan cheese, and half an ounce of English or American cheese, the yolk of one egg, a pint of milk, a tablespoon- ful of cream, two ounces of butter, two ounces of flour, mustard and pepper. Stew the macaroni in the milk until quite soft, pass it through a wire sieve, and then mix with it the grated cheese, a little mustard and cayenne-pepper, the yolk of an egg, and the cream. Make the pastry of the butter and flour, and roll it into a square the sixth of an inch thick ; place it on a baking-sheet, and bake. When this is done, take it from the oven, spread the cheese-paste over it, and put it back in the oven for three minutes just to give it time to heat through and to set the ‘ Brown bread, and milk {but first she skimmed her bonds). And rashers of singed bacon on the coals.' Dryden.

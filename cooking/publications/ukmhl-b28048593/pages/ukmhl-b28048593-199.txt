BREAD AND BISCUITS. ‘ If you ivish to grow thinner, diminish yo7ir dinner. And take to light claret instead of pale ale ; if soft cake or batter adheres to it, keep the cake longer in the oven. The cakes are lighter if removed from the tins when taken O from the oven and put on a sieve until cold. The paper should remain on until the cakes are cold. The cake mixture should be put into the tins immediately before they are put into the oven or the fruit will fall to the bottom Instead of being scattered about the cake ; also, the oven must be hot enough to set the mixture quickly or the same thing will happen. If the cakes are to look brown when cut, dry them in the oven with the door slightly open after they are baked. If brown flour be used the cake should be a seed one only. ‘ I.ook do7UJt with an utter co)ttempt upon Imtter, And never touch bread till it's toasted—or stale.' ‘Carols of Cockayne.’ 1^3

ENTREES. 87 ‘ Pant for the praise of dressing to the taste Of critic appetite, no sordidfare, A cucumber.'—Cowpkr. of butter, a little grated nutmeg and salt, one teaspoonful of chilli-vinegar. Mix these ingredients thoroughly in a basin. Peel one or more cucumbers, and cut up in lengths of two or three inches. (In peeling, the greatest care must be taken that none of the green rind remains on the cucumber, as the smallest piece when cooked will render the whole dish bitter and unpalat- able.) Cut out the seeds with an apple-corer, and then put the pieces into boiling water with a pinch of salt ; simmer for half an hour or more, according to the thickness of the cucumber. When tender, take out the pieces and let them drain. When they are cold and firm enough, fill with the stuffing, and braise ‘ The smell of apples, aromas from crushed sage-plant, mint. . . .’ Walt Whitman.

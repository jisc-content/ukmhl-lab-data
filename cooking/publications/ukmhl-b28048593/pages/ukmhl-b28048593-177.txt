SWEETS. ‘ / always thought cold victual nice. My choice would be vanilla ice.' O. W. Holmes. 3cet) Cabinet pubbing. A stale sponge-cake, a little smaller than the pudding to be made ; two wineglassfuls of sherry or marsala; two teaspoonfuls of noyeau, mixed with the wine ; one ounce each of candied cherries and angelica ; one ounce of ratafias crushed small ; a quarter of an ounce of gelatine soaked in cold milk for about fifteen minutes ; one pint of ordinary rich custard flavoured with brandy. Cut the cake in half-inch thick slices, the size of the mould in which the pudding is to be frozen ; lay these slices in a dish, and soak them with the wine. When softened, and the wine all absorbed, fill the mould— 'Sure, these are modern, very modern meats, For I understand 'em not.' Ek.aumont and Fletcher. i6i M

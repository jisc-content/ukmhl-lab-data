Deepening to richness from a snoioy gleam' Keats. half a lemon rubbed on two lumps of sugar, one egg. o o Mix the ^ Food of Health ’ with a quarter- pint milk into a smooth batter. Simmer the rest of the milk with the lemon, sugar, and butter until flavoured with the lemon ; bring it to a boil, and pour it over the mixed ‘ Food of Health,’ stirring with a wooden spoon to keep it smooth. Whip in the egg, and, when this is well mixed, return all to the saucepan ; boil for four or five minutes, stirring all the time to prevent burning. Pour into a wet mould, and put in a cool place for not less than six or eight hours, when it can be turned out.

Eliot.

PART III BAKED PUDDINGS INTRODUCTORY Before beginning to mix the pudding, pay atten- tion to the oven and see that it will be at the right degree of heat when required. All puddings of the nature of a custard require a very moderately heated oven, and should be placed in a baking tin with a little water round them to prevent the eggs curdling. Puddings containing suet, or other ingredients requiring thorough cooking, should also be put in a good moderate oven.

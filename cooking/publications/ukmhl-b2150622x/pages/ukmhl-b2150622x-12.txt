vi COOKERY FOR EVERY HOUSEHOLD Wherever possible, exact weights and measures have been given. The resources of the ordinary kitchen have been borne in mind, and simple substitutes are suggested for the more elaborate appliances. At the head of each section are given some general rules for the making of the dishes included therein. Much care has been taken to give a complete index, so that, even where the ordinary classification is not understood, anything in the book may be quickly found. As the majority of my readers may stand in need of some assistance in the compilation of their menus, a few specimens have been given at the end of the book. As attractively prepared food is so important to the health of everyone, and as it is so easy to rest upon oneâ€™s achievements and fall into a groove, I strongly urge all who are charged with the cooking for a household to try new dishes, so as to introduce more variety into the daily bill of fare.

A pinch of nutmeg. 1 table-sp. white wine. 1 tea-sp. chutney. Salt. Pepper. Croustades of bread. Lobster coral. Chop the lobster finely and pound it in a mortar or strong basin with the butter, bread-crumbs, wine, and seasoning. Make all into a smooth and softish paste, and season rather highly.

Cover the croustades with buttered paper and make them thoroughly hot in the oven. Then sprinkle with lobster coral, and serve at once. 2375.

Then add to this puree the egg well beaten, the chopped gherkin, and the cream whipped until stiff. Season to taste, then pour the mixture into very small dariole moulds that have been well greased and coated with browned biscuit-crumbs. Cover with greased paper and poach them carefully until firm to the touch. Then turn out and serve with hot tartare sauce poured round. 2376. Marrow Toast (Croutes a la Moelle) Beef marrow. Hot buttered toast. Seasoning. Have a marrow" bone broken or sawn in pieces by the butcher, so that the marrow may be removed easily. After removing it, cut it in small pieces and scald it in boiling water for 5 or 10 minutes. The simplest way to do this is to put the marrow into a frying basket or small strainer and to plunge it into a saucepan of boiling water, or to tie it in a piece of muslin; by either means it can be easily removed from the water. Drain it well, arrange it on small rounds or fingers of hot buttered toast, season with pepper, salt, and lemon juice, and break the marrow down with a fork. Place the croutes in the oven to become very hot, then sprinkle them with a little finely-chopped parsley, and serve very hot. 2377. Marrow Croustades (Croustades de Moelle) Beef marrow. Pastry croustades. Brown sauce. Prepare the marrow as in last recipe, and after scalding allow it to become cold. Then cut it in small pieces. Have ready some small and nicely- cooked pastry croustades (see Recipe 2248), put a very little good brown sauce at the bottom of each, then some marrow and more sauce on the top. Place the croustades in the oven to become thoroughly hot, sprinkle them with a little coral- line pepper, and serve at once. 2378. Mushroom Cassolettes (Cassolettes de Champignons) Make a ragout of mushrooms as directed in Recipe 516, and fill it into small butter cases or cassolettes (see Recipe 2252).

Frying batter. Choose small round mushrooms, remove the stalks, peel them, and wash and dry them carefully. Then lay them on a plate, season them with pepper, salt, a little chopped parsley and chopped shallots or chives, and a sprinkling of salad oil and lemon juice. Allow the mushrooms to lie with t0e seasoning about \ hour, then dip them in frying batter (Recipe 1861), and fry them in boiling fat to a golden brown colour. Drain well, pile up on lace-edged paper, and garnish with parsley and a little cut lemon. 2380. Mushroom Toast (Croutes aux Champignons) 3 or 4 oz. mushrooms. 1 oz. butter. Salt. Pepper. Lemon juice. 1 table-sp. brown or tomato sauce. 1 yolk of egg. 1 table-sp. cream. 6 or 7 croutes of bread. Any trimmings of mushrooms will do for this. Trim and chop them rather coarsely, put them into a small saucepan with the butter and seasoning, cover over and cook slowly about 10 minutes. Then add the sauce, which must be thick and well- flavoured, and the yolk of egg or cream. Stir over the fire until thoroughly hot, then pile the mixture

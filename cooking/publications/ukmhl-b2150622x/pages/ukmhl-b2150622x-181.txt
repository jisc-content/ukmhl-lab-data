Tomatoes (Tomates) The tomato or love-apple is strictly speaking a fruit and not a vegetable, but as it appears on our tables in place of a vegetable, it is always classed as such. There are several different kinds of tomato plant, some producing a red and others better than in its raw state, either au naturel, accompanied with oil, or oil and vinegar, or sliced and served as a salad. The home-grown tomatoes are best for serving raw, and the small bright red ones have perhaps the finest taste. For cooking purposes there is perhaps no vegetable which will lend itself to such a variety of treatment as the tomato. Cooked by itself either by baking, broiling, frying, or stewing, &c., it forms an ex- cellent vegetable and a good accompaniment to most meat dishes. It is also valuable for flavouring purposes in soups, stews, and sauces, while many a tasty dish owes its savour to the addition of a small piece of tomato, or a table-spoonful of tomato puree. Unripe tomatoes make a very good pickle or chutney. 578. Baked Tomatoes, 1 (Tomates Roties) Tomatoes. Butter. Pepper and salt. Choose the tomatoes, as far as possible, of moderate and equal size.

Boiled Tomatoes Choose small firm tomatoes and rather under, than over ripe. Wipe them and remove the stalks without damaging the skin in any way. Put them into a saucepan of boiling water slightly salted and let them boil slowly from 5 to 7 minutes. Then lift them out with a draining spoon, or a frying basket may be used for putting the tomatoes into and lifting them out of the water. After draining, place them in a hot vegetable dish and serve at once. A little plain or mattre dâ€™Jiotel butter (see Recipe 770) should be handed separately, the tomatoes being eaten from the skins, like a boiled egg, with a little butter, pepper, and salt put inside.

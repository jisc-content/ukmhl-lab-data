COOKERY FOR EVERY HOUSEHOLD 278 cover the saucepan closely and cook the contents in the oven, or by the side of the fire, until the chicken is quite tender. The time will depend very much upon the size and age of the bird. If necessary a little extra stock may be added during the cooking, but the tomatoes should not be made too liquid. When ready, lift the chicken on to a hot dish, and remove the trussing thread or string. Skim any superfluous grease off the tomatoes, add the sherry and parsley, taste if sufficiently seasoned, and pour round the chicken without straining. Or, the chicken may be garnished with watercress, and the tomato served separately. Celery or French beans would be a good accompaniment to this dish. Time to cook, If to 2 hours. Sufficient for 4 or 5 persons. 1130. Spring Chicken, Broiled Only a very young and tender chicken can be cooked in this way.

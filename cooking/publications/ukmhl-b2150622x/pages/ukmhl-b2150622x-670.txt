COOKERY FOR EVERY HOUSEHOLD 654 there is the possibility of making use of many richly shaded leaves of all sorts; bright-coloured berries can also be utilised, and look very effective along with bronze-coloured foliage. Winter gives us the ever popular chrysanthemum, which is now grown in such quantities, and in such a variety of shades and forms. They look best in tall jars or vases, and they require plenty of water, in fact they will keep best if left in a pail of water up to their head? at night. These flowers have a long reign, and they last until the forced or imported spring flowers again begin to appear. During Christmastime, holly should of course reign supreme, helped out with white and fragile Christmas roses, which form such a delicate con- trast to the brilliant and prickly holly. Fancy pots or baskets filled with ferns and forced scarlet tulips, and tied with a green or scarlet ribbon to match, are also seasonable at this time of the year.

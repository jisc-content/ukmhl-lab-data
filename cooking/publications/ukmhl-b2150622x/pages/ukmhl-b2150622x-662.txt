COOKERY FOR EVERY HOUSEHOLD 646 THE BOW.—This is a very simple and effective design, and it takes very little time to fold it. Either a square or oblong serviette may be used, and it does not require to be stiff. Have it folded in three, and lay it on the table with a single edge uppermost on the top. Turn over this single upper edge about 1 inch as indicated by dotted line A, Fig. 1, then over again by dotted line B, arranging the size of the folds so that they form a box pleat, as it were, right along the centre of the serviette. Fig. 2. Turn over so that the box pleat now lies underneath, fold double lengthwise, mark the centre, and open out. Next divide each end into three equal portions, mark the divisions well, and open out (see dotted lines in Fig. 3). Now turn over C on to D and then over again on to E. Do the same with the other end of the serviette, making the two sides meet in the centre, Fig. 4. Double backwards, when the serviette should appear as in Fig. 5. Now take hold of one of the double folds at F, and drawing it downwards in such a way as to form a diamond, tuck the point under the box pleat. Finish the other end in the same way and the design is complete, Fig. 6. THE FAN.—Take a square and rather stiff serviette, double it to find the centre and open out. Fold the two upper corners downwards to this centre mark, Fig. 1. Then double the two points A half-way back again, when they should appear as in Fig. 2. Now lay three tucks across the width of the serviette about 2 inches in depth (or two tucks only if it is a small serviette) and an equal distance apart as in Fig. 3. Next place the serviette lengthwise on the table, and pleat it in the mode of a fan from one end to the

SERVIETTE FOLDING 649 THE EMPRESS.—Take a square serviette, and fold it in four so as to form a smaller square. Lay it on the table with the four single points nearest to you. Fig. 1, make a mark across by dotted line and open out again. Now take the four points at A and roll them up one at a time towards this central mark, making one roll lie below the other. Fig. 2. Then take the two ends B and C and roll them round back- wards, making them overlap behind. Hold these two ends together with the thumb and finger, while with the other thumb and finger you take hold of point D, and bending it backwards, bring it right round, and tuck it in over the two joins held by the first finger and thumb. This forms a little pocket to hold the bread, and the Empress design is complete, Fig. 3. THE CARDINAL’S HAT .—The serviette does not require to be absolutely square for this design, an oblong-shaped one will do very well. Fold it in two and make a small double tuck in one end as in Fig. 1, then turn the serviette over and make the same tucks on the other end. Turn over again so that the upper tucks lie underneath at the top, and fold the two upper points at right angles to the centre as in Fig. 2. Turn once more from top to bottom and do the same with the two points which now lie at the top, when the serviette should appear as in Fig. 3. Double point A upwards so that it lies a little below point B, Fig. 4, and fold up the base or the lower portion again by dotted line in order to form a band. Now take up the serviette in the hands and, folding the two ends backwards, tuck them one inside the other and this completes the cardinal’s hat. Fig. 5. THE PALM.—This design is very similar to the orchid, only, the points are arranged rather differently. Take a square serviette and fold it in four in order to make a smaller square. Lay it on the table with the four single points towards you and double two only of the single points upwards to point A as in Fig. 1.

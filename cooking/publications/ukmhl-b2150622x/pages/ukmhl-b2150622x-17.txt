THE IMPORTANCE OF COOKERY There is perhaps no science which has done more for the health and happiness of mankind than that of good cooking. The provision of good and suitable food is a necessity to every form of life : it is required both to nourish the body and to keep it in good condition. Indeed, it is becoming more and more a recognised fact that health depends largely upon diet, and that cookery in its perfection is one of the most important factors in comfortable living. Unfortunately, we as a nation are very much behindhand in our ability to cook well.

Perhaps want of interest, want of daintiness, lack of discriminating taste, and above all, a desire to save trouble on the part of the average British cook, are at the root of the comparative inadequacy of our cooking. The French or Italian cook spares no trouble which will ensure good results—she takes a real pride in turning out good and appetising dishes. The British cook, on the other hand, is inclined to hurry through her work and expect the food to cook itself.

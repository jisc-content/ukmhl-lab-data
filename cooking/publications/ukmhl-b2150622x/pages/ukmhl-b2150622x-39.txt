THE KITCHEN, MARKETING, AND CARE OF FOOD 23 clean, as there is no smoke or soot to soil them, hence great saving of labour. 5. The loss of meat by shrinkage in cooking is only from 6 to 10 per cent., in comparison with a loss of from 25 to 33 £ per cent, which occurs in meat cooked in coal or gas ovens. The following table shows the saving effected in cooking by electricity, and it will be noticed that the cash saving is actually more than the cost of the electricity consumed, so that if coal or gas cost nothing it would still be cheaper to cook a joint of meat by electricity: Weight of Meat avail- able for serving.

Any ordinary cooking utensils may be used on electric stoves, but to get the best results it is pre- ferable to use those specially designed for electric cooking, and which can be obtained at practically the same cost. The bottoms of the vessels should be perfectly flat, in order that the whole surface may come in contact with the hot plate and thus avoid any waste of current. In addition to electric cookers, separate articles can be used, each provided with its own heater, such as electric kettles, coffee percolators, toasters, tea infusers, hot plates, boiling rings, breakfast cookers, irons, &c. All of these consume very little current, and many may be used from any electric lampholder.

PART III MARKETING HINTS There is nearly as much skill required in proper marketing as there is in preparing the food when once it has been purchased. It needs a little fore- thought and a good deal of common sense to buy just what is necessary for the needs of a household, to secure the best value for one’s money, and to be economical in the true sense of the word without being mean.

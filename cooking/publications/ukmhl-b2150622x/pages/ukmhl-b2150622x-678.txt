662 COOKERY FOR EVERY HOUSEHOLD Turbot and Brill are both served in the same fish right down to the back bone. Commence at the head end, and continue to the tail. Then cut slices across from the centre towards the sides of the fish, and detach them from the bone. Part of the fins and a little of the gelatinous skin should be served with each portion. Sole.—Cut through the whole length of the thick part, and then raise the fillet from each side. Then remove the bone and separate the other side into two fillets. Plaice.—If large, carve in the same way as a turbot; if small, according to directions given for sole. Small fish are either served whole or cut in two pieces.

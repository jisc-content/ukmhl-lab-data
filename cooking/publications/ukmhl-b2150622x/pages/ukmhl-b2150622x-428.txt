Trim round the edges and spread the jam mixture over the centre. Wet the rim of pastry with cold water and cover with the other piece of pastry. Press the edges well together and their trim again. Make one or two small holes on the top, mark round the rim with the back of a knife, and orna- ment the top with a few leaves made out of the scraps.

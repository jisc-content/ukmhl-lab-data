THE KITCHEN, MARKETING, AND CARE OF FOOD 11 to theiE high price they still remain luxuries, which only the wealthy can indulge in. Enamelled tin saucepans will be found most useful, but they must be bought in a good quality. The hard grey enamelled lining lasts better than the white, and will stand any amount of hard wear. The cheap make of this saucepan should be avoided unless it is only for boiling water, as the enamel very soon chips and breaks off, and they become positively dangerous to use. Stoneware saucepans and clay terrines, so dear to the heart of the French and Italian housewife, are coming more and more into favour in this country. There is nothing cleaner to work with, and they are excellent for all kinds of slow cooking, especially stewing and soup-making. Some of them are so ornamental that the food can be served in them, thus saving the trouble of dishing up and the subsequent loss of heat. When once a trial has been made of the lighter kinds of saucepans, there will seldom be a return to the heavy iron make, which are so heavy to clean, not to speak of the lifting. Choice of Kettle.—This depends on the kind of stove used. If for a kitchen range a strong block- tin or a wrought-iron one might be bought, but there is no need to have it very heavy, better to have two lighter and smaller kettles than one that is a labour to lift. A good enamelled ware is also nice, it is so easily cleaned. For gas stoves choose a kettle of a strong light make. Those with a cor- rugated bottom are considered the best, as this increases the heating surface, and the water will boil in a shorter time than in a kettle with an ordinary flat bottom. Kettles that boil over are very troublesome, and those that are guaranteed not to do this can now be bought. One of the newest inventions in the kettle line is the whistling kettle, which gives a shrill whistle as soon as the water boils, and summons one to the spot. The following list of kitchen utensils with ap- proximate prices has been drawn up for a small house or flat with one or two servants, and may prove suggestive for those about to furnish. The number of articles may be reduced to suit the circumstances of those who live in a very quiet way, on the other hand many extra utensils will be necessary in a house where a luxurious table is kept; but what has been said as regards quality remains true whether the house be large or small The list does not include jars and tins for keeping stores, nor crockery, &e., for servants’ table use, which must be supplied according to the number of servants kept and reserved for its special purpose : 8. d. 8. d. 1 Galvanised bath . 2 2 1 Wire sieve . . . i 2 1 Galvanised pail 1 2 1 Baking board . . 2 6 1 Tin enamelled basin 1 0 1 Chopping board X 0 1 Fish kettle . . . 3 3 1 Pot rest .... 0 3 1 Frying pan . . .

ORDER AND CLEANLINESS IN THE KITCHEN Order and Method.—These are two of the most prominent factors in the management of a kitchen. The old rule, “ A place for everything and every- thing in its place,” must be rigidly adhered to if order is to reign in this department, and it may be taken as a fact that if it doesn’t reign in the kitchen it won’t reign anywhere else in the house. It is very important that the kitchen be well arranged to start with, and that all utensils, stores, &c., be placed as near as possible to the place where they are to be used and handled. This will save unnecessary trotting backwards and forwards. Strength is often wasted in having to take journeys which might be avoided, as also in standing to do work which could be done just as well while sitting. In some kitchens one would think the aim had been to make the work as difficult as possible, and to try the patience of the cook by way of discipline —saucepans and moulds put on shelves quite out of reach without mounting on a chair, baking tins and lids at the back of a dark cupboard, quite inaccessible unless one goes down on one’s hands and knees to reach them, stores to be fetched from another far-distant cupboard each time they are wanted, &c. &c. It certainly requires some thought to arrange everything comfortably and conveniently, but with

A coffee mill or French chocolatiere is the correct thing for making chocolate. In this a small beater passes through the lid, and the chocolate can be whisked without any trouble while it comes to the boil. The quantity of chocolate used may be varied to suit individual taste; it also depends somewhat on the kind of chocolate used. Less milk and more water may also be used if preferred. A richer chocolate may be made by adding a well- beaten egg. Or it may be served with a spoonful of whipped cream on the top of each cup. 2974.

This seems to give the cocoa more flavour and substance than when the powder is simply mixed with boiling water poured over it.

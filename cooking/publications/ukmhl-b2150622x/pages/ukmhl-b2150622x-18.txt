COOKERY FOR EVERY HOUSEHOLD 2 Cookery schools have been established all over the country, where the science is not only taught in practice, hut where lectures are given on the nutritive value and chemistry of food as well. It would almost seem as if a new era were dawning in this respect, and that bad cooking will soon be a relic of the unenlightened past. It is to be hoped that the time is near when every woman—even she who can afford to maintain a large staff of trained servants—will have the science of cookery at her finger-ends, for the usefulness of a thorough knowledge of cookery and food values cannot be too highly estimated. Our bodies are either poisoned or nourished by the food we eat, and its proper choice and preparation are well worth the con- sideration of every woman who has to do with the life of the home. Truly it may be said that she who has mastered the art of cooking in all its branches has gone a long way towards solving the secret of good health for those fortunate people who reap the benefit of her culinary knowledge ; for good cooking means appetising food—appetising food means good digestion—and good digestion goes a long way towards the securing of perfect health.

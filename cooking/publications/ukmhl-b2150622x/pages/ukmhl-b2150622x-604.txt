COOKERY FOR EVERY HOUSEHOLD 588 2830. Sultana Cake (Good) l lb. flour. J lb. sultanas. 3 eggs. 4 to 6 oz. sugar. £ tea-sp. baking powder. 6 oz. butter. Flavouring to taste. Make in the same way as German Pound Cake (Recipe 2781). A little candied peel may be added if wished. Time to bake, about 1£ hour. Probable cost. Is. 2d. 2831. Swiss Roll, 1 3 eggs—their weight in flour and castor sugar. The weight of two eggs in butter. \ tea-sp. baking powder. A few drops of flavour- ing. 2 or 3 table-sps. jam. Cream the butter and sugar (see p. 552). Then add 1 egg and a little of the flour sieved, beat well, add another egg and a little more flour, beat again, and add the last egg with the remainder of the flour. The lightness of the roll depends upon the mixture being well beaten. Flavour to taste, and add the baking powder last. Spread the mixture on a flat tin of an oblong shape that has been lined with paper. (The mixture should not be more than a quarter of an inch in thickness, or it will not roll when baked.) Bake in a quick oven until nicely browned and firm to the touch. Have Bolling Swiss Boll ready a sheet of paper sprinkled with sugar, and turn the pastry on to it. Trim the edges with a sharp knife, and spread quickly with the jam slightly warmed. Then take hold of one end of the paper and roll up quickly. Place on a wire stand or sieve to cool. Notes.—Jam without stones should be used, and if very thick a little water may be added. Swiss roll may also be served hot as a pudding; a little custard sauce may be poured over or round it. Genoese pastry may be used for making a Swiss roll instead of the above mixture. It will be richer and better. Time to bake, 15 to 20 minutes. Probable cost, Is. 2832. Swiss Roll, 2 (Without Butter) 2 eggs. } lb. castor sugar. | lb. flour. 1 tea-sp. baking powder. Flavouring. 2 table-sps. jam. First grease a Swiss roll tin and line it with greased paper, allowing the paper to come a little above the rim of the tin. Put the eggs and sugar into a basin, and beat them together with a wooden spoon until light and frothy. Then sift in the flour very lightly, and add a little milk if necessary. This will depend on the size of the eggs ; the mix- ture must be soft enough to drop easily from the spoon. Add flavouring to taste, and the baking powder last of all. Bake and finish with jam as above. Time to bake, 15 minutes. Probable cost, 6d. 2833. Vinegar Cake J lb. flour. 2 oz. butter or dripping. 1 lb. sugar. 4 lb. raisins. 2 oz. candied peel. | tea-sp. baking powder. \ tea-sp. mixed spice. A pinch of salt. | tea-sp. carbonate of soda. 1 gill milk. 1 table-sp. vinegar. Sieve the flour, salt, baking powder and spice into a basin, and rub in the butter or dripping until free from lumps. Then add the fruit carefully prepared, mix it in, and make a well in the centre. Put the carbonate of soda into a cup, and mix it smoothly with the milk, then add the vinegar, and, while the mixture is still effervescing, pour it into the centre of the dry ingredients. Mix quickly and lightly, pour at once into a greased flat tin, and bake in a moderate oven until well risen, lightly browned and firm to the touch. Turn out to cool, and then cut in square pieces. Note.—The fruit may be varied to suit in- dividual taste. Time to bake, about \ hour. Probable cost, 8d. 2834. Walnut Cake J lb. fresh butter. £ lb. castor sugar. A pinch of salt. I lb. shelled walnuts. \ tea-sp. baking powder. 3 oz. fine flour. 4 whites of eggs. A pinch of nutmeg. Decoration.—Tea glace icing—a few half walnuts and crystallised violets or pieces of angelica. First put the walnuts on a tin in the oven for a few minutes, and when toasted, crush them rather small in a mortar, or with a bottle filled with water. Then prepare the cake mixture : Cream the butter in a basin, and, when very light and frothy looking stir in the prepared walnuts, sugar, salt, and nut- meg, and mix well. Have the whites of eggs beaten to a stiff froth, and stir them in very lightly and alternately with the flour. Add the baking powder at the last, and pour the mixture into a rather shallow tin lined with paper. Bake in a moderate and steady oven until the cake is nicely browned and firm to the touch. Turn out on a wire tray or sieve, and, when cold, coat with tea glace icing (see p. 589), and decorate with halves of walnuts and a few pieces of angelica or crystallised violets. Time to bake, about 1 hour. Probable cost. Is. 4d. 2835. Wedding Cake 1J lb. fresh butter. | lb. dark treacle. 1J lb. raw sugar. J pt. warm milk. 1 pt. brandy.

477 FRUIT COMPOTES AND PRESERVES 2177. Tomatoes These may be taken either as fruit or vegetable. Generally they come under the head of the latter, but as either they are most excellent bottled. They require a little more trouble than most other fruits to bottle successfully. They should be used small, and just coloured, as they have to be done at a high temperature, in order to ensure complete sterilisa- tion. In places where tomatoes are grown in quantities the small ones are often reserved for bottling. Pack in bottles as directed for plums, and cover with water. Bring the temperature up to 170°. Take out of the steriliser after an hour at this temperature, and leave for 24 hours; then repeat sterilisation at 170°. Again leave for two or three days, and again sterilise at the same tempera- ture. By doing them thus three times they will remain like fresh fruit, and can be kept for any length of time.

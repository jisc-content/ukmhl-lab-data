SERVIETTE FOLDING 643 THE ROXBURGH.—Take a square serviette and fold it in two, point to point as in Fig. 1. Then fold point B upwards to point A, and do the same with point G. Now take point D and fold it upwards about three-quarters of the way towards point E and turn up the fold thus made a second time so as to make a band at the foundation of the design. Fig. 3. Take hold of the ends F and G and turn them round backwards, making them overlap and fit into each other at the back. Stand up the serviette as in Fig. 4, and place the bread or roll underneath. The points may be curled over if wished. THE BISHOP’S MITRE.—Commence this in the same way as the cockade by taking a square serviette and folding it in four to make a smaller square. Lay it on the table with the double fold uppermost and the four single points at the bottom right-hand corner, and fold down the two upper corners to the centre and also two thicknesses of the material from the lower corners as indicated in Fig. 1. Now double up- wards point B to point A and turn the serviette right over from left to right. Fig. 2. Turn the corners C and D upwards to dotted line, making them meet in the centre E, when the serviette should appear as in Fig. 3. Next fold over points F and G by dotted fines. Fig. 3, bringing them to about I inch from the centre E on each side. Fig. 4, and finish by doubling upwards so that point H lies on the top of point I. Stand the serviette up, and open out as in completed design. Fig. 5. The bread or roll may be placed underneath.

COOKERY FOR EVERY HOUSEHOLD 644 THE TENT.—This is a very simple and quickly executed design, and one that does not crush the ser- viette. Have the serviette folded in three to begin with, double it to find the centre, make a mark and open out as in Fig. 1. Now fold the ends marked A and B over to this centre mark, when the serviette should appear as in Fig. 2. Then turn downwards points C and D by the dotted lines in Fig. 2, making them meet in the centre as in Fig. 3. Double over from left to right Fig. 4, and double upwards half the thin lower portion by the dotted line E, so as to make a stand to support the serviette. Do the same on the other side with the other half, and stand the serviette on end as in completed design, Fig. 5. THE ORCHID.—Take a square serviette, and fold it in four so as to make a smaller square. Lay it on the table with the four single points towards you as in Fig. 1, and double these four single points upwards to point A, giving the serviette the form of a triangle. Fig. 2. Now place the triangle with the point B nearest to you, and pleat from B to C in the style of a fan, but making the pleats moderately wide, Fig. 3. Hold these pleats firmly together at the base with the left hand, and then with the finger and thumb of the right hand pull down the four single points, giving them a curve as in the finished design. Fig. 4. This design is suitable for the ends of a table, and should be placed in a wine-glass «r tumbler.

651 SERVIETTE FOLDING as indicated by dotted lines in Fig. 2, and so that they project beyona the edges of the square. Fig. 3. Turn the doyley right over. Fig. 4, and fold the four centre points A back to corners B by dotted lines. The inner set of points may also be turned back if wished, or made to stand up as in Fig. 5. The above may be made into an oblong shape by turning back only two of the points on the first side, and pulling the other two further out. Fig. 6. m Take a perfectly square doyley or serviette, and fold it double from corner to corner, first one way and then the other, in order to find the centre A, Fig. 1. Fold in the two sides B until in a line with this centre mark, making them meet in the centre, mark the folds well and open out. Do the same with sides C, merely marking the folds again and opening out. The doyley should now be marked as in Fig. 2. Next take the centre of the four sides as marked at D D and E E in Fig. 2, and bend them inwards until they I 2 all touch at the centre A, Fig. 3. Open out the four wing-shaped portions thus produced, and lay them flat with the points to the centre as in Fig. 4. Turn back the four points now lying in the centre by the dotted lines, as marked in Fig. 4, and until they touch the corners F. The design is now finished, as shown in Fig. 6. Or, the four inner points may also be turned half-way back and this will produce a slightly different design. Fig. 6. This is a very suitable design for a fringed doyley, as all the fringe will be shown to advantage.

RICE, MACARONI, AND NUT DISHES 379 top with ground nuts, and bake in a moderate oven until well risen and firm to the touch. Serve as quickly as possible. Time to bake, 15 to 20 minutes. Probable cost, 6d. 1634. Nut Butter 1635. Walnut Roast 4 table-sps. ground wal- nuts. 4 table-sps. cooked un- polished rice. 2 table-sps. bread- crumbs. 2 eggs. A pinch of mace. 1 tea-sp. lemon juice. Pepper and salt. Almost any kind of nut may be used for this, such as almond, Brazil, pea nuts, or pine nuts, but Brazil nuts are perhaps the best. Remove all shell and brown skin from the nuts, and if they are at all damp, dry them in a very moderate oven. Then grind them in a nut-mill and pound to a smooth paste with a pestle and mortar. If wished sweet, a little honey may be added. Pack the butter into jars and use in place of ordinary butter. The rice must be well cooked and dry. Add to it the bread-crumbs and walnuts, season to taste, and moisten with the eggs well beaten. The mix- ture should be firm, but not too dry. Pack it into a well-greased mould or basin, cover and steam steadily at least one hour. When ready, turn out and serve with white, tomato, or any other suitable sauce. Probable cost, lOd.

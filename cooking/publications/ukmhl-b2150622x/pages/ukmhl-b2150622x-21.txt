5 HINTS TO READERS (1) Read through the introductory matter to each section, as it contains many instructions which are general, in order to avoid repetition in the individual recipes. (2) Before starting to make a dish, read the selected recipe carefully from beginninjg to end, and give the directions fair and just treatment. (3) If several dishes are to be made, commence with the one which will take the longest time to cook. (4) See that the tire is in good condition for the cooking required, and if the oven is needed, see that it is likely to be at a right degree of heat by the time it is wanted. (5) Gather together the materials and utensils required for each dish before beginning to work. (6) Let all the ingredients used be good of their kind, and be par- ticular as to their freshness. (7) Weigh and measure accurately and donâ€™t trust to rule of thumb. Theje should be no guess-work. An ounce or a table-spoonful more or less may spell ruin to all your labours. It is only after years of experience that quantities can be gauged accurately without weighing. (8) Do not of set purpose substitute one ingredient for another and expect the same results; although sometimes an expensive ingredient may be omitted without substantially interfering with the success of a dish. A note to this effect is added to many of the recipes. (9) Pay particular attention to the mixing in accordance with the directions, and give the greatest care to every detail in the preparation of each dish.

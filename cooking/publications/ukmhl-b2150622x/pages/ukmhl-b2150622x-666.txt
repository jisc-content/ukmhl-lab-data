COOKERY FOR EVERY HOUSEHOLD 650 Now turn the serviette right over from left to right, and double the two remaining points upwards to point A on this side, thus making a triangle, which has at the apex A two single points on each side of a double one. Fig. 2. Turn this triangle so that point B lies nearest to you on the table, and pleat in moderate-sized pleats and in the mode of a fan until point C is reached. Hold these pleats in position at the base, and pull down the points, two single ones on each side, giving them the form as in finished design. Fig. 3. Stand in a glass or tumbler. TO FOLD A PLATE DOYLEY OR SERVIETTE I Take a square serviette, and fold the points three times to the centre, turning the serviette each time. Now turn over, and the serviette will appear as in Fig. 1. Slip the fingers into the openings at A, and open out the little pockets as in Fig. 2. This makes a pretty design for holding scones or little rolls. Or, the pockets may be further opened and drawn backwards as in Fig. 3. Or, again, Fig. 3 may be turned on to the other side, and the two sets of points there found turned half-way backwards as in Fig. 4. This design may be varied very much to suit the dish for which it is intended. II Take a square doyley and fold it double, first one way and then the other, in order to find the centre, marking the folds well and then opening it out. Then fold the four corners into the centre, and press them well down. Fold the corners into the centre a second time on the same side, and press them down again. Fig. 1. Then turn the doyley right over and fold the four corners once into the centre on the second side. Fig. 2. Now turn the last set of points fully half-way back

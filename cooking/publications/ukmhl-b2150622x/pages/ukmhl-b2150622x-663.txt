Fold the serviette in three as in Fig. 1, and double and mark at dotted line in order to find the centre. Open out, and fold each end into this centre mark, Fig. 2. Now fold upwards by dotted line A and downwards by dotted line B, and the serviette should have the appearance of Fig. 3.

Open out, and the serviette should have the appearance of Fig. 1 with A as the central point. Now fold the four corners to the centre, turning them in and pressing them down as exactly as possible.

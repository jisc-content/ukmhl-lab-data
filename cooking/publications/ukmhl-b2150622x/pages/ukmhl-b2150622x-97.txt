FISH 81 be made smoking hot before the fish is placed in it, so that the outside is sealed up, and the juice and flavour retained. The fish must be prepared in the same way as for wet frying. Then place it in the hot fat and brown it first on one side and then on the other, turning it with a broad-bladed knife or fish slice. When cooked, lift out and drain on paper. Serve in the same way as above. Poaching This is one of the most delicate ways of cooking small fillets of fish. Take a very clean baking tin or shallow sauce- pan, grease it and lay in the fillets of fish, seasoning them with pepper, salt, and a little lemon juice. Barely cover them with fish stock (see p. 78) or with fish stock and white wine mixed. Lay a piece of greased paper over and cook in the oven or on the top of the stove until the fish is ready. A few minutes will be sufficient. Lift the fish carefully, draining it well, and use the liquid to make a sauce for covering it. In this way the flavour of the fish is retained, and the most delicate kind of fish need not be overcooked. Stewing This is one of the most tasty ways of preparing fish, and especially small fish. The fish may either be filleted and rolled or cut in pieces, or, if small, it may be stewed whole. The liquid part of the stew should be fish stock made from the bones and trimmings of the fish, or a mixture of wine and stock, or milk and water may be used if a very delicate stew is wanted. The fish is simmered in enough liquid to cover it until cooked, then lifted carefully out and kept warm, while the liquid in which it has been cooked is thickened and seasoned to make a sauce. This is then strained over the fish. Fish should always be stewed in an enamelled or earthenware saucepan, and especially if wine is being used. By this means of cooking none of the goodness of the fish is lost. Price of Fish It is impossible to give the exact price of any kind of fish, so much tends to make it vary; all that can be done is to give a fair average.

It is to be found both in fresh and in salt water, and its flesh is very much esteemed. Besides the recipes given below the larger fish may be cooked according to any of the recipes given for cooking salmon and the smaller ones like perch or trout. 180. Baked Bass 1 or 2 bass. Dripping or butter. Seasoning. Potatoes. Chopped parsley. Mustard sauce. Choose small or medium-sized bass, and wash and clean them carefully (see p. 77). Put a little butter Bass or good dripping inside the fish and season them with pepper and salt. Lay them on a greased baking tin and put some more fat or butter on the top. Bake in a good oven from 20 to 30 minutes according to the size of the fish, and baste now and again with the fat. A fish weighing 2 lbs. will re- quire 20 minutes and a larger one longer in pro- portion. Have ready some potatoes (a quantity suited to the size of the fish), cut in neat pieces ana , F

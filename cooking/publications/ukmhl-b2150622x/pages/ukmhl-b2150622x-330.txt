COOKERY FOR EVERY HOUSEHOLD 314 Mix them in about equal proportions with green peas, flageolet beans, French beans cut in \ inch lengths, and small pieces of cauliflower. The vege- tables should be cooked separately, and well drained before being put together. When prepared, heat them with a little butter and a seasoning of pepper and salt. The vegetables must be mixed very lightly so as not to break them. A little bechamel sauce may be used instead of butter for moistening, or if to be served cold, mix with a little mayonnaise sauce. Sometimes the vegetables instead of being mixed together are placed in separate heaps around the meat, and they then give a good effect of colour. Note.â€”Macedoine of vegetables may be bought ready prepared in tins or in bottles. 1317. Profiteroles Choux pastry. I Grated Parmesan. Chicken forcemeat. I Seasoning. Make half the quantity of choux pastry as given in Recipe 1450. It must be unsweetened and nicely seasoned with white pepper and salt. Sometimes a little grated Parmesan is added. Put the mixture into a forcing bag with a plain pipe of about J inch in diameter. Hold the bag perpendicularly and squirt out small pieces on a greased and floured tin. The pieces should not be larger than a small walnut and must be placed a little distance apart. Let them stand for 10 minutes, then with a small brush coat them over with beaten egg, or with yolk of egg and water. Bake in a moderate oven until a golden brown and quite dry. Prepare a nice chicken or other savoury mince and add to it a little grated Parmesan. Slit the profiteroles open at one side and fill them with the mince. Return them to the oven for a few minutes. Serve with soup or as directed. 1318. Rice Socle A rice socle is used for mounting a cold entree and to give it a raised appearance. It is not meant to be eaten. Take the quantity of rice required, wash it well, put it into a saucepan, well cover it with cold water and cook it until perfectly soft. The water must be absorbed and the rice form a thick paste. Then pound it in a mortar, form it into the shape desired, and allow it to cool. The moulding may either be done with the hands, or the rice may be pressed into a mould. If the socle is required for a hot entree, it should be brushed over with beaten egg and browned in the oven. Note For garnishes for sweet dishes, see under Puddings and Cakes.

SOYERâ€™S PAPER-BAG COOKERY 25 an accident occurs, the bag should be imme- diately taken out and placed inside another Bag and left a few minutes longer to rectify any loss that the food may have sustained in the meantime. Care, again, should be exercised in taking the bag out of the oven. A plate should be placed gently under the bag about a couple of inches and the bag drawn completely on to the plate with the fingers. The bag should be ripped open from the top and the frag- ments thrown at once away.

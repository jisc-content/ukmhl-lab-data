8 SOYER’S PAPER-BAG COOKERY on mere theory but long and varied expe- rience. Some years ago I was chef to the Dowager Duchess of Newcastle. I had long been ac- customed to treat small articles en papillottes, a system with which most connoisseurs are familiar. I would take, for example, a piece of cooked fish, and, enveloping it in a sheet of foolscap carefully trimmed to the required size, thrust it into a very hot oven. This im- parted to the fish the flavor of the paper — a taste which, for obvious reasons, is dan- gerous. One day, having covered a piece of fish with foolscap, I instructed the kitchen-maid to add the sauce. She put in too much. By-and-by the paper vessel began to bubble up, and be- fore I could interfere it exploded with a bang. When I came to examine the fish I found that it was beautifully tender. This gave me an idea. “ I wonder whether I could cook by steam ? ” I said to myself. Without a mo- ment’s hesitation I put some meat, vegetables, and a little water into an envelope, and laid it on the iron shelf in the oven. The inevi- table happened. The paper got burnt, and soon afterwards it exploded.

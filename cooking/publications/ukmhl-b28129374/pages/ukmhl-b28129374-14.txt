6 SOYER’S PAPER-BAG COOKERY needs. American equivalents have been sub- stituted for culinary words and phrases which are peculiar to England. A word must be added in commendation of M. Soyer’s recipes. They have the great virtue of simplicity, so that any reader can understand and practise his directions. More- over, they are adapted to the use of house- holds in which rigid economy must be ob- served, and are equally well suited to the Menage in which expense is no consideration. They are, therefore, a boon to the humblest housewife and an inspiration to the chef of the most elaborate establishment. Virginia Terhune Van de Water.

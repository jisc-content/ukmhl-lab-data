SOYER’S PAPER-BAG COOKERY 43 Put these on the bottom of the paper-bag, which should be well buttered. Lard your sweetbread (if desired). Round it put three or four mushrooms, two or three tomatoes (skinned and all seeds removed). Add a tablespoonful of stock, Madeira, or sherry, according to taste. Seal bag. Put on broiler. Allow <?5 minutes in hot oven. If color and thick sauce are desired, mix a quarter of a teaspoonful of arrowroot with the vegetable, and a little burnt-sugar color- ing. When you open the bag, remove the sweetbread gently. Place on dish. Remove tomatoes, mushrooms, etc., and place round it. Put the whole of the contents of the bag (juice included) in a strainer and press with a wooden spoon into a clean, hot basin standing in boiling water, then pour the gravy thus obtained over the sweetbread.

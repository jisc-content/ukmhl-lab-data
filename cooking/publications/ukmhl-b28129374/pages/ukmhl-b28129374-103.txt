SOYER’S PAPER-BAG COOKERY 95 I gave him full instructions, and late that night he rang me up on the telephone. “Was it a success?” I asked, although I knew the answer beforehand. “A success? I should just think so. The old boy was delighted. Helped himself twice to everything, and asked who my cook was! I’m thinking of giving a little supper party next week; I suppose you could let me have one or two more recipes, eh ? ” So for the convenience of bachelors gener- ally I give the following recipes: — Filleted Soles Fines Herbes.— Take four or six fillets of sole, dust lightly with salt and white pepper, and sprinkle also lightly with finely minced parsley, chopped mushrooms, and a very little minced shallot. Add the tiniest possible squeeze of strained lemon juice. Put a bit of butter on each fillet and slip them gently into a well-greased bag, add quarter of a glass of sherry. Bake in a mod- erately hot oven■ for 15 to 18 minutes. Cut open the bag very carefully with a pair of clean scissors, and slip the fish and the sauce which will have formed during cooking on to a very hot dish. Send to table at once.

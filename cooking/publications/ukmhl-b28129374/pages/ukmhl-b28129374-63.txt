SOYER’S PAPER-BAG COOKERY 55 livers on top of the chops; put the peas and tomato round as a border, and send to table at once. Note—The bacon, which is only used as a flavoring agent, must not be sent to table. I have found that any butcher will be glad to supply the chicken liver at a min- ute’s notice. Chops a l’lndienne.—For those who like hot things the following may be recommended: — Take a teaspoonful of salted flour, mix with it thoroughly a heaped large teaspoonful of good curry powder — two if liked. Grease a bag very thoroughly. Have ready from four to six chops trimmed as directed be- fore. Dust these with the flour. Put them into the bag, and add to them a heaped des- sertspoonful of finely chopped spring onions and half a pint of chicken or other well- flavored stock. Fold and cook gently for three-quarters of an hour. Dish up on hot dish. Stir the sauce round well and serve. If liked, the flour and curry powder can be mixed with the cold stock instead of being dusted on to the chops. Water will do when stock is not to hand, but in this case add a little more salt.

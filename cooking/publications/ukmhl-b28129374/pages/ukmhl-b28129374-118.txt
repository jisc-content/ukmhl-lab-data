INVALID COOKERY Sweetbread Mackenzie.— Blanch and trim a good sized sweetbread, make a little mire- poir of vegetables, paying attention to the color of the vegetables and seeing that they do not brown. Cut the sweetbread across the center, but do not halve it. Pound i oz. of pistachios and lay them in the slit of the sweetbread. Cover the sweetbread with the prepared vegetables and place in a well-but- tered bag. Cook in a slow oven for 30 min- utes. Dish the sweetbread, place the other ingredients in a fine sieve and lightly press the gravy through on to the sweetbread. Chicken and Rice Tea.— Chop up half a raw chicken, wash a tablespoonful of rice in cold water and mix with the chicken. Wash a teaspoonful of pearl barley and add with a quarter of a pint of cold water. Put the whole in a small paper-bag and cook for 40 to 55 minutes in a slow oven. no

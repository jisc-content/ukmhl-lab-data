SOYER’S PAPER-BAG COOKERY 91 bake in the oven for 10 minutes. Dish up and serve as hot as possible. Other dried fish are excellent prepared in the same way. Jambon Milanaise.— Take some six slices of either raw ham or breakfast bacon, machine cut if possible, take also half a pint of cold boiled peas, and, if to hand, half a dozen cold boiled new potatoes. Put the slices into the bag and cook them. Then take out and add the peas and the potatoes, the latter first thinly sliced, and cook in the ham fat till very hot. Empty out gently on to a hot dish and pour over the peas half a pint of very hot well- seasoned tomato pulp or tomato catsup, which- ever is preferred. The peas and potatoes should be arranged as a border with the slices in the middle. When they can be had half a dozen chicken livers are a great improvement to this dish.

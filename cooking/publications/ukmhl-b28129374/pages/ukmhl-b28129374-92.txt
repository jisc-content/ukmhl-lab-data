84 SOYER’S PAPER-BAG COOKERY Mouton Grille a l’lndienne.— Underdone mutton for which no other use can be found may be turned into a very nice broil as fol- lows : Cut a sufficient number of slices from a leg of mutton, and cut into rounds or squares. Melt a piece of butter about the size of a large walnut on a plate in the oven. Add to it a teaspoonful of Harvey’s Sauce, and salt to taste. Mix thoroughly, and leave the slices of mutton in the mixture for at least an hour before they are required. Have ready a number of fried croutons, allowing one to each piece of mutton; place the lat- ter on these, put them in a well-greased paper- bag. Put bag on broiler, cook for 8 minutes and serve at once, accompanied by Portugaise sauce — passed separately — and mashed po- tatoes. Instructions for Portugaise sauce is given in the first recipe. Beef and veal, but more especially the former, are also excellent, treated after the foregoing fashion. Horseradish sauce should be served with these in place of sauce Portu- gaise. Cold Fish.— Take off all flesh from the fish bones. Mash up a few potatoes. Season

SOYER’S PAPER-BAG COOKERY 57 Economical Stew.— Grease the bag well. Wash il/2 lbs. of fresh pieces of mutton well. Dust them, thickly with salted barley flour and slightly with pepper. Peel and slice I lb. of onions and 2 lbs. of potatoes thinly. Wash them well. Put them wet into the bag with the meat in layers. Then add about half-a- pint of water. Put the bag on the broiler. Cook slowly for 2 hours. Dish up on a hot dish, and stir round well. Chicken, Game, etc., broiled quickly.— Split the chicken down the middle. Well open. Pass two skewers longways to prevent the chicken from curling. Take and break one very fresh egg. Beat well.

With a brush glaze the whole chicken with the mixture. Then place the breadcrumbs all round. Butter the bag well all over the inside. Place chicken in it. Seal up, and place on the broiler. Be very careful not to tear the bag with the skewers. Allow 35 to 40 minutes in a hot oven.

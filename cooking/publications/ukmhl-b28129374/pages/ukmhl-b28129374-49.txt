Veal Chop.—Same as above. Allow 10 to 25 minutes in very hot oven, according to thickness of chop. Sausages.—Same as above. Allow 20 minutes in very hot oven. Fillet of Beef.— Take a slice of iy2 ins. thick and well trimmed. Cut in two or three pieces horizontally. Trim a little, by paring off the corners, to make each piece round. Season with salt and pepper as desired. But- ter the paper-bag well, also the fillet of beef.

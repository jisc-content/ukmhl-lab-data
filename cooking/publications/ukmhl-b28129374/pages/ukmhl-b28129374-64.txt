56 SOYER’S PAPER-BAG COOKERY Chops for the Nursery.—Every mother is aware of the nourishing properties of bar- ley, but not every child can be got to take the barley in the shape of porridge. The ap- pended recipe solves the difficulty by giving the barley at dinner instead of at breakfast time. Soak 4 oz. thoroughly washed pearl barley for 24 hours. Have ready a well greased bag, six small peeled whole onions (select those about the size of a small Tan- gerine) and the requisite number of chops. Free the chops from all but the smallest quantity of fat, dust them with salt, place them in the bag. Add to them the onions and the barley, salt to taste, and if any of the water in which the latter was soaked re- mains, add this also. If not, add half a pint of chicken stock prepared as before indi- cated. Fold and clip the bag. Place on broiler, and cook gently in an only moderately hot oven for an hour and a half. Empty out on to a dish and serve. Veal can also be cooked in this way, and for invalids the dish can be most highly recommended, as it con- tains nothing to upset even the most delicate digestion.

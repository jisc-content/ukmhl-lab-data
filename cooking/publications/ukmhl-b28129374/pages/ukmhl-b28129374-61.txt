SOYER’S PAPER-BAG COOKERY 53 spread them on both sides with a layer of foie gras. Have ready some freshly fried breadcrumbs. Sprinkle these lightly on each side of the chops. Take care not to overdo this. Place gently in a D size bag. Fold, clip, place on broiler in the oven. Cook for 20 minutes. Dish up the peas and potatoes as a border. Put the chops in the middle. Pour their own gravy over them and serve at once. Chops aux Navettes.—Take half a bunch of young French turnips, peel them, trim them all as nearly as possible to one size. Dust them with salt and pepper. Take a pound and a half of mutton chops. Trim as above directed. Dust well with celery salt and a very little white pepper, and some salted flour. Grease a bag well. Put in half the turnips, then the chops, then the rest of the turnips. Add half a pint of chicken stock. Fold the bag, clip; place on the broiler and cook slowly for an hour and a half. Dish up on a hot dish, with the turnips as a border. Pour the sauce — which will be of a delicate creamy consistency and taste — over, and serve with asparagus, handed separately.

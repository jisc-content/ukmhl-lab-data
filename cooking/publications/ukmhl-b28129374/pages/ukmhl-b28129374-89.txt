SOYER’S PAPER-BAG COOKERY 81 lemon juice. Mix lightly but very thoroughly, and then form into balls about the size of a small Tangerine. Make an aperture in each as carefully as possible and insert a small spoonful of either apricot jam or marmalade in the middle; close up neatly, then dip in egg and breadcrumbs. Have ready a well- greased bag, put the beignets in, and cook for 15 minutes. Take out and serve at once. Pommes a la Mascotte.— Take a dozen large apples, as nearly of a size as possible. Peel very thinly, and remove the cores with an apple corer. Roll the apples in well-beaten egg and then in plenty of confectioner’s sugar. (Add a few drops of vanilla to the beaten egg.) Arrange the apples neatly in a well- greased paper souffle case, put it into a bag, and bake for half an hour in a moderately hot oven. When done, fill the centre of each with some strained apricot jam. Pour a little apri- cot sauce round the base and serve at once. For the sauce, place three tablespoonfuls of strained apricot jam in a small clean stew-pan. Make very hot, then stir in well-whipped cream, and use as directed.

SOYER’S PAPER-BAG COOKERY 51 be used in place of brown or sauce Madere, as otherwise the croustade would be too rich for most people’s liking. If a bag is used for this rechauffe it is impossible to tell it fiotn freshly cooked game. Chops a la Paysanne.—Take from four to eight chops, mutton or lamb. Trim them of all superfluous fat. Scrape the bones neatly. Dust them with a little minced shal- lot and spiced seasoning, i.e., pepper, salt and a tiny grate of nutmeg, and a little celery salt mixed. Grease a bag thickly. Put in the chops. Add to them half a pint of half- cooked peas, an ounce of bacon (flank will do), cut small, a pound of new potatoes, and half a pint of stock or water. Note.—If four chops only are used a gill of stock will be sufficient. Fold over the bag. Put on the broiler and cook in a moderately hot oven for an hour. Open bag. Empty out into a very hot dish. Arrange the peas and potatoes into a border with a heated fork. Stir up the gravy, and send to table. Note that the potatoes must be also parboiled before being put into the bag. For lamb chops 30 minutes is sufficient time to allow.

SOYER’S PAPER-BAG COOKERY 73 Savory Oysters.— Take two tablespoon- fuls of white sauce, one teaspoonful of grated Parmesan cheese, one tablespoonful of cream, the liquor from the oysters and seasoning to taste. Take half a dozen deep oyster shells. Put a little of the above mixture at the bot- tom; then put the raw bearded oyster in the middle. Add a little more of the sauce on the top, with a little breadcrumbs and a small piece of butter. Place your bag on the broiler. Put your oysters carefully inside. Seal up, and allow 8 minutes in a very hot oven. Cheese Biscuit.— Take 4 oz. of flour, 3 oz. of butter, 1 yolk of egg, 3 tablespoonfuls of cream, 1 oz. of grated Parmesan cheese, 3 tablespoonfuls of water, and a pinch of cay- enne pepper. Mix up gently and form a paste. Roll to the thickness of an ordinary biscuit, and cut to any shape. Place in paper- bag, arranged so as not to touch each other. Allow 10 to 12 minutes in hot oven. This biscuit will keep for months in a dry place, and with it any kind of savory can be served.

SOYER’S PAPER-BAG COOKERY 97 minced tarragon. Mix all together and put into the bag with the bird. Cook gently for 65 minutes. Open bag. Slip bird and crumbs out gently on to a hot dish and send to table with new potatoes and salad. Note that the asparagus, which forms a course by itself, is cooked in the same way as the green peas. For the salads, the only things not cooked in the bag, well wash and dry a head of let- tuce. Tear, do not cut, into pieces of a suit- able size. Rub a bowl with a split clove or garlic, put in the salad. Add pepper and salt to taste, and oil and vinegar in the proportion of two tablespoonfuls of oil to one of vinegar. Mix thoroughly, and just before serving add a small orange freed from skin, pith and seeds, and cut into small squares.

Hull the strawberries and peel and slice the apple very thinly. Mix all well together in a deep bowl. Add to them the contents of a small bottle of raspberry syrup

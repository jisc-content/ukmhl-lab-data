SOYER’S PAPER-BAG COOKERY 29 Smoked Haddock.— Clean a smoked had- dock weighing about 2 lbs., season with cay- enne pepper to taste, but do not use any salt. Pour two large tablespoonfuls of milk over the fish, and cover it with a little white sauce. Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese, a few bread- crumbs, and enough melted butter to moisten. Place the whole in a well-buttered paper-bag, seal up, and cook for 20 minutes in a very hot oven. Stuffed Fresh Haddock.— Chop a cooked onion and mix it with three tablespoonfuls of breadcrumbs. Add 1 oz. of butter, salt, and pepper to taste, a little chopped parsley, and one egg. When thoroughly mixed stuff the fish with the mixture, butter a paper-bag, roll the fish in flour, place in the bag, dot over with small pieces of butter, seal up, and cook for 20 minutes. Haddock a la Royale.— Take from four to six fillets of fresh haddock. Spread them with butter. Dip in seasoned flour, and then in grated cheese. Put into a well-greased bag, and add to them a little more than a gill of milk. Cook gently for from 15 to 20 minutes, according to thickness of fillets. Dish up on a hot dish and serve.

42 SOYER’S PAPER-BAG COOKERY Place round the fillet; add one or two table- spoonfuls of any kind of sauce (this is purely a matter of taste). Put on broiler. Allow io to 15 minutes in very hot oven. A large fillet of beef or steak, plain or garnished, can be cooked in a buttered or greased paper-bag, but will require 15 to 20 minutes in very hot oven, according to size. It will turn out well broiled, with all the beau- tiful gravy retained. Escalop of Sweetbreads.— Trim sweet- bread and cut into four pieces. Trim four large mushrooms and tomatoes. Roll the sweetbread in flour, and put it between the mushrooms and tomatoes. Well butter your paper-bag, and arrange the above nicely in the middle. Place one teaspoonful of bread- crumbs on top. Cover with a slice of fat bacon or ham, cut very thin. Flavor with sweet herbs as desired. Seal bag, and put on broiler in hot oven. Allow 20 to 25 minutes. Sweetbreads (Fancy Method).—Half a small onion, one slice of carrot, a little ham (fat and lean), and a little of the trimming, all cut into small dice. A small bunch of sweet herbs and thyme, parsley and bay leaves.

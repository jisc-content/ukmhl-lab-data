SOYERâ€™S PAPER-BAG COOKERY 109 tatoes round as a border, and pour the gravy over the potatoes. Jam buns are a tremendous saving of trou- ble when the housewife is very busy on a Saturday. Get half a dozen stale buns. Split them open. Pour a little boiling milk or water over them. Spread thickly with golden syrup. Make very hot in a bag (greased).

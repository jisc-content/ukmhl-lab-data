SOYER’S PAPER-BAG COOKERY iox to which a little pepper and salt have been added — on both sides. Now grease the large bag thickly with beef dripping. Take the po- tatoes out of their bowl. Do not dry them, but sprinkle them lightly with the seasoned flour. Then take the potatoes, carrots, tur- nips, and onions, and mix them all well to- gether, sprinkling them with a very little salt. Take a handful of this mixture and some dumplings, and put them into the bottom of the bag. Then put in the flank of beef. Press it in as tightly and as closely to the vegetables as possible, and if the bag admits put a few vegetables on top and under the joint. Add the remainder of the vegetables, etc., and close the bag. Light the oven gas beforehand, let it get as hot as it can for eight minutes. Then place the paper-bag on the broiler, put the broiler on the shelf of the oven, and close the door. Turn the gas down half way, and leave the hag in for from an hour and a-half to two hours. Then take out, empty into a very hot dish as gently as possible. Stir well with a spoon which has been dipped in boiling water. You will then have a dinner fit for a king.

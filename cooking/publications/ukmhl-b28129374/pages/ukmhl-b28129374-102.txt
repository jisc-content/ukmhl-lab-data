94 SOYER’S PAPER-BAG COOKERY He gave me a most unforensic wink. “ You bet. What a lark! I’ll have Briggs up to help me.” Briggs is his best chum — a most lethargic youth. “ He can watch the things and see they don’t boil over.” “ They don’t want any watching. You just grease the bag, and in some cases the piece of meat or fish. Turn on the gas or the electric stove for eight minutes, and they do them- selves after that; and then when they’re done you turn them out gently on to a hot dish and eat them.” “ I have a genius for eating,” he interrupted, frivolously, as he made a grab at a pile of bags. “ How many shall I want? ” “ One only for each dish,” said I, rescuing the precious things with haste from his clutches. “ Now be sensible, if you can, for a minute.” And I proceeded to give him the following menu: — Filleted Soles, fines herbes. Sweetbreads au naturel. Green Peas. Roast Fowl. Savory Crumbs. New Potatoes. Salad. Asparagus. Fruit Salad. Coffee.

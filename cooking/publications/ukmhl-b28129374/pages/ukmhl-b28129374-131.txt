SOYER’S PAPER-BAG COOKERY 123 It is not given to everyone to prefer cold food to hot, nor for a good many people is cold food as digestible as hot. Moreover, the cold menu does not allow of the variety which is not only charming but essential to any dietary which is to do something more than merely satisfy the cravings of hunger. A man who dines daily on the same food we look upon as eccentric because he is discarding the conventional idea of varying the daily fare. Convention is the wisdom we inherit from our ancestors. It is the concentrated experience of the past, and it is the concentrated ex- perience of the past that leads us to vary the menu of our principal meals. The Soyer system means a vast increase in properly cooked hot meals in small houses, and a general relief from the tyranny of the cold collation which is often a drawback to the joy of a day spent in the open. In every part of London where the workers are working away from home you will see in humble eating houses the legend “ Hot meals served here ” boldly displayed. The hot meal was the beginning of civiliza- tion; it meant the passing of man from the savage state.

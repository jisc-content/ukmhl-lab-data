SOYER’S PAPER-BAG COOKERY 13 the kitchen at Brooks’s Club to make a series of experiments. I started with 18 lb. of beef, and it came out of the oven perfect in every respect. Then I turned my hand to a stew containing mutton and vegetables, and again the result fulfilled my highest expectation. It was the same with the many French dishes which I tried. Always the paper-bag im- proved the flavor, lessened the time neces- sary for cooking, and reduced the shrinkage. At home, also, I was exceedingly busy. I could not rest in my bed, and often I would get up at two o’clock in the morning in order that I might put my paper-bag to some fresh test. I cooked a great variety of articles, not- ing most carefully how long each took, and in what temperatures the best results were ob- tained. Upon these observations I have based in large measure the recipes contained in these pages. I am not really surprised at the interest which the new cookery has aroused. Clearly, it is calculated to effect a decided improvement in the health of the nation. What housewife has not had to lament the fact that her meat has been badly cooked, or that the cooking has involved a quite prodigious amount of labor?

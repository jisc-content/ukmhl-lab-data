SOYER’S PAPER-BAG COOKERY 67 Hitherto the vegetables of the ordinary cook have been a byword for all that is tasteless and unappetizing, and thus they have been robbed of the popularity to which their food- value entitles them. Vegetarian and meat- eater alike know and regret that by ordinary methods of cooking much that is best in vege- tables, both for the palate and the health, are boiled out into the water and thrown away. Medical men tell us how valuable are the salts and other constituents of vegetables thus wasted. Little medicine would be needed if we included in our diet these juices, which form the choice flavor of the vegetables. Up to the present we have thrown Nature’s physic to the dogs — or, at any rate, down the kitchen sink. But with the vegetables cooked in bags nothing is lost. All the food-value and all the flavor are retained. The cooking is easier, without smell, and the result will be to place vegetables in that honored place which they should occupy on every well-served table. This is a matter which the ordinary house- holder and the “ Food Reformer ” alike have at heart.

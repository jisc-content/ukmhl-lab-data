18 SOYER’S PAPER-BAG COOKERY clean kitchen for the homes of the people.” With such testimony, and the general assent of thousands of ladies who have attended my public demonstrations, carried on before their eyes, I feel justified in claiming the serious attention of the community to the subject and a trial of the recipes which, after much ex- perience, I have prepared for my paper-bag. I am indebted to the press for the publicity given to my system of cooking. Within a few days it was thus made known far and wide all over the country. I am also indebted to the editor of the Lon- don Daily Chronicle, to Mr. G. R. Sims, Dr. Charles Reinhardt, and Mrs. Alfred Praga, the well-known cookery expert and writer, for permission to reproduce articles which they wrote on my system in that paper. Nicolas Soyer.

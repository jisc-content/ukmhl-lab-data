58 SOYER’S PAPER-BAG COOKERY Salmi de Caneton.—Take a cold roast duck and joint it neatly. Place the carcass, giblets, bones, etc., in a clean, enamelled iron stewpan; add to them a couple of sage leaves or a little powdered sage, a large onion stuck with a clove, a pinch of powdered sweet herbs, and half-a-pint of stock. Bring to the boil, skim carefully, and then draw the pan to the side of the fire and simmer very slowly until the goodness is fairly extracted. Then strain through a hair sieve into a clean saucepan, place on the fire, and reduce about one-third. Add salt and pepper to taste, the peel from half-a-dozen French olives, and half a glass of port. Meanwhile grease a bag thickly, place in it the joints of the duck, and cook for io min- utes. Remove the bag from the oven and pour the gravy in. Close the bag and make it very hot for io minutes. Then dish up on a hot salmi dish and serve,, garnished with fried croutons and accom- panied by chipped or straw potatoes. Any kind of game may also be rechauffed after this recipe.

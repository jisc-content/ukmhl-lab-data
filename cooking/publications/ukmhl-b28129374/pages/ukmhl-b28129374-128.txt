120 SOYERâ€™S PAPER-BAG COOKERY roasting, boiling, frying, broiling and baking. Roasting is a process which requires consid- erable care and attention on the part of the cook or the roast not only loses much of its quality, but also a considerable amount of its flavor. In boiling the meat is deprived of some of its nutritive qualities by the removal of a por- tion of its soluble constituents; the albumen and the gelatin are acted upon, the former be- ing solidified and the latter converted into a gelatinous substance. If meat, therefore, is boiled too long or too fast, we get, in meat such as beef, a hard and indigestible mass, and in meat such as veal a gelatinous sub- stance equally injurious to the digestive or- gans. In frying, the heat is applied through the medium of boiling oil or fat, which is ren- dered empyreumatic, and, therefore, extremely liable to disagree with the delicate stomach. In baking, the substance is heated in a con- fined space, which does not permit the escape of the fumes arising from it, and by retaining its juices, is rendered not only more tender, but more savory than by any of the other processes.

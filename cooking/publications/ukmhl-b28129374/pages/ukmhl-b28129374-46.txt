38 SOYER’S PAPER-BAG COOKERY Whitefish la Normande.— Place two skinned whitefish in a buttered bag. Place half-a-dozen bearded oysters between them, and add half-a-dozen sliced mushrooms. Mix 2 ozs. of butter with a large teaspoonful of flour, add a few shelled shrimps and a little anchovy paste. Place on the whitefish. Pour in two tablespoonfuls of white wine. Seal up in bag and cook for 15 minutes. After placing the fish on a dish, squeeze a little lemon juice over it. Note.— Clean the mush- rooms first with a bit of flannel and a little salt. Whitefish Fines Herbes.— Take two whitefish of fair size, get the fishmonger to bone them. Fill the cavity with half-a-tea- spoonful of mixed finely minced chives or shallot and parsley, season to taste with salt and pepper and a tiny squeeze of lemon juice. Put into a well-greased bag, and bake for 75 minutes. Then dish up on a very hot dish, pour the liquor from the fish into the center of each, and serve at once. Haddock and fresh her- rings are also excellent when cooked in this way.

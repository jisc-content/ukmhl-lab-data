20 SOYER’S PAPER-BAG COOKERY general use of the bag in place of the ordinary saucepan, without any attention to the condi- tions that are essential to good cooking. Good cooking requires time, care, attention to de- tail, taste, and a temperature suited to the particular dish being cooked. While the paper-bag system is labor- and time-saving, as well as affording more nutritive and ap- petizing effects than the present, it does not abrogate any of the rules that apply to effi- cient work at the kitchen-table. A stew must be made up of the ingredients that consti- tute a stew, and proportioned to the number for whom it is required. The same conditions apply to this system. Let me, therefore, go over as minutely as I can—• The Bag.— Specially prepared bags should be used. Without them the method cannot be practiced with assurance of success. The bag should be made of materials that guar- antee its purity. It should be odorless, and its purity a guarantee that nothing injurious can possibly be imparted from it to the food cooked in the bag.

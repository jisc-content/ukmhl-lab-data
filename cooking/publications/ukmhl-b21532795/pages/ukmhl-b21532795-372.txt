•296 DOMESTIC COOKERT, ^rey. The pied and dark-coloured are not bo good. 'J'hirty days is generally the time the goose sits, but in warm •weather she ■will sometimes hatch sooner. Give them plenty of food, such as scalded bran and light oats; and as soon as the goslings are hatched, keep them housed for eight or ten days, and feed them with barley- meal, bran, curds, &c. For green geese, begin to fatten them at six or seven weeks old, and feed them as above. Stubble geese require no fattening if they liave the run of good fields. Turkies Are very tender when yonng.

PICK LES. J99 those you have pickled; throw a handful of salt amon<^ Tv ‘ a ^eat deal of liquor, which you must strain; and put to it four ounces of slialots, two cloves of garlick, a good deal 01 pepper, ginger, mace, cloves, and a few bay leaves— boil and skim v^ry well. When cold, cork close. In two months boil it up again with a little fresh spice and a stick of horse-radish, and it will then keep the’ )ear; which mushroom ketchup rarely does, if not boiled a second time. II Acfc/i«p, qf the finest sort. Boil or simmer a gallon of the expressed juice of wal- nuts when they are tender, and skim it well; then put in two pounds of anchovies, bones and liquor, ditto of shalots, one ounce of cloves, ditto of mace, ditto of pep- per and one clove of garlick. Let all simmer till the slnalots sink : then put the liquor into a pan till cold- bottle and divide the spice to each. Cork closely, and tie a bladder over. ■' ’ It will keep twenty years, and is not good the first Be very careful to express the juice at home; for it b rarely unadulterated, if bought. Some people make liquor of the outside shell when the nut is ripe; but neither the flavour nor colour is then so fine. Cockle Ketchup. Open the cockles, scald them in their own liquor- add a little water when the liquor settles, if you have’ not enough; strain through a cloth, then season with every savoury spice; and if for brown sauce, add port anchovies, and garlick-if for white, omit these, and put a glass of sherry, lemon-juice and peel, mace, nutmeg and white pepper. If for brown, bum a bit of sugar for colounng. ® It is better to have cockles enough than to add water- and they are cheap. ’

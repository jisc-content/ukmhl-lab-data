E05XSTIC COCHERY. 146 Han Pie, to eat cold. Season the hare after it is cut up; and bake it, with eggs and forcemeat, in a raised crust or dish. When it is to be served, cut off the lid, and cover it with jelly- gravy, as in page 121. A French Pie. Lay a puff-paste round on the ledge of the dish ; and put in either veal in slices, rabbits or chickens jointed; with forcemeat-balls, sweetbreads cut in pieces, arti- choke-bottoms, and a few truffles. Vegetable Pie. Scald and blanch some broad beans; cut young carrots, turnips, artichoke-bottoms, mushrooms, peas, onions, lettuce, parsley, celery, or any of them you have; make the whole into a nice stew, with some good veal- gravy. Bake a crust over a dish, with a little lining round the edge, and a cup turned up to keep it from sinking. When baked, open the lid, and pour in the stew. Parsley Pie. Lay a fowl, or a few bones of the scrag of veal, sea- soned, into a dish; scald a colander-full of picked pars- ley in milk; season it; and add it to the fowl or meat, with a tea-cupful of any sort of good broth, or weak gravy. When it is baked, pour into it a quarter of a pint of cream scalded, with the size of a walnut of butter, and a bit of flour. Shake it round, to mix with the gravy already in. Lettuces, white mustard leaves, or spinach, may be added to the parsley, and scalded before put in. Turnip Pie. Season mutton-chops with salt and pepper, reserving the ends of the neck-bones to lay over the turnips, which must be cut into small dice, and put on the steaks. Put two or three good spoonfuls of milk in. You may add sliced ouioni Cover with a crust.

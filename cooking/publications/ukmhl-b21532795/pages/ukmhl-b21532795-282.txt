Set tlie vliole over a slow fire, and stir it till it becomes as tliick as good melted butter, but it must not be boiled ; then pour it into a disk for eating cold. A Cream. Boil half a pint of cream, and half a pint of milk, vith two bay-leaves, a bit of lemon-pael, a few almonds beaten to paste, vith a drop of water, a little sugar, orange-flower-water, and a tea-spoonful of flour, hav- ing been rubbed down with a little cold milk, and mixed vith the above. When cold, put a little lemon- juice to the cream, and serve it in cups or lemonade- glasses. A n excellent Cream. Whip up thi’ee quarters of a pint of very rich cream to a strong froth, vith some finely-scraped lemon-peel, a squeeze of the juice, half a glass of sweet vine, and sugar to make it pleasant, but not too sweet; hay it on a sieve or in a form, and next day put it on a dish, and ornament it vith very light puff-paste biscuits, made in shapes the length of a finger, and about two thick, over which sugar may be strewed, or a light glaze vith isinglass. Or you may use macaroons, to line the edges of the dish. Burnt Cream. Boil a pint of cream vith a stick of cinnamon, and some lemon-peel; take it off the fire, and pour it very slowly into the yolks of four eggs, stirring till half cold; sweeten, and take out the spice, &c.; pour it into the dish; when cold, strew white pounded sugar over, and brown it vith a salamander. Another way.—Make a rich custard without sugar, boiling lemon-peel in it. When cold, sift a good deal of sugar over the whole, and brown the top with a salar mauder.

6 DOMESTIC COOKERY. Eide of a dish to drain : and if wanted very nice, a sheet of cap paper must he put to receive the fish, which should look a beautiful colour, and all the cnimbs ap- pear distinct; the fish being free from all grease.

Garnish with a fringe of curled raw parsley, or pars- ley fried, which must be thus done: When washed and picked, throw it again into clean water: when the lard or dripping boils, throw the parsley into it immediately from the water, and instantly it will be green and crisp, and must be taken up with a slice ; this may be done after the fish is fried. If fish is to be broiled, it must be seasoned, floured, and put on a gridiron that is very clean ; which, when hot, should be rubbed with a bit of suet, to prevent the fish from sticking. It must be broiled on a very clear fire, that it may not taste smoky; and not too near, that it may not be scorched. 0 TURBOT. Â» 7b licep Turbot.

Serve it garnished with a complete fringe of curled parsley, lemon, and horse-radish. The sauce must be the finest lobster, and anchovy

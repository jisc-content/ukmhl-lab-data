SICK COOKERY. 301 .(4 «o/ier.—Boil two calves’ feet, two ounces of veal, and two of beef, tbe bottom of a penny-loaf, two or three blades of mace, half a nutmeg sliced, and a little salt, in three quarts of water, to three pints; strain, and take off the fat. Chkl-en Broth. Put the body and legs of tbe fowl that chicken-pana- da was made of, as \npage 303, after taking off the skin and rump, into the water it was boiled in, with one blade of mace, one slice of onion, and ten white pepper- corns. Simmer till the broth be of a pleasant flavour. If not water enough, add a little. Beat a quarter of an ounce of sweet almonds with a tea-spoonful of wa- ter, fine, boil it in the broth, strain, and when cold, re- move the fat. Eel Broth. Clean half a pound 6f small eels, and set them on with three pints of water, some parsley, one slice of onion, a few pepper-corns; let them simmer till the eels are bro- ken, and the broth good. Tbe above should make three half-pints of broth. Tench Broth. Make as eel broth above. They are both very nutri- tious, and light of digestion. Beef Tea. Cut a pound of fleshy beef in thin slices; simmer with a quart of water twenty minutes, after it has once boiled, and been skimmed. Season, if approved ; but it has generally only salt. Dr. Ratcliff's restorative Pork-jellg. Take a leg of well-fed pork, just as cut up, beat it, and break tbe bone. Set it over a gentle fire, with three gallons of water, and simmer to one. Let half an ounce of mace, and the same of nutmegs, stew in it. Strain through a tine sieve. When cold, take off the fat. Give

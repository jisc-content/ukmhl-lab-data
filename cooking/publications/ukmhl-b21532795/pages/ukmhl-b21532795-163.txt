POULTRY. 87 if i)roperly kept, and not over-roasted, the flavour is equal to teal. Serve with a good gravy. Plovers.—Choose those that feel hard at the vent, which shews they are fat. In other respects, choose them hy the same marks as other fowl. When stale, the feet are dry. They will keep sweet a long time. There are three sorts : the grey, green, and bastard plo- ver, or lapwing. Hare or rahbil.—If the claws are blunt and rugged, the cars dry and tough, and the haunch thick, it is old j but if the claws are smooth and sharp, the ears easily fear, and the cleft in the lip is not much spread, it is young. If fresh and newly killed, the body will be stiff, and in hare the flesh pale. But they keep a good while b}' proper care; and are best when rather beginning to turn, if the inside is preserved from being musty. To know a real leveret, you should look for a knob or small bone near the foot on its fore leg; if there is none it is a hare. Partridges.—They are in season in autumn. If young, the bill is of a dark colour, and the legs yellowish ; if fresh, the vent will be firm; but this part will look green- ish if stale. Pheasants.—The cock-bird is accounted best, except when the hen is with egg. If young, he has short blunt or round spurs; but if old, they are long and sharp. Directions for dressing Poultry and Game. All poultrj’ should be very carefully picked, every plug removed, and the hair nicely singed with white paper. The cook must he careful in drawing poultrj’ of all sorts, not to break the gall-bag, for no washing will take off the bitter where it has touched. In dressing wild fowl, be careful to keep a clear brisk fire. Let them be done of a fine yellow brown, but leave the gravy in : the fine flavour is lost if done too much.

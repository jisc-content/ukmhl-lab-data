The carving-knife for a ladv should be light, and of a mid- dling size and fine edge. Strength is less required than address in the manner of using it; and, to facilitate this, the cook shall give orders to the butcher to divide the joints of the bones of all carcasc-joints of mutton, lamb, and veal, (such as neck, breast, and loin :) which may then be easily cut into thin slices attached to the adjoining bones. If the whole of the meat be- longing to each bone should be too thick, a small slice may be taken oft'between every two bones. The more fleshy joints (as fillet of veal, leg or saddle of mut- ton, and beef,) are to be heljicd in thin slices, neatly cut and smooth, observing to let tlie knife pass down to the bone in tlie mutton and beef Joints. The dish should not be too far off the carver, as it gives an awkward appearance, and makes the task more difficult. .M- tention is to be paid to help every one to a part of such arti- cles as are considered the best. In heliiing fish, take care not to break the flakes, which in cod and very fresh salmon are large, and contribute much to tlie beauty of its appearance. A fish knife, not being siiarp, divides it bc-st on this account. Help a part of the roe, mill, or liver, to each person. The heads of carp, pans of those of cod and salmon, sounds of cod and fins of turbot, are likewise esteemed niceties, and are to be attended to accordingly. In cutting up any wild-fowl, duck, goose, or turkey, for a large party, if you cut the slices down from pinion to pinion, without making wings, there will be more prime pieces. A Cod’s Head.—Fish in general requires very little carving, ihe fleshy parts being those principally esteemed. A cod's heail and shouldors, when in season, and properly boiled, is a very genteel and handsome dish. When cut, it should be done with a fish-trowel, and the parts about the back-bone on the shoul- ders are the most firm and the best. Take off a piece quitt down to the bone, iu the direction of a, b, c, d, putting in the spoon at a, c, and with each slice of fish give a piece of th< sound, which lies underneath the back-bone and lines it, tht nieal of which Is thin, and a little darker-coloured than tin

192 DOMESTIC COOKERY. with salt, hut not too much of this. Lay over them a plate, or cover of wood, that will go into the keg, and put a heavy stone on it. A pickle will rise from the beans and salt. If they are too salt, the soaking and boiling \vill not be sufficient to make them pleasant to the taste. When they are to be eaten, cut, soak, and boil them as if fresh. Carrots, Parsnips, and Deet-roots, should be kept in layers of dry sand for winter-use; and neither they nor potatoes should be cleared from the earth. Potatoes should be carefully kept from frost. Store-onions keep best hung up in a dry cold room. Parsley should be cut close to the stalks; and dried in a warm room, or on tins in a very cool oven; i1 preserves its flavour and colour, and is very useful in winter. Artichoke-bottoms, slowly dried, should be kept in paper bags; and TruJJies, Morels, Lemon-peel, &c. in a dry place, ticketed. Small close Cabloujes, laid on a stone floor before thd frost sets in, will blanch and be very fine, after many weeks keeping. PICKLES. Rules to be observed with Pickles. Keep them closely covered ; and have a wooden spoon, with holes, tied to each jar; all metal being im- proper. They should be well kept from the air; the large jars be seldom opened; and small ones, for the dif- ferent pickles in use, should be kept for common supply, into which what is not eaten may be returned, and the top closely covered. Acids dissolve the lead that is in the tinning of sauce- pans. When necessary to boil vinegar, do it in a stone jar, on the hot hearth. Pickles should never be put into glazed jars, as salt and vinegar penetrate the glaze, which is poisonous.

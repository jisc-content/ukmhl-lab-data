DOMESTIC COOKERY. 304 An egg divided, and the yolk and white beaten sepa- • rately, then mixed with a glass of wine, will afford twoj very wholesome draughts, and prove lighter than when) taken together. Eggs very little boiled, or poached, taken in small. quantify, convey much nourishment; the yolk only,, when dressed, should he eaten by invalids. A great Restorative. Bake two calves’ feet in two pints of water, and the i same quantity of new milk, in a jar close covered, three > hours and a half. WHien cold remove the fat. Give a large tea-cupful the last and first thing. What- • ever flavour is approved, give it by baking in it lemon-- peel, cinnamon, or mace. Add sugar after. Another.—Simmer six sheep’s trotters, two blades of ( mace, a little cinnamon, lemon-peel, a few hartshorn i shavings, and a little isinglass, in two quarts of water to » one ; when cold, take off the fat, and give near half a i pint twice a day, warming with it a little new milk. Another.—Boil one ounce of isinglass-shavings, forty ' Jamaica peppers, and a bit of brown crust of bread, in i a quart of water to a pint, and strain it. This makes a pleasant jelly to keep in the house ; of 1 which a large spoonful may be taken in wine and water, milk, tea, soup, or any way. Another, a most pleasant Draught.—Boil a quarter of an ounce of isinglass-shavings with a pint of new milk, to half; add a bit of sugar, and, for change, a bitter almond. Give this at bed-time, not too warm. Dutch flummery, blamange, and jellies, as directed in pages 202, 204, and 213, or less rich according to judgment. Caudle. Make a fine smooth gruel of half-grits; strain it when boiled well, stir it at times till cold. When to be used.

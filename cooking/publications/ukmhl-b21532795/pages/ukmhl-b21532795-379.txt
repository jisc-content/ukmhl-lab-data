SICK COOKERY. 303 jelly; of which give, dissolved in wine, milk, or broth, in change with other nourishment. Panada, made in five minutes. Set a little water on the fire with a glass of white •wine, some sugar, and a scrape of nutmeg and lemon- peel ; meanwhile grate some crumbs of bread. The moment the mixture boils up, keeping it still on the fire, put the crumbs in, and let it boil as fast as it can. When of a proper thickness just to drink, take it off. AnoOier.—Make as above, but instead of a glass of wine, put in a tea-spoonful of rum, and a bit of butter; sugar as above. This is a most pleasant mess. Another.—Put to the water a bit of lemon-peel, mix tlie crumbs in, and when nearly boiled enough, put some lemon or orange-syrup. Observe to boil all the ingredients; for if any be added after, the panada will break, and not jelly. Chicken Panada. Boil it till about three parts ready, in a quart of wa- ter, take off the skin, cut the white meat off when cold, and put into a marble mortar: pound it to a paste with a little of the water it was boiled in, season with a little salt, a grate of nutmeg, and the least bit of lemon-peel. Boil gently for a few minutes to the consistency you like ; it should be such as you can drink, though tole- rably thick. This conveys great nourishment in small compass. Sifypels, when the Stomach will not receive meat. On an extreme hot plate put two or three sippets of bread, and pour over them some gravy from beef, mut- ton, or veal, if there is no butter in the dish. Sprinkle a little salt over. Eggs. An egg broken into a cup of tea, or beaten and mixed with a basin of milk, makes a breakfast more support- ing than tea solely.

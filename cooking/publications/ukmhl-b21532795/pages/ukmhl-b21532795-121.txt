BEEP. 45 the tongue should be laid in salt for a day and a nieht before pickled. To pickle Tongues for hoUing. Cutoff the root, but leave a little of the kernel and fat. Sprinkle some salt, and let it drain from the slime till ne.xt day: then for each tongue mix a large spoonful of common salt, the same of coarse sugar, and about half as much of saltpetre; rub it well in, and do so every day. In a week add another heaped spoonful of salt. If rubbed every day, a ton^e will be ready in a fort- night; but if only turned in the pickle daily, it will keep four or five weeks without being too salt. When you dry tongues, write the date on a parch- ment, and tie it on. Smoke them, or dry them plain, if you like best. * When it is to be dressetl, boil it till extremely tender; allow five hours; and if done sooner, it is easily kept hot. The longer kept after drying, the higher it will be: if liard, it may require soaking three or four hours. Another way.—Clean as above : for two tongues allow an ounce of saltpetre, and an ounce of°sal- prunella; rub them well. In two days, after well rubbing, cover them with common salt, turn them every day for three weeks, then dry them, and rub over them bran, and smoke them. In ten days they will be fit to eat. Keep in a cool dry place. To steio Tongue. S.alt a tongue witli saltpetre and common salt for a veek, turning it every day. Boil it tender enough to peel: when done, stew it in a moderately strong gravy; season with soy, mushroom-ketchup, Cayenne, pounded cloves, and salt if necessary. Serve with truffles, morels, and mushrooms. In both this receipt and the next, the roots must ho taken off tongues before salting, but some fat left.

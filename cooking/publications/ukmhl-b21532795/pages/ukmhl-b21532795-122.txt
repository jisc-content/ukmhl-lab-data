DOMESTIC COOKEUT. 46 A n excellent way of doing Tongues to cat cold. Season with common salt and saltpetre, brown sugar, a little bay-salt, pepper, cloves, mace, and allspice, in fine powder, for a fortnight; then take away the pickle, put the tongue into a small pan, and lay some butter on it; cover it with brown crust, and bake slowly till so tender that a straw would go through it. The thin part of tongues, when bung up to dry, grates like bung beef, and also makes a fine addition to the flavour of omlets. Beef-heart. Wash it carefully; stuff as bare; and serve with rich gravy, and currant-jelly sauce. Hash with the same, and port wine. Stewed Ox-elieek, plain. Soak and cleanse a fine cheek the day before it is to be eaten; put it into a stew-pot that will cover close, with three quarts of water; simmer it after it has first boiled up and been well skimmed. In two hours put plenty of carrots, leeks, two or three turnips, a bunch of sweet herbs, some whole pepper, and four ounces of alb spice. Skim it often; when the meat is tender, take it out; let the soup get cold, take off the cake of fat, and serve the soup separate or with the meat. It should be of a fine brown : which may be done by burnt sugar; or by frying some onions quite brown with flour, and simmering them with it. This last way im- jiroves the llavour of all soups and gravies of the brown kind. If vegetables are not approved in the soup, they may be taken out, and a small roll be toasted, or bread fried and added. Celery is a great addition, and should al- ways be served. Where it is not to be got, the seed of it gives quite as good a flavour, boiled-iu, and strained oftâ€™.

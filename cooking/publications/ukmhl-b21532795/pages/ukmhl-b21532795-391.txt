315 COOKERY FOR THE POOR. If in the villages about London, abounding with opulent families, the quantity of ten gallons were made in ten gentlemenâ€™s houses, there would be a hundred gallons of wholesome agreeable food given weekly for the supply of forty poor families, at the rate of two gallons and a half each. What a relief to the labouring husband, instead of bread and cheeee, to have a warm comfortable meal! To the sick, aged, and infant branches, how important an advantage! nor less to the industrious mother, whose forbearance from the necessary quantity of food, that others may have a larger share, frequently reduces that strength upon which the welfare of her family essentially depends. It very rarely happens that servants object to second- ing the kindness of their superiors to the poor; but should the cook in any family think the adoption of this plan too troublesome, a gratuity at the end of the winter might repay her, if the love of her fellow-creatures failed of doing it a hundred fold. Did she readily enter into it, she would never wash away, as useless, the peas or grits of which soup or gruel had been made; broken po- tatoes, the green heads of celery, the necks and feet of fowls, and particularly the shanks of mutton, and va- rious other articles which in preparing dinner for the family are thrown aside. Fish affords great nourishment, and that not by the part eaten only, but the bones, heads, and fins, which contain an isinglass. When the fish is served, let the cook put by some of the water, and stew in it the above'* as likewise add the gravy that is in the dish, until she obtain all the goodness. If to be eaten by itself, when it miikes a delightful broth, she should add a very small bit of onion, some pepper, and a little rice-flour rubbed down smooth with it.

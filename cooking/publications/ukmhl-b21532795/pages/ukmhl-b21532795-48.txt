XXXVi OBSERVATIONS FOR THE of information, to enable a lady to do the honours of her table, but makes a considerable difference in the consumption of a family: and though in large parlies she is so much assisted as to render this knowledge apparently of less consequence, yet she must at times feel the deficiency; and should not fail to acquaint herself with an attainment, the advantage of which is evident every day. Indeed, as fashions are so fleeting, it is more than probable, that before the end of this century, peat attention to guests may be again the mode, at it was in the commencement of the last. Some people haggle meat so much, as not to be able to help half a dozen persons decently from a large tongue, or a sirloin of beef; and the dish goes away with the apiieiiance of having been gnawed by dogs. If the daughters of the family were to take the head of the table, under the direction of their mother, they would fulfil its duties with grace, in the same easy manner as an early practice in other domestic affairs gradually fits them for their own future houses. Habit alone can make good carvers; but someiirincipal directions are here- after given, with a reference to the annexed plates. The mistress of a family should always remember that the welfare and good management of the house depend on the eye of the superior; and, consequently, that nothing is too trifling for her notice, whereby waste may be avoided; and this atten- tion is of more importance now that the price of every necei- sarv of life is increased to an enormous depree.

Ate. A minute account of the annual income, and the times of I'.-'.vment, should betaken in writing; likewise an estimate of llie sup|)osed amount of each article of expence; and those who are early accustomed to calculations on domestic articles will acquire so accurate a knowledge of what their estatilish- ment requires, as will give them the happy medium between prodigality and parsimony, without acquiring the character ot meanness. Perhaps few branches of female education are so useful as great readiness at figures. Accounts should be regularly kept, and not the smallest article omitted to be entered ; and if b.i- l.'.ni ed every week and month, &c. the income and out-goings will be ascertained with facility, and their proportions to each other be duly observed. Some people fix on stated sums to be appropriated to each different article, and keep the monev in separate purses; as house, clothes, pocket, etlucation of chil- dren , &c. Whichever way accounts be entered, a certain mode should be adopted, and strictly adhered to. Many women are unforttinately ignorant of the state of their husbandâ€™s income. a'lii others are only made acouainted with it when somesuecii-

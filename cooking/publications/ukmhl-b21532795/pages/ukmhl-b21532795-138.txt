6-2 DOMESTIC COOKERY. Porkers are not so old as hogs ; their flesh is M-hiter and less rich, but it is not so tender. It is divided into four quarters. The fore-quarter has the spring or fore-leg, the fore-loin or neck, the spare-rib and gris- kin. The hind has the leg and the loin. The feet of pork make various good dishes, and should be cut off before the legs are cured. Observe the same of the ears. The bacon-hog is sometimes scalded to take off the hair, and sometimes singed. The porker is always scalded. To roast a Leg of Pork. Choose a small leg of fine young pork ; cut a slit in the knuckle with a sharp knife ; and fill the space with sage and onion chopped, and a little pepper and salt. When half-done, score the skin in slices, but don’t cut deeper than the outer rind. Apple-sauce and potatoes should be served to eat with it. To boil a Jjig of Pork. Salt it eight or ten days: when it is to be dressed, weigh it; let it lie half an hour in cold water to make it white; allow a quarter of an hour for every pound, and half an hour over, from the time it boils up ; skim it as soon as it boils, and frequently after. Allow water enough. Save some of it to make peas-soup. Some broil it in a very nice cloth, floured; which gives a very delicate look. It should be small and of a fine grain. Serve peas-pudding and turnips with it. Loin and Keck of Pork. Ro.ast them. Cut the skin of the loin across, at dis- tances of half an inch, with a sharp pen-knife. Shoulders and Breasts of Pork. I’ut them into pickle, or salt the shoulder as a leg: when very nice, they may be roasted.

DOMESTIC COOKERY. 330 Fine carpets should be gently done with a hair hand- brush, such as for cloths, on the knees. To clean Carpets. Take up the carpet, let it be well beaten, then laid down, and brushed on both sides with a hand-brush ; turn it the right side upwards, and scour it with ox-gall, and soap and water, very clean, and dry it with linen cloths. Then lay it on grass, or hang it up to dry. To frive to Boards a heaviiful appearance. After washing them very nicely clean with soda and warm water, and a brush, wash them with a very large sponge and clean water. Both times observe to leave no spot untouched; and clean straight up and down, not crossing from board to board: then dry with clean cloths, rubbing hard up and do^vn in the same way. The floors should not be often wetted, but very tho- roughly when done ; and once a week dry-rubbed with hot sand, and a heavy brush, the right way of the boards. The sides of stairs or passages on which are carpets, or floor-cloth, should be washed with sponge instead of linen or flannel, and the edges will not he soiled. Dif- ferent sponges should he kept for the two above uses ; and those and the brushes should be well washed when done with, and kept in dry places. To extract Oil from Boards or Stone. Make a strong lye of pearl-ashes and soft water; and add as much unslacked lime as it will take up ; stir it together, and then let it settle a few minutes; bottle it, and stop close ; liave ready some water to lower it as \ised, and scour the part with it. If the liquor should lie long on the boards, it will draw out the colour ot them; therefore do it with care and expedition. To clean stone Stairs and Halls. Boil a pound of pipe-makerâ€™s clay with a quart of wa- ter, a quart of small beer, and put in a bit of stone-blue.

BEEF. 33 !t close covered, and as close as you can, for three or four hours. When quite tender, take off the tape, set the meat on a dish, and strain the gravy over it. Serve with currant-jelly sauce. This is the best way to dress this joint, unless it is very fat, and then it should he roasted. Tlie bone should be stewed with it. Breast of Venison. Do it as the shoulder, or make it into a small pasty. Hashed Venison Should be warmed with its own gravy, or some without seasoning, as before; and only wanned through, not boiled. If there is no fpt left, cut some slices of mut- ton fat, set it on the fire with a little port wine and sugar, simmer till dry; then put to the hash, and it will eat as well as the fat of the venison. For Venison Pasty, look under the head Pastry ; as likewise an excellent imitation. BEEP. To keep Beef. Tlie butcher should take out the kernels in the neck- pieces where the shoulder-clod is taken off, two from each round of beef; one in the middle, which is called the popeâ€™s eye ; the other from the flap: there is also one in the thick flank, in the middle of the fat. If these are not taken out, especially in the summer, salt will be of no use for keeping the meat sweet. There is another kernel between the rump and the edgebone. As the butchers seldom attend to this matter, the cook should take out the keniels; and then rub the salt well into such beef as is for boiling, and slightly sprin- kle that which is for roasting. The flesh of cattle that are killed when not perfectly cleared of food, soon spoils. They should fast twenty- four hours in winter, and double that time in summer, before being killed. 7

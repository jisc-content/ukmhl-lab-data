SAVOURY PIES. J4.I; a fowl; and either tongue, small birds, or forcemeat, in the middle. Giblet Pie. After very nicely cleaning goose or duck giblets, stew them with a small quantity of water, onion, black pep- per, and a bunch of sweet herbs, till nearly done. Let them grow cold; and if not enough to fill the dish, lay a beef, veal, or two or three mutton steaks, at bottom. Put the liquor of the stew to bake with the above; and when the pie is baked, pour into it a large tea-cupful of cream. ^ Sliced potatoes added to it, eat extremely well. Pigeon Pie. Pub the pigeons with pepper and salt, inside and out- in the latter put a bit of butter, and, if approved, some parsley chopped with the livers, and a little of the same seasoning. Lay a beef-steak at the bottom of tbe dish, and the birds on it; between every two, a hard egg! Put a cup of water in the dish; and if you have any ham in the house, lay a bit on each pigeon': it is a great im- provement to the flavour. Observe, when ham is cut for gravy or pies, to take the under part rather than the prime. Season the gizzards, and two joints of the wings, aim put them in the centre of the pie; and over them, in a hole made in the crust, three feet nicely cleaned, to shew what pie it is. Partridge Pie in a disk. Pick and singe four partridges; cut off the legs at the knee; season with pepper, salt, chopped parsley, thyme, and mushrooms. L.ay a veal-steak, and a slice of ham! at the bottom of the dish; put the partridge in, and half a pint of good broth. Pat puff paste on the ledge of the dish, and cover with the same; brush it over with egg and bake an hour. * 14

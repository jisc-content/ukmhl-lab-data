[CHAP. XXII. MODERN COOKERY. 510 pale vinegar, and throw in the berries as they become fit, from day to day. They are used instead of capers for sauce, and by some persons are preferred to them. When purchased for pickling, put them at once into a jar, and cover them well with the vinegar. TO PICKLE BARBERRIES AND SIBERIAN CRABS. When wanted for garnishing only, take the fruit before it is very ripe, cut half the length of their stalks from the crabs, and free the barberries from the leaves, and from any discoloured berries that may be amongst them. Put them into stone jars, and cover them well with brine, which has been boiled and left to become perfectly cold. Look at them occasionally during the winter, and should any scum or mould have gathered on the sur- face, clear it well off, drain the brine closely from the fruit, and fill the jars with some that is freshly made. Six ounces of salt, and a morsel of alum half the size of a bean to the quart of water should be boiled together for ten minutes and well skimmed, both for the first brine, and for any that may be re- quired afterwards. To pickle these fruits in vinegar, add the alum to a sufficient quantity to cover them, and boil it with a few white pepper- corns, which must be strained out before it is poured into the jars; it must be quite cold when added to the barberries or crabs. These last should not be ripe when they are used, or they will burst in the pickle; they should have attained their growth and full colour, but be still hard. TO PICKLE RED CABBAGE. Strip off the outer leaves, wipe, and slice a fine sound cab- bage or two extremely thin, sprinkle plenty of salt over them, and let them drain in a sieve, or on a strainer for twelve hours or more; shake or press the moisture from them; put them into clean stone jars, and cover them well with vinegar, in which an ounce of black pepper to the quart has been boiled. Some per- sons merely cover the vegetable with strong, unboiled vinegar.

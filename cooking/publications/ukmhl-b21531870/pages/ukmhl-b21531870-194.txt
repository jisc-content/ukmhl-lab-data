MODERN COOKERY. [CHAP. YII. 158 merits of the two modes of dressing meat and fish, a trial should he given to the steaming, on a small scale, before any great expenses are incurred for it, which may he done easily with a common saucepan or boiler, fitted like the one shown above, with a simple tin steamer. Servants not accustomed to the use of these, should be warned against boiling in the vessel itself any thing of coarse or strong flavour, when the article steamed is of a delicate nature. The vapour from soup containing onions, for example, would have a very bad effect on a sweet pudding especially, and on many other dishes. Care and dis- cretion, therefore, must be exercised on this point.

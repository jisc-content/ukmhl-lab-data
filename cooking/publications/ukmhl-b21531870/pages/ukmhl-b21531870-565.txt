CHAP. XXIII.] CAKES. 527 Flour, 1 lb.; butter, 6 ozs.; sugar, f lb.; cinnamon, 1 dessertspoonful (more or less, to the taste) ; eggs, 3 to 4. Qbsâ€” Lemon cakes can be made by this receipt by substitut- ing for the cinnamon the rasped or grated rinds of two lemons, and the strained juice of one, when its acidity is not objected to. More butter, and more or less of sugar, can be used at will, both, for these and for the cinnamon cakes. QUEEN CAKES. To make these, proceed exactly as for Sutherland puddings (see Chapter XVII.), but allow ten eggs for the pound of sugar, butter, and flour, and when these are all well mixed, throw in half a teaspoonful of mace, and a pound of clean dry currants.

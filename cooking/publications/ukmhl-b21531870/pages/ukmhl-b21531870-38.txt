[[chap. I. 2 MODERN COOKERY. induced to tolerate the reality; and we would therefore most strongly urge all* employed in the culinary department of a household, who may be anxious lor their own success in life, or solicitous to obtain the respectand approbation of their employers, to strive to the utmost against any tendency to slovenliness of which they may be conscious, or which may be pointed out to them by others. A TEW DIRECTIONS TO THE COOK. In whatever vessel soup is boiled, see that it be perfectly clean, and let the inside of the cover and the rim be equally so. Wash the meat, and prepare the vegetables with great nicety before they are laid into it; and be careful to keep it always closely shut when it is on the lire. Never, on any account, set the soup by in it, but strain it off at once into a clean pan, and fill the stock-pot immediately with water : pur- sue the same plan with all stewpans and saucepans directly they are emptied. Skim the soup thoroughly when it first begins to boil, or it can never afterwards be rendered clear; throw in some salt, which will assist to bring the scum to the surface, and when it has all been taken off, add the herbs and vegetables ; for if not long stewed in the soup, their flavour will prevail too strongly. Bemember, that the trimmings, and especially the bones of fresh meat, the necks of poultry, the liquor in which a joint has been boiled, and the shank-bones of mutton, are all excel- lent additions to the stock-pot, and should be carefully reserved for it. * An active, cleanly, and attentive kitchen-maid will generally become an admirable cook.

528 MODERN COOKERY. [[CHAP. XXIII. whisked eggs; add some grated nutmeg, or fresh lemon-rind, and eight ounces of currants, cleaned and dried; heat the whole well and lightly together, then strew in a very small teaspoon- ful of good carbonate of soda in the finest powder, and again, heat the cake well and lightly for three or four minutes; put it into a buttered mould, and bake it from an hour to an hour and a quarter; or divide it in two, when three quarters of an hour will be sufficient for each part. Flour, 1 lb.; butter, \ lb.; sugar, f lb.; boiling milk, full i pint; eggs, 3 ; currants, \ lb.; good carbonate of soda, 1 very small teaspoonful : 1 to If hour. Or: divided in two, \ to f hour. Obs.â€”This, if carefully made, resembles a pound cake, but is much less expensive, and far more wholesome, while it has the advantage of being very expeditiously prepared.

Let it again rise for an hour, then beat it up lightly with a wooden spoon, put it into a buttered pan, and bake it in a brisk oven for nearly or quite an hour. An additional ounce of butter will improve it. Flour, If lb.; yeast, If tablespoonful: 1 hour, or more. Eggs, 3 ; milk, less than | pint; sugar, 6 ozs.; currants, 6 ozs.; lemon- grate, nutmeg, or candied orange-rind, at pleasure: 1 hour. Baked nearly or quite an hour; brisk oven. COCOA-NUT BISCUIT.

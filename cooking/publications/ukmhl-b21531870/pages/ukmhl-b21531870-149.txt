(A very fine sauce for cold meat, poultry, fish, or salad.) Put into a large basin the yolks only of two fine and very fresh eggs, carefully freed from the germs, with a little salt and cayenne; stir these well together, then add about a teaspoonful of the purest salad oil, and work the mixture round with a wooden spoon until it appears like cream.

It is sometimes coloured green with the juice of parsley, and other herbs. A spoonful or two of cold bechamel, or of good white sauce, is always an improvement to it. KEMOUI/ADE. This differs little from an ordinary salad dressing. Pound very smoothly indeed the yolks of two or three hard- boiled eggs with a teaspoonful of mustard, half as much salt, and some ea- i

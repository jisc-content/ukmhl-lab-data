Square foolscap 8vo. with Portrait, 7s. ornamental boards ; or 14s. bound in morocco (old style) by Hayday. “ A very acceptable volume, which, from its external and internal merits, deserves to lie on every library table. Its literature is of no common kind. Both the axioms and the biography of their celebrated author recommend the book, independently of its curious form. And let ns note, en passant that the casket is adapted, with rare skill and taste, to the. ^olden rules it encloses. It is in the old-fashioned style, wooden boards, neatly and an- tiquely ornamented, a portrait of the Albert-Dnrer kind, black-letter running titles, the pages squared in rule lines, with marginal indexes, quaint initial letters, evidently copied from some contemporary Italian book, and, in short, all the fanciful accompaniments which make its like the author the better for his resuscitation, as it were, in the literary garb of his epoch."—Literary Gazette.

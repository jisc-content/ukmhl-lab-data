Take six boned and well-washed anchovies, pound them together with the yolks of hard-boiled eggs, about a quarter of a pound of butter, and a tiny dust of Nepaul pepper, and a little cochineal colouring. Pound these into a smooth paste, rub through wire sieve, and then arrange them on to some little round fried croutons, and sprinkle a little chopped parsley over. Croutes of Haddock. Take a Finnon haddock about a pound in weight, free it from skin and bones, and put it into a stewpan with two ounces of butter, four table- spoonfuls of milk, a well-beaten yolk of egg, a little pepper, and a teaspoonful of lemon-juice. Whisk these ingredients quickly over the fire for five minutes, by which time the fish will be smooth. Pile this on some small rounds of hot buttered toast. Sprinkle the tops lightly with finely minced parsley and coralline pepper, and serve.

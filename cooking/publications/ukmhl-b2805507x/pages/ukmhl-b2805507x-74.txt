TEMPTING DISHES. 62 rice cook gently till all the stock is soaked up. Season with a little pepper and salt, and serve with grated cheese. Sardine Sandwich Remove the skin and bones from six sardines ; mash them, add a teaspoonful of made mustard, one of lemon-juice, one of Worcestershire sauce ; pound, and add gradually one tablespoonful of olive oil; when smooth spread thinly on small crisp water biscuits ; dust thickly with the yolks of hard-boiled eggs mashed fine; serve with water- cress or lettuce. Savoury Custard. Beat up two eggs, and stir into them a teacup- ful of cold beef-tea or some bovril ; add a little salt and pepper ; pour into a small buttered basin ; cover with a buttered paper and place in a sauce- pan of boiling water, which should come rather more than half-way up, and steam gently for half an hour. Savoury Croutons. Cut some slices of stale bread into fancy shapes—rounds, diamonds, heart-shapes, trefoils, etc.—and soak these thoroughly in milk; then sprinkle them on both sides with a mixture of minced onion, herb powder, pepper, salt and chopped parsley; press this well into the croutons, and fry them in boiling fat; drain carefully ; pile up high on a hot napkin, garnish with fried parsley, and serve hot. The croutons may be soaked in white stock instead of milk.

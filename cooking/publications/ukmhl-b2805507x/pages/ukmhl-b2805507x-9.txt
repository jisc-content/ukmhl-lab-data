PREFACE. THIS little work is not intended as a cookery book in the usual acceptance of the word ; it is merely what the title indicates, viz. a few tempting and in- expensive recipes within the scope of everybodyâ€™s cookery, and which I have been induced to collect from many requests to do so.

A few persons have remarked that in my a la mode series of Cookery Books (which the public have kindly made so popular) many of the recipes are too extravagant for short purses, but I may mention that in those little volumes there are recipes of all kinds to suit all incomes. A recipe is often pronounced extravagant if the cook sees cream in it; but any cook who knows some- thing of the culinary art would understand that a tablespoonful of cream goes a long way in entrees

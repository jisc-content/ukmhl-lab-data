The time for simmering should be from ten to twelve minutes for every pound of meat. Hints to Cooks. Salted and dried meats should be slowly boiled, and liquid must not be allowed to cool in pewter vessels. Rapid boiling hardens meat. Fat for frying must be perfectly fresh. Fresh trimmings of meat should be used in the stock pot. Avoid skewers in meat as much as possible. Always blow off the dust before removing the lid of a saucepan. Never leave anything in the pot after it has boiled. Never throw animal or vegetable substances into the dust-bin, they should be burnt on the kitchen fire. Have a time and place for everything. Cold meat is best if not cut when warm. Fresh vegetables will snap crisply. Stale ones will bend instead of break. Meat can be preserved in summer by covering it with bran.

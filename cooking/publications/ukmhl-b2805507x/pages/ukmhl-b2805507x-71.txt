TEMPTING DISHES. 59 Potatoes and Bacon. Cut thin rashers of bacon, fry them, and when cooked throw into the fat in the saucepan some roughly chopped potatoes ; pile them on a hot dish, brown in front of the fire, and serve with the rashers on the top. Season the potatoes well with pepper and salt. Baked Potatoes with Cheese. Scour the potatoes and bake them till done; cut their tops nearly off and scoop out the insides ; mix with them a little grated cheese, an egg, a little butter or milk, salt and pepper; fill the skins with this mixture, replace the tops, and bake them again till hot. Potato and Cheese Patties. Mash three or four potatoes, mix them with a little butter, milk, grated cheese, salt and pepper; put a little of the mixture in each patty-pan and bake for a few minutes. Paper Ramekin cases can be filled with them, instead of using patty- pans. Potato and Ham Sandwiches. V Stir two eggs into a quart of well-seasoned mashed potatoes without beating ; on two table- spoonfuls of this potato lay a slice of cold ham neatly trimmed ; cover with the same amount of potato, press firmly together round the edges, dredge with flour on both sides ; have some boiling fat ready on the stove, and fry these a delicate brown.

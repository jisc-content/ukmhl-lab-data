TEMPTING DISHES. 27 on a skewer (three or four on each skewer) and cook them in one ounce of butter in a fryingpan. Rumpsteak la Bonne-Bouche. Rub a thick steak with salt, pepper and mustard, flour. Put some butter into a fryingpan, and when it is boiling put the steak in and cook with a few sticks of celery cut small and about eight mushrooms; a good thick slice of onion and one little tiny piece of garlic should be put into the pan merely to lend its flavour. Fry all very quickly ; after taking it up remove the grease and add one tablcspoonful of well-smoothed flour, two of Harvey sauce, one teaspoonful of bovril melted in a teacupful of boiling water ; stir well the whole time and let it have a good boil up; serve the same separately. Make a suet crust and line a greased pudding- basin with it and fill the basin with sausages and a very little water, put on the cover, press the sides close, wet and flour the pudding-cloth and cover the pudding, &c., and boil one hour and a half. Mince half a pound of underdone beef or mutton as finely as possible and put it into a basin with half its weight in bread-crumbs, one ounce of butter broken into small pieces, a tablespoonful of finely minced onion, a teaspoonful of mixed powdered herbs and a good seasoning of salt and pepper. Mix these ingredients thoroughly, moisten with Sausag'e Pudding. Savoury Moulds.

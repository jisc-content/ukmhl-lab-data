TEMPTING DISHES. 54 Curried Eggs on Toast. Cut some round pieces of fried bread, curry some onions, and put a good layer of them on the fried rounds of bread. Keep very hot while the required number of eggs is being poached, and lay a poached egg on each round of curry toast, and serve quickly. Devilled Biscuits. Take some water biscuits, steep them in milk for ten minutes, take them out, dust them with cayenne, salt and black pepper, and bake them in a slow oven for twenty minutes. Devilled Lobster. Take the meat from a lobster and put on a little Nepaul pepper, chop it very finely, then add a dessertspoonful of chutney, a little oiled butter and a tomato cut up small. These must be stewed over the fire, stirring till they boil; add a little mixed mustard (French also if available). Have ready some little squares of fried bread, and put some of the devilled lobster on each, and sprinkle a little finely chopped parsley over. Devilled Sardines. Take six sardines and spread over them on both sides some made mustard and a dash of cayenne, grill them and serve on hot buttered toast; garnish with slices of lemon.

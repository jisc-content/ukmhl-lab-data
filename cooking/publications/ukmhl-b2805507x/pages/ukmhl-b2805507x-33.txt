Dish them in a circle with a few peas in the centre and white mushroom sauce round. Mutton Collops. Chop some parsley and one shalot, and get small thin slices, about two inches square, from the chump end of a loin of mutton. Fry the collops alone, till brown on both sides, in a stew- pan with one ounce of dissolved butter. The fire should be brisk, and the collops turned up and down in the butter. When done take them out, put in the parsley and shalot, add a little more butter, and stew for five minutes. Then add a tablespoonful of flour, a tablespoonful of catsup, a little stock, and the juice of half a lemon.

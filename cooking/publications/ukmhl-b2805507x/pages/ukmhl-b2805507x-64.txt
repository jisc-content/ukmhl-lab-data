The paste may be cut into finger- strips and the mixture spread on half of them, placing the others sandwich fashion over them. Colcannon. Boil some potatoes and any kind of greens, separately. Mash the former, and chop the latter very finely, and mix the two together with a little butter, pepper, salt, and a very tiny piece of chopped onion.

PREFACE. vii they can never be relined, and arc therefore unwhole- some. Upon all matters of cookery I shall be very pleased to give advice, and to explain any of the recipes in any of my books which may present difficulties to the cook, on receipt of a stamped directed envelope; and if I can help the fine art of cookery, which cookery has become, by so doing I shall indeed have achieved a success. HARRIET A. DE SALTS. IlAMrTON Lea, Sutton, July 1890.

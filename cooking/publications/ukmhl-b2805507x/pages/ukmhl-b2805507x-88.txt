Keep the fire up so that the oven is kept hot all the time. Meat baked requires ten minutes for every pound to cook it; if there be much fat, it will take a little longer. Do not bake meat and pastry at the same time, as the steam renders the crust heavy. Boiling. The water must be violently boiling and the meat suddenly put into it, and the boiling must not be stopped by the insertion of the meat, but must continue incessantly for from ten to fifteen minutes, after which it should be reduced to a simmer till done. The scum rising to the top must be skimmed off from time to time ; a little salt should be put into the water when about half-done. This rule for boiling meat does not apply to fish, as nearly all kinds, especially turbot and cod, must be put into cold water and brought to a boil gradually. Salmon and trout are best put into boiling water, and soles and all small fish into ivarm water only. Broiling.

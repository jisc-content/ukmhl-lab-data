*8 TEMPTING DISHES. Mushrooms au Gratin. Scoop out the inside of some nice round cup mushrooms after peeling them ; cut off the stalks, peel them and chop them up with a small bit of onion, a teaspoonful of chopped parsley, a pinch of thyme and a piece of thin lemon-peel, the size of sixpence; fry these in bacon fat, flavour with pepper and salt, and add sufficient quantity cf bread-crumbs to fill the hollowed-out mushrooms. Fill the hollows with this mixture and cover with a few bread-crumbs, and cook very slowly in good fat in a stewpan, keeping them well covered to keep in the flavour. Serve with a little gravy poured round. Mushrooms with Toast. Rub the tops of the mushrooms with a piece of flannel dipped in salt. Heat some butter in a sauce- pan, into which put the mushrooms with a little salt and Nepaul pepper; let them stew gently till the butter has almost disappeared, when add cream - and the grated rind of a lemon. Let them simmer now only till done. Serve the mushrooms on cut rounds of fried bread, and squeeze some lemon- juice over them. 4- Pailles de Parmesan.

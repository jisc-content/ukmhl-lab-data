*7 Of Roaftlng* T■) roafi Ruffs and Rees. Thefe birds are found in Lincolnlhire and the Ifle of Ely; the food proper for them is new milk boiled, and put over white bread, with a little fine fugar, and be careful to keep them in fe- parate cages. They feed very fad, and will die of their fat if not killed in time. Trufs them as you do a woodcock, but draw them, and cover them with vine leaves. Glaffe, ioo. For fauce—good gravy thickened with butter, and a toad un- der them. Mafon, 285. Another way. When you kill them, flip the fkin off the head and neck with . the feathers on, then pluck and draw them. When you road them, put them a good diftance from the fire ; if the fire be good, they will take about twelve minutes. When they are roafted, flip the fkin on again with the feathers on ; fend them up with gravy under them, made the fame as for a pheafant, and bread-fauce in a boat, with crifp crumbs of bread round the edge of the difh. Raff aid, 66. Farley, 41. To roafi Pheafants or Partridges. Pheafants and partridges may be treated in the fame manner. Dull them with flour, and bafte them often with frefh butter, keeping them at a good diftance from the fire. A good fire will roaft them in half an hour. Make your gravy of a fcrag of mutton, a tea-fpoonful of lemon pickle, a large fpoonful of catchup, and the fame of browning. Strain it, and put a little ot it into the difh ; ferve them up with bread-fauce in a bafon, and fix one of the principal feathers of the pheafant in the tail. Parley, 39. Another way• Let them be nicely roafted, but not too much; bafte them gently with a little butter, and dredge them with flour; fprinkle a little fait on, and froth them nicely up : have good gravy in the ^ jr ^rea^“^auce in a boat, made thus:—take about a handful or two of crumbs of bread, put in a pint of milk or more, G a fmall

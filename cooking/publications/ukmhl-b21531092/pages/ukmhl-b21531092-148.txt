Cut your collops the fame way as the white ones, but brown your butter before you lay in your collops, fry them over a quick fire, fhake and turn them, and keep them on a fine froth ; when they are a light brown, put them into a pot, and fry them as the white ones ; when you have fried them all brown, pour all the gravy from them into a clean tofiing- pan, with half a pint of gravy made of the bones and bits you cut the collops off, two tea-fpoonfuls of lemon-pickle, a large one of catchup, the fame of browning, half an ounce of morels, half a lemon, a little anchovy, chyan, and fait to your tafle; thicken it with flour and butter, let it boil five or fix minutes, then put in your collops, and fhake them over the fire ; if they boil, it will make them hard. When they have fimmered a little, take them out with an egg fpoon, and lay tht-m on your difh, ftrain your giavy, and pour it hot on them ; lay over them force-meat balls, and little flices of ba- con curled round a fkewer and boiled; throw a few mufh- rooms over, Garnifh with lemon and barberries, and ferve th£m up.

Have ready a good ragoo made thus :—take a little butter in your flew-pan, and melt it, then add a large fpoonful of flour, flir it about till it is fmooth, then put in a pint of good brown gravy \ feafon it with pepper and fait, pour in a fmall rlafs of white wine, fome veal fweetbreads, fotce*meat balls, ^ r truffles 1

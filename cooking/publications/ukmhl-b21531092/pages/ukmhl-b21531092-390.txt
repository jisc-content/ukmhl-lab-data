You may take fmall cucumbers and large ones that will cut into cpiarters, (let them be as green and as free from feed as you can get them) put them into a ftrong fait and water, in a nar- 1 row-mouthed jar, with a cabbage-leaf to keep them down ; tie a paper over them, fet them in a warm place till they are yellow, walh them out, and fet them over the fire in frerh water, with a little fait in, and a frefii cabbage-leaf over them ; cover the pan very clofe, but take care they do not boil ; if they are not of a fine green, change your water, which will help them ; then make them hot, and cover them as before.

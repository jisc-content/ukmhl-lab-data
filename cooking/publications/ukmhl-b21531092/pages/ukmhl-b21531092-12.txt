( VIII ) Solely vegetable, eafily prepared, and attended with little or no expence :—many refpeCtable perfons, from principles of duty and humanity, ftep forward in recommending it. I have added a Marketing Table, another for buy- ing and felling, and a Specimen of a Houfe-keeping Book, all of which will, I flatter myfeif, be found ex- tremely ufeful. The fpecimen of a houfe-keeping book is intended for thofe who do not chufe to be at the expence of eighteen pence annually; for that fum, they may be furnifhed with books upon the fame plan, at any of the bookfellers or ftationers. I cannot conclude without requefling a candid ex- amination of my performance, when i hope its utility will be universally acknowledged. My belt thanks are due to thofe friends who have, fince I began this work, furnifhed me with feveral original receipts, which are ineftimable in their kind, and will greatly enhance the value of this volume. To the laft, or Second Edition, I made confider- able improvements, by adding Bills of Fare, an exten- flve lift of things in feafon, and an elegant collection of light diflies for Supper. I am now able to give fubftantial proof of the fu- perior utility of this Collection, viz. two large im- preffions have been lold in a much fhorver lpace of time than can be inftanced even of one edition in any other book of cookery in the Englifli language! This third Edition is much improved by conliderable additions, particularly in the Family Fhyfician, This part now concludes with the Humane Society s di- rections for the recovery of perfons fuppofed to be PROWNED or SUFFOCATED. 17 . * • * MARY COLE. \ THE I

Rajfald, 30, Another way, The properefl time for boiling herrings, is when they come before and at the beginning of the mackrel feafon ; they are by many people reckoned better than when full of roe: the flefh is much poorer than at this feafon, when their breeding time is over, and they have had time to feed and recover their flefh. Clean half a dozen herrings, and throw them into a pan of cold water. Air them about, and change the water once; fet on a Aew-pan, with water enough to cover them, fome fait, and a little vinegar. When the water boils, put iq the herrings ; when they are enough, lay them on a fifh-plate, in a warm difh. Sauceâ€”fennel boiled and chopped fmall, with melted butter. To boil Eels.

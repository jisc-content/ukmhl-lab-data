For example:—to the receipt for making partridge foup, I have referred to Mrs. Glare’s Art of Cookery, page 133 ; Mrs. Mafon’s Ladies AJfiJlant, page 198; Mrs. Raff aid's Experienced Englifh Houfe keeper, page 14; and Mr. Farley's London Art of Cookery, page 155. I have only fometimes quoted fo many authori- ties—a frequent repetition would add to the bulk, but not the utility of the work. The bell of my judgment has been exercifed in fe- leCting whatever is valuable from the works of others, which, after proving their excellence, I regularly en- tered in my common-place book. The following pages are enriched with every article that merits pre- servation in the productions of Clermont, Glajfe, Mafon, Dalrymple, Dupont, Commo, Defang, Verno, cIroas, De- latour, Valois, Verral, Raff aid, Farley, he. but all ex- travagant, and almoft impracticable receipts, I have purpofely rejected.

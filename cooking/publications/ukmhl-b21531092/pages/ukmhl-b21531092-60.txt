This volume contains a pleasing sele&ion from the works of that elegant writer; among which are, The story of Le Fevre and Uncle Toby, Maria, Shandy’s Bed of Justice, Yorick’s Horse, Corporal Trim’s Brother, the Dwarf, the Pulse, the Pye Man, the Sword, the Supper, the Starling, the Ass, Dr. Slop and Obadiah, Dr. Slop and Susan, &c. &c. Also several of his most celebrated sermons, elegant sentiments, and familiar letters to his friends.

The essence of the im- mortal Sterne may be said to be comprised in this volume. Vide the Review for March. TIIE

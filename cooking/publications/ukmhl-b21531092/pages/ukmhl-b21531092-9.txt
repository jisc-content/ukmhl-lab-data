( V ) PREFACE To the Firfi Edition, with a few Lines relative to the Third. HAT there have been many publications on the \ fubjedt of Cookery, I am willing to admit; but, however extraordinary it may appear, the number of treatifes on that ufeful art, have rendered another ab- folutely neceflary. It is neither my wifh, nor my intention, to depre- ciate the productions of others; I mean only to apo- logize for introducing a new work, on a fubjedt appa- rently fo much exhaufted; and I hope I fhall not be accufed of vanity when I declare, that I think THE LADY’s COMPLETE GUIDE will anfwer the pur- pofe of all the books which have hitherto appeared on this interefting bufinefs. It is indeed a library of cookery ; and contains the eflence of all the eftablifhed modern authors, befides a great number of Original Receipts. I flatter myfelf that I fhall be thought entitled to the approbation of my readers, for my careful felec- tion of thofe articled'••which I have gathered ' from others. I have endeavoured to be more fyftematic than my predeceflors in this walk, and consequently lefs confufed; and, like the fagds of the law, I have quoted my author, where the receipt is not original; fo that the cook, like the barrifter, may know upon what authority he adts; and he will fometimes find the names of three or four celebrated cooks to eftablifh a Angle receipt. _ When I have found the fame receipt in three or four different publications, I have fometimes quoted all their [^3] . names.

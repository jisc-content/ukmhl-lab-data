Cover them clofe, and flew them till they are tender. Take them and the onion out, and thicken the gravy with a littl butter rolled in flour, a fpoonful of browning, and the juice of half a lemon. Boil it up till it is fmooth, but not too thick. Then put in your rumps, give them a top or two, and difh them up hot. Garnifh with horfe-radifh and beet- root. For variety, you may leave the rumps whole, and lard fix kidnies on one fide, and do them the lame as the rumps, only not boil them, and put the rumps in the middle ot the difh, and kidnies round them, with the fauce over all. The kidnies make a pretty fide dilh of themfelves. Far- ley, 109. To hajh Mutton.

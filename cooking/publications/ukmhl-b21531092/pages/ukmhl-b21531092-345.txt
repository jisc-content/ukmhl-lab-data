THE knowledge of pickling is very efTential in a family, but it is to be lamented, that the health of individuals is often endangered, merely to gratify the age. Things known to be pernicious, are frequently made ufe of, in order to procure a brighter colour to the article meant to be pickled. It is indeed a common pradtice to make ufe of brafs utenfils, that the ver- digrife extradled from it may give an additional tint to all pickles intended to be green ; not confidering that they are communi- cating an abfolute poifon to that which they are preparing for their food. Such inconfiderate proceedings, it is hoped, will hereafter be avoided, efpecially as there is no necellity for having recourfe to fuch pernicious means, when thefe articles will be- come equally green, by keeping them of a proper heat upon the hearth, without the help of brafs or verdigrife of any kind. It is therefore highly proper to be very particular in keeping the pickles from fuch things, and to follow ftridlly the diredlions of your receipts, given with refpedl to all kinds of pickles, â€¢ which are greened only by pouring your vinegar hot upon them, and it will keep them a long time. Stone jars are the mod: proper for a]l forts of pickles, for though they are expenfive in the hrlt purchafe, yet they will, in the end, be found much cheaper than earthen vefiels, through which, it has been found by expei* rience, fait and vinegar will penetrate, efpecially when put in hot. Be careful never to put your fingers in to take the pickles * OUt,

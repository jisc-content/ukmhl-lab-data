( I3° ) CHAP. VIII. MADE DISHES OF POULTRY, &c. Goofe d-la-mode. PICK a large fine goofe clean, fkin and bone it nicely, and take off the fat. Then take a dried tongue, and boil and peel it. Take a fowl and treat it in the fame manner as the goofe; feafon it with pepper, fait, and beaten mace, and roll it round the tongue. Seafon the goofe in the fame manner, and put both tongue and fowl into the goofe. Put it into a little pot that will juft hold it, with two quarts of beef gravy, a bundle of fweet herbs, and an onion. Put fome flices of ham, or good bacon, between the fowl and goofe ; then cover it clofe, and let it ftew over the fire for an hour very flowly. Then take up your- goofe, and fidm off all the fat; ftrain it, and put in a glafs of red wine, two fpoonfuls of catchup, a veal fweetbread cut fmall, fome truffles, mufhrooms, and morels, a piece of butter rolled in flour, and, if wanted, fome pepper and fait. Put the’goofe in again, cover it clofe, and let it ftew half an hour longer. Then take it up, pour the ragoo over it, and garnifh with lemon. You muft remember to lave the bones of the goofe and fowl, and put them into the gravy when it is firft fet on. It will be an improvement if you will roll fome beef-marrow between the tongue and the fowl, and between the fowl and goofe, as it will make them mellow and eat the finer. Before we conclude this article, it may not be amifs to obferve, that the beft method to bone a goofe or fowl of any fort is to begin at the bread, and take out all the bones without cutting the back ; for when it is fewed up, and you come to ftew it, it generally burfts in the back, whereby the fhape of it is fpoiled.

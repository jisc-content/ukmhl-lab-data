12 Of Roajling. Another way to roajl a Turkey. Hen turkeys are modly preferable to cocks, for whitencfs and tendernefs,; the fmall flefhy ones are the molt cdeemed, and they ought to be kept as long as the weather will admit. Make a forced-meat with the liver chopped, parfley, (hallots, fcraped lard, yolks of eggs, pepper, and fait. When properly trulled, give the turkey a few turns over the fire in a large (lew-pan with butter ; (luff the force-meat under the bread where the craw was taken out, and road it, with lemon dices upon the bread to keep if white; dices of lard, and double paper. Serve with what ragoo you think proper, as muihrooms, morels, fmall onions, or large Spanidi ones, girkins, fmall melons, cucumbers, truffles, green peas, fmall garden beans, endive, cardoons, roots of any fort, celery, craw-fi(h, or any thing according to the feafon.

This fauce is good either with boiled or roafled turkies, or fowls ; but you may leave the gravy out, adding as much butter as will do for fauce, and garnilhing with lemon. To roajl Fowls.

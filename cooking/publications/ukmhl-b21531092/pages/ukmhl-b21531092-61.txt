THE lady's complete guide: =- CHAP. I. OF ROASTING. / General Injlruftions for RoaJUng. WHEN you roaft any kind of meat, it is a very good way to put a little fait and water in your dripping- pan ; bade your meat a little with it; let it dry, then dull it well with flour; bafte it with frefh butter, it will make your meat a better colour. Obferve always to have a brilk, clear fire; it will prevent your meat from dazing, and the froth from falling \ keep it a good diftance from the fire ; if the meat is fcorched, the outfide is hard, and prevents the heat from pe- netrating into the meat, and will appear enough before it be lit- tle more than half done. Time, diftance, bailing often, and a clear fire, is the beft method I can prefcribe for roafting meat to perfe&ion ; when the fleam draws near the fire, it is a fign of its being enough ; but you will be the beft judge of that from the time you put it down. Be careful, when you roaft any kind of wild-fowl, to keep a clear brilk fire \ roaft them a light brown, but not too much. It is a great fault to roaft them till the gravy runs out of them, it takes off the fine flavour. Tame fowls re- quire more roafting \ they are a long time before they are hot B through.

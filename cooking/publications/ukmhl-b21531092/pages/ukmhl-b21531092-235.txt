When your liquor is reduced to one quart, put in a pint of red wine, a fpoon- ful of lemon-pickle, and one of catchup, the fame of browning, and flew it till it is reduced to a pint; thicken it with butter rolled in flour, lay round your hare a few morels, and four dices of force-meat, boiled in a caul of a leg of veal. When you didt it up, draw the jaw-bones, and dick them in the eyes for horns ; let the ears lie back on the roll, and dick a fprig of myrtle in the mouth ; drain over your fauce, and ferve it up.

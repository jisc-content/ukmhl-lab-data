*7^ Made Dijhes of Hares, Rabbits, &c. To jug a Hare. Cut your hare into little pieces, and lard them here and there with little (lips of bacon. Seafon them with a little pepper and fait, and pour them into an earthen jug with a blade or two of mace, an onion ftuck with cloves, and a bundle of fweet herbs. Cover the jug clofe, that nothing may get in; fet it in a pot of boiling water, and three hours will do it. Then turn it out into the difh, take out the onion and fweet herbs, and fend it hot to table. As to the larding, you may omit it if you pleafe, Farley, 71, To hajh a Hare. Cut your hare into fmall pieces ; if any of the pudding is left, rub it fmall in fome gravy, to which put a glafs of red wine, a little pepper and fait, an onion, a flice of lemon ; tofs it up till hot through, take out the onion and lemon. Another way. Cut it in fmall pieces, and if you have any of the pudding left, rub it fmall, and put to it a gill of red wine, the fame quantity of water, half an anchovy chopped fine, an onion ftuck with four cloves, and a quarter of a pound of butter rolled in flour. Shake all thefe together over a flow fire till your hare is thorough- ly hot, for it is a bad cuftom to let any kind of halh boil longer, as it hardens the meat. Send your hare to table in a deep dilh, but before you fend it up, take out the onion, and lay fippets round the dilh. Farley, 70. To collar a Hare. Bone a hare, and lard it with thick pieces of bacon, feafoned with fpices and fait; put a good force-meat in it or not; roll it up very tight, and tie it well; braze it with llices of veal, half a pint of white wine, and a pint of broth ; cover it over with flices of bacon. You may alfo put fuch meat and other feafoning to make a jelly of the braze after, and ferve the hare cold with it, either whole or fliced. Dalrymfle, 241. Hare

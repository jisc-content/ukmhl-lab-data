i6 Of Rodfingi tabic. Obfervc nevfcr to take any thing out of a woodcock of fmpe. Another way. Ruck them, but do not draw them ; put them on a fmall fpit, dud, and bade them well with butter, toad; a few dices of a penny loaf, put them on a,clean plate, and fet it under the birds while they are rriaftirig. If the fire be good, they will take about ten minutes roading. When you draw them, lay them upon the toads on the difh ; pour melted butter round them, and ferve them up. Rajfald, 66. Twenty minutes will road; woodcocks and fifteen minutes fnipes. Majon, 274. â€¢ A woodcock will require twenty-five minutes. Glajfe, 6. A fnipe will require twenty minutes roading. Glajfe, 6. 'To roajl Larks. Put a fmall bird-fpit through them, and tie them on another; road them, and all the time they are roading, keep bading them very gently with butter, and fprinkle crumbs of bread on them till they are almod done; then let them brown before you take them up. The bed way of making crumbs of bread is to rub them through a fine cullender, and put in a little butter into a dew- pan; melt it, put in your crumbs of bread, and keep them dir- rirrg till they are of a light brown ; put them on a fieve to drain a few minutes ; lay your larks in a difh, and the crumbs all round, almod as high as the larks, with plain butter in a cup,, and fome gravy in another. Glajfc, 6. Another way to roajl Larks. Skewer a dozen of lark9, and tie both ends of the fltewer to the fpit. Dredge and bade them, and let them road ten mi- nutes. Break half a penny loaf into crumbs, and put them, with a piece of butter of the fize of a walnut, into a tofling- pan, and having fliaken them over a gentle fire till they are of a light brown, lay them between the birds, and pour a little melted butter over them. Farley, 40.

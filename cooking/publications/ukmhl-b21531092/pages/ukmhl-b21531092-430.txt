( 37° ) THE FAMILY PHYSICIAN; O R, The Country Lady s Benevolent Employment* Want of Appetite. IF want of appetite proceeds from errors in diet, or any other part of the patient’s regimen, it ought to be changed. If naufea and Teachings fliew that the ftomach is loaded with crudities, a vomit will be of fervice. After this, a gentle purge or two of rhubarb, or of any of the bitter purging falts, may be taken. The patient ought next to ufc fome of the ftomachic bitters in'fufed in wrine. Though gentle evacuations be necef- fary, yet ftrong purges and vomits are to be avoided, as they weaken the ftomach, and hurt digeftion. Elixir of vitriol is an excellent medicine in moft cafes of in- ftigeftion, weaknefs of the ftomach, or want of appetite. Twenty or thirty drops of it may be taken twice or. thrice a-day, in a glafs of wine or water. It may likevvife be mixed with the tin&ure of the bark ; one drachm of the former to an ounce of the latter, and two tea-fpoonfuls of it taken in wine or water, as above. s The chalybeate waters, if drank in moderation, are generally of confiderable fervice in this cafe. The fait water has likewile good effects ; but it muft not be ufed too freely. The waters of Harrowgate, Scarborough, Moffat, and moft other fpas in Britain, may be ufed with advantage. We would advile all who are afflidled with indigeftfon and want of appetite, to re- pair to thefe places of public rendezvous. The very change of air, and the cheerful company, will be of fervice; not to mention the exercife, diftipation, amufements, &c. Tijfot. Buchan. _ Thu

The Art of Brewing, 365 and give it to the hogs, or lade both the water and that into the math vat, where it is to remain till the (team is near fpent, and you can fee your face in it, which will be in about a quarter of an hour in cold weather; then let all but half a bulhel of malt run very leifurely into it, ftirring it all the while with an oar or paddle,"that it may not ball, and when the malt is nearly mixed with water, it is enough; which I am fenfible is different from the old way, and the general prefent praÂ£tice; but I lhall here clear that point. For, by not ftirring or mafhing the malt into a pudding confidence, or thin malh, the body of it lies in a more loofe condition, that will ealier and fooner admit of a quicker and more true paffage of the afterladings of the feveral bowls or jets of hot water, which muft run through it before the brewing is ended; by which free pereolation, the water has ready accefs to all the parts of the broken malt, fo that the, brewer is enabled to brew quicker or flower, and to make more ale or fmall beer. If more ale, then hot boiling water muft be laded over fo llow, that one boil muft run almoft off before another is put over, which will occafion the whole brewing to laft about fixteen hours, efpecially if the Oundle way is followed, of fpending it out of the tap as fmall as a draw, and as fine as facie, and then it will be quickly fo in the barrel. Or if lefs or weaker ale rs to be made, and good fmall beer, then the fecond copper of boil- ing water muft be put over expeditioully, and drawn out with a large and faft ftream. After the firft ftirring of the malt is done, then put over the referve of half a bufhel of frelh malt to the four bulhels and an half that are already in the tub, which muft be fpread all over it, and alfo cover the tubs with fome facks, or other cloths, to keep in the fteam or fpirit of the malt; then let it ftand for two or three hours, at the end of which, put over now and then a bowl of the boiling water in the copper, as is before diredled, and fo continue to do till as much is run off as will almoft fill the copper. Then, in a canvas, or other loofe woven cloth, put in half a pound of hops, and boil them half an hour, when they muft be taken out, and as many frelh ones put in their room as are judged proper, to boil half an hour more, if for ale. But if for keeping beer, half a pound of frelh ones ought to be put in every half hour, and boil an hour ami an half brilkly. Now, while the firft copper of wort is boiling, there fhould be fealding water leifurely put over, bowl by bowl, and run off, that the copper may be filled again immediately after the firft is out, and boiled an hour, with nearly the fame quan- tity of frelh hops, and in the fame manner as thofe in the firft copper

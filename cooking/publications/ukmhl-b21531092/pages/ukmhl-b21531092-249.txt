( i89 ) CHAP. XI. OF SOUPS. Ohfervations on Soups. REAT care is neceffary to be taken that the pots, or fauce- VJT pans, and covers, be very clean, and free from all greafe and fand, and that they are well tinned, for fear of giving the broth or foups any bralfy tafle, or of injuring the health of thofe who partake of the feveral difhes.

MARY COLE, Cook to the Right Hon. the Earl of Drogheda. LONDON: PRINTED FOR G. JCEARSLEY, NO. 46, FLEET-STREET,/ ostvEPtsm' UKMM L£fW yL xio( V ) PREFACE To the Firfi Edition, with a few Lines relative to the Third. HAT there have been many publications on the \ fubjedt of Cookery, I am willing to admit; but, however extraordinary it may appear, the number of treatifes on that ufeful art, have rendered another ab- folutely neceflary. It is neither my wifh, nor my intention, to depre- ciate the productions of others; I mean only to apo- logize for introducing a new work, on a fubjedt appa- rently fo much exhaufted; and I hope I fhall not be accufed of vanity when I declare, that I think THE LADY’s COMPLETE GUIDE will anfwer the pur- pofe of all the books which have hitherto appeared on this interefting bufinefs. It is indeed a library of cookery ; and contains the eflence of all the eftablifhed modern authors, befides a great number of Original Receipts. I flatter myfelf that I fhall be thought entitled to the approbation of my readers, for my careful felec- tion of thofe articled'••which I have gathered ' from others. I have endeavoured to be more fyftematic than my predeceflors in this walk, and consequently lefs confufed; and, like the fagds of the law, I have quoted my author, where the receipt is not original; fo that the cook, like the barrifter, may know upon what authority he adts; and he will fometimes find the names of three or four celebrated cooks to eftablifh a Angle receipt. _ When I have found the fame receipt in three or four different publications, I have fometimes quoted all their [^3] . names.( VI ) names, with references to the pages where it is to be found. For example:—to the receipt for making partridge foup, I have referred to Mrs. Glare’s Art of Cookery, page 133 ; Mrs. Mafon’s Ladies AJfiJlant, page 198; Mrs. Raff aid's Experienced Englifh Houfe keeper, page 14; and Mr. Farley's London Art of Cookery, page 155. I have only fometimes quoted fo many authori- ties—a frequent repetition would add to the bulk, but not the utility of the work. The bell of my judgment has been exercifed in fe- leCting whatever is valuable from the works of others, which, after proving their excellence, I regularly en- tered in my common-place book. The following pages are enriched with every article that merits pre- servation in the productions of Clermont, Glajfe, Mafon, Dalrymple, Dupont, Commo, Defang, Verno, cIroas, De- latour, Valois, Verral, Raff aid, Farley, he. but all ex- travagant, and almoft impracticable receipts, I have purpofely rejected. The molt frugal and lealt com- plicated dilhes, are generally the molt excellent; thofe have not efcaped my particular attention, as they are perfectly confident with my plan of tafte, united with ceconomy and fimplicity. I fhould before have obferved, that in reading the various books upon this fubjedt which have been printed, I foon perceived that every fubfequent waiter had borrowed very largely from thofe who had pre- ceded. Mrs. Glaffe's book contains the belt receipts which llie could difeover in the four elteemed works of this kind then extant. Mrs. Mafon, Mrs. Raffald, and Mr. Farley *, have purfued limilar lteps; but have not, like myfelf, candidly acknowledged their obli- gations. That nothing might be omitted to render this per- * If all the writers upon Cookery had acknowledged from whence they took their receipts, as I do, they would have acted with more candour by the public. Their vanity to pafs for Au- thors, inftead of Compilers, has not added to their reputation. formance\ C VII ) formance generally ufeful, I have added, by way of Supplement, Inftru&ions for Brewing in all its Branches. A&ing in the capacity of Houfe-keeper, as well as Cook, I have taken infinite pains to arrive at perfection in that department, and flatter myfelf that my inftrudtions will entitle me to the approbation of my reader. Medicine, and the application of it to the mod general complaints, have occupied a part of my lei- fure hours. The productions of Mead, Sydenham, ffjfot, Fothergil, Elliot, Buchan, and feveral others, have given me a tolerable idea of domeftie medicine, and enabled me fometimes to relieve thofe whofe cir- cumftances would not permit them to call in the aid of a phyfician. I have diftinguilhed this department of my work under the title of THE FAMILY PHYSICIAN. Thefe medical inftrudliGns are taken principally from Dr. Buchan’s Domeftie Medicine; or rather, to mention the fource from whence his book was prin- cipally derived, from Dr. Tifiot’s Avis au Peuple, fur la fante. I have read and compared them. This Doc- tor Buchan acknowledges with the liberality of a gen- tleman.—“ Tifl'ot,” fays he, te in his Avis au Peuple, t( comes the neareft to my views of any aijthor I “ have feen.” Docftor Buchan has alfo greatly en- riched his book with Ramazin, Lemery on Foods, and Dr. Arbuthnot’s works. Thefe auxiliaries, fupported by his own great medical abilities, haye produced that valuable performance, fo well known under the title of Domefic Medicine ; a treafure which no family fhould be without. Though this feledion deferves the higheft degree of credit, being the preferiptions of the moft eminent phyficians this country boafts, that for the cure of the Dropfy may be faid to ftand alone 1 its wonderful efficacy, in curing that alarming difeafe, may be fairly reported as reduced to a certainty ! it is * 4j folely( VIII ) Solely vegetable, eafily prepared, and attended with little or no expence :—many refpeCtable perfons, from principles of duty and humanity, ftep forward in recommending it. I have added a Marketing Table, another for buy- ing and felling, and a Specimen of a Houfe-keeping Book, all of which will, I flatter myfeif, be found ex- tremely ufeful. The fpecimen of a houfe-keeping book is intended for thofe who do not chufe to be at the expence of eighteen pence annually; for that fum, they may be furnifhed with books upon the fame plan, at any of the bookfellers or ftationers. I cannot conclude without requefling a candid ex- amination of my performance, when i hope its utility will be universally acknowledged. My belt thanks are due to thofe friends who have, fince I began this work, furnifhed me with feveral original receipts, which are ineftimable in their kind, and will greatly enhance the value of this volume. To the laft, or Second Edition, I made confider- able improvements, by adding Bills of Fare, an exten- flve lift of things in feafon, and an elegant collection of light diflies for Supper. I am now able to give fubftantial proof of the fu- perior utility of this Collection, viz. two large im- preffions have been lold in a much fhorver lpace of time than can be inftanced even of one edition in any other book of cookery in the Englifli language! This third Edition is much improved by conliderable additions, particularly in the Family Fhyfician, This part now concludes with the Humane Society s di- rections for the recovery of perfons fuppofed to be PROWNED or SUFFOCATED. 17 . * • * MARY COLE. \ THE ICOOK AND HOUSEWIFE’S CALENDAR % O R, I 9 MONTHLY LIST OF THINGS IN SEASON, FROM JANUARY TO DECEMBER.

WHEN you roaft any kind of meat, it is a very good way to put a little fait and water in your dripping- pan ; bade your meat a little with it; let it dry, then dull it well with flour; bafte it with frefh butter, it will make your meat a better colour. Obferve always to have a brilk, clear fire; it will prevent your meat from dazing, and the froth from falling \ keep it a good diftance from the fire ; if the meat is fcorched, the outfide is hard, and prevents the heat from pe- netrating into the meat, and will appear enough before it be lit- tle more than half done. Time, diftance, bailing often, and a clear fire, is the beft method I can prefcribe for roafting meat to perfe&ion ; when the fleam draws near the fire, it is a fign of its being enough ; but you will be the beft judge of that from the time you put it down. Be careful, when you roaft any kind of wild-fowl, to keep a clear brilk fire \ roaft them a light brown, but not too much. It is a great fault to roaft them till the gravy runs out of them, it takes off the fine flavour. Tame fowls re- quire more roafting \ they are a long time before they are hot B through.Of Roofing. 2 through, and muft be often balled to keep up a ftrong froth ; it makes them rife better, and a finer colour. Pigs, and geefe fhould be roafied before a good fire, and turned quick. Hares and rabbits require time and care, to fee the ends are roafied enough ; when they are half roafied, cut the neck-fkin, and let out the blood, or when they are cut up they often appear bloody at the neck. Rajfald, p. 53. Farley, 33. I raufi defire the cook to order her fire according to what {he is to drefs; if any thing very little or thin, then a pretty little brilk fire, that it may be done quick and nice ; if a very large joint, then be fure a good fire be laid to cake. Let it be clear at the bottom ; and when your meat is half done, move the drip- ping-pan and fpit a little from the fire, and ftir up a good brilk fire ; for, according to the goodnefs of your fire, your meat will be done fooner or later. Giaffc, 1. As foon as the meat is put to the fire, pour over it fome warm water, which throw away ; this is very necefiary to thofe who arc nice in the drefiing their meat, it being a good deal handled in the fpitting; fiiake fome flour over it, bafte it with butter, and do not put it too near the fire; this. With frequently bailing it, a brilk fire, and allowing time enough, are the only means of roafting in perfection ; when the fleam draws to the fire, the meat is done ; flour and bafte it juft before it is fent to the table, that it may have a nice froth ; always allow a longer time for the meat to roaft in frofty weather; take particular care to have the fpit clean, as nothing is more difagreeabl^ than a fpit-mark; and remember, when the meat is half done, to remove the drip- ping-pan and fpit a little from the fire, and ftir it; if it is a good fire before the meat is laid down, once ftirring it will in general roaft a joint of meat. Never fait the meat before it is put to the fire, it draws out the gravy too much; if it is to be kept fome time before it is drefled, as indeed mutton and beef are not good frefh killed, be fure to dry it well with a cloth, and hang it where it will have a thorough air ; look at it every day, and wipe off all the damp ; it will keep a long time. Some pepper it a little. Maforiy 120. GlaJJ'e, 2. To roajl Beef. Be fure to paper the top, and bafte it well all the time it is Toafting, and throw a handful of fait on it. When you lee the frnokeOf Roofing. 3 B 2 fmoke draw to the fire, it is near enough; then take off the pa- per, bade it well, and dredge it with a little flour to make a fine froth. Never fait your roaft meat before you lay it to the fire, for that draws out all the gravy. Take up your meat, and gar- nifh your difh with nothing but horfe-radifh. To roaft a piece of beef of about ten pounds, will take an hour and an half, at a good fire. Twenty pounds weight will take three hours, if it be a thick piece; but if it be a thin piece of twenty pounds weight, two hours and an half will do it; and fo on, according to the weight of your meat, more or lefs. Ob- ferve, in frofty weather your beef will take half an hour longer. Glajfe, 22, to roaft a Beef-‘tongue. Boil a tongue until it will peel, in broth or water, with fait and pepper, onions, carrots, parfnips, a nofegay*, two cloves of garlic, laurel, and thyme; then lard it as a fricandeaut, and finifli it in roafting; ferve under it a relifhing fauce, or plain. Dairy tuple, 53. Cold Roaft Beef family fafloion. Slice three or four onions, and fry them in butter ; when done, add a little broth, three fhallots chopped ; pepper and fait; then put flices of cold beef to it; boil for a moment; when ready, add a liafonj: made of three yolks of eggs and a little vinegar. Cold beef is alfo very good with cold fauce, made of chopped parfley, fhallots, vinegar, oil, muftard, minced anchovy, 5cc.

You fhould always obferve to ball'* your meat as Toon as you lay it down to roaft ; fprinkle fome lalt on, and, when near done, dredge it with a little flour to froth it up. Garnilh mutton with horfe-radifh ; lamb with creiles, or fmall falading. A leg of mutton of fix pounds will take an hour and a quar- ter; of twelve pounds, two hours; a fmall faddle, an hour and an half; a large one, near three hours. Paper a faddle. If gar- lic is not difliked, fhifF the knuckle part of the leg with two or three cloves of it ; a breaft will take half an hour at a brifk fire; a large neck, an hour ; a fmall one, a little more than half an hour ; a ihoulder near as much time as a leg. For fauce—pota- toes, pickles, falad, celery raw or Hewed, broccoli, French beans, cauliflower; or, to a Ihoulder of mutton, onion fauce. Majon, 161. To roaft a Haunch of Mutton, Venifon fafoion. .To drefs a haunch of mutton, venifon falhion, take a hind fat quarter of mutton, and cut the leg like a haunch. Lay it in a pan, with the back fide of it down, and pour a bottle of red wine over it, in which let it lay twenty-four hours. Spit it, and .roaft it at a good quick fire, and keep bailing it all the time with the famy liquor and butter. It will require an hour and an half roalling; and, \vhen it is done, fend it up with a little good gravy in one boat, and fweet fauce in another. A good fat tteck of mutton done in- this manner is elleemed delicate eating. Farley, 34. Another way. Cut a hind quarter of fat mutton like a haunch of venifon ; let it lleep in the Iheep’s blood for five or fix hours ; then let it hang, in cold dry weather, for three weeks, or as long as it will keep fweet; rub it well with a cloth, then rub it over with frelh butter ; drew fome fait over it, and a little flour ; butter a- Iheet of paper, and lay over it, and another over that, or fome pafte, and tie it round. If it is large, it will take two hours and an half roalling. Before it is taken up, take off the paper, or pafte, bade it well with butter, and flour it. Let the jack go round very quick, that it may have a good froth. Sauce—gravy and currant jelly. Majon, i6x.Of Roafling* S Another way. Get the larged and fatted leg of mutton you can, cut out like a haunch of venifon, as foon as it is killed, whild it is warm, it will eat the tendererer; take out the bloody vein, flick it in feveral places in the under fide with a lharp-pointed knife; pour over it a bottle of red wine; turn it in the wine four or five times a day for five days, then dry it exceeding well with a clean cloth; hang it up in the air, with the thick end uppermofl, for five days; dry it night and morning, to keep it from being damp or growing mu Ay. When you roaft it, cover it with pa- per, and pafle it as you do venifon; ferve it up with venifon iauce, It will take four hours roafling. Rajfald, 107. To roajl Veal. As to veal, you mull be careful to roaft it of a fine brown ; if a large joint, a very good fire ; if a fmall joint, a pretty little bride fire; if a fillet or loin, be fure to paper the fat, that you lofe as li'ttle of that as pofiible. Lay it fome diftance from the fire, till it is foaked ; then lay it near the fire. When you lay it down, bade it well with good butter; and when it is near enough, bade it again, and dredge it with a little dour. The bread you mud road with the caul on till it is enough ; and fltewer the fweet-bread on the back fide of the bread. W hen it is nigh enough, take off the caul, bade it, and dredge it with a little dour. Glujfe, 2. Veal takes much the fame time roading as pork \ but be fure to paper the fat of a loin or fillet, and bade your veal with good butter. Glaffe, 13. Veal will take a quarter of an hour to a pound in roading ; paper the fat of the loin and fillet; duff the fillet and fhoulder with the following ingredients-—a quarter of a pound of fuet c opped fine, parfley and fweet herbs chopped, grated bread and lemon peel; pepper, fait, nutmeg, and yolk of egg; butter may fupply the want of fuet; road the bread with the caul on, till it is almod enough, then take it off; dour it, and bade it. Veal requires to be more done than beef. For fauce—falad, pickles, potatoes, broccoli, cucumbers raw or dewed, French beans, peafe, cauliflower, celery raw or dewed, jifafotiy 137. B 3 ToOf Roofing. 6 To roof Pork. Pork mud be well done, or it is apt to furfeit. When you roaft a lo^n, take a fharp pen-knife, and cut the fkin acrofs, to make the crackling eat the better. The chine mult be cut, and fo mull all pork that has the rind on. Roaft a leg of pork thus: —-Take a knife, as above, and fcore it; ftuff the knuckle part with fage and onion, chopped fine, with pepper and fait; or cut a hole under the twift, and put the fage, &c. there, and fkewer it up with a fkewer. Roaft it crifp, becaufe moft people like the rind crifp, which they call crackling. Make fome good apple- fauce, and fend it up in a boat; then have a little drawn gravy to put in the difh. This they call a mock-goofe. The fpring, or hand of pork, if very young, roafted like a pig, eats very well; or take the fpring, and cut off the fliank or knuckle, and fprinkle fage and onion over it, and roll it round, and tie it with a firing, and roaft it two hours, otherwife it is better boiled. The fpare-rib fhould be bafted with a little bit of butter, a very little duft of flour, and fome fage fhred fmall; but we never make any fauce to it but apple-fauce. The bed way to drefs pork griflcins is to roaft them, bade them with a little butter and fage, and a little pepper and fait. Few eat any thing with thefe but muftard. GlaJJ’c, 3. Pork mull be well done. To every pound, allow a quarter of an hour. For example—a joint of twelve pounds weight, three hours; and fo on. If it be a thin piece of that weight, two hours will roaft it. GlaJJ'e, 22. Do not fcore pork, but rub it over with a feather and fome oil. Mafon, 175. To roof a Pig. Stick your pig juft above the breaft-bone, run your knife to the heart. When it is dead, put it in cold water for a few mi- nutes, then rub it over with a little rofin beat exceeding fine, or its own blood ; put your pig into a pail of Raiding water half a minute; take it out, lay it on a clean table, pull off the hair as ■cnick as poflible ; if it does not come clean off, put it in again. When you have got it all clean off, wafh it in warm water, then in two or throe cold waters, for fear the rofm Ihould taite. 1 akeOf Roajling. , 7 Another B 4 off the fore feet at the firft joint, make a flit down the belly, and take out all the entrails ; put the liver, heart, and lights, to the pettitoes, wafh it well out of cold water, dry it exceedingly well with a cloth, hang it up, and when you road it, put in a little Ihred fage, a tea-fpoonful of black pepper, two of fait, and a cruft of brown bread ; fpit your pig, and few it up ; lay it down to a brilk clear fire, with a pig-plate hung in the middle of the fire. When your pig is warm, put a lump of hotter in a cloth, and rub your pig often with it while it is roafting. A large one will take an hour and an half. When your pig is a fine brown, and the fteam draws near the fire, take a clean cloth, rub your pig quite diy, then rub it well with a little cold butter, it will help to crifp it; then take a (harp knife, cut off the head, and take off the collar; then take off the ears and jaw-bone, fplit the jaw in two. When you have cut the pig down the back, which muft be done before you draw the fpit out, then lay your pig back to back on your difh, and the jaw on each fide, the ears on each Ihoulder, and the collar at the fhoulder, and pour in your fauce, and ferve it up. Garnifh with a cruft of brown bread grated. Raffed cl, 55. Farley, 34. Another way to roafl a Pig. The pig being prepared, as above, fpit it, and lay it to the fire, which muft be a very good one at each end, or hang a flat iron in the middle of the grate. Before you lay it down to the fire, fhred a little fage very fmall, take a piece of butter as big as a walnut, and a little fait and pepper; put this into the pig, and few it up ftrongly ; then flour it all over, and continue to do fo till the eyes drop out, or the crackling will be hard. Take care to fave all the gravy that comes from it, and for this pur- pofe put a large bafon or pan in the dripping-pan, as foon as the gravy begins to run. Wnen the pig is enough, ftir up the fire brifkly, take a coarfe cloth, with about a quarter of a pound of butter in it, and mb the pig all over till the crackling is quite enfp, when it muft be taken up. Lay it in the difh, and cut oiT the head w’ith a fliarp knife; and, before you draw out the pit, cut the pig in two. Cut off the ears, and lay one at each cn , c wide the under jaw, and difpofeof them in the fame man- ner. rut the gravy you faved into fome melted butter, and boil them. 1 our it into the difh, with the brains bruifed fine, and ' Glaff^’ mixec* together, and ferve it up. Farley, 35.Of Roofing, Another way to roaf a Pig. Chop fome fage and onion very fine, a few crumbs of bread, a little butter, pepper, and fait, rolled up together; put it into the belly, and few it up before you lay down the pig; rub it all over with fweet oil. When it is done, take a dry cloth and wipe it; then take it into a dilh, cut it up, and fend it to table with the fame fauce as above. To roaf the hind quarter of a Pig, Lamb-fafhmu At the time of the year when houfe-lamb is very dear, take the hind quarter of a large roafting pig ; take off the fkin and roaft it, and it will eat like lamb, with mint fauce, or with a falad or Seville orange. Half an hour will roaft it. Glajfe, 4. Far- ley, 36. To make Sauce for a Pig. Chop the brains a little, then put in a tea-cup full of white gravy with the gravy that runs out of the pig, a little bit of an- chovy ; mix near half a pound of butter with as much flour as will thicken the gravy, a flice of lemon, a fpoonful of white wine, a little caper liquor and fait; fhake it over the fire, and pour it into your difh. Some like currants: boil a few, and lend them in a tea-faucer, with a glafs of currant jelly in the mid- dle of it. Rajfald, 5^. Different forts of Sauce for a Pig. Now you are to obferve there are feveral ways of making fauce for a pig. Some do not love any fage in the pig, only a cruft of bread ; but then you fhould have a little dried fage rubbed and mixed with the gravy and butter. Some love bread fauce in a bafon, made thus:—take a pint off water, putin a good piece of crumb of bread, a blade of mace, and a little whole pepper; boil ft for about five or fix minutes, and then pour the water off; take out the fpice, and beat up the bread with a good piece of butter, and a little milk or cream. Some love a few currants boiled in it, a glafs of wine, and a little fugar; but that you muft do juft as you like it. Others take half a pint of good beef gravy, and the gravy which comes out of the pig, with a. T ' piece9 Of Roofing. cicce of butter rolled in flour, two fpoonfuls of catchup, and boil them all together ; then take the brains of the pig and bruife them fine: put all thefe together, with the fage in the pig, and pour into your dilh. It is a very good fauce. When you have not crravy enough comes out ot your pig, with the butter, tor fauce, take about half a pint of veal gravy and add to it; or flew the pettitoes, and take as much of that liquor as will do lor fauce, mixed with the other.—N.

In order to roaft a haunch of venifon properly, as foonasyou have fpitted it, you muft lay over it a large theet of paper, and then a thin common pafte, with another paper over that. Tie it fart, in order to keep the pafte from dropping off ; and if the haunch be a large one, it will take four hours roafting. As foon as it is done enough, take off both paper and pafte, dredge it well with flour, and bade it with butter. As foon as it becomes pf a light brown, dilh it up with brown gravy or currant jelly fauce, and fend up fome in a boat, Raffald, 69. Farley, 34. Mafony 298. Another way to roof Venifon. Take a haunch of venifon and fpit it; rub fome butter all over your haunch ; take four Iheets of paper well buttered, put two on the haunch ; then make a pafte with fome flour, a little butter and water ; roll it out half as big as your haunch, and put it over the fat part; then put the other two Iheets of paper on, and tie them with the fame packthread ; lay it to a brilk fire, and bade it well all the time of roafting ; if a large haunch of twen- ty-four pounds, it will take three hours and an half, except it is a very large fire, then three hours will do it.

Another way to roaji a Goofe. It muft be feafoned with fage and onion, cut very fmall, and mixed with pepper and fait; an hour will roaft it. Boil the fage and onion in a little water before they are cut; it prevents their eating fo ftrong, and takes off the rawnefs.—For fauce, gravy and apple-fauce. AFafon, 268. When you roaft a goofe, turkey, or fowls of any fort, take care to Tinge them with a piece of white paper, and bafte them with a piece of butter; dredge them with a little flour, and fprinkle a little fait on ; and when the fmoke begins to draw to the fire, and they look plump, bafte them again, and dredge them with a little flour, and take them up. GlaJJe, 5. Sauce for a Goofe or Duck. As to geefe and ducks, you fhould have fage and onions Hired fine, with pepper and fait put into the belly.

A middling turkey will take an hour; a very large one, an hour and a quarter; a fmall one, three quarters of an hour. Your fire muft be very good. GlaJJe, 13.12 Of Roajling. Another way to roajl a Turkey. Hen turkeys are modly preferable to cocks, for whitencfs and tendernefs,; the fmall flefhy ones are the molt cdeemed, and they ought to be kept as long as the weather will admit. Make a forced-meat with the liver chopped, parfley, (hallots, fcraped lard, yolks of eggs, pepper, and fait. When properly trulled, give the turkey a few turns over the fire in a large (lew-pan with butter ; (luff the force-meat under the bread where the craw was taken out, and road it, with lemon dices upon the bread to keep if white; dices of lard, and double paper. Serve with what ragoo you think proper, as muihrooms, morels, fmall onions, or large Spanidi ones, girkins, fmall melons, cucumbers, truffles, green peas, fmall garden beans, endive, cardoons, roots of any fort, celery, craw-fi(h, or any thing according to the feafon. Clermont, 226. Sauce for a Turkey. Cut the cr'uds off a penny loaf, cut the red in thin dices, put it in cold water, with a few pepper corns, a little fait and onion; boil it till the bread is quite foft, then beat it well; put in a quarter of a pound of butter, two fpoonluls of thick cream, and put it into a bafon. Raffalcl, 63. 1 Another Sauce for a Turkey. Take half a pint of oyders, drain the liquor, and put the cyders with the liquor into a faucepan with a blade or two of mace; let them jud lump, then pour in a glafs of white wine; let it boil once, and thicken it with a piece of butter rolled in flour. Serve this up in a bafon by itfelf, with good gravy in the difli, for every body does not love oyder-fauce. If you chafe it in the difli, add half a pint of gravy to it, and boil it up toge- ther. This fauce is good either with boiled or roafled turkies, or fowls ; but you may leave the gravy out, adding as much butter as will do for fauce, and garnilhing with lemon. To roajl Fowls.

Another way to' roajl Fowls< Take your fowls when they are ready drefled, put them down to a good fire, finge, duff, and bafte them well with butter. A large fowl will be near an hour in roafting. Make a gravy of the necks and gizzards, (train it, put in a fpoonful of browning. When you difh them up, pour the gravy into the difh; ferve them up with egg-fauce in a boat. Raffald, 64. A large fowl will take three quarters of an hour roafting ; a middling one, half an hour; very fmall chickens, twenty mi- nutes. Your fire muft be very quick and clear when you lay them down. Glaffe, 14. Another way to roajl Fowls.

Raffald, 64. To roaji Ducks. Kill and draw your ducks; then dtred an onion and a few fage leaves; feafon thefe with fait and pepper, and put them into your ducks. Singe, dud, and bade them with butter, and a good fire will road them in twenty minutes; for the quicker they are done, the better they will be. Before you take them up, dud them with flour, and bade them with butter, to give them a good frothing and a pleafing brown. Your gravy mud be made of the gizzards and pinions, an onion, a tea-fpoonful of lemon- pickle, a few pepper corns, a large blade of mace, a fpoonful of catchup, and the fame of browning. Strain it, pour it into your dilh, and fend it up with onion fauce in a bafon. Farley, 40. Another way to roaji Ducks. Seafon them with fage and onion fhred, pepper, and fait; half an hour will road them—gravy-fauce, or onion-fauce. Always dew the fage and onion in a little water, as it prevents its eating drong, and takes off the rawnefs. Mafon, 273. A wild duck will take full twenty minutes. Mafon, 273. Raffald, 66.

Put a fmall bird-fpit through them, and tie them on another; road them, and all the time they are roading, keep bading them very gently with butter, and fprinkle crumbs of bread on them till they are almod done; then let them brown before you take them up. The bed way of making crumbs of bread is to rub them through a fine cullender, and put in a little butter into a dew- pan; melt it, put in your crumbs of bread, and keep them dir- rirrg till they are of a light brown ; put them on a fieve to drain a few minutes ; lay your larks in a difh, and the crumbs all round, almod as high as the larks, with plain butter in a cup,, and fome gravy in another.

For fauce—good gravy thickened with butter, and a toad un- der them. Mafon, 285. Another way. When you kill them, flip the fkin off the head and neck with . the feathers on, then pluck and draw them. When you road them, put them a good diftance from the fire ; if the fire be good, they will take about twelve minutes. When they are roafted, flip the fkin on again with the feathers on ; fend them up with gravy under them, made the fame as for a pheafant, and bread-fauce in a boat, with crifp crumbs of bread round the edge of the difh.

Preliminary Hints and Obfervations. NEATNESS being a mod material requifition in a kitchen, the cook fhould be particularly cautious to keep all the utenfils perfe&ly clean, and the pots and faucepans properly tin- ned. In boiling any kind of meat, but particularly veal, much care and nicety are required. Fifl your pot with a fufficient quantity of foft water, dud your veal well with fine flour, put it into your pot, and fet it over a large fire. It is the cuftom of fome people to put in milk to make it white ; but this is of no ufe, and perhaps better omitted ; for if you ufe hard water, it will curdle the milk, give to the veal a brownifh yellow cart, and will often hang in lumps about it. Oatmeal will do the fame thing; but by dulling your veal, and putting it into the water wrhen cold, it will prevent the foulnefs of the water from hang- ing upon it. Take the fcum off clearly as foon as it begins to rife, and cover up the pot clofely. Let the meat boil as flowly as poflible, but in plenty of water, which will make your veal rife and look plump. A cook cannot make a greater miffake than to let any fort of meat boil fall, fince it hardens the outfide before it is warm within, and contributes to difcolour it. Thus a leg of veal, of twelve pounds weight, will take three hours and an half boiling ; and the flower it boils, the whiter and plumper it will be. When mutton or beef is the objeft of your cookery, be careful to dredge them well with flour before you put them into the pot of cold water, and keep it covered ; but do not for- get to take off the fcum as often as it rifes. Mutton and beef do not require fo much boiling ; nor is it much minded if it be a little under the mark ; but lamb, pork, and veal, fhould be well boiled, as they will otherwife be unwholefome. A leg of pork will take an hour more boiling than a leg of veal of the fame weight; but, in general, when you boil beef or mutton, you may allow an hour for every four pounds weight. To put in the meat when t;he water is cold, is allowed to be the belt method, as it therebyOf Boiling, 23 -thereby gets warm to the heart before the outfide gets hard, i o boil a leg of lamb of four pounds weight, you muft allow an hour and an halt. Farley, 16, 17. Rajfald, 52> 53* As to all forts of boiled meats, allow a quarter of an hour to every pound. Be fure the pot is very clean, and Ikim it well, for every thing will have a fcum rife, and if that boils down, it makes the meat black. All forts of freth meat you are to put in when the water boils, but fait meat when the water is warm, GlaJJ'e, 8. eFo boil a Ham, Steep it all night in foft water; a large one fhould fimmer three hours, and boil gently two ; a fmall one fhould fimmer two hours, and boil about one and an half. Pull off the fkin, rub it over with yolk of egg, ftrew on bread crumbs, fet it before the |ire till of a nice light brown. Mafon, 177, Another way to boil a Ham, Put your ham into a copper of cold water, and when it boils, take care that it boils (lowly. A ham of twenty pounds will take four hours and an half boiling; and fo in proportion for one of a larger or fmaller fize. No foaking is required for a green ham; but an old and large ham will require fixteen hours foaking in a large tub of foft water. Obferve to keep the pot well Ikimmed while your ham is boiling. When you take it up, pull off the fkin, and rub it all over with an egg, flrew on crumbs of bread, bafte it with butter, and fet it to the fire till it is of a light brown. Farley, 17. When you hoil a ham, put it into your copper when the water is pretty warm, for the cold water draws the colour out; when it boils, be careful it boils very (lowly. GlaJJ'e, 8. Another way to boil a Ham. Steep your ham all night in water ; then boil it. If it be of a middle fize, it will take three hours boiling, and a fmall one two hours and an half. When you take it up, pull off the fkin, ?md rub it all over with an egg, ftrew on bread-crumbs, bafte it with butter, and fet it to the fire till it be a light brown. C 4 .

If your ham has been long kept, foak it fome time; if frefh, you need not; pare it round and underneath, taking care no rufty part is left; tie it up with packthread, put it in a brazing-pan much of its own bignefs, Vvith water, a faggot, a few cloves, thyme, and laurel leaves; boil on a flow fire about five hours, then add a glafs of brandy, and a pint of red wine ; finifh boil- ing in the fame manner. If to ferve hot, take up the fkin, and flrew it over with bread-crumbs, a little parfley finely chopped, and a few bits of butter ; give it colour in the oven, or with a falamander. If to keep cold, it will be better to leave the fkin on. Clermont, 169. To boil a Tongue* A tongue, if fait, foak it in foft water all night; boil it three hours ; if frefh out of the pickle, two hours and an half, and put it in when the water boils ; take it out and pull it; trim it; gar- nilh with greens and carrots. Glafj'e, 9. Mafon, 132. Another way to boil a Tongue. If your tongue be a dry one, fteep it in water all night; then boil it three hours. If you would have it eat hot, flick it with cloves, rub it over with the yolk of an egg, flrew over it bread- crumbs, bafle it with butter, fet it before the fire till it is a light brown. When you difh it up, pour a little brown gravy, or red- wine fauce, mixed the fame way as for venifon ; lay flices of cur- rant jelly round it.—N. B. If it be a pickled one, only wafh it out of water. Rajfald, 69. Farley, 18. Another way to boil a Tongue. Lard a tongue with pretty large pieces, and boil it in the broth pot, or in water, with a few onions and roots. When it is done, peel it, and ferve it with broth, fprinkling a little pepper and fait over it. It is alfo ufed without larding, and being boiled frefh in this manner.Of Boiling. 2$ 1 manner, is preferable to any thing elfe for mince-pie meat, Clermont, 50, To boil a Chicken. Put your chickens into fcalding water, and as foon as the feathers will flip off, take them out, otherwife they will make the flcin hard. After you have drawn them, lay them in flam- med milk for two hours, and then trufs them with their heads on their wings. When you have properly linged and dufted them with flour, cover them clofe in cold water, and fet them over a flow fire. Having taken off the fcum, and boiled them flowly for five or fix minutes, take them off the fire, and keep them clofe covered for half an hour in the water, which will flew them fufficiently, and make them plump and white. Before you difh them, fet them on the fire to heat; then drain them, and pour over them white fauce, made the fame way as for boiled fowls, Farley, 18. Mafon, 262.

Boil any bones or bits of veal, with a fmall bunch of fweet herbs, an onion, a (lice of lemon, a few white pepper corns, and a little celery ; drain it; there fhould be near half a pint • put to it fome good cream, with a little flour mixed fmooth in it, a good piece of butter, a little pounded mace, and fome fait; keep it ftirring ; add mufhrooms, or a little lemon juice. s . Mafon, 326. To boil a Turkey. Make a fluffing with grated bread, oyflers chopped, grated lemon peel, pepper, fait, nutmeg; about four ounces of butter, or fuet chopped, a little cream, yolks of eggs to make it a light fluffing ; fill the craw ; if any is left, make it into balls ; flour the turkey, put it into water while cold ; take off the feum as it rifes, and let it boil gently. A middling turkey will take about an hour. Boil the balls, lay them round it, with oyfter fauce in the difh, and in a boat. The fluffing may be made without oyflers, or it may be fluffed with forced-meat, or fau- fage meat, mixed with a few crumbs of bread and yolks of eggs, if oyflers are not to be had, white celery fauce is very good, or white fauce. Mafon, 257. A little turkey will be done in an hour; a large one in an hour and an half. Glajfe, 9. Another zvay to boil a Turkey. Let your turkey have no food the day before you kill it. When you are going to kill it, give it a fpoontul of allegar ; it will make it white, and eat tender. When you have killed it, hangOf Boiling* 37 hang it up by the legs for four or five days at lead ; when you have plucked it, draw it at the rump ; if you can take the breaft- bone out nicely, it will look much better. Cut off the legs, put the end of the. thighs into the body of the turkey, lkewer them down, and tie them with a firing; cut off the head and neck, then, grate a penny loaf, chop a fcore or more of oylters fine, flired a little lemon-peel, nutmeg, pepper, and fait to your palate. Mix it up into a light forced-meat, with a quarter of a pound of but- ter, a fpoonful or two of cream, and three eggs ; (tuff the craw with it, and make the reft into balls, and boil them. Sew up the turkey, dredge it well with flour, put it into a kettle of cold water, cover it, and fet it over the fire. When the fbum begins to rife, take it off, p1 on your cover, and let it boil very flowly for half an hour ; then take off your kettle, and keep it clofe covered. If it be of a middle fize, let it ftand half an hour in the hot water, the ftearn being kept in will flew it enough, make it rife, keep the {kin whole, tender, and very white. When you difh it up, pour over it a little of your oyfter-fauce, lay your balls round it, and ferve it up with the reft of your fauce in a boat. Garnifh with lemon and barberries.—N. B. Obferve to fet on your tur- key ;n time, that it may ftew as above : it is the beft way I ever found to boil one to perfection. When you are going to difh it up, fet it over the fire to make it quite hot. Rajfald, 60. Mr. Farley, in his London Art of Cookery, has the fame re- ceipt as the above, page 19, excepting a trifling alteration in the language. Sauce for a boiled Turkey. The beft fauce for a boiled turkey, is good ovfter and celery fauce. ( Make oyfter-fauce thus :—take a pint of oyfters, and fet them off; ftrain the liquor from them, and put them in cold water, and wafli and beard them ; put them into your liquor in a ftew-pan, with a blade of mace, and fom'e ,butter rolled in flour, and a quarter of a lemon ; boil them up, rhen put in half a pint of cream, and boil it all together gently ; take the lemon and mace out, fqueeze the juice of the lemon into the fauce, then m6 Vn y°Ur b?ats or bafons- Make celery-fauce thustake the white part of the celery, cut it about one inch long ; boil it in fome water till it is tender, then take half a pint of veal broth, a blade of mace, and thicken it with a little flour and butter : put in hall a pint of cream, boil them up gently together; put28 Of Bolling. y°ur ccIery and bo‘l it up, then pour it into your boats. Glajfey 9. To boll a Duck. As foon as you have fealded and drawn your ducks, let them remain for a few minutes in warm water. Then take them out, put them into an earthen pan, and pour a pint of boiling milk over them. Let them lie in it two or three hours, and when you take them out, dredge them well with flour; put them into a copper of cold water, and cover them up. Having boiled (lowly about twenty minutes, take them out, and {mother them with onion-fauce, Farley, 20, Another way to boil a Duck. Pour boiling milk and water over your duck ; let it lie an hour or two ; boil it gently in plenty of water full half an hour.— Onion-fauce. Majon, 271. To boll a Duck, or a Rabbit, with Onions. Boil your duck, or rabbit, in a good deal of water; be fure to fkim your water, for there will always rife a feum, which if it boils down, will difcolour your fowls, &c. They will take about half an hour boiling. For fauce—your onions mull be peeled, and throw them into water as you peel them; then cut them into thin flices, boil them in milk and water, and fkim the liquor. Half an hour will boil them. Throw them into a clean fieve to drain ; chop them, and rub them through a cul- lender ; put them into a faucepan, fhake in a little flour ; put to them two or three fpoonfuls of cream, and a good piece of but- ter ; flew them all together over the fire till they are thick and fine ; lay the duck, or rahhit, in the difh, and pour the fauce all over. I f a rabbit, you mult pluck out the jaw-bones, and flick one in each eye, the fmall end inwards. Or you may make this fauce for change:—take one large onion, cut it fmall, half a handful of parfley clean wafhed and picked; chop it fmall, a lettuce cut fmall, a quarter of a pint of good gravy, a good piece of butter rolled in a little flour; add a little juice of lemon, a little pepper and fait. Let them all flew together for half an hour; then add two fpoonfuls ol red wine. ThisOf Boiling- ley Another This fauce is moll; proper for a duck. Lay the duck in your difh, and pour the fauce over it. Glajfe, 82. To boil Pigeons. Scald and draw your pigeons, and take out the craw as cleail as poflible. Wafli them in feveral waters, and, having cut off the pinions, turn their legs under their wings, dredge them, and put them into foft cold water. Having boiled them very (lowly a quarter of an hour, di(h them up, and pour over them good melted butter. Lay round them a little broccoli, and ferve them up with butter and parfley. Farley, 20. Pigeons will not take more than a quarter of an hour boiling. They (hould be boiled by themfelves, and may be eaten with ba- con, greens, fpinach, afparagus, or parfley and butter. Mafon, 275. Another way. Boil your pigeons by themfelves for fifteen minutes ; then boil a handfome fquare piece of bacon, and lay in the middle ; flew fome fpinach to lay round, and lay the pigeons on the fpi- nach. Garnifli your diflr with parfley laid in a plate before the fire to crifp. Or you may lay one pigeon in the middle, and the reft round, and the fpinach between each pigeon, and a (lice of bacon on each pigeon. Garnifli with dices of bacon, and melted butter in a cup. To boil a Partridge. Boil your partridges quick in a good deal of water, and fifteen minutes will be fufficient. For fauce—take a quarter of a pint of cream, and a piece of frefh butter as large as a walnut; ftir it one way till it is melted, and pour it into the dilh. Farley, 21. Another way. Trufs two or three partridges as for boiling; lard them with ham, bacon, and anchovies; braze them as ufual; when done,, ikim and fift the fauce, and add a little cullis. When ready to ferve, add the fqueeze of a lenaon* Dalrymplc} 234, 1Of Boiling• Another way. Let your partridges be covered with water. Fifteen minutes Will boil'them, for fauce—celery fatice, liver-fauce, mufti- room-fauce, or onion-fauce. Mafon, 303. I Q’o boil Pheafants. Boil them in a great deal of water; if large, three quarters of an hour will boil them; if fmall, half an hour. For fauce— white celery hewed and thickened with cream, and a bit of but- ter rolled in flour. Lay the pheafants in the difh, and pour the fauce over them. Mafon, 306. G Ioffe, 98. Obferve fo to flew your celery, that the liquor may not be all watted before you put in your cream. Seafon with fait to your palate. Garnifh with lemon. ITo boil Woodcocks: Take a pound of lean beef, cut it into pieces, and put it into a fauce-pan, with two quarts of water, an onion ftuck with three or four cloves, two blades of mace, and fome whole pepper: boil all thefe gently till half is wafted-; then ftrain it off into an- other fauce-pan. Draw the woodcocks, and lay the trail in a plate; put the woodcocks into the gravy, and let them boil for twelve minutes. While they are doing, chop the trail and liver fmall, put them into a fmall fauce-pan with a little mace, pour on them five or fix fpoonfuls of the gravy the woodcocks are boiled in; then take the crumb of a ftale roll, rub it fine in a difti before a fire ; put to the trail, in a' fmall fauce-pan, half a pint of red port, a piece of butter rolled in flour ; fet all over the lire, and fhake it round till the butter is melted; then put in the crumbs of bread, and fhake the fauce-pan round. Lay the woodcocks in the difh, and pour the fauce over them. Mafon, 273. Glafj'c, 99. Farley, 21. fo boil Pickled Pork. Be fure you put your pork ,.n when the water boils. If a middling piece, an hour will boil it ; if a very large piece, an hour and an half, or two hours. If you boil pickled pork too long. * «Of Bolling), 31 Jcnic, it will go to a jelly. You will know when it is done, by trying it with a fork. Glaffe, 20. Pork fhould be very well boiled; a leg of pork of fix pounds will take about two hours ; the hand mult be boiled till very ten- der. Serve it up with peafe-pudding, favoys, or any greens. Mafon, 175. . To boil Pigs’ Pettitoes. Take up the heart, liver, and lights, when they have boiled ten minutes, and Hired them pretty fmall; let the feet boil till they are pretty tender, then take them out and fplit them ; thicken your gravy with flour and butter, put in your mince-meat, a flice of lemon, a fpoonful of white wine, a little fait, and boil it a little; beat the yolk of an egg, add to it two fpoonfuls of good cream, and a little grated nutmeg ; put in your pettitoes, fhake it over the fire, but do not let it boil. Lay fippets round your difh, pour in your mince-meat, lay the feet over them the fkin fide up, and fend them to the table. Raffald, 57. To boil Salmon crifp. When the falmon is fcaled and gutted, cut off the head and tail, cut the body through into flices an inch and an half thick* throw them into a large pan of pump-water. When they are all put in, fprinkle a handful of bay-falt upon the water, ftir it about, and then take out the fifh ; fet on a large deep ftew-panp boil the head and tail, but do not fplit the head; put in fome fait, but no vinegar. When they have boiled ten minutes, flcim the water very clean, and put in the flices. When they are boiled enough, take them out, lay the head and the tail in the dhh, and the flices round. T. his muff be for a large company. The head or tail may be drefled alone, or with one or two flices * or Hie flices alone. It is done in great perfection in the falmon countries; but if the falmon is very frefh, it will be very good in London. Mafon, 213* Anothei way. . Scale your falmon, take out the blood, wafli it well, and lay it on a fflh-plate; put your water in a li/h-pan with a little fait. * WhenOf Boiling'. When it boils, put in your filh for half a minute, then take it out for a minute or fwo. When you have done it four times, boil it till it is enough. When you take it out of the filh-pan, fet it over the water to drain ; cover it well with a clean cloth dipped in hot water ; fry fome fmall fifhes, or a few flices of felmon, and lay round it. Garnilh with fcraped horfe-radilh and fennel. Rajfald, 23. Another way. Take a bit of falmon, of any bignefs, without being fcaled; tie it tip in a cloth, or with packthread; put jt in a velfel much ,of its bignefs, with a good bit of butter or broth, and half red wine, fait, whole pepper, a faggot of parlley, thyme, laurel, two or three cloves, bits of carrots, and fliced onions. When done, drain it, and ferve it upon a napkin, and the fauces in boats. Clermont, 358. Dalrymple, 294. To boil a Cod's Head and Shoulders. Take out the gills and the blood clean from the bone ; wafh the head very clean, rub over it a little fait, and a glafs of alle- gar; then lay it on your fifh-plate. When your water boils, throw in a good handful of fait, with a glafs of allegar; then put in your filh, and let it boil gently half an hour : if it is a large one, three quarters. Take it up very carefully, and flrip the fkin nicely off; fet it before a brifk fire, dredge it all over with flour, and bafte it well with butter. When the froth begins to rife, throw over it fome very fine white bread crumbs. You mull keep balling it all the time to make it froth well. When it is a fine white brown, difh it up, and garnilh it with a lemon cut in flices, fcraped horfe-radifh, barberries, a few fmall filh fried and laid round it, or fried oyflers. Cut the roe and liver in flices, and lay over it a little of the loblter out of the lauce in lumps, and then ferve it. Rajfald, 21. Farley, 27. Another way. Wafh it, drew fait over it, put vinegar and fait into the wa- ter. If the head be large, it will take an hour’s boiling. Oyfter- fauce, and white-fauce, or what other is agreeable. The filh may be grilled in the following manner:—Strip off the fkin, when boiled, fet it before the fire, ihake flour over it, and bafte33 Of Boiling. it. When the froth rifes, ftrew over it bread-crumbs ; let it be a nice brown. Garnifh with fried oyfters, the roe, liver, horfe- radilh, and lemon. Mafon, 209. To boil Cod. Set on a filh-kettle of a proper fize for the cod; put in a large . quantity of water, with a quarter of a pint, or more, of vinegar, a handful of fait, and half a {tick, of horfe-radifh : let thefe boil together, and then put in the fifh. When it is enough (which will be known by feeling the fins, and by the look ol the fiih) lay it to drain, put it on a hot filh-plate, and then in a warm dilh, with the liver cut in half and laid on each fide. Sauce— ihrimps, or oyfter-fauce. Mafon, 219. To boil Salt Cod. Steep your falt-fifh in water all night, with a glafs of vinegar; it will take out the fait, and make it eat like frelh filh. The next day boil it. When it is enough, pull it in flakes into your dilh, then pour egg-fauce over it, or parfnips boiled and beat fine with butter and cream. Send it to the table on a water-plate, for it will foon grow cold. Raffald, 22. To boil Cod Sounds. Cod founds, drefled like little turkies, is a pretty fide-difh for a large table, or for a dinner in Lent. Boil your founds as for eating, but not too much. Take them up, and let them Hand till they are quite cold; then make a forced-meat of chopped oyfters, crumbs of bread, a lump of butter, the yolks of two eggs, nutmeg, pepper, and fait, and fill your founds with it. Skewer them in the lhape of a turkey, and lard them down each fide as you would do a turkey’s breaft. Dull them well with flour, and put them before the fire in a tin oven to roaft. Bafte them well with butter. When they are enough, pour on them oyfter-fauce, and garnifh with barberries. Farley, 28. To boil a Turbot.

When enough, take off the fifli-kettle, fet it be- fore the fire, then carefully lift up the fifh-plate, and fet it acrofs the kettle to drain. In the mean time melt a good deal of frefh butter, and bruife in either the fpawn of one or two lobfters, and the meat cut fmall, with a fpoonful of anchovy liquor ; then give it a boil, and pour it into bafons. This is the bed fauce ; but you may make what you pleafe. Lay the fi(h in the difh. Garnifh with fcraped horfe-radifh and lemon. GlajJ'e, 177. Another way. Make a brine with a handful or two of fait, and a gallon or more of water: let the turbot lie in it two hours before it is to be boiled ; then fet on a fifli-kettle, with water enough to cover it, and about half a pint of vinegar (or lefs if the turbot is fmall); put in a piece of horfe-radifh. When the water boils, put in the turbot, the white fide uppermoft, on a fifh-plate. Let it be done enough, but not too much, which will be eafily known by the look. A fmall one will take twenty minutes ; a large one, half an hour. Then take it up, and fet it on a fifh-plate to drain before it is laid in the difh. Sauce—lobfter-fauce and white-fauce. Mafon, 211.

When your water boils, put them in, they will take ten or twelve mi- nutes boiling. When you take them up, drain them over the water, then turn the heads into the middle of your difh. Lay round them feraped horfe-radifh, parfley and butter for fauce. Rajfald, 30, Another way, The properefl time for boiling herrings, is when they come before and at the beginning of the mackrel feafon ; they are by many people reckoned better than when full of roe: the flefh is much poorer than at this feafon, when their breeding time is over, and they have had time to feed and recover their flefh. Clean half a dozen herrings, and throw them into a pan of cold water. Air them about, and change the water once; fet on a Aew-pan, with water enough to cover them, fome fait, and a little vinegar. When the water boils, put iq the herrings ; when they are enough, lay them on a fifh-plate, in a warm difh. Sauce—fennel boiled and chopped fmall, with melted butter. To boil Eels.

III. MADE DISHES OF BEEF. AS this is one of the mod important chapters in the book, it may not be improper to give the young cook fome general hints. It is an important point to take care that all the copper veflels be well tinned, and kept perfectly clean from any foulneli or grittinefs. Before you put eggs or cream into your white fauce, have all your ingredients well boiled, and the whole of a proper thicknefs; for neither eggs nor cream will contribute much to thicken it. After you have put them in, do not {fir them with a fpoon, nor fet your pan on the fire, for fear it fhould gather at the bottom, and be lumpy ; but hold your pan at a proper height from the fire, and keep fhaking it round one way, which will keep the fauce from curdling ; and be particu- larly cautious that you do not fuffer it to boil. Remember to take out your collops, meat, or whatever you are drefiing, with a fifh-flice, and ftrain your fauce upon it, which will prevent fmall bits of meat mixing with your fauce, and thereby have it clear and fine. In browning difhes, be particularly cautious that no fat floats on the top of the gravy, which will be the cafe if you do not properly Ikim it. It fhould be of a fine brown, without any one predominant tafte, which mud depend on the judicious proportion in the mixture of your various articles of in- gredients. If you make ufe of wine, or anchovy, take off its rawnefs by putting it in fome time before your difh is ready ; for nothing injures the reputation of a made-difh fo much as raw wine, or frefh anchovy. Be fure to put your fried force-meat balls to drain on a fieve, that the fat may run from them, and never let them boil in your fauce, as that will foften them, and give them a greafv appearance. To put them in after the meat is diflied up, is indifputably the beft method. In almoft every made-difh, you may ufe force-meat balls, morels, truffles, arti- choke-bottoms, and pickled mufhrooms ; and in feveral made- difhes, a roll of force meat may fupply the place of balls ; and where it can be ufed with propriety, it is to be preferred.

PICK a large fine goofe clean, fkin and bone it nicely, and take off the fat. Then take a dried tongue, and boil and peel it. Take a fowl and treat it in the fame manner as the goofe; feafon it with pepper, fait, and beaten mace, and roll it round the tongue. Seafon the goofe in the fame manner, and put both tongue and fowl into the goofe. Put it into a little pot that will juft hold it, with two quarts of beef gravy, a bundle of fweet herbs, and an onion. Put fome flices of ham, or good bacon, between the fowl and goofe ; then cover it clofe, and let it ftew over the fire for an hour very flowly. Then take up your- goofe, and fidm off all the fat; ftrain it, and put in a glafs of red wine, two fpoonfuls of catchup, a veal fweetbread cut fmall, fome truffles, mufhrooms, and morels, a piece of butter rolled in flour, and, if wanted, fome pepper and fait. Put the’goofe in again, cover it clofe, and let it ftew half an hour longer. Then take it up, pour the ragoo over it, and garnifh with lemon. You muft remember to lave the bones of the goofe and fowl, and put them into the gravy when it is firft fet on. It will be an improvement if you will roll fome beef-marrow between the tongue and the fowl, and between the fowl and goofe, as it will make them mellow and eat the finer. Before we conclude this article, it may not be amifs to obferve, that the beft method to bone a goofe or fowl of any fort is to begin at the bread, and take out all the bones without cutting the back ; for when it is fewed up, and you come to ftew it, it generally burfts in the back, whereby the fhape of it is fpoiled.

When it is brown, put in a quart of boiling gravy, an onion or two, a bundle of fweet herbs, a bay-leaf, fome whole pepper, and a few cloves. Cover it clofe, and let it flew foftly till it is tender. About an hour will do, if fmall ; if a large one, an hour and an half. In the mean time make a ragoo. Boil fome turnips almoft enough, fome carrots and onions quite enough ; cut your turnips and car- rots the fame as for a harrico of mutton, put them into a fauce- pan with half a pint of good beef gravy, a little pepper and fait, a piece of butter rolled in flour, and let this flew all together a quarter of an hour. Take the goofe and drain it well; then lay it in the difh, and pour the ragoo over it. Where the onion is dilliked, leave it out. You may add cab- bage boiled and chopped fmall. Glafe, 85.

In the morning cut its head off, and hang it up by its hind fins for it to bleed till the blood is all out; then cut the callapee, which is the belly, round, and raife it up ; cut as much meat to it as you can ; throw it into fpring water with a little fait, cut the fins off, and fcald them with the head ; take off all the fcales, cut all the white meat out, and throw it into fpring water and fait; the guts and lungs muff be cut out. Wafh the lungs very clean from the,blood, then, take the guts and maw and flit them open, wafh them very clean, and put them on to boil in a large pot of water, and boil them till they are tender. Then take off the infide fkin, and cut them in pieces of two or three inches long. Have ready a good veal broth made as follows :—Take one large, or two fmall knuckles of veal, and put them on in three gallons of water ; let it boil, fkim it well, feafon with turnips, onions, carrots, and celery, and a good large bundle of fweet herbs ; boil it till it is half wafted, then ftrain it off. Take the fins, and put them in a ftew-pan, cover them with veal broth, feafon with an onion chopped fine, all forts of fweet herbs chopped very fine, half an ounce of cloves and mace, half a nutmeg beat very fine ; flew it very gently till tender ; then take the fins out, and put in a pint of Madeira wine, and ftew it for fifteen minutes. Beat up the whites of fix eggs with the juice of two lemons, put the li- quor in and boil it up, run it through a flannel bag, make it very hot, walh the fins very clean, and put them in.

If any eggs, feald them ; if not, take twelve hard yolks of eggs, made into egg balls. Have your callapafh, or deep {hell, done round the edges with pafte, feafon it in the infide with chyan pepper and fait, and a little Madeira wine ; bake it half an hour, then put in the lungs and white meat, force meat, and eggs over, and bake it half an hour.

The next morning take fome of the meat you cut off the fhoulders, and chop it fmall, as for faufages, with about a pound, of beef or veal fuet; feafon with mace, nutmeg, fweet marjoram, parfley, chyan, and fait to your tafle, and three or four glaffes of Madeira wine, fo fluff it under the two flefhy parts of the meat; and if you have any left, lay it over to prevent the meat from burning ; then cut the remainder of the meat and fins in pieces the fize of an egg; feafon it pretty high with chyan, fait, and a little nutmeg, and put it into the caliapafh ; take care that it be fewed or fecured up at the end, to keep in the gravy; then boil up the gravy, and add more wine, if required, and thicken it a little with butter and flour ; put fome of it to the turtle, and fet it in the oven with a well butter’d paper over it to keep it from burning, and when it is about half baked, fqueeze in the juice of one or two lemons, and flir it up. Caliapafh, or back, will take half an hour more baking than the callapee, which two hours will do. The guts mull be cut in pieces two or three inches long, the tripes in lefs, and put into a mug of clear water, and fet in the oven with the caliapafh, and when it is enough drained from the water, it is to be mixed with the other parts, and fent up very hot. Raffald, 19. Farley, 22. Another way. I have feen, fays Mr. Verral, many a turtle dreffed ; but I think not all as they fhould be. And as I have the honor of fending feveral to table myfelf, to fome of the politeft gentry in the kingdom, with great applaufe, I fhall give the following receipt from experience, rather than from the general rule of hodge-podging it together. To diffeft it then,—Let its head be chopped off clofe to the fhell, fet it on that part that all the blood may run away ; have plenty of water in pails or tubs; lay your fifh upon the back, or caliapafh, cut off the under fhell, or callapee, in the firft line or partition, from the edge of the caliapafh ; take off that, and immediately put it into water. Next cut off the four fins in the fhoulder and aich-bone joints, andx 86 Turtles and Mock Turtles* and put into water too, and with a cleaver chop out the bones from the Ihoulders and hinder parts, and put to the reft. Take out your guts and tripe clean, and the other entrails, and lay your callapafh in water while you prepare your callapee, which fhould be done as follows :—cut off all fuperfluous bits for your foup, and trim it neatly. Cut little holes in the thick flelh, with the point of your knife; lay it in a difh, and foak it well in Madeira wine, and feafon with chyan pepper, (but not too much,) a little fait, plenty of fhallot and parfley minced and flrewed upon it. Next take the callapafh, and order in the fame manner ; firft cutting off the fhell to the creafe on the other fide of the edge, and put a neat rim of pafte quite round, and adorn it well; pour a little cullis round, and fqueeze the juice of fome lemons or oranges; and they are ready for your oven. The common way is to put fome of the flefli into the callapafh ; but, in my opinion, it is beft to put none. The next to be made ready is your fins and head; blanch them till you can take off the outer fkin \ trim them, and put them into a ftew-pan with the head ; pour in fome Madeira, a ladle of broth, a pinch of chyan, a fmall bundle of onions, herbs, and fhallots, and ftew them tender with a little fait, and ’tis ready ; the two biggeft fins for one difh, and the head and two fmalleft for another. Now cut the fide fhells in pieces, and blanch them fo that you may take out the griftles or jelly part whole. While this is doing, prepare the tripe or guts with a fharp knife; flit them from end to end, and care muft be taken that all is wafhed and fcraped clean ; cut them into pieces about two inches in length, and blanch them. When your broth is made of the flelh, to the tripe in a ftew-pan put as much as will cover it; put in a bunch of herbs, with an onion or two, a couple of whole fhallots, fome mace, and a little fait; ftew all till pretty tender ; take out the herbs, &c. and put butter and flour to thicken it; prov ide a lia- fon as for a fricaffee of chickens, and at your dinner-time tofs it up with the juice of lemon or orange, and it is ready. Next take the jellies of your fide fhells, and prepare for a difh done in the fame manner as the fins and head; Iqueeze in fome juice of orange or lemon, and it is ready. And now for the foup Moft'of which that I have feen or tailed has been poor inlipid fluff. To fay why it was, is faying lefs than nothing. 1 he whole matter is, to Ihew how it may be made good ; thus, they cut all the flefli from the bones into fmall pieces, and to about a pound of meat put a quart of water, and to five or fix quarts, a pint of Madeiia. Take care that it is well flammed. Tie up'Turtles and Mock Turtles. 187 in a bit of linen three or four onions, fome bits of can ot, a leek, 1 fome herbs and parfley, with two or three pinches of chyan, and let it boil with the meat, and fait according to your talte. Let it fimmer an hour, or a little more, and fend it up in a tureen or foup-difh, only the meat and the broth. Thefe feven dirties make a pretty firft courfe ; the callapalh and callapee at top and bottom, foup in the middle, and the other four the corners. Verral, 235. T9 drefs a Mock Turtle. Take the largeft calf’s head you can get, with the fkin on, put it in fcalding water till you find the hair will come off, clean it well, and wafh it in warm water, and boil it three quarters of an hour. Then take it out of the water, and flit it down the face, cut off all the meat along with the fkin as clean from the bone as you can, and be careful you do not break the ears off. Lay it on a flat difh, and fluff the ears with forcemeat, and tie them round with cloths. Take the eyes out, and pick all the reft of the meat clean from the bone, put it in a toffing- pan, with the niceft and fatteft part of another calf’s head, with- out the fkin on, boiled as long as the above, and three quarts of veal gravy. Lay the (kin in the pan on the meat, with the flefh- fide up, cover the pan clofe, and let it flew over a moderate fire one hour; then put in three fweetbreads, fried a little brown, one ounce of morels, the fame of truffles, five artichoke bottoms boiled, one anchovy boned and chopped fmall, a tea fpoonful of chyan pepper, a little fait, half a lemon, three pints of Madeira wine, two meat-fpoonfuls of mufhroom catchup, one of lemon- pickle, and half a pint of mufhrooms. Let them flew flowly half an hour longer, and thicken it with flour and butter. Have ready the yolks of four eggs boiled hard, and the brains of both heads boiled; cut the brains the fize of nutmegs, and make a rich force-meat, and fpread it on the caul of a leg of veal, roll it up, and boil it in a cloth one hour.

REAT care is neceffary to be taken that the pots, or fauce- VJT pans, and covers, be very clean, and free from all greafe and fand, and that they are well tinned, for fear of giving the broth or foups any bralfy tafle, or of injuring the health of thofe who partake of the feveral difhes. When you make any kind of foups, particularly portable, vermicelli, or brown gravy foup, or any other that has roots or herbs in it, always obferve to lay the meat in the bottom of your pan, with a good lump of butter ; cut the herbs and roots fmall, lay them over your meat, cover it clofe, fet it over a very flow fire ; it will draw all the virtue out of the roots or herbs, and turn it to a good gravy, and give the foup a very different flavour from putting water in at the firff. When your gravy is almoft dried up, fill your pan with water. When it begins to boil, take off the fat, and follow the direc- tions pf your receipt for what fort of foup you are making. When you make old peas foup, take foft water ; for green peas, hard is preferable ; it keeps the peas of a better colour. When you make any white foup, do not put in cream till you take if off the fire. Always difh up your foups the laft thing. If it be a gravy foup, it will fkim over if you let it (land. If it be a peas-foup, it often fettles, and the top looks thin. You muff obferve in all broths and foups, that one thing does not tafte more than another, but that the tafte be equal, and that it has a i fine agreeable relifh, according to what you defign it for; and you muft be fure, that all the greens and herbs you put in are | clean walhed and picked.

Cut in four or five heads of celery wafhed clean, a bunch of fweet herbs, eight or ten morels, and an anchovy. Cover the pan clofe, and fet it over a flow fire, without any water, till the gravy is drawn out of the meat; then pour the gravy into a pot or bafon; let the meat brown in the fame pan, and take care it does not burn. Then pour in four quarts of water, let it boil gently till it is wafted to three pints. Then ftrain it, and put the gravy to it; fet it on the fire, add to it two ounces of vermicelli, cut the niceft part of a head of celery, chyan pepper, and fait to your tafte, and let it boil for four minutes. If not a good colour, put in a lit- tle browning, lay a fmall French roll in the foup-difh, pour in the foup upon it, and lay fome of the vermicelli over it. Majon, I97. Rajfald, 4. Farley, 155.

This foup will anfwer beft to be made in frofty wea- ther. When the^cakes are dry, put them in a tin box, with writing-paper between every cake, and keep them in a dry place. This is a very ufeful foup to be kept in gentlemens’ families, for by pouring a pint of boiling water on one cake, and a little fait, it will make a good bafon of broth.

Preliminary Obfervations on Puddings. ^ IN boiled puddings, particular care is required that the cloth be clean, and remember to dip it in boiling water, let it be well floured, and give your cloth a (hake. If it is a bread pud- ding, tie it loofe ; if a batter-pudding, tie it clofe; and never put your pudding in till the water boils. If you boil it in a ba- fon, butter it, and boil it in plenty of water, without covering the pan, and turn it often. When it is enough, take it up in the bafon, let it (land a few minutes to cool, then untie the firing, wrap the cloth round the bafon, lay your difh over it, and turn the pudding out; then take off the bafon and cloth with great care, otherwifea light pudding is liable to be broken in turning out. When you make a batter-pudding, firfi mix the flour well with a little milk, then gradually put in the ingredi- ents, by which means it will be perfectly fmooth and without lumps. But, for a plain batter-pudding, the bed method is to (train0/ Puddings* 257 Strain it through a coarfe hair fieve, that it may neither have lumps nor the treadles of the eggs } and ror all other puddings* (train the eggs when you beat them. With refpedl to baking, «U bread and cuftard puddings require time, and a moderate oven, that will raifeand not burn them. Batter and rice pud- dings a quick oven. Be particularly careful to butter the pan or difh before you put in your pudding. A baked Almond Pudding.

Take care that they do not fall to the bottom of the pot or fauce-pan, for they will then be heavy, and be fure to keep the water boiling all the time. When they are enough, take them up, and lay them in your difh, with melted butter in a boat. To fave trouble, you may get your dough at the baker’s, which will do as well. A Yorkjhire Pudding.

Mix in the fat as you fill them; be fure to put in a good deal of fat, fill the fkins three parts full, tie the other end, and make your puddings what length you pleafe ; prick them with a pin, and put them in a kettle of boiling water. Boil them very foftly an hour, then take thecq out, and lay them on clean ftraw. Glajffe, 256. CHAP,C *69 ) CHAP. XIX, OF PIES. Preliminary Obfervations on Pies. IT may be neceflary to inform the reader, that raifed pie9 fhould have a quick oven, and be well clofed up, or they will fall in the Tides. It fhould have no water put in till juft before you put it in the oven, as that will give the cruft a lbdden ap- pearance, and may probably occafion it to run. Light pafte re- quires a moderate oven, but not too flow, as it will make it look heavy, and a quick oven will catch and burn it, and not give it time to rife. Tarts that are iced, fhould be baked in a flow oven, or the icing will become brown before the pafte is pro- perly baked. Tarts of this fort fhould be made of fugar pafte, and rolled very thin. Pajle for 'Parts. Take one pound of flour, three quarters of a pound of butter ; -mix up together, and beat well with a rolling-pin. Crifp Pajle for Parts.

When you have made your tarts, beat the yftfite of an egg a little, rub it over them with a feather, fift a little double-refined fugar over them, and bake them in a moderate oven. Another way. Having beat the white of an egg to a ftrong froth, put in by degrees four ounces of double-refined fugar, with about as much gum as will lie upon a fix-pence, beat and fifted fine.

THE knowledge of pickling is very efTential in a family, but it is to be lamented, that the health of individuals is often endangered, merely to gratify the age. Things known to be pernicious, are frequently made ufe of, in order to procure a brighter colour to the article meant to be pickled. It is indeed a common pradtice to make ufe of brafs utenfils, that the ver- digrife extradled from it may give an additional tint to all pickles intended to be green ; not confidering that they are communi- cating an abfolute poifon to that which they are preparing for their food. Such inconfiderate proceedings, it is hoped, will hereafter be avoided, efpecially as there is no necellity for having recourfe to fuch pernicious means, when thefe articles will be- come equally green, by keeping them of a proper heat upon the hearth, without the help of brafs or verdigrife of any kind. It is therefore highly proper to be very particular in keeping the pickles from fuch things, and to follow ftridlly the diredlions of your receipts, given with refpedl to all kinds of pickles, • which are greened only by pouring your vinegar hot upon them, and it will keep them a long time. Stone jars are the mod: proper for a]l forts of pickles, for though they are expenfive in the hrlt purchafe, yet they will, in the end, be found much cheaper than earthen vefiels, through which, it has been found by expei* rience, fait and vinegar will penetrate, efpecially when put in hot. Be careful never to put your fingers in to take the pickles * OUt,2 86 Of Tickling. \ out,- as it will foon fpoil them ; but always make ufe of a fpoon upon thofe occafions. To pickle Cucumbers. x Let your cucumbers be as free from fpots as poflible, and take the fmallefi you can get Put them into ltrong fait and water for nine or ten days, or till they become yellow ; and ftir them at lead twice a day, or they will grow foft. Should they be- come perfe£lly yellow, pour the water from them, and cover them with plenty of vine-leaves. Set your water over the fire, and when it boils, pour it upon them, and fet them upon the hearth to keep warm. When the water is almoft cold, make it boiling hot again, and pour it upon them. Proceed in this man- ner till you perceive they are of a fine green, which they will be in four or five times. Be careful to keep them well covered with vine-leaves, with a cloth and dilh over the top, to keep in the fleam, which will help to green them the fooner. When they are greened, put them in an hair fieve to drain, and then make the following pickle for them :—To every two quarts of white wine vinegar, put half an ounce of mace, ten or twelve cloves, an ounce of ginger cut into dices, an ounce of black pep- per, and an handful of fait. Boil them all together for five mi- nutes, pour it hot upon your pickles, and tie them down with a bladder for ufe. You may pickle them with ale, ale-vinegar, or diddled vinegar ; and you may add three or four cloves of gar- lic or fhallots. Rajff'ald, 342. Farley, 236. To pickle Cucumbers in Jlices. Take fome large cucumbers before they are too ripe, dice them of the thicknefs of crown pieces in a pewter difh ; to every twelve cucumbers, dice two large onions thin, and fo on till you have filled your dilh, with a handful of fait between every row; then cover them with another pewter difli, and let them fland twenty-four hours; then put them into a cullender, and let them drain very well. Put them in a jar, cover them over with white wine vinegar, and let them fland four hours; pour the vinegar from them into a copper fauce-pan, and boil it with a little fait; put to the cucumbers a little mace, a little whole pepper, a large race of ginger diced, and then pour the boil- ing vinegar on. Cover them clofe, and when they are cold, tie them down. They will be fit to cat in tw'O or, three days. GIoffe, 270. T9 pickle Mangoes.

Cut a piece out of the fide, and take out the feeds with an apple fcraper or tea-fpoon. Then put them into very firong fait and water for eight or nine days, or till they are very yellow. Stir them well two or three times each day, and put them into a pan, with a large quantity of vine leaves both over and under them. Beat a little roach-allum very fine, and put it into the fait and water they came out of. Pour it on your cucumbers, and fetit upon a very flow fire for four or five hours, till they are pretty green. Then take them out, and drain them in an hair fieve, and when they are cold, put to them a little horfe-radifh, then muftard-feed, two or three heads of garlic, a few pepper-corns, a few green cucumbers fliced in fmall pieces, then horfe-radifh, and the fame as before-mentioned, till you have filled them. Then take the piece you cut out, and few it on with a large needle and thread, and do all the refl in the fame manner. Have ready the following pickle :—To every gallon of allegar, put an ounce of mace, the fame of cloves, two ounces of fliced ginger, the fame of long pepper, Jamaica pep- per, and black pepper ; three ounces of mufiard-feed tied up in a bag, four ounces of garlic, and a ftick of horfe-raddifh cut in flices. Boil them five minutes in the allegar, then pour it upon your pickles, tie them down, and keep them for ufe. Farley, 240. Topickle Onions. Take fome fmall onions, peel them, and put them into fait and water ; fhift them once a day for three days, then fet them over the fire in milk and water till ready to boil ; dry them, pour over them the following pickle when boiled, and cold :— Double-diftilled vinegar, fait, mace, and one or two bav-leaves ; they will not look white with any other vinegar. Another way. Take a fufficient number of the fmallefl: onions you can get. and put them into fait and water for nine days, obferving to change the water every day. Then put them into jars, and pour trefii boiling fait and water over them. Let them {land clofe covered till they are cold, then make fome more fait and water, and pour it boiling hot upon them. When it is cold, put your onions into a hair fieve to drain, then put them into wide-mouthed bottles, and fill them up with diflilled vinegar. Put into every bottle a flice or two of ginger, a blade of mace, and a large tea-fpoonful of eating oil, which will keep the onions white.^88 Of Pickling. white. If you like the tafte of bay-leaf, you may put one or two into every bottle, and as much bay-falt as will lie on a fixpencc. Cork them well up. Farley, 249. To pickle PValnuts black. Your walnuts fhould be gathered when the fun is hot upon them, and always before the fhell is hard, which may be eafily known by running a pin into them ; then put them into a ftrong fait and water for nine days j flir them twice a day, and change the fait and water every three days ; then put them in a hair fieVe, and let them ftand in the air till they turn black ; then put them into flrong ftone jars, and pour boiling allegar over them ; cover them up, and let them ftand till they are cold, then boil the allegar three times more, and let it.ftand till it is cold between every time; tie them down with paper, and a bladder over them, and let them ftand two months ; then take them out of the allegar, and make a pickle for them. To every two quarts of allegar, put half an ounce of mace, half an ounce of cloves, one ounce of black pepper, the fame of Jamaica pep- per, ginger, and long pepper, and two ounces of common fait ; boil it ten minutes, and pour it hot upon your walnuts, and tie them down with a bladder, and paper over it. Raffald, 347. Another way. Take large full-grown nuts, but before they are hard, and lay them in fait and water ; let them lie two days, then fhift them into frefh water; let them lie two days longer, then fhift them again, and let them lie three in your pickling jar. When the jar is half full, put in a large onion ftuck with cloves. To a hundred walnuts, put in half a pint of muftard-feed, a quarter of an ounce of mace, half an ounce of black pepper, half an ounce of all-fpice, fix bay-leaves, and a flick of horfe-radifh ; then fill your jar, and pour boiling vinegar over them. Cover them with a plate, and when they are cold, tie them down with a bladder and lea- ther, and they will be fit to eat in two or three months The next year, if any remains, boil up your liquor again, and fkim it ; when cold, pour it over your walnuts. This is by much the belt pickle for ufe, therefore you may add more vinegar to it ; what quantity you pleafe. If you pickle a great many wal- nuts, and eat them faft, make your pickle for a hundred or two, the reft keep in ftrong brine of fait and water, boiled till it will bear an egg"; and as your pot empties, fill them up with thofe in the fait" and water.

GlaJJ'e, 270. To pickle Walnuts green. Take the largeft double, or French walnuts, before the fhells are hard, pare them very thin, and put them into a tub of fpring water as they are pared; put to them, if there are two or three hundred nuts, a pound of bay-falt; leave them in the water twenty-four hours, then put them into a ftone jar, a layer of vine-leaves, and a layer of walnuts ; fill it up with cold vinegar, and when they have flood all night, pour the vinegar from them into a copper, with a good quantity of bay-falt ; fet it upon the fire, and let it boil, then pour it hot on the nuts; tie them over with a woollen cloth, and let them (land a week ; then pour that pickle from them, rub the nuts clean with a piece of flannel, and put them again into the jar, with vine-leaves, as before-men- tioned ; boil frefh vinegar; to every gallon of vinegar, four or five pieces of ginger, a quarter of an ounce of cloves, a nutmeg fliced, a quarter of an ounce of mace, and the fame quantity of whole black pepper ; pour the vinegar boiling hot upon the wal- nuts, and cover them with a woollen cloth ; let it (land four or five days, and repeat the fame four or five times. When the vinegar is cold, put in half a pint of muftard-feed, a flick of horfe-radifh fliced ; tie them down with a bladder, and then with leather ; they will be fit to eat in three weeks. If they are in- tended to be kept, the vinegar mud not be boiled, but then they will not be ready under fix months. Mafan, 346. To pickle French Beans. Pour a boiling-hot wine over your French beans, and cover them clofe; the next day drain them and dry them; then pour over them a boiling-hot pickle of white wine vinegar, Ja- maica pepper, black pepper, a little mace, and ginger. Re- peat this for two or three days, or till the French beans look green. To pickle Red Cabbage. Slice your cabbage crofs-ways, put it on an earthen difh, and fprinkle a handful of fait over it. Cover it with another difh, kl and29o Of Pickling* and let It Hand twenty-four hours; then put It into a cullender to drain, and lay it in your jar.

Then boil it up, and pour it either hot or cold on your cabbage. Cover it clofe with a cloth till it is cold, if you pour on the pickle liot, and then tie it up clofe, as you do Other pickles. Glaffe, 276. Farley, 246. * * Another way. Take a fine clofe red cabbage, and cut it thin ; then take fome cold ale-allegar, and put to it two or three blades of mace and a few white pepper corns; make it pretty ftrong with fait, and put your cabbage into the allegar as you cut it; tie it clofe down with a bladder, and a paper over that. In a day or two it will be fit for ufe. 70 pickle Mufhrooms. Take the fmalleft mufhrooms you can get, and put them into fpring water, then rub them with a piece of new flannel dipped in fait, and put them into cold fpring water as you do them, to keep their colour; then put them into a fauce-pan, throw a handful of fait over them, cover them clofe, and fet them over the fire four or five minutes, or till you fee they are thoroughly hot, and the liquor is drawn out of them ; then lay them between two clean cloths till they are cold, then put them into glafs bot- tles, and fill them up with diflilled vinegar; put a blade or two of mace, and a tea-fpoonful of good oil in every bottle y cork them up clofe, and fet them in a cool place. If you have not any diflilled vinegar, you may ufe white wine vinegar, or even allegar, but it muff be boiled with a little mace, fait, and a few ftices of ginger; it mull be cold before you pour it on your mufhrooms. If your vinegar, or allegar, is too fharp, it will make your mufhrooms foft: neither will they keep li> long, or appear fo white. Rajfald, 355. F0 pickle Cauliflowers.

Thefe are the flower-buds of a fmall fhrub, preferved in pickle. The tree which bears capers is called the caper-lhrub, or bufh. It is common in the Weltern part of Europe. We have them in fome gardens, but Toulon is the principal place for capers. We have fome from Lyons, but they are flatter, and lefs firm ; and fome come from Majorca, but they are fait and difagreeable. The fineft flavoured are from Toulon. They ga- ther the buds from the blofloms before they are open, then fpread them upon a floor in the room, where no fun enters, and there let them lie till they begin to wither ; they then throw them into a tub of fharp vinegar, and, after three days, they add a quan- tity of bay fait. When this is diflolved, they are fit for packing for fale, and are fent to all parts of Europe. The fined capers are thofe of a moderate fize, firm, and clofe, and fuch as have the'pickle highly flavoured; thofe which are foft, flabby, and half open, are of little value. Mafon, 353. To pickle Samphire. Take the famphire that is green, put it into a clean pan, and throw over it two or three handfuls of fait; then cover it with. Spring-water. Let it lie twenty-four hours, then put it into a clean fauce-pan, throw in a handful of fait, and cover it with good vinegar. Cover the pan clofe, and fet it over a flow; fire. Let it ftand till it is juft green and crifp, and then take it off at that moment; for if it fhould remain till it is foft, it will be fpoiied. Put it in your pickling-pot, and cover it clofe. As foon as it is cold, tie it down with a bladder and leather, and keep it for ufe. Or you may keep it all the year in a very ftrong brine of fait and water, and throw it into vinegar juft before you ufe it. Glajffe, 278. Majon, 352. Farley, 251. To pickle Beet Roots.

Rice-cakes, feed-cakes, or plum-cakes, are bell baked in wooden garths ; for when they are baked in pots or tins, the outfides of the cakes are burned, and they are fo confined that the heat cannot penetrate into the middle, which hinders its rifing.

If you would have it yellow, dilfolve a little faffron in it; you fhould then call it jaune-mange. Or you may make it red, by putting a bit of cochineal into a little brandy, let it Hand half an hour, and ftrain it through a bit of cloth. It is then intitled to the appellation of rouge-mange. Always wet the mould before you put in the blanc-mange. It may be ornamented, w'hen turned out, by flicking about it blanched almonds fliced, or citron, according to fancy. Clear Blanc-mange.

Obferve, that all hams and bacon Ihould hang clear from every thing, and not againft a wall. Obferve to wipe off all the old fait before you put it into this pickle, and never keep bacon or hams in a hot kitchen, or in a room where the fun comes; it makes them all rufty. GlaJJ'e, 266. Farley, 269. To cure Hams. Rub a ham with a quarter of a pound of falt-petre, let it lie twenty-four hours; boil one quart of ffrong old beer with half a pound of bay-falt, half a pound of brown fugar, and a pound and an half of common fait; pour this on the ham boiling hot, rub and turn it every day for a fortnight, and bade it with the liquor when there is opportunity. This is a very good receipt for cur- ing a ham. Majon, 176. Another zvay. Cut off a fine ham from a fat hind-quarter of pork. Take two ounces of falt-petre, a pound of coarfe fugar, a pound of com- mon fait, and two ounces of fal prunella ; mix all together, and rub it well. Let it lie a month in this pickle, turning and ball- ing it every day, then hang it in wood-i'moke as you do beef, in a dry place, fo as no heat comes to it; and, if you keep them long, hang them a month or two in a damp place, and it will make them cut fine and fiiort. Never lay theie hams in water till you boil them, and then boil them in a copper, if you have one, or the larged pot you have. Put them in the cold water, and let them be four or five hours before they boil. Skim the pot well and often till it boils. If it is a very large one, three hours will boil it; if a fmall one, two hours will do, provided it beTo prepare Bacon, Hams, &c. 355 be a great while before the water boils. Take it up half an hour before dinner, pull off the fkin, and throw rafpings, finely lifted, all over. Hold a red-hot fire {hovel over; and when dinner is ready, take a few rafpings in a fieve, and fift all over the difh ; then lay in your ham, and with your finger make fine figures round the edge of your difh. Be fure to boil your ham in as much water as you can, and keep it flamming all the time it boils. It mult be at leaft four hours before it boils. This pickle does finely for tongues afterwards, to lie in it a fortnight, and then hang in the wood-fmoke a fortnight, or to boil them out of the pickle. Yorkfhire is famous for hams, and the reafon is this :—their fait is much finer than ours in London ; it is a large clear fait, and gives the meat a fine flavour. I ufed to have it from Malden, in Eflex ; and that fait will make any ham as fine as you can de- fire. It is by much the bell fait for falting meat. When you broil any of thefe hams in flices, or bacon, have fome boiling water ready, and let the dices lie a minute or two in water, then broil them ; it takes out the fait, and makes them eat finer. GlaJJ'e, 265. To fait Tongues. Scrape them and dry them clean with a cloth, and fait them well with common fait, and half an ounce of falt-petre to every tongue; lay them in a deep pot, and turn them every day for a week or ten days; fait them again, and let them lie a week lon- ger ; take them up, dry them with a cloth, flour them, and hang them up, Raffald, 307. To make Hung Beef. Make a ftrong brine with bay-falt, falt-petre, and pump-wa- ter, and put into it a rib of beef for nine days. Then hang it up in a chimney where wood or faw-duft is burnt. When it is a little dry, wafh the outfide with blood two or three times to make it look black ; and when it is dried enough, boil it for ufe. Another way.

It may hang a fortnight in the kitchen ; and, when you want it, boil it in bay-falt and pump-water till it is tender. It will keep, when boiled, two or three months, rubbing it with a greafy cloth, or putting it two or three minutes into boding water, to take off the mouldinefs. Farley, 273. To pickle Pork. Having cut your pork into pieces of a convenient fize to lie in your powdering-tub, rub them all over with falt-petre; then make a mixture of two-thirds common fait, and one-third bay- falt, and rub every piece well with it. Lay the pieces in your tub as clofe as poflible, and throw a little fait over them. To make very fine Saufiages. Take fix pounds of good pork, free from fkin, gri flies, and fat; cut it very fmall, and beat it in a mortar till it is very fine ; then fbred fix pounds of beef-fuet very fine, and free from all fkin. Shred it as fine as poflible; then take a good deal of fage, wafh it very clean, pick off the leaves, and fhred it very fine. Spread your meat on a clean dreffer or table ; then fhake the fage all over, about three large fpoonfuls ; fhred the thin rind of a middling lemon very fine and throw over, with as many fweet herbs, when fhred fine, as will fill a large fpoon ; grate two nutmegs over, throw over two tea-fpoonfuls of pepper, and a large fpoonful of fait; then throw over the fuet, and mix it all well together. Put it down clofe in a pot. When you ufe them, roll them up with as much egg as will make them roll fmooth. Make them the fize of a faufage, and fry them in butter or good dripping. Be fure it be hot before you put them in, and keep them rolling about. When they are thoroughly hot, and of a fine light brown, they are enough.

BE particularly careful in picking and wafhinggreens of every kind, as dirt and infedls are apt to lodge among the leaves ; and always lay them in a clean pan, for fear of fand or duft, which . frequently hang round wooden velfels. Boil all your greens in a well-tinned fauce-pan by themfelves, with a great quantity of water ; boil no kind of meat with them, as that will di(colour them. All kinds of vegetables fhould have a little crifpnefs ; you mud not therefore boil them too much.35s' Vegetables. To drefs Artichokes'. Twift off the ftalks, put them into cold water, and wafli them well; when the water boils, put them In with the top down- wards, that all the dull and land may boil out. An hour and an half, or two hours, will do them. Serve them with melted butter in little cups. To drefs Afparagus. Scrape your afparagus, and tie them in fmall bundles, cut them even, and throw them into water, and have ready a (lew-pan boiling. Put in fome fait, and tie the afparagus into little bun- dles. Let the water keep boiling, and when they are a little tender, take them up- Boiling them too much will make them Jofe their colour and flavour ; lay them on a toafl which has been dipped in the water the afparagus was boiled in ; pour over them melted butter, or fend them to table with butter in a bafon. To drefs Beans. Boil them in plenty of water, with a good quantity of fait in it till they are tender. Boil and chop fome parfley, put it into good melted butter, and fervethem up with boiled bacon, and the butter and parfley in a boat. Never boil them with the bacon. To drefs Broccoli. Carefully (trip off all the little branches till you come to the top one, and then with a knife peel off the hard outfide fkin that is on the ftalks and little branches, and then throw them into water. Have ready a ftew-pan of water, throw in a little fait, and when it boils, put in your broccoli. When the ftalks are tender, it is enough. Put in a piece of toafted bread, foaked in the water the broccoli was boiled in, at the bottom of your difh, and put your broccoli on the top of it, as you do afparagus. Send them up to table laid in bunches, with butter in a boat. To drefs Cabbage, &c. Quarter your cabbage, and boil it in plenty of water with an handful of fait.

' THE( 361 ) THE ART OF BREWING. HAVING given ample inftrutftions for the preparations of wines, &c. malt liquors fhould not be palled over unno- ticed, as the houfe-keeper cannot be faid to be complete in her bulinefs, without a competent knowledge in the Art of Brewing. Of Water proper for Brewing. To fpeak in general terms, the belt water for brewing is river water; fuch as is foft, and has partook of the air and fun; for this eafdy infinuates itfelf into the malt, and extracts its virtues* On the contrary, hard waters aftringe and bind the pores of the malt, and prevent the virtue of it from being freely communi- cated to the liquor. It is a rule adopted by many excellent brew- ers, that all water which will mix and lather with foap, is proper for brewing, and they wholly difapprove of any other. The ex- periment has been often tried, that where the fame quantity of malt has been ufed to a barrel of river water as to a barrel of fpring water, the former has excelled the latter in ftrength, in a degree almoft double. It may be neceffary to obferve likewife, that the malt was the fame in quality, as well as in quantity, for each barrel. The hops were the fame, both in quantity and quality, and the time of boiling was equal in each. They were worked in the fame manner, and tunned and kept in the fame cellar. Hence it is evident, that there could have been no dif- ference but in the water, and yet one barrel was worth almoft two of the other. But where foft water is not to be procured, that which is hard may be foftened, by expoling it to the air and fun, and putting into it fome pieces of foft chalk to infufe j or, before you begin to boil it, in order to be poured on the malt, put into it a quan- tity of bran, which will foften it a little. The necejfily of keeping the Fejfels clean. Obferve, the day before brewing, to have all your veffels very clean, and never ufe your tubs for any other ufe, except it be to make wines. Let your calks be well cleaned with boiling wa- ter j and, if your bung is large enough, ferub them well with a little3^2 The Art of Brewing. little birch broom, or brufh. If they are very bad, take out the heads, and let them be ferubbed clean with a hand-brufh, fand, and fullers earth. Put on the head again, and feald it well, then throw in a piece of unflacked lime, and flop the bung clofe. General Rules for Brewing. In the firft place, it is neceflary to have the malt clean, as it ought to ftand four or five days after it is ground. bine ftrong Oiflober fhould have five quarters of malt, and twenty-four pounds of hops, to three hogfheads. This will af- terwards make two hogfheads of good keeping fmall beer, with the addition of five pounds of hops. bor middling beer, a quarter of malt makes a hogfhead of ale, and another of fmall beer \ or it will make three hogfheads of good fmall beer, allowing eight pounds of hops. This will keep all the year. Or it will make twenty gallons of ftrong ale, and two hogfheads of fmall beer, that will keep all the year. Any one who intends to keep ale a great while, fhould allow a pound of hops to every bufhel; if to keep only fix months, five pounds to a hogfhead. If for prefent drinking, three pounds to a hogfhead, and the fofteft and cleareft water you can get. Pour the firft copper of water, when it boils, into your mafh- tub, and let it be cool enough to fee your face in ; then put in your mall, and let it be well mafhed. Have a copper of water boiling in the mean time, 'and when your malt is well mafhed, fill your mafhing-tub ; ftir it well again, and cover it over with the facks. Let it ftand three hours, fet a broad fhallow tub under the cock, let it run very foftly, and if it is thick, throw it up again till it runs fine ; then throw an handful of hops in the un- der tub, let your mafh run into it, and fill your tubs till all is run off. Have water boiling in the copper, and lay as much more on as yon have occafion for, allowing one third for boiling and wafte. Let that ftand an hour, boiling more water to fill the mafh-tub for fmall beer ; let the fire down a little, and put it into tubs enough to fill your mafh. Let the fecond mafh be run off, and fill your copper with the firft wort; put in part of your hops, and make it boil quick. About an hour is long enough- When it has boiled, throw in an handful of fait. Have a clean white wand, and dip it into the copper, and if the wort feels clammy, it is boiled enough ; then flacken your fire, and take off your wort. Have ready a large tub, put two (licks acrofs, and fet your draining bafkets over the tub on the flicks, and ftrain your wort through it. Put your other wort on to bod with the reft of the hops ; let your mafh be covered again with wa-the Art of Brewing. 363 ter, and thin your wort that is cooled in as many things as you can ; for the thinner it lies, and the quicker it cools, the bet- ter. ’When quite cool, put it into the tunning-tub. Throw an handful of fait into every boil. When the mafh has hood an hour, draw it off; then fill your mafh with cold water, take off the wort in a copper, and order it as before. When cool, add to it the firft: in the tub. As foon as you empty one copper, fill the other, and boil your fmall beer well. Let the laft mafh run off, and when both are boiled with frefh hops, order them as the two firft boilings. When cool, empty tire mafh-tub, and put the fmall beer to work there. When cool enough, work it, fet a wooden bowl full of yeaft in the beer, and it will work over with a little of the beer in the boil. Stir your tun up every twelve hours; let it ftand two days, then tun it, taking off the yeaft. Fill your veffels full, and fave fome to fill your barrels; let it ftand till it has done working; then lay on your bung light- ly for a fortnight, after which flop it as clofe as you can. Take care to have a vent-peg at the top of the veffel; in warm wea- ther open it; and if your drink hides, as it often will, loofen it till it has done, and then flop it clofe again. If you can boil your ale in one boiling, it will be beft, if the copper will admit of it; if not, boil as conveniency ferves. If, when you come to draw your beer, you perceive it is not fine, draw off a gallon, and fet it on the fire, with two ounces of ifing-glafs cut fmall and beat. Diffolve it in the beer over the fire. When it is all melted, let it ftand till it is cold, and pour it in at the bung, which muft lay loofe on till it has done fer- menting ; then flop it clofe for a month. Let me again repeat, that particular care is requifite that your cafks are not mufty, nor have any ill tafte. If they have, it will be a difficult matter to fweeten them. Waffi your cafks with cold water before you feald them, and let them lie a day or two foaking ; then clean them well, and feald them. Of the proper time for Brezving. The month of March is generally confidered as a proper fea- fon for brewing malt liquor, which is intended for keeping ; be- caufe the air at that time of the year is temperate, and contri- butes to the proper working or fermentation of the liquor, which principally promotes its prefervation and good keeping. Very cold,. or very hot weather, prevents the free fermentation, or working of liquors; therefore, if you brew in very cold wea- ther, unlefs you contrive fome means to warm the cellar while new3^4 The Art of Brewing, new liquor is working, it will never clear itfelf in the manner you would wifh. The fame misfortune will arife if in very hot weather, you cannot put the cellar into a temperate flate. The conlequence of which will be, that fuch liquor will be muddy and lour, perhaps beyond all recovery. Such misfortunes indeed otten happen, even in the proper feafon for brewing, owing iolely to the badnefs of a cellar; for when they are dug in ^prmgy grounds, or are fubjeft to damps in the winter, the li- quor will chill, and become vapid or flat. Where cellars are of this kind, it wilFbe advifable to brew in March, rather than October ; for you may be able to keep fuch cellars temperate in fummer, but you cannot make them warm in winter. The beer therefore which is brewed in March, will have fufficient time to fettle and adjull itfelf before the cold can do it any material injury. The Country, or private way of bufinefs. Several countries have their feveral methods of brewing, as it is pradliced in Wales, Dorchefter, Nottingham, Oundle, and many other places ; but avoiding particulars, I fhall here recom- mend that which I think is the mod ferviceable both in the country and London private families. And, firft, I fhall ob- ferve, that the great brewer has fome advantages in brewing, more than the Imall one; and yet the latter has fome conve- niences which the former has not; for, *tis certain, that the great brewer can make more drink, and draw a greater length in proportion to his malt, than a perfon can from a lefler quan- tity ; becaufe, the greater the body, the more is its united power in receiving and difcharging; and he can brew with lefs trouble and expence, by means of his more convenient utenfils. But then the private brewer is not without his advantages ; for he can have his malt ground at pleafure, his tuns and moveable coolers fvveeter and better cleaned than the great fixed tuns and backs ; he can fkim off his top yeafi, and leave his bottom lees behind, which is what the great brewer cannot fo well do. He can, at difcretion, make additions of cold wort to his two for- ward ales and beers, which the great brewer cannot fo eafily do; he can brew how and when he pleafes, w hich the great ones are in fome meafure hindered from. But, fuppofe a private family fhould brew' five bulhels of malt, whofe copper holds, brim full, thirty-fix gallons, or a barrel; on this water we put half a peck of bran or malt, when it is fomething hot, which will much for- ward it, by keeping in the fleam, or fpirit of the water; when it begins to boil, if the water is foul, fkim of the bran or malt.The Art of Brewing, 365 and give it to the hogs, or lade both the water and that into the math vat, where it is to remain till the (team is near fpent, and you can fee your face in it, which will be in about a quarter of an hour in cold weather; then let all but half a bulhel of malt run very leifurely into it, ftirring it all the while with an oar or paddle,"that it may not ball, and when the malt is nearly mixed with water, it is enough; which I am fenfible is different from the old way, and the general prefent pra£tice; but I lhall here clear that point. For, by not ftirring or mafhing the malt into a pudding confidence, or thin malh, the body of it lies in a more loofe condition, that will ealier and fooner admit of a quicker and more true paffage of the afterladings of the feveral bowls or jets of hot water, which muft run through it before the brewing is ended; by which free pereolation, the water has ready accefs to all the parts of the broken malt, fo that the, brewer is enabled to brew quicker or flower, and to make more ale or fmall beer. If more ale, then hot boiling water muft be laded over fo llow, that one boil muft run almoft off before another is put over, which will occafion the whole brewing to laft about fixteen hours, efpecially if the Oundle way is followed, of fpending it out of the tap as fmall as a draw, and as fine as facie, and then it will be quickly fo in the barrel. Or if lefs or weaker ale rs to be made, and good fmall beer, then the fecond copper of boil- ing water muft be put over expeditioully, and drawn out with a large and faft ftream. After the firft ftirring of the malt is done, then put over the referve of half a bufhel of frelh malt to the four bulhels and an half that are already in the tub, which muft be fpread all over it, and alfo cover the tubs with fome facks, or other cloths, to keep in the fteam or fpirit of the malt; then let it ftand for two or three hours, at the end of which, put over now and then a bowl of the boiling water in the copper, as is before diredled, and fo continue to do till as much is run off as will almoft fill the copper. Then, in a canvas, or other loofe woven cloth, put in half a pound of hops, and boil them half an hour, when they muft be taken out, and as many frelh ones put in their room as are judged proper, to boil half an hour more, if for ale. But if for keeping beer, half a pound of frelh ones ought to be put in every half hour, and boil an hour ami an half brilkly. Now, while the firft copper of wort is boiling, there fhould be fealding water leifurely put over, bowl by bowl, and run off, that the copper may be filled again immediately after the firft is out, and boiled an hour, with nearly the fame quan- tity of frelh hops, and in the fame manner as thofe in the firft copper3^6 The Art of Brewing* copper of ale-wort were. The reft for finall beer may be all cold water put over the grains at once, or at twice, and boiled an hour each copper, with the hops that have been boiled be- fore. But here 1 muff obferve, that fometimes I have not an opportunity to get hot water for making all my fecond copper ot wort, which obliges me then to make ufe of cold to fupply what is wanting. Out of five bufhels of malt, 1 generally make an hogfhead of ale with the two firft: coppers of wort, and an hogfhead of fmall beer with the other two ; but this more or lefs, as it pleafes me, always taking care to let each copper of wort be drained off through a fieve, and cool in four or five tubs, to prevent its foxing. Thus I have brewed many hogfheads of middling ale, that, when the malt is good, has proved ftrong enough for myfelf, and fatisfa&ory to my friends. But for ftrong keeping beer, the firll copper of wort may be wholly put to that ufe, and all the reft fmall beer. Or, when the firft cop- per of wort is entirely made ufe of for ftrong beer, it may be helped with more frefh malt, according to the Londart fafhion, and water, lukewarm, put over at firft with the bowl \ but foon after fharp, or boiling water, which may make a copper of good ale, and fmall beer after that. In fome parts of the north, they take one or more cinders, red hot, and throw fome fait on them to overcome the fulphur of the coal, and then dire&ly thruft it into the frefh malt or goods, where it lies till all the wa- ter is laded over, and the brewing done; for there are only one or two mafhings or ftirrings, at moft, neceffary in a brewing. Others, who brew with wood, will quench one or more brand ends of a 111 in a copper of wort, to mellow the drink, as a burnt toaft of bread does a pot of beer; but it muft be obferved, that this muft: not be done with oak, fir, or other ftrong fcented wood, left it does more harm than good. Of bottling malt liquors. Take care that your bottles are well cleaned and dried ; for wet bottles will make the liquor turn watery or mouldy ; and, by wet bottles, a great deal of good beer has been ipoiled. Even though the bottles are clean and dry, if the corks are not new and found, the liquor will be ftill liable to be damaged ; for if the air can get into the bottles, the liquor will grow flat, and will never rife. Many have plumed themfelves on their facing knowledge, by ufing old corks on this occafion, and have fpoiled as much liquor as coft them four or five pounds, to fave the ex- pence of three or four fhillings. If bottles are corked properly, it will be difficult to pull out the cork without a ferew; and, in c order-. The Art of Brewing. 367 order to be fure to draw the cork without breaking, the fcrew ought to go through the cork ; of courfe, the air will find a paf- fage where the fcrew has pafled, and confequently the cork muft have been fpoiled. If a cork has once been in a bottle, though it has not been drawn with a fcrew, yet that cork will turn mully as foon as it is expofed to the air, and will communicate its ill flavour to the bottle in which it is next put, and fpoil the the liquor that way. In the choice of corks, prefer thofe that are foft and free from fpecks. When you once begin to bottle a vcflel of liquor, never leave it till it is completed, othervvife it will bear different taftes. When a velfel of any liquor begins to grow flat, while it is in common draught, bottle it, and into every bottle put a piece of loaf fugar, of about the fize of a walnut, which will make it rife and come to itfelf; and, to forward its ripening, you may fet fome bottles in hay in a warm place; but ftraw will not aflifl its ripening. To recover a barrel of beer that has turned four. To a kilderkin of beer, throw in at the bung a quart of oat- meal, lay the bung on loofe two or three days, then flop it down clofe, and let it (land a month. Some throw in a piece of chalk as large as a turkey’s egg, and when it has done working, (top it clofe for a month ; then tap it. To recover a mujly cajk. Boil fome pepper in water, and fill the ca(k with it fcalding; 1 * 14 O' hot. An excellent compofition for keeping beer with. Take a quart of French brandy, or as mult Englifh, that is free from any burnt flavour, or other ill tafte, and is full proof; to this put as much wheat or bean flour as will knead it into dough, put it in long pieces into the bung-hole, as foon as the beer has done working, or afterwards, and let it gently fall, piece by piece, to the bottom of the butt. This will maintain the drink in a mellow frefhnefs, keep fialenefs off for fome time, and caufe it to be the (tronger as it grows aged. Another way. Take a peck of egg-fhells, and dry them in an oven, break and mix them with two pounds of fat chalk, and mix them with •water, wherein four pounds of coarfe fugar have been boiled, and put into the butt. ToThe Art of Brewing. 36S T.o fop the fret in malt liquors. Take a quart of black cherry brandy, and pour it in at the bung-hole of the hogfhead. and flop it clofe. To recover deadijh beer. When ftrong ale, or beer, grows flat, by the lofs of its fpi- rits, take four or five gallons out of a hogfhead, and boil it with five pounds of honey; fkim it, and, when cold, put it to the reft, and flop it clofe. This will make it pleafant, quick, and flrong. To fine malt liquors. Take a pint of water, and half an ounce of unflacked lime, mix them well together; let it hand three hours, and the lime will fettle to the bottom, and the water be as clear as glafs. Pour the water from the fediment, and put it into your ale or beer. Mix it with half an ounce of ifinglafs, firfl cut fmalt and boiled, and in five hours time, or lefs, the beer in the barrel will fettle and clear. To fine any fort of drink. Take the bed ftnple ifinglafs j cut it fmall with fciflars, and boil one ounce in three quarts of beer ; let it lie all night to cool. Thus diffolved, put it into your hogfhead the next morning, per- fectly cold ; for if it is but as warm as new milk, it will jelly all the drink. The beer, or ale, in a week after, flrould be tapped; or it will be apt to flat ; for this ingredient flats as well as fines. Remember to ftir it well with a wooden paddle, when the ifinglafs is put into the calk. Another way. Boil a pint of wheat in two quarts of water, then fqueeze out the liquid part through a fine linen cloth. Put a pint of it into a kilderkin. It not only fines, but preferves. To cure cloudy beer. . , Rack off your butt, then boil two pounds of new hops in a fufRcient quantity of water, with a due proportion of coarfe fugar, and put all together into the calk when cold. Others have attempted this cure, by only foaking new hops in beer, which, when fqueezed, they put into a calk of cloudy beer. To make Cyder. After all your apples are bruifed, take half your quantity and fqueeze them, and the juice you prefs from them, pour upon the others half bruifed, but not fqueezed, in a tub for the purpofe, having a tap at the bottom. Let the juice remain upon the ° 1 applesThe Art of Brewing. 3 69 apples three or four days. Then pull out your tap, and let the juice run into fome other velfel fet under the tub to receive it ; and if it runs thick, as at the firft it will, pour it upon the apples again till you fee it runs clear ; and, as you have a quantity, put it into your velfel ; but do not force the cyder, but let it drop as long as it will of its own accord. Having done this, after you perceive that the Tides begin to work, take a quantity of ifin- glafs, (an ounce will ferve for forty gallons,) infufe this in fome of the . cyder till it is diifolved; put an ounce of ifinglafs to a quart of cyder, and when it is fo diifolved, pour it into the velfel, and flop it clofe for two days, or fomething more; then draw off the cyder into another velfel. This do repeatedly, till you perceive your cyder to be free from all manner of fediment, that may make it ferment and fret itfelf. After Chrillmas you may- boil it. You may, by pbuting water on the apples, and pref- fing them, make a pretty fmall cyder : if it lliould be thick and .1 muddy, by ufing ifinglafs, you may make it as clear as the reft. You mult dilfolve the ifinglafs over the fire till it be a jelly. For fining Cyder. Take two quarts of Ikim-milk, four ounces of ifinglafs ; cut ! the ifinglafs in pieces, and work it luke-Warm in the milk over the fire ; and when it is diifolved, put it cold into the hogfhead , of cyder, and take a long flick and ftir it well from top to bot- . tom for half a quarter of an hour. After it has fined. Take ten pounds of raifins of the fun, two ounces of turme- ric, and half an ounce of ginger beaten; then take a quantity of raifins, and grind them as you do muflard-feed in a bowl, with a little cyder, and fo the reft of the raifins; then fprinkle the turmeric and ginger among it; then put all into a fine can- vas bag, and hang it in the middle of the hogfhead clofe, and let lie. After the cyder has flood thus a fortnight, or a month; yot* may bottle it at your pleafure. 6 b THR 1( 37° ) THE FAMILY PHYSICIAN; O R, The Country Lady s Benevolent Employment* Want of Appetite.

The paroxyfm of an afthma I muft leave to the phyfician; but as a palliative, nothing is of fo great importance in the afthma, as pure and moderately warm air. Afthmatic people can feldom bear either the clofe heavy air of a large town, or the (harp, keen atmofphere of a bleak hilly country; a medium, therefore, between thefe is to be chofen. The air near a large town is often better than at a diftance, provided the patient be removed fo far as not to beaffedted by the Imoke. Some afthma- tic patients indeed breathe eafter in town than in the country ; but this is feldom the cafe, efpecially in towns where much coal is burnt. Afthmatic perfons who are obliged to be in town all day ought, at leaft, to deep out of it. Even this will often prove of great lervice. Thofe who can afford it, ought to travel into a warmer climate. Many afthmatic perfons who cannot live in England, enjoy very good health in the fouth of France, Portu- gal, Spain, or Italy. < Exercife is likewife of very great importance in the afthma, as it promotes the digeftion, preparation of the blood, See. The blood of afthmatic perfons is feldom duly prepared, owing to the proper adlion of the lungs being impeded. For this reafon, fuch people ought daily to take as much exercife, either on. foot, horfeback, or in a carriage, as they can bear. Buthan. Dr. Mead's Brefcription for the Bite of a Mad Dog. Take afti-coloured ground liver-wort, cleaned, dried,, and powdered, half an ounce; of black pepper, powdered, a quar- ter of an ounce. Mix thefe well together, and divide the powdet into four dofes; one of which muft be taken every morning falling, for four mornings fucceffively, in hall an Englifh pint of cow’s milk, warm. After thefe four dofes are taken, the patient muft go into a cold bath, or cold fpring or river, every morning farting, for a month; he muft be dipped all over, but not ftay in (with his head above water) longer than half a minute, if the water be very cold. After this, he muft go in three times a-week for a fort- night longer. The perfon muft be bled before he begins to ufe the medi- cine.

Bba Burns.37a ^he Family Bhyficlan, it. 1 Burns. In flight burns, which do not break the {kin, it is cuflortiary to hold the part near the fire, for a competent time ; to rub it with fait; or to lay a comprefs upon it dipped in fpirits of wine or brandy. But when the burn has penetrated fo deep as to blifter or break the {kin, it mult be drefled with fome of the fol- lowing liniment:— - Take equal parts of Florence oil, or of fre{h drawn linfeed oil, and lime-water; fhake them well together in a wide mouthed bottle, fo as to form a liniment. It may either be fpread upon a cloth, or the parts affedled may be anointed with it twice or thrice a-day ; or it may be drefled with the emollient and gently drying ointment, commonly called Turner's cerate. This may be mixed with an equal quantity of frefh olive oil, and fpread upon a foft rag, and applied to the part affe&ed. When this ointment cannot be had, an egg may be beat up with about an equal quantity of the fweeteft'fallad oil. This will ferve very well till a proper ointment can be prepared. When the burning is very deep, after the firfl: two or three days, it fltould be drefled with equal parts of yellow hafilicurn, and Turner's ce- rate, mixed together. When the bum is violent, or has occafioned a high degree cf inflammation and there is reafon to fear a gangrene or mor- tification, the fame means mud be ufed to prevent it as are re- commended in other violent inflammations. The patient, in this cafe, mud live low, and drink freely of weak diluting li-- quors. He mud likewife be bled, and have his body kept open. But'if the burnt parts fliould become livid or black, with other fymptoms of mortification, it will be neceflary to bathe them frequently with warm camphorated fpirits of wine, tindhire of \ myrrh, or other antifeptics, mixed with a decodlion of the bark. ] In this cafe, the bark mud be taken internally, and the patient’s diet mult be more generous. Buchan. Colds. Colds are well known to be the effe£ls of an- obftru&ed per- fpiration. We {hall not fpend our time in enumerating all the j various fymptoms of colds, as they are pretty generally known, j It may not, however, be amifs to obferve, that almofl: every j cold is a kind of fever, which only differs in degree. No age, fex, or conftitution, is exempted from this difeafe ; • neither is it in the power of any medicine or regimen to prevent^373 Fhe Family Phyfician. k. The inhabitants of every climate are liable to catch cold, nor can even the greateft circumfpeftion defend them at all times from its attacks. Indeed, if the human body could be kept condantly in an uniform degree of warmth, fuch a thing as catching cold would be impoffible ; but as that cannot be effected by any means, the perfpiration muft be liable to many changes. Such changes, however, when fmall, do not affedt the health ; but, when great, they muft prove hurtful. When oppreffion of the. bread, a duffing of the nofe, unufuai wearinefs, pain of the head, &c. give ground to believe that the perfpiration is obdrudted, or, in other words, that the perfon has caught cold, he ought immediately to leffen his diet, at lead the ufual quantity of his folid food, and to abdain from all drong li- quors. Indead of fledi, fifh, eggs, milk, and other nourilhing diet, he may eat light bread pudding, veal or chicken broth, pa-, nada, gruels, and fuch like. His drink may be water gruel - fweetened with a little honey ; an infufion of balm, or linfeed fharpened with the juice of orange or lemon ; a decodlion of barley and liquorice with tamarinds, or any other cool, diluting, acid liquor. Above all, his fupper fhould be light; as fmall poffet, or wa- ter gruel fweetened with honey, and a little toaded bread in it. If honey fliould difagree with the domach, the gruel may be fweetened with treacle or coarfe fugar, and diarpened with the jelly of currants. Thofe who have been accudomed to gene- rous liquors, may take wine whey indead of gruel, which may be fweetened as above. The patient ought to be longer than ufual in bed, and to en- courage a gentle fweat, which is eafily brought on towards morn- ing, by drinking tea, or any kind of warm diluting liquor. I have often known this practice carry off a cold in one day, which in all probability, had it been negleCled, would have cod the pa- tient his life, or have confined him for fome months. Would people facrifice a little time to eafe and warmth, and pra&ice a moderate degree of abdinence, when the firll fymptoms of a cold appear, we have reafon to believe, that mod of the bad effedis which flow from an obdrudfed perfpiration, might be prevented. But after the difeafe has gathered drength by delay, all attempts to remove it, often prove vain. A pleurify, a peripneumony, or a fatal confumption of the lungs, are the common effedts of colds, which have either been totally negleaed, or treated im- | properly. It is certain, however, that colds may be too much inc 1 ’The Family Thyjician. 374 J* V When a perfon, for every * ght colcl, {huts himfclf up in a warm room, and drinks great quantities of warm liquor, it may occafion fuch a general relaxation of the folids, as will not eafily be removed. It will therefore be proper, when the difeafe will permit, and the weather is mild, to join to the regimen men- tioned above, gentle exercife ; as walking, riding on horfeback, or in a carriage, &c. An obltinate cold, which no medicine can remove, will yield to gentle exercife, and a proper regimen of the diet. T’Jfots Buchan. Fothergit. The Colie. Colics, which proceed from excefs and indigeftion, generally cure themfelves, by occafioning vomiting or purging. Thefe difeharges are by no means to be fiopped, but promoted by drinking plentifully of warm water, or weak poifet. When their violence is over, the patient may take a dole of rhubarb, or any other gentle purge, to carry off the' dregs of his de- bauch. Colics which are occafioned by wet feet, or catching cold, may generally be removed at the beginning, by bathing the feet aftd legs ip warm water, and drinking fuch warm diluting li- quors as w ill promote the perforation, as weak wine whey, or water gruel with a fmall quantity of fpirits in it. Thefe flatulent colics, which prevail fo much among country people, might generally be prevented, were they careful to change their clothes when they get wet. They ought likewife to take a dram, or to drink fome kind of w arm liquor, after eat- ing any k.nd of green tralh. We do not mean to recommend the practice of dram-drinking, but in this cafe ardent fpirits prove a real medicine, and indeed the beft that can be adm.nif- tered. A glafs of good peppermint water will have nearly the fame effect as a glafs of brandy, and in fome cafes is rather to be preferred. The bilious colic is attended with very acute pains about the region of the navel. The patient complains of great thiril. and is general'y coflive. He vomits a hot, bitter, yellow'-coloured bile, which being difeharged, feems to afford fome relief, but is quickly followed by the fame violent pain as before. As the diltemper advances, the propenfny to vomit fometimes increafcs fo as to become almoft continual, and the proper motion of the inteil r.es is fo far perverted, that there are all the fymptoms of an impending iliac paflion. If the patient be young and flrong, and the pulTc full and frer quent, it will be proper to bleed ; after which clyflers may be ad- miniflered.The Family Bhyjician. , 373 I have C b 4 ttiiniftered. Clear whey or gruel, fharpened with the juice of le- mon, or cream of tartar, mud be drank freely Small chicken broth, with a little manna dilfolved in it, or a flight decoilion of tamarinds, are like wife very properj or any other thin, acid, opening liquor. In the bilious colic, the vomiting is often very <Jiffi:ult to re- train. When this happens, the patient may di ink a decoflion of toafted bread, or an infufion of garden mint in boiling wa- ter. Should thefe not have the defired effect, the fa ine draught, with a few drops of laudanum in it, may be given, and repeated according to the urgency of the fymptoms. A fmall quantity of Venice treacle may be fpread in form of a cataplafm, and ap- plied to the pit of the flomach. Clyders, with a proper quantity of Venice treacle or liquid laudanum in them, may likewife be frequently adminiftered. The general treatment of the nervous colic is fo nearly the fame with that of the iliac paflion, or inflammation of the guts, that we (hall not infill upon it. The body is to be opened by mild purgatives given in fmall dofes, and frequently repeated ; and their operation mud be aflifled by foft oily clyfters, foment- ations, &c. The caflor oil is reckoned peculiarly proper in this difeafe It may both be mixed with the clyfters, and given by the mouth. Arbuthnot. Buchan. Consumption. This difeafe generally begins with a dry cough, which often continues for fome months. If a difpofition to vomit after eat- ing be excited by it, there is ftill greater reafon to fear an ap- proaching confumption. The patient complains of a more than ufual degree of heat, a pain and oppreflion of the breaft, efpe- cially after motion ; his fpittle is of a faltilh tafle, and fome- times mixed with blood. He is apt to be fad: his appetite is bad, and his third great. There is generally a quick, foft, fmall pulfe; though fometimes the pulfe is pretty full, and rather hard. Thefe are the common fymptoms of a beginning con- fumption. Next to proper air and exercife, we would recommend a due attention to diet. T he patient fhould eat nothing that is either heating, or hard of digeflion ; and his drink mud be of a foft and cooling nature. All the diet ought to be calculated to lef- fen the acrimony of the humours, and to nourifli and fupport the patient, for this propofe he mufl keep chiefly to the ufe of vegetables and milk. Milk alone is of more value in this difeafe than the whole materia medica.376 $he Family Phyjician. I have known very extraordinary effedts from afles milk in obdinate coughs, which threatened a confumption of the lungs ; and do verily believe, if ufed at this period, that it would feldum fail ; but if it be delayed till an ulcer is formed, which is gene- rally the cafe, how can it be expedled to fucceed? borne extraordinary cures in confumptive cafes have been per- formed by women’s milk. Could this be obtained in lufficient quantity, I would recommend it in preference to any other. If the patient can fuck it from the bread, it is better than to drink it afterwards. 1 knew a man who was reduced to fuch a degree of weaknpfs in a, confumption, as not to be able to turn himfelf in his bed. His wife was at that time giving fuck, and his child happening to die, he fucked her breads, not with a view to reap any advantage from the milk, but to make her eafy. Funding himfelf, however, greatly benefited by it, he continued to fuck her till he became perfectly well, and is at prefent a drong and healthy man. Cows milk is mod readily obtained of any ; and though it may not be fo eafiiy digeded as that of ades or mares, it may be rendered lighter, by adding to it an equal quantity of barley- water, or allowing it to dand mr fome hours, and afterwards tak- ing off the cream. If it fhould, notwirhftanding, prove heavy on the domach, a fmail quantity of brandy or rum, wiTh a little fugar, may be added, which will render it both more light and jiourilhing. For the patient’s drink, we would recommend infiifions of the bitter plants, as ground-ivy, the leffcr centaury, camomile dowers, or water trefoil. Thefe infufions may be drank at plea- fure. They drengthen the domach, promote digedion, redfify the blood, and at the fame time anfwer all the purpofes of dilu- tion ; and quench third much better than things that are lufci- ous or fweet. But if the patient fpits blond, he ought to ufe, for his ordinary drink, infufions or decodtions of the vulnerary roots, plants, &c. Sieevens. TijJ'ot. Buchan. Chilblains. Chilblains often attack children in cold weather. They arc generally occafioned by the feet or hands being kept wet or cold, and afterwards fuddenly heated. When children are cold, in- dcad of taking exercife to warm themfelves gradually, they run to the fire. This occafions a hidden rarefadtion of the humours, and an infardtion of the veifels; which being often repeated, the veflels are, at lad, over-didended, and forced to give way.rfhe Family Fhyftcian. 377 To prevent it, violent cold and fudden heat mud: be equally avoided.. When the parts begin to look red and fwell, the pa- tient ought to be purged, and to have the affe£ted parts rubbed frequently with muftard and brandy, or fomething of a warming nature. They ought likewife to be covered with flannel, and kept warm and dry. Some apply warm alhes betwixt cloth to the fwelled parts, which frequently help to reduce them-. When there is a lore, it mult be drefled with Turner’s cerate, the ointment of tutty, the plalter of cerus, or fome other drying ointment. Thefe fores are indeed troublefome, but feldom dan- gerous. They generally heal as foon as the warm weather fets in. Buchan. Coftivenefs. Coftivenefs is increafed by keeping the body too warm, and by every thing that promotes the perfpiration ; as wearing flan- nel, lying too long in bed, &c. Intenfe thought, and a leden- tary life, are likewife hurtful. All the fecretions and excretions are promoted by moderate exercifc without doors, and by a gay, j cheerful, fprightly temper of mind. Thofe who are troubled with coftivenefs, ought, if poftible, to remedy it by diet, as the conftant ufe of medicines for that pur- pofe is amended with many inconveniencies, and often with bad Confequenc’es. I never knew any one get into a habit of taking medicine for keeping the body open, who could leave it off. In time, the cuftom becomes neceffary ; and generally ends in a to- tal relaxation of the bowels, indigeftion, lofs of appetite, wafting of the ftrength, and death. When the body cannot be kept open without medicine, I would recommend gentle dofes of rhubarb to be taken twice or thrice a week. This is not near fo injurious to the ftomach, as aloes, jalap, or the other draftic purgatives fo much in ufe. In- fufions of fenna and manna may likewife be taken, or half an ounce of foluble tartar dilfolved in water gruel. About the fize of a nutmeg of lenitive eleftuary, taken twice or thrice a day, generally anfwers the purpofe very well. Common Cough. A cough is generally the effe£t of a cold, which has either been improperly treated, or entirely negletted. When it proves ob- ftmate, there is always reafon to fear the confequenccs, as this fhews a weak ftate of the lungs, and is often the fore-runner of a confumption. When the cough is not attended with any degree of fever, J| j and3 7 8 The Family Vhyfician. and the fpittle is vifcid and tough, (harp pe&oral medicines are to be adminidered ; as gum ammoniac, fquills, &c.' Two table fpoonfuls of the folution of gum ammoniac may be taken three or four times a day, more or lefs, according to the age or con- ditution of the patient. Squills may be given various ways; two ounces of vinegar, the oxymel, or the fyrup, may be mixed with the fame quantity of limple cinnamon water ; to which jipay be added an ounce of common water, and an ounce of bal- famic fyrup. Two table fpoonfuls of this mixture may be taken three or four times a day. A fyrup made of equal parts of lemon-juice, honey, and fu- gar-candy, is likewife very proper in this kind of cough. A ta- ble fpoonful of it may be taken at pleafure. In obdinate coughs, proceeding from a flux of humours upon the lungs, it will often be neceflary, belides expt&orating medi- cines, to have recourfe to ilfues, fetons, or fome other drain. In this cafe I have often obferved the mod; happy effects from a Burgqndy pitch plafler applied between the ihoulders. I have ordered this Ample remedy in the mod obdinate coughs, in a great number of cafes, and in many different conftitutionS, with- out ever knowing it fail to give relief, unlefs there were evident figns of an ulcer in the lungs. But coughs proceed from many other caufes befldes defluxions upon the lungs. In thefe cafes the cure is not to be attempted by pe£toral medicines. Thus, in a cough proceeding from a foul- nefs and debility of the flomach, fyrups, oils, mucilages, and all kinds of balfamic medicines do hurt. "1 he Jicmach cough may be known from one that is owing ro a fault in the lungs by this —that in the latter, the patient coughs whenever he inlpires, or draws in his breath fully ; but in the former, that does not hap- pen. TiJJot. Buchan. Chambers. The Cramp. Cramps are often prevented or cured by compreflion. Thus cramps in the legs are prevented, and fometimes removed, by tight bandages ; and when convullions arife from a flatulent de- tention of the intedines, or from fpafms beginning in them, they may be often lelfened or cured, by making a pretty drong com- prefTion upon the abdomen, by means of a broad belt. A roll of brimdone held in the hands is frequently ufed as a remedy for cramps. Though this feems to owe its effefts chiefly to imagination, yet, as it fometimes fucceeds, it merits a trial.

Take of broom-feed, well powdered and fifted, one drachm ; let it deep twelve hours in a glafs and an half of good rich white- wine, and take it in the morning fading, having fird lhaken it, fo that the whole may be fwallowed. Walk after it, it you are able, or ufe what exercife you can without fatigue, tor an hour and an half* ; after which you mud be lure to take two ounces of olive oil ; and you mud not eat or drink any thing in lefs than half an hour, or an hour, after taking the oil. Repeat this. every other day, or once in three days, and not oltener, till cured ; and do not let blood, or ufe any other remedy during the courfe Nothing can be more gentle and fafe than the operation of this r, remedy, and it often has little or no fenfible one. If the dropfy is in the body, it difcharges it by urine, without any inconveni- ence; if it is between the fkin and flclh, it eaufes blillers to arife on the legs, by which it will run off \ but this does not happen to more than one in thirty ; and in this cafe no pladers mud be ufed, for they would hinder the difeharge ; but you mud apply red cabbage leaves. If the diforder is caufed by wind, it'dif- pels the phlegm that retains the wind. It cures the dropfy in pregnant women, without injury to the mother or the infant. It alfo cures the afthma, confumption, and diforders of the li- ver. It is good for the bleeding at the nofe, and for venomous ( bites and poifons. The efficacy of the above remedy has been proved by the curs of upwards of fifty dropfical women with child, and by that of more than three hundred other people of both fexes. Not long fince, this recipe was recommended to a lady, who ffeemed to be in, or nearly in, the lalt flage of a dropfy. She was fo much fwoln, that lhe appeared l.ke a woman in the lalt month of her pregnancy, and her diforder had refilled every thing * If the patient is too weak to ufe other exercife after taking the powder, the fcody and iirnbs may be rubbed with a flannel, from time to time, during the hour and an hall, giving reft at intervals, according to ftrength; and indeed the practice ot this exercife for Tome minutes, every night,and morning, may be of great help.

She took the broom- feed, but could not take the whole of the oil; however, in a very few months, her hufband wrote a letter of thanks for her fpeedy and furprifmg recovery. Soon after, the report of this extraordinary cure induced ano- ther lady, W'ho was afflidted with a dropfy, to make trial of the remedy. She was not fo much fwoln as the former lady, but ihe was exceedingly emaciated, and was fo weak, that Ihe was carried like an infant into her carriage, when fhe went to take the air ; and file had failed of relief from the advice of two of the moll eminent phyficians in London, Who had pronounced it an afeites, with eneyfted water. Happily they were too liberal minded to fet their faces againft the remedy, as feme others have fince done, becaufe it was not of their acquaintance. This lady followed the directions of the recipe very exadtly, and was re- itored to health in a few months. Thefe fucceffes induced the lady, at whofe defire it is pub- lifhed, to recommend the remedy with avidity whenever occafion offered; and it has pleafed God to crown her endeavours with fucli wonderful fuccefs, that fhe thinks fhe may venture to af- firm, that fhe has never known it fail to cure, when taken ac- cording to the recipe, and whue there was any degree of ftrength remaining; and that it is al&ioft as certain a fpecific for the dropfy, as the bark is for the intermitting fever. The Gout, As there are no medicines yet known that will cure the gout, we fhall confine our obfervations chiefly to regimen, both in and out of the fit. In the fit, if the patient be young and ftrong, his diet ought to be thin and cooling, and his drink of a diluting nature; but when the conftitution is weak, and the patient has been accuf- tomed to live high, this is not a proper time to retrench. In this cafe, he mud keep nearly to his ufual diet, and fliould take frequently a cup of ftrong negus, or a glafs of generous wine. Wine whey is a very proper drink in this cafe, as it promotes the perfpiration w'ithout greatly heating the patient. It will anfwer this purpofe better, if a tea-fpoonlul of Jal volatile oleojutn, or fpirits of hartfhorn, be put into a cup of it twice a day. It will likewife be proper to give at bed-time, a tea-fpoonful of the volatile.tindure of guajacum, in a large draught of warm wine whey. This will greatly promote perfpiration through the niSlu- ' 1 Man,"jthe "Family Phyfician. 381 Manv things will Ihorten a fit of the gout, and fome will drive it off all together ; but nothing has yet been found which will do this with fafety to the patient. In pain, we eagerly crrafp at any thing that promifes immediate eale, and even ha- zard life itfelf for a temporary relief. This is the true reafort why fo many infallible remedies have been propofed foi the gout, and why fuch numbers have loll their lives by the ufie ot them. It would be as imprudent to flop the fmall-pox from riling, and to drive it into the blood, as to attempt to repel the gouty matter after it has been thrown upon the extremities. The latter is as much an effort of nature to Iree herfelf from an of- fending caufe as the former, and ought equally to be pro- moted. After the fit is over, the patient ought to take a gentle dofe or two of the bitter tindlure of rhubarb, or fome other warm fto- machic purge. He Ihould alfo drink a weak infufion of llo- machic bitters in fmall wine or ale, as the Peruvian bark, with cinnamon, Virginian fnake-rcot, and orange-peel. The diet at this time Ihould be light, but nourilhing ; and gentle exercife ought to be taken on horfeback, or in a carriage. Sydenham. TiJJ'ot. Buchan. 5The Gravely^, Stone« Perfons afflidled with the gravel or Hone, Ihould avoid ali* ments of a windy or heating nature, as fait meats, four fruits* 6cc: Their diet ought chiefly to conlill of fuch as things as tend to promote the fecretion of urine, and to keep the body open. Artichokes, afparagus, fpinach, lettuce, parfley, fuccory, purllane, turnips, potatoes, carrots, and radifhes, may be fafely eat. Onions, leeks, and celery, are, in this cafe, reckoned me- dicinal. The moll proper drinks are whey, butter-milk, milk and water, barley-water, decodtions of the roots of marfh mal- lows, parfley, liquorice, or of other mild mucilaginous vegeta- bles, as linfeed, limetree-buds, or leaves, &c. If the patient has been accultomed to generous liquors, he may drink fmall gin punch without acid. Dr. Whyte advifes patients who are fubjedt to frequent fits of the gravel in the kidnies, but have no Hone in the bladder, to drink every morning, two or three hours before breakfaft, an Englilh pint of oylter or cockle-lhell lime-water. The dodlor very juflly obferves, that though this quantity might be too fmall to have any fenlible effedl in diffolving a Hone in the bladder, yet it may very probably prevent its growth. When38a '’The Family Vhyjician. When a flone is formed in the bladder, the dodor recommends Alicant foap, oyfler or cocklc-fhell lime-water, to be taken in the following manner: he patient mult fwallow, every day, in any form that is leaf! difagreeable, an ounce of the internal part ol Alicant foap, and drink three or fourEnglilh pints of oyfter or cockle-(hell lime-water. The foap is to be divided into three dofes ; the largelt to be taken failing in the morning early ; the fecond at noon ; and the third at leven in the evening; drinking after each dofe a large draught of the lime water; the remainder of which he may take any time betwixt dinner and fupper, in- ftead of other liquors. 1 he patient fhould begin with a fmaller quantity of the lime- water and foap than that mentioned above; at firit, an Englifh pint of the former, and three drachms of the latter, may be taken daily. This quantity, however, he may increafe by degrees, and ought to perfevere in the ufe of thefe medicines, efpecially ■ if he finds any abatement of his complaints, for fcveral months; nay, if the flone be very large, for years. It may likewife be proper for the patient, if he be fevercly pained, not only to begin with the foap and lime-water in fmall quantities, but to take the fecond or third lime-water inflead of the firft. However, after he has been accuflomed to thefe medicines, he may not only take the firfl water, but, if he finds he can eafily bear it, heighten its diffolving power flill more, by pouring it a fecond time on frefh calcined fhells. The caultic alkali, or foap-lees, is the medicine chiefly in vogue at prefent for the flone. It is of a very acrid nature, and ought therefoie to be given in fome gelatinous or mucilaginous liquor; as veal broth, new milk, linfeed tea, a folution of gum arabic, or a decodion of marfh-mallow roots. The patient mull begin with fmall dofes of the lees, as thirty or forty drops, and increafe by degrees, as far as the flomach will bear it. The only other medicine which I fhall mention is the uva urjt. It has been greatly extolled of late both for the gravel and flone. It feems, however, to be in all refpeds inferior to the foap and lime-water; but it is lefs difagreeable, and has frequently, to my knowledge, relieved gravelly complaints. It is generally taken in powder from half a drachm to a whole drachm, two or three times a day. It may, however, be taken to the quantity of fe- ven or eight drachms a day, with great fafety and good effed. Buchan.The Family Fhyjician. 3^3 The Gripes in Children. When an infant is troubled with gripes, it ought not at firffc to be dofed with brandy, fpiccries, and other hot things; but ihould have its body opened with an emollient clyfter, and, at the fame time, a little brandy may be rubbed on its belly with a warm hand before the fire. I have feldom feen this tad to eafe the gripes of infants. If it Ihould happen, however, not to fuc- ceed, a bttle brandy, or other [pints, may be mixed with thrice the quantity of warm water, and a tea-lpconful be given fre- quently, till the infant be eafier. Sometimes a little peppermint water will anfwer this purpofe very well. The Hooping, or Chin Cough, One of the mod effectual remedies in the chin-cough, is change of air. This often removes the malady, even when the change feems to be from a purer, to a lefs wholefome air. This may, in fome meafure, depend on the patient’s being removed frcna the place where the infection prevails. Mod of the difeafes of children are infeftious ; nor is it at all uncommon to find the chin* cough prevailing in one town or village, when another, at a very final! diftance, is quite free from it. But whatever be the caufe, we are fure of the fadft. No time ought therefore to be loll in removing the patient to fome diftance from the place where he got the difeafe, and, if poffible, into a more pure and ? warm air. - When the difeafe proves violent, and the patient is in danger of being fuffocated by the cough, he ought to be bled, efpeciaily if there be a fever, with a hard full pulfe. But as the chief in- tention of bleeding is to prevent an inflammation of the lungs, and to render it more fafe to give vomits, it will feldom be ne- ceftary to repeat the operation ; yet if there be fymptoms of aa inflammation of the lungs, a fecond, or even a third bleeding, f may be requifite. The body ought to be kept gently open. The beft medicines for this purpofe are rhubarb and its preparations, as the fyrup, tin&ure, &c. Of thefe a tea-fpoonful or two may be- given to Ian infant twice or thrice a day, as there is occafion. To fuch as are farther advanced, the dole muft be proportionally incrcafed, and repeated till it has the defiretl effe&. Thole who cannot -be brought to take the bitter tin£ture, may have an infufion of* fenna and prunes, fweetened with manna, coarfe fugar, or ho- ney ; or a few grains of rhubarb mixed with a tea-fpoonful or tyra of fyrup, or currant jelly, fo as to difguife the tafte. Moft children.3^4 *the Family Fhyfician. children are fond of fyrups and jellies, and feldom refufe even A difagreeable medicine when mixed with them. -The garlic ointment is a well-known remedy in North Bri- tain for the chin-cough. It is made by beating in a mortar, garlic with an equal quantity of hogs’-lard, With this the foies of the feet may be rubbed twice or thrice a day ; but the bed me- thod is to fpread it upon a rag, and apply it in the form of a plader. It fhould be renewed every night and morning at lead, tas the garlic foon lofes its virtue. This is an exceeding good medicine, both in the chin-cough, and in mod other coughs of an obdinate nature. It ought not, however, to be ufed when the patient is very hot and feverifh, led it fliould increafe thefe fymptoms. The feet fhould be bathed once in every two or three days in lukewarm water ; and a Burgundy-pitch plader kept condantly between the fhoulders. But when the difeafe proves very vio- lent, it will be neceffary, indead of it, to apply a blidering- plader, and keep the part open for fome time with iffue oint- ment. When the difeafe is prolonged, and the patient is free from a fever, the Peruvian bark, and other bitters, are the mod proper medicines. The bark may be either taken in fubdance, or in a deco&ion or infufion, as is mod agreeable. For a child, ten, fifteen, or twenty grains, according to the age of the patient, may be given three or four times a day. For an adult, half d. drachm, or two fcruples, will be proper. Some give the extradl of the bark with cantharides ; but to manage this, requires a confiderable attention. It is more fafe to give a few grains of cador along with the bark. A child of fix or feven years of age may take feven or eight grains of cador, with fifteen grains of powdered bark, for a dofe. This may be made into a mix- ture with two or three ounces of fimple-didilled water, and a little fyrup, and taken three or four times a day. Buchan. Chambers. The Jaundice. This difeafe is fird obfervable in the white of the eye, which appears yellow. Afterwards the whole fkin puts on a yellow ap- pearance. The urine too is of a faffron colour, and dyes a white cloth of the fame colour. There is likewife a fpecies of this difeafe called the black jaundice. If the patient be young, and the difeafe complicated with no other malady, it is feldom dangerous ; but in old people, where jt continues one, returns frequently, or is complicated with the dropfy,The Family Vhyficidn. 385 dropfy, or hypochondriac fymptoms, it generally proves fatal. The black jaundice is more dangerous than the yellow. If the patient be young, of a lull fanguine habit, and com- plains of pain in the right fide, about the region of the liver, bleeding will be neceflary. After this, a vomit muft be admi- nifiered ; and if the. difeafe proves obftinate, it may be repeated once or twice. No medicines'tfere more beneficial in the jaun- dice than vomits, efpecially where it is not attended with inflam- mation. Half a drachm of ipecacuanha, in powder, will be a fufficient dofe for an adult. It may be wrought off with weak camomile tea, or lukewarm water. The body muft likewife be kept open, by taking a fufficient quantity of Oaftile foap. I have known Harrovvgate fulphur-water cure the jaundice of very long ftanding. It fliould be ufed for fome weeks, ,and the patient muft drink and bathe. The foluble tartar is a very proper medicine in the jaundice. A drachm of it may be taken every night and morning in a cupi Sof tea or water-grueL If it does not open the body, the dofe may be increafed. A very obftinate jaundice has been cured by '1 fwallowing raw eggs. Perfons fubjedt to the jaundice, ought to take as much exer- cife as polfible, and to avoid all heating and aftringent aliments. BuchUn* The Itch. The itch is feldom a dangerous difeafe, unlefs where it is rendered fo by neglect, or improper treatment; If it be fuffered to continue too long, it may vitiate the whole mafs of humours ; and if it be fuddenly drove in, without proper evacuations, it may occafion fevers, inflammations of the vifcera, and other in- ternal diforders; The beft medicine yet known for the itch, is fulphur, which ought to be ufed both externally and internally; The parts molt affedted may be rubbed with an ointment made of the flowers of fulphur, two ounces ; crude fal ammoniac, finely powdered, two drachms ; hogs’-lard* or butter, tour ounces ; if a lcruple or half a drachm of the elfence of lemon be added, it will entirely take away the difagreeable fmelh About the bulk of a nutmeg of this may be rubbed upon the extremities, at bed time, twice or thrice a-week. It is feldom neceflary to rub the whole body ; but when it is, it ought not to be dune all at once, as it is dan- gerous to ftop too many pores at the fame time. Before the patient begins to ufe the ointment* he ought, if he be of a full habit, to bleed, or take a purge or two. It will C c likewife3^6 TBe Family Phyficiatt. Iikewife be proper, during the nfe of it, to take every morning as much of the flower of brimftone and cream of tartar, in a lit- tle treacle or new milk, as will keep the body gently open. He fhould beware of catching cold, Ihould wear more clothes than ufual, and take every thing warm. The fame clothes, the linen excepted, ought to be worn all the time of ufing the ointment; and fuch clothes as have been worn while the patient was under the difeafe, are not to be ufed again, unlefs they have been fu~ migated with brimftone, and thoroughly cleaned, othervvife they will communicate the infe&ion anew*. Pringle. A Diarrhaa, or Loofenefs. A loofenefs, in many cafes, is not to be confidered as a dif- eafe, but rather as a falutary evacuation. It ought, therefore, never to be ftopped, unlefs when it continues too long, or evi- dently weakens the patient. As this, however, fometimes hap- pens, I fhall point out the mofl common caufes of a loofenefs, with the proper method of treatment. When a loofenefs is occafioncd by catching cold, or an ob- ftrudled perforation, the patient ought to keep warm, to drink freely of weak diluting liquors, to bathe his feet and legs fre- quently in lukewarm water, to wear flannel next his fkin, and to take every other method to reftore the perfpiration. In a loofenefs which proceeds from excefs or repletion, a vo- mit is the proper medicine. Vomits not only cleanfe the fto- mach, but promote all the fecretions, which render them of great importance in carrying off a debauch. Half a drachm of ipe- cacuanha, in powder, will anfwer this purpofe very well. A day or two after the vomit, the fame quantity of rhubarb may be taken, and repeated two or three times, if the loofenefs conti- nues. The patient ought to live upon light vegetable food of eafy digeftion, and to drink whey, thin gruel, or barley-water. A loofenefs, occalioned by the obftrudlion of any cuftomary evacuation, generally requires bleeding. If that does not fue- ceed, other evacuations may be fubftituted in the room of thofe which are obftrucied. At the fame time every method is to be taken to reftore the ufual difeharges, as not only the cure of the difeafe, but the patient’s life, may depend on this. * Sir John Pringle obferves, that, though this difeafe may feem trifling, there is no one in the army that is more trouhlefome to cure, as the infection often lurks in clothes, &c. and breaks out a fecond, or even a third time. The fame incpliveniency occurs in private families, unlefs particular regard Is paid to the changing or cleaning oi their clothes, which lali is by no means an eafy ope- ratio*. A peri- jThe Family Vhyjkian* 387 A periodical Ioofenefs ought never to be flopped. It is al- ways an effort of nature to carry off fome offending matter* which, if retained in the body, might have fatal effedls. Chil- dren are very liable to this kind of Ioofenefs, efpecially while toothing. It is, however, fo far from being hurtful to them, that fuch children generally get their teeth with lefs trouble. If thefe loofe ftools fhould at any time prove four or griping, a tea- fpoonful of magnefia alba, with four or five grains of rhubarb* may be given to the child in a little panada, or any other food. This, if repeated three or four times, will generally correct the acidity, and carry off the griping ftools. From whatever caufe a Ioofenefs proceeds, when it is found neceffary to check it, the diet ought to confift of rice boiled with milk, and flavoured with cinnamon ; rice-jelly; fago, with red port; and the lighter forts of flefh-meat roafted. The drink may be thin water-gruel, rice-water, or weak broth made from lean veal, or with a fheep’s head, as being more gelatinous than mutton, beef, or chicken-broth. Buchan. Objlruttions in young Girls. After a female has arrived at that period of life when the menfes ufually begin to flow, and they do not appear, but, on the con- trary, her health and fpirits begin to decline, I would advife, in- iiead of fhutting the poor girl up in the houfe, and dofing her with fteel, afafoedita, and other naufeous drugs, to place her in a fituation where fhe can enjoy the benefit of free air and agree- able company. There let her eat wholefome food, take fuffi- cient exercife, and amufe herfelf in the moft agreeable manner ; and we have little reafon to fear, but Nature, thus aftifted, will do her proper work. Indeed lhe feldom fails, unlefs where the fault is on our fide. This difeharge, in the beginning, is feldom fo inftantaneous as to furprife females unawares. It is generally preceded by fymptoms which foretel its approach ; as a fenfe of heat, weight* and dull pain in the loins ; diftention and hardnefs of the brealls ; head-ach ; lofs of appetite; laffitude ; palenefs of the counter nance ; and fometimes a flight degree of fever. When thefe fymptoms appear about the age at which the menftrual flux ufually begins, every thing fhould be carefully avoided which, may obftru£l that neceffary and falutary evacuation ; and all means ufed to promote it; as fitting frequently over the fleam of warm water, drinking warm diluting liquors, &c. After the menfes have once begun to flow, the greateft care Ihould be taken to avoid every thing that may tend to obftru£t C c 2. them.The Family Phyfician, 9 them, Females ought to be exceedingly cautious of what they eat or drink at the time they are out of order. Every thing that is cold, or apt to four on the flomach, ought to be avoided ; as fruit, butter-milk, and fuch like. Fifh, and all kinds of food that are hard ol digeflion, are alfo to be avoided. As it is im- poflible to mention every thing that may difagree with indivi- duals-at this time, I would recommend it to every female to be very attentive to what difagrees with herfelf, and carefully to avoid it. From whatever caufe this flux is obftrudted, except in the flate of pregnancy, proper means fhould be ufed to reftore it. For this purpofe, I would recommend fufficient exercife, in a dry, open, and rather cool air; wholefome diet, and if the body be weak and languid, generous liquors ; alfo cheerful company, and all manner of amufements. If thefe fail, t,ecourfe mull be had to medicine. When obftrudlions proceed from a weak relaxed date of the folids, fuch medicines as tend to'promote digeflion, to brace the folids, and allift the body in preparing good blood, ought to be ufed. The principal of thefe are iron and the Peruvian bark, with all other bitter and aftringent medicines. Filings of iron may be infufed in wine or ale, two or three ounces to an Englifh quart, and after it has flood for two or three weeks, it may be filtered, and about half a wine glafs of it taken twice a-day : or prepared fteel may be taken in the dofe of half a drachm, mixed with a little honey or treacle, three or four times a-day. The bark, and other bitters, may be either taken in fubflance or in- fufion, as is moft agreeable to the patient. But the menftrual flux may be too great as well as too finall. When this happens, the patient becomes weak, the colour pale, the appetite and digeflion are bad, and oedematous fwellings of the feet, dropfies, and confumptions enfue. This frequently happens to women about the age of forty-five and fifty, and is very difficult to cure. It may proceed from a fedentary life, a full diet, confiding chiefly of falted, high feafoned, or acrid food j the ufe of fpirituous liquors; exceflive fatigue; relaxation ; a -diflolved flate of the blood ; violent paffions of the mind, 5cc. The treatment of this difeafe mult be varied according to its caufe. When it is occafioned by any error in the patient’s re- gimen, an oppofite courfe to that which induced the .diforder, muft be purfued, and fuch medicines taken as have a tendency to reltrain the flux, and counteradt the morbid afFedtions of the iyflem from whence it proceeds. Arbuihnot.The Family Bhyftcian. 3S9 The Bleeding and Blind Biles. A difcharge of blood from the hoemorrhoidal veflels, is called the bleeding piles. When the velTels only fvvell, and difcharge no blood, but are exceeding painful, the dileafe is called the blind piles. A flux of blood from the anus is not always to be treated as a difeafe. It is even more falutary than bleeding at the nofe, and often prevents or'carries off difeafes. It is peculiarly beneficial in the gout, rheumatifm, afthma, and hypochondriacal complaints; and often proves critical in colics and inflammatory fevers. In the management of the patient, regard rnuft^be had to his habit of body, his age, flrength, and manner of living. A dif- charge which might be exceflive, and prove hurtful to one, may- be very moderate, and even falutary to another. That only is to be efteemed dangerous which continues too long, and is in fuch quantity as to wade the patient’s flrength, hurt digeftion, nutrition, and other functions neceflary to life. When this is'the cafe, the difcharge mult be checked by a proper regimen., and aftringent medicines. The diet muft.be- cool, but nourifhing, confiding chiefly of bread, milk, cooling vegetables, and broths. The drink may be chalybeate water, orange whey, defcoftions or infuflons of the aftringent and muci- laginous plants, as the tormentil root, biftort, the marfh-mallow. roots, &c. The Peruvian bark is likewife proper in’this cafe, both as a firengthener and aftringent : half a drachm of it may be taken in a glals of red wine, fharpened with a few drops of the elixir of vitriol, three or four times a-day. The bleeding piles are fometimes periodical, and return jegu-i larly once a month, or once in three weeks. In this cafe they are always to be confldered as a falutary difcharge, and by no means to be flopped. Some have entirely ruined their health by flopping a periodical difcharge of blood from the hoemorrhoidal veins. In the blind piles, bleeding is generally of ufe. The diet mtifl: be light and thin, and the drink cool and diluting. It is like- ■wife neceflary that the body be kept gently open. This may- be done by fmall dofes -of the flowers of brimftone and cream of tartar. They may be mixed' in equap quantities, and a ;tea- fpoonful taken two or three times a-day, or oftener if neceflary. Or an ounce of the flowers of brimftone, and half an ounce of. purified nitre, may be mixed with three or four ounces of the . Cc 3 ( lenitive39° Family Thyjician. 5 lenitive eleftuary, and a tea-fpoonful of it taken three or four times a-day. Various ointments, and other external applications, are re- commended in the piles; but I do not remember to have feen any effects from thefe worth mentioning. Their principal ufe is to keep the part moid, which may be done as well by a foft poultice, or an emollient cataplafm. When the pain, however, is very great, a liniment made of two ounces of emollient oint- ment, and half an ounce of liquid laudanum, beat up with the yolk of an egg, may be applied. TiJJot. Buchan. The Quinfey, or Injlammaiion of the Throat. In general it proceeds from the fame caufes as other inflam- matory diforders, viz. an obdru£ted perfpiration, or whatever heats or inflames the blood. An inflammation of the throat is often occafloned by omitting fome part of the covering ufually worn about the neck, by drinking cold liquor when the body is ■warm, by riding or walking againd a cold northerly wind, or any thing that greatly cools the throat, and parts adjacent. It may likewife proceed from the negleft of bleeding, purging, or any other cullomary evacuation. The inflammation of the throat is evident from infpection, the parts appearing red and fwelled ; befides, the patient complains of pain in fwallowing. His pulfe is quick and hard, with other fymptoms of a fever. If blood be let, it is generally co- vered with a tough coat of a whitifh colour, and the patient fpits a tough phlegm. As the fwelling and inflammation increafe, the breathing and fwallowing become more difficult; the pain affe£ls the ears ; the eyes generally appear red, and the face fwells, The patient is often obliged to keep himfelf in an ereft poflure, being in danger of fuffocation ; there is a conftant nau- fea, or inclination to vomit, and the drink, inftead of paffing into the flomach, is often returned by the nofe. The patient is frequently ffarved at lad, merely from an inability to fwallow any kind of food. When the breathing is laborious, with flraitnefs of bread and anxiety, the danger is gre^t, Though the pain in fwallowing be very great, yet while the patient breathe? eafy, there is not fa much danger An external fwelling is no unfavourable fymp- tom; but if if fuffdenly falls, and the difeafe affefts the bread, the danger is very great. When a qufafey is the confequence of fome other difeafe, which has already weakened the patient, his fituation is dangerous. A frothing at the mPuth> with a iwelled tongue,’The Family Fhyfician. 391 tongue, a pale, ghaflly countenance, and coldnefs of the extre- mities, are fatal fymptoms. It is highly neceilary that the patient be kept eafy and quiet. Violent atfe&ions of the mind, or great efforts of the body, may prove fatal. He fhould never even attempt to fpeak but in a low voice. Such a degree of warmth as to promote a conftant, gentle fweat, is proper. When the patient is in bed, his head ought to be raifed a little higher than ufual. * It is peculiarly neceffary that the neck be kept warm ; for which purpofe feveral folds of foft flannel may be wrapped round it. That alone will often remove a flight complaint of the throat, efpecially if applied in due time. We cannot here omit obferving the propriety of a cuftom which prevails .among the peafants of this country:—When they feel any uneafinefs of the thrpat, they wrap a Hocking about it all night. So effectual is this remedy, that in many places it paffes for a charm, and the flocking is applied with particular ceremonies. The cullom, however, is undoubtedly a good one, and fhould never be neg- ledled. When the throat has been thus wrapped up all night, it mud not be expofed to the cold air through the day, but an hand- kerchief, or a piece of flannel, kept about it till the inflammation be removed. The jelly of black currants is a medicine very much in efleem for complaints of the throat; and indeed it is of fome ufe. It fhould be almofl conllantly kept in the mouth, and fwallowed down leifurely. It may likewife be mixed in the patient’s drink, or taken any other way. When it cannot be obtained, the jelly of red currants, or of mulberries, may be ufed in its Head. Gargles fer the throat are very beneficial. They may be made of fage tea, with a little vinegar and honey, or by adding to half an Englifh pint of the pe&oral deco&ion, two or three fpoonfuls of honey, and the fame quantity of currant jelly. This may be ufed three or four times a day; and if the patient be troubled with tough vifeid phlegm, the gargle may be ren- dered more (harp and cleanling, by adding to it a tea-fpoonful of the fpirit of Jal ammoniac. Some recommend gargles made of a deco&ion of the leaves or bark of the black-berry bufli ; but where the jelly can be had, this is unneceflary. An inflammation of the throat being a moil acute and dan- gerous diftemper, which iometimes takes off the patient very fuddcnly, it will be proper, as foon as the fymptoms appear, to C c 4 bleed39J The Family Phyfician. bleed in the arm, or rather in the jugular vein, and to repeat the operation as circumdances require. It fometimes happens, belore the ulcer- breaks, that the /wel- ling is /o great, as entirely to‘prevent any thing from getting down into the domach. In this cafe, the patient mud inevi- tably peri(h, unled he can be^ fupported in fome other way. This can only be done by nourilhing clyders of broth, or gruel, with milk, Sic. Patients have often been fupported by thefe for feverd days, till the tumour has broke j and afterwards they have recovered. Huxham. Fothergil. 'Phe Rheumatifm. .The acute rheumatifm commonly begins with wearinefs, fhivering, a quick pulfe, re/tle/rnefs, third, and other fymptoms of a fever Afterwards the p-.tient complains of flying pains, which are increafed by the lead motion. Thefe at lad fix in the joints, which are often attended with fwell ng and' infiam- rnatior:, Ii blood be let in this ddeafe, it has generally the fame appearance as in the pleurify. In this kind of rheumatifm, the treatment of the patent is nearly the fame as in an acute or inflammatory fever. The chronic rheumatifm is feldom attended with any confi- derable degree of fever; and is generally confined to fome part- icular part f the body, as the Ihoulders, the back, or the loins. There is feldom any inflammation or fwelling in this cafe. Per- fons in the decline of life are mod fubjedt to the chronic rheu- matifm.' In fuch patien s it often proves extremely obdinate, and fometimes incurable. In this kind of rheumatifm, the regimpn fliould be nearly the fame as in the acute. Cool and diluting diet, confiding chiefly of vegetable fubdances, as dewed prunes, coddled apples, cur- rants or goofeberries boded in milk, is mod proper. Arbufh- not fays, “ If there be a fpecific in aliment for the rheumatifm, “ it is certain'y whey and adds, “ That he knew a perfon " fubjedt to this difeafe, who could never be cured by any other “ method but a diet of whey and bread.” He likewise fays, “ That cream of tartar in water gruel, taken for feveral days, “ will eafe rheumatic pains confidcrably.” This I have often experienced, but found it always more efficacious when joined with gum guaiacum. What I have generally found anfwer better than either of thefe, in obdinate fixed rheumatic pains, is the warm phfler, made as follows: “ Take of gum plader, one ounce ; bliifering * c “ plader.Fbe Family Fhyfician. 392 « plafter, two drachms; melt them together over a gentle fire.” I have like wife known a plafter of Burgundy pitch, worn for fome time on the part affefted, give great relief in rheumatic cafes. Dr. Alexander fays, “ He has frequently cured many -«« obllinate rheumatic pains, by rubbing the part afrefted with “ tintSlure of cantharidcs.” When the common tindlure did not fucceed, he tifed it of a double or treble ftrength. Cup- ping upon the part affefted is likewife very often beneficial, and is greatly preferable to the application of leeches. Tfc ere are feveral of our own domeftic plants which may be ufed with advantage in the rheumatifm. One of the belf, is. the white mujtard. A table-fpoonful of the feed of this plant may be taken twice or thrice day, in a glafs of water or final! wine. The water trefoil is likewife of great ufe in this complaint. It may be infufed in wine or ale, or drank in form of tea. The ground-ivy, camomile, and feveral other bitters, are alfo bene- ficial, and may be ufed in the fame manner. No benefit how- ever is to be experienced from thefe, unlefs they be taken for a confiderable time. TiJJ'ot. Arbutbnct. Floe Rickets. As this difeafe is often attended with evident figns of weak- nefs and relaxation, our chief aim in the cure muff be to brace and ftrengthen the folids, and to promote digeftion and the due preparation of the fluids. Thefe important ends will be bell anfwered by wholefome nourifhing diet, fuited, to the age and ftrength of the patient, open dry air, and fufficient exercife. If the child has a bad nurfe, who either negledfs her duty, or docs not underffand it, file fhould be changed. If the feafon be cold, the child ought to be kept warm ; and when the weather is hot, it ought to be kept cool ; as fweating is apt to weaken it, and | too great a degree of cold has the fame effect. The limbs fhould be rubbed frequently with a warm hand, and the child I kept as cheerful as poffible. The diet ought to be dry and nourifiiing, as good bread, | roafled flelh, &c. .Bifcuit is generally reckoned the beft bread, and pigeons, pullets, veal, rabbits, or mutton, roafted or minced, arc the mod proper fled). If the child be too young for flelh : mfeats, he may have rice, millet, or pearl barley, boiled with rai- finst, to which may be added a little wine and fpice. His drink may be good claret, mixed with an equal quantity of water. Thofe who cannot afford claret, may give the child now and then a wine-glafs of mild ale, or good porter. Sometimes*I'he Family Fhyfuian. 394 Sometimes ilTues have been found beneficial in this difeafa. They are peculiarly neceflary for children who abound with grofs humours. An inlufion of the Peruvian bark, in wine or ale, would be pf fervice, were it poflible to bring children to take it. I might here mention many other medicines which have been recommended for the rickets ; but as there is far more dan- ger in fruiting to thefe, than in negledting them altogether, I chufe rather to pafs them over, and to recommend a proper re- gimen as the thing chiefly to be depended upon. Buchan. 1The Scurvy. This difeafe may be known by unufual wearinefs, heavinefs, and difficulty of breathing, efpecially after motion; rottennefs of the gums, which are apt to bleed on the flighted touch ; a {linking breath ; frequent bleeding at the nofe ; crackling of the joints ; difficulty of walking ; fometimes a fwelling, and fome- times a falling away of the legs, on which there are livid, yel- low, or violet-coloured fpots; the face is generally of a pale or leaden colour. As the difeafe advances, other fymptoms come on ; as rottennefs of the teeth, haemorrhages, or difeharges of tdood from different parts of the body, foul obflinate ulcers, pains in various parts, efpecially about the bread:, dry fcaly eruptions all over the body, &c. At lad, a wading or he&ic. fever comes on, and the miferable patient is often carried off by a dyfentry, a diarrhaea, a dropfy, the palfey, fainting fits, or a mortification of fome of the bowels. I know no way of curing this difeafe, but by purfuing a plan direftly oppofite to that which brings it on. It proceeds from a vitiated date of the humours, occalioned by errors in diet, air, cxercife ; 2nd thefe cannot be removed but by a proper attention to thefe important articles. If the patient has been obliged to breathe a cold, damp, or confined air, he fhould be removed, as foon as poflible, to a dry, open, and moderately warm one. If there is reafon to believe that the difeafe proceeds from a fedentary life, or deprefling paf- fions, as grief, fear, &c. the patient mud take daily as much ex- ercife in the open air as he can bear, and his mind fhould by diverted by cheerful company, and other amufements. Nothing has a greater tendency either to prevent or remove this difeafe, than condant cheerfulnefs and good humour. But this, alas! is feldom the lot of perfons affli&ed with the feurvy ; they arc generally furly, peevifh, and morofe. When the feurvy has been brought on by a long ufe of faded provilions.2fhe Family Phyfician. 395 provifions, the proper medicine is a diet confiding of frefh ve- getables ; as oranges, apples, lemons, limes, tamarinds, water crelfes, fcurvy gral's, brook lime, &c. The ufe of thefe, with milk, pot herbs, new bread, and frefh beer or cyder, will feldom fail to remove a fcurvy of this kind, if taken before it be too far advanced ; but to have this effeft, they mud be perdded in for a confiderable time. I have often feen very extraordinary effedls in the land-fcurvy, from a milk diet. This preparation of nature, is a mixture of animal and vegetable properties, which of all others is the mod fit for redoring a decayed conditution, and removing that par- ticular acrimony of the humours which feems to conditute the very eflence of the fcurvy, and many other difeafes. But people deipife this wholefome and nourilhing food, becaufe it is cheap ; and devour with greedinefs flefh and fermented liquors, while milk is only deemed fit for their hogs. The mod proper drink in the fcurvy is whey or butter-milk. When thefe cannot be had, found cyder, perry, or fpruce beer, may be ufed. Wort has likewife been found to be a proper drink in the fcurvy, and may be ufed at fea, as malt will keep during the longed voyage. A decodlion of the tops of the fpruce fir, is likewife proper. It may be drank in the quantity of an Englilh pint twice a-day. Tar water may be ufed for the fame purpofe, or decodlions of any of the mild mucilaginous ve- l getables; as farfaparilla, marfh-mallow roots, &c. Infufions of the bitter plants, as ground-ivy, the lefler centaury, marfh trefoil, &c. are likewife beneficial. I have feen the peafants in fome parts of Britain exprefs the juice of the lad-mentioned plant, and drink it with good effedl in thofe foul fcorbutic eruptions with i which they are often troubled in the fpring feafon. A flight degree of fcurvy may be carried oft' by frequently fucking a little of the juice of a bitter orange, or a lemon. When the difeafe affedls the gums only, this practice, if con- tinued for fome time, will generally carry it olf. We would, however, recommend the bitter orange, as greatly preferable to i lemon ; it feems to be as good a medicine, and is not nearly fo hurtful to the domach. Perhaps our own forrel may be little inferior to either of them. All kinds of fa 11 ad are good in the fcurvy, and ought to be eat very plentifully, as fpinach, lettuce, parlley, cellery, endive, radifh, dandelion, &c.

Chambers. Spitting of Blood, &c. Spontaneous, or involuntary difeharges o 1 blood, often happen from various parts of the body. Thefe, however, are fo far from being always dangerous, that they prove often falutary. When fuch difeharges are critical, which is frequently the cafe in fevers, they ought not to be flopped. Nor indeed is it pro- per at any time to flop them, unlefs they be fo great as to en- danger the patient’s life, Mofl people, afraid of the fmalleft difeharge of blood from any part of the body, fly immediately to the nfe of flyptic and aflringent medicines, by which means an inflammation of the brain, or fome other fatal difeafe is oc- cafioned, which, hail the difeharge been allowed to go on, might have been prevented. In the early part of life, bleeding at the nofe is very common. Thofe who are further advanced in years, are more liable to hexynoptoe, or difeharge of blood from the lungs. After the middle period of life, hoemorrhoidal fluxes are mofl common ; and in the decline of life, difeharges of blood from the urinary paflages. Involuntary fluxes of blood may proceed from very different, and often from quite oppofite caufes. Sometimes they are ow- ing to a particular conltruftion of the body, as a fanguine tem- perament, a laxity of the veflels, a plethoric habit, &c. At other times they proceed from a determination of the blood to- wards one particular part, as the head, the hoemorrhoidal veins, &c. They may likewife proceed from an inflammatory dilpofi- tion of the blood, in which cafe there is generally fome degree of fever ; this likewdfe happens when the flux is occafloned by an obflrudled perfpiration, or a llri£lure upon the fkin, the bowels, or any particular part of the fyflem. The cure of an hoemorrhage mufl be adapted to its caufe. When it proceeds from too much blood, or a tendency to in- flammation, bleeding, with gentle purges, and other evacuations, will be neceflary. It will likewife be proper for the patient in this cafe to live chiefly upon a vegetable diet, to avoid all flrong liquors, and food that is of an acrid, hot, and ftimulating qua- lity. The body fhould be kept cool, and the mind eafy. When an hoemorrhage is owing to a putrid, or dilfolved (late of the blood, the patient ought to live chiefly upon acid fruits, with milk, and vegetables of a nourilhing nature, as (ago, falop.397 'The Family Fhyjictan. falop, &c. His drink may be wine diluted with water, and fharpened with the juice of lemon, vinegar, or fpirits of vitriol, The belt medicine in this cafe is the Peruvian bark, which may be taken according to the urgency of the fymptoms. When a flux of blood is^ the effeft of acrid food, or of flrong ftimulating medicines, the cure is to be effected by foft and mucilaginous diet. The patient may likewife take frequently about the bulk of a nutmeg of Locatelli’s balfam, or the fame quantity of fperma-ceti. When an obftru&ed perforation, or a flri&ure upon any part of the fyftem is the caufe of an hoemorrhage, it may be removed by drinking warm diluting liquors, lying a-bed, bathing the ex- tremities in warm water, &c. TiJ/it. Fhe Aphthce, or Fhrujh. The aphthoe are little whitilh ulcers affedling the whole in- fide of the mouth, tongue, throat, and ftomach of infants. Some- times they reach through the whole inteflinal canal ; it which cafe they are very dangerous, and often put at end to the infant’s life. . If the aphthce are of a pale colour, pellucid, few in number, ; foft, fuperflcial, and fall eafily off, they are not dangerous; but if opaque, yellow, brown, black, thick, or running together, . they ought to be dreaded. The moft proper medicines for the aphthoe, are vomits, and i gentle laxatives. Five grains of rhubarb, and half a drachm . of magnefta alba, may be rubbed together, and divided into fix dofes, one of which may be given to the infant every four or five : hours till they operate. Thefe powders may either be given in the child’s food, or a little of the fyrup of pale rofes, and may be | repeated as often as is found neceflary to keep the body open. It >' is common, in this cafe to adminilter calomel; but as that me- dicine fometimes occafions gripes, it ought always to be given rto infants with caution. Many things have been recommended for gargling the mouth. :Jand throat in this difeafe ; but it is not eafy to apply thefe in [very young infants. I would, therefore, recommended it to the Inurfe. to rub the child’s mouth frequently with a little borax and jhoney ; or with the following mixture:—Take fine honey, an jounce; borax, a drachm; burnt allum, half a drachm; rofe- 9water, two drachms; mix them together. A very proper ap- plication in this cafe, is a folution of ten or twelve grains of white vitriol in eight ounces of barley-water. Thefe may be applied393 The FanYily Vhyfictan. applied with the finger, or by means of a bit of foft rag tied to the end of a probe. Buchan. The Tooth-ach. This difeafe is fo well known, that it needs no defeription. It has great affinity with the rheumatifm, and often fucceeds pains of the ihoulders, and other parts of the body. It may proceed from obftrudled perfpiration, or any of the other catifes of inflammation. I have often known the tooth- ach occafloned by negledling fome part of the ufnal coverings of the head, by fitting with the bare head near an open window, or expofing it any how to a draught of cold air. Food or drink taken either too hot or too cold, is very hurtful to the teeth. Great quantities of fugar, or other fweetmeats, are likewife hurt- ful. Nothing is more deftrudtive to the teeth than cracking nuts, or chewing any kind of hard fubftances. Picking the teeth with pins, needles, or any thing that may hurt the enamel with which they are covered, does great mifehief, as the tooth is furc to be fpoiled whenever any thing gets into it. Breeding women are very fubjecl to the tooth-ach, efpecially during the firft three or four months of pregnancy. The tooth-ach often proceeds from fcorbutic humours affedling the gums. • In this cafe the teeth art fometimes wafted, and fall out without any confider- able degree of pain. The more immediate caufe of the tooth- ach is a rotten or carious tooth. In order to relieve the tooth-ach, we muft firfl: endeavour to draw off the humours from the part affedted. This may be done by mild purgatives, fcarifying the gums, or applying leeches to them, and bathing the feet frequently with warm wa- ter. The perfpiration ought likewife to be promoted, by drink- ing freely of weak wine whey, or other diluting liquors, with fmall dofes of nitre. Vomits too, have often an exceeding good effedt in the tooth-ach. It is feldom fafe to adminifter opiates, or any kind of heating medicines, or even to draw a tooth till proper evacuations have been premifed, and thefe alone will often effedt the cure. If this fails, and the pain and inflammation ftill increafe, a fuppuration may be expedted, to promote which, a toafted fig fhould be held between the gums and the cheek ; bags filled with boiled camomile flowers, flowers of elder, or the like, may be applied near the part affedted, with as great a degree ^of warmth as the patient can bear, and renewed as they grow cold. The patient may likewife receive the fleam of warm water intoThe Family Vhyfician* 399 his mouth, through an inverted funnel, or by holding his head over the mouth of a porringer tilled with warm water, &c. Such things as promote the difcharge of faliva, or caufe the patient to (pit, are generally of fervice. For this purpofe, bit- ter, hot, or pungent vegetables may be chewed; as gentian, ca- lamus aromaticus, or pellitory of Spain. Opiates often relieve the tooth-ach. For this purpofe a little cotton wet with laudanum may be held between the teeth ; or a piece of (ticking plafter, about the bignefs of a (hilling., with a bit of opium in the middle of it, of a fize not to prevent the (ticking of the other, may be laid on the temporal artery, where the pulfation is molt fenfible. De la Motte affirms, that there are few cafes wherein this will not give relief. If there be a hollow tooth, a fmal.1 piil made of equal parts of camphor and opium put into the hollow, is often beneficial. When this cannot be had, the hollow tooth may be filled with gum malticli, wax, lead, or any fubltance that will (tick in it, and keep out the external air. Keeping the teeth clean has no doubt a tendency to prevent the tooth-ach. The bed method of doing this is to walh them daily with fait and water, a decodtion of the bark, or with cold water alone. All brufhing and fcraping of the teeth is dan- gerous, and unlefs it be performed with great care, does mifchief. De la Motte. Buchan. The Bite of the Viper. The greafe of this animal rubbed into the wound, is faid to cure the bite. Though that is all the viper catchers generally do when bit, I (hould not think it fufficient for the bite of an enraged viper. It would be furely more fafe to have the wound well fucked*, and afterwards rubbed with warm falad oil. A poultice of bread and milk, foftened with falad oil (hould like- wife be applied to the wound ; and the patient ought to drink freely of vinegar >vhey, or water-gruel With vinegar in it, to make him fweat. Vinegar is one of the bed medicines that can be ufed in any kind of poifon, and ought to be taken very lu * The pra&ice of fucking out poifons is very ancient, and indeed nothing can be more rational. When the bite cannot be cutout, this is the moil likely way for extrafting the poifon. There can be no danger in performing this office, a; the poifon does no harm unlefs it be taken into the body by a wound. The per- fon who fucks the wound ought, however, to wafh his mouth frequently with $»lad oil, which will lave him from even the leaft incouveniency. The Bfylti In Africa, and the Merfi in Italy, are famed for curing the bites of poifonous animals by fucking the wound ; and we are told that the Indians in North America practice the fai»e at this day. bcrally.4^° The Family F Joyful an < berally.

A mixture of vinegar and Venice treacle is likewife re- commended ; but I have always found rubbing the part with warm fallad oil fucceed very well. Indeed, when the flings are fo numerous as to endanger the patient’s life, which is fome- times the cafe, he muft not only have oily poultices applied to the part, but muft likewife be bled, arid take fome cooling me- dicines, as nitre, or cream of tartar, and Ihould drink plentifully of diluting liquors, Buchan. Worms. Though numberlefs medicines are extolled for killing and expelling worms, yet no difeafe more frequently baffles the phy- ficians’ (kill. In general, the moll proper medicines for their ex- pulfion, are ftrong purgatives ; and to prevent their breeding, ftomachic bitters, with now and then a glafs of good wine. The beft purge for an adult is jalap and calomel. Five and twenty or thirty grains of the former, with lix or feven of the latter, mixed in fyrup, may be taken early in the morning, for a dofe. It will be proper that the patient keep the hotife all day, and drink nothing cold. The dofe may be repeated once or twice a week, for a fortnight or three weeks. On the intermediate days, the patient may take a drachm of the powder of tin, twice or thrice a-dav, mixed with fyrup, honey, or treacle. Thofe who do not chufe to take calomel, may make ufe of the bitter purgatives \ as aloes, hiera picra, tindlure of fenna, and rhubarb, &c. Oily medicines are fometimes found beneficial for expelling worms. An ounce of falad oil and a table fpoonful of com- mon fait may be taken in a glafs of red port wine thrice a-day, or oftener if the ftomach will bear it. But the more common form of uling oil is in elyfters. Oily clyfters, fweetened with fugar or honey, are very efficacious in bringing away the ftiort round worms called afcardes, and likewife the teres. I have frequently known thofe big bellies, which In children areThe Family Thy ft clan. 4°1 are commonly reckoned a fign of worms, quite removed by giv- incr them white foap in their pottage, or other food. Tanfy, garlic, and rne, are all good againtt worms, and may be ufed various ways. I m ght have mentioned many o her plants, both for external and internal ufe, as the cabbage-ba>k, &cc. but think the powder ot tin, with Ethiops mineral, and the purges of rhubarb and calomel, are more to be depended on. Ball’s purging vermituge powder is a very powerful medicine. It is made of equal parts ot rhubarb, fcammony, and calomel, with as much double refined fugar as is equal to the weight of all the other ingredients. Xhelc mud be well mixed together, and reduced to a fine powder. The dofe tor a child, is from ten grains to twrenty, once or twice a week. An adult may take a drachm for a dofe. Parents who w'ould preferve their children from worms ought to allow them plenty of exercife in the open air; to take care that their food be wholefome and fufficiently folid; and, as far as poffible, to prevent their eating raw herbs, roots, or green trathy fruits. It will not be amifs to allow a child who is fub- je£t to worms, a glafs of red wine after meals; as every thing that braces and ftrengthens the ftomach is good both for prevent- ing and expelling thefe vermin. Ball. Buchan. Of Vomiting. Vomiting may proceed from various caufes ; as excefs in eat- ing and drinking ; foulnefs of the ftomach ; the acrimony of the aliments \ a tranflation of the morbific matter of ulcers, of the gout, the eryfipelas, or other difeafes of the ftomach. It may likewife proceed. from a loofenefs having been too fuddenly flopped \ from the ftoppage of any cuftomary evacuation, as the bleeding piles, the menfes, &c. from a weaknefs of the ftomach, the colic, the iliac paftion, a rupture, a fit of the gravel, worms, or from any kind of poifon taken into the ftomach. It is an. ufual fymptom of injuries done to the brain; as contufions, compreffions, &c. Vomiting may be occafioned by unufual motions ; as failing, being drawn backwards in a cart or coach, &c. It may like- wife be excited by violent paftions, or by the idea of naufeous or difagreeable objects, efpecially of fuch things as have for- merly produced vomiting. Sometimes it proceeds from a re- gurgitation of the bile into the ftomach \ in this cafe, what the: patient vomits is generally of a yellow or greenilh colour, and has a bilter tafte. Perfons who are fubjedt to nervous affections Dd areThe Family Phyfician. 402 are often fuddenly feized with violent fits of vomiting. Ladly, vomiting is a common fymptom of pregnancy. In this cafe it generally comes on about two weeks after the floppage of the menfes, and continues during the firft three or four months. When vomiting proceeds from'a foul domach or indigedion, it is not to be coniidered as a difeafe, but as the cure of a dif- eafe. It ought therefore to be promoted by drinking lukewarm water, or thin gruel. If this does not put a dop to the vomit- ing, a dofe of ipecacuanha may be taken, and worked off with weak camomile-tea. When the obdrudtion of cuftomary evacuations occafion vo- miting, all means mult be ufed to reftore thefe difeharges; or, if that cannot be effected, their place mud be fupplied by others, as bleeding, purging, bathing the extremities in warm water, opening illues, fetons, perpetual bliders, &c. When vomiting is the effeft of pregnancy, it may generally be mitigated by bleeding, and keeping the body gently open. The bleeding however ought to be in (mall quantities at a time,, and the purgatives ihould be of the milded kind, as figs, dewed prunes, manna, or fenna. Pregnant women are mod apt to vomit in the morning, immediately after getting out of bed, which is owing partly to the change of podure, but more to the emptinefs of the domach. It may generally be prevented by taking a difh of coffee, tea, or fome light breakfad in bed. If vomiting proceeds from weaknefs of the domach, bitters will be of fervice. Peruvian bark infufed in wine or brandy, with as much rhubarb as will keep the body gently open, is an excellent medicine in this cafe. Habitual vomitings are fome- times alleviated by making oylters a principal part of diet. A vomiting which proceeds from acidities in the domach, is relieved by alkaline purges. The bed medicine of this kind is the magnefia alba, a tea-fpoonful of which may be taken in a difh of tea or a little milk, three or four times a day, or oftener if necedary, to keep the body open. When vomiting proceeds from violent padions, or affedtions of the mind, all evacuants mud be carefully avoided, efpccially vomits. Thefe are exceedingly dangerous. The patient in this cafe ought to be kept perfectly eaiy and quiet, to have the mind foothed, and to take fome gentle cordial, as negus, or a little brandy and water, to which a few drops of laudanum may uccafionally be added. SupprcJJknjthe Family Phyjician. m SuppreJJion of Urine. Suppreffion of urine may proceed from various caufes ; as an inflammation of the kidnies, or bladder; fmall Hones or gravel lodging in the urinary paffages; hard faces lying in the reftum; pregnancy; a fpafm or contraction of the neck of the bladder; clotted blood in the bladder itfelf; a fwelling of the haemorrhoidal veins, &c. In thefe cafes a bougie may be ufed by any cautious hand, and will often fucceed. In all obftruftions of urine, the body ought to be kept open. This is not however to be attempted by Itrong purgatives, but by emollient clyflers, or gentle infufions of fenna and manna. Clyflers in this cafe not only open the body, but anfwer the pur- pofe of an internal fomentation, and greatly afliH in removing the fpafms of the bladder and parts adjacent. The fo«d mud be light, and taken in fmall quantities. The drink may be weak broth, or decoClions and infufions of muci- laginous vegetables, as marfh-mallow roots, lime-tree buds, &c. A tea-fpoonful of the fweet fpirits of nitre, or a drachm of Caf- tile foap, may be frequently put into the patient’s drink ; and, if there be no inflammation, he may drink fmall gin-punch. PerfonsfubjeCt to a fuppreffion of urine ought to live very temperate. Their diet fliould be light, and their liquor diluting. They fhould avoid all acids and auflere wines, (hould take fuf- ficient exercife, lie hard, and avoid Hudy and fedentary occupa- tions. # Bleeding at the Nofe. Bleeding at the nofe is commonly preceded by forhe degree of quicknefs of the pulfe, flufhing in the face, pulfation of the temporal arteries, heavinefs in the head, dimnefs of the fight, heat and itching of the noflrils, &c. To perfons who abound with blood, this difcharge is very fa- lutary. It often cures a vertigo, the head-ach, a phrenzy, and even an epilepfy. In fevers, where there is a great determina- tion of blood towards the head, it is of the utmofl fervice. It is likewife beneficial in inflammations of the liver and fpleen, and often in the gout and rheumatifm. In all difeafes where bleed- ing is neceflary, a fpontaneous difcharge of blood from the nofa is of much more fervice than the fame quantity let with a lancet. In a difcharge of blood from the nofe, the great point is to determine whether it ought to be Hopped or not. It is a com- mon pra&icc to flop the bleeding, without confidefing whether D d a -it4®4 *fhe Family Fhyjiclan. it be a difeafe, or the cure of a difeafe. This conduit proceeds Irom fear; but it has often bad, and fometimes fatal confe- quences. When a difeharge of blood from the nofe happens in an in- flammatory difeafe, there is always reafon to believe that it may prove falutary; and therefore it fliould be fuffered to go on, at lead as long as the patient is not weakened by it. When it happens to perfons in perfeft health, who are full of blood, it ought not to be fuddenly flopped. In this cafe, when- ever bleeding at the nofe relieves any bad fymptom, and does not proceed fo far as to endanger the patient’s life, it ought not to be flopped. But when it returns frequently, or continues till the pulfe becomes low, the extremities begin to grow cold, the lips pale, or the patient complains of being fick or faint, it muft im- mediately be flopped. For this purpofe, the patient fliould be fet nearly upright, with his head reclining a little, and his legs immerfed in water, about the warmth of new milk. His hands ought likewife to be put in lukewarm water, and his garters may be tied a little tighter than ufual. Internal medicines can hardly be of ufe here, as they have fel- dom time to operate. It may not, however, be amifs to give the patient half an ounce of Glauber’s fait, and the fame quan- tity of manna, diflolved in four or five ounces of barley-water. This may be taken at a draught, and repeated, if it does not ope- rate, in a few hours. If the genitals be immerfed for fome time in cold water, it will generally flop a bleeding at the nofe. This generally fuc- ceeds. After the bleeding is flopped, the patient ought to be kept as eafy and quiet as poflible. He fliould not pick his nofe, nor take away the tents or clotted blood, till they fall off of their own accord, and fliould not lie with his head low. Buchan, Chambers. Head-Ac h. Sometimes the pain is internal, fometimes external; fome- • times it is an original difeafe, and at other times only fympto- matic. When the head-ach proceeds from a hot biiious habit, the pain is very acute and throbbing, with a confiderable heat of the part affe&ed. When from a cold phlegmatic habit, the pa- tient complains of a dull heavy pain, and has a fenfe of cold- nefs in the part. This kind of head-ach is fometimes attended with a degree of ftupidity or folly.The Family Fhyjician. 4°5 Dd 5 In perfons of a full habit, who abound with blood, or other humours, the head-ach often proceeds from the'fiipprelfion of cultomary evacuations; as bleeding at the nofe, fweating of the feet, &c. Alfo coldnefs of the extremities, or hanging down the head for a long time. Whatever prevents the return of the blood from the head, will likewife occafion a head-ach ; as look- ing long obliquely at any object, or wearing any thing tight about the neck, Sometimes the head-ach proceeds from the repulfion or re- trocdTion of the gout, the eryfipelas, the fmall-pox, mealies, itch, or other eruptive difeafes. Inanition, or emptinefs, will alfo occafion head-achs. Nurfes who give fuck too long, or who do not take a fufficient quantity of folid food. There is likewife a mod violent, fixed, conftant, and almofl: intolerable head-ach, which occafions great debility both of body and mind, prevents deep, deftroys the appetite, caufes a vertigo, dimnefs of light, a noife in the ears, convullions, epileptic fits, and fometimes vomiting, coltivenefs, coldnefs of the extremi- ties, &c. When a head-ach attends an acute fever, with pale urine, it is an unfavourable fymptom. In exceffive head-achs, coldnefs of the extremities is a bad fign. When the difeafe continues long, and is very violent, it often terminates in blindnefs, an apoplexy, deafnefs, a vertigo, the palfy, epilepfy, &c. In this difeafe the cool regimen in general is to be obferved. The diet ought to confift of fuch emollient fubftances as wilL correft the acrimony of the humours, and keep the body open ; as apples boiled in milk, fpinach, turnips, and fuch like. The .drink ought to be diluting; fuch as barley-water. The patient ought as much as poflible to keep in an eredl pofture, and not to lie with his head too low. When the head-ach is owing to excefs of blood, or an hot bilious conllitution, bleeding is neceffary. The patient may be bled in the jugular vein, and the operation repeated it there be occafion. Cupping alfo, or the application of leeches to the temples, and behind the ears, will be of fervice. Afterwards a bliltering-plader may be applied lo the neck, behind the ears, or to any part of the head that is molt affecSled. In fome cales it will be,proper to blifler the whole head. In perfons of a grofs habit, ilfues or perpetual blilters will be of fcrvice. The body ought likewife to be kept open by gentle laxatives. When the head-ach is occalioned by the Itoppage of a running4°6 The Family Phyjician. at the nofe, the patient fhould frequently fmell to a bottle of vo- latile falts ; he may likewife take fnufF, or any thing that will irritate the nofe, fo as to promote a difeharge from it j as the herb maflich, ground ivy, &c. A hemicrania, efpecially a periodical one, is generally owing to a foulnefs of the ftomach, for which gentle vomits mud be adrainiftered, as alfo purges of rhubarb. When the patient cannot bear the lofs of blood, his feet ought . frequently to be bathed in lukewarm water, and well rubbed with a coarfe cloth. Cataplafms with muftard or horfe-radifh ought likewife to be applied to them. This courfe is peculiarly neceffary when the pain proceeds from a gouty humour affecting the head. When the head-ach is occafioned by great heat, hard labour, or violent exercife of any kind, it may be allayed by cooling me- dicines, as the faline draughts with nitre, and the like. A little of Ward’s effence, dropped into the palm of the hand, and applied to the forehead, will fometimes remove a violent head-ach ; and fp will aether, when applied in the fame manner. The Ear-Ach. This diforder is fometimes fo violent, as to occafion great yeflleffhefs, anxiety, and even delirium. It often proceeds from a fudden fuppreffion of perfpiration, or from the head being expofed to cold when covered wfth fiveat. It may alfo be occalioned by worms, or other infedls getting into the ear, or being bred there ; or from any hard body fticking in the ear. When the ear-ach proceeds from infedts, or any hard body flicking in the ear, every method muff be taken to remove them as foon as pofiible. The membranes may be relaxed by drop- ping into the ear oil of fweet almonds, or olive oil. Afterwards the patient fhould be made to fneeze, by taking fnufF, or fome Itrong flernutatory. If this fhould not force out the body, it muff be extradled by art. Infefls fometimes come out upon pouring in oil, which is a thing they cannot bear. When the pain of the ear proceeds from inflammation, it may be fomented. An exceeding good method of fomenting the ear is to apply it clofe to the mouth of a jug filled with warm wa- ter, or a ftrong decodtion of camomile-flowers. The patient’s feet fhould be frequently bathed in lukewarm water, and he ought to take fmall dofes of nitre and rhubarb, viz. a fcruple of the former, and ten grains of the latter, three times a-day. His drink may be whey, or dccodtion of barleyjThe Family Fhyfician. 407 andliquorice with figs or raifins.

This may proceed from various caufes ; as indigeftion-; wind ; the acrimony of the bile ; fharp, acrid, or poifonous fubftances taken iiito the ftomach, &c. It may likewife be occafioned by worms ; the lloppage of cuftomary evacuations; a tranflation of gouty matter to the flomach, the bowels, &c. Wc/men in the decline of life are very liable to pains of the ftomach and bowels, efpecially fuch as are afflicted with hyfteric complaints. It is likewife very common 4o hypochondriac men of a fedentary and luxurious life. In fuch perfons it often proves fo extremely obftinate as to baffle all the powers of medicine. When the pain of the ftomach is mod violent after eating, there is reafon to fufpc£l that it proceeds from fome fault either in the digeftion or the food. In this cafe the patient ought ter change his diet till he finds what kind of food agrees belt with his ftomach, and fliould continue chiefly to ufe it. If a change of diet does not remove the complaint, the patient may take a gentle vomit, and afterwards a dofe or two of rhubarb. He ought likewife to take an infufion of camomile flowers, or fome other ftomachic bitter, either in wine or water. I have often known exercife remove this complaint, efpecially failing, or a long journey on horfeback, or in a carriage. When a pain of the ftomach proceeds from flatulency, the patient is conftantly belching up wind, and feels an uneafy de- tention of the ftomach after meals. This is a moft deplorable difeafe, and is feldom thoroughly cured. In general, the pa- tient ought to avoid all windy diet, and every thing that foflrs on the ftomach, as greens, roots, &c. If a pain of the ftomach proceed from the ftoppage of cuf- tomary evacuations, bleeding will be neceflary, efpecially in fanguine and very full habits. It will likewife be of ufe to keep the body gently open by mild purgatives, as rhubarb or fenna, &c. When this difeafe affedts women, in the decline of life, after the ftoppage of the menfes, making an iftue in the leg op arm will be of peculiar fervice. The Heartburn. What is commonly called the heart-burn, is not a difeafe of that organ, but an uneafy fenfation of heat or acrimony about D d 4 tty;4° 3 The Family Phyjician. ( the pit of the ftomach, ■which is fometimes attended “with anx- iety, naufea, and vomiting. Perions who are liable to this complaint ought to avoid ftale liquors, acids, windy or greafy aliments, and fhould never ufe violent exeicife foon alter a plentiful nieal. I know many per— fons who never fail to have the heart-burn if they ride loon af- ter dinner, provided they have drank ale, wine, or any feimented liquor; but are never troubled with it when they have drank rum or brandy and water without any fugar or acid. When the heart-burn proceeds from debility of the ftomach, or indigeftion, the patient ought to take a dofe or two of rhu- barb ; afterwards he may ufe infufions of the Peruvian bark, or any other of the ftomachic bitters, in wine or brandy. Exercife in the open air will likewife be of ufe, and every thing that pro- motes digellion. When bilious humours oecafion the heart-burn, a tea-fpoonful of the fweet fpirit of nitre in a glafs of water, or a cup of tea, will generally g ve eafe. If it proceeds from the ufe of greafy aliments, a dram of brandy or rum may be taken. if acidity or fournefs of the ftomach occafions the heart-burn, abforbents are the proper medicines In this cafe an ounce of powdered chalk, half an ounce of fine fugar, and a quarter of an ounce of gum-arabic, may be mixed in an Englilh quart of wa- ter, and a tea-cupful of it taken as often as is neceflary. Such as do not chufe cha'k may take a tea-fpoonful of prepared oyfter- ihells, or of the powder called crabs-eyes, in a glafs of cinna- mon or peppermint-water. But the fafeft and belt abforbent is magaefa alba. This not only ads as an abforbent, but likewife as a purgative; whereas chalk, and other abforbents of that kind, are apt to lie in the inteftinps, and oecafion obftrudions. This pow der is not difagreeable, and may be taken in a cup of tea, or a glafs of mint-water. A large tea-fpoonful is the ufual dofe; but it may be taken in a much greater quantity when there is oecafion. Thefe things are now generally made up into lozenges for the conveniency of being carried in the pocket, and taken at p'eafure. If wind be the caufe of this complaint, the mod proper me- dicines are thofe called carminatives; as annifeeds, juniper-ber- ries, ginger, canella alba, cardamom feeds, &c. T hefe may either be chewed, or infufed in wine, brandy, or other fpirits. One of the fafeft medicines of this kind is the tindure made by -nfufing an ounce of rhubarb, and a quarter of an ounce of the rcifer cardamom feeds, in an Englilh pint of brandy. After thisTht Family Fhyfician. 409 has digefted for two or three days, it ought to be (trained, and four ounces of white fugarcandy added to it. It muft (land to digeft a fecond time till the fugar be diffolved. A table-fpoon- ful of it may be taken occafionally for a dofe. The heart-burn has often been cured, particularly in pregnant women, by chewing green tea. Floe Hiccup. This may proceed from excels in eating or drinking; from a hurt of the (tomach ; poifons; inflammations or fchirrous tu- mours of the (tomach,' inteftines, bladder, midriff, or the re(t of the vifcera. In gangrenes, acute and malignant fevers, a hiccup is often the forerunner of death. Wiien the hiccup proceeds from the ufe of aliment that is fta-^ tulent, or hard of digeftion, a draught of generous wine, or a drachm of any fpirituous liquor, will generally remove it. If poifon be the caufe, plenty of milk and oil muft be drank, as has been formerly recommended. When it proceeds from an in- flammation of the (tomach, &c. it is very dangerous. In this cafe the cooling regimen ought to be ftri£tly obferved. The patient mu(t be bled, and take frequently a few drop of the fweet fpirits of nitre in a cup of wine whey. His (tomach fhould likewife be-fomented with cloths dipped in warm water, or have bladders filled with warm milk and water applied to it. When the hiccup proceeds from a gangrene or mort fication, the Peruvian bark, with other antifeptics, are the only medi- cines which have a chance to fucceed. When it is a primary difeafe, and proceeds from a foul (tomach, loaded either with a pituitous or a bilious humour, a gentle vomit and purge, if the patient be able to bear them, will be of fervice. When the hiccup proves very obftinate, recourfe muft be had to the mod powerful aromatic and antifpafmodic medicines. The principal of thefe is mufk; fifteen or twenty grains of which may be made into a bolus, and repeated occafionally. Opiates are likewife of fervice ; but they muft be ufed with cau- tion. A bit of fugar dipped in compound fpirits of lavender, or the volatile aromatic tin&ure, may be taken frequently. Ex- ternal applications are fometimes alfo beneficial ; as the (tomach plafter, or a cataplafm of the Venice treacle of the Edinburgh or London difpenfatory, applied to the region of the (tomach. Dijlocation, vulgarly called, a Breaking of the Neck. This may happen by falls, or violent blows. In th s cafe, if the patient receives no alfiftance, he foon dies, which make* people4xo The Family Phyjician. people imagine the neck was broken: it is, however, for the molt part only partially diflocated, and may be reduced by al- snoft any perfon of resolution. A complete diflocation of the neck is inftantaneous death. When the neck is diflocated, the patient is deprived of all fenfe and motion, his countenance is bloated, and his chin lies upon his bread. To reduce this diflocation, the patient fhould immediately be laid upon his back on the ground, and the operator muft place himfelf behind him fo as to be able to lay hold of his head with both hands, while he makes a reliflance by placing his knees againft the patient’s fhoulders. In this porture he muft pull the head with force, gently twifting it at the fame time, if the face be turned to one fide, till he perceives that the joint is replaced, which may be known from the noife which the bones generally make when going in, the patient’s beginning to breathe, and the head continuing in its natural porture. This is one of thofe operations which it is more eafy to perform than deferibe. It has been happily performed even by women, and often by men of no medical education. After the neck is reduced, the patient ought to be bled, and fliould be differed to reft for foms days, till the parts recover their proper tone. Rickets. This difeafe generally attacks children between the age of nine months and two years. It prevails mold in towns where the in- habitants follow fedentary employments, negle&ing either to take proper exercife themfelves, or to give it to their children. One caufe of the rickets is difeafed parents. Mothers of a weak relaxed habit, who negleft exercife, and live upon weak watery diet. Accordingly we find, that the children of fuch wo- men generally die of the rickets, the fcrophula, eonfumptions, or fuch like difeafes. Children begotten by men in the decline of life, who are fubjeft to the gout, the gravel, or other chronic difeafes, are likewife very liable to the rickets. Any diforder that weakens the conftitution, as the fmall-pox, mealies, teething, &c. difpofes them to this difeafe. It may likewife be occafioned by improper diet, as food that is either too weak and watery. Bad nurfing is the chief caufe of this difeafe. But children fuffer oftner by want of care in nurfes than want ol food. Al- lowing an infant to lie or fit too much, or not keeping it tho- roughly clean in its clothes, has the moll pernicious effects. The want of free air is likewife very hurtful to children in tinsThe Family Thyfitian. 411 refpeft. A healthy child fliould always be in motion, unlefs when afleep ; if it be buffered to lie, or lit, inftead of being tolled and dandled about, it will not thrive. At the beginning of this difeafe the child’s flefh grows foft and flabby i its ffrength is diminilhed ; it lofes its wonted cheerful- rels, looks more grave and compofed than is natural for its age, and does not chufe to be moved. The head and belly become too iarge in proportion to the other parts; the face appears full, and tne complexion florid. Afterwards the bones begin to be af- fected, efpecially in the more foft and fpongy parts. Hence the wriffs and ancles become thicker than ufual ; the fpine or back- bone puts on an unnatural fhape ; the breaff is likewife often de- formed. As this difeafe is always attended with evident figns of weak- nefs and relaxation, our chief aim in the cure mult be to brace and ftrengthen the folids, and to promote digeftion and the due preparation of the fluids. Thefe important ends will be bell an- fwered by wholefome nourifhing diet, fuited to the age and ffrength of the patient, open dry air, and fufficient exercife. The limbs fliould be rubbed frequently with a warm hand, and the child kept as cheerful as poffible. The diet ought to be dry and nourifhing, as good bread, roafled flefh, &c. Bifcuits is generally reckoned the belt bread, and pi- geons, pullets, veal, rabbits, or mutton roafled or minced, are the molt proper flefh. If the child be too young for flefh meats, he may have rice, millet, or pearl-barley boiled with raifins, to which may be added a little wine and fpice. His drink may be good claret, mixed with an equal quantity of water. Thole who cannot afford claret, may give the child now and then a wine-glafs of mild ale, or good porter. Medicines are here of little avail. The difeafe may often be cured by the nurfe, but felaom by the phyfician. In children of a grofs habit, gentle vomits and repeated purges of rhubarb may fometimes be of ufe, but they will feldom carry off the difeafe ; ufe the cold bath, efpecially in the warm feafon. It muff how, ever be done with prudence, as fome ricketty children cannot bear ft. The belt time for ufing the cold bath is in the morn, ing, and the child fliould be well rubbed with a dry cloth imme- diately after he comes out of it. If the child fliould be weak- ened by the cold bath, it muff be difcontinued. Sometimes iffues have been found beneficial in this difeafe. They are peculiarly neceffary for children who abound with grofs humours.412. The Family Fhyjician. humours. An infufion of the Peruvian bark in wine or ale would be of great lervice. Melancholy. Melancholy is that ftate of alienation or weaknefs of mind which renders people incapable of enjoying the pleafures, or per- forming the duties of life. It is a degree of infanity, and often terminates in abfolute madnefs. It may proceed from an hereditary difpofition ; intenfe think- ing ; violent palTions or affe&ions of the mind, as love, fear, joy, grief, and fuch like ; alfo from poifons, a fedentary life, folitude,' the fupprelTion of cuftomary evacuations, acute fevers, or other difeafes. Violent anger will change melancholy into madnefs ; and exceffive cold, efpecially of the lower extremities, will force the blood into the brain, and produce all the fymp- toms of madnefs. To all which we may add gloomy or mifta- ken notions of religion. When perfons begin to be melancholy, they are timorous, watchful, fond of folitude, fretful, fickle, captious and inquifi- tive, folicitous about trifles; fometimes niggardly, and at other times prod’gal. The body is generally bound ; the urine thin, and in fmall quantity; the ftomach and bowels inflated with wind, the complexion pale, the pulfe flow and weak. The functions of the mind are alfo greatly perverted, in fo much that the patient often imagines himfelf dead, or changed into fome other animal. Some have imagined their bodies were made of glafs, or other brittle fubflances, and were afraid to move, left 4 they fhould be broken to pieces. The unhappy patient, in this cafe, unlefs carefully watched, is apt to put an endto his own miferable life. When the difeafe is owing to an obftru&ion of cuftomary evacuations, or any bodily diforder, it is eafier cured than when it proceeds from affe&ions of the mind, or an hereditary taint. A difeharge of blood from the nofe, looienefs, fcabby eruptions, the bleeding piles. Or the menjes, fometimes carry off this dif- eafe. The diet fhould confift chiefly of vegetables of a cooling and opening quality. Animal food, efpecially falted or fmoke-dried fiih or flelh, ought to be avoided. The moft proper drink is water, whey, or fmall beer. Tea and coffee are improper. If honey agrees .with the patient, it jnay be eaten freely, or his drink may be fweetened with it. In- fufions of balm-leaves, penny-royal, the roots of wild valerian, or4T3 The Family Fhyfician. or the flowers of the lime-tree, may be drank freely, either by themfelves, or fwe’etened with honey, as the patient lhall chufe. The patient ought to take as much exercife in the open air as he can bear. This promotes the perfpiration, and all the other fecretions. Every kind of madnefs is attended with a di- minidied perfpiration ; all means ought therefore to be ufed to promote that neceflary and falutary difcharge. Were he forced 'to ride or walk a certain number of miles every day, it would tend greatly to alleviate his diforder. In the cure of this difeafe particular attention mud be paid to the mind. When the patient is in a low date, bis mind ought to be foothed and diverted with a variety of amufements, as en- tertaining ftories, padimes, mufic, See. When the patient is high, evacuations are neceflary. In this cafe he mud be bled, and have his body kept open by purging medicines, as manna, rhubarb, cream of tartar, or the foluble tartar. I have feen the lad have very happy effheds. It may be taken in the dofe of half an ounce, diflblved in water-gruel, every day, for fundry weeks, or even for months, if necelfary. More or lefs may be given according as it operates. Vomits have likewife a good effedl; but they mud be pretty flrong, otherwife they will not operate. Whatever increafes the evacuation of urine or promotes per- fpiration, has a tendency to remove this difeafe. Both thefe fe- cretions may be promoted by the ufe of nitre and vinegar. JVounds. No part of medicine has been more midaken than the treat- ment or cure of wounds. Mankind in general believe that cer- tain herbs, ointments, and pladers are poflefled of wonderful healing powers, and imagine that no wound can be cured with- out the application of them. It is however a faft, that no ex- ternal application whatever contributes towards the cure of s wound, any other way than by keeping the parts foft, clean,, and defending them from the external air, which may be as ef- fedlually done by dry lint, as by the molt pompous applications, while it is exempt from many of the bad conferences attending them. The fame obfervation holds with refpedl to internal applica- tions. Thefe only promote the cure of wounds as far as they tend to prevent a fever, or to remove any caufe that might ob- drucl or impede the operations of Nature. It is Nature alone that cures wounds. I dull4!4 *fhe Family Phyfician, I {hall, however, confine myfelf to external wounds, recom- mending a fkilful furgeon for the cure of internal ones. The firft thing to be done when a perfon has received a wound, is to examine whether any foreign body be- lodged in it, as wood, (tone, iron, lead, glafs, dirt, bits of cloth, or the like. Thefe, if poffible, ought to be extracted, and the wound cleaned, before any dreflings be applied. When that cannot be affected with fafety, on account of the patient’s weaknefs, or lofs of blood, they muft be fuffered to remain in the wound, and after- \vards extracted when he is more able to bear it. If the wound be in any of the limbs, and a copious bleeding follows, it may be flopped by a bandage round the limb a little above the wound. In flight wounds, which do not penetrate much deeper than the fkin, the beft application is a bit of the common black flicking plafler. This keeps the fides of the wound together, and pre- vents the air from hurting it, which is all that is neceflary. When a wound penetrates deep, it is not fafe to keep its lips quite clofe: this keeps in the matter, and is apt to make the wound fefter. In this cafe the beft way is to fill the wound with foft lint. It muft not be fluffed in too hard, as it will do hurt. The lint may be covered with a cloth dipped in oil, and kept on by a proper bandage. The firfl drefling ought to continue on for at leaft two days ; after which it may be removed, and frefh lint applied as before. When a wound is greately inflamed, the molt proper appli- cation is a poultice of bread and milk, foftened with a little fweet oil or frefh butter. This muft be applied inftead of a plafler, and fhould be changed twice a-day. If the wound be large, and there is reafon to fear an inflam- mation, the patient fhould be kept on a very low diet. He muft abftain from flefh, ftrong liquors, and every thing that is of a heating nature. f or broken fhins, when the fkin only is fcraped off, a piece of brown paper moiftened with brandy is generally fufficient. moiften the paper every day, but do not take it off till the part is quite healed. Taking off the paper admits the air to it and re- tards the cure. Bruifes. Thefe are generally productive of worfe confequences than wounds. The danger does not appear immediately, by which means it often happens that they are ncglcCted. InThe Family T Joyful an. 415 In flight bruifes it will be fufficient to bathe the part with warm vinegar, to which a little brandy or rum may occafionally be added, and to keep cloths wet with this mixture conflantly applied to it. This is more proper than rubbing it with brandy, fpirits of wine, or other ardent fpirits, which are commonly ufed in fuch cafes. In fome parts of the country the peafants apply to a recent bruife a cataplafm of frefh cow-dung. I have often feen this cataplafm applied to violent contufions occafioned by blows, falls, bruifes, and fuch like, and never knew it fail to have a good effect. When a bruife is very violent, the patient ought immediately to be bled, and put upon a proper regimen. His food fhould be light and cool, and his drink weak, and of an opening na- ture ; as whey fvveetened with honey, decoHions of tamarinds, barley, cream-tartar-whey, and fuch like. The bruifed part muft be bathed with vinegar and water, as directed above ; and a poultice made by boiling crumb of bread, elder-flowers, and camomile-flowers, in equal quantities of vinegar and water, ap- plied to it. This poultice is peculiarly proper when a wound is joined to the bruife. It may be renewed two or three times a-day. GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS, WHICH WILL, IF FOLLOWED, INFALLIBLY PROLONG LIFE. An attention to diet is not only neceflary to the prefervation of health, but is likewife of importance in the cure of difeafes. Every intention in the cure of many difeafes, may be anfwered by diet alone. Its effects, indeed, are not always fo quick as thofe of medicine ; but they are generally more lafting. Befides, it is neither fo difagreeable to the patient, nor fo dangerous as medicine, and is always more eaflly obtained. Though moderation be the chief rule with regard to the quan- tity, yet the quality of food merits a further confideration. Ani- mal, as well as vegetable food, may be rendered unwholefome by being kept too long. All animal fubftances have a natural ten- dency to putrefaction ; and, when that has proceeded too far, they not only become offenfive to the fenfes, but hurtful to health. Animals which feed grofsly, as tame ducks, hogs, &c. are neither fo calily digelted, nor afford fuch wholefome nourifh- ment as others. No animal can be wholefome that does not take fuflicient exercife. Molt of out. (tailed cattle are crammed with416 The Family Fhyjician. ■with grofs food, but not allowed exercife nor free air ; by which means they indeed grow fat, but their humours, not being pro- perly prepared or ammilated, remain crude, and occafion indi- gefhons, grofs humours, and oppreflion of the fpirits, in thofe who feed upon them. Animals are often rendered unwholefome by being over-heated. Exceffive heat caufes a fever, exalts the animal falts, and mixes the blood fo intimately with the flefh, that it cannot be feparared. For this reafon, butchers fhould be feverelv punifhed who over- drive their cattle. No perfon would chufe to eat the flefh of an animal who had died in a high fever \ yet that is the cafe with all over-drove cattle ; and the fever is often raifed even to the degree of madnefs. But this is not the only way by which butchers render meat unwholefome. The abominable cuftom of filling the cellular membrane of animals with air, in order to make them appear fat, is every day pra&ifed. This not only fpoils the meat, and renders it unfit for keeping, but is fuch a dirty trick, that the very idea of it is fufficient to difgufl: a perfon of any delicacy at every thing which comes from the fhambles. Who can bear'the thought of eating meat which has been blown up w th air from the lungs of a dirty fellow, perhaps labouring under the very worft of difeafes. No people in the world eat fuch quantities of animal food as the Englifh, which is one reafon why they are fo generally tainted with the fcurvy, and its numerous train of confequences ; low fpirits, hypochondria'cifm, &c. Animal food was furely de- figned for man, and, w ith a proper mixture of vegetables, it will be found the mod wholefome \ but to gorge beef, mutton, pork, fifh, and fowl, twice or thrice a day, is certainly too much. All who value health ought to be contented with eating one meal of flefh in the twenty-four hours, and this ought to conlifl of one kind only. Our aliment ought neither to be too moifl: nor too dry. Moifl: aliments relax the folids, and render the body feeble. Thus we fee females, who live much on tea, and other watery diet, gene- rally become weak, and unable to digelt folid food. Hence proceed hyflerics, and all their dreadful confequences. On the other hand, food that is too dry, renders the folids in a manner rigid, and the humours vifcid, which difpofes the body to in- flammatory fevers, fcurvies, and the like. Much has been faid on the ill effe&s of tea in diet. They are, no doubt, numerous ; but they proceed rather from the im-The Family Phyfician* 4i7 prudent life of it, than from any bad qualities in the tea itfelf. Tea is now the univerfal breakfaft in this part of the world ; but the morning is furely the mod: improper time of the day fof' drinking it. Mod; delicate perfons, who, by the bye, are the greated tea-drinkers, cannot eat any thing in the morning. If fuch perfons, after falling ten or twelve hours, drink four or five cups of tea, without eating almod any bread, it mud; hurt them. Good tea, taken in moderate quantity, not too flrong, nor too hot, nor drank upon an empty Itomach, will feldom do harm ; but if it be bad, which is often the cafe, or fubdituted in the room of folid food, it mud; have many ill effe&s. The liquid part of our aliment likewile claims our attention. Water is not only the bads of mod liquors, but alfo compofes a great part of our folid food. Good water mud therefore be of the greated importance in diet. The bed water is that which is mod pure, and free from any mixture of foreign bodies. The common methods of rendering water pure by filtration, or foft by expofing it to the fun and air, &c. are fo generally known, that it is unneceffary to expend time in explaining them, I lhall only, in general, advife all to avoid waters which dag- nate long in fmall ponds, or the like, as fuch waters often be- come putrid by the corruption of animal and vegetable bodies with which they abound. Even cattle frequently differ by drink- ing, in dry feafons, water which has dood long in lmall refer- voirs, without being fupplied by fprings, or frediened with fhowers. All wells ought to be kept clean, and to have a free communication with the air. As fermented liquors, notwithdanding they have been ex- claimed againd by many writers, dill continue to be the com- mon drink of almod every perfon who can afford them, I lhall rather endeavour to affiff people in the choice of thefe liquors, than pretend to condemn what cudom has fo firmly edablilhed. It is not the moderate ufe of found fermented liquors which hurts mankind: it is excels, or ufing fuch as are ill prepared, j or vitiated. All families who can, ought to prepare their own liquors. Since preparing and vending of liquors became one of the mod general branches of budnefs, every method has been tried' to adulterate them. The great objeft, both to the makers and [venders of liquors, is to render it intoxicating. But it is welt known that this may be done by other ingredients than thofe which ought to be afed for making it drong. It would be im- prudent even to name thofe things which are daily made ufe of E e t,oThe Family Phyfician. to render liquors heady. Suffice it to fay, that the practice is very common, and that all the ingredients ufed for this purpofe are of a narcotic or ftupefadtive nature. But as all opiates are of a poifonous quality, it is eafy to fee what mull be the confe- quences of their general ufe. Though they do not kill fuddenly, yet they hurt the nerves, relax and weaken the ftomach, and fpoil the digeftion. I would recommend it to families, not only to prepare their own liquors, but likewife their bread. Bread is fo neceffiary a part of diet, that too much care cannot be bellowed in order to have it found and wbolefome. For the purpofe, it is not only neceflary that it be made of good grain, but likewife properly prepared, and kept free from all unwholefome ingredients. This, however, we have reafon to believe, is not always the cafe with bread prepared by thofe who make a trade of vending it. Their objedt is rather to pleafe the eye, than confult the health. Perfons whofe folids are weak and relaxed, ought to avoid all vifeid food, or fuch things as are hard of digeltion. Their diet, however, ought to be nourilhing; and tlpey fhould take plenty of exercife in the open air. Such as abound with blood, Ihould be fparing in the ufe of every thing that is highly nourilhing, as fat meat, rich wines, ftrong ale, and the like. Their food Ihould confilt mollly of bread and other vegetable fubllantives ; and their drink ought to be water, whey, or final! beer. Fat people Ihould not eat freely of oily, nourilhing diet. They ought frequently to eat radilh, garlic, fpices, or fuch things as are heating, and promote perfpiration and. urine. Their drink fhould be water, coffee, tea, or the like ; and they ought to take much exercife and little deep. Thofe who are too lean mull follow an oppoftte courfe. Such as are troubled with acidities, or whofe food is apt to four upon the ftomach, fhould live much on flefh meats; and thofe who are afflidted with hot, alkaline erudlations, ought to- ufe a diet confiding chiefly of acid vegetables. People who are affedted with the gout, low fpirits, hypo- chondriac, or hyfteric diforders, ought to avoid all flatulent food, every thing that is vifeid or hard of digeftion, all falted or fmoke- dried provilions, and whatever is auftere, acid, or apt to four on the ftomach. Their food Ihould be light, fpare, cool, and of an opening nature. It is not only neceffary for health that out diet be wholefome, butthe Family Phyfician. 419 but alfo that it be taken at regular periods. Some imagine long fading will atone for excefs ; but this, indead of mending the matter, generally makes it worfe. When the domach and in- tedines are over didended with food, they lofe their proper tone, and, by long fading, they become weak, and indated with wind. Thus either gluttony or fading dedroys the powers of digedion. The frequent repetition of aliment is not only neceflary for repairing the continual wade of our bodies, but likewife to keep the humours found and fweet. Our humours, even in the mod healthy date, have a condant tendency to putrefadlion, which can only be prevented by frequent fupplies of frefh nourifhment. When that is wanting too long, the putrefa&ion often proceeds fo far as to occadon very dangerous fevers. From hence we may learn the necedity of regular meals. No perfon can enjoy a good date of health, whofe veifels are either frequently over- charged, or the humours long deprived of frefh fupplies of chyle. Long fading is extremely hurtful to young people; it not only vitiates their humours, but prevents their growth. Nor is it lefs injurious to the aged. Mod perfons, in the decline of life, are affli&ed with wind. This complaint is not only in- creafed, but even rendered dangerous, and often fatal, by long fading. Old people, when their domachs are empty, are fre- quently feized with giddinefs, head-achs, and faintnefs. Thefe complaints may generally be removed by a bit of bread and a glafsof wine, or fading any other folid food, which plainly points out the method of preventing them. It is a very common pra&ice to eat a light breakfad and a heavy fupper. This cudom ought to be reverfed. When people fup late, their fupper fhouldbe very light, but the breakfad ought always to be folid. If any one eats a light fupper, goes foon to bed, and rifes betimes in the morning, he will be fure to find an appetite for his breakfad, and he may freely indulge it. The drong and healthy do not indeed differ fo much from fading, as the weak and delicate ; but they run great hazard from its oppofite, viz. repletion. Many difeafes, efpecially fe- vers, are the effedl of a plethora, or too great fulnefs of the vef- fels. Strong people, in high health, have generally a great quan- tity of blood and other humours. When thefe are fuddenly in- creafed, by an overcharge of rich and nourifhing diet, the veffels become too much didended, and obdrudlions and inflammations E e a enfue.The Family Phyfician. 420 enfue. Hence fo many people are feized with inflammatory and eruptive fevers, after a fealt or debauch. All great and fudden changes in diet arc dangerous. What the ftomach has been long accuflomed to digeft, although lefs wholefome, will agree better with it than food of a more falu- tary nature which it has not been ufed to. When therefore a change becomes neceflary, it ought always to be made gradually; a fudden tranfition from a poor and low, to a rich and luxurious diet, or the contrary, might fo difturb the fun&ions of the body, as to endanger health, or even to occafion death itfelf. When 1 recommend regularity of diet, I would not be un- derftood as condemning every fmall deviation from it. It is next to impoflible for people at all times to avoid fome degree of ex- cefs; and living too much by rule might make even the fmalleft deviation dangerous. It may therefore be prudent to vary a little, fometimes taking more, fometimes lefs, than the ufual quantity of meat and drink, provided always that regard be had to moderation. Lemery. Arbuthnot.

It eafcs pain, allays tickling coughs, relieves difficult breathing, and is ufeful in many diforders of children, particularly the hooping cough. I he dofe to an adult is from fifty to an hundred drops. 5 POWDERS.The Family Phyjician. POWDERS. Worm Powders. Take of tin reduced into a fine powder, an ounce ; yEthiop’s mineral, two drachms. Mix them well together, and divide the. whole into fix dofes] One of thefe powders may be taken in a little fyrup, honey, or treacle, twice a day. After they have been all ufed, the fol- lowing anthelmintic purge may be proper. Purging Worm Powder. Take of powdered rhubarb, a fcruple ; fcammony and calo- mel, of each five grains. Rub them together in a mortar for one dofe. For children, the above dofes muff be lelfened according to their age- If the powder of tin be given alone, its dofe may be confide- rably increafed. The late Dr. Allton gave it to the amount of two ounces in three days, and fays, when thus adminiftered, that it proved an egregious anthelmintic. He purged his patients both before they took the powder and afterwards. Pozuder for the Tape Worm. Early in the morning the patient is to take, in any liquid, two or three drachms, according to his age and conftitution, of the root of male fern reduced into a fine powder. About two hours afterwards, he is to take of calomel and refin of fcammony, each ten grains ; gum gamboge, fix grains. Thefe ingredients mult be finely powdered and given in a little fyrup, honey, treacle, or any thing that is molt agreeable to the patient. He is then to walk gently about, now and then drinking a difh £f weak green tea till the worm is palfed. If the-powder of the fern produces naufea, or ficknefs, it may be removed by fucking the juice of an orange or lemon. This medicine, which had been long kept a fecrct abroad, for the cure of the tape-worm, was fome time ago purchafed by the French king, and made public for the benefit of mankind. Not having had an opportunity of trying it, I can fay nothing from experience concerning its efficacy. It feems, however, from its ingredients, to be an a£live medicine, and ought to be taken with care. The dofe here preferibed is fulficicnt for the ftrongeff patient; it mult, therefore, be reduced according to the age and conftitution. AJlringtnl427 the Family Phyfician. AJlringent Powder. Take of alum and Japan earth, each two drachms. Pound them together, and divide the whole into ten or twelve dofes.

Take extrail of gentian, two drachms ; powdered rhubarb and vitriolated tartar, of each one drachm; oil of mint, thirty- drops ; Ample fyrup, a fufficient quantity. Three or four of thefe pills may be taken twice a day, for in- vigorating the ftomach, and keeping the body gently open. Compofmg Pill. Take of purified opium, ten grains; Caftile foap, half a drachm. Beat them together, and form the whole into twenty pills. When a quieting draught will not fit upon the flomach, one, two, or three of thefe pills may be taken, as oceafion requires. Pill for the Jaundice. Take of Caftile foap, fuccotorine aloes, and rhubarb, of each one drachm. Make them into pills with a fufficient quantity of fyrup or mucilage. Thefe pills, as their title exprefies, are chiefly intended for the jaundice, which, with the afliftance of proper diet, they will of- ten cure. Five or fix of them may be taken twice a day, more or lefs, as is neceflaiy to keep the body open, It will be proper, however, during their ufe, to. interpofe now and then a vomit of ipecacuanha or tartar emetic.

Put them together into a glazed earthen pipkin, and let them boil, or rather flmmer, for an hour, or an hour and a quarter, taking care to ftir them all the while with a wooden fpa- tula. After the whole has flood to fettle, pour off" the liquor which is upon the top into bottles for ufe. With this extradf Goulard makes his vcgeto-mineral water, ■which he recommends in a great variety of external diforders, as inflammations, burns, bruifes, fprains, ulcers, &c. Liniment for Burns. Take equal parts of Florence oil, or of frefli drawn linfeed oil, and lime-water; {hake them well together in a wide- mouthed bottle, fo as to form a liniment. This is found to be an exceeding proper application for recent __ fcalds or burns. It may either be fpread upon a cloth, or the parts affedted may be anointed with it twice or thrice a day.

Anthelmintic Wine. Take of rhubarb, half an ounce ; worm-feed, an ounce. Bruife them, and infufe without heat in two pints of red port wine for a few days ; then (train off the wine. As the ftomachs of perfons afflicted with worms are always debilitated, red wine alone will often prove ferviceable: it muff, however, have Hill better effects when joined with bitter and pur- gative ingredients. A glafs of this wine may be taken twice or thrice a day. Antimonial Wine. Take glafs of antimony, reduced to a fine powder, half an ounce; Lifbon wine, eight ounces. Digeft, without heat, for three or four days, now and then fhaking the bottle; afterwards filter the wine through paper. The dofe of this wine varies according to the intention. As an alterative and diaphoretic, it may be taken from ten to fifty or fixty drops. In a larger dofe it generally proves cathartic, or excites vomiting. Bitter Wine. Take of gentian root, yellow rind of lemon-peel, frefh, each one ounce; long pepper, two drachms; mountain wine, two pints. Infufe without heat for a week, and ftrain out the wine for ufe. In complaints arifing from weaknefs of the ftomach, or indi- geftion, a glafs of this wine may be taken an hour before dinner and fupper. INFUSIONS. The author of the New Difpenfato’ry obferves, that even from thofe vegetables which are weak in virtue, rich infufions may be obtained, by returning the liquor upon frelh quantities of the fubjedt.43° The Family Rhyjician. fubjedt, the water loading itfelf more and more with the active parts ; and that thefe loaded infulions are applicable to valuable purpofes in medicine, as they contain in a fmall compafs the finer, more fubtile, and adtive principles of vegetables, in a form readily mifcible with the fluids of the human body. Bitter Infujion. Take tops of the lefler centaury and camomile flowers, of each half an ounce ; yellow rind of lemon and orange-peel, carefully freed from the inner white part, of each two drachms. Cut them in fmall pieces, and infufe them in a quart of boiling water. For indigeftion, weaknefs of the ftomach, or want of appetite, a tea-cupful of this infufton may be taken twice or thrice a day, Infufion of the Bark. To an ounce of the bark, in powder, add four or five table- fpoonfuls of brandy, and a pint of boiling water. Let them in- fufe for two or three days. This is one of the beft preparations of the bark for weak flo- machs. In diforders where the corroborating virtues of that me- dicine are required, a tea-cupful of it may be taken two or three times a day. Infufion for the Balfy. Take of horfe-radilh root fhaved, muflard-feed bruifed, each four ounces ; outer rind of orange-peel, one ounce. Infufe them in two quarts of boiling water, in a clofe veflel, for twenty-four hours. In paralytic complaints, a tea-cupful of this warm ftimulating medicine may be taken three or four times a day. It excites the adtion of the folids, proves diuretic, and, if the patient be kept warm, promotes perfpiration. If two or three ounces of the dried leaves of marfh-trefoil be ufed inflead of the milliard, it will make the antijcorbutic vfuficn« Conferve of Red Rofes. Take a pound of red rofe buds, cleared of their heels; beat them well in a mortar, and, adding by degrees two pounds of double-refined fugar, in powder, make a conferve. After the fame manner are prepared the conferves of orange- peel, rofemary flowers, fea-wormw'ood, of the leaves of wood- forrel, &c. The conferve of rofes is one of the moll agreeable and ufeful preparations belonging to this clafs. A drachm or two ot it, diflolved in warm milk, is ordered to be given as a gentle re- flringent i431 The Family Phyjician. ftringent in weaknefs of the ftomach, and likewife in phthifical coughs, and fpitting of blood. To have any confiderable effedls, however, it mult be taken in larger quantities. Conferve of Sloes. This may be made by boiling the lloes gently in water, be- ing careful to take thefn out before they burlt; afterwards ex- prelling the juice, and beating it up with three times its weight of fine fijgar. In relaxations of the uvula and glands of the throat, this makes an excellent gargle, and may be ufed at difcretion. Preferves are made by fteeping or boiling frefh vegetables firfl in water, and afterwards in fyrup, or a folution of fugar. The fubjedl is either preferved moift in the fyrup, or taken out and dried, that the fugar may candy upon it. The laid is the moll ufual method. I The following is a mbfi excellent Remedy for a Cold. I know not one that is fo efficacious. Take a large tea-cupful of linfeed, two penny worth of flick-, liquorice, and a quarter of a pound of fun raifins. Put thefe into two quarts of foft water, and let it fimmer over a flow fire till it is reduced to one; then add to it a quarter of a pound of brown fugar-candy pounded, a table-fpoonful of old rum, and a table-fpoonful of the bell white wine vinegar, or lemon juice. Note. The rum and vinegar are befl to be added only to the quantity you are going immediately to take ; for, if it is put into the whole, it is apt in a little time to grow flat. Drink half a pint at going to bed, and take a little when the cough is troublefome. This receipt generally cures the worfl of colds in two or three days, and, if taken in time, may be faid to be almofl an infallible remedy. It is a moft fovereign and balfamic cordial for the lungs, without the opening qualities which endanger frefh colds in going out. It has been known to cure colds that have been almofl: fettled into confumptions in lefs than three weeks. DECOCTIONS. Decoflion of Logwood. ■ Boil three ounces of the fhavings, or chips, of logwood, in four pints of water, till one half the liquor is wafted. Two or three43 ^ Sthe Family Fhyficlan. three ounces of fimple cinnamon-water may be added to this de- coction. In fluxes of the belly, where the ftronger aftringenls are im- proper, a tea-cupful of this decodtion may be taken with advan- tage three or four times a-day. DecoBion of the Bark. Boil an ounce of the Peruvian bark, grofsly powdered, in a pint and an half of water to one pint; then ftrain the decodtion. If a tea-fpoonful of'the weak fpirit of vitriol be added to this medicine, it will render it both more agreeable and efficacious. Compound DecoBion of the Bark. Take of Peruvian’ bark and Virginian fnake-root, grofsly powdered, each three drachms. Boil them in a pint of water to one half. To the (trained liquor add an ounce and an half of aromatic water. Sir John Pringle recommends this as a proper medicine to- wards the decline of malignant fevers, when the pulfe is low, the voice weak, and the head affedted with a ftupor but with little delirium. The dofe is four fpoonfuls every fourth or fixth hour. PLASTERS. Plaftcrs ought to be of a different confiftence, according to the purpofes for which they are intended. Such as are to be ap- plied to the breads and ftomach, ought to be foft and yielding; while thofe defigned for the limbs, fhould be firm and adhefive. Stomach Plajler. Take of gum plaffer, half a pound; camphorated oil, an ounce and an half; black pepper, or capficum, where it can be had, one ounce. Melt the plaffer, and mix with it the oil; then fprinkle in the pepper, previoufly reduced to a fine powder. An ounce or two of this plaffer, fpread upon foft leather, and applied to the region of the ftomach, will be of fervice in flatu- lencies arifing from hyfteric and hypochondriac affedlions. A little of the expreffed oil of mace, or a fiwv drops of the eflential oil of mint, may be rubbed upon it before it is applied. , Adhejive Plajler.

Melt the wax, and while it is warm, add to it the turpentine, taking care not to evaporate it by too much, heat. After the turpentine and wax are fufficiently incorpo- rated, fprinkle in the powders, continually ftirring the mafs till it be cold. Though this plafter is made in a variety of ways, one feldom meets with it of a proper confiftence. When compounded with oils and other greafy fubftances, its effedfs are blunted, and it is apt to run; while pitch and refin render it too hard and very in- convenient. When the bliftering plafter is not at hand, its place may be fupplied by mixing with any foft ointment a fufficient quantity of powdered flies ; or by forming them into a pafte with flour and vinegar.. Gum Blajler. Take of the common plafter, four pounds ; gum ammoniac and galbanum, drained, of each half a pound. Melt them to- gether, and add, of Venice turpentine, fix ounces. This plafter is ufed as a digeftive, and likewife for difeufling indolent tumours. ' / > _ Method of dejlroying the putrid Smell which Meat acquires during hot Weather. Put the meat intended for making foup into a fauce-pan full of water, feum it when it boils, and then throw into the fauce-pan a burning coal, very compadl and deftitute of fmoke ; leave it there for two minutes, and it will have con- tracted all the fmell of the meat and foup. If you wifti to roaft a piece of meat on the fpit, or to bake it, put it into water till it boils, and, after having feummed it, throw in a burning coal as before ; at the end of two minutes, take out the meat, and, living wiped it well, put it on the fpit, ©r into the oven.

CORNS AND TEETH. A Remedy for Corns on the Feet. Roaft a clove of garlic, or an onion, on a live coal, or in hot allies \ apply it to the corn, and fallen it on with a piece of cloth. This foftens the corn to fuch a degree, as to loofen and wholly remove it in two or three days. Foment the corn every other night in warm water, after which renew the application. The fame intention will be yet more elFetftually anfwered by applying to the corn a bit of the plafter of Diachylon with the gums, fpread on a finall piece of linen ; removing it occafionally to foment the corn with warm water, and pare olf the foftened part with a penknife.

Put into an alembic a.pound and an half of belli picked rofe- mary flowers ; pennyroyal and marjoram flowers, of each half a pound ; three quarts of good Coniac brandy ; having clofe Hop- ped the mouth of the alembic to prevent the fpirit from evapo- rating, bury it twenty-eight hours in horfe-dung to digeft, and then diftil off the fpirit in a water-bath. A drachm of Hungary-water diluted with fpring-water, may be taken once or twice a week in the morning falling. It is alfo ufed by way of embrocation to bathe the face and limbs, or any part affl£ted with pains or debility. This remedy recruits the llrength, difpels gloominefs, and ftrengthens the light. It mult always he ufed cold, whether taken inwardly as a medicine, or applied externally. To make Rofe-Water. To make an excellent rofe-water, let the flowers be gathered two or three hours after fun-rifing in very fine weather ; beat them in a marble mortar into a palle, and leave them in the mortar foaking in their juice, for five or fix hours ; then put the mafs into a coarfe canvas bag, and prefs out the juice ; to every quart of which add a pound of frelli damafle rofes, and let them Hand in inkifion tor twenty-four hours. Then put the whole into a glafs alembic, lute on a head and receiver, and place it on a fand heat. Diftil at firlt with a gentle fire, which is to be increafed gradually till the drops follow each other as quick as poflible; draw off the water as long as it continues to run clear, then put out the fire, and let the alembic Hand till cold. The difhlled water at firfl will have very little fragrancy, but after be- ing expofed to the heat of the fun about eight days, in a bottle lightly flopped with -a bit of paper, it acquires an admirable feent. Rofe-water is an excellent lotion for the eyes, if ufed every morning, and makes a part in collyriums preferibed for inflam- F f 243 ^ The Family Phyjician. mations of thefe parts; it is alfo proper in many other com- plaints. Directions for making Lavender Heater. Fill a glafs or earthen body two thirds full of lavender flowers, and then fill up the veflel with brandy or melafles fpirits. Let the flowers ftand in infuflon eight days, or lefs if ftraitened for time ; then diftil off the fpirit, in a water-bath with a brifk fire, at firft in large drops or even a fmall ftream, that the eflential oil of the flowers may rife with the fpirit. But as this cannot be done without the phlegm coming over the helm at the fame time, the fpirit muff be rectified. The firft diftillation being finifhed, un- lute the ftill, throw away what remains in the body, and fill it with frefh flowers of lavender, in the proportion of two pounds of lavender flowers to one pint of fpirit ; pour the fpirit already diftilled according to the foregoing diredlions, on the lavender flowers, and diftil a fecond time in a vapor bath. To make Orange-flower Water. Having gathered (two hours before fun-rife in fine weather) a quantity of orange-flowers, pluck them leaf by leaf, and throw away the ftalks and ftems : fill a tin cucurbit two thirds full of thefe picked flowers; lute on a low bolt-head, not above two inches higher than the cucurbit; place it in balneo mariae, or a water- bath, and diftil with a ftrong fire. You run no rifk from preffing forward the diftillation with violence, the water-bath effeddually preventing the flowers from being burnt. In this method you pay no regard to the quantity, but the quality of the water drawn off. If nine pounds of orange flowers were put into the ftill, be fatisfied with three or four quarts of fragrant water; however, you may continue your diftillation, and fave even the laft droppings of the ftill, which have fome fmall fragrancy. During the operation, be careful to change the water in the re- frigeratory veflel as often as it becomes hot. Its being kept cool prevents the diftilled water from having an empyreumatic or burnt fmell, and keeps the quin’teflence of the flowers more Intimately united with its phlegm. . Virgin's Milk, a fafe and excellent Cofmetic, Take equal parts of gum benjamin and ftorax, diflolve them in a fufficient quantity of fpirit of wine. The fpirit will then become a reddifti tinfture, and exhale a very fragrant fmell. Some people add a little balm of gilead. Drop a few drops into £ glafs of clear water, and the water, by ftirring, will inftantly become milky. This may be ufed with fafety and fucccfs: it Vvill clear the complexion, for which purpofe nothing is better.437 The Family Fhyfician. To take Iren Mould out of Linen. Hold the iron mould over the fume of boiling water for fome time, then pour on the fpot a little juice of forrel and a little (alt, and when the cloth has thoroughly imbibed the juice, wa(h it in lye.

Take the yolks of fix eggs, half a table-fpoonful of bruifed fait, and a pound of Venetian foap ; mix the whole together with the juice of beet-roots, and form it into round balls, that are to be dried in the fhade. The method of uftng this foap is to wet with fair water the ftained part of the cloth, and rub both fides of it well with this foap; then wadi thp cloth in water, and the (lain will not long appear. To curs Warts. Anoint the warts with the milky juice of the herb mercury feverai times, and they will gradually wafte away. Another jafe and experienced method. Rub the warts with a pared pippin, and a few days afterwards they will be found to difappear. To defray Fleas. Sprinkle the room wifli a decoction of arfmart, bitter apple, briar leaves, or cabbage leaves; or fmoke it with burnt thyme or penny-royal. Another way. Put tanfey-leaves about different parts of the bed, viz. under the matrafs, or between the blankets. Another way. Rub the bed-pofts well with a (trong deco&ion of elder leaves.

Objervations upon a Leech, by a Gentleman who kept one Jcvcral Years for the purpofe of a IVeather-glafs. A phial of water, containing a leech, I kept on the frame of my lower chamber window fafh, fo that when I looked in the morning, I could know what would be the weather of the following dav. If the weather proves ferene and beautiful, the leech lies motionlefs at the bottom'of the glafs, and rolled together in a fpiral form. If it rains before or after noon, it is found crept up to the top of its lodging, and there it remains till the weather is fettled. Tf we are to have wind, the poor prifoner gallops through its limpid habitation with amazing fwiftnefs, and feldont refts till it begins to blow hard. If a remarkable ftorrn of thunder and rain is to fucceed, for fome days before it lodges almofl continually without the water, and difeovers uncommon tineafinefs, in violent throes, and convulfive-like motions. In the froft, as in clear Yummer weather, it lies_ conftantly at the bottom. And in fnow, as in rainy weather, it pitches its dwelling upon the very mouth of the phial. What reafons may be afligned for them, I mud leave philofophers to determine, though one thing is evident to every body, that it muff be affefted in the fame way with that of the mercury and fpirits in the weather-glafs, and has doubtlefs a very furprifing fenfation, that the change of weather, even days before, makes a vifible altera- tion upon its manner of living. Perhaps it may pot be amifs to note, left any of the curious fhovild try the experiment, that the leech was kept in a common eight ounce phial glafs, about three-fourths filled with water, and covered on the mouth with a bit of linen-rag. In the l’ummer the water is changed once a week, and in the winter once a fortnight. This is a weather- glafs whic h may be pOrchafed at a very trifling expence, and which .will laft dome years.The Family Phyjtcian. 439 ROYAL HUMANE SOCIETY. Directions for the recovery of the Apparently Dead. T. The reiteration of heat is of the greateft confequence to the re- turn of life: when, therefore, the body is taken out of the water, the cloaths Ihould be dripped oil i or, it naked at the time ol the accident* it mull: be covered with two or three coats, or a blanket. 1 he body fhould then be carefully conveyed to the neared houle, with the head a little railed.—In cold and damp weather, the perlon fhould be laid on a bed. See. in a room that is moderately heated:—I-ti fuminer, on a bed expofed to the fays ol the fun, and not more than fix pei ions ad- mitted, as a greater number may relat'd the return of life. The body is to be well dried with warm cloths, and gently rubbed with flannels fprinkled with rum, brandy, gin, or mallard.—Fomentations of fpjrits may be applied to the pit of the Itomach with advantage.—A warming- pan covered with flannel Ihould be lightly moved up and down the back; bladders, or bottles filled with hot water, heated bricks, or tiles-wrapped up in flannel, ihould be applied to the foies of the feet, palms of the hands, and other parts of the body. II. Relpiration will be promoted by doling the mouth and one nof- tril, while, with the pipe of a bellows, you blow into the other with fufficient force to inflate the lungs ; another perfon ihould then prefs the cheft gently with his hands, fo as to expel the air. If the pipe be too large for the noltrils, the air may be blown in at the mouth, blow- ing the breath can only be recommended w hen bellows cannot be pro- cured. III. The bowels fhould be inflated with the fumes of tobacco, and repeated three or four times within the firit hour; but, if circumltances prevent the ufe of this vapour, then clyltersof this herb, or other acrid infulions with fait, may be thrown up with advantage. The fumigat- ing machine is fo much improved as to be of the higheft importance to the public; and if employed in every inllance of apparent death, it w'ould reftore the lives of many of our fellow creatures, as it now an- fwers the important purpofes of fumigation, inspiration, and expiration. IV. Agitation has proved a powerful auxiliary to the other means of recovery; one or more of the afliftants Ihould, therefore, take hold of the legs and arms, particularly of boys, and lhake their bodies for five or fix minutes; this may be repeated feveral times within the firit hour. When the body is wiped perfectly dry, it fhould be placed in bed between two healthy perfons, and the friction chiefly directed, in this cafe, to the left fide, where it will be molt likely to excite the mo- tion of the heart. V. When thefe methods have been employed for an hour, if any brewhoufe, bakehoufe, or glafshoufe, be near, where warm grains, allies, lees, &c. can be procured, the body Ihould be placed iiEany of thefe moderated to a degree of heat very little exceeding that of the perlon in health. If the warm bath can be conveniently obtained, it maybe adv-antageouliy ufed in conjunction with the earlieft modes of treatment. . VI. Electricity fhould be early employed, as it will- increafe the be- neficial efteCts of the .other means of recovery on the lyltem. “ The “ electrical fhock," fays Mr. Kite, in his Eflay on the Recovery of the apparently Dead, “ is to be admitted as the teit or diferimmatino- “ charaCteriftic of any remains of animal life; and fo long as that pro- duces44° 'The Family Fhyficlan. “ duces contractions, may the perfon be faid to be in a recoverable “ (hue; but when that effeCl has ceafed, there can no doubt remain of {he party being abiolutely and politively dead.” If convulfions, or other figns of returning life appear, a tea- fpoonful or two of warm water may be put into the mouth; and if the power of (wallowing be returned, a little warm wine, or brandy and water may be given. When this gradual approach towards recovery is obferved, and breathing returned, let the perfon be put into a warm bed, and if difpoled to fleep, as is generally the cafe, give no didurb- ance, and he will awake almod perfectly recovered. The above methods are to be ufed with vigor for three or four hours; for it is a vulgar and dangerous opinion to fuppofe perfons are irreco- verable, becaufe life does not foon make its appearance; an opinion that has configned an immenfe number to the grave, who might have been reftored to life by refolution and perfeverance. Bleeding diould never be employed in fuch cafes, unlefs by the di- rection of one of the medical aililtants, or fome other refpeCtable gen- tleman of the faculty, who has paid attention to tlie fubjeCt of fuf- pended animation. On the firlt alarm of any perfon being drowned, let hot water, flour of muftard, warm blankets, hot flannels, flat bottles filled with hot water, a heated warming-pan, bellows, brandy, hartfhorn drops, and an electrifying machine, be procured. Thefe articles being immedi- ately employed, may be productive of reftoring many ufeful and valu- able lives. The common people will often reftore life by purfuing the plans now recommended; but if gentlemen of the faculty can be obtained, their afliftance fhould be immediately requefted, as their (kill will lead them judicioufly to vary the methods of treatment, and, in a variety of acci- dents, many more lives will be reftored to the community and to their families. The above means of redoration have proved efficacious in apparent fudden death, by convulfions, fuft'ocations, intoxication, hanging, in- tenfe cold, and the tremendous ftroke of lightning.—When perfons are froft bitten, they fhould be rubbed witli fnow, previous to their being brought into a warm room. In fuffocation, occafioned by the fumes of fulplntr, charcoal, &c. dafhing the face and bread with cold water has been known to rcflore life. *** Publicans and others, who have been deterred from receiving the apparently dead into their houfes, or giving immediate afliftance, under an apprehenfion of legal punifhment or penalties, are now in- formed, that the Committee have obtained the following opinion of an eminent Special Pleader:—“ It is a mifdemeanour by the common “ law, and an indictable offence, to prevent the Coroner from doing “ his duty, or to obdruCthim in the execution of it. But the med- “ dling with a body apparently dead, for the purpofe of preferving life, “ is not a uanfgreflion of the law in either of thefe refpefts; nor do I “ know any ftatutc by which fuch an aCt is prohibited.”—All perfons who immediately admit the drowned, or otherwife fuffocated, and af- ford aflidance in the various indances of apparent death, will be in- demnified by the Managers of this lnftitution; and are informed that the charges of burial, in unfuccefsful cafes, will be paid by the Royal Humane Society. 5 INDEX.r 44* ) INDEX.

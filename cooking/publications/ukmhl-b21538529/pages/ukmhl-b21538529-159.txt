U5 CHEESE. milk, and these added fats merely envelop the broken fragments of this. Hence my suspicion that the cheese leaving the above-described insoluble residuum was a sample of ‘ bosch ’ cheese. Since the above was written I have met with the following in the Times, bringing the subject up to latest date, and I take the liberty of reprinting the larger part of this interesting and clearly-written communica- tion : ‘IMITATED DAIRY PRODUCTS. ‘ The profitable utilisation of refuse products has always been one of the most difficult problems which have confronted manufacturers. Until recently the dis- posal of skim-milk was one of the difficulties of the managers of butter factories, or “creameries ” as they are termed in the United States. Similarly, the sale of the internal fat of animals slaughtered for food, with the exception of lard, was practically restricted to the manu- facturers of soap and candles. It was reserved to a Frenchman, M. Mege-Mauries, to discover the first step towards a more profitable use of these substances. He showed that by a judicious combination of milk and the clarified fat of animals a substance could be produced which closely resembled butter. So close, indeed, is the resemblance of imitation butter to the real article that the skill of the chemist must be invoked to render detec- tion positive, if the artificial butter is good of its kind. So recondite, indeed, is the test of the chemist that it depends upon the percentage of volatile oils in butter-fat and in caul-fat respectively. ‘Artificial butter is the result of several processes. The internal fat of cattle is first chopped into small pieces, and then passed through a huge and somewhat L

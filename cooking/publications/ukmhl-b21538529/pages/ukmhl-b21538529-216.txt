THE CHEMISTRY OF COOKERY, 20? The practical importance of the fermentation is strikingly shown by the fact that, in the course of sponge rising, dough rising, and baking, a loaf becomes about four times as large as the original mixture of flour, water, &c., of which it was made ; or, otherwise stated, an ordinary loaf is made up of one part of solid bread to more than three parts of air bubbles or pores. French rolls and some other kinds of fancy bread are still more gaseous. So far I have only named the flour, water, salt, and yeast. These, with a little sugar or milk, added accord- ing to taste and custom, are the ingredients of home- made bread, but ‘ bakers’ bread ’ is commonly, though not necessarily, somewhat more complex. There is the material technically known as ‘ fruit,’ and another which bears the equivocal name of ‘ stuff,’ or ‘ rocky.’ The fruit are potatoes. The quantity of these prescribed in Knight’s ‘Guide to Trade’ is one peck to the sack of flour. This proportion is so small (about 3 per cent, by weight) that, if not exceeded, it cannot be regarded as a fraudulent adulteration, for the additional cost involved in the boiling, skinning, and general preparing of the small addition exceeds the saving in the price of raw material. The fruit, therefore, is not added merely because it is cheaper than flour, as many people suppose. The instructions concerning its use given in the work above named clearly indicate that the potato flour is used to assist fermentation. These instructions prescribe that the peck of potatoes shall be boiled in their skins, mashed in the ‘ seasoning tub,’ then mixed with two or three quarts of water, the same quantity of patent yeast, and three or four pounds of flour. The mixture is left to stand for six or twelve hours, when it will have become what is called a ferment. After straining through a sieve, to separate

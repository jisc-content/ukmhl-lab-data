He concluded that a red herring has the highest specific sapidity—i.e. the greatest amount of flavour in a given weight of any kind of food he had tested, and that, comparing it on the basis cf cost for cost, its superiority is still greater. He tells us that ‘ the pleasure of eating depends very much indeed upon the manner in which the food is applied to the organs of taste,’ and that he considers ‘ it necessary to mention, and even to illustrate in the clearest manner, every circumstance which appears to have influence in producing these important effects.’ As an example of this, I may quote his instructions for eating hasty pudding: ‘ The pudding is then eaten with a spoon, each spoonful of it being dipped into the sauce before it is carried to the mouth, care being had in taking it up to begin on the outside, or near the brim cf the plate, and to approach the centre by regular advances, in order not to demolish too soon the excavation which

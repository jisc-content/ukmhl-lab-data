GL UTEN—BREAD. 205 cease to incur the expense of buying packets of ‘ stuff’ or ‘ rocky,’ or any other bleaching abomination. Liebig asserts that in certain cases the use of lime- water improves the quality of bread. Tomlinson says that ‘in the time of bad harvests, when the wheat is damaged, the flour may be considerably improved, with- out any injurious result whatever, by the addition of from 20 to 40 grains of carbonate of magnesia to every pound of flour.’ It is also stated that chalk has been used for the same purpose. These would all act in nearly the same manner by neutralising any acid, such as acetic, that might already exist or be generated in the course of fermentation. When gluten is kept in a moist state, it slowly loses its soft, elastic, and insoluble condition ; if kept in water for a few days, it gradually runs down into a turbid, slimy solution, which does not form dough when mixed with starch. The gluten of imperfectly-ripened wheat, or of flour or wheat that has been badly kept in the midst of humid surroundings, appears to have fallen partially into this condition, the gluten being an actively hygroscopic substance. Liebig’s experiments show that flour in which the gluten has undergone this partial change may have its original qualities restored by mixing 100 parts of flour with 26 or 27 parts of saturated lime-water and a suffi- ciency of ordinary water to work it into dough. I suspect that the action of the alum is of a similar kind, though this does not satisfactorily account for the bleaching. The action of sulphate of copper, which has been used in Belgium and other places for improving the appearance and sponginess ot loaves, is still more mys- terious than that of alum. Kuhlmann found that a single

20 THE CHEMISTRY OF COOKERY. white' Within the white of the egg is the yolk, chiefly composed of albumen, but with some other consti- tuents added—notably a peculiar oil. At present I will only consider the changes which cookery effects on the main constituent of the egg, merely adding that this same albumen is one of the most important, if not the one most important, material of animal food, and is represented by a corresponding nutritious constituent in vegetables. We all know that when an egg has been immersed during a few minutes in boiling water, the colourless, slimy liquid is converted into the white solid to which it owes its name. This coagulation of albumen is one of the most decided and best understood changes effected by cookery, and therefore demands especial study. Place some fresh, raw white of egg in a test-tube or other suitable glass vessel, and in the midst of it im- merse the bulb of a thermometer. (Cylindrical ther- mometers, with the degrees marked on the glass stem, are made for such laboratory purposes.) Place the tube containing the albumen in a vessel of water, and gra- dually heat this. When the albumen attains a tempera- ture of about 134° Fahr., white fibres will begin to appear within it ; these will increase until about i6o° is at- tained, when the whole mass will become white and nearly opaque.* It is now coagulated, and may be called solid. Now examine some of the result, and you will find that the albumen thus only just coagulated is a tender, delicate, jelly-like substance, having every ‘ Tarchnoff has recently discovered the curious fact that the white of the eggs of birds that are hatched without feathers remains transparent when coagulated, while the eggs which produce chickens and other birds already fledged become opaque when coagulated. This is familiarly illus- trated by the difference between plovers’ eggs and hens’ eggs when cooked.

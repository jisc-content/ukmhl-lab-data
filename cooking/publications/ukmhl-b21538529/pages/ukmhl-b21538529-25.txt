THE BOILING OF WATER. 13 Reflecting on this subject, I have been struck with a curious fact that has hitherto escaped notice, viz. that in the country which over all others combines a very large population with a very small allowance of cleanli- ness, the ordinary drink of the people is boiled water, flavoured by an infusion of leaves. These people, the Chinese, seem in fact to have been the inventors of boiled-water beverages. Judging from travellers’ ac- counts of the state of the rivers, rivulets, and general drainage and irrigation arrangements of China, its population could scarcely have reached its present density if Chinamen were drinkers of raw instead of cooked water. This is especially remarkable in the case of such places as Canton, where large numbers are living afloat on the mouths of sewage-laden rivers or estuaries. The ordinary everyday domestic beverage is a weak infusion of tea, made in a large teapot, kept in a padded basket to retain the heat. The whole family is supplied from this reservoir. The very poorest drink plain hot water, or water tinged by infusing the spent tea-leaves rejected by their richer neighbours. Next to the boiling of water for its own sake, comes the boiling of water as a medium for the cooking of other things. Here, at the outset, I have to correct an error of language which, as too often happens, leads by continual suggestion to false ideas. When we speak of ‘ boiled beef,’ ‘ boiled mutton,’ ‘ boiled eggs,’ ‘ boiled potatoes,’ we talk nonsense; we are not merely using an elliptical expression, as when we say, ‘the kettle boils,’ which we all understand to mean the contents of the kettle, but we are expounding a false theory of what has happened to the beef, &c.—as false as though we should describe the material of the kettle that has

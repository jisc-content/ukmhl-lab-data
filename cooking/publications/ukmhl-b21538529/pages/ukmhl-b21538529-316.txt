THE CHEMISTRY OF COOKERY. 302 On economical grounds, however, the difference is enormous. If all Englishmen were vegetarians and fish- eaters, the whole aspect of the country would be changed. It would be a land of gardens and orchards, instead of gradually reverting to prairie grazing-ground as at present. The unemployed miserables of our great towns, the inhabitants of our union workhouses, and all our rogues and vagabonds, would find ample and suitable employment in agriculture. Every acre of land would require three or four times as much labour as at present, and feed five or six times as many people. No sentimental exaggeration is demanded for the recommendation of such a reform as this. feedingâ€”which in this country means more flesh food. In the ten years from 1850 to i860, the deaths from cancer had increased by 2,000; from i860 to 1870 the increase was 2,400 ; from 1870 to 1880 it reached 3,200, above the preceding ten years. The proportion of deaths is far higher among the well-to-do classes than among the poorer classes. It seems to be the one disease that increases with improved general sanitary conditions. The evidence is not yet complete, but as far as it goes it points most ominously to a direct connection between cancer and excessive flesh feeding among people of sedentary habits. The most abundant victims appear to be women who eat much meat and take but little out-of-door exercise.

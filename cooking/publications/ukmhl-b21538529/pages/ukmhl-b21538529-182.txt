THE CHEMISTRY OF COOKERY. i68 could not possibly sell it, and his reputation would be injured by admitting that he kept it ; but that the same people who would be disgusted with it at <^d, will buy it freely at double the price as prime Devonshire fresh butter; and, he added, significantly, ‘ I cannot afford to lose my business and be ruined because my customers are fools.’ To pastrycooks and others in business it is sold honestly enough for what it is, and used instead of butter. In the ‘Journal of the Chemical Society’ for January 1844, page 92, is an account of experiments made by A. Mayer in order to determine the comparative nutritive value of ‘ bosch ’ and cream-butter. They were made on a man and a boy. The result was that on an average a little above per cent, less of the ‘ bosch ’ was absorbed into the system than of the cream-butter. This is a very trifling difference. Before leaving the subject of animal food I may say a few words on the latest, and perhaps the greatest, triumph of science in reference to food supply—i.e. the successful solution of the great problem of preserving fresh meat for an almost indefinite length of time. It has long been known that meat which is frozen remains fresh. The Aberdeen whalers were in the habit of feasting their friends on returning home on joints that were taken out fresh from Aberdeen, and kept frozen during a long Arctic voyage. In Norway game is shot at the end of autumn, and kept in a frozen state for consumption during the whole winter and far into the spring. The early attempts to apply the freezing process for the carriage of fresh meat from South America and Australia by using ice, or freezing mixtures of ice and salt, failed, but now all the difficulties are overcome by a

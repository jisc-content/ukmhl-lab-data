VEGETABLE CASEIN AND VEGETABLE JUICES. 213 the fourth, those of Rochleder ; all as quoted by Leh- mann. Here it will be seen that the differences upon which Dumas and Cahours base their supposed refuta- tion of the identity of the animal with the vegetable principle are much smaller than the differences between the results of different analyses of the latter. These differences I suspect are all due to the difficulty of isolating the substances in question, especially of the vegetable substance, which is so intimately mixed with the starch, &c., in its natural condition that complete separation is of questionable possibility. The difficulty (or impossibility) of driving off all the adhering water, without removing the combined elements of water, is a further source of discrepancy. This will be understood by the following description of the method of separation as given by Miller (‘ Ele- ments of Chemistry,’ vol. iii.). ' Legumin is usually ex- tracted from peas or from almonds, by digesting the pulp of the crushed seeds in warm water for two or three hours. The undissolved portion is strained off by means of linen, and the turbid liquid allowed to deposit the starch which it holds in suspension ; it is then filtered and mixed with dilute acetic acid. A white flocculent precipitate is thus formed, which must be collected on a filter and washed.’ This is but a mechanical process, and its liability to variation in result may be learned by anybody who will repeat it, or who has separated the gluten of flour by similar treatment. Practically regarded in relation to our present subject, casein and legumin may be considered as the same. Their nutritive values are equal, and exceptionally high, sup- posing they can be digested and assimilated. One is the most difficult of digestion of the nitrogenous consti-

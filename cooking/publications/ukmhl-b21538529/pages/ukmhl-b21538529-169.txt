155 CHEESE. I add by way of postscript a recipe for a dish lately invented by my wife. It is vegetable marrow ait gratin, prepared by simply boiling the vegetable as usual, slicing it, placing the slices in a dish, covering them with grated cheese, and then browning slightly in an oven or before the fire, as in preparing the well-known ‘ cauli- flower au grating I have modified this (with improve- ment, I believe) by mashing the boiled marrow and stirring the grated cheese into the midst of it whilst as hot as possible ; or, better still, by adding a little of the solution of cheese above described to the puree of mashed marrow and stirring it well in while hot. To please the ladies, and make it look pretty on the table, a little more grated cheese may be sprinkled on the top of this and browned in the oven or with a salamander. People with weak digestive powers should set aside the pretty. Turnips may be similarly treated as ‘ mashed turnips au gratini I recommend this especially to my vege- tarian friends, who have no objection to cheese, but do not properly appreciate it. Taking as I do great interest in their efforts, regard- ing them as pioneers of a great and certainly approach- ing reform, I have frequently dined at their restaurants (always do so when within reach, as I am only a flesh- eater for convenience’ sake), and by the experience thus afforded of their cookery, am convinced that they are losing many converts by the lack of cheese in many of their most important dishes. noxious pedantry that too commonly prevails in such treatises) in Dr. Andrew Combe’s Physiology of Digestion, which, although written by a dying man nearly half a century ago, still remains, like his Principles of Physiology, the best popular work on the subject. Subsequent editions have been edited and brought up to date by his nephew, Sir James Coxe.

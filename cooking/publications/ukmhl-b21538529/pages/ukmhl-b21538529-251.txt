RUMFORD'S COOKERY AND CHEAP DINNERS. 237 equally convinced of its necessity, though, as above ex- plained, not on the same theoretical grounds. No repe- tition of his experience is fair unless this be attended to. I have no hesitation in affirming that the 4| oz. of No. i, when thus boiled for 3 hours, will supply more nutri- ment than 6 oz. boiled only hour. The bread should not be cooked, but added just before serving the soup. In reference to this he has published a very curious essay, entitled ‘ Of the Pleasure of Eating, and of the Means that may be Employed for Increasing it.’ Rumford used wood as fuel, and his kitchen-ranges were constructed of brickwork with a separate fire for each pot, the pot being set in in the brickwork imme- diately above the fireplace in such manner that the flame and heated products of combustion surrounded the pot on their way to the exit flue. The quantity of fuel was adjusted to each operation, and with wood embers a long sustained moderate heat was easily obtained. With coal-fires such separate firing would be trouble- some, as coal cannot be so easily kindled on requirement as wood. With our roaring, wasteful kitchen furnaces and still more wasteful cooks, the long-sustained mode- rate heat is not practicable without some further device. I found that, by using a ‘ milk scalder,’ which is a water- bath similar to a glue-pot, but on a large scale, I could obtain Rumford’s results over a common kitchen-range with very little trouble, and no risk of baking the bottom part of the porridge. I further found that even a longer period of stewing than he prescribes is desirable. I made a hearty meal on No. i soup, and found it as satisfactory as any dinner of meat, potatoes, &c., of any number of courses; and, as a chemist, I assert

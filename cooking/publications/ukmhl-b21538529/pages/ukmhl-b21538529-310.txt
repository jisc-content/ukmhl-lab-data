296 THE CHEMISTRY OF COOKERY. of their forefathers; but they all seem to draw a line somewhere, none desiring to go as far back as to their inter-glacial troglodytic ancestors, and, therefore, I need not discuss the desirability of restoring their dietary. All human beings became cooks as soon as they learned how to make a fire, and have all continued to be cooks ever since. We should, therefore, look at this vegetarian question from the point of view of prepared food, which excludes nearly all comparison with the food of the brute crea- tion. I say ‘ nearly all,’ because there is one case in which all the animals that approach the nearest to our- selves—the mammalia—are provided naturally with a specially prepared food, viz. the mother’s milk. The composition of this preparation appears to me to throw more light than anything else upon this vegetarian con- troversy, and yet it seems to have been entirely over- looked. The milk prepared for the young of the different animals in the laboratory or kitchen of Nature is surely adapted to their structure as regards natural food re- quirements. Without assuming that the human dietetic requirements are identical with either of the other mammals, we may learn something concerning our ap- proximation to one class or another by comparing the composition of human milk with that of the animals in question. I find ready to hand in Dr. Miller’s ‘Chemistry,’ vol. iii., a comparative statement of the mean of several analyses of the milk of woman, cow, goat, ass, sheep, and bitch. The latter is a moderately carnivorous animal, nearly approaching the omnivorous character commonly ascribed to man. The following is the statement;

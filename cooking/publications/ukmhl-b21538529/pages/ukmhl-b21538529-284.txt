270 THE CHEMISTRY OF COOKERY, of cooking. When Pasteur’s method is properly con- ducted the only changes effected are those which would be otherwise produced by age. I have heard of many fail- ures made by English wine-merchants in their attempts at Pasteuring, and am not at all surprised, seeing how secretly and clumsily these attempts have been made. The changes thus produced are somewhat obscure. One effect is probably that which more decidedly occurs in the maturing of whisky and other spirits distilled from grain, viz. the reduction of the proportion of amylic alcohol or fusel oil, which, although less abund- antly produced in the fermentation of grape juice than in grain or potato spirit, is formed in varying quantities. Caproic alcohol and caprylic alcohol are also produced by the fermentation of grape juice or the ‘marc’ of grapes—i.e. the mixture of the whole juice and the skins. These are acrid, ill-flavoured spirits, more con- ducive to headache than the ethylic alcohol, which is proper spirit of good wine. Every wine-drinker knows that the amount of headache obtainable from a given quantity of wine, or a given outlay of cash, varies with the sample, and this variation appears to be due to these supplementary alcohols or ethers. Another change appears to be the formation of ethers having choice flavours and bouquets ; cenanthic ether, or the ether of wine, is the most important of these, and it is probably formed by the action of the natural acid salts of the wine upon its alcohol. John- ston says : ‘ So powerful is the odour of this substance, however, that few wines contain more than one forty- thousandth part of their bulk of it. Yet it is always present, can always be recognised by its smell, and is one of the general characteristics of all grape wines.’ This ether is stated to be the basis of Hungarian wine

THE COOKERY OF WINE. 273 acidulated water, or wine, the addition of alcohol throws some of it down in solid form, and this makes the solu- tion sick or turbid. When pure water or acidulated water is used, as in the above-described experiment, crystals of the salt are freely formed, and fall down readily ; but with a complex liquid like wine, containing saccharine and mucilaginous matter, the precipitation takes place very slowly ; the particles are excessively minute, become entangled with the mucilage, &c., and thus remain suspended for a long time, maintaining the turbidity accordingly. Now, this bitartrate of potash is the characteristic natural salt of the grape, and its unfermented juice is saturated with it. As fermentation proceeds, and the sugar of the grape-juice is converted into alcohol, the capacity of the juice for holding the salt in solution diminishes, and it is gradually thrown down. But it does not fall alone. It carries with it some of the colouring and extractive matter of the grape-juice. This precipitate, in its crude state called argol, or roher Wein- stein^ is the source from which we obtain the tartaric acid of commerce, the cream of tartar, and other salts of tartaric acid. Now let us suppose that we have a natural, unsophis- ticated wine. It is evident that it is saturated with the tartrate, since only so much argol was thrown down during fermentation as it was unable to retain. It is further evident that if such a wine has not been ex- haustively fermented, i.e. if it still contains some of the original grape-sugar, and if any further fermentation of this sugar takes place, the capacity of the mixture for holding the tartrate in solution becomes diminished, and a further precipitation must occur. This precipitation will come down very slowly, will consist not merely of T

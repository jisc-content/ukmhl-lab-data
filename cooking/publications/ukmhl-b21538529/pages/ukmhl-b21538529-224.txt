THE CHEMISTRY OF COOKERY. 210 expansion occurs by the conversion of liquid water into aqueous vapour, every grain of water thus converted expanding to 1,700 times its former bulk. As this hap- pens throughout, i.e. upon the surface of every one of the countless fibres or particles, there must be a general elbowing in the crowd, breaking up the recent adhesion between these fibres and thrusting them all apart in the directions of least resistance ; i,e. towards the open spaces of the larger and visible pores, producing that apparent diminution of porosity that I have observed as the easily visible characteristic of the change. This explanation may be further demonstrated by cutting a loaf through the middle from top to bottom, and exposing the cut surfaces. In this case the bread becomes unequally stale, more so near the cut surface than within. The unequal pull due to the greater approxima- tion and adhesion of the fibres and small particles causes a rupture of the exposed surface of the crumb, which becomes cracked or fissured without any perceptible alteration of the size of the visible pores. If the two broken faces be now accurately placed together, the halves thus closely joined, firmly tied, and placed for an hour in the oven, it will be seen on separating them that the chasms are considerably closed, though not quite healed. Careful examination of the structure of the inside, by breaking out a portion of the crumb, will reveal that loosening which I have described. ‘ Popped corn ’ is a peculiar example of starch cookery. Here a certain degree of porosity is given to an originally close-compacted structure of starch by the simple operation of explosive violence due to the sudden conversion into vapour of the water naturally associated with the starch. The operation is too rapid for the production of much dextrin.

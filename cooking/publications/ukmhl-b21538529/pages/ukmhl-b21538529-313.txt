299 THE VEGETARIAN QUESTION. Here, then, in 100 parts of the material of Rumford’s halfpenny dinner, as compared with the ‘ mixed diet,’ we have 40 per cent, more of nitrogenous food, more than six and a half times as much carbo-hydrate in the form of starch, more than double the quantity of sugar, about 17 per cent, more of fat, and only a little less of salts (supplied by the salt which Rumford added). Thus the ‘ mixed diet ’ falls short in all the costly constituents, and only excels by its abundance of very cheap water. This analysis supplies the explanation of what has puzzled many inquirers, and encouraged some sneerers at this work of the great scientific philanthropist, viz. that he allowed less than five ounces of solids for each man’s dinner. He did so and found it sufficient, because he was supplying far more nutritious material than beef and potatoes ; his five ounces was more satisfactory than a pound of beef and potatoes, three-fourths of which is water, for which water John Bull blindly pays a shilling or more per pound when he buys his prime steak. Rumford added the water at pump cost, and, by long boiling, caused some of it to unite with the solid ma- terials (by the hydration I have described), and then served the combination in the form of porridge, raising each portion to iqf ounces. I might multiply such examples to prove the fallacy of the prevailing notions concerning the nutritive value of the ‘ mixed diet,’ a fallacy which is merely an inherited epidemic, a baseless physical superstition. I will, however, just add one more example for com- parison—viz. the Highlander’s porridge. The following is the composition of oatmeal —also from Pavy’s table : Water . . .15-00 Sugar . . , .5*40 Albumen . , . 12-60 Fat . . . .5-60 Starch , , .58-401 Salts . , . . 3’0O

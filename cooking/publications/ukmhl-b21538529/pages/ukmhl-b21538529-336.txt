THE CHEMISTRY OF COOKERY. 3^2 According to the new theory, the best possible food for the first class is fat, butter being superior to lean beef in the proportion of 14,421 to 2,829 (Smith), and beef fat having nearly eight times the value of lean beef Ten grains of rice give 7,454 foot-pounds of work- ing-power, while the same quantity of lean beef gives only 2,829 i according to which i lb. of rice should supply as much support to hard workers as 2\ lbs. of beef-steak. None of the modern theorists dare to be consistent when dealing with such direct practical applications. I might quote a multitude of other palpable incon- sistencies of the theory, which is so slippery that it cannot be firmly grasped. Thus, Dr. Pavy (page 403), immediately after describing bacon fat as ‘ the most effi- cient kind of force-producing material,’ and stating that ‘ the no7i-7iitrogenous alimentary principles appear to possess a higher dietetic value than the nitrogenous^ tells us that ‘ the performance of work may be looked upon as necessitating a proportionate supply of mtj'ogenous alimentary matter,’ and his reason for this admission being that such nitrogenous material is required for the nutrition of the muscles themselves. A pretty tissue of inconsistencies is thus supplied ! Non-nitrogenous food is the best force producer—it cor- responds to the fuel of the steam-engine ; the nitrogenous is necessary only to repair the machine. Nevertheless, when force production is specially demanded, the food required is not the force-producer, but the special builder of muscles, the which muscles, according to theory, are not used up and renewed in doing the work. It must be remembered that the whole of this modern theoretical fabric is built upon the experiments which are supposed to show that there is no more elimination of nitrogenous matter during hard work than during

3i6 the chemistry OF COOKERY, excretions from the skin and from the lungs were not- examined. It is just these which are greatly increased by exer- cise, and their normal quantity is very large, especially those from the skin, which are threefold, viz. the insensible perspiration, which is transpired by the skin as invisible vapour ; the sweat, which is liquid, and the solid particles of exuded cuticle. Lavoisier and Seguin long ago made very laborious experiments upon themselves in order to determine the amount of the insensible perspiration. Seguin enclosed himself in a bag of glazed taffeta, which was tied over him with no other opening than a hole corresponding to his mouth ; the edges of this hole were glued to his lips with a mixture of turpentine and pitch. He carefully weighed himself and the bag before and after his enclo- sure therein. His own loss of weight being partly from the lungs and partly from the skin, the amount gained by the bag represented the quantity of the latter ; the difference between this and the loss of his own weight gave the amount exhaled from the lungs. He thus found that the largest quantity of insensible exhalation from the lungs and skin together amounted to 31 oz. per hour, or at the rate of lbs. per day. The smallest quantity was i lb. 14 oz., and the mean was 3 lbs. 11 oz. Three-fourths of this was cutaneous. These figures only show the quantity of insensible perspiration during repose. Valentin found that his hourly loss by cutaneous exhalation while sitting amounted to 32*8 grammes, or rather less than i^ oz. On taking exercise, with an empty stomach, in the sun, the hourly loss increased to 89*3 grammes, or nearly three times as much. After a meal followed by violent exercise, with the temperature of the air at 72Â° R, it

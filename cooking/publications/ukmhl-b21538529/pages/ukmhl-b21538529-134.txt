120 THE CHEMISTRY OF COOKERY. that the stewing may be performed in earthenware or even glass vessels, seeing that they are not directly ex- posed to the fire. Other forms of such double vessels are obtainable at the best ironmongers. I have lately seen a very neat apparatus of this kind, called ‘ Dolby’s Extractor,’ made by Messrs. Griffiths & Browett of Birmingham. This consists of an earthenware vessel that rests on a ledge, and thus hangs in an outer tin- plate vessel ; but, instead of water, there is an air space surrounding the earthenware pot. A top screws over this, and the whole stands in an ordinary saucepan of water. The heat is thus very slowly and steadily com- municated through an air-bath, and it makes excellent beef-tea. At temperatures below the boilmgpoint evaporation proceeds superficially, and the rate of evaporation at a given temperature is proportionate to the surface ex- posed, irrespective of the total quantity of water ; there- fore, the shallower the inner vessel of the bain-marie^ and the greater its upper outspread, the lower will be the temperature of its liquid contents when its sides and bottom are heated by boiling water. The water in a basin-shaped inner vessel will have a lower temperature than that in a vessel of similar depth, with upright sides, and exposing an equal water surface. A good water- bath for stewing may be extemporised by using a com- mon pudding-basin (I mean one with projecting rim, as used for tying down the pudding-cloth), and selecting a saucepan just big enough for this to drop into, and rest upon its rim. Put the meat, &c., to be stewed into the basin, pour hot water over them, and hot water into the saucepan, so that the basin shall be in a water-bath; then let this outer water simmer—very gently, so as not

THE CHEMISTRY OF COOKERY 176 ligneous tissue. The beaver is an example of this. The whole of its stomach, and more especially that secondary stomach the ccecum^ is often found crammed or plugged with fragments of wood and bark. I have opened the crops of several Norwegian ptarmigans, and found them filled with no other food than the needles of pines, upon which they evidently feed during the winter. The birds, when cooked, were scarcely eatable on account of the strong resinous flavour of their flesh. If my theory of the constitution of such woody tissues is correct, these animals only require the power of secreting some solvent for the resin, on the removal of which their food would consist of the same material as the tissue of the succulent stems and leaves eaten by ordinary herbivorous animals. The resinous flavour of the flesh of the ptarmigan indicates such solution of resin. I may here, by the way, correct the commonly ac- cepted version of a popular story. We are told that when Marie Antoinette was informed of a famine in the neighbourhood of the Tyrol, and of the starving of some of the peasants there, she replied, ‘ I would rather eat pie-crust’ (some of the story-tellers say ‘pastry’) ‘ than starve.’ Thereupon the courtiers giggled at the ignorance of the pampered princess, who could suppose that starving peasants had such an alternative food as pastry. The ignorance, however, was all on the side of the courtiers and those who repeat the story in its ordinary form. The princess was the only person in the Court who really understood the habits of the peasants of the particular district in question. They cook their meat, chiefly young veal, by rolling it in a kind of dough made of sawdust mixed with as little coarse flour as will hold it together; then place this in an oven or in wood embers until the dough is hardened

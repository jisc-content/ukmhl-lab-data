The same is the case as regards the fat. The quantity in the carcass of oxen, calves, sheep, lambs, and pigs varies, according to Dr. Edward Smith, from 16 per cent, to 3T3 per cent, in moderately fatted animals; while in whole-milk cheeses it varies from 21'68 per cent, to 32'3i per cent, coming down in skim-milk cheeses as low as 6*3. Dr. Smith includes Neufchatel cheese, containing i8'74per cent, among the whole-milk cheeses. He does not seem to be aware that the cheese made up between straws and sold under that name is a ricotta^ or crude curd of skim-milk cheese. Its just value is about threepence per pound. In Italy, where it forms the basis of some delicious dishes (such as budino

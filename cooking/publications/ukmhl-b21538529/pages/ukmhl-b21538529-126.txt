II2 THE CHEMISTRY OF COOKERY. completely without cooking the meat at all, merely by mincing it and then placing it in cold water. Maceration is the proper name for this treatment. The philosophy of this is interesting, and so little understood in the kitchen that I must explain its rudi- ments. If two liquids capable of mixing together, but of different densities, be placed in the same vessel, the denser at the bottom, they will mix together in defiance of gravitation, the heavy liquid rising and spreading itself throughout the lighter, and the lighter descending and diffusing itself through the heavier. Thus, concentrated sulphuric acid (oil of vitriol) which has nearly double the density of water, may be placed under water by pouring water in a tall glass jar, and then carefully pouring the acid down a funnel with a long tube, the bottom end of which touches the bottom of the jar. At first the heavy liquid pushes up the lighter, and its upper surface may be distinctly seen with that of the lighter resting upon it. This is better shown if the water be coloured by a blue tincture of litmus, which is reddened by the acid. A red stratum indicates the boundaries of the two liquids. Gradually the reddening proceeds upwards and downwards, the whole of the water changes from blue to red, and the acid becomes tinged. Graham worked for many years upon the determina- tion of the laws of this diffusion, and the rates at which different liquids diffused into each other. His method was to fill small jars of uniform size and shape (about 4 oz. capacity) with the saline or other dense solution, place upon the ground mouth of the jar a plate-glass cover, then immerse it, when filled, in a cylindrical glass vessel containing about 20 oz. of distilled water.

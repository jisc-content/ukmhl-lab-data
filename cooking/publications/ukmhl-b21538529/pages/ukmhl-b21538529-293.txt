Simply that the substitution of a mineral acid —the sulphuric for a vegetable acid (the tartaric)— supplies him with a precipitant of lithic acid in his own body; that is, provides him with the source of gout, rheumatism, gravel, stone, &c., with which English wine- drinkers are proverbially tortured. I am the more urgent in propounding this view of the subject, because I see plainly that not only the patients, but too commonly their medical advisers, do not understand it. When I was in the midst of these experiments I called upon a clerical neighbour, and found him in his study with his foot on a pillow, and groaning with gout. A decanter of pale, choice, very dry sherry was on the table. He poured out a glass for me and another for himself I tasted it, and then per- petrated the unheard-of rudeness of denouncing the wine for which my host had paid so high a price. He knew a little chemistry, and I accordingly went home forth- with, brought back some chloride of barium, added it to his choice sherry, and showed him a precipitate which made him shudder. He drank no more dry sherry, and has had no serious relapse of gout. In this case his medical adviser prohibited port and advised dry sherry. The following from ‘ The Brewer, Distiller, and Wine Manufacturer,’ by John Gardner (Churchill’s ‘Techno- logical Handbooks,’ 1883), supports my view of the position of the wine-maker and wine-merchant. ‘ Dupre and Thudicum have shown by experiment that this practice of plastering, as it is called, also reduces the yield of the liquid, as a considerable part of the wine mechanically combines with the gypsum and is lost.’ When an adulteration—justly so-called—is practised, the object is to enable the perpetrator to obtain an

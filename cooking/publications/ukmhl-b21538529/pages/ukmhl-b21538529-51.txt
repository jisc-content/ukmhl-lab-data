GELATIN, FIBRIN, AND THE JUICES OF MEAT 39 gelatin-soup is defective. 5. That to render gelatin- soup equal in nutritive and digestible qualities to that prepared from meat alone, it is sufficient to mix one- fourth of meat-soup with three-fourths of gelatin-soup ; and that, in fact, no difference is perceptible between soup thus prepared and that made solely from meat. 6. That in preparing soup in this way, the great advan- tage remains, that while the soup itself is equally nourishing with meat-soup, three-fourths of the meat which would be requisite for the latter by the common process of making soup are saved and made useful in another way—as by roasting, &c. 7. That jellies ought always to be associated with some other principles to render them both nutritive and digestible.’ ^ The reader may make a very simple experiment on himself by preparing first a pure gelatin-soup from isinglass, or the prepared gelatin commonly sold, and trying to make a meal of this with bread alone. Its insipidity will be evident with the first spoonful. If he perseveres, it will become not merely insipid, but posi- tively repulsive ; and, should he struggle through one meal and then another, without any other food between, he will find it, in the course of time (varying with con- stitution and previous alimentation), positively nauseous. Let him now add to it some of Liebig’s ‘ Extract of Meat,’ and he will at once perceive the difference. Here the natural appetite foreshadows the result of continuing the experiment, and points the way to correcting the errors of the Academicians and Baron Liebig. The jellies that we take at evening parties, or the jujubes used as sweetmeats, are flavoured with something posi- tive. I have tasted ‘ Blue-Ribbon ’ jellies that were wretchedly insipid. This was not merely owing to the * Londe, Nouvea7ix Elements THygiene, 2nd edition, vol. ii. p. 73.

STRIVING. 13 cover being very carefully removed, diffusion was allowed to proceed for a given time, and then by analysis the amount of transfer into the distilled water was determined. I must resist the temptation to expound the very in- teresting results of these researches, merely stating that they prove this diffusion to be no mere accidental mixing, but an action that proceeds with a regularity reducible to simple mathematical laws. One curious fact I may mention—viz. that on comparing the solutions of a number of different salts, those which crystallise in the same forms have similar rates of diffusion. The law that bears the most directly upon cookery is that ‘ the quantity of any substance diffused from a solution of uniform strength increases as the temperature rises.’ The application of this will be seen presently. It may be supposed that if the jar used in Graham’s diffusion experiments were tied over with a mechanically air-tight and water-tight membrane, the brine or other saline solution thus confined in the jar could not diffuse itself into the pure water above and around it; people who are satisfied with anything that ‘ stands to reason ’ would be quite sure that a bladder which resists the passage of water, even when the water is pressed up to the bursting-point, cannot be permeable to a most gentle and spontaneous flow of the same water. The true philosopher, however, never trusts to any reasoning, not even mathematical demonstration, until its conclusions are verified by observations and experiment. In this case all rational preconceptions or mathematical calcula- tions based upon the amount of attractive force exerted between the particles of the different liquids are outraged by the facts. If a stout, well-tied bladder that would burst rather I

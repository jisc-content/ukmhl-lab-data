With a moderate effort of attention, any unlearned but intelligent reader of either sex may understand all the contents of these chapters ; and I venture to antici- pate that scientific chemists may find in them some suggestive matter. If these expectations are justified by results, this preliminary essay will fulfil its double object. It will diffuse a knowledge of what is at present knowable of ‘ The Chemistry of Cookery ’ among those who greatly need it, and will contribute to the extension of such knowledge by opening a wide and very promising field of scientific research. I should add that the work is based on a series of papers that appeared in ‘ Knowledge ’ during the years 1883 and 1884. W. MATTIEU WILLIAMS. Stonebridge Park, London, N.W. March 1885.

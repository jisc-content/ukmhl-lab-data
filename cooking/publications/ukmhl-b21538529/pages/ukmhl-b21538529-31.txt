19 CHAPTER III. ALBUMEN. In order to illustrate some of the changes which take place in the cooking of animal food, I will first take the simple case of cooking an egg by means of hot water. These changes are in this case easily visible and very j simple, although the egg itself contains all the materials I of a complete animal. Bones, muscles, viscera, brain, I nerves, and feathers of the chicken—all are produced ‘ from the egg, nothing being added, and little or nothing taken away. I should, however, add that in eating an egg we do not get quite so much of it as the chicken does. Liebig found by analysis that in the white and the yolk there is a deficiency of mineral matter for supplying the bones of ; the chick, and that this deficiency is supplied by some of the shell being dissolved by the phosphoric acid which is formed inside the egg by the combination of the oxygen of the air (which passes through the shell) with the phosphorus contained in the soft matter of the egg. By comparing the shell of a hen’s egg after the chicken is hatched from it with that of a freshly-laid egg, the difference of thickness may be easily seen. When we open a raw egg, we find enveloped in a stoutish membrane a quantity of glairy, slimy, viscous, colourless fluid, which, as everybody now knows, is called albumen^ a Latin translation of its common name, ^the C 2

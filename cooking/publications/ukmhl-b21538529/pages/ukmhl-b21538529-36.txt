24 THE CHEMISTRY OR COOKERY. In my experiment there was time for a practically uniform diffusion of the heat throughout. I shall describe hereafter what is called the ‘ Nor- wegian ’ cooking apparatus, wherein fowls, &c., are cooked as the eggs were in my hat-case. Albumen exists in flesh as one of its juices, rather than in a definitely-organised condition. It is dis- tributed between the fibres of the lean {i.e. the muscles), and it lubricates the tissues generally, besides being an important constituent of the blood itself—of that portion of the blood which remains liquid when the blood is dead—i.e. the serum. As blood is not an ordinary article of food, excepting in the form of ‘ black puddings,’ its albumen need not be here considered, nor the debated question of whether its albumen is identical with the albumen of the flesh. Existing thus in a liquid state in our ordinary flesh meats, it is liable to be wasted in the course of cookery, especially if the cook has only received the customary technical education and remains in technological ignor- ance. To illustrate this, let us suppose that a leg of mutton, a slice of cod, or a piece of salmon is to be cooked in water, ‘ boiled,’ as the cook says. Keeping in mind the results of the previously-described experiments on the egg-albumen, and also the fact that in its liquid state albumen is diffusible in water, the reader may now stand as scientific umpire in answering the question whether the fish or the flesh should be put in hot water at once, or in cold water, and be gradually heated. The‘big- endians ’ and the ‘ little-endians ’ of Liliput were not more definitely divided than are certain cookery autho- rities on this question in reference to fish. Referring at

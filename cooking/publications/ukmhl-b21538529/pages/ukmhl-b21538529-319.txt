305 MALTED FOOD. mill, and the means of doing this is offered by the diastase of malt. In accordance with this reasoning I have made some experiments on a variety of our common vegetable foods, by simply raising them—in contact with water— to the temperature most favourable to the converting action of diastase (140° to 150° Fahrenheit), and then adding a little malt extract or malt flour. This extract may be purchased ready made, or pre- pared by soaking crushed or ground malt in warm water, leaving it for an hour or two or longer, and then pressing out the liquid. I find that oatmeal-porridge when thus treated is thinned by the conversion of the bulk of its insoluble starch into soluble dextrin ; that boiled rice is similarly thinned ; that a stiff jelly of arrowroot is at once rendered watery, and its conversion into dextrin is demonstrated by its altered action when a solution of iodine is added to it. It no longer becomes suddenly of a deep blue colour as when it was starch. Sago and tapioca are similarly changed, but not so completely as arrowroot. This is evidently because they contain a little nitrogenous matter and cellulose, which, when stirred, give a milkiness to the otherwise clear and limpid solution of dextrin. Pease-pudding when thus treated behaves very in- structively. Instead of remaining as a fairly uniform paste, it partially separates into paste and clear liquid, the paste being the cellulose and vegetable casein, the liquid a solution of the dextrin or converted starch. Mashed turnips, carrots, potatoes, &c., behave simi- larly, the general results showing that so far as starch is concerned there is no practical difficulty in obtaining a X

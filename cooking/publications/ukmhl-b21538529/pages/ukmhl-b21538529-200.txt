i86 THE CHEMISTRY OF COOKERY. dextrin to sugar, if the action is continued. The most favourable temperature for this is 140° Fahr. The action ceases if the temperature be raised to the boiling point. The starch which we take so abundantly as food appears to have no more food-value to us than to the vegetable germ until the conversion into dextrin or sugar is effected. From what I have already stated concerning the action of heat upon starch, it is evident that this conversion is more or less effected in some processes of cookery. In the baking of bread an incipient conversion probably occurs throughout the loaf, while in the crust it is carried so far as to completely change most of the starch into dextrin, and some into sugar. Those of us who can remember our bread-and-milk may not have forgotten the gummy character of the crust when soaked. This may be felt by simply moistening a piece of crust in hot water and rubbing it between the fingers. A certain degree of sweetness may also be detected, though disguised by the bitterness of the caramel, which is also there. The final conversion of starch food into dextrin and sugar is effected in the course of digestion, especially, as already stated, in the first stage—that of insalivatioa Saliva contains a kind of diastase, which has received the name of salivary diastase and nmcin. It does not appear to be exactly the same substance as vegetable diastase, though its action is similar. It is most abun- dantly secreted by herbivorous animals, especially by ruminating animals. Its comparative deficiency in car- nivorous animals is shown by the fact that if vegetable matter is mixed with their food, starch passes through them unaltered. Some time is required for the conversion of the starch by this animal diastase, and in some animals there is a

THE CHEMISTRY OF COOKERY. io6 On my first visit to Arctic Norway I arrived before the garnering and exportation of the spring cod harvest was completed. The packet stopped at a score or so of stations on the Lofodens and the mainland. Foggy weather was no impediment, as an experienced pilot free from catarrh could steer direct to the harbour by‘follow- ing his nose.’ Huge cauldrons stood by the shore in which were stewing the last batches of the livers of cod- fish caught a month before and exposed in the mean- ‘time to the continuous Arctic sunshine. Their condition must be imagined, as I abstain from description of details. The business then proceeding was the extrac- tion of the oil from these livers. It is, of course, ‘ cod- liver oil,’ but is known commercially as ‘ fish oil,’ or ‘ cod oil.’ That which is sold by our druggists as cod-liver oil is described in Norway as ‘medicine oil,’ and though prepared from the same raw material, is extracted in a different manner. Only fresh livers are used for this, and the best quality, the ‘ cold-drawn ’ oil, is obtained by pressing the livers without stewing. Those who are un- fortunately familiar with this carefully-prepared, highly- refined product, know that the fishy flavour clings to it so pertinaciously that all attempts to completely remove it without decomposing the oil have failed. This being the case, it is easily understood that the fish oil stewed so crudely out of the putrid or semi-putrid livers must be nauseous indeed. It is nevertheless used by some of the fish-fryers, and refuse ‘ Gallipoli ’ (olive oil of the worst quality) is sold for this purpose. The oil obtained in the course of salting sardines, herrings, &c., is also used. Such being the case, it is not surprising that the use of oil for frying should, like the oil itself, be in bad odour.

THE CHEMISTRY OF COOKERY. 2o6 grain in a 4-lb. loaf produced a marked alteration in the appearance of the bread. Fortunately this adulteration, if perpetrated to a mischievous extent, may be easily detected by acidulating the crumb, and then moistening with a solution of ferrocyanide of potassium. The brown colour thus produced betrays the presence of copper. The detection of alum in small quantities is extremely difficult. I should add that the ancient method of effecting the fermentation of bread, which I understand is still employed to some extent in France, differs somewhat from the ordinary modern English practice. When flour made into dough is kept for some time moderately warm, it undergoes spontaneous fermenta- tion, formerly described as ‘panary fermentation,’ and supposed to be of a different nature from the fermenta- tion which produces yeast. Dough in this condition is called leaven, and when kneaded with fresh flour and water its fermentation is communicated to the whole lump ; hence the ancient metaphors. In practice the leaven was obtained by setting aside some of the dough of a previous batch, and adding this to the next when its fermentation had reached its maximum activity. One reason why the modern method has superseded this appears to be that the leaven is liable to proceed onward beyond the first stage of fermentation, or that producing alcohol, and run into the acetous, or vinegar-forming fermentation, pro- ducing sour bread. Another reason may be that the potato mixture above described, which is but another kind of leaven, is more effectual and convenient. Dr. Dauglish’s method (patented in 1856, 1857, and 1858) is based on the fact that water under pressure absorbs and holds in solution a large quantity of car-

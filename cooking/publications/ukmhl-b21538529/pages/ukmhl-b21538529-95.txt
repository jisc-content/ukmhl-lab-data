83 COUNT RUMFORD’S ROASTER. Rumford’s soup (see Chapter XIV.), it is an admirable apparatus, and the contrivances for carrying the steam from the outer vessel to a vegetable steamer above the cooking chamber, before described, is very ingenious and effective. The statement in the prospectus, that the ‘ nourish- ing juices* otherwise wasted ‘are by that mode con- densed, and form at the bottom of the vessel a rich gelatinous body,’ is misleading. Gelatin is not volatile ; the gelatinous body at the bottom of the vessel is not composed of conden-sed vapours, though condensed vapour of water is concerned in its formation. It is simply some of the gelatin of the joint dissolved by the water which condenses upon it, and finally drips down from the joint, carrying with it the dissolved gelatin.

RUMFORD^S COOKERY AND CHEAP DINNERS. 2^5 items at the prices stated in the printed report of the Board of Agriculture of November 10, 1795* But since 1795 we have made great progress in the right direction. Bread then cost one shilling per loaf, barley and peas about 50 per cent more than at present, salt is set down by Rumford at i\d. per lb. (now about one farthing). Fuel was also dearer. But wages have risen greatly. As stated in money, they are about doubled (in purchasing power—2’.^. real wages—they are three- fold). Making all these allowances, charging wages at six times those paid by him, I find that the present cost of Rumford’s No. i soup would be a little over one half- penny per portion, and No. 2 just about one halfpenny. I here assume that Rumford’s directions for the con- struction of kitchen fireplaces and economy of fuel are carried out. We are in these matters still a century behind his arrangements of 1790, and nothing short of a coal-famine will punish and cure our criminal extra- vagance. The cookery of the above-named ingredients is con- ducted as follows : ‘ The water and pearl barley first put together in the boiler and made to boil, the peas are then added, and the boiling is continued over a gentle fire about two hours; the potatoes are then added (peeled), and the boiling is continued for about one hour more, during which time the contents of the boiler are frequently stirred about with a large wooden spoon or ladle, in order to destroy the texture of the potatoes, and to reduce the soup to one uniform mass. When this is done, the vinegar and salt are added ; and, last of all, at the moment that it is to be served up, the cuttings of bread.’ No. i is to be cooked for three hours without the potatoes. As already stated, I have found, in carrying out these

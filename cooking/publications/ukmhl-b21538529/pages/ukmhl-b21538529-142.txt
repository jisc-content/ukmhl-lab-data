128 THE CHEMISTRY OF COOKERY. leaves the soluble casein behind. The adhering ether being evaporated, we have a fairly pure specimen of casein in its original or soluble form. This, when dry, is an amber-coloured translucent substance, devoid of odour, and insipid. The insipidity and absence of odour of the pure and separated casein are noteworthy, as showing that the condition in which it exists in milk is very different from that of the casein of cheese. My object in pointing this out is to show that in the course of the manufacture of cheese new pro- perties are developed. Skim milk—a solution of casein —is tasteless and inodorous, while fresh cheese, whether made from skimmed or whole milk, has a very decided flavour and odour. If we now add some of our dry casein to water, it dissolves, forming a yellowish viscid fluid, which, on evaporation, becomes covered with a slight film of in- soluble casein, which may be readily drawn off Some of my readers will recognise in this description the re- semblance of a now well-known domestic preparation of soluble casein, condensed milk, where it is mixed with much cream, and in the ordinary preparation also much sugar. The cream dilutes the yellowness, but does not quite mask it, and the viscidity is shown by the strings which follow the spoon when a spoonful is lifted. If a concentrated solution of pure casein is exposed to the air it rapidly putrefies, and passes through a series of changes that I must not tarry to describe, beyond stating that ammonia is given off, and some crystalline substances, such as leucine^ tyrosine, &c., very interesting to the physiological chemist, but not important in the kitchen, are formed. A solution of casein in water is not coagulated by boil- ing ; it may be repeatedly evaporated to dryness and

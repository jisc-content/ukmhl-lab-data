THE CHEMISTRY OF COOKERY. 158 marble, but not so hard, and, when rubbed with the hand, differs from the marble in betraying its origin by a small degree of unctuousness, but it can scarcely be described as greasy. I find by experiment that this may be mixed with glycerine without combination taking place, that when heated with glycerine just to its fusing point, and the two are agitated together, the combination is by no means complete. Instead of obtaining a soft, smooth fat, I obtain a granular fat small stearic crystals with glycerine amongst them. It is a mixture of stearic acid and glycerine, not a chemical compound ; it is stearic acid and glycerine, but not a stearate of glycerine or glycerine stearate. A similar separation is what I suppose to occur in the cooking of animal fat. I find that mutton-fat, beef- fat, or other fat when raw is perfectly smooth, as tested by rubbing a small quantity, free from membrane, be- tween the finger and thumb, or by the still more delicate test of rubbing it between the tip of the tongue and the palate. But dripping, whether of beef, or mutton, or poultry, is granular, as anybody who has ever eaten bread and dripping knows well enough, and the manu- facturers of ‘ butterine,’ or ‘ bosch,’ know too well, the destruction or prevention of this granulation being one of the difficulties of their art. My theory of the cookery of fat is simply that heat, when continued long enough, or raised sufficiently high, effects an incipient dissociation of the fatty acids from the glycerine, and thus assists the digestive organs by presenting the base and the acids in a condition better fitted (or advanced by one stage) for the new combina- tions demanded by assimilation. Some physiologists have lately asserted that the fat of our food is not as-

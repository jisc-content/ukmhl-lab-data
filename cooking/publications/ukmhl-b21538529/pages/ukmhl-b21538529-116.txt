THE CHEMISTRY OF COOKERY. 104 The following simple practical formula may be re- duced from these data. When a considerable quantity of much-used frying-fat is accumulated, heat it to about 300° Fahr., as indicated by the crackling of water when sprinkled on it, or, better still, by a properly- constructed thermometer. Then pour the melted fat on hot water. This must be done carefully, as a large quantity of fat at 300° poured upon a small quan- tity of boiling water will illustrate the fact that water when suddenly heated is an explosive compound. The quantity of water should exceed that of the fat, and the pouring be done gradually. Then agitate the fat and water together, and, if the operator is sufficiently skilful and intelligent, the purification may be carried further by carefully boiling the water under the fat and allow- ing its steam to pass through ; but this is a little dan- gerous, on account of the possibility of what the practical chemist calls ‘bumping,’ or the sudden formation of a big bubble of steam that would kick a good deal of the superabundant fat into the fire. Whether this supplementary boiling is carried out or not, the fat and the water should be left together to cool gradually, when a dark layer of carbonised impurities will be found resting on the surface of the water, and adhering to the bottom of the cake of fat. This may be peeled off and put into the waste grease-pot to be further refined with the next operation. Ultimately the worst of it will sink to the bottom of the water. A careful cook may keep the supply of frying fat continually good, by simply pouring it into a basin (a deep pudding-basin with small area at bottom is best), letting it solidify there, and then paring away the bottom sediment. Even this dirty-looking sediment need not

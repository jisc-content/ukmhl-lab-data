INTRODUCTORY. 3 technical as applied in the designation ‘ technical educa- tion.’ So long as our workshops are separated from our science schools and colleges, it is most desirable, in order to avoid continual circumlocution, to have terms that shall properly distinguish between the work of the two, and admit of definite and consistent use. The two words are ready at hand, and, although of Greek origin, have become, by analogous usage, plain simple English. I mean the words technical and technological. The Greek noun techne signifies an art, trade, or pro- fession, and our established usage of this root is in accordance with its signification. Therefore, ‘ technical education ’ is a suitable and proper designation of the training which is given to apprentices, &c., in the strictly technical details of their trades, arts, or professions— i.e. in the skilful moving of things. When we require a name for the science or the philosophy of anything, we obtain it by using the Greek root logos, and appending it in English form to the Greek name of the general subject, as geology, the science of the earth ; anthro- pology, the science of man ; biology, the science of life, &c. Why not then follow this general usage, and adopt ‘ technology ’ as the science of trades, arts, or professions, and thereby obtain consistent and convenient terms to designate the two divisions of education—technical education, that given in the workshop, &c., and techno- logical education, that which should be given as supple- mentary to all such technical education ? In accordance with this, the present work will be a contribution to the technology of cookery, or to the technological education of cooks, whose technical educa- tion is quite beyond my reach.

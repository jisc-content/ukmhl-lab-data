10 THE CHEMISTRY OF COOKERY. water is boiling, and the thermometer stands at 212® Fahr. or ioo° Cent. With the aid of suitable apparatus it can be shown that the atmospheric gases above named continue to be given off along with the steam for a considerable time after the boiling has commenced ; the complete removal of their last traces being a very difficult, if not an impossible, physical problem. After a moderate period of boiling, however, we may practically regard the water as free from these gases. In this condition I venture to call it cooked water. Our experiment so far indicates one of the differences between cooked and raw water. The cooked water has been deprived of the atmospheric gases that the raw water contained. By cooling some of the cooked water and tasting it, the difference of flavour is very perceptible; by no means improved, though it is quite possible to acquire a preference for this flat, tasteless liquid. If a fish be placed in such cooked water it swims for a while with its mouth at the surface, for just there is a film that is reacquiring its charge of oxygen, &c., by absorbing it from the air ; but this film is so thin, and so poorly charged, that after a short struggle the fish dies for lack of oxygen in its blood ; drowned as truly and completely as an air-breathing animal when immersed in any kind of water. Spring water and river water that have passed through or over considerable distances in calcareous districts suffer another change in boiling. The origin and nature of this change may be shown by another experiment as follows: Buy a pennyworth of lime- water from a druggist, and procure a small glass tube of about quill size, or the stem of a fresh tobacco-pipe

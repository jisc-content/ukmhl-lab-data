47 CHAPTER V. ROASTING AND GRILLING. I MAY now venture to state my own view of a somewhat obscure subjectâ€”viz. the difference between the roast- ing or grilling of meat and the stewing of meat. It appears to me that, as regards the nature of the opera- tion, it consists simply in the difference between the cooking media; that a grilled steak or chop, or a roasted joint is meat that has been stewed in its own juices instead of stewed in water; that in both cases the changes taking place in the solid parts of the meat are the same in kind, provided always that the roasting or grilling is properly performed. The albumen is coagu- lated in all cases, and the gelatinous and fibrous tissues are softened by being heated in a liquid solvent. I shall presently apply this definition in distinguishing between good and bad cookery. In the roasted or grilled meat the juices are retained in the meat (with the exception of those which escape as gravy on the dish), while in stewing the juices go more or less completely into the water, and the loosen- ing of the fibres and solution of the gelatin and fibrin may be carried further, inasmuch as a larger quantity of solvent is used. Roasting and grilling may be regarded as our national methods of flesh cookery, and stewing in water that cf our continental neighbours. The difference

23 ALBUMEN following experiment. At 10.30 P.M. I placed a new- laid egg in a covered stoneware jar, of about one-pint capacity, and filled this with boiling water; then wrapped the jar in many folds of flannel—so many that, with the egg, they filled a hat-case, in which I placed the bundle and left it there until breakfast-time next morning, ten hours later. On unrolling, I found the water cooled down to 95°; the yolk of the egg was hard, but the white only just solidified and much softer than the yolk. On repeating the experiment, and leaving the egg in its j flannel coating for four hours, the temperature of the water was 123°, and the egg in similar condition—the I white cooked in perfection, delicately tender, but the I yolk too hard. A third experiment of twelve hours, water at 200° on starting, gave a similar result as regards ; the state of the egg. I thus found that the yolk coagulates firmly at a lower temperature than the white. Whether this is due to a different condition of the albumen itself or to the action of the other constituents on the albumen, requires further research to determine. The albumen of the yolk has received the name of ‘ vitellin,’ and is usually described as another variety differing from that of the white, as it is differently affected by chemical reagents ; but Lehmann ^ regards it as a mixture of albumen and casein, and describes experiments which justify his con- clusion. The difference of the temperature of coagula- tion does not appear to have been observed, and I cannot understand how the admixture of casein can effect it. When eggs are cooked in the ordinary way, the 3^ minutes’ immersion is insufficient to allow the heat to pass fully to the middle of the egg, and therefore the white is subjected to a higher temperature than the yolk. ^ Physiological Chemistry^ vol. ii. p. 356.

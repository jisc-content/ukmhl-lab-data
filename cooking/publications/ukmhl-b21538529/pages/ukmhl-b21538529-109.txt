97 FRYING. Stance, but have since learned that it was a bye-product of sugar refining. Neither the juice of the beetroot nor the sap of the sugar-cane consists entirely of pure sugar dissolved in pure water. They both contain other constituents com- mon to vegetable juices, and some peculiar to themselves. These mucilaginous matters, when roughly separated, carry down with them some sugar, and form a sort of coarse .sweetwort, capable by skilful treatment of pro- ducing a rich caramel well suited for mixing with coffee. Returning to the subject of frying, we encounter a good illustration of the practical importance of sound theory. A great deal of fish and other kinds of food is badly and wastefully cooked in consequence of the prevalence of a false theory of frying. It is evident that many domestic cooks (not hotel or restaurant cooks) have a vague idea that the metal plate forming the bottom of the frying-pan should directly convey the heat of the fire to the fried substance, and that the bit of butter or lard or dripping put into the pan is used to prevent the fish from sticking to it or to add to the rich- ness of the fish by smearing its surface. The theory which I have propounded above is that the melted fat cooks by convection of heat, just as water does in the so-called boiling of meat. If this is correct, it is evident that the fish, &c., should be completely immersed in a bath of melted fat or oil, and that the turning over demanded by the greased-plate theory is unnecessary. Well educated cooks understand this distinctly, and use a deeper vessel than our common frying-pan, charge this with a quantity of fat sufficient to cover the fish, which is simply laid upon a wire sup- port, or frying-basket and left in the hot fat until the H

307 MALTED FOOD. cooked they should be slowly heated at first, in order that the maltose may act upon the starch at its most favourable temperature (140'' to 150° Fahr.). Thirdly, when practicable, such preparations as por- ridge, pea-soup, pastry, &c., should be prepared by first cooking them in the usual manner, then stirring the malt meal or malt extract into them, and allowing the mixture to remain for some time. This time may vary from a few minutes to several hours or days—the longer the better. I have proved by experiments on boiled rice, oatmeal- porridge, pease-pudding, &c., that complete conversion may thus be effected. When the temperature of 140'^ to 150° is carefully obtained, the work of conversion is done in half an hour or less. At 212° it is arrested. At temperatures below 140°, it proceeds with a slowness varying with the depression of temperature. The most rapid result is obtained by first cooking the food as above, then reducing the temperature to 150°, and add- ing the malt flour or malt extract, and maintaining the temperature for a short time. The advantage of pre- vious cooking is due to the preliminary breaking-up and hydration of the starch granules. Fourthly, besides the malt meal or malt flour, I recom- mend the manufacture of what I may call ‘ pearl malt,’ that is, malt treated as barley is treated in the manufac- ture of pearl barley. This pearl malt may be largely used in soups, puddings, and for other purposes evident to the practical cook. It may be found preferable to the malt flour for some of the above-named purposes, espe- cially for making a puree like Rumford’s soup. I strongly recommend such a soup to vegetarians—■ i.e. the Rumford soup No. i, already described, but with the admixture of a little pearl malt with the pearl barley (or malt flour failing the pearl malt).

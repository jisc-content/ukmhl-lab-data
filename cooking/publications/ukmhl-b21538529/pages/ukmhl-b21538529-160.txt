THE CHEMISTRY OF COOKERY, 146 modified sausage-machine. The finely-divided suet is afterwards placed in suitable vessels, and heated up to 122° Fahr., but a higher temperature must be avoided, otherwise a portion of the stearine, or true tallow of the suet, becomes inextricably mixed with the oleo- margarine. It need scarcely be added that the tallow taste would be fatal to the manufacture of a first-class article. The melted fat is transferred to casks and left to cool ; afterwards it is put in small quantities into coarse bags, several of which are made into a pile with iron plates between them, and placed in a hydraulic press. The result is the expression of the pure oleo- margarine as a clear yellow oil, the solid stearine remain- ing in the bags. ‘ The next step is the manufacture of this oleomar- garine into the substance which has been designated “butterine,” and which is quoted on the London market as “ bosch.” The “ oleo ” is remelted at the lowest possible temperature, mixed with a certain proportion of milk and of butter, and then churned. The result is the pro- duction of a material closely resembling butter, in fact practically identical so far as appearance is concerned. Jt is washed, worked, and otherwise treated like real butter, and packed to simulate the kinds of butter which are most in demand on the market to which it is sent. In London all kinds of butter are sold, and we believe that they are all more or less imitated. ‘ Unfortunately for the consumer of butterine, not all that is sold, even as butter, is made with so much regard to care and cleanliness, or with such comparatively un- objectionable materials. The demand for oleomargarine, which constitutes about 60 per cent, of the mass that is churned, has naturally raised its price, and various substitutes have been tried with more or less success.

313 CHAPTER XIX. THE PHYSIOLOGY OF NUTRITION. I HAVE repeatedly spoken of the nitrogenous and non-nitrogenous constituents of food, assuming that the nitrogenous are the more nutritious, are the plastic or flesh-building materials, and that the non-nitrogenous materials cannot build up flesh or bone or nervous matter, can only supply the material of fat, and by their combustion maintain the animal heat. In doing so I have been treading on loose groundâ€”I may say on a scientific quicksand. When I first taught practical physiology to children in Edinburgh, many years ago, this part of the subject was much easier to teach than now. The simple and elegant theory of Liebig was then generally accepted, and appeared quite sound. According to this, every muscular effort is performed at the expense of muscular tissue ; every mental effort, at the expense of cerebral tissue ; and so on with all the forces of life. This consumption or degradation of tissue demands continual supplies of food for its re- newal, and as all the working organs of the animal are composed of nitrogenous tissue, it is clearly necessary, according to this, that we should be supplied with nitro- genous food to renew them, seeing that the nitrogen of the air cannot be assimilated by animals at all. But besides doing mechanical and mental work, the

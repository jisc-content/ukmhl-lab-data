THE CHEMISTRY OF COOKERY. 138 looked for it in more pretentious works, especially in the most pretentious and the most disappointing one I have yet been tempted to purchase, viz. the 27th edition of Francatelli’s ‘ Modern Cook,’ a work which I cannot recommend to anybody who has less than 20,000/. a year and a corresponding luxury of liver. Amidst all the culinary monstrosities of these ‘ high- class ’ manuals, I fail to find anything concerning the cookery of cheese that is worth the attention of my readers. Francatelli has, under the name of ‘ Eggs a la Suisse,’ a sort of foyidii., but decidedly inferior to the common fondu of the humble Swiss osteria, as Franca- telli lays the eggs upon slices of cheese, and prescribes especially that the yolks shall not be broken ; omits the milk, but substitutes (for high-class extravagance’ sake, I suppose) ‘ a gill of double cream,’ to be poured over the top. Thus the cheese is not intermingled with the egg, lest it should spoil the appearance of the unbroken yolks, its casein is made leathery instead of being dis- solved, and the substitution of sixpenny worth of double cream for a halfpenny worth of milk supplies the high- class victim with fivepence halfpenny worth of biliary derangement. In Gouffe’s ‘ Royal Cookery Book ’ (the Household Edition of which contains a great deal that is really useful to an English housewife) I find a better recipe under the name of ‘ Cheese Souffle's! He says : ‘ Put two ounces and a quarter of flour in a stewpan, with one pint and a half of milk; season with salt and pepper; stew over the fire till boiling, and should there be any lumps, strain the souffle paste through a tammy cloth; add seven ounces of grated Parmesan cheese, and seven nutritious to be eaten with a dozen other things. Their proper use is to substitute the joint in an ordinary respectable meal of meat and pudding.

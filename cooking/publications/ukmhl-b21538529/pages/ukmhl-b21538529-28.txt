THE CHEMISTRY OF COOKERY. i6 ‘ The process by which food is most commonly pre- pared for the table—BOILING—is so familiar to every- one, and its effects are so uniform and apparently so simple, that few, I believe, have taken the trouble to inquire how or in ivJiat manner these effects are pro- duced ; and whether any and what improvements in that branch of cookery are possible. So little has this matter been an object of inquiry that few, very few in- deed I believe, among the millions of persons who for so many ages have been daily employed in this process, have ever given themselves the trouble to bestow one serious thought upon the subject. ‘ The cook knows from experience that if his joint of meat be kept a certain time immersed in boiling water it will be done^ as it is called in the language of the kitchen ; but if he be asked what is done to it, or how or by what agency the change it has undergone has been effected—if he understands the question—it is ten to one but he will be embarrassed. If he does not under- stand he will probably answer without hesitation, that “ The meat is made tender and eatable by being boiledP Ask him if the boiling of the water be essential to the process. He will answer, “ Without doubtP Push him a little further by asking him whether, were it possible to keep the water equally hot without boiling, the meat would not be cooked as soon and as well as if the water were made to boil. Here it is probable he will make the first step towards acquiring knowledge by learning to doubtl In another place he points to the fact that at Munich, where his chief cookery operations were performed, water boils at 209^° (on account of its elevation), while in London the boiling-point is 212°. ‘Yet nobody, I believe, ever perceived that boiled meat was less done

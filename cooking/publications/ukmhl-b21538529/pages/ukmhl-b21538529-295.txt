281 THE COOKERY OF WINE, a given variety of grape will yield a drier wine if grown where it ripens imperfectly, than if grown in a warmer climate. But the quantity of wine obtainable from a given acreage in the cooler climate is less than where the sun is more effective, and thus the naturally dry wines cost more to produce than the natiu'ally sweet wines. The reader will understand, from what has already been stated concerning the origin of the difference be- tween natural sweet wines and natural dry wines, that the conversion of either one into the other is not a diffi- cult problem. Wine is a fashionable beverage in this country, and fashions fluctuate. These fluctuations are not accompanied with a corresponding variation in the chemical composition of any particular class of grapes, but somehow the wine produced therefrom obeys the laws of supply and demand. For some years past the demand for dry sherry has dominated in this country, though, as I am informed, the weathercock of fashion is now on the turn. One mode of satisfying this demand for dry wine is, of course, to make it from a grape which has little sugar and much albuminous matter, but in a given district this is not always possible. Another is to gather the grapes before they are fully ripened, but this involves a sacrifice in the yield of alcohol, and probably of flavour. Another method, obvious enough to the chemist, is to add as much albuminous or nitrogenous material as shall con- tinue to feed the yeast fungus until all, or nearly all, the sugar in the grape shall be converted into alcohol, thus supplying strength and dryness (or salinity) simultane- ously. Should these be excessive, the remedy is simple and cheap wherever water abounds. It should be noted that the quantity of sugar naturally contained in the

THE COOKERY OF VEGETABLES. 177 to a tough crust, and the meat is raised throughout to the cooking point. Marie Antoinette said that she would rather eat croiitons than starve, knowing that these crotUons, or meat pie-crusts, are given to the pigs ; that the pigs digest them, and are nourished by them in spite of the wood sawdust. When on the subject of cooking animal food, I had to define the cooking temperature as determined by that at which albumen coagulates, and to point out the mis- chief arising from exceeding that temperature and thus rendering the albumen horny and indigestible. No such precautions are demanded in the boiling of vegetables. The work to be done in cooking a cabbage or a turnip, for example, is to soften the cellular tissue by the action of hot water; there is nothing to avoid in the direction of over-heating. Even if the water could be raised above 212Â°, the vegetable would be rather improved than injured thereby. The question that now naturally arises is whether modern science can show us that anything more can be done in the preparation of vegetable tissue than the mere softening in boiling water. I have already said that the practice of using the digestive apparatus of sheep, oxen, &c., for the preparation of our food is merely a transitory barbarism, to be ultimately superseded by scientific cookery, by preparing vegetables in such a manner that they shall be as easily digested as the pre- pared grass we call beef and mutton. I do not mean by this that the vegetable we should use shall be grass itself, or that grass should be one of the vegetables. We must, for our requirement, select vegetables that contain as much nutriment in a given bulk as our present mixed diet, but in doing so we encounter the serious difficulty of finding that the readily soluble cell wall or main bulk N

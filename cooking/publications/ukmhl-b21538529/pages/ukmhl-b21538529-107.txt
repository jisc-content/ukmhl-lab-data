95 FRYING. browned morsel as served in an Italian restaurant with the caramel addition to the gravy ? This is a very fair question, and not difficult to answer.

Whether they will actually be digested with equal facility and assimilated with equal completeness depends upon something else not measurable by chemical analysis, viz. the relish with which they are respectively eaten. To some persons the undisguised fleshiness of the English slice, especially if underdone, is very repugnant. To these the corresponding morsel, cooked according to Gouffe rather than Mrs. Beeton, would be more nutritious. To the carnivorous John Bull, who regards such dishes as ‘ nasty French messes ’ of questionable composition, the slice of unmistakable ox-flesh, from a visible joint, would obtain all the advantages of appreciative mastication, and that sympathy between the brain and the stomach which is so powerful that, when discordantly exerted, it may produce the effects that are recorded in the case of the sporting traveller who was invited by a Red Indian chief to a ‘ dog-fight,’ and ate with relish the savoury dishes at what he supposed to be a preliminary banquet.

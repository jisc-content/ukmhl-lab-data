THE CHEMISTRY OF COOKERY. 286 of sugar is dissolved in the water, and this liquor is fer- mented. The skins and seeds contain much tannic acid or astringent matter, and this roughness imposes upon many wine-drinkers, provided the price charged for the wine thus cheapened be sufficiently high. Some years ago, while resident in Birmingham, an enterprising manufacturing druggist consulted me on a practical difficulty which he was unable to solve. He had succeeded in producing a very fine claret (Chateau Digbeth, let us call it) by duly fortifying with silent spirit a solution of cream of tartar, and flavouring this with a small quantity of orris root. Tasted in the dark it was all that could be desired for introducing a new industry to Birmingham ; but the wine was white, and every colouring material that he had tried producing the required tint marred the flavour and bouquet of the pure Chateau Digbeth. He might have used one of the magenta dyes, but as these were prepared by boiling aniline over dry arsenic acid, and my Birmingham friend was burdened with a conscience, he refrained from thus applying one of the recent triumphs of chemical science. This was previous to the invasion of France by the phylloxera. During the early period of that visitation, French enterprise being more powerfully stimulated and less scrupulous than that of Birmingham, made use of the aniline dyes for colouring spurious claret to such an extent that the French Government interfered, and a special test paper named CEnokrine was invented by MM. Lainville and Roy, and sold in Paris for the pur- pose of detecting falsely-coloured wines. The mode of using the CEnokrine is as follows; â€˜ A slip of the paper is steeped in pure wine for about five seconds, briskly shaken, in order to remove excess

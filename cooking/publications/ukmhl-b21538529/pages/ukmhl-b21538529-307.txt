THE COOKERY OF WINE, 293 merchant made a large profit, and the customer obtained what he demanded—a good wine at a ‘ respectable price.’ He could not insult his friends by putting cheap 12s. trash on his table. Here arises an ethical question. Was the wine- merchant justified in making this charge under the cir- cumstances ; or, otherwise stated, who was to blame for the crookedness of the transaction ? I say the customer ; my verdict is, ‘ Sarve him right! ’ In reference to wines, and still more to cigars, and some other useless luxuries, the typical Englishman is a victim to a prevalent commercial superstition. He blindly assumes that price must necessarily represent quality, and therefore shuts his eyes and opens his mouth to swallow anything with complete satisfaction, provided that he pays a good price for it at a respectable esta- blishment, i.e, one where only high-priced articles are sold. If any reader thinks I speak too strongly, let him ascertain the market price per lb. of the best Havanna tobacco leaves where they are grown, also the cost of twisting them into cigar shape (a skilful workwoman can make a thousand in a day), then add to the sum of these the cost of packing, carriage, and duty. He will be rather astonished at the result of this arithmetical problem. If these things were necessaries of life, or contributed in any degree or manner to human welfare, I should protest indignantly ; but seeing what they are and what they do, I rather rejoice at the limitation of consumption effected by their fancy prices.

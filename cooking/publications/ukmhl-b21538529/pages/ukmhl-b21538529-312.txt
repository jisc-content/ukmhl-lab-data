298 THE CHEMISTRY OF COOKERY. (starch) with the smallest available quantity of albumin oids and fat The slice of meat, diluted with the lump of potato, brings the whole down to about the average composition of a fairly-arranged vegetarian repast When I speak of a vegetarian repast, 1 do not mean mere cabbages and potatoes, but properly selected, well cooked, nutri- tious vegetable food. As an example, I will take Count Rumford’s No. i soup, already described, without the bread, and in like manner take beef and potatoes with- out bread. Taking original weights, and assuming that the lump of potato weighed the same as the slice of meat, we get the following composition according to the table given by Pavy, page 410 : Water Albu- men 1 Starch Sugar Fat Salts Lean beef .

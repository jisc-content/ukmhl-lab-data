GELATIN, FIBRIN, AND THE JUICES OF MEAT 35 kind of gelatin. This does not appear to be quite correct. It is certainly gelatinous in its mechanical properties, but it more nearly resembles the material of the slime and organic tissue of snails, a substance to which the name of mucin has been given. Thus the birds’-nest soup of the East and the snail soup of the West are nearly allied, and that made from callipash and callipee supplies an intermediate reptilian link. The birds’-nests, when cleaned for cooking, are en- tirely composed of the dried saliva of swallows, or rather swiftlets {collocalid), and this saliva probably contains some amount of digestive ferment or pepsin, which may render it more digestible than the vulgar product from shin of beef, and consequently more acceptable to feeble epicures. Those who have sufficient vital energy to supply their own saliva will probably prefer the vulgar concoction to the costly secretion. The bird saliva sells for its own weight in silver, when freed from adhering impurities.^ Those who are disposed to bow too implicitly to mere authority in scientific matters will do well to study the history and the treatment which gelatin has received from some of the highest of these authorities. Our grandmothers believed it to be highly nutritious, pre- * The following, from Francatelli’s Modern Cook, is amusing, if not instructive: ‘ Take two dozen garden snails, add to these the hind quarters only of two dozen stream frogs, previously skinned; bruise them together in a mortar, after which put them into a stewpan with a couple of turnips chopped small, a little salt, a quarter of an ounce of hay-saffron, and three pints of spring water. Stir these on the fire until the broth be- gins to boil, then skim it well and set it by the side of the fire to simmer for half an hour; after which it should be strained, by pressure through a tammy cloth, into a basin for use. This broth, from its soothing qualities, often counteracts, successfully, the straining effects of a severe cough, and alleviates, more than any other culinary preparation, the sufferings of the consumptive,’

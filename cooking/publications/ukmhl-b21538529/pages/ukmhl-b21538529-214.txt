THE CHEMISTRY OF COOKERY. 200 temperature of the inner part, this variation produces the differences between the crust and the crumb. The action of the high temperature in directly converting some of the starch into dextrin will be understood from what I have already stated, and also the partial con- version of this dextrin into caramel, which was described in Chapter VII. Thus we have in the crust an excess of dextrin as compared with the crumb, and the addition of a variable quantity of caramel. In lightly-baked bread, with a crust of uniform pale yellowish colour, the conversion of the dextrin into caramel has barely commenced, and the gummy character of the dextiin coating is well displayed. Some such bread, especially the long staves of life common in France, appear as though they had been varnished, and their crust is partially soluble in water. This explains the apparent paradox that hard crust, or dry toast, is more easily digested than the soft crumb of bread ; the cookery of the crumb not having been carried beyond the mere hydration of the gluten and the starch, and such degree of dextrin formation as was due to the action of the diastase of the grain during the pre- liminary period of ‘rising.’ In the crust some of the work of insalivation is already done by the baker. The digestibility of toast is doubtless aided by its brittleness, causing it to be more broken up and mixed with the saliva. Everybody has, of course, heard of ‘ unfermented bread,’ and many have tasted it. Several methods have been devised, some patented, for effecting an evolution of gas in the dough without having recourse to the fer- mentation above described. One of these is that of adding a little hydrochloric acid to the water used in moistening the flour, and mixing bicarbonate of soda in

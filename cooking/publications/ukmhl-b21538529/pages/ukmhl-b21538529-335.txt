THE PHYSIOLOGY OF NUTRITION. 321 containing the nitrogen^ which is eliminated as useless, and a residuary non-7iitrogenous poj'tion zvhich is retained and utilised in force-production! The italics are mine, for reasons presently to be ex- plained. Pavy’s work contains repetitions and further illustrations of this attribution of the origin of force to the non-nitrogenous elements of food. Then we have a statement of the experiments of Joule on the mechanical equivalent of heat, connected with experiments of Frankland with the apparatus that is u^ed for determining the calorific value of coal, &c.— viz. a little tubular furnace charged with a mixture of the combustible to be tested, and chlorate of potash. This being placed in a tube, open below, and thrust under water, is fired, and gives out all its heat to the surrounding liquid, the rise of temperature of which measures the calorific value of the substance (see fig. 7, page 21, ‘ Simple Treatise on Heat ’). From this result is calculated the mechanical work obtainable from a given quantity of different food mate- rials. That from a gramme is given as follows : Beef fat 27,778 . Units of work, Starch (arrowroot) .... 11,983! or number of In Dr. Edward Smith’s treatise on ‘ Food,’ the foot- pound equivalent of each kind of food is specifically stated in such a manner as to lead the student to conclude that this represents its actual working efficiency as food. Other modern writers represent it in like manner. Here, then, comes the bearing of these theories on my subject. A practical dietary or nmiu is demanded, say, for navvies or for athletes in full work ; another for sedentary people doing little work of any kind. Lump sugar Grape sugar pounds lifted one foot. Y

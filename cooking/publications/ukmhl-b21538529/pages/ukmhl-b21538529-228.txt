THE CHEMISTRY OF COOKERY. 214 tuents of vegetable food, and the other enjoys the same distinction among those of animal food. Both primarily exist in a soluble form ; both are rendered solid and in- soluble in water by the action of acids ; both are pre- cipitated as a curd by rerinet, and both are rendered soluble after precipitation, or are retained in their ori- ginal soluble form by the action of alkalies. They nearly resemble in flavour, and John Chinaman makes actual cheese from peas and beans. Pease-pudding hot, pease-pudding cold, Pease-pudding in the pot, nine days old. I leave to Mr. Clodd the historical problem of deter- mining whether this notable couplet is of Semitic, Aryan, Neolithic, or Paleolithic origin. Regarded from my point of view, it expresses a culinary and chemical principle of some importance, and indicates an ancient practice that is worthy of revival. I have lately made some experiments on the ensilage of human food, whereby the cellular tissue of the vege- table may be gradually subjected to that breaking up of fibre already described. One of the curious achieve- ments of chemical metamorphoses that is often quoted as a matter for wonderment is the conversion of old rags into sugar by treating them with acid. The wonderment of this is diminished, and its interest in- creased, when we remember that the cellulose or woody fibre of which the rags are composed has the same composition as starch, and thus its conversion into sugar corresponds to the every-day proceedings de- scribed in Chapter XI. All that I have read and seen in connection with the recent ensilage experiments on cattle fodder indicate that it is a process of slow vegetable cookery, a digesting or maceration of fibrous vegetables

CONDIMENTS. 261 and more, until at last inflammation, ulceration, torpidity, and finally the death of the digestive powers, accom- panied with all that long train of miseries to which I have referred. India is their special fatherland. English- men, accustomed to an active life at home, and a climate demanding much fuel-food for the maintenance of animal heat, go to India, crammed, maybe, with Latin, but ignorant of the laws of health ; cheap servants promote indolence, tropical heat diminishes respiratory oxidation, and the appetite naturally fails.

Mere chemistry supplies no answer to this question. It

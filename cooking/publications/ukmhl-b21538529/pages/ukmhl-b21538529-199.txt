185 THE COOKERY OF VEGETABLES. lation. There appears to be no intercession of living microbia in this case, nor have any been yet demon- strated to constitute the ferment of diastase, though they may be suspected. Be this as it may, diastase is a most beneficent ferment It communicates to the infant plant its first breath of active life, and operates in the very first stage of animal digestion. In a grain of wheat, for example, the embryo is sur- rounded with its first food. While the seed remains dry above ground there is no assimilation of the insoluble starch or gluten, no growth, nor other sign of life. But when the seed is moistened and warmed, the starch is changed to dextrin by the action of diastase, and the dextrin is further converted into sugar. The food of the germ thus gradually rendered soluble penetrates its tissues ; it is thereby fed and grows, unfolds its first leaf upwards, throws downward its first rootlet, still feeding on the converted starch until it has developed the organs by which it can feed on the carbonic acid of the air and the soluble minerals of the soil. But for the original insolubility of the starch it would be washed away into the soil, and wasted ere the germ could absorb it. The maltster, by artificial heat and moisture, hastens this formation of dextrin and sugar ; then by a roasting heat kills the baby plant just as it is breaking through the seed-sheath. Blue Ribbon orators miss a point in failing to notice this. It would be quite in their line to denounce with scathing eloquence such heartless infant- icide. Diastase may be obtained by simply grinding freshly germinated barley or malt, moistening it with half its weight of warm water, allowing it to stand, and then pressing out the liquid. One part of diastase is sufficient to convert 2,000 parts of starch into dextrin, and from

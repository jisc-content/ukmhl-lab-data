THE COOKERY OF WINE. 275 commences), and admires the brilliancy of the liquid, this very brilliancy being, in nineteen samples out of twenty, the evidence of adulteration, cookery, or sophis- tication of some kind. Genuine wine made from pure grape-juice without chemical manipulation is a liquid that is never reliably clear, for the reasons above stated Partial precipitation, sufficient to produce opalescence, is continually taking place, and therefore the unnatural brilliancy demanded is obtained by substituting the natural and wholesome tartrate by salts of mineral acids, and even by the free mineral acid itself. At one time I deemed this latter adulteration impossible, but have been convinced by direct examination of samples of high-priced (mark this, not cheap) dry sherries that they contained free sulphuric and sulphurous acid. The action of this free mineral acid on the wine will be understood by what I have already explained con- cerning the solubility of the bitartrate of potash. This solubility is greatly increased by a little of such acid, and therefore the transparency of the wine is by such addition rendered stable, unaffected by changes of tem- perature. But what is the effect of such free mineral acid on the drinker of the wine ? If he is in any degree pre- disposed to gout, rheumatism, stone, or any of the lithic acid diseases, his life is sacrificed, with preceding tor- tures of the most horrible kind. It has been stated, and probably with truth, that the late Emperor Napoleon III. drank dry sherry, and was a martyr of this kind. I repeat emphatically that, generally speaking, high-priced dry sherries are far worse than cheap Marsala, both as regards the quantity they contain of sulphates and free acid. Anybody who doubts this may convince himself by

THE CHEMISTRY OF COOKERY. 312 changed, as if by magic. I, therefore, write to you as a public benefactor, to thank you for your seasonable hints.’ I quote this letter (with the permission of the writer, Mr. A. T. T. Petersen) the more willingly and con fidently from the fact that I have lately adopted as a regular supper diet a porridge made of oatmeal, to which about one-sixth or one-eighth of malt flour is added. I find it in every respect advantageous, far better than ordinary simple oatmeal-porridge. The fol- lowing from Pavy, p. 229, indicates further the desir- ability of assisting the salivary glands and pancreas in digesting this otherwise excellent food. Speaking of oatmeal-porridge, he says: ‘It is apt to disagree with some dyspeptics, having a tendency to produce acidity and pyrosis, and cases have been noticed among those IS^ho have been in the daily habit of consuming it, where dyspeptic symptoms have subsided upon temporarily abandoning its use.’ My readers should try the following experiment. It supplies a striking demonstration of the potency of the diastase of malt. Make a portion of oatmeal-porridge in the usual manner, but unusually thick—a pudding rather than a porridge ; then, while it is still hot (150° or thereabouts) in the saucepan, add some diy malt flour (equal to one- eighth to one-fourth of the oatmeal used). Stir this dry flour into it and a curious transformation will take place. The dry flour instead of thickening the mixture acts like the addition of water, and converts the thick pudding into a thin porridge. I find that this paradox greatly astonishes the practical cook.

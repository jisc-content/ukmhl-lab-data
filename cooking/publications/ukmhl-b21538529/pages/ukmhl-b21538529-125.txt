Some of my readers may think that I ought to have treated this in connection with the boiling of meat, as boiling and stewing are commonly regarded as mere modifications of the same process. According to my mode of regarding the subject, i.e. with reference to the object to be attained, they are opposite processes. The object in the so-called ‘ boiling ’ of, say, a leg of mutton, is to raise the temperature of the meat through- out just up to the cooking temperature in such a manner that it shall as nearly as possible retain all its juices ; the hot water merely operating as a vehicle or medium for conveying the heat. In stewing nearly all this is reversed. The juices are to be extracted more or less completely, and the water is required to act as a solvent as well as a heat- conveyor. Instead of the meat itself surrounding and enveloping the juices as it should when boiled, roasted, grilled, or fried, we demand in a stew that the juices shall surround or envelop the meat.

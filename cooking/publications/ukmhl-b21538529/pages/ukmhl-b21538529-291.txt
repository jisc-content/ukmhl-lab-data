THE COOKERY OF JVEVE. 277 for it, though he was most anxious to do so. This was about three years ago. By dint of inquiry and cross- examination of experts in the wine trade, 1 have, I believe, discovered the origin of the sulphate of potash that is contained in the samples that the British wine- merchant sells as he buys, and conscientiously believes to be pure. At first I hunted up all the information I could obtain from books concerning the manufacture of sherry ; learned that the grapes are usually sprinkled with a little powdered sulphur as they are placed in the vats prior to stamping. The quantity thus added, however, is quite insufficient to account for the sulphur compounds in the samples of wine I examined. Another source is described in the books—that from sulphuring the casks. This pro- cess consists simply of burning sulphur inside a partially- filled or empty cask, until the exhaustion of free oxygen and its replacement by sulphurous acid renders further combustion impossible. The cask is then filled with the wine. This would add a little of sulphurous acid, but still not sufficient. Then comes the ‘ plastering,’ or intentional addition of gypsum (plaster of Paris). This, if largely carried out, is sufficient to explain the complete conversion of the natural tartrates into sulphates of potash, and such plastering is admitted to be an adulteration or sophisti- cation. I obtained samples of sherry from a reliable source, which I have no doubt the shipper honestly believed to have been subjected to no such deliberate plastering; still,from these came down an extravagantly excessive precipitate on the addition of chloride of barium solution. I afterwards learned that ‘ Spanish earth ’ was used in the fining. Why Spanish earth in preference to

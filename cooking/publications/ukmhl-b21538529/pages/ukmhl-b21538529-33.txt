ALBUMEN. 21 appearance to sight, touch, and taste of being easily digestible. This is the case. Having settled these points, proceed with the experi- ment by heating the remainder of the albumen (or a new sample) up to 212°, and keeping it for awhile at this temperature. It will dry, shrink, and become horny. If the heat is carried a little further, it becomes con- verted into a substance which is so hard and tough that a valuable cement is obtained by simply smearing the edges of the article to be cemented with white of egg, and then heating it to a little above 212°.* i This simple experiment teaches a great deal of what I is but little known concerning the philosophy of cookery. ! It shows in the first place that, so far as the coagulation i of the albumen is concerned, the cooking temperature 1 is not 212°, or that of boiling water, but 160°, z.e. 52"" ? below it. Everybody knows the difference between a tender, juicy steak, rounded or plumped out in the middle, and a tough, leathery abomination, that has been so cooked as to shrivel and curl up. The con- traction, drying up, and hornifying of the albumen in ■ the test-tube represents the albumen of the latter, while ‘ the tender, delicate, trembling, semi-solid that was co- agulated at 160°, represents the albumen in the first. But this is a digression, or rather anticipation, seeing that the grilling of a beefsteak is a problem of profound complexity that we cannot solve until we have mastered the rudiments. We have not yet determined how to practically apply the laws of albumen coagulation as ' ‘ Egg-cement,’ made by thickening white of egg with finely-powdered quicklime, has long been used for mending alabaster, marble, &c. For joining fragments of fossils and mineralogical specimens, it will be found very useful. White of egg alone may be used, if carefully healed afterwards.

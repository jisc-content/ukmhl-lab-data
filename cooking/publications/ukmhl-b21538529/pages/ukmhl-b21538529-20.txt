THE CHEMISTRY OF COOKERY. 8 CHAPTER II. THE BOILING OF WATER. As this is one of the most rudimentary of the opera- tions of cookery, and the most frequently performed, it naturally takes a first place in treating the subject. Water is boiled in the kitchen for two distinct purposes : 1st, for the cooking of itself; 2nd, for the cooking of other things. A dissertation on the differ- ence between raw water and cooked water may appear pedantic, but, as I shall presently show, it is consider- able, very practical, and important. The best way to study any physical subject is to examine it experimentally, but this is not always pos- sible with everyday means. In this case, however, there is no difficulty. Take a thin ’ glass vessel, such as a flask, or, better, one of the ‘ beakers,’ or thin tumbler-shaped vessels, so largely used in chemical laboratories ; partially fill it with ordinary household water, and then place it over the flame of a spirit-lamp, or Bunsen’s, or other smoke- less gas-burner. Carefully watch the result, and the following will be observed : first of all, little bubbles • In applying heat to glass vessels, thickness is a source of weakness or liability to fracture, on account of the unequal expansion of the two sides, due to inequality of temperature, which, of course, increases with the thickness of the glass. Besides this, the thickness increases the leverage of the breaking strain.

157 FAT—MILK. able ; while the fixed oils if similarly heated suffer various degrees of change as their temperature is raised, and may be completely decomposed by steady applica- tion of heat in a closed vessel without the aid of any other chemical agent than the heat itself. This ‘ de- structive distillation ’ converts them into solid carbon and hydro-carbon gases, somewhat similar to those we obtain by the destructive distillation of coal. If we watch the changes occurring as the heat advances to this complete dissociation point we may observe a minor or partial dissociation proceeding gra- dually onward, resembling that which I have already described as occurring when sugar is similarly treated (Chapter VII. page 87). But in ordinary cooking we do not go so far as to carbonise the fat itself, though we do brown or partially carbonise the membrane which envelopes the fat. What then is the nature of this minor dissociation, if such occurs } Before giving my answer to this question I must explain the chemical constitution of fat. It is a com- pound of a very weak base with very weak acids. The basic substance is glycerine, the acids (not sour at ail, but so named because they combine with bases as the actually sour acids do) are stearic acid, palmitic acid, oleic acid, &c., and bear the general name of ‘ fatty acids.’ They are solid or liquid, according to temperature. When solid they are pearly crystalline substances, when fused they are oily liquids. To simplify, I will take one of these as a type, and that the one which is the chief constituent of animal fats, viz. stearic acid. I have a lump of it before me. Newly broken through, it might at a distance be mistaken for a piece of Carrara marble. It is granular, like the

GELATIN, FIBRIN, AND THE JUICES OF MEAT. 41 I find no satisfactory answer to these questions in any of our text-books, and therefore will do what I can towards supplying my own solution of the problem. In the first place, it should be understood that raw gelatin, or animal membrane as it exists in its organised condition, is not soluble in cold water, and not immedi- ately in hot water. Genuine isinglass is the membrane of the swim-bladder of the sturgeon (that of other fishes is said to be sometimes substituted). In its unprepared form it is not easily dissolved, but if soaked in water, especially in warm water, for some time, it swells. The same with other forms of membrane. This swelling I regard as the first stage of the cookery. On examina- tion, I find that it is not only increased in bulk but also in weight, and that the increase of weight is due to some water that it has taken into itself. Here, then, we have crude gelatin plus water, or hydrated gelatin. Proceed- ing further, by boiling this until it all dissolves, and then allowing it to harden by very slow evaporation, I find that it still contains some of its acquired water, and that I cannot drive away this newly-acquired water without destroying some of its characteristic properties—its solubility and gluey character. Before returning to its original weight as crude isinglass, it becomes somewhat carbonised. Hence, I infer that the cookery of gelatin consists in converting the original membrane more or less com- pletely into a hydrate of its former self. According to this, the ‘ prepared gelatin ’ sold in the shops is hydrated gelatin, completely hydrated, seeing that it is com- pletely and readily soluble. The membranes of our ordinary cooked meat are, if I am right, partially hydrated, in varying degrees, and thereby prepared for solution in the course of digestion.

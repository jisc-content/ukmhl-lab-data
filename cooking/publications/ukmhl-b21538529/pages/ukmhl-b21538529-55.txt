GELATIN, FIBRIN, AND THE JUICES OF MEAT. 43 gelatin, or the substance which produces gelatin, as already explained, while the contents of the cell are albuminous matter or fat, or the special constituents of the particular organ it composes. A description of all these constituents would carry me too far into details. I must, therefore, only refer to those which constitute the bulk of animal food, and which are altered in the process of cooking. In the lean of meat, i.e. the muscles of the animal, we have the albuminous juices already described, the gelatinous membranes, sheaths, and walls of the muscle fibre, and the fibre itself. This is composed of muscle- fibrin, or syntonin, as Lehmann has named it. Living blood consists of a complex liquid, in which are sus- pended a multitude of minute cells, some red, others colourless. When the blood is removed and dies, it clots or partially solidifies, and is found to contain a network of extremely fine fibre, to which the name of fibrin is applied. A similar change takes place in the substance of the muscle after death. It stiffens, and this stiffening, or rigor mortis, is effected by the forma- tion of a clot analogous to the coagulation of the blood. The chief difference between blood-fibrin and muscle- fibrin or syntonin is, that the latter is readily soluble in water, to which only yoV'o hydrochloric acid has been added, while in such a solution blood-fibrin only becomes swollen. If the gastric juice contains a little free hydro- chloric acid, this difference is important in reference to food. I should, however, add that the existence of such free acid in the human gastric juice is disputed, especially by Gruenewaldt and Schroeder. The conflict of able chemists on this point and others concerning the composition of this fluid leads me to suppose that the secretions of the human stomach

ALBUMEN. 31 lid, which fits into a box, having a thick lining of ill- conducting material—such as felt, wool, or sawdust (it should be two or three inches thick bottom and sides). A fowl, for example, is put into the tin, which is then filled up with boiling water and covered with a close- fitting cover lined like the box, and firmly strapped down. This may be left for ten or twelve hours, when the fowl will be found most delicately cooked. For yachtsmen and ‘ camping-out ’ parties, &c., it is a very luxurious apparatus.

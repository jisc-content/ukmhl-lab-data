167 FAT—MILK. cow grazing on a sewage-farm, manured from a district on which enteric fever has existed. The cow lies down, and its teats are soiled with liquid containing the chemical poison or the germs which are so fearfully malignant when taken internally. In the course of milking a thousandth part of a grain of the infected matter con- taining a few hundred germs enters the milk, and these germs increase and multiply. The cream that rises car- ries some of them with it, and they are thus in the butter, either dead or alive—we know not which, but have to accept the risk. Now, take the case of ‘ bosch.’ The cow is slaughtered. The waste fat—that before the days of palm oil and vaseline was sold for lubricating machinery—is skilfully prepared, made up into 2 lb. rolls, delicately wrapped in special muslin, or prettily moulded and fitted into ‘ Nor- mandy ’ baskets. What is the risk in eating this ? None at all provided always the ‘ bosch ’ is not adulte- rated with cream-butter. The special disease germs do not survive the chemistry of digestion, do not pass through the glandular tissues of the follicles that secrete the living fat, and therefore, even though the cow should have fed on sewage grass, moistened with infected sewage water, its fat would not be poisoned. What we require in connection with this is commer- cial honesty : that the thousands of tons of ‘ bosch ’ now annually made shall be sold as ‘ bosch,’ or, if preferred, as ‘ oleomargarine,’ or ‘ butterine,’ or any other name that shall tell the truth. In order to render such commercial honesty possible to shopkeepers, more intelligence is demanded among their customers. A dealer, on whom I can rely, told me lately that if he offered the ‘ bosch ’ or ‘ butterine ’ to his other customers as he was then offering it to me, at Z\d. per lb. in 24-lb. box, or 9^. retail, he

THE BOILING OF WATER. II may be used. Half fill a small wine-glass with the lime-water, and blow through it by means of the tube or tobacco-pipe. Presently it will become turbid. Con- tinue the blowing, and the turbidity will increase up to a certain degree of milkiness. Go on blowing with ‘ commendable perseverance,’ and an inversion of effect will follow ; the turbidity diminishes, and at last the water becomes clear again. The chemistry of this is simple enough. From the lungs a mixture of nitrogen, oxygen, and carbonic acid is exhaled. The carbonic acid combines with the soluble lime, and forms a carbonate of lime which is insoluble in mere water. But this carbonate of lime is to a certain extent soluble in water saturated with carbonic acid, and such saturation is effected by the continuation of blowing. Now take some of the lime-water that has been thus treated, place it in a clean glass flask, and boil it. After a short time the flask will be found incrusted with a thin film of something. This is the carbonate of lime which has been thrown down again by the action of boiling, which has driven off its solvent, the carbonic acid. This crust will effervesce if a little acid is added to it. In this manner our tea-kettles, engine-boilers, &c., become incrusted when fed with calcareous waters, and most waters are calcareous ; those supplied to London, which is surrounded by chalk, are largely so. Thus, the boiling or cooking of such water effects a removal of its mineral impurities more or less completely. Other waters contain such mineral matter as salts of sodium and potassium. These are not removable by mere boiling, being equally soluble in hot or cold, aerated, or non-aerated water.

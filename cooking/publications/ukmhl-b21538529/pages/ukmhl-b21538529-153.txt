CHEESE. 139 yolks of eggs; whip the whites till they are firm, and add them to the mixture; fill some paper cases with it, and bake in the oven for fifteen minutes.’ Cre-Fydd says : ‘ Grate six ounces of rich cheese (Parmesan is the best) ; put it into an enamelled sauce- pan, with a teaspoonful of flour of mustard, a saltspoon- ful of white pepper, a grain of cayenne, the sixth part of a nutmeg, grated, two ounces of butter, two tablespoon- fuls of baked flour, and a gill of new milk ; stir it over a slow fire till it becomes like smooth, thick cream (but it must not boil) ; add the well-beaten yolks of six eggs, beat for ten minutes, then add the whites of the eggs beaten to a stiff froth ; put the mixture into a tin or a cardboard mould, and bake in a quick oven for twenty minutes. Serve immediately.’ Here is a true cookery of cheese by solution, and the result is an excellent dish. But there is some unneces- sary complication and kitchen pedantry involved. The souffle part of the business is a mere puffing up of the mixture for the purpose of displaying the cleverness of the cook, being quite useless to the consumer, as it sub- sides before it can be eaten. It further involves prac- tical mischief, as it cannot be obtained without toasting the surface of the cheese into an air-tight leathery skin that is abnormally indigestible. The following is my own simplified recipe: Take a quarter of a pound of grated cheese; add it to a gill of milk in which is dissolved as much powdered bicarbonate of potash as will stand upon a threepenny- piece ; mustard, pepper, &c., as prescribed above by Cre- Fydd.^ Heat this carefully until the cheese is completely ^ Before the Adulteration Act was passed, mustard flour was usually mixed with well-dried wheaten flour, whereby the redundant oil was absorbed, and the mixture was a dry powder. Now it is different, being

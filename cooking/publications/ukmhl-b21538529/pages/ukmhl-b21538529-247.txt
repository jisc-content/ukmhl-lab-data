RUMFORD'S COOKERY AND CHEAP DINNERS. 233 hydration of cooked gelatin, fibrin, cellulose, casein, starch, legumin, &c. That water is with them when they are cooked is evident enough, but whether that water is brought into actual chemical combination with them in such wise as to form new compounds of additional nutri- tive value proportionate to the chemical addition of water, demands so much investigation that I have been driven to merely theorise where I ought to have demon- strated. The fact that the living body which our food is build- ing up and renewing contains about 80 per cent, of water, some of it combined, and some of it uncombined, has a notable bearing on the question. We may yet learn that hydration and dehydration have more to do with the vital functions than has hitherto been supposed.

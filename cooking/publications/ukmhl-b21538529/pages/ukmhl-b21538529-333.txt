THE PHYSIOLOGY OF NUTRITION, 319 work done by the skin increases with muscular work, while that from the kidneys rather diminishes, indicates in the plainest possible manner that an examination of the skin secretion should be primary in connection with this question. To entirely neglect this in such a re- search is a scientific parallel to the histrionic feat of performing the tragedy of ‘ Hamlet ’ with the Prince of Denmark omitted. Seeing that it has been entirely neglected, I am justified in expressing, very plainly and positively, my opinion of the worthlessness of all the modern research upon which the alleged refutation of Liebig’s theory of the destruction and renewal of living tissue in the per- formance of vital work is based, and my rejection of the modern alternative hypothesis concerning the manner in which food supplies the material demanded for muscular and mental work. I may be accused of rashness and presumption in thus attempting to stem the overwhelming current of modern scientific progress. Such, however, is not the case. It is modern scientific fashion, rather than scientific progress, that I oppose. We have too mtich of this millinery spirit in the seientific world just now ; too much eagerness to run after ‘the last thing out,’ and assume, with undue readiness, that the ‘ latest researches ’ are, of eourse, the best—especially where fashionable physicians are concerned. Ha^•ing summarised Liebig’s theory of the source of vital power, and its supposed refutation by modern ex- periments, I wfill now endeavour to state the alternative modern hypothesis, though not without difficulty, nor with satisfactory result, seeing that the recent theorists are vague and self-contradictory. All agree that vital .power or liberated force is obtained at the expense of

Now take a shallow metal or earthenware dish or tray that will bear heating; put a little butter on this, and heat the butter till it frizzles. Then pour the mixture into the tray, and bake or fry it until it is nearly solidified. A cheaper dish may be made by increasing the proportion of cheese — say, six to eight ounces to three eggs, or only one egg to a quarter of a pound of cheese for a hard-working man with powerful diges- tion. Mr. E. D. Girdlestone writes as follows (I quote with permission): ‘ As regards the “ cheese fondul' your recipe for which has enabled me to turn cheese to prac- tical account as food, you may be glad to hear that it has become a common dish in our microscopic menage. Indeed cheese, which formerly was poison to me, is now alike pleasant and digestible. But some of your readers may like to know that the addition of bread-crumbs is, in my judgment at least, a great improvement, giving greater lightness to the compost, and removing the harshness of flavour otherwise incidental to a mixture which comprises so large a proportion of cheese. We (my wife and I) think this a great improvement’ I have received two other letters making, quite inde- pendently, the same suggestion concerning the bread- crumbs.

Therefore, in following any recipe of old cookery-books, only about half the stated quantity should be used.

2o8 THE CHEMISTRY OF COOKERY. rately heated—260° to 300° Fahr. is sufficient. I am fond of hot rolls for breakfast, and frequently have them d la Boussingault, by treating stale bread-crusts in this manner. My wife tells me that when the crusts have been long neglected, and are thin, the Boussingault hot rolls are improved by dipping the crust in water before putting it into the oven. This is not necessary in experimenting with a whole loaf or a thick piece of stale bread. The crumb of bread, whether new or stale, contains about 45 per cent, of water. Miller says ‘ the difference in properties between the two depends simply upon difference in molecular arrangement.’ This ‘ molecular arrangement ’ is the customary modern method of explaining a multitude of similar physical and chemical problems, or, as I would rather say, of evading explanation under the cover of a vague conventional phrase. I have made some simple experiments which supply a visible explanation of the facts without invoking the aid of any invisible atoms or molecules, or any imaginary arrangements or rearrangements of these imaginary entities. I find that, as bread becomes stale, its porosity appears to increase, and that when renewed by reheating, it returns to its original appare^itly smaller degree of poro- sity. That this change can be only apparent is evident from the facts that the total quantity of solid material in the loaf remains the same, and its total dimensions are retained more or less completely by the rigidity of the crust. I say ‘ more or less,’ because this depends upon the thickness and hardness of the crust, and also upon the completeness of its surrounding. Lightly- baked loav^es shrink a little in dimensions in becoming

184 THE CHEMISTRY OF COOKERY. it. I will therefore describe other methods by which this change may be effected. If starch be boiled in a dilute solution of almost any acid, it is converted into dextrin. A solution containing less than one per cent, of sulphuric or nitric acid is suffi- ciently strong for this purpose. One method of com- mercial manufacture (Payen’s) is to moisten lo parts of starch with 3 of water, containing 7-i-oth of its weight of nitric acid, spreading the paste upon shelves, allowing it to dry in the air, and then heating it for an hour-and-a- half at about 240° Fahr. But the most remarkable and interesting agent in effecting this conversion is diastase. It is one of those mysterious compounds which have received the general name of ‘ ferments.’ They are disturbers of chemical peace, molecular agitators that initiate chemical revolu- tions, which may be beneficent or very mischievous. The morbific matter of contagious diseases, the venom of snake-bite, and a multitude of other poisons, are fer- ments. Yeast is a familiar example of a ferment, and one that is the best understood. I must not be tempted into a dissertation on this subject, but may merely remaik that modern research indicates that many of these ferments are microscopic creatures, linking the vegetable with the animal world ; they may be described as living things, seeing that they grow from germs and generate other germs that produce their like. Where this is proven, we can understand how a minute germ may, by falling upon suitable nourishment, increase and multiply, and thus effect upon large quantities of matter the chemical revolution above named. I have already described the action of rennet upon milk, and the very small quantity which produces coagu-

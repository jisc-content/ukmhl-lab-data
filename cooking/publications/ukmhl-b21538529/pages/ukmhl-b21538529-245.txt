RUMFORD^S COOKERY AND CHEAP DINNERS. 231 able. Had he adopted the dietary of an English work- house or an English prison, his financial success would have been impossible, and his patients would have been no better fed, nor better able to work. The staple food was what he calls a *soup,’ but I find, on following out his instructions for making it, that I obtain a porridge rather than a soup. He made many experiments, and says: ‘ I constantly found that the richness or quality of a soup depended more upon a proper choice of the ingredients, and a proper manage- ment of the fire in the combination of these ingredients, than upon the quantity of solid nutritious matter em- ployed ;—much more upon the art and skill of the cook than upon the sum laid out in the market’ Our vegetarian friends will be interested in learning that at first he used meat in the soup provided for the beggars, but gradually omitted it, and the change was unnoticed by those who ate, and no difference was observable as regards its nutritive value. In 1790, little, or rather nothing, was known of the chemistry of food. Oxygen had been discovered only sixteen years before, and chemical analysis, as now understood, was an unknown art. In spite of this Rumford selected as the basis of his soup just that proximate element which we now know to be one of the most nutritious that he could have obtained from either the animal or vegetable kingdom—viz. casein. He not only selected this, but he combined it with those other constituents of food which our highest refine- ments of modern practical chemistry and physiology have proved to be exactly what are required to supple- ment the casein and constitute a complete dietary. By selecting the cheapest form of casein and the cheapest sources of the other constituents, he succeeded in supply-

THE CHEMISTRY OF COOKERY. 3o6 conversion of the starch into dextrin by means of a very small quantity of maltose. Hasty pudding made of boiled flour is similarly altered. Generally speaking, the degree of visible altera- tion is proportionate to the amount of starch, but the more intimately it is mixed with the cellulose, the more slowly the change occurs. I have made malt-porridge by using malt flour instead of oatmeal. I found it rather too sweet, but on mixing about one part of malt flour with four to eight parts of oatmeal, an excellent and easily digestible porridge is obtained, and one which I strongly recom- mend as a most valuable food for strong people and invalids, children and adults. Further details of these experiments would be tedious, and are not necessary, as they display no chemical changes that are new to science, and the practical results may be briefly stated without such details, as follows. I recommend, first, the production of malt flour by grinding and sifting malted wheat, malted barley, or malted oats, or all of these, and the retailing of this at its fair value as a staple article of food. Every shop- keeper who sells flour or meal of any kind should sell this. Secondly, that this malted flour, or the extract made from it as above described, be mixed with the ordinary flour used in making pastry, biscuits, bread, &c.,‘ and with all kinds of porridge, pastry, pea-soup, and other farinaceous preparations, and that when these are * I have lately learned that a patent was secured some years ago for ‘ malt bread,’ and that such bread is obtainable from l>akers who make it under a license from the patentee. The ‘revised formula’ for 1884, which I have just obtained, says: ‘Take of wheat meal 6 lbs., wheat flour 6 lbs., malt flour 6 oz., German yeast 2 oz., salt 2 oz., water sufhcient. Make into dough (without first melting the malt), prove well, and bake in tins. ’

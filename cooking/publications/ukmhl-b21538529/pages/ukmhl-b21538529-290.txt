270 THE CHEMISTRY OF COOKERY. simply purchasing a little chloride of barium, dissolving it in distilled water, and adding to the sample of wine to be tested a few drops of this solution. Pure wine, containing its full supply 6\ natural tar- trate, will become cloudy to a small extent, and gra- dually. A small precipitate will be formed by the tartrate. The wine that contains either free sulphuric acid or any of its compounds will yield immediately a copious white precipitate like chalk, but much more dense. This is sulphate of baryta. The experiment may be made in a common wine-glass, but better in a cylin- drical test-tube, as, by using in this a fixed quantity in each experiment, a rough notion of the relative quantity of sulphate may be formed by the depth of the white layer after all has come down. To determine this accu- rately^ the wine, after applying the test, should be filtered through proper filtering paper, and the precipitate and paper burnt in a platinum or porcelain crucible and then weighed ; but this demands apparatus not always avail- able, and some technical skill. The simple demonstra- tion of the copious precipitation is instructive, and those of my readers who are practical chemists, but have not yet applied this test to such wines, will be astonished, as I was, at the amount of precipitation. I may add that my first experience was upon a sample of dry sherry, brought to me by a friend who bought his wine of a respectable wine-merchant, and paid a high price for it, but found that it disagreed with him ; it contained an alarming quantity of free sulphuric acid. Since that I have tested scores of samples, some of the finest in the market, sent to me by a conscientious importer as the best he could obtain, and these contained sulphate of potash instead of bitartrate. My friend, the sherry-merchant, could not account

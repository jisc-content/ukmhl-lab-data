THE CHEMISTRY OF COOKERY. 314 animal body is continually giving out heat, and its tem- perature must be maintained. Food is also demanded for this, and the non-nitrogenous food is the most readily combustible, especially the hydro-carbons or fats ; the carbo-hydrates—starch, sugar, &c.— also, but in lower degree. These, then, were described as fuel food, or heat-producers. This view is strongly confirmed by a multitude of familiar facts. Men, horses, and other animals cannot do continuous hard work without a supply of nitrogenous food ; the harder the work the more they require, and the greater becomes their craving for it. On the other hand, when such food is eaten in large quantities by idle people, they become victims of inflammatory disease, or their health otherwise suffers, according, probably, to whether they assimilate or reject it. Man is a cosmopolitan animal, and the variations of his natural demand for food in different climates affords very direct support to Liebig’s theory. Enor- mous quantities of hydro-carbon, in the form of fat, are consumed by the Esquimaux and by Europeans when they winter in the Arctic regions. They cannot live there without it. In hot climates sonie fuel food is re- quired, and the milder form of carbo-hydrates is chosen, and found to be most suitable ; rice, which is mainly composed of starch, is an example. Sugar also. Offer an Esquimaux a tallow candle and a rice or tapioca pudding ; he will reject the latter, and eat the former with great relish. A multitude of other facts might be stated, all sup- porting Liebig’s theory. There is one that just occurs to me as I write, which I will state, as it appears to have been hitherto unnoticed. Some organs which act in such wise that we can see their

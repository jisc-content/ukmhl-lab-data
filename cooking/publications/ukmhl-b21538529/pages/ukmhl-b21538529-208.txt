THE CHEMISTRY OF COOKERY, 194 CHAPTER XII. GLUTEN â€” BREAD. Having treated the cookery of the chief constituents of the roots and stems of the plant, the fibre and the starch, I now come to food obtained from the seeds and the leaves. Taking the seeds first, as the more important, it becomes necessary to describe the nitrogenous con- stituents which are more abundant in them than in any other part of the plant, though they also contain starch and cell material, or woody fibre, as already stated. In the preceding chapter I described a method of separating starch from flour by washing a piece of dough in water, and thereby removing the starch granules, which fall to the bottom of the water. If this washing is continued until no further milkiness of the water is produced, the piece of dough will be much reduced in dimensions, and changed into a grey, tough, elastic, and viscous or glutinous substance, which has been com- ])ared to bird-lime, and has received the appropriate name of gluten. When dried, it becomes a hard, horny, transparent mass. It is insoluble in cold water, and partly soluble in hot water. It is soluble in strong vinegar, and in weak solutions of potash or soda. If the alkaline solution is neutralised by an acid, the gluten [s precipitated. If crude gluten, obtahied as above, is subjected to the

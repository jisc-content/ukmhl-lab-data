197 GLUTENâ€”BREAD. becoming a martyr to science may prove by simply making a meal on raw wheat, masticating the grains until reduced to small pills of gluten, and then swallow- ing them. Mild indigestion or acute spasms will follow, according to the quantity taken and the digestive ener- gies of the experimenter. Raw flour will act similarly, but less decidedly. Bread-making is the most important, as well as a typical example, of the cookery of grain-food. The grinding of the grain is the first process of such cookery; it vastly increases the area exposed to the subsequent actions. The next stage is that of surrounding each grain of the flour with a thin film of water. This is done in making the dough by careful admixture of a modicum of water and kneading, in order to squeeze the water well between all the particles. The effect of insufficient enveloping in water is sometimes seen in a loaf contain- ing a white powdery kernel of unmixed flour. If nothing more than this were done, and such simple dough were baked, the starch granules would be duly broken up and hydrated, the gluten also hydrated, but, at the same time, the particles of flour would be so cemented together as to form a mass so hard and tough when baked, that no ordinary human teeth could crush it. Among all our modern triumphs of applied science, none can be named that is more refined and elegant than the old device by which this difficulty is overcome in the everyday business of making bread. Who in- vented it, and when, I do not know. Its discovery was certainly very far anterior to any knowledge of the chemical principles involved in its application, and probably accidental. The problem has a very difficult aspect. Here are

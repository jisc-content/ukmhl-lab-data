CHEESE, 129 redlssolved. Upon this depends the practicability of preserving milk by evaporating it down, or ‘ condensing.’ This condensed milk, however, loses a little; its al- bumen is sacrificed, as everybody will understand who has dipped a spoon in freshly-boiled milk and observed the skin which the spoon removes from the surface. This is coagulated albumen. If alcohol is added to a concentrated solution of casein in water, a pseudo-coagulation occurs ; the casein is precipitated as a white substance like coagulated albumen, but if only a little alcohol is used, the solid may be re- dissolved in water ; if, however, it is thus treated with strong alcohol, the casein becomes difficult of solution, or even quite insoluble. Alcohol added to solid soluble casein renders it opaque, and gives it the appearance of coagulated albumen. The alcohol itself dissolves a little of this. The characteristic coagulation of casein, or its con- version from the soluble to the insoluble form, is pro- duced rather mysteriously by rennet. Acids generally precipitate it either from aqueous solution or from milk. The coagulation effected by mineral acids from aqueous solutions is not so complete as that produced by lactic acid from milk, or vinegar, the former coaghlum being more readily redissolved by alkalies or weaker basic sub- stances than the latter. A calf has four stomachs, the fourth being that which corresponds to ours, both in structure and functions. It is lined with a membrane from which is secreted the gastric juice and other fluids concerned in effecting the conversion of food into chyme. A weak infusion made from a small piece of this ‘ mucous membrane ’ will coagulate the casein of three thousand times its own quantity of milk, or the coagulation may be effected by K

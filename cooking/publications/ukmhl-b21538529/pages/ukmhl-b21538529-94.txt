THE CHEMISTRY OF COOKERY. 82 inside which is suspended—like the glue chamber of a glue-pot—an inner vessel. The meat to be cooked is placed without water in this inner closed vessel, which dips into the water of the outer vessel, the steam from which is led away by a side opening or pipe. This outer water being kept boiling, the meat is surrounded only by its own vapour, in the midst of which it is cooked at a low temperature. The result is similar to boiled meat, with the advan- tage of retaining those juices that pass away into the water in ordinary boiling. This advantage is unques- tionable, and so far the apparatus may be safely recom- mended. But some of the claims made in the pro- spectuses that are freely distributed are questionable. The method of roasting with Warren’s pot is to cook the meat as above described in its own vapour, then dredge with flour, and hang before the fire twenty minutes. The result is a tender imitation of roast meat, but more like boiled than roasted meat in flavour. This is much approved by many, but I am told that meat thus cooked and eaten daily palls upon the appetite. I know one, a youth (not one of our fastidious fops of the period), who, fed upon this at school during a few years, has thereby acquired a fixed aversion to boiled meat of all kinds. Regarding the subject theoretically, it appears to me that the method recommended by Captain Warren, and followed by those who use his cooker, should be reversed for roasting; that the meat should have the twenty minutes before the fire—or in a hot oven—before, instead of after, its stewing in its own vapour. Some experi- ments I have made confirm this view so far as they go, but are not sufficiently numerous to settle the question. For stewing of all kinds, and for such concoctions as

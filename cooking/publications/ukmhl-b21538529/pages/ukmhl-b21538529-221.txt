Dr. Dauglish places the flour in a strong, air-tight iron vessel, then forces water saturated with carbonic acid under high pressure into this ; kneading-knives mix the dough by their rotation. When the mixture is completed a trap at the lower part of the globular iron vessel is opened. The pressure of the confined carbonic acid above forces the dough through this in a cylindrical jet or flat ribbon as required, and this squirted cylinder or ribbon is fashioned by suitable cutters, &c., into loaves. The com- pressed gas expands, and the loaves are smartly baked before the expansive energy of the gas is exhausted. It is justly claimed for this process that it is far more cleanly than the ordinary method of making bread, as with suitable machinery such ‘ aerated bread ’ can be made without handling. The difference between new and stale bread is familiar enough, but the nature of the difference is by no means so commonly understood. It is generally supposed to be a simple result of mere drying. That this is not a true explanation may be easily proved by repeating the experiments of Boussingault, who placed a very stale loaf (six days old) in an oven for an hour, during which time it was, of course, being further dried ; but, nevertheless, it came out as a new loaf. He found that during the six days, while becoming stale, it only lost I per cent, of its weight by drying, and that during the one hour in the oven it lost 3^ per cent, in becoming new, and apparently more moist. By using an air- tight case instead of an ordinary oven, he repeated the experiment several times in succession on the same piece of bread, making it alternately stale and new each time. For this experiment the oven should be but mode-

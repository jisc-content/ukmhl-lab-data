56 THE CHEMISTRY OF COOKERY. conductors, and when their circulation is prevented by confinement between fibres, as in the meat, the rate at which heat will travel through the humid mass is very slow indeed. As few of my readers are likely to fully estimate the magnitude of this difficulty, I will state a fact that came under my own observation, and at the time surprised me. About five-and-twenty years ago I was visiting a friend at Warwick during the ‘ mop,’ or ‘statute fair’— the annual slave market of the county. In accordance with the old custom, an ox was roasted whole in the open public market-place. The spitting of the carcass and starting the cookery was a disgusting sight. We are accustomed to see the neatly-cut joints ordi- narily brought to the kitchen ; but the handling and impaling of the whole body of a huge beast by half a dozen rough men, while its stiffened limbs were stretch- ing out from its trunk, presented the carnivorous character of our ordinary feeding very grossly indeed. Nevertheless I watched the process, partook of some of its result, and found it good. The fire was lighted before midnight, the rotation of the beast on the hori- zontal spit began shortly after, and continued until the following midday, all this time being necessary for the raising of the inner parts of the flesh to the cooking temperature of about i8o° Fahr. Compare this with the grilling of a steak, which, when well done, is done in a few minutes, or the roast- ing of the small joint as above within thirty minutes, and you will see that I am justified in dwelling on the great differences of the two processes, and the necessity of very varied proceeding to meet these different con- ditions. The difference of time is so great that the smaller

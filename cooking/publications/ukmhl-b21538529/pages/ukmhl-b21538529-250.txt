236 THE CHEMISTRY OF COOKERY. instructions, that I obtain a purle or porridge rather than a soup. I found the No. i to be excellent, No. 2 infe- rior. It was better when very small potatoes were used ; they became more jellied, and the purle altogether had less of the granular texture of mashed potatoes. I found it necessary to conduct the whole of the cooking myself; the inveterate kitchen superstition concerning simmering and boiling, the belief that anything rapidly boiling is hotter than when it simmers, and is therefore cooking more quickly, compels the non-scientific cook to shorten the tedious three-hour process by boiling. This boiling drives the water from below, bakes the lower stratum of the porridge, and spoils the whole. The ordinary cook, were she ‘ at the strappado, or all the racks in the world,' would not keep anything barely boiling for three hours with no visible result. According to her positive and superlative experience, the mess is cooked sufficiently in one-third of the time, as soon as the peas are softened. She don’t, and she won’t, and she can’t, and she shan’t understand anything about hydration. ‘ When it’s done, it’s done, and there’s an end to it, and what more do you want ? ’ Hence the failures of the attempts to introduce Rumford’s porridge in our English workhouses, prisons, and soup kitchens. I find, when I make it myself, that it is incomparably superior and far cheaper than the ‘ skilly ’ at present provided, though the sample of skilly that I tasted was superior to the ordinary slop. The weight of each portion, as served to the beggars, &c., was 19*9 oz. (i Bavarian pound); the solid matter contained was 6 oz. of No. 2, or 4| oz. of No. i, and Rumford states that this ‘ is quite sufficient to make a good meal for a strong, healthy person,’ as ‘ abundantly proved by long experience.’ He insists, again and again, upon the necessity of the three-hours’ cooking, and I am

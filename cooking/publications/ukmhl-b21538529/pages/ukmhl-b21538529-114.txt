THE CHEMISTRY OF COOKERY. 10? made into tallow, or material for the soap-maker, and grease for lubricating machinery. Unsavoury stories have been told about the manufacture of butter from Thames mud or the nodules of fat that are gathered therefrom by the mudlarks, but they are all false (see paper on ‘The Oleaginous Product of Thames Mud ’ in ‘ Science in Short Chapters ’). It may be possible to purify fatty matter from the foulest of admixtures, and do this so completely as to produce a soft, tasteless fat, i.e. a butter substitute, but such a curiosity would cost more than half a crown per pound, and therefore the market is safe, especially as the degree of purification required for soap-making and machinery grease costs but little and the demand for such fat is very great. These methods of purification are not available in the kitchen, as oil of vitriol is a vicious compound. During the siege of Paris some of the Academicians devoted themselves very earnestly to the subject of the purification of fat in order to produce what they termed ‘ siege butter ’ from the refuse of slaughter-houses, &c., and edible salad oils from crude colza oil, from the rancid fish oils used by the leather-dresser, &c. Those who are specially interested in the subject may find some curious papers in the ‘ Comptes Rendus ’ of that period. In vol. Ixxi., page 36, M. Boillot describes his method of mixing kitchen-stuff and other refuse fat with lime-water, agitat- ing the mixture when heated, and then neutralising with an acid. The product thus obtained is described as ad- mirably adapted for culinary operations, and the method is applicable to the purpose here under consideration. Further on in the same volume is a ‘ Note on Suets and Alimentary Fats ’ by M. Dubrunfaut, who tells us that the most tainted of alimentary fats and rancid oils may be deprived of their bad odours by ‘ appropriate

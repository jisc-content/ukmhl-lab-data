COUNT RUMFORD^S ROASTER. 79 heat cannot do work without a corresponding fall of tem- perature. While the oven is empty the radiations from each side cross the open space to reinforce the tempe- rature of the other sides. When I first decided to write on this subject I made some designs for kitchen thermometers intending to have them made, and to recommend their use ; but was not successful. When a man condemns his own inventions, his verdict may be safely accepted without further inquiry. I afterwards learned that Messrs. Davis & Co. had already constructed special oven thermometers, to be so attached to the oven-door that the bulb should be inside and the tube having the expansion of the mercury out- side, and therefore readable without opening the door, as shown in Fig. 5, and another for standing inside the oven. Fig. 6. I learned by these thermometers the cause of my own failure. I tried to do too much—to construct one form of thermometer to do all kinds of kitchen work. A thermometer suitable for the oven is not applicable to trying the temperature of a fat-bath used in frying. I accordingly wrote to Messrs. Davis asking them to devise a thermometer for this purpose. They have done so. It is described in the next chapter. Is there, then, any difference at all between roasting and baking ? There is. In roasting, the temperature, after the first start, is maintained about uniformly throughout; while in baking bread by the old-fashioned method, the temperature continually declines from the beginning to the end of the process ; but in order that a dweller in cities, or the cook of an ordinary town house- hold, may understand this difference, some explanation is necessary. The old-fashioned oven, such as was gene- rally used in Rumford’s time, and is still used in country

THE COOKERY OF VEGETABLES. i8i St. Martin. These showed that fresh raw oysters re- quired 2 hours 55 minutes, and stewed fresh oysters hours for digestion, against i hour for boiled tripe and 3 hours for roast or boiled beef or mutton. Oysters contain more than 8o per cent, of water, and are, weight for weight, far less nutritious than beef or mutton ; less than the easily digestible tripe. But tripe is cheap and vulgar, therefore kitchenmaids, footmen, and fashionable physicians despise it. The change which takes place in the cookery of starch may, I think, be described as simple hydration, or union with water; not that definite chemical combina- tion which may be expressed in terms of chemical equi- valents, but a sort of hydration of which we have so many other examples, where something unites with water in any quantity, the union being accompanied with an evolution of some amount of heat. Striking illustrations of this are presented on placing a piece of hydrated soda or potash in water, or mixing sulphuric acid, already combined chemically with an equivalent of water, with more water. Here we have aqueous adhesion and con- siderable evolution of heat, without the definitive quan- titative chemical combination demanded by atomic theories. In the experiment above described for separating the starch from wheat flour, the starch thus liberated sinks to the bottom of the water and remains there undissolved. The same occurs if arrowroot be thrown into water. This insolubility is not entirely due to the intervention of the envelope of the granules, as may be shown by crushing the granules, zv/iile dry, and then dropping them into water. Such a mixture of starch and cold water remains unchanged for a long time—Miller says ‘ an indefinite time.’

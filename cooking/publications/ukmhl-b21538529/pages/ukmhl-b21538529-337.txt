3^3 THE PHYSIOLOGY OF NUTRITION. rest. Yet we are told that ‘the performance of work may be looked upon as necessitating a proportionate supply of nitrogenous alimentary matter,’ and that such material ‘ is split up into two distinct portions, one con- taining the nitrogen, which is eliminated as useless.’ This thesis is proved by experiments showing (as asserted) that such elimination is not so proportioned. In short, the modern theory presents us with the following pretty paradox. The consumption of nitro- genous food is proportionate to work done. The elimi- nation of nitrogen is not proportionate to work done. The elimination of nitrogen is proportionate to the consumption of nitrogenous food. I have tried hard to obtain a rational physiological view of the modern theory. When its advocates compare our food to the fuel of an engine, and maintain that its combustion directly supplies the moving power, what do they mean } They cannot suppose that the food is thus oxidised as food, yet such is implied. The work cannot be done in the stomach, nor in the intestinal canal, nor in the mesenteric glands, nor in their outlet, the thoracic duct. After leaving this, the food becomes organised living material, the blood being such. The question, therefore, as between the new theory and that of Liebig, must be whether work is effected by the combustion of the blood itself ox by the degradation of the working tissues, which are fed and renewed by the blood. Although this is so obviously the only rational physiological question, I have not found it thus stated. Such being the case, the supposed analogy to the steam-engine breaks down altogether ; the food is certainly assimilated, is converted into the living mate- rial of the animal itself before it does any work, and

CHEESE iSr Parmesan cheese is fit for this purpose, and have in- fected many Englishmen with the same idea. Thus it happens that fancy prices are paid in this country for that particular cheese, which nearly resembles the cheese known in our midland counties as ‘skim dick’—sold there at about fourpence per pound, or given by the far- mers to their labourers. It is cheese ‘ that has sent its butter to market,’ being made from the skim-milk which remains in the dairy after the pigs have been fully supplied. I have used this kind of cheese as a substitute for Parmesan, and I find it answers the purpose, though it has not the fine flavour of the best qualities of Parme- san. The only fault of our ordinary whole-milk English and American cheeses is that they are too rich, and can- not be so finely grated on account of their more unctuous structure, due to the cream they contain. I note that in the recipes of high-class cookery-books, where Parmesan is prescribed, cream is commonly added. Sensible English cooks, who use Cheshire, Cheddar, or good American cheese, are practically including the Par- mesan and the cream in natural combination. By allowing these cheeses to dry, or by setting aside the outer part of the cheese for the purpose, the difficulty of grating is overcome. I have now to communicate another result of my cheese-cooking researches, viz. a new dish—cheese- porridge—I may say, a new class of dishes—cheese- porridges. They are not intended for epicures, who only live to eat, but for men and women who eat in order to live and work. These combinations of cheese are more especially fitted for those whose work is muscular, and who work in the open air. Sedentary brain-workers should use them carefully, lest they suffer from over-

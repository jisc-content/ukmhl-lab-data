I have spoken of beef-tea, or Extractiim carnis (Liebig’s ‘ Extract of Meat ’), as an extreme case of ex- tracting the juices of meat, and must now explain the difference between this and the juices of an ordinary- stew. Supposing the juices of the meat to be extracted by maceration in cold water, and the broth thus obtained to be heated in order to alter its raw flavour, a scum will be seen to rise upon the surface; this is carefully re- moved in the manufacture of Liebig’s ‘ Extract,’ or in the preparation of beef-tea for an invalid, but in thus skim- ming we remove a highly-nutritious constituent—viz. the albumen, which has coagulated during the heating. The pure beef-tea, or Ext7'actiLm carnis, contains only the kreatine, kreatinine, the soluble phosphates, the lactic acid, and other non-coagulable saline constituents, that are rather stimulating than nutritious, and which, properly speaking, are not digested at all—i.e. they are not converted into chyme in the stomach, do not pass through the pylorus into the duodenum, &c., but, instead of this, their dilute solution passes, like the water we drink, directly into the blood by endosmosis through the delicate membrane of that marvellous network of micro- scopic blood-vessels which is spread over the surface of every one of the myriads of little upstanding filaments which, by their aggregation, constitute the villous or velvet coat of the stomach. In some states of prostra- tion, where the blood is insufficiently supplied with these juices, this endosmosis is like pouring new life into the body, but it is not what is required for the normal sustenance of the healthy body.

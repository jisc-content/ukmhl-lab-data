T90 THE CHEMISTRY OF COOKERY. much over-cook it. Its floury character will have dis- appeared, it will have become soft and gummy. The reader can explain this by simply remembering what has already been explained concerning the formation of dextrin. It is due to the conversion of some of the starch into dextrin. My explanation of the difference between the waxy and floury potato is that the latter is so constituted that all the starch granules may be disintegrated by heat in the manner already described before any considerable proportion of the starch is con- verted into dextrin, while the starch of the waxy potatoes for some reason, probably a larger supply of diastase, is so much more readily convertible into dex- trin, that a considerable proportion becomes gummy before the whole of the granules are broken up, i.e. before the potato is cooked or softened throughout. I must here throw myself into the great controversy of jackets or no jackets. Should potatoes be peeled before cooking, or should they be boiled in their jackets ? I say most decidedly in jackets, and will state my reasons. From 53 to 56 per cent, of the above-stated saline con- stituents of the potato is potash, and potash is an important constituent of bloodâ€”so important that in Norway, where scurvy once prevailed very seriously, it has been banished since the introduction of the potato, and, according to Lang and other good authorities, this is owing to the use of potatoes by a people who formerly were insufficiently supplied with saline vege- table food. Potash salts are freely soluble in water, and I find that the water in which potatoes have been boiled con- tains potash, as may be proved by boiling it down to concentrate, then filtering and adding the usual potash test, platinum chloride

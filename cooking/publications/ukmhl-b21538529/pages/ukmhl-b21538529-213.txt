199 GLUTEN—BREAD, water, a llvel)'' ‘ sponge,’ as the baker calls it, is produced, which ‘rises’ or grows in bulk by the evolution and interposition of millions of invisibly small bubbles of gas. This sponge is mixed with more flour and water, and kneaded and kneaded again to effect a complete and equal diffusion of the gas bubbles, and finally, the porous mass of dough is placed in an oven previously raised to a temperature of about 450°. The baker’s old-fashioned method of testing the tem- perature of his oven is instructive. He throws flour on the floor. If it blackens without taking fire, the heat is considered sufficient. It might be supposed that this is too high a temperature, as the object is to cook the flour, not to burn it. But we must remember that the flour which has been prepared for baking is mixed with water, and the evaporation of this water will materially lower the temperature of the dough itself. Besides this, we must bear in mind that another object is to be attained. A hard shell or crust has to be formed, which will so encase and support the lump of dough as to pre- vent it from subsiding when the further evolution of carbonic acid gas shall cease, which will be the case some time before the cooking of the mass is completed. It will happen when the temperature reaches the point at which the yeast-cells can no longer germinate, which temperature is considerably below the boiling point of water. In spite of this high outside temperature, that of the inner part of the loaf is kept down to a little above 212^ by the evaporation of the water contained in the bread. The escape of this vapour and the expansion of the carbonic acid bubbles by heat combine to increase the porosity of the loaf. The outside being heated considerably above the

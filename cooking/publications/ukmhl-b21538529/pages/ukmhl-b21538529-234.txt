220 THE CHEMISTRY OF COOKERY. cepting potatoes) have been boiled. When we boil cabbages, turnips, carrots, &c., we dissolve out of them a very large proportion of their saline constituents ; salts which are absolutely necessary for the maintenance of health ; salts without which we become victims of gout, rheumatism, lumbago, neuralgia, gravel, and all the ills that human flesh with a lithic acid diathesis is heir to ; i.e. about the most painful series of all its inheritances. The potash of these salts existing therein in combination with organic acids is separated from these acids by organic combustion, and is then and there presented to the baneful lithic acid of the blood and tissues, the stony torture-particles of which it converts into soluble lithate of potash, and thus enables them to be carried out of the system. I know not which of the Fathers of the Church in- vented fast-day and soiipe maigre., but could almost sup- pose that he was a scientific monk, a profound alchemist, like Basil Valentine, who, in his seekings for the aurum potahile, the elixir of life, had learned the beneficent action of organic potash salts on the blood, and therefore used the authority of the Church to enforce their frequent use among the faithful. The above remarks when published in ‘ Knowledge ’ invoked much correspondence, including many inquiries for further information concerning the salts that should be contained in our food, and in what other form they might be obtained. I therefore add the following, especially as I can speak from practical experience of the miseries that may be escaped by understanaing and applying it. I inherit what is called a ‘ lithic acid diathesis.’ My father and his brothers were martyrs to rheumatic gout, and died early in consequence. I had a premonitory attack

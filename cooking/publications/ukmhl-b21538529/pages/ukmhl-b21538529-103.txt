91 FRYING. stock-broth, tarragon vinegar, ketchup, &c., but burnt flour, burnt sugar, or burnt onions, or burnt something is the basis of it all. To further test the flavouring properties of browning, take some eels cut up as usual for stewing ; divide into two portions ; stew one brutally—by this I mean simply in a little water—serving them with this water as a pale gravy or juice. Let the second portion be well fried, fully caramelised or browned, then stewed, and served with brown gravy. Compare the result. Make a corre- sponding'experiment with a beefsteak. Cut it in two portions; stew one brutally in plain water; fry the other, then stew it and serve brown. Take a highly-baked loaf—better one that is black outside ; scrape off the film of crust that is quite black, i.e. completely carbonised, and you will come to a rich brown layer, especially if you operate upon the bottom crust. Slice off a thin shaving of this and eat it criti- cally. Mark its high flavour as compared with the comparatively insipid crumb of the same loaf, and note especially the resemblance between this flavour and that of the caramel from sugar, and that of the browned eels and browned steak. A delicate way of detecting the flavour due to the browning of bread is to make two bowls of bread and milk in the same manner, one with the crust the other with the crumb of the same loaf. I am not suggesting these as examples of better or worse flavour, but as evidence of the fact that much flavour of some sort is generated. It may be out of place, as I think it is, in the bread and milk, or it may be added with much advantage to other things, as it is by the cook who manipulates caramel and its analogues skilfully. The largest constituent of bread is starch. Excluding water, it constitutes about three-fourths of the weight of

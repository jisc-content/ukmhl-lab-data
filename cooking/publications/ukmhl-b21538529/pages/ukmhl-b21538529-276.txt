2j2 THE CHEMISTRY OF COOKERY. is purely a physiological subject, to be studied by ob- servation of effects. Such observations may be made by anybody whose system has not become ‘ tolerant ’ of the substance in question. My own experience of cocoa in all its forms is that it is not stimulating in any sensible degree. I have acquired no habit of using it, and yet 1 can enjoy a rich cup or bowl of cocoa or chocolate just before bed-time without losing any sleep. When I am occasionally betrayed into taking a late cup of coffee or tea, I repent it for some hours after going to bed. My inquiries among other people, who are not under the influence of that most powerful of all arguments, the logic of inclination, have confirmed my own expe- rience. I should, however, add that some authorities have attributed exhilarating properties to the theobromine or nitrogenous alkaloid of cocoa. Its composition nearly resembles that of theine. as the following (from John' ston) shows: Theine Theobromine Carbon . . , . • . 49 ‘So 46-43 Hydrogen . . . . 5 4-20 ^Nitrogen . , • . . 28-83 35-85 Oxygen . , , . . . 1629 13-52 100-00 100 00 It exists in the cocoa bean in about the same pro- portion as the theine in tea, but in making a cup of cocoa we use a much greater weight of cocoa than of tea in a cup of tea. If, therefore, the properties of theobromine were similar to those of theine, we should feel the stimulating effects much more decidedly. The alkaloid of tea and coffee in its pure state has been administered to animals, and found to produce paralysis, but I am not aware that theobromine has acted similarly.

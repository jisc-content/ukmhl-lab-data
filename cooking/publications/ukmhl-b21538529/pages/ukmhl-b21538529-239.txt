VEGETABLE CASEIN AND VEGETABLE JUICES. 225 Intimately connected with this part of my subject is another vegetable principle that I have not yet named. This is vegetable jelly, or pectin^ the jelly of fruits, of turnips, carrots, parsnips, &c. Fremy has named it pec- tose. Like the saline juices of meat it is very little changed by cookery. An acid may be separated from it which has been named ‘ pectic acid,' the properties and artificial compounds of which appear to me to suggest the theory that the natural jelly of fruits largely con- sists of compounds of this acid with potash or soda or lime. We all know the appearance and flavour of cur- rant jelly, apple jelly, &c., which are composed of natural vegetable jelly plus sugar. The separation of these jellies is an operation of cookery, and one that deserves more attention than it reeeives. I shall never forget the rahat lakoum^ prepared for the Sultana, which I once had the privilege of eating in the kitchen of the Seraglio of Stamboul, where it was pre- sented to me by his Excellency the Grand Confectioner as a sample of his masterpiece. Its basis was the pure pectose of many fruits, the inspissated juices of grapes, peaches, pine-apples, and I know not what others. The sherbet was similar, but liquid. Well may they obey the Prophet and abstain from the grosser concoc- tions that we call wine when such ambrosial nectar as this is supplied in its place ! It is to Imperial Tokay as tokay is to table-beer ! I tasted many other choice confections there, and when I find myself defending the Turk against his many enemies, my conscience some- times asks whether my politics have been influenced by the remembrance of that visit. The ‘ lumps of delight * sold by our confectioners are imitations made of flavoured gelatin. Similar Q

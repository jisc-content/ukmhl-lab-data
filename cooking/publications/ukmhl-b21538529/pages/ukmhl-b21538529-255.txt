RUMFORD'S COOKERY AND CHEAP DINNERS. 24T this food, which is uncommonly sweet and nourishing, may be used in a great variety of ways ; but the best way of using it is to mix it with milk, and with soups and broths as a substitute for bread.’ He prefers it to bread because ‘ it requires more mastication, and conse- quently tends more to prolong the pleasure of eating.’ The cost of this soup he estimates as follows: s. d. 5 lbs. barley meal, at i\d. per. lb., or 5^-. 6d. per bushel . o 7 V 5 lbs.

The feeding of the Bavarian soldiers is stated in detail in vol. i. of Rumford’s ‘ Essays.’ I take one characteristic example. It is from an official report on experiments made ‘ in obedience to the orders of Lieut.- R

469 PASTRY. — CAKES. TARTLETS, BRIOCHES. 1014. Small brioches. The paste for small brioches is the same as the one employed for large brioches or rings. In order to prepare these brioches, the paste must be taken when it is broken and well cooled (see art. 1037) ; divide it, roll it out in strings of the thickness of at least an inch ; then transversally divide these strings in such a manner as to obtain these portions all of an equal size; mould these portions, that is fold the paste up with the lingers rounding it. This done, place each portion in a buttered brioche- mould, observing that the folded part of the brioche is placed below. Form a hollow in the centre of the paste, introduce into it another little piece of paste, moulded in a long shape, and pointed at one end: this is the thing called the head of the brioche. Egg the upper surface of the brioches, bake them in a hot oven for twenty minutes. 1015. Apricot-tartlets, with cream. Line a dozen tartlet-moulds with sweetened short-paste, such as described, ail. 912; till the hollow of the mould with a preparation of pastry- cream, bake them in a slack oven for twenty-five minutes; when they have half-cooled, mask the surface of the cream with a layer of apricot-marmalade, kept rather consistent. Place on each of these tartlets half an apricot of-a nice color, peeled, very slightly cooked in compote, and cold; surround the fruit with two rows of little beads in ‘meringue’, push the tartlets again into a slack oven, in order to dry the ‘meringue’; when they are taken out, serve them. 1016. ‘Nouilles’-cakes, with sabayon. Chisel a pound or a pound and a quarter of ‘nouille’-paste, plunge it into three glassfuls of milk in ebullition; .add to it a handful of powder-sugar, and five or six ounces of butter; three minutes after,

THE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-BOOK. 140 puree ol pheasant, partridge, or any other game, warmed at the moment. Cover each oi the patties with its cover, dish them in a group on a folded napkin. — The first drawing (101) represents the channeled paste- cutter ; the second (102), one of the patties ready for baking; the third (103), the baked patty, not emptied. 336. Turbot-‘croquettes’. Take a thick piece ot cooked turbot, from which remove bones as well as skin, and then distribute the meat into little dice, place this salpicon in a little stewpan, add to it half its volume of cooked mush- rooms, equally cut in dice; keep it covered. Pour a few spoonfuls of good ‘bechamel’-sauce (see art. 141) into a stewpan, which set on a brisk fire; work the sauce with a spoon, without leaving it; from time to time add to it a little good raw cream: when reduced to halt its volume, when firm, creamy, and of a nice consistence, add to it the turbot- and mushroom-‘salpicon’: when the preparation is at the degree requisite, the ‘salpicon’ must absorb the sauce entirely, so as to form a consistent preparation; this done, immediately remove the stewpan off the fire, season the preparation to high relish, pour it on a dish, and thus let it cool. Roll the croquettes into the shape of a cork, breadcrumb, and fry them. ■ ^ 337. Fried chicken-‘quenelles’. Take filteen poached and cooled ‘quenelles’ (see chicken-quenelles with truffles); dip them into beaten eggs, and breadcrumb them; at serving-time, plunge them into hot frying-fat, let them take a nice color, drain them, dish them up, on a napkin, with fried parsley. 338. ‘Bouchees’ (patties) and ‘croquettes’. The mixed ‘hors-d’oeuvre’ have the double advantage, of offering to the guests a various choice of food, and to contrast the other dishes, which generally do not admit of any mixture. The ‘bouchees’ can be garnished with game or poultry ‘salpicon’, but they may also be garnished with a ‘salpicon’ of crayfish, prawns, oysters, or lobster.

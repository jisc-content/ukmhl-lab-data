Roast partridges. The partridges, destined to be roasted, may be either larded, or wrapped up in bacon, if done on the spit. Partridges may however be roasted either in the oven or on the spit; yet the latter is certainly preferable. Draw two line partridges, truss them, lard or wrap them up in bacon, pierce them through (filing them on) with an iron-skewer, which fix to the spit; roast them at a good fire, lor twelve or fifteen minutes, bast- ing them with butter; salt them previous to taking them off the spit; dish them up, either whole or carved ; surround them with halves of lemons, serve up a little good gravy in a sauceboat. â€” Heath- pout (cjclmotte) is roasted in the same manner. 771.

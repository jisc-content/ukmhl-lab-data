PASTRY. — DARTOIS-CAKES, ‘CHOUX’, ‘ECLAIRS’. 1032. ‘Choux’ crisped, and glazed. 477 Squeeze on to a baking-sheet fifteen little ‘choux’ (see draw. 345); egg them, then place on each of them a little pinch of chopped or minced almonds ; cover the almonds with a short pinch of powder-sugar. Bake the ‘choux’ in a slack oven ; when they are cold, they may be opened, and garnished, either with some marmalade, or else with currant-, quince-, or apple-jelly. In order to glaze the ‘choux’, let them cool; then take them, one by one, and dip their upper surface into ‘casse-sugar; this done, place them on a pastry-grate, in order to drain the sugar. — These ‘choux’ may be garnished in their interior with cream, flavored with rum, kirsch, or orange-flower water. Draw. 346. Draw. 347. 1033. ‘Eclairs’, with coffee. Prepare some ‘choux’-paste in the conditions prescribed, art. 1031, but with rather less butter; introduce it into a bag, and squeeze on a baking- sheet some strings of the thickness and length of a finger, that is, three or four inches long; egg them, bake them in a slack oven, in order to obtain them dry; when they have cooled, split them on their basis, garnish their interior with whipped cream, or light ‘frangipane’, with coffee; when they are garnished, rub their upper sur- face with a little marmalade; then mask them with icing-sugar, pre- pared thus: Pour into a kitchen-basin half a glassful of tepid syrup ; mix up with it two teaspoonfuls of water, and a few drops of coffee-extract; fill it then with fine sugar passed through a silken sieve, so as to obtain a liquid glaze. With this glaze mask each of the cakes in turn, .range them one after the other on a pastry-grate, let the glaze dry, and serve the cakes.

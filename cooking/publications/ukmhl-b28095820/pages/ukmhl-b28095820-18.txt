THE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-BOOK. X lieatecl stove or closet, while awaiting the moment, when they shall appear on table: this hot-closet must be placed in some chamber close adjoining to the dining-room (see draw. 78).

Nothing so sadly disenchants the man of taste in food, or so mars its enjoyment, as a well chosen dinner, served with ill

Break into a kitchen-basin four whole eggs; add to them four table- spoonfuls of flour, and the same of sugar ; dilute the preparation with two glassfuls of milk, pass it through a sieve, into a stewpan ; add to it a piece of butter, a grain of salt, and two spoonfuls of chopped almonds. Stir the preparation on the fire, in order to thicken it; let it boil for a few minutes, take it off the fire, add to it three ounces of butter and a spoonful of lemon-sugar. Butter a flawn-circle (see draw. 338), line it with thin short-paste, and pour into the hollow the cooled cream- preparation.

Apple-flawn, with open-work. Prepare a short-paste with three quarters of butter to each pound ot flour, three yolks of eggs, four tablespoonfuls of powder-sugar, a grain of salt, and a little water. Let the paste rest.

With strings of the same paste, rolled on the floured slab, form some open-work (trellice-work), soldering these strings with the paste of the rim ; pinch the paste on the top all round, egg it, push it into a slack oven, bake it for thirty-five minutes ; sprinkle over sugar, a few minutes before taking it out of the oven : let it cool previous to removing the mould.

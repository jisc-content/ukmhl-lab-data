Serve separately a plate of bread-toast, broiled, and still hot. 530. Pickled-tongue, sour-sweet sauce. If one wishes to have tongues salted at home, it is best to salt several at a time ; choose them fresh, trim them, rub them with fine salt, till the meat be softened. Place the tongues on a baking-sheet, one beside the other, with a weight on ; twenty-four hours after, range them in layers in a wooden tub, or else in a wedgewood-pan; cover them with cooked and cooled souse {see art. 33), cover the vessel with a cloth, and thus keep it in a cool place. Every second day turn the tongues, placing those uppermost on the bottom. Twelve or fifteen days after, drain one tongue, let it soak, and boil it in water for three hours; drain it again, remove its skin, glaze it with the paste-brush, dish it, mask it with piquant-sauce, finished with currant-jelly and small raisins. 531. Pickled ox-tongue, chestnut-puree. Boil in water a pickled tongue; when it is tender, drain it; then remove its skin, place the tongue in a stewpan with a little wine and melted meat-glaze; let the liquid reduce ; when the tongue is glazed to the degree requisite, and has taken a nice color, dish it on a chestnut- puree of nice consistence ; mix into the cooking-stock a little broth, let it boil, skim off its fat, pass it through a sieve, let it reduce to half-glaze, pour it over the pickled tongue. 532. Baked beef-fillet, studded with truffles. Trim a good fillet of beef; stud its surface with truffles ; mask it with strips of bacon, and set it on a narrow baking-sheet with upturned rim, the bottom of which is masked with trimmings of bacon and vegetables, as well as aromatics ; moisten it with a glassful of wine, then bake it in a slack oven, for nearly an hour, basting it repeatedly.

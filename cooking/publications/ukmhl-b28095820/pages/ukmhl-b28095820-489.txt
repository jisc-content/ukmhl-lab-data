431 SWEET-ENTREMETS. â€” APPLES, &c. 933. Glazed apples. Choose some small apples of an equal size ; hollow them on their centre with the aid of a little tube out of the column-box; peel them, let them boil in acidulated, slightly sweetened water; in order to retain them quite whole, it is convenient to boil them almost without any ebullition at all, and keeping them covered. Drain them, place them in a kitchen-basin, pour over them a little syrup; let them cool; drain them, then coat them repeatedly, with the aid of a paste-brush dipped into tepid apricot-marmalade, rather consistent, so that it may stick to the apples ; decorate them then on the top with a circle of little rounds in angelica. Fill the hollow of the apples with preserved cherries, or with a little fruit-jelly : quince-, currant-, or apple-jelly; the species may also be mixed. Dish them up in a group, and decorate them with angelica-leaves. 934. Apple-mince. Pluck five or six rennet-apples, divide each of them in two, cut each of these halves into six pieces, which pieces place then in a stewpan, with six ounces of sugar, and half the zest of a lemon; moisten them to three-fourths their height with water, and the juice of some lemons; cover the stewpan, set it on the fire ; give the liquid two bubblings, then take the stewpan off the fire; when the syrup is cold, remove the zest; pour the apples and the syrup out on a deep dish, sprinkle over a pinch of currants, well washed, and serve it. 935. Apples with rice. Choose six or eight not too large Calville-apples ; cut each of them into two or four pieces; peel them, remove their cores; boil them on a very slow fire, with a little sugar, a little butter, and a little water.

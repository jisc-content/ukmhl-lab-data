THE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-BOOK. 168 shells, as well as their liquor ; sprinkle over a pinch of pepper, a little chopped parsley, and some grated bread-crumb ; baste them with the aid of the paste-brush, dipped into a little melted butter; range these shells solidly on the gridiron, which push into the hot oven, and let the oysters slightly gratinate on the top ; serve them immediately when done. 397. Oysters, with fine-herbs. Blanch the meat of six dozen oysters (see art. 48); dram them, preserving their liquor; beard, and wash them. — Fry in a stewpan with butter, three tablespoonfuls of chopped onions, and shalots, to which add seven or eight spoonfuls of fresh mushrooms equally chopped; let their moisture reduce, moisten them with a little broth, and a part of the oysters’ liquor; boil the fine-herbs a few minutes, and thicken them with a little piece of kneaded-butter, then add the oysters ; at the first bubbling, thicken the sauce with a liaison of two yolks of eggs, finish it with the juice of a lemon, a pinch of cayenne-pepper, and another of chopped parsley; with this preparation fill eight or nine table-shells; mask their upper surface with a slight layer of bread-crumb, fried with butter ; serve thus the shells. 398. Fried red-herrings. Take the fillets of some herrings, let them soak in milk ; remove their skin, spunge them on a cloth; divide each of these fillets in two, range them on a plate, baste them with a little oil, and sprinkle over some chopped parsley ; dip them into some frying-paste (see art. oJ), plunge them into hot frying-fat (oil); as soon as the paste has taken a fine color, drain the fillets, and dish them. 399. ‘Horly’ of salmon-fillets. Remove the skin, and bones of a piece of salmon, cut the meat of the fillets transversally into slices, let them macerate for an hour, pro- ceeding as said for sole-fillets; drain them, flour, dip them into beaten eggs ; drain them one by one, and immediately plunge them into hot tat,

202 THE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-BOOK. 472. Watersouchet of perch. Choose three or four live perch, that is, as fresh as possible; cut off their reel fins, and keep these by. Scale and cleanse the perch, place them inastewpan, surround them with some spoonfuls of celery-root, and tender carrot, shred into ‘julienne’; add also some sprigs of fresh parsley, cut the length of the vegetables ; slightly salt the fish, cover them just to height with water, and a little white wine, let them boil on a brisk fire. When they are done, remove them with the aid of a skimmer, and dish them up ; then stick on the top, their red fins kept by; finish boiling the vegetables cut to ‘julienne’, letting the liquid reduce to half; at this degree, pour the broth on the perch, and dish the vegetables all round. Serve separately some fresh butter, and some butter-sauce. 473. Gratined small whitings. Take six properly cleansed small whitings, remove their head, notch them on both sides, season them. Butter the bottom of a ‘gratin -dish, sprinkle over a pinch of chopped onion, another of fresh mushroom like- wise chopped ; range the whitings on the dish, placing them side by side, sprinkle also over mushrooms and parsley, then a pinch of bread-crumb; pour over a little butter. Pour half a glassful of white wine on the bot- tom of the dish, which push into the oven, boil the whitings for twelve minutes ; when taken out, serve them on the same dish they have been cooked on. 474. Fried whitings. If the whitings are small, they may either be left whole, or theii head only removed; season them, flour them, plunge them into hot frying- fat, and drain them immediately, when they are done. If the whitings are large, they must be cut into slices, transversally ; these slices are seasoned, floured, and fried in hot frying-fat. 475. Fried tench. In order to scale tench, it is sufficient to dip them into warm vatei several times, until the scales can be disengaged by scraping them.

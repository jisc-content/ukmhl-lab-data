470 THE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-LOOK. remove the nouilles back to the side of the tire, let them simmer for ten minutes, then take them off the fire; add to them seven or eight yolks of eggs. Pour the preparation then on a buttered baking-sheet, giving it the thickness of a third of an inch ; smoothe it with the blade of a knife, push it into a slack oven. When it has taken consistence, turn it out on another baking-sheet, and bake it for ten minutes more; take it off the fire, sprinkle over powder-sugar, divide it in rounds, or else in long squares. Dish the cakes up in a circle, serve them with some wine-sabayon, {see art. 918). â€” These cakes may be meringued. 1017. Cherry-tartlets. With some sweetened short-paste {see art. 912) line a dozen tartlet- moulds ; prick the paste, mask the bottom and sides, with a layer of apricot-marmalade, or else mask it with paper, and fill the hollow with Hour; bake the tartlets in a slack oven ; when they are taken out of the oven, empty them, mask their interior with a little marmalade; then garnish them with raw cherries, moisten them with cold and very thick syrup. 1018. Apple and cream-tartlets. Butter, and line with short-paste, a dozen tartlet-moulds; till them with good apple-marmalade ; bake them in a slack oven ; let them cool, then mask them on the top with a layer of apricot-marmalade, which again mask with whipped vanilla-cream. Smoothe this cream, and pile it in a dome-like shape. 1019.

THE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-BOOK. 392 To prepare haricots with gravy, it is sufficient to pour over them a little good gravy ; thus let them simmer for a quarter of an hour, finish them, introducing into them a piece of butter. — To prepare them with cream, the gravy is replaced by Techamel’-sauce. The haricots may simply be sauted with butter; season them, and finish them with chopped parsley ; but they may also be fried with butter, and a little chopped onion, wherewith to saute the beans : this is the manner called ‘a la Lyonnaise’. 850. Kidney-beans. Kidney-beans or broad-beans, {flageolets), are fresh haricots, shelled (en grains) out of the pod; the beans are boiled in salted water, and served simply with butter, or thickened with a little white-sauce, then finished with the juice of a lemon, and a piece of butter. — Preserved kidney-beans are to be bought in the shops. 851. Boiled french-beans. If the french-beans ([haricots-verts) are fine and tender, they must be boiled rather whole than sliced, being much better thus; if they are large, then they must be shred, or sliced. — Refresh the french-beans, plunge them into salted water in a red vessel; boil them quickly, keeping them rather firm; drain them well, dish them up, serve at the same time a plate of good fresh butter. — French-beans boiled in salted water, can be served either as a garnish, or as a vegetable, with butter, or as salad. 852. Violet asparagus, butter-sauce. Cut the asparagus to equal lengths, having scalded, and scraped them; tie them together in little bundles, keep them in cold water till the moment of plunging them into boiling salted water; the asparagus must be boiled to exactly the degree, when they no longer crackle between the teeth, yet being still firm enough to remain upright, when taken by the stalks with the fingers. Drain them, range them on a folded napkin ; serve separately some butter-sauce. — These asparagus can be served, either with Dutch-sauce, or vinaigrette-sauce.

SEKVICE OF THE TABLE. XIII served cold, the plates oug'lit to be warmed. The covers ought not only to be of the utmost cleanliness, but also in sufficient number, to admit of the most frequent changes, that can be desired 5 in fact, they should be changed with every dish pre- sented. But the cares demanded .by the dining-room, should not withdraw, however, the attention of the mistress of the house, from those required by the kitchen; they should take for their starting-point this fundamental principle, that without a kitchen well arranged, judiciously supplied with furniture and requisite utensils, it is impossible either to undertake or manage any work, however unimportant. A kitchen of the middle class, where the space is almost always, more or less, too limited, may well dispense with too sumptuous an establishment; it will suffice that its arrangement, and style of furnishing, be in due proportion to the table kept, in keeping with the requirements of the house. To require culinary work to be executed in an inconvenient place, without the moderate materials befitting its results, instead of seeking the advantage of the table to be served, is wil- fully incurring difficulties without number, and of which the consequences always must be prejudicial to the service. By this brief and simple explanation, mistresses of families may form a judgment, how exacting are the rules of gastro- nomy, how much these demand, on their part, also, of prevision, forethought, and solicitude; but, in one word, it is only, on these conditions, any really good housekeeping can be main- tained.

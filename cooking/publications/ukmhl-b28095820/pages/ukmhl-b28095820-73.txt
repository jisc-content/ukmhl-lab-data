ELEMENTARY METHODS. 15 Draw. 25. The ‘hatelets’ for cold-pieces may also be constructed with jelly; they are formed in little tin-cases, of which are given here three models. These ‘hatelets’ may be adorned either with pickled tongue, udder, poultry-fillets, or even truffles. The decoration of the ‘hatelets’ must be pierced by the skewer, which then is thrust through the case; this case is maintained at its desired height by aid of a stanchion fixed to the skewer, and by a piece of raw paste, which must entirely stop up the lower aperture of the case, by which the liquid jelly would else escape, as soon as filled in. In these conditions, the hatelets are run, in an upright position, into a thick layer of pounded ice, which is pressed together, and covered with a sheet of paper. The case being cold, it is filled gradually with very clear jelly; this jelly must be liquid, but cold. As soon as the jelly has got firm, the under- stanchion is removed, as well as the paste; the case is quickly dipt into warm water, then removed,, leaving the jelly adhering to the skewer. 21. How to lard (harder) game and poultry. — Larding (larder or harder) is inexactly used for two different ways of applying (lard) fat- bacon, Avhether to fowls or birds; either method may be so applied equally to both poultry and game; such as chickens, capons, pigeons, partridges,, and pheasants. In the former method, which may properly be called bar ding, must first of all be cut a strip of bacon, rather thin than thick, which is then trimmed square, applied on the breast of the piece ot poultry or game, and fixed on with three or four turns of thread tied separately on the side. — In the chapter on poultry, will be found a drawing representing a pullet (bar del) barded.

The hopes and wishes 1 indulge for the success of this work, are naturally founded on a strong desire for the improvement of domestic cookery: I would fain see it realise that most valuable progress of becoming more prefect, without thereby growing more expensive; for it cannot be denied, that, as in most othei countries, both in England and in France, vast sums are often spent with little or no profit, which, more skilfully employed, would evidently yield results incalculably more satisfactory. It is essentially the interest, therefore, not only of house- keepers and cooks, but no less of the mistress of the house herself, to become thoroughly acquainted with as well the practice, as the theory, of a simple, yet varied, wholesome at once and pleasant, style of cookery: all are alike concerned in placing thus at their disposal, always ready to consult, a competent authority on culinary difficulties: for they ought ever to bear in mind this truth indisputable, too often lost sight of, that the right ordering of the household, and the due maintenance of a good table, yield at once a double benefit, not only securing and preserving the health of the family, but drawing closer yet its dearest ties.

In most cases, it is very difficult to fix the time requisite for a piece to be broiled on the gridiron, whether cutlet or beef-steak; as this time does not depend only on the thickness ot the meat, but also much more on the degree of heat they are exposed to. Meat, broiled on the gridiron, must be turned only once during the time of preparation. 29. How to chop meat. — Formerly meat was chopped with knives of the shape of a crescent, uncomfortable, and even dangerous, to handle. Draw. 33. Kow-a-days little chopping-machines are more generally used, of great precision, very expeditious, and altogether giving excellent results. There are machines of different construction, and very moderate price; some are spherical in shape, and turning round, others are cylindric ; all of them produce the same results, though by different combinations: a ! smah chopping-machine is not to be dispensed with in a kitchen of the middle-class. — The machine, of which a model is here given, is of English origin: it is one of the most practical that I know of; it has a double cylinder. Further on will be given the model of a spherical machine used in France.

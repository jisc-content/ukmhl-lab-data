466 THE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-BOOK. 1007. Bath-buns. Five ounces of sugar, five ounces of butter, eleven ounces of flour, two eggs, a gill and a half of milk, an ounce and a half of carbonate, a pinch of nutmeg-blossoms, preserved cedrat. Let the butter get tepid, pour it into a kitchen-basin, and work it ' with a spoon, so as to thicken it to cream; then introduce into it the eggs one by one, then the carbonate, sugar, flour, and milk, by degrees, and working the preparation with the spoon: the paste must be just of consistence to maintain itself without spreading when raised up ; take it up then with a tablespoon in equal pieces of the size of a nut; range these pieces, at a little distance from one another, on a baking-sheet, and place on each of them a little pinch of preserved cedrat, cut in small dice. Bake the buns in a slack oven, serve them cold. 1008. Portuguese-cakes. Put into a kitchen-basin half a pound of sugar and six yolks of eggs ; work the preparation with a spoon, till it be frothy ; pound foui ounces of almonds with one white of egg, pass them through a sieve, place them in a kitchen-basin, mix into them a pinch of orange-sugar, and dilute them with 4ie juice of four oranges. When the biscuit-preparation is frothy, carefully mix into it four ounces of potato-flour; and then the six whipped whites of eggs. Pour the preparation on a baking-sheet, previously buttered and covered with paper, spreading it in a layer of the thickness of an inch; bake it in a slack oven. When the biscuit has cooled, trim its upper surface, mask this side in the first place with a thin layer of apricot-marmalade, then with a layer of orange icing-sugar. Orange icing-sugar is prepared with sugar passed through a silken sieve, mixed with sugar rubbed against the peel of an orange, and then grated; this sugar is diluted, to the consistence required, with orange- juice : the preparation is of the utmost simplicity.

154 THE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-BOOK. 364. Lambs’ feet, ‘a la Villeroi’. Singe two dozen lambs’ feet, blanch them, boil them in the stock- broth ; let them half-cool in their cooking-stock, then bone them entirely, but without opening them ; fill the hollow, left by the bones, with cooked fine-herbs, thickened with a little raw force-meat; dip the feet in ‘Vil- leroi’-sauce, to range them one by one on a baking-sheet, and thus let them cool; breadcrumb them twice, fry them in plenty of hot fat, dish them in a group on a folded napkin. 365. Broiled lambs’ feet. Singe a score of lambs’ feet, remove the shaggy parts near the forking of the foot between both the hoofs ; when they are well cleansed, let them boil simply in salted water; drain them, remove only the bone of the leg, but keeping them as whole as possible ; season them, pour on a little oil or melted butter; then sprinkle over a pinch of parsley; let them cool, breadcrumb them, range them on the gridiron, and let them broil for a quarter of an hour on a very slow fire; dish them, and serve separately some cold or warm havigote’- sauce. 366. Stuffed pigs’ feet. Boil four or five well cleansed pigs’ feet with water, salt, some vege- tables, and aromatics; drain them, let them half-cool, in order to split them in two. Bone these halves then, whereupon fill the hollow with a mince of pork, seasoned to high relish, mixed with raw truffles cut in dice. Equalise the force-meat, wrap up each half-foot in a square of pig’s net; let them broil at a slow fire, for three quarters of an hour, and dish them. 367. White ‘boudins’, ‘a la soubise’. Soften half a pound of bread-crumb in cold milk; a few minutes after, press out all the moisture, pound the whole together with six ounces of calf’s udder, and as much of cooked poultry; add to this pie- paration two whole eggs, and ten yolks ; pass it through a sieve ; season it with salt and nutmeg, work it vigorously, introducing into it two gills

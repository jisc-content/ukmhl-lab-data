How to form quenelles with the spoon, and to poach them. — In order to form quenelles, there is wanted, in the first place, some very smooth force-meat; betaking one’s-self to a cool place, and taking a stewpan with very hot water, and two tablespoons: one of these spoons must remain in the water, the other is tilled with force-meat, which is rounded and smoothed on the top with the blade of a small knife. It must not be neglected, that the force-meat must rise above the level of the spoon; but the most important is, to give the quenelle a line shape, and to smoothe it well on the top. The quenelle being shaped, take the warm spoon with the left hand, slip it between the force-meat and the hollow of the other spoon, so as to disengage the quenelle at one pull: this is the operation represented by the drawing 39. This quenelle must immediately be slipt on the bottom of a slightly buttered saute-pan; in sa)7ing ‘slipt’, I mean, it is placed in the saute-pan without turning it over : the surface smoothed with the knife must always remain uppermost. For the poaching of quenelles, it is sufficient to cover them with boiling salted water, keeping the saucepan on the fire, till the moment the liquid starts to ebullition; then remove it back, cover it, and five minutes after, drain the quenelles, in order to dish them.

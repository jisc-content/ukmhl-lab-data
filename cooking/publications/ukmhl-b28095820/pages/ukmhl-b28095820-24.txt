THE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-BOOK. XIV BILLS OF FARE. The bills of fare, reproduced in this chapter, have been composed of the articles included in this book ; they are divided into two distinct series, but have not in general any very grand proportions, being applicable to dinners of only moderate numbers. The first series is calculated, if not to serve as a model in the full sense of the word, at any rate for informing mistresses of families, as to the distribution, the selection, and the number of the dishes admissible at a dinner for ten to fifteen o-uests. These bills of fare, tho’ simple and unpretending, are yet correct and varied, comprising, in addition to their own details, the dessert and the wines. The mention of the wines, that should, or may, be served with each sort of dish at a set dinner, is a novelty, which seemed useful, to remedy a sad defect, which none yet have taken care to supply. The disposition, of these first bills of fare, is so contrived, that the dishes can be either handed to the guests one after the other, or else placed on table in several distinct courses. In the second series, the bills of fare are applicable to more numerous parties of guests, and arranged on a principle different from the former : these latter are specially adapted for dinners, of which the three courses are in turn arranged symmetrically on the table: the first course includes from the fish to the ‘entrees’, neither the hot-‘hors-d’oeuvre’, nor the soups, being set on the table. The second course contains from the roasts to the ‘entre- mets’ ; the third is composed of the dessert, that is, comfits or bonbons, small biscuits, ‘petits-fours’, compotes, jellies, mar- malades, all sorts of fruit, fresh, dried, or preserved, and last of all, the cheese, and ices.

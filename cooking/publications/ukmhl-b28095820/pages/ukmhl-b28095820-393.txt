335 POULTRY. - COMPOTE-PIGEONS. On the other hand, prepare some fine-herbs (see art, 41), composed of shalots, onions, mushrooms, truffles, and some spoonfuls of cooked ham, chopped with the pigeon-livers, previously cooked; season this preparation, mix it up with the same volume of pounded fresh bacon, and a pinch of - chopped parsley. Mask the half-pigeons, on both their sides, with a layer of this preparation; fold these cutlets then up in oiled half-sheets of paper (see draw. 113, 114); range these rulfles on a gridiron, the surface of which is masked with an oiled sheet of strong paper; let them warm on hot ashes, or else at the entrance ot the oven, for twelve or fifteen minutes, but without blackening the paper ; then dish them up. 727. Pigeons with small onions. Truss three tender pigeons with their feet folded back, and intro- duced beneath the skin, by either one or the other of the methods represented by both the drawings ; put them into a stewpan with a quarter of a pound of chopped and melted bacon, let them fry for a few minutes, add to them three dozen raw small onions ; salt the pigeons and vegetables, remove the stewpan back on a more moderate fire, or to the entrance of the oven, till the pigeons are done ; untruss them now, dish them up, and surround them with the small onions. Pour into a stewpan half a glassful of broth or gravy, let the liquid boil, skim off its fat, very slightly thicken it with a little piece of kneaded- butter ; pass this sauce then, through a sieve, over the pigeons. 728. Roast saddle of young wild-boar (marcassin). If wild-boar is to be roasted, it must be a very young animal, that is tender, fat, and not more than eight or ten months old. If the meat is tender, it is indeed excellent; but if tough, it is detestable. Draw. 254.

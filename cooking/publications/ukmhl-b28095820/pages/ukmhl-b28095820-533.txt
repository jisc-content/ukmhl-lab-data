475 PASTRY. — PEAR-FLAWN, PLUM-CAKES, MERINGUES. Draw. 342. Draw. 340. Draw. 341. 1029. ‘Meringues’ with cream. ‘Meringue’-preparation is made with twelve whites of eggs, and a pound of powder-sugar. Put the whites of eggs into a copper-basin with a grain of salt, beat them up with a whip, quite gently in the beginning; augment the celerity of the motion, in proportion as the volume augments : well - whipped whites of eggs must be stiff and smooth ; then gradually add to them the sugar by the aid of a wooden spoon. Introduce a part of this preparation into a bag with funnel (see drawing 342); squeeze it through, in a round shape, on strips of paper. Sprinkle over the ‘meringues’ tine sugar, press them slightly on the centre, in order to efface the point left by the funnel. Range these strips of paper on moistened boards, and bake the ‘meringues’ in a very slack oven : they must be of a fine golden color. When they are taken out of the oven, disengage them from the paper; then, with the aid of a teaspoon, remove the soft part out of each oi the ‘meringues’, which then place on a baking-sheet, applying them on the colored part; let them dry in the well warmed hot-closet for twelve hours : a ‘meringue’ too fresh is not agreeable to taste. When the ‘meringues’ are to be served, they must be left to cool, whereupon fill them with good whipped cream sugared and scented ; then put them together by two and two {see draAving 341), dish them up, in a group, on a folded napkin. 1030.

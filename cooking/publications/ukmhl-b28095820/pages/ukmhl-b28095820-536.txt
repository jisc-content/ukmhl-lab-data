478 THE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-BOOK. Draw. 350. 1034. ‘Darioles’ with vanilla. Slightly butter eight or ten clariole-moulds, line them with fine short-paste, or trimmings of puff-paste : the paste must be thin. Place on the bottom of each mould a little bit of butter. — Break two eggs into a kitchen-basin, add to them two dariole-moulds-ful of sugar with vanilla, the same of flour, the same of dried a^mon^s? pounded with a little sugar, and passed through V a sieve ; work the preparation for two minutes, then dilute it 1IH with six dariole-moulds-ful of milk; with it, fill the moulds, which range on a baking-sheet, and keep in a slack oven for Draw. 349. . 1 half an hour ; five minutes previous to taking them out, sprinkle over sugar flavored with vanilla; let them cool, and serve them. 1035. Apple-‘chosson’. Take a pound of trimmings of puff-paste, divide it into eight or ten equal parts, which roll up to round flats of four inches’ diameter. On the other hand, mince twenty good apples, put them into a saute-pan with a piece of butter, a piece of cinnamon, and two handfuls of raw sugar, or powder-sugar; let them toss quickly, so that the apples boil without breaking them, and their moisture be reduced; then take them off the fire; remove the cinnamon, let the apples cool, and with them, garnish the flats of paste, but only to half their width, and leaving a little free space on the edges; moisten these edges with the paste-brush, then fold the flat upon itself, so as to cover the apples, forming a large ‘rissole’. Press the paste on all round, cut it, channeling it; this done, range the cakes on a baking-sheet, placing them one beside the other, and draw lines on each of these cakes, with the point of a small knife; slightly egg them, bake them in a slack oven; previous to taking them out, sprinkle over fine sugar. When the paste is dry, take them out, disengage them from the baking-sheet, and dish them up. This sweetmeat though simple, yet is very good.

THE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-BOOK. 162 382. Broiled sausages, black-puddings, and chitterlings (andouilies). In order to broil black-puddings (boudins) and sausages, they first of all must be pricked with a larding-pin, or else with the prongs ot a fork; but the chitterlings are chiseled. The chitterlings, black-puddings, and sausages, must all alike be broiled at a good fire, turning them; the one as well as the other must be set well; they are served hot, and with- out gravy; commonly they are eaten with some good mustard. 383. Fried ox-pith (amourettes). Remove the epidermis wrapping up the pith (of beef or veal), soak them for half an hour, plunge them in slightly acidulated boiling salted water; a few minutes later, take them off the fire, let them half-cool in their cooking-stock ; then drain them, cut them into regular strips, an inch and a half long, season them, dip them into 'Villeroi’-sauce, and range them, one by one, on a baking-sheet; let the sauce cool, bread- crumb them twice, fry then in hot fat, and dish them, on a folded napkin, with a bunch of fried parsley. 384. Sheep’s tails, ‘a la Villeroi’. Cut off the thin end of fifteen sheep’s tails, soak and blanch them, then range them in a stewpan, masked on the bottom with minced vege- tables, and braise them; when they are done, bone them, let them cool with a light weight on; then trim them to an equal length, dip them in 'Villeroi’-sauce ; range them, one by one, on a baking-sheet; when the sauce has cooled, breadcrumb them twice ; now plunge them into plenty of hot fat; drain them, and dish them on a folded napkin. 385. Poultry-‘crepinettes’, with truffles. Chop twelve ounces of raw chicken-meat well trimmed; mix it with the same quantity of fresh bacon, likewise chopped; highly season the preparation, chop it again for a few minutes, then add to it two or three tablespoonfuls of chopped raw truffles.

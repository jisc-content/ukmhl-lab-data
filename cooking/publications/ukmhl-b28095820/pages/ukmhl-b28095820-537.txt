479 PASTRY. - DARIOLES, FANCHONETTES, BRIOCHE-RING. 1036. ‘Fanclionettes’. Line a dozen tartlet-moulds, either with trimmings of puff-paste, or with short - paste ; till these moulds with‘frangipane’-cream, and bake them in a slack oven. When the tartlets have cooled, mask their upper surface with a layer of marmalade, then with some ‘meringue’ forming a dome ; decorate this dome also with ‘meringue’ squeezed on through a cornet (see the drawing); sprinkle over fine sugar, let it dry in a very slack oven, giving it a light color; let it cool, then decorate it with some apple- or currant-jelly. 1037. Ring in brioche. Here are the proportions of brioche - paste : a pound of flour, eight or nine ounces of butter, six whole eggs, half an ounce of yeast, a pinch of salt, and two pinches of sugar. Draw. 352. Dilute the yeast with half a glassful of tepid water ; with this liquid, and half of the flour, prepare a rather stiff dough, which place in a stewpan, the bottom of which is moistened with a little tepid water; cover it, let the dough rise in the hot-closet. On the other hand, gather the flour on the table in a heap, form a hollow in its centre, and in it place the salt, the sugar, two spoonfuls of water, the butter, and three whole eggs; prepare the paste, intro- ducing into it gradually the butter, the eggs, and the flour; work it vigorously with the hands for twelve minutes, by degrees introducing into it the remainder of the eggs : the paste must be soft and smooth.

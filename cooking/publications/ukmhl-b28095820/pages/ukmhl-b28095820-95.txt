37 ELEMENTARY METHODS. — PACKING ICE-BOXES. G3. How to pack up (frupper) ice-boxes (sorbetieres). — There .ire two sorts ot ice-boxes, long ones, and others of round shape, or hemispherical. The former are in tin, the latter in tinned copper. For packing up the ice-box, it must be disposed in a bucket of con- venient size, leaving space enough between the box and the wood. If a ong tin ice-box is to be packed ujj, the bottom of which is not provided Draw. 49. Draw. 50.

This ice must be copiously sprinkled with ounded sea-salt; when the ice-box is placed on the ice, it must be sur- ounded by ice well pounded, drained, and salted (ten pounds of ice squire three pounds of salt) ; arranging the ice in layers pressed quite lose. But although the ice is salted previously, yet each layer must be prinkled with salt, this being (it must not be forgotten), the chief auxiliary to the congelation : the ice alone, without the salt, may cool the weetened liquid, but can never, alone, bring it to congelation. I he drawings’' joined to this article represent, firstly (49) the ice-box i its bucket, resting on a pivot, and surrounded with ice; in the second lace, (50) a pallet for taking up the ice, which may be in wood, or ictal, but in any case perforated, so that the water contained by the ice an be drained. The third drawing (51) represents a pestle for com-

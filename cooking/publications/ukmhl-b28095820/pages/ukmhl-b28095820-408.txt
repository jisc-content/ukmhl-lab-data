350 THE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-BOOK. Roll out twelve or fifteen ounces of short-paste (see art. 55, 57) to the shape of a long square ; mask it on its centre with a thick layer of force- meat ; and upon this layer, place then the remainder of the fillets and bacon ; mask all this with a layer of force-meat; fold the edges of the paste over the meat; moisten, and cover it with a thin strip of the same paste, upon which place again a strip of puff-paste; into this strip of puff-paste, manage to make three small apertures, which place at a little distance from one another; then egg, and rule it with the aid of a small knife.

Prepare some panada with softened bread-crumb pressed out; add to it one chopped onion, and a pinch of chopped parsley; season the stuffing with salt and pepper, add to it a whole egg, and with this, fill the body of the duck ; truss it, wrap it up in a sheet of oiled paper, let

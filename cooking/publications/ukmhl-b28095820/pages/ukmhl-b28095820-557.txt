499 BEVERAGES. - GRANITE, PUNCH, ICED-CHAMPAGNE. 1084. Iced-champagne. I have observed long since, that champagne is but rarely served in the condition requisite. This is the motive, that has determined me to introduce this subject into this book, in order to correct an error, the first result of which is, to prejudice an appreciated and excellent product. Champagne must always be served iced, never otherwise; it may be iced to different degrees, this being a matter of taste, but the essential thing is that it be iced to some degree. In order to pack, or ice the champagne, the bottles must be placed in a bucket or pail, the bottom of which is masked with a layer of pounded and salted ice, up to three- fourths of its height; the proportion of salt to ice is one fourth ; that is, four pounds of ice require one pound of crushed kitchen-salt. The time necessary to ice the wine is, forty minutes. In these conditions the champagne is penetrated by the cold without being con- gealed ; these are the conditions, in which it should be taken. The Russians, in general, drink their champagne iced, to the degree when all the aqueous parts of the wine are congealed: this proceeding necessarily augments the strength of the liquid, yet is far from rendering it better ; it is a refinement, better left to the whims of the fanciful; as wine iced to excess, can be no longer either agreeable, or wholesome. The thing to be sought after, is a cold, but not excessive temperature. If the wine is iced to the simple degree without congealing it, the bottles may remain corked up in the bucket: in the contrary case, if the wine is to be partly congealed, the bottles must be uncorked ten minutes after being brought on ice. In order to congeal the wine, it is sufficient to augment the quantity of salt, and to pack it longer. 32*

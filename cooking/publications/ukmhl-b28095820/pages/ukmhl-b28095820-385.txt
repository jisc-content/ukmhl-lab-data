POULTRY. — STUDDED FAT-LIVER. 327 There may also be added to the stew raw and cut potatoes ; in this case they must be added, when the other vegetables are nearly done. Twelve minutes previous to serving, let the goose-livers fry m a pan with butter; season them, divide, and mix them up with the stew; which dish up, having removed the bunch. 711. Studded fat-iiver. Choose a tine fat-liver, kept whole ; stud both its parts with a line of raw truffles, cut in fillets, which are square on one end, and pointed at the other. Season the liver, mask it with strips of bacon, then wrap it up in a sheet of buttered paper, setting it on the trimmings of the truffles ; place it on a baking-sheet with upturned rim, moisten it with butter, let it bake 'in a slack oven for thirty-five or forty minutes, repeat- edly moistening the paper. — At serving-time, unwrap the liver, dish it up, surround it with a garnish composed of ‘quenelles, mushrooms, truffles, etc: two species of garnish will do. Mask the bottom of the dish with a little brown-sauce, reduced with wine; send up the remainder in a sauceboat; the garnishes mentioned may be replaced by Perigueux- sauce ; if this be the case, the sauce is poured round the fat-liver. 712. Scollops of fat-liver, to the minute. Take'a good goose fat-liver; separate the two parts, divide them in slices of the same thickness and dimension ; slightly beat them, regularly trim them, season and flour them; range them in a flat stewpan, the bottom of which is masked with clarified butter kept very warm ; fry the scollops on a brisk fire, turning them; drain, and dish them up in a circle; mask them with a little good brown-sauce, and serve them.

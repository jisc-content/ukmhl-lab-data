401 VEGETABLES. — ENDIVE, CHESTNUTS. 876. Endive with eggs. Choose seven or eight heads of succo ry (clucoree), or endive, nicely white and fresh ; cut them up, wash them quickly, changing the water several times, plunge them into boiling salted water; boil the endive for twenty minutes, drain it on a colander, let it cool, press the water out, and chop it. Melt in a stewpan a piece of butter, add to it a tablespoonful of flour, which let fry for a few moments ; add to this the endive, stir it on the fire, until it has quite dried off; season it, gradually moisten it with good milk, but keeping it consistent; at the first bubbling up, remove it back to the side of the fire, ooil it thus for ten minutes, then put it back on the fire, let it reduce quickly, but without leaving it, and gradually introduce into it a third of a glassful of good raw cream ; as soon as it has got creamy and relishing, take it off the fire ; add to it a pinch of sugar and nutmeg, introduce into it a piece of butter, and dish it up; sunound it with halves of eggs boiled hard, placing them in an upright position : form a rosette on the centre. — Endive prepared thus may be served as an entree-garnish. 877. Roasted chestnuts. Choose the chestnuts large, split their skin on one side only ; place them m a pan with perforated bottom, let them roast at a moderate fire, and if possible on wood-charcoal; as soon as they are done to the degree requisite, wrap them up in a cloth, and thus keep them for ten or twelve minutes, then dish them up under the folds of a napkin, and serve them with blitter. 26

THE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-BOOK. 496 Alter this same method may be prepared, ‘sorbets’ with kirsch, with kiimmel, with madeira, with malaga, etc. 1075. Pine-apple ‘sorbet’. Proportions : a pint of pine-apple-syrup at thirty-two degrees, the juice of four oranges and one lemon, a little zest, and two gills of champagne. Prepare some pine-apple-ice, giving eighteen degrees at the syrup- scale ; when it is smooth and firm, gradually add to it the champagne, mixed with a little syrup ; ten minutes after, serve the ‘sorbet’. 1076. Marascliino-spongade. Spongade (spongata) is a preparation of Italian origin. It is a confection made indifferently with either cream or fruit. Its perfect lightness depends especially on its management: ‘spongade’ is served in glasses, as iced punch. Proportions : a quart of double cream, one gill of whites of eggs, ten ounces of sugar, two gills of maraschino. Let the sugar melt with the cold cream, add to it the whites of eggs not whipped, and the maraschino ; then pass the preparation through a sieve twice, then pour it into the ice-box, which turn on the ice for a few minutes, kept covered; then uncover it, and turn it, with the left hand slipping the spattle between the sides and the bottom, in order to disengage the adhering parts; but immediately, when the preparation begins to thicken, leave off turning the ice-box with the hand, managing this movement with the spattle, applying it firmly against the side, on one side only going down to the very bottom. The effect of the spattle suffices to let the ice-box turn; but the spattle must act on the mass from the top to the bottom, and when taken up must lift the lid in such a manner, as to let it absorb as much air as possible. When the cream has augmented to double its volume, is smooth and light, then introduce into it the maraschino mixed up with a little syrup ; introduce it, by degrees only without leaving off the work ; then serve the ‘spongade’ in ice-glasses.

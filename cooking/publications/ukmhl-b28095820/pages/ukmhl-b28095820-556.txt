THE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-BOOK. 498 1080. Orgeat-granite. Take a few gills of almond-milk, sweeten it with sugar, or syrup, at thirty-two degrees, flavored with vanilla, so as to give the liquid fourteen or fifteen degrees at the syrup-scale; let it freeze, proceeding as said above. 1081. Iced coffee, with cream. Prepare some good coffee with water ; let it cool, mix it up with the same volume of cold cream; sweeten the preparation a little more than to make it liquid ; pour it into a packed ice-box, but with only half the usual quantity of ice; cover it, and keep it thus for ten minutes ; then disengage the parts adhering to the sides, cover the ice-box again ; after the lapse of twenty minutes, begin the operation again, shut the ice-box; twenty minutes after, slightly work the preparation, and pour it into cups or glasses : it must be slightly thickened, without being compact. 1082. Iced punch with fruits. Proportions: a quart of syrup of apples, pears, and currants, mixed together in equal parts, the juice of four oranges, a bit of zest, half a gill of vanilla-syrup, half a gill of rum, half a gill of kirsch, and five whites of Italian ‘meringue’, that is, prepared with warm syrup. Compose an ice-preparation, with the fruit-syrups, the juice of oranges, and the zest; give it twenty degrees at the syrup-scale; pass it through a sieve, let it freeze. When the ice has set, add to it the ‘meringue’; work it with the spattle for ten minutes ; then introduce into it, gradually, the liqueurs mixed with a little syrup. — This punch must be served, as soon as possible, when finished. 1083.

Work up together, in a kitchen-basin, half a pound of powder-sugar with ten or twelve yolks of eggs ; when the preparation is become quite frothy, add four ounces of black-bread crumb, grated, dried, and then pounded ; add likewise four ounces of dried ana ground almonds, a pinch of powder-cinnamon, and cloves in powder, a little scraped choco- late, and lastly, eight or nine whipped whites of eggs. Spread out, on a baking-sheet, a flat of sweetened short-paste, of square form ; on this paste, spread out the biscuit-preparation, giving it about the thickness of an inch ; sprinkle it with a little sugar, bake it in a slack oven ; when it is cool again, mask it on the top with chocolate- icing-sugar; immediately cut up the flat into cakes having the form of a long square. 1004. ‘Porte-manteaux’.

Range these cakes at a little distance from one another on a baking- sheet, egg them, bake them in a hot oven; a few minutes previous to taking them out, sprinkle over sugar, in order to glaze them to a nice color ; serve them cold. 1005.

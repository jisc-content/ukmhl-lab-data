447 SWEET-ENTREMETS. — JELLIES. their perfume is, the fewer are required. — If the flowers prove too little perfumed, their qualities may be supplied by adding to the preparation a few drops of extract distilled from these flowers. 967. Peacli-tartlets with rice. Line a dozen tartlet-moulds with fine short-paste; fill the hollow of the tartlets with a layer of rice with cream, perfumed, and thus bake them in the oven ; when they are taken out, finish filling them with the same rice, finished with cream ; then set on the top of each of them half a peach cooked for compote ; immediately coat them with their own syrup reduced, and set on each of them half a peach-kernel. Dish the tartlets up on a napkin. 968. Raspberry-jelly. Prepare a gelatinous composition with fifteen ‘gelatine’- leaves, proceeding, as said, art. 964. Bray a few handfuls of very fresh raspberries, ripe to the degree requisite ; add to them a small handful of powder-sugar, pour them on a sieve in order to extract their juice; add to this juice that of an orange, filter it through (see art. 73); when it is limpid, mix it up with the gelatinous preparation, being clear, cold, and liquid; pour then this preparation into a crystal vessel, let it set on ice, for one hour at least, then serve it. — This method of serving jellies may be less attractive, than the preceding ones, but it gives better results ; as good jelly must not be so much limed, as to become too gelatinous. 969. Whipped jelly, with fruits. Place in a kitchen-basin a large ‘salpicon’ of preserved fruit: pine- apple, greengages, apricots ; add to it some preserved cherries whole; moisten the fruits with a little kirsch. Prepare about a quart of jelly (see art. 964) limed a third less than is generally done; when it is strained, pour it into a little copper-basin; then set the vessel on ice, gently stir the liquid with a whip ; add to it Draw. 320.

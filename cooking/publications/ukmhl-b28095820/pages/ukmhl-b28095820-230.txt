THE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-BOOK. 172 chopped mushrooms, and a little parsley likewise chopped. ~S\ ith this preparation, mask the surface of the turbot, sprinkle over dry bread- crumb of a yellow color, pour on a little melted butter; push the dish into a brisk oven, so as to gratinate the fish on the upper surface ; take it out, and serve immediately. 407.

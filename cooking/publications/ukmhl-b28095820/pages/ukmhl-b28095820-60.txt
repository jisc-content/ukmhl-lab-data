2 THE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-BOOK. so that it may be turned round or over in the direction most convenient. The tools indispensable for such carving are: a solid fork with two prongs, a large good knife with tine well-sharpened blade, and lastly carving - scissors. * This last instrument is of great utility. By means of these facilities, the task of carving at table is singularly simplified. As for the manner of proceeding, it depends naturally on the nature of the pieces. The essential thing, in this operation, is to know exactly the inward construction of the pieces one has to deal with, to take hold of them in their most practical direction, and lastly to distinguish nicely the most per- fect pieces, and to carve them without damaging their appetising appearance, or their gastronomic qualities: there lies the rock-a- head. This however is a plain and simple study, but a study not to be neglected; for it must embarrass the carver, and put him out entirely; if, in the course of. operation, lie is puzzled, if lie cannot find the exact point, where the joints may be divided, or if he cuts the meat in an opposite direction. Intending to facilitate this study, some descriptions will be given, as well as the drawing of those pieces, which are generally carved at table. * The carving-scissors are a great resource for those who know how to use them skil- fully. With this assistance, not only is each part divided without effort, but all are divided properly. The drawing herewith given represents an instrument of French invention, serving the combined purpose both of carving-knife, and scissors.

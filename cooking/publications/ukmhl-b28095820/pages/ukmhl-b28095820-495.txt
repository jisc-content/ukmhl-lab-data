SWEET-ENTREMETS. — CAKES. 437 plunge the cut paste into hot frying-fat, and let it fry to a nice color; when the cakes are taken out, and well drained, pour over them a few drops of orange flower-water, sprinkle over powder-sugar, and serve them. 948. ‘Nouilles’-cake, with fruits. Butter a plain border-mould, sprinkle over its sides minced raw hiouilles’; then line it entirely with fine and thin short-paste. Plunge into milk in ebullition six ounces of minced biouilles’; three or four minutes after, drain them on a sieve, put them back again into the stewpan; sweeten them, pour over them two tablespoonfuls of cream; cover them till all their moisture be absorbed ; then let them cool, intro- duce into them two whole eggs, a piece of butter, and a little grated zest. With this preparation fill the hollow of the border-mould, which push into the oven, and bake for thirty-five or forty minutes ; when it is taken out, turn it over on a dish, fill the central hollow with cut preserved fruits, on which place a group of preserved cherries. Mask the border with a little light apricot-sauce; place on the top, all round the cherries, a circle of fine greengages in compote. 949. Melting-cake, with sabayon. Let half-melt five ounces of butter; when done, pour it into a kitchen-basin, and work it well with a wooden spoon, till it is frothy; then introduce into it three yolks of eggs, one by one, and one whole egg, then five ounces of sugar, a part of which is perfumed with lemon;

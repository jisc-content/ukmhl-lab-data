Salmis of young duck. Roast a young duck in a stewpan, with butter, without any other moisture ; keep the liver by.

Put the trimmings into the stewpan, wherein the young duck has been fried, add to it two glassfuls of red claret, a bunch of aromatics, some mushroom-trimmings ; cover the stewpan, set it on a brisk fire ; five or six minutes after, pass the liquid through a sieve, skim off its fat, thicken it with a little kneaded-butter or brown-sauce ; pass this sauce, through a sieve, over the pieces of the young duck, and keep them warm.

In order to prepare ‘cannelons’, one must have little wooden columns very slightly pointed, three inches long, of half an inch diameter on the thick end. There may also be employed leaden tubes in the manner of the tubes of the column-box. — Roll out thin twelve ounces of puff-paste, giving the flat a long shape ; out of this paste cut some strips half an-inch by six: mind, cutting them pointed on one end. Take ten of the tubes or columns, butter them, then surround them in a spiral Draw.no. way with a strip of paste, beginning with the smallest end, that is to say, forming with the paste circles ‘a cheval’, one upon the other: the paste must be but little floured, so that the circles may stick together. End the spiral at an inch from the thick end of the column, slightly moisten- ing the paste.

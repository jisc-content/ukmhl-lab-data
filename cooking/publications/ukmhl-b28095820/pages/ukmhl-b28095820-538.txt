As soon as the paste has got firm, gather it to a ball on the floured table, place it on a baking-sheet, then flatten it, and pierce its centre through with the hands, so as to form a circle, as regular as possible, by spreading the paste (see draw. 352). With this quantity of paste two circles may be obtained, or even three. Let the paste rest for ten minutes, egg it, bake it in a hot oven for twenty-five or thirty minutes; when it is cold, dish it up on a folded napkin. 1038. Finger-biscuits.

241 MUTTON. - NECK; SHEEP’S-TONGUES. 549. Larded neck of mutton. Choose a large neck of mutton, remove then the chine-bone, cut the sides straight, and shorter than commonly is done, then trim close the meat of the fillets, removing the fat covering them, but without baring the ribs (see the drawing 178); lard this fillet with fine bacon, on all its length ; wrap the meat up in a sheet of oiled paper, fix it to the spit with the aid of a skewer, let it roast, basting it with butter; three quarters of an hour after, unwrap it, in order to give it a nice color; take it off the spit, salt it, dish it, and serve it with good gravy, and potato-puree. — In the same way may be served a neck of veal. Draw. 178. 550. Sheep’s tongues, with onions. Let braise ten fresh mutton-tongues, proceeding, as indicated in the art. 551 ; keep them warm. — On the other hand, mince five or six fine white onions, let them fry with butter to a nice color 5 add to them a little sugar ; sprinkle over a pinch of flour, moisten them with a little good warm milk 5 boil the stew for seven or eight minutes, stirring it; at last, thicken it with two yolks of eggs, diluted with cream ; at this degree, it should prove of a nice consistence, like that of a puree. Put the stew on the centre of a warm dish, and range the tongues all round. 551. Sheep’s-tongues, in ruffles. Blanch five or six fresh sheep’s tongues ; range them side by side in a flat stewpan, previously spread with some trimmings of ham, and with minced vegetables; then moisten them to cover with white wine and broth, let them braise on a very slow fire. An hour and a half after, drain the tongues, remove their skin; let them glaze, and finish cooking them; let them cool in their own cooking-stock, then split them by the middle on their side, in such a manner as to take the form of a heart. 16

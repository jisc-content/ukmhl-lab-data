Glazed orange-cream. Pour into a little copper-basin a glassful of cold syrup, perfumed with orange ; mix into it five or six dissolved leaves of gelatine, as well as the juice of two oranges ; stir the liquid on ice, until it begins to thicken; then introduce into it three glassfuls of whipped cream ; the mixture operated, pour the preparation into a dome-mould, placed in a bucket, and surrounded with pounded and salted ice ; close the mould, first with a sheet of paper, then with its lid, covering it also with ice, and thus keep it for forty minutes.

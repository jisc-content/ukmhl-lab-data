Bake these ‘profi- teroles in a slack oven, keeping them rather dry5 when they have cooled, open them on the top, and garnish them with some ‘frangipane’-cream {see art. 892), flavored with lemon-zest and almonds. Mask the bottom of a dish with a layer of ‘frangipane’, on which then place the ‘profiteroles’, applying them in a pyramid; keep them in the hot-closet. Prepare two. gills of liquid chocolate, but keeping it firmer, than commonly is done, as it is meant to coat the ‘profiteroles’; pour it over them, and serve. 923. Apple-custard with vanilla. Prepare two gills of apple-marmalade, flavored with vanilla, passed through a tammy.

The preparation being frothy, add to it a few spoonfuls of sugar; introduce into it the apple-puree, then twelve ounces of macaroons. Pour this preparation into a buttered and floured mould, let it poach at the ‘bain-marie’. When about to serve, turn the custard out on a warm dish, mask it with almond-milk syrup, thickened with a little apricot-marmalade. 924. Apple-souffle. Prepare with good apples the value of a gill and a half of marma- lade, not too sweet, and flavored either with zest or cinnamon; let it slightly reduce, withdraw it from the fire, and incorporate with it six or seven Avhites of eggs, whipped, and sugared ; pour the preparation into a buttered ‘souffle’- pan; smoothe it on the top with the blade of a knife, and bake it in a slack oven. 925. Apple-chariot. Butter a chariot-mould, mask the bottom with a rosette of slices of household-bread, cut round on one side, and to a point on the other; but previous to ranging these slices in the mould, they must be dipped with one side into tepid melted butter. This done, cut some slices of bread

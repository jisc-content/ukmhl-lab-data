THE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-BOOK. 14 ‘Hatelets’, for entrees or removes, are composed of truffles, cocks’-combs, mushrooms, quenelles, crayfish, or prawns, according to the nature of the pieces, to which they are applied. The materials, chosen for this purpose, must be selected for nicety of shape, and appetising quali- ties; especially they must yield an effect pleasing to the eye, by their shades of color when com- bined in forming a total: the cocks’- combs and mushrooms must be of a very clear white, the truffles very black and round. ‘Hatelets’ are mounted on silver- or Ruolz- skewers, adorned with any little subject or device on their upper extremity. 19. How to singe (flambcr) poultry and game. — Poultry and feathered game is singed in order to burn any vestige of feathers, and to remove from the skin the tips of quills that cannot be disengaged with the hands.

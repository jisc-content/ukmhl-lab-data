Then equalise it with the blade of the knife, and cut it in a horizontal direction, so as to form square strips of equal thickness.

The larding- needle must be inserted in the meat slanting from right to left, and not straight down ; that is, the lines of larding must be arranged in regard to the look, in such a manner, that the eye can embrace their total; to be still more precise, I will say, that the meat (with respect to the person who is larding) must be placed exactly in the same direction, as it is represented by the drawing 37.

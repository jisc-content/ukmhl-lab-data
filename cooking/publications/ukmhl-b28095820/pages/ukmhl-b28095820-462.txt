THE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-BOOK. 404 883. Minced cabbage. Cut up in quarters, one or two white cabbages; remove the hard stems; mince the tender leaves, wash them, and drain them well. — Mince an onion, which let fry with butter; when it is of a nice color, add to it the minced cabbage, pour over it a glassful of vinegar, and a little broth; season them, let them boil thus, quite gently, for three hours. Last of all, the moisture must be reduced; thicken the cabbage, then, with a piece of kneaded-butter, and add to it a pinch of powder-sugar; ten minutes after, dish it up. 884. Sour-crout.

The cask being almost full, mask the minced vegetable with large whole leaves of cabbage, over which also sprinkle salt, then mask them with a * Fifty heads of cabbage will require two or three pounds of salt.

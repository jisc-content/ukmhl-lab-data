160 THE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-BOOK. 377. Small chickens, ‘a la marinade’. Truss two small chickens, plunge them into the broth of the stock- pot, let them boil for twenty minutes ; drain, and let them cool; then cut each of them into five pieces; remove their skin and bones, as much as possible; place the pieces of poultry in a kitchen-basin, then season, and moisten them with the juice of two lemons ; ten minutes previous to serving, take the pieces, one by one, dip them into frying-paste, and plunge them into hot frying-fat; when the paste is dry, drain, and dish them up on a folded napkin. 378. Chickens, ‘a la Villeroi’. Draw two middling-sized chickens, truss them, let them boil in the stock-pot, or in a stewpan with broth; keep them under-done ; drain them, let them nearly cool, divide each of them in five pieces; remove their skin and bones, as much as possible ; season them, dip them into some 1 Villeroi ’-sauce, prepared at the moment, so as entirely to mask them with a rather thick layer, and range the pieces of poultry on a baking - sheet; let the sauce cool well. Now disengage the pieces ot poultry, roll them in bread-crumb, dip them into beaten eggs, drain them, and breadcrumb again. At serving-time, plunge them in hot frying-fat, taking but little at a time, let them quickly take color, drain them, dish them up, in a group, on a folded napkin. 379. Lamb-cutlets, ‘a la Villeroi’. Cut eighteen lamb-cutlets, trim them, fry them with butter in a saute-pan; when they are done, let them cool with alight weight on, trim the cutlets again, mask them with Villeroi-sauce, finished with a few tablespoonfuls of cooked fine-herbs ; immediately range them one by one on a baking-sheet; let the sauce cool, and breadcrumb the cutlets twice, then plunge them into hot fat; when they ha\e taken a nice coloi, drain them, in order to dish them on a napkin, with a bunch of filed parsley.

COMPOTES: PEACH, APRICOT, PEAR, APPLE, CHERRY, PLUM, &c. 505 1101. Compote of rennet-apples. Cut six rennet-apples, dividing each of them in two ; remove the cores with the aid of a vegetable-scooper, peel them, rub them with half a lemon ; this done, plunge them into cold water. Boil some water, with a pinch of sugar, and the juice of a lemon; plunge the apples into the liquid, and remove the stewpan back to the side of the fire, so as to cook the apples without letting the water boil fast: for certain qualities of apples, the water ought not even to boil. As soon as the apples are done, drain, and range them in a kitchen- basin ; immediately cover them with syrup at twenty degrees ; add to them a little zest. One hour after, dish the apples in a circle ; add a little sugar to the syrup, reduce it to twenty-eight degrees, let it cool, and pour it on the apples. 1102. Compote of cherries. Pluck the stalks off a few dozen sour cherries. — Put into a sugar- pan half a pound of sugar, and a little water ; let it boil till very thick (36 degrees), then add to it the cherries, which boil on a brisk fire for two minutes only; immediately pour the compote into a kitchen-basin, and let it cool; then drain off the syrup, take a part of it, add to it a little sugar, and let it reduce, until it be again of a good consistence (30 degrees) ; then pour it on the cherries ; when cold, dish the compote. 1103. Compote of black-plums. * Peel raw, two dozen plums, without stoning them ; plunge them into boiling water, boil them for two minutes, then drain, and range them in a kitchen-basin ; sprinkle over them powder-sugar, an hour after dish the compote. 1104. Compote of ‘mirabelles’, (yellow or egg-plums).

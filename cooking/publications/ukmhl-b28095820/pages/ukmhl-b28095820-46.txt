XXXVI THE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-BOOK. The hot-closet iixed beside the stove into the thickness of the wall, is heated by the pipe of the tire-place. The hot-closet, of which the design is given at p. 121, is portable, and is intended to be placed in some room next adjoining to the dining- room, in order to keep the dishes hot, while waiting to be served. This hot-closet is constructed of tin, and heated with hot-water by the aid of either a spirit-lamp, or a small jet of gas. These hot-closets may also be heated without the aid of the water, simply by spirits of wine, or gas; but this kind of heat, which is too strong for the grating nearest to the dame, is always injurious and dangerous to the dishes, as well as for the viands they contain; the heating with water, is therefore, on all accounts, preferable. The main receptacle for water in the hot-closet, is below, near the bottom: the upper part contains another smaller reser- voir. The water is indltcred from above into the reservoirs : to one of the sides is attached a cock, serving to let this water out, as soon as the use of it is ended.

341 GAME. — ROEBUCK, HARE. 740. Roast haunch of roebuck. Saw off the end of the hone of a leg of roebuck, round it on the opposite extremity, having removed the bone of the ‘quasi’; then remove the sinewy skin on the side opposite to the cushion, and let the meat macerate, for rive or six hours at most, in a cooked marinade (see art. 44) ; then drain, and lard it with bacon, either transversally or length- wise. — If the haunch is to be roasted on the spit, pierce it through with an iron-skewer, which fix to the spit at both extremities. If it is baked in the oven, place it in a baking-sheet, moisten it with butter, and let it roast, from forty-five to sixty minutes, according to its size. A roast haunch of roebuck may be served with currant-jelly, poivrade-sauce or light piquant-sauce : the knuckle-bone of the leg must be trimmed and decorated with a ruffle. 741. Hare-boudins, with olives. Prepare a ‘quenelle’ force-meat with a fillet of raw hare, and the heart and liver cooked ; when it is finished, divide it into equal parts of the size ot an egg; put these parts on the floured table, roll them with the hand to the shape of corkscrews, flatten them with the blade of the knife, in order to give them an oblong shape : a dozen of them is requi- site. Let these ‘boudins’ then poach in salted water, drain, and let them cool; dip them into beaten eggs, and breadcrumb them; let them fry 'with butter, in a flat stewpan ; dish them up in a circle; pour into the centre some olive-garnish.

PUBLICATIONS OP THE AUTHOR. LONGMANS, GREEN, AND COMPANY, PUBLISHERS. I. ARTISTIC COOKERY : — a large and splendid volume in quarto, with eighty separate copper-plate engravings: — price of the volume bound, two guineas. This book is manifestly stamped with the character of an important work, more considerable than any of those published hitherto on cookeiy ; by its elegance and luxury of style, it has its appropriate place in the libraries of the nobility. Accomplished hosts, experienced cooks, even mistresses of families, may equally derive instruction from its manifold resources ; representing, as it does, within its comprehensive range, all branches of the culinary art, with a copiousness unprecedented, and with incontestable precision. It is, in fact, the first work of the kind, which, while taking its own stand on the most elevated point of view, has nevertheless in some degree succeeded in making culinary science popular, while rendering it more intelligible, and easier of practical execution, by methodical descriptions, all of which are thoroughly sustained and proved by illustrations of the most perfect exactitude: this is a merit that admits of easy verification.

Fricandeau of veal, glazed. What is called a fricandeau, is simply a cushion of veal, trimmed , chopped down the middle, without entirely separating the two parts, then beaten Hat with the chopper, and larded on one surface in the style represented by the drawing 194. The cooking of a fricandeau is the same is that of a cushion of veal braised; it must be cooked short of moisture ; when it is thoroughly done, the meat should be glazed to a nice color on the larded side ; and the cooking-stock succulent. A ‘fricandeau’ glazed, may be served either with a tomata-sauce or a chestnut-puree, with sorrel or with spinach ; the gravy must be rid of its fat, passed and served separately. 592.

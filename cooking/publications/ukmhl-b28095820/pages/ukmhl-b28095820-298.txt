240 THE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-BOOK. Here is a more simple method: put into a small frying-pan two tablespoonfuls of chopped onion, and a piece ot butter; let it Iry on a moderate fire; add to it the minced kidneys; season them, let them fry on a brisk fire; when they have set, remove them with a skimmer, and put them into a plate ; mix a little wine to the liquid, let it reduce to halt; then add to it a few spoonfuls of good melted glaze; let the liquid boil, thicken it with a small piece of kneaded - butter; add to the sauce the kidneys, a small pepper, and a little chopped parsley; warm them without any ebullition, and serve. — To this stew may be always added some cut fresh mushrooms. 547. Sheep’s tongues, ‘a la soubise’. Blanch and braise, short of moisture, eight sheep’s tongues. Drain them, remove the skin, and trim them; place them in a saute-pan, with the cooking-stock, reduced to half-glaze, gently warm them at the entrance of the oven, and glaze them. — When about to serve, dish them in a circle, slightly mask them with their own stock, and fill the central hollow with a onion-puree (see art. 87). 548. Sheep’s tongues, with turnips. Soak in cold water eight fresh sheep’s tongues, drain, scald, and scrape them. Melt in a stewpan three ounces of chopped bacon, add to it the tongues ; season, and fry till of a nice color; sprinkle over a handful of flour, moisten with a sufficient quantity of white wine, and hot broth, to cover them ; then add a garnished bunch, and let it boil over a slow fire. A quarter of an hour after, add to it a garnish ot turnips ; whole, if they are small, but if large, in balls or quarters ; let them be previously blanched, color them in a frying-pan with lard, then season with salt, pepper, and a pinch of sugar. Draw the stewpan on a moderate fire, and continue boiling: tongues, and turnips, should be done at the same time. Dish up the tongues in a circle, and fill the centre with the garnish of turnips.

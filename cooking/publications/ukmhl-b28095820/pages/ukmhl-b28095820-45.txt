STOVE AND HOT-CLOSET. At p. 103, the model has been represented of a middle-class kitchen- stove (journeau), that is, a stove, neither very bulky, nor very costly, but extremely convenient: it is of iron, furnished with a boiler for hot- water, a hot-closet (etuve), and an oven ; it has only one fire-place, which may be fed either with coal, or wood; but outside the firo- place, it is furnished with an open charcoal-grating, a very great assistance in cooking. This is, therefore, take it altogether, as complete a stove as one could wish for ; but the most valuable point in its construction evidently is the way in which the fire of the fire-place is made available for roast- ing purposes; this combination is truly practical, and well deserves the best attention, both of all employed in cooking, and of mistresses of houses; for if the setting-up a spit is of itself a good step in advance, how much greater is its use, when the only question is, to make it work without the least expense, simply by utilising the fire of the fire-place itself. The roasting is effected by the aid' of a small inexpensive portable turnspit; the fire of the fire-place is laid bare, by simply letting down the plate of iron masking it, this plate being maintained in a horizontal position, by the aid of two movable iron-feet, which are fitted on to it; the fire-guard or screen is also of iron, but it can only be placed in the condition here found represented, after the plate has been let down. Attached to this stove is a broiling - machine, to my thinking the nost perfect possible, and to which I would always give the preference.

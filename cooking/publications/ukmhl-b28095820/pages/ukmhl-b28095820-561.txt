RASPBERRY-DRINK, APPLE-, AND CURRANT-JELLY. 503 a few drops of liquid carmin. A few minutes after, take the jelly with a deep spoon, and with it, fill the glasses, previously warmed, in the hot- closet. Range these glasses on a baking-sheet, keep them in the tem- perature of the kitchen, for twenty-four hours, then cover them down. In order to cover the glasses, firstly on the jelly must be laid a round of paper, cut of the dimension of the aperture, and clipped into brandy. Cut then some rounds of paper, larger than the jelly- glasses ; moisten the rim of each glass with dissolved gum, apply the paper to it, pressing it down. When the gum has well dried, cut the paper at a level with the rim of the vessel. Jellies in general must be kept in a dry place, well sheltered from all humidity. 1095. Currant-jelly in large jars. Choose the currants red, but not over-ripe ; remove the berries from the stalks ; weigh them, put them into an untinned copper-basin ; mix into them two pounds of sugar, to each pound of fruit; let the sugar and the fruits macerate for one hour, stirring them from time to time; set the basin on a fire, give the liquid four or five minutesâ€™ ebullition, and pour it, together with the fruit, on a sieve, placed over a kitchen-basin. The jelly passes limpid, and is set, as soon as it has cooled. 1096. Orangeade with wine. Grate on sugar the zest of two oranges, rasp this sugar with a knife, then put it into a china-bowl, add the juice of four oranges, half a pint of syrup, being cold and rather concentrated, and half a bottle of white- wine. Pass the liquid through a cloth, let it thoroughly cool.

THE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-BOOK. 382 A few minutes before serving, plunge the ‘ravioles’ into boiling water, salted ; boil them for two minutes; then remove the stew pan to the side, keep it thus for four or five minutes, then drain the havioles’ with a skimmer, and range them, one by one, in layers, in a deep dish, sprinkling each layer with scraped parmcsan, moisten them with a little good gravy, thickened with tomata-sauce, moisten them also with a little brown-butter (‘a la noisette’), and serve them immediately. 822. Rice-quisclie. Prepare a flat of short-paste (with a pound of flour, five ounces of butter, and two yolks) ; with this flat, line an iron baking-sheet; distri- bute a few little bits of butter on the surface of the paste. On the other hand, boil in milk four ounces of rice; it must be melted into batter, finish it with a little cream • at last introduce into it three ounces of butter, and three or four whole eggs ; add to it a pinch of nutmeg, and a little pinch of sugar ; spread it, in a thin layer, on the paste ; sprinkle over a little grated parmesan ; push the baking-sheet into the oven. When the paste is done, take the ‘quische’ out, and serve it. 823. ‘Ravioles’ with spinach. Chop some blanched spinach, well pressed out; let it fry with butter, then sprinkle over a little flour, season it, and moisten it with a little milk, keeping it rather consistent. Let the preparation cool, and with it prepare a few dozen havioles’, proceeding according to the method prescribed in art. 821. — Ten minutes previous to serving, plunge the ‘ravioles’ into boiling salted water; boil them for three minutes, drain them on a sieve, place them on a deep dish, ranging layer by layer, sprinkling over some grated parmesan, and moistening them with brown- butter mixed up with a little tomata-sauce. 824. Small patties, for Lent. Prepare fifteen little patties with puff-paste (see art. 54, and 335); when they are taken out of the oven, disengage them from the baking-sheet,

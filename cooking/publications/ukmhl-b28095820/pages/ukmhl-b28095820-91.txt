ELEMENTARY METHODS. og on which place the paste; whicli roll out, and enlarge by beating it with the hand ; give it a square shape. Knead the butter vigorously in a cloth give it also a square shape, but smaller than the paste; place the butter on the centre ot the paste, then bring back the four sides of the paste, crossing them over the but- • ter, so that the butter may be entirely wrapped up. Take a pastry rolling- pin,* which apply to the paste with both hands, pushing forward the paste, as well as the butter in its interior. Bring the paste to the thick- ness of a tenth (or an eighth of an inch), keeping it straight on both sides : in short, just .as represented by the strip in drawing 43; now take the ■ strip at the side nearest your- • self, m order to told it at a third of its height (see drawing 44) ; press it together it by passing the rolling-pin over, and immediately fold over the 1opposite end, so as to cover the first folding. The drawing 45 represents ■ exactly the mode of the complete folding. Draw. 43. At this point, the paste has got one turn ; to fold it again it must then be given a halt-turn to the right, and then be rolled out with the rolling-pin, pushing it forwards; when as thin as at the first time, fold it , _ f r <lraW'ng f® hCre given 0f two rolling-pins: the one (46) is of French, the other ' . , ° ,erman orig'n: the latter has two movable handles at the ends, so that it is only the thicker part, which rolls over the paste. ‘ 3

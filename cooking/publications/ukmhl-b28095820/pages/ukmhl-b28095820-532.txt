474 THE HOUSEHOLD COOKERY-BOOK. 1027. Pear-flawn, with cream. Prepare a cream with four ounces of Hour, five ounces of sugar, one whole egg, three yolks of eggs, a grain of salt, a piece of zest, and three ounces of butter: it must not be too thick ; keep it at the side of the Hre. Line a flawn-circle with short-paste, or trimmings of puff-paste; mask the paste with buttered paper; fill the hollow with common flour, and thus bake the Hawn. When it is taken out of the oven, empty it, fill it nearly to height with the cream previously prepared ; upon this cream, range then, one beside the other, and in an upright position, whole small pears, cooked in compote, but reddened ; moisten them with a little of their own syrup, and thus serve the Hawn up. In order to get the pears red, they must be blanched in water for a few minutes, then place them in a sugar-pan, with a little syrup, and a few drops of liquid vegetable-carmin. When the pears are done, they must be of a nice red color. 1028. Plum-cakes. With ten ounces of flour, three ounces of butter, two tablespoonfuls of sugar, three whole eggs, half an ounce of yeast, and the milk requisite, prepare a raised paste, proceeding as said for that of brioche: bread-paste may also be employed. — When the paste has risen to the degree requi- site , turn it out on the floured table, then roll it out thin to the shape of a square; now spread it on a baking-sheet, make a little rim to the paste, keep it thus for twenty minutes; then butter its surface, over which sprinkle a handful of bitter almonds, chopped and mixed up with a pinch of powder - cinnamon; mask it with black plums cut in two; apply them on the side with the skin on, setting them a little ‘a cheval; sprinkle over sugar, push the cake into a slack oven ; bake it for twenty or twenty-five minutes; when it is taken out, again sprinkle over sugar, let it cool, divide it in long squares of middling-size.

CARVING AT TABLE. O transversally, and rather slantwise, as the drawing shows; the second is, carving the lillets lengthwise oft the breast, without making a breast-piece (Jiaut - de -poitnne) ; in both cases,, it is well, before the beginning of the operation, to disengage the pinions of both sides, leaving a small portion of the fillets adhering to them. If obliged to employ the legs of the tur- key, they are disengaged one by one, the paws are cut off at the knuckle-joint, then the meat is divided in pieces, yet leaving the drumstick whole. — The gravy served with turkey should be always sent up in a sauceboat.

Carving of partridges. — For the carving of partridges several methods are employed; it they are young and small, they are simply divided in two lengthwise ; if large, the proceeding is, either to detach the hind-part (train de dernerd), from the breast, or divide each in three Draw. 10.

If the hind-part is disengaged from the breast-piece, this last must be cut in three, and brought back into place: then the partridges do not look, as if carved, as they preserve their natural shape. — Large partridges may be simply divided into four parts.

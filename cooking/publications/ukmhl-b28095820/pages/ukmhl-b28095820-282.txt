Salted roll of beef. The sirloin of beef, boned according to the method described in the art. 33, and salted for fourteen or eighteen days, constitutes an excellent remove, especially if the meat be chosen of good qualities, and is boiled immediately after being taken out of the souse. Previous to cooking the meat, let it be washed; then cut it straight on the side, roll it up, and bind it with thread ; put it into a large vessel, cover it completely with cold water, add to it some vegetables, and let the liquid boil; at the first bubbling, remove it to the side of the fire, so that it only simmer gently ; three hours after, remove the vessel off the fire, so that the liquid ceases to boil, but yet remains warm ; two hours after, the meat should prove well done. . A piece of salted beef, served as a remove, must be accompanied by a good brown-sauce, and a garnish of fresh or dry vegetables, accord- ing to the season.

GAME. — TEAL, WOODCOCKS, THRUSHES 363 Roll the thrushes to a round shape, surround them with a band of paper; range them, one beside the other, in a flat stewpan; salt them, moisten them, nearly to height, with a little gravy unskimmed ; let them braise at a very slow fire, or at the mouth of the oven, for twenty minutes; let them cool in their cooking-stock ; drain them, trim them ; take them, one by one, with a fork, dip them into a brown chaufroix-sauce ; (see art. 206) Draw. 273. range them on a baking-sheet; when the sauce has well cooled, trim them all round; range them in a pyramid, on a cold dish; surround them with jelly-‘croutons’. 785. Salmis of woodcocks, burgher’s way. Roast two woodcocks in the conditions prescribed, art. 779, with bread-crusts; when done, divide each of them into five pieces, which trim properly, remove their skin, and the greater part of their bones ; place them in a middling-sized stewpan with the two heads of the woodcocks; glaze them with the paste-brush, and keep them covered. Remove the intestines from the. bodies, pound and pass them through a sieve. Boil a gill and a half of brown-sauce, or thickened gravy, adding to it four tablespoonfuls of madeira, the body-bones and trimmings of woodcocks cut in pieces, some peppercorns, two shalots, and a bunch of aromatics; give this sauce a few minutes’ vigorous ebullition, then pass it through a sieve ; skim off its fat, and with it, gradually dilute the puree ; pour it over the cut woodcocks, in order to warm them, but free of ebullition. Trim the crusts, place them on the bottom of a warm dish; upon these crusts range the woodcocks in a group, with the heads all round them ; pour over the sauce.

Larded and braised pullet, ‘a la Montglas’. Poultry and game are not so easily to be larded as butcher s meat, for the double reason, that their meat is more difficult to pierce, and that the rows of bacon are always inclined. In order to lard a piece of poultry well, its breast must be singed carefully, in order to let. the skm and meat set; but previous to being larded, the meat must have well cooled.

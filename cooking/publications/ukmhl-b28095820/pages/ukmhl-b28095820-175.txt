BARLEY-, AND POULTRY-, CREAM-SOUPS. 117 289. Barley-cream. Barley-cream, is one of the most stomachic soups, easy to be prepared, and at the same time cheap. For barley- cream, it is not necessary to have at disposal a very succulent broth, which rather should be light, but white, that is, prepared with veal; either with a knuckle, or simply with some veal-trimmings. Melt a piece of butter in a stewpan, mix in six ounces of pearl- barley, of fine grains, let it fry for two or three minutes, moisten it then with four glassfuls of boiling water, add to it a pinch of salt. At the first bubbling, cover the stewpan, remove it back to the side of the fire; boil the barley for two hours, minding to add a little broth from time to time; when done, take it off the fire, bray it with a spoon in the same stewpan, pass it through a sieve ; lighten this puree with the broth requisite, and again strain it; let it boil, stirring it, and immediately remove it back to the side of the fire. Half an hour after, skim the fat off the soup, thicken it with a liaison of five yolks of eggs; season it with a little nutmeg, and a pinch of sugar. Pour the soup into a tureen, passing it through a fine colander (see the drawing 77). 290. Crayfish-bisque. â€” For a bisque, that is to be served to seven or eight persons, mince two onions, one leek, one carrot, and a piece of celery root, or stick ; put them into a stewpan with butter, fry them gently for ten minutes; moisten them with two quarts of broth, either with or without meat; let the liquid boil, immediately remove it back to the side of the fire; add to it cloves and a bay-leaf. On the other hand, boil two dozen middling sized crayfish, with half a bottle of white wine, a bunch of parsley, and some vegetables ; drain them on a sieve, preserving their cooking-stock; take two thirds of these Draw. 77.

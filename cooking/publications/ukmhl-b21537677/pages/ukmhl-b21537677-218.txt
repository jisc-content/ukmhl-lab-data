210 MISS CAM EBONâ€™S COOKERY ROOK. Florador Biscuits. Five oz. flour, 3 oz. large grained Florador, 2 oz. castor sugar, 1 teaspoonful ground ginger, 3 oz. butter, 1 egg. Put the flour and Florador into a large basin, rub in the butter; mix in the sugar and ginger. Make into a stiff paste, with egg beaten up. Eoll out quarter of an inch thick. Cut in small rounds, and bake on a buttered tin ten minutes. Nougats. One lb. of Jordan almonds, 1 lb. of sugar. Scald the almonds and skin them, diy in a cloth and split them in halves, place them on a baking sheet in a slow oven till a very- light fawn colour. Place the sugar in a saucepan and stir over a slow fire to melt. When quite dissolved and beginning to bubble on the surface the almonds must be thrown in and mixed with the sugar. Carefully oil the moulds and drain off superfluous oil. Spread some of the nougat on an oiled baking sheet an eighth of an inch in thickness. Line the moulds quickly, for if the nougat cools it will be impossible to build it up. When set, turn it out of the moulds, and fill with whipped cream. Almond Icing. Three-quarter lb. sweet almonds, 1 lb. icing sugar, 6 bitter almonds, whites of 3 eggs, 1 tablespoonful of orange-flower water. Chop and pound, the almonds to a smooth paste, add the sugar gradually, then the orange-flower water and the whites of the eggs; spread over the cake, and dry before covering with plain icing. Almonds can be obtained now ready ground. Plain Icing. Put in a basin the whites of 3 eggs, add sufficient icing sugar to make a stiff batter; work well with a wooden spoon, adding 2 spoonfuls of lemon juice, until it is firm enough for the spoon to stand upright in. This icing may be coloured;

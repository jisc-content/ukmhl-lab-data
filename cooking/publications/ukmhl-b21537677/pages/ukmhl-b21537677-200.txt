Divide the mixture into three portions; into one stir some coffee essence and spice, also the sultanas, freed from stalks; into the second, put the cocoanut; and to the third, add the rose water and colouring (Breton’s is veiy good); divide the baking powder amongst the three lots, taking care to put it in lightly. Bake in a large square tin, about two inches deep, lined with white paper buttered on both sides, into which the mixture must be dropped from a spoon, so that the cake presents a marbled appearance when done.

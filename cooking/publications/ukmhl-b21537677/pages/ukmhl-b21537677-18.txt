10 MISS CAMERON’S COOKERY BOOK. The fat should be heated till a slight vapour rises from it before the meat is put into it. It is very important that the fat should be at the proper degree of heat, as anything immersed in fat not properly heated, becomes sodden, greasy, and uneatable. Fish, rissoles, and certain entrees, should be cooked in this manner, and should be placed on kitchen paper near the fire before serving. The fat, if carefully strained after each frying, can always be used again. The best grease for frying is clarified fat, which can easily be prepared in the following manner. Cut off all superfluous, fat from all joints, cutlets, and meat intended for use, and keep it until you have three or four lbs. Cut the fat up into pieces about an inch in length and put them into an iron saucepan, cover them with cold water, and allow the whole to slowly simmer over the fire till all the water has evaporated and the fat looks clear like oil; the pieces of fat will be browned and crisp and will fall to the bottom of the saucepan. Then strain this through a wire sieve, and it is ready for use. The next day it should look firm and white, and it can be used for ordinary house- hold pastry, etc., where economy is a great object. Different kinds of fat can be mixed in clarifying, such as beef, mutton, veal, and pork. As an alternative to taking this much trouble, the use for fxying purposes of Hugon’s “ Atora ” brand suet can be con- fidently recommended. It is a perfectly pure preparation of the best beef suet, free from skin, and is sold in a most convenient form for use. As I have before said, domestic economy is too wide a subject to go into in a small book of this description, being one which contains ample matter for a very large volume in itself. But I may as shortly as possible give a few of my ideas, re- sulting from practical experience, as to the different cooking apparatus.

INVALID COOKERY. Chicken Broth. /^CJT up a chicken in joints, scald the legs and remove the skin. Put in a clean saucepan with about 1 quart of cold water, a little salt, and 2 tablespoonfuls of rice. Simmer gently for two hours, and serve. Game may be substituted for chicken, if preferred. Sago Soup. Soak 3 oz. of sago in cold water for ten minutes; put it on to boil in 1 pint o-f water with 2 turnips cut up very small and a little pepper and salt. Boil it gently for two hours, and serve with sippets of toast. Bread Jelly. Toast a slice of stale bread till it is crisp and brown. Put it in a small saucepan and cover it with cold water. Simmer it gently for three hours, adding more water as required; it will then be a jelly. Strain, and add a little milk or cream and sugar. Season to taste. Oatmeal Water. Toast a thin oat cake till it is dry and brown; break it in pieces, and put it in a jug. Pour boiling water over it, cover it, and allow it to remain till cold. This is very good in cases of fever or inflammation.

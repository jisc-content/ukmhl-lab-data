COOKING BY GAS NY prejudice which, originally attached itself to this method of cooking has now long since ceased to exist, and the adoption of gas ranges in the schools of cookery, hotels, restaurants, and private residences is largely tending to sup. plant in toto the old kitchener. On hygienic principles alone, gas is supported by all scientists for the preparation of our food. The manufacture of gas from first to last is a process of distilling and purifying from coal, sulphur, sulphurated hydrogen, and ammonia being either wholly eliminated or reduced to its minimum quantity in purified “coal gas” as extracted from coal. It is obvious, therefore, that in the use of gas a purified agent is employed as against an unpurified agent in crude coal—a most important factor in the preparation of delicate foods. Keep the stoves absolutely clean, using hot water and soda for the purpose. They should be well washed at least twice a week. The oven should be washed out every time of using. Be careful to have a lighted taper to ignite the gas im- mediately it is turned on. Utensils used for gas stoves should never be placed on coal fires, as the soot which forms not only acts as a non- conductor, but when again placed on a gas burner throws oft’ carbon mon-oxide, and causes an unpleasant smell through the house.

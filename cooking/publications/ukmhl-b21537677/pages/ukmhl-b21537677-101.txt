93 MISS CAMERONâ€™S COOKERY BOOK. Roast Pheasant. Have the bird drawn and cleansed; remove the crop through an incision made at the -back of the neck; skewer through the pinion and the thigh, which must be brought up close under thel wing; tie and skewer the legs down; the head must be brought round and skewered to the body, the bill along the breast. If a cock pheasant, the crest feathers may be left on, and covered with paper to protect them while cooking, and the tail feathers can be stuck in when dished. Flour the bird well, and hang it before a bright fire, not too fierce; keep it well basted with butter. Time, three-quarters of an hour. Serve with brown gravy and bread sauce. Polenta pudding is very nice to dish it on. Roast Grouse. Pluck the bird carefully, taking care not to tear the skin; truss it like a pheasant, and roast before a clear fire, basting continually with butter, half an hour. When nearly done, lay a slice of toast ^ an inch thick in the dripping-pan; serve the bird on this, and send in brown gravy, bread crumbs fried, and bread sauce. Haunch of Venison. Before dressing it, wash it well and quickly in lukewarm water, and dry it with a soft cloth, then cover it entirely with well-buttered cartridge paper, over this spread a coarse paste of flour, meal and water, then another strong paper covering, and tie it firmly with strong thread. Hang it before a bright clear fire, and begin immediately to baste, and continue bast- ing often, the whole time. Forty minutes before it is cooked enough cut the string and carefully remove the covering and the paste; five minutes later remove the last paper, dredge with flour, and continue to baste with butter till done. Dish with frill round the shank; serve with strong venison gravy and currant jelly. A haunch of 25 lb. will take four and a half hours to roast.

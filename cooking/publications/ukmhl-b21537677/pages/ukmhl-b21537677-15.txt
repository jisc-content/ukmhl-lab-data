introduction. rP HE friendly reception accorded to my previous volume, “ Soups and Stews,” wliich has passed through three editions, has induced me to prepare a somewhat more com- prehensive collection of recipes on (the same principle ot providing the lady housewife with opportunities for varying the monotony of the family bill of fare, by the addition of a large variety of dainty dishes, which, while they may legi- timately come under the head of “ Recherche Cookery,” are inexpensive as regards their ingredients, and present no diffi- culties in preparation that are beyond the resources of the average suburban kitchen. Some few of the recipes included in my previous book will be found in the following pages, but the bulk of the collection is entirely new, and has not hitherto appeared in print. To the general remarks on the different methods of preparing food for the table, I have added some definite directions as to the use of the popular gas cooker. Roasting-—Bone and tendonous maitter, which are de- stroyed by the process of roasting, should be removed from tne piece of meat which is to be roasted, and used for stock purposes. If one does not wish to bone the meat entirely, all exposed pieces of bone should be removed and made use of. The general rules are, that all dark meats, such as beef, mutton, etc., should be put before a sharp fire for at least fifteen minutes, till the outside has acquired a coating of osmazome, and then drawn back and allowed to cook gently.

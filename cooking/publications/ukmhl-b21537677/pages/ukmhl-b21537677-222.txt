214 MISS CAMERON’S COOKERY BOOK. Tangerine Liqueur. The thinly-pared rinds of 20 tangerines, 2 lb. sugar candy, 1 gallon of French brandy. Cut up the rinds of the tangerine oranges, and put them into a jar with the sugar candy and brandy. Cover with a bladder, and let it stand for two or three months, shaking well every day. Orange Gin. Twelve Seville oranges, 1 lb. sugar candy, 1 gallon British gin. Wipe the oranges carefully, and put them whole into a large jar with the gin, and let them remain well covered for one month. Then take out the oranges, and add to the gin the sugar candy broken up. Let this stand for twenty- four hours, stirring occasionally till the sugar candy is dis- solved ; then bottle, cork well, and seal. It will be ready for use in seven months, but improves with age. The oranges make good marmalade after being taken out of the gin. White Currant Liqueur. Two' lb. ripe white currants, 2 quarts whisky, ^ oz. grated ginger, 2 lb. loaf sugar, the rind of 3 lemons. Strip the cur- rants from the stalk, and put them into a large jar, add the Lemon rind, ginger, and whisky. Cove the jar closely ^ and let it remain for twenty-four horns. Strain through a hair sieve, add the sugar, and let it stand twelve hours longer, then bottle and cork well. To be made in July. • Chestnuts Glaces, Shell the chestnuts and throw1 them into boiling water, till the inner skin comes off easily. Then put into boiling water, and boil till tender.

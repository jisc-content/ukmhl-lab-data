MISS CAMERON'S COOKERY BOOK. 129 Eggs a la Turque. Three sheep’s kidneys, 4 fresh eggs, \ a gill of good brown sauce, salt, pepper, a little chopped parsley. Take a fire- proof entree dish and butter it; grill the kidneys sharply for four minutes, and cut them into small pieces; place these in little heaps at the ends and sides of the dish, pour over them the sauce,, break the eggs into the centre, and bake for three minutes; sprinkle over them a little salt, pepper, and chopped parsley, and serve. Eggs en Couronne. Quarter lb. cooked ham, \ pint brown sauce, | teaspoonful lemon juice, some stale bread, and 4 fresh eggs. Cut 4 rounds of stale bread, 2 inches across and 2 inches high, scoop out the centres, and fry a golden brown in hot fat; heat the brown sauce, stir into it the ham and lemon juice, and fill the croutes of bread with the mixture. Poach the eggs gently, trim them with a cutter, and place one on eacn croute; sprinkle over each a little finely-chopped parsley, and serve hot on a dish-paper, garnished with parsley or watercress.

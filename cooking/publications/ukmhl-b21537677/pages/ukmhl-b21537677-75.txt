Keep the palates for some hours in warm salt and water, nibbing them now and again; then rinse them thoroughly, and put them on in cold water, which must be allowed to heat slowly, but on no account to boil. When the water is quite hot, scrape off the thick horny skin there is on the palates—this cannot be done if the water is once allowed to boil. Next put the palates in with a sliced carrot, half a turnip, an onion stuck with a clove or two, a bay leaf, a sprig of parsley, and a piece of lemon peel. Let all stew gently till the palates are tender. This will take several hours. The ox palates can then be lifted out on to a hot dish, trimmed, and served with the gravy they were stewed in, thickened, seasoned with pepper, salt, a little catchup, a spoonful of wine, and a. squeeze of lemon juice.

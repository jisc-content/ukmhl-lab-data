MISS CAMERON’S COOKERY ROOK. 199 lay the mixture on the paper in tablespoonfuls; when all is used sift sugar over them and allow them to stand for three minutes; place the strips of paper oni wetted boards, and bake in a moderate oven When done remove each one from the paper, and with a spoon remove the white soft part. Return to a cool oven to dry. Fill with cream. Doughnuts. One lb. self-raising flour, \ lb. castor sugar, 1 egg, a little milk. Mix the flour and sugar together, make a well in the centre, and put in the egg; mix, adding enough milk to make a dough just stiff enough to roll out.

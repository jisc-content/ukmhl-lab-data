Disk the fillets in a circle, cover with good white sauce, and garnish with lobster, coral, and truffle chopped up finely, or the yolk of an egg rubbed through a sieve. If served as an entree, fill the centre with some pretty vegetables. Lobster Cutlets. Put into a saucepan 1 oz. butter; when melted, stir in 1 oz. flour and 1 gill milk; mix well and boil three minutes; add lemon juice, salt, pepper, cayenne, 1 tablespoonful of cream. Take a hen lobster, separate the head from the body, and take out the coral; pound it with \ oz. of butter, pass it through a sieve, and add it to the sauce. Cut the flesh from the body and claws of the lobster into pieces, and~put into the sauce, mix well, and turn out on a plate to cool. When cold, divide into small pieces, shape as cut- lets, egg and crumb them, and fry in hot fat; stick into each cutlet a small piece of claw to represent bone, and dish in a circle with fried parsley in the centre. For cold cutlets roll in powdered coral instead of bread crumbs. Stewed Fish a lâ€™Espag-nol. Chop an onion and brown it in the bottom of the fish kettle with some olive oil; when of a good brown colour, take a plaice, cut it in slices of two or three inches broad, put it on the strainer into the kettle, add some salt and a pint of water. Stew gently till cooked; beat up four eggs, to which add slowly the juice of four lemons, beating it all the time, so that the eof?s do not curdle, then stir into it 1 tablespoonful curry powder, and throw it quickly over the fish; shake the pan about for a minute or two, and remove from the fire (as it must not curdle). Place the fish on a dish and strain the liquor over it. This will keep for several days, and is best eaten cold. D

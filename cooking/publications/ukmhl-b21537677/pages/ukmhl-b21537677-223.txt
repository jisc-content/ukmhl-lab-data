MISS CAMERONâ€™S COOKERY ROOK. 215 Clarified Sugar. Two lb. loaf sugar, 1 pint water, 1 white of egg. Beat the white of egg, and put it with the sugar and water into a copper saucepan, place on the hot plate for twenty minutes. When the sugar is thoroughly dissolved, bring it to the boil, throw in a cup of cold water, and bring to the boil again, then leave by the side of the fire till the syrup is settled. Kemove all scum, and it is ready for use. Candied Walnuts. Shell the walnuts and put them into boiling water for a few minutes, then skin them. Throw them into a pan of boiling water, and boil till tender; when done, put them into a basin of warm water with a piece of lemon; leave till cold; then dip them in clarified sugar flavoured with liqueur, and lay them on a slab to dry. Pickled Cucumbers. Put 5 pints of vinegar in a saucepan, with a teaspoonful of ground ginger, a few peppercorns and cloves, and a little salt. Place the pan on the fire, and let it come to the boil. Then remove it to a cool place. Take six large cucumbers, pare them, scrape out the seeds, and cut them into oblong pieces and put them in jars. When the vinegar is cool (not cold) pour it over the cucumbers in the jars, cover them tightly and put them away for a week or so, when they will be ready for use.

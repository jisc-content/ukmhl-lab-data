MISS CAMERONâ€™S COOKERY BOOK. 14 The oven should be thoroughly heated before the joint is placed in it. This can be accomplished in about ten minutes. Place the joint either on the hanging hook (fattest side up) or on the bottom grid. In this position the joints will largely baste themselves. Expose them to a large heat at starting, so as to hermetically close and seal up the pores, and thereby retain all the nourishing juices. After being thus exposed (say for fifteen minutes) lower the gas, and complete the cooking at a lower temperature.

Rich cakes take some hours to bake, and require a veiy moderate oven. Anything containing much sugar is liable to bum, so great care should be taken. After the cakes are baked, and the gas is turned out, sufficient heat will be retained in the oven to bake meringues, cocoanut biscuits, etc. Bread. Heat the oven as before mentioned, put in the loaves, turn the gas half down, and bake gently. A two>-pound loaf will take from forty-five to fifty minutes. Pastry.

LEAN the fish and rub a little salt over it half an, hour before cooking; put it in a fish kettle and cover it with warm water; squeeze a little lemon juice into the water, and simmer gently (allowing 10 minutes to the lb.) till done. Oyster sauce is generally served with cod. Put the fish into warm water with salt and simmer gently; allow 8 minutes to the lb. When done, dish up on a folded napkin, and garnish with parsley. Serve with either lobster, shrimp, or tartar sauce. Never put vinegar or lemon juice into the water with salmon, as either will destroy the flavour and colour. Cut the salmon in pieces and place it in the oven in a buttered pan for ten minutes; prepare some Mayonnaise sauce, colour it with spinach extract, flavour with tarragon juice, for which blanch the tarragon in boiling water; pound and rub through a sieve, add \ a gill of aspic jelly.

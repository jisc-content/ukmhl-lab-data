MISS CAMERON'S COOKERY ROOK. 25 Meat. Put all the vegetables and seasonings into a saucepan with the water, let the whole come to the boil, and then gently simmer for three-quarters to one hour; strain off the liquor, and add the Liebig Company’s Extract of Meat, boil up, and use for clear or thick soup. A small piece of ham, or a piece of bacon rind, is a great improvement to the stock. Clear Soup. Two quarts of stock, 1 carrot, 1 onion, a sprig each of tarragon and chervil, a sprig of parsley, salt and pepper to taste, J lb. gravy beef finely minced or 4 whites of eggs- Put the stock into a stewpan with the meat minced and freed from fat, or the whites of eggs, and the vegetables, whisk sharply over the fire until on the point of boiling, let it boil up for five minutes; place the lid upon the saucepan, draw aside from the fire, and allow to stand ten minutes. Strain through a felt bag or coarse kitchen cloth (first pouring a quart of boiling water through the cloth). If not quite clear, strain a second time. Gravy beef to clear gives a richer flavour to the soup, but if not convenient the whites of eggs can be used. Consomme a la Royale. Clear soup served with savoury custard cut into fancy shapes. Soupe a la Portugaise. Clear soup served with strips of boiled leeks and prunes stewed in stock. Soupe a l’Imperatrice Cleas soup served with tiny pieces of cooked chicken, cauliflower, and glace cherries in it. Soupe a la Lurline.

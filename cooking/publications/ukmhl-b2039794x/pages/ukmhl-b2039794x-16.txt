Let the patient have no dirty linen, spoons, plates, &c, in use. Prepare all food outside the sick-room. Do not leave any food in the room.

Not more than six tablespoonfuls should be admin- istered at a time, but this may be repeated every two, four, or six hours, as may be necessary. All enemata should be warmed to blood heat. The injection should be administered directly after a natural motion, or after the bowel has been washed out with a pint of water at blood heat.

If the propor- tion of fat to meat in a meat injection exceed one fourth, the enema will probably be rejected. Laudanum or solution of

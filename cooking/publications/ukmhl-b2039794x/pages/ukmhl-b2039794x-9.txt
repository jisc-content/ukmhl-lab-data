1 LIGHT DIET. I. INTRODUCTORY. In these pages an attempt has been made to give directions for the diet of such as are unable to take ordinary food, and are consequently restricted to light diet, slops, and so forth. Owing to the difference of constitutions it is impossible to lay down hard-and-fast rules for diet, so true is the proverb, " What is one man's meat is another man's poison." Nay, further, what is meat to a man to-day may be poison to that same man to- morrow. Roughly speaking, however, the various classes of food are arranged in this book according to their digestibility, and the numbers appended in brackets to the different recipes are intended to mark their relative value in this respect. Thus :— (1) Marks the kind of food suitable to the climax of all acute and severe diseases, where but little assimilation takes place in the stomach. Here predigested foods and enemata are to be chiefly relied on, with milk and alcohol in the second rank ■ • -....„. (2) This class of food is allowable where the digestion is less impaired than in the previous class, and very-light and digestible foods, such as milk, meat teas, gruels^ and raw eggs can be taken. (3) Is to be given where some further progress has been made towards recovery, or where the disease has not been so severe in character. In this class soups, farinaceous food, eggs, and the more wholesome kinds of fish and poultry are to be reckoned. (4) Is for convalescents, or for still milder diseases Fish, poultry, game, and the more digestible meats are included in this division. (5) Is to be used in advanced convalescence, where there is no longer much restriction in the diet. (6) These recipes are suitable for dyspeptics. The transition from one of these states to another is repre- °TA^ng iKtw° fiSure9 •> thus (2-3) de™tes that this article of diet would be suitable for milder cases belonging to class (2), but not for the more severe. uu^luS

PBEFACE. This little book is intended not so much for the guidance of the medical practitioner, as for the use and information of the lay patient, and it has, therefore, heen written in a style more suited to the kitchen, than to the laboratory, or the study. The public in general seem to consider that when a patient is ordered " light diet," he may have nothing but gruel and beef-tea. I have, therefore, in these pages given a number of alternatives, which, I hope, may be found more palatable than these two foods. Wishing to make the work as complete as possible, I have not limited the contents to the literal meaning of the title, but have included many dishes and classes of food, which cannot be pro- perly referred to " Light Diet." A book on this subject is necessarily in great part a compila- tion, and I gratefully acknowledge my indebtedness to the courtesy, as well as to the talent and industry, of Dr. Broadbent, Dr. King Chambers, Dr. Milner Fothergill, Sir W. Roberts, Sir Henry Thompson, and the other gentlemen who have kindly allowed me to quote from their well-known works. Those recipes to which no name is appended have either been derived from private sources, or composed, or altered in some respect, by myself. Hampton Court, July, 1887.

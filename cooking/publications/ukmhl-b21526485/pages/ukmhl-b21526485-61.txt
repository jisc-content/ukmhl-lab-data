HOUSEWIFE. 51 Small legs should be kept in pickle twelve or fifteen clays; if large, four or five weeks are not too much. They should be hung up a day or two to dry before they are smoked. Lay them in the oven on crossed sticks, and make a fire at the entrance. Cobs, walnut-bark, or walnut- chips, are the best to use for smoking, on account of the sweet taste they give the meat. The smallest pieces should be smoked forty-eight hours, and large legs four or five days. Some people prefer the mutton boiled as soon as it is taken from the pickle, before it is smoked; others hang it up till it gets dry thoroughly, and eat it in thin slices, like hung beef. When legs of meat are put in pickle, the thickest part of the leg- should be placed uppermost, that is, standing upright, the same as the creature stood when living. The same rule should be observed when they are hung up to dry; it is essential in order to keep in the juices of the meat. Meat should be turned over once or twice during the jorocess of smoking. The old-fashioned way for curing hams is to rub them with salt very thoroughly, and let them lie twenty-four hours. To each ham allow two ounces of salt-petre, one quart of common salt, and one quart of molasses. First baste them with molasses; next rub in the salt-petre; and, last of all, the common salt. They must be carefully turned and rubbed every day for six weeks ; t lien hang them in a chimney, or smoke- house, four weeks.

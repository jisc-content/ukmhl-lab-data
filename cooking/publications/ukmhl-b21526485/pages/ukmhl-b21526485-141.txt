131 RURAL ECONOMY, ETC. TO DESTROY BEETLES. Take some small lumps of unslacked lime, and put into the chinks or holes from which they issue, it will effectually destroy them; or it may be scattered on the ground, if they are more numerous than in their holes. DESTROYING RATS. The works at Hurlet, in Scotland, were lately overrun with rats to such a degree that it became absolutely necessary to adopt summary measures for totally extirpating the destructive vermin. The following means were resorted to, and they were attended with the most perfect success. A num- ber of corks, cut down as thin as sixpences, were roasted or stewed in grease, and then placed in the way of the rats. The dish was greedily devoured as a special delicacy, and, as was anticipated, they all died of indigestion. TO DESTROY SLUGS, CATERPILLARS, ETC. Put in an iron pot a pound of quick lime, and a pound of sulphur. Stir them about quickly; and, whdst doing so, put in six pounds of water, which is to boil. Snails will immediately leave any place watered with this composition : and if trees are watered with it, any caterpillars upon them will die instantly. 1

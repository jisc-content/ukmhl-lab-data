RURAL ECONOMY, ETC. 132 TO DESTROY THISTLES, ETC. A farmer states, that “having once a pasture field, that seemed one entire bed of common thistles, and having occasion to carry manure across it to another field, I observed all the thistles completely killed wherever the carts went; I therefore set to, and rolled the whole field with a cast-iron roller, once in the latter end of May, and twice in the beginning of June. The field has been free from thistles ever since. The expense was only three shillings per acre. Fern and coltsfoot I have exterminated in the same way.” CURE FOR THE AMERICAN BLIGHT. Melt about three ounces of resin in an earthen pipkin, take it from the fire, and pour into it three ounces of fish oil; the ingredients perfectly unite, and when cold, acquire the consistence of honey. A slight degree of heat will liquefy it, and in this state paint over every infected part of your tree, using a common painter’s brush. This I prefer doing in spring, as soon as the hoariness appears. The substance soon sufficiently hardens, and forms a varnish, which prevents any escape and stifles the insects. After the first dressing, should any cottony matter appear round the margin of the varnish, a second application to these parts will, I think, be found to effect a perfect cure.

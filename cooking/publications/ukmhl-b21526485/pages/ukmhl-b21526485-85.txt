HOUSEWIFE. 75 Fish gravy is very much improved by taking out some of the fat, after the fish is fried, and putting in a little butter. The fat thus taken out will do to fry fish again; but it will not do for any kind of shortening. Shake in a little flour into the hot fat, and pour in a little boiling water; stir it up well, as it boils, a minute or so. Some people put in vinegar ; but this is easily added by those who like it. A common sized cod-fish should be put in when the water is boiling hot, and boil about twenty minutes. Haddock is not as good for â– boiling as cod; it takes about the same time to boil. A piece of halibut which weighs four pounds is a large dinner for a family of six or seven. It should boil forty minutes. No fish putin till the water boils. Melted butter for sauce. Salt fish should be put in a deep plate, with just water enough to cover it, the night before you intend to cook it. It should not be boiled an instant; boiling renders it hard. It should lie in scalding hot water two or three hours. The less water is used, and the more fish is cooked at once, the better. Water thickened with flour and water while boiling, with sweet butter put in to melt, is the common sauce. It is more eco- nomical to cut salt pork into small bits, and fry it 'till the pork is brown and crispy. It should not be done too fast, lest the sweetness be scorched out.

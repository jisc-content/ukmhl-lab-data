22 THE FRUGAL Have plenty of crash towels in the kitchen; never let your white napkins be used there. Soap your dirtiest clothes, and soak them in soft water over night. Use hard soap to wash your clothes, and soft to wash your floors. Soft soap is so slippery, that it wastes a good deal in washing clothes. Instead of covering up your glasses and pic- tures with muslin, cover the frames only with cheap yellow cambric, neatly put on, and as near the colour of the gilt as you can procure it. This looks better; leaves the glasses open for use, and the pictures for ornament: and is an effectual barrier to dust as well as flies. It can easily be recoloured with saffron tea when it is faded. Have a bottle full of brandy, with as large a mouth as any bottle you have, into which cut your lemon and orange peel when they are fresh and sweet. This brandy gives a delicious flavour to all sorts of pies, puddings, and cakes. Lemon is the pleasantest spice of the two; therefore they should be kept in separate bottles. It vs a good plan to preserve rose-leaves in brandy. T he flavour is pleasanter than rose-water; and there are few people who have the utensils for distilling. Peach-leaves steeped in brandy make excellent spice for custards and puddings. _ It is easy to have a supply of horse-radish all winter. Have a quantity grated while the root is in perfection, put it in bottles, fill it with strong vinegar, and keep it corked tight.

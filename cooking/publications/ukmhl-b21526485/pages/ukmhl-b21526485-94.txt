84 THE FRUGAL according to the sweetness of the cherries. Baked with a top and bottom crust three quarters of an hour. APPLE PIE. When you make apple pies, stew your apples very little indeed; just strike them through, to make them tender. Some people do not stew them at all, but cut them up in very thin slices, and lay them in the crust. Pies made in this way may retain more of the spirit of the apple, but I do not think the seasoning mixes in as well. Put in sugar to your taste; it is impossible to make a precise rule, because apples vary so much in acidity. A very little salt, and a small piece of butter in each pie, makes them lichei. Cloves and cinnamon are both suitable spice. Lemon-brandy and rose-water are both excellent. A wine-glass full of each is sufficient foi tlnee or four pies. If your apples lack spirit, giate in a whole lemon. CUSTARD PIE. It is a general rule to put eight eggs to a quart of milk, in making custard pies; but six eggs are a plenty for any common use. The mdk should be boiled and cooled before it is used; and bits of stick-cinnamon and bits of lemon-peel boiler in it Sweeten it to your taste with clean sugar; a very little sprinkling of salt makes them taste better. Grate in a nutmeg. Bake in a deep plate. About twenty minutes are usually enough.

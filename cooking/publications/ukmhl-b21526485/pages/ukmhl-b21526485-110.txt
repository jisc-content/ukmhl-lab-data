100 THE FRUGAL A pound of sugar to a pound of fruit is tlie rule for all preserves. The sugar should be melted over a fire moderate enough not to scorch it. When melted, it should be skimmed clean, and the fruit dropped in to simmer till it is soft. Plums, and things of which the skin is liable to be broken, do better to be put in little jars, with their weight of sugar, and the jars set in a kettle of boiling water, till the fruit is done. See the water is not so high as to boil into the jars. When you put preserves in jars, lay a while paper, thoroughly wet with brandy, flat upon the surface of the preserves, and cover them carefully from the air. If they begin to mould, scald them by setting them in the oven till boiling hot. Glass is much better than earthen for preserves; they are not half as apt to ferment. CURRANT JELLY. Currant jelly is a useful thing for sickness. If it be necessary to wash your currants, be sure they are thoroughly drained, or your jelly will be thin. Break them up with a pestle, and squeeze them through a cloth. Put a pint oi clean sugar to a pint of juice, and boil it slowly, till it be- comes ropy. Great care must be taken not to doit too fast; it is spoiled by being scorched. It should be frequently skimmed while simmer- in^. If currants are put in a jar, and kept in boiling water, and cooked before they arestrained, they are more likely to keep a long tune without fermenting.

If it scorches black immediately, the heat is too furious; if it merely browns, it is right. Some people wet an old broom two or three times, and turn it round near the top of the oven till it dries; this prevents pies and cake from scorching on the top. When you go into a new house, heat your oven two or three times, to get it seasoned, before you use it Alter the wood is burned, rake the coals over the bottom of the oven, and let them lie a few minutes. Those who make their own bread should make yeast too. When bread is nearly out, always think whether yeast is in readiness; for it takes a day and night to prepare it. One handful of hops, with two or three handsful of malt and rye bran, should be boiled fifteen or twenty minutes jn l'vo ciuart8 of water, then strained, hung on to boil again, and thickened with half a pint of rye and water stirred up quite thick, and a little mo- lasses; boil it a minute or two, and then take it oft to cool. When just about lukewarm, put in a cupful of good lively yeast, and set it in a cool place in summer, and warm place in winter If it is too warm when you put in the old yeast all the spirit will be killed. ^ In summer, yeast sours easily; therefore make but little at a time. Bottle it when it gets well

Clear off the fat, and add to the gravy half a pint of port wine, a glass of vinegar, and alarge spoonful of ketchup; simmer half an hour, and serve in a deep disk. Half a pint of table-beer may be added. The herbs to be used should be burnet, tarragon, parsley, thyme, basil, savoury, mar- joram, pennyroyal, knotted marjoram, and some chives if you can get them, but observe to proportion the quantities to the pungency of the several, sorts; let there be a good handful altogether.

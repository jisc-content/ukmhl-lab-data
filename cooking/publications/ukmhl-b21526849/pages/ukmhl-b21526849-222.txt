Shred a pound of suet; mix with a pound and a quarter of flour, two eggs beaten separately, a little salt, and as little milk as will make it. Boil four hours.

Cut the crumb of a threepenny-loaf into slices ; boil and sweeten two quarts of new milk, and pour over it. When soaked pour out a little of the milk; and mix with six eggs well beaten, and half a nutmeg. Lay the slices of bread into a dish; with layers of currants and veal suet shred, a pound of each. Butter the dish well, and bake} or you may boil it in a basin if you prefer it. Hunter's pudding. Mix a pound of suet, ditto flour, ditto currants, ditto raisins stoned and little cut, the rind of half a lemon pared as fine as possible, six Jamaica peppers in fine powder, four eggs, a glass of brandy, a little salt, and as little milk as will make it of a proper consistence; boil it in a floured cloth, or a lemon mould, eight or nine hours. Serve with sweet sauce. Add sometimes a spoonful of peach-water for change of flavour. This pudding will keep after it is boiled six months, if kept tied up in the same cloth, and hung up, folded in a sheet of cap-paper to preserve it from dust, being first cold.

SAVOURY PIES. 132 Babbits, if young and in flesh, do as well: their legs should he cut short, and the breast bones must not go in, but will help to make the gravy. Green- Goose pie. Bone two young green geese, of a good size, but first take away every plug and singe them nicely. Wash them clean; and season them high with salt, pepper, mace and allspice. Put one inside the other; and press them as close as you can, drawing the legs inwards. Put a good deal of butter over them, and bake them either with or without crust: if the latter, a cover to the dish mustfit closetokeep in the steam. It will keep long. Duck pie. Bone a full-grown young duck and fowl; wash them and season with pepper and salt, and a small proportion of mace and allspice, in the finest powder. Put the fowl within tlieduck, and in the former a calPstongue pickled red, boiled very tender and peeled. Press the whole close; the skins of the legs should be drawn inwards that the body of the fowl may be quite smooth. If approved, the space between the sides of the crust may be filled with a fine forcemeat, made according to the receipt given for making forcemeat in page 125. Bake it in a slow oven, either in raised crust or pie- dish, with a thick crust, ornamented. The large pies in Staffordshire are made as above, but with a goose outside, then a turkey, a duck next, then a fowl, and either tongue, small birds, or force- meat in the middle. Giblet pie. After very nicely cleaning goose or duck giblets stew them with a small quantity of water, onion, hlack pepper, and a bunch of sweet herbs, till nearly done. Let them grow cold, and if not enough to fill the dish, lay a beef, veal, or two or three mutton steaks at the bottom. Put the liquor of the stew to bake with the above; and when the pie is baked, pour into it a large tea-cupful of cream. Sliced potatoes added to it, eat extremely well.

186 DOMESTIC COOK1EET. Mushroom, Ketchup, another way. Take a stew-pan full of the large-flap mushrooms, that are notworm eaten, and tliesk’ins and fringe of those you have pickled, throw a handful of salt among them, and set them by a slow fire ; they will produce a great deal of liquor, which you must strain; and put to it 4 ounces of shalots, two cloves of garlick, a good deal of pepper, ginger, mace, cloves, and a few bay-leaves, boil and skim very well.

Open the cockles, scald them in their own liquor; add a little water when the liquor settles, if you have not enough; strain through a cloth, then season with every savoury spice ; and if for brown sauce, add port, anchovies, and garlick—if for white, omit these, and put a glass of sherry, lemon-juice and peel, mace, nut- meg, and white pepper. If for brown, burn a hit of sugar for colouring. It is better to have cockles enough than to add water; and they are cheap. To keep Capers. Add fresh vinegar that has been scalded, and become

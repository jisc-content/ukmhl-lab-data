Slices of bread, or rice, may be either stewed with the fruit, or added, when eaten; the rice being plain boiled.

If the ice-cream or water be in a form, shut the bottom close, and move the whole in the ice, as you cannot use a spoon to that without danger of waste. There should be holes in the bucket, to let off the ice as it thaws.

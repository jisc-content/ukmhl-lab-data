DOMESTIC COOKERY. 1-13 rose-water, a quarter of a nutmeg, and two ounces of sugar. Bake it in a shallow dish lined with paste ; and turn it out to serve with a little sugar dusted over. An Excellent Apricot pudding. Halve twelve large apricots, give them a scald till they are soft; meantime pour on the grated crumbs of a penny-loaf, a pint of boiling cream ; when half cold, four ounces of sugar, the yolks of four beaten eggs, and a glass of white wine. Pound the apricots in a mortar with some or all of the kernels; mix then the fruit and other ingredients together; put a paste round a dish, and bake the pudding half an hour. Balced Gooseberry pudding. Stew gooseberries in a jar over a hot hearth, or in a sauce-pan of water till they will pulp. Take a pint of the juice pressed through a coarse sieve, and beat it with three yolks and whites of eggs beaten and strain- ed, one ounce and a half of butter ; sweeten it well and put a crust round the dish. A few crumbs of roll should be mixed with the above to give a little consis- tence, or four ounces of Naples biscuits. A Green Bean pudding. Boil and blanch old beans, beat them in a mortar, with very little pepper and salt, some cream and the yolk of an egg. A little spinach juice will give a finer colour, but it is as good without. Boil it in a basin that will just hold it, an hour; and pour parsley and butter over. Serve bacon to eat with it. Shelford pudding. Mix three quarters of a pound of currants or raisins, one pound of suet, one pound of flour, six eggs, a little good milk, some lemon-peel, a little salt. Bod it in a melon shape six hours. Brandy pudding. Line a mould with jar-raisins stoned, or dried cher- ries, then with thin slices of French roll, next to which put ratafias, or macaroons; then the fruit, rolls and cakes

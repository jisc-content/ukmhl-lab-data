302 DOMESTIC COOKERY. To destroy Crickets. Put Scotch snuff upon the holes where they come out. DIRECTIONS FOE SERVANTS. To clean Calico Furniture, when taken down for the Summer. Shake off the loose dust, then lightly brush with a small long-haired furniture brush; after which wipe it closely with clean flannels, and rub it with dry bread. If properly done, the curtains will look nearly as well as at first, and if the colour be not light, they will not require washing for years. Fold in large parcels, and put carefully by. While the furniture remains up, it should be pre- served from the sun and air as much as possible, which injure delicate colours; and the dust maybe blown off with bellows. By the above mode, curtains may be kept clean, even to use with the linings newly-dipped. To clean plate. Boil anounce of prepared hartshorn powder in aquart of water; while on the fire, put into it as much plate as the vessel will hold; let it boil a little, then take it out, drain it over the saucepan, and dry it before the fire. Put in more, and serve the same, till you have done. Then put into the water some clean linen rags, till all be soaked up. When dry, they will serve to clean the plate, and are the very best things to clean the brass-locks and finger-plates of doors. When the plate is quite dry, it must be rubbed bright with leather. This is a very nice mode. In many plate-powders there is a mixture of quicksilver, which is very injurious; and, among other disadvantages, it makes silver so brittle, that from a fall it will break. To clean Looking-glasses. Eemove the fly-stains, and other soil, by a damp rag; then polish with woollen cloth and powder-blue.

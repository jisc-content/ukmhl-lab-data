SOUPS. 103 Another way.â€”Peel and slice six large onions, six potatoes, six carrots, and four turnips; fry them in half a pound of butter, and pour on them four quarts of boiling water. Toast a crust of bread as brown and hard as possible, but do not burn it; put that, some celery, sweet herbs, white pepper and salt to the above, stew it all gently four hours, then strain it through a coarse cloth; have ready sliced carrot, celery, and a little turnip, and add to your liking, and stew them tender in the soup.

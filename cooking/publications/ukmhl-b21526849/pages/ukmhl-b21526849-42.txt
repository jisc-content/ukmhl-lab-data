XXXV1 MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS FOR meat, sugars, &c. when brought in, and compare with the charge. The butcher should be ordered to send the weight with the meat, and the cook to file these checks, to be examined when the weekly bill shall be delivered. Much trouble and irregularity are saved when there is company, if servants are required to prepare the table and sideboard in similar order daily. All things likely to be wanted should be in readiness ; sug*rs of different qualities kept broken, currants washed, picked, and perfectly dry; spices pounded, and kept in very small bottles closely corked; not more than will be used in four or five weeks should be pounded at a time. Much less is necessary than when boiled whole in gravies, &c. Where noonings or suppers are served, (and in every house some preparation is necessary for accidental visitors,) care should be taken to have such things in readiness as are proper for either, a list of several will be subjoined, a change of which may be agreeable, and, if duly managed, will be attended with little expense and much con- venience. A ticket should be exchanged by the cook for every loaf of bread, which, when returned, will shew the number to be paid for; as tallies may be altered, unless one is kept by each party. Those who are served with brewer’s beer, or any other articles not paid for weekly or on delivery, should keep a book for entering the dates; which will not only serve to prevent overcharges, but will shew the whole year’s consumption at one view. An inventory of furniture, linen, and China, should be kept, and the things examined by it twice a-year, or oftener, if there be a change of servants; into each of whose care the articles used by him or her should be entrusted, with a list, as is done with plate.

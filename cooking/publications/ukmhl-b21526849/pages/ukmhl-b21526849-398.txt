322 DOMESTIC COOKERY. Where Vegetables and Fowls, &c. are twice dressed, they add to the appearance of the table the first time ; three sweet things may form the second appearance without greater expense. The Bills of Fare which have been given from page 309 to 320, may be modified at discretion. In some houses, one dish at a time is sent up with the vegetables or sauces proper to it, and this in suc- cession hot and hot. In others, a course of Soups and Fish; then Meats and boiled Fowls, Turkey, &c. Made-Dishes and Grame follow; and, lastly, Sweet Dishes ; but these are not the common modes. It is worthy of observation here, that common cooks do not think of sending up such articles as are in the house, unless ordered; though, by so doing, the addi- tion of a collared or pickled tiling, some Fritters, fried Patties, or quick-made dumplins, would be use- ful when there happened to be accidental visitors: and, at all times, it is right to better the appearance of the table rather than let things spoil below, by which the expense of a family is more increased than can be easily imagined. Vegetables are put on the side-table at large dinners, as likewise sauces, and ser- vants bring them round: but some inconvenience at- tends this plan; and, when there are not many to wait, delay is occasioned; besides that, by awkwardness the clothes of the company may be spoiled. If the table is of a due size, the articles alluded to will not fill it too muck. SUPPERS. Ilot suppers are not muck in use wkere people dine very late. Wken required, tke top and bottom, or, either, may be Game. Fowls. Rabbit. Boiled Fisk, suck as Soles, Mackerel. Oysters, stewed or scalloped. French Beans. Cauliflower, or Jeru- salem Artichokes, in white Sauce. Broccoli with Eggs. Stewed Spinach and ditto. Sweetbreads.

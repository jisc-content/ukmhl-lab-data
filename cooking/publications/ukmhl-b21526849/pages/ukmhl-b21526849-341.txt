DAIRY. 265 the curd on it, and let the whey drain ; break the curd a little with your hand, and put it into a vat with a two-pound weight upon it. Let it stand twelve hours, take it out, and bind a fillet round. Turn every day till dry, from one bo4ard to another; cover them with nettles, or clean dock-leaves, and put between two pewter-plates to ripen. If the weather be warm, it will be ready in three weeks. Another.—Have ready a kettle of boiling water, put five quarts of new milk into a pan, and Jive pints of cold water, and Jive of hot; when of a proper heat, put in as much rennet as will bring it in twenty mi- nutes, likewise a bit of sugar. When come, strike the skimmer three or four times down, and leave it on the curd. In an hour or two lade it into the vat without touching it; put a two-pound weight on it when the whey has run from it, and the vat is full. Another sort.—Put as much salt to three pints of raw cream as will season it: stir it well, and pour it into a sieve in which you have folded a cheese-cloth three or four times, and laid at the bottom. When it hardens, cover it with nettles on a pewter-plate. To a quart of fresh cream put a pint of new milk warm enough to make the cream a proper warmth, a bit of sugar, and a little rennet. Set near the fire till the curd comes; fill a vat made in the form of a brick, of wheat-straw or rushes sewed together. Have ready a square of straw, or rushes sewed flat, to rest the vat on, and another to cover it; the vat being open at top and bottom. Next day take it out, and. change it as above to ripen. A half-pound weight will be sufficient to put on it. Another way.—Take a pint of very thick sour cream from the top of the pan for gathering butter, lay a nap- kin on two plates, and pour half into each, let them stand twelve hours, then put them on a fresh wet nap- kin in one plate, and cover with the same; this do every twelve hours until you find the cheese begins to

vi PREFACE. the Author's endeavour to present the newest and best recipes. The Chapters devoted to the Oven are full, and include rules for making all the Cakes and Biscuits the Author believes his reader will be likely to require. One short Chapter is given on Colours; then follow others on GrystallizafAon, Caramel Work, Rock Sugar, Comfits, Chocolate, and Lozenges, The concluding Chapters are on Iceing, Oum Paste, Distillation, and Moulds. The last Chapter is devoted to Desserts and Bills of Fareâ€”subjects which cannot receive too much attention from those who wish to learn completely the whole art of Modern Confectionery. With regard to the language employed, the Author has given the rules in the phraseology of the kitchen. The composition of a book is a task quite new to him, and he asks the indulgence of the educated for any peculiarities of expression which may be observed. Should the quantities prescribed in any of the recipes be too large, the practitioner need scarcely be told that he can always reduce them, providing they are kept in exact proportion, W. Jeanes. 2\la^, 1861.

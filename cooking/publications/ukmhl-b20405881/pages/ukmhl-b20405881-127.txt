ON CREAM AND OTHER ICES. 87 sistence without help ; salt is used to assist it, and the more salt you add to the ice, the quicker the creams are frozen. As a general rule, two pounds of salt will be sufficient for six pounds of ice. The ice should be broken small, that it may lie close to the pot, and freeze its contents. Set your freezing-pot exactly in the middle of the ice, taking care that it is clean, and the cover kept on until the ingredients are put in. The rough ice and salt should come to within an inch of the top of the freezing-pot.

Place paper over the top, close the cover down, and turn the pot or pots quickly round in the ice for five minutes, taking hold of the handles at the top. Now remove the cover, scrape all the ice from the sides, and work it well with the back of the spaddle against the side of the pot, until the whole is as smooth as butter. Put the cover on again for three or four minutes, turn the pot briskly round in the ice; uncover, and stir up the whole, scraping off and mixing in with the rest, as before. Turn and scrape the freezing-pot alternately, until the Cream has thoroughly set (to about the consistence of butter), and the Iceing is completed.

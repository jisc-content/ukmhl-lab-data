Fruits should be placed at the top, bottom, and flanks, at a party over twenty-four; under that number, top and bottom only. In summer, fresh fruits give a variety to the Dessert. In winter, preserved fruits and pastes must be substituted. Pine apples should be dished up with oranges and grapes in summer, and in winter with apples. For a dinner of twenty-eight, you must have a Dessert of twenty-four dishes. (See frontispiece.)

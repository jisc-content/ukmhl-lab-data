92 THE MODERN CONFECTIONER. there should be at least six feet of earth, in which shrubs may be planted to keep off the sun. If a side entrance is determined on (which will not be attended with so much risk to the temperature of the Ice as continually taking from the top), have a passage cut in a line with the bottom of the Ice- house. The entrance should be a small one, with two doors, the outer of which should be well padded with straw patch. The doors must fit tight, and all crevices be stopped carefully, the great thing to guard against being the admission of warm air. At the entrance to the passage have another tight- fitting door. By great caution, Ice may be kept in this manner through a long summer^ although each time the well is opened a little warm air will get in. If you have a cool dairy, let your Ice- house be built at the side of this, entering from the dairy. This arrangement serves a double purpose : the Ice cools the dairy in the warm months, and the low temperature of the place does not thaw so quickly the frozen mass within. Supposing the Ice-house is to be above-ground, you may build it in the same style as the pre- ceding, covering it over with several cart-loads of dry straw or leaves, fastened down by a tliatched roof. Should the inner covering of straw or leaves get wet, fermentation will probably ensue, and the Ice within soon melt. Guard against this. Choose a dry time for putting the Ice, broken

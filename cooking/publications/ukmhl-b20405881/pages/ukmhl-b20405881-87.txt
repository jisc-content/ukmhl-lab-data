PRESERVED FRUITS. 47 cold water, boil your syrup to the " Small Thread." Thoroughly drain and dry your Oranges, and drop them into the syrup. Give the whole a few boils; cover over slightly, and put the pan in a corner for twenty-four hours. Now proceed as with other fruit: drain your Oranges, boil up the syrup again, skim it, pour over your fruit, and let them cool again for twenty-four hours. Do this the next day. On the day following add fresh syrup to the old, if some is wanted ; boil to the " Large Pearl," put in the Oranges, give one boil up, skim when off, and lay by for use. 59. Ornamental Lemons. As in the case of the preceding, select good fruit. Lemons with smooth skins are the best for this purpose. Proceed as with Ornamental Oranges (No. 58). 60. Orange Chips and Rings, Select those Oranges with thick peels. Then, with a handy little knife, cut or pare off the peel (as you would an apple) in one or two long shav- ings or curls. Cut off the peel as thick as possible, without taking off any of the actual fruit, and see that what you cut off is of a uniform thickness. Another plan is to slice the peel across so as to form rings. As you cut, let them drop into cold water.

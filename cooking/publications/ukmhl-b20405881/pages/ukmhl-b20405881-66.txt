Mash thoroughly, until the mixture looks like thick milk, and no pieces of Almonds are left, then add another pint of the spring-water. Now squeeze the white mash through a hair-cloth, or other good strainer. A common plan is to have a large strainer held by two persons. As they twist, the milk may be caught in a clean basin. Whatever of the Almonds is left in the cloth, put it back into the mortar, and mash it over again, adding a little of the spring-water. Then strain it, and mix with the former Almond milk. This done, mix it with your sugar (about six pounds), which must first, however, be clarified and boiled to a " Crack." Whilst adding the Almond milk, let the pan of hot sugar be off the fire. When mixed, give another boil up, then remove the pan from the fire, and stir the syrup until cold.^ Pour in a small portion of the tincture of orange flowers, or the least drop of the essence of neroli, and pass the mixture again through a cloth. Give the bottles an occasional shake for a few days afterwardsâ€”it will keep the Syrup from parting. * This is done by confectioners to keep it from separating and splitting up after being bottled.

CHAPTER XL BOTTLED FRUITS. 122. On Bottled Fruits for Ices, Tarts, &e. Choose some wide-mouth Bottles, and fill them with Fruit, then cork them with Fruit corks, which are different to others, from being cut the contrary way of the grain. Now tie the corks down with wire, or string, and place them upright in a copper, with cold water up to their necks, and gradually heat them up to two hundred degrees of the thermometer. They ought to be one hour and a half getting to this degree. Let the Fruit be in the water till quite cold ; then take them out, and pack them in straw, with the corks downwards. The mouths of the bottles may be covered with melted resin or bottle-wax. In selecting the Fruit, care should be taken to see it is clean and free from any unnatural dampness ; and it should always be gathered on a dry day, and, if possible, bottled at once, whilst still perfectly fresh.

238 APPENDIX. MACEDOINE OF VAEIOUS FEUITS. 396. Macedoine of Oranges. Select four good oranges, the thinnest rind ones are preferable; cut them crosswise into slices double the thickness of a crown-piece; dress them round your dish, one piece resting half-way on the other; sift one ounce of powdered sugar over, pour over a good tablespoonful of brandy, and it will be ready to serve. Put two pieces on the plate of each guest, with a spoonful of syrup. SHces of red Maltese oranges, dressed alternately with the other kind, give a pleasing effect. Any kind of liquors may be chosen. 397. Macedoine of Strawberries. FiEST pick off the stalks of a pottle of fine British Qaeen^s strawberries, the fruit of which put into a basin with half a teaspoonful of powdered ciimamon, two glasses of brandy, and one ounce of powdered sugar; toss them lightly over, and dress in pyramids upon your dish, pouring the syrup over them, which has been previously made. These should only be dressed a few minutes before serving: the brandy might be omitted; a glass of Maraschino substituted for brandy makes them delicious.

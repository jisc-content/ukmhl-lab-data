UTENSILS AND TOOLS. 3 Figure 5.—Stove, made of sheet iron, generally of a square cupboard shape. This apparatus has been in use for many years, and its completeness is a matter of essential importance to the con- fectioner. As a rule, it should contain three shelves or rests, which will hold nine tins. Holes are bored in the sides of the stoves, so that the shelves inside can be tilted, and the syrup gently poured off. A pin of iron, or piece of wood, is used to raise or lower the shelf of tins ; the tins should be fastened securely to the shelves. Under the tins there should be a large pan, to collect the syrup that drains from the nine tins above; this pan has a funnel-shaped bottom, to permit of the drainings flowing into the utensil underneath. This sheet-iron cupboard is heated by means of hot air conveyed in a pipe (which ought to enter at the bottom) from the regular stove. The heat should be kept at about 110 to 130 degrees. A small hole, or ventilator, may be made at the top of the door, to moderate the heat as required. A clock should be within sight, to notify the exact time the syrup has been in the stove.—Plate 11. Figure 6.—Steaineks. These consist of a flan- nel bag (or one made of cloth), a hair sieve, and one made of wire. The neck of the flannel bag is sometimes suspended from a large iron ring attached to a bracket, as shown in the illustration 1? 2

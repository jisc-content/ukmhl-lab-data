Around this column have some pieces of the baked almond paste, as supports. When they are all sufficiently dry, join the pieces very neatly to each other; then place it in the stove. You will require enough syrup to fill the cavity forming the lake. Take some syrup and boil it to the ''Blow,^' then pour it into the mould to a height that will represent the water of the lake. Have ready some little ducks or swans modelled out in Gum Paste. Put them into the syrup at various points. Now put it into the stove again for three hours. Take it out, and make a small hole in the bottom, or at one side of your paste, to draw off the syrup. After the syrup has run out, a crust will remain, bearing on its top the ducks or swans, thus resembling water. Build the rock on the column in the centre with pieces of rock sugar, biscuits, and other suitable articles in sugar, joined to each other and fixed to the supporting column. Cement the whole together with " Caramel," and add any further ornaments you think will be appropriate to the lake scene you are depicting. If you v>^ish to represent a waterfall, you must use spun sugar; the moulding, &c., is made of Almond Paste, pushed through a machine, not worked with the hand.

14 THE MODERN CONFECTIONER. of our art; and the difference in Sugars is very great. 2. On Clarifying Loaf Sugar. Take a copper pan, and into it put your Sugar broken in small pieces. The pan should be suf- ficiently large to allow the scum to rise a little without boiling over. One pint of water to every two pounds of Sugar may be added. Beat up the whites of two eggs (if you are clarifying about ten pounds of Sugar, or mix in this proportion) until it is very frothy, and then mix it with the rest. Now place the pan on the fire^ and have ready some cold water. When the mixture begins to boil, and rise to the top of the pan, throw in a little of the water to prevent the Sugar running over. You must let the Sugar rise three times before commencing to skim it, each time cooling the mixture by the cold water just spoken of. The fourth time the Sugar rises skim it completely, and drop the cold v/ater gently in as occasion may require, continuing to take the scum* off (which is rather white) until no more comes upon the surface. The Sugar must now be strained through a fine sieveâ€”one made of cloth, or a flannel bag, will do. In order to make Clarified Sugar extra white, The scum need not be thrown away ; after a quantity is col- lected, it can Ije clarified.

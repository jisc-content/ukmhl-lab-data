APPENDIX. 216 421. Ratafia d'Abricots. Take twenty-five apricots, cut into pieces; take out the kernels, peel and crush them in a mortar; put ail together in a jar with half a pound of sugar, eight cloves, a little cinnamon, and one quart of brandy. Stop the jar close; infuse for three weeks, when pass through a flannel bag and bottle. Peaches are very good treated in the same manner. 422. Noyau. Take a handful of the young sprouts of the peach tree, pour over them two quarts of brandy, and let the whole stand three days to extract the fine flavour of the leaves. When this has been done remove the leaves and add the brandy, with two quarts clarified sugar and quarter of a pound of blanched almonds, cut small; let the whole stand six weeks, when strain and bottle.

ON COMFITS. 187 much gum in tlie first charges, as you will make them too damp. When the gum is dry and firm upon them, commence with the syrup. At first pour over them but very little, and see that you do not disturb the gum coating. Now continue with the syrup, giving the Almonds five or six charges, small at first, but increasing the quantity of syrup a little each time. Let each charge be well dried before another is given. Having now charged them six or seven times, the next charge must con- sist of half gum (dissolved) and half syrup. Swing the pan with your right hand, and, to prevent their sticking together, pass your left through them every time you swing the pan. This also is to make them smooth. Do not let the heat under the pan be too strong, or it will spoil their whiteness. Continue charging them until you have made the Comfits the proper size. Every tenth charge sift them in a hair sieve, to clear them from the sugar-dust, which is formed in shaking the Comfits. The pan too, must be cleaned as aften as it gets coated with sugar. Having made the Comfits sufficiently large, put them in a sieve, and dry them in the stove for a few hours. Take some double-refined sugar, clarify and boil it to the " Large Thread."

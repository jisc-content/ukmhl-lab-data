Mix in another bowl the yolks of four eggs, and a quarter of a pound of very fine biscuit powder, the rind of four lemons with the juice of two, add a quarter of a pound of powdered sugar; beat these all well up together till a stiff cream is formed, when pour the whole gently into the bowl with the curd; mix them well together, and line some tartlette pans, previously buttered, with thin puff-paste, and fill up with the above mixture.

Place in a stewpan one pound of white sugar, four eggs, with the yolks only of two, three finger biscuits grated, the juice of three lemons, and the rinds well rubbed with sugar, then add half a pound of fresh butter; place the stewpan over a slow fire; stir until the mixture takes the appearance of honey, when it may be put by in a jar for use; it will keep for years. Any flavour, such as vanilla or cinnamon, may be added at will. If required for use, having made the paste, line the tins, mix a tablespoonful of the mixture with a teacupful of good milk, and put a little in each tartlette, and bake in a quick oven for fifteen minutes.

PREFACE TO NEW EDITION. brandy, rosewater, essences, &c., may be omitted without any essential deviation of flavour or diminution of appearance on serving, retaining, however, the given proportions of sugar, eggs> butter, flour, &c.; but if made at home, and by a person that may be trusted, it will be found that any of these articles may be made in the most liberal manner at one half the cost, generally hitherto involved. They will also be found particularly useful to families that live in the country, or in small towns, where nothing of the kind is to be purchased. W. Jeanes.

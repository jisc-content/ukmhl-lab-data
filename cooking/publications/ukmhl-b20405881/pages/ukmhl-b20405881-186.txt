Take a clean earthenware pan, put the floar (free from all lumps) into it, then pour in gradually the milk and yeast, stirring the flour all the time, until you have a thoroughly smooth paste. Now stand the pan in the stove for a short time, until the paste rises. Take a lemon and rasp the outside rind on a piece of rough loaf sugar, or on a common nutmeg grater ; if on the former, then scrape off the sugar impregnated with the lemon. Now beat up the yolks, and add the lemon flavouring along with the butter, which you have melted. When the paste in the stove has sufiiciently risen, add these; mix together thoroughly. Whisk up the whites to a froth, and stir in with the rest; flien take a small quantity of fresh cream (a table- spoonful), whisk it up, and add it. While you are getting your Wafer-tongs ready, put the pan back into the stove, for the paste to rise a second time. The pan should be a large one, as the paste will rise high. The tongs usually used are square, and not round as shown in Figure 15, Plate V. The cavities to contain the Wafers should be three-eighths, or half an inch deep. You heat them, and brush over the insides with a little butter, as in No. 246. (See the instruc- tions there given for filling and turning the tongs.) These Flemish Wafers should be done to a good colour, laid on plates, with pounded loaf sugar

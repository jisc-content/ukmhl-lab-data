CHAPTER XIX. ON CRYSTALLIZATION. 297. General Remarks on Crystallization. Provide yourself with a square tin box similar to Figure 9, Plate IV., sufficiently large to receive con- veniently a wire grating. This shallow tin box must have a hole at one end with a tube or pipe (see Fig. 9, Plate IV.) to admit a cork, whence the syrup may be drained off. Place inside the confections you wish to crystallize ; they must not touch, and should only be placed one row deep. Now put some sugar in a copper pan with sufficient cold water to moisten it; put on the fire, and boil to the " Small Thread."" Keep the sides of the pan clean with a sponge while boiling. Remove from the fire and add a little spirits of wine; put in a cold place to cool; then fill your tins, and place paper on the top of the crystallized articles. It will be ready to drain off in two days; place the articles on hair sieves to dry.

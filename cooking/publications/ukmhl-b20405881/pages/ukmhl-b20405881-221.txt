181 ON CARAMEL. have sufficiently cooled for you to take it into your bands ; then turn the edges quickly into the middle, twist and fold the sugar over, and work it until it is quite white, and shines like silver. Now divide it into two parts. One portion you colour with a little powdered carmine, using it as dry as possible ; the other must be kept white. An assistant should help you with one of these, Avhilst you work the other. Twist and work thoroughly until each portion is quite bright; then unite them, and form a ball of the two co- lours. Flatten the ball in strings between your finger and thumb, and roll it on long rollers, v/hich rollers should be much thicker at one end than the other. When the Ribbon is rolled around the stick, it should be so done that it can be taken off without breaking. Sometimes three or four co- lours are put into one Ribbon; but then there should be three or four assistants to work the portions. When done, you may form it into any shape you think properâ€”lovers' knots, twists, ties, rings, &c.

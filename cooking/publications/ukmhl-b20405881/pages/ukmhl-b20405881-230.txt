190 THE MODERN CONFECTIONER. See No. 326, Kose Comfits, for method of fla- vouring them; the distilled water of the flowers is added to the sugar when clarifying it. To colour them, add the tint to the syrup for the last ten charges. 328. Celery Comfits. Y(Ju use Celery Seeds. See that they are clean. Put them in a pan, with a fire or chafing-dish be- neath (heating them but very little), and charge them with syrup prepared without gum. Work them with both hands. After they have become the size of a large pin's head, dry them in the stove for thirty-six hours. When they are thoroughly dry, put them back into the pan, and give them seven or eight charges of the syrup made with the extra white crystallized sugar. This will make them white. Dry them thoroughly after each charge, and put them in the stove until next day, when they must be put in the balancing-pan. Boil some syrup to the " Pearl," and pour it into the small funnel suspended over the pan (see Fi- gure 27, Plate VII.)J then remove the spigot, so as to allow the syrup to run in a very small stream, or more like a continued dropping; swing the pan backwards and forwards gently. See that the syrup does not wet the Comfits too much. Finish them as other Comfits.

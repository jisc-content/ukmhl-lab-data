ON CHOCOLATE. mixed, then put it in a pan, and place it in the stove to keep warm. Take a portion of it and roll or grind it well on the stone slab with the roller (both being previously heated like the mortar), until it is reduced to a smooth^ impalpable paste, which will melt in the mouth like butter. When this is accomplished, put it in another pan, and keep it warm until the whole is similarly disposed of; then place it again on the stone, which must not be quite so warm as previously; work it over again, and divide it into pieces of two, four, eight, or sixteen ounces each, which you put in tin moulds. Give it a shake, and the Chocolate will become flat. When cold, it will easily turn out. In making Harlequin Pistachios, you warm some of this sweet chocolate by pounding it in a hot mortar. After it has been prepared in this manner, take some of it and wrap it round a blanched pistachio nut; roll it in the hand to give it the form of an olive; throv/ it into Nonpareils of mixed colours, so that it may be variously coloured, d la Harlequin. Proceed with the re- maining pistachio nuts after the same fashion, dropping them into the Nonpareils, so that the comfits will adhere to the pisiachios ; fold them in coloured or fancy papers, with mottoes; the ends are generally fringed.

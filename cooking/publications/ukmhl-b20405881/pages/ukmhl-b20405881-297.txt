APPENDIX. 245 Strain the jaice through flannel bags; pound the stones till all are broken, and put them into a stone jar ; pour brandy enough over to cover them, and set in a jar of water on the fire. When boiling strain through the bags, and add to the whole two pounds of lump sugar. Boil and skim, and when cold add to the juice. Flavour with brandy according to taste, and put the whole into a stone jar. Shake it daily four days, let it settle four more, when it will be fit to rack and bottle, or ready for immediate use. Another way. Merely pick the cherries and put them into brandy, cover over with sugar and seal dcwn; in six months the same is ready for use. Another method is to stone twenty pounds of black cherries, bruise the stones in a mortar, and steep the cherries in two gallons of best brandy; let it stand for six weeks, then rack it off and bottle. Murillo cherries answer best with brandy. 420. CuraQoa. Take two quarts of brandy, one pound and a half of brown sugar-candy, and the peel of three Seville oranges, pared as thin as possible. Infuse them for six weeks, stirring every three days till the sugar- candy is dissolved. Filter through blotting-paper, and bottle.

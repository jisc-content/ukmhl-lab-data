30 THE MODEPvN CONFECTIONER. The Violet Syrup sold in shops is often adulte- rated. 28, Grape Synip. li| pint Water, i pint Sherry, J lb. Elder Flowers, 3 lbs. Sugar. Made the same way as Violet Syrup (No. 27). 29. Raspberry Vinegar Syrup. 3 J lbs. Sugar, 1 pint Kaspberry Juice, 2 pints Vinegar. As in making Kaspberry Syrup (No. 15), white or red fruit may be used. White Easpberries, how- ever, require the best loaf sugar and white-wine vinegar, so as not to discolour the Syrup. Clean the raspberries, mash them in a pan, and put in a warm place for a day or two, until they ferment. Strain them, and pour in the vinegar. Strain again, add the sugar, and boil to the Pearl.^' Another plan is, to take whole Easpberries (say two pounds, one pint and a half of vinegar, and two pounds of sugar), and put them in the vinegar, and stand the jar, well covered, in a shady place for ten days. At the expiration of this time filter the mixture, add the sugar, and place the jar in a pan of hot water, and boil gently. This mode preserves the finer qualities of the fruit, which are not partially lost by bailing, as in the previous method.

228 APPENDIX. 375. Richmond Maids of Honour. These delicious little cakes, which every Londoner who has visited the most picturesque part of its environs knows so well, derive their name from a period when confectionery was not thought to be a degrading occupation. Those honoured by that title it is stated, originated with the Maids of Honour of Queen Elizabeth, who had a palace at Richmond. I have a little work before me called " The Queen^s Delight,''' in which are several receipts the production of the first nobles of the land, which I think will prove an excellent example for those housewives who honour the book by their perusal, to imitate. They are made as follows: Sift half a pound of dry curd, mix it well with six ounces of butter; break the yolks of four eggs into another basin, with a wineglass of brandy, add to it six ounces of powdered lump sugar, and beat well together; add baked mealy potatoes, cold, one ounce sweet almonds, one ounce bitter almonds, pounded, the grated rinds of three lemons with the juice of one and a half, and a nutmeg grated; mix these well together, and add to the curds; proceed as with cheesecakes above, and fill the tartlette pans well up with the mixture.

JELLIES. 69 103. Cherry Jelly. Select some fine Cherries, take off the stalks, and remove the stones. To fom- pounds of Cher- ries add one pound of red currants. Proceed as for Currant Jelly (No. 97). 104. Apple Clear Cakes. Any of the foregoing jellies will answer our pur- pose, if they have not been boiled too much. If you wish to make them from the fruit, however, take the juice of your fruit, filter it (as if for a jelly); to a pint of juice, red or white, add one pound of loaf sugar, stir it thoroughly into the juice, put it in a pan on the fire, let the mixture boil but slightly, and then pour it into small pots, moulds, or glasses, so as to form Cakes about half- an-inch thick, and place these in the stove, which should not bo too hot, or they will melt instead of forming a jelly. About seventy-five or eighty degrees, Fahrenheit, is sufficient. When a crust has formed on the top, take out the Cakes by care- fully turning the knife round the sides of the pot. As they are turned out, lay them on clean plates of tin or pewter, and dry on the other side. When dried, they can be cut into diamonds, squares, or any other shape.

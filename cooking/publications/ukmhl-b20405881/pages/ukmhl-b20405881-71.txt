CHAPTER Y. PRESERVED FRUITS. 30. General Remarks on Preserved Fruits. There are two kinds of Preserves, wet and dryâ€” the former requiring niiicli more sugar than the latter. The first operation generally is to blanch the fruit in boiling water; then drain the fruit, and put it into the boiling syrup. Remove from the fire, and let the mixture stand for some hours; after this strain off the juice, and add more sugar ; then boil as before. This must be continued until the juice of the fruit is thoroughly extracted. Preserves should be stored in a dry room or cup- board, not too warm, as heat causes fermentation. A damp room will make them mouldy. Some confectioners recommend a little alum-water when the Preserve is extra sweet, to prevent candying. During the process, the fruit should not be bruised, or the skin broken (except a little pricking, which admits the syrup) any more than can be helped. If the fruit is required to be preserved green, add a little soda or common salt to some w^arm water,

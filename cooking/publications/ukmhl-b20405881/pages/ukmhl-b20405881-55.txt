Beat up well a couple of eggs (supposing ten pounds of Sugar are being clarified), and add some ivory black, about a pound. See that the ivory black is thoroughly mixed into the water. The mixture should now be made as hot as possible, but without being allowed to boil. If symptoms of boiling and rising appear, instantly add a drop of cold water. Having thoroughly melted the mixture, strain as before through a fine cloth^ or flannel strainer. The syrup need not be heated any more, but it will have to be strained three or four times, until it is oxtra fine and clear. This exquisitely trans- parent Clarified Sugar is of much use for makiog the finer sorts of Confectionery. 3. On Clarifying Brown or Moist Sugar. Here, again, take care the pan is large enough to allow the syrup to rise without immediately boiling over. Brown Sugar does not require so much water as Loaf. A quart will be sufficient for five or six pounds of Moist Sugar. Thoroughly beat up one egg (the yolk had better be omitted, as it will only rise-with the scum, and be skimmed off), and, as must be observed in the case of Loaf Sugar, mix

Press in all the other pieces in the same way, and then let them dry, taking care nothing touches the bottom of the sieve. When the paste is sufficiently set for the Biscuit to stand upon the Moss part,with- out its sinking in or giving way, remove them from the sieve, and bake in a gentle oven on plates, with sheets of cartridge paper underneath. 231.

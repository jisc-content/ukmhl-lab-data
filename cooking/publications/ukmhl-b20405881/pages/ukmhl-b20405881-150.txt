CHAPTER XV. ON BISCUITS AND CAKES. 187. The Oven. Before entering at large upon this Chapter, it will be necessary to say a few words upon the Oven. Although found in very few houses, the old-fashioned brick and Cement Oven is far pre- ferable to the modern Stove, or iron Oven. Farm- house bread, baked in brick Ovens, is much sweeter than that made in Town. The brick Oven should be built on one side, or in the corner, of a large fire-place, about breast high. The top should be arched. Faggots of hedge-wood, branches of trees, turf, and live ashes from a large fire, are variously used to heat it in different localities. When it is properly and uniformly heated, rake out the ashes, clean with a birch-broom, run a damp mop around, then close the door for a few minutes, for the heat to equaUze itself. When the glow has moderated, and become general, the Oven is ready to receive what you propose to bake.

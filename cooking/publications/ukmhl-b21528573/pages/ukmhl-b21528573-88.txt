Meat contains a large proportion of a substance called albumen, which coagulates and hardens on the application of heat in exactly the same way as the white of an egg, which is almost pure albumen, hardens when boiled. If, therefore, meat be cooked for a long time at a high temperature, albumen—which, by the way, is the nourishing or flesh-forming part— becomes gradually hardened through, is made tough and indigestible, and its food value greatly lessened.

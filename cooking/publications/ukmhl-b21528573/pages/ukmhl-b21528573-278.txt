The Doleful Departure. 260 ways, conspicuous for his amiability, but he suffers from ‘ too-soonism; ’ he is one of those who like to be in a station three-quarters of an hour before the train starts. ‘Humour him,’ says Philomela, ‘and take a book or a magazine in your pocket.’ We do humour him; so, as he was going to escort Delecta to the station, I did not dare to ask her what was in her folded documents. Away went the cab bumpity-bump—oh, what a road! Will the Hillsborians never have proper roads ? — Delecta waving her bunch of honey- suckle, and the Babushka anxiously looking at his watch. I returned to the house and solemnly opened Delecta’s last instructions. The first paper was really a monument of good advice, the Code Napoleon in matters culinary. I read it to Philomela, who, I fear, did not listen. HINTS TO REMEMBER. 1. Never cook by guesswork. Weigh out every ingredient carefully and accurately. 2. Never slam the oven door. It spoils puddings, cakes, and pastry.

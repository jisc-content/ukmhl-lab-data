The Joyful Arrival of Delecta. 67 I tried to persuade her, but Philomela would not move. She said the lightning would be worse in the upstairs rooms, and she was quite right—it was. Gradually the thunder and lightning died away and the rain ceased; but it came on again with redoubled fury in the middle of the night, when I really thought the roof was coming in. I heard Philly’s voice wailing for Lesbia, and found her sitting up in bed perfectly convinced that the cottage had been struck by lightning. It really was a terrible night. I felt quite sorry that our welcome to Delecta had been heralded with alarms and excursions, and that her visit to Vine Cottage had begun by meeting ‘ Jupiter with thunderbolts ’!

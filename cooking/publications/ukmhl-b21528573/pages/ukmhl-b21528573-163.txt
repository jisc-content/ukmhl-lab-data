Lightsome Luncheons. 147 MERINGUE BISCUIT CREAM. BUY some pink meringue biscuits (they cost a halfpenny each); make a round basket of them by standing them up on end and sticking each biscuit to the next one with a little sugar. As the biscuits make rather a deep basket, you can place some sponge-cake fingers soaked in a little maras- chino at the foot. Now whip half a pint of cream, colour a pretty pink, and flavour either with a few drops of maraschino or some strawberry-juice. Fill your basket, and decorate with whole fresh straw- berries, or crystallised rose-leaves, or glace cherries. ‘Of course you can, if you like, make pink meringues, and fill them with pink cream; but meringues are somewhat troublesome, and the biscuits do perfectly well.’ ANCHOVY CREAMS, sufficient cream for the number of neat rounds of toast you require, with, added to the cream, one tea-spoonful of anchovy paste and a pinch of cayenne. Spread the cream on the toast nice and full, and place in the centre of each round one stoned Spanish olive wrapped round a small quantity of pounded anchovies.

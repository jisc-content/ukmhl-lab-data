The Joyful Arrival of Delecta. 66 one stands good, kind-hearted, worried little Johnny Crow, doing all he can for his friends, who, I fear, were not sufficiently grateful—a failing not confined to lions (by the way, there is a conspicuously grateful story-book lion) or beavers. Philomela gave the book to Delecta and went and sat with her back to the window—I must say the flashes of lightning were somewhat appalling—said she was too reduced even to play ‘ Miss Milligan/ and of all ‘ Patiences ’ she is certainly the best. Batiushka suggested we should play ‘Pit’ and then we shouldn’t hear the thunder! But no one had sufficient nerve to sit down and shout, ‘Trade two, Trade two/ with the thunder crashing and rolling over our heads, and the room every few minutes being vividly lit by a piercing flame. Mercifully, through it all the rain continued to fall—less violently but with extreme steadiness. A thunderstorm never seems quite so terrible when there is rain. Poor Vine Cottage seemed to rock and sway with every crash—purely our imagination. Philomela stoutly maintains she felt an earthquake! But Philly’s nerves were de- moralised by the lightning. ‘ Delecta, you look very tired after your long, hot journey, so I will take you off to bed; and, Philly, I would advise you to come out of your dark corner and go to bed too.’

Delectable Dinners. 189 small shalot or two spring onions, a few mushrooms, and a piece of fat of bacon the size of a walnut, all chopped very, very fine. Add white pepper and salt. Now put little patches of butter on your fireproof dish, spread the seasoning mixture, and lay your sole—a large, thick one—on the mixture, and cover it with the same. Pour over all one glass of white French wine—Sauterne, Grave, or Chablis —with one glass of good white stock. Finish up with a slight layer of raspings of bacon fat and a few drops of butter. Put the whole into a quick oven. It takes about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes to cook, but of course you must be careful that your oven is not too fierce. CHICKEN IN ASPIC. |^INE some small dariole-moulds with liquid aspic; garnish the outsides with strips of cooked chicken, tomato, and chopped truffle. Whip half a pint of cream and stir into it one tea-cupful of finely chopped chicken, chopped truffle, and a little chopped tarragon. (If you cannot procure fresh tarragon-leaves, a few drops of tarragon vine- gar will do.) Season with pepper and salt. Add to this mixture a quarter of a pint of liquid aspic. Keep in a cool place till the shapes have begun to set, and then fill them with the chicken mixture.

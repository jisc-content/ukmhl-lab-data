I need hardly say that all jellies can be made with flavourings of vanilla, &c., omitting wines or spirits. pUT into a stewpan J pint water, pints claret, \ pint lemon-juce, i|- oz. leaf-gelatine, one table-spoonful of red-currant jelly, 6 oz. sugar, a few drops of red colouring, and the whites and shells of three eggs. Whisk over the fire till it boils, then place the lid partially on and leave for fifteen minutes. Pass through a clean jelly-bag and run into a damp mould.

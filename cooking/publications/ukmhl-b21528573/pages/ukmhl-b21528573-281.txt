But I do not think it is at all dull; I think it is very useful, and I shall certainly have it framed and hung up on the kitchen wall. I hope the new cook will attend to it. For there must be a new cook. Delecta is right: ‘ Civilised man cannot live without cooks; ’ and I cannot spend my days in a town kitchen, though with Delecta’s teaching I feel quite equal to the task. But there are other things in life than entre'es and savouries—things that have to be done. Still, I shall certainly bake my cakes and make dishes when I want to, as the new cook seems amiable. I trust we may get on well together without friction — without my hearing that well-worn remark, 4 It’s my kitchen, ma’am; ’ or the other remark, ‘Leave the recipe with me, ma’am; don’t you bother yourself,’ when you want to ‘bother yourself’ and try something fascinatingly new! If I have a very attractive and ornamental frame made for Delecta’s 4 Handy Measures,’ perhaps the new cook will look upon it as a decoration, and not feel insulted or oppressed by the fact that I mean her to measure her quantities.

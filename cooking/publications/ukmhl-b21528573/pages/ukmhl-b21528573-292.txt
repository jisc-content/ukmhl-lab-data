274 We Make the Christmas Pudding. Christmas Carol, and if at Christmas-time there is one being towards whom I do not feel really Christmasy, it is Mr Supercilious who sneers at Bob Cratchit! Every one in the house must stir the Christmas pudding—stir it three times round, wishing hard all the time, and you must see the bottom of the basin. If you don’t you will never, never get your wish! Philomela says our plum-pudding is the very most superior pudding, and the reason is, I think, be- cause we use creme de riz flour (Mrs Marshall’s) instead of ordinary flour. \>TIX together i lb. stoned raisins, i lb. cleaned currants, x lb. finely chopped beef suet, i lb. fine bread-crumbs, 2 apples cut into small dice, 1 tea-spoonful ground ginger, 1 tea-spoonful ground cinnamon, 1 tea-spoonful salt, 1 tea-spoonful grated nutmeg, 2 oz. minced orange and lemon peel, 1 oz. blanched and chopped almonds, and 3 oz. creme de riz. Beat 4 eggs with £ lb. good brown sugar; add 2 glasses of brandy and J tea-cupful of milk. Now mix this with your pudding, and if it seems too stiff add a little more milk. Put into a buttered basin covered with a greased and floured PLUM-PUDDING. 4>

52 The Joyful Arrival of Delecta. looking out of the window, I cannot help thinking of the little cookery-book. I must certainly tell Delecta about the recipes for quickly made beef- tea and special restorative for invalids. QUICKLY MADE BEEP-TEA. WIPE carefully i lb. of lean, juicy beef, and shred it finely on a board; put it in a basin with i pint of cold water and i tea-spoonful of salt, and, if possible, allow it to stand for half-an-hour covered with a plate. Then pour the contents of the basin into a lined saucepan, place over a slow fire, and with two forks whisk it well till it almost reaches boiling-point. Do not let it boil. Draw the pan to the side of the fire, put on the lid, and allow the beef to simmer very slowly from ten to fifteen minutes. Strain through a coarse strainer, pressing all the juice out of the meat, and remove all the fat before serving. SPECIAL RESTORATIVE. 'Tâ€™AKE six fresh (new-laid) eggs, wash well, and dry; lay them in a bowl large enough to allow them to lie flat and not to touch. Squeeze the juice out of six large lemons (no pips); pour on to the eggs. Cover up and leave all night.

We go to Vine Cottage. 2 Never eat it if you can possibly avoid it. When I even nibble it I develop a severe attack of Groceritis! Philomela says, ‘ Groceritis is only imagination.’ She also asks (when I bewail my culinary deficiencies), ‘ Why eat a stodgy cake baked on the premises when you can buy a really good one in a shop?’ If I try to explain that the principle of the purchased cake is bad, she only replies, ‘ I much prefer the good cake of no principles to the indi- gestible, damp-in-the-middle one whose principles are irreproachable and that tastes of baking soda.’ Philomela has no sympathy with my cooking aspirations. I consulted her about having cookery lessons, and all she said was, ‘ Much you learnt the last time.’ This is quite true (if rather rude); but still, I had only one lesson. They set me to fillet a sole. It sounds easy and simple. Try it. The instructress was patient and kind. She said the bits and crumbs would make nice fish-balls and the cat would enjoy the skin; also that it was better not to be afraid of the sole, but to grasp it firmly. The fish inter- lude was so clammy and depressing that I hailed Genoese pastry with delight. It was most attractive and puffed up beautifully, and I was inordinately proud—nearly as much puffed up as the pastry.

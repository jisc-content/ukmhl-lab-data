172 Triumphant Teas. Good Samaritan’s garden.—Batiushka, come and make claret-cup.’ The Batiushka responds with alacrity, and they both disappear into the house, leaving me to listen to Delecta. ‘You told me, Lesbia, your cakes were often wrong. Now do try to look interested, like a good girl, while I read you some notes on cake- making. ‘ “ The most common failure in cake-making— at least in those cakes that are known as plain mixture (where the fat is less than half the pro- portion of flour)—is owing to the fat not being sufficiently rubbed in. Then very often the mix- ture is far too damp. Then, too, the raising agent, either in the form of baking powder, car- bonate of soda, or Paisley flour, is used without caution. Too much of any of these will make the cake dry and full of holes, while the exces- sive use of soda gives that unpleasant soapy taste. Careful measurement of the raising agent is absolutely necessary, and it must be thoroughly mixed with the flour. The best plan is to pass the flour and baking powder backwards and forwards through a fine sieve. If you use carbonate of soda for your cakes, you must also use an acid—either sour-milk or cream of tartar.

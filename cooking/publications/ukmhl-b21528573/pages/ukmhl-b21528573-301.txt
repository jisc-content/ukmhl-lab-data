A. c. 2 j RIZ A L’IMPERATRICE. ^ASH 3 oz. Carolina rice and stew gently in i pint milk till the milk is absorbed. Add 3 oz. sugar. Now melt J oz. leaf-gelatine in £ pint of water, and strain to the rice. When it cools, mix with | pint whipped cream, flavour with vanilla, and pour into a damp mould. ‘The rice sounds rather tame after all the other recipes,’ said Philomela; ‘ but I expect Delecta thinks you are going to give a children’s Christmas party.’ ‘Whom for? You?’ Philomela is rather indignant, but she is sure the rice cream would be a good, wholesome dish for children, and I think she is quite right. It would be nicer than blanc-manges, even though they are coloured most artistically. I remember one child at its own party wailing out in a voice of bitter disappointment, ‘ Mother, mother, you promised they would be creams, and they’re only nasty, nasty corn-flour shapes ! ’ It is rather difficult to know what children will like, but I think Italian oranges and an American trifle would meet with their approval.

When I gave you such lovely recipes, and so many hints, to talk of meat eaten raw! ’ Delecta is quite offended. But I cannot help feeling primitive man had his advantages when he walked by his ‘wild lone in the wild wet woods ; ’ he was never worried over meals, and he never gave coloured luncheons !

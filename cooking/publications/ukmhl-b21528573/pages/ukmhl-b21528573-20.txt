There is a subtle way of huddling up and pushing out of sight a cheap silk that is a positive art. It’s just the same with bacon. You read in the useful cookery-book: ‘A really excellent bacon can be bought for fivepence half- penny the pound.’ Charmed with the vision of what you are going to save on the family breakfast, you sally forth, and return—with the same old bacon at elevenpence.

No notice is taken of the inherently evil dis- position of inanimate objects. Onions, for example —no, not onions; they are not inanimate, but very, very much the reverse. The front page of a cookery- book should have in large letters : ‘ Buy an onion- knife, and never, never, never let any other object touch an onion.’

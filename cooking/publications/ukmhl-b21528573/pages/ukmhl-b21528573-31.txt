17 We go to Vine Cottage. I don’t mind the road, for I mean to go to Vine Cottage. Isn’t that a most attractive name ? When I talked it over at breakfast and mentioned the name, Philomela shrieked—yes, shrieked is the only word— ‘ Mention Omar Khayyam at peril of your life.’ Of course I was just going to—can we ever hear of vines without thinking of Omar ?—but seeing the gleam in Philomela’s eye, I refrained. The Batiushka has satisfactorily negotiated with the landlady, and she has kindly promised to find ‘a nice girl from the village’ for me. We are all looking forward to the country, and I look forward to being monarch of the kitchen, with one willing henchwoman. But will she be willing ? ‘ Ay, there’s the rub.’ The thought of the cooking fills me with some apprehension and misgiving, but I have a perfect library of cookery-books, and surely, surely all these volumes must teach me something! Philomela is taking stacks of luggage ; not only body-clothes and head-coverings, but every kind of apparatus and implement she needs for her various employments. My heart rather sank when I saw the wood-carving tools also going for change of air and scene. I had hoped to be spared the chipping. Philomela wanted to go over to Hillsboro’ and inspect the piano, but I put my foot down on that J3 c A. C.

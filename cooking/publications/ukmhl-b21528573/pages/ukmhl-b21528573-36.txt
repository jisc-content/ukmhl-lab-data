However, there was nothing for it but to find out, so with much dignity I walked through to the kitchen, followed by Philo- mela; and there, sure enough, was ‘an awful child,’ but no Harriet. The awful one was seated on a chair in front of the kitchen fire toasting her long thin legs, encased in elaborate, open-work, white-knitted stockings, contentedly munching something pink and white and sticky, suggestive of‘four a penny.’ No way abashed by our severe appearance, she continued to munch like the sailor’s wife in Macbeth, and took no notice of us. ‘ What are you doing here, little girl ? ’ I asked, looking as forbidding as possible. From a mouth stuffed full of sweet-stuff came one word that sounded like ‘ Coomtarry-coomtstay.’ I looked helplessly at Philomela: did she, with her alert and active brain, understand this occult utterance ?

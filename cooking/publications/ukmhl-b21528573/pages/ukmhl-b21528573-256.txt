Superb Suppers. U 238 * Don’t whisper, Philly. It is very wrong to waste good food, and you know it is quite as well as I do. Now subside, and listen to these notes I have written out on the subject of jelly-making. Jelly comes, in some form or other, into so many of the prettiest sweets that it is extremely impor- tant that it should be good.’ JELLIES seem to present many difficulties, if we judge from the varying results obtained by people who consider themselves fairly good cooks. Jellies as stiff as glue, jellies that collapse as they leave the moulds, are both quite unneces- sary trials. Accuracy is the ‘ open sesame ’ to the art of jelly-making; if the proper proportions are rigidly adhered to, the jelly must be of the right consistency. First of all take care to have a reliable gelatine. If sheet-gelatine be used, it may be put with the other ingredients into the pan and the jelly-making proceeded with. All other kinds of gelatine need steeping in a little cold liquid, but this must be deducted from the whole amount of liquid used or the proportion will be wrong and the jelly will fall.

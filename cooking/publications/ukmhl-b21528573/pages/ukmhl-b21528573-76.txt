The Joyful Arrival of Delecta. 60 Philomela answers for him: ‘ My dear, he sold it for three pounds.- Brand new, too. Pie fell off it so often, and every time he went out with Lesbia he ran into her. Then Lesbia’s bike fell to bits with antiquity and hard usage; and as for mine— it’s lying about somewhere, but I don’t bike now; it’s gone out. I motor ! ’ ‘ Has Batiushka set up a motor ? ’ asks Delecta. ‘You never told me, Lesbia.’ ‘ Batiushka ! ’ cries Philly scornfully. ‘ He couldn’t afford to keep a wheelbarrow. No; I motor with my friends.’ ‘Stop swaggering, Philly, and have a green fig. It will keep you quiet.’ ‘Not for worlds,’ I cry. ‘Those figs are to make a delicious sweet for to-night’s dinner. I must give Delecta something really nice to show her what I can do.’ Philomela, who is quite unsquashable, gives Delecta a full and minute account of all the things I have spoilt—the roasts that didn’t roast, the pastry that wouldn’t rise, the jellies that never stood up. Dear Delecta only smiles and says: ‘Never mind, Lesbia; you and I are going to concoct some wonderful dinners. I think it was immensely plucky of you to tackle cooking at all.

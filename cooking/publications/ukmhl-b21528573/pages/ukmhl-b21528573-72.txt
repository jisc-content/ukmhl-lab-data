The Joyful Arrival of Delecta. 56 things she said of Oliver Cromwell will not bear repetition, and she wound up by telling Batiushka he was stupid and ignorant and vulgar—‘To talk of Charles the First in that common, vulgar way. Napper is a very vulgar word—isn’t it, Lesbia ? ’ I pretended to be deaf; but I afterwards told Batiushka privately that ‘napper’ and Charles the First were very incongruous terms, and must never again be used together. Mercifully, we discovered a diversion from the Stuart period in the shape of a pavement artist drawing chalked pictures on the flagged stones— not only drawing, but writing out verses of poetry that he said were original. One little verse of four lines was particularly attractive, and perhaps par- ticularly true: Philomela says the first two lines apply to me and the last two to Batiushka, for he gives everything away. ‘ You’d give your head away if it wasn’t gummed on.’ Philly’s remarks are terse and to the point. It’s not the man who knows the most That has the most to say; It’s not the man who has the most That gives the most away.

The Joyful Arrival of Delecta. 50 enthusiastically of the views and the hills and the shining river-sea. Philomela and Batiushka cannot make up their minds what to wear! I tell them they know no one in the Ancient City, and that we are merely going as tourists with a taste for good luncheons. We must leave fairly early to catch our train, so I hope they won’t spend too long over their toilets. I have no time for an elaborate costume, having many instructions to give Harriet towards preparing the dinner. I want to give Delecta a good meal for the first one. Eventually Philomela appears ‘gowned charmingly’ (as they say in Society papers) in dark-blue linen, with a pale-blue blouse, a pale- blue hat, and a pale-blue leather belt. She is followed by the Batiushka, who is very dressy about the tie. They both maintain that I do them no credit, so I very hastily put on a slightly better hat and a new veil. It is wonderful what a new veil does for you—especially a new thick one ! Before we leave we have an anxious discussion on the subject of weather. Will it rain ? The country requires rain so badly—the thirsty hedges and trees droop piteously, waiting for the showers that never come—that it seems terribly selfish to hope it will be fine, and yet we certainly do hope the rain will not come till we are safely home again.

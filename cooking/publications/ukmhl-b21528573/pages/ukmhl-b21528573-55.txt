Black Dogs, Visible and Invisible. 39 including two of Philomela’s photograph-frames. I could not leave her alone with Harriet for more than an hour without their quarrelling and wrangling at the pitch of their voices. At first, in the full bloom of our home-made joke of ‘ furious Frank and fiery Hun,’ we were amused at their quarrels; but the amusement soon palled, and for the sake of peace we despatched the Phenomenon to its own place. Philomela would have liked to send the black dog with her; but it’s ‘ first catch your hound ; ’ also, dog-stealing is punishable by law. I should not like any of my family to know, but I really look upon the Hound of the Baskervilles as my best friend. He possesses a most voracious appetite, and is ever ready to eat up any failures. Even the dreadful cake that looked like sodden putty he swallowed with avidity. All the things that I forget are in the oven, even if too brick- like to eat, he will take away to play with. Now ‘Grip,’ the Samaritanian dog, is much too high class to accept anything but the very best bones, the most seductive biscuits. I hardly dare to offer him a home-made biscuit; he even refused the brown biscuits I made yesterday, and they were really delicious. For a wonder the oven was in a good temper.

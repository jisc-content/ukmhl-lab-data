In mild, damp weather it cannot be kept for the same length of time, while in summer a few days will be the most that meat will keep good, and in hot weather every precaution must be taken to keep off the flies. The prime joints should be selected for roasting, such as sirloin of beef, ribs, fillet of veal, leg of mutton, &c.

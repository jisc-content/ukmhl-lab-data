We go to Vine Cottage. 4 Could I after many years skin a rabbit? We once had a cook who tried to skin a hare with a knife and a silver fork, and to this day I do not know if it was insanity or inebriation. Probably the latter. Can I learn plain, sensible cooking from a cookery-book ? Like the Frenchman who was asked if he thought he could catch the fox, ‘ I do not know, mon a?ni, but I vill try.’ I am no less heroic than a fox- hunting Frenchman, so, though I may never suc- cessfully grapple with all the intricacies of cooking, ‘ I vill try.’ I wish the writers of cookery-books did not credit you with an unlimited income, a very high order of intelligence, and a kitchen filled with every known and unknown implement. You pleasantly read: ‘Having now placed the force-meat of chicken in the bain-marie, you steam ’ But you don’t steam; you don’t do anything, because you are brought up short by the fact of not possessing a bain-marie. Then the recipes are always so gorgeous, though generally described as ‘little dishes.’ ‘ A delicious little supper-dish is made from the breasts of three fowls ’ (shade of Foker! ‘ What becomes of the legs ? ’) ‘ stewed in a puree of oysters, mushrooms, truffles, and very thick whipped cream.

224 Superb Suppers. Delecta looks severe—‘that it has become the fashion to give entertainments of such an elabo- rate and expensive kind. I cannot see why a few young people should not meet together, dance, and enjoy themselves with no other refreshments but iced coffee and claret-cup, good sandwiches, and a few pretty sweets. Philomela quoted Monsieur Harpagon, and we know he did not think it necessary “to live to eat.” Well, young things should come to a dance to dance, and not to stuff themselves like the fat boy in Pickwick. We all eat too much.’ ‘Speak for yourself,’ interrupts Philly the irre- pressible. Delecta takes absolutely no notice, but repeats, ‘We all eat too much. However, as you do not want people to say they are starved, you must have some good dishes, and enough to go round. The main foundation of all the daintiest and prettiest of supper-dishes of the meat and savoury kind is aspic jelly. Once you can make this really well, you can have a variety of delightful dishes. There are several ways of making aspic jelly, either with gelatine—the simplest, quickest way—or from knuckle of veal or cow-heel. I will give you two recipes, but I think you will find the first the easier to manage.’

18 We go to Vine Cottage. scheme. I do not want to begin our tenancy of the cottage by words with the kind landlady, so the piano is still an unknown quantity. ‘ If I don’t like the Vine Cottage piano I can hire a clavier,’ says our pianist. The Batiushka privately asked me what on earth a clavier was. When I explained it was soundless, and that Philomela would practise on it, his face fairly lit up with joy. ‘Won’t I hear her before-breakfast scales?’ ‘ Not a note of them ! ’ ‘ Lesbia,’ whispered my long-suffering cherub, ‘couldn’t we buy one of these silent instruments and give it to Philly ? ’ The price rather daunted him, but he is cheered by the thought that perhaps Philomela will not approve of the piano that ‘ goes ’ with Vine Cottage. Martha has promised to take the canary with her to Scotland. It’s a very English bird; I hope it won’t dislike Kirkcudbrightshire. That blessed bullfinch goes with us. I would like to board it out, but it’s the Batiushka’s own property, and he says he could not bear to be parted from it. I do hate travelling with a bird-cage ! Nothing makes you look so trippery and common. There is only one thing worse, and that is a bath with a tin cover and a strap !

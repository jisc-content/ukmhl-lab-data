To the intelligent cook the word boiling has two distinct meanings: first, as applied to the cooking of meat, where the word boiling is a misnomer; second, as applied to the cooking of vegetables and puddings, in which the food is really subjected to the degree of heat known as boiling-point (2120 Fahr.) during the whole period of cooking. When meat is boiled the water into which it is plunged must be at boiling-point, with bubbles rising quickly over the whole surface; and this temperature must be maintained during the first five or seven minutes of cooking, and the heat must then be reduced to simmering-point. The intense heat at first is used to harden the albumen on the outside, forming a case which keeps in the juice. When this result is obtained, the cooking is con- tinued at a lower temperature so that the joint may be soft, juicy, and palatable. And now a word on the meaning of simmering, for here a difficulty arises between the chemist and the practical cook. Chemists tell us that if there is movement at all, the liquid is at boiling-point, and the heat as great as if bubbles were rising fast and furiously. A cook explains simmering as the degree J>— 4>

The Amateur Cook. CHAPTER I. WE GO TO VINE COTTAGE. <=§o HAVE been seriously impressed by a sen- tence I read in a book the other day : ‘ Every woman should be able to cook.’ These words have haunted me. When I order the dinner I see them—‘in my mind’s eye, Horatio’—painted on the kitchen wall above the polished tins. They come home to me with accusing force when I eat the confec- tioner’s cake and the baker’s scone. I mean, of course, cakes and scones which I buy myself. Other people are at liberty to buy their edibles if they like, also where they like so long as it is not at the grocer’s. Do you know grocer’s cake?

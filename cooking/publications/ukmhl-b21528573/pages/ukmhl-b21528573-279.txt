261 The Doleful Departure. 3. Never be in a hurry; flurried cooking is gene- rally a failure. 4. Never leave the corks out of sauce-bottles or vinegar and oil bottles. Put corks in pro- perly and carefully. 5. All crusts and pieces of bread should be browned in the oven, and then grated into crumbs and stored in tin canisters. 6. You cannot bread-crumb with the centre of a new loaf. Many cooks think they can. 7. Have a wire whisk for your clear soup, a switch for your cream-whipping, and an egg-beater for your eggs. Do not use one whisk for all three things. They can all be bought for a very small sum. 8. Test your oven before you bake bread or cakes. Don’t guess. 9. Save the skins of lemons, dry them in the oven, grate them down, and keep in a glass bottle. They will do for flavouring. 10. All pieces of bacon and bones and ends of meat will do for your stock-pot, from which you make your everyday household soups and broths. n. Never spare vegetables and fruit. They save doctors’ bills.

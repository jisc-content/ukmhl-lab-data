59 The Joyful Arrival of Delecta. it was he who spent his honeymoon touring among the cathedral towns of England. Batiushka says I should have brought a guide- book. I wish I had; he asks so many questions and I can’t answer them. However, I have pro- mised to bring him back to the Cathedral with a guide-book another day when we have no train to meet. Of course Delecta’s train is late, and of course we keep finding ourselves on the wrong platform. Batiushka fusses because he thinks we may lose the Hillsboro’ train. The station is so crowded, and there are so many children either going to the seaside or returning, all armed with spades and pails. One small boy has his bucket filled with the corpses of baby crabs—‘wee yins,’ as Macgreegor would say—but I hope this young gentleman did not ‘bawsh ’ them. Eventually Delecta’s train steams into the station, and we hurriedly retrieve her, her baggage, and her bicycle, and bundle into the Hillsboro’ train. No sooner are we seated than Philomela ex- claims, ‘Why on earth did you bring a bike?’ * Lesbia never mentioned biking, but I thought it was as well to have it. Don’t any of you bike now ? —Why, Batiushka, you bought a bicycle last year, didn’t you ? ’

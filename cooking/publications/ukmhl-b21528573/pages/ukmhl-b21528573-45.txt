A Day of Misfortunes. 29 perfectly exhausted. I am really thankful Batiushka had to go into the City, for, poor dear! he will have a good luncheon, and the meal here is to be only potted meat and bread-and-butter. I think Harriet is rather disgusted that there will be nothing but the cold lamb for her and Frances; she wanted me to make them a pudding. ‘ We alius has puddens at home, mum.’ Harriet is dissatisfied with me, I can see; but I am reserving my ener- gies for the dinner. I must have a decent meal to-night. Hillsboro’ is a dear little place, but it has its drawbacks, and one is the extreme hardness of the water. Another is the number of people—men, women, and children—who come to the door selling things. Sitting in our little drawing-room or in the front garden, I cannot possibly pretend that I neither see nor hear the importunate shrimp-seller, the tomato - seller, the itinerant glass-merchant. Frances was having quite a flirtation with a horrid little boy who was selling rather mouldy-looking oranges, his head tied up in none too clean bandages. I severely ordered her into the house, and because of the bandaged head, gave Nell Gwynn’s descendant some coppers. Fatal error! Every child in the district has been here with gooseberries, with apples, with fish, with shrimps.

Delecta on Cooking. 70 took the hint, and for the rest of the meal left cooking severely alone. After breakfast Delecta appeared with a huge pile of notes and manuscript, and announced her intention of giving a lecture on Rudimentary Cook- ing. She asked Philomela if she would like to be present, and I regret to say the answer was, 11 ? Not much ! ’ Also, Philly says it is absolutely neces- sary to call every other day and talk severely to Miss Hartmore as to why she never sends the papers. This is a very old grievance. Philly takes in numerous papers and magazines, which never by any chance arrive on the right day. She calls perpetually at the little shop whose window displays post-cards, note-paper, and fancy baskets, and demands satisfaction. Miss Hartmore only smiles sweetly and makes any amount of promises, that are invariably, and with unfailing regularity, broken. The Batiushka has taken himself off, every pocket bulging with cigars and tobacco-tins—I have told him so often that a tobacco-tin is ruin to the hang of any coat—his last remark being, ‘ Never mind the cooking lecture; give me a good lunch.’ Delecta suggests she should arrange about the luncheon before she holds forth on the best manner to roast, to boil, to stew.

282 We Make the Christmas Pudding. ITALIAN ORANGES. ^UT your oranges across in halves and empty the skins carefully without breaking them; notch the skins neatly round the edges; press all the juice out of the orange-pulp and strain. Add sufficient water to the juice to make one pint. Put this pint of liquid in a saucepan with i oz. leaf-gelatine, the rind and juice of one lemon, ^ lb. fine sugar, and the whites and shells of two eggs. Whisk over the fire till it boils. Then let it boil gently by the side of the fire for ten minutes in a covered pan, stand for a few minutes, and strain. Fill your orange- skins with the jelly, and set round a glass dish filled with whipped cream flavoured with vanilla, or place them round a vanilla ice. Another way is to fill one half orange with jelly, and the other half with vanilla cream slightly stiffened or frozen, and place the two halves together. AMERICAN TRIFLE. LINE your glass dish with sponge-cake and macaroons, and over them place a layer of strawberries or raspberries (glass-bottled fruit of a reliable brand will do quite well). Pour over them custard. Make a meringue and pile on the top, set in a cool oven till well set, and serve cold.

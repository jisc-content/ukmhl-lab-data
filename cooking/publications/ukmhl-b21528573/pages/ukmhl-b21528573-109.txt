Brilliant Breakfasts. 93 perhaps only my opinion, as I don’t like eggs in the rough; but a great many people will agree with me. ‘ The ideal breakfast is eaten alone. No one is fit to speak to so early in the morning. I read in a book ’ (here Philly dived among her notes) ‘ of a girl who, talking of her future husband, said she hoped he would be brilliant and amusing at break- fast ; and her mother replied, “ My dear, you may be thankful if he is even decently civil.” This anecdote illustrates my point that the human animal is not affable in the small hours of the morning. Try and make him amiable by giving him a good breakfast. ‘It is important’ (Philly again consulted her notes) ‘ to have a perfectly clean table-cloth, white china, fresh flowers, bright silver; and the lady of the house must wear a beaming smile— remember that, Lesbia—as well as a dainty morn- ing-gown. It is necessary to have good coffee, freshly ground and roasted, a variety of hot rolls, toast, marmalade, two kinds of jam, cold ham, salad, fruit, a dish of eggs done in some tempting way, and some other viand well cooked. The above meal sounds extravagant for a small house- hold, but small households are of but little interest in the scheme of good living.’

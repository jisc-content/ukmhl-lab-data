We Make the Christmas Pudding. 287 Comfort and joy. Two good things if they come at Christmas-time, or at any other time. We all need comfort; we all need joy. Most of all we must give them to others. Is not that the great Christmas lesson, ‘to give’? We may not have very much to give, but we all have something. The choir-boys singing in the streets have their message to give, bringing home to many sad hearts tidings of comfort, to many happy hearts tidings of joy. At this Blessed Christmastide may comfort and joy rest upon every home. May the words of the old carol bring us many blessings. In the words of Tiny Tim, may ‘ God bless us every one.’

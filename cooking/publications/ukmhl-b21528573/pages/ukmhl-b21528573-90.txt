Wherever there are bubbles the heat is at boiling-point. What the chemist does not realise is that a pan may be so arranged that only one part of it comes in contact with the fire or gas, and that one part supplies heat to the rest of the contents. A practical cook knows that a pan may have an occasional bubble at one side of its contents, while the other side is not nearly so warm. The quantity of liquid used for boiling must be sufficient to immerse the food cooked; it must be at boiling-point for the first five or seven minutes, and must then be reduced to a much lower temperature, so that the juices are retained and the meat is made tender and digestible. An exception is made in the case of salt meats, these being put into cold water and brought gradually to the boil, first, to draw out some of the salt; second, to soften the fibres, which have been slightly hardened by the action of the salt.

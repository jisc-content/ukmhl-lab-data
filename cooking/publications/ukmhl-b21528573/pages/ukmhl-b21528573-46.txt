30 A Day of Misfortunes. Philomela facetiously explained from her bed- room window that we never eat shellfish in any form; also that she need not be told the shrimps are freshly caught, because she can smell them ! The shrimp-seller became abusive, and it has cost me sixpence to get rid of him peaceably. I am at present lengthening Harriet’s frock, for really she looked most undignified, and I fear the Hillsboro’ folk would be shocked if she answered the door displaying not only solid ankles but solid calves. Philomela has been at the Samaritan’s telephone in pursuit of a clavier, for the piano does not meet with her approval. Does Philly ever really find a piano that suits her? Mr Samaritan has presented her with a huge bunch of deliciously smelling pinks, and she has borrowed an old book of songs from the Good Samaritan. She also tried to borrow the Samari- tanian dog, a perfect person of much character and sense, but he prefers to lie in his own garden and bark at the passers-by. I have no personal objection to Prince Charlie; in fact, I have Jacobite leanings; but if Philomela intends to learn ‘ Farewell, Manchester,’ off by heart, I don’t think I can bear it.

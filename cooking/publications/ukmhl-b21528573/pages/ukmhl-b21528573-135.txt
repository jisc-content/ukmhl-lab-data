Lightsome Luncheons. 119 me, I will give her bouillon in American cups, chicken a la Maryland, a good salad, ice cream, and coffee that really is cafe noir. I am glad to say Delecta and I are at one on the subject of having a dainty luncheon. Personally, if alone, I prefer an omelette and a cup of coffee to anything else. Delecta is great on the subject of omelettes, and has given me so many recipes that I truly believe there are dozens and dozens of different omelettes; but the leading principles are always the same. And is there anything better than a really good omelette ? gREAK 4 eggs into a bowl and beat them vigorously; add 4 table-spoonfuls of cold water, a piece of butter the size of a walnut, and 1 table-spoonful of sifted sugar. Put the butter in a sheet-iron pan used only for omelettes, and when it begins to crackle, turn in the eggs. Shake vigo- rously to allow the omelette to slide from side to side. In a moment the egg nearest the heat will become congealed. Slide a palette-knife, or a thin, flat, wooden knife, under the omelette to allow the soft portions to run beneath. Shake and lift, lift and shake, till the omelette is light. Take the omelette from the fire; fold it from the handle side OMELETTE AU RHUM. 4>

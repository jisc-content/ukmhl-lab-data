Delectable Dinners. 198 FRENCH BEEF OLIVES WITH TOMATO SAUCE. 'JpAKE some slices of fresh beef very thin and about four inches square; flatten them with a rolling-pin. Chop up any scraps of fowl or game, some bacon (fat and lean), a scrap or two of veal, a little sweetbread, one sausage, three mushrooms, one very small onion, some parsley, a tiny bit of nutmeg, and a little pepper and salt. Bind all this together with the yolk of an egg and a little cream. Spread this mixture on your slices of beef, and tie them round with a coarse white kitchen thread; then stew them in some nice tomato sauce, simmering gently for one hour and a half—see that it does not boil—and when you dish them, remember to pour the gravy over them. FILLETS OF HARE WITH CHERRIES. RIGHTLY stew some neatly cut fillets of hare; then place in the stewpan some brown sauce (sufficient to cover the fillets) and a large handful of glac6 cherries. Stew all gently till done. Dish on thick crofitons of bread fried, with little heaps of the cherries in between cn couronne; add the sauce over and round them. 4>

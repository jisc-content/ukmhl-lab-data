I thought you was a ghost.’ Imagine a ghost in broad daylight, in a muslin dressing-gown, arranging flowers ! Harriet was quite upset, and went off to lay and light her kitchen fire shaking her head gloomily, as if she thought I was a ghost and didn’t know it. I cooked quite an elaborate breakfast; though I regret to say it was rather late, and Philly said sententiously, ‘A plain breakfast punctual is better than a grand one late.’ But Delecta, who was late for once in her life, kindly said, ‘The amateur cook has to learn the time required for each dish, and experience is the best teacher.’ Thank goodness! the Batiushka said nothing, but manifestly enjoyed his meal. ‘ How cross you ’ll be by ten o’clock, Lesbia! People who get up at four o’clock in the morning always grow crosser and crosser as the day goes on.’ ‘Lesbia mustn’t be cross,’ remarked Delecta; ‘so don’t suggest it to her, Philly. To-day we are going to discuss cake-making and teas, and I want all her attention.’ I don’t feel much like cake conversation ; it’s much too hot; also I know I shall fall asleep.

We go to Vine Cottage. 3 Bat pride, as usual, went before a fall. The next day I tried it at home, and it was neither ‘ the puff direct nor the puff preliminary/ for it did not puff at all. I did not return to the cookery classes. I was afraid of meeting the ghost of that hacked and mangled sole. Think of the spectre of an injured and departed fish. Doesn’t it sound unpleasant and creepy ? I taught myself a certain amount at home, but feel there is much to learn. There is no body about my cooking. Too much flummery ; too little solid. If only people could live on scrambled eggs, beef-tea, ices, cold savouries, very elegant sweets, omelettes, and caramel walnuts, then I think I might set up as a real cook. Alas ! ices are not sustain- ing, nor caramels satisfying. They want roasts and boileds, trussed birds, fish other than trout (I can wrestle with trout), and all manner of plain, dull, necessary dishes. Now I know that the writer who said, ‘ Every woman should be able to cook/ meant the whole- some, the useful, the plain, the dull. Can these be learnt by experience, that sad but excellent teacher of the mentally deficient? Would practice ever teach me how to fillet fish?

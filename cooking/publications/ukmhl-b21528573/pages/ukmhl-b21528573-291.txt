We Make the Christmas Pudding. 273 at the little expenses (extravagance is not happiness, nor does it give it), and voted crackers, holly, presents, gaiety, and goodwill a bore ? If you happen to be a supercilious person—for your own sake I hope you are not—and one of the extra supercilious who will not read Dickens, break through your rule of thinking his books vulgar and out of date, and read in The Uncommercial Traveller the tale of the seven poor travellers. It revels —literally revels—in happiness and goodwill; it breathes the Christmas spirit in every line. And the fun of it! What fun do you ever have if you are supercilious ? Who but Dickens, in describing the procession of good things, would have said ‘ inattentive boy with plates ’ ? Can’t you see him ? Every time I read it I am struck with the absolute felicity of the expression. Don’t we all know ‘ the inattentive boy with plates ’ ? It is quite useless to tell supercilious persons to read the Christmas Carol, because of course they won’t; it is much too sentimental and far-fetched, and Tiny Tim is impossible, and the fat turkey ridiculous. That may all be true; and yet surely it is pleasant to think there may perhaps be Scrooges whose hearts are touched by the Christ-Child’s tender fingers, and Tiny Tims whose Christmas Dinner is a feast indeed. Personally I love every line of the A. C. 2 1

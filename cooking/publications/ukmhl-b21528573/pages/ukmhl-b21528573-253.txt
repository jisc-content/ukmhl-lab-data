235 Superb Suppers. same galantine can be made with breast or loin of veal, but a fowl is really the nicest. ‘As you may wish to white glaze your fowl, I will give you a recipe for it. It is also the recipe for boned turkey.’ At the word boned Philomela again buried her head. ‘Come out, Philly,’ said Delecta kindly; ‘it’s all right.’ WHITE GLAZE. r|~’0 glaze one boned turkey, moisten 4 oz. flour with one pint thin cream or good milk (not skim-milk), and season with a little grated nutmeg and salt. Put into a clean enamelled pan on a slow fire, and stir very carefully till it boils; then add a little cream. Soak 1 oz. leaf-gelatine in a very little cold milk. Now dissolve it in nearly half a pint of boiling milk; add this to the glaze in the pan, and let it again come to the boil. Watch and stir it very carefully in case it should singe or brown; take it off the fire and set in a cool place, stirring occasionally till nearly cold. When almost cold, pour it over your turkey; and when it has set (which it will do very quickly), garnish to taste with butter icing, coloured aspic, &c.

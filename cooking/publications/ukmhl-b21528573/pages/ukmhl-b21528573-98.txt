82 Delecta on Cooking. disadvantage is insignificant when we consider the finer flavour obtained. Steaming may be done (i) in a steamer ever a pan of quickly boiling water; (2) the basin con- taining the food may be placed in enough boiling water to come two-thirds of the way up the vessel, as in the case of steamed puddings, the top of the basin being quite out of the water and the pudding protected from the moisture by a greased paper. The water used for steaming must actually boil during the whole period of cooking, the heat not being reduced after the first few minutes, as in boiling. Great care must be taken to keep up the supply of boiling water, or the pan, and possibly the food, may be burnt. Anything that can be boiled may be steamed—for example, corned beef, ham, all boiled puddings, vegetables, &c.—and the advan- tages may be summed up as follows : the retention of a larger amount of juices and flavourings, the lessened danger of hardening the albumen, the increased lightness of puddings, and the abolition of pudding- cloths, and therefore the labour of washing them. The chief points of difference between boiling, steaming, and stewing are : Boiling is cooking in a large quantity of liquid, with great heat at first, this being afterwards reduced.

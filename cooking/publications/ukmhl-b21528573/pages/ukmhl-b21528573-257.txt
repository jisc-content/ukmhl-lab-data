Superb Suppers. 239 gelatine and liquid is therefore one great cause of failure, and the result is a jelly either too stiff or too fragile. Another cause is often found in the fact that if gelatine has been dissolved separately before being added to the other ingredients, as in the case of creams, part of it is left behind either in the pan or strainer, and again the jelly falls. Frequently, too, undissolved lumps of gelatine are found (and gelatine is a slightly unpalatable material resembling glue). In this case the use of a strainer has been dispensed with, and the result is most unpleasant. So accuracy both in proportions and method is most essential. The proper proportion of gelatine to liquid is 1 oz. to i quart for small jellies. This makes them stand up properly and yet quiver and sparkle with the slightest movement, as a well-behaved jelly should. For larger jellies a slightly higher propor- tion (ij oz. to i quart) must be used to support the larger bulk. This should be used if the mould is over the pint size. If the jelly has to support fruit or some other substance (as in a macedoine of fruit) 2 oz. to every quart must be allowed. In exces- sively hot weather it may be necessary to use a little more gelatine than at other times; though if you

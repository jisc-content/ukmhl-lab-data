Brilliant Breakfasts. 95 general or a cook with no kitchen-maid, though even with kitchen-maids and all appliances and means to boot you sometimes get a very bad meal.’ Philomela has seized one of the note-books and is ostentatiously taking down Delecta’s remarks. 1 Philly talked of good coffee. Is it ever good ? ’ asks Delecta dejectedly. ‘With all the new coffee-machines and coffee-pots, how seldom is it drinkable! Even tea is rarely all it ought to be. Then hot rolls, though delightful, are some- what indigestible; and even if they were entirely hygienic, many cooks much object to baking them before breakfast. It’s a very difficult problem, but I have a book of breakfast recipes, and if you care to take them down, Lesbia, I will go and fetch it.’ The moment she has gone Philomela sadly remarks, ‘ It fell very flat. I quite hoped Delecta would flare up and say I was frivolous or ribald or something; she took it like a lamb. Still, you know, Lesbia precious, our breakfasts are rather frosts sometimes, aren’t they ? Think of the coffee! ’ I do think of the coffee. I often do; and I am still thinking of it when Delecta returns with a large and weighty volume.

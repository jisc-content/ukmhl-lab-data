Delectable Dinners. 193 butter and one heaped table-spoonful of flour. Now stir in over the fire one pint of thick cream. Mix the mushrooms with the sweetbreads, place in the cream, and flavour with pepper and salt. Serve in a silver dish, heaped up, or if preferred, in a ring of French pastry. Chicken also does for this. £*UT up the meat of a hare and wash the pieces in vinegar. Then cook them in stock, butter, a few bits of ham, chopped onion, and a little salt. Half-fill a wine-glass with sugar, and add vinegar till the glass is three-quarters full. Mix the sugar and vinegar well together, and when the hare is browned and nearly cooked, pour the vine- gar and sugar over it. Add one dessert-spoonful of grated chocolate, a few shredded almonds, and a few stoned raisins. Mix all well together, and cook for a few minutes more. LITTLE CREAMS OP SWEETBREADS. T'AKE one or two calves’ sweetbreads and place them in cold water with a little salt, and bring to the boil; then rinse them in cold water, and simmer gently for one hour in some good flavoured veal stock.

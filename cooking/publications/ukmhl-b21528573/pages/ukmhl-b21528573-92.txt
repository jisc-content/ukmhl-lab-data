To return to the actual cooking of the joint: place it close to the fire for the first five or ten minutes, according to the size. If the principle of boiling meat has been fully grasped, the reason for this will be seen at once; i.e. the surface of the meat is to be hardened as soon as possible to form a case for the retention of the juices.

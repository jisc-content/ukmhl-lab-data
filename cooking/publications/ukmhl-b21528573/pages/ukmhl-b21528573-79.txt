The Joyful Arrival of Delecta. 63 the Baskervilles. For Delecta I have a little soup, salmon-steaks cooked in buttered papers, a Russian salad—not an elaborate one—cold lamb, a compote of green figs (the Free Kirker is, alas ! no more), and a savoury. Delecta is quite delighted—specially pleased with the green figs, which she had never met in that way before. It is a great triumph to give a professional mistress of cookery something new. B0IL together for three hours 8 breakfast-cupfuls of water, 6 potatoes, 3 onions, 1 dessert-spoon- ful sauce, and x table-spoonful butter; rub through a sieve, and add a table-spoonful of tapioca pre- viously soaked for an hour. Return the soup to the pan and boil for ten minutes, stirring fre- quently just before you take it off. Add a little cream or a breakfast-cupful of milk. A few boiled peas or asparagus-points improve this soup. J.JAVE your salmon-steaks cut neatly and not too large. Butter sheets of white note-paper or sandwich-paper; wipe fish well and roll in papers; put them in a moderate oven for twenty to thirty minutes. PLAIN WHITE SOUP. SALMON-STEAKS.

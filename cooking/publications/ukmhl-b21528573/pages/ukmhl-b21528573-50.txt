34 Black Dogs, Visible and Invisible. municating on one side with the fire and on another with a small passage called a flue leading to the main chimney. Round the open space the flame and hot air circulate, escaping with the smoke into the flue, and finally passing into the chimney. Across the flues are small iron doors, arranged to open and shut by means of knobs or handles; these doors are called dampers, and are used to regulate the heat by opening or closing the passage to the flame and heat. The secret of a hot oven is a good draught so that the flame may be drawn into the flue, and the farther the dampers are pulled out the greater the draught. It will be readily understood that if the space round the oven or the flues becomes choked with soot, (i) the draught will be less, and (2) the soot, which is a bad conductor of heat, will prevent the heat from passing into the oven. All flues, therefore, must be regularly cleaned with the proper brushes sold for the purpose. The times of cleaning depend on the amount of cooking done. In a large house where a great many elaborate meals are regularly prepared, all soot must be carefully and thoroughly removed every morning (needless to say, before the grate is otherwise cleaned or the fire laid); in a simpler household once a week may be enough. Common-sense must be used.

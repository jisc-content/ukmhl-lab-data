We go to Vine Cottage. 16 sound horrible and he never wants anything Tam- o’-shantered or ‘ panada ’-ed. I lay awake quite a long time thinking how much there will be to learn, and almost wishing I had never thought of cooking. Suppose things turn out very badly, what could I do? I know—and I won’t tell Philomela. I will write to Delecta, who is a real live professor of cooking, and ask her to be in readiness to come to my rescue if I can’t manage by myself. I have spent several weary days cottage-hunting— alas! without success. I generally go by myself, for Philomela is so disagreeable, and always offends the landlady by asking if the windows open or if there really isn’t a larger bedroom somewhere. Once I had the pleasure of Batiushka’s company, and he talked of nothing but drains ! To-day I have news of another cottage—a real one; not of gentility and a double coach-house, but a cottage of no pretensions, with a garden, and with a view. A view over the mouth of the river, that is almost the sea; a view towards the Delectable Mountains. The Batiushka must take this cottage. Philomela says she knows it. 1 The view is all right, but the road is the worst in Hillsboro’, and that is saying a good deal.’

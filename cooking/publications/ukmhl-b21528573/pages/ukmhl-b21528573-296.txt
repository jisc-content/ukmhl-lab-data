276 We Make the Christmas Pudding. it’s so very important that the mince-meat should be good when she has to eat twelve mince-pies between Christmas Day and New Year’s Day. Every pie means a happy month, says the old legend. Philly eats them in what she calls six weeks at a time. That is a pie and a half! GREAT-GRANDMOTHER’S MINCE-MEAT. ^AKE 3 lb. beef suet and 2 lb. tender beef (chopped as fine as possible), 3 lb. chopped, good baking apples, 4 lb. currants clean washed and picked, 1 lb. raisins stoned and chopped small, and 1 lb. powdered sugar. Mix them all together with | oz. mace, £ oz. grated nutmeg, £ oz. cloves, ^ oz. cinnamon, and 1 pint"French brandy. Ladle the mixture into a stone jar, and tie down tightly with paper and string. When you make your mince-pies add a little chopped candied citron and orange. Philomela says it ought to be good; it has four weeks to stand—though it really ought to stand for months! But in case great-grandmother’s mince- meat does not come up to our expectations, our cook is making a small jar of what she calls common ordinary mince-meat.

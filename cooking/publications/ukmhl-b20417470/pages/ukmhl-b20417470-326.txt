BEVERAGES. 804--TO MAKE TEA. Mode.—Tea making is like most things, there is a right and a wrong way of making it ; first of all be sure the water is boiling, have the teapot nicely dried out, then pour in a little boiling water and allow it to remain for a minute or so, throw that out and put in the tea, pour on it about half a pint of boiling water and allow it to stand for about three minutes, then you can put in the remainder of the water required. If the water is hard, a few grains of carbonate of soda will soften it, but great care must be taken not to use too much, otherwise it will spoil the tea altogether. 805— TO MAKE COFFEE. Mode.—Allow one tablespoonful of coffee to every half pint of boiling water, warm the pot, put the cofpf^e in and pour the water over it; coffee should not be boiled; pour out a little of the coffee and then put it back into the pot with a little cold water and a pinch of salt. A small muslin bag sewn to a ring made the size of the coffee-pot, to put the coffee in, is a very handy thing as it prevents the coffee going into the pot and renders straining un- necessasy, 806— TO MAKE COCOA. 1 dessertspoonful of cocoa 1 breakfastcupful of milk or water. Mode.—Put the cocoa into a cup and mix to a smooth paste with a little milk, then pour on the boiling water or milk and it is ready for use.

Vegetables. 377~TO BOIL GREEN PEAS. Peas Boiling water Salt Mint 1 tablespoonful of sugar. Mode.—Have the water boiling, put in a sprig of mint, a teaspoonful of salt and the sugar ; to every pint of peas add a pinch of carbonate of soda ; allow them to boil for twenty minutes. Do not cover the saucepan after you have put the peas in. 378—FEENCH BEANS. French beans Salt Boiling water. Great care must be taken in cutting and stringing French beans ; no matter how young they are, there is sure to be a certain amount of string on them ; I find the best way is to cut (with a very sharp knife) off the tops and right down the sides, then you can be sure all the string is off; then cut the beans in as small pieces as you may require. Mode.—Have the water boiling, and to each pint of water add a teaspoonful of salt and a pinch of carbonate of soda; put in the beans and allow them to boil for twenty minutes. Serve very hot. 379_BAKED PAWPAW. 1 pawpaw Dripping Salt and pepper. Mode.—The pawpaw can be used as a vegetable as well as a fruit. Get a pawpaw that is just turning ripe, cut it into quarters, then cut each quarter again, but do not peel it; put it into a baking tin, sprinkle well with salt and pepper; put some dripping in the tin ; bake in a very hot oven for twenty minures.

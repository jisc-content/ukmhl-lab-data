When it is all mixed together, spread it on very hot toast; have the eggs ready, cut away the crusts from the toast, and put the eggs on it. Serve at once. • 791—OMELETTE. 2 whole eggs Minced parsley Pepper and salt Butter. Mode.—Beat the whites to a stiff froth, then beat the yolks in a separate basin with a little butter, pepper and salt, and chopped parsley. Put a little butter in a pan and allow it to get hot; then when you are ready to cook the omelette mix the whites with the yolks and pour into the pan; stir it until it begins to set; then loosen it around the edges and double it over; when browned turn out on a very hot plate and serve at once.

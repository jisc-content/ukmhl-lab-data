Vegetables. 403—SAUEE KEAUT (to serve). (Some people like it cold, just as you take it from the jar; but as far as my experience goes, most people prefer it made from the following recipe :— 1 lb. brisket 4 cloves 2 pieces of ginger 1 teaspoonful black pepper ^ pt. vinegar and water. Mode.—Out the beef into pieces an inch square, put it into a saucepan with the other ingredients and allow all to simmer for three hours ; about half an hour before it is required add about half a pound of the sauer kraut, well squeezed out of the pickle. If wanted in a hurry, put the half pound of sauer kraut into a saucepan with the vinegar, ginger, cloves and pepper ; add some slices of cold corned beef, and boil for half an hour. Very good sauer kraut may be bought in small kegs and tins.

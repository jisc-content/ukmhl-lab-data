Mutton Entrees, Mode.—Prepare your cutlets and serve with, the fol- lowing sauce :—If cold cutlets, you can stew them in the sauce, which I think improves them. Have about half a pint of stock or gravy, chop up your pickles small and allow ihem to stew for about an hour, make a little thickening of flour and add, with a teaspoonful of brown sugar, pepper and salt. The mustard pickles are the best, as they make the sauce a nice color. 135—CUTLETS AND FEENCH BEANS. 1 lb. cutlets Wineglass vinegar J lb beans 4 cloves 1 piece ginger 1 onion Pepper and salt.

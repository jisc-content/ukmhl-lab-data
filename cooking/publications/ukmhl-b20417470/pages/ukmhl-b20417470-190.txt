Game. 419—EOAST TEAL. Mode.—Teal is a small duck, cook it the same way, only without stuffing ; it is a great improvement to put pieces of the rind of bacon over them while baking, as the bacon fat penetrates the flesh and moistens it as well as gives it a nice flavor. Cut down the back in two, and serve on toast with slices of lemon. 420—ROAST PIOMY GOOSE (Oyster stuffing). Mode.—The pigmy goose is a very small bird, but without doubt one of the sweetest of the Australian birds, and rather rare. Wash inside and out, prepare for stuffing. Sprinkle with pepper and salt, and rub a little flour over them. Stuffing—Allow about six oysters to each bird, soak the bread in a little milk, squeeze it out on to a plate, put in a teaspoonful of chopped parsley, the yolk of one egg and a teaspoonful of butter, divide it equally for as many birds as you have, and to each part add six oysters, pepper and salt. When the birds are stuffed, lay them on a baking dish and cover with buttered paper, bake in a quick oven. Serve on toast. 421—ROAST WALLABY. Most people, even Australians, are prejudiced against the wallaby, after all they are one of Australia's natural food, and feed just the same as a hare, in fact I have often served it for hare and no one has been any the wiser. Mode.—Get a nice young wallaby; and skin it as soon as possible after it is shot, wash it in a little vinegar and water, then stuff it with a nice highly seasoned stuffing, pepper and salt it, and bake in a quick oven. Make a gravy of the water you have boiled some of the bones in and a little port wine.

SWEETS. 725—FONDANT. 2 lb. sugar ^ a cup of water J a teaspoonful of cream of tartar. Mode.—Place tlie sugar and water in a moderately large saucepan ; when melted mix the cream of tartar with a little water and stir in; do not exceed the quantity of cream of tartar given, or the fondant will be a failure ; have a brush and basin of cold water handy, and while the syrup is coming to the boil brush round the sides of the saucepan occasionally to prevent the sugar crystalising ; soon as it boils place the cover on the saucepan and boil rather quickly. Have ready a piece of thin wire twisted into three or four loops at one end ; when the syrup begins to look thick dip this wire in, and if the syrup is thick enough to form a film across the loops, blow through them (holding the wire over a piece of paper); if the syrup blows out in a flaky sort of bubble, it has reached what is called the "feather degree," which is required for fondant; take off as soon as this degree is reached. Have ready a large basin which has been rinsed out with cold water, turn the syrup into this without delay; place the basin in another containing cold water, which must be renewed as soon as it gets warm ; sprinkle the top of the syrup with cold water to prevent it caking, and allow it to stand until flesh warm ; then with a wooden spoon beat the syrup until it becomes quite stiff and white ; it will suddenly turn to a hard white mass, and must be beaten until this happens; turn to a board and knead as you would dough, using icing sugar instead of flour; and when of a smooth elastic consistency it is ready to use, or put away in a basin covered with a damp cloth until re<5[uired. This fondant is the foundation for chocolate cream, cocoanut ice and other sweets; for colouring it the

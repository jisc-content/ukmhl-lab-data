Fleshy meat, not fat or cooked meat^ must he used for soups and gentle simmering is absolutely necessary, 1—STOCK. 4 or 5 lbs. shin beef 2 onions 2 knuckles veal 8 cloves Any trimmings of lean meat 14 to 18 pepper corns and fresh bones 2 large pieces of ginger Small bunch of herbs 1 lemon (juice) 4 or 5 carrots i lemon (rind) 4 or 5 turnips 8 quarts of cold water. Mode.—Allow the meat to stand in the water in which ■it is to boil for at least fifteen minutes, then let simmer and add the above ingredients, with the exception of the pepper and salib, which I find is better to add just before straining. Allow all to simmer for four or five hours, (more ij convenient); the longer it boils the richer the stock. This stock also serves as white stock if a little milk is added. 2—CLEAE SOUP.

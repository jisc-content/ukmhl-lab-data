TRIPE. 257—HOW TO CLEAN TRIPE. Mode.—Nearly always you can get the tripe from the butchers ready for use ; should it not be partly boiled, you must wash it, cut away all the fat, soak in salt and water for one hour and a-half, dip in boiling water, then you can pick off any discolored parts ; put on to boil with about two quarts of water and two tablespoonfuls of salt; boil for one hour and a-half, it is then ready to dress in any way you wish. 258~TRIPE CUTLETS. 1 lb. tripe Breadcrumbs 1 egg Flour Pepper and salt.

Mode.—Take the peel of the oranges and throw into cold water and boil until the peel is tender, using plenty of water and changing it after an hour's boiling, as the water gets very bitter. Put the peel in a colander to drain, and when cool, cut in long narrow strips with scissors, make a syrup of one pound of sugar, put into it one pound of orange peel and boil for twenty-five minutes. Take out the strips from the syrup with a fork and place upon plates to dry near the fire. Takes about two days for straws to dry sufiiciently to pack in boxes. 774—FEUIT SALAD. 3 apples 2 or 3 oranges 1 small pineapple 4 granadillas (or 12 passion 1 small pawpaw fruit) 3 bananas 1 tin Skinner's Cape goose- ^ pt. wine (hock or sherry) berries 4 tablespoonfuls of sugar.

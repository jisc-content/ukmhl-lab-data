t7am« and Preserves. 766-CANNED OUMQUATS. 1 lb. fruit 1 lb. sugar i pt. water. Mode.—Put the sugar into the preserving pan with the water, allow it to boil for half an hour; while boiling put in the cumquats and boil for another half an hour, then put into preserve jars and fasten down securely. 767—PEESEEYED OUMQUATS. 1 lb. fruit 1J lb. sugar 2 tablespoonfuls salt. Mode.—The cumquats should be pierced through in a couple of places with a hat pin. Well cover them with water, and to every quart of water allow a teaspoonful of salt, boil for half an hour and then strain them. Put fresh water on the cumquats and boil till soft enough to receive the head of a pin, then pour away half the water and make up the quantity of fluid required. Allow a liberal pound and a half of sugar to every pound of fruit and fluid and the faster it boils after putting in the sugar the better. The success of this recipe is that the fruit boils as fast as possible ; the faster it boils the better colour the jelly will be. Keep skimming with a strainer as so many pips boil out. 768—TO PEESEEYE OUMQUATS (Another Way). Mode.—Let them lie twelve hours in salt and water, wash them in clean water to remove the flavor of salt, put them in the preserving pan with plenty of cold water and let them boil gently until tender ; keep filling up with boiling water as the fluid decreases, but do not let them boil too fast as the fruit will burst. Take out very care- fully and lie them on a folded cloth to drain, cover with another cloth to keep them hot while you prepare the syrup, in which boil them gently until they are a rich golden color. When the syrup will jelly on a plate it is sufficiently boiled.

About 4 lb,s. breast veal ^ tin mushrooms 1 lb. mincemeat Black pepper 2 ozs. ham Salt Truffles (if obtainable) or Herbs Pate.-de-fois gras Most people think it is impossible to make this dish and similar ones in North Queenslrand, but I find no diffi- culty wh^atever, and it is especially easy to make it extra goo4 ; nearly all the ingredients can be obtained from the leading grocers. If you cannot get truffles get a tin or two of pate-de.-fois gras and mix with the mincemeat. Mode.—Get the breast of veal, cut away all the out- side pieces of skin, the bones and gristle, with a very sharp knife, taking great care not to cut through the meat, beat out the meat as flat as possible, put on a layer of the mincemeat and ham (pate-de-fois gras if you are going to use it), the mushrooms chopped very fine, sprinkle the dried herbs over, and black pepper and salt; this should be rather highly seasoned ; roll the veal very tight, put in a towel and tie up the ends very securely (like a roly-poly pudding) ; boil for two and a-half hours.

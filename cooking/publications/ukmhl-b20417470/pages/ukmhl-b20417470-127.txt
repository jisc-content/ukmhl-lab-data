Veal. Mode.---Slice the onions and put on in a saucepan with half a pint of water, pepper and salt; boil until the onions are cooked, then slice the veal into thin slices, put in the saucepan and boil for half an hour, then add the milk and boil again; when boiling thicken with a little flour. 241—YEAL AND HAM PIE. 2 lbs. cold veal 3 hard-boiled eggs J lb. lean ham Pepper and salt Some herbs. Mode.—Cut the veal and ham into small pieces, put a layer of veal, then an egg cut into eight pieces, a layer of ham, pepper and salt, and so on till the pie-dish is full; half fill the pie-dish with water, cover with a nice pu:ff paste and bake. When the paste is cooked the pie ought to be ready for use. It is sometimes better to put the veal and ham into the oven without the pastry, as it is much nicer to be a little more cooked, but be sure you cover with a plate or a dish. 242—STEWED CALF'S FEET AND EICE. 4 calf's feet 2 pieces ginger 2 onions Pepper and salt 12 cloves Large cupful rice Mode.—Wash the feet thoroughly in boiling water, put into a saucepan with sufficient water to well cover them; peel the onions and stick the cloves in them, put them with the ginger into the saucepan and allow all to boil for three hours ; if the bones do not come away from the meat freely, boil a while longer; take out all the bones and the onions, put in the rice, with plenty of pepper and salt, and boil again for three quarters of an bour.

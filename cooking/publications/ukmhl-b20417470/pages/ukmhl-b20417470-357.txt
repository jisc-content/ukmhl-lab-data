THE TOILET. 891—THE TOILET. Much care is necessary in a warm climate to retain a healthy and firm skin, and the chief means to prolong youth is careful attention to the bath. First a toilet bath, which is intended not only as a means to cleanliness, but as an aid to health and vigour, should be warm but not hot, this rids the skin of dust and perspiration, as well as preserving it from cutaneous diseases ; but as a beautifier simple water bMhs are not beneficial. Bran and starch make the skin soft and white, there- fore, should be used only for the face, arms and shoulders ; but for a friction bath, ammonia, eau-de-cologne, vinegar and salt are better, they help to make the skin hard and firm. A quart of vinegar in an ordinary sized bath is very refreshing; this can be aromatized by soaking in the vinegar previously a few drahms of rosemary, camphor, sage, mint or lavender. Opoponax answers the same purpose but is more ex- pensive, it has, however, the most refreshing e:ffect of any toilet bath. Vinegar mixed** with alcohol, say a quart in an ordinary sized bath, makes the skin hard and firm and is beneficial and soothing for prickly heat. An equal quantity of lemon juice and rose water and glycerene, mixed with the white of an egg (which has been previously beaten up), removes sumburn and freckles, and renders the skin soft and delicate. w' : : . - ■ - .

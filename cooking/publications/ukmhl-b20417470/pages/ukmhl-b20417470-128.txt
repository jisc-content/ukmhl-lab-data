Veal 243—STEWED CALF'S FEET (with Lemon Sauce and Forcemeat Balls). 4 calf's feet Ginger 2 knuckles of veal Juice of 8 lemons 3 onions 6 eggs Parsley 2 cupfuls of breadcrumbs 1 teaspoonful marjoram 2 teaspoonfuls paw-paw sauce. Mode.—Wash the calf's feet thoroughly in boiling water; put them on to boil with the knuckles of veal and two sliced onions, ginger, sauce, pepper and salt, allow to boil for four hours ; take out all the largest of the bones and skim off every particle of fat. To Make Forcemeat Balls.—Take about half pound of veal, put through the sausage machine, also one large onion ; soak three quarters of a pound of breadcrumbs in a little milk ; wring out in a clean cloth, add to them the veal, onions, a fcablespoonful of chopped parsley, a tea- spoonful of marjoram, pepper and salt, three eggs and a tablespoonful of butter. Mix all together, form into small bails, put in with the calf's feet and boil for an hour. Lemon Sauce.—Squeeze eight lemons into a basin; put in as much of the liquor from the calf's feet as you have lemon juice, beat up six eggs and add, stirring the one way briskly all the time. Put into a small saucepan and boil; be sure to keep stirring all the time and the one way, otherwise it will curdle ; also be sure to add the egg to the lemon, not the lemon to the egg. Serve the sauce in a sauce boat separate from the stew, as some people may not like the sauce. 244—CALF'S FEET BEAWN. 4 calf's feet 12 whole peppers 2 knuckles of veal 8 cloves Saltspoonful cayenne Teaspoonful mixed spice Tablespoonful of salt Bunch of herbs.

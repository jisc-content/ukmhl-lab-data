ICES, ETC. 647—HOW TO FEEEZE WITHOUT A MACHINE Ice and coarse salt. Mode.—Break up the ice into small pieces, and put it into the outer vessel in alternate layers with the salt—say, for instance, a bucket ; put the m-ixture into a billy-can or anything that would do as well; cover it well with the ice and salt; keep stirring and shaking it until the mixture is set; if wanted for a cream it will then be ready for use, but if wanted for iced puddings you must turn it into a mould and place it back into the ice, but do not stir it any more ; when it is required turn it out on to a glass dish. Of course, where people have ice cream machines it is very simple. 648—VANILLA ICE CEEAM. 1 (|t. milk A teaspoonful of essence of Yolks of 3 eggs vanilla A teacupful of sugar Juice of a lemon.

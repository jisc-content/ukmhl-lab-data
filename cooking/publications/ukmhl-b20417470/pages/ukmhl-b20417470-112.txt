Beef Entrees. Mode.—Out the onion in very thin slices and fry in a little butter, get a nice piece of beef with not too much fat, cut your bacon in thin strips, and with a larding needle run it through the beef in about six or eight different places, if no larding needle cut holes and put in the bacon, cut scores in the beef and put in part of the herbs that have been moistened with vinegar, tie up your beef with a piece of tape to keep it in a roll, put it in a saucepan that will hold it, stew the remainder of the herbs and onion over the beef, cover with water, cut up the vege- tables and stew with the beef for two hours ; do not let it boil hard as the beef becomes tough. 199—MINCED BEEF AND POACHED EGGS.

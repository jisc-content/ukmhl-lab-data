Mode.—Take six pounds of oranges ; cut the peel so as to make it come off in four pieces. Put all the peels on the fire in a preserving pan with a large quantity of water and boil them for two hours, then cut them in very thin slices. While they are boiling, press the insides of the oranges through a sieve fine enough to prevent the seeds and skin from going through. When this is done and the peels cut into the thinnest shreds; put the whole on the fire in a copper or brass pan with eight pounds of loaf sugar broken small. Boil it all together for ten minutes, it may then be taken off the fire and put into preserving jars.

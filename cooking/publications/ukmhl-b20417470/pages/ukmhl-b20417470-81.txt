PRAWNS. 115—PEAWNS. Prawns are always better if you boil them yourself as then you are quite sure if they are fresh or not, if you buy them cooked there is always a doubt. Mode —Allow the water to boil, then add the salt and prawns; when they are a nice bright color they are cooked ; they take about twenty minutes. Mode.—Soak the prawns in boiling water until you can bear your hands in it, then they will shell quite easily. Pick off the heads and the tails, then the shell of the body is easily removed. Always keep the pickings, as in making curry or other dishes these boiled down make the liquor for them.

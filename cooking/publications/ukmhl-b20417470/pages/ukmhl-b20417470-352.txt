Eecipes for Special Menus. 868—LARDED FILLET OF BEEF. Mode.—Get a nice fillet of beef, about six or seven pounds ; tie it neatly, then lard it with thin slices of bacon, one strip to about every two inches of meat. Rub it over with a little fiour ; pepper it well and use plenty of salt; cover with a well buttered paper and bake. 869—MUSHROOM SAUCE. Mode.—Boil one pint of milk, add pepper and salt to taste ; get two tins of black English mushrooms and boil with the milk for about ten minutes ; thicken with a little flour, and add about a dessertspoonful of butter. 870—ROAST TURKEY AND TRUFFLES. Mode.—Make a nice stuffing for the turkey of the giblets minced, and a tin of pate-de-fois gras, breadcrumbs, parsley, salt and pepper (oriental salt is very good for seasoning stuffing); mix all well together ; add a little butter and one egg ; stuff the turkey and sew over the loose skin ; rub it over with a little flour, pepper and salt; cover with a buttered paper and bake. Truffles are bought either in tins or bottles (the bottled ones being the best) ; boil them in water with a little salt for an hour ; then just heat in the baking tin with the turkey, one being sufficient for each person. 87i_ROAST DUCKLINO AUX POMMES RISSOLI. Mode.—Roast the duckling a nice brown, and make small rissoles about the size and shape of a cork of four apples put through a sausage machine with two or three leaves of sage ; mix them with about three ounces of breadcrumbs, pepper and salt, a tablespoonful of butter and one egg (just enough to make it moist), roll it into shape, dip in egg and breadcrumbs, and fry in boiling fat.

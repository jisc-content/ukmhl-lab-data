Boast and Boiled Joints. 413—BOILED SHOULDER OF MUTTON AND OYSTER SAUCE. Shoulder of mutton 6 doz. oysters 1 onion Breadcrumbs. Mode.—Take out the bone of a shoulder of mutton ; sprinkle the meat with salt; make a stuffing of breadcrumbs and oysters, a little chopped parsley, and pepper and salt; istufi the shoulder where you have taken out the bone, tie it up, put it in a stew-pan with the onion, which has been pre- viously chopped up, and some parsley ; put sufficient water to cover it and allow it to boil slowly for an hour and a-half. Take up the mutton and drain it, put it on a hot dish and cover with oyster sauce. The liquor that the mutton was boiled in would make good soup with a little Liebig and vegetables. 414—ROAST LEO PORK. Mode.—A leg of pork weighing seven pounds will take two hours. The skin should be scored across in narrow stripes, either before it is put in the oven or half an hour after. A stuffing of sage and onions chopped may be put in at the knuckle. 415—TO BOIL A HAM. 1 pineapple ham Grated cinnamon Breadcrumbs. Mode.—Seak the ham for two hours in cold water, then place in the boiler with sufficient cold water to cover it; the water to be brought to a boil and then removed off the fire so that the ham only simmers. Of course the length of time to be gaged by the weight of the ham. Afterwards the ham may be dressed in any way de- sired, either with breadcrumbs or grated cinnamon and placed in the oven and lightly browned. It spoils a ham to cut it when hot, it should always be left until thoroughly cold. I mention pineapple hams as I find they are the best to be had in Australia.

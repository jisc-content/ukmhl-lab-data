Out some of the turtle flesh and make the yolks of the eggs into small balls, also some turtle quenelles. To Make Quenelles.—Mince the meat of the turtle that you take from the soup, mix say about four ounces meat, four ounces breadcrumbs (which have been soaked in water and wrung in a cloth), add two eggs and the yolk of one, mix thoroughly, add salt and pepper, shape the mixture in small balls the size of a nutmeg and drop into tho boiling soup and allow to boil half an hour. When the soup is ready put in the turtle flesh and egg balls and a gill of sherry. The soup should have boiled down to about four or five quarts. Do not skim off the green fat, it should always be rich. Note.—Skinner's turtle soup is very good, it can be obtained from the leading grocers in one pound and half pound tins. 17—FEIMSEL SOUP (Jewish Oookery). 3 or 4 qts. stock 1 head celery 2 turnips 1 bunch mixed herbs 3 carrots 1 lb. frimsels 1 onion 1 pinch saffron.

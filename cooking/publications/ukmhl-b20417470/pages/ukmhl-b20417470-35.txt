PREFACE TO THE THIRD KDITION. IT seems only the other day that I wrote the preface to my first edition, and it is hard to say anything original in a preface I hope it will be some time before a fourth is wanted. My only apology for coming before the public is the knowledge that when a man eats, and eats well, he is in a condition which conduces to his comfort and good temper. The publication of this book may reveal the secret of this achievement; at any rate, I can honestly recommend every one of the recipes. Only try them, and I hope you will say the book is not a failure. I would like to say, however, so as to clear up any doubt there might be on the subject, that the great majority of the recipes in this book are my own invention, a few were bought by me, and are, consequently, my own property, and a few have been given me by friends. In presenting, in its new dress, this Third Edition to tho publioi I hcniTQ to tiiank them for a patronage that has v,;ili ES^|y^PiR.:icipations. welMOmee I hannah maclurcan. MOO iBqq K

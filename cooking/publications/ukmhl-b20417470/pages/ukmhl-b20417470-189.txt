GAME. '416—EOAST WILD DUCK. Mode.—Pluck the duck nicely (do not on any account scald it or you will spoil the flavour), singe and wash it, and dry with a clean towel. Rub it over with a little flour, cover with a buttered paper and bake in a moderate oven. This may be stuffed with ordinary stuffing if pre- ferred. It is rather an improvement to squeeze a lemon over it before baking it. Serve either with salad or slices of lemon and port wine sauce. 417—EOAST WILD GOOSE (Larded.) 1 wild goose 2 ozs. fat bacon Cayenne Lemon. Mode.—Wash the goose well, have the larding needle threaded with very fine strips of bacon fat about three inches long and a quarter of an inch thick, run the needle through the breast, it will draw the fat through with it, keep on until you have used all the bacon fat. Eub the goose over with flour then squeeze a lemon over it and sprinkle a little cayenne, lay on it a buttered paper and bake in a quick oven. This may be stuffed the same as a tame goose if preferred. Serve salad with this also. (See Eussian salad). 418—EOAST WILD TUEKEY (Liver stufling). 1 wild turkey 1 onion 2 ozs. bacon Cayenne and salt. Mode.—Wash and truss the turkey, flour it over (and lard if you wish, the same as a goose), pepper and salt. To make the stufling, chop up the liver with the bacon (which is best fat), half a cupful of breadcrumbs, yolk of one egg, pepper and salt and a little lemon juice. When the turkey is stu:ffed, bake in a fast oven. Serve with bread sauce.

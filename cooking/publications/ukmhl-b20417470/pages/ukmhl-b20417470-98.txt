Mutton Entrees. Mode.—Out up the mutton into small chops, slice the onions, peel and cut the turnips into four, put all into a saucepan with a pint of water, chop the ginger up and add with the pepper and salt; allow to stew for two and a-half hours to three hours; shake occasionally to prevent burning. This can also be made from remains of cold mutton. 162—STEWED BEEAST OF MUTTON AND PEAS. 3 lbs. breast mutton 2 or 3 leaves of mint 2 onions Pepper and salt 3 cupfuls peas A little flour. Mode.—Ohop up the breast of the mutton into pieces about two inches long, trim away as much of the fat as you can, put into a saucepan with the onions sliced, pepper and salt, and allow to boil for an hour: about half an hour before serving add the peas and the mint; when the peas are cooked take out the mint, add a little sauce and thicken slightly with a little flour. 163—SAVOURY MUTTON.

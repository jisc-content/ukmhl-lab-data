North Queensland Meat Export Company's Liebig's Extract of Beef. In private houses where there are not many servants kept, Liebig's Extract of Meat is most useful for cooking purposes in every way ; it gives very little trouble for soup making, entrees, gravies, sandwiches and many other things. It saves time, money, and in many cases temper. It promotes the appetite and assists digestion. No house should be without it. It is especially attractive to the capricious appetite of an invilid. It is already recognised by the cooks of the leading hotels, as well as housekeepers in private life, especially in summer when we have such very hot weather, as being always ready and good.

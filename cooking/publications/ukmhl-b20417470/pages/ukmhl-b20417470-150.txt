rnvalid Cookery. 292^BEEF JELLY. 3'-lbs. gravy beef 1 qt. wat^er Sal^ to taste 1 oz. gelatine. Mode.—Cut up the beef into small pieces and put in a jap with the wajter and a little salt, tie it down securjely with brown paper, stand the jar in a moderate oven for four hours, then strain; dissolve the gelatine and add to the liquor ; in cold weather tliere is no necessity to use the gelatine; stand in a cool place. You will often find "an invalid will prefer the cold jejjy to hot beef tea, and it makes a nice change. 293—CHICKEN BROTH. 1 chicken ^ water Pepper and sUlt. Mode.—Get a chicken, cut it up into eight or ten pieces, season ^with salf and pepper to taste ; put into a jar with the water^ then stand the jar in a saucepan of water, place it on the fire and allow it to simmer for four or five hours; strain, allow it to stand until €00l, then remove all fat. If the invalid is strong enough to digest it with' a flavouring of herbs, it is much mi)re palatable with them ; I would, therefore, recommend it being made hot again with a little onion, mace or celery ; it would be necessary to allow another hour for this. 294—GUILLED CHICKEN. 1 chicken (young) Butter Salt. Mode.—Get a very young chicken, about two or three month's' old, pluck and*^ clean it nicely, split it down the back, twist the pinions under the wings and flatten them out, spread a little butter over it and put it on the grill over a very clear fire, watch it closely and keep turning it so that it will not get burnt, but will be well cooked right

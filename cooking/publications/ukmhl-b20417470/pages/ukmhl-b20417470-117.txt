Beef Entrees. Mode.—Soak the tongue in vinegar for a night, put on to boil in half water, half vinegar, allow to boil three hours ; put through a mincing machine, then pound oip in a mortar with some pepper, salt and a little cayenne ; put into jars, melt some butter or lard and cover each jar to keep airtight; fasten each jar with a piece of parchment, tie tightly and store till required. 213— STEAK AND OYSTEE PIE. 2 lbs. steak 3 doz. oysters Pepper and salt Short paste. Mode—Cut the steak in small pieces about half an inch thick, put in a pie-dish with some black pepper and salt, fill the dish with the steak and the seasoning and about half fill with water; put in the oven and cook for one hour ; prepare the oysters with some white sauce and pepper and salt, take out your pie-dish, add the oysters to the steak, cover with a light short paste made with butter, put back in the oven and cook for about twenty minutes when the crust ought to be nicely done. 214— STEAK AND KIDNEY PIE. 6 sheep's kidneys 1 onion 2 lbs. steak Pepper and salt. Mode.—Cut the kidneys in eight, put half of them in the bottom of the pie-dish, then a layer of steak cut small, a layer of onion very thinly sliced, pepper and salt, con- tinue in alternate layers until the dish is filled, half fill the dish with water, cover with a nice short paste and cook in a medium oven. If pufO paste is used for pies, it requires a quick oven, as the paste gets cooked before the steak and kidney ; it is always best to partially cook the steak and kidneys somewhat before, then put on the paste and cook quickly ; if slowly, the paste gets soddened and heavy.

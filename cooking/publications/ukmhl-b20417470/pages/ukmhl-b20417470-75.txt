Oysters. 1 teaspoonful chopped par- sley 3 mushrooms 3 eschalots Pepper and salt Juice of 4 a lemon. Mode.—Strain the liquor from the oysters, put the butter and flour into a saucepan, chop the eschalots and mushrooms, add these with the liquor to the butter and flour, and when these are cooked stir in the tomato previously rubbed through a sieve ; allow these to boil for about five minutes, then add the stock, cream, juice of the lemon, parsley and cayenne, allow to boil again for about five minutes. Put in the oysters, but do not allow them to boil. Put a little of this on rounds of bread (fried). A fillet of anchovy laid on each piece is a great addition to this savoury. Mode.—Drain the oysters and dry them in a towel, sprinkle them with a little flour, pepper and salt. Put a little butter into a small pan; when it is bubbling put in the oysters ; when they are brown turn them and brown on the other side. Sprinkle the chopped parsley over them and serve on hot buttered toast. Mode.—Select very big oysters put in a small stew- pan, pour over them a small quantit}^ of the oyster liquor, but not a drop of water, add a lump of butter, pepper and salt, place the cover on and heat thoroughly, then stir in the white sauce, which must be hot and very thick.

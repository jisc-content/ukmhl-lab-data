PREFACE, As the first and most important consideration towards the prevention of disease and the conservation of the public health, is a plentiful supply of wholesome food, a competent knowledge of the various resources supplied by nature and art for this purpose is sufficiently apparent to require little to be said on the subject; it was wisely and learnedly advanced by Galen, who has quoted the great father of Physic, that "'health depends chiefly on the choice of food"—and "that he who would skilfully treat the subject of health, must consider the nature of man, the nature of aliments, and the constitution of the person that takes them” It is asserted, and we are not prepared to deny it, that the whole constitution of the body may be changed by diet; and Galen again in- forms us, that in the right ordering of our health, we should take those kinds of food which appear to be best adapted “ to our own particular bodies, age, temperature, distemperature and complexions.” Hence, to be enabled to do so much for ourselves, it implies not only an ac- quaintance with the various substances, animal and vegetable, solid and fluid, their state of perfection, and mode of preparation; but, at the same time, some rational acquaintance also with the functions and agents by which the organs to which they are submitted, are influenced by their use, as well as the condition in which the latter are to reecivc them.

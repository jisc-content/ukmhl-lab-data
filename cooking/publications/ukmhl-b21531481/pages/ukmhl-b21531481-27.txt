INTRODUCTION. XIX of chemistry at length unfolding more simple means of analysis, rendered still more easy the examination of animal and vegetable bodies, and the comparison of their distinctive qualities. Then it came that all that was capable of being made correctly known, on the peculiar nature of alimentary substances, on the variety of aliment contained by them, on the nature of mucous bodies, considered as mucilaginous in fermentable juices, gela- tinous matter, animal as well as vegetable, has been collected with equal judgment and learning, by the celebrated Long, in his treatise on diet. Cullen, at the commencement of his Materia Medica, has likewise bestowed some excellent considerations upon different parts of alimentary substances. It would be an unpardonable omission in this place not to mention, among the number of men whose works have eminently contributed to the perfection of eating and drinking, the name of Parmentier, a Frenchman, whose labours, constantly directed to tbe public good, have made known the nature and use of many nutritive substances, particularly those of the fari- naceous kind, and rescued from unmerited contempt one of the most abund- ant and useful articles of food; and which constitutes not only a general blessing to the poor of all countries, but a nutritive and wdiolesome source of dependence during times of scarcityâ€”namely, the potatoe. By the correctness of its descriptions, botany has instructed us how to distinguish useful food and agreeable seasoning, from destructive poisons, in all classes of aliment too much sought after : and the observations of many naturalists on mushrooms and poisonous plants, ought not to be passed over without honorable mention. Nor should we here forget to associate with such industrious and meritorious names, those, who by their labours have enlightened their fellow subjects, and warned them against the dangers to which they are too frequently exposed, and which have called forth prohi- bitory laws against the use of vessels and utensils made of copper and lead, under circumstances where these culinary articles are liable to be attacked by the alimentary matter which they are destined to contain, and thus be the channel of conveying destructive germs into the system, under the delu- sive external appearance of a salubrious nourishment, and of an agreeable fluid. The recent experiments of the British and other chemists have taught also the limits that ought to be observed between the useful and destructive properties of vegetable, mineral, and animal substances, not only as regards their medical, but also their dietetical, properties. And, lastly, the inquisitive eye of the anatomist directs itself over every living thing, and compares its structure with that of man, and places upon a parallel all the systems which compose the apparatus of their life. From man to Zoophytes, the French naturalist, Cuvier, has investigated and de- veloped the structure of the viscera, the dispositions of the nervous and muscular systems. He demonstrates in what order of animals the nutritive liquid circulates by the contractible power of the heart and arteries, and is

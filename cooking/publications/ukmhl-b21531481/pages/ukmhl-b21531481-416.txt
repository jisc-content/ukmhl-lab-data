The fourth order of vegetables con- sists of all the esculent roots, or such as ai’e used at our tables ; they are cither of the mild, or of the astrin- gent and acrid kind. The former are much more nourishing and less flatulent than the latter; which, how- ever, possesses some medicinal pro- perties, such as the various species of radislies, onions, garlic, and the like. Roots are neither so nourish- ing nor so easily digested as animal food. Yet we may consider it as a certain rule that any kind of aliment, for which we feel a natural and per- manent appetite, is conformable to our nature. Of this kind is that heneficial root the potatoe, which in the most simple preparation, and without any addition, affords an agreeable and wholesome food to almost e\'ery person, and particu- larly to children. It is one of the highest alimentary substances, occa- sioning neither viscidity nor flatu- lence, and can be hurtful only when immoderately taken. Rut being a dry vegetable and containing many earthy particles, it requires a |)ropcr quantity of drink to pr-event obstruc- tions. Its excellent nourishment is sufflcicntly obvious in the healthiness of those country people, whose prin- cipal food is potatoes, as well as in animals that arc fattened upon these roots.—Sec J^o/atocs—Roots. The fifth and last order of vegetable substances coiu])rehends the fruit, or ])roductions of the difl'erent trees and shrubs.—See Fruit. VENISON.—'I’he flesh of deer, game, or lieasfs of chase. The flesh of the deer kind, as the buck, the doe, the hart, the hind*, and also that of hares, contains much good nutri- ment ; but to the injury of health, these animals are generally eaten w'hen half putrified, though they are naturally much disposed to putres- cency. When properly dressed, they afford a mellow food, and are readily assimilated to our fluids. But as wild animals, from their con- stant motion and exercise, acquire a drier sort of flesh than that of the tame, it should never be boiled, but always ought to be roasted or stewed. From the same cause, the fluids of wild animals are more heating, and more apt to putrify, than those of the domestic kind. Persons, there- fore, w'hp are pre-disposed to scurvy or other putrid diseases, should not eat much game, especially in sum- mer. This pernicious tendency of game may be corrected by the addi- tion of vinegar, acid of lemons, or wine ; salad also is very proper to he eaten with it. Those parts of wild animals which have the least motion, are the most juicy and palatable : the back for instance, is the best part of a hare. Venison that is well fed, and killed at a proper season, is con- sidered not only the most wholesome of that kind of flesh, but also the most delicious. It is more tender than mutton, and much easier of digestion. The fat is a great deli- cacy', and very much esteemed by the veritable epicure.—SccFood,Animal, Varieties of. \'KRI)iGRIS, (.Erugo erris).— An impure subacetatc of copper.

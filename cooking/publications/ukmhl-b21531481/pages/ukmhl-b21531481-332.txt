SK SI 294 once having been actually knighted by one of our kings,* in a fit of royal condescension and jocularity, is now denominated sirloin. This ample joint has given rise to a well-known popular ballad, styled “The roast beef of old England;” and it still continues to cut a conspicuous figure at the tables of all “ who hospitably live, And strangers with good cheer re- ceive.”f Two sirloins joined together, without having the back bone cut asunder, are called a baron of beef. Thomson places the sirloin at the head of his autumnal feast: “ First the fuell’d chimney blazes wide; The tankards foam; and the strong table groans Beneath the smoking sir-loin, stretched immense From side to side, in which, with des- perate knife. They deep incision make, and talk the while Of England’s glory, ne’er to be defaced, While hence they borrow vigour.” SISYMBRIUM.—The name of a genus of plants in the Linntean sys- tem, so named from their fringed roots.

SKATE.-—When good, skate are very white and thick; if dressed too fresh, they are hard and unpleasant to the taste; they should therefore be kept a day or two, but not long enough to produce an unpleasant smell. SKATE, To Boil.—Put it into a fish kettle, with cold spring water, and plenty of salt; as soon as it boils set it aside, to simmer gently till done, and serve it up on a fish plate, with anchovy sauce in a boat. SKATE, To Fry.—The skate must be nicely crimped, then tossed on an egg, beaten up with pepper and salt, then on crumbs of bread, laying them on paper as they are done: have ready a stewpan nearly full of lard; when very hot, put in two or three pieces at a time to fry quickly, and when thoroughly done, put them on paper to drain from the fat. Serve them up in a dish gar- nished with fried parsley, and shrimp sauce in a boat.

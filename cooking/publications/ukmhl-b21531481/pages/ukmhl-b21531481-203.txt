In consequence of tliese changes the muscular fibre becomes opaque, shorter, firmer, and drier; the tendons less opaque, softer, and gluey; the fat is neither melted out, nor rendered semi-trans- parent. Animal fluids become more transparent, the albumen is coagu- lated, separated, and they dissolve gelatine and osmazome. Lastly, and which is the most important change, and the immediate object of all cookery, the meat loses the vapid nauseous taste and smell peculiar to Uie raw state, and it becomes sa- voury and grateful to the palate. Heat applied through the medium of boiling oil, or melted fat, as in frying, produces nearly the same changes, as the meat is sufficient to evaporate the water, and to induce a degree of scorching; but when water is the medium through which tlie heat is applied, as in boiling, stewing, and baking, the effects are somewhat different, as the heat never exceeds 212®, which is not sufficient to commence the process of brown- ing or decomposition, and the solu- ble constituents are removed by being dissolved in the water, form- ing soup or broth; or if the dii-ect contact of the water be prevented, they are dissolved in the juices of the meat, and separated in the form of gravy. Vvhether the heat be directly or indirectly applied, there must be a considerable loss in the cooking of animal substances, in public institutions, where the allowance of meat is generally weighed out in its raw state, and includes bones, and is served out cooked, and sometimes without bone; and it is a matter of importance to ascertain, tLs near as possible, their relative proportions. As regards this cir- cumstance much depends, on the piece of meat to be cooked, the degree of cookery, and the attention bestowed upon it. We have been informed by persons who salt rounds of beef to sell by retail, after they are boiled, that they are able to get nineteen pounds of cold boiled beef from twenty-five pounds of raw, but the meat, it must be confessed, is always underdone. Messrs. Donkin and Gamble boil- ed in steam thirty pounds of captain’s salt meat; the meat when cold, without the bones, which amounted to five pounds six ounces, weighed only thirty-five pounds; in another experiment, 113 pounds of prime mess beef gave nine pounds ten ounces of bone, and forty-seven pounds eight ounces of meat; and in a third experiment, 213 pounds of mess beef gave thirteen pounds eight ounces of bone, and 103 pounds ten ounces of meat; or taken in the ag- gregate, 372 pounds of salt meat, including the bones, furnish, when boiled, 186 pounds six ounces with- out bone, being about fifty per cent., or disregarding the bone altogether, salt must lose by boiling about 422 per cent. In roasting, the loss arises from the melting out of the fat, and the evaporating out of the water, but the nutritious matter remains con- densed in the cooked solid; and in boiling the loss is occasioned partly by the fat melted out, but chiefly from gelatine and osmazome dis- solved in water in which the meat is boiled; there is, therefore, a real loss of nourishment, unless the hroth he used, when this mode of cooking becomes the most profitable as well as the most economical. Wc are indebted to Professor Wallace, of Edinburgh, for the de- tail of a very accurate and extensive experiment in a public establish- ment, the results of which were, that in pieces of ten pounds weight each, 100 pounds of beef lost upon an average by boiling, twenty- six pounds four ounces; by baking, tliirty pounds

PREFACE. IV Under these points of consideration may be included the apparatus of digestion ; the processes of nutrition, assimilation, and renovation; the economy ofthe senses, and the regulation of those internal sensationsby which our constitutions may be either physically affected or morbidly deranged. It is this knowledge of the animal economy that directs us equally in the preservation of health as in the cure of diseases; since we thereby supply what is salutary for our subsistence, relieve what is oppressed in the system, open what is obstructed, strengthen what has become weak ; and thus restore to healthy action the wheels of life that had been previously clogged by disease. With these objects in view it became our province minutely to describe the nutritive qualities and other conducive properties of all known alimentary substances, solid or fluid, animal or vegetable, in common use; noting distinctly such as have less claim than others to these pretensions; at the same time, to lay down such rules and directions for the regulation of individual constitutions as each species might appear best to agree with, founded on the experience of both ancient and modern -writers. Suffice it further to say that, disclaiming all and every connexion with theories or preconceived opinions, the “ Dictionary of Diet,” so called, is deduced from, and based upon, the research and practi- cal experience, and confirmed by the hitherto unshaken opinions, of those high and standai'd authorities which have appeared in succession for the last 2000 years; at the same time that, independently, it presents a new typograjihical feature in the Materia Alimentaria, considerably improved, which hitherto has not been attempted.

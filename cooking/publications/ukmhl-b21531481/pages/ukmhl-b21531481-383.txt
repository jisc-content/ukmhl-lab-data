The exhibitions of the gla- diators were bloody and ferocious spectacles, which evinced the bar- barous taste of the age. The com- batants, however, were regularly trained by proper exercise, and a strict observance of regimen. In the more early stages, their diet consisted of dried figs, new cheese, and boiled grain. But afterwards animal food was introduced, as a part of the ath- letic regimen, and the preference was given to pork, which, Galen asserts, contains more real nutriment than the flesh of any other animal used as food—a fact which, he adds, is de- cidedly proved by the example of the Athlette, who, if they lived but for one day on any other kind of food, found their vigour manifestly im- paired the next. The preference, however, that was given by the an- cients to pork does not con-espond with the practice of modern trainees, who entirely reject it in their regi- men, though in the manner of pre- paring their food they exactly agree, roaxlimj or broiling being preferred to boiling by both, and bread unfer- menled, to that prepared by leaven. A very small (juantity of fluid was allowed, and this was principally water. When the daily exercises of the ancient Athletm were finished, they were refreshed by immersion in a tepid bath, where the scurf, pus- tules, or other unctuous or clammy exudations and adhesions were re- moved from the skin by the use of the strggil* The skin was then di- ligently rubbed dry, and again anointed with oil.

They then took their principal meal, after which they used no more exercise that day. They went occasionally into the cold bath in the morning. They were permitted to sleep as many hours as they chose, and great increase of vigour, as well as of bulk, was sup- posed to be derived from long conti- nued and sound repose. Previously to entering on this regimen, they were subjected to the evacuating process, by means of emetics, which they preferred to j)urgatives. The sexual intercourse was strictly inter- dicted, and “ to exercise their pa- tience, and accustom them to endure pain without flinching, they were occasionally flogged on the back with the branches of a kind of rhododen- dron, f till the blood flowed pretty plentifully. By diminishing the quantity of the circulating fluid, this rough kind of cupping xvas also con- sidered as salutary in obviating the tendency to plethora, to which they were peculiarly liable.” Pure and salubrious air was deemed an indis- pensable auxiliary, and accordingly, the principal schools of the Roman AthletBB were established in Capua and Ravenna, the most beautiful places in all Italy. The mode of training for strength and address practised by the ancients, hears some resemblance to that now ado])ted by the moderns.

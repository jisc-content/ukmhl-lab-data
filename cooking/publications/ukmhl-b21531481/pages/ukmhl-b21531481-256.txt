NU 218 NU food, changed by a series of decom- positions, animalized, and rendered similar to the being which it is de- signed to nourish, applies itself to those organs the loss of which it is to supply; and this identification of nutritive matter to our organs con- stitutes nutrition. The constituent parts of the living body are conti- nually on the decay, and a variety of causes are as continually carrying them oif; several of its organs are constantly engaged in separating humours, wliich pass off loaded with a part of its substance, consumed by the united action of air and caloric; while internal friction, by a pulsatory motion, detaches its particles. In this manner the animal machine is continually being destroyed; and, perhaps, at distant periods of life, it does not contain a single particle of the same constituent parts. The faculty of feeding, that is, of repairing the successive waste of the bodj', supposes a delicate sentiment, capable of choosing the aliments necessary and fit to be converted into or assimilated with our sub- stance, of rejecting such as are not analogous to its actual condition, or are not proportioned to the actual power of our organs of arranging the instruments which ought to di- vest these aliments of their nature, and of distributing exactly and pro- portionately throughout every jrart of the living body, the produce of their digestion. Every circumstance which accompanies the exercise of this function proves two essential points: the first, that the immediate organ in which it is exercised is not the only instrument; the other, that it is not the efiect of the particular sensibility and action of that organ, but of the general active principle, in which are united all the sensa- tions, and from which every motion emanates. This principle, in fact, serves as a distinguishing mark among all the important sensations which it is possible for the animal to experience, and which solicits it to recruit its exhausted strength, and to fortify, by fresh supplies, its de- pendencies, weakened by the suc- cession of vital motions. This sen- sation is subordinate to it; it is modified by it; and it is this alone which causes it to exist; for hunger is seldom proportioned to the real want of the living body; imaginary want, or habit, being the most fre- quent cause of this mute inquietude, which often induces us to take food. We succeed in silencing this sensa- tion, by giving it in exchange inte- resting occupations to which the mind yields. Strong passions, diseases, and other affections, may, for a length of time, suspend the impressions of hunger. One might easily believe, by seeing the solution of solids, and the putrid fluids of animals which have died from hunger, that these phenomena are the natural effects of the swooning of a body, which, like a flame, is extinguished for want of aliment, were it not known that ma- niacs can live for several months without eating. Might not the sudden changes sometimes occasioned by hunger be rather the result of a wandering sensibility, which, in its despair, reacting upon all the organs submitted to its influence, interdicts the order of their movement, de- stro3fs their texture, and abandons the fluids which they contain to all the energy of the physical causes which tend to change them?â€”See Hunger. An experiment made with madder, which, when mixed with the food of animals, reddens their bones, proves in a decisive manner this perpetual decomposition of living animal mat- ter, since, to remove or obliterate en- tirely the diffused red colour thus given to bones, it is only necessary for a time to suspend the use of the root. Therefore, if the compact and solid parts be in a continual motion of decomposition and recomposition, there can be no doubt that this mo-

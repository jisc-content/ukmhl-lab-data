385 WA WA turbid and impure, the larger the tracts of laud are, they waste iu their course; add to this, that they attract numerous heterogeneous parts from the bottom they flow over, whence there often arises a considerable dif- ference between rain and river water. Lastly, rivers being perpetually ex- posed to the open air and the action of the sun, have their most subtile parts exhaled and sublimed into the atmosphere so as to supply the mat- ter of clouds and rain. There is also a great difference between the waters of rivers; for those that have a swift course or run violently down from the mountains where tliey rise into the lower plains, are very different from those where the course is slow and gentle, and which rise in lower places: thus rapid rivers usually afford a light and subtile water not very subject to corruption, though somewhat im- proper for the feeding and nourish- ing of fish, because the rapidity of the motion prevents the spawn of the fish from adhering to the banks, so as to be there animated by the heat of the sun; but if these rapid rivers do not greatly abound with fish, the few they produce are excellent and well tasted. The rivers that flow gently differ from the former, not only on account of the immense quantities of fish they breed, but also because they generally run on fat clayey bottoms, or such as afford j>roper retreats and nutriments to fish, whence such rivers are not so clear and crystalline as those of a rapid course, but tben such waters are of a softer nature and serve for the purposes of washing, fulling, scouring, &c., without any consi- derable addition of soap. River waters are not, therefore, all alike, or equally ]>roper for medicinal j)ur- poses; those that should be made choice of on that account are clear and light, do not easily corrupt, and exhibit no alteration on the addition of oil of tartar or any metallic solu- tion ; and it must be constantly ob- served that rivers of a rapid course are universally more wholesome than those which flow with a slow and gentle current. Spring waters are also observed to difl'er in their virtues; for according to the different nature of the soil or the earthy matters they meet with or imbibe, they receive a different nature and disposition, whence we seldom find springs of a perfectly pure and light water. The gi-eatest ])art of them leave on distillation a copious earthy substance ; there are but few that do not turn thick with metalline solutions or alkaline salts; some of them contain common salt, and others a subtile volatile vitriol. If they contain common salt, oil of tartar will discover it, by its turning milky; if they contain a vitriolic principle, the infusion of galls will turn it black. Others again contain particles of iron, and thence acquire a styptic taste, and on standing some time in a hottle deposit an ocher. It is, therefore, the business of art and industry, out of so large a number of springs wherewith nature supplies us, to discover the most wholesome, which are known by their lightness, transparency, purity, long keeping, and the trials above mentioned: there is another difference observable in spring waters, some being hard and others soft; the latter will keej) the longest, and will not so easily freeze as the former. Roth of them are wholesome and medicinal, if pro- perly adapted to the disease and con- stitution of the ])atient. llavitig thus shewn which waters are most proper for medicinal uses, and how they are distinguished and exanuned, we shall jiroceed to prove the excellency and universal virtue of pure water. Pure and light waters are agreeable to the different natures and constitutions of all men for the circulation of the fluids, being that which preserves and secures the body from corruption, and keeps the blood 2 L

112 National Training School for Cookery. 8. We take a quarter of a pound of suet, put it on a board, cut away all the skin, and chop it up as finely as possible. 9. We should sprinkle a little flour over the suet to pre- vent it from sticking to the board or knife. 10. We grate some bread crumbs with a grater on to the board. 11. We take two or three sprigs of parsley, wash them in cold water and dry them in a cloth. 12. We put the parsley on a board and chop it up as finely as possible ; when chopped there should be about one tablespoonful. 13. We take a sprig of thyme, lemon thyme, and marjoramy rub them through a strainer, or chop them up finely on a board ; there should be about one dessertspoonful of the mixed herbs. 14. We now mix the chopped suet and bread crumbs well together. 15. We then add the parsley and the herbs, one teaspoon- fid of salty and pepper to taste, and mix them thoroughly together. 16. We now mix it with one gill (a quarter of a pint) of milk. 17. We take the heart and fill all the cavities with the stuffings pressing it in as firmly as possible. N.B.—If there is any stuffing over, it can be put aside for the sauce. 18. We take a piece of kitchen paper, and grease it well with a piece of butter or dripping. 19. We place this piece of greased paper over the top of the heart where the cavities are, and tie it on tightly with string. 20. We put the roasting screen in front of the fire, to keep off the draught, and to keep in all the heat. N.B.—A chair .with a cloth over it, would answer the purpose if there was no screen. 21. We put the dripping-pan, or a large dish, down on a stand within the screen close to the fire, with the dripping ladle or a large spoon in it.

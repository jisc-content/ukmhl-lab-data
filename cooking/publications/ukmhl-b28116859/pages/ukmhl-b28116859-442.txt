DIRECTIONS.—In tapping a cask, take out the key, and with the hand press the part of the stem marked B against the cork, and by turning it round at the same-time it will cut its way through; push it then up to the shoulder. When the tap is taken out of the cask, the piece of cork will be left inside the stem A B ; this can be easily extracted by a corkscrew, and is again ready for use. ADVANTAGES.—The tap is made of white metal, and the wearing parts are of patent glass. The top sliding piece moves from off the bottom hole by means of a screw placed outside the liquid, con- sequently there is no friction, and ales or wines are kept perfectly clear, and, coming into contact with glass only, it is free from all taste of the metal. No acids or cyders will eat into the glass, as it does in all metals, and there will be no leak. Nothing but the pressure of the hand is required to tap a cask. Nothing will be spilt in doing so. No paper required to wrap round the stem. The operation so easy that the finest liquors are not disturbed. Cannot be damaged either in tapping or taking out, and once used will be found THE MOST PERFECT TAP ON RECORD. THOMAS BURBIDGE, 69, Hatton Garden, London, E.C. Works: Union Foundry, Melksham, Wilts.

Now we will show you how to make Haricot Mutton. 1. We take the best end of the neck of mutton and put it on a board. 2. We take a saw and saw off the end of the rib bone; leaving the cutlet bone three inches in length. 3. We saw off the chine bone which lies at the back of the cutlets. 4. We joint each cutlet with a chopper. 5. We take a sharp knife and cut off each cutlet. 6. We take a cutlet-bat and beat each cutlet to about rather more than half an inch in thickness. 7. We trim the cutlet round, leaving about half an inch of the rib bone bare. 8. We form the cutlets to a good shape. N.B.—The trimmings of the cutlets should be put aside, as the fat may be clarified and used for dripping (see Lesson on “ Frying ”). 9. We take one onion, peel it, and cut it in slices. 10. We put the onion and the cutlets in a stewpan, with two ounces of butter.

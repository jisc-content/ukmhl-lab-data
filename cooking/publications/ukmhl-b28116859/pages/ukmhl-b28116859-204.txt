We take one sole, wash it well, and lay it on a board. 2. We take a sharp knife and cut off all the outside finsy the head, and the tail. 3. We take the skin off the sole, from the tail to the head. 4. We cut down the centre of the fish. 5. We slide the knife along carefully between the flesh and the bones, holding the flesh in one hand and drawing it gently away as the knife cuts it away from the bone. 6. We do both sides of the fish alike, and it will make four fillets. 7. We put each fillet separately on a plate, and rub it over with flour. 8. We take a wire sieve and stand it over a piece of paper. 9. We take some crumb of bread and rub it through the sieve. 10. We take one egg and beat it on a plate with a knife. 11. We lay the fillets in the egg, and egg them well all over with a brush.

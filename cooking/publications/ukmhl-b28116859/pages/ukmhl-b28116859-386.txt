N.B.—We must keep our hands well floured all through the process of bread making. 10. We turn the dough out on a well-floured board, and knead it well, using up a good deal more flour. 11. We divide the dough into six equal pieces, knead each piece separately, and make into a loaf N.B.—If the bread is to be baked in tins, we form each loaf into a dumpling or ball (with a smooth surface and no cracks in it), either long or round according to the shape of the tin. 12. We put the bread into the tins, which should be well floured. 13. We cut a slit in the top of the dough, or prick it with a fork. N.B.—If the bread is to be made into cottage loaves,— 14. We divide each piece into two, one rather larger than the other. 15. We make each into a ball, put the smaller one on the top of the other, and press our forefinger into the middle of the top. N.B.—Cottage loaves are baked on floured tins. N.B.—If there are no tins the oven shelf should be washed and floured, and a tin is not then necessary. 16. We let the loaves rise half an hour in a warm place before we put them in the oven. 17. We then put them in the oven (the heat should rise to 280°, and after a quarter of an hour be reduced to 220°) for about one hour and a half N.B.—To test if the Ircad is sufficiently baked we should run a clean knife into the loaves, and if it comes out perfectly bright the bread is done. 18. When we take the bread out of the oven we stand each loaf up on its side to cool.

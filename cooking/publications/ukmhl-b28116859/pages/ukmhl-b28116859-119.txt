Lessons on Cooking Meat.—Roast Bullock's Heart. 113 22. We hang the roasting-jack up from the mantelpiece over the dripping-pan. N.B.—If there is no roasting jack, we can manage with a strong piece of worsted tied to a poor man’s jack. 23. We must wind up the jack with its key, before we put the meat on. 24. We take the hook of the roasting-jack and pass it through the heart, and hang it on the jack or the worsted. N.B.—If the heart is hanging from a piece of worsted, we must twist the worsted occasionally to make it go round. 25. We put about one ounce of clarified dripping into the dripping-pan and baste the heart occasionally. 26. It will take about two hours to roast. 27. We now take the deaf ears out of the water and put them into a saucepan with one pint of cold water. 28. We put the saucepan on the fire to boil. 29. We take one small onion, peel it, and cut it in quarters. 30. When the water boils, we put in the onion, and a little salt and pepper to taste. 31. We now move the saucepan to the side of the fire, put the lid on, and let it stew gently until five minutes before the heart is done. 32. We must watch it and skim it occasionally. 33. After that time we strain the liquor into a basin. 34. We wash out the saucepan, and put in it one ounce of butter and put it on the fire to melt. 35. When the butter is melted, we add one tablespoonfd of flour, and mix them smoothly together with a wooden spoon. 36. We now pour in by degrees the liquor and stir smoothly until it boils and thickens. 37. We then stand the saucepan by the side of the fire until required for use. 38. When the heart is roasted, we take it down, place the heart on a hot dish and draw out the hook. 11

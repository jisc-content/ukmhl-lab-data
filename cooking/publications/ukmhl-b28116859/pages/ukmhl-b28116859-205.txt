Lessons on Cooking Fish.—Fried Fillets of Sole. 199 Now it is finished. 12. We then put them in the bread crumbs and cover them well. We should be careful to finger them as little as possible. 13. We take a saucepan and put in it one pound and a half of lard or clarified dripping. Now we must make the Butter Sauce with Anchovy (see below). 14. We put the saucepan on the fire to heat the fat. Test the heat of it by throwing in a piece of bread’ and if it makes a fizzing noise it is ready. N.B.—The heat is tested best by a frimometer ; the heat should rise to 345°. 15. We take a frying basket and place in it the fillets. 16. The fillets should be slightly bent, or folded over, to prevent their being quite flat when fried. 17. When the fat is quite hot we put in the frying basket with the fillets for three minutes. 18. We put a piece of whitey-brown paper on a plate. 19. When the fillets are done, they should be a pale brown ; we turn them out on to the paper on the plate to drain off the grease. 20. We serve them in a hot dish on a napkin, garnished with a little fried parsley [Refer to “Fish,” Lesson No. 7, Note 41]. 1. We take a stewpan, and put in it one ounce of butter and half an ounce of flour. 2. We mix them well with a wooden spoon. 3. We add one gill and a half of cold water. 4. We put the stewpan on the fire, and stir well with a wooden spoon until the mixture is quite smooth and boils. 5. We take the stewpan off the fire, and stand it on a piece of paper on the table. 6. We now add one tablespoonful of anchovy sauce, and stir it well into the butter sauce. 7. For serving we pour it into a sauceboat.

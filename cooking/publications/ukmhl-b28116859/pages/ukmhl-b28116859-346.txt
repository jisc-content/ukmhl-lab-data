340 National Training School for Cookery. SOUFFLES. Lesson No. 3. POTATO SOUFFLE. Average cost of “ Potato SouffleT d. 1\ 8 Time required, about an hour. Now we will show you how to make Potato Soufflt. 1. We take four good sized potatoes, wash and scrub them with a scrubbing brush in a basin of cold water. 2. We take them out of the water, and dry them with a cloth. 3. We put them in the oven (the heat should rise to 230°) to bake; they will take from half an hour to three quarters of an hour, according to the heat of the oven, and the size of the potatoes. 4. We take a steel fork or skewer, and stick it into the potatoes to see if they are done. They must be soft inside. N.B.—This should be carefully done so as not to spoil the potato skins. 5. When they are done we take them out and cut them (with a sharp knife) in half—so that each half of the potato will stand—because we shall want to use the skins to put the potato into them again. 6. We take a small spoon and scoup out carefully all the inside of the potatoes. We must take care not to make holes or spoil the skins in any way. 7. We take a wire sieve and put it over a plate, and take ' the inside of the potatoes and rub it through with a wooden spoon. INGREDIENTS. 4 potatoes 1 oz. of butter \ a gill of milk 4 eggs Seasoning

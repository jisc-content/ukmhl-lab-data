396 National Training School for Cookery. Now it is finished SICK-ROOM COOKERY. Lesson No. 12. BRAN TEA. Average cost of “ Bran Tea ” (one quart). INGREDIENTS. 3 tablespoonsful of bran. 1 x. Sugar or honey. j 4 * 3 tablespoonsful of bran. 1 x. Sugar or honey. j 4 * Time required, about twenty minutes. Now we will show you how to make Bran Tea. 1. We put a kettle of warm water on the fire to boil. 2. We take three tablespoonsful of bran (not too coarse, for that is greasy) and put it into a large jug. N.B.—Bran is the husk of the grain which is sifted from the flour after the wheat is ground by the miller. 3. When the water is quite boiling, we pour one quart into the jug. 4. We cover the jug and let it stand for a quarter of an hour to draw. 5. When it is drawn, we strain off the tea through a piece of muslin, and sweeten it according to taste with either sugar or honey. N.B.—When wine is good for the patient it maybe added to the tea, or lemon juice, but it is very good without. N.B.—This is an invaluable drink for softening the throat.

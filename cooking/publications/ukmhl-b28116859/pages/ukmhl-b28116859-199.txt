Lessons on Cooking Fish.— Whitebait. 193 FISH. Lesson No. 3. WHITEBAIT. Whitebait varies in price ; it is in season from July to September. Now we will show you how to fry Whitebait 1. We take the whitebait, wash them in iced water, pick them over carefully, and dry them well in a cloth. 2. We take a sheet of paper and put on it a good tea- cupful offlour. 3. We take the whitebait, and sprinkle them in the flour. They must not touch each other, and we must finger them as little as possible. 4. We take up the paper and shake the whitebait well in the flour, so that they are well covered with flour. 5. We turn the whitebait from the paper of flour into a whitebait basket, and sift all the loose flour back on to the paper. 6. We take a saucepan and put in it one pound and a half of lard or clarified dripping. 7. We put the saucepan on the fire to heat the fat. When the fat smokes it will then be hot enough. N.B.—The fat requires to be much hotter for frying whitebait than for any- thing else. N.B.—If possible the fat should be tested by a frimometer, and the heat should rise to 400 degrees Fahrenheit. 8. We then turn the whitebait a few at a time into the frying basket and put it into the fat for one minute. The whitebait should be quite crisp. 9. We put a piece of whitey-brown paper on a plate, stand the plate near the fire and turn the fried whitebait on to the paper to drain off the grease. (We serve them on a napkin on a hot dish. Lemon cut, and thin slices of brown bread and butter should be served with the white- bait) Now it is finished. N

Now we will show you how to make a plain Rice Pudding. 1. We take a pint dish and hitter it well inside. 2. We take one ounce and a half of Carolina rice, and wash it well in two or three waters. 3. We put the rice into the buttered dish, and sprinkle over it a tablespoonful of moist sugar. 4. We fill up the dish with new milk. N.B.—Nutmeg may be grated, or founded cinnamon be sifted, over the top of the pudding before it is put in the oven. 5. We put the dish into a moderate oven (the heat should be about 220°) to bake for two hours. 6. We must watch it occasionally, and as the rice soaks up the' milk, more milk should be added (carefully lifting up the skin and pouring the milk in at the side), so as to keep the dish always full.

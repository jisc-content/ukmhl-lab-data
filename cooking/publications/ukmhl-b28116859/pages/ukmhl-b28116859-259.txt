Lessons on Making Pastry.—Suet Crzist. 253 8. We roll out the paste once, to the thickness of rather more than one-eighth of an inch. N.B.—Now the paste is ready for use, and if it is required for beef-steak pudding— 9. We take a quart pudding basin, and butter it well inside. 10. We line the basin smoothly inside with paste. 11. We take a knife, flour it, and cut away the paste that is above the edge of the basin. 12. We fold this paste together, and roll it out to a round, the size of the top of the basin, one-eighth of an inch in thickness. 13. We take two pounds of rump or beef-steak, put it on a board, and cut it into thin slices. 14. We flour the slices well (using about a tablespoonftil of flour), and season them with plenty of pepper and salt. 15. We take one dozen oysters, and the liquor that is with them, and put them into a saucepan. 16. We put the saucepan on the fire, and just bring them to the boil. N.B.—This is to blanch the oysters. 17. We take the saucepan off the fire, and strain the oyster liquor into a basin. 18. We take the oysters and lay them on a plate. 19. We cut off the beards and all the hard parts of the oysters, leaving only the soft part. 20. We roll up the slices of beef-steak, and fill the basin with the meat and the oysters. N.B.—If oysters be disliked, kidneys might be used instead, or the pudding might be flavoured with shallot, parsley, and mushrooms, according to taste. 21. We now pour into the basin the liquor from the oysters, and one gill of stock (see Lesson on “ Stock”). 22. We wet the paste round the edge of the basin with cold water, and cover over the top of the basin with the round of paste.

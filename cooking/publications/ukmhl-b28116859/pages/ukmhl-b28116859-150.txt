INGREDIENTS. i fowl i| oz. of butter Stock or water ■ i carrot i small onion A bouquet of herbs i oz. of flour J pint of milk Gill of cream, 4 5l Time required at out one hour and a quarter. Now we will show you how to prepare a Fowl and truss it for boiling. 1. We take a fowl that has been already plucked, and put it on a board. 2. We prepare it and clean it in the same way as described in “ Trussing a Fowl for Roasting,” from Note I to Note 12. 3. We take a sharp knife and cut off the claws, and the end of the legs of the fowl to the first joint. 4. We take a twist of paper or taper and light it. 5. We take the fowl up by its legs, and hold the lighted paper under it to singe off the little hairs. 6. We then hold the fowl up by its wings and singe the other end. N.B.—We must be careful in singeing not to blacken or mark the fowl in any way. 7. We turn the fowl on its back with the tail towards us. 8. We put our hands through the incision (made for drawing the fowl), and pass two fingers round the inside of the leg, so as to loosen the outside skin. 9. We draw this outside skin right off the legs, and press the legs well into the sides of the fowl, forcing the breast up to give the fowl a good shape. j. d. ..36 .. o if | o 1 .. 02 } o .. 06

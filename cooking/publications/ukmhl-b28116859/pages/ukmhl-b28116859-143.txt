We take a sheep's head (which has been previously chopped half way through by the butcher) and put it in a basin of warm water, with a dessertspoonful of salt. 2. We should wash the head thoroughly, carefully re- moving the brains (which should be put aside) and all the splinters of the bones. 3. We should wash away all the blood and matter from the passages of the nose, throat, and ears, and clean round the gums. N.B.—If this is not thoroughly done the sheep’s head will be spoiled. 4. We now put the sheep's head in a basin of salt and water, to soak for two hours. 5. After the head has been soaked, we take it out of the water and carefully cut the tongue out with a knife. 6. We tie the head together with a piece of string, to keep it in shape. 7. We put the head and the tongue in a large saucepan.

Now we will show you how to prepare a Fowl and truss it for roasting. 1. We take a suitable fowl that has been already plucked, and put it on a board. 2. We turn the fowl on its breast, and make an incision of an inch long down the neck, three inches below the head. 3. We pass our thumb round this incision and loosen the skin. 4. We take a sharp knife and put it under the skiny and cut off the neck as near the body as possible. 5. We must be careful in cutting off the neck to leave a piece of skin to fold over on to the back of the neck and cover the opening. 6. We take out the crop which lies in the front of the neck. 7. Then with our finger we loosen the liver and the other parts at the breast end. 8. We must now turn the fowl round, and make an inci- sion at the vent, about one inch and a half wide. 9. We must put our hand through this incision into the body and draw out all the interiors carefully, so as not to mess the fowl.

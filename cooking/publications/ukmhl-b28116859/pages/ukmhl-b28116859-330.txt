324 National Training School for Cookery. 6. We then take the pieces out, and wash them thoroughly in a basin of cold water. 7. We empty the water out of the saucepan, and wash it out well. 8. We put the pieces of foot back in the saucepan, cover- ing them well with cold water (about two quarts will be enough for a moderate sized foot). 9. We put the saucepan on the fire, and when it boils we should move it to the side of the fire and let it stew gently for six hours. 10. We must watch it and skim it carefully with a spoon from time to time. 11. After that time we strain off the stock into a basin, and put it aside to cool. N.B.—The foot we should put aside until required for use. 12. When the stock is quite cold we take an iron spoon, dip it in hot water, and carefully skim off the fat. 13. We take a clean cloth, dip it in hot water, and wipe over the top of the jelly, so as to remove every particle of fat. N.B.—For Porter Jelly, see below. 14. We take two lemons, wipe them with a cloth to be sure that they are quite clean, and peel them very thinly with a sharp knife. N.B.—We must be careful in peeling the lemons not to cut any of the white skin, as it would make the jelly bitter. 15. We put the peel of one lemon into the stewpan or saucepan. 16. We cut the lemons in halves, and squeeze the juice of the two into the saucepan. N.B.—We must be careful to remove all the pips. 17. We take one egg, put the yolk in one basin and the white in another. 18. We whip up the white of the egg slightly. 19. We put the whipped white of the egg and the egg shell into the saucepan. 20. We put in a quarter of a pound of lump sugar, half an inch of the stick of cinnamon, four cloves, and about a quarter oj an inch of saffron.

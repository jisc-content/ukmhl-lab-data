312 National Training School for Cookery. 10. We take the pieces of the feet out of the basin and put them in the stew-pan with five pints of cold water. N.B.—This stock will be reduced to about one pint and a half, when it is sufficiently boiled. 11. We put the stew-pan on the fire to boil. 12. We must watch it and skim it often with a skimming spoon. 13. We must let it boil very gently for five hours. 14. After that time we strain, oft* the liquor through a hair sieve into a basin. 15. We must put this basin in a cool place for some hours, until the stock is perfectly cold and is in a jelly. 16. We now take this basin of jelly stock and skim oft* all the fat carefully with a spoon. 17. We take a clean cloth and put it in hot water. 18. We take this damp cloth and dab it over the jelly stock, so as to remove every particle of grease. 19. We take a clean dry cloth and rub lightly over the jelly stock to dry it. 20. We take tivo lemons, wipe them clean in a cloth, and peel them very thinly with a sharp knife. N.B.—We must be careful, in peeling the lemons, not to cut any of the white skin, as it would make the jelly bitter. 21. We put the lemon peel into a stew-pan. 22. We squeeze the juice of the two lemons through a strainer into the stew-pan. 23. We take two eggs and put the yolks in one basin, and the whites in another. 24. We whip the whites of the eggs slightly, but not very stiff. 25. We put the zvhipped white of the egg into the stew- pan and the crushed egg shell. 26. We put in also two ounces of loaf sugar, one inch of the stick of cinnamon, and four cloves. 27. We whip all these together with a whisk.

INGREDIENTS. \ lb. of Patna rice ,... 5 of a teaspoonful of salt Time required, about half an hour. Now we will show you how to boil Rice to be served with curry, &c. 1. We take a large stewpan and pour in it four quarts of water. 2. We put the stewpan on the fire to boil the water. 3. We take half a pound of Patna rice, put it in a basin of cold water, and wash it well. 4. We drain off the water and rub the rice with our hands. 5. We must carefully pick out all the yellow grains and bits of black. 6. We must wash the rice in this manner four times. 7. Just before putting the rice on to boil we must pour some fresh cold water over it. 8. When the water in the stewpan is quite boiling, we throw the rice into it, stirring it round with a spoon. 9. We must add one quarter of a teaspoonfid of salt, which will make the scum rise. 10. We must take a spoon and skim it occasionally. 11. The rice should boil fast from fifteen to twenty minutes. N.B.—To test if the rice is sufficiently boiled, we should take out a grain or two, and press it between the thumb and finger, and if quite done, it will mash. 12. We now pour the rice out of the saucepan into a cullender to drain off the water.

INGREDIENTS. s. d. 2 a quartern of dough o 4 2 eggs o 2 £ lb. of sugar o i£ 1 lb. of currants o 4! 1 o Time required, about an hour and a half. Now we will show you how to make a Dough Cake. 1. We put half a quartern of dough (made as for bread\ see “ Bread,” Lesson No. 1) into a basin. 2. We take one pound of currants, wash them, dry them in a cloth, and pick them over to see there are no stones mixed with them. 3. We add the currants and half a pound of moist sugar to the dough. N.B.—If liked, half a teaspoonful of mixed spice might be added. 4. We now break two eggs into the basin, and beat all the ingredients well together. 5. We take aquartern tin, and grease it well inside with dripping. 6. We turn the mixture into the greased tin. 7. We put the tin into the oven (the heat should rise to 240°) until the cake is sufficiently baked ; it will take about forty minutes. 1 N.B.—To test if the cake is done we should run a clean knife into it, and if it comes out clean the cake is sufficiently baked. 8. We then turn the cake out of the tin, and place it on its side, leaning against a plate until it is cold. N.B.—This will prevent it getting heavy.

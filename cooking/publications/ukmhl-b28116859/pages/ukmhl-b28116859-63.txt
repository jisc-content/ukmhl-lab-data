Now we will show you how to make a Savoury Hash. 1. We put one ounce of bittter into a saucepan and put it on the fire to melt. 2. We take half an onion, peel it, and cut it in slices. 3. We put the onion into the butter. 4. We also stir in half an ounce of flour, and let all fry for a minute or two to brown. 5. We take a tin of Australian mutton, open it carefully, and remove the fat from the part of the meat required for immediate use. N.B.—We should clarify the fat by putting it into boiling water, and when it is cold it can be used as dripping. 6. We take one and a half pound of the mutton out of the tin. 7. If all the meat is required for present use, we should turn it all out of the tin, and we should then rinse out the tin with half a pint of warm water to make the gravy for the hash. N.B.—If all the meat has not been taken out of the tin, we should take some of the jelly out of the tin, and melt it in half a pint of warm water to make the gravy.

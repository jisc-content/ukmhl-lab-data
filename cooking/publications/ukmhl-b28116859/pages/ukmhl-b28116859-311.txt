Now we will show you how to make a Cold Cabinet Pudding. 1. We take a pint mould and ornament the bottom of it (according to taste) with the dried cherries, and pieces of angelica. 2. We split the sponge-biscuits in half, and line the inside of the tin with them and the ratafias in the moidd. N.B.—We must place the biscuits only round the sides of the tin (not over the bottom), arranging them alternately back and front next the tin. 3. We break four eggs, put the yolks in a basin (the whites we put aside, as they are not required for present, use), and beat them well with a wooden spoon. 4. We stir half a pint of milk into the eggs, and pour the mixture into a jug. 5. We take a saucepan, fill it half full of hot water, and put it on the fire to boil, when the water boils we move the saucepan to the side of the fire. u

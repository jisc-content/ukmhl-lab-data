Rational draining Sfjwl for (Mbs ^bkrtim. September 25, 1B79. Edition1, 2000 Copies. THE NEW GAS COOKER. The above Cookers are jacketted on the sides, top, and door, with a new and very efficient non- conducting material, by the use of which a great saving of Gas, to the extent of 40 per cent, is effected, by preventing loss of heat in the oven by radiation. The material is a Silica, specially prepared for us, and experiments show that its non-conducting properties are superior to those of Hair Felt (which has long been considered the best non-conductor), while it has the advantage of not being destroyed or affected by heat. Stoves made in this way are, of course, a little higher in price than those which are not jacketted, but when the saving in the daily consumption of gas is taken into account, the former are really the cheaper. “The best Gas Stove I have seen.”—W. B., Birmingham. “ It is simply perfect. I can suggest no improvement.”—G. W., Leominster. “ Will do any amount of work required by a private family at a great saving of fuel.”—J. W., Retford. “ It is far superior to any others.”—H. R., Handsworth. “ It has roasted, baked bread, boiled for three (and sometimes four) meals per day for six persons, at a cost of 4d. per day. We never have a coal fire.”—R. C., North Shields.—For Prices apply to JOHN WRIGHT & CO., ESSEX WORKS, BROAD STREET, BIRMINGHAM. LONDON WAREHOUSES—155a, Upper Thames-st. & 1, Little Bush Lane. D D

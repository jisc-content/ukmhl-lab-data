INGREDIENTS. d. % lb. of mince meat 3^ 1 lb. of flour 2-\. \ lb. of dripping 4 1 teaspoonful of baking powder 1 Seasoning 1 | 4 sage leaves i 1 egg 1 11 Time required, half an hour. Now we will show you how to make Sausage Rolls. 1. We take a tin of Australian mince meat and open it carefully. 2. We take a spoon and carefully remove the fat from the top of the meat. N.B.—The fat should be clarified by putting it into a basin of boiling tvater, and when cold can then be used as dripping. 3. We take half a pound of the mince meat out of the tin, put it in a basin, and season it well with pepper and salt. 4. We take four sage leaves, put them on a board, and chop them up as finely as possible with a knife. 5. We mix the chopped sage well into the mince meat with a spoon. 6. We put one pound of flour into another basin. 7. We add to it one teaspoonful of baking powder, salt (as much as would cover a threepenny piece), and half a pound of clarified dripping. 8. We rub the dripping well into the four with our hands. N.B.—We must mix it thoroughly, and be careful not to leave any lumps.

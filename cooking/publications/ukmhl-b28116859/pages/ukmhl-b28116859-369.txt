Lessons on Making Cakes.—Cornflour Cake. 363 Now it is finished. CAKES. Lesson No. 6. CORNFLOUR CAKE. Average cost of a “ Cornflour Cake ” (about three-quarters of a found). INGREDIENTS. d £ lb. of cornflour 2 1 lb. of loaf sugar 1 2 oz. of butter 2 1 teaspoonful of baking powder o| 2 eggs 2 7\ Time required, about one hour. Now we will show you how to make a Cornflour Cake. 1. We put two ounces of butter into a basin, and beat it to a cream. 2. We add to the butter a quarter of a pound of pounded loaf sugar, and mix it well. 3. We break in two eggs and beat all well together. 4. We now stir lightly into the mixture a quarter of a pound of cornflour and a teaspoonful of baking powder, and beat it well together for five minutes. 5. We grease a cake tin inside with butter or dripping. 6. We pour the mixture into the tin and put it imme- diately into the oven (the heat should rise to 240°) to bake for half an hour. 7. After that time we turn the cake out of the tin and slant it against a plate until it is cold. (This will prevent its getting heavy.) N.B.—If preferred, the mixture could be baked in small tins instead of one large one, in which case it would only take fifteen minutes to bake.

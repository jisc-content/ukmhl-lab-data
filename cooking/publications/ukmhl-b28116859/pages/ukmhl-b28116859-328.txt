For serving the Cow-Heel with Onion Sauce:— 1. We take three or four onions, peel them, and cut them in quarters. 2. We put them into a saucepan with half a pint of milk. 3. We put the saucepan on the fire to boil till the onions are quite tender ; it will take about one hour. 4. After that time we strain off the milk into a basin, put the onions on a board, and chop them up small. 5. We put half an ounce of butter into the saucepan and put it on the fire to melt. 6. When the butter is melted we add half an ounce of flour, and mix them smoothly together with a wooden spoon. 7. We pour the milk in gradually, stirring it till it boils and thickens. 8. We then add the onions, season with pepper and salt according to taste ; and move the saucepan to the side of the fire. 9. We put the pieces of cow-heel into the sauce, and let them warm through. 10. For serving we put the pieces of cow-heel on a hot dish, and pour over them the onion sauce. N.B.—The meat from the cow-heel might be served as a curry. The curry should be made in the same way as described in "Cooked Meat,” Lesson No. 4. N.B.—1The bones of the cow-heel should be put into the stock-pot.

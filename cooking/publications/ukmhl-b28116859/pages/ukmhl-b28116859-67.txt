Now we will show you how to make a Curry. 1. We take a rabbit [which has been skinned and pro- perly prepared for cooking] and put it on a board. 2. We cut it up in the same way as for carving, thus :— taking care that the pieces are nearly all of one size. N.B.—Chicken, veal, and other meats would serve the purpose for curry as well as rabbit. 3. We take a quarter of an ounce of coriander seed, put it into the mortar and pound it very finely with a pestle. 4. We take the pounded seed out of the mortar and put it on a piece of paper; we must scrape out the mortar cleanly so that none be lost. 5.

INGREDIENTS. d. 1 lb. of scraps of bread i J x quart of milk 5 2 eggs 2 2 tablespoonsful of moist sugar o§ 4 oz. of raisins or currants 1 10 Time required, three-quarters of an hour. Now we will show you how to make a Bread Pudding. 1. We put one pound of scraps of bread into a basin, with plenty of cold water to soak. N.B.—Any scraps of bread, either crumb or crust, however stale, so long as they are not mouldy or burnt, can be used for this pudding. 2. We put one quart of milk into a saucepan, and put it on the fire to boil. 3. We put into the milk a piece of butter the size of a nut, to prevent it from burning. 4. We take the bread out of the basin and squeeze out all the water. 5. We empty the water out of the basin, and put back the bread. 6. When the milk boils we pour it over the bread' and let the bread soak until it is soft. 7. We break two eggs into a small basin, add to them two tablespoonsful of moist sugar, and beat them lightly together. 8. We take four ounces of large raisins and stone them, or, if currants are preferred, we should wash them, dry them in a cloth, and pick them over to see there are no stones with them.

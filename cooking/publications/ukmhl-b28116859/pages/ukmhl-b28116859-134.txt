Now we will show you how to boil Pig's Head. 1. We take a pig's head, wash it thoroughly in plenty of tepid water. 2. We take out the brains and throw them away. 3. We cut out the little veins and all the splinters of bone. 4. We wash the head in all parts with plenty of salt, thoroughly cleansing it from blood. 5. We lay the head in pickle (see Pickle for Meat) for three days. 6. When the head is salted, we put it into a saucepan with cold water enough to cover it. 7. We put the saucepan on the fire to boil. 8. When it boils we draw the saucepan to the side of the fire, and let it simmer gently for from one hour and a half to two hours, according to the size and age of the pig. N.B.—Boiled pig’s head is eaten with boiled rabbit, or with veal, or with onion sauce. N.B.—If preferred thepig’s head can be made into brawn (see below). For making Onion Sauce, 9. We take three or four onions, peel them, and cut them in quarters.

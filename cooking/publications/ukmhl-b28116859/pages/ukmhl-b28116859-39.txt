Now we will show you how to make a Curry. 1. We put two ottnees of clarified dripping or butter into a saucepan, and put it on the fire to heat. 2. We take one onion, peel it, put it on a board, and chop it up as finely as possible. 3. When the dripping is quite hot we put in the chopped onion to brown ; we must be careful it does not burn. 4. We should shake the saucepan occasionally to prevent the onion from sticking to the bottom. 5. We take the cold meat and cut it up into small pieces. 6. We take one small apple, peel it, take out the core, and chop it up very finely on a board. 7. When the onion is sufficiently brown we should strain it off, and pour the dripping back into the saucepan. N. B.—We should put the browned onion on a plate. 8. We now put the pieces of cold meat into the saucepan, and let them brown on both sides. 9. We add one dessertspoonful of curry powder, the chopped apple, and a little salt, according to taste.

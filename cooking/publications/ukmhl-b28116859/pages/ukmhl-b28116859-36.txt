30 National Training School for Cookery. Now it is finished. 7. We stand the batter aside for one hour to rise, or until required for frying, but it should not stand longer than two hours. 8. We put half a pound of clarified dripping (see Lesson on “ Frying ”) into a saucepan, and put it on the fire to heat. 9. We take some cold meat, and cut it up into thin slices. N.B.—Cold boiled, or roast pork, or boiled bacon is very nice fried in batter. 10. When the batter has risen and the fritters are re- quired for use, we stir the batter lightly with a spoon, so as to be sure that there are no lumps settled at the bottom. 11. When the dripping is quite hot and smoking, we take the slices of meat, dip them in the batter so that they are quite covered, and then drop them into the hot fat. N.B.—We must not put in too many slices at a time, as they should not touch each other. 12. We must turn them over so that they are fried a nice brown on both sides. 13. We put a piece of kitchen paper on a plate. 14. As the fritters are fried, we take them carefully out of the fat with aperforated spoon, and put them on the paper to drain off the grease. N.B.—We must be careful to skim the fat from time to time, or the little loose pieces of batter will burn and spoil the fat. N.B.—Slices of apple or orange can be fried in this batter in the same way, only that the batter should be sweetened, and sugar sprinkled over the fritters when they are fried. N.B.—Fish can be fried in batter the same way, only that the batter is usually made with beer instead of white of egg. 15. For serving, we turn the fritters on to a hot dish.

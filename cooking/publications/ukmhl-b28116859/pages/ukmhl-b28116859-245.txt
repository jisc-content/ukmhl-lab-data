Lessons on Making Sauces.—Brown Sauce. 239 SAUCES. Lesson No. 2. BROWN SAUCE. Average cost of “ Brown Sauce ” (about one pint). INGREDIENTS. 1 pint of brown stock 1 and \ oz. of flour Salt and pepper 2 oz. butter 4 mushrooms 1 o| Time required, about 15 minutes. Now we will show you how to make Brown Sauce. 1. We put two ounces of butter into a stewpan, and put it on the fire to melt. 2. We take four mushrooms (if large, or six small), wash them well in cold water, cut off the end of the stalks, and peel them. 3. When the butter in the stewpan is melted, we stir in two ounces of flour, and mix them into a smooth paste with a wooden spoon. 4. We now add one pint of brown stock and the mush- rooms, and stir the sauce smoothly over the fire, until it boils and thickens. N.B.—The mushrooms might be omitted if liked, and the sauce flavoured according to the dish with which it is to be served. 5. We then move the stewpan to the side of the fire, and let it simmer gently for ten minutes. 6. We must watch it carefully, and skim off all the butter as it rises to the top of the sauce. 7. We season the sauce with pepper and salt according to taste. N.B.—If the sauce is not brown enough in colour, a teaspoonful of caramel [burnt sugar) might be stirred into it. 8. We now strain the sauce through a tammy sieve into a basin, and it is then ready for use. Now it is finished. s. d. ..08 ) o o| . . 0 2 .. 0 2

Brussels sprouts Salt £ of a saltspoonful of carbonate of soda .... 1 ounce of butter d. 6 Pepper Time required, about half an hour. Now we will show you how to dress Brussels Sprouts, 1. We take the Brussels sprouts, wash them well in two or three waters, and trim them. 2. We take a saucepan with plenty of warm water in it. 3. We put the saucepan on the fire to boil. 4. When the water is quite boiling, we add a tablespoon- ful of salt, and a quarter of a saltspoonful of carbonate of soda. 5. We put in the sprouts, and let them boil quickly for from ten to twenty minutes, according to their age. N.B.—Young sprouts take the shortest time to boil. 6. We must keep the lid off the saucepan the whole time. 7. After that time, we pour the sprouts into a cullender to drain. 8. When the sprouts are quite dry, we put them in a saute-pan with one ounce of butter. 9. We sprinkle over them a littl<z pepper and salt, and toss them over the fire for a few minutes, but they must not fry. 10. For serving, we arrange them tastily on a hot vege- table dish.

Now it is finished 282 National Training School for Cookery. 9. When the water in the saucepan boils we stand in the mould. (The water should only reach half way up the mould, or it will boil over and spoil the puddingt) 10. We let it simmer gently until the pudding is quite firm. (It will take about one fwtir and a quarterl) N.B.â€”It must on no account boil fast. 11. After that time we take the pudding out of the sauce- pan and stand it in ice. 12. For serving, we take off the buttered paper and turn the pudding carefully out on to a dish, and ornament it with red currant jelly according to taste.

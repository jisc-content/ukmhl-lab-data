Average cost of “ Stewed Tapioca and ApplesV INGREDIENTS. d. 2 tablespoonsful of Tapioca o| 6 apples 2 4 cloves and the peel of half a lemon i 2 tablespoonsful of sugar oj 4 Time required {after the tapioca has soaked twelve hours), about three- quarters of an hour. Now we will show you how to make a stew of Tapioca and Apples. 1. We put two tablespoonsful of tapioca into a basin with one pint of water, and let it soak for twelve hours. N.B.—This should be done over-night. 2. We take six apples, peel, quarter, and core them. 3. We put in four cloves (for flavouring). 4. We take one lemon, wipe it clean with a cloth, and peel half of it very thinly with a sharp knife. N.B.—We must be careful not to cut any of the white, as it is very bitter. 5. We put the soaked tapioca into a large saucepan, with the lemon peel, and two tablespoonsful of pounded white sugar. 6. We put the saucepan on the fire and stir it well until it boils. N.B.—We should be careful not to let any stick to the bottom. 7. We let it boil for ten minutes, until the tapioca has become clear. 8. After that time we put the apples into the saucepan, arranging them at the bottom, so that they are covered with the tapioca.

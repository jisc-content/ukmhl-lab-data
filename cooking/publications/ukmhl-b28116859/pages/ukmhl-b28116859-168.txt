Now we will show you how to make two quarts of Spring Vegetable Soup. 1. We take two pounds of shin of beef , and two pounds of knuckle of veal\ and put them on a board. 2. We must cut off all the meat from the bone with a sharp knife. 3. We cut off all the fat from the meat (the fat we put aside for other purposes). 4. We take a chopper and break the bones in halves. 6. We take out all the marrow inside the bones, and put it aside for other uses. N.B.—If the fat and marrow were to go into the soup they would make it greasy. 6. We take a stockpot or a large stewpan, and put the meat and boties into it. 7. We pour in five pints of cold water. 8. We put in a teaspootifid of salt. This will assist the scum to rise.

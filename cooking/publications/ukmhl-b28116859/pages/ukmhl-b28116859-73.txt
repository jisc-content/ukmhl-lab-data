Cooking Meat.—(Entries.) Quenelles of Veal. 67 Now it is finished. 27. We then take a spoon, and skim off all the butter from the top of the sauce. 28. We now stir into the sauce one gill of cream, and stand the stewpan aside to keep warm, until required for use. 29. We take the peeled mushrooms and put them in a stewpan with a piece of butter the size of a nut. 30. We squeeze over them a teaspoonful of lemon juice and pour in one tablespoonful of cold water. 31. We put the stewpan on the fire and just bring them to the boil. 32. We now pour boiling water carefully into the saute- pan, enough to cover the quenelles. N.B.—We must be careful to pour the water very gently into the saute-pan or the quenelles will be spoiled. 33. We put the saute-pan on the fire to poach the quenelles for ten minutes. N.B.—We muBt watch them and occasionally turn them carefully with a spoon. 34. When the quenelles are done, we lift them carefully out of the water, and lay them on a cloth to drain off the water. 35. For serving we must arrange them tastily in a circle on a hot dish. 36. We fill in the centre of the dish with the boiled mush- rooms. N.B.—Peas (see “Vegetables,” Lesson No. 9) or spinach (see “Vegetables,” Lesson No. 8) may be served with them instead, according to taste. 37. We take the stewpan off the fire, and pour the sauce through a strainer over the quenelles.

Lessons on Australian Meat.—Rissoles. 55 8. We put the meat on a board and chop it up as finely as possible. N.B.—Minced meat might be used, which would not of course require chopping up. 9. We take a small bunch of dried herbs and rub the leaves into a powder. N.B.—The stalks of the herbs need not be thrown away, as they can be used in soups for flavouring. 10. We sprinkle the herbs over the meat, also a little pepper and salt, and a little flour. 11. We take a rolling pin and roll out the paste as thin as possible. 12. We cut the paste into rounds with a cutter (which should be dipped in flour); the rounds should be rather larger than the top of a tea-cup. 13. We put some meat into the centre of each round of paste. 14. We break an egg on to a plate and beat it up slightly with a knife. 15. We take a paste-brush, dip it in the egg, and just wet the edges of the paste with the egg. 16. We fold the paste carefully over the meat, pressing the edges together with our thumbs. 17. We take two ounces of vermicelli and rub it between our hands, crushing it up as finely as possible. 18. We put this crushed vermicelli on to a piece of paper. 19. We put the rissoles into the plate of egg, and egg them well all over with the brush. 20. We then turn them into the crushed vermicelli, and cover them well with it but not too thickly. N.B.—We must be careful to finger them as little as possible, so as not to rub off any of the egg or vermicelli, or the rissoles will burst while frying. N.B.—Bread crumbs might be used instead of vermicelli. 21. We take a frying basket and put in the rissoles; we must be careful that they do not touch each other. 22. When the fat in the saucepan is quite hot and

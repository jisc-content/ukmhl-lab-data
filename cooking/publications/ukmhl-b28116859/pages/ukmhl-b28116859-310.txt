304 National Training School for Cookery. Now it is finished. 9. We take a quarter of a pound of damsons (or any other fruit), and wipe them with a cloth to be sure that they are quite clean. 10. We sprinkle the fruit into the batte.t, and put two or three bits of butter on the top to prevent its being dry. 11. We put the pie-dish into the oven (the heat should be 220°) to bake for half an hour. 12. After that time we take the pie-dish out of the oven and sprinkle some sugar over the top. N.B.—Sugar should, of course, be eaten with the batter pudding. N.B.—If sugar was added to the batter before it was baked it would make it heavy.

14 National Training School for Cookery. 5. We should pull out the drawer just below the oven, in which we shall find the soot has fallen. 6. We empty all the soot away and sweep out the drawer clean. 7. We now take the sweep’s brush and sweep down the range. 8. We black-lead, polish the range, and clean the hearth and fender as described for an open range (from note 3 to end). 9. We take down the iron plate-rack across the top of the range, and rub the bars with emery cloth. 10. We should dust the fire-irons, and if they are rusty, they should be rubbed with emery cloth or oil and leather. Now it is finished. TO CLEAN A GAS STOVE. 1. We require the same materials as for a kitchen range. 2. We lift out the bars at the top, and rub them with emery cloth until they are quite clean and bright. 3. We wash the top of the stove with a flannel dipped in hot water and soda, so as to remove all grease and dirt ; we then wring out the flannel, and partially dry the top of the stove. 4. We now black-lead and polish it in the same way as for the kitchen range. N.B.—We must be careful not to stop up the gas holes with black lead. 5. We place the bars back over the stove. 6. We polish the brass handles of the gas burners with bath brickdust and a leather. 7. We wash the tiles round the stove with the flannel, hot water, and soda. 8. We dry them with a cloth. Now it is finished.

182 National Training School for Cookery. Now it is finished. 7. We take four onions, peel them, and stick tzvo cloves fnto the onions. N.B.—The outer skins of the onions can be put into a saucepan by the side of the fire to brown; when browned, they are useful for colouring gravies and soups. 8. We should skim the soup well and then put in the vegetables ; we also add a blade of mace and a teaspoonful of peppercorns. 9. We must move the saucepan to the side of the fire, and let it simmer gently for two hours and a half. 10. We should raise the lid slightly to let out the steam. N.B.—The soup can be thickened with macaroni, vermicelli, barley or rice. 11. If the soup is thickened with macaroniy we take a quarter of a pound of macaroni and wash it well in two or three waters. 12. We put the macaroni into a saucepan with plenty of cold water, and sprinkle a little salt over it. 13. We put the saucepan on the fire, and let it boil until the macaroni is quite tender ; it will take about half an hour. 14. We should feel the macaroni with our fingers to see that it is quite soft and tender. 15. When it is sufficiently boiled, we strain the water off and pour some cold water on it, and wash the macaroni again. 16. We put the macaroni on a board, and cut it into small pieces about a quarter of an inch in length, it is then ready to be put into the soup. N.B.—If barley is used instead of macaroni, it will take a much longer time to boil, but if vermicelli is used, it lakes a very short time to boil. 17. When the soup is ready for use, we should put the macaroni into a soup tureen and strain the hot soup over it. N.B.—It is better to boil macaroni separately as the first water is not clean.

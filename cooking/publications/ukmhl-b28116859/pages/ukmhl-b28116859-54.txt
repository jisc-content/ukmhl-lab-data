Now we will show you how to make a Curry of Austra- lian Rabbit. 1. We take a two pound tin of rabbit and open it carefully. N.B.—Any other meat could be used for the curry instead of the rabbit. 2. We take a spoon and carefully remove all thefat from the top of the meat. N.B.—The fat should be clarified by putting it into a basin of boiling water; and when cold can be used as dripping. 3. We put two ounces of butter or clarified dripping into a stewpan. N.B.—If the fat from the rabbit has been clarified in time, it can be used instead of the butter or dripping. 4. We put the stewpan on the fire to heat the fat. 5. We take two moderate sized onions, peel them, and cut them in slices. 6. When the fat is quite hot, we put in the onions to fry brown. N.B.—We must watch it, and stir the onions occasionally, and not let them burn or stick to the bottom of the pan. 7. We turn the rabbit out of the tin on to a plate. 8. We take a good sized apple, peel it, take out the core, and chop it up as finely as possible.

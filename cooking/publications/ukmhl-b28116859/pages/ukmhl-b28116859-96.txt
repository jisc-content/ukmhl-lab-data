Now we will show you how to make a Curry of rabbit or veal. 1. We put a quarter of a pound of butter into a stewpan and put it on the fire to melt. 2. We take two onions, peel them, put them on a board, and chop them up as finely as possible. 3. We put the chopped onions into the melted butter, and let them fry a light brown. N.B.—We must be careful that they do not burn. 4. We take a rabbit (which has been skinned and pro- perly prepared for cooking), wash it well, and dry it in a cloth. 5. We put the rabbit on a board and cut it up in pieces of equal size. 6. If veal is used we should put it on a board and cut it into equal sized pieces. N.B.—If preferred chicken can be used instead of rabbit or veal. 7. When the onions are fried we strain them from the butler.

Now we will show you how to cook Cod Fish, and make Oyster Sauce. 1. We take a slice of cod weighing one pound. 2. We put it in a basin of cold water and wash it well. 3. We take a small fish-kettle of boiling water, and add to it as much salt as will make the water taste salt. 4. We put the fish-kettle on the fire. 5. We take the cod out of the basin and place it on the drainer in the fish-kettle, and let it boil for fifteen minutes. N.B.—It must not boil fast. 6. When the slice of cod is sufficiently cooked the flesh will leave the bone. N.B.—The bone is usually left in or the fish would break to pieces. 7. We serve the slice of cod on a folded napkin on a hot dish with oyster sauce.

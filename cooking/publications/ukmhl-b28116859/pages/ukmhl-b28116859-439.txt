Advertisements.—National Training School for Cookery. 433 W« JONES, DRAY, & CO.’S IMPROVED KITCHEI RAI&ES. OPEN FIRE CLOSED FJR£ ECONOMY OF FUEL. This special advantage will at once be secured by the use of JONES, DRAY, and CO.’S IMPROVED KITCHEN RANGES, as they can be used either with •a close or open fire, convertible at a minute’s notice while alight. They are moderate in price, durable and cheerful looking, and a cure for smoky Chimneys ; they roast before the fire with a bottle jack, and roast or bake (as required) in a large WELD VENTILATED ROASTER. Vessels may be kept boiling on the whole of the Top Plate, which is also an excellent IRONING STOVE. By a recent improvement the smell and steam of the cooking food is not distributed ovet the house, but into its proper receptacle—the chimney.

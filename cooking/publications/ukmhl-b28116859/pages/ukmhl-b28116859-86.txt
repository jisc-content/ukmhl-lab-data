We take the peeled mushrooms and put them in a stewpan with a piece of butter the size of a nut. 13. We squeeze over them a teaspoonful of lemon juice, and pour in a tablespoonful of cold water. 14. We put the stewpan on the fire and just bring them to the boil. 15. We then take the stewpan off the fire and turn them on to a plate. 16. We put half an ounce of butter into a stewpan. 17. We put the stewpan on the fire. When the butter is melted we put in one ounce of flour, stirring it well with a wooden spoon. 18. We now add the chicken stock, and the mushroom peelings, and stir the sauce well until it boils. 19. We let it boil for ten minutes to cook the four. 20. After that time we add one gill of cream, and salt to taste. 21. We put the pieces of chicken and the button mush- rooms into another stewpan. 22. We strain the sauce over the chicken, and then stand the stewpan, in a saucepan of hot water, over the fire until the chicken is quite hot. 23. For serving, we arrange the fricassee of chicken on a hot dish, with some fried bread (as described in “Vegetables,” Lesson No. 8, Note 13 to Note 17), put round the edge.

We take one ounce of prepared crushed tapioca. 4. When the white stock boils, we stir in gradually the tapioca. 5. We move the saucepan to the side of the fire, and let it all simmer until the tapioca is quite clear. 6. Now we must prepare the liaison. 7. We put the yolks of two eggs in a basin, and add to them two tablespoonsful of cream or good milk. 8. We just stir it with a wooden spoon, and then pour the mixture through a strainer into another basin. 9. We now take the stewpan with the white stock, off the fire, and stand it on a piece of paper or wooden trivet on the table. 10. When the stock is cooled a little we add by degrees two or three tablespoonsful of it to the liaison, stirring well all the time. N.R.—We must be careful that the eggs do not curdle.

Salt and pepper, and cayenne pepper 1 gill of milk 3 eggs 3 oz. of Parmesan cheese d. °2 OA of % Io| Time required, about forty minutes. Now we will show you how to make a Cheese Souffle. 1. We take a stewpan, and put into it one ounce of butter. 2. We add one teaspoonful of mignonette pepper. 3. We put the stewpan on the fire, and let the pepper fry in the butter (to extract the flavour of the pepper) for two or three minutes. 4. We take the stewpan off the fire, and strain the butter into a basin ; as the pepper is only for flavouring, the grains must not be left in the butter. 5. We wash out the stewpan to prevent any of the grains remaining. 6. We pour the flavoured butter back in the stewpan. 7. We add one ounce of flour, a teaspoonful of salt, and half a teaspoonful of pepper, and cayenne pepper (about as much as would thinly cover half the top of a threepenny piece) according to taste; and stir well together with a wooden spoon. 8. We add one gill {or quarter of a pint) of milk. 9. We put the stewpan on the fire, and stir the mixture smooth until it thickens.

Horniman have supplied the public with Tea through authorized agents ; this system has proved so great a success that upwards of five millions of Packets are annually sold by 3,538 Agents. This celebrated Tea is to be obtained in Packets only, bearing the Importers’ signature, and the price printed on each. The consumer can thus ensure having the same article at all seasons of the year, as Messrs. Horniman’s standard quality of excellence is known to be “ always good alikeT The principal reasons why Horniman’s Pure Tea is preferred are,—great strength, delicious flavour, selection only of the early Spring crop, and entire disuse of all mineral facing-powder used by the Chinese on the teas ordinarily sold. HORNIMAN’S PACKET TEA CAN BE HAD OF CHEMISTS IN THE COUNTRY, AND CONFECTIONERS IN LONDON.

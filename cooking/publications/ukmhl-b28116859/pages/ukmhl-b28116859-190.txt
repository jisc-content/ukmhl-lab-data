184 National Training School for Cookery. Now it is finished. 10. We take four young carrots, scrape them clean with a knife, and cut them in pieces. 11. We take one turnip and one onion, peel them and cut them in quarters. 12. We take a leek and half a head of celery and wash them well in cold water. 13. We take a spoon and remove the scum from the stock as it rises. 14. Now we put in all the vegetables, and let it simmer gently for five hours. 15. We must watch and skim it occasionally, and we should add a little cold water to make the scum rise. 16. We take a clean cloth and put it over a good-sized basin. 17. We put a hair-sieve on the top of the cloth over the basin. 18. When the stock has been simmering for five hours we take the stockpot off the fire. 19. We pour the contents into the sieve, which contains the meat, bone, and vegetables ; and the cloth very effectually strains the stock. N.B.—The meat and bone can be used again for second stock, with the addition of fresh vegetables and water. 20. We take the basin (into which the stock has been strained), and put it in a cool place till the next day, when it will be a stiff jelly. 21. When this stock jelly is required for use, we must take off the fat from the top with a spoon. 22. We take a clean cloth and dip it in hot water, and wipe over the top of the jelly so as to remove every particle of fat. 23. Now we must take a clean dry cloth and wipe the top of the jelly dry. N.B.—For some soups, vegetable soups, or purdes, white stock is required. White stock is made in the same way, only with veal instead of beef, and it can also be made of veal and beef mixed, or rabbit and beef, but veal alone is considered best.

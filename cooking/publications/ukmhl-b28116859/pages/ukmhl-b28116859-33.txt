Lessons on Re-Cooking Meat.—-Hashed Meat. 27 9. We put the saucepan on the fire and when it boils we should add pepper and salt, according to taste. 10. We now put the lid on and move the saucepan to the side of the fire to stew gently for one hour, or one hour and a half; we should watch it and skim it occasionally. 11. We take a small onion, peel it, and cut it in slices. 12. We put half an ounce of butter into a frying pan. 13. We put the pan on the fire, and when the butter is melted we add the sliced onion, and let it fry a nice brown. 14. We must shake the pan occasionally to prevent the slices of onion from sticking to the bottom of the pan and burning. 15. When the onion is sufficiently browned, we strain off the butter and put the onion on to a plate. 16. When the bones have stewed long enough, we should strain off the liquor into a basin. 17. We wash out the saucepan and pour back the liquor. 18. We put a tablespoonfid of flour into a small basin. 19. We add a tablespoonful of the liquor to the flour and stir it into a smooth paste. 20. We stir this paste gradually into the liquor in the saucepan. 21. We also add the browned onion and a dessertspoonful of mushroom ketchup. 22. We put the saucepan on the fire and stir the sauce until it boils and thickens. 23. We let it boil for two or three minutes, until the flour is cooked. N.B.—We should be careful to stir the sauce smoothly while it boils, or it will be lumpy. 24. We then move the saucepan to the side of the fire, and when it is off the boil we lay in the pieces of meat to warm through. N.B.—We must not let the sauce boil while the meat is in it, or the meat will get hard and tough. 25. We cut a thin slice of bread, and cut it into square pieces.

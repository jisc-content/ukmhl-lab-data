When the panada on the plate is cold, we put half of it and one egg in the mortar and pound it to a cream. 11. We then add half the meat, and salt and pepper to taste, and pound all well together with the pestle. 12. We put into the mortar the remainder of the panada, and break in another egg and add the rest of the meat. 13. We pound these well together again with the pestle. 14. We turn the mixture from the mortar into a basin. 16. We take a saute-pan and butter it inside. 16. We take a dessertspoon and fill it with the mixture, shaping it to the form of an oval with a knife, which we must dip occasionally into hot water to prevent the mixture from sticking. We take another dessertspoon and dip it into boiling water. 18. We scoop the quenelle from the first spoon into the second spoon, and put it into the saute-pan, and continue doing this till we have used up all the mixture. 19. We must now make the sauce to be served with the quenelles. 20. We take a stewpan, and put in half an ounce of butter and three qicarters of an ounce of flour. 21. We put the stewpan on the fire, and mix them together with a wooden spoon. 22. We take one dozen of button mushrooms, cut ofif the end of the stalks and wash them well in cold water. 23. We take them out of the water, put them upon a board, and peel them carefully with a sharp knife. 24. We pour in half a pint of second white stock to the mixture in the stewpan, and add the mushroom peelings for flavouring. 25. We must stir well until it boils and thickens. 26. We stand the stewpan by the side of the fire with the lid half on, and let it boil for a quarter of an hour.

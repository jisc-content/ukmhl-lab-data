When the brains have boiled for ten minutes we take them out of the saucepan, take them out of the muslin, and chop them up in small pieces with a knife. 26. We add the brains to the sauce. 27. When the sheep's head is sufficiently cooked we take it out of the saucepan, cut away the string, and place it on a warm dish. 28. We take the tongue, skin it carefully, and place it on the same dish. 29. We take out the turnips, put them in a basin, and mash them with a fork. 30. We take out the carrot and arrange it alternately with the mashed turnips round the sheep's head. 31. We take the brain sauce and pour it over the sheep's head. 32. We should pour the broth carefully into a basin, without the bread or vegetables. N.B.—Bread or vegetables should never be kept in broth, as they would turn it sour. 33. We put the basin of broth away until required for use. N.B.—All the fat should be removed from the broth before it is used. N.B.—When the broth is required for use, a few toasted crusts of bread might be added, and a little chopped parsley. N.B.—The fat from the broth should be melted down into dripping. N.B.—If the sheep’s head be preferred browned. 1. We proceed as above (see from Note 1 to Note 17). 2. We then move the saucepan to the side of the fire, and let it simmer gently for one hour.

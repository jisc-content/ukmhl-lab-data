LESSONS ON CLEANING STOVES, GRATES, AND KITCHEN UTENSILS. TO CLEAN AN OPEN KITCHEN RANGE. 1. We should rake out all the cinders and sift them into a scuttle for use. N.B.—All the dust should be thrown away. 2. We take a sweep’s brush and sweep down all the scot from the flues and oven. 3. We mix some pounded black lead in a gallipot with enough water to make it into a smooth thick liquid. 4. We dip the black lead brush in the mixture, and black-lead the whole of the range, beginning from the top of the stove, by the dampers, and then downwards. 5. When the black lead is dry we brush it all over with a dry brush. 6. We then take another brush and polish the range all over, so as to make it quite bright. N.B.—The bars of the stove should be done in the same way. 7. We take the sweep’s brush and sweep the remaining soot and dust from the stove and the hearth. 8. We polish the steel handles and bolts of the oven by rubbing them with emery paper. 9. The brass handles and bolts we should polish with bath brickdust and a leather. 10. We get a flannel and a pail of hot water, put in it some soda, and wash the hearth all over. N.B.—We must not wet it too much. 11. We take a hearthstone and rub it all over the hearth.

Lessons on Cooking Vegetables.-Potato Croquettes. 225 water, dry them in a cloth, and chop them up finely on a board (there should be about a teaspoonful). 9. We sprinkle the parsley into the stewpan, and season the potato according to taste with pepper and salt. 10. We turn the potato mixture on to a plate and stand it aside till cold. 11. We put 1 lb. of clarified dripping into a deep stewpan, and put it on the fire to heat; we must be careful it does not burn. 12. We take some crumb of bread, and rub it through a wire sieve on to a piece of paper. 13. When the potato mixture is cold, we form it into croquettes or balls} according to taste. 14. We break an egg on to a plate and beat it up slightly with a knife. 15. We dip the croquettes into the egg, and egg them well all over with a paste brush. 16. We now roll them in the bread crumbs, covering them well all over. N.B.â€”We must be careful to cover them smoothly and not too thickly. 17. We take a frying basket and arrange the croquettes in it; but we must finger them as little as possible, and not allow them to touch each other. 18. When the fat on the fire is quite hot and smoking (we should test the heat by throwing in a piece of bread which should fry brown directly), we put in the frying basket for two minutes or so to fry the croqiLettes a pale yellow. 19. We put a piece of whitey-brown paper on a plate, and as the croquettes are fried we turn them on to the paper to drain off the grease. 20. We put three or four small sprigs of parsley (washed and dried) into the frying basket, and just toss the basket into the boiling fat for a second or so. 21. For serving, we arrange the croquettes tastily on a hot dish, with the fried parsley in the centre. Now it is finished. p

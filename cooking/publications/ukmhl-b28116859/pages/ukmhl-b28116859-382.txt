Milk, .... d. 3 2 x 6 Time required, about half an hour. Now we will show you how to make Milk Rolls. 1. We put one pound of self-raising flour into a basin and rub two ounces of butter into it with our hands. 2. We add sufficient milk to make it into a lithe firm dough. 3. We sprinkle flour over a board, and turn the dough out on it. 4. We take a knife, dip it in flour, and cut the dough into twelve pieces. N.B.—We should keep our hands floured to prevent the dough from sticking to them. 5. We form each piece into a small roll. 6. We flour a baking tin. 7. We put these rolls on to the tin and put the tin in the oven (the heat should rise to 240°) to bake for twenty minutes. 8. The milk rolls will then be ready for use. Now it is finished. 1

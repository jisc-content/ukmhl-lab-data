Cooking Meat.—(Entries.) Mutton Cutlets. 71 Now it is finished. 11. We take one egg and beat it on a plate with a knife. 12. We season the cutlets on both sides with pepper and salt. 13. We lay them in the egg, and egg them well all over with a brush. 14. We then put them in the bread crumbs and cover them well. N.B.—We should be careful to finger them as little as possible, and lift them by the bare bone. 15. We take a saute-pan, and pour in it one ounce of melted clarified butter or lard or clarified dripping (see Lesson “ Frying”). 16. We now lay in the cutlets with the bones to the centre of the saute-pan. 17. We pour over them two more ounces of melted clarified butter or fat. 18. We must now put the saute-pan on a very quick fire for about seven minutes. 19. We must watch and turn the cutlets when they have become a light brown, so as to fry them the same colour on both sides. 20. We place a piece of whitey-brown paper on a plate. 21. When the cutlets are done we take them carefully out with a fork, and lay them on the paper on the plate to drain off the grease. N.B.—We should be careful not to stick the fork into the meat (or the gravy will run out), but into the fat. 22. For serving, we arrange them nicely in a dish, in a circle, one leaning over the other ; the centre may be filled with any vegetable according to taste.

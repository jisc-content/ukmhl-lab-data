We put one pound and a half of salt, six ounces of brown sugar, one ounce of saltpetre, and one gallon of water into a large saucepan. 2. We put the saucepan on the fire to bring it to the boil, and then let it boil for five minutes. We must keep it well skimmed. 3. We then strain it into a tub or large basin. 4. When the pickle is quite cold, meat can be put into it. N.B.—The meat should be kept well covered with the pickle 9 days. N.B.—This pickle will keep for 3 weeks in summer and 3 months in winter. N.B.—When the pickle is required again after it has once been used, it should be boiled up again, skimmed, strained, and allowed to get cold before the fresh meat is put into it. N.B.—If used for pig’s head the pickle should be thrown away and not used again.

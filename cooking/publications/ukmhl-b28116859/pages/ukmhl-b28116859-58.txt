Now we will show you how to make Fricassee of Mutton. 1. We put two ounces of butter into a saucepan and put it on the fire. 2. When the butter is melted, we stir in one and a half ounce of flour, and a little pepper and salt according to taste. 3. We now pour in three quarters of a pint of cold milk, and stir smoothly with a wooden spoon, until it boils and thickens. 4. We take one dozen of mushrooms, peel them, and cut off the end of the stalks. 5. We add these mushrooms tc the sauce and let them stew gently, until they are quite tender. 6. We take the peel and stalks of the mushrooms, wash them in cold water and put them in a small saucepan, with about a gill of milk. 7. We put the saucepan on the fire and let it stew gently, to extract the flavour of the mushrooms. 8. We take a two pound tin of mutton, open it carefully, and remove all the fat from the top of the meat with a spoon. N.B.—The fat should be clarified by putting it into boiling water, and when cold can then be used as dripping.

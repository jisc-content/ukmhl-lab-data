Now we will show you how we make Pancakes. 1. We take three ounces of flour, and put it in a basin. 2. We add half a saltspoonfnl of salt, and mix it well into the floitr. 3. We break two eggs into the flour, and add a dessert- spoonful of milk, and mix all well together with a wooden spoon. 4. We stir in gradually half a pint of milk, making the mixture very smooth. N.B.—If possible it is better to let this mixture stand before frying it into pancakes. 6. We put a fryingpan on the fire, and put into it a piece of lard the size of a nut, and let it get quite hot, but it must not burn. 6. We then pour into the fryingpan two large table- spoonsful of the batter, and let it run thinly all over the pan. 7. When the pancake has become a light brown on one side, we should shake the pan, and toss the pancake over, to brown the other side the same.

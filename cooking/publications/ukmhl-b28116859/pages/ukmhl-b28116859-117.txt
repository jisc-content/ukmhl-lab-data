Now we will show you how to stuff a Bullock's Heart and roast it. 1. We must first prepare the fire for roasting, as described in “ Roasting,” Lesson No. I. 2. We take a bullock's hearty and wash it thoroughly in salt and water. 3. We must be careful to cleanse all the cavities of the heart, and to remove all the blood. 4. We take it out of the salt and water, and put it into a basin of clean water and wash it again, until it is quite clean. 5. We now wipe it thoroughly dry with a cloth. 6. If the heart is not quite dry, it will not roast properly. 7. We put the heart on a board, and with a sharp knife cut off the flaps, or deaf ears (as they are called). N.B.—These we should put aside for gravy.

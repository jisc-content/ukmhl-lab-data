Lessons on Cooking Vegetables.—Boiled Potatoes. 217 Now it is finished. VEGETABLES. Lesson No. x. BOILED AND STEAMED POTATOES. Time requiredfor boiling:— Old potatoes, about half an hour. New potatoes, about twenty mimites. Steamed potatoes, half an hour. Now we will show you how to dress Potatoes. For boiling Old Potatoes. 1. We wash two pounds of potatoes well in cold water, and scrub them clean with a scrubbing brush. N.B.—If the potatoes are diseased then we take a sharp knife, peel them, and carefully cut out the eyes and any black specks about the potato, but it is much better to boil them in their skins. 2. We put them in a saucepan with cold water, enough to cover them, and sprinkle over them a teaspoonful of salt. 3. We put the saucepan on the fire, to boil the potatoes for from twenty minutes to half an hour. 4. We should take a fork and put it into the potatoes, to feel if the centre is quite tender. 5. When they are sufficiently boiled, we drain off all the water, and place a clean cloth over the potatoes in the saucepan. 6. We stand the saucepan by the side of the fire, with the lid on, to steam the. potatoes. 7. When the potatoes have become quite dry, we take them carefully cut of the saucepan, peel them without breaking them, and place them in a hot vegetable dish for serving.

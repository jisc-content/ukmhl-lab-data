We take any scraps of cold meat (the smallest scraps would do that would not do for anything else), put them on a board, and chop them up as finely as possible (there should be about two tablespoonsful of chopped meat). 2. We take about two ounces of suet, put it on a board, cut away the skin, and chop it up very finely (there should be about two tablespoonsful). 3. We take two small apples, peel them, cut out the core, and chop them up finely (there should be about two table- spoonsful). 4.

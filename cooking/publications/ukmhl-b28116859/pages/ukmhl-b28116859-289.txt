Now we will show you how to make a Blanc-mange. 1. We put one quart of milk into a saucepan with three ounces of loaf sugar, and one inch of the stick of cinnamon or the peel of a quarter of a lemon for flavouring. 2. We put the saucepan on the fire to boil. 3. We put four tablespoonsful of cornflour into a basin and mix it smoothly with a tablespoonful of cold milk. 4. When the milk in the saucepan is quite boiling, we stir in the cornflour quickly and let it boil for two minutes, stirring continually. N.B.—We must be very careful not to let it get lumpy. 5. We take a quart basin or a mould and rinse it out in cold water. 6. We now take the piece of cinnamon or lemon peel out of the cornflour, and pour the cornflour into the basin, and stand it aside to cool. 7. When the blanc-mange is quite cold, we turn it out of the basin on to a dish, and it is ready for serving.

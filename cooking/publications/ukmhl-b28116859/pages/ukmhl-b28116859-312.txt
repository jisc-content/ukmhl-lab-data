We stand the jug in the saucepan, and stir the custard very smoothly until it thickens and becomes the substance of creamy but it must not boil or it will curdle. 7. We put half an ounce of gelatine in a small stewpan or gallipot, with a tablespoonfid of water, and stand it near the fire to melt. 8. When the custard is sufficiently thick, we take the jug out of the saucepan and stand it aside to cool. N.B.—We should place a piece of paper over the mouth of the jug to pre- vent the dust getting in. 9. We stir the gelatine until it is quite melted. 10. We pour the melted gelatine through a strainer into the custard. 11. We also add half a gill (one gill is a quarter of a pint) of cream, a teaspoonfid of essence of vanilla, and a table- spoonfid of castor sugar. 12. We pour it all on the cakes in the mould. 13. We stand the mould in a cold place to set; in summer time it should be placed on ice. 14. When the pudding is quite cold and set, we turn it out carefully on to a dish, and it is ready for serving.

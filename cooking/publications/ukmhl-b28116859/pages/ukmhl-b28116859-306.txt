Now we will show you how to make an Invalid Pudding. 1. We take about a quarter of a pound of mutton suet, put it upon a board, and chop it up as finely as possible. 2. When it is chopped there should be about three table- spoonsful. N.B.—Mutton suet is much lighter of digestion than beef suet. 3. We put a saucepan half full of warm water on the fire to boil. 4. We take a piece of bread and a grater, and grate some bread crumbs on to a piece of paper. There should be about three tablespoonsful of bread crumbs. 5. We put the bread crumbs and the chopped suet into a basin with three tablespoonsful of flour and three table- spoonsful of moist sugar. 6. We mix all these well together. 7. We now break in two eggs, and add three tablespoonsfid of milk, and stir all well together with a spoon. 8. We take a half-pint pudding basin and grease it well inside.

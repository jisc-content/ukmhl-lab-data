Lessons on Making Pastry.—Short Crust. 247 Now it is finished. 13. We take a rolling pin and flour it, and roll out the paste to the size and thickness required. 14. If the paste is for a fruit tart we roll it out to the shape of the pie dish, only a little larger, and to the thick- ness of about a quarter of an inch. 15. We arrange the fruit in the pie dish, heaped up in the centre. 16. We sprinkle a tablespoonful of moist sugar over the fruit, or more or less according to the fruit used. 17. We take a paste brush and wet the edge of the dish with water, or a little white of egg. 18. We cut a strip of the paste the width of the edge of the pie dish and place it round the edge of the dish. 19. We take the paste brush again, and wet the edge of the paste with water or white of egg. 20. We take the remaining paste and lay it over the pie dish, pressing it down with our thumb all round the edge. 21. We must be very careful not to break the paste. 22. We take a knife and trim off all the rough edges of the paste round the edge of the dish. 23. We take a knife and with the back of the blade we make little notches in the edge of the pastey thus, pressing the paste firmly with our thumb to keep it in its proper place. 24. We take a skewer and make a little hole through the paste on either side of the tart, to let out the steam. 25. We take the paste brush, and wet the tart all over with water. 26. We sprinkle some castor sugar over the tart. This is to glaze it. 27. We now put the tart into a hot oven (the heat of the oven should rise to 240° Fahrenheit) for half an hour, or three quarters of an hour, according to the size of the tart. We must watch it occasionally and turn it, to prevent its burning. It should become a pale brown.

Cooking Poultry.—Trussing Roast Fowl. 151 Now it is finished. 36. When the fowl is quite done, we take it off the jack, and put it on a hot dish. 37. We take a knife and cut the twine, and draw it all out of the fowl and take off the paper before serving. For making Bread Sauce. 1. We take a French penny roll, and cut it in half. 2. We pull out all the inside crumb, and put it on a plate. 3. We pull this crumb apart into small pieces. N.B.—If a French roll cannot be procured, bread crumbs can be used instead, about i| ounce. 4. We take a small onion, and peel it with an onion knife. 5. We take a small stewpan and put in it the peeled onion. 6. We pour in half a pint of milk. 7. We now put in the crumb of the roll. 8. We add five peppercorns, and salt to taste. 9. We stand the stewpan aside with the lid on, for a quarter of an hour, to soak the crumb. 10. After that time we put the stewpan on the fire, and stir the sauce smoothly with a wooden spoon, until it boils. 11. We now add a tablespoonful of cream, and stir the sauce until it just boils again. 12. Before serving the sauce, we must take out the onion, and pour the sauce into a sauce tureen. N.B.—The neck, gizzard, liver, and claws of the fowl, when properly pre- pared (see Note at the end of “Trussing a Fowl for Boiling”), can be used for soup, or gravy, to be served with the Roast Fowl. For making the gravy, we put the giblets into a saucepan with enough water to cover them (about § a pint), we also add half an onion (peeled), 6 peppercorns, and salt to taste. We put the saucepan on the fire, and when it comes to the boil, we move it to the side to simmer while the fowl is roasting. For serving, we strain the gravy into a basin and colour it, if necessary, by stirring in a quarter of a teaspoonful of “Liebigs Extract,” or ten or twelve drops of caramel (see Noteat the end of “ Australian Meat, ” Lesson No. 2, “Brown Puree”), we then pour it in a sauce tureen, or round the fowl.

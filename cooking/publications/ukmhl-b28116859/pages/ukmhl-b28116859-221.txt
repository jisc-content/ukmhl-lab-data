Now we will show you how to Boil Fish and make the Sauce. 1. We put a saucepan or fish-kettle of water on the fire to boil. 2. We take the fish and clean it thoroughly in cold water. 3. When the water is quite boiling, we put in the fish on a strainer or a plate (there should be sufficient water just to cover the fish). 4. We also put in some salt, enough to make the water taste salt. 5. We put the lid on the saucepan, and move it to the side of the fire to simmer gently for from twenty minutes to three-quarters of an hoitr (according to the size of the fish). 6.

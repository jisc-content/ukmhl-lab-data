We take a red cabbage, cut it in half, and cut out the stalk. and wash it well in salt and cold water. N. B.—A white-heart cabbage will do to pickle, but green cabbages cannot be used, 2. We put it on a board, and cut it in thin slices. 3. We lay the slices in a large pan, sprinkle a handful of salt over each layer of slices, cover the top well with salt, and leave them for tzvo days. N.B.—We must turn the slices every morning and evening, and sprinkle a handful of salt over the layers each time we turn them. 4. We then drain the slices on a hair sieve for one day. 5. We put a gallon of vinegar, two blades of mace, twenty- four cloves, tzventy-four allspice berries, and twenty-four peppercorns into a saucepan, with three pieces of ginger an inch long. 6. We put the saucepan on the fire and let it boil up. 7. We then turn the vinegar and spices out of the sauce- pan into a broad pan to cool. N.B.—They must on no account be allowed to cool in the saucepan. 8. We put the cabbage into a stone jar, and pour the vinegar and spices over it. 9. The cabbage must be quite covered with vinegar, and as it soaks it up more vinegar must be poured over it N.B.—This quantity of vinegar is sufficient for a large cabbage; a smaller one will take less. 10. We tie the jar over with wash leather, brown paper, or a bladder.

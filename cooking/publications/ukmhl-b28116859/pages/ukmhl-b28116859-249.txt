Now we will show you how to make Puff Paste. 1. We take a quarter of a pound of flour and put it in a heap, on a clean board, and make a well in the centre of the flour. 2. We take half the yolk of an egg and put it in the well. 3. We add six drops of lemon juice. 4. We take a quarter of a pound of butter and lay it on a clean cloth. 5. We fold the cloth over the butter and squeeze it to get all the water out of the bittter. 6. We mix all these ingredients well together (with our hands), adding water to make the paste of the same con- sistency as the squeezed butter. 7. We take a rolling pin and flour it, and also sprinkle flour on the board to prevent the paste from sticking. 8. We roll out the paste rather thin, to about a quarter of an inch in thickness. 9. We place the pat of squeezed butter on one half of the paste and fold the other half over the butter, so as to cover it entirely, pressing the edges together with our thumb. Q 2

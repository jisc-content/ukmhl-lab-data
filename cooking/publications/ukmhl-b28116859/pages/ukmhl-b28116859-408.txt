We take half a pound of gravy beef put it on a board, and cut it up very finely, removing all the skin and fat. 2. We put the meat into a stone jar, with half a pint of water. N.B.— In making this beef tea the quantity of meat and water should be of equal weight, i.e., one pint to one pound. 3. We put the lid on the jar, and tie a piece of paper over it. 4. We stand the jar in a saucepan of boiling water on the hob for three hours, or in the oven for one hour and a half N.B.—If the jar is put into the saucepan of boiling water, we should be careful that the water does not cover the jar, or it would get inside. 50 After that time we take out the jar, and pour off the beef tea into a cup.

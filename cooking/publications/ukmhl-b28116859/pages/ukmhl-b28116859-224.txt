218 National Training School for Cookery. For boiling New Potatoes. 1. We wash two pounds of potatoes in cold water. 2. We take a knife and scrape them. 3. We take a saucepan of warm water, and put it on the fire to boil. 4. When the water is quite boiling, we put in the new potatoes, and sprinkle over them a teaspoonfnl of salt. 5. We let them boil for a quarter of an hour; we should take a fork and put it in the potatoes, to feel if the centre is quite tender. 6. We then drain off all the water, and place a clean cloth in the saucepan, over the potatoes, and stand the saucepan by the side of the fire with the lid on. 7. When they have become quite dry, we take them out of the saucepan, and arrange them on a hot vegetable dish for serving. Now it is finished. For Steamed Potatoes. N.B.—Old potatoes only, can be steamed. 1. We wash the potatoes well in cold water, and scrub them clean with a scrubbing brush. N.B.—It is best to steam the potatoes in their skins, but they can be peeled if preferred. 2. We take a potato steamer, fill the saucepan with hot water, and put it on the fire to boil. 3. When the water is quite boiling, we put the potatoes in the steamer, and sprinkle them over with salt. 4. We place the steamer on the saucepan of boiling water, and cover it down tight to keep the steam in. 5. We let the potatoes steam for half an hour. 6. We should take a fork and put it in the potatoes, to feel if the centre is quite tender.

Lessons on Making Puddings.—Plum. 271 6. We place a wire sieve over a piece of paper. 7. We take some crumb of bread and rub it through the sieve. (There should be a quarter of a pound of bread crumbs.) 8. We take a quarter of a pound of mixed peel, citronr lemon, and orange, and cut it up into small pieces. 9. We put a quarter of a pound of flour into a kitchen basin, and add to it the chopped suet, and half a teaspoonfid of salt. 10. We rub the suet well into the flour with our hands. N.B.—We should be careful not to leave any lumps. 11. We now add the bread crumbs, the currants and raisins, half a pound of moist sugar, and the pieces of candied peel, and mix all well together. 12. We take a lemon, wipe it clean in a cloth, and grate the rind of it into the basin. 13. We also grate half a nutmeg into the basin, and add two ounces of almonds (previously blanched and chopped up finely). 14. We break four eggs into a basin, and add to them one gill (quarter of a pint) of milk and a wineglassfid of brandy. 15. We stir this into the ingredients in the basin, mixing them all together. 16. We take a strong pudding-cloth, sprinkle about a teaspoonfld of flour over it, and lay it in a basin. 17. We turn the mixture from the basin into the centre of the floured cloth. 18. We tie up the pudding tightly in the cloth with a piece of string. N.B.—If preferred, the pudding might be put into a buttered mould and a cloth tied over the top. 19. When the water in the saucepan is quite boiling, we put in the pudding, and let it boil for five hours.

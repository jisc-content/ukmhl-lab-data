Lessons on Cooking Fish.—Fish Pudding. 191 10. When we think the potatoes are sufficiently done, we take a steel fork and try the potatoes, to see if they are tender all through. 11. When they are quite boiled, we drain off all the water from the saucepan, and sprinkle the potatoes with a little salt. 12. We put on the lid of the saucepan, and stand it by the side of the fire to steam the potatoes until they have become quite mealy and dry. 13. We should shake the saucepan every now and then, to prevent the potatoes from sticking to the bottom. 14. When the haddock is sufficiently boiled, we take it carefully out of the fishkettle. 15. We take a sharp knife, and cut off the head and tail of the fish. 16. We skin the fish from the head to the tail. 17. We cut up the fish and take out all the hones. 18. We cut the fish up into small pieces the size of dice, and put them in a large basin. 19. When the potatoes are steamed, we take them out of the saucepan with a spoon. 20. We have a wire sieve ready standing over a large plate. 21. We rub the potatoes quickly through the sieve with a wooden spoon. N.B.—The potatoes when sifted should be of the same weight as the fish. 22. We add the sifted potatoes to the haddock, and mix them well together with a wooden spoon. 23. We add salt and pepper, and a few grains of Cayenne pepper to taste. 24. We put in two ounces of butter. 25. We take one egg,; and beat it slightly in a basin. 26. We pour the egg into the above mixture, and mix all together to a thick paste. 27. We take a large-sized flat tin, and butter it well with our fingers.

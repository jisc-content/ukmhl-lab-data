44 National Training School for Cookery. AUSTRALIAN MEAT. Lesson No. 3. IRISH STEW. Average cost of “Irish Stew,” made from Australian Meat. INGREDIENTS. 13 lb. of Australian meat io| 1 h lb. of potatoes i| 2 lb. of onions i Time required, about one hour. Now we will show you how to make an Irish Stew. 1. We wash one and a half pound of potatoes well in cold water, and scrub them clean with a scrubbing brush. N.B.—If the -potatoes are not very good, or are in any way diseased, we should take a sharp knife, peel them, and carefully cut out the eyes or any black specks about the potatoes, but it is much better to steam or boil them in their skins. 2. We take a potato steamer, fill the saucepan with hot water, and put it on the fire to boil. 3. We take half a pound of onions and peel them. 4. When the water is quite boiling we put the potatoes in the steamer, and sprinkle them over with salt. N.B.—As the onions are to be eaten with the potatoes, we put them in the saucepan of boiling water, and they can be boiled while the potatoes are being steamed. 5. We place the steamer on the saucepan of boiling water, and cover it down tight to keep the steam in. 6. We let the potatoes steam, and the onions boil for half an hour. 7. We take a tin of Australian meat and open it carefully. 8. We take a spoon and carefully remove the fat from the top of the meat. N.B.—The fat should be clarified, by putting into boiling water, and when cold can then be used as dripping.

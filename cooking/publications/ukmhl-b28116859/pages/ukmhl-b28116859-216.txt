Now we will show you how to Stuff a Haddock and Bake it. 1. We take a haddock, wash it, clean it carefully in cold water, and dry it in a cloth. 2. We stand a grater on a piece of paper and grate some bread crumbs. 3. We take a sprig of parsley, wash it in cold water, and dry it in a cloth. 4. We put the parsley on a board, and chop it up finely, (There should be about a dessertspoonful) 5. We take a small sprig of thyme and marjoram, take away the stalks, and chop the herbs up finely on a board. (There should be about a teaspoonful) N.B.—The stalks will do for flavouring, but they cannot be eaten, as they are bitter. 6. We mix all the herbs together with two tablespoonsful of the bread crumbs. N.B.—The remainder of the bread crumbs we shall require for rolling the fish in. 7. We add pepper and salt to taste, and mix the stuffing together with two ounces of suet.

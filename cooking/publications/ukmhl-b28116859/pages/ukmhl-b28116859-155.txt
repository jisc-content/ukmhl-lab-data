Cooking Poultry.—Trussing Roast Fowl. 149 10. We must be very careful not to break the gall bag,- or the liver will be spoiled. N.B.—We take the liver, heart, and gizzard, and put them in a basin of water, with about half a teaspoonful of salt; the other interiors should be thrown away. N.B.—We should look through the fowl from one end to the other and see it is perfectly cleared out. 11. We take a damp cloth and wipe out the inside of the fozvl to clean it thoroughly. N.B.—If the fowl is not quite fresh, we should use a little vinegar and water on the cloth we use for cleaning it, and then take a clean cloth and wipe it quite dry. 12. We take a sharp knife and cut off the claws from the legs of the fowl. 13. We take a basin of boiling water, and hold the end of the legs of the fowl in the water for a minute or two. 14. We then take off the outside skin as far as to the first joint. 15. We take a twist of paper or a taper and light it. 16. We take the fowl up by its legs and hold the lighted paper under it to singe off the little hairs. 17. We then hold the fozvl up by its wings and singe the other end. N N.B.—We must be careful in singeing not to blacken or mark the fowl in any way. 18. We turn the fowl on its breast, and draw tightly the breast skin over the incision on to the back of the neck. - 19. We cross the ends of the wings over the back of the neck. 20. We now turn the fowl on its back with the neck towards us. 21. We take a trussing needle and thread it with fine twine. 22. We hold the legs up and press the thighs well into the sides of the fowl forcing the breast up to give the fowl a good shape. 23. We take the threaded trussing needle, and pass it through the bottom of one thigh, through the body, and out on the other side- through the other thigh. N.B —If liked, a part of the gizzard and liver (when cleaned, see Note at the end of “ Trussing a Fowl for Boiling ’’) can be put into the wings of the fowl.

Lessons on Making Puddings.—Suet Pudding. 307 PUDDINGS. Lesson No. 28. SUET PUDDING. Average cost of a “ Suet Pudding ” (about two pounds). INGREDIENTS. d. \ lb. of suet 4 1 lb. of flour 2£ 1 teaspoonful of baking powder Oj Time required, about one hour and three-quarters. Now we will show you how to make a Suet Pudding. 1. We put a saucepan of warm water on the fire to boil. 2.. We take half a pound of suet, put it on a board, cut away all the skin, and chop the suet up as finely as possible with a sharp knife. 3. We put one pound of flour into a basin, with one tea- spoonful of baking powder. 4. We add the chopped suet and rub it well into the flour with our hands. N.B.—We must be careful not to have any lumps. 5. We now add enough cold water to mix it into a stiff paste. 6. We take a strong pudding cloth, wring it out in boiling water, and sprinkle flour over it. 7. We turn the paste out on to the cloth, hold up the ends of the cloth, and tie it tightly round the pudding with a piece of string, leaving room for the pudding to swell. 8. When the water in the saucepan is quite boiling, we put in the pudding, and let it boil gently for one hour and a half. N.B.—We should keep a kettle of boiling water and fill up the saucepan as the water in it boils away. 9. For serving, we take the pudding out of the saucepan, take off the cloth, and turn it on to a hot dish. N.B.—This pudding can be eaten with meat, or it can be eaten with sugar, jam, or treacle. Now it is finished. u 2

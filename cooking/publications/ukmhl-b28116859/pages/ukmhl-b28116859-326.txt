Now it is finished. 320 National Training School for Cookay, For Milk Jelly:— 1. We boil the moss in the same quantity of milk instead of water (after it has been soaked) as above, only for two hours instead of one hour. 2. We then strain it into a basin and sweeten with loaf sugar according to taste. 3. When it is cold we turn the jelly out of the basin on to a dish and it is ready for use.

Now it is finished. Lessons on Making Puddings.—Invalid Pudding. 301 9. We pour the mixture into the basin. 10. We take a cloth, dip it in hot water, and flour it. 11. We put this cloth over the top of the basin, and tie it on with a piece of string, just under the rim of the basin. 12. We tie the four corners of the cloth together loosely over the top of the basin. 13. We put this basin into the saucepan of boiling water, but we must be very careful that the water only reaches half way up the basin, or it will boil over and get into the pudding. 14. We let the pudding steam for one hour and a half. N.B.—We keep a kettle of water boiling to add to the water in the saucepan as it boils away. 15. After that time we take the basin out of the sauce- pan, take off the cloth, and carefully turn the pudding out on to a warm dish.

400 National Training School for Cookery. Now it is finished. 9. We put half an ounce of butter into a saucepan and put it on the fire. 10. When the butter is melted we stir in smoothly half an ounce of flour with a wooden spoon. 11. We take one gill (quarter pint) of broth from the mutton, pour it on to the blitter and flour, and stir smoothly until it boils and thickens. 12. We now add the chopped parsley to the sauce, and move the saucepan to the side of the fire to keep warm till required for use. 13. When the mutton is sufficiently cooked, we take out the meat and put it on a hot dish. 14. We pour the parsley sauce all over the mutton. 15. We pour the broth into a basin to cool. 16. When it is cold we should remove all the fat before warming it up for use. N.B.â€”If the broth is required for immediate use we can remove the grease with blotting paper or whitey-brown paper.

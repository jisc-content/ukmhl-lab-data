We now put in the chopped suet and rub it well into the flour with our hands. 12. We add sufficient cold water to mix it into a stiff paste. 13. We flour a board and turn the paste out on it. 14. We take a rolling-pin, flour it, and roll out the paste to the size of the saucepan. 15. This quantity of paste will roll out to the size of a two quart saucepan, so that if a smaller saucepan is used less paste will be required. 16. We put this paste over the meat in the saucepan, and let it simmer gently for one hour and half. N.B.—The lid should be on the saucepan. 17. We must watch it, and be careful to pass a knife round the sides of the saucepan, or the paste will stick. N.B.—Sailors add sliced potatoes to the pie when they can get them. 18.

Now we will show you how to make Pea Soup. 1. We put a quart of split peas into a basin with cold water to cover, them, and let them soak for twelve hours. N.B.—This should be done over night. 2. We put two quarts of cold water and the split peas into a saucepan, and put it on the fire to boil. N.B.,—If there is any liquor from boiled meat it would of course be better than water for the soup. 3. We take two onions and one turnip, wash them in cold water, peel them, and cut them in halves. 4. We take one carrot, wash it, and scrape it clean with a knife. 5. We take one head of celery, cut off the ends of the root, and wash it well in cold water. 6. When the water in the saucepan is boiling we put in all the vegetables. 7. We add twopenny worth of cooked or uncooked bones, and season it with one teaspoonful of salt and half a tea- spoonful of ground pepper. N.B.—If some liquor (in which meat or pork has been boiled) is used the addition of bones will not then be necessary.

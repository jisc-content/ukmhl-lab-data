Now it is fmished. 28 National Training School for Cookery. 26. We cut these square pieces in half, cornerwise, mak- ing the pieces into triangles. 27. We put one ounce of clarified dripping (see Lesson on “ Frying”) in a frying pan to melt. 28. When the dripping is quite hot we put in the sippets of bread, and let them fry a light brown. 29. We should turn them, so that they get browned on each side. 30. We put a piece of kitchen paper on a plate, and when the sippets are fried we turn them on to the paper to drain off the grease. N.B.—If liked, the bread could be toasted before the fire instead of fried ; in which case the bread should be cut into sippets after it is toasted. 31* For serving, we put the slices of meat on a hot dish, in the centre, strain the sauce over them and put the sippets of bread round the edge of the dish.

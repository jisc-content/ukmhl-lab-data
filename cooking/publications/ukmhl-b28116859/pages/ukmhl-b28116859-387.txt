Lesson on Making Unfermented Bread. 381 Now it is finished. BREAD. Lesson No. 2. UNFERMENTED BREAD. Average cost of “ Unfermented Bread ” (about two loaves). INGREDIENTS. d. 1 lb. of flour 1 teaspoonful of baking potvder I . Salt } °* 2s Time required, abotit three-quarters of an hour. Now we will show you how to make Unfermented Bread. 1. We put one pound of flour into a basin and mix into it one teaspoonful of baking powder and half a saltspoonful of salt. 2. We add sufficient water to make it into a light firm dough (not too stiff). N.B.—It will take about half a pint of water. 3. We sprinkle flour over a board, and turn the dough out on it. N.B.—We should keep our hands floured to prevent the dough from sticking to them. 4. We should knead it with our hands, and make it up quickly into small loaves. N.B.—Small loaves do better than large ones for unfermented bread, and the quicker the bread is made and put into the oven the better. 5. We put the loaves on a floured baking sheet, and put them in the oven (the heat should rise to 240°) to bake for half an hour. N.B.—To see if bread is sufficiently baked we run a clean knife into it, and if it comes out bright and untarnished, the bread is done. 6. We take the bread out of the oven, and stand each loaf on its side to cool.

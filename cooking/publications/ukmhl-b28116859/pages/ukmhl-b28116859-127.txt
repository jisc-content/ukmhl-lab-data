We take one and a half pound of buttock steak, put it on a board, and cut it in thin slices. 2. We should cut away all the skin. 3. We take half a poitnd of bullock's kidney, put it on a plate, and cut it in slices. 4. We put one tablespoonful of flour, teaspoonful of salt, and a teaspoonful of pepper on to a plate, and mix them well together. 5. We dip each slice of meat and kidney into the season- ing, and roll them up into little rolls. 6. We arrange these rolls of meat and kidney in a quart pie dish, and fill up the dish two-thirds with water. 7. We put one pound of flour into a basin. 8. We add one teaspoonful of baking powder and half a saltspoonful of salt to the flour, and mix them well together. 9. We take half a pound of clarified dripping; cut it in small pieces, and rub it well into the flour with our hands. N.B.—We should be careful that there are no lumps of dripping in the flour. 10. We then add by degrees enough cold water to make it into a stiff paste. 11. We take a rolling-pin and flour it. We also sprinkle flour on the board, and flour our hands to prevent the paste from sticking.

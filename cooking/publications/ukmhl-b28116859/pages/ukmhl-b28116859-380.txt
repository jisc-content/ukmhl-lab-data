INGREDIENTS. d. i b. of flour. 2\ l pint of milk o| £ lb. of butter 4 1 dessertspoonful of baking powder oj 7 Time required, about forty minutes. Now we will show you how to make Scones. 1. We put one pound of flour into a basin and mix into it a dessertspoonful of baking powder. 2. We take a quarter of a pound of butter, and rub it well into the flour with our hands. 3. We turn it out on to a floured board. 4. We flour a rolling pin and roll it out to make sure that the butter is well mixed in the flour. 5. We mix it into a smooth paste with rather less than a quarter of a pint of milk. N.B.—The paste must not be too moist. 6. We flour the rolling pin and roll out the paste to a thin sheet, about one-third of an inch in thickness. 7. We take a knife, dip it in flour, and cut the paste into triangular pieces, each side about four inches long. 8. We flour a tin, put the scones on it, and bake them directly in the oven (the heat should rise to 240°) for thirty to forty minutes. 9. When the scones are half done, we should brush them over with milk.

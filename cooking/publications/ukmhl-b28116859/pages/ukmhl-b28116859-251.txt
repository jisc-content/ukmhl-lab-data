Lessons on Making Pastry.—Puff Paste. 245 Now it is finished. 28. We take out the dummies, and turn the paste out of the tin. 29. We fill in the tartlets with jam. N.B.—If Patty Cases are required, 1. We take the puff paste, it should be half an inch thick, and stamp it out with a round cutter, the usual size of an oyster patty. 2. We take these cut rounds, and place them on a baking sheet. 3. We take a round cutter, three sizes smaller, and dip it in hot water, and stamp the cut rounds of paste in the centre, but not right through. 4. We put the baking sheet in a hot oven for six minutes. N. B.—The heat of the oven should be the same as for tartlets. 5. When the patties are sufficiently baked, we take the baking sheet out of the oven. 6. The cut centre of each patty case will have risen so that we can take it off. 7. We take a small knife, and with the point cut out all the moist paste from the centre of the patty case. 8. Now the cases are ready to be filled in with either prepared oysters, minced veal, chicken, or pheasant} &c., according to taste.

142 National Training School for Cookery. Now it is finished. is sufficiently browned on one side we must turn it care- fully over to brown the other. 13. When the steak is sufficiently browned on both sides, then put in the vegetables. 14. We take a basin and put in it a tablespoonful of flour, half a teaspoonful of salt, half a saltspoonful of pepper, and mix them together with a wooden spoon, and one pint of water or stock. 15. We stir them all well together into a smooth sauce. 16. We pour this sauce into the stewpan, with the steak and vegetables, and stir all together until it boils and thickens. 17. We let it gently simmer one hour. 18. We take the fat which we have cut off the steak and cut it into small pieces. 19. We put the pieces of fat on a tin dish. 20. We put the fat in the oven to cook till brown. N.B.—It is better for stewed steak to cook the fat separately as it keeps the gravy of the steak free from grease. 21. We take the thin pealings from the carrot and turnip, put them on a board and shred them finely with a sharp knife. 22. We put these shredded vegetables into a small sauce- pan with about a gill of cold water. 23. We put the saucepan on the fire and let it boil until the vegetables are quite tender; we must feel them with a fork. 24. When the steak is sufficiently stewed, we must put it on a hot dish. 25. We take a strainer and strain the gravy, in which the steak has been stewed, over the steak. 26. The stewed vegetables must be thrown away, as all the goodness is out of them. 27. We take the tin dish out of the oven, and place the pieces of fat about on the steak. 28. We take the boiled shredded vegetables and garnish the steak with them. N.B.—Any other vegetables can be used for garnishing, i.e., peas, French beans, asparagus, &c.

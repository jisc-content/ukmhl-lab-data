We turn the spinach on to a cullender to drain. 5. We take a large saucepan and put the spinach into it, sprinkle a saltspoonful of salt over it, and put it on the fire to boil. The drops of water on the leaves and their own juice are sufficient without adding any water. 6. We let it boil quickly for ten minutes, with the cover off. 7.

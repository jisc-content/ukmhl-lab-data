202 National Training School for Cookery. 27. We take a wire sieve and put it over a piece of paper. 28. We take a piece of crumb of bread and rub it through the wire sieve. 29. We take one egg and beat it slightly with a knife on a plate. 30. We take a saucepan and put in it 07ie pound and a half of lard or clarified dripping. 31. We put the saucepan on the fire to heat the fat. It must not burn. 32. We take the plate of lobster mixture, which should by this time be cold and rather stiff. 33. We shape the mixture into cutlets. This quantity will make seven. 34. We dip the cutlets into the egg, and egg them well all over with a brush. 35. We take them carefully out of the egg and cover them well with the bread crumbs. N.B.—If the cutlets are not well covered with egg and bread-crumbs they will burst in the frying. 36. We take a frying basket and lay in it the lobster cutlets, a few at a time, so as not to touch each other. 37. When the fat is quite hot we should test it by a frimometer if possible, and the heat should rise to 345°, or by throwing into it a piece of bread. If it makes a sharp fizzing noise it is ready. 38. We put the frying basket into the fat for three minutes, or perhaps less. The cutlets should become a pale brown. 39. We get a plate with a piece of whitey-brown paper on it, ready to receive the ciUlets when they come out of the boiling fat. This is to drain all the grease from them. 40. We take the small claws of the lobster and stick them into the end of each cutlet to represent the bone. 41. We take a few sprigs of parsley, wash them, and dry them in a cloth, and put them into the frying basket.

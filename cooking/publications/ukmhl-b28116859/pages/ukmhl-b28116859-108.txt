INGREDIENTS. a. i lb. of tripe 8 £ lb. of Patna rice of i onion Flour, sugar, and Curry powder Tune required, about three hours. Now we will show you how to make a Curry of Tripe. 1. We take one pound of tripe, put it in a saucepan of cold water, and let it boil up. Immediately it boils take it out of the water. N.B.—This is called blanching. 2. After the tripe has been blanched, we scrape it with a knife to thoroughly cleanse it. 3. We cut the tripe up into small pieces. 4. We take a saucepan and lay the pieces of tripe in it, and pour in sufficient cold water to cover the tripe. 5. We take a small onion and peel it, and cut it partially through. 6. We put the onion into the saucepan of tripe. 7. We put the saucepan on the fire, and when it boils we must remove it to the side of the fire and let it simmer for not less than two hours and a half. 8. After that time we try the tripe with a fork, and if it is sufficiently cooked it will be very tender. 9. We take the saucepan off the fire and stand it on a piece of paper on the table. 10. We take the pieces of tripe out with a fork and put them on a dish.

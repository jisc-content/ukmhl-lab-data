Now we will show you how to make a Savoury Omelet of two eggs. 1. We break two eggs into a basin. 2. We add a quarter of a teaspoonful of salt and pepper to taste. 3. We take a sprig of parsley, wash it, dry it, and chop it up finely on a board (there should be about a teaspoonful). 4. We add the chopped parsley to the eggs. 5. We beat the eggs lightly for two seconds with a fork. N.B.—The omelet could be flavoured with chopped herbs or mushrooms, with bacon or kidney cut in small pieces, or with grated cheese, according to taste. 6. We take one ounce of butter, and put it in an omelet or frying pan. 7. We put the pan on the fire to melt the butter. N.B.—The fire should be bright and clear. 8. We wait till the butter is quite hot, taking care that it does not burn. 9. We pour the mixture of the egg into the pan. 10. We stir the mixture quickly with a wooden spoon. 11. We must not let it burn or stick to the pan. We must shake the pan to prevent the omelet sticking or burning.

We bring the paste back and place it on the board, we roll it out with the rolling pin and fold it over in three. 12. We turn it round with the rough edges towards us. 13. We roll it again and fold it in three. 14. We put it aside again for a quarter of an hour. 15. We bring it back on the board and roll it with a rolling pin and fold it in three, twice as before. 16. We put it aside again for a quarter of an hour. 17. We bring it back to the board and roll it and fold it * in three as before. 18. We put it aside for another quarter of an hour. 19. We bring it back to the board, and roll it out ready, either to cover an apple tart, to make tartlets, ox patty cases. 20. If the paste is used for an apple tart, we put it over the apples in the same way as the short crust over the fruit tart (see “ Pastry,” Lesson No. 2). 21. If the paste is used for tartlets, the paste should be one-eighth of an inch thick. 22. We take the tartlet tins and wet them with tho paste brush. 23. We cut the paste out with a cutter, a size larger than the tins. The aitter must be floured or the paste will stick to it. 24. We fix the paste into the tins, and put a dummy to prevent the paste rising straight. 25. We put the tins on a baking sheet. 26. We put the baking sheet in a hot oven for six minutes, the heat of the oven should rise to 300° Fahrenheit, according to the thermometer fixed in the oven. 27. When the tartlets are baked sufficiently, we take them out of the oven.

Average cost of “ Tartare Sauce .” INGREDIENTS. d. 2 eggs 2 Salt and pepper j A tablespoonful of French vinegar > i Parsley ) Gherkins or capers i 1 gill of oil 6 10 Time required about fifteen minutes. Now we will show you how to cook Salmon and make Tartare Sauce. 1. We take a thick slice of salmon weighing one pound. 2. We cut the salmon into two thin slices as it will cook better than in a thick piece. 3. We put the salmon in a basin of cold water and wash it well. 4. We take it out of the basin and dry it well with a cloth- 5. We take a plate and pour on it about a gill of salad oil. 6. We dip the slices of salmon into the oil on both sides, the oil will prevent the fish from drying whilst cooking. 7. We season the slices on both sides with pepper and salt. 8. We take a gridiron and heat it on both sides by the fire. This is to prevent the fish sticking. 9. When the gridiron is hot, we place on the slices of salmon and let them grill for a quarter of an hour.

200 National Training School for Cookery. FISH. Lesson No. 7. LOBSTER CUTLETS. Average cost of “Lobster Cutlets" (about seven). INGREDIENTS. s. 1 Lobster from is. to 3 12 oz. of butter o \ a gill of cream o Seasoning and flavouring o 1 oz. of flour o 1 egg o Bread o Parsley o 3 Time required about three hours. 9i Now we will show you how to make Lobster Cutlets. 1. We take a small lobster—it should be a hen lobster if possible. 2. We put the lobster on a board. 3. We take a chopper and break the shell of the lobster by hitting it with the blade of the chopper, not with the edge ; 1st, because it would cut the lobster in pieces, and 2nd, because it would spoil the edge of the chopper. 4. We break all the shell off the claws and back with our fingers and take out all the flesh. 5. We cut this flesh up in pieces with a sharp knife to the size of small dice. 6. If the lobster is a hen lobster we shall find a bit of coral in the neck, and a strip of it down the back. 7. We take all this coral out of the lobster and wash it carefully in cold water in a small basin. 8. We take the coral out of the basin and put it in a mortar with one ounce of butter. 9. We pound the coral and the butter well with the pestle.

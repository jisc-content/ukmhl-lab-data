Lessons on Cleaning. 15 TO CLEAN AN IRON SAUCEPAN. 1. We should wash the saucepan well in hot water and soda. N.B.—All the black should be removed from the outside and bottom. 2. We must soap the palm of one hand, and rub the inside of the saucepan. N.B.—In washing any greasy utensil it is best if possible to use the hand instead of a flannel, as the latter retains the grease and so keeps putting the grease on again instead of rubbing it off. 3. We mix some sand and powdered soda together, and then dip the soap into it and rub the inside of the saucepan until it is quite clean and bright. 4. We now rinse it in water and dry it with a cloth. 5. We should clean the lid in the same way. N.B.—A white enamelled stewpan is cleansed in the same way, great care should be taken to remove all the stains off the white enamel inside. N.B.—Salt might be mixed with the sand and used to remove the stains from the enamel. Now it is finished. TO CLEAN A COPPER STEWPAN. 1. We mix some sand and salt together on a plate, half the quantity of salt to that of sand. 2. We wash the stewpan well in hot water and soda. 3. We soap the hand, dip it in the salt and sand, and rub the inside of the pan until all stains are removed and it • has become clean and bright. 4. We rinse it out well in the water, dry the inside quickly, and then turn over the pan and clean the copper outside.

Now we will show you how to make two quarts of Mutton Broth. 1. We take four pounds of the scrag end of the neck of mutton, wash it well, put it on a board, cut away all the faty and chop it up in large pieces. 2. We put these pieces into a stewpan, with two knuckle- bones from the legs of mutton. 3. We pour in five pints of cold water and add a salt- spoonful of salt. 4. We put the stewpan on the fire, just bring it to the boil, and then let it simmer for four hours. 5. We must watch it and skim it very often. 6. After that time we strain the stock into a basin, and put it aside uhtil it is quite cold and in a stiff jelly. 7. We then take the stock and remove all the fat from the top with a spoon. 8. We take a clean cloth and dip it in hot water, and dab over the top of the stock so as to remove every particle of grease. 9. We must now take a clean dry cloth and wipe the top of the stock dry.

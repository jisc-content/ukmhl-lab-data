Lessons on Making Creams.—-Charlotte Russe. 333 CREAMS. Lesson No. 3. CHARLOTTE RUSSE. Average cost of “ Charlotte Russe ” (about one pint). INGREDIENTS. s. d. 12 sponge finger biscuits o 6 \ oz. of the best gelatine o i£ i gill of milk o 5 pint of double cream i 3 1 dessertspoonful of sifted sugar o o| 30 drops of essence of Vanilla o 1 2 Oj Time reqtiiredfor making, about half an hour. Now we will show you how to make a Charlotte Russe. 1. We take a pint tin, and line it inside with sponge finger biscuits. N.B.—We must be careful to fit the biscuits close to each other, so that they form a wall of themselves. 2. We take a knife and cut off the tops of the finger biscuits that stand above the tin. 3. We put half an ounce of the best gelatine in a small stewpan, with one gill (a quarter of a pint) of cold milk, to soak and swell. 4. We pour half a pint of double cream into a basin, and whip it to a stiff froth with a whisk. 5. We add to it a dessertspoonfid of sifted castor sugar, and thirty drops of essence of vanilla. 6. We put the stewpan on the fire, and stir the gelatine until it is quite melted. 7. We stir the melted gelatine into the cream, pouring it through a strainer. 8. We pour this cream into the tin. N.B.—We must be careful, in pouring in the cream, not to disarrange the finger biscuits. 9. We stand this tin in ice, until it is required for use. 10. For serving, we dip the tin into hot water {or a second, shake the tin to loosen the cream, and turn it carefully on to a dish. N.B.—A more economical Charlotte Russe might be made by using a quarter of a pint of custard to a quarter of a pint of cream (as in “ Creams,’ Lesson No. 1). Now it is finished.

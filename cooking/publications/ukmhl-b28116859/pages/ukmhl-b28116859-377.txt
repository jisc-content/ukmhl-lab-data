Now we will show you how to make Ginger-bread Nuts. 1. We put one poitnd of flour into a basin with about half a saltspoonful of salt. 2. We also add half an ounce of ground ginger; one teaspoonful of carbonate of soda, and allspice (about as much as will cover a threepenny piece). 3. We put half a pound of treacle and four ounces of butter into a saucepan, and melt them together over the*, fire. 4. We mix the ingredients together and then add the melted treacle and the four ounces of butter, and mix all well together into a firm paste. N.B.—We should be very careful that all the ingredients are well mixed and that there are no lumps left. 5. We flour a board and turn the paste out on to it. 6. We should flour our hands and knead the paste. 7. We no,\y divide the paste into about twenty-four pieces. 8. We roll each piece into a ball, like a walnut, and put them two inches apart on a greased tin. 9. We put them in the oven (the heat should rise to 24c0) for fifteen minutes. 10. After that time we turn the ginger-bread nuts off the tin and set them aside to cool.

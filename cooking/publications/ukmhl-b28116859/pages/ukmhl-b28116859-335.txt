Now we will show you how to make a Vanilla Cream. 1. We take the yolks of three eggs and one white, put them into a basin, and beat them well with a wooden spoon. 2. We stir in half a pmt of milk. 3. We pour this mixture into a jug. 4. We take a saucepan half full of hot water, and put it on the fire to boil. 5. When the water is quite boiling, we move the sauce- pan to the side of the fire. 6. We stand the jug of custard in the saucepan of boiling water, and stir the mixture very smoothly until it thickens and becomes the substance of cream. N.B.—We must stir it very carefully and watch it continually that it does not curdle. 7. When the citstard is sufficiently thick, we take the jug out of the water and stand it aside to cool. 8. We put half an ounce of the best gelatine in a small stew-pan, with half a gill (one gill is a quarter of a pint) of cold water to soak and swell.

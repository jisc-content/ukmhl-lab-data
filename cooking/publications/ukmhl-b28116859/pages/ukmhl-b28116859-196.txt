Now we will show you howto make a Fish Pudding of a Haddock. N.B.—Any cold boiledfish can be used for the fish pudding, instead of haddock. 1. We take a fishkettle of warm water, and we put in it a little salt, and put it on the fire to boil. 2. We take a haddock, and put it into a basin of cold water and wash it well. 3. We take the haddock out of the basin and put it into the fishkettle of boiling water, laying it carefully on the drainer so that it is well covered with water. 4. We let it simmer for fifteen minutes. 5. We take six potatoes, put them into a basin of cold water, and scrub them well with a scrubbing-brush. N.B.—Any cold potatoes can of course be used instead of boiling fresh ones. 6. We take the potatoes out of the basin, and dry them with a cloth. 7. We take a sharp knife and peel the potatoes. 8. We take a saucepan of cold water, and lay the potatoes in it. 9. We put the saucepan on the fire to boil. It must not boil less than twenty minutes, or more than three-quarters of an hour; according to the size of the potatoes.

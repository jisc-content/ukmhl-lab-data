Now we will show you how to make a Puree of Potatoes. 1. We take one pound of potatoes, put them in a basin of cold water and scrub them clean with a scrubbing brush. 2. We take a sharp knife and peel the potatoes, and cut them in thin slices. 3. We take a small onion, wash, it well in cold water, and peel it. 4. We take two leaves of celery and wash them. 5. We take a stewpan and put in it one ounce of butter. 6. We now add the sliced potatoes, the onion, and the celery. 7. We put the stewpan on the fire and let the vegetables sweat for five minutes; we must take care that they do not discolour. 8. We pour into the stewpan one pint of white stock and stir frequently with a wooden spoon to prevent it from burning.

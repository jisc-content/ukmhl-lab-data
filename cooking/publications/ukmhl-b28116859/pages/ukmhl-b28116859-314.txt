INGREDIENTS. d. 8 oz. of flour ij 1 pint of milk 2 2 of a teaspoonful of baking powder \ x Salt ) °* 2 eggs 2 5l Time required, one hour. Now we will show you how to make a Yorkshire Pudding. 1. We put eight ounces of flour into a basin and mix into it half of a teaspoonful of baking powder and half a salt- spoonful of salt. 2. We break two eggs into the flour and stir it well. 3. We now add by degrees a pint of milk, beating all the time with a wooden spoon to make the batter as smooth and as light as possible. 4. We take a pudding tin (about a pint), place it under the meat that is roasting in front of the fire, to catch some dripping to grease the tin. 5. We then pour the batter into the tin and let it cook under the meat tor half an hour, or put it in the oven to bake for twenty minutes. 6. We must watch it, and turn the tin, so that tht pudding does not get burnt. N.B.—It is better to make hatter some time before it is required to be used, so that it may rise. N.B.—A commoner and more substantial Yorkshire pudding can be made in the same way as above, only with 6 oz. of flour, 1 egg, 1 pint of milk, and 1 tablespoonful of chopped suet sprinkled over the batter when it is poured into the tin. 7. When the pudding is sufficiently cooked, we turn it carefully out of the tin on to a hot dish, and it is then ready for serving with the roast meat.

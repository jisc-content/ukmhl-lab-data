We move the stewpan to the side of the fire and stir in half a gill of cream. 8. We take half a lemon and squeeze the juice of it into the saiLce. N.B.â€”We must be careful not to let any pips fall in. 9. We season the sauce with pepper and salt according to taste, and, if liked, we might grate about half a saltspoonful of nutmeg into it. 10. We now stir in the minced chickeny ham, and mush- rooms until all are well mixed together. 11. We take a plate and turn the contents of the stew- pan on to it. 12. We take a piece of kitchen paper, cut it to the size of the plate, butter it, and lay it on the top of the mixture, and stand the plate aside to cool. 13. When the mixture is cold we put one pound and half of lard or clarified dripping in a deep stewpan, and put it on the fire to heat. 14. We take some crumb of bread and rub it through a wire sieve on to a piece of paper. 15. If rissoles are required we put four ounces of flour on a board, and rub into it three ounces of butter until both are thoroughly mixed and there are no lumps remaining. 16. We mix the flour and butter into a stiff smooth paste with cold water. 17. We take a rolling-pin, flour it, sprinkle some flour over the board, and roll the paste out into as thin a sheet as possible. 18. We flour our hands, dip a knife in four (to prevent any sticking), and form the chicken mixture into anjr fancy shapes for croquettes either in balls or long rollsy &c., or we can roll it in the paste for rissoles. 19. We break an egg on. to a plate and beat it up slightly with a knife.

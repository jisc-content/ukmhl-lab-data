166 National Training School for Cookery. Now it is finished. 8. We take one carrot, wash it in cold water, and scrape it clean with a knife. 9. We take one turnip and two small onions, wash them in cold water and peel them. 10. We add these vegetables to the giblets in the stewpan. 11. We also put in two cloves, one blade of mace, and a bouquet garni, consisting of parsley, one sprig of thyme, lemon-thyme, basil, marjoram, and one bay-leaf, all tied tightly together. 12. We pour in two quarts of second white stock. 13. We put the stewpan on the fire, and let it boil gently for two hours ; we must skim it occasionally. 14. After that time, we take out the best pieces of the giblets, and trim them neatly. 16. We put these pieces aside until required for use. 16. We leave the stewpan on the fire to boil for half an hour. 17. We put an ounce and a half of clarified butter, and one ounce of flour into a stewpan. 18. We put the stewpan on the fire, and let the flour and butter fry for a few minutes, stirring it well with a wooden spoon. 19. We now add the stock and stir it well until it boils. 20. We must now remove the stewpan to the*side of the fire, and let it boil gently for twenty minutes (the cover of the saucepan should be only half on). 21. After that time, we take a spoon and carefully skim off all the butter that will have risen to the top of the soup. 22. We now strain the soiip into a basin, add to it half a pint of Madeira, thirty drops of lemon juice, a few grains (just enough to cover thinly a threepenny piece) of Cayenne pepper, and salt according to taste. 23. For serving, we pour the soup into a hot soup tureen, and add to it the pieces of giblet that were put aside. N.B.â€”If the wine is disliked, it may be omitted.

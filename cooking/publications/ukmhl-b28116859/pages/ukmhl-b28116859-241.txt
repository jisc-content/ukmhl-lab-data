INGREDIENTS. a• 4 large turnips 4 i oz. of butter ) r Pepper and salt j 5 Time required, about three-quarters of an hour. Now we will show you how to boil Turnips and mash them. 1. We put two quarts of warm water and a tablespoonful of salt into a saucepan, and put it on the fire to boil. 2. We take some turnips, wash them in cold water, and peel them thickly with a sharp knife. 3. If the turnips are very large, we should cut them in quarters. 4. When the water in the saucepan is quite boiling we put in the turnips and let them boil gently until they are quite tender. 5. We should feel them with a fork to see if they are tender all through. 6. We then turn them into a cullender and drain them very dry. 7. For serving, we put them on to a hot dish. If mashed turnips are required, 8. We boil them as above. 9. We squeeze them as dry as possible in the cullender, pressing them with a plate. 10. When the turnips are quite free from water, we hold the cullender over a saucepan and rub the turnips through with a wooden spoon.

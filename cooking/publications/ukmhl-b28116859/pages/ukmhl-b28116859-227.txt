Lessons on Cooking Vegetables.—Baked Potatoes. 2 21 Now it is finished. For Sauti Potatoes— 1. We take some new potatoes, as small as possible, wash them in cold water, and scrape them clean. N.B.—If the potatoes are large, they should be cut in halves, or even in quarters, and trimmed. 2. We put them in a saucepan, with cold water. 3. We put the saucepan on the fire, and only just bring them to the boil. 4. We then drain off the water, and wipe the potatoes dry in a clean cloth. 5. We take a thick stewpan and put in it two ounces of butter, and the potatoes. 6. We put the stewpan on a quick fire for about twenty minutes, to brown the potatoes; we must watch them, and when they have begun to brown we should toss them occa- sionally in the stewpan, so as to brown them on all sides alike. 7. We then strain off the butter, sprinkle them over with salt, and serve them on a hot vegetable dish. Now it is finished. For Baked Potatoes— 1. We take the potatoes, wash, and scrub them well with a scrubbing-brush in a basin of cold water. 2. We take them out of the water, and dry them with a cloth. 3. We put them in a brisk oven to bake ; they will take from half an hour to three-qu,arters of an hour, according to the heat of the oven, and the size of the potatoes. 4. We take a steel fork or skewer, and stick ;t into the potatoes, to see if they are done. They must be soft inside. 5. We take a table napkin and fold it. 6. We place the folded napkin on a hot dish. 7. When the potatoes are sufficiently baked, we take them out of the oven, and arrange them on the napkin for serving.

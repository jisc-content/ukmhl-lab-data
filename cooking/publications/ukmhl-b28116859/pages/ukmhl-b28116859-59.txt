Lessons on Australian Meat.—Fricassee. 53 Now it is finished. 9. We turn the meat out of the tin and cut it in small pieces. 10. We cut a thin slice of crumb of bread, put it on a board, and cut it up in small square pieces. 11. We cut these square pieces in half, cornerwise, mak- ing them into triangles. 12. We put three ounces of clarified dripping into a frying pan and put it on the fire to heat the fat. 13. We take a piece of kitchen paper and put it on a plate. 14. When the fat is quite hot and smoking, we throw in the sippets of bread and let them fry a pale brown. 15. We then take them out of the frying pan, and put them on the piece of paper to drain off the grease. 16. We sprinkle a little salt over the sippets, and keep them warm till required for use. 17. When the mushrooms are sufficiently cooked, we should strain the milk (in which the mushroom peelings were stewed) and stir it smoothly into the sauce. 18. We draw the saucepan to the side of the fire, and when the sauce is a little cooled, we put in the slices of mutton and let them just warm through. N.B.—We must be careful that the meat does not boil, or it will be hardened. 19. We now take out the pieces of meat and put them on a hot dish. 20. We pour the sauce over the meat, and arrange the mushrooms in the centre. 21. We place the fried sippets of bread round the edge of the dish.

Lessons on Sick-Room Cookery.—Beef Tea. 401 SICK-ROOM COOKERY. Lesson No. 15. BEEF TEA. Average cost of “ Beef Tea ” (one pint and a half), INGREDIENTS- 1 lb. of gravy beef gd. Time required, about six hours. Now we will show you how to make Beef Tea. 1. We take one pound of gravy beef, put it on a board, and cut it up very fine, removing all the skin and fat. 2. We put the meat into a saucepan with one pint and a half of cold water, half a saltspoonful of salt, and two or three peppercorns if allowed. 3. We put the saucepan on the fire, and just bring it to the boil. 4. We then move it to the side of the fire to simmer gently for five or six hours, but we must not let it reduce too much. N.B.—The lid should be on the saucepan. 5. After that time we pour off the beef tea, or strain it through a coarse cloth into a basin, and let it get cold. 6. We should remove all fat from the beef tea before warming it up for use. N.B.—Fat can be taken off hot beef tea with blotting paper or whitey-brown paper. N.B.—It is better not to strain beef tea, as it removes all the little brown particles which are most nutritious. Now it is finished. c c

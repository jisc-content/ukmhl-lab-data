Now we will show you how to make Rissoles of Australian meat. 1. We put one pound of clarified dripping into a saucepan and put it on the fire to heat. N. B.—We must watch it and be careful it does not bum. 2. We put half a pound of flour into a basin with salt (to cover thinly a threepenny piece), and four ounces of clarified dripping. 3. We rub the dripping well into theflour with our hands, until it is quite a powder. 4. We then add a little cold water and mix it into a stiff paste. 5. We flour a board and turn the paste out on to it. 6. We take a tin of Australian meat, open it carefully, and with a spoon remove all the fat off the part of the meat required for immediate use. N.B.—The fat should be clarified by putting it into boiling water; and when cold can then be used for dripping. 7. We take half a pound of meat out of the tin and scrape off as much of the jelly as possible.

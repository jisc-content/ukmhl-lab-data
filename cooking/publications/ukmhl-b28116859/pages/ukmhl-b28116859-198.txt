ig2 National Training School for Cookery. 28. We put the mixture on to this tin, and shape it as well as we can like a haddock. N.B.—If preferred, the mixture can be formed into cutlets, or croquette shapes, or as fish cakes, and egged and bread crumbed and fried in dripping, as for lobster cutlets (see “Fish,” Lesson No. 7, Note 34 to Note 40). 29. We put some little bits of butter all about on the shape. 30. We put the tin into a quick oven for a quarter of an hour. It should become a pale-brown colour. Now we will make the Sauce. 1. We take a stewpan, and put in it two ounces of butter and one ounce and a half of flour. 2. We mix them well together with a wooden spoon. 3. We add half a teaspoonful of salt. 4. We pour in half a pint of cold water. 5. We put the stewpan on the fire, and stir all smooth with a wooden spoon until it boils. 6. We now add two tablespoonsful of cream, and let it boil, stirring all the time. 7. We stand the stewpan by the side of the fire. The mixture must not boil again, but only keep warm. 8. We take a saucepan of warm water and put it on the fire to boil. 9. When the water boils we put two eggs in to boil for ten minutes. 10. We put the eggs into cold water for a minute, and then shell them. 11. We cut the eggs with a sharp knife into little square pieces. 12. We take the stewpan of sauce off the fire, and stand it on a piece of paper on the table. 13. We add the cut-up eggs to the sauce, and stir them lightly in, not to break the pieces of egg. 14. For serving we move the fish pudding carefully on to a hot dish, and pour the egg-sauce round. Now it is finished.

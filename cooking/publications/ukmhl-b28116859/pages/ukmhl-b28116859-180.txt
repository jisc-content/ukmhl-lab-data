INGREDIENTS. 2 gallons of liquor from moat | pint of oatmeal 2 onions Salt and pepper Time required, half an hour. Now we will show you how to make Crow die, or Scotch Broth. 1. We take two gallons of any meat liquor, either salt or freshy remove all the fat from it, and put it into a saucepan. 2. We put the saucepan on the fire to boil. 3. We take half a pint of oatmeal, put it in a basin, and mix it into a smooth paste, with about a gill (a quarter of a pint) of the liquor. N.B.—Half a pint of oatmeal is sufficient to thicken two gallons of liquor. 4. We take two onions, peel them, put them on a board, and chop them up as finely as possible. 5. We stir the chopped onions into the paste, and add salt and pepper to taste. N.B.—If salt liquor is used, salt should not be added. 6. When the liquor in the saucepan is quite boiling, we stir in the paste smoothly. 7. We let it boil for twenty minutes; we should stir it occasionally; it must not get lumpy. 8. For serving, we,pour it into a soup tureen or basin.

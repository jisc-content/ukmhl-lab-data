Now we will show you how to make a Plum Pudding. 1. We put a saucepan of warm water on the fire to boil. 2. We take half a pound of beef suet, put it on a board,, cut away all the skin, and chop up the suet as finely as , possible with a sharp knife. 3. We take half a pound of currants, wash them clean in water, and rub them dry in a cloth. 4. We take up the currants in handfuls, and drop them, a few at a time, on to a plate, so as to find out if there are any stones with them. 5. We take half a pound of sultmia raisins, and pick them over N.B.—If large raisins are used, they should be stoned.

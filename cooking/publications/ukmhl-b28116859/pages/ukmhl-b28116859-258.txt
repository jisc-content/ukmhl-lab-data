We take five ounces of beef suety and put it on a board. 2. We take a knife, and cut away all the skin, and chop up the suet as finely as possible. 3. We put half a pound of flour into a basin, and add to it the chopped suet and a teaspoonful of salt. 4. We rub the suet well into the flour with our hands. 5. We then add, by degrees, enough cold water to make it into a smooth paste. We should mix it well. 6. We take the paste out of the basin, and put it on a board. 7. We take a rolling-pin and flour it. We also sprinkle flour on the board, to prevent the paste from sticking.

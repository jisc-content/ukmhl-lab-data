Lessons on Cleaning, 13 12. We then wring the flannel out in the hot water, and smooth the hearth over, rubbing it lightly all in one direction. 13. We must black-lead and polish the inside of the fender in the same way as we did the range, and brighten the rim of it by rubbing it with emery paper. Now it is finished. TO LAY A FIRE. 1. We should place a few sifted cinders at the bottom of the grate. 2. We then put in a piece of crumpled paper, and arrange the sticks over it, laying them across each other. 3. We now put a few pieces of coal on the top, rather to the front, so as to leave a good draught at the back to draw the fire. 4. When the fire is lighted and has burned up a little we can add more sifted cinders mixed with the coal. 5. We should only put small quantities of coal and cinders on the fire at a time. Now it is finished. TO CLEAN A CLOSE KITCHEN RANGE. 1. We proceed in the same way as for an open range (see notes 1 and 2). 2. We must now take down the doors of the flues at the back of the range, and take off all the lids of the flues over the oven and boiler. 3. We take the turkâ€™s head or flue brush, push it care- fully up each flue at the back, so as to sweep them as clean as possible. 4. We must then put it in the flues above the oven and boiler, and sweep all round.

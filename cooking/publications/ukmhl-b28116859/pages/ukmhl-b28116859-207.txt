Lessons on Cooking Fish.â€”Lobster Cutlets. 201 10. We take it out of the mortar and scrape the mortar out quite clean with a palette knife or a slice of raw potato, for none must be lost. 11. We take a hair sieve and put it over a plate. 12. We pass the pounded mixture through the sieve with a wooden spoon. 13. We must turn up the sieve when all the mixture has passed through, and we shall find some sticking inside. 14. We scrape all this carefully off with the spoon. 15. We make it all into a little pat. 16. We take a stewpan and put in it one ounce of flour and half an ounce of butter. We mix them well together with a wooden spoon. 17. We add one gill of cold water (one gill is a quarter pint). We put the stewpan on the fire and stir the mixture with a wooden spoon till it boils and thickens. 18. We add one tablespoonfid of cream and stir smoothly until it boils. 19. We take the stewpan off the lire and stand it on a piece of paper on the table. 20. We now stir in by degrees the pat of coral butter. We must be sure the sauce is quite smooth and not lumpy. 21. We add salt and pepper and a few grains of cayenne pepper, according to taste, and about six drops of lemon juice, and mix well. 22. We add the chopped lobster and stir lightly, not to break up the lobster, but only to mix it with the sauce. 23. We take a clean plate and pour the mixture from the stewpan on to it, smoothing it with a knife. 24. We take a piece of paper and cut it round to the size of the plate. We butter it with a knife. 25. We put the buttered paper over the mixture which is in the plate, to prevent the dust from getting in. 26. We take the plate and stand it on ice (if possible), or put it in a cold place to cool.

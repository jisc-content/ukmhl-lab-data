Now we will show you how to make Mulligatawny Soup. 1. We take a tin of Australian mutton and open it care- fully. 2. We take a spoon and carefully remove all the fat from the top of the meat. N.B.—The fat should only be removed from that part of the meat which is required for immediate use. N.B.—The fat should be clarified, by putting it into boiling water, and when cold can then be used as dripping. 3. We take two pounds of the mutton out of the tin, put it in a basin with two quarts of warm water. 4. We take two apples, peel them, and put them on a plate. 5. We cut the apples in quarters, cut out the core, and then cut the quarters into slices, and put them into a sauce- pan with two ounces of the clarified fat. 6. We take one turnip and two good-sized onions, peel them, cut them in pieces, and put them in the saucepan. 7. We put the saucepan on the fire, and give one stir to the vegetables with a wooden spoon.

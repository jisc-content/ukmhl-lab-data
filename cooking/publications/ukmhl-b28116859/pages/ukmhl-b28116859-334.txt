328 National Training School for Cookery. Now it is finished. 9. When the apples are cooked to a pulp, we place a hair sieve over a basin and rub the apples through with a wooden spoon. 10. We now stir the melted gelatine into the apple. N.B.—We must be very careful that the gelatine is quite smoothly dissolved there should be no lumps. N.B.—If liked, part of the apple might be coloured by stirring in half a tea- spoonful of cochineal. 11. We take a pint and a half mould, rinse it out in boiling water and then in cold water. 12. We can ornament the bottom of the mould with pistachio nuts cut in small pieces, or preserved cherries, according to taste. 13. We now pour the apple in the mould, and if part of the apple is coloured we should fill the mould with alternate layers of coloured and plain apple. 14. We stand the mould aside in a cool place to set the apple. 15. For serving we dip the mould in boiling water for a second and then turn out the apple jelly carefully on to a dish. N.B.—Half a pint of double cream whipped to a stiff froth should be served with the apple jelly, either put round the edge of the dish or in the centre of the moiild.

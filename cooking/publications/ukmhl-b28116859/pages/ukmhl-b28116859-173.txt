Now we will show you how to make Mock Turtle Soup. 1. We take half a calf s head, and wash it well in water, to remove all blood and impurities. 2. We cut all the flesh from the bones, and tie the flesh up in a very clean cloth or napkin. 3. We put it in a large stewpan with the bones and four quarts of cold water, and half a tablespoonful of salt. 4. We put the stewpan on the fire, and let it come to the boil.

180 National Training School for Cookery. Now it is finished. SOUPS. Lesson No. 14. GERMAN PEA SOUP. Average cost of “ German Pea Soup ” (about three pints) made without Meat. INGREDIENTS. 5 of a stick of German pea soup sausage (to be bought at 8d. the stick) 2d. 3 pints of water Time, required, about a quarter of an hour. Now we will show you how to make Pea Soup from the German pea soup sausage. 1. We put three pints of warm water into a saucepan, and put it on the fire to boil. 2. We take a quarter of a stick of German pea soup sausage, and scrape it into a basin. 3. We add to it a very little warm water, let it soak, and then mix it into a smooth paste. N.B.—We must be very careful that there are no lumps in the paste. 4. When the water in the saucepan is quite boiling, we should stir the paste in smoothly. 5. It is now ready for use and should be poured into a hot soup tureen. N.B.—If the soup is preferred thinner, more water might be added. N.B.—A dessert-spoonful of chopped mint might be added to the soup, if the flavour is liked.

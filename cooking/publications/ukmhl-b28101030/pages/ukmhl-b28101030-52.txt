48 sized border mould. Before moulding, mix it with half an ounce of grated cheese and one ounce of chopped ham, and season to taste. With this fill a buttered border mould and place it in the oven to keep hot. Heat up half a pint of olive oil in a small shallow pan, drop in five or six eggs, frying only one at a time; great care must be taken that the yolk of egg is kept well coated with the white part, in fact each egg should be just like a poached egg, only that it is cooked in hot oil, instead of water. As the eggs are fried drain them carefully and trim nicely, then place them in the centre of the rice border, which must be turned out on a hot dish. Pour over the rice some nicely sea- soned hot tomato sauce, and serve. (79) t Eggs and Tomatoes Brouilles. Peel three small ripe tomatoes and slice them ; fry them in an ounce of butter, and pour in four well beaten and seasoned eggs; stir the whole over the fire till the eggs thicken or begin to set, then dish up and place six thinly cut slices of frizzled bacon on top. Serve hot. (80) Eggs in Parsley Sauce. (CEufs a la poulette.) Boil six new-laid eggs for just five minutes, and shell them carefully; cut off one end of each and range the eggs on a hot dish. Pour over a nicely seasoned parsley sauce—that is, bechamel or other good white sauce., with finely chopped parsley and a little lemon juice—and serve.

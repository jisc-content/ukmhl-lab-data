8i moister and lighter. Season moderately. Do not use pungent spices. 4th.—Heating the Butter. See that the butter used is hot but not oily before the egg mixture is poured into the omelet pan. One ounce of butter is usually ample to make an omelet of six eggs. 5th.—Cooking the Omelet. An omelet must be cooked over a bright, brisk fire because it needs to be made quickly ; the process of stirring and shaking the pan whilst the omelet is made must also be quickly performed. Use a spoon in preference to a fork for stirring. (165) How to shape an Omelet. Once the egg mixture begins to set, that is when the eggs appear sufficiently cooked, which means light and yet moist or soft, shape it by folding in the ends, so as to give it the form of an oval cushion. This must be done nearest the side of the handle. Shake or knock the pan gently, so as to loosen the omelet. Let it take colour, viz.: a golden brown. (166) How to turn out an Omelet. To do this correctly and successfully, hold the pan by its handle with the right hand, the palm of the hand being under- neath the handle. Hold an oblong warm dish in the left hand, bring the outer edge of the pan close to the centre of the dish, turn out the omelet by turning the pan upside down, and then quickly remove the pan. The process of making a plain omelet should not take more than five minutes. F

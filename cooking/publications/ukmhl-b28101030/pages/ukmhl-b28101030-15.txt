II Food Value of Eggs. The average weight of a hen’s egg is about two ounces avoirdupois. The composition of the white of an ordinary hen’s egg is :— Nitrogenous matter 20.4 Fatty matter 10.o Mineral matter 1.6 Water 68.0 Composition of the yolk :— Nitrogenous mdtter 16.0 Fatty matter 30.7 Mineral matter 1.3 Water 52.0 It will thus be seen that eggs are almost a complete food, being particularly rich in nitrogenous elements. Dr. Parrott, in writing on the chemistry and dietetic value of eggs, states that, as compared with other articles of food, eggs contain on an average 4 per cent, less pro- tein and 6 per cent, less fat than sirloin steak, half as much protein and one-third as much fat as cream cheese, and twice as much protein, with ten times as much fat, as oysters. Their fuel value is about two- thirds that of beef, and but one-third that of good cheese. Compared with wheat flour, eggs contain an equal amount of pro- tein, ten times as much fat, but less than half as much fuel value. Eggs contain practically no carbohydrates, while wheat flour contains 75 per cent. Chemically speaking, therefore, eggs are rich in building and repair material, but do not furnish a proportionate percentage of energy. This is why it is now admitted that eggs do not furnish perfect nutrition

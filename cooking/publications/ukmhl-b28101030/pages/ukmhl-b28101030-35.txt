31 (46) Egg Patties. (Bouchees aux ceufs.) For this a salpicon as described in the preceding recipe may be prepared, or plain hard-boiled eggs can be cut into dice or strips, in place of the custard; the truffle, ham, or tongue may, if liked, be added, in which case use rather less mushrooms. Have ready some small puff- paste patty cases, fill them with the salpicon,, place the lid on each, dish up, reheat, then garnish with sprigs of parsley, and serve. (47) Egg Cutlets. (Cotelettes aux ceufs.) Boil four eggs till hard (allow io min- utes), cool them and remove the shell, then chop them, not too finely. Chop likewise, but rather finer, two ounces of cooked bacon or ham, and about a dessert- spoonful of parsley. Prepare a white sauce with i oz. butter, | oz. of flour, stirred in and kneaded, and a gill of milk, full measure. Cook it for a few minutes and stirring all the time to prevent lumps forming. Now add the above-named ingredients, mix well and season with salt, pepper and a grate of nutmeg. Spread on to a dish and let cool. Divide the mixture into eight or nine portions and shape each into a cutlet. Egg and crumb them carefully, and fry them in deep hot fat. Drain well, insert a small piece of macaroni at the end of each cutlet, to represent the bones. Dish up, garnish with fried parsley, and serve.

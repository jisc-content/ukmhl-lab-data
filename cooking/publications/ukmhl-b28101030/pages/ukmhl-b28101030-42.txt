38 pound until quite smooth, and rub through a sieve. Fill the hollows of the whites of eggs with this. Have ready eight rounds of bread a little larger than the cut sides of the eggs, fry them to a golden colour in but- ter or lard, when drained and'cold spread one side with the remainder of the mixture, cut the points off the eggs so as to make them stand firmly, and place each half in the centre of a croute. Cut out fanciful pieces of the chilli pod or pimiento, put one in the centre of the stuffing, mix the spinach with the butter, rub all through a fine sieve, put this into a forcing-bag or paper cornet, and ornament the sides and tops of croutes according to fancy. Keep in a cool place. Dish up when required for table. <59\) Egg Croquettes. (Croquettes d'CEufs.) Chop rather coarsely four hard-boiled eggs; chop likewise, but rather finer, two ounces of cooked tongue or ham, and about a dessert-spoonful of parsley. Pre- pare a white sauce with one ounce of butter,, three-quarters of an ounce of flour stirred in and blended, and a gill of milk. Cook it for a few minutes, stirring all the time to prevent lumps from forming. Now add the above-named ingredients; mix well, and season with salt, pepper, and a grate of nutmeg. Spread the mixture on to a dish and let it cool. Divide the mixture into eight or nine portions and make each into a ball or cork shape; egg and crumb them carefully, and fry them in deep hot fat. Drain them on a cloth. Dish up, garnish with fried parsley, and serve.

Have ready a table- spoonful of chopped preserved ginger mixed with two table-spoonfuls of syrup and a table-spoonful of cream; put in the centre of the omelet, roll, turn out on a heated dish, then pour a little ginger syrup round the base of the omelet and serve hot. <219) Sweet Omelet. {Omelette sucree.) Beat up five fresh eggs, add a tiny pinch of salt and a table-spoonful of castor sugar.

Allow the omelet to acquire a golden brown colour, turn out on to a hot dish, dredge over with castor or icing sugar and brown under a salamander or mark with a red- hot, skewer. G

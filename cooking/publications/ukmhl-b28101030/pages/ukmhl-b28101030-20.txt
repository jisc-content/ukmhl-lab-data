i6 eight small halfmoon-shaped slices of bread fried in clarified butter. Garnish with sprigs of parsley, and serve hot. (7) Poached Eggs in White Wine. (CEufs poches au vin blanc.) Poach carefully six to eight eggs in slightly salted water, flavoured with white wine (Chablis or Sauterne) and a few drops of lemon juice. Have ready as many fried bread croutons as there are poached eggs. Take up the eggs, trim them neatly, and place them on the croutons, then dish up. Have ready a sauce prepared with one gill of re- duced white wine, an ounce and a half of meat glaze, and one ounce of butter; the latter must be whisked in in very small quantities,, and must not boil. Season with a good pinch of cayenne or Krona pepper. Mask the eggs with the sauce, which must be thick enough to coat them nicely, sprinkle a little chopped parsley over each egg, and serve. <8) Eggs with Nouilles a la Carola. Prepare some nouille paste (page 106), cut it into very thin strips, and blanch in salted water for three minutes ; drain and toss in butter. Season with nutmeg and pepper, and put some on a buttered fire- proof dish. Upon this range a layer of slices of hard-boiled eggs, then a layer of nouilles, and lastly a layer of fresh mush- rooms, seasoned and tossed in butter. Dredge well with grated cheese. Cover with a well-reduced bechamel sauce. Sprinkle over some grated cheese and a little oiled butter. Bake in a sharp oven for ten minutes.

25 (29) Eggs a la Turque. Break six to eight eggs into a basin,, season with pepper and salt and a tea- spoonful of chopped parsley. Whisk them well and stir into a stewpan containing an ounce of melted butter; stir over the fire till the eggs are set enough to be turned out, then dress them in the form of a border on a hot round dish. Have ready a saute of chicken livers (finely sliced and tossed in butter, flavoured with shallot and parsley, and suitably sea- soned) ; put these in the centre of the dish, pour some hot tomato sauce (No. 252) round the base of the dish, and send to table immediately. (30) Eggs a la Coquette. Take six to eight new-laid eggs, one ounce butter, about half a gill cream, three ounces lean ham or tongue, salt, cayenne, and nutmeg. Procure six to eight small china souffle cases; butter them well; put a small piece of butter in each of them,, also a table-spoonful of cream, a pinch of salt, and a little grated nutmeg ; place them on a baking-sheet in a hot oven or on the top of the stove. When the contents com- mence to simmer break carefully into each one egg; put a tiny pinch of cayenne pepper in the centre of each yolk ; put back on the stove or in the oven, and allow the eggs to set lightly. Have ready the ham or tongue finely chopped, sprinkle over the white part, so as to leave the yolks free ; serve hot.

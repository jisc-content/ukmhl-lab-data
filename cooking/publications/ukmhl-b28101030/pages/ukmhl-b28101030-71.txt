Mix these on a plate and besprinkle with it the inside of the moulds so as to com- pletely coat them. Break an egg into each and add the necessary seasoning of salt, pepper, and paprika; on top of each egg put a very small piece of butter. Next place the moulds in a saute or braising pan half filled with boiling water; cover the pan with its lid and poach in the oven for about six minutes, by which time the eggs should be set. Turn out the moulds on little rounds of toast; dish up and pour over sufficient brown sauce, demi- glace, or Madere to well coat the egg shapes. Serve hot. (128) Savoury Eggs and Tomatoes.

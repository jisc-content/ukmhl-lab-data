102 < 230) Fried Egg Croutes (Sweet). (Pain perdu.) Cut some milk rolls into neat slices, dip each in sweetened milk, and then in beaten egg. Drop the slices into hot clarified butter, and fry a golden brown. Take up, drain the slices or croutes, dredge with castor sugar mixed with a little ground cinnamon, then dish up and serve hot. (231) Snow Eggs a la Vanille. Put a pint of milk, a gill of cream, and two ounces of loaf sugar and vanilla pod in a saute-pan and boil up. Whisk the whites of four fresh eggs to a stiff froth and sweeten slightly. When the milk, cream, etc., is boiling drop into it the whites of egg, previously shaped with a tablespoon (the shape of quenelles); dip the spoon into boiling water each time it is used, and poach only a few at a time. Turn the shapes as they are being poached. Each quenelle will take from three to four minutes to cook. When done take up and drain, range them nicely in a hot dish. Pour a little custard over and round the quenelles, and serve. Use vanilla pod if possible, as it gives a better flavour than the essence. ( 232 ) Snow Eggs au Citron. Proceed the same as directed in the fore- going recipe, omit the vanilla and add a thin strip of lemon rind to the milk. Chop or grate the rind of half a lemon and mix with the whisked whites of eggs. Shape and poach in sweetened milk as directed.

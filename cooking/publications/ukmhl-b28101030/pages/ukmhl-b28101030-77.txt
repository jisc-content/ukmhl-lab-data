73 ounce of leaf gelatine, one large truffle, slices of cooked ox-tongue or ham, salad and dressing. Poach the eggs carefully in slightly salted water, containing a little lemon juice; when set take up and trim and set them on a sieve to cool. Heat up the white sauce; add to it the gelatine, pre- viously dissolved and strained. Season to taste and mix with a couple of table- spoonfuls of aspic. When nearly cold mask half the number of poached eggs. This must be done twice, allowing the first coating to set before the second one is added. Now heat up the tomato sauce,, and mix in an equal quantity of white sauce and some aspic jelly; when nearly cold mask the remainder of eggs in the same manner.

Place one egg on each slice, mask them over with a thin coating of aspic; decorate tastefully with fancifully cut slices of truffle. Dish up on a cold dish in the form of a border, fill the centre of the dish with a nicely prepared salad, and serve.

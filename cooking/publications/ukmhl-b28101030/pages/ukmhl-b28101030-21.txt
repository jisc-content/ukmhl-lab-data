C9) Poached Eggs with Spinach. (CEnfs fioches aux Epinards.) Get ready the following' ingredients: â€” Six fresh eggs, a teaspoonful of lemon juice or white vinegar, one and a-half pounds of spinach, one and a-half ounces of butter, one table-spoonful of rich brown sauce, salt, pepper, nutmeg, two slices of toasted bread. Pick and wash the spinach, put it in a copper stew-pan with very little water and cook for half an hour. Put it in a colander and drain well, squeezing out all the water. Rub the spinach through a sieve. Melt the butter in a stew-pan, put in the spinach puree, season with pepper, salt, and a pinch of grated nutmeg; moisten with the sauce and cook gently for twenty- five minutes or so. Have ready a shallow stew-pan with boiling water, slightly salted; add the vinegar or lemon juice. Break each egg carefully into a cup and gently slide into the boiling water (great care must be taken so that they do not scatter). Allow the eggs to cook until perfectly set, but without allowing the yolks to get hard. Have the spinach dressed neatly on a hot dish; take up each egg by means of a slice or small skimmer ; trim each a little and place on the spinach. Pour a little demi-glace sauce or gravy round the dish; garnish with sippets of toasted bread and serve immediately. CIO) Poached Eggs a la Provencale. (CEufs poches a la Trovcn^ale.)

12 for the adult body. It must, however, be remembered that Nature endows the diges- tive organs with a considerable degree of vital discretion, or power of transforma- tion ; so that both proteids and carbohy- drates are to a certain extent commuted into energy, and vice versa. The white of egg is comparatively free from fat; fat, however, is found in the yolk. The egg is a concentrated economic form of wholesome human food, which supplies at times a desirable substitute for flesh food. The cost of eggs compares most favourably with other food products, being about 25 per cent, per pound cheaper than rump steak ; whilst their food value ranks as high, if not higher than meat. The Digestibility of Eggs. The digestibility of eggs is about the same whether raw, lightly cooked, or thoroughly cooked. The time required to digest a cooked egg varies from 3-4 hours. This will seem incredible to those who have always been accustomed to insisting upon their eggs being “ soft-boiled,” or lightly cooked. Digestibility, says Dr. Parrott, however, does not imply so much the rapidity with which food leaves the stomach as the completeness of its ab- sorbability and appropriation by the sys- tem. Experiments in this have demon- strated that a healthy stomach digests a hard-boiled egg quite as thoroughly as a soft-boiled one ; but this does not prove that the process is as quickly accomplished or that the hard-boiled egg does not com- pel a somewhat greater effort on the part of the digestive organs. With healthy persons the degree of cooking may there-

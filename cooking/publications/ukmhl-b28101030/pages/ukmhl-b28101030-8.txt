The physiological structure of the egg is perhaps less familiar. A fer- tile egg contains an embryo, and is at the same time a storehouse of material for the development and growth of the young individual from the embryo, until it has reached such a stage that life is possible outside the narrow limits of the shell. The embryo is situated quite close to the yolk, which furnishes the nutritive mate- rial for its early development, the white being used later.” April, 1905. C. H. S.

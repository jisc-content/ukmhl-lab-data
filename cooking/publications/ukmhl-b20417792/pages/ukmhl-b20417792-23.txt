METHODS OF COOKIN'^, XV Baked puddings that resemble a soufile, and that have frothed white of eggs mixed with them the moment before they are put in the oven, require a moderate heat, and should be sent to table the instant they are taken out of the oven. A sheet of white paper placed over a pudding, when it is set and slightly browned, will preserve it from burning or from becoming too dark a colour. Large cakes require a well-sustained heat, or they will not be baked through : when done they should be gently taken out of the moulds and put near the door of the oven to dry the surface, and then laid on their sides on a sieve to cool. Small cakes and gingerbread must be baked in a slow oven, but light cakes, macaroons, ratafias, etc., require rathei more heat. Bread should be baked in a moderately quick oven only, otherwise the crust hardens before the inside has been allowed time to be properly baked. All light cakes and puddings containing eggs should be baked immediately they are mixed ; it is as well also to apply this rule to those made with baking-powder. Pastry, however, made the day before it is baked, is generally far better than that made the same day, allowing of course that it is kept in a cool place during the interval, and is finally rolled out just before baking. Cake-tins should always be lined with greased paper in preference to greasing the tin itself, as in this way the chance of burning is greatly lessened; and if the paper is not re- moved until the cake has been turned out of the tin some little time, and become quite cold, the cake will remain moist and fresh much longer than otherwise. BOILING. The time required for boiling meat varies with the size and nature of the jint, and also with the kind of meat: the

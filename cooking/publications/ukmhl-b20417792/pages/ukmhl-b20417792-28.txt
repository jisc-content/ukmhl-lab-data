The gridiron should be perfectly clean and polished: gridirons with fluted bars and a receptacle for the gravy answer best. When hot the bars should be nibbed with suet or grease, to prevent the meat from sticking to them : chalk is used instead of grease for fish, and the gridiron is held in a sloping position over the fire. No salt should be sprinkled on the meat before broiling, as it has the effect of bringing out the gravy, which falls into the fire and is wasted. The meat, if thick, must be gradually heated through by being kept at a little distance above the fire, otherwise the outside will be burnt while the inside is nearly raw: thin meat may be broiled more briskly. Steaks, chops, and all broiled articles should be frequently turned with a pair of tongs: the holes made by a fork let the gravy out. Meat that has been dipped in egg and bread crumbs should also be dipped in clarified butter before broiling; cutlets may be seasoned a little with pepper and salt, and then brushed over with oil or butterâ€”they are very good cooked in this way. Fish may be wrapped in buttered paper for broiling. STEWING. Fresh meat for stewing may be first gently boiled in the stewpan with the vegetables and stock, and then skimmed, but sometimes the meat is put into boiling stock or water: at other times cold water or stock, sufiicient only to provide the necessary gravy in either case, is poured over it. In French stews the meat and vegetables are browned in butter and flour in the stewpan, the hot stock is then added

xvii METHODS OF COOKING. taken out of the pot as soon as it is doneâ€”it will become sodden and flavourless if left too long in the water. Meat that is to be eaten cold, such as tongue or ham, should be allowed to cool in the liquor it has been boiled in ; rolled tongue and pressed spiced beef are, of course, exceptions, as they must be moulded while hot. The meat should always be covered with water, although it is not desirable that there should be a great depth of water above the joint. Fast boiling will entirely spoil the meat, and render it hard, tough, and a bad colour. The scum must be taken off as it rises, but, except when skimming is necessary, the lid should be left on the pot, and the heat, which need not be great for simmering, should be even and uninterrupted. In boiling poultry or white meats, a piece of bread without crust, and a little butter or beef suet, may be added to the water to soften it, and to keep the colour and improve the flavour of the joint. Fish should, as a rule, be placed in cold water, and brought gradually to the boil. Salmon is an exception, however, for unless placed into boiling, or nearly boiling, water it loses its beautiful colour. White fish should be rubbed over with lemon and allowed to remain in cold water for two or three hours before cooking, and when placed on the strainer of the. fish-kettle a piece of muslin should be laid over the top and carefully tucked under the fish all round; this will at once preserve the whiteness and prevent the skin from breaking. White fish, as a rule, requires, after the water boils, six minutes for every pound and ten minutes extra ' for the fish.* Salmon requires seven minutes for every pound, and ten minutes extra. Vegetables (potatoes excepted) should, as a rule, be placed in boiling water from the first. The time required for cooking them varies with different kinds of vegetables, and even with the same kind at difierent times of the year.

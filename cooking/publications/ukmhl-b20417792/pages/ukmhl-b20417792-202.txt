Pick and singe carefully. 2. Break the leg-bones close to the feet, 3. Hang it on a hook and draw out the strings from the thigh, 4. Cut the neck off close to the back, but leave the crop-skin long enough to turn over the back. 5. Remove the crop, and with the middle finger loosen the liver and the gut at the throat end. 6. Cut off the vent, remove the gut, take a crooked wire and pull out the gizzard, and the liver will easily follow. 7. Take care not to break the gall-bladder, if you do, it will entirely spoil the flavour of the bird by giving it a bitter taste which no washing will remove. 8. Do not break the gut joining the gizzard either, lest the inside should become gritty.

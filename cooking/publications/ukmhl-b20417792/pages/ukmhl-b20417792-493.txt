459 INVALID COOKERY. SECTION XXIIL—INVALID COOKERY. In preparing food for the sick-room the utmost care is required. As Httle grease as possible should be used, and all appearance of grease avoided in dishing' up. Strong flavourings of any kind, such as onions and herbs in soups, should never be used. For puddings and sweets a little lemon is the safest flavouring. Always serve food for an invahd in delicately small quantities, and arrange tastefully, and in an appetising manner, upon the plate. If the food is fried it should be most exquisitely done—a beautiful brown, and perfectly drained of all grease. 1.—BEEF TEA. Order. Ingredients. Quantities. Method. I...

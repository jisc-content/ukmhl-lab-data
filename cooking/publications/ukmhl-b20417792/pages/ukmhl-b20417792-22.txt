The oven is, however, exceedingly well adapted for many methods of slow cooking when regular heat is required. Stews of meat, fish, or vegetables may all be cooked in the oven, either in earthen jars or in stewpans—rice baked in this way, with a proper amount of liquid and a little meat or fish, is excellent; and stock and soup can be as well prepared in the oven as on the fire. Many kinds of fish are nicer when baked than dressed in any other way; fresh cured hams may be covered with paste and then baked, and will be found very tender and of fine flavour—in fact, any process of cooking that is done in a closed vessel, and that requires gentle and regular heat, may be safely entrusted to the oven. For baking pastry the oven should be moderately hot to raise the paste, but not hot enough to burn it before it is cooked through. When the pastry has been put in, the oven door must be closed, and not opened again until the paste is thoroughly set: if the heat is checked, or allowed to escape, the pastry will fall and become tough. Raised pies require a much hotter oven than is needed for fruit tarts : it is a good plan to heat the oven by burning wood in it for an hour or so before the pie is put in. Resi- nous or scented wood must not, however, be used for this purpose. Meat pies, when sufficiently browned, should be allowed to stand on the top of the oven for an hour or more, that the meat in them may become thoroughly cooked. The paste may be covered with white paper, to preserve it from blacks or dust and from burning. Baked milky puddings, such as rice, sago, custard, etc., require a very gentle oven ; but puddings of the batter kind require more heat to raise them.

It is most particularly recommended that in cases of incipient greyness this should be tried before artificial colour restorers are resorted to.

DEPILATORY (Powdee).—Mr. Mason is con- tinually asked by Ladies for a Depilatory which will, in one application, not only remove existing superfluous hair, but also prevent its re-appearance.

All that can be done is to remove the hair; after which an occasional subsequent application on the surface of the skin will prevent it from attaining a visible growth.

ix PREFACE. Again, most of our recipes for omelets contain a great number of eggs; for a rich omelet, or for one required to suffice for several persons, this is, of course, necessary; but a delicious omelet for one or two persons can be made with two or three eggs and one or two ounces of butter. Beat the whites and yolks separately; flavour; when the whites are a firm froth mix quickly with the yolks, and pour into the pan; fry carefully and you will have an omelet at once excellent and economical. Baking is perhaps one of the simplest and easiest modes of cooking; the chief requisites being the thorough knowledge and proper regulation of the oven. Meat demands perhaps more attention than any other food whilst baking, as it must be constantly watched and basted to prevent burning. Baking-tins for joints always consist of a rather shallow dish fitting into a deep one, which latter should always be kept filled with water during the process of cooking, to prevent the gravy or the bottom of the joint becoming burnt. As already stated in the first Preface, pastry and light cakes require a quick oven. Cakes requiring a long time to cook should be first put into a quick oven till the crust has suffi- ciently risen, and then carefully removed to a lower shelf to bake through. There is little that has not been mentioned in the foregoing Preface as regards boiling meat and poultry of all kinds, the general rule being to place it at once in boiling water. It is scarcely necessary to mention that puddings are always put into boiling water. Finally, we may add that some pains have been taken to make the Second Edition of this work as accurate and com- plete as possible; but, should any of our friends discover errors or omissions, we shall esteem it a great favour to have them pointed out.

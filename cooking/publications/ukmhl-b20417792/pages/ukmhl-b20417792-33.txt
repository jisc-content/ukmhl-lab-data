METHODS OF COOKING. XXV the fire, and let the syrup boil for five minutes without disturbing it. Take the pan off the fire, let it stand tw^o minutes, and then skim carefully and thoroughly. Put the pan back on the fire, and when the syrup begins to boil pour in a little of the water that was left over. Repeat the skimming until the syrup is quite clear, and then strain through muslin into a clean pan to be boiled again. There are several degrees of boiling sugar which may be learnt most accurately by means of a syrometer, but which may be judged of with a considerable degree of correctness by the ordinary thumb and finger test. The first stage is that of a thin syrup; if the finger is dipped in water and then in the liquid, and pressed against the thumb and quickly withdrawn, the syrup will form short threads that snap directly. Another five or ten minutes of rapid boiling will bring it to the second stage of a thick syrup, and the threads may then be drawn out to a great length without breaking. Long threads will also fall from the skimmer when this is raised. In the next two stages the syrup forms bubbles on the surface in boiling, small at first and then large; if it is intended to make barley sugar or caramel the flavouring of lemon juice must now be added, but for candying the syrup is simply stirred until it rises in white foam almost to the top of the pan. It must now be taken out instantly and put on dishes, or it will resolve itself into a powder that will require more water and reboiling. Stirring is necessary in making barley-sugar, after the lemon juice is put in, which is at the rate of a dessert-spoonful of strained lemon- juice to three pounds of sugar. To test the barley-sugar, drop a little from the ladle or skimmer into a basin of cold water, take it out at once, and if it snaps clean and crisp between the teeth it is done, and must be taken off the fire immediately.

SAUCES FOR FISH, MEAT, ETC. 7* Mayonnaise Sauce. 1 raw yolk of egg. 1 saltspoonful dry mustard. Pinch of salt and pepper. Cayenne. Salad oil. 1 teaspoonful tarragon or malt vinegar. A few drops of lemon juice. Method: Put the yolk, mustard, salt, pepper and cayenne into a small basin. Mix thoroughly till the mixture begins to thicken, then add the oil gradually, either dropping it in yery slowly and working with a wooden spoon, or putting in 1 teaspoonful at a time and whisking well with a small wire whisk between each addition. When finished it should be the consistency of soft butter. If used for salads, etc., add the vinegar and lemon juice just before using. It is important that the oil should be of best quality and kept in a cold place, also the sauce must be made in a cool placeâ€”set on ice if possible, as warmth makes it liable to curdle. If curdled, add another yolk at once, work it well in, then add oil as before in proportion to the added yolk. Tomato Sauce. 1 pint of tinned tomatoes. 1 bay leaf. Slice of onion. 1 clove of garlic. 1 teaspoonful butter. 1 teaspoonful potato flour. Salt and pepper. Cayenne and sugar. 1 teaspoonful vinegar. Method : Put the tomatoes, bay leaf, onion and garlic into a white-lined pan and set over gentle heat. When the flavouring of onion is sufficiently extracted, rub the tomatoes through a hair sieve and reheat. Mix the butter and potato flour smoothly together with a knife or spoon, and thicken the sauce with the mixture. Have

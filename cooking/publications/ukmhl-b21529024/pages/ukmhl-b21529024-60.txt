44 VEGETABLES. Boiled Potatoes. Boiled Without Skins.—Wash the potatoes, peel them very thinly, and again wash them well. Put into a saucepan, just cover with water, and boil very gently till tender. Add salt about 10 minutes before they are done. Drain away the water as perfectly as possible, and dry the potatoes by putting the pan near the fire and allow- ing the steam to escape. Shake the pan occasionally that they may become quite dry and floury. Serve very hot. Boiled in the Skins.—Wash and brush the potatoes carefully, put into a saucepan, just cover with water, and boil very gently till tender. Drain, remove the lid from the pan, and dry by the side of the fire. Boiled Carrots. Wash and scrape the carrots, then wash them again, if very large, cut them in half lengthways and across. Put into a saucepan of boiling water, cover the pan, and boil for about 1 hour. Add salt about 10 minutes before they are done. When quite tender, strain, chop finely, reheat, press into a hot mould, and turn out into a hot vegetable dish.

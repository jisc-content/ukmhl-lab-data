2 PRACTICAL COOKERY. BAKING. The time for baking meat is calculated in the same way as for roasting. Put the joint first into a hot oven, afterwards cook at a lower temperature till cooked through. Just at the last the heat should be increased that the surface may become crisp. Baked meat re- quires the same careful basting as roast. BOILING. In boiling meat the same rules must be followed as to time and weight as for roasting. Put fresh meat in boiling salted water, just sufficient to cover it; bring quickly to the boil. Boil for five minutes, then reduce the heat to simmering, i.e., about 180Â° Fah., for the remainder of the time. Skim well. Salt meat must be put into lukewarm water, or if extremely salt it may be put into cold, and the water may be changed. Calculate the time of cooking from when the water begins to boil. Salt meat requires rather longer cooking than the same meat would do if unsalted. Meat that has been dried as well as salted should always be put into cold water, brought slowly to boiling point, and kept carefully skimmed. Ham, corned beef, or any meats intended to be served cold, are best if allowed to remain in the water till cold. STEWING. The most important point in connection with stewing meat is the temperature. This should never be more

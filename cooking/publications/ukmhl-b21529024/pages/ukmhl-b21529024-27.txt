ii PUFF PASTRY. paste, which should be of the same consistency as the butter; if required, add a few drops more water. Work the paste lightly with the hand till smooth and pliable, flour the board and rolling pin and roll out into an oblong sheet about inch thick. If rice flour is used for dredging, it will be less likely to work into the paste than ordinary flour. Press the butter into an oblong cake not quite so long as the width of the paste, lay it across the middle and fold the two ends over till the edges are even. Turn the paste round, putting the folded edges to the sides and the loose edges to the top and bottom, press lightly with a rolling pin, then roll out to a long strip, keeping the edges even. Fold in three, turn and roll again. Repeat this process till the pastry has had about five turns, when, if the butter no longer shows in patches, the pastry may be used. Puff pastry should be set aside in a cool place for 10 or 15 minutes after every two rolls, in order to cool and harden the butter; and once or twice, before folding the strip, a few drops of lemon juice may be sprinkled over. After the last folding the pastry may be rolled in any direction which will best prepare it for the purpose required. For Patties.â€”Have the pastry \ inch thick, dip the cutter in flour and cut sharply. With a cutter several sizes smaller, cut the centre of the patty not quite through the paste. If for savouries brush over with egg before using the inner cutter. Bake in a hot oven about 15 minutes, keeping the oven door shut for at least the first 10 minutes.

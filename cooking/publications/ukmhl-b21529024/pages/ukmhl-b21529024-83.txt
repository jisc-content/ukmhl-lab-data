CREAMS, JELLIES, ETC. 67 warm place for 3 minutes, or till a crack in the scum shows clear liquid underneath. Pour some boiling water through a jelly bag, keeping the bag covered to retain the heat. As soon as the water is out, pour the jelly into the bag, having a clean, hot bowl underneath. When it begins to run clear, change the basin and pour the first flow of jelly back into the bag. Keep the bag covered and in a warm place. The jelly being stiff for garnishing will harden in the bag and waste if allowed to become cool. N.B.—Use more gelatine in warm weather. Moulding Jelly.— The mould must be metal; moulds such as delf are not suitable for lining. Use the jelly quite cold, at the point of setting. Be careful that every part of the mould is lined perfectly before any kind of garnish or decoration is put in. Set each decoration with a few drops of jelly —too great a quantity will float instead of setting it. The materials used should be quite dry, or the jelly may not stick to them. If ice cannot be obtained for setting the jelly use cold water and salt. See that no splash of water gets between the layers of jelly or they may separate when the mould is turned out. If ice is used do not allow the jelly to harden too much between the additions, as this also will cause the jelly to turn out in separate layers. To turn out.—Immerse for an instant in water as hot as the hand can bear. Wipe the mould and the jelly with a clean cloth before reversing the mould. Any water left about the jelly will collect on the dish and spoil the appearance when it is turned out.

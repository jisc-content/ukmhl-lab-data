PREFACE. The constant requests for a book of the recipes used in the Liverpool School of Cookery has led to the compilation of the present volume, which will be a practical companion to the excellent manual on the Principles of Cookery already issued by Miss E. E. Mann. The new volume will be found most valuable to young housekeepers, containing recipes most needed under all conditions and circumstances of everyday life. FANNY L. CALDER. Liverpool, 7th December, 1899.

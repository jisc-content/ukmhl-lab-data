PRACTICAL COOKERY. 88 Almond Icing. Blanch, dry, chop and pound the almonds; or, if liked, ground ones may be used with the addition of a few drops of almond essence. Take equal weight of almonds and sifted icing sugar, mix well, then moisten to a very stiff paste, using sugar-syrup, or beaten eggs. Either whites, yolks, or whole eggs may be used ; if whites only, they must be slightly beaten up, but not frothed. Work the paste till firm and close. Royal Icing. Pound the icing sugar, and put through a very fine wire sieve. Break up the white of egg slightly, but do not froth it. Mix the white of egg and icing sugar, beating well. A white of average size will generally be sufficient for about 5 oz. best icing sugar, but there is no need to measure or weigh. Beat well for about 20 minutes, adding sugar or white of egg to bring the icing to the right consistency when it will be soft and shining, but stiff enough to retain its shape when a little is dropped from the spoon. If not very well beaten, small, dry grains of sugar will prevent the smooth working of the icing. Add 3 or 4 drops of acetic acid to each | lb. of sugar. The acid helps to dry and harden the icing. A drop of blue may be added if necessary to improve the colour. When not actually in use, cover the basin con- taining royal icing with a clean, damp cloth. Soft Icing.

This method requires shorter time for cooking than the first method. Baked or Boiled Flour. Fill a cup or small basin quite full of flour, pressing it tightly down. Bake in a moderate oven 4 or 5 hours, or tie a clean cloth tightly over, and boil for the same length of time. Take the flour from the cup or basin, scrape off the discoloured outside part, and grate down finely the remainder. Use in the place of arrowroot or cornflour. Flour is more nourishing than arrowroot or cornflour, and prepared in this way will be found equally digestible. Useful in cases of dysentery.

23 POULTRY AND MEAT. brought across the back of the bird. Press the legs firmly downwards against the sides of the body. Pass a skewer between the folded bones of the wings, then through the point of the thigh, passing through the body and out at the corresponding points at the other side. If the bird is to be stuffed, put the stuffing into the breast, and to prevent any of it entering the body, turn back the small piece of neck so as to fill up the hole by the breast-bone, fold the skin over and fasten it to the back with a small skewer. Tie the legs together, then tie them to the tail, or they may instead be fastened with a skewer; in either case press the legs downwards so as to make the bird lie flat. The broken bone may be left on the legs until after cooking. Remove the thick skin from the inside of the gizzard, wash both gizzard and liver, and put them into the wings of the fowl. After trussing, slightly flour the bird, place on a dripping tin with plenty of dripping or butter for basting, and lay slit slices of fat bacon on the breast. Cook about 1 hour. A few minutes before dishing drift over with flour, baste and leave to brown. Serve with gravy, bacon rolls, and bread sauce (page 70). Note.—Chickens are not stuffed, but must be seasoned inside with salt and pepper. The liver and gizzard are not served with chickens. Almost all game is trussed for roasting in the way fowls are trussed, the exceptions being woodcock, snipe and plover, which are not drawn and have the heads left on. In trussing these birds press the legs to the sides, and pass the beak through the body and legs.

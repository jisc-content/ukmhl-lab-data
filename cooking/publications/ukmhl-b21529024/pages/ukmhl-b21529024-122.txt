io6 PRACTICAL COOKERY. Meat Lozenges. 1^ lb. lean, juicy steak. A piece of butter the size of a | oz. gelatine. Salt. nutmeg. Method : Remove all skin and fat, and cut the meat into small pieces. Put the meat into a pan, add the salt and butter, cover the pan and set by the fire to draw out the juices, taking care there is no appearance of frying. Every 10 minutes drain off the juice that comes from the meat. When all the juice is extracted measure it, and allow Â£ oz. gelatine to \ pint of liquid. Let the two soak together till the gelatine is quite soft (about 1 hour), then heat gradually, stirring all the time, till the gelatine is perfectly dissolved. Be careful not to boil the juice. Strain on to a wet plate, and, when set, cut into lozenges. Method 1 : Toast a slice of bread evenly to a nice brown, avoiding the least appearance of dark colour. Put into a jug, pour 1 pint boiling water over, cover closely till cold, then strain and use. Method 2 : Pour cold water over the toast, cover the jug, and, when the water is coloured like sherry, strain. Toast water made in this way will be found clearer than that made by the first method. Method : Wash the rice well in cold water and strain off. Boil with 1 pint water for 1 hour. Strain and flavour Toast Water. Rice Water. 1 oz. Carolina rice. 1 pint water. Flavouring.

VEGETABLES. 47 Asparagus. Scrape the white part of the stalks, beginning from the part near the head and scraping downwards. Cut away any very strong woody stalks, tie the aspara- crus in bundles, and trim the white stalks even. Put in boiling water to just cover. Boil gently till tender (20 to 30 minutes), having no lid on the pan. As soon as tender, remove at once from the water, and dish on a round of toast in a hot vegetable dish. Serve with clarified butter. Boiled Cauliflower. Soak the cauliflower in salt and water to draw out any insects. Trim it neatly. If very young, a little of the small, pale-green leaves next the flower may be left on, but if fully grown, remove all the leaves and as much of the hard stalk as possible. Split the stalk and put the cauliflower head downwards into a pan of boiling water, to which 1 dessertspoonful salt has been added. Boil 10 to 15 minutes for small cauliflowers, 20 to 25 minutes for large ones. Any scum that rises must at once be carefully removed. Boiled Cabbage. Take off all brown or faded leaves, remove the stalk, except what is needed to hold the leaves together. Cut entirely through the cabbage lengthwise, dividing it into halves or quarters according to size. Lay it in cold water with a little salt for about 1 hour, then put into plenty of boiling water and boil quickly with the lid off till quite tender (20 to 45 minutes). Add 1 dessertspoonful salt 10 minutes before it is finished, Drain in a colander,

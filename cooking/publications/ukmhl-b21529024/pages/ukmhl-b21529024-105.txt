To Mix Soft Icing.â€”Put sifted icing sugar into a brass'or enamel pan, add a little cold or lukewarm (but never hot) syrup. Heat gradually, beating well; add sugar or syrup as is necessary to bring the icing to the right consistency, when it will be thick enough to coat anything dipped in it, and yet thin enough to run smoothly, leaving no roughnesses on the surface. Never let the icing be made hot, but it must be warm at the time of using. If used too hot it will be brittle and easily chip off; if too cold it will be soft and sticky. Flavour all soft icings and colour if preferred. Im- mediately after icing cakes, put them for a moment near the fire or in a cool oven to set the surface. If allowed to get hot in the oven the icing will be spoiled.

PRACTICAL COOKERY. 58 meeting perfectly, but never overlapping in any part. After putting the souffle mixture into the prepared tin, lay a square of buttered paper over the top to prevent the dropping in of moisture from the lid. To Steam a Souffle.—Choose an iron pan, just large enough to allow the soufflb to be easily put in and taken out. Have a well-fitting lid ; if required, a piece of paper may be laid over the pan to make the lid fit more tightly. The boiling water must be about 1 inch deep, gently bubbling on one side of the pan, and the souffle must be set on the other side, with no heat directly underneath it. Do not lift the lid for the first 20 minutes. When firm to the touch in the centre the souffle is cooked and should be served at once. To turn out a Souffle.—Allow it to stand for a moment. Cut the string and remove the paper ; turn out on a hot plate, being careful the weight of the tin does not rest on the souffle or it will be crushed. Reverse the souffle on to a hot dish for serving and pour the sauce round it—never over. To Bake a Souffle.—Have the oven hot, but not extremely hot. Baked souffles are served in the dish in which they are cooked, therefore care must be taken to keep the dish spotless. Time for baking, 30 to 40 minutes, and for at least the first half of the time the oven must be kept closed. Method; Prepare the souffle tin (p, 57). Put the Yanilla Souffle. 1 oz. butter. 1 oz.

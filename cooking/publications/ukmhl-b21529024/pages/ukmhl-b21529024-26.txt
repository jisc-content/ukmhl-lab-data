IO PRACTICAL COOKERY. water very gradually, using a knife for mixing, and adding only just enough water to make a stiff paste. Flour the paste board and rolling pin, and roll out once only. If baking powder is used bake immediately. Flaky Crust. Mix the flour and salt in a bowl, rub in one-third of the shortening, using only the tips of the fingers. Then take a knife and mix in very gradually enough cold water to make a pasteâ€”stiff, but just a degree softer than that for short crust.

Turn the paste round so as to have the folded edge to one side, press lightly with the rolling pin, and roll out carefully in a straight oblong, again making the corners quite square. Fold in three, turn the rough edges towards you, and roll out again. Repeat till the paste has been folded and rolled five or six times. If time allows, flaky crust may with advantage be left for a time to cool between the rollings. Puff Pastry. J lb. best Vienna flour. About 4 tablespoonfuls water. J lb. fresh or washed butter. A few drops of lemon juice. Half a yolk. Method: Sift the flour, press the butter in a floured cloth to remove any moisture. Stir together the yolk, water and lemon juice, make a hole in the centre of the flour and add the liquid, mixing with a knife to an elastic

Whip the whites to the stiffest froth, mix them lightly but thoroughly with the yolks to a uniform colour, breaking up the froth as little as possible. Put the butter into an omelet pan, and when it is on the point of beginning to brown, put in the mixture at once. Stir lightly with a wooden spoon till it begins to set at the edges, then stir the middle only till it begins to set there. Let the omelet cook till the under side is nicely browned, using a knife to keep it loose from the pan. When the under side is cooked, brown the top with a gas griller, sala- mander, or in front of a clear fire. Slip the knife across the pan, under the omelet. Have ready a hot dish ; lay on it the omelet folded in half, the grilled top being on the outside of the fold. Lay the hot jam between the folds and serve at once. Note.â€”The pan used for omelets should be kept for that purpose only, and should not be washed. Clean thoroughly with paper and then with a clean cloth.

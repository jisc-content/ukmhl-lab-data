1 METHODS OP COOKING AND PREPARING FOOD. ROASTING. For roasting, a clear, hot fire is essential. Wipe the meat with a clean cloth. Unless meat has been exposed to dust it should never be washed, as washing wastes the juices. The hastener must be put before the fire to get hot before the meat is hung in it. Hang the joint so that its thickest part comes opposite the greatest heat. For red meats, as beef and mutton, allow 15 minutes to the pound and 15 minutes over for thin pieces, but for thick pieces 20 minutes to the pound and 20 minutes over. White meats, as veal and pork, require longer cooking. For these allow 20 minutes to the pound and 20 minutes over for thin pieces, and 25 minutes to the pound for thick. Place the meat at first about 6 inches from the fire; in about 10 minutes, when the surface is hardened, draw it back 2 or 3 inches. Baste the meat every 8 or 10 minutes and be care- ful that the roasting jack is not allowed to run down and so stop the constant turning of the meat. When roasting is done in a Dutch oven, the meat must be turned by hand from time to time.

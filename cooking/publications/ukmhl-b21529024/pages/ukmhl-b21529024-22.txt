PRACTICAL COOKERY. 6 necessary, add boiling water to make up for the waste by evaporation. Thin pieces of fish may be steamed between two plates set over boiling water. This is a better method than boiling small slices or fillets for an invalid. BRAISING. Put a layer of roughly cut-up vegetables—carrot, turnip and onion—in the bottom of a stewpan. Add a bouquet garni, and if a boned piece of meat is to be braised, put the bones also into the pan. Pour in water or second stock to just cover the bed of vegetables, lay in the meat, and cover with a tightly-fitting lid. Put on the pan and cook steadily. Slow boiling may be allowed if the meat is well raised out of the liquid. When the meat is cooked remove it from the pan and place on a dripping tin in a hot oven to crisp and brown the surface, while the liquid is reduced by fast boiling that it may be used for glaze, gravy or sauce making. Note.— Braising may also be done by placing the closely-covered stewpan in the oven instead of over the fire. This plan more nearly resembles the original French braising, where heat is applied not only underneath, but also to the top of the pan by means of hot coals laid on a lid specially constructed for this purpose.

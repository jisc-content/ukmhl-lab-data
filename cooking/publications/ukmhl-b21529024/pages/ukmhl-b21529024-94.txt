78 BREAD AND CAKES, ETC. Bread. 1 oz. yeast. 1 teaspoonful sugar. 1 teaspoonful flour. 3 small teaspoonfuls salt. About 1 h pints lukewarm water. 3 lb. flour. Mailiod : Test the yeast with sugar, flour and a little of the lukewarm water. Mix the flour and salt, make a hole in the centre, pour in the yeast, stir with a wooden spoon as if making a batter, adding the lukewarm water by degrees. When the water is all used, continue stirring till no more flour can be mixed in by the spoon, then lay the spoon aside and knead. Clear the sides of the bowl as soon as possible, and knead till the fingers do not stick. Turn the smooth side uppermost, cut across the top twice, cover the bowl with a thick warm cloth, and set where the air is warm till the dough has risen to about twice its original sizeâ€”1 to 2 hours. Divide into loaves, kneading very lightly, put into warmed, greased tins, or form into cottage loaves, etc., and set to rise in a warm place. The tins should be rather more than half filled, and the dough rise till level with the top before baking. Bake in a hot oven, keeping the door shut for at least the first 15 or 20 minutes for small loaves, longer for large ones. When a brown crust has been formed, the heat must be gradually reduced and the bread finished in a moderate oven. This quantity divided into 4 loaves will take about ^ hour to cook.

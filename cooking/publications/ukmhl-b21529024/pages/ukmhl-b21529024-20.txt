PRACTICAL COOKERY. 4 FRYING. Food must be prepared for frying by drying the surface as much as possible, and, in some cases, by also covering with a complete coating of egg or batter. Dry Frying.—This is done with a small quantity of fat, generally in a shallow frying-pan. Dry the articles to be fried. Egg and crumbs or batter may be used if desired. Have the fat hot before using. When cooked, remove all grease from the food with clean, soft paper. Wet Frying .—For this use an untinned iron stew- pan and sufficient fat to entirely cover whatever is to be fried. Meat or fish must invariably be coated with egg or batter or the bath of fat will be spoiled and the cooked food greasy. Potatoes, parsley, etc., need only thorough drying. Let the fat heat slowly, and be very hot before using. The right heat can be told by careful watching: as long as it bubbles like water it is too cold : when it becomes still and a pale blue vapour is seen rising from the surface, it is sufficiently hot. If heated till a brown smoke appears, the bath will be spoiled. Remember the fat must be kept hot while frying, therefore do not put in too many things at once, or the temperature will be too much reduced. Always reheat the fat before putting in more things to be fried. When a frying basket is used, it must be left for some minutes in the pan to get hot in the fat before anything is placed in it. Portions must be laid in the basket so as not to touch each other. Before serving remove all grease with clean, soft paper. Allow the fat to cool, and before it begins to solidify strain it through muslin laid in a strainer,

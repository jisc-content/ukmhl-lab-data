4o PRACTICAL COOKERY. crumbs and seasoning; then pass the whole through the machine direct into the skins. Twist into sausages and then into bundles, and keep in a cool, dry place. Potted Beef. 14 lb. rump steak. 6 oz. butter. 4 anchovies, scaled and boned. Salt and pepper. Cayenne. INface. Or a small teaspoonful anchovy essence. Method : Pasd the meat through a mincing machine, put into a jar with half the butter, cover closely, and set in an oven or in a pan of boiling water to cook for 1 hour. Add the seasonings and cook slowly for another hour. When quite tender, pound the meat in a mortar with the anchovies and put through a wire sieve. Reheat the meat, add the remainder of the butter, season if necessary, and while hot press into small moulds. Cover with clarified butter. Hash or Mince. Prepare the meat by removing every bit of gristle or of fat that will not be eaten. Cut into neat pieces for hash, or chop finely for mince. Put the bones and trimmings into a pan, cover with cold water, add flavouring, vege- tables, herbs and seasoning, and stew gently 1 hour or more. Strain the liquid, and take off any fat from the surface. Make gravy with this liquid, added to a little fried onion and browned flour, season with pepper and salt. The meat must be put into just warm—not hot— gravy ; allow it to heat very gradually, but it must not be brought to boiling point or the meat will harden. Hashed beef or mutton may be served with sippets of toasted bread, and flavoured and garnished with tomatoes.

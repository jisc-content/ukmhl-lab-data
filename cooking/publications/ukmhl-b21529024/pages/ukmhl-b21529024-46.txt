3o PRACTICAL COOKERY. Cdtelettes de Mouton a l’Alsace. 5 or G cutlets. Pepper and salt. Butter. Piece of onion. £ lb. lean veal. About half an egg. Browned crumbs. £ oz. butter. Dust of cayenne. Salt. Panard. Mashed Potatoes. 1 lb. potatoes. 1 oz. butter. 1 yolk. 4 pint water or stock. 1 teaspoonful butter. 1 oz. flour. (Tomato Sauce, p. 71) Method : Trim the cutlets and bat with a cutlet bat or wet knife. Sprinkle with pepper and salt, lay in a well-buttered saute-pan, and fry lightly on one side only for about 4 minutes. Rub the unfried side of each cutlet with a piece of onion and press the cutlets till cold. Shred the lean veal and pound it, add the panard (see below) and pound again, mix in the butter and seasonings and lastly the beaten egg. Be careful not to make the mixture too moist. Blend the whole thoroughly, and rub through a coarse wire sieve. When the cutlets are well pressed and quite cold, put a layer of the farce on the sides that were not fried, smooth the surface with a knife dipped in hot water, and sprinkle with fine browned crumbs. Place in a buttered baking tin, with a buttered paper over them, and cook in the oven about 15 minutes. Serve round a heap of mashed potatoes or other vegetables, and pour tomato sauce round the dish. To Make the Panard.—Put the water or stock into a small pan with the butter, when boiling, stir in the sifted flour, beat till smooth and cook well.

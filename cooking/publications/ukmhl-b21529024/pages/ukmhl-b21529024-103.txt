BREAD AND CAKES, ETC. 87 Meringues. Method : To each large white of egg allow 2 oz. sifted castor sugar. The whites must be beaten to a stiff froth, then begin to add the sugar by dipping in the whisk and continuing the beating. The last half of the sugar must be mixed in lightly with a wooden spoon. Shape the meringues with a bag and pipe, or with spoons. Have ready a wet board covered with paper, lay on the merin- gues, sift over with castor sugar to dry the surface, then put into a very cool oven. When firm enough to be handled, press in, or scoop out, the soft centres, and return to the oven to dry perfectly. Very little heat is required. Meringues may be dried quite white or baked a very pale colour, as preferred. Flavouring and colouring may be added if liked. / Eclairs. 2 oz. butter. j ^ lb. sifted flour. Nearly \ pint water. 1 4 small eggs. Method: Put the butter and water into a pan, when boiling, add the flour and stir over heat till the paste does not stick to the sides of the pan. Remove the pan from the fire and add the eggs, one at a time, beating the mixture well between each addition. It is possible that the fourth egg may not be needed, therefore, after the third, put in the egg very gradually so as to bring the paste to the right consistencyâ€”smooth, but stiff enough to retain its shape. Use a forcing bag and pipe, lay on slightly floured tins, Bake in a moderate oven 20 to 30 minutes,

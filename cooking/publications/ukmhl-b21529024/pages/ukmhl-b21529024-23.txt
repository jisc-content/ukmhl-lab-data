7 LARDING. Bacon for larding should be unsmoked and cured with- out saltpetre, as this turns white meats red. The fat only is used for larding, it should be firm and hard, that nearest the rind is best for the purpose. Cut the length of the lardoons in the direction of the grain of the bacon. The average length is lj to 2 inches, the width and thick- ness being about inch. Use a larding needle large enough to perfectly encase the end of the lardoon, any projecting bits will cause the bacon to break. As a rule the stitches are taken with the grain of meat, and across the grain of poultry and game, but in all cases the larding must be arranged to look neat. TO CLARIFY FAT. Cut up uncooked fat into pieces about \ inch square, taking from it all skin and sinew. Put into an iron pan, cover with cold water and bring to the boil, skimming well. Boil till most of the water has evaporated, then cook very gently, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking and burning. When the pieces look dried up and a golden brown and sink to the bottom of the melted fat, remove the pan from the fire. Allow the fat to cool, but before it begins to solidify strain through a very fine strainer or through muslin. Cooked fat is clarified in the same way, but should not be mixed with the uncooked.

PRACTICAL COOKERY. 46 French Beans. String the beans, cut into pieces lengthwise, put into boiling salted water, boil till tender (about 20 minutes). Drain them, put into a hot vegetable dish, sprinkle with pepper and salt, and serve with clarified butter. Green Peas. Shell the peas, put into boiling salted water, add about teaspoonful sugar to 1 quart water. Boil gently without a cover till tender (15 to 30 minutes, according to the age of the peas). Drain, put into a hot vegetable dish, add a small piece of butter, and season with pepper. A sprig of mint added to the water improves the flavour of peas. Spinach. Spinach needs special care in preparation and cleans- ing. Fold each leaf double and tear off the stalk with the rib down the back of the leaf. Put into a large bowl of cold water, and when all is prepared lift into another bowl of water. This should be repeated till no dust or grit is found in the water. Cook with the lid off till the leaves are tender (about 10 minutes). Strain through a colander and press dry, then either chop finely or pass through a wire sieve. Reheat with a little pepper, and butter or cream. Note.â€”If the spinach is old it must be put into plenty of boiling water ; if young and tender, lift it from the rinsing wrater and pack closely in the saucepan, the water in the spinach will be sufficient.

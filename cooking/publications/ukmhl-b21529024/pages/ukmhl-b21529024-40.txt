2 4 PRACTICAL COOKERY. dessertspoonful chopped parsley, \ oz. butter or chopped suet, pepper, salt and beaten egg for moistening. Gravy for Roast Fowl.—Make in the same way as for roast joint (page 8) with sediment from the dripping tin, stock and caramel, or water and Liebig’s Extract, as required. Season with pepper and salt. Make \ pint gravy, pour a little round the dish and serve the rest in a gravy boat. Bacon Rolls.—Cut the bacon very thin, trim all the edges, roll, put on a skewer, and cook in the oven or before the fire for about 5 minutes, or till slightly browned and crisped. Boiled Fowl. If possible, choose a white-legged fowl for boiling, and one that has not had the skin much torn by the poulterer. * To Truss a Fowl for Boiling: Break the legs between the foot and the first joint, draw the sinews, then cut off from the legs the pieces of broken bone. Pick the bird carefully, singe, wipe inside and out. Loosen the skin from the body and legs that the legs may be pushed up inside the skin of the body. Tie the legs together, then tie them to the tail, fold the skin over and fasten with a few stitches of white thread. Proceed to truss as for roast fowl, but instead of using skewers use a trussing needle and string. Rub over with lemon juice, tie in a buttered cloth and put into boiling water, breast down- wards. Simmer about 1 hour. N.B. Remember to remove all stitches before coating the fowl with white sauce.

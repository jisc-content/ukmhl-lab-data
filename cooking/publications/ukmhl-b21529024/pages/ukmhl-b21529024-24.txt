PRACTICAL COOKERY. 8 GRAVY FOR ROAST MEAT. To make gravy successfully from the brown sediment found in the dripping tin under roast meat, it is essential that the meat should have been well basted while cooking. After removing the joint, carefully pour off all the fat, add a little stock or water to the sediment, and with an iron spoon scrape off all the browned meat juices that adhere to the tin. Add stock or water to make up the required quantity. About | pint gravy will be needed for a small joint. If necessary, use a little caramel browning, and if water has been used instead of stock, a little Liebigâ€™s Extract may be added. Bring the gravy to the boil, season and strain. Pour a little round the joint, serve the rest in a gravy boat.

Before beginning to bone, wrench, then dislocate, the joints of the legs and wings where they join the body. Cut off the tips of the wings between the first and second joints, and break the bones of the legs a little higher than the first joint. Then with a small, sharp-pointed knife scrape the flesh from the merry-thought and neck bones and remove them. Proceed to bone the carcase, using either knife or fingers as is best for the purpose, being careful to keep the skin unbroken. When the wings and legs are reached, detach them, but do not bone them until after the carcase is removed. As the boning progresses, turn the flesh backwards on the bird till the whole is inside out. Bone the legs and wings, beginning at the joints next the body, turning them inside out as the boning goes on. The sinews of the leg must be taken out with the bone. Season lightly with salt and pepper, then turn the bird right side out, leaving the legs and wings inside the body.

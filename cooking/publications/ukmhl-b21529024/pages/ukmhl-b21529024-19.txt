3 BROILING—FRYING. than 170° Pah., and should only reach this point in very rare cases \ i.e., when the meat to be stewed is a com- paratively thick and solid piece. The centre of the meat must be brought up to 144° Fah. ; it therefore follows that the smaller the pieces the lower the temperature required. The “ simmering ” of a large joint of “ boiled ” meat may be 180° Fah., but the “simmering” of a stew should rarely be more than 155°. The time required for stewing depends chiefly on the quality of the meat, and varies from 2 to 4 or 5 hours. In every case the pan must be covered with a closely-fitting lid. BROILING. Have ready a clear, bright fire, the gridiron hot and well greased. If a gas griller is used, light the gas and get the ironwork very hot before beginning to cook. Harden the outside of the meat or fish as quickly as possible, so as to keep in all the juices. Hold one side towards the heat for 2 minutes, turn and cook the other side for 2 minutes. After this turn every minute till the cooking is completed. Broiled meat or fish should be served immediately it is cooked, and special care should be taken to have all dishes, plates, etc., very hot. When poultry or fish is split and laid open for broiling, the cut side must be first turned to the fire. Meat for broiling should be from 1 to 1| inches thick, and, if the fire is suitable, will take from 5 to 12 minutes. It is an improvement to brush over the surface with butter when broiling meat.

Egg and crumb and fry in a bath of fat. Method : Prepare the meat as for mince (see p. 40). Boil the potatoes, dry well, then rub through a wire sieve or pass through a potato masher. Add the butter, seasoning and egg, reserving a very little of the egg for brushing over the casserole. Have a plain mould well greased and lined with fine browned crumbs. Spread the potato smoothly over the bottom and sides of the mould, leaving a hollow to contain the meat, brush over with egg and bake in a quick oven till firm and brown at the edge. Turn the casserole on to a dish, then reverse it, fill with the prepared meat, and garnish. If veal is used, garnish with bacon rolls. Note.—The above quantities are sufficient for a mould of about 5£ inches in diameter and inches deep. A tin cake mould with a movable bottom is the most convenient for this purpose.

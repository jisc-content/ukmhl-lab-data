PASTRY. 195 meat very dry, and season it very high with pep- per, Jamaica pepper, nutmeg, and salt. Lay it in your dish, and to ten pounds put one pound or near of butter, spreading it over the meat. Put a crust round the edges and cover with a thick one, or it will be over-done before the meat be soaked; it must be done in a slow oven. Set the bones in a pan in the oven, with no more water than will cover them, and one glass of port, a little pepper and salt, that you may have a little rich gravy to add to the pasty when drawn. Note.—Sugar gives a greater shortness and better flavour to meats than salt, too great a quan- tity of which hardens—and it is quite as great a preservative. Potatoe pasty. Boil, peel, and mash potatoes as fine as possible; mi* them with salt, pepper, and a good bit of but- ter. Make a pa9te ; roll it out thin like a large puff, and put in the potatoe ; fold over one haif,. pinching the edges. Bake in a moderate oven. Cheap and excellent Custards. Boil three pints of new milk, with a bit of lemon peci, a bit of cinnamon, two or three bay-leaves, and sweeten it. Meanwhile rub down smooth a large spoonful of rice-flour iuto a cup of cold milk, and mix with it two yolks of eggs well beaten. Take a basin of the boiling milk, and mix with the cold, and then pour that to the boiling ; stirring it one way till it begins to thicken, and is just going to hoi! up ; and then pour it into a pan, stir it some time, add a large spoonful of peach-water, two tea. spoonfuls of brandy, or a little ratafia. Marbles boiled in custard, or any thing likely o burn, will, by shaking them in a saucepan, pre- vent it from catching.

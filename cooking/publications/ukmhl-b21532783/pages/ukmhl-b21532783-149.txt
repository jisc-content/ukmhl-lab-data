Egg and strew with crums, herbs, and seasoning ; fry them of the finest brown ; mash some potatoes with a little butter and cream, and put them into the middle ofthe dish raised high. Then place the edge of one steak on another with the small bone upward, all round the potatoes. Pies of the different meats are directed under tlie general head of savoury pies. PART ITT. POULTRY, GAME, Ac. To choose Poultry, Game, S.;c. A Turkey Cock.—If young, it has a smooh black leg, with a short spur. Thu eyes full and bright, if fresh, and the feet supple and moist. If stale, the eyes will be sunk, and the feet dry. Hen-turkey is known by the same rules ; but if old, her legs will be red and rough. Fowls.—If a cock is young, his spurs will be short; but. take ca:e to see they have not been cut or pared, which is a trick often practised. If fresh, the vent will be close and dark. Pullets are best just before they begin to lay, and yet are full of egg : if old hens, their combs and legs will be rough ; if young, they will be smooth. A good capon has a thick belly and a large- rump : there is a particular fat at his breast, and the comb is very pale. Black-legged fowls are most moist, if for roasting.

Simmer gently a quarter of an hour, and serve. GRAVIES. General directions respecting Grades. Gra^y may be made quite as good of the skirts of beef, and the kidney, as of any other meal pre- pared in the same way. An ox-kidnev, or milt makes good gravy, cut all to pieces, aud prepared as other meat; aud so will the shank-end of mutton that has been dressed, if much be not wanted. The shank-bones of mutton.a're a great improve- ment to the richness of gravy ; but first soak them well, and scour them clean. Tan-agon gives the flavour of French cookery, e:m1 in high gravies is a great improvement; but it should be added only a short time before serving.

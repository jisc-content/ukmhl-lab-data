In towns, poultry beingusuaily sold ready-picked the feathers, which may occasionally come in small â– quantities, are neglected ; but orders should be gi- ven to put them into a tub free from damp, and as they dry to change them into paper bags, a few in each ; they should hang in a dry kitchen to season; fresh ones must not be added to those in part dried, or they will occasion a mnstv smell, but they should go through the same process. In a few months they will he lit to add to beds, or to make pillows, without the usual mode ofdrying them iu a cool oven, which may be pursued if they are wanted before five or six months. Ducks Generally begin to lay in the month of February Their eggs should be daily taken away except one, till they seem inclined to sit; then ieave them, and see that there are enough. They require no attention while sitting, except to give them food at the time they come outtoseek it; and there should be water placed at a moderate distance from them, that their eggs may not be spoiled by their long ab- sence in seeking it. Twelve or thirteen eggs are enough; in an early season it is best to set them under a hen; and then they can be kept from wa- ter till they have a little strength to bear it, which in very cold weather they cannot do so well. They should be put under cover, especially in a wet season; for though water is the natural element of ducks, yet they are apt to be killed by the cramp before they are covered with feathers to deiead them.

DOMESTIC COOKERY. 91 Geese.—The bill and feet of a young one wMl be yellow, and there will be but few hairs upon them ; if old, they will be red ; if fresh, the feet will be pliable ; if stale, dry and stiff.

The wood-pigeon is large, and the flesh dark- coloured : if properly kept, and not over-roasted, the flavour is equal to teal. Serve with a good gravy. Plovers.—Choose those that feel hard at the vent, which shows they are fat. In other respects choose them by the same marks as other fowl. When stale, the feet are dry. They will keep sweet a long time. There are three sorts ; they gray, green, and bastard plover, or lapwing. Hare or Rabbit.—If the claws are blunt and rugged, the ears dry and tough, and the haunch thick, it is old; but if the claws are smooth and sharp, tbe ears easily tear, and the cleft in the lip

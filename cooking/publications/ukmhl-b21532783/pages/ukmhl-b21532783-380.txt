DOMESTIC COOKERY. 302 To hlaclcn the fronts of Stone Chimney-pieces. Mix oil-varnish with lamp-black, and a little spirit of turpentine to thin it to the consistence of paint. Wash the stone with soap and water very clean; then sponge it with clear water; and when perfectly dry, brush it over twice with this colour, letting it dry between the times. It looks extremely well. The lamp-bJack must be sifted first. To take Stairs out of Marble. Mix unslaked lime, in finest powder, with the stronger soap-lye, pretty thick ; and instantly, w itk a painter’s brush, lay it on the marble. In two month’s time wash it off pretty clean; then have ready a fine thick lather of soft soap, boiled in soft water; dip a brush in it, and scour the marble with powder, not as common cleaning. This will, by very good rubbing, give a beautiful polish. Clear oft the. soap, and finish with a smooth hard brush till the end be effected. To tal e Iron Stains out of Marble. An equal quantity of fresh spirit of vitriol and lemon-juice being mixed in a bottle, shake it well; wet the spots, and in a few minutes rub with soft lin *n till they disappear. To preserve Irons from rust. Melt fresh mutton-suet, smear over the iron with it while hot; then dust it well with unslaked lime pounded, and tied up in a muslin. Irons so pre- pared will keep many mouths. Vse no oil for them at an, time, except salad oil; there being water in all other. Fire-irons should be kept wrapt in baize, in a dry place when not used. Another way.—Beat into three pounds of un- salted hog’s lard,two drams of carnpho sliced ti.iu till it is dissolved, then take as much black-lead

SAUCES. 133 PART V. SAUCES, &c. A very good, Sauce, especially to hide the had colour of Fowls. Cat the livers, slices of lemon in dice, scalded parsley, and hard eggs : add salt, and mix them with butter; boil them up, and pour over the fowls. This will do for roast rabbit. White Sauce for Fricassee of Fowls, Rabbits, White Meat, Fish, or Vegetables. It is seldom necessary to buy meat for this fa- vourite sauce, as the proportion of that tlavour is bvt small. The water that has boiled fowls, veal, or rabbit; or a little broth, that may be in the house; or the feet and necks of chicken, or raw or dressed veal, will suffice. Stew with a little water any of these, with a bit of lemon-peel, some sliced onion, some white pepper-conis, a little pounded mace or nutmeg, and a bunch of sweet herbs, until the flavour be good ; then strain it, and add a little good cream, a piece of butter, and a little flour, salt to your taste. A squeeze of lemon may bead ded after the sauce is token off the fire, shaking it well. Yolk of egg is often used in fricassee, but. if yon have any creaxn it is better; and the fomi is apt to curdle. Sauce for Wild Find. , Simmer a tea-cupful of port wine, the same quantity of good meat grav a little shallot, a little pepper, salt, a grate of nutmeg, and a bit of mace, for ten minuti s : put in a bit ot butter, and flour, give it one boil, and poor it through the birds.

MEAT. 53 melted butter poured over it.â€”You may pot some of it. Knuckle of Veal. As few people are fond of boiled veal, it may be well to leave the knuckle small, and take of? some cutlets orcollops, before it be dressed; and as the knuckle will keep longer than the fillet, it is best not to cut off the slices till wanted. Break the bouesto make it take less room ; wash it well; and put it into a saucepan with three onions, a blade of mace or two, and a few pepper-corns cover it with water, and simmer it till quite ready. In the mean time some macaroni should be boiled with it if approved, or rice, or a little rice flour, to give it a small degree of thickness: but do not put too much. Before it is served, add half a pint of milk and cream, and let it come up either with or withont the meat. Or fry the knuckle with sliced onion and butter to a good brown ; and have ready, peas, lettuce, onion, and a cucumber or two, stewed in a small quantity of water, an hour; then add these to the veal; and stew it till the meat is tender enough to eat, but not overdone. Throw in pepper, salt, and a bit of shred mint, and serve all together. Shoulder of Veal. Cutoff the knuckle, for a stew or gravy. Roast the other part for stuffing ; you may lard it. Serve with melted butter. The blade-boue, with a good deal of meat left on, eats extremely well witli mushroom or oyster- tauce, or mushroom-ketchup in butter. Neck of Veal. CutolTthe scrag to boil, and cover it with onion sauce. It should be boiled in milk and water.

MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS, FOR THE USB OP THE MISTRESS OF A FAMILY. In every rank, those deserve the greatest praise, who best aoiuitth mselvcs of the duties which their station requires. Iildeed, this line of conduct is uc.r a matter of choice hut of necessity, if we would maintain the dignity of ourchar- acter as rational beings. In the variety of fee.ale acquirements, though domestic occupations «; md not so high in esteem ns they formerly did, yet when neglected, they produce much human mis', ery There vis a time when ladies knew nothing •y/n'l theirown fatuiiy concerns.: but in the present day there are many who know nothing about them. Each of these extreme's should be avoided : hut is there no way to uni'e in the female character, cultivation of talents and habits of usefulness I Happily there are still great numbers in every situation, whose example proves that this is possible. Instances may he found of ladies in the higher walks of life, who condescend to examine the accounts of their house-steward ; and, by overlooking and wisely directing the expenditure of that part of their husband's income which falls under their own inspection, avoid the in'on- veniences of embarrassed circumstances. How much more necessary, then, is domestic knowledge in those whose limited fortunes press on their attention considerations of the strictest economy 1 There ought to be a material differ- ence in the degree of care which a person of a large and independent estate bestow son money-concerns and that of a person of confined circumstances : yet both may very commendably employ some portion of their time and thoughts on this subject. The custom of the times tends in some measure to abolish the distinctions of rank ; and the education given to young people is nearly the same in all ; blit though the leisure of the higher may be well de- voted to different accomplishments, the pursuits of those in a middle line, if less ornamental, would better secure their own happiness and that of others connected with them. We sometimes bring np children in a manner calculated rather to fit them for the station we wish, than that which it i:s likely they will actually possess ; and it is in all cases worth the while of parents' to consider whe- ther the expectation or hope of raising their offspiDg above their own situation be well founded.

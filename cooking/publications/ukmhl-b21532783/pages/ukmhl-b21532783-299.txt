SWE-ET DISHES. 243 a fine flavour. V good deal of pursley should be used. Ramakins and omlet, though usually oerved in the course, would be much better if they were sent up after, that they might be eaten as hot as possible. Butter to servo as a little Dish. Roll butter in different forms ; either like a pine, and make the marks with a tea-spoon ; or roll it in crimping rollers, work it through a colander, or scoop with a tea-spoon, and mis with grated ueef, tongue, or anchovies. Make a wreath of curled parsley to garnish. Ramakins. Scrape a quarter of a pound of Cheshire, and ditto of Gloucester cheese, ditto of good fresh but- ter ; then bent all in a mortar with the yolks of four eggs, and the inside of a 3mall French roll boiled iu cream till soft; mix the paste then with the whites of the eggs previously beaten, and put into small paper pans made rather long than square, and bake in a Dutch oven till of a fine brown. They should be eaten quite hot. Some like the ad- dition of a glass of white wine. The batter for ramakins is equally good over macaroni when boiled tender ; or on stewed broc- coli, celery, or cauiifiower, a little of the gravy they have been stewed iu being putin the dish with them, but not enough to make the vegetables swim. Poitid Cheese. Cut and pound four ounces of Cheshire cheese, on ounce and a half of fine butter, a tea-spooufol of v. bite pounded sugar, a little bit of mace, ami a glass of white wine. Press it down in a deep pot.

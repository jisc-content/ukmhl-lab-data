Some are best eaten when cold, and in that case, there should be nosuet put into the forcemeat that is used with them. If the pie is either made of meat that will take more dressing, to make it ex- tremely tender, than the baking of the crust will allow; or if it is to be served in an earthen pie form : observe the following preparation: Take three pounds of the veiny piece of beef (for instance) that has fat and lean ; wash it; and season it with salt, pepper, mace, and allspice, in fine powder: rubbing them well in. Set. it. by the side of a slow fire, in a stew-pot that will just hold it; put to it a piece'of butter, about tiie weight of two ounces, and cover it quite close ; let it just simmer in its own steam till it begins to shrink. When it is cold, add more seasoning, forcemeat, and eggs: and if it is iu a dish, put some gravy to it before baking; but if it is only in crust, do not put the gravy till alter it is cold, and injelly, ashasbeeu describediupagesl31.andl32.

107 SAM K. Â«AHK, &C. To keep Game, SjC. Game ought not to be thrown away eren when it ha9 been kept a very long time ; for when it seems to be spoiled, it may often be made dt for eating, by nicely cleaning it, and washing with vinegar and water. If there is danger of birds not keeping, draw, crop, and pick them ; then wash in two or three waters, and rub them with salt. Have ready a large saucepan on' boiling water, and plunge them into it one by one ; drawing them up and down by the legs, that the water may pass through them. Let them stay five or six minutes in; then hang them up in a cold place. When drained, pepper and salt the inside3 well. Before roasting, wash them well. The most delicate birds, even grouse, may be preserved thus. Those that live by suction cannot be done this way, as they are uever drawn; and perhaps the heat might make them worse, as the water could not pass through them ; but they bear being high. Lumps of charcoal put about birds and meat will preserve them from taint, and restore what is spoiling. Pheasants and Partridges. Roast them as Turkey; and serve with a fine gravy (into which put a very small bit of garlick), and bread-sauce. When cold, they may be made into excellent patties, but their flavour should net be overpowered by lemon. For the manner of trussing a pheasant or partridge, see plate IX. To pot Partridge. Clean them nicely ; and season with mace, all - spice, white pepper, and salt, in tine powder. Rub

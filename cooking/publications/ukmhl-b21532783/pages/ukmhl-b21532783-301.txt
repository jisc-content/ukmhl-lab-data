SWEET DISHES. ^45 To poach Eggs. Set a stew-pan of water on the fire : when boil- ing, slip an egg, previously broken into a cup, into the water; when the white looks done enough, slide an egg-slice under the egg, and lay it on toast and butter, or spinach. As 3oon as enough tire done, serve hot. If not fresh-laid, the will not poach well, and without breaking. Trim the rag- ged parts of the whites, and make them look round. Buttered Eggs. Beat four or five eggs, yolk and white together, put a quarter of a pound of butter in a basin, and then put that in boiling water ; stir it till melted, then pour that butter and the eggs into a saucepan ; keep a basin in your hand, just hold the saucepan in '.he other over a slow part of the fire, shaking it one way, as it begins to warm ; pour it into a basin and back, then hold it again over the fire, stirring it constantly in the saucepan, and pouring it into the basdi, more perfectly to mix the egg and but- ter, until they shall be hot without boiling. Serve on toasted bread; or in a basin, to eat with salt fish, or red herrings. Scotch Eggs.

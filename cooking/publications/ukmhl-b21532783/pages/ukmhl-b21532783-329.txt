There are two modes of breaking the curd ; and there will be a difference in the taste of tire cheese, according as either is obser- ved; one is, to gather it with the hands very gently towards the side of the tub, letting the whey pass through the fingers till it is cleared, and lading it ott as it collects. The other is, to get the whey from it by early breaking the curd : the last method de- prives it of many of its oily particles, and it therefore less proper, lâ€™ut the vat on a ladder over the tub, and till it with curd by the skimmer : press the curd close With your hand, and add more as it sinks ; and it must be finally left two inches above the edge. Before the vat is filled, the cheese-cloth must be laid at the bottom ; and when full drawn smooth over on all sides.

The first method appears the best on some accounts, but not <m all, and therefore the cu stom of the country must direct. Put a board under and over the vat, and place it in the press: in two hoars turn it out, and put a fresii cheese-cloth ; press it again for eight or nine hours; then salt it all over, and turn it again in the vat, and let it stand in thfc press four- teen or sixteen hours ; observing to put the cheeses last made undermost. Before putting them the last time into the vat, pare the edges if they do not look smooth. The vat should have holes at the sides and at bottom to let all the whey pass through. Put on clean boards, and change and scald them. To preserve Cheese sound. Wash in warm whey, when you have any, and

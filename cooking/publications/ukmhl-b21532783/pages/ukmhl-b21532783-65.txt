Drain and boil quick the liquor, aud put on when cold. Serve with fennel. It is an elegaut dish, and extremely good. COD. Some people boil the cod whole; but a large head and shoulders contain all the fish that is proper to help, the thinner parts being overdone aud tasteless before the thick are ready. I’ut the whole fish may be purchased at times more reasonably ; and the lower half, if sprinkled and hung up, vv ill be in high perfection me or two days. Or it may bo made salter, and served with egg- gance, potatoes, and parsneps. Cod when small is usually very cheap. If boiled quite fresh it. is watery: but eats excellently if salted and lintig up for a day, to give it firmness, then stuffed, aud broiled, or boiled. Cod’s Head and Shoulders.

DOMESTIC COOKERY. 172 Steak or Kidney Pudding. If kidney, split and soak it, and season that or the meat. Make a paste of suet, flour, and milk ; roll it, and line a basin with some; put the kidney or steaks in, cover with paste, and pinch round the edge. Cover with a cloth, and boil a considerable time. Beefsteak Pudding. Prepare some fine steaks as in page 42 ; roll them with fat between ; and if you approve shred onion,. add a very little. Lay a paste of suet in a basin, I and put in the rollers of steaks ; cover the basin, with a paste, and pinch the edges to keep the gravy in. Cover with a cloth tied close ; and let the pudding boil slowly, but for a length of time. Baked Beef-steak Pudding. Make a batter of milk, two eggs, and flour, or which is much better, potatoes boiled and mashed through a colander: lay a little of it at the bottom of the dish ; theu put in the steaks prepared as above, and very well seasoned : pour the remainder of tlie batter over them, and bake it. Mutton Pudding. Season with salt, pepper, and a bit of onion ; lay one layer of steaks at the bottom of the dish ; and pour a batter of potatoes boiled and pressed through a colander, and mixed with milk and an egg, over them; then putting the rest of the steaks, and batter, bake it. Batter with flour, instead of potatoes, eats well, j but requires more egg, and is not so good. Another.—Cut slices off a leg that has been underdone, and put them into a basin lined with a fine suet crust. Season with pepper, salt, and finely shred onion or shallot.

40 DOMESTIC COOKERY. Garnish with carrots, turnips, or truffles and morels, or pickles of different colours, cut small and laid in little heaps separate; chopped parsley,, chives, beetroot, &c. If, when done, the gravy is â–  too much to till the dish, take only a part to season for serving, but the less water the better ; and to increase the richness, add a few beef bones and I shanks of mutton in stewing. A spoonful or two of made mustard is a great improvement to the gravy. llump roasted is excellent: but in the country it is generally sold whole with the edgebone, or cut across, instead of lengthwise as in London,, where one piece is for boiling, and the rump for stewing or roasting. This must be attended to, the whole being too large to dress together. Stewed Rump another way. Half roast it: then put it into a large pot with three pints of water, one of small beer, one of port wine, some salt, three or four spoonfuls of vinegar, two of ketchup, a bunch of sweet herbs of various kinds, (such as burnet, tan agon, parsley, thyme,, basil, savoury, penny-roy* (, marjoram, knotted 1 marjoram, and a leaf or twi of sage), some onions, cloves, and Cayenne ; cover it close, and simmer till quite tender; two or three hours will do it. When done, lay it into a deep dish, set it over hot water, and cover it close.. Skim the gravy, put in a few pickled mushrooms, truffles, morels, and oysters, if agreeable, but it is very good w'th- out; thicken the gravy with flour and butter, and heat it with the above, and pour over the beef. Forcemeat balls of veal, anchovies, bacon, suet, herbs, spice, bread, and eggs, to bind, are a great improvement.

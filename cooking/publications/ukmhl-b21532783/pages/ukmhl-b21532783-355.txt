337 SICK COOKERY. Saco Mitt. Cleanse as above, and boil it slowly, and wholly with new milk. It swells so much, that a small quantity will be sufficient foraquart, and when done it will be diminished to about a pint. It requires no sugaror flavouring. Agues' Milk. Far surpasses any imitation of it that can be made. It should be milked into a glass that is kept warm by being in a basin of hot water. The fixed air that it contains gives some people a pain in the stomach. At first a tea-spoonful of rum may be taken with it, but should only be put in the moment it is to be swallowed. Artificial Asses' Mitt. Boil together a quart of water, a quart of new m lk, an ounce of white sugar-eandv, half an ounce oi eringoroot, and half an ounce of conserve of roses, till half be wasted. This is astringent; therefore proportion the doses to the effect, and the quantity to what will be used while sweet. Another.—Mix two spoonfuls of boiling water, two of milk, and an egg well beaten; sweeten with pounded white sugar-candy. This may be taken twice or thrice a day.

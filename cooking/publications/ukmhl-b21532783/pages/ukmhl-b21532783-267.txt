VEGETABLES. 211 Parsley should be cut close to the stalks; arul dnei! in a warm room, or on tins in a very cool oven: it preserves its flavour and colour, and is very useful in winter. Artichoke-bottoms, slowly dried, should be kept in paper bass; and Truffles, Morels, Lemon- peel, &c. in a dry place ticketed. Small close Cab bag t:s, laid on a stone floor before the frost sets in, will blanch and be very tine, after many weeks’ keeping. PICKLES. Rn/es to be observed with Pickles. Keep them closely covered ; and have a wooden spo.ui, with holes, tied to each jar: all metal being improper. They should be well kept from the air; the large jars be seldom opened ; and small ones, for the different pickles in use, should be kept for common supply, into which what is not eaten may be returned, and the top closely covered. Acids dissolve the lead that is in the tinning of saucepans. When necessary to boil vinegar, do it in a stone jar, on the hot hearth. Pickles should never be put into glazed jars, as salt and vinegar penetrate the glaze, which is poisonous. Lemon Pickle. Wipe six lemons, cut each into eight pieces; put on them a pound of salt, six large cloves of garlick, two ounces of horse-radish sliced thin, likewise of cloves, mace, nutmeg, and Cayenne, a quarter of an ounce each, and two ounces of flour of mustard; to these put two quarts of vinegar. Boil a quarter of an hour in a well-tinued saucepan; or, which is be ter, do it in a strong jar, in a kettle of boiling water , or set the jar on the hearth till done. Set the ja’- by, and stir it daily for six wpeks ; keep the jar close covered. Put it into small bottles.

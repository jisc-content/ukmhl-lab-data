DOMESTIC COOKKRY. 96 minutes; a goose, an hour; wild ducks a quarter of an hour ; pheasants, twenty minutes; a small turkey stuffed, an hour and a quarter; turkey- poults, twenty minutes ; grouse, a quarter of an hour ; quails, ten minutes; and partridges, from twenty to twenty-five minutes. A hare will take near an hour, and the hind part requires most he; f. Pigs and geese require a brisk fire, and quick turning. Hares and rabbits must be well attended ton ; and the extremities brought to the quick part of die. fire, to be done equally with the backs. . POULTRY. To boil Turkey. Make a stuffing of bread, herbs, salt, pepper, nutraet, lemon-peel, a few oysters or an anchovy, a bit of butter, some suet, and an egg: put this into the crop, fasten up the skin, and boil the tur- key in a floured cloth to make it very white. Ha' e ready a fine oyster-sauce made rich with butter, a little cream, and a spoonful of soy, if approve is and pour it over the bird or liver and lemon-sauce. Hen-birds are best for boiling, and should be young. To roast Turkey. The sinews of the. leg should be drawn, which- ever way it is dressed. The head should be twisted under the wing ; and in drawing it, take care not to tear the liver, nor let the gall touch it. Put a stuffing of sausage-meat; or if sausages are to be served in the dish, a bread-stufling. As this makes a large addition to the size of the bird, observe that the heat of the fire is constantly to that part; for the breast is often not done enough. A little strip of paper should be put on the bone, to hinder it from scorching while the other pa-ls roast. Baste well and froth it up. Serve with gravy in

3 FISH. come in about midsummer, and are to be had for five or six months. Eels,—There is a greater difference in the good- ness of eels than of any other fish. The true silver- eels (so called from the bright colour of the belly) is caught in the Thames. The Dutch ells sold at Bill instate are very bad; those taken in great floods are generally good, but in ponds they have usually a strong rank flavour. Except the middle of summer they are always in season. Lobsters.—If they have not been long taken, the claws will have a strong motion when you put your fingers on the eyes and press them. The heaviest are the best, and it is preferable to boil them at home. When you buy them ready-boiled, try whether their tails are stiff, and pull up with a spring; otherwise that part will be flabby. The cock-lobster is known by the narrow back part of his tail, and the two uppermost fins within it are stiff and hard ; but those of the hen are soft, and the tail broader. The male, though generally smaller, has the higest flavour, the flesh is firmer, and the colour when boiled is a deeper red. Crabs.—The heaviest are best, and those of a middling size are sweetest. If light they are watery: when in perfection the joints of the legs ar'- stiff, and the body has a very agreeable smell. The eves look dead and loose when stale. Prawn anu Shrimps.—When fresh they have a sweet flavour, are firm and still', anil the colour is bright.—Shrimps are of the prawn kind, and may be judged by the same rules. Oystep.s.- -Thereare several kinds; the Pyfleet, Colchester, and Milford, are much the best. The native Milton are fine, being white and fat; but others may bo made to possess both these qualities in some di ree by proper feeding. When alive

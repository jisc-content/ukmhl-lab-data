We may live without poetry, music, and art; We may live without conscience, and live without heart; But civilized man cannot live without cooks. We may live without hooks, — what is knowledge but grieving? We may live without hope, — what is hope but deceiving? We may live without love, — what is passion but pining? But where is the man that can live without dinins? We may live without friends ; we may live without books ; Owen Meredith.

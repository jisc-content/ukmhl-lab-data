PRACTICAL GASTRONOMY 472 Before cutting up a wild duck, slice the breast, and pour over the gashes a few spoonfuls of sauce, composed of port wine or claret (warmed), lemon-juice, salt, and cayenne pepper. The most delicate parts of a calf’s head are the bits under the ears, next the eyes, and the side next the cheek. If cray-fish be added to a fricasseed chicken (as in France), one of the fish should be placed on the top, in dishing, and served to the first guest. TRANSLATING THE MENU. Erastus Gurley, a noted wag, one day dropped into a cafe for dinner. The obsequious waiter bad just flicked a bit of lint from his customer’s coat collar when Mr. Gurley opened out on him. “Yes,” he said, glancing at the menu, “you may bring me some eggs blushing like Aurora.” “Beg pardon, sir,” explained the waiter, “it’s not on the bill.” “ Isn’t, eh ? What’s this, anifs a I'aurore 1 ” “ Oh, yes,” replied the young man, blushing and shifting somewhat uneasily. “And I feel like having some breeches in the royal fashion," with velvet sauce.” The waiter turned red, white, and blue. “ Got you again,” chuckled Mr. Gurley. “ Well, I suppose you call it culottes a la roijalc, sauce rcloute.'’' “ Oh, that I Yes, sir ; yes, sir; ” and the waiter briskly rattled the cutlery around the plate as though he would fain drown Mr. Gurley’s voice. “ Be sure you bring a stew of good Christians.” “ Now you are joking,” mildly expostulated the waiter, with a sickly smile. “ Not a bit of it, man. See here on your bill. Com2)ote de ho7is Chretiens." “ O—ah—ugh,” gulped the waiter. “ And a mouthful of ladies.” “ Eh ? ” “ BoucMe de dames—(\\x\ck, help—a glass of water—dash it in his face ! ” But Mr. Gurley was too late. The waiter was in a dead swoon, from which he never recovered until later in the afternoon.

69 HIGH CLASS AND DOMESTIC COOKERY Rii appetising dinner and an amiable frame of mind. Good cooking loo is necessary for the preservation of health. However plain the food may be, it must be treated properly, or it will fail to nourish and be productive of that dread disease, indigestion. There are rules and reason for everything done in cooking as much as in any other art, and upon the observance of these rules depends success. Sameness is one of the least serious charges to be brought against the cookingof an ordinary middle-class family, though greater variety would be more agreea- ble; there are generally worse evils — bad cooking and serving up indigestible and wasteful dishes. The greater efficiency of man cooks has been attributed, and certainlv not without reason, to the better know- ledge of the method : much more than women they work by rule; they rely on the cluck, the scales, and carefully tested recipes. It is not always profound knowledge that is necessary ; great care, moi'e deli- beration, and better method, would, in many house- holds, effect a marvellous transformation. A good cook does not entii’ely depend on book and rule ; a certain natural aptitude is necessary, though know- ledge acquired from teachers and books on cookery is most invaluable. It would be useless to expect to educate every wo- man to be a skilful cook; nor is it necessai’y that all women should be first-rate cooks ; but every woman should and could if disposed, be able to pi'epare tlie plainer ailicles of food, so that they are palatable.

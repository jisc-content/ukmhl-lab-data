73 NOTES ON BOILING its use as food. When it Is introduced into the boiling water, the albumen immediately coagulates from the surface inwards, and in this state forms a crust, which no longer permits the external water to pene- trate into the interior of the mass of flesh. But the temperature is gradually transmitted to the interior and there effects the conversion of the raw flesh into the state of boiled. The flesh retains its juiciness, and is quite as agi'eeable to the taste as it can be made by roasting. When the temperature of the in- terior of a piece of meat has not reached 144 deg. it presents a blood-coloured or underdone appearance. The principle of both boiling and roasting is the same — to endeavour as quickly as possible to sur- round the joint with a hard film of meat, in order to keep the flavour in, not to dissolve it out with a cold- water bath. Gold water extracts from the meat two most important elements of the gastric juice — lactic and phosphoric acids. In boiling meat, however, a certain proportion of the nutritious qualities are sure to escape into the water and steam, for winch reason the quantity of water should not be more than suffices to cover the meat, nor the saucepan an inch larger than it must needs be to hold it. Boiled too long or too fast, meat becomes indigestible and hard. Hard water is better than soft water for boiling meat in, more of its ten- derness and richness being retained in the former than in the latter. Too rapid boiling tends to overdo the exterior portion of the meat, while the interior

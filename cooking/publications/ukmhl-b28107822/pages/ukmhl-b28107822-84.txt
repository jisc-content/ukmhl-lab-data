72 PRACTICAL GASTRONOMY Mrs. Glasse is often referred to as the most old-fas- hioned and unscientific of cooks, but she at any rate steered clear of this blunder; whereas Murray says, (( All meat for boiling should be first entirely covered with cold water. » One of the best authorities says, (( If the flesh be introduced into the boiler when the water is in a state of brisk ebullition, and if the boi- ling be kept up for a few minutes and the pot then placed in a warm place, so that tlie tempera- ture of the water is kept at i58deg. to i65deg., we have the united conditions for giving to the flesh the qualities which fit it for being eaten. If you wish to rob meat of its most nourishing and wholesome properties, put it in cold water, which receives them, leaving the meat quite unfit foi' eating, even if it does make the water a foundation for soup — that is, stock ! But if you want « stock, » it can be made with cheaper material than joints of meat intended for the table. When meat is eaten, the albumen should be retai- ned in it, for not only does it preserve the fibrin from becoming hard, but it gives to it softness and delicacy. The influence of boiling water upon albu- men is well known. The best method of boiling meat intended for food is to introduce it into boiling water; if the boiling be kept up for five minutes, and then so much cold water be added as to reduce the tempe- rature to 165deg., and the whole retained at this tem- perature long enough, all the conditions are united which give to the flesh the quality best adapted for

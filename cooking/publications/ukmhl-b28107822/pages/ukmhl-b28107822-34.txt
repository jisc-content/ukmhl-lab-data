PRACTICAL GASTRONOMY 126 Who sliall say what stupendous issues in the world’s histoi'v have not turned upon good or bad cookery? It has always been a reproach to the En- glish, that they are behind the rest of the civilisid world in respect of cookeiy. A witty Frenchman, once spoke of the English, as « a nation wdth fifty reli- gions, and one sauce. » I do not think they are as bad as that, and if there is still some reproach clinging lo their nation in this respect, it is proved and ad- mitted by competent judges that a first-rate din- ner in England is, beyond all comparison, better than a dinner of the same class in any other country; for the following simple reason, that English gold can buy the best cooks, just as it can purchase the best singers. The greatest Guisinier of his day, L. E. Ude, wrote as follows : «I will venture to affirm that cooking in England, Avhen well done, is superior to that of any other country of the world. » There is certainly nothing in the French cookery,lo equal an English baron of beef, their noble Sirloins, nor their haunches, legs, saddles and loins of South- down mutton. The principle articles of food, in the •(|uality of which the French surpass the English, are poultry and veal, but such is the skill and science of their cooks, that with worse mutton, worse beef and worse lamb than the English, they produce better made dishes of every kind.

EATING AND DRINKING OF THE TURKS 59 liealtlit'ul and nutritious food, wliicli Europeans find delicious. Turkisli pastry is quite varied, and would not be disagreeable if lioney and sugar were not used so abundantlv, audit' the taste of tallow could be excluded. Bakalava and cftmrA:/»Tda//'(thick cakes in honey, perfumed with rose water and covered with caimak, a kind of cream) in particular, recall very savory memories. Pachas and rich Turks always have at their repast a great number of dishes, Avhich the servants hi'ing in on brass platters, and place on the mat on the flooi' or sometimes on small low tables, around W'hich the guests squat themselves. They eat in a grave manner, and serve themselves generally with their fingei’s as well as with forks, and with their teeth as well as with their knives. Nevertheless, they deign to use a spoon to convey to their mouths food that is not very solid, like stexved rice, malebij^ a kind of cooked cream, and iaourt, thick and bitterish milk, all of which they are very fond of. Their drink consists of clear water; but this does not prevent tliem from imbibing before their repast a white li- quor, raki^ which is made of the gum of the mastic- tree mixed with alcohol. It is an agreeable drink, hut it is used like absinthe, the taste and properties of wliich it possesses. Its use, and even its abuse, does not bring remorse to the conscience of the Turks, for Mohammed lias forbidden them to use wine, hut he forgot, prophet though he was, to foresee the manufac- ture of raki,an invention more modern that his own. 4

2 Sumptuous Feasts of olden Times All old cook gives the following as the ordinary bill of fare for a gentleman’s table about Candlemas.

Still earlier (1470), at a tremendous banquet given by the Earl of War- wick to George Nevile, his brother, upon his being raised to the dignity of Archbishop of York, the pro- visions are on a truly Gargantuan scale. This is the authentic list of material used on the occasion : 300 quarters of wheat 300 ton of ale 104 ton of wine 1 ton of spic’d ale 10 fat oxen 6 wild bul’s 300 pigs 1,004 wethers 400 hernsies 200 pheasants 500 pertridges 4.000 woodcocks 400 plovers 100 curlews 100 quails 1.000 eggets

Successful frying, in short, de- mands both skill and knowledge, and in proportion to their exersice and degree wall be the reputation of both frying and the fry. « The art of frying, » says Sir Henry Thompson, « is little understood, and the omelet is almost entirely neglected by our country- men. The products of our frying-pan are often greasy, and therefore for many persons indigestible, the shal- low form of the pan being unsuited for the process of lioiling in oil, that is, at the heat of nearly 500deg.

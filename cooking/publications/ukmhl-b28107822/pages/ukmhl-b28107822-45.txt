37 THE COOK AND THE KITCHEN One of the great triumplis of the ancient cooks, was to serve up a whole pig, boiled on one side and roasted on the other. The guests tried in vain to de- tect the place where the knife had separated the animal, or how it was contrived to stuff it with an oho, composed of thrushes and other birds, slices of sow, hens, and highly spiced minced meat, the whole flavoured with a rich juice or sauce. Tliese old cooks could with a vegetable counterfeit the taste of fish or flesh. It is reported, that in an expedition against the Scvthians in the winter and at a e^reat distance from the sea, the King of Bithynia had a violent longing for a pilchard. His cook cut a turnip in exact imita- tion of its shape, then fried it in oil, salted and well powdered it with the grains of a dozen black poppies, and his Majesty’s taste was so exquisitely deceived, that he praised the roots to Ids guests as an excellent fish. This seeming transmutation of vegetables into fish is a great art, but in these days it appears to have gone out of pi'actice ; it might with advantage be re- vived especially in countries where much cheap and wholesome food is lost or wasted, because an ade- quate knowledge of cookery is Avanting. The ancient cooks sent almost to the ends of the earth for choice viands, which were not obtainable at liome. Those of Atliens, for instance, procured from England their oystei-s, of which the finest camefi'om the neighbourhood of Sandwich. « Juvenal »

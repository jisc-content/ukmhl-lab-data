606 PRACTICAL GASTRONOMY “LE CORDON BLEU.” Le Cordon bleu, or the blue ribbon, denotes a culinary badge of honour, known in France as the highest gastronomic order of merit. It consists of a rosette made of dark blue ribbon, and is only bestowed on female cooks who are celebrated for the excellence of their cooking. Culinary etymologists have not yet settled their dispute as to the precise derivation of the term “ Cordon bleu,” as it is applied to skilful women cooks. The history of its adoption is still a mystery. Some will have it that the eminently epicurean monarch Louis XV. was so delighted with the dish served up at one of his repasts, under the auspices of Madame Du Barry, that he proposed to decorate the cook who had prepared the enjoyable feast with the blue' ribbon of the order of Saint Esprit; but it is to be feared that there is not any more authentic historical foundation for this statement than there is for the legend that Charles IT. once knighted a joint of roast beef, which became then and thereafter Sir Loin.” Others maintain that in the middle of the eighteenth century, when restaurants first became popular in Paris, these places of entertainment were frequented by attrac- tive damsels in Alsatian or in Burgundian costume, who wore “ Cordons ” or scarves of different coloured ribbons. These fair Hebes sang songs, played on the fiute, and sold fruit and cakes. One of the most popular of their number developed a genius for the culinary art, and descended to the kitchen to cultivate it. Her badge was a ribbon of dark blue tint, which circumstance caused her to be known as “ Cordon bleu.” Be it as it may, the controversialists on this knotty subject are agreed on the most essential point, viz., that the “ Cordon bleu ” is the culinary distinction bestowed on very skilful women cooks.

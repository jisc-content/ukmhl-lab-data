HIGH CLASS AND DOMESTIC COOKERY 71 should encourage over-eating, but tliis I sliould hardly think would be the case. It meat is hard, tough and unpalatable, it is plain that some rule of good cooking has been neglected, and the result is not that it is merely uninviting, but that it is as before said unwholesome. Custards turn, cakes do not rise, pastry is heavy and uneatable, soups and fish, etc, go wrong simply for the want of science on the part of the cook. A. gifted cook can flavour better « to taste » than by following any scientific mode of due proportions of seasoning; but a gifted cook is a rare person, and ordinary mortals must be contented to follow the definite rules which are set before them. On tlie whole, it cannot be doubted that cooking as an art has much progressed of late years, and will be more perfected, if still more intelligent knowledge is directed to it. Notes on Boiling Well-boiled meat is not so common as it should be, and one of the reasons is the persistence with whicli the old fashioned notion of putting the joint into cold wa- ter is still clung to by many w'riters on this subject.

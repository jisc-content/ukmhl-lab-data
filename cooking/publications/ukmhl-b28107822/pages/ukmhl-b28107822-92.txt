80 PRACTICAL GASTRONOMA' poultry, or of cattle, or meat unduly fresh, such as can alone be procured during the summer season in towns, is made tender, and is furthermore impregnated with the odours and flavour of fresh vegetaldes and sweet herbs, while the liquor itself, slowly reduced in the process, furnishes tlie most appropriate, fragrant, and delicious sauce with which to surround the por- tion w'lien served at table. Thus, also, meats 'svhich are dry and of little flavour, such as veal, become satu- rated w'ith juices, wdiich render the foodsLicculent and delicious. Spices and wine are sometimes used to impai't their tlavours. The pi'ocess of cooking a braise is thus spoke!i of by Jules Gouffein his JAvre de cui- sine : The chief operation is one of slow simmering, for, he says, if the meat be exposed to sudden heat the gravy is insipid, colourless, and w^eak, as it loo often is in such preparations by careless or ignorant cooks. The gravy should be highly nutritious, of a I'ich high colour and llavour, and of gelatinous con- sistency. c( I advise, » he says, « that for braising the quantity of meat should be laige rather than small, as a long pi'ocess of cooking is most effective, and you at once obtain two admirable dishes instead of one, for wlien the braise is cold it is equally good, and affords a pleasant change. »

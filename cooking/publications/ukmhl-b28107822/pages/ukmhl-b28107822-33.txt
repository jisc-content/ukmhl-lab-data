25 THE ART OF COOKERY M. Ude. Louis Eustache Ude, » was an eniment french cook. He superintended the kitchens of Louis XVI, and the Earl ofSefton. The cookery of England is not, generally speaking, a thing of luxury and art, but for a plain and at the same time substantial meal, there can be nothing more agreeable, than a well cooked « English dinner. » The patriotic Briton, has a right to be proud of Thac- keray’s lines, which run as follow : <( Dear Lucy, you know what my wish is. I hate all your Frenchified fuss; Your silly Entrees and made dishes Were never intended for us. But a plain leg of mutton, my Lucy, I pray thee get ready at three. Have it smoking and tender and juicy. And what better meat can there be ? » There are however not two men, who will agree as to what constitutes a good dinner. The father of the late Earl of Dudly, one of the most noted Gourmands of his time, used to say : « A good soup, a small turbot, a neck of venison, ducklings with green peas, or chicken with asparagus and an apricot tart, is a dinner for an emperor. » I certainly agree with him, but should think that many would be quite contented with less, and if we never dined of anytliing worse than Lucy’s leg of mutton, « smoking and tender and juicy, » we ought not to complain.

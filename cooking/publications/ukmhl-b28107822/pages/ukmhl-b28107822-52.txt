PRACTICAL GASTRONOMY pea,rance of the table witli very little extra cost. Every cook lias bis own style of preparing and di’essing a dinner. Some will study the elegance of dishing up, to the deti’iment of tlie modes of prepa- ration ; whilst others, on the contrary, will aim at refining the preparation, and think little of the elegance. Both are wrong. A good dish must be pre- sented in an attractive form; but there is excess in everything, and too much art in cooking may be as fatal as too little. The study of cookery books, their rules and reci- pes, are of little use unless the practising party has the natural gift for perfect cookei’y. To arrive at per- fection in culinarv art, means to be able to make a pei’fect sauce, and a cook who is proficient in sauce- making must possess the most delicate skill for roas- ting. To merely make up a dish from a recipe is in comparision like dispensing from a prescription. The chemist like the cook will weigh or measure every ingi’edient employed, with the exception, that Ihe former rarely or never tastes his pi’eparations, whilst tlie latter must taste and possess that power of judging of say, a sauce which requii’es reducing where tlie llavour increases as the sauce simmers away. It would lie blind work indeed for a cook to do wi- thout tasting, the very best soups would be ijuite llavourless, if the seasonings were omitted. Seaso- niner in cookerv, is what cords are in music; the liest instruments in the hands of the best professors, wi- thout their being in tune, would be insipid.

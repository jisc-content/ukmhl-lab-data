MENUS AND THEIE COMPILATION. “ Menu nial fait, diner perdu.”—Brillat-Savaein. Although there is hardly a dinner served nowadays without each guest being provided with a sort of pro- gramme of the dinner—or, as it is called in English “ Bill of Fare ”—our forefathers in the time of yore had no need for them ; they contented themselves by merely looking at the dishes as they came on the table to judge the nature of the viands. The use of menus was first heard of in 1541, when, at a banquet given by the Duke Henry of Brunswick, his Grace was seen to have a long piece of paper by the side of his plate, to which he occasionally referred. One of the duke’s guests asked what the paper was for and on its being explained that it was a sort of pro- gramme of what they were going to eat, and by looking through it he could reserve his appetite for those dishes he liked best, the idea was so much admired that it soon became generally known and adopted. The old- fashioned bills of fare were usually written on large cards gaudily ornamented with gastronomic symbols, &c.; they were, however, of such a size that only one copy could be conveniently placed at each end of the table.

75 NOTES ON ROASTING ^ve;lthel‘ joints require slightly less roasting than in cold. Thick joints — say sii’loins of beef oi‘ legs of mutton — will not be well cooked if roasted as long as you would roast thinner ones, such as ribs of beef or shouldei’s. Boned or stulTed meat will re- quire longer cooking than the same joints would unstutTed, or with the bone in. The meat of young animals and of older ones requires different treat- ment (as a rule young flesh, containing less fibrine, requires most cooking); one kind of meat is best roasted before a brisk fire (pork, veal, and lamb for instance) ; another should be more slowly cooked. Some flesli requires very little cooking, some much longer; the flesh of old and full-grown animals poultry excepted — requiring the shorter time. The cook’s aim should be to preserve the real flavour and nourishing qualities of the meat, and to preserve the juices fi'om being dried out during the roasting pro- cess. Attaining this aim depends chiefly upon the roasting l)eing neither too quick nor too slow, and upon the care given to the basting, which should be thorough always. Avoid thrusting forks into roasting meat. It is a good plan to begin with the meat rather close to the fire and then a little farther from the lii*e, increasing the distance between the grate and the joint until (the exterior being hardened) the flesh is heated nearly uniformly all through; and then l)i-inging it and keeping it near the fire, lest remai- ning too far from it should destroy its crisp firmness, and make it uiqileasantly soft and soddened.

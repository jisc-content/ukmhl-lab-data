505 “ LE CORDON ROUGE.” This is the title of the grand decoration granted by a society of the same name, and is considered “ the highest gastronomic order in existence.” The badge of the order consists of a beautifully modelled white-heart cheny, suspended by a cherry- red ribbon. The society is ruled by the “ Supreme Don,” and is supported by twelve “ Senior Dons.” The scope and aims of the society are most praiseworthy. Its endeavour is to advance not only high-class cookery in all its branches, but also to instruct the poorer members of the community how they can utilise available food substances to the best advantage. They hope, in time to come, to form and establish an “ Academic de Cuisine ; ” another scheme of theirs is to carry out the erection of model kitchens for instruction in practical cookery. The decoration of the society is open to :—• 1. Ladies who manage their own establishments and are celebrated for the excellence of their entertainments. 2. Cooks of both sexes. 3. Chemists. 4. Persons who have invented any valuable article of food or drink. 6. Persons who supply the same. 6. Proprietors and managers of hotels and other catering establishments.

GASTRONOMY IN THE FORM OF AN APHORISM 53 « The dinner-table is tlie only place where one does not feel weary during the first hour. » (( May we be satisfied with the happiness we have, if we cannot obtain the pleasure we want. » c( The discovery of a new dish, is far more im- portant to humanity, than the discovery of a new star. )) (( The glutton and drunkard do not knoW' the mea- ning of eating and drinking. (( The classification of eating goes from heaviness to lightness. » (( The order of drinking goes fi'om the light to lieavv. » (( It is heresy to assert, that it is wrong to change, wines ; the tongue is satisfied with the third glass but after the third glass, the taste for wine is blun- ted. )) (( A Dessert without clieese is like a girl without eves. )) (( Punctuality is an indispensable quality of a Cook and should be sacred to the guests. » « To wait long for a delayed guest, is an offence to those who arrived in good time. » « To wait long for a late coming guest, means ru- deness to tlie others w^ho Avait for his sake. » c( Those who receive friends, without having pre- viously provided for their meal, do not deserve to have friends. »

THE COOK AND THE KITCHEN' 45 A good cook, besides Ijcing versed in the techni- ({ue of tlie kifclien, shoiikl also be a good judge of the kinds, qualities and uses of evei'v dietary article. The old Greek comic poet Dionysius says : « To roast some beef, to carve with neatness, Tol)low up sauces, and to blow the hre. Is anybody’s task; be who does this Is but a seasoner and a lirotli-maker. A cook is quite another thing. His mind ^lust comprehend all facts and circumstances. Where is the place, and what the time of supper, Who are the guests, and who the entertainer. What fish he ought to buy, and where he ought to buy it, etc. » « A cook can l)e made wliilst a roaster is born, » these were tlie words of Brillat Savarin, by them we learn that a good cook lias the gift of talent for art. There is much reason in this argument, for it is an aid indeed to possess tlie qualification of art cookery. It is easier to comjiose an operatic piece, than to in- vent a new disli, and even a man who has tlie. natu- ral endowments would find it more easy to qualify liimself to compete with the Royal academicians than with tlie chief operators in cookery. In confirming these facts we cannot do better, than follow the quotations of tlie Marquis de Gussy who remodelled the aphorism of Brillat-Savarin thus : « On devient cuisinier. On devient rolisseur. On nait saucier. »

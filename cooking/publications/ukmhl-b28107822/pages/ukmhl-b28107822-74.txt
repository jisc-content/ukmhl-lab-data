PRACTICAL GASTRONOMY m 11. Slices of sera-fish and sharks’ fins, with bam- boo and muslirooms. It was hard to tell wliat kind of a dish it was, but it was rather bad than good. 12. Giblets of poultry with morels. The morels hel- ped the giblets down. 13. Ham and cabbage. Not very good. 14. Ham of sucking pigs, cooked in their own juice. A pause now ensued, during which pipes and tobacco were brought in. The pipes held about a thimbleful of tobacco — enough for two or three puffs — and we were kept busy filling and lighting them. 15. Land-turtles, with their eggs, in castor-oil. d6. Ends of ham. Good, 17. Breast of fowl, with sour cabbage. No delicacy. 18. Stale eggs (these eggs had been kept one month in salt and two months in moist eartli). The whites looked like burned sugar, and were transparent. The yolks had a greenish coloni-, and the embryos appea- red dark, rolled together, and perfectly recognisable. Dessert : Conserve of sitzon, a red fruit that looks like a shadberry, and tastes like a currant. Good. The only drink was tea, very weak and without sugar, and Jamion, a rice wine, which is drunk hot like tea, and is wretched stuff.

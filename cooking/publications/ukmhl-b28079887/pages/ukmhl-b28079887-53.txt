FOR turkeys, chickens, partridges, and pigeons, take bread enough to make three gills of fine crumbs. Cut off the crust and lay by itself in just enough boiling water to soften it. Rub the soft part into crumbs; put in a teaspoonful of salt, a little pepper, and a piece of butter half as large as an egg. Add the softened crusts, and mix the whole together very thoroughly. If it is not moist enough, add a spoonful or two of milk. If there is not seasoning enough, add more. To put into a fowl neatly, and without waste, use a teaspoon. Stuffing for ducks is usually made with a little finely chopped onion in it. For a goose, sage should be used.

5 MUTTON BROTH. fT^AKE the water in which a leg of mutton has been boiled. Take off I the fat, and boil it for two hours with a turnip, an onion, and a carrot—cut small. Add some minced parsley, and a spoonful of rice. All these, except the parsley, should be put in while the water is cold. Any little pieces of the neck, ribs, or shank will make excellent broth.

Wash a good sized cabbage well in cold water, and trim off the outside dead leaves. Cut it up, but not into very small pieces. When the water is quite boiling, put in the cabbage and boil for five minutes, then pour off the water, then add to the cabbage two quarts of water, two ounces of butter, and pepper and salt for seasoning and let it boil for one hour. After that, pour in three quar- ters of a pint of milk, and let it boil up. • Toast a slice of bread slightly on both sides and cut it up into pieces the size of dice. Pot them in a hot tureen, and pour the soup over them, and it is ready for serving. B£ T * # « a » Z Z T HX m & &tst i z in k f$ ip] a no & m n$. % /p, Zjr.

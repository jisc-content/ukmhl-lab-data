i ^ ^ l o ts m ff tit hr. it, n a o BOILING POTATOES. TIME required for boiling potatoes. Old potatoes about half an hour; new potatoes about twenty minutes; steamed potatoes, half an hour. Wash the potatoes well in cold water. If the potatoes are diseased then take a sharp knife, and peel them, and carefully cut out the eyes and any black specks, but it is otherwise much better to boil them in their skins. Put them in a saucepan with cold water, enough to cover them, and to every two pounds of potatoes sprinkle a teaspoonful of salt over them. Put the saucepan on the fire and boil the potatoes from twenty minutes to half an hour. Feel if the potatoes are quite tender with a fork. When sufficiently boiled, drain off all the water, stand the saucepan by the side of the fire to dry the potatoes. When they have become quite dry, take them carefully out of the saucepan, and if they have not been peeled before, peel them without breaking them, and place them in a hot vegetable dish for serving. % m m a i m &. n « § h. * BOILING OLD TOTATOES.

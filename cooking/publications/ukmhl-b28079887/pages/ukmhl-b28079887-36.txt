BOILED FISH. WASH the fish thoroughly clean in cold water. When the water is warm, put the fish on a strainer or plate (there should be sufficient water just to cover the fish). Put in enough of salt to make the water taste salt. Put the lid on the saucepan, and move it to the side of the fire to simmer gently for twenty minutes to three-quarters of an hour (according to the size of the fish). Skim it occasionally. When the skin of the fish is cracking it is sufficiently boiled. Take the fish carefully out of the saucepan and place it on a hot dish and pour the sauce into a sauce- boat or round the fish. The melted butter sauce is made as follows :— Put one ounce of butter into a stewpan and put it on the fire. When melted, stir in half an ounce of flour. Mix smoothly with a wooden spoon. Pour in a gill (quarter of a pint) and a half of cold water, and stir the sauce smoothly until it boils and thickens. ft IS £ yft $ 2l PPi.fi ftj.iij ft tL0^0ft #. ffi it 4=- ii- -far,W M M ffl 1 »,s m m m pt m m m * * m th** m & w * r & is& w 41 1?.® $8 ® i§ H ft fs,H & & * it, * z. * a,m -t & #,z m i® 7 H.if % ® s m ‘X & tfl,# ffl w,*.

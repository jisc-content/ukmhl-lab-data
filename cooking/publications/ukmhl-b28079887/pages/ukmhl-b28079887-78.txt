If the potatoes are large they should be halved or quartered and. trimmed. Put them in a saucepan with cold water, and only just bring them to the boil. Drain off the water, and wipe the potatoes dry in a clean cloth. Take a thick stewpan and put in it two ounces of butter, and the potatoes. Put the stewpan on a quick fire for about twenty minutes, to brown the potatoes. Watch them, and when they have begun to brown toss them occasionally in the stewpan, so as to brown them on all sides alike. Then strain off the butter, sprinkle them over with salt, and serve them on a hot vegetable dish. ± © iB.Sl.iS * m 4- Ha W ffl ft,® A ® pS.ipt -£• IS 81. i is vffl ft ‘KffM- it A ik $ir M ?

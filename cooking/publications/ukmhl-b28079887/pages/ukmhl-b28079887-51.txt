— 31 ON BOILING MEAT—continued. pound of fresh meat; but a little more time is required to cook a hind than a fore-quarter. Salt meat should boil longer than fresh ; allow forty minutes for every pound. A tongue that has been cured with saltpetre and smoked, should soak over night, and be boiled at least four hours. A ham, if very salt, should also be soaked over night, and should be boiled from three to five hours according to the size, unless you prefer to cook it the last half of the time in the oven. The two things most important in boiling meat, are, to boil it gently, and to skim it till no more froth rises. To do this have a spoon and dish, and the moment the froth begins to rise skim it off. Put in a pint of cold water, which will cause it to rise more freely, and continue to skim it every minute or two, till all is taken off. If the water boils fast before you begin to take off the froth, it will all return into the water, and will adhere to the meat, and make it look badly. m M.jg m ii tK.A m S rn.

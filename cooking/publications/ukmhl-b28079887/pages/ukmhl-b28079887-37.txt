— 17 — TO FRY FISH. CLEANSE them thoroughly, dry them on a folded cloth, dredge flour lightly over them, brush them with a well beaten egg, then dip them in fine bread crumbs. Have ready enough melted lard to entirely cover the fish. Place the frying pan over a clear fire. Let the lard reach boiling point, and then immerse the fish in it. You may try whether the fat is hot enough by letting a drop of cold water fall into it. If the hot fat spits, it is ready for use. Then fry, turning the fish (when one side is browned) to the other. When it is done lay it on a cloth, or on white blotting paper, to drain off all the fat; or put it on a reversed sieve for a little while. Serve it extremely dry on a white cloth. e m n m m » ifj M ft & St 9t # ±,« m $ « m m m m m m & #.#.* » f£ 12 ±,0 £ofl Id itt in a* = if: £ m m a- m a n *0# & b#.- m ffl m ^ T fa %.

MAKE a pint of milk very hot, sweetened with half a pound of best sugar; then stir carefully into it the yolks of eight well beaten eggs, and half a pint of strong chocolate. The chocolate is made as follows :— Cut a cake of chocolate in very small pieces, boil a pint of water. When it is at boiling point, add the chocolate; mill it off the fire until quite melted. Then place it on a gentle fire till it boils. Pour it into a basin, and it will keep for some days. When it is required, put a spoonful or two into fresh milk, boil it with sugar, and mix it well. Mill it to a fine froth. After this put it into a jug, stand it in boiling water over a clear fire> and stir it one way until the eggs are set in the milk, but do not let it boil, then strain it through a fine silk sieve, and stir into it about half a pint of thick cream. Freeze and mould it as other ice creams. tfc m jjc W » 0r ft ft ft * * »[ f m ® £,ft u,m * fit * w.» a m ti ± iBj jf,® ffi # is ft ft.® g gs & m ® miitr ® ft x tt * m k m o HR fffl ft, ft in ft ffl ft yc.ft ft ft 7J ffl T So— ® ft ^ ® T.tr ft £ $ « $ £ lit $

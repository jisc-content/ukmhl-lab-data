Rub the butter well amongst the flour, so as to mix them thoroughly.. Mix up the flour and butter with as much cold water as will make a thick paste. Knead it quickly on a board, and roll it out flat with a rolling-pin. Turn the dish upside down upon the flattened paste and cut the piece required for the cover. Roll out the parings, and cut them into strips. Wet the edges of the dish, and place these strips neatly round on the edges as a foundation for the cover, then take some slices of tendci beef mixed with fat. Season then with pepper and salt, and lay each slice flat in the dish. Put in a little gravy or cold water, and a little flour for thickening. Then, after putting in the meat, lay the cover on the dish, pressing down the edges closely to keep all tight. If any paste remain, cut or stamp it into ornaments, such as leaves, and place these as a decoration on the cover.

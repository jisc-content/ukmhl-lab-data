— 11 PEA SO U P—con tin md. boiled meat would be better than water for soup. Wash two onions and one turnip in col 1 water, peel them and cut them in halves. Wash one carrot, and scrape it clean with a knife. Take one head of celery, cut off the ends of the root, and wash it well in cold water. When the water in the saucepan is boiling put in the vegetables. Add some bones—unless liquor in which meat has been boiled is used,—first washing them. Season with one teaspoonful of salt and half a teaspoonful of ground pepper. Boil slowly for two hours, watching it, and skimming it occasionally. Then take the bones out. Place a colander or wire sieve over a basin. Pour in the contents of the saucepan, and rub them through into the basin with a wooden spoon. It is then ready. Toasted bread cut to the shape of dice * should be served either in, or with the soup.

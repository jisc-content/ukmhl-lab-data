WASH the sole well, and lay it on a board. With a sharp knife cut off all the outside fins, the head, and the tail. Take the skin off. Slide the knife along carefully between the flesh and the bones, holding the flesh in one hand and drawing it away as the knife cuts it from the bone. Do both sides of the fish alike, and it will make four fillets. Put each fillet separately on a plate, and rub it over with flour. Take a wire sieve, and stand it over a piece of paper. Take some crumbs of bread and rub it through the sieve. Beat one egg on a plate with a knife. Lay the fillets in the egg, and egg them well all over with a brush. Put them in the bread crumbs, and cover them well. Be careful to finger them as little as possible. Take a saucepan, and put in it one pound and a half of lard.

They should be folded over. When the fat is quite hot, put in the frying basket with the fillets for three minutes. Put a piece of paper on a plate. When the fillets are done they should be a pale brown. Turn them out on to the paper on the plate, to drain off the grease. Serve them in a hot dish on a napkin, garnished with a little fried parsley.

Toss the basket with the parsley into the boiling fat for a second. The anchovy sauce is prepared as follows:—Take a stewpan and put into it one ounce of butter and half an ounce of flour. Mix them well with a wooden spoon. Add a gill and a half of cold water. Put the stewpan on the fire, and stir well with a

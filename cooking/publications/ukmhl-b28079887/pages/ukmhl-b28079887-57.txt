Cut up an onion, a potato, a small turnip, and a carrot. Lay these on the top of the meat and then sprinkle in half a teaspoonful of cinnamon, half of mace, one-fourth of clove, and add cold water enough to cover it. Let it come to a boil, skim off all the scum, then cover tight, and simmer five hours. After it has been boiling four hours, mix half a cup of flour with cold water, and add to it. You can then taste it and add more seasoning if necessary. The spice may be omitted if you choose. Serve the meat in a little of the gravy, and send the remainder of the gravy to the table in the gravy tureen. m ® & o m ± - n i-ii m w ft su® * m um sissies*© m - &0 •3-oft] if AMM 211tMEa % it m. ta m m-m mm % m ® m in %-zm* « m m w>m = ^ ± s zjn m m ffl zm * jr m ffl It ft # MJ& UM AM m § *? n,z a * fi.T 11 s 1, ^ ± «Bt.ii m it # jr a - ® m ft\ nf, $h -n-g ffl ^ EE —

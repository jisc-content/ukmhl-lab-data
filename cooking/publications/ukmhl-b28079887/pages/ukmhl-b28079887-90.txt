70 — PEAS. SHELL the peas. Put a saucepanful of warm water on the fire to boil. When quite boiling, put in the shelled peas, a teaspoonful of salt, and a quarter of a saltspoonful of carbonate of soda, the latter will keep the peas a good colour. Let them boil for from fifteen to twenty minutes according to the age of the peas. (The cover should be off the saucepan). After that time the peas should be felt to see if they are quite soft, when they are to be taken out of the saucepan, and all the water drained off them. Turn the peas into a saucepan with half an ounce of butter. Sprinkle about half a teaspoonful of salt, and about a teaspoonful of castor sugar over the peas, and toss them over the fire for a few minutes, but they must not fry. For serving, arrange them on a hot vegetable dish. m. m ^ fl * w M.ra ft ».» m IS ft»lt ■!§ fB l§ ^ —■ iflo-icE ^ jSo# g » ¥ # % m m a.m g,« m m m JtoT aft mm-mm m mm ® & z * m yL j ft m ^ ftcfa i?n & z «.h#, t,2 ^ W J iff 1=3 mm i5i #i s g a. m m h * ■&oK at — -the tr tr g - O — ic —c% tft He H ft Mil ZAa # £ ffl m ft ft STRINGED BEANS. CUT off each end of the string, and cut them up small. Boil them in as little water as will keep them from burning. Just before you take them up, add salt and butter, and dredge in a little flour. They should have only as much liquor in them as you wish to take up in the dish, else the sweetness is wasted. String beans and peas are good boiled together.

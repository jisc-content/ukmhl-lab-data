TO BOIL A HAM. A ham should be soaked in cold water for twelve hours, then trim and _XA_ scrape it very clean. Put it into a large stewpan with more than sufficient water to cover it. Boil it for four or five hours according to its weight, and when done let it become cold in the liquor in which it was boiled ; then remove the rind carefully and shake bread-crumbs over the fat. ts m m m ft « & * m % u m » be Mo* Hf,m m i8 ft m m * ft m m m m m $ z * n s &,z * si E.iffl # HAS W SB # ffi II ff # Bir ^ Ml mm H + &0n to * *& t- n.s fit *r - TO FRY FIAM. CUT thin slices, and take <jfF the rind ; if very salt, pour hot water upon them, but do not suffer them to lie long in it, as the juices of the meat will be lost. Wipe them in a cloth; have the frying-pan ready hot, lay in the pieces and turn them in a minute or two. They will cook in a very short time, say eight minutes. The secret of having good fried ham is in cooking it quick, and not too much. pf m kM it IftH2 a# m m m m r * a$ M ff W — #0M>ffi — 75 m 0 o IB Zofr &o!d £ & A,ft m ft z pi' & R-o w m m m =& tk. 45c 5ft iii.ii ik 81 - Jt.-fto® * 81 is. is «p * a » » IS ‘X * ffi ffi. tk Wl )M MM m vktitm&x #.f»

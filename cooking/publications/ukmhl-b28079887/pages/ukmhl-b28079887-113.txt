— 93 — TREACLE PUDDING. PUT a large saucepan of warm water on the fire to boil. Take a quarter of a pound of suet, put it on a board, cut away the skin, and chop up the suet as finely as possible. Put one pound of flour into a basin with a little salt, and one teaspoonful of baking powder. Add the chopped suet, and one teaspoonful of ground ginger, and mix all well together with a spoon. Put a quarter of a pound of treacle into a basin with a quarter of a pint of milk and one egg, and mix them together. If liked, lathei more treacle can be added. Stir this into the mixtuie in the basin, and add more milk if required to make the pudding moist. When the pudding is mixed it should be rather stiff. Take a large basin, grease it well inside, and pour the mixture into it. Pe careful that the basin is full, foi if not quite full the water will get into it, and spoil the pudding. Sprinkle some flour over the top of the pudding, put a cloth over it, and tie it tightly down with a piece of string, just below the rim of the basin, and tie the corners of the cloth together. When the water in the saucepan is quite boiling, put the pudding in and let it boil for two hours. For serving, take the pudding out of the saucepan, take off the cloth, place a hot dish over the pudding, and turn it carefully out of the basin. mM* ^ m m nut ffl # & a,#* z m ^ t.Wc " — A % !>] II 9K02 m n m m M —■ Z in 13 $ ,h#,S A m ra & « A HoA & m - «s %c ffl M W £ A fc T $£ — « AT ;,A$: ife ... — & M 35 f ^ Vyu fq ^^ vm YSj 'xL-o ^ hoP.itt » 5S 4- T -V -H- I * xv J.TT JjRCt /ru : VrC sSgs it AT* CA D A % & ffioW a * ft, an s “ m * m ^ m «• 4^ ..ft- aio^: k # f& P PT fI .35 ffl W B <£],A f® An ® Sc » & .. * mu »f in # vl # s T tr-*-

— 87 — DIRECTIONS ABOUT PUDDINGS. THE eggs for all sorts of puddings should be well beaten. If hot milk is used, the eggs should be added after all the other ingredients. When suet is used in puddings, it should be chopped as fine as possible. For a pudding cloth, the seam should be stitched close with a coarse thread on one side, and then turned and stitched again on the other, m order to secure the pudding from the water. When used, let the seam be outside. A strong twine, a yard long, should be sewed on about three inches from the top of the bag or cloth. When it is to be used, wring it in cold water, and sprinkle the inside thick with flour. It may be spread with butter, and then floured. After which lay it in a dish; pour in the batter, and tie up the bag or cloth quickly, drawing the string as tightly as possible. Allow a little room for the pudding to swell. Lay it immediately into the boiling pot, and after ten minutes, turn it over to prevent the flour from settling on one side. If there is fruit in the pudding, it should be turned three or four times during the first half hour. Keep it covered by adding boiling water if necessary, and be careful that it boils steadily. If it does not, the pudding will be watery. When you take it up, plunge it for a moment in a pan of cold water, then pour off the water, untie the twine, and gently lay back the top of the bag. Have a dish ready, and turn the pudding out upon it. % «.o * i ft 0.g f % m Hi q- m is M si.fl 2 2 2 &• § y, -e H — ^ S ® ^ tfe % M ® ffl IS Jn 4- § ^ IS M wBo-S tt 31* - m m ^i.*t & m»» f o gg

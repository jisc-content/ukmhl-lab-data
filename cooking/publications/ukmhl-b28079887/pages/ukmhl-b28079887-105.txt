MOCK MINCE PIE. ONE cup treacle, one of chopped raisins, one of chopped walnuts, and one cup of water. Butter size of an egg. Four biscuits crushed fine. One tablespoonful of vinegar. Spice as with mince meat pies. Mix and simmer. When cooked make the pastry, and put in, and bake. MAKE a rich paste of a pound of flour; rub in part of the butter, cut the white of an egg to a stiff froth; reserve half a spoonful of it, and stir the rest, and the water into the flour with a knife; then proceed to roll in the remainder of the butter in the usual way. Cut rounds in the paste of the size you wish to have them, and twice as many as you intend to have of puffs. Then cut out of half of them, a small round in the centre, so as to leave a circular rim of crust. Take up these rims with a wide-bladed knife, and lay them upon the large rounds, so as to form a raised edge, and with the knife, thus prepared, lay them on tin sheets. Take a feather, and lightly brush the edges with a little of the reserved white of egg. This will make them brown nicely. Bake them in a quick oven. When all are baked put some jam into the centre. o PUFFS.

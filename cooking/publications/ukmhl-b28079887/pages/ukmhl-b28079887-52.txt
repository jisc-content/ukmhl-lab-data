32 DIRECTIONS FOR MAKING GRAVIES. TO have gravy free from fat is the most important thing. In case yon are roasting beef or mutton, pour off entirely, into a dish, half an hour before the dinner hour, all the contents of the dripping pan, and set it away in a cold place. Remove all the fat from the top, and put the liquid that remains at the bottom into the pan. Wet some browned flour smooth, and when you take out the meat, set the pan on the top of the stove. The gravy will immediately boil, and the wet flour must then be stirred in. It will boil away fast, therefore see that it does not stand too long. Gravy for poultry is made by boiling the giblets (necks, gizzards, hearts, and livers) by themselves in five or sis gills of water. Skim them carefully. After an hour, or hour and a half, take them out, and pour the water into the dripping pan. Mash, or chop the liver fine, and when you make the gravy, add this, and a bit of butter, some pepper, and the wet flour. The fat that roasts out of a turkey should be dipped off with a spoon before these ingredients are added. In making gravy for a goose, pour off all the drippings as in roasting beef, and put in some of the meat liquor. To brown flour put it into the frying pan and set it in the oven or on the top of the stove; stir it often lest it should bum. When it is a light brown, put it into a jar, or wide-mouthed bottle. nMn £ Hi ML it ISJ M ft © ft « m z m m #e # m *6 * R.ne a n- PI S J§ if? is^M * R it,& m itt m ttofli s p be f ^ zm mm- o

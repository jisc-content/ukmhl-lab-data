PARE six plantains. Cut each one in two, and split each half. Put the pieces of plantain into a bowl with two tablespoonfuls of sugar, and three tablespoonfuls of orange juice, and let this preparation stand for an hour. Make a batter. Dip the slices of plantain into it, coating each slice thoroughly. Lift the slices with a fork, drop them into the hot fat, and cook for three minutes. As soon as the fritters are done, take them from the fat, and drain them on paper. Arrange them in a circle on a flat dish, sift powdered sugar over them, and serve very hot. m a- * a m m *.#: m mm mm tmmdm® m m w am &0m % W. ii — A & A M & Wi $c A. m & m M ihS ffi # M

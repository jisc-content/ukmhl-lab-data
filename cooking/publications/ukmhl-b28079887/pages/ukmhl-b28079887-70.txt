50 — TO ROAST A TURKEY—continued. half done, and put a small piece of butter into the gravy, and baste the turkey with it. Having washed the heart, liver, &c., boil them an hour and a half in a saucepan in a pint of water, skim them when the water first boils up; if it boils away add more. To make the gravy, take out the heart and gizzard, mash the liver, and put it back into the water in which it was boiled, and pour the gravy also out of the roasting pan into it; set it on the coals, add browned flour, wet smooth, and a little butter and pepper, and boil it a minute or two, and then serve it. The liver should never be put under the wing, or laid upon the dish, but always be used in the gravy, as the latter is greatly improved by it. tk # £ H l3j A, % m ftolt ®T f§ fill 'go ± o 3. fi/r II W W m m it» 'f g pf it tk M A iffo m ft, A pf m tk an |E| % il n m ^ Mo m iioO ®\ X fa 4\ ^ m m $ it. * o m m m m Hi it, to. ^ ik M a m ft.ffi, * w ® <s IK m tk m ^ lej fF - ‘Km - iflo A M Isl b$, #s a ® ^ w 4 m it, m m m n m m £ &\m z m A, n ‘X BE m m w n w.a m m # m m Z «Hj,±o4o:S' b$, Hi o m ±> m & is. % $ t Sistlffll !tf if to 4- Hi 8E f H i BE K & W.

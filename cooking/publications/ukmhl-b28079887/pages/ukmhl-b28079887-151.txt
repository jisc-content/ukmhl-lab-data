— 131 ICED ROLLS. TAKE a quarter of a pound of fine flour, two ounces of butter, and one ounce of sifted crushed sugar; rub these ingredients well together. Beat up the yolk of an egg with a little water. Add it to the flour and butter, and make them into a paste, work it well with the hands for one minute, and roll it out. Have ready some mince-pie tins, butter them, line them with the paste, put a little ball of paper in each (to keep the lid of paste raised), then put a lid of the paste over them. Bake them in a quick oven for ten or twelve minutes. When taken out of the tins, turn them bottom upwards. When they are cold, take a penknife and cut a hole the size of a ten cent price and take the paper out. Beat the whites of two eggs to a stiff froth ; cover the rolls with it, and dust them well with sifted sugar. Put them in a slack oven to brown. When to be set on the table, fill them with good custard, and put a little sweetmeat on the top. Six will make a dish. m a & fi m m m §k>M M lollop K Lift M 0 A ti % ffl A A S If & ffi $o K + fls*r ffl W» 8s m * o ± m m m ffl x w - ft m m ^ tr ® ^ a — &ia — ® # o m «ft m ffl & ^)»s *i w @ m i& z m mu p M Pi - *§ ti Ig.nU.jf Z ?f,fl (S) it M. z A g.fS Hi ■$ %. £ ± is- JR AoRiJ MiMM X JffflS it ffl AoPS.ft -ff-MM & * « ± 7kM ft -ft ffl IR* - ts. ft UM »#>P 10,ti ift % # M S Bi M ffl Z ffl M !UJ m t& ^.1 )h> s - m m ik A I# ffl if: if* It ik.W.ffr Jfc ffl 0 m -tfeoTJ tl S * yft ffl ft hi I® £ ® 2 O A, $ A ft li £1 & ft - n sf, & m ft m m m ±.# « is. a p§ h m - m Wi W Ik m m *r at sii 4 ft H t§ vft

PREFACE. The Compiler has prepared this Work in consequence of several Persons having spoken to him of the great want of a Cookery Book, which could be placed in the hands of native cooks in foreign employ. It has been his endeavour to arrange the contents in such a systematic form as to ensure facility in use. It has not been without difficulty that the phraseology as well as the terminology employed in foreign cookery has been rendered into the equivalents in Chinese. Flowing sonorous periods and a high classical style have not been the objects aimed at, but the rendering of the Recipes in such a clear and simple style as to be readily understood by the average Chinese cook, who, though able, as a rule, to read and write, is not generally a highly educated individual. The foreign resident can thus order any Dish, by showing to his Cook the Chinese translation, of the English Recipe, and get what he wants, provided the Cook closely follows the instructions given. The Compiler, as this is a new departure, will be pleased to receive any suggestions, which those who may use the Book may think would render it more useful. The manuscript has been ready for publication for the last eighteen months, but circumstances have prevented it being printed sooner. HongkongNovember 1890. J. DYER BALL.

7G MACARONI. PROCURE that which looks white and clean. When it is to be used, examine it carefully, as there are sometimes little insects inside. Wash it, and put it in a stewpan in cold water enough almost to cover it. Add a little salt. Let it boil slowly half an hour; then add a gill of milk, and a small piece of butter, and boil it a quarter of an hour more. Then put it in the dish in which it is to go to the table, grate old cheese over it, and heat a shovel red-hot, and hold over the top to brown it. It may be browned in a stove, but if the dish would be injured by it, the better way is to use the shovel.

BREAK four eggs into a large bowl; beat them thoroughly; season with salt and pepper; take a tablespoonful of flour, and mix very smoothly in a small teacupful of sweet milk, then pour it into the bowl with the eggs, and beat all well; have ready a frying-pan very hot, with a good lump of butter melted in it. Pour in the omelet, and as soon as it becomes “set ’ in the middle, turn very carefully. Serve hot.

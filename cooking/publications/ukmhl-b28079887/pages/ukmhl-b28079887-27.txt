MACARONI SOU P—continued. It is better to boil the macaroni separately. To prepare the macaroni, put a saucepan on with water to boil. When quite boiling, put in a quarter of a pound of macaroni and sprinkle about half a saltspoonful of salt over it. Put on the fire and boil till the macaroni is quite tender. It will take about half an hour. When sufficiently boiled, strain off the water. Pour some cold water on it and wash it, put it on a board and cut into small pieces about a quarter of an inch in length. Put the macaroni into a soup tureen and strain the hot soup over it. It is then ready for serving. (BfflMR-bai API) m m a » ±,m *s a # * ^ is » x m pf ffi. *%>M $? m Z. 2 8 ft ®o £ a 5dF # So Jt itt nft, * a. *§.«i jit m m -z. m n BARLEY SOUP. PREPARE the soup in the same manner as for the macaroni soup, but instead of putting in macaroni put in barley. The barley need not, like the macaroni, be prepared separately. If barley, however is used instead of macaroni, it will take a much longer time to boil. m % fa m % nt ». fa » m m -tko M iff M % M *l« M n % — 4k M % z. m % * n a m & - ?r & * So»

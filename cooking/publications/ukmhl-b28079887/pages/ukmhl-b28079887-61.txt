•11 o HAM AND EGGS. IIRY the ham as before directed, and when the ham is all fried, turn the fat into a basin, and scrape the salt from the frying-pan ; turn back the fat, and add to it half a cup of lard. When this comes to a boil, break in your eggs. Dip up the boiling fat while they are cooking and pour over them, they will be ready in three minutes if required underdone, but if wanted well done, in four. Lay them on the slices of ham, and serve. a x -no I Hi ti m R'i m m n it $ in m m m u m ^ o ± x m & * m a m n m m ft si %■ 0 Z -g >£5 B5 B$, lej fe,® M.X X &a m » x/4- be m x % m0M m m m M £ £ J3£,£cSi — ^.si *$ *r * m m m « # FRIED SAUSAGES. CUT the sausages apart and wash them; then lay them in the pan and pour boiling water over them; let them boil two minutes, then turn off the water and prick the sausages with a fork, or they will burst open when they begin to fry. Put a little lard in the pan with them, and fry twenty minutes. Turn them often that they may be brown on all sides. ^ m w mmmmm m>m it it m a m ± m m m m gz-fow M & hms,* a§ a§ % it m Xo im> & fj# m mM & m « & & i&o X, >11 m «S 2 * m if, & m i® it 0 tk. 3BU#»# x, m x n w

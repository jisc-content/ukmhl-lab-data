Break ' them up and put them into a saucepan, with cold water enough to cover them and one quart more. Boil on the fire. When just boiling, put in a tablespoonful of salt, to help the scum to rise. Peel one good sized turnip, and cut it in quarters. Wash two carrots, scrape them, and cut them in quarters. Wash four leeks and shred them up finely. As these vegetables are prepared, they should be thrown into cold water to keep them fresh. Take two onions, peel them and stick two cloves into one onion. Skim the soup well, and then put in the vegetables. Add a blade of mace, and a teaspoonful of pepper corns. Move the saucepan to the side of the fire and let it gently simmer for two hours-and-a-half. Raise the lid slightly to let out the steam. {Continued on ‘page 7).

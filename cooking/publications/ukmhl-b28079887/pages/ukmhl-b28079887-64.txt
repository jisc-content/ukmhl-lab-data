44 — MEAT FRITTERS—continued. a quarter of a saltspoonful of salt over the whites of the eggs and whip them to a stiff froth. Stir the whipped whites of the eggs lightly into the batter and stand it aside for an hour to rise; it should not stand longer than that. Put half a pound of lard into a saucepan and put it on the fire to heat. ' Cut some cold meat into thin slices. When the batter has risen, stir it lightly with a spoon so as to be sure that there are no lumps settled at the bottom. When the lard is quite hot and smoking, take the slices of meat, dip them in the batter so that they are quite covered, and then drop them into the hot fat. Too many slices must not be put in at once, as they should not touch each other. Turn them over, so that they are fried a nice brown on both sides. As the fritters are fried, take them carefully out of the fat with a perforated spoon and put them on paper to drain off the grease. Be careful to skim the fat from time to time, or the little loose pieces of batter will burn and spoil the fat. For serving, turn the fritters on to a hot plate. % f® n zm 0 « m x a ti iy IR ® S5 ta, w ±.tx m fl M ft i^cME ft F A K X S Aik % m Wc b#, S: m It * a lt.il Ft tic St 2 tic “f.T fit J5 ifc W. fft ts m « m » @ & m n & — m m m i § ig t t s i * « T M Z lie it $ '4- » l^j #, Bill bf PJ ?(> fg A. j®, Ft fit- % £ Z tr W m o is we —» & ii w £ O Wo — S 5b. tic §§ Moilf. tt if tft — a a st is m & z n M'± ny #, IS Jt.T fi] IS ® tic z tr $ f'tofij m.m.m * * m # e $ « , fi tK * ??. m w * i b i 1 ? f I 9 ‘X p jg Mog — tr.

USE any cold potatoes you may have; if there are none, then boil one and a half pounds. Put one ounce of butter, and one tablespoonful of milk, into a saucepan, and put it on the fire to boil. Put the boiled potatoes into another saucepan and mash them up with a fork or spoon. When the milk boils, pour it into the mashed potatoes, and stir them into a smooth paste. Put the saucepan on the fire and let the potatoes just boil; be careful they do not burn. Take any scraps of cold meat, cut them in small pieces, and put them in a pie dish in layers. There should be some fat with the meat. Take one small onion, peel it, and chop it up as finely as possible. Sprinkle each layer of meat with pepper and salt, and a little of the chopped onion. Fill the dish half full of cold water. If there is any cold gravy it would be better than water. The pie dish should be quite full of meat, and rather heaped in the centre. Take the mashed potato and put it over the top of the meat, smoothing it over neatly with a knife. Take a fork, and mark all over the top of the potato. Put it in the oven for half an hour to brown the crust of potato and warm the meat through. It is then ready for serving.

- 80 PASTRY—continued. of the under-crust all round with cold water, not omitting a single spot, (if you do the syrup will escape at that spot), and sprinkle a very little flour upon it, lay the trimming upon the rim, wet and flour that in the same manner, then lay the upper-crust immediately over, and press it down gently upon the rim. The flour and water act as a paste to fasten the crusts together. Trim the edge as before, and prick the top eight or ten times with a fork. This is necessary for the escape of steam, and without it, the closing of the edge wall not avail to keep in the syrup. It is a good way to invert a teacup in the centre of a juicy fruit-pie. A clammy lower crust is neither good nor digestible. Therefore never fill pies made of moist materials until just before putting them into the oven. Pie crust becomes yellow from standing long before being baked; therefore delay rolling out the upper crust for any kind of pies until the oven is nearly ready. Pastry should be baked in a quick oven to be light, and be slightly browned to be healthy. It is difficult to make flaky crust in warm weather. But cooling the butter and water with ice, and making up the pastry in a cool place will insure tolerable success. ffl m it m m m m m z m.-g,n, m * 4 * z m m M ® ffl m vft.vft m ** & m m z n m m m m m HR a $ m a * st» & if '>\- o m.# a, - hsls i i i » a m » s t» m m n tr m & % js,® a a, itt m 7i je <&•,»,» » g,B & M»{ _ mm b.b m a ^ m « z. it a ^ n m & m m & - nf 41 ® ^ A 46 ^ f*,HS ® fflJifcSI^Bd1**: it.® » ^ ®,*i <f # ffl m.ffi DR B # X O S.S ft $ H,- ffl » fi = B ft ft SI ft mo& » ft in B * IB m ft, ft K ^ 'R 'P ffl ft.ft SfflSAZ SHE ^ * fr IS ».« ¥ » 5tt *

WHEN making pies and cakes, the first thing to be done is to build the fire and get the oven just right. Then sift the flour and measure it; count and break the eggs; measure everything that is to be put into the cake; lard the pans, and line them with paper. If butter is put into the cake, the order in which the different ingredients should be put in is as follows, viz.—Beat the butter to a cream, and then add the sugar gradually, then spice and any kind of liquor which you use, then the milk, then the eggs well beaten, then the flour, in which always mix thoroughly while dry, the soda and cream of tartar; and, if fruit, let that always be the last thing to be added. 6 m 3k » §& I# & Hi. # m i6 #*. tr » a w m» a 4 * t s is a i wm ® « Em » & tk m m m f? trJJti fottoifc m. & ® * ii in ft w > # o #r 44 IE 4 « tr ffi 4 ’/ft. * H K ^ o SfiTiKtf - | W.z

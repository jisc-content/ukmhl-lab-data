A RICH SOUP. mHE richest soups are made by using several kinds of meat together; as I beef, mutton and veal. A shank of each of these with very little meat upon it, should be boiled several hours, and vegetables with various kinds of spice added. Nice soups should be strained ; and they are good with macaroni, added afterwards, and boiled half or three-quarters of an hour. If you have the water in which chickens have been boiled, the soup will be much better if the beef, and mutton, are boiled in this, instead of pure water. ft. 'Ko ^ m ^ m m ft. ft m - ¥ 1m flfi.

BOIL the bones at least three hours, or until every particle of meat is loose; then take them out and scrape off the meat and set aside the water to cool. Take from it all the fat. Cut up an onion, two or three potatoes and a turnip, and put into it. Boil an hour. Half an hour before it is ready add some salt. £ » M M 10.10,Z ft M Jit m 'j? m ffi ^j.h se m s n mjh = q- 4- 9o^ m mm mm jm — n # o &>z w>$t z m i0ofF M * « ft.® •wzm & m ^ m m ffi itt w £ »

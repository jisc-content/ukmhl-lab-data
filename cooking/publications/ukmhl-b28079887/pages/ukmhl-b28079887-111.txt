TAKE a dish, and butter it well inside.. Take one ounce and a half of rice, and wash, it well in two or three waters. Put the rice into the "buttered dish, and sprinkle over it a tablespoonful of moist sugar. Fill half full with milk. Nutmeg may be grated, or- pounded cinnamon be sifted over the top of the pudding before it is put into the oven. Put the dish into the oven, and bake for two hours. Watch it occasionally, and as the rice soaks up the milk, more milk should be added (carefully lifting up the skim and pouring the milk in at the side) so as to keep the dish well filled towards the end. It is then ready for serving. © A * * fa &,.js M s m h % m m m 3S $ £ B H ^>8H % A * % M # % AcM B fa ffl 4- ^>B ^ M vft «fi IS &M 14 B Z,M # M W.

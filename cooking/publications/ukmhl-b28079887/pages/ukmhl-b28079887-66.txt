Pi W A. ft He M * ffl A) Oo MEAT HASH. CHOP fine any kind of cold meat (before chopping dredge with salt and pepper). If you have cold potatoes, chop fine and mix with the meat, if they are hot, mash. Allow one third meat to two thirds potato. Put this mixture in the frying pan with a little water to moisten it, and stir in a spoonful of butter. Heat slowly, stirring often, and when warmed through, cover and let it stand on a moderately hot part of the stove for twenty minutes. When ready to dish, fold as you would an omelet, and dish.

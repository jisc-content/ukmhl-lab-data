— 22 — RISSOLES OF COOKED FISH. ANY cooked rich light fish are especially good for the purpose, and even cold salt fish will do, on account of its savouriness. Pick all the meat from the bones, pound it in a mortar, or pull it to pieces with a silver fork, mix it well with an equal quantity of bread-crumbs and some butter, season it with an onion chopped very fine, and a sprig of parsley and pepper and salt. Mix with it sufficient beaten egg to bind it, make it up into flat and rather small cakes, and fry the rissoles with butter or lard. When they are dished, dredge into the fryingpan flour enough to absorb the grease, stir in a very little water, add pepper and salt, and any flavouring that is liked, pour the gravy round the rissoles, and serve them very hot. « RTotti,^ $-Mm»x.mzm m m * sk m m m m iiai # # is & Z ff S.S IB,* n.tt ® MM A s MM & m » M z m M * S M PJ M fit M SG mM mm&mmmrnm m $ m ft ® PI P.35 in ffl # iii m a Z in M M $ M '}?M $ M %k Si j Hf,® ® vftolB % ® «• » vffi #j ^)o^f s 3* ffl ^ H, £Mfk MM it m & m & ik z0% m - m - ® e* & ft.# 9 * &.JR M *r ii f i s;h b a l l:s. PICK out all the bones, and bits of skin the day that the fish is boiled, as it is more easily done while it is warm. Chop it fine, when it is cold, and also all the potatoes left of the previous dinner; they are better for this purpose than those just boiled. Mix the fish and potatoes together. Melt a small piece of butter in a little milk, and when you have stirred it into the fish, make it up into little flat cakes, roll them in a plate of flour, and fry in hot lard.

PLAIN FROSTING. PLACE the whites of one, two, or more eggs in a bowl. Throw into them a tablespoonful of pulverised white sugar. Beat with a wooden -spoon, adding sugar by the spoonful, and beating well between the -additions. It is impossible to state the exact amount of sugar, as the size and freshness of eggs vary so much; but use about one cupful of sugar for one white of an egg. If, when drawing the end of a knife-blade through the frosting on the back of a spoon, it leaves a clean-cut line, consider the frosting sufficiently beaten. It is best to frost cake while it is warm. Spread over the cake a thin coating of the frosting, with a long thin knife. This fills the pores, and the heat of the cake melts the sugar, causing the frosting to cling very securely. Next put on with a spoon s ifficient to cover the cake, spreading evenly over the whole surface. After smoothing, set in a cool place to harden. Lemon juice is the nicest flavouring.

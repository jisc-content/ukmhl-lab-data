In this novel prepara- tion there are contained two substances of very definite therapeutical value — a renowned restorative, and a powerful stimulant and tonic.” * THE QUEEN, November zWi, 1891. “Ifwe would only take the trouble to find and use them, there are many preparations which would go far to lighten both our fatigue and our work. Amongst such restoratives must surely be included Messrs. Root’s CucA Cocoa. How much the cuca element, the product of the well-known plant of that name, concerning which travellers in South America report such marvels, may have to do with the result, one would have to be a ehemist to decide ; but certain it is that this Cocoa, both as a beverage and also as a bonbon, has a distinctly tonic and restorative effect, in addition to its extremely pleasant flavour, and would, no doubt, be as useful to travellers and persons engaged in fatiguing work as it is agreeable to the general public.” Of all Stores, Grocers, Chemists, etc. Prices—Cocoa, in tins, Jib., u. ; Jib., u. iid,\ I lb., 3J. gd.

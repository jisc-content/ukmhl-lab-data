VI PREFACE. purchaser; but my experience, foimdecl on many years of housekeeping in all its branches, and of dinners from all kinds of cooks—from the best cliaf that ever stepped in shoe leather (now, alas ! dead; he was eighteen years with my father), an equally good woman cook (who also lived with us some time), to promoted kitchen-maids and others who under- stood only the simplest rudiments of the art which they professed to practise—is, that the dearest article is far the cheapest in the end, because, being the best of its kind, it is consumed to the last crumb. It exemplifies the saying so often disregarded : “ Let nothing be wasted.” But what I have especially attempted to give, and what is much needed, is a variety of dishes at a cost equally within the means of people with limited as of those with large incomes; and this need, I sincerely hope, my book will supply. It is compiled from recipes collected by me during the last thirty-one years from French and English cooks, and from old family recipe books. Of course prices fiuctuate ac- cording to the markets, but those given are average prices. Many of the dishes have been invented by me, and have been practically tested in my own house, in those of others, in clubs, and city and other restaurants. CONSTANCE HOWARD.

BBOWN «P0LX8 COBN FLOUR BROWN & POISON’S CORN FLOUR AS CHILDREN’S FOOD. For very young infants it should always be remembered that nothing but milk is suitable, and that of the best quality, slightly diluted with hot water ; but, so soon as any addition to the milk is desirable. Com Flour will be found eminently useful. Prepared with Milk, it furnishes a food at once agreeable to the taste and easily digested, possessing the heat-producing and tissue-forming elements, both so essential for the nourishment of the young. For Children’s Food it is especially important that it be prepared with GOOD SWEET MILK, and it should NEVER be made with water only. BROWN & POLSON^S CORN FLOUR AS A TABLE DELICACY. The recipes on the PACKETS have been recently revised, and a number of new and original ones added, including PUDDINGS, CUSTARDS, OMELETTES, TARTS, FRITTERS, CAKES, SPONGES, etc. Corn Flour is especially acceptable in summer as BLANC-MANGE with Stewed Frait or Preserves. A delicious JELLY can also be made by preparing it with the Juice of Fruits, as also with Coffee, Cocoa, Wine, etc., instead of milk. PIE-CRUSTS, TARTS, PASTRIES, and RICH CAKES, when baked with half Com Flour and half common flour, are finer in flavour, lighter, and more easy of digestion than when baked with common flour alone. Com Flour is specially suitable for THICKENING SOUPS, SAUCES, GRAVIES, etc., as it does not affect their clearness, colour, or flavour.

flUME HINTS FOR DAIl^TY HOUSEKEEPERS. 255 Celery and Sole Soup.—Wash three heads of celery ; cut it up in sti'ips; put it on the fire with one quart of water; simmer until well done; rub it through a sieve; make the liquor up to one quart; replace in the pan; bring to the boil; add two ounces of Edwai-ds’ desiccated soup ; boil fifteen minutes; add one gill of rich cream ; stir well; just bring to the boil, and take off the fire. Have ready some ready-cooked fillets of sole; place them in the soup tureen; pour the hot soup over them, and serve with fried a'odtons of bread and grated Parmesan cheese. Edwards’ soups are most excellent preparations, most thoroughly to be recommended in every way; they are easily and quickly prepared, and should be found in every household.

It is a gravy powden', and is thoroughly nutritious and sustaining; it can be used by simply mixing some of the powder with hot water, rubbing it with a spoon until perfectly smooth, and then boiling about five minutes, adding seasoning to taste. About two tablespoonsful make one pint of delicious gi'avy.

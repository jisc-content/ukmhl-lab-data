The conical form of the well is for the purpose of having the ice keep compact by sliding down as it melts. The walls of the cone should be built with good hard mortar or Roman cement. At the bottom the ice should be supported on a thin wooden grating, or an old cart-wheel, as represented in the cut. Where the situation will not ad- mit of a drain, the bottom of the ice-well may terminate in a small well sunk still deeper, and this emptied by a pump. The passage to the ice-house should be divided by two or more doors, so as to keep a current of external air from reach- ing the ice. It is said that ice may be kept for a whole year in the open air by making a pile of it on dry ground (the north side of a hill being preferable), in a conical form, of a considerable size, in winter during a hard frost, and covering it a foot thicx. with a layer of fagot-wood, then with a layer of straw, and lastly one of thatch. It should be placed on elevated dry ground, and in a shaded place if possible.

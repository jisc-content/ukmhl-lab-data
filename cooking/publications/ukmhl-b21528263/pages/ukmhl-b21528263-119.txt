115 Preservation of Foods. Preservation of Poraaceons Fruits—Cultivation of Currants and Gooseberries. Pumpkins and squashes, and the stalks of rhubarb, can be conveniently peeled, cut into slices or strips, and dried in either of the foregoing ways. The pomaceous fruits—applet pears, peaches, etc.—peeled, cored, and cut into slices, or, if not too large, simply quartered, preserve their flavor and nutritive properties very well for nearly a year. The majority of berried fruits retain a good degree of their dietetic qualities the year round, on being dried and kept in boxes or bags in a cool, clean, airy place. The following valuable remarks on the cultivation of cur- rants and gooseberries, are from a late number of the Vermont Chronicle : “It is presumed that not one in a hundred understands the simple process of cultivating either currants or gooseberries, although it has been detailed in the horticultural books with which the world abounds. Thousands of persons, with every appliance for success, are still content to live without a plen- tiful supply of these delicious, healthy, and cheap luxuries, merely because they have not thought of the matter. They have a few stinted bushes set in the grass, with three fourths of the stocks dead, and then wonder why they do not bear in abundance. “ There is not a more beautiful shrub growing than the cur rant, properly propagated; and the same may be said of the gooseberry. Cultivators who pay any attention to the sub- ject never allow but one stock, or, as the English say, ‘make them stand on one leg;’ thus forming a beautiful miniature tree. “ To do this you must take sprouts of last year’s growth, and cut out all the eyes, or buds in the wood, leaving only two or three at the top; then push them about half the length of the cutting into mellow ground, where they will root, and run up a single stock, forming a beautiful symmetrical head. If you wish it higher, cut the eyes out the second year. I

Hydropathic Cook-Bcok 138 Biliary Secretion Deficient—Its Cause—Chyliflcation. of constipation ; for 1 have known many diarrheas cease the moment a free secretion of bile was poured into the alimentary canal. That the bile is wholly excrementitious is further corrobo- rated by the fact that the stomach will not tolerate its presence for a moment. When, in a morbid condition of the digestive organs, or by a rctroverted action of the duodenum, it is pushed upward into the stomach, violent distress, nausea, retching, vomiting, general trembling, etc., evince its noxious properties. There is no secretion in the whole system more generally deficient in civilized society than that of the liver; no topic connected with fashionable ill-health is more talked about than biliousness; and nearly all this trouble, it should be known, comes from bad ways of cooking and eating. The pancreatic juice, secreted by the pancreas, is analogous to the saliva. It enters the duodenum at^he same point as the bile does ; and no doubt completes the perfect solution of the alimentary matter. It should be mentioned, also, that the duodenum secretes a fluid similar to, if not identical with, the gastric juice; and, indeed, some physiologists affirm that the solvent property of the duodenal secretion is equal to that of the gastric juice. Chylification.—The intestinal tube is divided anatomi- cally into the small and the large intestines. The small intes- tines, taken together, are about four times the length of the body, and are subdivided into the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum. . The large intestines are subdivided into the caecum, colon, and rectum. Fig. 93 is a view of the whole alimentary canal. 1. Esophagus. 2. Stomach. 3. Liver raised, show- ing the under surface. 4.

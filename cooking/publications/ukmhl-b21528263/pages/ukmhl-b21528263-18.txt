Introduction. XIV “ Tlie waving corn and fruitful tree, Bear gracious nourishment for thee ; Live, fair one, as a lady should, And being beautiful—be good ! “ Though lions, tigers, vultures prey. Be thou more merciful than they ; Thy health will last, thy life be long!” And thus the cockroach ceased his song. Norn—To those who desire to investigate thoroughly the subject of diet, and espe- cially to those who wish to be well posted in the multitudinous facts and statistics which can be adduced in favor of an exclusively vegetable diet, as derived from history and science, I would earnestly recommend the addition to their libraries of Smith’s “ Fruits and Farinacea, the Proper Food of Man“ Alcott's Vegetable Dietand Lax’s “ Organic Laws.” Without involving the reader in difficult physiological problems,' they collectively present an array of evidence and principles which, if not conclusive, are at least inter- esting and instructive. The former is an Engliih work, now being republished by Messrs. Fowlers and W alls. The otter works are published by the same house.

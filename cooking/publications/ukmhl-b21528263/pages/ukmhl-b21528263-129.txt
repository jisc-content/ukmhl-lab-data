125 Theory of Nutrition. Explanation of the Physiology of Deglutition. against the tongue, so as completely to close the pas- sage between the mouth and pharynx; and also of as- cending obliquely backward toward the posterior head of the pharynx, so as to close up completely the passage between the pharynx and the nose; thus performing the part of a double valve. The conical-shaped uvula hangs pendulous from the center of the soft palate. It assists in completing the valve formed by the soft palate and also in modulating the voice. When destroyed by disease, therefore, both the deglutition of food and the sound of the voice are rendered more or less imperfect. Every time the act of deglutition is performed, the openings to the windpipe and to the nose are closed, so that during this operation all access of air to the lungs is stopped, consequently it is necessary that the passage of the food through the pharynx should be rapid. Mastication, a voluntary process, may be performed slowly or rapidly, perfectly or imperfectly, without serious mischief; but life depends on the. passage of the food through the pharynx with extreme rapidity and with the nicest precision. It is therefore taken out of the province of volition and entrusted to organs which belong to the organic life, organs which carry on their operations with the steadi- ness, constancy, and exactness of bodies whose motions are determined by a physical law.

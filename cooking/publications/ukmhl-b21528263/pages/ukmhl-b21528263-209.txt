Pkepaked Fecjits. ■ 205 Currants—Plums—Grapes—Pineapple—Tomatoes. 221. Currants. Green currants, when half or two thirds grown, are more mild- flavorcd and pleasant than when fully ripe; nor do I find them often disagreeing with ordinary dyspeptics. They require stewing but a short time, and moderately sweetening. The best currants, when quite ripe, may be eaten uncooked, with a sprinkling of sugar. £22. Plums. These must be managed according to their character and flavor. Many varieties are too sour to be eaten without stewing, and the addition of considerable sugar. Some kinds, however, are sweet 'and luscious enough to require neither. 223. Grapes. When the grapes are so sour as to set one’s teeth on edge, they should be stewed and sweetened. But good, ripe, well-cultivated Isabellas and Catawbas are incomparably superior in dietetic char- acter, without £:the interference of our art.” What a blessing it would be to the human race if all the vineyards in the world were made to supply wholesome food for children, instead of pernicious poison for adults ! 224. Pineapple. The only way of preparing this fruit, which, like some others, has more flavor than taste, is that of paring, slicing, and sprinkling with sugar. 225. Tomatoes. Scald the tomatoes by pouring boiling water on them; peel off the skins; then stew them for an hour, and add a little slightly toasted bread. This is an excellent sauce for hydropathic tables; and the fruit may be improved in flavor by stewing half an hour or even an hour longer.

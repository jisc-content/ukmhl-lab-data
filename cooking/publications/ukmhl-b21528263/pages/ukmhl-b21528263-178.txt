174 Hydropathic Cook-Book. Hominy—Samp—Rye-mcal—Indian-meal and Oatmeal Mush. 63. Hominy. This is generally, in this market, prepared from the Southern or white corn, which is cut into coarser or finer particles of nearly uniform size. It is cooked like the wheaten grits, and usually re- quires to be boiled one hour. The fine-grained hominy can be well cooked in half an hour, by boiling a few minutes and then steaming it, without stirring, over as hot a fire as can be borne without scorching. All hominy requires soaking before cooking. Two quarts of water are required for one of hominy. 64. Samp. This is merely a very coarse hominy—the grains of corn being cut or broken into very coarse particles. It should be washed sev- eral times, and the water poured through a sieve to separate the hulls j and it requires boiling five or six hours. 65. Rye-meal Mush. This is made precisely like the mush of cracked wheat, or wheaten grits. It is particularly adapted to those who have long suffered from habitual constipation. To persons unaccustomed to the grain, the effect on the bowels is decidedly laxative. The meal must be fresh ground, and made of well-cleaned and plump grain. 66. Indian-meal Mush. White and yellow corn meal are made into the well-known mush called hasty pudding. Either kind is equally agreeable to most persons. It should be stirred very gradually into boiling water, so as to prevent lumping; it will cook very well in fifteen minutes, but half an hour’s gentle boiling improves its flavor. 67. Oatmeal Mush. This, in Scotland, is called stirabout. • It is a favorite with many persons, and makes a pleasant change of dishes. It is cooked pre- eiscly like Indian mush.

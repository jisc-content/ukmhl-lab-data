CHAPTER IV. PRESERVATION OF FOODS. Preservation of Grain, Meal, Seed, etc.â€”All kinds of grains, nuts, and seeds should be perfectly dried and cleaned, and kept in a cool, well-ventilated place. Dried corn has been Kept in good condition for more than eighty years. It is espe- cially important that flour and meal be kept in a clean, sweet room, exposed to no effluvia from vaults, cellars, or sinks, and not injured by smoky fireplaces and stoves. All kinds of flour and meal ought also to be fresh ground ; for they will never long preserve, when broken, all the nutritive virtue of the seeds. Grinding the grain exposes its proximate elements to oxida- tion or fermentation, hence the invariable rule with all farina- ceous foods should be to have them ground as near the time of using as possible. It would be a vast advantage to the health of the community if hand-mills were kept in every family. Wheat-meal will mold or oxidate sooner thdn fine flour, on account of the mucilage contained in the bran; and Indian meal is very liable to acquire an acid or musty property if long kept. Moths, too, are apt to infect it, especially if stored in a damp place. Walnuts, filberts, and chestnuts may be preserved a long time by packing them, when perfectly dry, in jars or boxes, with fine clean sand; or they may be buried in the ground, in a pit lined with clean straw. Lima beans and green peas may be dried in the pure air or in a warm room, when young and tender, and thus kept for winter use. Green corn can be preserved by turning back the husk, all but the last thin layer, and then drying in a warm room or in the sun. It may also be parboiled in a bag, and then dried as above.

Whole Grains and Seeds. 181 CooUort Chestnuts, Peanuts, Green Peas, Green Beans, Dried Beans and Peas. 136. Boiled Chestnuts. These make a perfectly wholesome and very delicious food. The principal difficulty attending their use is their scarcity. As they are liable to be infected with worms, t-lioy should be carefully picked over previous to being boiled. They will cook sufficiently in about an hour. Chestnuts may be roasted in about fifteen minutes. 137. Roasted Peanuts. Peanuts may be cooked in the same manner as parched corn, or baked in a stove or oven. They are healthful food as a part of the regular mealâ€”at all events, to stomachs accustomed to plain living. 138. Boiled Green Peas. Put the peas into just enough water to cover them, immediately after they arc shelled : let them boil about twenty minutes, or until done. When the pods arc fresh and green, it will improve the dish to boil them also fifteen or twenty minutes in as little water as will cover them (having washed them previously); turn off the juice, and add it to the peas. Those who will use salt should add it to the peas after they are cooked, instead of salting the water in which they are boiled A little milk, with a trifle of sugar, if preferred, makes a good seasoning enough. 139. Boiled Green Beans. The common garden, kidney, and Lima beans are all excellent dishes, prepared by simply boiling till soft, without destroying the shape of the seed. A little milk or cream may be stirred in, when they arc cooked sufficiently, if any seasoning is desired. They usually require boiling an hour and a half. 140. Dried Beans and Peas. Dried beans usually require boiling two hours or two hours and a half; and dried peas nearly twice as long. Beans and peas which have been dried in the green state, should be soaked in cold water over night, after which they can be boiled sufficiently in about two hours.

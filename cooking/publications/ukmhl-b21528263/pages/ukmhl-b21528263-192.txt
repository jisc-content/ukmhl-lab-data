188 Hydropathic Cook-Book. Boiled Greeu Com—boosted Green Corn—Succotash. 141. Boiled Green Corn. Trim off the husks and silk; throw it into hot water, and let it boil half or three quarters of an hour, according to the size of the ear. The sweet or sugar corn is the best for this purpose. It should never be boiled in salted water, as this makes it harder and comparatively indigestible. 142. Roasted Green Corn. Remove the husks and lay the ears over red-hot coals on a grid- iron. It is “not bad” roasted by laying the ears directly on burn- ing coals, care being taken to turn them before they are burned injuriously. 143. Succotash. This is usually made of green corn and garden beans, although btring beans are sometimes added. Cut the kernels of corn frorr the cob; and stew them and the beans, closely covered, in watei or milk, for about three quarters of an hour. If a richer dish is wanted, stir in a little cream, and let the whole simmer for ten minutes longer. Some persons string the beans, and then cut them into small pieces, before mixing and stewing—a plan only to be recommended to those who have abundance of time for “ small things.” Lima beans and sugar corn make an excellent succotash; to which a proportion of marrow-fat peas are sometimes added. /

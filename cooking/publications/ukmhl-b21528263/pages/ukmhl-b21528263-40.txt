Hydropatiiic Cook-Book. 36 Sugur-cane—Muplo Sugar—Confectionery—Keflriing Sugar. The sugar in common use is manufactured from a cane or reed called sugar-cane (fig. 11). The sap of the maple tree of the American forests yields a large amount of sugar in the spring season. Sugar was scarcely known, and certainly not in com- mon use, among the ancient Greeks and Romans; and there can be no question that it is generally used to an injurious excess. Were proper attention paid to the cultivation of the sweet and sub-acid fruits and esculent roots, we should have an abundant supply of saccha- rine matter in the very best possible state, without resorting to the crystallized product of the expressed juice of plants. Sugar is made into an immense variety of candies, confec- tions, lozenges, etc., most of which are poisoned with coloring matters, and many of which are drugged with apothecary stuff. The intelligent physiologist will repudiate their em- ployment in every form or shape. The raw sugars of commerce contain various impurities; and the refined and very dry sugars tend to constipate the bowels. The best article for dietetical purposes is of a pale yellow color, with large, clear, brilliant crystals. The art of refining sugar was unknown until the early part of the sixteenth century. Lime and albumen—the latter ob tained from the serum of bullock’s blood or the white of eggs—are mostly employed in refining. Charcoal is used for bleaching it. Fig. 11. TUB 8UOAI1-CANE PLANT.

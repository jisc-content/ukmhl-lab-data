It is a necessary article of food, being essential for the preser- vation of health and the maintenance of life.” All of the above assertions are purely fictitious. Common salt is in no sense dietetical. It is entirely a foreign irritant, and its free employment renders the blood putrescent, the- solids dry and rigid, the muscles inflexible, and the glands obstructed. The notion that it is essential to life or health is positively disproved by the experience of the millions of Japan, who have never yet known its dietetic use. In all the cook-books 1 am acquainted with, a great or greater dose of salt is a fixture in every receipt; and hardly a dish or preparation is named in which a “ pinch,” or “ lea- spoonful, or “table-spoonful” of salt is not prescribed as one of the ingredients. The “natural appetite,” which Pereira supposes nature has furnished us with to secure the salting of our food, is just as natural, and no more so, than that which many persons have for vinegar, pepper, alcohol, and tobacco— a kind of “second nature.” Those who would prepare healthful food, and those who desire to “eat to live,” should ever bear in mind that none of viii alimentary principles • we have been considering is capable of itself of properly nourishing the body. Neither of them, in the. proper sense, is food, but merely a constituent part of food. And almost all the aliments or substances used for food contain very nearly, and some of them quite, all of these proximate elements. Hence the futility of all the mul titudinous experiments in feeding human beings or animals on a constituent part of an aliment instead of the aliment itself. Such experiments only show the physiological igno- rance of the experimenters.

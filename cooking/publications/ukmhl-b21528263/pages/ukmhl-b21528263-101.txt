A L I M E NT S, OR FOODS PROPER. 91 Animal Foods—Mammals—Birds—Reptiles—Fishes. are known under the names of boletus, morel, pepper dulse tangle, etc. Animal Foods.—The alimentary principles derived from the animal kingdom are the proteinaceous, gelatinous, oleagin- ous, and the saccharine matter of milk ; in other words, fibrin, albumen, casein, gelatin, and sugar. They are yielded by flesh, blood, cartilages, ligaments, cellular and nervous tissue, viscera, milk, and eggs. All the species of animals—beasts, birds, fishes, reptiles, and insects—which human ingenuity has been able to grasp, has been “appropriated” as nourish- ment, and there is scarcely any part of any animal carcass which has not been more or less employed as human food. In the most civilized countries the domesticated animals afford the principal flesh-njeat; though the practice of eating the oxen which “ have plowed for us,” the cows which have “given us milk,” the lamb which we have petted, and the sheep which “has warmed us with its fleece,” seems more becoming the savage than the civilized state of society. Varieties of Animal Food.—The Mammals—neat cattle, sheep, and hogs—afford the chief supply of this kind of food in this country. To this class also belong the deer, rabbit, hare, elk, moose, buffalo, and bear, which are employed to some extent in many countries. The Kalmuck Tartars, and some other tribes of the human family, eat their horses, dogs, cats, rats, and mice. Of Birds, the common fowl, turkey, goose, duck, partridge, woodcock, and pigeon are principally eaten. A variety of other game birds are found at the refectories. Among the Reptiles used as food are the various kinds of turtles, and several species of frogs. The flesh of vipers was once recommended by regular physicians as a restorative diet for invalids! Our waters afford an innumerable variety of fishes, nearly fill of which are devoured by the human animal.

203 Prepared Fruits. Uncooked readies—Apricots—Cherries—Marmalade. 210. Uncooked Peaches. When we have peaches as good and ripe as all peaches ought to be, the best way to prepare them is this: Peel them; cut the fruit off the stones in quarters, or smaller pieces ; fill the dish ; stir in a little sugar, and sprinkle a little more over the top. 211. Apricots. Ripe apricots may be prepared in the same way as peaches, but they are best with no preparation at all. Unripe apricots may be cut into quarters, sweetened, flavored with lemon, and stewed in a little water. They will cook in a very few minutes. Avoid stir- ring and breaking the pieces, but fhake the pan round occasionally to prevent burning. 212. Cherries. Stewing is the only proper method for cooking this fruit. Re- move the stalks from the cherries ; pick them over carefully, reject- ing all unsound ones; put them into a pan, with a very little water, and sugar in the proportion of about three ounces to a pound of cherries; simmer them slowly over the fire, shaking the pan round occasionally till done. If a richer article is wanted, take the cher- ries out with a colander spoon, and keep them in a basin till cold; reduce the sweetened water to the consistency of sirup, and put it over the cherries. 213. Quinces It has been said that quinces commend themselves more to the sense of smell than of taste; hence are better to <! adorn” other preparations than to be prepared themselves. When stewed till quite tender, and sweetened, they are, however, very pleasant, yet rather expensive sauce. In the form of marmalade, it is a better seasoning for bread, cakes, or puddings, than butter. 214. Quince Marmalade. Pare, core, and quarter the quinces; boil them gently, uncovered, in water, till they begin to soften; then strain them through a hair ieve, ai l beat, in a mortar or wooden bowl, to a pulp ; add to each

Stewed Pippins. A rich apple sauce is made as follows : Peel, core, and quarter half a dozen ribstone pippins ; put them into a pan with six ounces of brown sugar, the juice of a lemon, its thin rind cut into strips, and very little water; stew over a very slow fire till quite tender. 205. Stewed Dried Apples. Select rich, mellow-flavored fruit, which is clear from dark spots or mold. That which is dried on strings is usually the nicest. Wash and pick the pieces; boil in just water enough to cover them, over a slow fire, till partially softened; then add sugar or molasses, and continue the boiling till done. For a change, they may be oc- casionally flavored with a proportion of dried peaches or quinces. 206. Pears. Pears may be baked, boiled, or stewed in the same manner as apples. Some varieties of small, early, and sweet pears are very delicious, boiled whole without paring, and swetened with sirup. The large pears are usually selected for baking. 207. Boiled Peaches.

They should be pared—except when the skins are very smooth, clean, and tender— but not stoned; boiled moderately till sufficiently cooked, and then sweetened. 208. Stewed Green Peaches. Pare them and take out the stones; add a very little water, and a sufficient quantity of sugar, and boil very slowly till well cooked 209. Stewed Dried Peacpcs. Most of the dried peaches in our markets are sour and unpleas- ant. But when we can find them of good quality, they are very excellent stewed and sweetened precisely like dried apples.

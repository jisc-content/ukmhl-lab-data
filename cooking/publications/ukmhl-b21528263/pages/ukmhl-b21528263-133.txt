To induce these acts, grateful sensations are excited by the contact of the food with the sen- tient nerves so liberally distributed over almost the whole of the apparatus. To the provision thus made for the production of pleasurable sensation, is superadded the necessity of direct and constant attention tc the pleasure included in the gratifi- cation of the taste. It is justly observed by Dr. A. Combe, that without some degree of attention to the process of eating, and some distinct perception of its gratefulness, the food can not be duly digested. When the mind is so absorbed as to be wholly unconscious of it, or even indifferent to it, the food is swallowed without mastication; then it lies in the stomach for hours together without being acted upon by the gastric juice, and if this be done often, the stomach becomes so much disordered as to lose its power of digestion, and death is the inevitable result: so that not only is pleasurable sensation annexed to the reception of food, but the direct and continuous consciousness of that pleasurable sensation during the act of eating is made one of the conditions of the due performance of the digestive function.” Chymification.—The stomach is a muscular bag, of an ir- regular oval shape, placed transverse ly across the uppei part of the abdo in the adult, of holding about three pints.

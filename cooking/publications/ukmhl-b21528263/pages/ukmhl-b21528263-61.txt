JYuts are divided into tho. farinaceous, of which the chestnut is the chief example, and oleaginous including the butter-nut, walnut, almond, and, indeed, nearly all the remainder of the nut tribe. Cupulifer.'E.—The Chestnut (Castanea vesca) was much used as food by the ancients; and is now made into bread in some countries. Boiled chestnuts and milk form a common dish among the peasantry of the south of France. The tree is one of the largest of the forest, and often lives over 1,000 years. Roasted or boiled the fruit is very light and digestible. The seeds of the horse-chestnut tree are similar in composi- tion, but less pleasantly flavored. Oleaginous Seeds.—The Butternut is one of the most oily of the nut seeds. The tree is very common in the Amer- ican forests. Almonds, both sweet and bitter, are the fruit of the Amyg- dalus communis. The Sweet Almond is mostly employed a? a desert, and in flavoring cakes and puddings. Bitter Almonds are always poisonous. They yield both volatile oil and prussic acid when distilled with water, but contain neither in the natural state; another evidence that elements unknown among the constituents of organic sub- stance may be formed in the different stages of their decom- position. Prussic acid is also formed in the mouth when the almonds are chewed. As a flavoring article, these poisonous seeds are extensively employed by cooks and confectioners. The Walnut (InglausRegia) is a native of the East. The sap of the tree is sweet, and sugar has been made from it. The seeds abound in oil, and in some countries are grated into tarts and puddings. Walnut oil has been employed as a substitute for olive oil in cooking, and also in the manufacture of soap. An extract from the green leaves makes a permanent brown dye, which is said to be used by the gipsies to give a dark color to the children they steal. 8*

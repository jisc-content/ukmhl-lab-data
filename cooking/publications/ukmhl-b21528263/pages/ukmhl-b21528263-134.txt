The large curvature of the stomach. G. The small curvature. 7. Its large extrem ity. 8. Its small extremity. 9. Its longitudinal muscular fibers. 10. Its circular muscular fibers. The contraction of the longitudinal fibers diminishes the length, and that of the circular fibers the diametef of the tube; hence the food, acted upon by both sets of muscular fibers is turned, squeezed, and compressed, during digestion, in various directions. The esophagus opens into the left extremity of the stomach obliquely, by an aperture called the cardiac orifice; and at the right extremity the stomach opens into the duodenum by a smaller aperture, called the pyloric orifi.ce. Between these orifices are the two curvatures of the stomach, the one above called the smaller, and the lower on the larger curvature. The Fig. 89. -srr-axoi or reoMAcn or

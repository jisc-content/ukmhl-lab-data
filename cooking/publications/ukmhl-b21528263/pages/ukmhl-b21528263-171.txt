Beat the eggs; mix them with the milk; stir m the me?!, and bake on a griddle like buckwheat cakes. 33. Wheat-meal Griddle Cakes. Wet up unbolted or Graham flour, with water or sweet milk, into a batter, and add a little molasses. It may then be raised with yeast, or with tartaric acid and superearbonatc 'of soda, and baked on a soap-stone griddle without grease. 34. Buckwheat Griddle Cakes. Make one quart of flour into a thin batter with lukewarm wa- ter; add a handful of Indian-meal, and half a teacupful of yeast. Keep it in a warm place over night, and bake in the morning. 35. Rice Griddle Cakes. Soak over night one quart of cold, boiled head lice, in four or five gills of milk or water; the next morning add one quart of milk, and stir in nearly as much flour, and two eggs well beaten. Bake on a soap-stone griddle. Fine bread crumbs or rusked bread, mixed with the rice, improve this cake. 36. Wheat and Indian Griddle Cakes. These are made, in all respects, like No. 33, except that the meal is composed of equal parts of wheat and Indian. Those who have to use iron griddles, can prevent the batter from adhering by dusting them with flour; olive oil is much better than butter for the same purpose. 37. Oatmeal Cake. Mix fine oatmeal into a stiff dough with milk-warm water; roll it to the thinness almost of a wafer; bake on a griddle or iron plate placed over a ilow fire for three or four minutes ; then place it on edge before the fire to harden. This will be good for months, if kept in a dry place. Like the wheat-meal or hard crackers, it is an excellent article to cxerciso too sedentary teeth upon.

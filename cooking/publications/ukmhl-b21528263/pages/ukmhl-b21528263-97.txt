93 Aliments, or Foods Proper. Sorrel—Dock—Varieties of Ithubard—Seasoning Herbs. The leaves of the Chenopodium [Chenopodium quinoa), to which the New Zealand variety has some resemblance, are esteemed both in this country and Europe. The seeds of the yellow variety are used as a substitute for millet. The Sorrel (Rumex acetosa) is sometimes eaten as spinach, though it is too acid to be agreeable to most palates. Stewed and sweetened, it makes very pleasant pies. Wood sorrci (Oxalis acetosella) yields oxalic acid combined with potash. It is obtained in the dry state by simple evaporation, and is then called salt of sorrel. It has also been called the essential salt of lemons, and used as a substitute for lemons in making acidulous beverages. This salt is useful in removing spots of ink or iron-molds from linen. Some varieties of Dock [Rumen) are sometimes eaten, though rather sour and harsh. The Patience Dock (Rumen patienta) is a hardy perennial plant, called by the Germans winter spinach. The Rhubarb [Rheum) is employed both as a spinach and for making tarts and pies. It is strongly though pleasantly acid. The varieties usually cultivated in our gardens are the Rheum rhaphonicum and Rheum hybridum. This plant also contains some proportion of oxalic acid. A variety called Rheum undulatum is said to be of the finest flavor. The Rheum palmatum (fig. 75, see page 94) is the plant whose root is used in medicine. The foot-stalks of its radical leaves are much smaller than those of the other kinds; hence it is not cultivated for mere culinary purposes. Seasoning Herbs.—There are many sweet or savory herbs used as seasonings or condiments which may be properly mentioned here, though I do not consider them either dietetical or useful. They may be medicinal; but in the hydropathic system all such medicine is considerably worse than useless. The principal articles of this class are Sayc, Thyme, the Mints, Dill, Fennel, Tansy, Marjoram, Tarrago, Nasturtium, or In-

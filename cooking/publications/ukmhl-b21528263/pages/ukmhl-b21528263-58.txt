Indian Corn, or Maize (Rea Mays), was found native when this country was first discovered, and it now constitutes the p'itr. 28. principal bread corn of a large portion of the United States, Mexico, and a great part.of Africa. The varie- ties chiefly cultivated in America are, the yellow in the Northern, and the white in the Southern and Western States. The latter is much the largest, the stalk growing from seven to fourteen feet in height. Physiologists are divided in opinion about the nutritive value of corn as compared with other g ains, but experience seems to have settled the question long ago ; for the American and West Indian laborers, and the athletic peasantry of the Tyrol, who subsist mainly upon it, think no other ear of cobu. bread as strengthening. Corn-meal contains but little gluten, and therefore will not make good fermented bread unless mixed with the meal or flour of rye or wheat. Most of the Indian meal in our market is ground too fine at the mills. Such meal, made into cake or bread, is soft and clammy, whereas that made of coarse-ground meal is light, dry, and much more §avory. Hominy is a preparation coarser than meal, and samp is made by breaking the kernels into still coarser particles. Green Corn is a favorite and not unwholesome article of food. For the purposes of roasting or boiling in the ear, the sugar or sweet corn is the best. Probably no single article of diet can supply nutriment with so little labor or cost as In- dian corn. Unfortunately, most of it cooked in this country is poisoned with that pernicious article, saleratus, which is em- ployed in cooking it. In the Southern and Western States corn-bread is sadly deteriorated by the plentiful admixture of

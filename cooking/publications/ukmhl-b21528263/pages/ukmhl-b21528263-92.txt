ss Hydropathic Cook-Book. Renovation of the Potato Crop—Artichoke—Tain—Radish. hensions are seriously entertained that the crop will he ulti mately destroyed. Various speculations have been published relative to the causes and remedies; but they are in the main extremely fanciful. I am fully of opinion that the vegetable kingdom degenerates very much after the manner of the ani- mal kingdom, and that the principal, if not the exclusive, cause of the trouble with the potato is the planting of poor or im- perfect tubers. Nor can I see any rational way of effecting a cure, except by reproducing the potato in its pristine vigor from the balls or seeds. Three years will suffice in this way to renovate the crop completely. 1 am informed by Mr. D. A. Buckeley, of Stone Hill Farm, Williamstown, Mass., than whom no man raises finer potatoes, that this is the method he has pursued for a long time, writh invariable success. The Artichoke.—There are two plants of this name—the Jerusalem (Ilelicansus tuberosus), and the Garden (Cynara scolymus); although, botanieally, they are in no way allied to each other. The former is a native of Brazil, but has been cultivated in most parts of America and Europe. It resem- bles the potato more nearly than it does any other tuber, but is not so mealy nor nutritious. The garden artichoke is but little used, though no doubt cultivation would do as much* for it as it has done for the potato. The Yam.—The Yam (Dioscorea sativa) grows in wild lux- uriance in the island .of Ceylon and on the coast of Malabar. It is also extensively cultivated in the West Indies and in Africa! The root is farinaceous, like the potato, more nutri- tious, and is eaten, roasted or boiled, as a substitute for bread. The root is palmated, and divided somewhat like the fingers of the hand. A variety called the winged yam is often three feet long and weighs thirty pounds. The Radish.—The Radish (Raphanus salivas) is used

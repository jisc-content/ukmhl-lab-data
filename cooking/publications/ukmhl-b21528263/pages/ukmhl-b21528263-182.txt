178 Hydropathic Cook-Book. Raised Pie Crust—Pumpkin Pies with Eggs and with Cream. 85. Raised Pie Crust. Mix with half a pint of sour milk either fine or coarse flour, or equal parts of both, to make a thick batter; then add half a tea- spoonful of bicarbonate of soda, previously dissolved, and stir in flour enough to form the dough or paste, as rapidly as possible. This is not as wholesome as the preceding kinds. 86. Wheat and Rye Crust. Take half a pint of -wheat?n flour, half as much rye-meal, one gill of sweet cream, and water enough to form a still paste. It may be improved, perhaps, by the addition of one good mealy potato. 87. Bread Pie Crust. Pour boiling milk on light stale bread or biscuit; let it re- main closely covered till cold; then add a little sweet cream or salad oil, and as much flour as will make a paste of the proper consistence. 88. Pumpkin Pie with Eggs. All kinds of pumpkins, domestic or foreign, make very good pies. But the best in this market are the West Indian. Pare the pump- kin; take out the seeds carefully without scraping the solid part of the fruit; stew until it becomes soft, and strain through a sieve or colander. Beat up one egg for each pint of milk; stir the beaten egg and milk with the stewed fruit until it becomes as thick as can be stirred rapidly and easily; sweeten with molasses or brown sugar, and bake without an upper crust, an hour, in either deep or shallow plates, in a hot oven. Note.—When a singp or under crust only is used, it should be made thicker than when two are used, and also rimmed or raised on the edge. 89. Pumpkin Pie with Cream. Prepare the fruit as in 88, and instead of eggs use one gill of sweet cream to each quart of milk.

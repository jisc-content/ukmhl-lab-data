Hydropathic Cook-Book. 110 Preservation of Vegetables—Refrigeration—Scalding—Drying. Preservation of Vegetables.—During the hot season various kinds jof vegetables, as peas, beans, cucumbers, squash- es, etc., may be preserved for days in a room attached to an ice-house. The temperature, however, should not be so low as to freeze them. Various kinds of roots, stems, tubers, and leaves may be preserved by simply cutting them in thin slices and drying; but as most of them will keep in the green state long enough in a cool, dry cellar, or buried in the ground be- low the freezing-point, it is hardly worth the trouble to dry them. Potatoes, turnips, carrots, parsneps, beets, cabbages, etc., will keep nearly the year round in either way. The stalks of rhubarb or the pie plant can be conveniently dried and kept for winter use. Artichokes, asparagus, carrots, cabbages, turnips, parsneps, potatoes, onions, celery, beets, and, indeed, all other vegetables, may be preserved by being scalded or parboiled, placed in bottles, then into the hot-water bath for an hour, and corked Fig. so. tight. Drying vegetables to that degree that they may be ground into flour, may be accomplished in the following manner, yet other similar methods will readily suggest themselves to any one who studies the subject. The roots are to be sliced and laid upon metal plates heated by steam.

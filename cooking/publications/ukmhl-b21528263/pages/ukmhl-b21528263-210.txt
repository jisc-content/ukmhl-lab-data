CHAPTEP XIV. PREPARATIONS OF ANIMAL FOOD. The flesh of animals affords but few dishes which can be em- ployed consistently with water-cure treatment or physiological habits; indeed, all flesh-eating is, in the strict sense, unphysiologi- cal, and a compromise with the present appetences, habits, or infirm- ities of a degenerate state of society, consequent on a wide depart- ure from, and long-continued violation of, organic laws; hence, while we “ permit” the moderate use of animal food in many cases, we should be especially cautious to make the best possible selections and preparations. 226. Beef Steak. This should be cut from the sirloin, well pounded, and broiled; but not overdone in the least. For those who have good teeth, “ rare cooked’-’ steak is the most wholesome. 227. Mutton Chops. These should be selected frem young animals, but not young lambs; well trimmed of fatty matters, and broiled in the same way as steak. 228. Stewed Mutton. Stew the chops in a little water till very tender; then dredge a little flour in the water. For feeble teeth this is preferable to the broiled chops. 229. Boiled Mutton. The leg is the best part for boiling. The time usually required for cooking it is two hours and a half. For health’s sake there is little to choose between this and the steak, or chops.

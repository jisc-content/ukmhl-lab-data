CHAPTER IX. PIES AND PUDDINGS. As usually made, pastry is one of the worst abomination:, of modern cookery; I can hardly conceive of any thing more indi- gestible than the crust of a bakerâ€™s pie. Still, a great variety of pies can be made, which are as delicious as any' one ought to eat, and which are but. a slight departure from the use of bread, fruit, and sugar, on physiological principles. 81. Pie Crust. The crust for pies and tarts may be made comparatively whole- some in a variety of way's. Any kind of flour or meal, or various admixtures of them, may be wet with water and shortened with sweet cream; or the flour or meal may be wet with milk and short- ened with olive oil. The succeeding recipes will be a sufficient guide. 82. Wheat-meal Pie Crust. Dilute sweet cream with a little water; work the meal into it until a stiff dough is formed, and roll it out to the desired thick- ness. 83. Wheat and Potato Crust. Mix equal parts of fine wheaten flour and potato flour, or of good mealy potatoes, boiled, peeled, and mashed, with sweet milk; and shorten with olive oil. 84. Meal and Flour Crust. Take equal parts of Graham and fine flour, and wet into a dough with diluted sweet cream. 8*

One man can pick and hull one hundred quart boxes in a day.

Some are mostly hov^s ranoa. staminatc, and will in no case produce large crops; others are pistillate, and alone will yield but little, and that imperfect fruit; but with a perfect, orstaminate, kind to fertilize them, they will yield larger crops than can be obtained even from perfect kinds.

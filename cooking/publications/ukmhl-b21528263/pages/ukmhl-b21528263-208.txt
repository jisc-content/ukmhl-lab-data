Stewed Cranberries. Wash and pick the berries; stew them in just as little water as will prevent their burning, till they become soft; then add half a pound of sugar to a pound of the fruit, and simmer a few minutes. 216. Blackberries. When very ripe and sweet, a little sugar dusted over them is a sufficient preparation for the table. If sour, or not quite ripe, they should be stewed till soft, and moderately sweetened. The same rules apply to all berried fruits for which recipes are not given. 217. Whortleberries. Many prefer these uncooked and unseasoned. If stewed, how- ever, they require but very little sweetening. 218. Raspberries. Red raspberries are never fit to be eaten till ripe, and then they require neither sugar nor cooking. Black raspberries, when quite ripe, are also best in a u state of nature/’ If not entirely ripe, they may be stewed a few minutes, and sweetened with a very little sugar or molasses. 219. Strawberries. Stewiiig is always an improvement to this fruit, especially for invalids, unless it is “ dead ripe. As wro usually find them in our city markets, they are picked before the ripening process has ma- tured them, and hence require considerable .sugar. 220. Gooseberries. Though very acid fruits, especially half-grown, are not to be rec- ommended to invalids, as a g( neral rule; yet I find that many who are “on the sick list” cai use stewed gooseberries without discomfort, and nearly all well persons can do the same. They should be cooked till thoroughly softened, and sweetened till palatable.

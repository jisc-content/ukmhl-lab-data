Hydropathic Cook-Book. 32 Cleaning Filtering Apparatusâ€”Cusk Filter. a layer of small pebbles, then coarse sand, then layers of char- coal, then fine sand and charcoal, the whole covered by a cloth also fixed just below the aperture b. The water is put in the division a, passes below the first partition, and by its pressure rises through the perforated plate or cloth, c, also through the pebbles, sand, and charcoal, and passing through the cloth above, runs through an aperture in the partition b, into the last division, from which it is drawn as wanted. All kinds of filtering apparatus may be cleansed by making the water pass in the contrary direction. Thus in fig. 4, fill the division b with impure water, and it will wash all the accumulated impurities of the filter back to the division a, from which they may be drawn off. * An easy method of filtering water coming from a roof or any surface above the apparatus is shown in fig. 5. Two cross partitions made of wood, which is perforated with holes, burnt by a hot iron, are introduced into a cask, as at a, b. Over each partition is placed a piece of woolen cloth, and between them layers of coarse and fine sand, and of charcoal; c is a pipe from the roof, the water from which passes through the filtering materials and may be drawn off at b. By plac- ing another cistern on a higher level, as d, to receive the water Fig. 5. first, it will descend through the pipe, e, enter the cask at b, and by the pressure of the water in cl will ascend through the filtering materials to a, and thus be doubly filtered and more completely purified. By placing a tunnel at f water may be poured into and filtered through the cask, independent of any supply from the roof. When the sand requires clean- ing it must be taken out and washed

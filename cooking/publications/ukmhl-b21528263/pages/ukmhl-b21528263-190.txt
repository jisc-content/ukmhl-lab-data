CHAPTER X. W HOLE QKAIN8 AND SEEDS. Quite a variety of excellent dishes may be made of whole grains and seeds, by simply boiling or roasting; and for those who insist on more complicated cookery, seasoning with a little milk or salt may render them sufficiently palatable. 133. Boiled Wheat. Take good plump wheat; wash it perfectly clean, and pick out all smut, cockle, blasted grains, etc.; boil it in pure soft water., until the grains are softened through, which process will require several hours. It may be eaten with or without cream, sugar, molasses, or milk. Rye and barley may be cooked in the same way. 134. Boiled Rice. Be careful and select for this purpose the large, plump kernel called head rice; boil it in pure soft water and in a covered vessel about twenty minutes, stirring it gently occasionally; then set it off from the fire, and in a place just warm enough for it to simmer; let it remain an hour and a half without stirring; the grains may then be taken out full and unbroken. 135. Parched Corn. The most convenient method of parching corn is, to put the grains in an apparatus made of wire on purpose, called “ corn parelier,” and hold them over burning coals, shaking or turning them continually. Most of the parched corn, or “dyspepsia corn,” sold at the fruit stands, has a very salty, greasy taste, owing to its having been seasoned with .alt and hog’s lard, on the erroneous notion that such preparations would cause it to “pop'’ better, as well as taste mor« agreeaDle.

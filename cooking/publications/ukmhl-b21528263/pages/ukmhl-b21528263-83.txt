Alimknts, ok Foods Proper. 79 Varieties of Mulberry—The Pineapple—The Strawberry—Its Maiket Value. Sorosis.—The Mulberry tree- (Monts') is a native of Asia, and has been chiefly valued as food for the silk- worms. The fruit is pleasantly acid, and was highly esteemed by the Romans. It is easily cultivated, and the fruit, which is among the most delicious and wholesome of berries, is readily propagated by seeds, cuttings, layers, and roots. There are three well-kimwn varieties—the white (morus alba), employed mostly in feeding silk- worms ; the black (moru„ nigra.), whose fruit (fig. 03) is large and excellent; and the red (morus rubra), the fruit of which is small, yet very pleasant. The Pineapple (Bromelia ananus)—regarded by many as the most delicious of fruits—is a native of South America, the West Indies, and the hotter parts of Asia and Africa. Like most of the pleasantly-acid fruits, it contains both malic and citric acids in nearly equal proportions. This fruit may be raised in all temperate latitudes by the employment of arti- ficial heat. In the New York market a fair quality of the pineapple is found at almost all seasons of the year. Etzerio.—The Strawberry (Frugaria vesica) is one of our favorue summer fruits. It is peculiar to the temperate regions of the Eastern and Western hemispheres. Excellent strawber- ries grow wild on new lands in many parts of the United States ; and many varieties are cultivated near our large cities. Prob- ably Cincinnati is the greatest strawberry market in the world. A good crop yields $300 to 8500 the acre; and in some sea- sons more than $1,000 have been realized for the crop of a single acre. Among the best varieties are the Early Virginia (fig. 64), Hovey's Seedling, Mect/'rine, Duke of Fig. 64. EARLY VIRGINIA Fig. 63. BLACK MUL* BERRY.

Hy dkopathic Cook-Book. 168 Potato Cake, and Rolls—Indian Pancakes—Biscuits. 38. Potato Cake. Boil good, mealy potatoes, and when well dried mash them up with a little olive oil or sweet cream, and a proper quantity of yeast, and as much meal or flour as will make the whole into the consistency of dough; roll it into cakes, and when sufficiently light, bake in a moderate oven. 39. Flour and Potato Rolls. Take one pound of potatoes, one pound and a half of flour, two ounces of sweet cream, tlireo gills of milk, and a small quantity of yeast. Boil and dry the potatoes : mix them with the cream, and half a pint of milk; then run them through a wire sieve into the flour. Mix the remainder of the warm milk with the yeast and add the mixture to the flour. Let the dough rise before the fire; then make into rolls of any convenient size, and bake in a quick oven. 40. Indian Pancakes—Slapjacks. To ope pint of coarse sifted Indian-meal add a small teacupful of fine wheaten flour ; stir them into a quart of new milk, with three or four beaten eggs. Bake on a griddle. These cakes should not be eaten with melted butter : but instead of this, fruit sauce or a little milk may be used as a seasoning. 41. Sour Milk Biscuit. Take two quarts of sour milk or butter-milk, and three tea- spoonsful of bicarbonate of soda, dissolved in hot water. Mix the milk with sufficient flour (fine or coarse as preferred), to make a dough nearly stiff enough to roll; then add the soda and as much more flour as necessary; mold and bake quickly. 42. Shortened Biscuit. Take wheaten flour (either Graham or fine as preferred), sweet cream, olive oil, or newly-churned butter without salt, and warm milk and water—equal parts. Mix into a thin batter; add hop or potato-yeast, and thicken with flour or meal. When light enough, bake in a slow oven.

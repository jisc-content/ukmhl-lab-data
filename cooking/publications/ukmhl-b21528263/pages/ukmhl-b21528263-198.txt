CHAPTER XII. ROOTS AND VEGETABLES. 166. Boiled Potatoes. Wash the potatoes without cutting them; put them in boiling water, with not more of the water than is sufficient to cover them ; boil moderately until they are softened so that a fork will readily penetrate them ; pour off the water, and let them stand till dry. Young potatoes of medium size will cook in about twenty-five minutes ; old potatoes require double the time. When peeled, they will cook in about half the time. All who would have potatoes well-cooked must observe the fol- lowing particulars: Always take them out of the water the mo- ment they are done. Ascertain when they are done by pricking with a fork, and not leave them to crack open. When cooked in any way, they become heavy' and " watery” by cooking them after they are once softened through. ■ They should be selected of an equal size, or the smallest should be taken up as fast as cooked. Potatoes should never be boiled very hard, as it is apt to break them; nor should the water stop boiling, as it will tend to make them watery. Old potatoes are improved by soaking in cold wate several hours, or over night, before cooking. They should never re main covered after having been roasted or boiled, to keep them hot 167. Boiled Peeled Potatoes. Pare, wash, and soak them an hour or two in cold water; boil slowly in just water enough to cover them, keeping the vessel un- covered; as soon as a fork will pass through them, pour ofl the water, and let them steam five minutes. This method of cooking renders the potatoes mealy and dry.

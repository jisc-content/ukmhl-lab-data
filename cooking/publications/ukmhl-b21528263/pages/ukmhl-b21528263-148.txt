The question has been lately discussed in the medical world, whether the feces are a secretion from the blood, or the indigestible portions of the food taken into the stom-- ach. In my opinion they are niQKSTivB apparatus. both ; the proportions of each varying as the food is more or less nutritive or concentrated. Fecal accumulations in the large bowels, particularly in the cells of the colon, inducing ulcerations, abscesses, piles, fis- tulas, concretions, worms, cholera, bilious cholic, dysentery, etc., are very common with those who use constipating food, of which superfine flour is the chief article. I have never known any of these complaints, worth mentioning, in persons whose diet has uniformly been unbolted farinaceous preparations, with the free use of fruits and vegetables. The large intestines are much shorten- than the small, the ctecum being only from two to six, the colon about five, and the rectum about eight inches in length; and their mucous mem- brane is disposed into apartments or cells, by which the descent of the excrementitious matter is moderated and regulated.

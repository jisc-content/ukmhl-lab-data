The Pear (Pyrus communis), is a hardy tree, even more so than the apple, and will grow on almost any soil. It has been known to live sev- eral hundred years. The Endicott pear tree, imported by Gov. Endicott in 1C28, is still flourishing in Danvers, Mass. Near Vincennes, 111., is a tree ten feet in circumference, which in 1834 yielded 184 bushels. Its propei cul vation appears to be very imperfectly understood, hence its duration is verj uncertain In its original state the fruit was au- stere and almost innutritious ; but cultivation has developed its delicious and nutritive properties. Almost all kinds of pears grow well, grafted on the quince. Many varieties have been tried, and some have attained excellence. Dietetic writers in general, and medical men in particular, seem to regard the whole list of pomaceous fruits, if indeed they do not so regard all fruits, as doubtful, if not dangerous, articles of nourishment. The following conflicting, not to say ridiculous, notions of eminent medical authors are in point. . Pereira says, “ Apples and pears are very agreeable fruits, but they are not in general regarded as easy of digestion.” Professor Lee says, “ Although apples are very generally used in the raw state, yet we have much doubt as to their being easily digested, especially by the dyspeptic.” Dr. Forsyth remarks, “Pears are of a more flatulent tendency than plums, peaches, or apricots, especially the hard winter pears, which are eaten at a time when the stomach requires stimulating rather than cooling food.” And Dr. Bell observes, “The apple is inimical to the dyspeptic, the rheumatic, the gouty, and those troubled with renal and cutaneous diseases.” Per contra, Dr. Beaumont’s experiments prove that apples, even when raw, are readily digestible,, Fig. 48.

Hand-mills or common coffee mills will answer for making cracked wheat for family use; and enough for an ordinary water-cure establishment may be ground in the largest-sized coffee mills which are kept at the hardware stores. When wheat-meal is manufactured at the flouring mill, the miller ought to understand that the stones should be wrell sharpened so as to cut the whole grain into fine particles, in- stead of mashing it, as will happen when the stones 'are dull. In the former case the bran is cut up and mingled with the fine flour, and in the latter it is separated in flakes or scales. This will never make good bread, for, besides the rough and uneven appearance of the loaf, the particles are not uniformly mixed with the yeast or other risings, the consequence of which is that some parts of the loaf are over-fermented while others are not fermented enough. Rice (Oriza Sativa) probably affords more human beings nourishment than any other aliment in existence. It is a plant of Asiatic origin, and is the principal food of the people of India and China. Common rice is a marsh plant, though in some countries a, variety called hill rice grows on the slopes of hills. Carolina rice is the best in the New York and Lon- don markets, and the large plump seeds called head rice are the most highly^ prized. In its growth, rice resembles bailey very nearly. It rises to the height of about a foot and a half, and then branches into sev- eral stems, at the top of which the grains form in clusters, as seen in fig. 24. Wild rice, called by the Indians meno- mcme, grows abundantly along the branch- Fig. 24.

Introduction. xiu Soups, fish, ana birds, of many a kind, A pig, with skewers its joints to bind— A hare, with parsley stuck on its nose— And snipes and pheasants all laid in rows. Huge limbs of pork, beef, mutton, and veal Were sliced by the flourish of sharp-edg’d steel; The well-charged plates were borne around By valets, in coats with gilt lace bound. Many a beggar might live on the steams That danced in the hall on the wax-light beams , But he must have a most delicate smell, Who by its strange odor the dish could tell. * * * * * A terrible shriek stirs the steam and air That circle around the lady fair : The guests all about the table rise, Gaze toward her with dread surprise. “Pray, sit, my good lords,” at length, quoth shs, “ And, kindly, I pray, don’t question me !” And glad were they when the fright was o’er, To turn to the sumptuous feast once more. In vain did the lady strive to eat Delicate morsels of richest meat; A dreadful sight met her constant view— She had bitten the hateful cockroach through ! Then to her in the steam from a bright tureen Was the ghost of the luckless cockroach seen ; While confusion in her ears did ring, The sprite of the cockroach seemed to sing: “ Lady ! why gave you that terrible shriek ? Why rolled your eye, and paled your cheek ? Why dread to bite a poor worm like me, But eat sheep and swine most greedily ? “ Oh, delicate lady, oh, sensitive fair. See the table strewn with carcasses there^- Mangled and torn, all flesh from bone— Oh, leave such horrible feasts alone !

Fig. 6. A cask is hung on an axis so that it may be turned like a barrel churn. A short, hollow, cylin- drical piece, b, is fixed on the lower part to contain a piece of sponge. Connect with this, b;y means of a flange and screws, a pipe, c, to supply water from a cis- tern above. The water will rise through the sponge and sand, and may be drawn off at d. The same may be cleaned by taking out the pipe and sponge, stopping up, temporarily, the aper- ture, and giving the cask, partly filled with water, several turns with the wrench. A still more simple filtering ap- paratus is shown in fig. 7. Any convenient vessel, as a, b, may be fitted with three partitions. The upper one should have an aperture with a sponge stuff il into it, e, to. retain the coarser impurities; the two lower partitions made of wood and perforated with small holes by a red-hot iron, and covered with woolen cloth. Between these two sand and coarsely-powdered char coal are put. A hole is made in the bottom vessel at c, through which tho filtered water may be caught. Any jar, watering-pot, or other conveniently shaped vessel may answer for filtering through sand BOX FILTERING APPARATUS. Fig. 8. i Ml FILlRfi.

198 Hydropathic Cooy-Book. Jerusalem Artichokes—Preparations of Beet-root—Asparagus. 185. Jerusalem Artichokes. Wash and brush, but do not peel them; boil them after tne rules for boiling potatoes: dry, peel, and wash them, seasoning with milk or cream. 186. Boiled Beet-root. Wash the roots carefully; avoid scraping, cutting, or breaking the roots, as the juice would escape and the flavor be injured; put them into a pan of boiling water; let them boil one or two hours, according to size; then put them into cold water and rub off the skin with the hand, and cut them in neat sli ;rs of uniform size. Good beets are sweet enough intrinsically, and need no extraneous seasoning. Note.—Beet-root must not be probed with a fork, as are pota- toes. When done, the thickest part will yield to the pressure of the fingers. 187. Baked Beets. Wash the roots clean, and bake whole till quite tender; put them in cold water; rub off the skin; if large, cut them in round slices; but if small, slice them lengthwise. If any seasoning is insisted on, lemon juice is the most appropriate. When baked slowly and carefully, beet-root is very rich, wholesome, and nutritious. It usually requires baking four or five hours. 188. Stewed Beet. Take baked or boiled beet-root; pare and cut it into slices; sim- mer in milk or diluted cream fifteen minutes, and thicken the gravy with a little wheaten flour. 189. Asparagus. Put the stalks in cold water; cut off all that is very tough; tie them in bundles; put them over the fire and let them boil fifteen to twenty-five minutes, or until tender, without being soft. No one has a right to desire a better vegetable than this, with no other preparation than boiling. It should be cooked soon after being pickel, or kept ccol and moist in a cellar till wanted.

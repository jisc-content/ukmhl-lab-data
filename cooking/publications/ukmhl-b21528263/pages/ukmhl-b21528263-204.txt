Hl'DROPATIIIO Cook-BoOk. 200 String Beans—Egg Plant—Vegetable Marrow—Salsify. 197. String Beans. When very young, the pods need only to be clipped, cut finely and boiled till tender; when older, cut or break off the ends, strij off the strings that line their edges; cut or break each pod into three or four pieces, and boil. When made tender, a little cream or milk may be simmered with them a few minutes. 198. Egg Plant. This plant is so unpalatable without an extensive range of seas- onings, that I think it not worth bothering with. The “ authorities” in cookery give us onions, butter, salt, black pepper, and red pepper, to assist in getting it down. But if a dish or aliment can not be relished without pungent and irritants enough to set the mouth on fire and the teeth on edge, this fact is prima facie evidence that it had better be let alone. If any one likes them boiled in a large quantity of water, like cabbage, or boiled and then stewed in cream or milk, well and good. 199. Vegetable Marrow. Peel the marrows; cut them in halves; scrape out the seeds; then boil about twenty minutes, or until soft; drain them in a sieve; wash them; add a little milk or cream, and simmer a few minutes. 200.

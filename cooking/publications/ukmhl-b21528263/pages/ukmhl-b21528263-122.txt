Prevalent Errors.—Medical writings are full of errors, and the public mind is full of whims concerning the nature, properties, and nutritive virtues of nearly all the substances employed as food. Much of the confusion that prevails on the subject is attributable to a loose and indefinite use of words; and not a little of the-error extant is owing to false views of the nature of the nutritive function itself.

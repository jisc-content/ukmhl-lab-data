23 Philosophy of Diet. Identity of Elements in Animal and Vegetable Protein. In view of the foregoing facts, a late English paper (Liver- •pool Mercury) remarks : In addition to tlie above interesting facts developed by an examina tion of tlie composition of the various articles of food in ordinary con- sumption, and proclaiming the respective degree in which each can be made useful in the building up of the body, is another argument pre- sented to the attention, by the advocates of the vegetarian practice of diet. It is found that all parts of the food which can form blood, and thus renew the animal structure of the body, are due to the protein compounds, which have their sole origin in the vegetable kingdom; and thus the nutritive parts of vegetables and flesh being identical, that the popular opinion of the peculiar characteristics of the nutri- ment of the flesh of animals is altogether erroneous, the nutritive particles of flesh being due to the ultimate elements of nutrition de- rived from the vegetable food on which animals consumed have fed, as shown in the works of Baron Liebig, illustrating the fact in question “ Vegetables produce in their organism the blood of all animals for the carnivora, in consuming the blood and flesh of the granivora, con- sume, strictly speaking, only the vegetable principles which have served for the nutrition of the latter.” Note.—For a brief exposition of the various arguments in support of the propositions indicated here, I must refer to another work, “ The Hydropathic Encyclopediaand for a complete demonstration of the whole subject to Graham’s “Science of Human Life,” and Smith’s “ Fruits and Farinacea the Proper Food of Man.” Much useful information may also be gathered from a work written a few years ago by William Lambe, M.D., of England, entitled, “Water and Vegetable Regimen in Chronic Diseases.” The Water-Cure Journal has recently adopted a dietetic department, for the especial discussion of all problems connected with diet, which periodical I would recommend to all who intend to keep along with the progress of the age.

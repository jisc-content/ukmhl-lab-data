Fig. 8 is a large garden-pot with a hole in the bottom, into which is inserted a small tube, or a round bit of wood with a hole in it, through which the filtered water passes into the vessel placed there to receive it. The most simple, perhaps, of" all filtering contrivances is Fig. 9. YARN FILTER. represented in fig. 9. A thick wick or skein of cotton or worsted thread is hung over the edge of a deep basin or jar; and the water follows the course ot the threads, by what is called capillary attrac- tion, leaving the impurities behind. The filtration, however, is not as complete as by other methods. The original London stone-ware filter, of which most of the similar devices seen in the shops are modi ncations or imitations, is shown in fig 10. The impure water is put in the ves sel at a, passes through the cock, £, anc drops into the projecting lip of another vessel at c, which has a movable par tition .pierced with numerous small holes A piece of woolen cloth or a slice of sponge is placed on this partition to stop the coarser impurities; the water next passes through the holes into the lower part, which is filled with bruised charcoal. ^ " In the bottom of this vessel are also holes, to enable the water to pass into a third vessel, d, vheie the water passes through sand, by which the process is com pleted. All the parts of this apparatus are easily separated and cleansed, which is, indeed, an imperial's consideration m all filters.

197 Roots and Vegetables. Preparations of Parsneps—Onions—Carrots—Artichokes. 179. Mashed Turnips. This is the.best method of preparing watery turnips, and a good way of cooking all cookable kinds. Pare, wash, and cut them in slices; put them in a pan with as much cold water as will just cover them; let them boil till soft; pour them into a sieve or col- ander and press out the water; mash them with fresh milk or sweet cream until entirely free from lumps; then put them into a saucepan over the fire, and stir them about three minutes. 180. Boii.ed Parsneps. Wash the parsneps very clean; split them in halves or quarters, and boil them till tender. Roots of ordinary size may be boiled in one hour or less. 181. Stewed Parsneps, * Wash, pare, and cut them into slices; boil until soft in just water enough to keep them from burning; then stir in sweet milk; dredge in a trifle of flour, and simmer fifteen minutes. This is a favorite dish with many persons. 182. Browned Parsneps. Cold, boiled parsneps make an excellent relish with breakfast, if the slices or pieces are browned after the manner of potatoes in No. 168. 183. Onions Onions, leeks, and some other acrid vegetables, if deprived of their pungency by boiling or roasting, may be tolerated as a part of the dietary of well persons ; but I would dissuade invalids from using them at all. With many they prove decidedly injurious. 184. Carrots. Carrots may be boiled, stewed, or browned in the same manner as parsneps (Nos. 180, 181, 182). They are, however, less pala table to most persons, without abundant seasoning. Carrots re- quire to be boiled longer than parsneps.

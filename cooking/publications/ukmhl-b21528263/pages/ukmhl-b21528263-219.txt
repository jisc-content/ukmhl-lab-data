When these pests of the kitchen are troublesome, and “ puss” is not on duty, they may often be very soon disposed of by the fol- lowing strategy: Put a ban-el with a little meal in it, in a place where they “ most do congregate.” After having been fed long enough to relieve the “ oldest and most experienced rat” of his sus- picions, fill the barrel one third or half full with water, and sprinkle the meal two or three inches deep ou the top of it.

In broiled steaks this rail) bp. accomplished by pound ing; but large, thick, roasting pieces are apt to be tough, if not well cooked. Broiling, on all accounts, is the best method of cooking all flesh-meat. Boiling, taking care to skim off any floating particles of oil, is bette than roasting; and this is better than frying, which is a method never to be recommended.” —Hydropatliic Encyclopedia. The absolute identity, in chemical elements, of pure flesh and pure blood is another argument that muscular flesh or lean meat is the best form of animal food. And as this pure blood and pure flesh are made entirely of vegetable material, this fact affords another evidence—in itself conclusive, unless it can rebutted—that the best aliment for man may be derived directly from the vegetable kingdom.

But here, again, is ample room for discrimination. Pereira tells us that the hawk andoitd are not eaten, “ partly, perhaps, from prejudice, and partly because those which touch carrion acquire a cadaverous smell”—as though the stench of putrefaction were not of itself a sufficient reason. The White-fleshed Birds.— Chicken, turkey, partridge, quail, etc. are nearly as nutritive and digestible as beef and mutton. Medical writers call their flesh “ less stimulating,” but the only stimulation of either comes from its impurity, and in this re- spect fowt, is generally worse than the best flesh.

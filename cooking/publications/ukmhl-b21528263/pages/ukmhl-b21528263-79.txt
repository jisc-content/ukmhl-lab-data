As oranges are the product of warm climates, the dietetical value of the fruit with tjs depends very much on its degree of ma- turity when gathered. They will not keep long unless taken from the trees before ripening; but when they possess a mild, rich, moderately acid flavor, they are not objectionable, though far inferior to many of our domestic fruits. The Lemon (Citrus limonum) is chiefly valued for its anti- scorbutic properties, which, indeed, it possesses hi common with all other fresh fruits and vegetables. It contains more acid than the orange, and is seldom employed except as' a mere flavoring ingredient of culinary preparations. The Citron (Citrus medica) is another variety of the same tribe of plants. The fruit is seldom used except for making acidulous drink; the rind is often candied with sugar fora sweetmeat. Fig. 60. The Shaddock (Citrus decumana) (fig. 59) belongs also to the orange family. In China, where it is indigenous, it is said to be a sweet and agreeable fruit; but in other countries, where its cultivation has been neglected, it has become soured and degenerated. The Lime (Cit- rus acida) is an- other variety of the same genus.. The V' fruit (fig. 60) is vj much smaller than the lemon. It is very acid, and the lime-juice, and most of the citric acid of commerce, are man- ufactured from it. But as vegetarian stomachs have no demand for strong acids, as mere relishes or seasonings, it must for them be re garded as among the things more curious than useful. TUB SHADDOCK.

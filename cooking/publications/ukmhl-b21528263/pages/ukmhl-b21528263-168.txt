Hydropathic Cook-Book. 164 Moist Rice, Sweet Brown, Currant, and Scalded Bread. 19. Moist Rice Bread. Mix a pint and a half of ground rice with three quarts of cold milk and water, which will reduce it to a thin gruel; boil three minutes; then stir in wheat-meal till it becomes too stiff to stir with a spoon; when blood-warm add two gills of yeast; when light, hake about one hour. 20. Sweet Brown Bread. Take one quart of rye-flour ; two quarts of coarse Indian-meal; one pint of wheat-meal—all of which must be very fresh; half a teacupful of molasses or brown sugar; one gill of potato-yeast. Mingle the ingredients into as stiff a dough as can be stirred with a spoon, using warm water for wetting. Let it rise several hours, or over night; then put it in a large deep pan, and bake five or six hours. This would be a much more wholesome “ wedding cake” than we are accustomed to have proffered us, on certain interesting occasions. 21; Currant Bread. Take three pounds of flour ; one pound of raisins ; two pounds of currants; one pint and a half of new milk; and one gill of yeast. Warm the milk, and mix it with the flour and yeast; cover with a cloth, and set it by the fire. When risen sufficiently, add the fruits and mold it; then put it into a baking tin or deep dish rubbed with sweet-oil or dusted with flour; after it has risen for half an hour longer, bake in a moderately hot oven. 22. Scalded Bread. Stir as much boiling water as will make a stiff paste into one third the quantity of unbolted flour intended to be used; add the yeast, and “set the sponge” with a little lukewarm water. When it has risen quite light, and the scalded flour has become cold, add the remaining flour, and knead well together; let it rise again; put it in a tin. and bake in a quick oven till half done; then re- move it to the upper part of the oven, where it should remain sev- eral hours—the oven being now moderately cool. It should be kept in a cool, dry place a day or two before it is cut.

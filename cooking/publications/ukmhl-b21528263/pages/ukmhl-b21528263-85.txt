The strawberry is not wholly staminate nor pistillate, like those plants that were originally and are invariably only one or the other; blit the staminate kinds have rudiments of pis- tils, and the pistillate kinds have stamens imperfectly devel- oped. Hence partial crops on such. Cultivators are aware that plants produce their fruit on pistil late flowers, and that the pollen of the staminate is necessary to fertilize them. “To Longworth belongs the honor of first publishing to the world this anomalous condition of the strawberry, and the mode of turning it to good account; and his system is now almost universally adopted. There will be living monuments to his memory while the rains fall, the sun shines, and science, equally genial, beams on the human mind.1’—American Fruit- Book., by S. W. Cole. The Raspberry (Rvbus {(locus') derives its name from The rough spines with which the bush is covered. There are several sub-varieties of the black and red berries. The American black raspberry is sometimes called thimbleberry. It is very hardy, easily cultivated, and yields excellent fruit. One *f the best kinds of the rod is the Red Antwerp (fig. 67). Among the black kinds, or rather blue-black, the Franconia (fig. 68) is deservedly esteemed. Other choice fruits are the Ohio Evcr-bear- iny, Yellow Antwerp, Fastolff, and Orange. The American red raspberry is one of the sweetest and most delicate of berries. The Blackberry (Rubus fruticosus) grows abundantly on most new lands in this coun- try and is easily cultivated in gardens. We 4* BED ANTWERP. HI AN CON I A.

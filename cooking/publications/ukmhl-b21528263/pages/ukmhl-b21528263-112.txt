108 Hydropathic Cook-Book. Concentrated or Essence of Milk—Preparation in England. Concentrated Milk.—By mixing milk with a portion of sugar, it may be evaporated to one fourth its original bulk. Prepared in this way it is sold in this city under the name of Concentrated Milk. In England it is called Essence of Milk. The “ Mechanics’ Magazine” gives the details of the process by which it is prepared on a large scale : “ Mr. Moore, an extensive farmer in Staffordshire, has, under a license from the patentee of the new process of concentrat- ing milk, fitted up an apparatus by which he manufactures annually the produce of about thirty cows. The milk, as it is brought from the dairy, is placed on a long, shallow copper pan, heated beneath by steam to a temperature of about 110°; a proportion of sugar is mixed with the milk, which is kept in constant motion by persons who walk slowly round the pan, stirring its contents with a flat piece of wood. This is continued for about four hours, during which the milk is reduced to a fourth of its original bulk, the other three fourths having been carried off by evaporation. In this state of consistency it is put into small tin cases, the covers of which are then soldered on, and the cases and contents are then placed in a frame which is lowered into boiling water; in this they remain a certain time, and after being taken out and duly labeled, the process is complete. The milk thus prepared keeps for a lengthened period. It supplies fresh milk every morning on board ship, End may be sent all over the world in this portable form ”

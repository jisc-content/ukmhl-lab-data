It contains more mucilage, and about the same quantity of sugar and starch, and only one third the proportion of gluten. The rapidity with which the seed germinates favors its conversion into malt, and is the chief reason why the brewer has cursed mankind with the abuse of this grain, instead of the baker blessing them with its use. Pot barley, used for making broth, is the grain of which the outer skin only has been removed. Pearl barley is the small round kernel which remains after the skin and a considerable portion of the seed have been ground off. Patent barley is the pearl-barley ground to flour. Rye (Secale Cereale) is much used among the peasantry of Rus- sia, northern Germany, and most parts of north- ern Eujope. It is but little employed in this country, except in some parts of New Eng- land.. It contains more gluten than any other grain, except wheat, and hence ranks next to wheat for making fermented bread. The amount of saccharine and mucilaginous mat- ters it contains has caused it to be extensively used in the manufacture of those pernicious poisons, beer and whisky. Unbolted rye-meal is somewhat more lax- ative in cases of obstinate constipation than even wheat-meal. In Germany, rye-bread is called Schwartzbrot, or black bread. The haidy peasantry of Sweden make rye-cakes, which are baked only twice a year and be- come almost as hard as a board, a principal article of food. I his gram is liable in some seasons to be affected with a morbid excrescence called spurred-rye, or ergot, which is medi- cinally or toxicologically a narcotic poison. Several epidemics have prevailed in Europe in consequence of eating rye-bread made of this diseased grain; and no little havoc has been EAR Or BYB.

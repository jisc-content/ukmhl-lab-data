Elkmknts of Food. 31 Syrup—Molasses and Treacle—Manna—Honey—Starch. Sirup is made by dissolving two pounds and a half of sugar in a pint of water. Molasses is the viscid fluid which drains from raw sugar. Treacle is a dark-brown uncrystallized sirup which drains from the molds in which refined sugar concretes. Molasses and treacle can be deprived of their peculiar rank taste by boiling for half an hour with pulverized charcoal. Sirups made with raw sugar may be bleached by filtration in the following manner (fig. 12.): A A is a wooden funnel lined with tinned copper. Above the bottom is Fig. 12. another bottom, b, which is movable, sup- ported on feet, and perforated with small holes. Over this a piece of cloth is laid. Animal charcoal, c, reduced to grains like gunpowder, is placed on the cloth. An- other movable cover, also pierced full of holes, d, is placed over the charcoal, and upon this is put the sirup, e, which is to be / purified. The sirup is drawn oft’ at the SpigOt. MOLASSES FILTER!!R. Manna is a saccharine substance, intermediate between cane sugar and hon-ey. It is the concrete juice of a species of ash (Fraxinus ornus), which exudes spontaneously, and is obtained by incisions made into the stem of the tree. Honey is a species of sugar, consisting of a crystallizable portion, and a liquid sirup which can not be solidified. Its nature is much influenced by the flowers on which the bees feed. The best known is said to be from the Peak of Tene- rifte. In some localities honey is poisonous, no doubt owing to the nature of the plants or flowers. The bees col- lect, by means of their proboscis, the sweet juice contained in the nectaries or honey-cups of flowers; and although this juice is somewhat modified by the secretions of the animal, ifc is still a vegetable substance. Dietetica.’ly, however, it is in ferior to sugar. Starch is a constituent ol the seeds, fruits, roots, stems,

41 Elements of Food. Amylaceous Preparations—Ligneous Matter—Lungin. times called Portland sago. It is obtained from the loots of the arum maculatum (wake-robin, Indian turnip). An immense variety of starchy or amylaceous preparations have been introduced into our market, under medical and commercial authorities, as light, easily digestible, and highly nutritious food “ for children and invalids.” They are not, as already intimated, to be compared with more complex ali- ments, or the whole roots, plants, grains, etc., as principal articles of diet. Lignin, or woody fiber, is found in every variety of vege table matter. It forms the skin of potatoes, the husk of vari ous berries, the peel and core of apples, pears, the bran of grains, etc. Rice contains of ligneous matter 4.8 per cent.; barley, 18.75; oats, 34; rye, 24; ripe apricots, 1.86; ripe green-gages, 1.11 ; ripe peaches, 1.21 ; ripe gooseberries, 8.01; ripe cherries, 1.12; ripe pears, 2.19; sweet almonds, 9; peas, 21.08; garden bean, 25.94; kidney bean, 18.57; potatoes, 4.03 to 10.05; cocoa-u'ut kernel, 14.95. In nothing is the modern act of cooking more mischievous than in rejecting, as innutritions, this alimentary principle. In fact, bran and other forms of lignin are just as indispensable to healthful nutrition, as are starch, gum, sugar, fibrin, etc. Medical writers often recommend its employment as a me- chanical irritant “ to stimulate the action of the bowels,” just as they do gamboge or pulverized glass, forgetful that it is just as much a component part of all food as is fibrin, albumen, or casein. To healthy stomachs it is neither irritating nor stimulating.' That ligneous matter is really nutritious, though not usually in the forms of bran, skins, etc., to any great extent assimi- lated, is proven by direct experiment, for good, wholesome, and palatable bread has been made of solid wood, dried and ground to an impalpable powder. Fun gin, the fleshy part of mushrooms, is a variety oi lignin.

Population with regard to Diet.—Another argument, and to my mind also a conclusive one, in favor of vegetarian- ism, is the true theory of population. If ever the earth be- comes very densely inhabited with human beings, a great number of such animals as are raised for food can not possi- bly coexist. And as ten times the number of “rational creatures” can be sustained on the direct productions of the earth, that could subsist indirectly on the flesh of animals, the presumption is at least very strong, that the races of domes- ticated animals will become extinct as the races of man pro- gress; just as the weaker races of the human family decline before the advancing strides of the stronger. There is cer- tainly something as revolting in the idea of a “ feast of blood” in the millennial period, as in that of a “slaughter-house in Eden,” or a pigsty in Paradise. Nutritive Value of Pood.—The prevalent opinion that flesh-meat is more nutritive than vegetable food, either as supplying ‘matter for the tissues or respiratory material, is shown to be erroneous by chemical analysis. The best ana- lytical chemists, Playfair, Liebig, Boussingault, etc., give us the following statistical illustration of the subject: Contains— Supply to tlie body— Articles of Diet. Solid mutter.

Kitchen Miscellany. 217 Brass, German Silver, Pewier, and Britannia—Fruit Stains—Iron and Ink. 266. Brass Cooking Utensils. Brass is a mixture of zinc and copper, and was formerly much used in the manufacture of cooking utensils. Recently it has been nearly superseded by tinned iron. Brass vessels, when employed, however, require all the precautions appertaining to copper. 267. German Silver. This is composed of copper, arsenic, and nickel, and is oxidized by acids. Hence the spoons made of this material should never be used in cooking processes; indeed, they ought not to be used at all. 268. Pewter Dishes. These are, also, nearly out of date. This metal is an alloy of tin, lead, and antimony, and easily acted on by acids, and acid fruits. The danger to be apprehended from their use i.s very nearly in pro- portion to the lead employed; and as this is the cheaper material, the manufacturer has some inducement to cheat, and the customer a corresponding risk of being poisoned. The safest way is to let them alone. 269. Britannia Metal. This is a compound of block tin, antimony, copper, and brass. It is not liable to corrosion by acids, and is safe for all the purposes to which it is usually applied—the manufacture of teapots, mea- sures, spoons, etc. 270. Fruit Stains. These can often be removed by wetting the stain with ammonia. Diluted muriatic acid—two parts water to one of the acid—will frequently succeed. Soak the stained part two or three minutes, and rinse in cold water. 271. Iron Mold and Ink Spots. Wet the spots with milk, and then cover them with common salt—washing the garments afterward. Delicate fabrics, when stained with ink, are rften restored by dipping them in melted < allow. 10

31 Elements of Food. Ascending Fillerâ€”Cistern and Double Cistern Filtering. Nature, the water is more perfectly filtered by an ascending motion. In descending, some of the impurities might be forced through the sand by their own gravity ; but in ascending, the force of gravitation opposes then farther progress. Fig. 2 is a very simple contrivance il- Fig. 2. lustrative of this principle. Travelers can easily avail themselves of this plan ; a, ii, c represent a curved tube, round or square, filled with sand or charcoal, or both, up to the level, c. A small flan- nel bag is put in the end of the tube at a. The coarsest impurities are retained by the flannel, the finer by the sand; and in passing upward to b, the purification is rendered com- plete. It should be noticed, that the more compact the sand and the stones the water passes, the more perfect will be the process of purification. Cisterns are often constructed in cellars, and divided by a partition, reaching nearly to the bot- tom, into two unequal parts (fig. 3). The largest division, b, is half filled with layers of sand, of various de- grees of fineness, through which the water passes, and rises perfectly clear into the division, c. A similar cistern with two partitions has been recommended (fig. 4). The partition a does not reach quite to the bottom, and the other, b. has an aperture. A piece of perforated metal, stone, wood, ot a cloth, is fixed in tF' middle division, a little above the bottom. On this is placed Fig. 8. a 3 .. CISTERN FILTERING. Fig. 4.

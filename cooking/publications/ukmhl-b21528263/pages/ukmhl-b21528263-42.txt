Iceland moss contains 44 parts in 100 ; tapioca, 7 to 25; arrow-root, 12 to 20 ; yam, 12; bread-fruit, 3; bar- ley-meal, 07; oatmeal, 59; wheat-flour, 50 to 72; wheat- bread, 53; rye-meal 01 ; maize, or Indian corn, 80; rice, 32 to 85 ; peas, 34 ; beans, 35 ; potatoes, 9 to 18. Corn-starch is now being extensively manufactured, as it is much used as an article of diet. Of course its nutritive value is far inferior to that of the whole grain. Indeed, the value of all amylaceous preparations as food for invalids is commonly greatly overrated. The different kinds of starch in market are sago, tapioca, arrow-root, rice starch, wheat starch, corn starch, potato starch, and lichen in, or feculoid, obtained from Iceland moss. The cassava bread, used in Brazil, Guiana, Jamaica, and other places, is a preparation of the whole roots of the plant which yields the tapioca. The appearance of starch grains as magnified by the micro- scope, has attracted much of the attention of analytical chem. ists, and so far as the investigation of any principle pertaining to the philosophy of eating is concerned, such examinations may be regarded as rather curious than useful. The facts developed are, however, of importance in enabling us to de- monstrate with mathe- matical precision, the principles in physiology which are established by other methods of investi- gation. Fig. 13 represents the grains of the Tons let Mois, or canna starch. It is imported from St. grains ;f canna staucu. Kitts, and is prepared by a troublesome and tedious process from the rhizome of the ranna coccinea of botanists. Fi<r. 13.

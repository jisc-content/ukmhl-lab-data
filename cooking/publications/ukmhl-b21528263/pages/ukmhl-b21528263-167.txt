163 Bread and Bread-making. Tolato, Ryo aud Indian, Ayple, Pumpkin, and Rice Bread. 14. Potato Bread. Boil and peel a dozen mealy potatoes ; rub them through a sieve; mix them thorough])' with twice the quantity of flour or meal; add sufficient water to make a dough of the ordinary consistence; ferment in the usual way with hop, potato, or pea yeast, and bake in a rather hot oven. 15. Rye and Indian Bread. Rye and corn may be mixed in any proportions, to suit the taste or fancy. The practical rule to observe in making it is, that when the proportion of rye is the largest, the dough must be stiff and molded into loaves; but when the proportion of corn is the largest, the dough should be made soft, and baked in deep earthen or tin vessels. The greater the proportion of Indian or com meal, also, the longer the' bread requires baking. If it is half or two thirds Indian, it will need to be baked from two to three hours. The best way to mix the dough is to pour boiling water over the Indian, and stir it till the whole is thoroughly wet; and when about milk-warm, add the rye-meal or flour, with the yeast, and as much more warm, but not hot water, as may be necessary. 16. Apple Bread. Boil to a pulp one dozen well flavored, sweet, or moderately tart apples ; mix the fruit with twice its quantity of wheaten flour or meal; ferment and bake in the usual manner. This bread is very light, porous, and palatable. 17. Pumpkin Bread. Stew and strain the pumpkin, stiffen it with a little Indian-meal, aud then add as much more wheaten flour, with the necessary quantity of potato-yeast; bake two hours. This is an excellent and wholesome bread. 18. R,ice Bread.

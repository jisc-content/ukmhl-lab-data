CHAPTER II. ELEMENTS OF FOOD. Alimentary Principles.—All alimentary substances are composed of certain constituent parts, which aiay be properly termed alimentary principles. These are formed by certain combinations of elementary cpnstituents, which are denomi- nated chemical elements. Alimentary principles are often call- ed proximate elements or principles of food, and chemical ele- ments are frequently termed ultimate elements of food. Thus wheat, beef, potato, apple, etc., are aliments or foods proper; and starch, sugar, gum, gluten, fibrin, albumen, casein, gelatin, etc.—their constituents—are proximate elements or princi- ples. The proximate constituents of food are alimentary prin- ciples, while oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, carbon, etc., into which these alimentary principles are resolvable by analysis, are chemical or ultimate elements. Chemical elements are regarded as simple substances only, because in our present state of chemical knowledge they have never been decora posed. Proximate elements of food are compounds of the simple or chemical elements, and aliments or foods proper are compounds of the proximate principles. Pareria divides alimentary substances into chemical ele- ments, alimentary jorinciples, and compound aliments. This arrangement is based on a false philosophy, and is very liable to mislead the superficial inquirer. The truth is, all alimentary substances are compounds of alimentary principles; but this does not make them compound aliments. We might as well call the oxygen and hydrogen of water, aqueous prin- ciples, and the water itself, compound drink ! Aliment and food are synonymous terms, but each represents a simple

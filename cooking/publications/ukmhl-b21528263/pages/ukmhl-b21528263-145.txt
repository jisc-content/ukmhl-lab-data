Theory of Nutrition. 141 Arrangement and Course of the Lacteals. When the mucous coat of the small intestines is examined several hours after a meal, the lacteal vessels are seen turgid with chyle, and covering its entire surface, as represented in fig. 95. 1. Smaller branches of the lacteals. 2. Larger branches, formed by the union of the smaller. These vessels, which are so numerous, and of such magni- tude as to sometimes almost conceal the ramifications of the blood-vessels, anastomose freely with each other, forming a network, from the meshes of which proceed branches, which, successively uniting, form larger and still larger trunks; and these, perforating the mucous coat, pass for some distance between the mucous and muscular coats, finally perforating both coats, and passing to the outside of the intestine, and, with it, are included between the layers of the mesentery, as seen in fig. 96.

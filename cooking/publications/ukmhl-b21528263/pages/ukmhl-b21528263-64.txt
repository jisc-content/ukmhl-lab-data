60 Hydropathic Cook-Book. Peaches and Peach Orchards—Freestouea—Clingstones—Shortening-in. Drupes.—The Peach (Amygdals persica) is a native of Persia. The tree is of rapid growth but short-lived. It often nears fruit the third year, and in some instances the second year, from the seed. The most extensive peach orchards in this country arc found in New Jersey, Delaware, and Alary- land, from which the New York and Eastern markets are prin- cipally supplied. In New England it is an uncertain fruit, FiS- s8- although some fine specimens have been rais- ed as far north as tlfe State of Maine. The best peaches have a fnm flesh, thin skin,deep bright color toward the sun, with a yel- lowish-green op- posite. They are divided mtofree- stones and cling- stones. The for- thb peaob. mer, in which the flesh easily separates from the stone, are regarded as generally the best flavored. The method of pruning peach trees, called shortening-in (fig. 34), procures not only a beautiful tree, but early fruit and abundant foliage. The young leaves of the peach are often used in cookery as a flavoring ingredient. The varieties of the fruit are almost innu- merable ; two or three hundred have been enumerated in the catalogues of horticultural societies. Fig. 84. SUOBTENINO IN.

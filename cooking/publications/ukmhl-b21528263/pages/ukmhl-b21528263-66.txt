About a dozen varieties are raised in the United States. Apricots are abundant, in the wild state, in China and Japan, and in the hills adjacent to the Ganges. The Cherry (Cerasus duracina) is a native of most tem- perate countries. More than two hundred varieties of trees are enumerated, from the small choke-cherry shrub, to the vast black- cherry forest tree. The common cherry tree (Cerasus vulgaris), fig. 37. is of a mode- rate size and spreading form. Some varie- ties of the tree are very ornamental. Al- most all kinds of cherry shrubs and trees bear a pleasant and wholesome fruit. The most valuable varieties are easily propagated by budding and grafting. In our markets, the cultivated berries are found from the last of May to about the middle of July; and are usually retailed at six to twelve cents a pound. Fig. 38 is an outline of one ot the best varieties of the fruit, called Ohio Beauty. My friend, Mr. E. Cable, of Cleveland, Ohio, who has given great attention to the cultiva- tion of this and many other fruits, assures me the cherry can be made one of the most profitable, as it is one of the most delicious, of our native fruits. The Olive (Olivia europcea) was “ sacred to Minerva.” The tree is indigenous in Syria, Greece, and the north of Africa; and its name has many interesting his- torical associations. M ild olives, it is said, still exist on the “ Mount of Olives,” near Jerusalem. The cultivated olive (fig. 39) grows most abundantly in Spain and the south of France, but the fruit does not ripen well farther north. The Fig. 3T. COMMON CHERRY. Fig. 88. OHIO ITEAUTY.

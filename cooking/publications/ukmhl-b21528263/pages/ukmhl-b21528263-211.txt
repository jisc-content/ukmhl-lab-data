Preparations of Animal Food. 207 Preparations of Beef—Venison—White Fish—Poultry. 230. Boast Beef. The sirloin is, on many accounts, to be selected for roasting. The fatty matter should be carefully removed before roasting, as the heat renders it particularly obnoxious to the digestive organs. As is the case with steak, it is most wholesome rare done, provided the teeth are sufficient for its due mastication. 231. Corned Beef. The lean pieces are to be chosen for boiling; the “ round” is one of the best. It should be but slightly corned—not allowed to remain in brine over two or three days, and boiled till the fibers arc cut easily. 232. Beef Hash. This is made by chopping cold corned beef or beefsteak into small pieces, and warming it up with three or four times the quan- tity of cold boiled potatoes in a little water. 233. Venison. The flesh of the wild deer is usually called venison. It is at least as healthful as that of any of our domestic animals, and may be cooked in the same ways. Nearly all that we see in this market is old and discolored with incipient putrefaction, and entirely unfit for food. 234. White Fish. The cod, halibut, trout, white-fish, black-fish, perch, and a few other varieties which are not very oily nor strong, are the best. They may be boiled or broiled. The only admissiblo gravy is water with a little milk and salt, and thickened with flour. 235. Poultry. Common fowls should be stewed after the manner of mutton chops, or boiled. Turkeys are better boiled than roasted. Chickens, when tender, may be boiled or stewed. When any kind of fowl is stewed or boiled, the floating particles of oil should be carefully removed by skimming.

Aliments, or Foods Proper. 69 Tr ansplantation of Fruits—Physiological Law—The Medlar. oranges of our Southern States. The botanical name of this fruit is compli- mentary to Capt. Bligh, who, in 1793, carried it from its native country to Jamaica, where it has continued to thrive ever since. And this histori- cal circumstance affords a hint by which all our agriculturists or fruiticulturists might profit the world im- mensely. I have no doubt that transplanting and “cross- breeding” among the fruits of the earth would tend to im- provement, as the application of the same law of organization does in the animal kingdom. And notwithstanding I admit that, as a general rule, the grains, roots, fruits, aud vegetables which can be best cultivated in a particular climate or locality constitute the best food for the people of that climate or lo- cality, still every species of vegetation may be naturalized in places where it is not indigenous. Our farmers are far from being ignorant of the method of improving the breed of domestic animals ; and there is nothing more required to improve the quality of all alimentary sub- stances than an adaptation of the same principles to the pecu- liar circumstances and habitudes of plants and vegetables. And this subject has an incalculable importance in the con- sideration, that just in proportion as we improve the quality of the vege<able substances on which human beings subsist, just to that extent shall we “ improve the breed” of the high- est being in the scale of animated nature. The Medlar (Mesphilus germanica) is a native of the south of Europe, and in nutritive qualities and value resembles a small apple. The fruit seldoin ripens until after it is gathered.

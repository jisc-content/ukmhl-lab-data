N CHAPTER XIII. PREPARED FRUITS. Cook Books are singularly meager in directions for preparing fruits for the table. Indeed, they hardly recognize them as food; and only give us tedious processes for converting them into sweet- meats, candies, brandied pieties, jams, jellies, marmalades, etc. The relations of fruit to health, and the relations of cookery to fruit, are subjects eminently worthy the attention of u model house- keepers.” 201. Baked Apples. The best baking apples are moderately tart, or very juicy sweot ones. The former, of ordinary size, will bake in about thirty min- utes ; the latter in about forty-five minutes. Select, for baking, apples of nearly equal size : wipe them dry and clean; put a very little water in the bottom of the baking vessel, and place thernin a hot oven. 202. Stewed Green Apples. Apples for stewing should be well flavored and juicy. Sweet apples, when stewed, turn more or less dark colored, and hence do not appear as well as tart ones on the table, though some persons prefer them. Pare, core, and quarter ; put a little water to them, and boil moderately till quite soft, and add sufficient sugar to suit taste—more or less, according to the acidity of the fruit. Some cooks flavor them with lemon; others with a small portion of peaches or other fruits. Good apples, however, are good enough in and of themselves. 203. Boiled Apples.

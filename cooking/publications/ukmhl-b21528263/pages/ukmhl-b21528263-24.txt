But the justification is found in the fact that all are not yet sufficiently educated to carry out an ex- clusively vegetable regimen. Summary of the Veqetauian System.—An English peri- odical (Vegetarian Messenger) has happily compressed the leading propositions bearing on the subject in the following manner: The Principle.—That man, as a physical, intellectual, and moral being, can become most completely developed in all his faculties by subsisting upon the direct productions of the vegetable kingdom. The Reasons for entertaining this principle are various with different persons, but they are principally based— I. On the Anatomical Structure of Man, as described by Linnaeus, Cuvier, and other eminent naturalists, who express their conviction that man was designed to live on the fruits of the earth. II. On History, which shows that this principle was a rule of life at the happiest—the primeval—period of human exist- ence; and that wherever it has been adopted, it has proved itself to be beneficial to the human race. III. On Physiology, which shows that the purest blood, and the most substantial muscle, sinew, and bone are produced by- vegetarian diet. IV. On Chemistry, as promulgated by Liebig and other eminent chemists, showing that all nutriment whatever is de- rived from the vegetable kingdom, where it is found in the most suitable proportions. V. On Domestic Economy, which proves by chemical deduc- tion that more nutriment can be obtained for one penny from farinaceous food, than for one shilling from the flesh of animals. VI. On Agriculture, which shows the vast amount of food obtained in vegetable produce, compared with that of animal produce, on the same extent of land.

The carrot is very sweet, containing about ninety-five parts of sugar to one thousand. It is also more nutritive than tiie turnip. The orange carrot is often raised by the farmers for the purpose of coloring butter. The Parsnep.—The Parsnep (Pastinaca sativa) is, like the carrot and turnip, biennial. There are many kinds of the root cultivated, all of which are apparently modifications of one variety. The root is even sweeter and more nutritious than the carrot, and to most persons much more palatable. It is very liable to be deteriorated by improper or too much manuring, a fact, however, which applies to all of our succu- lent roots and garden vegetables. The best parsneps are of a brittle texture, \<§cy tender, and of a sweet and slightly aromatic flavor, entirely devoid of bitterness. The Beet.—Of the beet-root two varieties are commonly cultivated—the red (Beta vulgaris) and the white (Beta cicla). Of the red variety, one is round like the turnip, and’the other is long like the carrot. I have seen specimens of the latter at the Fairs of the American Institute eighteen inches long, and four or five inches in diameter. In France, a sub-variety, which is striated internally, is used in the manufacture of sugar. The white beet has very small, slender roots, and large suc- culent leaves; it is employed only as a spinach, for which it is excellent. The mangel ivurzel is a coarser kind of beet, cultivated for the feeding of cattle and milch cows. Beet-root is considered more nutritive than any other escu- lent root, except the potato; and contains about twelve per cent, of saccharine matter. The Potato.—The Potato (Dulcamara tuberosum) is of more nutritive value than all other foods which grow under

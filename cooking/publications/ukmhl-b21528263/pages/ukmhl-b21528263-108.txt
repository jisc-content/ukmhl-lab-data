Fish Aliment— Crustaceans—Mollusks—Insects—Eggs. remarks: “Persons who feed much on turtle sweat out a yellow serum, especially under the armpits.” These reptiles are wholly unfit for human aliment. Fish aliment is, in a general sense, far inferior to flesh, though, for some reason I never could divine, many dietetic re- formers who refuse to eat flesh, and some physicians who pro- hibit its employment, eat and prescribe fish v’ith unbounded license. But with those wrho will eat fish aliment there is a choice of fishes. As a general rule, the least oily are the most wholesome.

But their good qualities are rather negative than positive. When poached or fried they are among the worst things that can be taken into the stomach. Hard-boiled eggs are often pickled in vinegar and employed as a condi- ment, than which nothing can be more unphysiological in the

ENTREES. 87 quenelle meat, and then dip in chopped tongue and truffles. Put the cutlets in a stewpan, pour in the sauce, cover with a buttered paper, and cook slowly about fifteen minutes. Serve on a border of mashed potatoes, the sauce round, and the garnish in the centre. Cotelettes de Veau. Ingredients, One pound of Veal Cutlets. Parsley and Thyme. Lemon-rind. One ounce of Butter. One teaspoonful of Lemon-juice. One Egg. Pepper and Salt. Bread-crumbs. Trim the cutlets into a round shape, and beat them to half an inch in thickness with a cutlet-bat; chop up the thyme (which, when chopped, should fill a saltspoon), also the parsley. Melt the butter, add to it the chopped parsley, thyme, lemon-juice, and a little grated lemon-rind, one egg, pepper and salt to taste, and beat it all up together with a knife. Dip each cutlet into the plate and cover them all over with the mixture; then cover them with bread-crumbs and press the crumbs firmly on with a palette-knife. Fry the cutlets for ten minutes; dish in a circle on mashed potatoes, and serve with rolls of bacon in the centre and brown sauce poured round.

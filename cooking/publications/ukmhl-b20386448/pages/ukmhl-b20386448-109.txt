BNTKEES. 99 One blade of Mace. One pint and a half of Second White Stock. One ounce and a half of Butter. One ounce and a half of Flour. Twenty-four Button Mushrooms. Fried Bread. One gill of Cream. Cut up the chicken into joints and lay it in cold water for ten minutes. Put the carrot, cut in slices, the onion, thyme, bayleaf, celery, parsley, cloves, peppercorns, and mace into a stewpan, with the stock and the pieces of chicken taken out of the water and wiped dry on a clean cloth; let these all boil gently for half an hour, then take out the pieces of chicken, wash them in cold water, and dry them; strain the stock into a basin. Peel the mushrooms and cut off the stalks, and put them into a stewpan, with half an ounce of butter, the lemon-juice, and a tablespoonful of cold water; let this just boil up, and then turn them on to a plate. Put one ounce of butter and half an ounce of flour into a stewpan, and mix well together; add the stalks and trimmings of the mushrooms and the chicken stock, first taking off the grease thoroughly; stir till it boils, and let it boil gently for twenty minutes, with the lid half on; then skim off the butter which has risen to the top, and let it reduce to one pint. Add the cream, put the mushrooms and the pieces of chicken into a stewpan, strain the sauce over them, and, when quite hot, serve with pieces of fried bread round* H 2

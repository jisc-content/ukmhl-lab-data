HiGH-CLASS COOKERY. 244 Cut the sponge cakes into three pieces length- ways, putting jam between each layer ; pile up on a glass dish, and well soak them with either sherry or Maraschino. When soaked, beat up the whites of eggs to a very stiff froth; add sugar and vanilla; mask the cakes entirely over with the egg and put in a cool oven to dry; when dry, garnish with red jelly. Timbale de Fruits a la Marechale. Ingredients, One pint of Maraschino Jelly. French Plums. Oranges. Apricots. Apples. Cherries. Prepare the fruits carefully. The French plums should be stoned and stewed in claret, the apples turned into small even pieces and boiled tender in syrup, and the oranges and apricots divided into convenient pieces. When these are all ready set them with the Maraschino jelly in a fancy mould, and when cold turn out and serve.

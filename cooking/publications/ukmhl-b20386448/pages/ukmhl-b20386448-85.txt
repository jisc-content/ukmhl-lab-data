75 EKTREES. Three Eggs. One ounce of Butter. Two ounces of Flour. One gill of good Stock. Pepper, Salt, and a little grated Nutmeg. Make a panada of the flour, butter, stock and seasoning, cook it well and turn it out to cool. Take one pound of cooked hare, and pound it in a mortar with this panada and two eggs, then rub it through a sieve and stir in two tablespoonfuls of good brown sauce. Grease a mould and fill in with this quenelle meat, leaving a well in the middle, into which put three ounces of the nicest parts of the hare cut into dice, mixed with one gill of good brown sauce, the yolk of an egg, a teaspoonful of chopped mushrooms, a little pepper and salt. Cover over this well when it is filled with more of the quenelle meat, and steam for one hour. Make the sauce of the bones of the hare chopped up, and fried in one ounce of butter with a bayleaf and a little thyme, clove of garlic, onion and carrot. When the flavour is well extracted add three gills of brown sauce, a little lemon juice, a teaspoonful of red currant jelly, a few grains of cayenne, and one gill of port wine. Boil all well together, and strain over the Chartreuse. Chicken Casuala. Ingredients, One Chicken. Two ounces of Butter. One Onion.

HiaH-OiiASS COOKERY. 120 Nutmeg. Seasoning. Half a pint of Cream. Vegetables. Well wash the sweetbreads and cover them with cold water, add one tablespoonful of salt, and put them on the fire to boil for ten minutes. "Wash them again in cold water, and press them under a weight until cold; then take out the gristle, put them in a stewpan, and cover them with stock in which is a little vegetable, carrot, celery, onion, and small bouquet garni. Cover with a buttered paper and simmer gently about three-quarters of an hour; prepare the mushrooms, and with the trimmings of the mushrooms, the butter, flour, and stock, make a sauce, and let it well boil, then add the cream, lemon-juice, and seasoning. Strain the sauce and add mushrooms. Dish the sweet- breads on a croustade of fried bread, and cover with the sauce. An addition of green peas or haricots verts is an improvement, and the sweet- breads may be first larded with bacon or truffles. If larded they must be glazed with a little of the stock they were cooked in, and the sauce poured round, not over them. Rognons a TEpicurienne. Ingredients. Four Sheep's Kidneys.

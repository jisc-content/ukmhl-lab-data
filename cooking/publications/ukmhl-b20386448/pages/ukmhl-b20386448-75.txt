CURRIES AND INDIAN DISHES. 65 rice until it is quite tender. Then stir in the salt, cayenne, cinnamon, and cloves. Make a well in the centre of the rice, lay in the fowl, heap the rice on the bird, and cook all together for about forty-five ininutes. To serve, place the fowl on a dish, the rice round and a little on the bird, and garnish with the fried raisins, almonds, and onions. (The rice may not require quite the quart of stock.)

204 HIGH-CLASS COOKERY. HOT PUDDINGS AND SOUFFLES. Amber Pudding. Ingredients, Six large Apples, or one pound after peeling. Three ounces of moist Sugar. One Lemon. Two ounces of Butter. Three Eggs. Puif Paste. A few preserved Cherries. Peel, core, and slice the apples; place them in a stewpan with the butter, sugar, and lemon-rind, and let them stew slowly until tender. Then rub them through a hair-sieve. Line the edges of a pie-dish with puff-paste, and decorate it tastefully. Add the yolks of the eggs to the apple, and pour the mixture into the pie-dish. Place it in a moderate oven for about twenty minutes. Whip the whites very stiff; spread them over the apple, dredge over a little castor sugar; garnish with the cherries. Then place the pudding in a cool oven to set the white of eggs; it will take about ten minutes, and should get a light brown.

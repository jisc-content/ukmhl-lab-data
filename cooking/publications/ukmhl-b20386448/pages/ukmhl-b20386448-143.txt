SAUCES. 133 set, but do not let it boil. Add a teaspoonful of lemon-juice and pass the sauce through a fine strainer or a tammy cloth. This sauce is the foundation of many fish sauces. Bearnaise Sauce. Ingredients. Four Shalots. Half a gill of Tarragon Vinegar. Half a gill of Vinegar. One gill of White Sauce. Yolks of three Eggs. Two ounces of Butter. Chop up the shalots and put them into a stew- pan with the vinegar, and boil till reduced to a tablespoonful; then add the white sauce, mixing it well; add one at a time the three yolks of eggs, whisking each one well in before adding another, and on no account let it hoiL When the eggs are in, remove the stewpan from the fire and whisk in the butter in small pieces, taking care that each piece is dissolved before adding the next, as, if the butter is added too quickly, the sauce will oil. Strain it, and it is ready for use.

Pare off the skin, and trim the veal into an oval shape; lard this neatly and closely with lard- ing bacon; put it into a stewpan on a bed of carrot, onion, and celery cut up ; the herbs tied together, and sufficient stock to half cover the veal; cover it over with buttered paper, and stew slowly for about an hour and a half; baste it about every ten minutes. When done, place the veal on a baking sheet in the oven for about five minutes to glaze the bacon. Strain the stock, free it from grease, boil it down to half-glaze. Eemove the veal from the oven, glaze it nicely, and serve it on a bed of spinach or sorrel, and pour the half-glaze round. A fricandeau may be served with tomato sauce or macedoine of vegetables, instead of spinach, etc. Fricassee de Poulet, Ingredients. One Chicken. One Carrot. Half an Onion. One stick of Celery.

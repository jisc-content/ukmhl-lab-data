To insure good frying, the heat of the fat should be tested by a fryometer; the right heat for Whitebait is not less than 400째, for Fish from 360째 to 375째, and for Meat from 375째 to 380^. If oil is used it must be much hotter than either fat or lard. The fry- ometers and oven thermometers used in the School have the correct heats for various cookings marked on the scale, and are made by Messrs. Joseph Davies & Co., Fitzroy Works, S.E.

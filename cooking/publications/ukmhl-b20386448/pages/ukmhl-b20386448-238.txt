HIG-H-CLASS COOKERY. 228 Wine Jelly from Calves' Feet. Ingredients, Two Calves' Feet. Two Lemons. Two Eggs. Three ounces of Loaf Sugar. Four Cloves. One inch of Cinnamon. One wineglassful of Sherry. Half a wineglassful of Brandy. Chop each foot into four pieces, wash them well in cold water, and blanch them; put the feet in a stewpan with five pints of cold water. Let this boil gently for five hours, skimming it care- fully ; then strain it through a hair-sieve into a basin to set. When this jelly stock is quite cold, dip a clean cloth into hot water and wipe every particle of grease off the stock. Squeeze the juice of the lemons through a strainer into a stewpan, add the lemon-peel, the whites of the eggs, slightly whipped, the egg-shells crushed, the sugar, cinnamon, and cloves. Whisk these all together, add the jelly stock, and whisk well till it boils. As soon as it boils, put the lid on the stewpan and draw to the side of the fire for twenty minutes to form a crust. When the crust is formed, the jelly must be strained through a jelly-bag or clean cloth previously scalded. When strained, add the wine and brandy. Garnish a jelly-mould according to taste, pour in the jelly, and set

ENTREES. 103 Cut the veal into neat cutlets, and half lard each one, braise them for half an hour in half a pint of second stock, put in a stewpan with a layer of carrots, turnips, onion, celery and herbs at the bottom, placing the grenadines on the vegetables ; cover them over with a buttered paper, and baste them repeatedly while cooking. When cooked, take out the grenadines, put them in the oven to brown. Strain the stock, and reduce it to one gill. Dish up the grenadines in a circle on mashed potato, pour the stock over, and serve some nicely-cooked vegetables in the centre. Grilled Steak a la Maitre d'Hotel. Ingredients, Half a pound of Eump Steak. Half an ounce of Butter. One teaspoonful of Lemon-juice. One dessertspoonful of chopped Parsley. Salt and Pepper. Have a bright hot fire, place the gridiron over the fire to warm; grease the bars with a piece of fat, and lay the steak on it, let it cook for ten or fifteen minutes, turning it by sticking a fork into the fat, not into the meat. Mix the butter, parsley, lemon-juice, salt and pepper on a plate, into a little pat of green butter. When the steak is cooked put it on to a hot dish, and spread this pat of green butter over it.

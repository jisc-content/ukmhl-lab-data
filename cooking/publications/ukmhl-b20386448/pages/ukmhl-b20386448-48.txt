HIGH-CLASS COOKERY. 38 ture in the bottom of the mould, and a few pieces of the meat from the lobster's claws; repeat this till the mould is full. The mould must be evenly- filled. Cover with buttered paper, and steam, very gently for half an hour. Serve very hot with white sauce, poured over the souffle. You can use half a pint of cream instead of the sauce if you like to make the souffle richer. Matelotte of Eels. Ingredients, One pound of Eels. Half a pint of Claret. Half a pint of Stock. Bouquet Garni. A few pieces of Carrot, Turnip, Onion, and half a basket of Mushrooms; Stalks and trimmings to be used with the Vegetables. Salt. Half a pint of Brown Sauce. A teaspoonful of Anchovy Sauce. Cut up the eelSj and cook them for about half an hour in the claret, stock and vegetables; when cooked take out the fish, strain the stock and reduce, then add the brown sauce and anchovy sauce. Extract the juice from half a basket of mushrooms by cooking them in butter and lemon- juice, add this to the stock and sauce, then put the eels in to get hot through. Cook some button onions in some stock and butter for two and a half hours in the oven; serve these with the eels.

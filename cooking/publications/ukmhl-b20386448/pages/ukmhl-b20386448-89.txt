ENTREES. 79 Creme de Volaille, Ingredients. Half a pound of the meat from the breasts of two raw Fowls. One pint of Double Cream. Pepper and Salt to taste. Pound the meat in a mortar, add pepper and salt to taste, and pass it all through a hair-sieve. Then add one pint of double cream, half whipped, mix these well together, and steam in a well- buttered mould very slowly for half an hour. It is best to try a little of the mixture in a patty- pan first, and if it is too stiff, add a little more cream. Turn out and serve with Bechamel sauce poured round; the sauce should be made with chicken stock. Rissoles de Volaille, Prepare some mixture as for Tartelettes of Chicken, page 85, make half a pound of puff pastry and roll out very thin; stamp out a round about the size of a teacup, and put a small piece of the mixture in the centre, brush over the edge, then fold over after well egging the edges.

198 HiaH-OLASS COOKERYo One gill of Water. One tablespoonful of Lemon-juice, The Rind of a Lemon (grated). Put the apples peeled and cored into a stewpan with the sugar, lemon-juice and rind, and the water, and cook all well together, then rub through a hair-sieve. Butter the bottom of a stewpan, grate a little nutmeg in the butter, pour in the apple, and let it cook till it is like marmalade. Pour this mixture into a vol-au-vent case already cooked, and cover over with a meringue top made of the whites of two eggs well whipped, and four ounces of castor sugar stirred in; put this in the oven till the meringue top is a nice light brown. If liked, whipped cream can be used for the top instead of the meringue.

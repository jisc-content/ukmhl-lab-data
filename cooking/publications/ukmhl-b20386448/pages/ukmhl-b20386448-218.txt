208 HiaH-CLASS COOKERY. Put two ounces of loaf sugar and a half gill of cold water into a stewpan, and boil quickly, until light coffee colour, stir well and pour it quickly into a thoroughly dry, plain souffle or timbale mould, and let it coat the mould all over. Make a custard of the four yolks, two whites of egg, the castor sugar and the milk, thus: break the eggs into a l^asin, add the sugar, boil the milk, and when a little cool pour it on to the eggs and sugar, then strain it into the mould you have lined with caramel; steam it very slowly for half an hour. Turn it out on to a dish, and some of the caramel will run off and form a sauce. Can be served hot or cold. Cocoanut Pudding. Ingredients, Half a pint of Milk. Half a pound of grated Cocoanut.

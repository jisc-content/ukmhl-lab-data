Put the water and sugar in a stewpan on the lire to boil ten minutes, reserving about six lumps of sugar from the half pound, with which rub the sest from the two lemons. Strain the juice, which should measure one gill; sometimes it will take more than the quantity to make the measure. When the syrup is cold, add the lemon-juice and freeze. When half frozen, add the whipped whites of two eggs. N.B.â€”In making ices, the quantities should always be measured. Thus, in water or cream ices, to one pint of syrup add one pint of juice or puree of fruit, with the exception of lemons. The fruit should never be added hot. The cream should never be added without being whipped. Parfait au Oafe, or Mousse. Ingredients. The Yolks of six Eggs. Half an ounce of Castor Sugar. One gill of good Coffee.

175 SAVOURIES. Fry the mignonette pepper in the butter for two or three minutes; then strain the butter into a stewpan; add the flour, a teaspoonful of salt, half a teaspoonful of pepper, and a little cayenne, also the milk, and stir over the fire till it thickens. When a little cool, add, one at a time, two yolks of eggs; beat this all well together and add the cheese; whip the three whites of eggs to a stiff froth, and stir in lightly to the cheese mixture. Pour into a pint souffle-tin, previously buttered and lined outside with buttered paper coming two inches above the tin, and bake in a quick oven from twenty to thirty minutes. To serve, take off the paper and fold a clean napkin round the tin; but send it to table as quickly as possible, as it will fall as soon as it leaves the oven. Cheese Tartlets. Ingredients to make fourteen. One gill of White Sauce. Two ounces of Parmesan Cheese. Two Eggs. Cayenne and Salt. Put the yolks of the eggs, the grated cheese, cayenne, and salt into the white sauce, and mix all well together; whip the whites of the eggs to a stiff froth and stir them in also very lightly. Line fourteen patty-pans with rough puff-pastry, fill in with the cheese mixture, and bake for twenty minutes in a quick oven. Do not bang the oven- door.

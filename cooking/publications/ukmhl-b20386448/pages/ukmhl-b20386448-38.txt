28 HIGH-CLASS dOOKEBf. DEESSED FISH. GENERAL REMARKS ON COOKINa FISH. Fish should always be steamed, except the very strong kinds, such as Mackerel and Eels ; these must be boiled. In my book of " Plain Cookery Eecipes " I suggest several ways of steaming Fish in a small household where there are perhaps not many saucepans to be had. Since writing those remarks I have found a first-rate fish steamer,* made of block tin with a copper bottom and in various sizes. These steamers have a great advantage over my simple method, which is that from an arrangement under the drainer on which the fish is placed, the steam as it condenses on the lid does not drip back upon the fish and make it sodden, but falls down into the water underneath. Fish takes rather longer to steam than to boil, but it is very much nicer, as the flavour and goodness are fully preserved. Put a good tablespoonful of salt in the water, and do not put the fish into the steamer until the water * These steamers are to be bought of Messrs. Davis & Co., 200, Oamberwell Koad, S.E.

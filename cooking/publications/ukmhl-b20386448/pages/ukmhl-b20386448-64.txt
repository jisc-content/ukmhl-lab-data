HIGH-CLASS COOKERY. 54 kitchen paper. Toss the whitebait in the flour, move them about quickly, and finger them as little as possible. Then turn the fish into a frying-basket and sift all the loose flour back on to the paper. Plunge the fish into the fat, which must be as hot as possible not to burn, for one minute; shake well, and serve at once very hot. To devil whitebait, sprinkle them, when cooked, with pepper and cayenne mixed. Hand round with quartered lemon and thinly cut brown bread and butter.

This publication is a humble endeavour to afford some assistance to ladies in the daily difficulty of what to order for dinner, and how to describe it. Cooks are not generally gifted with fertile imagi- nations, and are inclined to get into a routine which is a source of annoyance to those who desire a variety of dishes, if not for themselves, at least for their friends. Ladies often wish to be ready with suggestions of a change in the proposals of the cook, and even when in some measm’e provided with these, a second difficulty arises—What are these dishes to be called? What are the correct technical names for them ? The French of cookery is a language of itself, and those who are not learned in it are often entirely at a loss when suddenly called on to write out a correct French menu with no other assistance than that of a dictionary. In carrying out this a 3VI INTRODUCTION. idea, lists of various dishes have been given, arranged in courses, with the French names, as well as the English equivalent or description. It is not intended to give recipes, such as would be adequate for the preparation of the dishes in the kitchen; the dishes are only so far described as to enable the mistress to recognize them, giving a general idea of their ingredients and of their appearance when sent to table.PREFACE TO REVISED NINTH EDITION. In thig edition a considerable number of dishes have been added, and such alterations made as are demanded by the changes of fashion. Dishes of a very elaborate character have, for the most part, been rejected. They are often merely (what a botanist would term) “sports” from well-established originals, differing from them, perhaps, only in some details of fantastic decora- tion, the fashions of which are very short-lived, and are quickly succeeded by some newer fancy. With regard to decoration, it is suggested that very fanciful effects should be avoided. In a zeal for originality in this respect, the object of all decoration—viz. to render the dish attractive— seems occasionally to be forgotten, and a contrary effect is produced. Dishes are presented more fit to adorn a confectioner’s window than to appear at a gentleman’s table.viii PREFACE TO REVISED EDITION. Compounds of preserves and ices have actually been made to represent, with painful accuracy, boiled legs of mutton, boars’ beads, etc., etc It is a mistake, too, to give fantastic names to the dishes. A menu is intended to convey in- formation, not to mislead or confuse; and few people care to bestow sufficient attention to the subject to enjoy a succession of “ surprises.” Neither is a dish more generally appreciated for bearing an extravagant name—even when under such a name as Sastartees a la Malay are revealed the homely aspects of curried veal! One is re- minded of the old saying, “ Fine feathers do not make fine birds.” Names given to quenelles, creams, etc., often have reference to the fancy moulds in which they are dressed. For instance, Petites cremes au Chevalier are creams steamed or set in moulds made to represent little horseshoes. So petites cignes, petits chevaux, papillons, etc., refer to the moulds. Even petites langues, petits jamhonneaiLx, petits poiilets, do not necessarily imply something made of tongue, ham, or chicken. Very few such names are introduced in these pages. They are obviously only the passing fashion of the moment, and do more credit to thePREFACE TO REVISED EDITION. ix skill of the ironmonger than to that of the cook. From the number of dishes described, it is hoped that it will be found easy to select such as shall be suited to the occasion for which they are re- quired, whether for homely dinners, or for more elaborate entertainments. Complete menus of the former class will be found in the author’s “ Daily Dinners,” which, with the assistance here given, may be enlarged or varied without difficulty. In planning a dinner, ladies are reminded not to be content with dishes individually excellent, without regard to the contrast they bear to one another. Variety is required, not only in the material, but also in the style of dressing, and in the accom- panying sauces and garnishes. Light and dark dishes should as far as possible succeed one another. The same sauce should not appear twice. Several sorts of pastry should be avoided. When cold dishes form part of the menu, they should be interspersed judiciously among the others. The author has adhered to her original inten- tion of giving descriptions rather than recipes. They will probably be sufficient, in most cases, to enable the mistress to give directions which aX PREFACE TO REVISED EDITION. fairly competent cook may carry out without the aid of a detailed recipe. But should they be found insufficient, recourse may always be had to some of the excellent cookery-books now published.CONTENTS. rAGR Introduction t . v Preface to Revised Ninth Edition • . i . vii CHAPTER I, Hors d’CEuvres ,1 CHAPTER II.

[P.T.O.(Prospectus. The idea of this collection of “Daily Dinners” is to save thought and trouble by suggesting entire menus for the ordinary use of people with moderate means. Dishes of a very expensive character have therefore been avoided. Nothing out of season is suggested unless it can be easily and cheaply obtained in a preserved form. Special attention has also been given to that which is frequently a rather serious care to housekeepers, viz. the utilizing cold meat for made-up dishes. The book is intended for the mistress, not for the cook, therefore no recipes are contained in it •, but in cases where the names of less familiar dishes convey no idea of their composition, a rough description of them has been given in a footnote. A reference to “ Menus Made Easy ” will often supply further information. In menus for general use, it is inevitable that various tastes have to be considered, and that dishes will be found in this collection which will not be acceptable in some families, though they would be appreciated and liked in others. In such cases it will not be difficult to find sub- stitutes in some of the other menus. Some such selections from other menus will also meet the occasion of a more considerable entertainment than usual ; as, for example, it will be easy to add an extra entrde, some small joint or roast, and perhaps a dressed vegetable. But additions such as these must not be made haphazard. Due regard must be paid to their harmony with the menu as it already stands, if the dinner is to be that which it ought always to be—not a mere means of satisfying hunger, but a carefully selected course of dishes, following one another in agreeable succession, pleasing to taste and eye.Art in Cookery.

Prospectus. This publication is a humble endeavour to afford some assistance to persons in the daily difficulty of what to order for dinner, and how to describe it. Cooks are not generally gifted with fertile imaginations, and are inclined to get into a routine which is a source of annoyance to those who desire a variety of dishes, if not for themselves, at least for their friends. It is often con- venient to be ready with suggestions of a change in the proposals of the cook, and even when in some measure provided with these, a second difficulty arises—what are these dishes to be called ? What are the correct technical names for them ? The French of cookery is a language of itself, and those who are not learned in it are often entirely at a loss when suddenly called on to write out a correct French menu with no other assistance than that of a dictionary. In carrying out this idea, lists of various dishes have been given, arranged in courses, with the French names, as well as the English equivalent or description. It is not intended to give recipes, such as would be adequate for the preparation of the dishes in the kitchen ; the dishes are only so far described as to enable the mistress( 4 ) to recognize them, giving a general idea of their ingredients and of their appearance when sent to table. If the full recipes are desired for the cook’s use, they will be found in the well-known cookery books, so many of which are now published. EXTRACT FROM PREFACE TO REVISED EDITION. In this edition a considerable number of dishes have been added, and such alterations made as are demanded by the changes of fashion. Dishes of a very elaborate character have, for the most part, been rejected. They are often merely (what a botanist would term) “ sports ” from well-established originals, differing from them, perhaps, only in some details of fantastic decoration, the fashions of which are very short-lived, and are quickly succeeded by some newer fancy. From the number of dishes described, it is hoped that it will be found easy to select such as shall be suited to the occasion for which they are required, whether for homely dinners, or for more elaborate entertainments. Complete menus of the former class will be found in the author’s “ Daily Dinners,” which, with the assistance here given, may be enlarged or varied without difficulty. The author has adhered to her original intention of giving descriptions rather than recipes. They will probably be sufficient, in most cases, to enable the mistress to give directions which a fairly competent cook may carry out without the aid of a detailed recipe. CONTENTS.

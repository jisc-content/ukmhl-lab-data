PREFACE TO REVISED NINTH EDITION. In thig edition a considerable number of dishes have been added, and such alterations made as are demanded by the changes of fashion. Dishes of a very elaborate character have, for the most part, been rejected. They are often merely (what a botanist would term) “sports” from well-established originals, differing from them, perhaps, only in some details of fantastic decora- tion, the fashions of which are very short-lived, and are quickly succeeded by some newer fancy. With regard to decoration, it is suggested that very fanciful effects should be avoided. In a zeal for originality in this respect, the object of all decoration—viz. to render the dish attractive— seems occasionally to be forgotten, and a contrary effect is produced. Dishes are presented more fit to adorn a confectioner’s window than to appear at a gentleman’s table.

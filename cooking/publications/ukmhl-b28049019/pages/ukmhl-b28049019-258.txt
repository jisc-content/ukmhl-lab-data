(Prospectus. The idea of this collection of “Daily Dinners” is to save thought and trouble by suggesting entire menus for the ordinary use of people with moderate means. Dishes of a very expensive character have therefore been avoided. Nothing out of season is suggested unless it can be easily and cheaply obtained in a preserved form. Special attention has also been given to that which is frequently a rather serious care to housekeepers, viz. the utilizing cold meat for made-up dishes. The book is intended for the mistress, not for the cook, therefore no recipes are contained in it •, but in cases where the names of less familiar dishes convey no idea of their composition, a rough description of them has been given in a footnote. A reference to “ Menus Made Easy ” will often supply further information. In menus for general use, it is inevitable that various tastes have to be considered, and that dishes will be found in this collection which will not be acceptable in some families, though they would be appreciated and liked in others. In such cases it will not be difficult to find sub- stitutes in some of the other menus. Some such selections from other menus will also meet the occasion of a more considerable entertainment than usual ; as, for example, it will be easy to add an extra entrde, some small joint or roast, and perhaps a dressed vegetable. But additions such as these must not be made haphazard. Due regard must be paid to their harmony with the menu as it already stands, if the dinner is to be that which it ought always to be—not a mere means of satisfying hunger, but a carefully selected course of dishes, following one another in agreeable succession, pleasing to taste and eye.

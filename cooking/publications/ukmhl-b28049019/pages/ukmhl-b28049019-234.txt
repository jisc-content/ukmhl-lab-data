Many of them have been mentioned in the course of these pages, and as the names frequently convey no idea of their ingredients, a slight description of them is given.

Anchois (Anchovy)—melted-b utter sauce with anchovy, etc. Aubois—a sweet sauce of syrup and yolks of eggs with whipped cream. Aurore—Allemande and tomato sauce, with Chili vinegar, etc. B^arnaise—yolks of eggs, butter, French vinegar, chopped parsley, etc. Bechamel—Veloute sauce with cream. For a maigre sauce it is made without stock. Beurre—melted-butter sauce.

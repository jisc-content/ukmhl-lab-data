216 VEGETABIAN COOKERY. 442. Boil one large carrot till tender, rub it through a sieve and mix well with two small table-spoonfuls of flour; one egg well beaten; a tea-spoonful of milk; sugar, currants, and seasoning according to taste. Line patty-pans with pastry, fill them with the mixture, and bake. OMELETS, FHITTERS, PANCAKES, ETC. 443. There is little difi'erence in these preparations, except as regards consistency, size, and the proportion of eggs employed. Omelets consist principally of eggs, and may be either fried or baked. Fritters are composed of various ingredients, usually in the state of a stiff batter, and are made smaller and thicker than omelets. Pancakes are made of a thinner batter, and consequently they spread wider in the pan than fritters. All fried articles should be well drained from the fat by placing them on a drainer, or on blotting paper, and served as soon as ready. Eggs should be well and lightly beaten, and a little salt added. When leeks, onions, eschalots, or other vegetables are used, they should be chopped small, and beaten with the eggs. "When sweet herbs are used, parsley should form a part; tarragon, or any other vegetable which imparts a high flavour, should be used sparingly, and with this precaution any sort of pot herbs may be employed. The butter or oil used for fi:}'ing should be good and quite hot. The batter should be as smooth as cream, and should be briskly beaten immediately before it is put in the pan. It is better when made some hours before it is used. For mixing the ingredients, read the directions (117, etc.). Omelets may be used cold, as sandwiches, between two pieces of buttered bread, a little mustard being added. Baked omelets when cold are excellent, if sliced and fried brown, and sauce poured over them; or they may be eaten cold with mint sauce and mashed potatoes.

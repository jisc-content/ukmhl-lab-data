BREAD. Ill Raised, btjt Untermented Bread. 124. The flour or meal of wheat is best for making raised bread, because it contains much gluten. FLOOR OR nICiR. HIDRO ACID. WATER. MEAL. SODA.

Twenty-five minims or drops by measure of 'hydro- chloric acid, if of proper strength, should exactly saturate twenty-Sve grains of the bicarbonate of soda. Mix the soda and the meal or flour as thoroughly as possible. Pour the acid into the water, and diffuse it perfectly, by stirring them well with a rod of glass or wood; then, with a wooden spoon or spatula, stir the fluid into the flour till the whole is well incorporated. Put the dough into a tin, or earthen pot, or make it into thick cakes, and b.ike immediately in a quick oven. The water should be cold, the dough as thin as it can be con- veniently handled, and the oven hotter than for fermented bread. Skimmed milk may be used instead of the water, and butter- milk instead of the acid and water. The dough thus made may be used either for baking or boiling. It may also be made into tea-cakes by using milk instead of water, and adding two ounces of sugar, two ounces of butter, and six ounces of currants, if preferred. Rub the butter into the soda and flour, dissolve the suu;ar in the milk, to which add the acid, and then mix the whole intimately, adding the ret]uired quantity of currants. Bake in shallow tins, or earthen pans. Some persons consider this method superior to fermenting the dough with yeast, as well as more economical; but Lieiug is of a different opinion, and says, " Only a small part of the starch of the flour is consumed in the production of sugar, and the fermentative process is not only the simplest and best, but also tlie cheapest of all the methods which have been recommended for renderine: bread porous."

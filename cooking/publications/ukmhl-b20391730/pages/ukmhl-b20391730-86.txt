74 VEGETAUIAN COOKERY. (3.) To PiiESEuvE Fkuit by Keeping it at a Very Low Tempeeatuee. 75. If vegetable substances be exposed to a degree of cold below the freezing point of water, the juices will be congealed and converted into ice, and during this state they cannot undergo any change whatever; hence freezing becomes a very simple and effectual mode of preserving food in many cases. Several plans have been suggested for this purpose, but few families would find it convenient to adopt them. (4.) To Pkesekte Fhtjits and other Vegetable Sub- stances WITH Sugar, Salt, and Vinegar. General Observations. 76. Enamelled stew-pans are best adapted for preserving and pickling, as they are not acted on by acids, and the colour of the fruit is not affected by them. Wooden or silver spoons and skimmers should be employed, as pewter, iron, or tin endangers the colour of the fruit. All sieves, strainers, and other vessels should be very clear., as the least inattention in this respect might destroy the flavour. Preserves and pickles should be kept in a very dry and cool place. Do not allow the preserving pan to be in immediate contact with the fire; suspend it over the fire, or let it rest on a trivet or other protector. All preserves should be well skimmed, and constantly stirred, gently at first, and more quickly afterwards; a slight neglect in these respects may spoil the whole. Unripe fruits, and such as contain little juice, should be sim- mered gently, till tender, in water or a thin syrup (69), and the syrup to be poured upon them should at each boiling be strengthened by the addition of more sugar. Ripe fruits, or such as contain much juice, require no water; they should be simmered with one-third of the sugar you intend to employ, and the syrup thus obtained should be enriched with the remaining sugar, as above.

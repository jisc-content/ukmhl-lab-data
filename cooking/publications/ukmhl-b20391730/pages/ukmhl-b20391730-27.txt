ALIMENTARY PRINCIPLES. 16 In water, between 160° and 180°, it forms an imperfect solution ; in boiling water it forms a stiff jelly; and if this be exposed in a thin layer to a dry atmosphere it becomes a translucent mass, which swells into a jelly again with water like gum tragacanth. Starch may also be dissolved by diluted acids. When boiled so long that iodine ceases to colour it, starch is converted into a substance called dextrine, which is soluble in cold water. By boiling still longer, the dextrine is changed into grape- sugar. Amylaceous aliments generally are converted by the saliva into dextrine and glucose; the latter is changed by the bile into fatty matter, and the pancreatic fluid is supposed to convert the fatty or oleaginous products into chyle. Starch in all forms contains about 0-2.5 per cent, of nitrogen, which Jaqtjelain considers essential to it. Httfeland and others have highly commended an amylaceous diet in phthisis, commonly called consumption, and in febrile and inflammatory diseases. It is very nutritive, communicating no tartness when pure, and is easily digested; but as starch swells much in solution, it should always be cooked, in order to break or split the grains, before it is eaten ; otherwise it may cause great distention of the stomach, and pass ofl' without being digested. Liebig endeavours to show that by the conversion of starch or sugar into fat, oxygen is supplied to the system ; and that by the union of this disengaged oxygen with carbon (from the bile, for example) heat is developed. 1 equiv. of Starch .

1 INTKODUCTION. In pursuance of the coramand, " Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, Â«nd subdue it," mankind are rapidly extending their dominion over the whole habitable portion of the globe ; they are denizens of every climate, and both land and ocean supply them with a dwelling place. Their food must, consequently, be of a very varied character, and much of it would be unpalatable and indigestible without some artificial preparation. Hence has arisen the art of cookery, which has been carried to such excess by complicated processes, high seasoning, and heterogeneous compounds, as often to render the food injurious rather than wbolesome. Instead of adhering to the simple diet of nature as closely as climate, the engagements of civic and social life, and other circumstances would permit, man seems to have been contriving how he could depart the furthest from it. We should, however, rather regard his present habits as the gradual and cumulative result of circumstances, before science and rational inquiry had any influence in directing them. The more highly flavoured and the more stimulating man renders his food for the purpose of pampering a vitiated palate, the greater variety and the more frequent changes will he require to avoid disgust; whereas the simpler and more natural his diet, the more enjoyment and the sounder health will he possess. All substances requiring the culinary art to develop or modify their nutritive properties, should be prepared with as strict a regard to organization and the physiological laws as possible. Each organ employed in the process of digestion has its peculiar function, and its integrity is best maintained, not by immunity

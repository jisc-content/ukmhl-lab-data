62 VEGET^BIAN COOKERY. Others may be done in a small quantity of butter or oil, this is called "sauteing''by SoTER. In tbis manner are cooked pancakes, fritters, omelets, etc. APPLICATION OF COOKING PROCESSES TO THE PREPARATION OF FRUIT, GRAIN, ETC. (1.) Fktjits. Many fruits are eaten without undergoing any culinary prepara- tion whatever, but others are improved in flavour, and rendered more digestible, by being baked, stewed, etc. To Bake or Soast Apples, Fears, and other Fruits, 67. (a.) Put apples or pears in a dish, with or without water round them, the stalk end upward; bake them half an hour or more, in a moderate oven ; or let them remain all night in a slow oven. Many kinds of pears thus baked are much improved in flavour. (b.) Divide and core apples, lay them on a dish with the flat side downward, with or without sugar under and over them, (c.) Core them without dividing them, fill up the cavities with butter and sugar, and bake them till they are sufficiently tender. (d.) Tomatoes. Cut them in slices, and place them in layers in a flat dish, with plenty of pepper and salt, and a little butter; cover them well with bread crumbs, and bake them in the oven till quite brown. The apple called in Yorkshire the Green Balsam, is excellent when roasted in a slow oven, and requires no sugar. To Scald, Codle, or Stew Fruit. 68. When fruits are stewed with a little sugar, for imme- diate or not very distant use, they are usually called "compotes;" when intended for future use, more sugar and longer cooking are requisite; they are then called " preserves," etc. Compotes may be formed after several methods, which are here distinguished by the letters a, b, c, etc.

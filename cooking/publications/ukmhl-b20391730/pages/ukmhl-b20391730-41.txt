The fruits best known in this country are apples, pears, quinces, medlars, plums, peaches, apricots, nectarines, grapes, gooseberries, currants, mulberries, strawberries, raspberries, brambleberries, whortleberries, cranberries, oranges, lemons, pineapples, melons, cucumbers, vegetable-marrows, pumpkins, and what are sometimes called spring fruit, viz., rhubarb stalks.* The principal dried fruits are dates, figs, raisins, prunes, currants, etc. The following foreign fruits are also much esteemed when they can be obtained ripe and fresh : The loquat, pomegranate, litchi, longan, rambuton, akee, guava, marmelos, water-melon, plantain, banana, mango, mangostan, bread-fruit, durion, jujube, juvia, avocado pear, anchovy pear, custard apple, papaw, etc. (2.)

In tropical climes, rice proves highly nutritious; while "the Hudson's Bay Company find, by experience, that two pounds and a-half of maize flour a day is fully equal, or even superior, in sus- taining the capacity both for muscular exertion, and for bearing â€¢ As rhubarb contains oxalate of lime, it is condemned by some chemists as likely to produce stone in the bladder or kidneys, but I do not apprehend that any danger need be feared from its use by Vegetarians ; such effects more generally arise from a free use of animal food.

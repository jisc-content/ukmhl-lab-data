Milk consists of myriads of exceedingly minute globular particles floating in a serous or watery fluid. The globules constitute butter, and may be sepa- rated by filtration, the filtered liquor being transparent. When milk is allowed to stand, the globules, along with some caseine, rise to the top in the form of cream, and when this has been removed, the remaining fluid is called skim-milk. The milk now depriTed of its cream, if exposed for a day or two to a temperature of fi-om 60° to 70°, becomes a thick coagulum, and the milk has become sour; lactic acid has been formed, which has occasioned the milk to separate into two portions, curd or cuKeous matter, and wheij. Caseine thus spontaneously produced, will not form cheese, but is wholesome and excellent when eaten with a little sugar. A little carbonate of soda, or potash, or calcined magnesia, added to milk, will retard its progress to a state of acidity. Milk boils at 199", water at 212°. By boiling milk the curd (15) is partly coagulated by the action of the oxygen of the atmosphere, and the caseine rises to the surface in the form of a pellicle or thin skin ; if this be removed it is succeeded by another, and the process might be continued till the remaining fluid would have a watery appearance, and be incapable of furnishing any more such pellicle. When milk is very slowly evaporated without boiling, it forms a kind of thick extract of milk, which is called f ranffipane; and this being mixed with sugar, almouds, and orange flowers, consti- tutes a sweetmeat or custard.

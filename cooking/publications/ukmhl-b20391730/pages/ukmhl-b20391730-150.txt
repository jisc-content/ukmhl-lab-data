The marble slab or board, paste rollers, tin cutters, stamps, and hands should be perfectly clean. For observations on the flour, butter, etc., especially for fine pastry, see 47, 134, etc. Indian meal, rice flour or potato flour, may be used advanta- geously with wheat flour. See 122, 131. A little salt or sugar or both may be added. See 55, 134. Pastry should be formed rather too dry than too moist; if made too moist at first, the crust will eat tough, and the fiour added afterwards cannot be mixed well with the paste. When too moist it is also liable to be scorched in the oven. Cold water is to be preferred to either warm water or milk for mixing with the flour (except when yeast is used), but in very cold weather the chill may be taken ofl'. Pastry should be made quickly, touched lightly, and baked as soon as possible after it has been made. The water should be added gradually, and the whole gently drawn together with the fingers of one hand ; when sufficient water has been added, the paste should be lightly kneaded till it is as smooth as possible. "When the temperature of the atmosphere is below 50°, the butter should be squeezed and worked with the hand to soften it, and it should be brought to the same consistency as the paste before it is worked in.. When the temperature is above 60°, fine pastry should be worked in the coolest place

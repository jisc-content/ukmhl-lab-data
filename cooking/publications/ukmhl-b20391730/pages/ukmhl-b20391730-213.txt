See 270. Batter Puddings. 374. The batter for puddings should be neither too stiff nor too liquid; if too stiff it cannot expand sufficiently, and conse- quently the pudding will be hard and tough; if too liquid the flour and other solid particles will descend, and the pudding will be denser at the bottom than at the top. When fruit is added the batter must be made thicker, or the fruit will sink. It is advisable to strain the batter well; the eggs first, then the whole. Flour puddings will be improved by mixing the ingredients.

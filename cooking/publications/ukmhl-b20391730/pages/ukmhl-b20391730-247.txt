SOUPS. 231 Stock. 489. Stock is a term employed to denote that part of soup wliicli becomes gelatinous when cold. For Vegetable Soups it is prepared from sago, tapioca, arrowroot, salep, and Irish moss. These substances should be well washed, and soaked two or three hours separately, and then dissolved by boiling them in water. One ounce of any one of these, or of a combination of them, may be dissolved in a pint of water, except in the case of salep, one ounce of which will require nearly four pints of water. Soups may be divided intoâ€”1. Clear Soups. 2. Opaque or Thickened Soups. , (1.) Clear Soups. 490. Make a good clear broth by any one of the methods (485, 486, or 487), then add a clear stock, or cut vegetables, macaroni, etc., which have been partially cooked. A little fried parsley is frequently put into clear soups before serving them. 1. Cut the vegetables into shreds or into small dice. Then put them in cold water, boil them five minutes, and drain them on a sieve. Add them to two quarts of clear soup (488 b.) ; simmer the whole gently till the vegetables are tender, which may be the case in thirty or forty minutes. Season with salt and cayenne ; four table-spoonfuls of mushroom ketchup may likewise be added. 2. Having cut the vegetables, wash them in cold water, then drain them on a sieve ; when dry put them in a stew-pan with two ounces of butter, and a tea-spoonful of powdered sugar; set the pan on a very sharp fire for ten minutes, shaking the contents over occasionally till they are covered with a thin bright glaze, but take care that they are neither browned nor surrounded with a whitish liquid. Pour two quarts of clear broth over them, raise the soup to a boiling heat, and let it simmer till the vegetables are quite tender, especially the onions, which may require half an hour. Skim the soup well, and try whether it has been properly seasoned. There should be about half a pound of vegetables to two quarts of broth.

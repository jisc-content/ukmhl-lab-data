PUDDINGS. 187 Mice and Onions. 333. Rice four ounces; one middle-sized onion. Cree the rice in water, add a little butter, pepper, etc. Boil the onion till tender, chop it fine, and mix it well with the rice ; put the whole in a dish and bake. See 107 g. Bice and Split Lentils^ or Feas, etc. 334. Take of each two table-spoonfuls; milk three-quarters of a pint; sugar one ounce; almond flavour two or three drops. Cree the rice and lentils in milk or water twenty minutes; add the sugar, milk, etc., and bake twenty minutes. Some will prefer one-third split lentils with two-thirds rice. Fearl Barley. 335. Pearl barley four ounces ; sugar two to three ounces; salt half a tea-spoonful; milk two pints. Soak the barley for a few- hours in cold water; pour off the water, add the sugar and milk, and let the whole simmer gently for two or three hours; then bake at a gentle heat. If a richer pudding be required, remove it from the oven when nearly enough; stir in butter one to two ounces; eggs two or three; return it to the oven till sufficiently baked. For a savoury pudding use water instead of milk, and onion one or two ounces; powdered sage half a tea-spoonful; marjoram one quarter of a tea-spoonful; butter one ounce, and leave out the sugar. Sago Pudding. 336. Sago four ounces; eggs two to four; sugar two or three ounces; butter two ounces; milk a pint and half. Simmer the sago in the milk till it thickens, with a little broken cinnamon and lemon peel in a muslin bag. Put a border of thin puff paste round a pudding dish ; remove the spice bag from the sago, stir in the sugar and butter, and when nearly cold, stir in the eggs previously beaten and strained; mix the whole well, and bake at a gentle heat till the pudding is set. If too much heat be used, the whey will be separated (376). Nutmeg or other seasoning may be sprinkled over the pudding before it is baked.

VEGETARIAN COOKERY. 60 agreeably-tasted cheese is made of skimmed milk, as the Par- mesan, and some of the Dutch cheese. The former is made of skimmed cow's milk, not of goat's milk, as formerly supposed. CHEDDAR CHEESE AND SKIMMED MII.K CHEESE COMPAIIF.D. CHEDDAR.

When grated it is easier of digestion, because it then mixes more readily with other alimentary matters, and is thus more quickly dissolved by the gastric juice. It is liable to produce constipa- tion, especially when new, and made from creamed milk. {!>■) Bggs. 53. Eggs consist of what is denominated the white and the yolk, both nutritious. The former consists of nearly pure albumen, which coagulates into a firm white solid when heated to 159° (13); the yolk consists, in part, of a variety of albumen, and therefore, like the white, coagulates by heat, though less readily. Two-thirds of the yolk, in a perfectly dry state, is a bright yellow oil; it also contains from 3 to 4 grains of phosphoric acid. If an egg weighs 1000 grains, about 100 will consist of shell and membrane, 600 of the white, and 300 of the yolk. The white and yolk contain as follows:— WHITE. Water . . 80 Albumen . 15-5 Mucus . . 4-5 Yellow Oil 100-0 The shell is very porous, consequently, eggs lose weight by evaporation, especially in hot weather, air taking the place of the Water Curd Fat .

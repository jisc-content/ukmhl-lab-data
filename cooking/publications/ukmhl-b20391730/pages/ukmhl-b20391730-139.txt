CAKES, BISCUITS, ETC. 127 Brioche [Bun), 149. Flour sixteen ounces; butter eight to twelve ounces; eggs four to eight; sugar three quarters of an ounce; yeast one table-spoonful. Mix as above ; or, Put upon a plate four ounces of flour, half an ounce of fresh yeast, two and a half ounces of warm water; form a soft paste, cover it with another plate, and let it stand in a warm place with a cloth over it till it has risen to two or three times its original size. By making a cross at the top, the effect will be more apparent. If the yeast be too strong, or too much of it, the paste will be bitter ; if it rises too long, the nature of the brioche will be changed, Place on the table the remaining twelve ounces of flour; make a hole in the middle, and put in the butter, quarter of an ounce of salt, half a glass of milk or cream, and the eggs; mix in the flour gradually, and form the whole into a paste; knead it well with the palm of the hand, incorporate the previously formed leaven without working the paste too much. Dredge a clean cloth, with which cover a wooden bowl or terreen; place in it the paste covered with the cloth, and let it stand twelve hours in a warm place. Brioche paste should be neither too soft nor too firm ; if too soft add more flour, if too firm add more eggs. It should be a little finer than paste for bread. Press it out and fold it five or six times with the ends towards the centre; let it stand again three or four hours covered with a cloth. Press it out twice, and turn the ends to the centre without adding more pressure. Baba. 150.

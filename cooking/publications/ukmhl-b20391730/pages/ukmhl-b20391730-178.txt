Salads are chiefly composed of lettuce, endive, mustard, cress, sorrel, parsley, green onions, potatoes, cucumbers, lentils, haricots, French beans, cauliflower, tops of young spinach, mint celery, radishes, boiled beet, water cresses, etc. All vegetables intended for salad should be fresh gathered, well trimmed, repeatedly washed in cold water, with a little salt in it, and thoroughly drained. The small herbs should be put in a clean cloth and lightly shaken, but not pressed. The lettuces and celery shoald be divided and neatly arranged, wiih the smaller salads in the salad bowl. When salad sauce or dressing is used it should be put in the bowl first, the salad should be laid lightly over it, and the top garnished with boiled white of eggs cut in rings, and slices of cooked beet root. The sauce, however, is usually served in a separate vessel. Winter Salad. 265.

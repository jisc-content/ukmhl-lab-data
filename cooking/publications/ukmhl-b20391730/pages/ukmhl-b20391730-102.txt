90 VEGETARIAN COOKERY. Fine Currant Syrup, or Strop de Groseilles. 102. Express the juice from ripe red currants gathered dry; strain and put it in a clean pitcher; let it stand in a cellar or cool place for twenty-four hours, or longer, should it not then appear perfectly curdled. Pour it gently into a fine hair-sieve, and drain the juice without pressure ; pass it through a jelly-bag, add finely broken sugar equal to the weight of the juice, and, when the sugar is dissolved, turn the whole into a preserving pan and boil it gently four or five minutes ; remove the scuni as it rises. In the course of twelve hours afterwards, put the sjTup in small dry bottles, cork them, and keep them in a cool dry place. The flavour of the fruit will be preserved, and when this syrup is mixed with water it affords an excellent beverage. It also forms a good pudding sauce. Easpberry or cherry juice may be mixed with it. Fr^t Lozenges and Wafers for Dessert. 103. To every pint of fruit juice, extracted as for jelly, add a pound of finely sifted sugar and the white of a small egg. Beat the mixture together until it becomes quite thick ; then put it upon buttered paper in a slow oven; let it remain until it will quit the paper, then turn it and leave it in the oven till quite dry; cut it into shapes and keep them near the fire in a box between sheets of paper. Ripe gooseberries may be used by passing the pulp, obtained as above, through a sieve, and to every pound of fruit add twelve ounces of sugar and the white of au egg beaten to a stiff froth. Mix the whole together, and spread it thinly upon china dishes. "When sufliciently dry, by being placed in a cool oven, cut it into shapes, remove the wafers thus made iuto clean dishes, and set them before the fire or in a cool oven.

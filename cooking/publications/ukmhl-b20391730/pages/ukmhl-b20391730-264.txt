248 VEGETARIAN COOKERY. Onion Sauce. 518. Peel some onions, put them in hot water, and hoil them fifteen minutes, remove them into fresh hot water and boil them gently till they are quite tender; remove the external layer, squeeze the onions well between two trenchers or plates, then press them through a colander or chop them very fine; heat them in melted butter; or add them to half a pint of milk or cream, two ounces of butter, a tea-cupful of crumbled bread and a little salt and nutmeg, and boil the whole for a minute or two. Flour may be used instead of the bread. 'Onion Puree Sauce, 519.

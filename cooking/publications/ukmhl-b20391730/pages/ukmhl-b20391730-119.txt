BREAD. 107 progress will be made. Roll and cut it finally into cakes, about a quarter or half an inch thick ; prick them with a fork, and bake them six minutes or more, according to their thickness, in a quick oven, or over the fire. The addition of a very small portion of yeast, or baking powder, not so much as is used tor light bread, maybe employed to advantage. (5.) Or flour four ounces ; butter four ounces; bread-dough well risen eight ounces. Work the butter and flour well together, then add them to as much dough as will form a stiff paste. Roll it out rather tbin, cut it into biscuits, prick them and bake them about twenty minutes in a moderate oven. The paste will not require beating, and forms excellent biscuits, crisp but not too hard. (c.) "When the meal or flour of wheat is used, a little potato- starch or arrow-root (about half an ounce or more to a pound of flour), is considered an improvement (34). Oatmeal, potatoes boiled and bruised, and butter, make excel- lent biscuits; instead of potatoes, rice flour may be used, and then a little oil is said to be preferable to butter. Oatmeal and pease-meal in equal portions may also be employed. Biscuits may be varied by the addition of butter, eggs, sugar, salt, caraway seeds, etc.; and the pulp or juice of fruits may be used instead of water. {d.)

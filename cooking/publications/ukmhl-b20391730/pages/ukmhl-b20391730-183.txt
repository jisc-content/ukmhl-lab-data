167 EGGS. If preferred rather hard, boil thera a little longer; if very hard, ten minutes. When boiled hard, remove the shells and chop the eggs with boiled parsley, mix with them a little good melted butter, and a little salt. Serve them with sippets. Fresh eggs plunged suddenly into a large quantity of boiling water are liable to have their shells broken by the expansion of the internal fluid ; this will not be the case when they are put into a small portion of boiling water, because the temperature of the water will then be reduced by contact with the eggs, and will be raised again slowly enough to permit the escape of a small portion of the fluid. Eggs which have been laid some time contain a little air, and are notÂ°so easily broken by the hot water, because the air admits of expansion (53). To Foach Eggs. 272. Break the shells in the middle, and turn each egg into a cup, from which slide it gently into a pan of boiling water, which has been removed from the fire ; when the whites begin to set, boil the water gently, and immediately that the yolks set, remove the eggs with a slice. To prevent the yolks being covered with white, the pan should contain no more water than is just sufficient to float the eggs. By trimming the whites, and attending to these directions, an elegant preparation is obtained, the yellow yolk being surrounded by a circle of pure white. To Bake Eggs. 273. {a.) Lightly butter a dish, upon which break several eggs without brcciking the yolks; add a little pepper, salt, and a few small pieces of butter liere and there; set the dish in the oven or before the fire, till the whites are set, but not hard ; serve them while hot. Bread crumbs previously browned may be sifted over them, and parsley used as a garnish. (i.) Or, beat the eggs, and for each egg add two table-spoonfuls of new milk; add also a little chopped parsley, pepper, and salt.

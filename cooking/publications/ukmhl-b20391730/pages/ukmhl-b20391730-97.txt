Take eighteen Seville oranges, or about three pounds in weight, and put them in salt and water for twelve hours, and afterwards rub them well with a cloth. Boil them in two quarts of water, or suflacient to cover them, for twenty minutes, or until so tender that the head of a pin will easily penetrate the skin ; the water will then be reduced to three pints. Cut the oranges in two, or in quarters ; remove the pulp into a basin and separate from it all fibres, pips, etc., till nothing is left but the clear pulp and juice. Remove all the white part from the rind, and cut the latter into large narrow slips, which add to the pulp; the whole will theu weigh about a pound and a half. Add three pints of the water in which the oranges were boiled ; let the whole simmer about twenty minutes, then add four pounds of loaf sug ir broken into small pieces, and let it simmer again gently thirty or forty minutes, or until it is very clear, then put it into small jars.

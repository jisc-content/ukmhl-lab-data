240 VEGETARIAN COOKERY. (1.) Peeseryes, Stewed FHiriTS, or the Juice of Fruits. Preserves and the juice of fruit are frequently served with boiled rice, flour puddings, etc. Apple Sauce. 496. Pare, divide, and core some apples ; stew them in a very little water, and when sufficiently done, pulp them through a sieve. A little sugar and lemon peel may be added. Or, apples pared, divided, and cored one quart; sugar one ounce; butter half an ounce. Add a table-spoonful of water to the apples; bake them in a basin covered with a plate, in a moderate oven for an hour, or till they are reduced to a pulp; beat the pulp till smooth; add the sugar and butter, or not, as may be preferred. A little lemon peel may be added to the apples and removed from them when they are reduced to a pulp. This method is considered preferable to stewing the apples. Raspberry Sauce. 497. Stew some raspberries with a little water till they are quite soft; mix a tea-spoonful of potato flour with a very little water; add it to the fruit, and when well mixed, strain the whole through a sieve; add a little sugar, cinnamon, and a glass of water, vinegar, or wine, and boil the mixture till it is clear. Currant jelly, fresh cherries, or other fruit may be treated in the same way. Med Currant Sauce. 498. Eed currants half a pint; sugar three ounces in lumps. If the currants are dusty wash them and drain them. Boil the sugar in one-third of a pint of water for five minutes ; put in the currants and stew them ten minutes; strain off the juice through muslin or a fine sieve ; heat it again and pour it while boiling to a small spoonful of arrowroot, or potato starch, pre- viously mixed with a table-spoonful of cold water, and stir it well while mixing; finally, let the sauce boil for one minute that it may become transparent, then pour it over the pudding.

PRINCIPLES AND PRACTICE OP TEGETARIAN COOXERY. 1. The objects of Cookery are : 1st. By means of moisture and heat, variously applied, to render any nutritive substance more agreeable to the palate; to expel from it any principle which would be injurious to the animal economy ; to reduce any strong fibrous structure ; and to bring it to a proper consistency for the teeth and digestive organs, 2nd. To point out the best known means of mingling, combining, and otherwise preparing various articles of diet* so as to render the compound pleasing to the eye, agreeable to the taste, suitable to the stomach, and nutritive to the system. 3rd. To describe the most successful methods of preserving and storing perishable nutritive substances. Before instructions upon these subjects can be duly appreciated and well understood, a certain amount of information is requisite respecting the chemical elements, and alimentary principles, of the articles used in Vegetarian diet, as well as respecting the processes employed in cookery. Some readers may consider such introductory matter unnecessary, and too scientific for a work of this kind ; but Cookery is in reality a branch of chemistry, and a knowledge of the principles of any art is usually essential to success in its practice. The causes of failure in any particular preparation may then be frequently detected, and avoided in future; a little knowledge of this kind will also suggest new mixtures and processes. Those, however, who are unwilling to attend to these preliminaries can pass them over ; they will find ample directions for all requisite preparations in the various divisions of the work.

119 CAKES, BISCUITS, ETC. the whole stand two days, then add three pounds of potatoes boiled and mashed, let the mixture stand another day, then strain it, when it will be ready for use, and should be put into bottles. It should be stirred frequently during the making, and kept near the fire. Before using the yeast, shake the bottle well. It will keep two months in a cool place. EICH CAKES, FANCY BISCUITS, ETC. 133. Bread, buns, rolls, biscuits, and cakes in great variety are formed by adding cream, butter, eggs, sugar, currants, raisins, etc., and although such mixtures deviate considerably from a simple diet, and must be injurious to health when freely indulged in, yet our present social condition requires that directions should be given for forming some of these compounds. As general rules, when well understood and carefully observed, are likely to lead to more satisfactory results than an endless number of receipts for buns, cakes, biscuits, etc., the former will be adhered to wherever it is found practicable. Preliminary Observations. 134. Flour.—For all light cakes, and finer kind of pastry, the flour should be well dried, mixed up warm, and previously sifted, it thought desirable. When butter is used, the fiour should be allowed to become quite cool again, before the butter is mixed with it. Feas^.—Brewers' yeast should be purified by repeatedly washing it in cold water, as directed (125). Sixteen ounces of flour, when much butter, sugar, or fruit is used, require about one table spoonful of good yeast, or a quarter of an ounce of German yeast (123). Or, one quarter of an ounce, or a tea-spoonful of baking powder. Or, one quarter of an ounce of bicarbonate of soda, and one quarter of an ounce of hydrochloric acid.

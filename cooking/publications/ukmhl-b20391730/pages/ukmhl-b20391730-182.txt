Bake the mixture for about ten or fifteen minutes, in a moderate oven in a dish, or in tart pans, previously buttered, either with or -without a lining of paste. "When the beaten whites of eggs are added, the mixture should be put in the oven, immediately after the addition, and as soon as cooked, serve quickly. 3. Make the mixture into small oval balls, dip them in stiff batter, and fry them. To the above ingredients may be added mustard, pepper, salt, chopped parsley, young onions, etc. Eice, potatoes, apples, lettuce, celery, an^ other vegetables, along with butter, cream, or milk, seem a more appropriate addi- tion to cheese than bread and eggs. Cheese consists chiefly of caseine or curd, and requires such carbonaceous matters as butter, rice, potatoes, etc., to render it a proper article of diet. Baked or toasted cheese and potatoes are highly nutritious and whole- some; butter, cream, etc., may be supplied when thought desirable. 4. Flour four ounces; grated cheese four ounces; butler four ounces; cayenne half a tea-spoonful; dissolved in a tea-cupful of hot milk. Mix all well together with the hand, roll the mixture out and cut it to the size and shape of finger biscuits; bake them in a quick oven, taking care not to scorch them. Cheese pudding (372). Eggs. To Boil Eggs. 271. Put them gently in boiling water, and boil them two and a half or three minutes. Or, when the water boils, remove the pan from the fire, put in the eggs, and let them reraam in the water six minutes ; the yolks and whites will thus be more intimately mixed. Or put them in cold water, set the pan on the fire, and when the water has boiled one minute or rather more, the eggs will be ready.

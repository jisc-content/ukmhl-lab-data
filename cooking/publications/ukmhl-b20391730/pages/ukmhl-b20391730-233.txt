217 OMELETS, FRITTERS, PANCAKES, ETC. Omelets. 444. An omelet may be either plain, savoury, or sweet; it should be neither greasy, burnt, nor too much done. The fire should not be too hot, as the object is to heat the omelet well through, but not to brown it much. It should not be made too thin, and too much white of egg will render it hard. When the batter has been well mixed, pour it into a pan con- taining boiling butter, stir it with a spoon till it begins to set, turn it up round the edges, and when it is of a light brown, it is sufficiently cooked. The omelet should not be turned, or it will be flattened and tough; fold one-half over the other, and lay it on a hot dish, the browned side outward. A salamander may be used for the upper side if it should be preferred brown. The pan in which an omelet is fried should be small to prevent the batter spreading too much: when the pan is not small enough, hold it on one side. No sauce should be poured over the omelet. To bake an omelet, melt a little butter in a dish, pour in the mixture, and bake it in a quick oven. The following mixtures are intended for tolerably large omelets ; when required smaller, diminish the number of eggs, etc. Plain Omelets. 445. Eggs four ; butter one to two ounces To these may be added bread crumbs two to four ounces ; or, bread crumbs one ounce, and mashed potatoes two ounces ; or flour one ounce ; or boiled rice four ounces. To any of these forms add a little salt and pepper, or cayenne, or nutmeg and mace; and milk or cream sufficient to give the whole a proper consistency. Grated cheese and French beans boiled and cut small, of each two ounces ; parsley a quarter of an ounce may be added to the beaten eggs and butter. The butter may be omitted in these and the following receipts if the omelet be thought too rich with it. Savoury Omelets. 446. Eggs four; butter a quarter to half an ounce ; flour one table-spoonful; cream or milk a tea-cupful; parsley shred

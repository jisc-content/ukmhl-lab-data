VEGETARIAJI COOKEHY. 8 Sulphur.—Th.is is a constituent both of animals and vege- tables. It is found in albumen, fibrine, and caseine. The discoloration of a silver spoon by eggs depends upon the formatioii of sulphuret of silver. Sulphur is found in corn, almonds, nuts, peas, beans, cauliflowers, cabbages, asparagus, turnips, potatoes, etc. Iron.—A constituent of most, if not all, organized beings. It is found in yolk of egg, milk, peas, potatoes, cabbage, and most vegetables, used as food. Liebig says, "Vegetable food, especially grain, and of course bread, contain as much iron as beef or red meat generally." CHLOE.INE.—This element is taken into the system in the form of chloride of sodium or common salt, -which contains 60 per cent, of it. Sodium.—This metal exists in the blood and the animal tissues. Common salt contains 40 per cent, of it. Calcium.—This is also a metal which forms a part of animal and vegetable structures. It exists in the cereal grains, onions, garlic, most other vegetables, eggs, and milk. Magnesium.—This is found in the cereal grains, potatoes, milk, eggs, etc. Potassium.—A constituent both of animal and vegetable pro- ducts. "It is found in grapes, potatoes, and most inland plants. ALIMENTARY PEINCIPLES. 3. Two or more of the simple elements in combination form alimentary or proximate principles, called also simple aliments; these again, by theii- union with each other, constitute our ordinary foods, whether animal or vegetable, termed compound aliments. Alimentary principles are divided into two classes, the Non- azotized, or those which in a pure state contain no nitrogen, and the Azotized, or such as contain this element. (1.) The Non-Azotized Class. 4 This division contains the aqueous, saccharine, amylaceous, mucilaginous, pectinaceous, acidulous, alcoholic, and oleaginous principles.

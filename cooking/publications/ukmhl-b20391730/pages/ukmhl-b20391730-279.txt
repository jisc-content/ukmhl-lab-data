VEGETAKIAN DIETARY. 263 as for producing any desirable physiological effect by means of food, whether liquid or solid. Hence the importance of a judicious choice of articles of diet for the breakfast table, especially for invalids. A selection may be made from the following list suitable to any constitution or condition. Coffee; tea; cocoa ; chocolate ; milk cold, boiled, or made into gruel; water or other beverage. Bread; cakes; dry toast; porridge; frumenty; rice; barley; cheese cakes; fruit pies, etc. Gruel made with oatmeal, sago, tapioca, Indian meal, manna- croup, arrowroot, patent barley, revaleata, lentil meal, etc. Fruits, fresh, or preserved, or dried, as raisins, figs, dates, etc. ; sugar; treacle; honey; fruit jellies, or moulds; jams; marma- lade, etc. ; butter; cream; eggs; cheese. The chief properties of the respective articles in this list have already been noticed. Oatmeal porridge and oatmeal gruel, made with milk or milk and water, are excellent preparations for breakfast in cold weather, and are very nutritious. Fruit of one kind or other is generally regarded as an agreeable and useful adjunct to the dietary of the morning meal, and is acceptable to most stomachs when eaten along with well made bread. Dinner. 556. Health will be best maintained by a moderate variety of Vegetarian preparations made according to the instructions and receipts supplied in this and other works. A constant and exclusive adhesion to one or two simple articles of diet is not desirable, how- ever much they may be relished; but too great a variety at any one time is equally objectionable. A little experience and careful observation will enable each person to determine what is best in his own case according to his constitution, condition of health, and employment. Soups; well cooked vegetables; puddings; pies; omelets ; fritters; eggs; cheese, etc. should be supplied in such variety and rotation as circumstances may require.

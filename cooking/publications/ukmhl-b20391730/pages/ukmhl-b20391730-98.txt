VEQETAIIIA.N COOKEKY. 86 If the fruit is very abundant in juice, as ripe currants, reserve a portion of tlie juice for other purposes, and pass the remainder with the pulp through a sieve, so as to remove all skin, seeds, etc. "When reduced a little by boiling, stir in the sugar, in the proportion of ten ounces of sugar to a pint of the pulp and juice ; boil the whole half an hour or till it is quite stiff, stirring it well all the time, then press it into moulds and let it stand till cold. The pulp which remains after making jellies, if not pressed or strained too much, may also be employed in making fruit moulds. Elegant moulds are also made by boiling sago, rice, barley, etc., in the juice of fruit (211). When the preserve leaves the pan well, forming a ball round the spoon, or when it will not adhere to the finger when touched, it is ready for the mould. Gooseberry Moulds. 95. Two quarts or four pounds of ripe gooseberries yield about a pound and a half, or a pint and a half of pulp and juice after straining, to which about a pound of sugar may be added. To half a peck of picked red, ripe gooseberries, add a teacup- ful of water; boil half an hour; then strain the juice from the berries and pass one half of them through a sieve, reserving the remaining half for any other purpose; add the strained pulp to the juice, return the mixture to the pan, and add a pound and a half of bruised lump sugar for each quart of the pulp and juice. Simmer the whole till sufficiently firm, then put it in moulds. This is a very useful preserve and will keep well. Green Gooseberry Moulds. 96. Green gooseberries six pounds; bruise them and boil them an hour and a quarter, then add two pounds of powdered sugar and boil the whole half an hour longer, or till of a sufficient consistency. Eed Currant Moulds. 97. Boil the currants from five to seven minutes; pour off three parts of the juice; press the remainder with the pulp

VEGETATIIAN COOKERY. 200 Mix according to 115 ^. Fill a floured pudding cloth with the hatter, and tie it tight; or buttered tea-cups, or small pudding basins, -with a cloth tied over each; plunge each pudding into boiling water, and let it boil fast during half an hour, or an hour and a quarter, according to size; or cook it by steam. The pudding should be just firm enough to stand, when removed from the cloth or mould. Or, bake in buttered tea-cups, saucers, basin, or pie-dish, three parts full of batter, during fifteen minutes or more, according to size, or in a shallow dish, as a Yorkshire pudding. The pudding may be served with butter-sauce and currant jelly, or with sweet-sauce; or with butter and salt, or sugar, etc. Remarks.â€”Oatmeal, maize meal, etc., may be used instead of wheat flour. Half a pint of fluid may be sufficient for a boiled pudding; a baked one should be made much thinner. Baking is said to render eggs less easy of digestion than boiling or steam- ing ; hence puddings for invalids should be boiled or steamed. If milk be used for a baked pudding, one egg will be sufficient. From a quarter to half a tea-spoonful of baking powder will add much to the lightness of the pudding. To render the pudding savoury, introduce a little chopped parsley and other herbs, or onions, etc., instead of sugar. Batter made with Biestings. 378. See 46. Flour four ounces; biestings one cupful; milk nearly a pint. Mix the flour with a little of the milk, and when quite smooth stir in the remainder of the milk and biestings.

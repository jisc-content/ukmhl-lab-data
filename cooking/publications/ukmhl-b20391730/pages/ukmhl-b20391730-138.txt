VEGETARIAN COOKERY. 126 Another Cake. 145. To 135 add butter four ounces ; eggs two ; sugar eighi ounces; currants eight ounces ; candied lemon three ounces ; and baking powder instead of yeast. Bake two hours. Musks. 146. To 135 add butter two ounces ; sugar two ounces. Form the dough and let it rise as for rolls; roll it into cakes about five or six inches in length, and one or two inches broad, and bake in a moderately hot oven. When baked, and quite cold, cut them in thin slices, and dry them in tins in a moderate oven, turning them over occasionally. If baked in a loaf, cut it when cold into slices, and dry them as above. Tops and Bottoms. 147. Flour sixteen ounces; butter one ounce and a half; sugar one ounce; milk half a pint; yeast or baking powder as usual. When the dough is ready, break eight pieces out of twelve ounces of it; mould them round, and place them in straight rows on buttered tins, nearly touching each other ; prove them weii and bake in a moderate oven. "When they are cold, or the day after they have been baked, first cut down each row with a sharp knife, then cut out each separately, and as evenly as possible; finally lay them on their sides, and cut them in halves. Put them on clean tins, nearly touching each other, with the cut side upwards; place them in a moderate oven, and let them become nicely browned. Dutch Pudding. 148. Flour sixteen ounces; milk quarter of a pint; butter eight ounces; eggs four; yeast one table-spoonful; moist sugar two table-spoonfuls; currants eight ounces. Dissolve the butter in the milk, and let it stand till lukewarm; then strain it into the flour; add the eggs well beaten and the yeast; beat all together, and let the paste stand an hour before the fire to rise. Beat in the sugar and currants, put the paste into a dish or tin well buttered, and bake it. This partakes of the character of brioche, and may be varied in many ways.

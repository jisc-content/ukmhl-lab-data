VEGETARIAN COOKERY. 168 Dissolve the butter in the dish, pour in the eggs, and bake imme- diately in a quick oven. If baked in a flat dish, a few minutes will be sufficient; if in a deep dish, the eggs will require a little longer time. To Fry Eggs. 274. 1. Break each egg separately into a cup, from which pass it into a pan of melted butter, and fry them over a rather brisk fire. When they begin to set, throw the hot butter repeatedly over the yolks with the slice till they are enough. If preferred crisp and rather hard, they may be turned over. 2. Beat the eggs, season them with a little pepper, etc., and fry them. When cold, put them between slices of hread and butter. 3. Boil the eggs hard, slice them and fry them in olive oil or butter; brown a little butter in the pan with a little flour sprinkled into it, add a little water and salt, and when the whole boils pour it over the eggs. Garnish with fried parsley, or serve with parsley sauce. 4. Boil the eggs three minutes ; put them in cold water, remove the shells and surround the eggs withpuflf paste ; brush them over with beaten eggs, sprinkle a very few bread crumbs over them ; then fry them a light brown in clarified butter, and serve them with a little brown sauce. For observations respecting fried articles, see 66. Mulled Eggs. 274*. Beat the yolk of a recently laid egg; stir to it a little milk or cream ; then pour to it more hot milk or hot coffee, tea, water, ale, or wine, stirring it well all the time. If the hot liquid he added too hastily, or without being well stirred, the egg will coagulate or curdle instead of uniting with the fluid. Sugar and flavouring may be added according to taste (205).

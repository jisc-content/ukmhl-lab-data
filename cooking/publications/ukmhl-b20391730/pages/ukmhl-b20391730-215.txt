PUDDINGS. 199- the batter will boil over in the oven, before the flour expands and thickens. All paddings of the custard kind, whether made of eggs and milk only, or of these with sago, arrowroot, rice (ground or in grain), vermicelli, etc., require a very gentle oven, and would be spoiled by too great a heat, the whey separating from the caseine and albumen. Tapioca should be well bruised, or the yolk of eggs used with it will separate. Simple batter puddings should be baked in a rather brisk oven, and the butter, previously put in the dish, should be boiling hot before the batter is poured in, if it is intended that the pudding should be crisp. When raisins are used, the oven should be well heated, but not too hot. When whisked whites of eggs arc used, as for souffles, they should be stirred gently into the mixture just before it is tied up for boiling, or before it is put into the oven, the pudding will then be vei-y light, but it will fall soon after it is removed from the oven. When a pudding is sufficiently brown on the surface, before it has been well baked through, lay a sheet of writing paper over it, but not before it is set; when quite firm in the centre, it will be sufficiently baked. Batter puddings may be made either thin, as where much milk or other fluid is employed; or the batter may be made stiff with eggs and butter only. Batter for panca^ies requires about half a pint of liquid to four ounces of flour; for a Yorkshire pudding the batter should be made rather stifl:er. Batter Pudding. 377. Flour four ounces; milk or cream, or a mixture of the two, half a pint to a pint; eggs one to four. Sugar and butter may be added in the proportion of from two to four ounces of each; and currants, raisins, or seasoning, when preferred ; some also add a little salt, others substitute water for milk, and boil a little seasoning in it.

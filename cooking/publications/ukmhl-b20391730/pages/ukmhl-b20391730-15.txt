INTRODUCTION. iii may be made without using the flesh of animals; and I doubt not that a simple and judicious combination of fruits with farina- ceous, saccharine, oleaginous, mucilaginous, and other vegetable productions, would, after the habit had been well and carefully formed, be most productive of health and enjoyment; but as many may object to a total surrender of eggs, milk, cream, butter, and cheese, this work would have been incomplete unless it had shown how these articles may be employed in moderation to enrich the purely vegetable preparations. The union of the two may be regarded as an intermediate or transition diet, till the chemistry of food is better understood, or until the best and pleasantest combi- nations of fruits and farinacea have been ascertained. These combinations should vary according to climate, constitution, and other circumstances; they should unite high nutritive value and digestibility with real sensual enjoyment, and be well adapted to man's progressive development as a physical, intellectual, and moral being. The flesh and blood of animals are entirely excluded from all preparations contained in this work, being considered unnecessary, unnatural, and frequently injurious to man. The slaughter of highly organized and sentient beings is productive of much misery to the animal creation, repulsive to our natural sympathies, demoralizing in its effects upon human character, and not the best adapted to our digestive organs. High seasonings should be either altogether rej ected, or used with caution ; it is better that they should keep their place as medicines, and be used only when states of the system denoting a deviation from health require them. To meet in some measure the prevailing habits and customs of society, many receipts have been introduced which a less sophisticated taste will condemn as too rich, and consequently prejudicial; but in all such cases it is an easy matter to diminish the quantity of the objectionable articles, or to substitute plainer preparations. Many of the combinations in this work are intended for those persons who wish to make a trial of Vegetarian diet, rather than for those who have already adopted it, and to whom simpler fare will be much more acceptable. Food well and plainly cooked, and thoroughly masticated

115 BREAD. Bread when taken from the oven is about one-third part heavier than the flour used in its preparation, so that eight pounds of flour should produce eleven pounds of bread. In thirty-six hours after it has been baked, it will have lost nearly one-thirtieth part of its weight. The average moisture in flour being 13-4 per cent., and that in home-made bread 33*93, the composition will be. Dry Flour . • . 66-07 Moisture in the Flour . . 10'22—76-29 Water added in making . 23-71 100-00 Loaves which have been kept too long may be made to resemble new bread by placing them in a gentle oven till they are hot through, but not till they are hard or dry. Large loaves may be dipped m cold water previously to being put into the oven. This observation applies also to cakes, biscuits, and other pastry. DiNNEii Rolls, Cakes, etc. 129. Dinner rolls, and thin or thick cakes, may be formed of the dough made as for bread. They may be baked either in the oven, or if thin, m a frying-pan over the fire; but a loaf con taming fourteen or sixteen pounds of flour or meal, and baked m a brick oven during the night, is more economical, and should be preferred for general use. Biscuits, buns, tea-cakes, etc., mav be made m the same way by adding butter, sugar, etc., to the dough. See 122 and 135. ' o . "-o me Ceusts, Ruses, etc. 130. Good crusts to be served with cheese, etc., mav be formed thus: Take a half-baked loaf, tear it into small rou-^h pieces with a couple of forks ; lay the pieces of dough on a tin and bake them for ten minutes. A light loaf, made with new milk and a little butter, when thus pulled in pieces, makes excellent rusks. A sweet hght cake treated in the same way is also verv good Or, spread thin shavings from a stale loaf of bread upon a dish, or upon the tin tray of an American oven, dry them gradually till they are quite crisp, and let them remain till Tev

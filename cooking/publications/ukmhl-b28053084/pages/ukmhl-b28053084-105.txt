SECOND COURSE 93 in milk and water till tender (about two hours). Dish on toast. Coat with white sauce. Garnish with red pepper and dried parsley. Potato Chips Peel and shape the potatoes. Cut in very thin slices. Dry. Fry in fat that is just smoking till cooked. Drain. Repeat till all are fried. Then plunge into very hot fat to crisp and brown. They should just be a golden colour. Potato Straws Cut potatoes into strips about one-eighth of an inch square and an inch and a quarter long. Dry in a clean cloth and fry as potato chips. Drain, season and serve on a dish paper. French Beans Method.—String beans and cut into diamonds. Boil quickly in boiling, salted water, to which a pinch of soda has been added, till tender, about half an hour. Drain well. Return to pan with a pat of butter. Shake over fire. Season and serve very hot. Peas are cooked in the same way—sugar added instead of carbonate of soda. Also a sprig of mint.

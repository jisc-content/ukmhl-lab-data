8 SCULLERY WORK The use of cold water preserves the whiteness of wood. Most wooden utensils are greasy, and therefore warm water is necessary to cleanse them, but it must be remembered that hot water warps wood and turns it yellow. Soda should only be used for very greasy chopping blocks, as it also spoils the appearance of wood. Wood must be rubbed as dry as possible with a coarse cloth and stood in the open air. Soap is necessary to remove dirt, but, unless carefully removed by rinsing, will spoil the colour of the wood. If wooden utensils are put away damp, they become mouldy. (1) Wash with warm water. (2) Soap the brush. (3) Scrub the way of the grain. (4) Rinse off the dirty soap. (5) Wipe dry the way of the grain. (6) Stand in a draught to dry. For neglected wood use scrubbing paste instead of soap. Boil all together in an old saucepan, stirring occasionally until thoroughly mixed. A little more water may be added. Keep in an earthenware jar. Rules for Scrubbing Recipe for Scrubbing Paste 1 lb. soft soap, 1 lb. whiting, 1 lb. sand, 1 qt. water.

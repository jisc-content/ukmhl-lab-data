BERRIDGE HOUSE RECIPE BOOK SCULLERY WORK SECTION THE KITCHEN RANGE All metal parts of a range or stove must be kept bright. The flues must be cleaned at least once a week, and some other stoves, such as American, require daily cleaning. To Clean Flues (1) Cover dresser, cupboards, and other furni- ture as far as possible, as soot is difficult to remove, and, being light, it is likely to settle in any part of the room. (2) Spread a cloth (preferably hessian) in front of the range. (3) Remove fender and fire irons, and take away cinders and ashes. (4) Sweep the stove. (5) Take out one flue-door in chimney and pass the brush up and down the flue. Repeat this process until all the top flues have been swept. As each flue is swept, replace the door to prevent draught.

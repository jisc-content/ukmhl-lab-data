SUPPLEMENTARY RECIPES 129 without a crack. Fry in hot fat. Garnish with parsley. German Potatoes 8 potatoes, 4 sausages or any minced meat. Method.—Cut off the tops of each potato. Scoop out some of the inside. Cut each sausage in half, skin it, and fill the potato with it. Put on the top. Put on a greased tin and bake about half an hour. Vegetable Marrow Goose Peel the marrow. Cut off end and scoop out inside. Parboil two onions (with a little carbonate of soda to take off strong flavour). Four sage leaves. Two or three tablespoonsful of bread- crumbs. Pinch of ground ginger to make it more digestible. Method.—Mince the onion. Add to crumbs and sage, then pepper, salt and ginger. Stuff the marrow with this. Put on the top ; bind up with tape. Put into pan of hot water or stock. Simmer half an hour. Then put into flat greased dripping pan. Sprinkle over with crumbs. Put bits of dripping on top, and bake twenty minutes or half an hour. If you have no pan large enough to simmer the marrow in, then put into a piedish with water and stand in oven. To egg before crumbing is an improvement, but not necessary. Serve with some gravy made by putting flour into the baking tin. Pour stock in and boil up. K

COOKERY RECIPES 94 LESSON XXII Roast Fowl Pluck, draw and singe the fowl. To truss, use a trussing needle and string. Put the gizzard through one wing and the liver through the other. Fold the pinions back. Cut off feet by the first joint. Draw sinews. Truss legs firmly against body. Place a piece of fat bacon on the breast. Roll in greased paper. Have dripping hot in roasting-tin. Baste fowl. Bake for about one hour to an hour and a half. When the bird is almost done, remove the paper, dredge breast with flour, and place in a very hot oven to brown. Rolls of bacon should be placed on a skewer and baked at side of tin. Dish on a hot dish, removing the skewers. Pour off fat and make gravy in the usual way. Season and pour a little round. Serve the remainder in a sauce- boat. Serve bread sauce. To draw the fowl.â€”Remove the head and neck close to the body, leaving about two inches of skin to fold over. Remove crop and windpipe. Loosen all organs with finger. Make an incision between the vent and the tail. Loosen all organs, and place two fingers round the gizzard, draw it carefully out. With it, all internal organs except the lungs should come. Now remove lungs. Scald the feet and scrape the outer skin off. Wipe the bird carefully out. Cut the gizzard and remove the contents, also the thick skin which encloses them. Wash it. Carefully remove the gall bladder from the liver, and wash it also. If these are not roasted with the fowl they can be simmered in a little stock or water and used for the gravy.

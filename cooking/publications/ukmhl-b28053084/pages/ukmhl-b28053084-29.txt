LESSON VI Boiled White Fish Wash the fish thoroughly, using a little salt to remove any dark skin or blood. Tie into a good shape. Place on drainer. Have a pan of boiling water (sufficient to cover). Draw it to the side, add salt (one tablespoonful to the quart), and two tablespoonsful of vinegar. Place the fish in and allow the water to simmer gently till fish is done. Allow about seven minutes to each lb. and seven minutes over. When done the fins and tail bones will come away easily. For Salmon Allow ten minutes to each lb. and ten minutes over. Add no vinegar. Have water quite boiling when fish is put in, and boil for one or two minutes, then simmer, as salmon has a very tough skin. To Boil Mackerel Have the water tepid only, and cook very gently as skin is so delicate. c

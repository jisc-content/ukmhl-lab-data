xl MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS FOR If copper utensils be used in tbe kitchen, the cookshouldbe charg- ed to be very careful not to let tbe tin be rubbed off; and to have them fresh done when the least defect appears, and never to put by any soup, gravy, &c. in them, or any metal utensil; stone and earthen ves- sels should be provided for those purposes, as bkewise plenty of common dishes, that the table-set may be used to put on cold meat.—Tin vessels, if kept damp, soon rust, which causes holes.—Fenders, and tin linings of flower-pots, &c. shouldbe pmnted every year or two.— Vegetables soon sour, and corrode metals and glazed red ware, by which a strong poison is produced. Some years ago, the death of several gentle men was occasioned at Salt-hill, by the cook sending a ragout to table, which she had kept from the preceding day in a copper vessel badly tinned. Vinegar by its acidity, does the same, the glazing being of lead or arsenic.—^To cool liquors in hot weather dip a cloth in cold water, and wrap it round the bottle two or three times, then place it in the sun; renew the process once or twice.— The best way of scalding fruits, or boiling vinegar, is in a hot iron hearth; or by putting the vessel into a sauce-pan of water, called a water-bath.—If chocolate, coffee, jelly, gruel, bark, &c. be suffered to boil over, the strength is lost.—The cook should be encouraged to be careful of coals and cinders; for the latter there is a new con- trivance to sift without dispersing the dust of the ashes, by means of a covered tin bucket.—Small coal, wetted, makes the strongest fire for the back, but must remain untouched until it cake. Cinders lightly wet, give a great degree of heat, and are better than coal for furnaces, ironing-stoves, and ovens.—The cook should be charged to take care of jelly bags, tapes for the collared things, &c. which if not perfectly scalded, and kept dry, give an unpleasant flavour, when next used.—Cold water tlirown on cast iron, when hot, will cause it to crack.

291 COOKEHT FOR THE POOR. as it is easy to use only a part of that, and the rest of fresh water, and, by the addition of more vegetables, the bones of the meat used in the family, the pieces of meat that come from table on the plates, and rice, Scotch barley, or oatmeal, there will be some gallons of nutricious soup, two or three times a week. The bits of meat should be only warmed in the soup, and remain whole; the bones, &c., boiled till they yield their nourishment.

But, in every family, there is some superfluity ; and if it be prepared with cleanliness and care, the benefit will be very great to the receiver, and the satisfaction no less to the giver.

If in the villages about London, abounding with opulent families, the quantity of ten gallons were made in ten gentlemenâ€™s houses, there would be a hundred gallons of wholesome agreeable food given weekly for the supply of forty poor families, at the rate of two gallons and a half each. What a relief to the labouring husband, instead of bread and cheese, to have a warm comfortable meal! To the sick, aged, and infant branches how important an advantage! nor less to the industrious mother, whose forbearance from the necessary quantity of food, that others may have a larger share, frequently reduces

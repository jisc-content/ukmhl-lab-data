1S4 BOMESTIC COOKEET. Eepeat the boiling vinegar, and stop them up again in- stantly ; and so on till green; the last time put pepper and ginger. Keep in small stone jars. To Pichle young Cucumbers. Choose nice young gherkins, spread them on dishes, salt them, and let them lie a week—di-ain them, audput- tingthem in ajar, pour boding vinegar over them.

Another way.—Put them into ajar, cover them with the best vinegar cold, let them stand four months; then pour off tlie pickle and boil as much fresh vinegar as will cover the walnuts, adding to every three quarts of \inegar one quarter-poimd of best Durham mustard, a

97 SOUPS. f^oups and gravies are far better when the meat is put at tlie bottom of the pan and stewed, and the hei’bs, roots, &c. with butter, than when water is putto the meat at first; and the gravy that is dra^^^l from the meat should be almost dnedup before the water is pat to it. Do not use the sediment of gravies, &c. that have stood to be cold. When onions are strong boil a turnip with with them, if for sauce; this will make them mild. If soups or gravies are too weak, do not cover them in boiling, that the watery particles may evaporate.^ A clear jelly of Cow-heels is very useful to keep in the house, being a great improvement to soups and gi’avies. Truffles and morels thicken soups and sauces, and give them a fine flavour. Wash halfan ounce of each carefully, then simmer them a few minutes in water, and add them with the liquor, to boil in the sauce, &c. till tender. SOUPS, &c. Scotch Mutton Broth. Soak a neck of mutton in water for an hour; cut off the scrag, and put it into a stew-pot with two quarts of water. As soon as it boils skim it w^ell, and then sim- mer it an hour and a half: then take the best end of the mutton, cut it into pieces (two bones in each), take some of the fat off, and put as many as you think pro- per : skim the moment the fresh meat boils up, ajul eyery quarter of an hour afterwards. Have ready four or li'.'o carrots, the same number of turnips, and tlmee onions, all cut, but not small, and put them in soon enough to get quite tender : add four large spoonfuls of Scotch bai-ley, first wetted with cold water. The meat should stew three hours. Salt to taste, and serve all together. Twenty minutes before serving put in some chopped parsley. It is an excellent winter-dish. Veal Broth. Stew a small knuckle in about three quarts of water, two ounces of rice, a little salt, and a blade of mace, till the liquor is half wasted away.

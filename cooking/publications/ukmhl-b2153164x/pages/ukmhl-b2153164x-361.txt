SICK-COOKEBY. 287 pour in three pints of boiling water, sweeten and cover it close. Another DHnJc.—Wash extremely well an ounce of pearl-barley; shift it twice, then put to it three pints of water, an ounce of sweet almonds beaten fine, and a bit of lemon-peel; boil till you have a smooth li- quor, then put in a little syrup of lemons and capillaire. Another.—Boil three pints of water with an ounce and a half of tamarinds, three ounces of currants, and two ounces of stoned raisins, till near a third be con- sumed. Strain it on a bit of lemon-peel, which remove in an hour, as it gives a bitter taste if left long. A Most Pleasant PrinJe. Put a tea-cupful of cranberries into a cup of water, and mash them. In the meantime boil two quarts of water with one large spoonful of oatmeal and a bit of lemon-peel; then add the cranberries, and as much fine Lisbon sugar as will leave a smart flavour of the fruit; and a quarter of a pint of sherry, or less, as may be proper; boil all for half an hour, and strain off. Soft and fine Draught for those who are Weak and have a Cough. Beat a fresh-laid egg, and mix it with a quarter of a pint of new milk warmed, a large spoonful of capillaire, the same of rose-water, and a little nutmeg scraped. Don’t warm it after the egg is put in. Take it the first and last thing. Toast and Water. Toast slowly athin piece of breadtillextremely brown and bard, but not the least black; then plunge it into a jug of cold water, and cover it over an hour before used.

Wash a handful of common barley, then simmer it gently in three pints of water with a bit of lemon-peel. This is less apt to nauseate than pearl-barley; but the other is a very pleasant drink.

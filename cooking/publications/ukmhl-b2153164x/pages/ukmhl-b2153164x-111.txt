Larding it improves the look and flavour; serve with a rich gravy in the dish; currant-jelly and melted butter, in tureens. To roast Tongue and Udder. After cleaning the tongue well, salt it with common salt and saltpetre three days; then boil it, and likewise a fine young udder with some fat to it, till tolerably tender; then tie the thick part of one to the thin part of the other, and roast the tongue and udder together. Serve them with good gravy and currant-jelly sauce. A few cloves should be stuck in the udder. This is an excellent dish.

191 SWEET DISHES. Jaunemange. Pour a pint of boiling water over two ounces of isin- glass, and when it is dissolved add three quarters of a pint of white wine, the juice of two oranges, and one lemon, the peel of a lemon shred fine, sweeten this to your taste, and add the yolks of eight eggs, let it sim- mer gently, strain and pour it into moulds. Turn out next day. An excellent Trifle. Lay macaroons and ratalia-drops over the bottom of your dish, and pour in as much raisin wine as they will suck up; which, when they have done, pour on them cold rich custard made with more eggs than directed in the foregoing pages, and some rich flour. It must stand two or three inches thick; on that put a layer of raspberry-jam, and cover the whole with a very high whip made the day before, of rich cream, the whites of two well-beaten eggs, sugar, lemon-peel, and raisin- wiiie, well beat with a whisk, kept only to whip sylla- bubs and creams. If made the day before used, it has quite a difierent taste, and is solid and far better. Gooseberry, or Apple Trifle. Scald such a quantity of either of these fruits, as, when pulped through a sieve, will make a thick layer at the bottom of your dish; if of apples mix the rind of half a lemon grated fine; and to both as much sugar as will be pleasant. Mix half a pint of milk, half a pint of cream, and the yolk of one egg ; give it a scald over the fire, and stir it all the time ; donâ€™t let it boil; add a little sugar only, and let it grow cold. Lay it over the apples with a spoon ; and then put on it a whip made the day be- fore, as for other trifle. Chantilly caJee, or cake Trifle, Bake a rice cake iu a mould. AVhen cold, cut it round about two inches from the edge with a shar[) knife, taking care not to perforate the bottom. Put in a thick custard, and some tea-spoonfuls of raspberry- jam, and then put on a whip.

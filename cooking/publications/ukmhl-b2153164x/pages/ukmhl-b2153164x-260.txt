DOMESTIC COOKERT. 186 Mushroom Ketchup, another way. Take a stew-pan full of tke large-flap mushrooms, tnat are notworm eaten, and theskins and fringe of those you have pickled, throw a handful of salt among them, and set them by a slow fire ; they wiU produce a great deal of liquor, which you must strain; and put to it 4 ounces of shalots, two cloves of garlick, a good deal of pepper, ginger, mace, cloves, and a few bay-leaves, boil and skim very well. When cold, cork close.

Let aU sim- mer tiU the shalots sink; then put the liquor into a pan tdl cold; bottle and divide the spice to each. Cork closely, and tie a bladder over. It wdl keep twenty years, and is not good the first. Be very careful to express the juice at home ; for it is rarely unadultera- ted, if bought. Some people make liquor of the out- side shed when the nut is ripe; but neither the flavour nor the colour is then so fine. CocTde Ketchup.

K for brown, burn a bit of sugar for colourmg. It is better to have cockles enough than to add water; and they are cheap. To keep Capers. Add fresh vinegar that has been scalded, and become

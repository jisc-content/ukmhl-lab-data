THE USE OF THE MISTRESS OF A FAMIT.Y. Xll ties may bo as accurately directed as possible, yet much must be left to the discretion of the person who uses them. The different tastes of people require more or less of the flavour of spices, salt, garlick> butter, &c. which can never be ordered by general rules ; and if the cook has not a good taste, and attention to that of her employers* not all the ingredients which nature and art can furnish, will give exquisite flavour to her dishes. The proper articles should be at hand and she must proportion them until the true zest be obtained, and a vapety of flavour be given to the different dishes served the same time. Those who require maigre dishes will find abundance in tins little work ; and where they are not strictly so, by suet or bacon being directed in stuffings, the cook must use butter instead; and where meat gravies (or stock as they are called) are ordered, those made of fish must be adopted.

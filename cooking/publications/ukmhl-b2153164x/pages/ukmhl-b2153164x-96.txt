DOMESTIC COOKERY. 26 come in, part of the suet may be cut off for puddings, or to clariiy. Dripping will baste every thing as well as butter, except fowls and game ; and for kitchen pies, nothing else should he used. The fat off a neck or loin of mutton makes a far lighter pudding than suet. jMeat and vegetables that the frost has touched, should be soaked in cold water two or thi-ee hours before used, or more if they are much iced. Putting them into hot water, or to the fire, till thawed, makes it impossible for any heat to dress them properly afterwards. In w'arm weather, meat should be examined well when it comes in; and if flies have touched it, the part must be cut off, and then well washed. In the height of sum- mer, it is a very safe way to let meat that is to be salted lie an hour in very cold water, rubbing well any part likely to have been fly-blown; then wipe it quite dry, and have salt ready, and rub it thoroughly in every part, throwing a handful over it besides. Turn it every day, and rub the pickle in, which will make it ready for the table in three or four days. If to be very much corned, wrap it in a well-floured cloth, after rubbing it with salt. This last method will corn fresh beef fit for the table the day it comes in, but it must be put into the pot when the water boils. If the weather permit, meat eats much better for hanging two or three days l|,efore it is salted. The water in which meat has been boiled makes an excellent soup for the poor, by adding to it vegetables, oatmeal, or peas. Eoast-beef bones, or shank-bones of ham, make fine peas-soup; and should be boiled with the peas the day before eaten, that the fat may be taken off. In some families great loss is sustained by the spoil- mg of meat. The best way to keep what is to be eaten unsalted, ^is, as before directed, to examine it well, wipe it every day, and put some pieces of charcoal over

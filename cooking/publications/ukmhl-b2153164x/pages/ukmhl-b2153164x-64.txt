J directions for carving. the bird is not old. When the four quarters are thus removed, take off the merrythought from a, and the neck-bones; theselastbyputting in the knife at c, and pressing it under the long broad part of the line c, b; then lift it up, and break it off from the part that sticks to the breast. The next thing is, to di\ide the breast from the carcase, by cut- ting through the tender ribs, close to the breast right down to the tail. Then lay the back upwards, put your knife into the bone half way from the neck to the rump, and on raising the lower end it will scpa.' rate readily. Turn the rump from you, and very neatly take off the two sidesmen, and the whole will be done. As each partis taken off it should be .Aimed neatly on the dish, and care should be taken that what is left goes properly from table. The breast and wings are looked upon as the best parts, but the legs are most juicy in young fowls. After all, more advantage will be gained by observing those who carve weU, and a litUe practice, than hy any written directions whatever. Partridge.—The partridge is here represented as just taken from the spit; but, before it is served up the skewers must be withdrawn. It is cut up in the same manner as a fowl. The wings must be taken off in the lines a, b, and the merrythought in the line c, d. The prime parts of a partridge are the wings, breast, and merrythought, but the bird being small, the two latter are not often divided. The wing is considered the best, and the tip of it reckoned the most delicate mor- sel of the whole. Pigeons.—Cut them in half, either from top to bottom or across. The lower part is generally thought the best; but the fairest way is to cut from the neck to a, {See Plate No. 5) rather than from c to b, by a, wliich is the most fashionable. The figure presents the back of the pigeon ; and the direction of the knife is in the line c, 6, by a, if done the last way.

298 DOMESTIC COOKEET. An excellent Stucco, which will adhere to wood-worJc. Take a bushel of the best stone-lime, a pound of yel- low ochre, and a quarter of a pound of brown umber, all in fine powder. Mix them with a sufficient quantity of hot (but not boiling) water, to a proper thickness; and lay it on with a whitewasher’s brush, which should be new.

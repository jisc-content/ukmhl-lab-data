XXXViii MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS FOR Paper, by keeping, improves in quality; and if bought by half or whole reams from large dealers, will be ranch cheaper than pur- chased by the quhe. The surprising increase of the piice of this ar- ticle may be accounted for by the additional duty, and a larger con- sumption, besides the monopoly of rags; of the latter it is said there is some scarcity, wliich might be obviated if an order were given to a servant in every family to keep a bag to receive all the waste bits from cuttings-out, &c. hlany well-meaning servants are ignorant of the best means of managing, and thereby waste as much as would maintain a small family, besides causing the mistress of the house much chagrin by their irregularity; and many families, from a want of method, have the appearance of chance rather than of regular system.

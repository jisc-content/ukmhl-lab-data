DOMESTIC COOKERY. G3 ounces of jumper berries, an ounce of pepper, the same quantity of allspice, an ounce of saltpetre, half an ounce of sal-primel, a handful of common salt, and a head of shalot, all poimded or cut fine. Boil these all together a few minutes, and pour them over the ham; this quan- tity is for one of ten pounds. Bub and turn it every day, for a fortnight; then sew it up in a thin linen bag, and smoke it three weeks. Take care to drain it from the pickle, and rub it in bran, before drying. To malce a ^icicle that will Jceep for years, for Hams, Tongues, or Beef if boiled and shinned between each parcel of them. To two gallons of spring-water put two pounds of coarse sugar, two pounds of bay, and two pounds and a half of common salt, and half a pound of saltpetre, in a deep earthen glazed pan that wfil hold four gallons, and with a cover that wdl fit close. Keep the beef or hams as long as they will bear, before you put them into the pickle ; and sprinkle them with coarse sugar in a pan, from which they must drain. Bub the hams, &c. well with the pickle, and pack them in close ; putting as much as the pan will hold, so that the pickle may cover them. The pickle is not to be boded at first. A small ham may lie fourteen days, a large one three weeks ; a tongue twelve days, and beef in proportion to its size. They wdll eat well out of the pickle without drying'. When they are to be dried, let each piece be drained over the pan; and when it wdl drop no longer, take a clean sponge and dry it thoroughly. Six or eight hours wdl smoke them, and there should be only a little saw- dust and wet straw burnt to do this; but if put into a bakerâ€™s chimney, sew them in coarse cloth, and hang them a week. To dress Hams. If long hung, put the ham into water a night; and let it lie either in a hole dug in the earth, or on damp stone sprinkled with water, two or three days, to mellow; covering it with a heavy tub, to keep vermin from it.

DOMESTIC COOKEET. SOS with hot sand, and a heavy brush, the right way of the boards. The sides of stairs or passages on which are carpets, or floor-cloths, should be washed with sponge instead of linen or flannel, and the edges will not be soiled. Dift’erent sponges should be kept for the two above uses; and those and the brushes should be well washed when done with, and kept in dry places. To extract Oil from Boards or Stone. Make a strong lye of pearl-ashes and soft water; and add as much unslacked lime as it will take up ; stir it together, and then let it settle a few minutes; bottle it and stop close: have ready some water to lower it as used, and scour the part with it. If the liquor should lie long on the boards, it wiU draw out the colour of them; therefore, do it with care and expedition. To clean Stone Stairs and Sails. Boil a pound of pipe-makers’ clay with a quart of water, a quart of small beer, and put in a bit of stone- blue. Wash with this mixture, and when dry rub the stones with flannel and a brush. To llacTcen the Fronts of Stone Chimney-pieces. Mix oil-varnish with lamp-black, and a little spirit of turpentine, to thin it to the consistence of paint. Wash the stone with soap and water very clean, then sponge it with clear water ; and when perfectly dry, brush it over twice with this colour, letting it dry be- tween the times. It looks extremely well. The lamp- black must be sifted flrst. To taJce Stains out of Marhle. Mix unslacked lime, in finest powder, with the strong- est soap-lye, pretty thick; and instantly, withapainter’s brush, lay it on the whole of the marble. In two months time wash it off perfectly clean; then have ready a fine thick lather of soft soap, boiled in soft water; dip a brush in it, and scour the marble with powder not as common cleaning. This will, by very good rubbing, give a beautiful polish. Clear off the soap, and finish with a smooth hard brush till the end be effected.

Geese Require little expense ; as they chiefly support them- selves on commons, or inlanes, where they can get water. The largest are esteemed best, as also are the white and grey. The pied and dark coloured are not so good. Thirty days is generally the time the goose sits, but in warm weather she will sometimes hatch sooner. Grive them plenty of food, such as scalded bran and light oats; and as soon as the goslings are hatched, keep them housed for eight or ten days, and feed them with barley-meal, bran, curds, &c. For green geese, begin to fatten them at six or .seven weeks old, and feed them as above. Stubble geese require no fattening if they have the run of good fields. TurJcies Are very tender when young.

Let the hen be under a coop, in a warm place exposed to the sun, for the first three or four weeks ; and the young should not be suffered to go out in the dew at morning or evening. Twelve eggs are enough to pnt under a turkey; and when she is about to lay, lock her

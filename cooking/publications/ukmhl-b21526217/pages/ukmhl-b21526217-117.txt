BURNT ALMONDS, RED. > Take some of the finest Jordan al- monds you can get, sift all the dust from them, have some syrup boiling in a pan, and let it boil till it comes almost to ca- rimel, put half a cup full of cochineal in j put the almonds in as fast as you can, and stir them till they are cold; then put them in your sieve and break those that stick together, from each other ; then have another pan of syrup boiling, the same as before, and when they are cold, pick them from each other, for they must always have the coats of sugar on them ; see that your cochineal is properly mixed, to make them of a fine colour, as you must put more cochineal in the last coat than you did in the first.

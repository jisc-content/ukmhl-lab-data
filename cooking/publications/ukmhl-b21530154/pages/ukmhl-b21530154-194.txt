THE MODERN COOK . i8o Roast Breast of Veal a I’Anglaise First take the tendons out of a small breast of veal intended to be dressed, and reserve them for an entree; then bone it completely, cut the ends square, and trim it; place about half a pound of well- seasoned veal-stuffing (see p. 468) along the centre of the inner part, roll the veal up tight so as to secure the stuffing in the middle, fasten it with string and small skewers. About an hour and a half before dinner-time cover it with buttered paper, and roast it either in the oven or before the fire; when done, dish it up, pour round it either some brown melted butter, light Espagnole sauce, or Bechamel, and send to table. Breast of Veal a la Bourgeoise Bone, trim, and roll a small breast of veal according to the preceding instructions; prepare it in an oval stew-pan with three ounces of fresh butter, and set it to simmer on a moderate fire, until it becomes browned all over; then add a bunch of herbs, moisten with a pint of good stock, and put it to braise gently on the fire or in the oven ; half an hour after, add two dozen small carrots cut in fancy shapes, and in another half hour add as many heads of middle-sized onions, a pinch of sugar, and a little salt. When the veal is done, take it up, and after taking away the strings and skewers, put it on a baking-sheet in the oven and glaze it; dish it up, garnish round with the glazed carrots and onions, and after removing all the fat from the surface of the stock or essence of the veal, and reducing it down to the consistency of half-glaze, use it to sauce the breast of veal, and send to table. Breast of Veal a la Windsor Bone and trim a small breast of veal, lay it on the table, and after spreading the inner part with six ounces of quenelle force-meat of veal or rabbits, at least an inch thick, place some square fillets of boiled tongue lengthwise, and between the fillets of tongue put some pieces of black truffles cut square to match the size of the pieces of tongue; then roll up the breast of veal carefully, secure its shape with the aid of small iron skewers and string, and to prevent the force-meat from escaping, cover the ends with layers of fat bacon. Put the veal thus prepared into an oval braising-pan with the trimmings, and the usual proportions of vegetables, etc., moisten with a pint or so of good stock, and set it to braise gently on a slow fire; when done, drain, glaze, and dish it up, garnish round with French beans cut in diamonds—which, after being boiled, .must be dressed with a tablespoonful of Bechamel sauce, a little mignonette pepper, nutmeg, salt, fresh butter, and lemon juice; round these place a border of young carrots nicely glazed, and send to table. The braise in which the breast of veal is done should be freed from fat and clarified, and after being reduced to half glaze, served separately in a sauce-boat.

THE MODERN COOK 336 ROASTS Roast Hare Skin and draw a small hare, leaving on the ears, which must be scalded, and the hairs scraped off; pick out the eyes, and cut off the feet or pads, just above the first joint; wipe the hare with a clean cloth, and cut the sinews at the back of the hind-quarters and below the fore-legs. Prepare some veal-stuffing and fill the paunch with it; sew this up with string, or fasten it with a wooden skewer, then draw the legs under, as if the hare was in a sitting posture, set the head between the shoulders, and stick a small skewer through them, running also through the neck to secure its position; run another skewer through the four legs gathered up under the paunch, then take a piece of string, double it in two, placing the centre of it on the breast of the hare, and bring both ends over the skewer, cross the string over both sides of the other skewer, and fasten it over the back. Roast the hare before a brisk fire or in the oven for about one and a half hours, frequently basting it with butter or dripping. Five minutes before taking the hare up shake some flour over it with a dredger, and baste it with some fresh butter; when this froths up, and the hare has acquired a rich brown crust, dish up with water-cress round it, pour some brown gravy under, and send some currant jelly to table to be handed round. Roast Rabbit Truss one or more rabbits in the same manner as hares, then roast them before a brisk fire or in a hot oven, frequently basting them; ten minutes before taking them up, baste the rabbits with the following preparation :â€”Mix a gill of cream with a tablespoonful of flour, some chopped parsley, a yolk of egg, pepper, salt, and nutmeg; mask the rabbits entirely with this, and as soon as it has dried on them, baste them with some fresh butter. This not only adds to the attractive appearance of the rabbits, but it concentrates the gravy, and prevents them from becoming dry, which generally occurs when ordinarily roasted. When done, take the rabbits up with care to avoid breaking the light-brown crust formed upon them; dish up, pour some Liver sauce, prepared as follows, under them, and serve. Liver Sauce Boil the livers, chop them finely, and put them into a small stew-pan with chopped parsley, a small piece of glaze, a pat of butter, a gill of sauce, pepper and salt, grated lemon peel, nutmeg, and a gill of gravy; stir this over the fire until it boils, and use as directed above.

THE MODERN COOK I I 2 and put it to cool in the larder, reserving the liquor in which it has been stewed to be reduced and mixed with half a pint of Parisian sauce (see p. n) to be used for garnishing the turbot when dished up. When the turbot is cold, place it on a buttered baking-sheet and spread it over with a thin layer of reduced Allemande sauce, over which shake some very finely sifted bread-crumbs, fried to a light colour ; moisten the fish with a little consomme and wine, and put it in the oven about twenty minutes before sending it to table, that it may get thoroughly warm through; when about to dish it up, slide it gently off the baking-sheet on to a dish, and sauce it round with part of the Parisian sauce prepared for the purpose; garnish with oysters, button-mushrooms, and small round truffles tossed in a little glaze to give them a bright appearance. Send up the remainder of the sauce in a boat. Broiled Turbot a la Proven^ale Procure a small, plump turbot, make an incision in the back, and with a strong knife cut away an inch of the spine, trim the fins close, remove the dark skin, score it rather deep on the back, and then place it on an earthenware dish to steep for four hours in a marinade made of the following ingredients : sliced carrot, onion, sprigs of parsley, bay-leaf and thyme, one clove of garlic, pepper and salt, the juice of a lemon, and a gill of salad oil. Let the turbot be frequently rubbed and turned in this marinade that it may be thoroughly impreg- nated with its flavour. About three-quarters of an hour before dinner remove every particle of marinade from the turbot, place it, with the white side under, on a gridiron (previously rubbed with chalk or whitening), and set it to broil on a clear fire of moderate heat: twenty minutes will suffice to broil it on one side; it must then be carefully removed on to a deep baking-sheet, upon its back, first placing the whole of the marinade in the baking-sheet or dish; moisten with a glass or two of light white wine, and then put the turbot in the oven to bake, observing that it must be basted every five minutes with its liquor. When the turbot is done, lift it carefully on to its dish, put the whole of the marinade in which it has been baked into a stew-pan with a little more wine or stock, boil the whole together for five minutes, strain it with pressure through a tammy into a stew-pan, and reduce it with half a pint of Allemande sauce; add a pat of anchovy butter, some chopped and blanched parsley, a dessertspoonful of capers, and a little cayenne; garnish the turbot round with this sauce, adding groups of mussels fried in batter, and some lobster cut in scallops and tossed in lobster coral to give them a scarlet hue. Send some of the sauce to table in a boat. Turbot a la Careme Prepare a small turbot according to the foregoing directions, omitting the garlic; when it is done reduce the liquor and incor- porate it with half a pint of Dutch sauce, having Supreme sauce for its foundation ; add half an ounce of lobster butter, cayenne, and lemon juice ; work the sauce well together over the fire and pour it

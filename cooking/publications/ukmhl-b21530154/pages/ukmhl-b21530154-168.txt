THE MODERN COOK r54 Whitebait This very delicious fish is in season during the months of June, July, and August; it is then eaten in the greatest perfection at Greenwich and Blackwall. Owing to the extreme delicacy of this fish, and its very fragile nature, it cannot be conveyed any distance during the season without injuring its quality, neither can it be kept many hours after it has been taken. The following is the best method of preparing whitebait for the table:— Drain the fish on a clean napkin, thoroughly absorbing all the water; then roll them in flour, and afterwards drop them into some heated frying fat; as soon as they become crisp, drain them on a sieve, and after drying them for a minute or two before the fire, sprinkle on them a little salt, dish them on a napkin, and send to table accompanied by plates of white and brown bread and butter, and quarters of lemon—to be handed round with cayenne pepper. Scalloped Oysters Open two dozen oysters, and put them in a stew-pan on the fire to blanch or parboil; after boiling for a few minutes, drain them on a sieve, reserving the liquor to make the sauce with; immerse the oysters in cold water so as to wash off any scum that may adhere to them; take away the beard and gristly substance, and place the oysters thus prepared on a plate, while the sauce is being made in manner followingInto a small stew-pan put one ounce of fresh butter, one small dessertspoonful of flour, a very little pepper, and salt; with a wooden spoon mix the whole thoroughly, moisten with half a pint of oyster liquor and a good tablespoonful of cream, add a small piece of glaze, and then stir the sauce on the fire till it boils; keep stirring this for about ten minutes, by which time it will be sufficiently reduced to admit of the oysters being added to it; then squeeze in the juice of half a lemon, mix the whole well together, and after putting the oysters in the silver scallop-shells (or clean scoured oyster-shells will do), cover them with fried bread-crumbs. About ten minutes before serving place them in the oven till they are sufficiently hot to send to table, dish them on a napkin, and serve. Scalloped Oysters (another way) Prepare the oysters as in the preceding recipe; boil down their liquor to a fourth part of its original quantity, viz. a gill; add thereto a gill of white sauce, the yolk of one egg, a little grated nutmeg, cayenne pepper, and the juice of half a lemon, a teaspoonful of essence of anchovies or a similar quantity of Harvey sauce; and, after stirring the whole over the fire for five minutes, the oysters should be mixed in, and then, after being placed neatly in the shells, finished as directed in the preceding recipe. Scalloped mussels, cockles, shrimps, lobsters, or crayfish may be prepared in like manner; a little essence of anchovies should, however, be added to the sauce for all these—except mussels and cockles; and for lobsters the coral should be added also.

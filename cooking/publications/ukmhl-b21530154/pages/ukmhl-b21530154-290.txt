THE MODERN COOK 276 ENTREES OF VENISON Haricot of Venison Trim and cut a small neck of venison into cutlets without paring off any of the fat, season them with pepper and salt, and fry them brown on both sides before they are half done; then pour off all the fat, shake a dessertspoonful of flour over the cutlets, and toss them over the fire for three minutes, moisten with a glass or two of red wine and a pint of good stock ; add a gill of small button-onions, and the same amount of turnips and carrots cut into small fanciful shapes of the size of the onions, and a bunch of herbs; stir the haricot over the fire with a wooden spoon until it boils, and then remove it to the side to continue gently boiling for about an hour and a half; when tender, remove the cutlets into a deep stew-pan; then add the vegetables, and after the sauce has boiled up and been skimmed, reduce it, if necessary, to a proper consistency, and pass through a tammy or fine strainer into the stew-pan containing the cutlets, etc. ; add a little salt if needed; simmer the whole together on the fire, dish the cutlets in the usual way, fill the centre with the vegetables, pour the sauce over the entree, and serve. Ragout of Venison Fry the cutlets brown, pour off all the fat, add a glass or two of red wine, half a pint of Espagnole, and the same proportion of consomme, season with a carrot, an onion, a stick of celery, and a bunch of herbs; leave to simmer gently by the side of the fire until the cutlets are tender; they must then be removed into another stew-pan with a little of the sauce to warm them in, the lid put on, and kept warm. The remainder of the sauce must be strained through a fine strainer into a smaller stew-pan; and after it has been clarified, by gently boiling it by the side of the fire, and thoroughly skimming off all that rises to the surface, reduce it by boiling to its proper consistency, and pass it through a tammy or fine strainer into a bain-marie. When about to send to table, dish the cutlets up, fill the centre with some glazed carrots and turnips, previously prepared for the purpose; place some groups of small glazed button-onions round the entree, pour the sauce over the cutlets, and serve. A neat frill of paper may be put on the bone of each cutlet. Civet of Venison This dish, although not very choice, is often served; in general, the inferior parts of venison—such as the shoulder and scrag end of the neck—are used for this purpose. The venison must be cut up into pieces, and for its preparation follow the directions for making a civet of hare (see p. 319).

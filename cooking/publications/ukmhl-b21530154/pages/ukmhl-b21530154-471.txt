JELLIES AND FRUIT DISHES 457 quarter of an inch up the sides, and when this has become set, pour as much of the plain jelly upon it; when this has set, repeat another layer of the pink jelly, and go on alternating the different coloured layers until the mould is filled. The design for this kind of jelly may be varied, according to taste, as follows :— Fill two small plain moulds w'ith different coloured jelly, such as pink and white noyau, or amber and very light-pink orange jelly, and when these are firm, turn the jellies out of their respective moulds. Next set a plain mould in ice, and then cut the different coloured jellies into strips, or any kind of fancy-shaped ornaments, which must be so managed as to admit of their being fitted into each other, thus entirely covering the bottom of the mould with the design so formed; a little of the jelly must first be poured at the bottom of the mould to cause the decoration to stick firmly. The sides of the mould should then be ornamented by placing alternate strips of the different jellies in a perpendicular position, and these must first be dipped in a little liquid jelly. The mould being thus lined, the hollow may be filled up with either a Macedoine jelly of fruits, with any kind of cream, or with the remainder of the jelly so arranged as to look like cut marble. Russian Jelly Put about two-thirds of either of the above kinds of jelly into a basin, set in ice, then whip the rest of the jelly with a whisk until it becomes frothy and begins to thicken; it must then be immediately poured into a mould, and kept on ice until required. Punch Jelly Put one and a half pints of the prepared stock from four calf’s feet into a stew-pan to melt on the fire; then withdraw it, and add the following ingredients : six ounces of loaf-sugar, the rind and juice of two lemons and two oranges, half a nutmeg, four cloves, half a stick of cinnamon, a gill of rum, and a glass of brandy. Stir these well together, then add two whites of eggs and shells whisked up, and continue whisking the punch over a brisk fire until it begins to simmer, then leave by the side of the fire and cover the stew-pan; about ten minutes after, pour the jelly into a flannel bag, previously heated by pouring through hot water, keep pouring the jelly back into the bag until it becomes quite clear and bright, and when the whole has run through, set in ice in the usual way. Oranges filled with Jelly Choose half-a-dozen oranges without specks on the rind, make a hole at the stalk end with a circular tin cutter, about half an inch in diameter, and then use the handle of a small teaspoon to remove all the pulp and loose pith from the interior; then soak the oranges in cold water for about an hour, push the spoon through the hole and scrape the insides smooth, rinse again in cold water and drain on a cloth. Next stop up any holes that may have been made in them

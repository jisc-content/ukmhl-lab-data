When the paste has stood five minutes, sprinkle some flour over the slab and on the paste, then roll out to a long strip; this must be then folded into three, and after turning the paste round so as to bring the sides to face you, roll out again in a similar manner; after an interval of about ten minutes, repeat the rolling1 twice more, when the paste will be ready for use.

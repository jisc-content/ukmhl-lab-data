345 VEGETABLES AND SALADS crumbs over them, and place in a saute-pan thickly spread with butter; put them in the oven for about a quarter of an hour to gratinate, and then dish up in a pyramidal form; pour some Brown Italian sauce round, and serve. Truffles a la Serviette Wash and brush twelve large fresh truffles, drain them, and then place in a casserole lined with thin layers of fat bacon; pour some wine mirepoix (see p. 57) over, place some layers of bacon on the top, and put on the fire; the lid must then be put on, and hermeti- cally sealed with stiff flour and water paste to preserve the flavour of the truffles. Leave to simmer gently by the side of a slow fire or in the oven for about three-quarters of an hour, then dish up, and send the following sauce separately in a sauce-boat:—Mix half a gill of the finest salad oil with a tablespoonful of chopped parsley, the juice of a lemon, some mignonette pepper, a little salt, and a table- spoonful of half-glaze (made by boiling down about a gill of the mirepoix in which the truffles have been boiled), and send to table in a sauce-boat. Truffles a la Piemontaise Slice half a pound of prepared fresh truffles, place them in a saute- pan with three tablespoonfuls of Lucca oil, one of chopped parsley, a little chopped thyme, a clove of garlic, some mignonette pepper, and salt; fry over a brisk fire for five minutes, remove the garlic, then add half a pint of Italian or Espagnole sauce, a small piece of glaze, and the juice of half a lemon; toss the whole together over the fire, and pour it over the hollow crusts of two baked French rolls from which the top crust part has been removed. Spanish Onions a 1’Espagnole Peel four to six onions, and stamp out the cores with a long vegetable cutter about a quarter of an inch in diameter; parboil them in water for ten minutes, and then drain them upon a cloth. Spread the bottom of a deep stew-pan with butter, place the onions in it, moisten with enough stock to just cover them, and leave them to boil gently over a slow fire for three hours, occasionally turning them in their liquor; when they are nearly done, add a dessertspoonful of castor sugar, boil them down quickly to a glaze, and when this is done roll the onions in it, and dish them up in a close circle. Next pour a gill of bright Espagnole sauce into the remainder of the glaze, boil together over the fire, pour round the onions, and serve. Note.—These onions are better adapted for garnishing removes of braised beef, etc., than for being served as a second-course dish. Artichokes with Butter Sauce Trim the bottoms of six globe artichokes, cut off the tips of the leaves, and boil them in water with a little salt for about three- quarters of an hour; when done, drain, and plunge in cold water for

243 ENTREES OF BEEF table put the cases in the oven to get thoroughly wanned; dish up neatly in a pyramidal form, and serve some Fine Herbs or Brown Italian sauce separately in a boat. Croustades or Patties of Beef Marrow In this case, the beef marrow must be prepared according to the first part of the directions for dressing them a la Ravigote ; they must then be cut into half-inch lengths, and placed in a small stew-pan, with about half their quantity of prepared mushrooms; to this may be added some finished Espagnole sauce, a little cayenne and lemon juice. Warm the whole together on the fire, and fill the croustades or patties with it. Ox=Tongue with Spinach Soak a pickled tongue for two hours, run an iron skewer through it from the root to the pointed end, tie a piece of string on one end of the skewer, and fasten it at the other, so as to keep it in shape. The tongue should then be put on the fire in enough cold water to cover, and kept gently boiling for about three hours, when it must be taken up, the outer skin removed, and placed in the larder to cool.

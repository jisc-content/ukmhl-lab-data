THE MODERN COOK 56 White Poele for Poultry Cut into dice-shaped pieces half a pound of beef suet, one pound of veal, and the same kind of vegetables, etc., as described in the above-mentioned braise; to these add the juice and pulp of one lemon, removing the pips; put these ingredients into a middle-sized stew-pan with two or three ounces of butter, and stir them on a slow fire until the suet is quite melted; then add two quarts of common broth, and keep the poele gently boiling for an hour; it should then be passed through a sieve into an earthen pan, and reserved for the purpose of braising poultry in. Note.â€”The two foregoing preparations, although very desirable in imparting a rich succulent flavour to poultry, game, etc., are neverthe- less to be regarded rather as luxurious than essential. Good white or brown stock, as the case may require, can be used as economical substitutes. Frying- Batter for Fillets of Fish, Poultry, Game, etc., a la Horly, or a la Royale Put into a basin four ounces of sifted flour, a little salt, one yolk of egg, and half an ounce of fresh butter previously melted in a small stew-pan; to these add gradually about a gill of tepid water, and stir the whole' together with a wooden spoon until the batter has acquired the consistency and appearance of rich-looking double cream ; it may then be put aside in the larder until within half an hour of its being wanted, when the whites of two eggs, well whisked into a snow-like froth, should be incorporated with it. Frying Batter, for all Sorts of Fruit Fritters Put into a basin four ounces of sifted flour, one ounce of fresh butter (melted), one wine-glassful of Curagoa, and a very little salt; mix these gently together with a wooden spoon, gradually pouring into the basin about half a gill of bitter ale. When the batter becomes mixed to the thickness of double cream, set it aside while you whisk the whites of two eggs into a substantial froth, and instantly incorporate this with it. Many prefer such fritters as pineapple, peach, apricot, or plum, fried with a plainer kind of batter, in making which water is substi- tuted for ale. Boiled Marinade Cut into slices and put into a stew-pan one carrot, one onion, and a stick of celery, to which add a few leaves of parsley, a bay-leaf, thyme and sweet basil, half-a-dozen cloves, a blade of mace, a clove of garlic, and two ounces of raw ham (cut into small square pieces), a tablespoonful of peppercorns, and two ounces of butter. Stir these ingredients together over the fire until they become lightly browned ; then pour over them a quart of French white wine vinegar, and let the marinade boil quickly for five minutes, then add one pint of common stock ; allow the whole to boil gently for one hour; strain

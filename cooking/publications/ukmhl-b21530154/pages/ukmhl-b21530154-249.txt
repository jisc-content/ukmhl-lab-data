235 ENTREES OF BEEF unless otherwise ordered; they will take from five to seven minutes at the most. When done, place them on a dish, season with salt and pepper, and brush over with meat glaze. Prepare beforehand the following farce :â€”Wash the livers and cut them into fine slices. Fry the finely chopped shalot in butter, put in the liver, and toss over the fire for a few minutes, season, pound in a mortar with the foie gras and a large tablespoonful of brown sauce, pass through a sieve, divide the farce into eight portions, and spread over one side of the eight fillets. Place each on rounds of fried bread, poach in a hot oven for a few seconds only, brush over with meat glaze, dish up, place a slice of truffle on top of each, and serve with demi-glace sauce. Fillets of Beef a la Seymour Cut some thin slices of fillet of beef, trim them, and sauffl them in butter. Season to taste, and place each on an artichoke-bottom previously heated and seasoned, dish up in a circle, cover each with a well-flavoured Bearnaise sauce (see p. 468), place a slice of truffle on each, and fill the centre with stuffed French olives. Sauce over with demi-glace, and serve.

J ust before dinner-time simmer the cutlets over a slow fire for about five minutes, turn them over when done on the under side, and allow them to remain two minutes longer; pour off the butter, add a little glaze and a gill of the sauce, toss them in this, and dish up in a close circle placing one of the croutons (previously warmed) between each cutlet; fill the centre with slices of the kidneys and small fillets tossed in a little of the sauce, pour the sauce round, and serve. Escallops of Hare with Fine Herbs Cut the fillets of a small hare into escallops, flatten them slightly, trim neatly, and place in a stew-pan with clarified butter, season with pepper and salt, and fry on both sides over a brisk fire for about five minutes; pour off the butter, add a pint of Fine Herbs sauce (see p. 5); simmer the escallops over the fire for two minutes, pile them up in the centre of the dish, pour the sauce over, garnish round with croquettes made with the hind-quarters, as on p. 317, and serve.

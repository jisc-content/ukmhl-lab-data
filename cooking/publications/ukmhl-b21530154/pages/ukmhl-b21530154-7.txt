PREFACE CHARLES ElmE Francatelli was an earnest and gifted worker in the cause of gastronomy, and his great work, The Modern Cook, compiled nearly three-quarters of a century ago, faithfully reflects the dining habits of our Victorian ancestors, and the nature of their dietary. Everything was good and solid of its kind, even if tending towards complica- tion rather than simplicity. The great joints, decorated with their silver hatelet skewers bearing cocks’ combs and trufflets, were attended by the most appetising ragouts and garnishes. The essence and sauces were wonderful prepara- tions of the most heterogeneous of ingredients, and combined with rare subtlety. No pains were spared to please the eye by embellishing the outer surface of the ornamental timbales and casseroles and dressed entrees, or to gratify the palate by the excellence of their contents. There was, further- more, nothing meretricious or deceptive in the savoury promises held out by Victorian comestibles. Even Paper Bag Cookery finds its counterpart in The Modern Cook, in the numerous recipes for mullets, trout, sweetbreads, ortolans, etc., “ in cases,” or “ en papillottes.” But even whilst PTancatelli was committing to paper the results of a laborious lifetime devoted to progress in culinary matters, a transformation was creeping over the nature of his art. Thanks to improvements in agriculture, greater facilities in rapid transport and closer communica- tion with our Continental neighbours, our dietary had already begun to shed some of its grosser characteristics.

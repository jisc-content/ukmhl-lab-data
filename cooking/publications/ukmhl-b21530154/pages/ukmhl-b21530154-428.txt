This paste must now be gently stirred over the fire for three or four minutes longer, and then prepared as follows :â€” Cut the paste into four equal parts. Flour the slab, roll out each of the four pieces to about a quarter of an inch thick; these squares must now be placed on baking-sheets, previously buttered and floured; and, after being deeply marked out or cut into small oblong squares, must be rubbed over with a paste-brush dipped in water to remove the flour from the surface. Next bake the Leckerlets in a moderate oven until a light brown, and when about three parts done, cut the paste through into shape, brush over with some thin white icing, and replace in the oven to finish cooking. Break up the cakes as marked out, and put when cold away in a tin box in a dry place. These cakes are well adapted for dessert or luncheon.

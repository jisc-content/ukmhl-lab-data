THE MODERN COOK 93 stock-pot on a moderate fire to boil for ten minutes or so; then add three pints from the common stock or any white broth you may have ready, set it to boil on the stove, skim it well, and after four hours’ gentle boiling, take the calf’s feet out and put them in water to clean them; then take all the bones out, and lay them on a dish to cool, to be trimmed afterwards so as to leave the inner part of the feet only, all the outer skin being thinly pared off that the feet may have a more transparent appearance; cut them into inch lengths by half an inch in width and put them by in a small sauce-pan till required. Strain the consommt: through a napkin, thicken it moderately with a little white roux (going through the regular process for making white Veloute), then add to it a dessertspoonful of essence of mushrooms, and finish by incorporating with the sauce thus prepared a liaison of two yolks of eggs mixed with a teaspoonful of grated Parmesan and a gill of cream ; squeeze the juice of half a lemon into it, and season with a pinch of cayenne. Pour the soup into a tureen containing two dozen very small quenelles (made with the fillets of the old hen), two tablespoonfuls of boiled macaroni cut into inch lengths, and the tendons of the calfs feet, previously warmed in a little consomme, with the addition of half a glass of white wine. Stir the soup gently in the tureen to mix these in- gredients together, and send to table. Hare Soup Skin and paunch a hare, and cut it up as follows:—First take off the legs close to the loins and divide them into three pieces, slip the shoulders off and cut them into two parts, cut the back into six pieces, and divide the head in halves. Next place a stew-pan on the stove-fire containing four ounces of butter, a carrot, two onions, a head of celery cut into small slices, and fry these to a light colour ; then add the pieces of hare, over which, when also fried brown, shake a good handful of flour and moisten with half a bottle of port wine, at the same time adding a bouquet of herbs, three cloves, a blade of mace, and two quarts of veal stock; stir the whole on the fire until it boils, then take it off and set it by the side to boil gently for an hour and a quarter, taking care in the meantime to skim off the butter, etc., as it rises to the surface. Take out the pieces of hare when done from the soup and place them on a dish; select the finest pieces of meat, remove the bones, and set these pieces aside in a soup-pot; clear the remainder of the meat from the bones, and pound it thoroughly with the vegetables from the soup; when these are pounded mix them again with the soup and pass the whole through a tammy into a puree, and pour it on to the pieces of hare reserved in the soup-pot. This soup must not be thick, consequently it may be necessary after passing it through the tammy to add a little veal stock to thin it. Just before sending to table make the soup hot, but be careful that it does not boil; ascertain that its seasoning is correct, and serve.

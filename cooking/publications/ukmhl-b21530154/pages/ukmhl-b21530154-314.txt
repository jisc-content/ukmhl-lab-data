THE MODERN COOK 3°° Another Method Trim the legs and mince the flesh as before. Next put an ounce of fresh butter in a small stew-pan over the fire to melt, add a tablespoonful of flour, and stir these together for two minutes; then add about a gill of broth, and the same proportion of cream or milk; season with pepper and salt, grated nutmeg, and a small piece of glaze; stir this sauce on the fire, keep it boiling for ten minutes, and then add it to the minced chicken. In all other respects, serve this entree in the same way as the previous recipe. Minced Chicken and Poached Eggs Cut up all the white meat of half a roast or boiled fowl into shreds, or mince finely, and put these into a small stew-pan with half a pint of good Bechamel sauce; when about to send to table, warm the mince, dish it up, and place four poached eggs round it with a fried crouton of bread in between each egg; pour a little white sauce round the entree, and serve. Minced Chicken with Macaroni In this case cut half a cooked chicken in small thin slices, and mix with a gill of Bechamel; when about to dish up, first place some macaroni (dressed with grated Parmesan cheese and a little Bechamel sauce) round the bottom of the dish in the form of a border, and put the mince in the centre piled up like a cone; pour a little white sauce round the entree, and serve. Minced Chicken with Rice Prepare the mince as before. Put four ounces of Carolina rice, after it has been well washed, into a stew-pan with a pat of butter and a pint of stock, a little salt and mignonette pepper; place over a slow fire to boil very gently until the grains are quite soft, and all the moisture is absorbed; then add the yolk of an egg, and a good tablespoonful of white sauce; mould the rice with a wooden spoon, then fill a buttered circular border mould with it, and turn it out upon a dish; fill the centre with the mince, and serve. Minced Fowl au Gratin Cut the meat off the breast and other white parts of half a roast or boiled fowl, and chop either into shreds or larger slices; put these into a small stew-pan with a gill of Allemande sauce, a dessert- spoonful of grated Parmesan cheese, a little nutmeg, pepper and salt, a small piece of glaze and a tablespoonful of cream; toss the whole together over the fire until well mixed, and then place the scallops in the dish, piled up in a dome; cover this entirely with a coating of fried bread-crumbs mixed with grated Parmesan cheese, in the proportion of two-thirds of the former with one-third of the latter; sprinkle a very little clarified butter over the surface, place round the entree a border of neatly cut fancy crofitons of bread, or croquettes of rice, or fried potatoes, and then put it into the oven for about ten minutes, taking care that it does not get burnt. Pour some Bechamel sauce round the base of the entree, and serve.

THE MODERN COOK 36 Garnish of Button Onions for Matelote Peel half a pint of small button onions, boil them in water for five minutes, drain them on a napkin, and afterwards place them in a small stew-pan with one ounce of clarified butter and a pinch of pounded sugar; then place the stew-pan on a slow fire and fry the onions to a light-brown colour, taking care to toss them up now and then that they may be equally coloured; when sufficiently coloured they will be nearly done. Then place them on a sieve to allow the butter to drain, and put them in a small stew-pan with a lump of sugar and a good gill of consomme; lastly, set them on the fire and boil them down to a glaze. Garnish of White Button Onions Peel and blanch half a pint of small button onions, put them into a stew-pan with a pat of butter, a lump of sugar, a little salt, and a half pint of white broth; set them on the fire to boil gently for half an hour, then boil them down quickly to a glaze, and finish by adding a dessertspoonful of Allemande sauce. Garnish of Windsor Beans Boil half a pint of young Windsor beans, peel off their husks, and place them in a saute-pan with a little pepper, salt, and nutmeg, a pat of butter, and two tablespoonfuls of Bechamel sauce; throw in a teaspoonful of chopped and blanched parsley, and a little winter savory; shake the whole well together over the fire, and place them in the centre of an entree. Garnish of French Beans Cut one or two handfuls of French beans into the shape of diamonds, boil them green, drain them on a napkin, and then put them into a saute-pan with a pat of butter, a little pepper and salt, a tablespoonful of white sauce, and a little lemon juice; toss them well together on the fire, and serve. Garnish of Artichoke Bottoms Remove the outer leaves from two globe artichokes; pare off with a knife the green surface from the bottom of the artichokes, so as to render them smooth and white; rub over each artichoke as it is finished with lemon juice, and instantly throw it into a basin of water in which a little vinegar has been mixed; then boil them in a stew- pan containing hot water, a piece of butter, mignonette pepper, salt, and a little lemon juice. When they are done, take them out, and after allowing them to cool extract the hay or inside fibres; trim them, and divide each artichoke into six pieces. Then place them in a saute-pan with a gill of Supreme sauce, a pat of butter, a table- spoonful of cream, nutmeg, and sugar; toss them gently on the fire, and, when the whole is well mixed, serve.

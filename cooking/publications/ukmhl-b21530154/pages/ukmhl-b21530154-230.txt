2l6 THE MODERN COOK Sausage Pudding Procure a pound of Cambridge sausages, and twist each one into round balls; put these into boiling water on the stove, merely to parboil them for a minute or so, then throw them into cold water and afterwards remove the skins. Line a medium pudding-basin with suet crust, fill it with the sausages, and pour a preparation made as follows upon them:—Chop one onion and three sage leaves, boil these in water for two minutes, drain them, and then fry them in a small stew-pan with a piece of butter; as soon as they turn a light- brown colour, add a teaspoonful of flour and a teaspoonful of curry paste, season with pepper and salt, and moisten with a gill of good broth; stir the sauce upon the fire, and when it has boiled a quarter of an hour, strain and use as above directed. Cover the pudding with crust, steam or bake it for two hours, and when turned out of the basin, send to table with plain gravy under it. BLACK GAME AND GROUSE Black Game a la Montagnarde Cut off the legs and wings of one or more birds, tuck the thighs inside, and split them down the back : season well with pepper and salt, rub them over with a paste-brush dipped in clarified butter, and then broil them carefully on a gridiron over a clear fire perfectly free from smoke; or place the birds in a baking-dish with a piece of butter • set them to bake in the oven, and baste them frequently. When done, glaze them nicely, and dish them up with a border of potato croquettes, and then pour under them some Poivrade sauce. Black Game a l’ltalienne Truss one or more birds as for boiling, put them into an oval stew-pan with a bouquet garni, two carrots, a stick of celery, two onions each stuck with three cloves, a blade of mace, six pepper- corns, and a clove of garlic ; moisten with a pint of good stock; place a buttered paper on the top, put the lid on, and set them to braise on a very slow fire, with some hot embers on the lid. If the birds are young, one hour and a quarter will suffice to braise them; but if old, they will require longer time. When the birds are done, drain, glaze, and dish them up, garnish with three to four ounces of macaroni mixed with two ounces of grated Parmesan cheese, a table- spoonful of Tomato sauce, and a small pat of fresh butter; pour some Brown Italian sauce over the birds and round their base, and serve. Black Game a la Suedoise These must be trussed as for boiling, and then placed in an oval stew-pan with a quarter of a pound of streaky bacon and a quarter of a pound of German sausage, a good-sized carrot, a stick of celery, two onions stuck with four cloves each, a bouquet garni, and a tea- spoonful of black peppercorns; moisten with a pint of stock or

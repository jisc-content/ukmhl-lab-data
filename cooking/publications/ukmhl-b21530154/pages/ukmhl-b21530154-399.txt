SANDWICHES 385 pots, wipe them clean, and pour a little clarified fresh butter over the surface before serving. Note.—All kinds of game should be potted in the above manner, and will then keep fresh for months. If liked, more spice and herbs may be added; but too much seasoning spoils the flavour of the game. Potted Fowl and Tongue Pare off all the meat from the breast of a roast fowl, chop and pound it thoroughly with a few slices of boiled red tongue or dressed ham; add two ounces of clarified fresh butter, a small piece of glaze (made with the bones of the fowl), and a gill of good Bechamel sauce; season with cayenne pepper, nutmeg, and salt; and when the whole has been thoroughly mixed by pounding, rub through a fine wire-sieve, and then finish as directed for potted pheasant. Potted Lobster Take the meat, pith, and coral out of the shell of a small fresh lobster; cut up in slices, and put the whole into a stew-pan with one ounce of clarified fresh butter and one whole anchovy (washed and wiped dry); season with mace, peppercorns, and a little salt, then put the lid on the stew-pan and leave to simmer very gently over a slow fire for about a quarter of an hour. Then thoroughly pound in a mortar, rub through a sieve, put the pur£e into small moulds, steam, and when cold press down with the back of a spoon, and cover the surface with a little clarified butter. Potted Prawns or Shrimps Pick half a pint of fresh-boiled prawns or shrimps, and reserve the heads and shells; pound them in a mortar with two anchovies (previously washed and wiped dry for the purpose), and then rub the whole through a hair-sieve, and put the produce with the picked shrimps into a stew-pan with one and a half ounces of clarified fresh butter; season with some grated nutmeg, cayenne pepper, and a little salt; simmer the whole together over a slow fire for about ten minutes, then toss the shrimps in the seasoning occasionally until they become nearly cold; they must then be put into pots, with a little clarified butter poured over the surface, and set aside in a cool place for use. Potted Bloaters Take two or three cured bloaters, plunge them in scalding water, and remove the skins; wipe them dry, take out the bones, and put the fillets of herrings into a stew-pan with two ounces of clarified fresh butter, a blade of mace, and enough cayenne to season; leave to simmer for about ten minutes, then thoroughly pound the whole well together in a mortar and rub it through a sieve. Put this preparation into pots, pour a little clarified butter over the surface, and keep in a cool place for use. Note.—Smoked or kippered salmon, or Finnan haddocks, may

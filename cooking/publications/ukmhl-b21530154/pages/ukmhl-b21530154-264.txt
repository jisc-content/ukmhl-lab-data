Next, cut these fillets into neatly trimmed scallops and place them in circular order in a stew-pan with two ounces of clarified butter; season with pepper and salt, and fry over a brisk fire until browned on both sides; then pour off the fat, and add one pint of Fine Herbs sauce; allow the whole to simmer together over the fire for three minutes, and then dish up the scallops, either in a pyramidal form, in a close circle, or else on an ornamental border of potato or rice. These scallops may also be garnished with a border of croquettes of mutton, mushrooms, potatoes, or rice. Note.—The garnishes here alluded to will serve for mutton scallops generally.

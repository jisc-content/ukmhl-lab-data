SAUCES IN GENERAL 7 by pressing them in a napkin; pound the herbs thus prepared in a mortar, with two ounces of butter ; after which rub them through a fine sieve with a wooden spoon, and place in a small basin, to be kept on ice or in a cool place. About five minutes before requiring the sauce for use put into a small stew-pan a gill of Allemande, and, when thoroughly warmed, mix in with it the prepared Ravigote, in sufficient quantity to give a bright-green colour to the sauce; add a tablespoonful of tarragon vinegar, and the same quantities of Chili vinegar and of Harvey sauce, previously reduced, by boiling, to half the quantity. This sauce is very generally used for fillets of fish. Tomato Sauce Procure a pound of fine ripe tomatoes, and, having first picked off the stalks, extract the seeds and watery parts by squeezing them separately in the hand ; then place them in a stew-pan containing one ounce of raw ham cut into dice, two shalots, a bay-leaf, and a sprig of thyme, fried in one and a half ounces of butter until they become brown; put the tomatoes with these on the fire until they are melted; then, after having passed them through the tammy into a purÂ£e, mix the produce with half a pint of Veloute sauce, a small teaspoonful of glaze, and half a pint of consomme; stir the sauce on the fire till it boils, and then set it by the side of the stove to continue boiling gently, that it may clear itself; skim it thoroughly, and pour it into a bain- marie for use.

Perigueux Sauce Chop three or four truffles extremely fine, put them into a stew-pan with one glass of white wine, an ounce of lean ham, a sprig of thyme, and a bay-leaf; set these to boil gently on the stove-fire for a few minutes, then add a gill of brown sauce and a gill of consomme; stir the sauce on the fire till it boils, and then set it by the side to clear itself; skim it well, take out the ham, the bay-leaf, the thyme, and, after reducing it to a proper consistency, pour it into a bain- marie for use. Just before dinner-time, add an ounce of butter to soften the flavour. Lyonnaise Sauce Peel two Spanish onions, cut them in halves, trim off the ends so as to leave the onions an inch and a half thick; slice them across that the pieces may separate at the junction of the several folds, or layers, of the onion; fry them in a deep saute-pan, in a gill of salad oil; as soon as they assume a fine light colour, drain them on a hair-sieve, and afterwards lay them on a napkin in order to extract all the oil; after which put them into a small stew-pan with a good

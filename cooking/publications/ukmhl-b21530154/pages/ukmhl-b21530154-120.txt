4 io(5 THE MODERN COOK few minutes, moisten with a glass of Sauterne wine, and add a quart of good consomme; stir this sauce on the fire till it boils, then set it by the side to continue gently simmering for half an hour, and rub it through the tammy like any other puree; then take it up and pour it into a small basin. Just before dinner-time make the soup hot, and finish by incorporating with it a liaison of two yolks of eggs, a little cayenne, the juice of a lemon, and one ounce of grated Parmesan cheese ; pour the soup into the tureen containing one and a half dozen of scallops of any sort of fish (crimped cod or whiting is the best for the purpose) prepared as follows :—Cut two slices of crimped cod into small scallops, and put them into a deep saute-pan with a little oil, mignonette pepper, and a little salt, some chopped tarragon and chervil, and a teaspoonful of lemon juice; fry these on the fire, pour them into the soup-tureen, and when the soup is poured on them, throw in a handful of duchess’ crusts fried in butter or oil, and send to table. Borsch or Polish Soup Place in a good-sized stock-pot a pound of knuckle of veal, an old hen partially roasted and coloured, a couple of marrow bones, a quarter of a pound of streaky lean bacon (trimmed and parboiled for the purpose), one carrot, one stick of celery, and one onion stuck with cloves ; also a bunch of parsley tied together with a little thyme, sweet basil, bay-leaf, and mace; then add a teaspoonful of white peppercorns. Fill the stock-pot up with two quarts of prepared beet- root juice,1 set it upon the fire to boil, and after being skimmed, let it boil gently by the side of the fire for an hour; then add a duck, a partridge (trussed for boiling), and a quarter of a pound of pork sausages. See that the above ingredients are not overdone, and be careful to take them up directly they are sufficiently braised ; then place them on a dish, and set them in the larder to get cold. While the stock is in preparation peel one small raw beetroot and shred it, also one onion, and a small stick of celery as if for Julienne soup ; fry these vegetables in a little butter to a light colour, moisten with half a pint of broth from the boiling stock, and having gently boiled them down to the consistency of a demi-glaze, set them in a basin in the larder. Then chop two ounces of fillet of beef with the same quantity of beef suet, add a little pepper, salt, and nutmeg, and one yolk of egg; pound this force-meat thoroughly, and use half of it to make eighteen small round quenelles, by rolling them with a little flour on the table; poach these in a little broth, and having drained them upon a napkin, add them to the vegetables put by in the basin. With the remainder of the force-meat make the same number of very small oval quenelles, which, after being rolled 1 The beetroot juice to be used in the borsch is made as follows :—Procure three or four fine beetroots, scraped and washed, bruise them in a mortar, and place them in an earthen pan, into which throw two quarts of water and four ounces of bread- crumb. Cover the pan with the lid, carefully cementing it down with a paste of flour and water in order to exclude the air ; and set the pan in a moderately warm place, so as to accelerate the fermentation. Ten days will suffice to produce the desired result ; on uncovering the pan it will be found to contain a bright red acidulated liquor.

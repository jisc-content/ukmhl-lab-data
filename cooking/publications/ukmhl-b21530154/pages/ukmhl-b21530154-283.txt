Next cover the bottom of a saute-pan with some melted aspic jelly, not quite a quarter of an inch deep; when this has become set firm, by cooling, place the cutlets flat upon it, in circular order, then pour a little aspic jelly over them, just enough to cover them, and place the saute-pan on ice, to set the jelly; as soon as this has become quite firm, use a cutter (in the form of a cutlet) dipped in hot water to stamp the cutlets out; dish up in circular order upon a little aspic jelly, placed on the bottom of the dish, to raise the cutlets, and garnish the centre with a well-prepared Macedoine of vegetables (see p. 35) tossed in some bright aspic jelly, instead of sauce; ornament with a border of bold croutons of jelly, and serve.

When about to send to table, fry the cutlets a light golden colour, drain upon a sheet of paper, glaze and dish up ; fill the centre with asparagus peas (see p. 35), pour some thin Espagnole or half-glaze round them, and serve.

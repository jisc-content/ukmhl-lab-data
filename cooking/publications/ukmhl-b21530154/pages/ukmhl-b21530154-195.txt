REMOVES OF LEGS, LOINS, AND NECKS OF MUTTON Boiled Leg of Mutton a l’Anglaise Choose a small leg of mutton, rather fat, and that has not hung more than three or four days; trim it, and put it on to boil in a stock-pot or braising-pan filled up with hot water; when it boils, remove the scum, and put it on the side of the stove to continue gently boiling for about one hour and a half: a tablespoonful of salt and a couple of turnips and carrots should be put into the pot to boil with the leg. When the mutton is done, drain and dish it up, garnish it round with mashed turnips dressed with a little sweet cream, a pat of butter, pepper and salt; mould the mashed turnips in the shape of large eggs with a tablespoon, and place these closely round the leg of mutton, introducing between each spoonful of mashed turnips a carrot cut into fancy shapes that has been boiled, either with the mutton or separately; pour some gravy under it, put a paper ruffle on the bone, and send it to table accompanied with a sauce-boat full of Caper sauce (see p. 181).

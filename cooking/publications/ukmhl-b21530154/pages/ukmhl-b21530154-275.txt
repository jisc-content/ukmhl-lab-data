261 ENTREES OF VEAL Croquettes of Veal Cut half a pound of roasted veal into very small dice, or mince finely; add this to about four ounces of minced mushrooms, truffles, or red tongue. Next reduce by boiling three-quarters of a pint of Allemande, Bechamel, Veloute, or Supreme sauce; and when it has become rather stiff, throw in the mince; season with a little pepper and grated nutmeg; stir the whole well together, and then spread the preparation on a dish, about an inch thick; smooth over with the blade of a knife, cover with buttered paper, and put into the larder to cool. It must then be divided into about ten to twelve pieces, and each of these rolled in bread-crumbs, in the form of a cork, a round ball, or in the shape of a pear, and after being dipped in some beaten egg, must again be rolled in bread-crumbs and placed on a dish till within twenty minutes of dinner-time; the croquettes must then be fried in hot fat, and when done, drained to absorb all fat, then dished up with fried parsley, and served immediately. Note.â€”When croquettes are shaped in the form of pears, some parsley stalks of equal lengths should be stuck in at the pointed ends, before they are fried, to imitate the stalk of a pear. Veal and Ham Fillets with Italian Sauce Procure about one pound of veal, either from the leg, the chump- end of the loin, or best end of the neck: cut into round or oval fillets, season with pepper and salt, and place in a stew-pan with some clarified butter; an equal number of similarly cut slices of ham may either be put with these, or separately. Fry the veal and ham slices brown, pour off the fat, add the Brown Italian sauce and some button-mushrooms; simmer the whole together for three minutes, dish up, alternately placing a fillet of veal with the ham ; fill the centre with the mushrooms, pour the sauce round the entree, and serve. Scotch Collops Use about one pound of veal and trim the collops as in the foregoing recipe, season with parsley and shalots chopped finely, pepper and salt; dip in egg and bread-crumbs, and place the collops in a stew-pan with a little clarified butter; prepare also a dozen small round quenelles with some highly-seasoned veal force-meat. When about to send to table, fry the collops of veal a golden brown, glaze them, and dish in a close circle ; fill the centre with the quenelles (previously poached), pour a little thickened brown gravy with a little glaze in it, or some well-finished Espagnole sauce, round the entree, and serve. Minced Veal with Poached Eggs Pare off the outside part of eight ounces of veal, and then let it be minced very finely or cut into thin shreds. Put about half a pint of Bechamel sauce into a stew-pan and reduce it by boiling until it becomes rather thick, then add the minced veal and a tablespoonful of cream ; season with pepper and salt and a very little nutmeg; stir

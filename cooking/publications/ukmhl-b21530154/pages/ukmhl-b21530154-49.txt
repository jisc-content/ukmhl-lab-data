VEGETABLES FOR GARNISHING 35 White Macedoine of Vegetables Prepare one or two carrots and one or two turnips in fancy shapes of small size; let each sort be separately boiled down to a glaze in a gill of stock, with the addition of a little sugar and salt and a very small piece of butter ; when done, put the whole together in a small saute-pan; to these add a small cucumber cut up and prepared for the purpose in scallops, a dessertspoonful of boiled green peas, a dessertspoonful of French beans cut in the shape of diamonds, a dessertspoonful of asparagus heads boiled green, and also some very small flowerets of boiled cauliflower; add a good gill of Allemande, Bechamel, or Supreme sauce, a little nutmeg and sugar; shake the whole lightly together over the fire, and use this garnish for the entree intended. Garnish of Brown Macedoine Prepare the vegetables for the Macedoine according to the directions given in the preceding recipe; when nearly ready, use some finished Espagnole sauce instead of the other sauces there mentioned. Garnish of Green Peas Boil nearly half a pint of young peas, drain them, and place them in a saute-pan, then add two tablespoonfuls of Bechamel sauce, a pinch of sugar, a teaspoonful of chopped and blanched mint, some nutmeg, half an ounce of butter, and a piece of glaze; shake the whole up well together over the fire, and serve them in the centre of an entree. Garnish of Stewed Peas Put half a pint of young peas into a stew-pan with two ounces of fresh butter; on these pour a pint of cold spring water, and commence kneading the peas and butter together with the hand in the water; as soon as all the butter adheres to the peas, pour the water off, and then add a teaspoonful of sugar, a little salt, an onion, and a bunch of parsley. Set the peas to stew in a little water on a moderate fire; when they are done, set them on a brisk fire to boil quickly in order that they may by this means absorb all their moisture; then add a good tablespoonful of Bechamel sauce, with one ounce of butter, and dish them up in the centre of an entree. Garnish of Asparagus Heads Trim and cut the heads of a large bundle of asparagus, boil them green, and drain them on a napkin ; then place them in a saute-pan with a small tablespoonful of Allemande sauce, a little sugar, nutmeg, and a piece of glaze; toss them gently over the fire, and serve. Garnish of Asparagus Peas Cut a bundle of sprue asparagus into peas, boil them green, and follow the directions contained in the foregoing recipe.

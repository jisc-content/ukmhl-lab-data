THE MODERN COOK 4 mushrooms or some mushroom trimmings; when the sauce is sufficiently reduced take it off the stove, and incorporate with it a liaison of yolks of eggs (in the proportion of four yolks to a pint), a little nutmeg, a dessertspoonful of cream, a pat of butter, and a tea- spoonful of lemon juice ; set the liaison in the sauce by stirring it over the fire until it simmers; it must then be quickly stirred to keep the sauce from boiling, as, in that case, the yolks of eggs would be liable to curdle, which would considerably deteriorate from its quality. When the liaison is set, pass the sauce through a tammy into a basin, or bain-marie, for use. This sauce is in much request as the foundation of many others, especially fish sauces. HOT SAUCES Madeira or Madere Sauce Put one glass of sherry or Madeira into a stew-pan with a tea- spoonful of essence of truffles and a pinch of cayenne ; reduce these to half their original quantity, then add a gill of finished Espagnole sauce; let it boil for five minutes longer, and pass the sauce through a tammy into a bain-marie for use. Turtle Sauce, for Calf’s Head Put one glass of Madeira into a stew-pan with a teaspoonful of red Tomato sauce and a pinch of cayenne ; reduce these to half their quantity, then add a gill of Espagnole or brown sauce, and a dessert- spoon of essence of mushrooms; having stirred this over the fire until it boils, set it by the side to clarify; skim it thoroughly, and reduce it to a proper consistency; pass it through a tammy into a bain-marie ; and, just before using this sauce, mix in two anchovies (that have been pounded with a very small piece of fresh butter, and passed through a tammy) with a teaspoonful of lemon juice. The addition of Turtle Herbs improves this sauce considerably. Salmi Sauce Place the trimmings of the birds of which the salmis is to be made in a stew-pan with a tablespoonful of salad oil, two shalots, one bay-leaf, and a sprig of thyme; leave these on the fire for five minutes; add one glass of any sort of good white wine; reduce this to half its quantity, add a gill of Espagnole and some mushroom trimmings or essence; set the sauce to boil, and then put it by the side of the stove to clarify. Having well skimmed it, pass the sauce through a tammy into a bain-marie, pouring a small portion of the sauce on the members of the birds to keep them moist and to warm them in.

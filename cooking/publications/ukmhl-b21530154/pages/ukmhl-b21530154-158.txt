144 THE MODERN COOK insert the point of any sharp instrument into the spine, at the back of the head, to the depth of an inch, and the eel will become perfectly motionless. Then take a firm hold of the eel with a cloth in the left hand, and with the right hand proceed to detach the skin just below the gills with the point of a small knife; when there is a sufficient quantity of skin loosened, so as to gain a firm grip, hold the head firmly with the left hand, and with a cloth in the right, force the skin to slide off the fish. Then cut off the head, make an incision about two inches in length at the vent, and the same at the neck; draw the inside, trim away the fins, wash and wipe it with a cloth, and then, after sprinkling it with salt, let it lie on a dish for an hour or so previous to dressing it. After having trimmed the eel, lay it on its back in a straight line on the table, and with a knife, open it from one extremity to the other; detach the back-bone, and take it out; then cut the eel into several pieces about one and a half inches long, and season with pepper and salt; dip each piece of eel separately in some beaten egg, and afterwards in some fine bread-crumbs. Place the eel thus prepared on a dish in the larder until within twenty minutes of dinner-time; then proceed to fry it to a golden colour, garnish with fried parsley, and send to table. Either of the following sauces may be served in a sauce-boat with spitchcocked eels: Dutch, Italienne, Venitienne, Poivrade, Piquante, Tartare, Tomato, or Gasconne sauce. Broiled Eels Bone and cut one or more eels into one-and-a-half-inch lengths, put them on a dish, season with pepper and salt, lemon juice, and two tablespoonfuls of oil; twenty minutes before dinner broil them to a light-brown colour, dish them up with fried parsley, and send to table with either of the sauces named in the foregoing recipe, in a sauce-boat separately. Stewed Eels a l’Anglaise Skim and trim one or more eels, and cut into pieces about two inches long, place them in a stew-pan with a sliced carrot, onion, a sprig of parsley, bay-leaf, and thyme, a tablespoonful of mushroom trimmings, a few pepper-corns, four cloves, a blade of mace, and a little salt; moisten with two glasses of port wine, cover with a round of buttered paper, replace the lid on the stew-pan, and set the eels on the fire to stew. When they have boiled gently on the corner of the stove for about twenty minutes, they will be done: then drain and trim them, keeping their liquor to make the sauce; place the pieces of eel in a clean stew-pan, and then proceed to make a sauce for them in the following manner :—Put about an ounce of fresh butter into a stew-pan on the fire, and as soon as it is melted, add a tablespoonful of flour; with a wooden spoon stir them both together over the fire, until the roux, or thickening, becomes slightly coloured; then throw in a chopped shalot, and moisten gradually with the liquor in which the eels have been stewed, adding to it half a pint of good stock. Stir the sauce over the fire till it boils, and then pass it through

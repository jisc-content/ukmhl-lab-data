THE MODERN COOK 84 Cream of Barley a la Princesse Alexandrina To make this soup, white consomme of game should be used to prepare the cream of barley, the puree being finished according to the method observed in former cases; when about to send the soup to table, pour it into a tureen containing scallops of the fillets of one young red-legged partridge, roasted a few minutes and then cooked in the cream. Cream of Barley a la Duchesse Having prepared a steamed custard of fowl, as directed in the preparation for making Deslignac soup (see p. 71), cut the custard thus made (allowing it time to become cold and firm) into small pillars an inch long, then place them carefully in the soup- tureen with half a pint of consomme ; proceed to pour on them three pints of cream of barley prepared and finished in the usual way, and to which has been added a dessertspoonful of lobster butter and a little cayenne pepper. BISQUES AND SHELLFISH SOUPS Bisque of Quails a la Prince Albert Fillet three or four quails, half of which must be made into force- meat quenelle and kept in a cool place until wanted for use; reserve the remainder of the fillets to be lightly simmered in fresh butter, seasoned with a little salt, and eventually cut into scallops. Take the larger bones out of the carcases of the quails, and having roughly chopped the latter, put them into a stew-pan with two ounces of fresh butter, a small bay-leaf, a sprig of thyme, a shalot, a little grated nutmeg, and a pinch of mignonette pepper; set these on a brisk fire, and toss or fry them brown, then add a handful of chopped mushrooms and a glass of Sauterne wine. Allow this to boil quickly for ten minutes, and then add about one and a half ounces of rice, which has been partly boiled in broth, and a quart of veal stock ; after the ingredients have been gently boiling for about an hour, drain them into a sieve, and pound the whole thoroughly in a mortar ; then replace them in the stew-pan, add the broth they were boiled in, stir the puree on the fire to warm it a little, and rub it through the tammy in the usual way. When this is done, place the puree in a well-tinned sauce-pan in a cool place. Just before dinner-time warm the punie of quails, taking care that it does not get too hot; finish seasoning it by mixing in a little crayfish butter, a teaspoonful of partridge glaze, and a little salt if needed; pour the soup into a soup-tureen containing the fillets of quails cut into neatly-trimmed scallops, as well as one dozen very small quenelles made with the fillets kept in reserve for the purpose, and send to table.

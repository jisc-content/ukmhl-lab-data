FISH SOUPS AND WATER SOUCHETS 89 three pints of white consommd. Allow the stock thus prepared to boil gently for three-quarters of an hour3 then strain it off through a sieve into a stew-pan, and thicken it with two ounces of white roux, and as soon as it has boiled, set it by the side of the stove to clarify itself in the usual way. When the body of the soup thus far prepared has been rubbed through a tammy, finish it for table just before dinner-time by mixing in with it a liaison of two yolks of eggs, a gill of cream, a pinch of cayenne pepper, and a little lemon juice3 then pour the soup into the tureen containing the oysters reserved for that purpose with the dozen quenelles of whiting, and serve.

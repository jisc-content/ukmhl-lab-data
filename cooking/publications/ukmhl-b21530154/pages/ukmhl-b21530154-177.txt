REMOVES OF BEEF Braised Roll of Beef a la Flamande Take a piece of sirloin of beef, well covered with fat, weighing about six pounds; bone it, leaving the fillet adhering to the upper part; lard the fillet in a slanting position by inserting with a larding needle some pieces of larding bacon about a quarter of an inch square and three inches long; then roll the beef up close, and fasten it round with a string so as to secure its shape. Break up the bones and place them with the trimmings at the bottom of a braising- pan; then place the roll of beef on the bones, and garnish with a sliced carrot, a sliced onion, a stick of celery, and a bunch of parsley with thyme and a bay leaf, and two blades of mace; moisten with two glasses of sherry, and enough good stock or consommt; to nearly cover the beef; place over all a well-buttered paper, and after having caused it to boil, set the braising-pan to continue gently boiling on a moderate fire for about two and a half to three hours: the time for this must be regulated by the degree of tenderness of the meat. When the beef is done, drain, trim, and put it into a convenient- sized pan containing a little of the liquor in which it has been braised; and with a portion of the remaining part, make a pint of brown sauce for the remove ; boil the rest down, and with this glaze the beef. Place it on a dish, garnish round with alternate groups of trimmed shapes of glazed carrots and turnips, glazed onions, and Brussels sprouts; pour the brown sauce round the dish, and send to table.

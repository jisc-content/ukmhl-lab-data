VEGETABLES FOR GARNISHING 39 the cabbage has been reduced to half its original quantity, moisten with half a pint of stock; allow it to simmer gently on a slow fire for an hour longer; then drain the cabbage in a sieve, afterwards press it in a napkin to extract the butter, etc., and use it for the purpose of garnishing the entree or remove for which it has been prepared. Garnish of Braised Cabbage Lettuces Trim, wash, and blanch two or three full white-heart cabbage lettuces, drain them on a napkin, cut and spread them open, season with pepper and salt, tie them up with a string, and place them in a stew-pan on thin layers of fat bacon ; add a carrot, a bunch of parsley, and an onion stuck with two cloves; cover with a buttered round of paper, and moisten with a gill of white stock. Allow them to boil gently by the side of the fire for half an hour, drain them on a sieve, remove the strings, press them neatly in a napkin, and open each lettuce with a knife; then smooth the inner part, and with the knife turn the ends of the leaves under so as to give to the lettuce a smooth, rounded end; cut off the stalk neatly, and place each lettuce successively in a clean sautd-pan. Next, pass their liquor through a sieve into a stew-pan, remove every particle of grease, and boil it down to the consistency of half-glaze; add it to the lettuces, cover them with a buttered paper, and a quarter of an hour previously to their being required for use set them in the oven to get warm. Sauerkraut Procure one pound of fresh imported sauerkraut, wash it thoroughly- in several waters, and then drain it in a colander. Next, put it into a stew-pan with half a pound of parboiled streaky bacon, half a pound of German sausage, one carrot, one onion stuck with two cloves, and a bunch of herbs; cover with a round of buttered paper, and moisten with a pint of stock. Braise the sauerkraut for about three hours over a slow fire, and, when done, drain it in a colander, remove the bacon and German sausage, throw away the carrot, onion, and faggot; then put the sauerkraut into a stew-pan with a large table- spoonful of Poivrade sauce, toss it over the fire, and use it to garnish the intended dish. French Sauerkraut Split one or two white-heart cabbages into quarters, remove the cores, and shred them up fine; wash them thoroughly in several waters, then drain them in a colander. Next, place the shred cabbages in a large earthen pan, throw in a tablespoonful of salt and a gill of vinegar; toss the cabbage in this, and allow it to steep for three hours; then wash and drain it, and put it in a large stew- pan, season with two ounces of butter, some mignonette pepper, a little salt, and half a gill of French vinegar; place on the top half a pound of streaky bacon and half a pound of German sausage, moisten with a pint of good stock, cover the whole with buttered paper, and then set the sauerkraut to braise very gently over a slow fire for two hours ; and when it is done, proceed in the same manner as directed in the previous recipe.

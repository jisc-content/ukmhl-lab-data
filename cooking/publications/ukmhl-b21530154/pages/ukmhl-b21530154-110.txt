THE MODERN COOK 9s Mulligatawny Soup Cut up a small chicken as for fricassee, place it neatly in a stew-pan, in which previously put a small carrot, a small onion, a stick of celery, parsley, thyme, bay-leaf, cloves, and mace; fill up with three pints of good veal broth, and when the pieces of chicken are nearly done, strain them off into a sieve, saving their broth in a basin. Cool the pieces of chicken in cold water, and then take them up on a clean napkin, trim them neatly, and place them in a basin to be put into the soup afterwards. Then cut one large onion in halves, taking out the head or root part, and again cut these into slices; place in a stew-pan with one ounce of butter, a carrot, and a stick of celery cut small, and fry these over a slow fire until the onion is nearly melted and become of a fine light-brown colour; then add two or three ounces of flour, or sufficient to thicken the quantity of soup you wish to make: stir this on the fire two or three minutes, and after adding a good dessertspoonful of curry powder, and the same quantity of curry paste, proceed gradually to mix in with these, first the broth the chicken was boiled in, and afterwards one quart of consomme of veal or as much as may be found requisite to produce the quantity of soup desired. Place this on the fire, stirring it the whole time, and as soon as it boils, put it by the side of the stove to clarify itself in the usual way; then rub it through the tammy or a fine sieve into a puree, and pour it upon the pieces of chicken. Half an hour before dinner-time place the soup on the fire, stir it till it boils, place it by the side to continue boiling gently for ten minutes, by which time the chicken will be done ; skim the soup, ascertain that the seasoning be correct, and send it to table with a plate of plain boiled Patna rice, to be handed round with the soup. Giblet Soup Take one or two sets of giblets properly cleaned and trimmed; put them into a stew-pan full of boiling water to scald for five minutes; drain them in a colander, immerse them in cold water, and then place them on a napkin to drain. Singe the necks and wings over the flame of a fire, and carefully pick out all the stubble feathers, cut the giblets up into inch-and-a-half lengths, place these in a stew-pan with a stick of celery, two small carrots, two small onions, two small turnips; also four cloves, a blade of mace, and a bunch of parsley, with a sprig or two of basil, winter savory, lemon-thyme, and one or two green onions, a sprig of common thyme, and one bay-leaf. Fill the stew-pan with two quarts of veal stock, and after allowing them to boil gently by the side of the fire till they are done (which will be seen when the pieces of gizzard are become tender), immediately drain them in a large sieve, pouring their broth into a basin. Im- merse the giblets in cold water, then pick them out free from any particles of herbs or vegetables that may adhere to them; place them on a napkin, and when neatly trimmed put them by in a sauce-pan. Next pour the giblet broth into a stew-pan, and having thickened it

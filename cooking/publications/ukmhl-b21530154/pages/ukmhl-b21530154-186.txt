172 THE MODERN COOK sufficiently salted, put it on to boil in home-brewed ale for two to two and a half hours; as soon as it is done, dish it up with carrots, turnips, Spanish onions, and small suet dumplings—the whole of these to be placed in groups round the beef; pour some gravy under it, and send to table. Rounds of beef prepared in the foregoing manner are more frequently sent to table cold—for breakfast and luncheon. Braised Rib of Beef a la Chasseur Procure one small rib of beef, saw off the chine-bone close up to the rib-bones, and with the saw shorten the rib-bones; then lard the lean right through with fillets of fat bacon a quarter of an inch square. Next cure the beef, as described for the preparation of the hunting beef, and when it is ready, wash the brine off in cold water, place the beef in a braising-pan on a drainer, with two carrots, two onions, and a bunch of herbs; moisten with a glass of sherry, and sufficient stock to cover the beef. Set the pan on the fire to continue gently boiling for about two hours; when the beef is done, drain, trim, and glaze it, put it in the oven to dry the surface, and glaze it again; then dish it up, garnish it round with glazed Spanish onions, and carrots —cut in the shape of pears; sauce the beef round with a well-finished Madeira sauce (see p. 4), and send to table. It is usual to dress ribs of beef in this manner to be eaten cold; for this purpose it is necessary to allow them to cool in their own braise, by which means they are materially benefited, as they absorb a considerable proportion of the essence—thereby acquiring both flavour and delicacy. When the ribs of beef are cold, take them out of their braise, trim, glaze, and dish them up; surround them with a border of bright aspic jelly (to be made from the liquor in which the meat has been braised), and send to table. Braised Rib of Beef a la Piemontaise Trim and lard with ham and truffles one small rib of fresh beef; prepare for braising with the trimmings a carrot, an onion, a stick of celery, a few sprigs of parsley, six cloves, two blades of mace, and one clove of garlic; moisten with a glass of sherry and a good pint of stock; set the beef to boil very gently on a slow fire for about two and a half to three hours, taking care to baste it frequently with its own liquor; when the beef is done, drain, trim, glaze, and keep it warm; during this time, strain off the liquor in which the beef has been braised, remove all fat, clarify it, and then add four to six ounces of macaroni, previously boiled in water with a little salt and butter, for about ten minutes. Drain on a sieve, cut into three-inch lengths, and put into a stew-pan with a pinch of mignonette pepper; then stew the macaroni for a quarter of an hour longer, by which time it will be done; add a tablespoonful of Tomato sauce, one and a half ounces of fresh butter, and two and a half ounces of fresh grated Parmesan cheese ; toss the whole well together over the fire, and place the beef on a dish, surround with the macaroni thus prepared,

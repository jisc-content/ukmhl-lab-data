REMOVES OF PORK AND ROAST SUCKING-PIG 195 dressing in the usual way, that is, scalded, drawn, etc., pettitoes cut off, and the paunch filled with stuffing previously prepared for the purpose as follows:—Chop two large parboiled onions and a dozen sage-leaves, boil them in water for two minutes, and after having drained the sage and onion, place it in a stew-pan with a pat of butter, pepper and salt, and set the whole to simmer gently for ten minutes on a very slow fire; then add two or three ounces of bread- crumbs, two pats of butter, and a little beaten egg; stir the whole over the fire for five minutes, and then use the stuffing as before directed. When the sucking-pig is stuffed, sew the paunch up with string, and roast. The pig will require about two hours to roast thoroughly, and should be frequently basted with a paste-brush dipped in salad oil. (Oil is better adapted for this purpose than either dripping or butter, giving more crispness to the skin ; when basted with oil the pig will, while roasting, acquire a more even and a finer colour.) When done, take it up and immediately cut the head off with a sharp knife, and lay it on a plate. Next cut the pig in two by dividing it first with a sharp knife straight down the back to the spine, finishing with a meat-saw; a large dish should be held under the pig while it is thus being divided, into which it may fall when completely cut through; place the two sides back to back on the dish without disturbing the stuffing, split the head in two, put the brains in a small stew-pan, trim off the snout and jaws, leaving only the cheeks and ears; place these one at each end of the dish, surround the remove with a border of small potatoes fried to a golden colour in a little clarified butter; pour under some rich brown gravy, and send to table with the following sauce:—To the brains, put into a small stew-pan as before directed, add a tablespoonful of blanched chopped parsley, pepper and salt, a piece of glaze the size of a large walnut, a pint of well-made butter sauce, and the juice of a lemon : stir the whole well together over the fire, and when quite hot send it to table separately in a boat, to be handed round with the sucking- pig- Roast Sucking-Pig a la Perigord Procure a plump, fresh-killed sucking-pig, and stuff the inside with the following preparation:—Scrub and wash one pound of fresh truffles, peel them and afterwards cut them into pieces resembling small walnuts, but without trimming them much; pound the parings and trimmings in a mortar with about two ounces of butter; put them into a stew-pan with the truffles, and add about four ounces of chopped fat bacon, a bay-leaf, and a few sprigs of thyme and sweet- basil chopped fine, some grated nutmeg, pepper and salt, a small clove of garlic, and four ounces of fat livers of fowls pounded for the purpose. Set the whole over a moderate fire, stirring it the while with a wooden spoon ; when the truffles have simmered on the stove for about ten minutes, take them off and allow them to cool, fill the sucking-pig with the mixture, sew up with string, and roast it as directed in the preceding recipe; when done, dish up in the same manner, taking care to serve with it all the truffles; pour some P^rigueux sauce (see p. 7) under, and send to table.

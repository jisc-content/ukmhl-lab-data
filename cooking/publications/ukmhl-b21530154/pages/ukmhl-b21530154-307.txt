Fillets of Fowl a la Valency Trim four to six fillets of fowl, and lay them flat upon a dish. Prepare three or four ounces of puree of truffles (see p. 30), in which incorporate a yolk of egg, and then spread this over the fillets on both sides; when the coating has become firmly set by cooling, bread-crumb the fillets over twice after they have been dipped once in egg, and the second time in clarified butter.

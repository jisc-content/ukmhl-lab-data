THE MODERN COOK 190 with pepper and salt, and then fill up the entire vacant space occasioned by the extraction of the skull and jaws with a pound of well-seasoned quenelle force-meat made of veal, mixed with some chopped parsley and mushrooms; when the calf’s-head is thus again filled up to its original size by means of the force-meat, it must be secured by sewing up all the apertures with string and a trussing- needle of proper size. When this part of the process is completed, roll the calfs-head up tightly in a well-buttered paper saturated with lemon juice (to keep the head white); then place the calfs-head in a braising-pan with four ounces of chopped suet, carrot, onion, celery, cloves, mace, peppercorns, and a tablespoonful of salt; moisten with a quart of good common white stock, cover with the lid, and set it to boil gently for about two hours. About half an hour before dinner-time take the calf’s-head up on a dish, remove the paper, trim the ears, slit them and turn them down that they may appear frilled; then place the calfs-head, perfectly drained from any moisture, on the centre of the dish, and remove all the twine with which it has been sewn up, and mask it all over, excepting the ears, with a preparation of yolks of eggs, mixed with a pat of melted butter and seasoned with pepper and salt and a little nutmeg; then cover the whole with fine bread-crumbs, fried with a little butter to a golden colour, and place the head in the oven for five minutes that the bread-crumbs may dry on, taking care to cover the ears with wet paper to keep them white and prevent them from cocking up and spoiling their effect. As soon as the bread-crumbs have dried on remove the paper from the ears, sauce round with a ragout composed of the tongue cut into scallops, also the brains, some button-mushrooms, and green gherkins, cut into the shape of olives; allow these to boil up for two or three minutes in a well-made Poivrade sauce; garnish round with some quenelles of veal or chicken, coloured with Ravigote or spinach- green (see p. 74); stick in four silver ornamental skewers, garnished with a crest of red tongue, a large truffle, and a decorated quenelle, and send to table. Calf’s = Head a la Tortue Bone, blanch, and trim half a calfs-head, cut it up into large scallops, keep the ear whole, neatly trim the pieces, and toss them in the juice of a lemon ; put them into a stew-pan with carrot, onion, celery, herbs, cloves, mace, and a few peppercorns; moisten with a glass of Madeira or sherry, and a pint of good stock ; cover with a well-buttered stiff paper, and put on the lid; set the whole to braise on the stove for about two hours. When the pieces of calfs- head are done, drain them on a napkin, and afterwards dish them up in the form of a close wreath round the base of a fried bread croustade; put the ear at one end; next place the tongue, cut down its centre, and spread out on the top of the croustade ; on this put the brains, which must be kept whole and white, and round these, on the croustade, should be stuck three ornamental silver skewers, garnished with a double cock’s-comb, a large mushroom,

?8 THE MODERN COOK Puree of Spinach a la Beauvaux Pick, wash, and boil two pounds of spinach; chop it well and pound it into a soft paste, and then put it into a stew-pan with one ounce of fresh butter, a little grated nutmeg, and salt; stir it on the fire for about ten minutes; then add half a pint of Velout£ sauce and one and a half pints of white consomme of fowl, or any other good white stock at hand; warm the puree on the fire, and rub it through the tammy. Observe that as this puree must not be clarified, it should be kept in the coolest part of the larder until twenty minutes before sending it to table; it must then be made hot by stirring it on the fire, and when just on the point of boiling, mix with it a pat of butter, a small piece of glaze, and a pinch of sugar. Soup a la Faubonne This soup consists of a puree of green peas, made in the usual way, in which must be mixed, previously to serving it up, a gill of young peas boiled green, a small cabbage-lettuce braised and cut into pieces an inch long, and half a cucumber cut up into scallops, and afterwards boiled in consomme. There need not be any crusts sent to table with this soup, nor is it customary to serve crofitons or crusts of any sort for purees that contain a garnish of any kind. Soup a la Ferney Prepare some very small custard shapes (made with consomme); cut a turnip into very small fancy shapes, and fry in a little fresh butter and a pinch of sugar until of a light-brown colour • half a pint of consomme should then be added, and the turnips allowed to finish simmering on a very slow fire, and when done must be set to drain upon a clean napkin, and afterwards put into a soup-tureen with the small custards; to these add one small cucumber cut into scallops and boiled in consomme for the purpose; and, lastly, pour one quart of boiling pur£e of green peas on the above, and serve. The puree in this and similar cases should be kept rather thinner than when intended to be served without a garnish. Soup a la Fabert Take two or three quails, draw, singe, and cut them into quarters, —making two fillets with the pinions left on as for a fricassee, and bone the legs,—leaving only sufficient length of the thigh-bone to give it the shape of a cutlet—rolling the skin round so as to give it a cushion-like appearance. Place these in a stew-pan, the bottom of which has been covered with thin layers of fat bacon ; take care to preserve the shape of the joints, and braise them in a light wine mirepoix (see p. 57). Having thus prepared the quails, when done, drain and trim them, and afterwards place them in the soup-tureen, together with their own stock, which when freed from every particle of fat must then be

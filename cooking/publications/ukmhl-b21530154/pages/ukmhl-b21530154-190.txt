176 THE MODERN COOK of thick and well-seasoned Allemande sauce; as soon as the sauce has become set upon the neck of veal, coat it with egg and bread- crumbs, adding one ounce of grated Parmesan cheese; place it on a buttered baking-tin three-quarters of an hour before dinner, and put it in the oven to bake. When done, dish it up, garnish round with a Toulouse ragout, surround the whole with a border of quenelles decorated with truffles; place a heart sweetbread (decorated with pieces of the tip of a tongue cut into the shape of large hob-nails, and inserted in circular rows in the sweetbreads) at each end of the dish, and send to table. Note.—Necks of veal, either braised or roasted plain, or larded and braised, may, in addition to the foregoing, be sent to table garnished with a Macedoine of vegetables, a Jardiniere, potato croquettes, mushrooms, or tomatoes au gratin (in the last two cases the neck of veal must be sauced with Espagnole, Poivrade, or Brown Italian sauce), a la Milanaise, a la Financiere, etc., etc. Noix or Cushion of Veal a la St. George The noix or cushion is that part of a leg of veal to which the udder adheres. In order to separate it from the round or fillet the leg should be placed on the table, with the knuckle from you, then with the left hand take hold of the upper part of the fillet of veal, and with the right insert the point of a knife into the separation which divides the noix or cushion from the under part of the fillet; cut the noix away, following the separation right through, round to the knuckle, terminating at the left, under the udder, which must be left adhering to the noix. Pare off the sinewy parts from four to five pounds of veal, trim the udder without reducing its size, and then, with a sharp-pointed knife, make a very slight incision in a circular direction on the surface of the noix round the inner edge of the udder; next remove the outer part with a knife, trimming it smooth and neatly; lard the trimmed part closely with fat bacon, in the usual manner, and prepare the noix for braising as follows:—First place at the bottom of a large fricandeau or oval stew-pan, on the drainer, two sliced carrots, a stick of celery, two onions with a clove stuck in each, and a bunch of herbs; cover the whole with thin layers of fat bacon, and then put in the noix of veal; surround it with the trimmings, and moisten with a glass of sherry or Madeira, and a sufficient quantity of good stock, barely to reach the surface of the veal; cover with a well-buttered white paper, and set it to boil on the stove; place the lid on the pan, and put it on a slow fire or in the oven to braise gently for about three hours, remembering to baste the larding frequently with the liquor in order to moisten the veal and glaze it a bright colour; the udder should be covered with thin layers of fat bacon to preserve its whiteness during the braising. When the noix is done, drain and glaze it, remove the layers of bacon, and dish it up; garnish it round with groups of button-mushrooms, cocks’ combs and kernels, and truffles cut in fancy shapes tossed in glaze; surround these with a border of lambs’ sweetbreads, one half of which should be larded, and the

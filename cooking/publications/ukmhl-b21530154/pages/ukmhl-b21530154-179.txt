REMOVES OF BEEF i65 Braised Roll of Beef a la d’Orleans Prepare, braise, and trim the beef as in the foregoing recipe; thoroughly remove the oily matter from the surface of the fat, and cover it all over with the following preparation :— Take two dozen very green pickled gherkins, chop them very finely and put them into a small stew-pan ; stir them over a quick fire till their moisture is entirely absorbed by the heat, then take the stew-pan off the fire, and after allowing the contents to cool, add the yolks of three eggs, pepper, salt, and nutmeg; mix well together, and use as paste, as directed, for the purpose of covering the entire surface of the beef with a coating about a quarter of an inch thick; smooth it over with the blade of a knife dipped in hot water; decorate the centre and ends of the roll of beef with carrots and turnips, French beans and asparagus-heads, cut and prepared for the purpose in fancy designs, by placing, for instance, young carrots and turnips cut in the shape of a crescent alternately side by side so as to form a circle, and in its centre a group of heads of asparagus boiled green, and again round this a border of large marrow-fat peas boiled green; at each end place a row of small carrots and turnips in the shape of small olives, while round the roll of beef thus decorated pour a well-made Poivrade sauce (see p. 8); garnish with a border of potato croquettes fried a golden colour (made in the form of pears with a stalk of parsley stuck in the point to resemble the stalk of a pear), glaze the decoration of vegetables slightly with a paste-brush dipped in some thin glaze so as not to disturb the order of their arrangement, and send to table. Braised Roll of Beef a la Milanaise Bone and trim about six pounds of the prime cut from the centre of a well-covered sirloin of beef; lard the under and upper fillets with ham or larding bacon, season with a little chopped green thyme and winter savory, mignonette, pepper and salt; roll the beef up tight and secure its shape with string, place it with the trimmings and usual accessories recommended in the foregoing recipes in a braising-pan ; moisten with a little red wine and a sufficient quantity of good stock to reach rather more than half-way up the beef; place over a well-buttered paper, cover with the lid of the pan, and set the whole to braise gently for about three hours—taking care frequently to baste the beef with its liquor. When the beef is done, drain, trim, and glaze it—first straining off the braise and removing every particle of grease; then clarify, and afterwards reduce it to the consistency of thin glaze, to which add half a small pot of red-currant jelly, a glass or two of Malaga or fine old Madeira. Dish up the roll of beef, pour this sauce over it, at each end garnish with macaroni dressed with Parmesan cheese, and at the sides of the dish place groups of raviolis (see p. 103) prepared for the purpose, and send to table.

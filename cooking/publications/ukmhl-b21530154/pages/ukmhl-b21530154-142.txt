THE MODERN COOK 128 Cod a Plndienne Trim one and a half pounds of cod in the shape of scallops ; keep them rather thick; place them neatly in a deep saute-pan with one ounce of butter; then moisten them with about half a pint of Indian Curry sauce (see p. 12) prepared for the purpose; cover with a stew- pan lid and set the fillets on a sharp fire to simmer; about twenty minutes will suffice to stew them ; then dish up the fillets—one over- laying the other—in the form of a circle; pass the sauce through a tammy or fine sieve, pour it over them, and send to table. Crimped Cod a la Hollandaise Trim and prepare three or four thin slices of crimped cod about half an inch thick. About an hour or two before dinner, sprinkle the slices of cod with salt; and ten minutes before sending to table, boil them quickly; as soon as done, dish them up, and send them to be eaten immediately with some delicately prepared Dutch sauce (see P- IJ)\ This method of preparing crimped fish is a favourite one in Holland; where, however, plain butter is taken with it, prepared as follows :— Put three or four ounces of butter in a small stew-pan, with a little salt, pepper, nutmeg, and lemon juice; then keep stirring it over a slow fire till the butter is sufficiently melted, taking care that it does not become oily. Crimped Cod a la Colbert Procure three or four very thin slices of crimped cod; egg and bread-crumb and fry themdish them up with some cold Maitre d’Hotel butter (see p. 11) under them; then sauce them round with an essence prepared for the purpose as follows :— Put the trimmings of the fish cut into pieces into a small stew-pan, with a carrot, a sprig or two of parsley, thyme, mace, and pepper- corns ; moisten with a glass of white wine, and allow the whole to boil down to half; add half a pint of good consommd; set the essence to boil gently for half an hour; strain and reduce it down one-third, and use it as directed above. Crimped Cod a la Normande Place three or four thin slices of cod on a silver dish, previously spread with butter; season them with a little pepper and salt, and sprinkle some chopped parsley over them; moisten with a glass of French white wine and a gill of oyster liquor; cover with a buttered paper, and half an hour before dinner put them in the oven to poach, taking care to baste them occasionally. When the fish is done, pour the liquor there may be in the dish into a ragofit prepared for the purpose in the usual manner (see p. 45), and wipe the edges of the dish with a wet napkin; sauce the slices of cod over with the ragout, and garnish round with a border of fried smelts and large crayfish; place some glazed oval crofltons round the inner circle, and send to table.

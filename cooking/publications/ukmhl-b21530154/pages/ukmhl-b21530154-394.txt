3So THE MODERN COOK timbale with rice, cover it in with some of the paste, and bake for about one hour; it must then be again emptied, and all the rice removed. While the timbale is being made, parboil six ounces of macaroni in water for a quarter of an hour, then drain on a sieve, and after- wards put it into a stew-pan with a pat of butter, half a pint of milk, a tablespoonful of cream, one ounce of sugar, a stick of vanilla, and a very little salt; then set the macaroni to boil very gently over a slow fire until it is thoroughly doneâ€”when it will have entirely absorbed the milk, etc.; toss the whole well together over the fire, remove the vanilla, and fill the timbale with the macaroni. Turn it out of the mould on to a dish, shake over some castor sugar, glaze it under a hot salamander, and send to table. Nouilles a la Palerrae Make half a pound of nouilles (see p. 208), parboil them in water with a little salt for about ten minutes, then drain them on a sieve, and afterwards put them in a stew-pan with a pint of stock or water, a pat of butter, a little grated nutmeg, mignonette pepper, and salt; place a circular piece of buttered paper on the top, put the lid on, and then set the nouilles over a slow fire, to boil very gently until the whole of the liquid has been absorbed. Next add a gill of cream, two ounces of grated Parmesan cheese, one ounce of butter, and a small piece of glaze; toss the whole well together over the fire, and then pile up in the centre of a border of croutons; shake some grated Parmesan cheese over the surface, put the dish in the oven to brown lightly, and send to table. Noukles a la Viennoise Put a gill of consomme into a stew-pan with one ounce of butter and a little pepper and salt; set this over the stove, and as soon as it begins to simmer, throw in about two and a half ounces of sifted flour to thicken the preparation into a soft paste, and keep stirring this over the fire for about three minutes, by which time the paste will leave the sides of the stew-pan; add a beaten egg, and one ounce of grated Parmesan cheese, and work the whole thoroughly together until well mixed, then mould it with two teaspoons into small quenelles; when this is done, place them on a buttered sauce- pan lid, and when about to poach them, slip off carefully into some boiling consomme, after gently boiling for about ten minutes, drain, and place them on a silver dish. Pour enough thin bright Espagnole sauce over to reach the surface, sprinkle some grated Parmesan cheese over the top, and set the noukles in the oven to simmer for about twenty minutes; just before sending to table pass a red-hot salamander over to brown the surface, and serve. Timbale of Nouilles h la Vanille Parboil half a pound of nouilles in water for ten minutes, then drain them on a sieve, and afterwards put them in a stew-pan with a pint of milk, a dessertspoonful of pounded vanilla, a pat of butter,

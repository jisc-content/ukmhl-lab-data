jqo THE MODERN COOK wasting its flesh : having thus trimmed the fillets, next put them into a deep dish with pepper and salt, thyme and bay-leaf, a shalot cut into slices, and some sprigs of parsley; add two tablespoonfuls of oil and one of French vinegar, and after the fillets have been steeped for about a couple of hour's, drain them on a napkin, dip them thoroughly in flour, and fry them to a light-brown colour; dish them up in a pyramidal form with some fried parsley, and serve up with the fish a sauce-boat of either of the following sauces: White or Brown Italian, Tomato, Poivrade, Dutch, Ravigote, or Gasconne. Fillets of Whitings a la Marechale Trim the fillets of two or more whitings, as in the previous recipe; cut each in two, trim the pieces neatly, and place them separately on a large dish. Then mask each fillet with a thin coating of reduced Allemande sauce, first seasoning the fillets with pepper and salt; when the sauce has stiffened on them, dip each fillet in some very fine bread-crumbs, afterwards in beaten egg, and then in bread-crumbs again ; smooth and shape the fillets with the blade of a knife, and as each is finished off, place it with care in a frying- basket. Twenty minutes before dinner, set the fillets on a brisk fire to fry in clean hot fat to a golden colour; remove them on to paper in order to absorb the fat; then dish them up in the form of a wreath, and sauce them in the centre with some Dutch sauce—with the addition of an infusion of horse-radish in French vinegar, or some shrimps, oysters, mussels, prawns, crayfish, or merely some chopped and blanched parsley, according to taste or convenience. Fillets of Whitings a la Royale Trim and marinade the fillets of one or more whitings in the manner directed for preparing whitings a l’Orly (see p. 139). About twenty minutes before dinner, drain the fillets on a napkin, and then dip each fillet separately in some frying batter, and throw them one after another into some frying fat heated for the purpose; as soon as they are done, and have acquired a golden colour, take the fillets out of the fat on to paper to absorb any grease they may retain; then dish the fillets up either in a pyramidal form, or else in a circle, and pour some white Ravigote, white Italian, Venetian, or Dutch sauce under and round them, and send to table. Boiled Whitings Trim three or four small whitings and boil them in water with a little salt—about ten to twelve minutes will suffice to cook them ; take the fish out of the water when done, put them on a dish covered with a napkin, and send to table with a boatful of either of the following sauces: Anchovy, Shrimp, Plain Butter, or Dutch. Fried Whitings To prepare whitings for frying, it is necessary first to skin them as follows :— With a cloth in the left hand, take a firm hold of the whiting at

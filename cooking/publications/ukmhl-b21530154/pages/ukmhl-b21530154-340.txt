THE MODERN COOK 326 bread-crumbs fried a light-brown colour; set the pheasants in the oven to keep warm, and when about to send to table, place them in their dish side by side, pour under them a white ragout of cocks’- combs, mushrooms, and truffles, and serve. PARTRIDGES Partridges a la Seville Truss a pair of partridges as for boiling, fry them a light-brown colour in a little fresh butter, and then set them aside upon a plate; cut about a quarter of a pound of raw ham (previously soaked and parboiled) into small pieces in the form of olives, and two dozen small pieces of the red part of a carrot cut with a round scoop, with the same number of small button-onio.ns; fry these also a light- brown colour, withdraw them from the fire, and then put them with the partridges back into the stew-pan ; add a few sprigs of parsley garnished with thyme, bay leaf, sweet basil, and one clove of garlic; season with a little salt and cayenne pepper, moisten with two glasses of Madeira or Malaga, then set the stew-pan (covered with the lid containing live embers) on a slow fire, to simmer gently for three- quarters of an hour. See that the liquor in the stew-pan is reduced to one-half of its original quantity while braising. When done, dish up, skim off the fat from the carrots, etc., add half a pint of finished Espagnole and the juice of half a lemon; boil the whole together for two minutes, place the ham, carrots, and onions in separate groups round the partridges, pass the sauce through a tammy or fine strainer, pour it over the partridges, and serve. Partridges a la Plessy These are to be trussed as for boiling, braised in white stock, and, when done, dished up and garnished with neat groups of small quenelles of partridge and white button-mushrooms; pour round a Supreme sauce, and serve. Partridges a la Cerito Bone two red-legged partridges and stuff them with some quenelle force-meat made with the fillets of two partridges, and with which should be mixed, previous to using it, two black truffles and a small piece of red tongue cut into small dice; when the partridges are filled with this preparation, truss them so as to give them their original shape; scald the red legs and insert them on each side of the birds, at the same time pushing the ends of the skin of the leg neatly in with each foot. Then wrap each bird in a separate paper spread with butter, and fasten the ends with string; braise them for about forty minutes in some white stock over a slow fire, and take particular care that they do not boil fast. When done take them out of the paper, remove the string, drain all the unnecessary moisture from them, and dish them up; garnish with a border of raviolis (see p. 103), pour a Proven§ale sauce over them, and serve.

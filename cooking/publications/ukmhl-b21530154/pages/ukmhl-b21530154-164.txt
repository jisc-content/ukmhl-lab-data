T5° THE MODERN COOK PIKE, PERCH, Etc. Pike or Jack, Stuffed and Baked Scale, draw the gills, and thoroughly wash and wipe a pike; fill the paunch with well-seasoned veal-stuffing; sew it up with a trussing-needle and fine string, and either turn the tail round into the mouth, securing them together by means of string, or truss the pike into the shape of the letter S; make several deep incisions in a slanting direction on both sides of the fish, and place it in a baking- dish; season with pepper and salt, a little chopped parsley and mushrooms, and a chopped shalot, and from one to two ounces of fresh butter; moisten with a glass of sherry and a little good stock; cover with a well-buttered paper, and put the pike thus prepared in the oven to bake—taking care to frequently baste it with its liquor. When done, dish it up; add a little of the liquor to a pint of good brown sauce, reduce the whole to a proper consistency, and mix in an ounce of fresh butter, a little essence of anchovies, lemon juice, and a pinch of cayenne ; with this sauce mask the pike and send to ta^6' Pike a la Chambord The dish is prepared in a similar manner to carp a la Chambord (see p.147). This is also the case with pike k la Cardinal, ditto a la Royale, and ditto fried if l’Allemande ; in fact, pike may be dressed in all respects the same as carp. Fried Pike a la Hollandaise When the pike is cleaned, cut it into slices an inch thick, and place them in a deep dish; season with pepper and salt, a gill of oil, lemon juice, chopped parsley, and a little grated nutmeg; turn the slices of pike over in the seasoning occasionally in order that they may be well saturated with it, and, half an hour before dinner-time, drain them, dip each separately in flour, and immediately fry them in hot fat; dish them on a napkin, place round them a border of fried parsley, and send to table with a boat of well-seasoned Dutch sauce (see p. ix). Crimped Pike a la Hollandaise To produce this dish in perfection, the following instructions must be closely attended to in every particular:— Scale 1 and clean the pike immediately on its being taken from the water; cut the fish into slices nearly an inch thick, and put them into a panful of water which, from its coldness, has the power of crimping the comparatively live fish thrown into it. About twenty minutes before dinner, boil the slices in hot water with a little salt; as soon as they are done, drain and dish them up on a napkin, and send to table with either of the following in a sauce-boat: Parsley and Butter, Dutch, Maitre d’Hotel, or Crayfish sauce.' 1 The easiest way is to place the pike in a sink, and then to pour some boiling water over it, by which means the scales are effectually removed by scraping them off with a knife.

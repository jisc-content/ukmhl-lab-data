i94 THE MODERN COOK Roast Leg of Pork k l’Anglaise Procure a small leg of fresh dairy-fed pork; make a large incision just below the knuckle, between the skin and meat, for the purpose of introducing the stuffing of sage and onion, which must be secured by sewing it up with string; then with a sharp-pointed knife score it all over in the following manner:—With the left hand hold the pork firmly, and with a very sharp knife score the skin across in parallel lines a quarter of an inch apart; then roast it for about two hours; when done, dish it up, pour a rich brown gravy under it, and send to table with apple sauce. The stuffing for the pork should be thus prepared :—Chop a dozen sage leaves and two large parboiled onions, boil these in water for three minutes, and after having drained them on a sieve, put them into a stew-pan with pepper and salt, and a pat of butter; set the stuffing to simmer gently over a very slow fire for ten minutes, and then use it as directed above. Roast Loin of Pork Trim, score, and separate the bones of a small loin of pork with a chopper or meat-saw; make an incision in the upper part of the loin for placing the stuffing, and sew it up with string. About an hour and a quarter before dinner-time roast the pork, and, when done, dish it up; pour some brown gravy under it, garnish it round with a border of small potatoes fried to a light colour, and send to table with apple sauce. Roast Neck of Pork Saw the chine-bone neatly off, stuff the neck of pork with sage and onion, roast, and dish it up as directed for the loin, and serve. Roast Griskin of Pork The piece called griskin is that part of the pig which is cut from the side of a bacon-hog, being the lean from the neck and loin : this should be lightly sprinkled with salt the day before dressing it for table. About an hour and a quarter before dinner put it to roast, and when the griskin has been cooking an hour, shake some flour over it with a dredger, and afterwards sprinkle some chopped sage and onions upon it. When the pork is done, dish it up, pour some brown gravy under it, and send to table with a sauce-boat containing sage and onion sauce, the latter to be prepared as follows:—Chop a dozen sage leaves and two parboiled onions, and after having boiled them two minutes in water, drain, and put them in a stew-pan with a pat of butter, pepper and salt; set these to simmer on a very slow fire for ten minutes, and then add half a pint of good brown gravy, boil the whole together for five minutes, and serve.

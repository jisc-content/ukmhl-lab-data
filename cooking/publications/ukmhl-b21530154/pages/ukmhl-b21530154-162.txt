148 THE MODERN COOK form thereon a decoration resembling scales, but larger; cover the whole with thin layers of fat bacon, moisten with a white wine mirepoix, and set it to braise gently on a moderate fire, carefully preventing it from boiling fast, as that would tend to displace the fillets, etc., with which the carp has been decorated. If the fish is of large size, it will require about three-quarters of an hour to braise it; when done, drain it from its liquor, remove the layers of fat bacon, etc., and place it on a large silver dish; garnish round the extremity of the inner edge of the dish with alternate groups of small quenelles of whitings, button-mushrooms, white mussels, and crayfish tails; sauce round the carp, without covering any part of it, with some Allemande incorporated with part of the liquor in which the fish has been braised, a pat of anchovy butter, and some lemon juice ; glaze the head of the carp, and send to table. Carp a la Royale Prepare a carp, wipe it with a clean cloth, and lay it on a buttered paper; place it upon the drainer of an oval fish-kettle, and cover it entirely with quenelle force-meat of whitings coloured with lobster coral; smooth the surface of the force-meat with the blade of a knife dipped in hot water; place some fillets of soles contises with green gherkins crosswise upon the carp, leaving the space of an inch between each filletâ€”these spaces are to be filled up by inserting in the force-meat some pieces of truffle cut in the shape of small olives; braise the carp, as in the former case, in a white wine mirepoix; when done, place it on a large oval dish, sauce it round with a Genoise sauce (see p. 9), and garnish it with a border of large quenelles of soles, half of which must be coloured with lobster coral and the remainder with chopped and blanched parsley; within the inner circle of the quenelles place alternate groups of prepared oysters and the tails of prawns, and send to table. Carp a la Bourguig-note Prepare and stew a carp whole in a little red wine; when done, drain and place it on an oval dish, sauce it with a rich Bourguignote sauce (see p. 8), garnish with soft roes and crayfish, and send to table. Carp a la Perigueux Prepare and stew a carp in a little wine, drain it, and dish it up; sauce it with Perigueux sauce incorporated with a pat of anchovy butter and some lemon juice; garnish with a border of lobster quenelles, and serve. Carp a la Proven^ale Prepare and stew a carp in a mirepoix of white wine; when done, drain and dish it up; pour some Proven^ale sauce over it, garnish with groups of mussels fried in batter and scallops of perch tossed in green Ravigote sauce, and send to table.

290 THE MODERN COOK management, much of the cost may be reduced by subsequently using the remains of the fowls here required in the preparation of a variety of other dishes, such as those comprised in the last section of entrees of poultry, and also for making galantines, ballotines, cutlets, croquettes, pies, etc. Supreme of Fillets of Fowls a l’Ecarlate Take out the fillets of two spring chickens in the following manner:—First slit the skin on the centre of the breast in a straight line, so that, by folding it down on both sides, the fillets will be left bare. Next draw the point of a knife along the edge of the breast- bone, cut through the centre of the merry-thought, and then remove the fillets by dividing them from the breast and ribs, carefully running the point of a knife close to the bones, while the fillet is held up with the fingers of the left hand so as to prevent the knife from injuring it. The fillets being thus removed entire, divide the small fillets from the large ones, and after the sinew which runs along these has been carefully extracted without tearing them, they should be trimmed and placed in a saute or stew-pan with some clarified butter, covered with a round piece of paper, and placed in the larder. The larger fillets must also be trimmed in the following manner:—Place the fillet upon the edge of the table, with the pointed end to the right and the smooth side downwards ; then bear moderately with the fingers of the left hand upon the pointed end of the fillet, and at the same time slip the edge of a sharp knife (dipped in water) into that part, and slide the knife under the hand, closely bearing towards the skin so as not to waste any more of the fillet than is positively necessary for the pur- pose of removing it; it must then be trimmed neatly round at the thick end, and nearly to a point at the thin end. The large fillets should now be arranged, all in the same direction, in a stew-pan with some clarified butter; then seasoned with a little salt, covered with a circular piece of buttered paper, and placed with the others. Care should be taken that if the large fillets incline from right to left when placed in the stew-pan, the small fillets should be curved in the opposite direction. When about to send to table, place the stew-pan containing the large fillets over the fire, and as soon as they become set and whitened on one side, turn them over immediately on the other, so that they do not brown; then quickly pour off all the fat, add a gill of Supreme sauce (see p. 10), and having tossed the fillets in it over the fire without allowing them to boil or simmer, dish in a close circle with a round scallop of red tongue (previously warmed in a little half-glaze for the purpose) between each of them; fill the centre with button-mushrooms tossed in a little of the sauce, place the smaller fillets, in a similar row to the others, upon the top of them; pour some Supreme sauce round the entree, and serve. Supreme of Fowl a la Toulouse Prepare the large fillets as before, and when the smaller ones have been trimmed, lard them closely and place them in a saut^-pan upon thin layers of fat bacon, in a curved form.

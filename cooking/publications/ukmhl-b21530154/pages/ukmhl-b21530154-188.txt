174 THE MODERN COOK REMOVES OF VEAL Roast Fillet of Veal a lâ€™Anglaise Veal, to be in perfection, should, if possible, be procured fresh killed, as it does not improve either in flavour or colour by being kept. Take out the bone from four to five pounds of good fat fillet of veal, and fill it with about half a pound of well-seasoned stuffing (see p. 468); sew it up with thin twine, and secure its shape with skewers and twine ; cover it well with buttered thick white paper, roast it about one hour and a half in front of the fire or in the oven ; just before it is done, take off the paper, and, after first shaking some flour over it from a dredger, baste the veal with a little fresh butter, and froth it; then dish it up, pour round it some fight-brown sauce incorporated with one and a half ounces of fresh butter, a tablespoonful of essence of mushrooms, and a little lemon juice; garnish round with potato croquettes, and send to table. Roast Fillet of Veal a la Macedoine Roast four to five pounds of a fillet of veal according to the foregoing directions, glaze and dish it up, garnish it round with a Macedoine of such vegetables as the season of the year may afford; sauce round with Supreme or Bechamel, and send to table. Roast Fillet of Veal a la Jardiniere Prepare three or four pounds of the fillet of veal as before described, dish it up, and garnish it round with groups of carrots and turnips cut into fancy shapes, small heads of cauliflower, French beans cut into diamonds, green peas, and asparagus-heads; sauce with half- glaze, or a well-finished Espagnole sauce, and send to table.

As in course of roasting the sauce dries on the veal, keep adding a fresh coating, until a light-coloured delicate crust is produced all over the meat; then take it up with great care, in order that the crust may not be disturbed; dish it up, pour a good cream Bdchamel sauce (see p. 3) under it, garnish it round with groups of French beans cut in diamonds, and buds of cauliflower, and send to table. Braised Neck of Veal & la Montmorency Trim three to four pounds of neck of veal, according to the directions given in the preceding recipe; then with a thin, long- bladed knife pare off the skin and sinew which cover the fillet part of the neck, leaving the ribs well covered; lard the part which has

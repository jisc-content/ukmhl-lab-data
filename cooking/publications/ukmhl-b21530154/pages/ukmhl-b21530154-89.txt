I VEGETABLE PUREE SOUPS 75 half a pint of broth; having allowed them to simmer gently on the fire until done, pass them in the usual way through a tammy or sieve, and mix the purtie thus obtained with the soup; and when it has cleared itself by boiling, season to taste, and send to table with Conde crusts separately. Puree of Lentils a la Brunoise This soup is recommended to be served when there happens to be in the larder any remaining stock of pur£e of lentils, or Brunoise soup, which can be mixed for this purpose. The Conde crusts should be omitted. Green-Peas Soup Take one and a half pints of green peas, a small bunch of parsley, a sprig or two of green mint, and two or three onions. Having put three and a half pints of common stock on the fire, throw in the above ingredients as soon as it begins to boil; when the peas are thoroughly done, drain them and the other vegetables in a colander, then pound them well together ; the pur£e thus far prepared should be put into a stew-pan together with its own liquor, warm it until it becomes sufficiently dissolved, and then rub it through a tammy-cloth or sieve in the usual manner. Just before sending to table, heat up the soup on a brisk fire, adding one ounce of fresh butter and a small teaspoonful of sugar. Serve Cond£ crusts on a plate.1 Puree of Roots a la Croissy Cut into thin shavings two or three large carrots, and slice very small the same number of turnips, one onion, and one stick of celery ; add a handful of sorrel, and a little chervil and tarragon ; put these into a stew-pan with one and a half ounces of fresh butter on a slow fire, and let it remain there until the vegetables are steamed sufficiently to reduce their quantity to one-half; then add one quart of stock, and put the pan on the fire to boil; skim it, and remove it to the side to boil gently for about an hour and a half; after which proceed to drain the roots from the stock in a colander, pound them in a mortar, and having mixed them with the liquor, warm the puree thus obtained, and rub it through the tammy-cloth or a fine sieve in the usual way. Then put the puree into a sauce-pan (with more stock if needed), and allow it to boil on the fire; after this, place it by the side to clarify itself by gentle boiling; and when it ceases to throw up any scum, finish the soup by adding one ounce of fresh butter and a pinch of sugar, and send to table. Pur^e of Carrots a la Crecy Shave off the red part of about eight or ten large carrots, add one small stick of celery and one onion ; blanch these in boiling water on the fire for ten minutes; drain them in a colander, and afterwards 1 In order to avoid unnecessary repetition, it should be observed that Condd crusts must be served with the succeeding purges of vegetables, except when other- wise directed.

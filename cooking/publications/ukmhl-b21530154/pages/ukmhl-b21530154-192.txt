178 THE MODERN COOK flap part for that purpose, wrap the flap or skirt-piece round tight, so as to secure the kidney-fat; fasten it with skewers and string, cover it with two sheets of buttered paper, to be tied on with string, and roast the loin of veal either in the oven or in front of the fire for one and a half hours; when nearly done, take off the paper, shake some flour over it with a dredger, and afterwards froth it over with two ounces of fresh butter; as soon as the veal has acquired a fine light colour, and the butter and flour have frothed up, dish it up; pour some brown melted butter under it, and send to table. Roast Loin of Veal a la Montglas Roast about five pounds of a loin of veal, according to the fore- going directions; next, with a sharp knife make an incision two inches deep along the sides and ends of the loin, and endeavour to cut out the square piece without tearing the meat, the joint re- sembling an oblong case. The fillet thus taken out should be cut into thin round scallops and put into a stew-pan with an equal quantity of scallops of tongue and mushrooms; to these add a large tablespoonful of good Bechamel sauce, and with this mixture fill the loin of veal, previously put on a buttered baking - sheet; smooth the top over with the blade of a knife, and cover the whole with very fine bread-crumbs fried with butter to a light colour, and mixed with one and a half ounces of Parmesan cheese; sprinkle a little melted fresh butter over it, and set it in the oven to get hot, salamander it over and dish it up; garnish with a white Toulouse ragout (see p. 43), and place round a border of croquettes of veal, or sweetbread; at each corner of the loin stick an ornamental silver skewer garnished with a large cock’s-comb, mushroom, decorated quenelle, and truffle; glaze the sides of the loin of veal, and send to table. Loin of Veal a la Dauphine Procure five to six pounds of loin of veal, cut square, with the whole of the flap or skirt left on ; bone it entirely, taking care, at the same time, to remove every portion of sinew; lard the lean part of the fillet with small fillets of tongue, or ham; the veal must then be laid square on the table, and with about half a pound of quenelle force-meat of chickens (mixed with chopped parsley and mushrooms), spread the whole of the inner part, about an inch thick; the kidney and fat should then be replaced in the centre, the loin rolled up tight, and its pillow-like shape be secured with small iron skewers, and fastened with string. Then put it in a large oval braising-pan on the drainer; garnish with the trimmings, a couple of carrots, onions, a stick of celery, and a bunch of herbs, two blades of mace, and four cloves; moisten with a quart of good consomme, cover with an oval of double paper well buttered, put the lid on, and then set the pan to boil on the fire ; after which put it to braise in the oven, or on a slow fire ; baste the veal frequently with its own liquor, and when it is done, drain, trim, and mask it all over with a coating of the following mixture:—To one or two yolks of eggs, add one ounce of fresh butter melted, and two tablespoonfuls of Bechamel

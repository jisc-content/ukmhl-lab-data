THE MODERN COOK 164 Braised Roll of Beef a l’Allemande Braise the beef in the usual manner, garnish it round with stewed sauerkraut (see p. 39), round which place a border of potatoes cut in the shape of large olives, and fried a golden colour in butter; sauce round with Poivrade or brown sauce, and send to table. Braised Roll of Beef a la Royale Prepare and braise the roll of beef as directed for dressing the beef a la Flamande; after trimming and glazing the roll, place it on a dish, and sauce it round with a rich Financiere ragout (see p. 44), garnish round with a border of larded lambs’ sweetbreads and whole truffles placed alternately round the dish, and ornament the roll of beef by inserting four silver hatelets or skewers garnished as follows .-—First run the point of the skewer through a large double cock’s-comb, then a large mushroom, a fine truffle, and, lastly, a fine crayfish; use them as directed to ornament the roll of beef, and send to table. Braised Roll of Beef a la Windsor Braise the roll of beef perfectly tender, trim, glaze, and place it on a dish; garnish round with alternate groups of stewed peas and potatoes—cut in the shape of large olives and fried to a golden colour in butter. Clarify and reduce the braise in which the beef has been done, and with it sauce the beef round, reserving part to be sent to table in a sauce-boat. Braised Roll of Beef a la Claremont Procure about three or four pounds of sirloin of beef, cut square from the centre; bone and trim it, and then proceed to lard the fillet and upper part of the beef with pieces of tongue and the fillets of a pheasant, cut into lengths of about three inches and a quarter of an inch square in thickness ; roll the beef and tie with string, place it in a braising-pan with the bones broken small, and the trimmings, one carrot, one onion, celery, a bunch of parsley, four cloves, and two blades of mace; moisten with a glass or two of sherry and sufficient broth from the stock-pot to nearly cover the beef, place a well- buttered paper on it, cover the pan with its lid, and set the beef to boil gently on a slow fire for about two and a half hours—taking care that, when the liquor has become somewhat reduced in quantity by boiling, the beef should be frequently moistened on the exposed surface by being basted with the braise. When the beef is done, drain, trim, glaze, and place it on its dish; pour round it a ragout it la Claremont, consisting of a pint of brown sauce mixed with one- fourth part of brown puffie of onions and some thin scallops of truffles, mushrooms, and red tongue, the whole to be cut out with a round cutter about the size of a half-crown piece; at each corner insert a silver skewer garnished with a large cock’s-comb, a decorated quenelle, and a thick scallop of red tongue; place a border of decorated quenelles and large crayfish round the end of the dish, and send to table.

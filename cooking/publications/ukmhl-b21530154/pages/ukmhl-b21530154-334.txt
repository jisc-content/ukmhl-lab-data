PHEASANTS Salmi of Pheasant a la Bourguignote Roast a plump pheasant, let it become cold, and then cut it up as follows :—First remove the legs, then cut off the fillets with the pinion-bones adhering, separate the breast from the back, trim both, cut them crosswise into halves, and place all the pieces in a stew-pan. Next chop up the trimmings and put them into a stew-pan with three shalots sliced up, a small bay leaf and sprig of thyme, a few peppercorns, a blade of mace, and a pat of butter; fry these over the fire until slightly browned, moisten with a glass of claret or Burgundy, and boil until reduced to half the quantity; then add half a pint of white consomme, and after the fumet has simmered by the side of the stove for a quarter of an hour, pass it through a sieve into a stew-pan containing three-quarters of a pint of Espagnole sauce, and work it in the usual manner (by clarifying and reducing it), then pass through a tammy into a basin. Pour one- third of the sauce over the pheasant, and put the remainder into a bain-marie containing a few button-mushrooms, small truffles, and glazed button-onions.

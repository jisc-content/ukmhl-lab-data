THE MODERN COOK 104 out with the rolling-pin until it becomes nearly as thin as a sheet of paper. Place the paste thus rolled out lengthwise on the slab, then with the paste-brush dipped in water moisten its whole surface, and lay on it, about two inches apart from each other, some small round balls of raviolis farce of the size of a cob-nut, in rows. This farce is prepared as follows:—Put four ounces of a boiled or roasted fowl, pheasant, or partridge into a mortar, pound the meat thoroughly, and add to this about one ounce of fresh-made curd, one table- spoonful of grated Parmesan cheese, one tablespoonful of blanched spinach, pepper, salt, and nutmeg; moisten with one or two yolks of raw eggs, and mix the whole well together into a smooth compact body ready for use. Wrap the outer part of the paste, when the raviolis farce has been laid on it, over the outer row of balls, cover them as if for making puffs, finish them by fastening down the paste with the thumb, and then cut them out with a small, round, fluted cutter into half-moons : and as they are cut out place them on a large dish, there to be left for some time, in order to dry the surface, so that it may more resemble Italian paste. Having repeated this operation until you have made two dozen raviolis, and after they have been dried in the larder, proceed to blanch them ; this is done by throwing them into a large stew-pan containing some boiling stock or water, and allowing them to continue boiling therein for a quarter of an hour ; then drain the raviolis on to a napkin. Next take the lining of a soup-tureen, butter it, place therein a layer of raviolis and a layer of grated fresh Parmesan cheese, and so on alternately until the silver tureen lining be filled; shake some grated cheese on the top, and moisten with a glass of old Madeira and half a pint of the gravy made for the purpose, and then put the lining into the oven or over a slow fire, there to reduce the gravy and to gratinate. Brown the top with a heated salamander, and send to table with the remainder of the clear consomme in the soup- tureen. This soup should be thus served: With a gravy spoon help a portion of the gratinated raviolis in a soup-plate, and add to these a ladleful of the consommd. Rice Soup a la Florentine Prepare a thin puree of rice and moisten it with one pint of consomme of fowl; finish by adding one ounce of grated Parmesan cheese, a liaison of two yolks of eggs, a gill of cream, a pat of butter, and a little mignonette pepper ; then pour the soup thus prepared into the soup-tureen, and send to table with a plate of very small croquettes of rice, which are to be handed round with the soup. Rice Croquettes for Soup The croquettes of rice here alluded to are thus made :— Wash and blanch four ounces of Carolina rice, and boil it in a little stock with one ounce of fresh butter, a pinch of mignonette pepper, and a little salt j when done, add half an ounce of grated Parmesan

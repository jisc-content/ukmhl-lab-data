THE MODERN COOK io8 Russian Tschi or Cabbage Soup First, cut two onions into small dice, and fry them with one and a half ounces of butter in a stew-pan over a slow fire, and when they assume a light yellow-brown colour, add to these a small white-heart cabbage which has been previously shred fine for the purpose, and, after having continued to fry this also with the onions for about ten minutes, one tablespoonful of flour should be added; stir the whole well together, moistening with two quarts of good consomme, season with a little nutmeg and mignonette pepper, and after the soup has boiled gently by the side of the stove for about an hour in order to clarify it, let it be well skimmed ; and previous to sending the soup to table add a pluche of tarragon leaves and a few drops of lemon juice. Previous to pouring the tschi into the soup-tureen place therein about eighteen small sausages made in the following manner, viz.:—To two ounces of lean fillet of beef add an equal quantity of beef suet; first chop, and then pound these well together in a mortar, season with grated nutmeg, pepper, and salt, and one tea- spoonful of chopped parsley ; add one yolk of egg, mix well together by pounding the whole ten minutes longer, after which proceed to roll the sausage meat into small round or oval shapes the size of a cob-nut; and, after frying these to a light colour in a little clarified butter, use them as directed above. Olla Podrida or Spanish Soup Place some slices of raw ham at the bottom of the stock-pot, add one pound of gravy beef cut in slices, and a roasted old hen; garnish with the usual vegetables, two cloves, and mace; moisten with a quart of stock, set the stock-pot on the fire, and let the broth be reduced to a glaze ; fill it up with two quarts of water as soon as it boils, skim it, and then set the stock to boil gently by the side of the stove. When the consomme has boiled two hours throw in a partridge trussed for boiling, a quarter of a pound of pork sausages, and half a Spanish saveloy ; watch the braising of these to prevent their being overdone ; take them out when they are sufficiently braised, place them upon a dish to get cool, then divide the partridge into small joints, trimming them neatly, and cut the sausages and saveloys also into small round balls, and place all these in a sauce-pan, together with a carrot and a turnip cut into the form of rather large-sized olives, and some celery and a stick of leek previously boiled in consomme with a small lump of sugar; to these must also be added a tablespoonful of boiled yellow Spanish peas (garbangas). After four hours’ boiling strain the stock off, clarify it, and strain it again through a napkin ; add it to the above-named ingredients with a pinch of mignonette pepper ; boil the whole for ten minutes, and send to table. Turkish Pilaff or Pilau Place a pound of knuckle of veal with some slices of raw ham in a stock-pot, also two pounds of roasted shoulder of lamb and a small

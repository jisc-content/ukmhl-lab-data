MEAT PIES 2x3 Beefsteak and Oyster Pie Cut a pound of fillet of beef or rump-steak into thin slices, fry them quickly over a very brisk fire so as to brown them before they are half done; then place them on the bottom of the dish, leaving the centre open, in two successive layers; fill the centre with two dozen oysters previously parboiled and bearded, season with pepper and salt, and pour the following preparation over the whole :—When the slices of beef have been fried in a frying-pan, pour nearly all the fat out, and shake a teaspoonful of flour into it; stir this over the fire for one minute, then add a gill of good gravy or stock, one dessert- spoonful of mushroom catsup, an equal quantity of Harvey sauce, and the liquor from the oysters; stir the whole over the fire, and keep it boiling for a quarter of an hour. Half an hour after this sauce has been poured into the pie, cover it with puff-paste in the usual way, bake it for an hour and a half, and serve. Veal and Ham Pie Cut one and a half pounds of veal and half a pound of ham into thin slices, and season with a little pepper and salt. Next chop two or three mushrooms and a few sprigs of parsley, and put them in a small stew-pan with a small pat of butter and one shalot chopped fine; fry these lightly over the fire, then add a gill of Veloute sauce or good stock; boil the whole for five minutes and pour it into the pie; add two to three hard-boiled eggs cut in slices, cover with puff- paste, bake the pie for an hour and a half, and serve.

Woodcock or Snipe Pie a l’lrlandaise Pick three or four birds clean, cut off the legs and wings, singe them, and then cut each woodcock or snipe into halves; remove the gizzards, leaving the trail, and set them aside on a plate. Then cover the sides and bottom of a white glazed earthenware oval pan (used for preserving game) with very thin layers of fat bacon, place the woodcocks or snipes in the pan in close layers, each well seasoned with ground black pepper and salt, and a good pinch of prepared aromatic spices (see p. 391). When this is done, fill up the pan with a sufficient quantity of clarified fresh butter to cover the birds, place some layers of fat bacon on the top, cover the pan hermetically with a firm flour and water paste ; bake this pie in a moderately

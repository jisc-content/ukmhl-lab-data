325 PHEASANTS Pheasants with Rice a 1’EspagnoIe These must be trussed as for boiling, and then placed in an oval stew-pan with carrot, celery, two onions stuck with three cloves each, a bouquet garni, and a couple of red Spanish sausages ; moisten with some red wine-mirepoix, cover them over, and set them to stew very gently for about two hours on a slow fire. While the pheasants are stewing, prepare some rice in the follow- ing manner:— Thoroughly wash six ounces of Carolina rice, and afterwards boil it for three minutes in water, and drain it on a sieve until all the moisture is absorbed; then put a gill of salad oil into a large frying-pan over a brisk fire, and as soon as the oil is quite hot, throw the rice in and fry it until it becomes slightly browned, stirring it with a spoon the whole of the time it remains on the fire. Then put the rice into a stew-pan, moisten it with a pint of good consomme, season with a little cayenne pepper and a pinch of saffron powder; set it to simmer very gently on the fire for half an hour, and when the pheasants are dished up, work the rice with a teaspoonful of Tomato sauce and a little glaze, then mould it in the shape of ordinary quenelles with a tablespoon, and place these closely round the pheasants after they are dished up ; sauce over with Poivrade sauce in which part of the braising liquor has been mixed after being first boiled down to glaze, and serve.

When the pheasants are thus far prepared, place them in an oval stew-pan with a carrot, an onion stuck with three cloves, and a bouquet garni; moisten with good white stock in sufficient quantity to cover them, and then set them to braise very gently on a slow fire for an hour and a half. When the pheasants are done, take them up, remove the paper and string, drain all the moisture from them, and dish them up; pour under some bright essence of game, made from the carcases of the pheasants, clarified, and reduced to half-glaze. Pheasants a la Montglas Roast one or more pheasants, and as soon as they are cooked cut the meat from the breasts by making an incision in the shape of a heart; this meat must then be cut into very small dice and mixed with two tablespoonfuls of reduced Bechamel sauce or Allemande, three or four mushrooms, a couple of black truffles, and a small piece of red tongue should be also cut into dice and mixed with the pheasant. With this preparation fill up the breasts of the pheasants, smooth over with the blade of a knife, and then cover them with

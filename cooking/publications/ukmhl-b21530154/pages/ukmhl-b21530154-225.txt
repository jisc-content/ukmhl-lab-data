MEAT PIES 21 r two blades of mace, and a teaspoonful of peppercorns, two bay leaves, a large sprig of thyme, and half a pint of French vinegar; set these to boil on the fire until reduced to half the quantity, then add a gill of rich gravy, a tablespoonful of currant jelly, and the juice of a Seville orange; allow the whole to boil together for five minutes, and then strain the sauce into a small stew-pan, and make it hot for use. Cygnet a la Norwich Procure a Norwich-fed cygnet (these birds are in best condition in September), stuff it with the following preparation :— A pound of rump steak chopped fine, seasoned with three shalots, grated nutmeg, pepper and salt. Truss the cygnet in the usual manner, then envelop it with well-buttered paper, and encase it with flour and water paste in a similar way to that used for haunches of venison ; after which let the whole be again secured with stout paper well greased and fastened on with string. About two and a half to three hours will suffice to roast the cygnet, during which it should be frequently basted. When done, remove the coating, froth it with flour and butter in the usual manner, and dish it up with a rich brown gravy under it; and send a sauce-boatful of Port Wine sauce to be handed round. MEAT PIES Chicken Pie k la Reine Cut a small chicken into small pieces as for a fricassde, cover the bottom of the pie-dish with slices of veal and ham placed alternately; season with chopped mushroom and parsley, pepper and salt, then add a little white sauce; next place in the dish the pieces of chicken in neat order, repeat the seasoning and the sauce, lay a few thin slices of dressed ham neatly trimmed on the top; cover the pie with puff-paste, ornament this with pieces of the same cut into the form of leaves, etc., egg the pie over with a paste-brush, and bake it for one hour and a half. A very good chicken pie may be made by omitting the mushrooms, ham, and the sauce-—substituting for these the yolks of eggs boiled hard, chopped parsley, bacon, and a little mushroom catsup, some common gravy, or even water. Pigeon Pie a l’Anglaise Draw, truss, and singe three or four young pigeons; stuff them with the chopped livers, mixed with some parsley, a small piece of butter, pepper and salt. Cover the bottom of the dish with slices of beef, taken either from the fillet or rump; season with chopped parsley and mushrooms, pepper and salt; over these place the pigeons and the slices of one or two hard boiled eggs; add some white or brown sauce, in sufficient quantity to produce sauce enough for the dish, or substitute some gravy or common stock; repeat the seasoning, cover the pie with puff-paste, bake it for an hour and a half, and send to table.

THE MODERN COOK VI The excessive meat eating- was gradually being supplanted by dishes of a more vegetarian nature, and the elaborate dining habits of the nation were being replaced by earlier hours and simpler courses. This beneficial alteration has happily continued, so that now, in the twentieth century, much that Francatelli wrote about in 1845 is no longer needed. His work, however, was laid upon enduring foundations which will remain to posterity. Francatelli was a good culinary architect, and though in the present revised edition efforts have been made, in accordance with modern require- ments, to introduce greater economy in the use of the various ingredients, and additional recipes for the preparation of fruit and vegetables little appreciated fifty or sixty years ago, as well as a simplification of the bill of fare or menu section, yet the main body of standard dishes remain practically as Francatelli wrote them, the substantial edifice of the authorâ€™s genius.

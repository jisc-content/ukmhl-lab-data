396 THE MODERN COOK circular fluted cutter from some puff paste, rolled seven turns; put these on a baking-sheet, egg them over with a soft brush, place a much smaller circular piece of paste on the top of each, again egg these over, and then bake them a golden colour; when done, trim, and place each on the top of one of the croustades after they are garnished. Timbales of Nouille Paste Prepare half a pound of nouilles as directed on p. 208, and parboil them in water for ten minutes, then drain thoroughly; after- wards toss them with an ounce of butter, a tablespoonful of good Bechamel sauce, and a little grated nutmeg in a deep dish over the fire for five minutes; then put them into a deep dish slightly spread with butter; cover them down evenly with a circular piece of buttered paper, and let them get cold. The preparation must then be turned out of the stew-pan on the table, upon a sheet of paper; and the croustades or timbales should be stamped out of this with a plain circular cutter about an inch and a half in diameter, and placed on a dish; they must next be rolled in fine bread-crumbs, afterwards dipped in beaten egg, and then bread-crumbed over again. Smooth the bread-crumbs on the timbales by rolling and patting them, place them on a dish, and with a plain circular cutter, an inch in diameter, stamp out the surface of each, exactly in the centre, making only a slight incision. When about to send the timbales to table, place them carefully in a frying-basket, plunge them in hot fat, and fry them a bright golden colour ; when done, drain, empty them carefully with a fork, and fill as required, replacing the top before sending to table. Note.â€”Croustades or small timbales may also be made of vermicelli or rice, prepared in the same way as nouilles. Bouchdes a la Mazarin Give seven turns to half a pound of puff paste, roll it out to the thickness of a penny-piece, and stamp out two dozen tops with a plain circular cutter, about one inch and a half in diameter; then gather up the trimmings, knead together, roll out, and stamp two dozen more; place these on a baking-sheet, about an inch and a half apart from each other, and wet them over with a soft brush; garnish the centre of each with a little force-meat of any kind, place the tops on them, and press down so as to fasten the two parts together; they must then be egged over, and baked in a rather quick oven; when done, dish up on a folded napkin, and serve. Mutton Patties a la Windsor Trim some slices of lean mutton; cut up into small pieces, and mix these with some fine herbs, consisting of chopped mushrooms, parsley, and shalot; season with pepper and salt, and add half a gill of reduced Espagnole sauce: use this preparation to fill some croustades lined with short crust, cover them with some of the same kind of paste, and bake them a light golden colour. When done,

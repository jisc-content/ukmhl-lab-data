384 THE MODERN COOK Normandy Sandwiches Mix finely chopped fresh shrimps or prawns with a little anchovy cream (anchovy paste mixed with whipped cream), and spread this between thinly cut and lightly buttered slices of white bread. Make up into neatly shaped portions, and dish up. Tartare Sandwiches Chop finely some lean cooked ham, also about a third the quantity of French gherkins and a few capers. Mix them with a little stiff Mayonnaise and tarragon vinegar. Spread the preparation between thinly cut slices of buttered bread, and make up into small sandwichesâ€”diamond, finger, or oval shapes. Dish up, and garnish with fan-shaped slices of gherkin and parsley.

Meanwhile chop and pound all the meat from the breast of the pheasant with the ham, and add two ounces of clarified fresh butter, one and a half gills of good sauce, and the glaze; season with cayenne pepper, a little nutmeg and salt, pound the whole thoroughly, and rub this preparation through a fine wire-sieve on to a dish. Next fill some small round or oval earthenware pipkins with this preparation, smooth the surface over with a spoon dipped in water, place in a covered stew-pan and steam for about half an hour.

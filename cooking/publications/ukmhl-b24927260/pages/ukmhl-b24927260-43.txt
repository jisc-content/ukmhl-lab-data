27 school-boys, must have been exceedingly tiresome, and enough to kill the disgusted masters—eonperto crede Roberto. Gifford in his translation of Juvenal, eludes, or rather misunderstands the sense; for he says : —Like hash’d cabbage serv’d for each repast. The repetition kills the wretch at last. however, Juvenal, who points at the Greek pro- verb, does not explain it. I cannot help mentioning here a very curious superstition of the ancients concerning this plant. We read in Athenajus that they used to swear by it. Nicander in his Georgies says, “ Our forefathers have named this plant /xavrtv xpa/xfnv,” the prophetic cabbage. Wherefore? is a question perfectly unanswer- able in our days. The Abbe de Marolles most inno- cently translates: prophete entre les choux. La Brassique a son air qui montre qu’il est doux. Obscurum per obscurius. Hipponax calls it a holy, a sacred plant; and adds: But when the dawn Aurora’s pearly doors Unbars, the sev’n-leav’d Brassic he adores. And culls it for Apollo’s feasts. The Abbe says here literally, La Brassique il adore, De sept feuilles orn^e, au lever de I’aurore, Pour la sacrifier aux ffites d’Apollon.

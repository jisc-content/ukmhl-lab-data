The name originates in the particular situation which this tree generally prefers ; that is the “ espalier,” or a wall exposed to the heat of the meridian sun. ^pri- cus, Lat. Avhich means the same, is often applied to other sorts of fruit ; and even to old men, Jprici senes, who delight in sitting and prattling on benches exposed to the reviving warmth of the god of light.

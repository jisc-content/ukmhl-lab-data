APPENDIX. WINE. Fina hihant homines, animalia ccttera fantes. The Latin poem and the English notes have for their immediate object the substance or body of an enter- tainment; but wine is the soul of the repast. Instead of treating the Gastronomer with deeply-learned dis- sertations, we intend merely to record a few ideas as they occur, and carry along with them some instruc tion and an accidental zest of amusement. Etymology. It may be interesting previously to observe that the word's, wine, Engl, wein, Germ, vin, Fr. T'tnum, Lat. and olvos, Gr. claim their common origin from p, iin, Hebr. the first Jod being, on account of rpnpfifmn ^ _ V, ou, or w, making vin, repetition, pronounced as v ouin, or win. Wine is mentioned for the first time in the Bible, Gen. ix. 21. Noah makes too free with It, and IS derided by one of his sons. Soon after we find wine doing mischief again between Lot and his daughters, Gen. xix, 34. But, Psalm, civ. 5, the inspired Lyric declares that it maketh glad the heart of man; ” and this eulogium has never been con- tradicted, as far as wine is drunk with relative mo- derationj yet, when taken to excess, this gladness of heart suddenly turns into madness of mind. If from Holy Writ we turn our eyes towards the of H^then writers, it will appear doubtful whether the Golden Age did ever know this “ heart- cheering” juice. They speak of streams of milk, of nectar, and even of wine, but not a word about cultivated grapes; from which circumstance, and other inductions, we may fairly conclude that the birth ol the god of wine was coetaneous with that of the god of war. o

76 the above-mentioned sacredness of the bean, takes place on the eve of Epiphany, and is performed in the following manner. A cake, made of flour, butter, and eggs, and of a size proportionable to the number of the guests, is brought in and divided into as many shares as “ convives ” are going to sit down to supper. These pieces, one of which conceals a bean lodged in the outer part of the cake, are tossed up in a nap- kin. The youngest person in the company, comes forward, and having said grace, takes hold of a slice without looking at it, and then addresses the master of the house by these words: “ Fabai Do- mine (lord of the bean), who is this for ? ” An answer is given, and when all the shares are drawn, the guest who finds the bean in his or her possession is declared king or queen of the feast, and becomes possessed of all the rights belonging to the Architricli- nus or Amphitryo for the night. When either drinks, if any one in the company misses to say aloud, “ the king” or “ the queen drinks,” a fine is lawfully ex- acted, which consists in a pledge deposited in the hands of some one, to be redeemed after supper by a kiss or a song. This sort of amusement was well known at Rome, with this difference, that the king of the feast was not chosen by means of a bean, but by the cast .of small bones called iali. They are the ankle-bones of sheep, which school-boys in France still use for a game called “ osselets;” having been previously smoothed upon a stone, and reduced to four sides. The tesserwy dice, have six. Horace sfiys. Car. B. 1. Od. 4.

57 The manner of dressing a hare is either roasting or jugging it. Roasted, well larded with small slices of bacon, and basted with a sprig of thyme, it proyes excellent when the animal is in a proper state. Jugged, that is stewed with onions, carrots, chestnuts, pars- ley, and dice of bacon, it also pleases the most learned palates. This is called in French civet de lievre,” a common dish in the cuisine bourgeoise.” In Horace’s time, the shoulders of a female hare were looked upon as the best parts of the whole : FcBcundi leporis sapiens sectahitur armos.—Sat. 2. The following lines are elegantly descriptive of what this timid and innocent animal must feel when hunted in the plain : ———And who can tell what pangs. What dreadful aches, her throbbing bosom tear. When at her heels the yelping pack of hounds. Thro’ brakes, thro’ hedges, open lawns, and dales. Presses on her th’ insequent death ? She runs. She flies, and leaps, and bounces, to deceive The scent-inhaling foes, who urge the chace. And toil to catch a booty not their own. The dales, the lawns, she crosses back in vain. Till fainting—breathless—spent, at last she drops On some fresh verdant turf or thymy bank. Once the gay scene of her nocturnal sports. By the words ‘‘ a booty not their own,” the author alludes to this Hatin line. Sic vos non vobis curritis arvu canes ,• the only one which was ever added to the well-known Sic vos non vobis, filled up by Virgil. 1

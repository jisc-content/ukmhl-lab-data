36 tooth soon detects the fraud, and his palate grieves at the disappointment. This dish, with the exception of the garum, (Pliny, 31,8.) is not unlike the Turkish pilau, and when genuine in all its parts, generally proves tasteful and wholesome; so much so, that physicians allow it to their patients in the primo limine of con- valescence, and accoucheurs to the ladies in the straw, when they fancy an appetite. The Romans were so desperately fond of fattened hens, (Poulardes, Fr.) that the good consul Caius Fannius, fearful lest the breed should materially suffer from this voracious practice, caused a law to pass the Senate in order to prevent any fatal consequence. Gastronomy frowned at the Senatus-consultum; but capons, properly edu- cated, being substituted in the coop for their emanci- pated sisters, hunger smiled, anger subsided, and all was right again. The Syrians of old used to worship hens on account of their fecundity, and the exquisite taste of their eggs, which, at Athens and Rome were carried, with pompous show, in the great festivals of Ceres. (Livy.) It has been remarked with a sort of superstitious wonder, that some hens have received from nature the masculine talent of crowing ; and, in general, such an anomaly is punished with death in the farm- house or cottage where this preposterous uttering is heard. And indeed there is a French proverb which says: Poule qui chante, pr^tre qui danse. Femme qui parle latin, Nâ€™arrivent jamais a belle fin.

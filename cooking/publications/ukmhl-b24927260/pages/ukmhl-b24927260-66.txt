but veal; and do not mince veal but mutton; yet they call minced meat ‘‘ Hachis.” V. 45. Ovis lingua. “Langues deMouton.” Sheep’s tongues. They are generally accompanied with stewed sorrel, or carrots. The Latin name of the last, Pastinaca, being on account of its quantity re- fused admission into the Hexameter or Pentameter line, is alluded to in the enigmatical turn of the se- cond part of the distich. V. 47. Vitalina subalbicat, “ Blanquette de veau.” Hashed veal. The French word “ blanquette" originates in the pleasingly white (blanc) appear- ance of this mess. The meat ought to have been roasted first; then it is consigned to the pan with a small quantity of fresh butter, then water, then cream or milk, then chopped parsley strewed over the whole. Onions are admitted, and sweet-breads mostly welcome. V. 49, 50. Cervix Meleagrcei apri. Hure de sanglier.” Wild boar’s head. This famous and savoury specimen of the art of cookery, is here negatively mentioned. But, instead of it, we may have that of a home-bred hog, from Hampshire, and particularly from the part of that county called the New Forest. Juvenal in his description of a feast. Sat. V. has the following lines : Anseris ante ipsum magnijecur, anseribus par Allilis, et Jlavi dignui Jerro Meleagri Fumal aper. The liver of a large goose, a capon equally as big, and a wild boar worthy of having been slain by the sword of Meleager, smoked before the master of the entertainment.

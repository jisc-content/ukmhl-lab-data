TO THE READER. —♦— This little Poem was written several years ago in an idle hour and at the solicitation of a few friends mostly foreigners, who challenged the author upon the appa- rent impossibility of expressing, in decent Latin verses, the curious and pleasingly tangible variety of dishes which French eating-houses and hotels lavishly dis- play upon their long and hardly intelligible Bills of Fare. A translation into English was proposed as a convenient appendage; but the Author declaring him- self exclusively fond of original and genuine dishes; and a translation being, at all times, and at best, what the French call “ un rechauffe,” this laudable suggestion was set aside. The Notes, at the end, are explanatory of the Poem—and yet may be read without it. They are especially intended to afford instruction and amuse- ment. The commentators humbly trust that they will not fall short of that intention.

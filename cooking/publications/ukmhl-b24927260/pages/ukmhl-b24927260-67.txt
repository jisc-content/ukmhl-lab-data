51 Commentators are of opinion that this animal was roasted barbecue, “ de la barbe a, la queue,” from beard to tail, as we etymologize it, consequently entire. It must be observed that we find also in this passage that the liver of a fat goose was already es- teemed a great dainty at Rome. V. 51. Nunquid amas sapidam pernam. Jam- bon.” Ham. The custom of fumigating hams is of a very ancient date, and was well known to the Romans. Horace mentions it. Sat. ii. 2.—117. — Fumoscc cum pede pernm. Several places on the continent are famous for the delicacy and flavour of their hams ; Westpha- lia, however, is at the head of the list.

Pickled pork here bears very little resemblance to what is called “ Petit sale” in France, where porkmen ge- nerally cook it in their own houses. From this circum- stance, viz. that of selling ready cooked meat, they are called “ chaircuiliers.” Cabbage is, by its mildness, a neutralizing accompaniment to pickled porkj but sweet sauce with roast pork appears to have been re- tained since the residence of the Romans in this Is- land. The Gauls substituted sharp seasonings, as garlic.

16 above, a man who, by having accidentally been able to study the difierent tastes of eatables, does accor- dingly select the best food, and the most pleasing to his palate. His character is that of a practitioner, and answers to the appellation of an epicure in the full sense of the word, as we use it in English. The gourmet on the other hand considers the theoretical part of Gastronomy; he speculates more than he practises ; and eminently prides himself in discerning the nicest degrees and most evanescent shades of goodness and perfection in the different subjects pro- posed to him. In fact, the word gourmet has long been used to designate a man who, by sipping a few drops out of the silver cup of the vintner, can instantly tell from what country the wine comes, and its age. This denomination has lately acquired a greater lati- tude of signification, and not improperly, since it expresses 'what the two other words could not mean. From the foregoing observations we must conclude that the glutton practises without any regard to theory; and we call him Gastrophile. The gormand unites theory with practice, and may be denominated Gas- tronomer. The gourmet is merely theoretical, cares little about practising, and deserves the higher appel- lation of Gastrologer. We need not inform the classical reader that the Greek word gaster, means the stomachy and all that relates to it, in a more extensive and somewhat figurative sense. The words vo/xor, nomos, (ptXoy, pJti- ios, and Xoyor, logos, added to it, classify the practiciil, physical, and theoretical varieties.

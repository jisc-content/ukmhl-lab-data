89 Cochlear, ‘^cuiller/’aspoon. The Latin name origi- nates from xoxXof, cochlea, a cockle-shell, the shape of which was originally imitated in the formatfon of a spoon. V. 189. Niveo colore ova. CEufs a la Neige.” Trifles. Eggs, well tossed up and properly tormented with a sort of whisk made of slender twigs for the purpose. The white of eggs, milk, and other ingre- dients, confining bubbles of air, swell to a frothy, light, and snow-white, substance, and are served among the “ entremets.” They appear in company with the tremulous « blanc-manger,” the multiform and amber-colour jellies, &c. on the very line of demar- cation between the rear of the second course and the van of the dessert. V. 191. Frigitur ovum. Fried eggs. This way of eating them is not to be laid aside. Fresh butter, hissing in the pan, receives the yolk and white, the vitellum and the albumen together, in its burning bo- som. One minute or two, and all the noise is over; and, sprinkled with pepper, salt, and a few drops of vinegar, they appear perfectly fit for the palate of the Gastronomer. The salamander x?. often held over them, and accelerates the culinary process. V. 192. Ova in patelld. « CEufs au miroir.” Eggs on an earthen pan. The vessel, in which the eggs are cooked upon a gentle fire of charcoal, being very smooth, furnished the idea of a looking-glass, or mirror, “ miroir," and suggested the quotation from Terence, Veluti in speculum, Adelphi, 3, 3, 61, with a slight grammatical alteration.

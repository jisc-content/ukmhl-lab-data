48 chosen, parts of the vena porta, and tough teguments of arteries, make the teeth of the Gastronomer recoil in an awkward attitude. Nothing, says the poet, is sweeter and more agreeable to the palate than this glandulous substance ; and the cook, when he knows how to avail himself of its qualities, will introduce it with success in many learned dishes, “ mets sa- vants.” We speak of the calf’s sweet bread; the ancients do not mention it as a food of any repute on their tables. That of a hog is called in Latin animellae ; aind, chopped with beaten eggs, was one of the compo- nent parts of an omelette, to which it gave a name. V. 41. Vervecis costula. " Cotelettes de mouton.” Mutton chops. It is rather surprising that the word cutlet should have been omitted by Johnson in his dictionary. The real mutton cotelettes,” cutlets, or chops, are, or ought to be, small ribs with part of the flesh adhering to them, as they run down from the neck to the hind part of the animal; but by ex- tension of sense, or license of expression, the word applies indiscriminately to any small parts cut olf where the bone and meat are closely united. They are here plainly broiled, toasted, or fried like veal; but treated with much more ceremony in France. Steeped in sweet oil, powdered with pepper and salt, crumbs or raspings of bread, and minced parsley, they pre- sent themselves to the Gastronomer’s palate with a more enticing taste than they naturally possess. Dressing, which goes so far at the toilette, is of no less importance in the subterraneous mysteries of the kitchen.

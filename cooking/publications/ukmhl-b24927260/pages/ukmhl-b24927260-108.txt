It is worthy of remark that, although very dissimilar in themselves, these names should have sprung from the same origin j namely, the case ot form in which this concretion of milk has been from time immemorial con- fined to obtain a shape. Casa begat caseus, caseus be- gat cheese, and/oma, “fromage.^’ The learned Grotius is quoted j Forma formaginem vocai. (Cours Gas- tronomique.) Cheeses are mentioned in holy writ, under the plural name Sheboth, 2 Sam. xvii. 29 j and the singular Ghebinah, Job, x. 10.

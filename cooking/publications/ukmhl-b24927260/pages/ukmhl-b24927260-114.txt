98 They also tell us that the vine-tree was brought from Persia to the Phoenicians, who took it to Greece^ Sicily, and Italy; and Plutarch states that from Etruria it was carried to the Gauls. Laying aside the records of fabulous ages, the expedition of Bacchus to the Ganges, the tragic death of the abstemious Pentheus, and other stories more amusing than true, we can safely assert, for we really believe, that in Greece, wine was known before the Trojan war, and even more than 1500 years before the Christian era. In the 9th book of the Odyssey we find that long before Homer’s time, a distinction had already been established between good and bad wine; since, when the crafty Ulysses presents the intoxicating cup to Polyphemus, the gourmet-like Cyclop evinces directly his discriminating sense of taste : he says, as follows in the literal translation of this passage, by our poet:— Arripit ille scyphum, spumanlemque impiger haurit, El caplus guslu repelilos poslulat haustus : Amplius, ah ! vini, precor amplius adde propinans Ut miki tu qui sts narranlem promplus amicutn Hospilio excipiatn. Sunt el Cyclupihus arva, Arva racemiferas ultrh gignenlia vites, Quas Jovis (Bstivus calefactas concoquit imher', Ast id ah Amhrosid el ccelesli Nectare manat, (a) Hesiod, in the 2d book of his Works and Days” shews that the cultivation of the vine-tree was well known in his time; for he gives directions about the vintage and advises Perse in the following words: Orion now, and Sirius, adorn The midnighl sky—now rosy-finger’d morn Spies bright Arcturus rising from the deep : Cull then, bring home your ripen’d grapes—and keep Them full expos’d ten long days to the sun. Wine was deservedly praised by all nations. Vir- gil made the cultivation of the grape the subject of part of his Georgies, B. II, and, from Anacreon to (a) See Pope’s Translation.

134 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. of sliced tomatoes, sprinkle some roughly-chopped curled parsley over them, and a table-spoonful of chopped capsi- cums ; pour in a little broth made from the fish bones and trimmings, with a glass of chablis, sauterne, or hock, cover the tin closely, and boil. A clove of garlic may he intro- duced in this dish by those who appreciate the faintest sus- picion of that fragrant bulb, and the fine rind of a lime also. If made of two or tln~ee sorts of little fishes, with a pinch of saffron, and, instead of the broth, a libation composed of one table-spoonful of salad oil, two table-spoonfuls of chab- lis, and three of water, the effect will be pleasing to those who have eaten, and enjoyed a bouillabaisse,, for the broth produced by the fish and ingredients I have named is not unlike that excellent composition. In my last chapter I dwelt upon the invaluable culinary process known as braising, and tried to point out the special adaptability of that method of cookery to the treatment of the small and often indifferently fed meat of this country. I did not however allude to a simpler yet scarcely less note- worthy kind of braise by which is produced that very excel- lent dish called:— Busuf a la mods. There is perhaps no name in the French vocabulary dc- cuisine more frequently “ taken in vain” by English cooks, as well as by poor Ramasamy, than this. As a rule they apply the term to a joint of cold roast beef when warmed up en rechauffe, and sent to table smothered with a thick sauce browned with burnt onion, and surrounded by sodden vege- tables ! Now, bceuf cl la mode is very far from being a re- chauffe. On the contrary, it is a carefully selected piece of fresh meat scientifically stewed with vegetables. Its rich, self-made gravy is not thickened, and its garnish should be composed of vegetables separately trimmed and cooked for that purpose.

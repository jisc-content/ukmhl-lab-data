325 MULLIGA T TINNY. volatile or blond de veau. Clear ox-tail thus flavoured is well-known at the Army and Navy Club in London under the name of queue de bcettf d l' Indienne. Fish consomme, i.e., a stock made from fish and vegetables, makes a capital basis for a thick mulliyatunny (see chapter 29) ; and a bisque or puree of shell-fish, flavoured with curry- paste, is a right royal potage. Vegetarians can fall back upon a stock composed of vege- tables,—consomme de legumes. This, artfully flavoured with a good mulligatunny paste, thickened with flour and butter, and enriched with lait d’dmandes, cocoanut milk, cream, or raw yolks of eggs, will he found to make a most excel- lent soupe maigre.

Throw them into a stew-pan, with half a pound of butter (tinned butter will do well), or clarified beef suet, a bunch of parsley, and a couple of ounces of celery. Pry until the vegetables begin to turn a red colour, then moisten with two quarts of hot water. Boil and skim, then put into the pan half an ounce of salt, a quarter ounce of black pepper corns, and a pint measure of green peas, with their shells cut into strips. Simmer for an hour, skim off any oil that may rise from the butter, and strain the broth into a basin through a tamis. Be careful in using turnips. Unless they are very young they are apt to be overstrongly flavoured in this country. Leeks are invaluable; if available I would put half a pound of them in with the carrots; a few sprigs of thyme or marjoram are also useful. A pint of French beans may be used instead of, or in addition to, the peas. This con- somme is, with a dash of white wine, quite fit to serve alone. Maccaroni or vermicelli may be added to it as a garnish, and grated Parmesan may accompany it. For ordinary mulligatunny maigre, however, plain eaude la cidsson may be employed.

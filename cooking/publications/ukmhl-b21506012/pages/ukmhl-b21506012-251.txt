SAVOURY TOASTS. 230 Woodcock toast is one of the most recherche of all savoury entremets of this class. Numerous recipes are given for it and its name is distorted by many writers upon cookery,, some of whom present it to their readers under the mean- ingless title of “ Scotch-Woodcock.” In its unpretending form this toast is exceedingly like one I have already given, viz. :—a better kind of anchovy toast with an egg- cream custard top-dressing, but real “ Woodcock toast ” should be composed as follows :—• Take two freshly boiled fowls’ livers,-— [those of a goose, a turkey, or a couple of ducks, are better still,- while the remains of apate de foie gras are superlatively the best] — pound the liver to a paste, mixing with it a tea-spoonful of anchovy sauce, or the flesh of one fish pounded, a pinch of sugar, plenty of fresh butter, and the yolk of one raw egg; dust into it a little spiced pepper, pass it through the sieve, and set it aside on a clean plate. Prepare four squares of golden-tinted, crisply-fried, bread, about half an inch thick, spread the liver paste over them, and set them in a moderate oven to retain their heat, but not to burn. Now, pour a coffee-cupful of good cream into a sauce-pan, which must either be dipped into a bain-marie, or placed over a very low fire indeed ; stir into it, as it warms, the carefully strained yolks of two raw eggs, continue stirring one way till the cream thickens nicely and is quite hot (without boiling) and pour it over your toasts: the egg whites (whisked by an assistant to a stiff froth whilst you were heating andthickening the cream) should belaid on the top of all, and the dish sent up without delay. Or the preparation may be slightly varied as follows :— Fry the toasts, butter them, and set them in a moderate oven to keep hot. When heating the cream,, stir into it the liver-paste as well as the raw yolks of two eggs, and pour it over the toasts as soon as it is quite hot, and thickened sufficiently, capping your dish with the whisked whites.

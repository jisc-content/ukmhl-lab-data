Whilst baking, make'a good veloute, in which you should pour the liquor of a tin of oysters, and use the broth made from the hones and trimmings of the pomfret. When the fish is nearly done, take it out of the oven ; pour the liquor from its dish into your veloute : garnish the fish with the oysters of the tin previously mentioned, and some black Leicestershire mushrooms, over all pour your veloute—which should be nice and thick,—set the dish in the oven again for five minutes, and serve with croiltons of bread, buttered on each side, and coloured a pale brown in the oven. This recipe can obviously be simplified for the home dinner :—after having detached the pieces of fish from the bones, set the latter and the trimmings to make a broth : season the fish, omitting the mushrooms, lay them together and bake, moistening with some of the broth, and a table- spoonful of mushroom ketchup.

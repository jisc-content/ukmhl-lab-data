554 OUR KITCHENS IN INDIA. garded by people of ordinary respectability as a common necessary of life ? Ingenious and painstaking persons who hesitate to go to the expense of an English range may, as I said before, effect a material improvement in their kitchen system by putting together a fire-place upon Home principles. I know of a case in which an experiment of this kind has been crowned with success. The method followed may be briefly described as follows :— A fire grate was first contrived by iron bars in the style of a cresset, rectangular in shape, and supported on four iron props ; it was made the full length and height of an English kitchen grate, but one-third less deep at back. Embedded in masonry on one side of this fire grate was an iron bazar-made boiler; the side of it nearest the fire had no masonry, and it fitted closely to the iron bars. The boiler was furnished with a brass tap. On the other side of the grate, set firmly in masonry, with its side towards the fire exposed, and with a close fitting door, was a bazar- made iron oven. The props of the cresset fire-place were set in masonry and cemented ; they were sufficiently long to sustain the fire, about the average height from the ground that kitchen fires are fitted in England. Over the top of the fire a flat sheet of iron connected the surface of the oven with that of the boiler, forming a very fair hot- plate. This iron sheet was moveable at pleasure. The topmost outer bar of the cresset was also moveable to allow a space for the admission of fuel when the hot-plate was fixed. The smoke was made to pass into a flue contrived with a few feet of ready-made stove piping, which passed through the wall of the kitchen at the back of the fire grate, and was then led up the wall to the roof. But by far the best thing introduced in this locally-de- signed kitchen was an English roasting “jack.” The

CULINARY JOTTINGS NOR MADRAS. 360 balls (made goodness knows how !) and Ido not recommend very much herb seasoning. Preserve the delicate flavour of the turtle to the utmost, and remem her that it is easily overpowered. For this reason I object in to to to the use of sheep’s head broth, for the soup when thus made tastes wholly of the “ sheepy” stock, and the turtle flavour is destroyed. Do not spoil the clear soup' by putting in isinglass, or cornflour starch. If the decoction of the fins, head, shells, and flesh has been properly prepared, there will be no lack of the gelatinous quality which is expected with clear turtle. If you happen to have caught an eel or two, one carefully cleaned and cut into two-inch pieces might go in with the turtle. For the stew and curry the preliminaries are the same as for the soup in so far as the extraction of the essence of the turtle fins, shells, &c., is concerned. The meat set aside to get cold is either stewed gently in this liquid, and flavoured in the manner specified for the soup, or curried a la mode Indiennc, the broth being used for the liquefac- tion thereof. Before winding up this subject, I would finally observe that fresh-water fish is by no means to be despised when kippered or collared. Here is an easy method for adoption in camp :—after having been scaled and cleaned, cut the fish open like a haddock, pepper it well over, and rub in salt: let the fish lie in this state during the night. In the morning, hang it in the sun to dry. Cut it into pieces, and fry them in butter in the evening, keeping them cold for breakfast. Or, instead of drying the fish in the sun, smoke it over a fire replenished with damp straw, and treat it as you would kippered fish. Here follows an epitome of rules which I have adapted

200 FRITTERS. that we should choose a deep, rather than a broad and shallow vessel, for the operation. The ordinary frying pan sold at hard-ware shops is of no use whatever for this branch of the cook’s work. The pan you want should look like a stew-pan with double handles, and its sides cut down half- way ; its diameter need not exceed eight or nine inches. It may be as heavy as you like, for it must, of necessity, be kept steady over the fire when in use. A handle like that of an omelette-pan is therefore unnecessary, for you never require to shake a friture-pan. Opinions differ as to the best frying medium. The great Careme advocated the use of the fat skimmed from the surface of thepot-au-feu after having been carefully strain- ed through muslin. Clarified suet, for which I give direc- tions in my chapter on pastry, is favorably regarded by Gouffe. Butter is hardly to be recommended for this kind of frying as it heats very'quickly and is apt to burn. Oil is, of course, an excellent medium, but it is difficult to get good out in India, and too expensive. Lard (imported) may be used, but I do not like it even in England for it always adheres to a certain extent to the thing fried. Good Indian ghee made at home, or procured fresh and then clarified as recommended for suet, is by no means to be despised. I personally have always used clarified beef suet. Besides your pan, for delicate fritter work there is noth- ing more useful than the wire frying-basket,—a cheap thing enough, and not hard to make. Provided with this utensil, which may be described as an open-work draining pan, slightly smaller in diameter than thefriture-pan, the whole process of working may be thus described:— 1. —-Make your batter, to begin with, according to one of the receipts hereafter given, and place it in its bowl on one side, covered up from fiies, dust, &c. 2. —Prepare your fish, meat, vegetable, fruit, or what-

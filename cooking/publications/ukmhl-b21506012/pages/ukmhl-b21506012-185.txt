OUR VEGETABLES. 173 cut when raw, it “ sweats,” and loses much of its moisture. Boil first, and peel afterwards. This advice, though con- trary to that of most writers on cookery, is the result of personal experience. Asparagus, and seakale, if procurable, should be picked carefully, washed, and tied up with tape in little bundles with all the heads level : then, with a very sharp knife, the stalks should also be cut level. Put the trimmed bundles into fast boiling water with a good allowance of salt and a little sugar. The bundles should then be carefully drain- ed, and the tape severed, the vegetable being served cm na- turel, with “ Dutch sauce,” or a plain dressing of oil, vinegar, pepper, and salt. The following valuable wrinkle is given by the author of Food and Feeding :— Asparagus of the stouter sort, always when of the giant variety, should be cut of exactly equal lengths, and boiled ’ standing ends (the green tips) upwards, in a deep sauce-pan. Nearly two inches of the heads should be out of the water —the steam sufficing to cook them, as they form the ten- derest part of the plant; while the hard stalky part is ren- dered soft and succulent by the longer boiling which this plan permits. A period of thirty or forty minutes on the plan recommended will render fully a third more of the stalk delicious, while the head will be properly cooked in the steam alone. There is a custom followed by ignorant English, as well as by native cooks, of placing a slice of toasted bread in the dish destined to receive a bundle of asparagus, seakale, &c., over which they finally pour a plentiful bath of tasteless flour and water called “ white sauce.” The toast is utterly unnecessary, and the sauce—butter plainly melted—ought invariably to be handed round, piping hot, in a boat. A few drops of tarragon vinegar may be stirred into this “ Dutch

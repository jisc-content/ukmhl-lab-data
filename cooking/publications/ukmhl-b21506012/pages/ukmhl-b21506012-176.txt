164 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. equal size. I once saw a dish of turnips served d la creme which was quite worthy of separate service afe an entremets : the roots had been cut into pieces and shaped about the size of a bantamâ€™s egg, boiled to a turn, and served with a coffee-cupful of boiling cream poured over them to finish with. Trimmed in the same way, young turnips can be sent up d lapoulette or ala, bechamel. The French dish of young turnips called ngvets glaces ought to he very popular. Trim the turnips into shapes like small pears, or cones, and boil them till nearly done in salt and water ; drain them, and put them into a sauce- pan with plenty of melted butter, and sprinkle thei'n boun- tifully with powdered sugar, stir gently over the fire until they begin to brown, and then add a spoonful or two of clear stock : pepper and salt should now be given, let them simmer till quite tender and serve them in their own sauce. It is recommended by some to let the sugar form a sort of caramel round the turnips before adding the stock : in that case you must put the turnip pieces (when the cara- mel stage has been reached) into a separate sauce-pan, wash out the first one with a little stock, pour that over them, and stew gently as in the other recipe. Caramel is, of course, sugar slowly melted over the fire, till it has attain- ed a rich brown tint. Parsnips, knolkhol, and small round onions, (of the size usually pickled) are susceptible of similar treatment, and any brown entree may be garnished with vegetables glacis in this form. The puree of turnips with cream is, of course, well known, and all root vegetables make toothsome additions to your ordinary dish of meat, or cutlets, as purees, or when cutup and mixed cunningly as a macedoine de legumes.

The menu should invariably indicate the particular vege- table you intend to serve with the relevd, thus :— Selle cle moutonaux haricots verts, Fricandeauau chou-fleur, Piece dc bceuf braisee an celeri, Quartier d’agneauauxpetits pois, dc. To save time, a portion of the vegetable named should be helped with the meat, potatoes alone being handed round. It is the essence of ignorance, and of bad taste to send a number of vegetables round with the joint. Almost as bad, in fact, as the practice of serving them with the entrees. At a large dinner, you sometimes see turnips, cabbages, cauliflowers, French beans, and potatoes (occupying five waiters) going round together. For the Anglo-Saxon delights in quantity, and his soul loveth display exceed- ingly. Masses of incongruous diet may be necessary at a yeomanry festival, or after an Agricultural Show at the county town ; but educated people who have travelled, and who have had opportunities of forming refined notions of human nature in general, and of food in particular, ought surely to be better satisfied with a little, really well considered, than with abundance inartistic in its arrange- ment, and indifferently served.

THE MENU. 7 many dinner-givers appear to be somewhat hazy. The rot is, correctly speaking, a service of roast poultry or game : it should be accompanied by a nice salad, and it is often garnished with potato chips and water-cress. An entremets dc legume may either be handed round with it, or follow it separately. In Brillat Savarin’s time the truffled turkey appeared as a rot, and Sir Henry Thompson recommends the presentation at this period of the feast of the truffled pheasant or larded capon the dindonneau (turkey poult), the fatted fowl, &c. It is, therefore, pretty evident that if we serve our rots according to this—the undoubtedly correct interpretation— it would be absolutely preposterous to serve immediately before them a goodly joint of mutton or of beef with its concomitant vegetables. Between two courses so nearly equal in substance, there would plainly be no contrast, and the effect would be both overpowering and common- place. We are now at liberty to consider the releve. Strictly speaking, this word cannot be translated “ joint.” It should properly be interpreted the “remove,” and in the French menu, the dish of which it is composed is regarded as the piece de resistance of the dinner. To begin with, it ought, if possible, not to be roasted. According to the authorities I have named, it should rather be an artistic braise, fricandeau, or a whole fillet, larded and served with an ex- cellent sauce, and specially chosen and trimmed vegetables. Thus, the releve becomes very nearly as elaborate as a made-dish, and is scarcely what an Englishman means when he speaks of the “joint.” It need scarcely be said, then, that if this system be fol- lowed in its entirety, the rot and the relevd being correctly selected, the service of one or two light entrees between them is both intelligible and artistic.

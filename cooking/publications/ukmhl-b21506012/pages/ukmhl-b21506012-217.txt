205 ON LUNCHEONS. Braise a neck of mutton, or a breast, in gravy, with vege- tables and some chopped bacon : slip a slice of bacon under the flap of either, and tie it in shape before you commence operations : when almost done, lift the little joint up, strain off the gravy, skim it, and make a nice sauce with it such aspiquante, poivrade, or Italienns. Put the joint intheoven after bread-crumbing it, to brown and finish cooking ; when ready, dish it surrounded by boiled maccaroni over which the sauce should be poured at the last minute. Tomato pulp may be used for this purpose with marked effect, and' some glazed turnips or carrots may garnish the dish, in which case the sauce should be served separately in a boat. From the following dishes the luncheon of a lady, or an invalid ought to be easily selected :—- A nicely roasted snipe, orapigeon barde, with potato chips. A single canape, of prawn, or a little patty of puff-pastry filled with any tasty mixture. A savoury omelette, spinach on toast with “ buttered-egg,” or served with short-bread biscuits. A little plate of peas, tossed in butter with dice of fried ham or bacon. Coquilles of fish en rechauffe, or of any delicate vegetable. Indian corn, boiled, stripped with a fork from the cob, tossed in melted butter, peppered, and salted, is generally liked; see that the cob is quite a young one. A cheese fondue en caisse. Savoury toasts of all kinds, from the homely Welsh rare- bit upwards, are welcome on the luncheon table. I treat of them, you will find, in cxtenso in a separate chapter. For an easily made ‘ sweet ’ there ought not to be much difficulty in making a selection. The sweet omelette, souffle, omelette-soufld, dc., cost little trouble, and are quickly made. 18

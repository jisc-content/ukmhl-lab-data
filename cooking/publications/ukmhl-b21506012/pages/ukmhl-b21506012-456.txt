MENU FOli A DINNER OF SIX. 444 stoned, one table-spoonful of parsley minced fine, and one of shallot, also minced. Mix the whole lightly together with a sauce made with raw yolks of eggs, oil, vinegar, pepper, and salt (page 203). Ornament with hard-boiled eggs, caviare, prawns, olives farcies, pickles, truffles, &c. Sweet capsicums are a nice addition, not only for their flavour, but on account of their brilliant colour. I have heard of a pate cle foie-gras being cut up and added to this dish, an atrocity which surely a momentâ€™s reflection will condemn. Who would eat anchovies and caviare with their pate ? The Salade Busse is essentially a fishy preparation.

306 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS, way alone will you be able to guard against the disappear- ance of half an ounce of this, or an ounce of that,—petty pilferings that take from the curry-powder that which it cannot get again, and leave it poor indeed.” Inasmuch, therefore, as short weight can be more easily detected in fairly large than in small quantities, an addi- tional reason presents itself for making up the entire recipe. The coriander-seed and fenugreek must each be parched very carefully, i.e., roasted like coffee berries, before being pounded, and the other ingredients should be cleaned and dried, each separately, and, when pounded, should be well sifted. In order to preserve the proportions after the seeds have been powdered and sifted, it is necessary to obtain much larger quantities of the various ingredients in the first instance. Coriander-seed, for example, is very oily and only a part of it will pass through the sieve; twenty-four ounces of the seed will not yield more than eight ounces of powder: eight ounces of turmeric root will give four of powder : cummin-seed loses about one-third of its origi- nal weight in the process of sifting, and dried chilli skin about half. Weights having been tested, the whole of the powders should be mixed, a quarter of a bottle of salt being sprink- led in by degrees during the process. The bottles, thoroughly cleansed and dried in the sun, may now be filled and corked tightly down, the tops being securely waxed over. Some recommend that, when the powder has been mixed, it should be browned in melted butter over the fire, then dried in the sun, and powdered again, in order to tone down the strong flavour of the cummin-seed. This is a stock'powder, the flavour of which can be varied

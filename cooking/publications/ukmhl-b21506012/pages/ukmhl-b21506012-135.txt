BRAISING AND ROASTING. 123 of view, utterly wrong. Setting aside the cruelty, of cutting a fowl’s throat, and throwing it on the ground to bleed to death in agony, what an idiotic thing it is to waste the very part of the bird from which its gravy, and juiciness are de- rived ! White meats are bled in England simply to pro- duce the necessary tint, but they lose much of their nutri- tious quality by the process. They, however, may afford to do so. Our poorly flavoured birds can ill endure the loss of an atom of the richness that they may possess. I main- tain, therefore, that a merciful, and instantaneous death, by a heavy blow from a wooden mallet, would be pleasanter for the fowl, and far better for us :—the blow should be given on the back of the head. Besides those I have mentioned there are still two evil practices to be noted to which Native cooks are prone. The first, is that of parboiling joints and poultry before roasting them : the second, is that of keeping joints, &c., far too long on the spit. As a rule, Bamasamy heedless of the clock com- mences operations much too soon, and then keeps the meat on the spit before a low fire until it is wanted. Strict orders should be issued to prevent the first of these errors, and a table, showing the time that various joints require in roast- ing properly, should be hung up in the kitchen to prevent the second. If the spit be protected from draughts with a screen, and the fire evenly maintained, and sufficiently brisk for the ope- ration in hand— A large turkey, 8 Mbs. will take an hour and three-quarters. A hen-turkey, 34 lbs. ,, forty-five minutes. A capon, 4 lbs. ,, fifty minutes. A fowl, 3 lbs. A pigeon A duck A goose, 6 lbs. ,, a quarter of an hour. ,, twenty-five minutes. ,, an hour and a half half an hour.

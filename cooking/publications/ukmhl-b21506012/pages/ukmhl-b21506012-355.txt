343 CAMP COOKERY. Note.—For various methods of treating preserved food of all kinds, see Wyvern’s annotated catalogue of Messrs. John Moir and Son’s provisions. I will now jot down a list of culinary accessories which should be taken out to camp, if possible. Quantities should be regulated, of course, according to the probable duration of the tour, and the facilities or difficulties of transport. Those who have constantly to go into canvas will find it very convenient to have a case fitted up for the reception of the bottles and tins appertaining to this branch, apart from the ordinary store box which of course may be lavishly or frugally supplied. My list is confined to flavourings, &c., of use alone in the composition of dishes :— Anchovies in oil. Bacon. Baking powder. Bologna sausage. Brand’s or Liebig’s essence. Cheese grated.

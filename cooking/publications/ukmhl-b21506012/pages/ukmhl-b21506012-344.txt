332 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. I baked at home regularly for some years using, for ordi- nary bread, Yeatman’s baking powder, American flour, salt, and water ; for fancy rolls, the same with butter, and milk ; and have discovered, after many experiments, that in this country, the proportions of baking powder to flour which are laid down in the paper of directions accompany- ing each tin, have to be increased. For eight ounces of Hour, for instance, I find that I have to use two tea-spoon- fuls of Yeatman. I may say without hesitation that very few bread-makers hit at perfection at starting. I struggled through many disheartening attempts, before I turned out the thing I wanted. The common mistakes are overworking the dough, and using too much liquid. The mixing of dough with the proper quantity of fluid can only be acquired by practice, and all beginners knead too heavily through overzeal. Watch a professoi*. The fair-haired artiste who used to demonstrate bread-making at Mr. Woolf’s, made a pound loaf with three-quarters of a tea-cupful of water; her touch was as light as a feather, and the dough was made with wonderful swiftness. I have taught my servant to use two wooden spoons to work his dough with ; the result is satis- factory as regards the lightness of the bread, and to those who dislike eating food mauled by native fingers, the system is especially attractive. If by any chance your dough has been made too sloppily, and from its putty-like consistency, you feel convinced it will be heavy, hake it in a tin. Indian flour (sooji) is more easily moistened than imported flour, i.e., less liquid is required to form dough with it. Pro- portion :—half a pint to a pound of imported ; the same to one pound two ounces of sooji. The paraphernalia of the home-baker should be:—a large enamelled iron milk basin, two wooden spoons, a flour dredger, scales to weigh the flour, some patty-pans for rolls, some small tins for ditto, a baking-sheet, a half pound

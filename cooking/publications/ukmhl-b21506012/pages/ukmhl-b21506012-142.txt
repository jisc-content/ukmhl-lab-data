Now pour a hottle of Marsala into a clean pan, place the ham therein and simmer over the fire for half an hour, turn it now and then, take it out, glaze it, and serve. This process as regards the trine is far more effective than the old one of putting in wine, cider, or beer, in the first instance. Marsala remember is quite as good as Ma- deira for this purpose.

The ham should either be dredged over as I have described, or, if wanted for a ball supper, wedding breakfast, luncheon party, or grand picnic, it should he glazed, a recipe for which process will be found elsewhere.

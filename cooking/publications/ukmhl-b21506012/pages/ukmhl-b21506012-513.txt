MENU FOR A LITTLE HOME DINNER. 501 ready in a soup plate. Take a roomy sauce-pan, melt a dessert-spoonful of butter at the bottom' of it over the fire, stir in a dessert-spoonful of flour; when nice and creamy, add a cupful of consomme, stirring vigorously, and continue to add consomme and kidney paste by degrees, working them well together, till you have used them up; now let the puree come to the boil; add a glass of port, a tea-spoon- ful of red currant jelly, a tea-spoonful of good vinegar, and sufficient caramel coloring to give the soup a warm brown tint, stir well for a minute over the fire, and serve with croiUons of fried bread. A coffee-cupful of boiling cream, or a coffee-cupful of milk in which the yolk of an egg has been stirred, may be added to this soup off the fire for additional richness. It will be found so like a game soup that many will doubt its having any connection with kidneys. After a day’s hard work, a rich sustaining soup of this kind is often very acceptable. 2.—Choose a nice crab, have it boiled, cleaned, and Baked cnb picked : place the meat in a soup plate, and give it a dust of black pepper. Boil till tender sufficient maccaroni to line the bottom of a small pie-dish, and grate a tea-cupful of mild cheese. Now rub the bottom of the pie-dish with butter, place the maccaroni thereon, and pour a coffee-cupful of well made white sauce over the maccaroni. Shake a dust of grated cheese over its surface. Next place the crab meat, well worked with melted butter, over the maccaroni, and, as you arrange it, dust it with black pepper. Over the crab dredge a nice dressing of the grated cheese, about one-eighth of an inch deep, and pour a little melted butter over the surface. Bake till the top takes colour, and serve. No sauce is necessary with this, but if you like, you can send round a sauce piquante, or any plain sharp relish of that class (page 93).

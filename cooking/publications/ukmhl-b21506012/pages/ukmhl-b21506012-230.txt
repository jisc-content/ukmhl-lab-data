218 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. should be shunned most studiously. The correct use of vinegar is, therefore, to my mind the feature which con- tains the main difficulty in mixing a salad. The following rules for plain salad-dressing may be trusted I think :— Pull the leaves of the lettuce from the stalk with your hand, rejecting all that are bruised and discoloured, turn those at all muddy into a basin, wash them well, and drain them thoroughly on a sieve, tossing them lightly in a cloth afterwards to get rid of every drop of water. Leaves that are quite clean ought not to be wetted at all. When dry, put the leaves into the bowl, and work them about with the wooden spoon and fork whilst an assistant sprinkles over them a libation of the finest oil you can buy. As soon as every leaf is thoroughly anointed,-—glittering with a coating of moisture as it were,—shake over them a few drops of tarragon vinegar, add some very finely chopped mild spring onion, and dust the whole with salt, and some coarse, freshly ground black pepper. The spoon and fork must be kept going during the addition of the vinegar drops, and also whilst the pepper and salt are being dusted into the bowl. The thing to avoid is a sediment of dress- ing. The leaves lying at the bottom of the bowl must, in that case, become sodden, and so the crispness you desire to maintain will be marred. A thorough lubrication is all that has to be accomplished. I picked this up several years ago from a French waiter at Verrey’s dining-rooms in London: it was surprising how much oil was caught up by the dry crisp leaves, and how little vinegar was put in as a finishing touch by this accomplished Gargon. Observe, pray, that it is quite out of the question to give fixed quantities with regard to the mixing of this kind of salad. The quantity of oil, and of the other ingredients, must obviously depend on the quantity of green stuff.

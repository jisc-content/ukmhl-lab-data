MENU FOB A DINNEB OF SIX. 456 flour keeps well for a long time. Choose some potatoes of a good mealy kind, peel and wash them (raw), and grate them to a pulp with a strong bread grater, emptying the grated stuff into a large bowl of clean spring water: stir the potato and water together briskly for a few minutes, and then let the former settle ; after resting ten minutes, strain off the water: repeat the process with another basinful of water, and let it rest after stirring for ten minutes, again straining off the water ; and continue the washings, so to speak, until the water remains quite clear after the sediment has settled at the bottom of the bowl: about three changes of water generally suffice for this. When satisfied that the grated potato has been thoroughly cleansed, take it out of the bowl, drain it, and spread it out upon dishes to dry and bleach in the sun, turning it frequently. When quite dry, pound it in a mortar, and pass the flour so obtained through a silk or hair sieve. Bottle it securely in dry bottles, and cork it down tightly. It will be white and quite flavourless. GINGER PUDDING. Boil a pint and a half of milk flavoured with a few drops of essence of vanilla and sugar to taste ; then strain. Beat up six eggs, and pour the flavoured milk upon them. Put the mixture into a bain-marie, and stir gently over the fire until it thickens. Dissolve an ounce and a half of gelatine in a little milk, add this'to the custard, and stir the mix- ture until nearly cold, whip and add four ounces of pre- served ginger cut very small, pour the mixture into an oiled mould, and when cold and quite set, turn it out.

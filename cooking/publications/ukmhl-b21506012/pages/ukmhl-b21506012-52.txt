CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 40 take away that smoky taint which all our utensils get in India owing to our wood fires, and chimneyless ranges. 2. Use soft water rather than hard. 3. One shin of Indian beef is enough for two persons. The proportion of meat to bone in a shin of poor Indian beef is however so largely in favour of the latter, that the addition of a pound of flesh is advocated. For six people a good clear soup should be made from one shin and two pounds of flesh. 4. Put the fresh soup-meat with the bones separately broken up, and the salt, into cold water : hot (not boiling) water should be poured round meat and bones that have been previously cooked. 5. A quart of water to half a pound of meat and bone is said to be the outside you can allow in England, but a smaller proportion will be found advisable in India—a quart to a pound for instance. In any circumstances there must be sufficient water to cover the meat and bone. 6. Kemember that slow boiling, and retarding actual boiling as much as possible, are important points to start with. 7. Skim frequently during the early stage of your pro- ceedings,—a cup of cold-water thrown into the pot causes the scum, and fat to come up quickly, and, of course, retards boiling. Repeat this process till all scum is removed, and as much of the fat as possible also. 8. Use a wooden spoon. 9. Do not cover up your stock pot closely, the steam should evaporate to assist the strength of the soup, and keep it clear. 10. Put in your vegetables, flavouring herbs, &c., a fter the skimming is finished, and let them simmer till they are done—and no longer.

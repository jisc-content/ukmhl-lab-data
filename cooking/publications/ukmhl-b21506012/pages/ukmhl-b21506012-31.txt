19 CERTAIN KITCHEN REQUISITES. Whilst the men were busy at stables, the Colonel rode about inspecting everything ; presently he came upon the neatly excavated kitchens, but, to his astonishment, found them deserted ! Not a cook was to be seen ! Orderlies flew to find out where on earth the men’s breakfasts were being cooked, and in a few minutes, the whole corps de cuisine was discovered squatting at work more suo in a dry nullah hard by. The Colonel furiously demanded why the proper kit- chens had not been used, and “ all this abominable mess prevented ?” Presently a cook of greater daring than his colleagues replied “ What sar ! that bad sense kitchen, sar, I beg your pardon : too much firewood taking: see sar this prdper kitchen only." In the face of such an irresistible argument, the Colonel (albeit irritated beyond measure) was constrained to abandon his cherished project. When presenting Ramasamy, therefore, with novel uten- sils, let us guard against his denouncing them as “ bad sense.” We must patiently show him how to use them, proving, if we possibly can, by practical illustration, the satisfactory results, saving of time, and so forth, to be gained by their means. Anything complicated should, of course, be avoided. As far as my personal experience goes, I confess that I have found liamasamy by no means difficult to teach. All native cooks take readily to the mincing machine, and I find that my chef fully appreciates the vegetable cutter, root-knife, dishing-up fork, gravy strainer, wire sieve, hair sieve, colander, mortar, wire frying basket, “ Warren’s fish kettle and vegetable steamer,” and the larding needle, which he-can use easily. Larding is one of the branches of the cook’s art which comes naturally to a native; as a rule also I think that they surpass Europeans in boning poultry, an operation which Martha rarely attempts.

105 SA UCES—CONCL TIDED. (g) . Let the contents of your sauce-pan come to the hoil, stirring the whole time, then strain the sauce through your tin strainer into a clean sauce-pan, and set the vessel in the bain-marie to remain hot till wanted. (h) . Any fat that may rise after the thickening pro- cess should be skimmed off, but if the gravy be properly made, and skimmed before it is added to the ronx, there will be very little to take off in the bain-marie stage. The bain-marie, remember, is a vessel containing boiling- water, and kept over the fire, in which you immerse sauce- pans containing made-sauces to preserve them hot for use. For a dinner party this amount of Espagnole will provide the foundation required for two or three brown sauces. Espagnole sauce, therefore, is simply, a good, rich, brown, meat gravy, thickened with butter and flour. It only pos- sesses the flavour derived from the vegetables, and from the ordinary meat that you have employed to make it. Using this sauce as your medium or basis, you can proceed to com- pose a number of rich preparations as follows:—Financidre, Perigueux, Bordelaise, Provencals, Genevoise,Matelote, Cha- teaubriand, Regence, Italienne, and Reforms, with others too numerous to mention. The speciality of the sauces I have enumerated, consist in the distinct flavouring of the Espagnole, from which they are really made, with essence of mushrooms, truffles, game or of pigeons, poultry, fish, or ham (concerning which I shall speak later on), wine in judicious proportions, delicate vegetables, and so on. A careful perusal of the receipts, given hereafter in my menus, ought to guide you, when once you have achieved an undeniable foundation with your Es- pagnole'. Game fragments, poultry, mushrooms, &c., must, on no account, be used in making Espagnole, for such ingredients

Take a small tin of asparagus, open it, Clear soup with alK[ turn the pieces out upon a dish, draining from them all the liquor of the tin. Choose American asparagus if you can, because- it is so much greener than either the French or English. When drained, cut the tender ends of the asparagus into pieces half an inch long using a dessert-knife. Put them away carefully, and throw the tough ends and liquor into the soup kettle to flavour the consomme.

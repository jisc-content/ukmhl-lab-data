298 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. the wine is reduced, then add a pint of clear chicken broth, simmer for half an hour, remove the sauce-pan from the fire and strain the essence. The essence of truffles is the correct thing, but for that the fresh truffles are necessary. After having poured the essence into the pie, let it get quite cold, then turn it out of the tin, put it upon a nap- kin, and serve. If made with uncooked seer-fish instead of salmon, the pie will he found excellent. There are, of course, many other pies concerning which I could give advice. I am, however, pretty confident that if you hear in mind the principles I have tried to make clear, you will rarely fail to succeed in composing a very eatable ‘pasty,’ and win approval from those'for whose delecta- tion you may exercise your ingenuity. On the Hills, at Bangalore, and at many of the stations of this Presidency during the cold months, every one of the pies I have described will be found when cold to contain firm jelly,—not liquid gravy. If you desire to produce that cheerful effect at Madras, do not forget to place the pie upon ice for some little time before the meal at which it is to appear. The jelly is, of course, the united result of the gravy made from bones trimmings, sheep’s feet, and beef, and the juices of the various meats in the pie extracted by baking. During the hot weather on the plains, if you cannot ice the pie, it will he found a good plan to pour off the gravy after it has left the table, hot. This will prevent the meat turning sour. The gravy can he heated the next morning, and the pie can he warmed up. Cold pie, without artificial cold imparted by ice, is an impossibility with the thermo- meter at 90°.

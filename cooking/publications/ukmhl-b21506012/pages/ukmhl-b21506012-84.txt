CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 72 A cutlet to be grilled having been lifted out of the marinade, and wiped, should be dipped at once in a little melted butter, or salad oil, and broiled over a clear fire. Do not turn a cutlet or fillet, while grilling it, with a fork ; the prick causes the gravy to flow,—use cutlet tongs. If to be stewed, it should be first browned by being turned frequently in a saute-pan with a little melted butter; the previously prepared gravy and vegetables (cold) should then be put into the stew-pan, in which the cutlet should simmer gently till done. The whole success of a stew depends upon simmering. If the cook carelessly allow the gravy in the pan to come to the boil, the cutlets (or any- thing else) will be done for. How often are hashes, and rechauffes of cold meat sent to table as hard and tasteless as leather, simply because the cook permitted them to boil ? Hashes and salmis of cold meat and game may be defined, properly speaking, as carefully composed sauces in which cooked meat is placed cold, and then gradually heated until sufficiently hot to serve. My own rule with a salmis is to take it off the fire as soon as the steam rises freely from the surface, to turn it immediately into a silver dish heated with scalding water, and send it up. Hashes and salmis are much improved if the cold meat composing them be soaked in the sauce (cold) for some time before ^cooking. The process of bread-crumbing a cutlet for frying deserves far more care than the great majority of cooks bestow upon it. To do this really nicely (for an entree), you should proceed in this way. Lift your cutlet from the marinade, drain it a moment, wipe it dry, and then dip it into the following composition :—two eggs, one dessert- spoonful of salad oil, and one dessert-spoonful of water, well beaten together. Now turn it over and over in a plateful of fine, stale bread-crumbs which have been dried

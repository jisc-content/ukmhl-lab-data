295 A FEW NICE PIES. The essence recommended in the last chapter for “ snipe pudding” would improve this pasty. Birds badly knocked about in shooting come in usefully for gravy. Partridges, and quails make good pies, but they require a sound and strong support in the way of fresh meat, and good gravy with ham and bone essence. Beef,—the tender undercut, or rib-meat,—forms the best basis you can devise : it should be cut up into collops, as I have fre- quently said before, and strips of bacon should be rolled round them. Or you can use the blade-bone collops of good mutton just described, or the neck cutlets ; each cutlet should be trimmed neatly, with a strip of bacon wrapped round it. Excellent gravy can be obtained from the scraps left after trimming the beef or the cutlets, the remnants of the birds not wanted in the pie, and a pound of gravy meat, with the usual vegetables, and other flavouring ingredients often described. A little wine is almost a sine qua non with these game birds : Madeira, sound brown sherry, ormarsala —of which a glass is quite enough. A good “ Game pie" is a capital thing for the ball supper, luncheon, or breakfast party. Snipe, quails, partridges, hares, pigeons, teal, wild duck, &c., &c., can be thus dis- posed of most advantageously: they must be assisted by tender beef, or good mutton collops ; slices of bacon, of ham, or of Bologna sausage must be introduced, and the gravy must be very attentively composed. Proceed as follows :— (a) —Take the livers of all the game composing the pie, and make the composition described elsewhere as "foie-gras forcemeat” using the game livers instead of that of a calf. The method of using this will be explained presently. (b) —As the game must he boned in the case of this parti- cular dish, we shall have to mash all the bones with the pestle, and throw them with the trimmings into our stock-

CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 188 No more useful present coulcl well be given to a young lady commencing house-keeping than a set of silver, or sil- ver-plated coquilliis (scallop shells). Served in these invit- ing looking little dishes, a mince, or rechauffd of vegetables, is worthy of a place at any table. A.puree, of artichoke, cap- ped with finely-grated cheese, any cold fish, minced game, even the remains of a maccaroni au gratin, sent up in this tasty manner, seem ever so much nicer than in an ordinary way. The shells should be well buttered before operations are commenced, and the miuce or chopped vegetables should be well diluted with sauce to keep it nice and moist. The surface should be sprinkled over with cheese or finely rasped crumbs. When quite hot, brown the crumbs with a hot iron salamander-fashion, and serve the shells tastily on a napkin. Crisply fried curly parsley may garnish them. ——B-* - w . ■ *

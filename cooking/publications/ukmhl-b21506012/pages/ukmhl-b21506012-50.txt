Talking of soup-meat, does every one know that the potted meats so largely exported, and commonly appre- ciated in this country, are made from the meat of which the tinned soups are composed ? It is a fact nevertheless, and every atom of meat is thus turned to account by the preserved provision dealers. The potted meat you see in a confectioner’s window at home, neatly capped with melted butter, is made from the beef which produced the stock of the mock-turtle (I bet anything it is “mock- turtle,”) he advertises at a shilling a basin—enterprising man!

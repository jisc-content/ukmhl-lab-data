CAMP COOKERY(OUR FRESH-WATER FISH). 353 ed the following recipe for its imitation :—“Take a Palmer’s composite candle, stuff it with needles and hair-brush bris- tles, and boil it in ditch-water.” Even in Isaak Walton’s days the French called it un vilain, and for all time it has been condemned as being woolly, tasteless, and full of bones. If then it can be shown that, this disgraceful character not- withstanding, the chub can be presented as “a most excel- lent dish of meat,” surely we ought to be of good cheer in regard to the capabilities of many of our fresh-water fishes which we have hitherto ignored. The writer quoted by Mr. Cholmondeley-Pennell in the work aforesaid, states that having been much struck by a delicious plat of fish at a dinner at a country-house, he was much surprised at discovering from his hostess that it was made of the much despised chub ; he accordingly obtained the recipe (said to have been procured in Italy from a Jewish family) which may be summarised as follows :— Divide the fish, as freshly caught as possible, into fillets of three or four inches in length and two broad. Make a good broth with the head, tail, skin, bones, &c., assisted by a couple of onions, and savoury pot-herbs, black pepper and salt. Boil separately four or five large sweet onions till they yield to the pressure of the spoon; take them out of the water, and slice them up. The broth being ready, choose a roomy stew-pan, sprinkle over the bottom of it a fair sup- ply of salt, black pepper, and a little powdered ginger, and over this place a layer of the onion slices ; upon this bed put the fillets, dust them with pepper and salt, and cover them with the remaining slices of onions; pour in the broth, to which should now be added a wine-glass of vinegar, and a tea-spoonful of sugar, and close the stew-pan securely ; set it upon a moderate fire, and simmer gently until the fillets are cooked ; when this point is nearly at hand, beat up the yolks of four eggs, carefully freed from the whites, with a little of the broth from the stew-pan, cooling it slightly

178 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. maturely (when the size of a cluck’s egg) boiled, and serv- ed as described already for vegetable marrows, are exceed- ingly nice. Purees of sweet potatoes, and yams, if assisted by cream, are very eatable. Fritters of the former are nice if the cooked slices be marinaded in a little brandy and lime juice, and then dipped in a well-made batter, and fried. Yams may be treated in most of the ways recommended for pota- toes. In short, if we look about us, and try our best to make the most of the vegetables of the country by careful cookery of the reformed school, we need never be without a plea- sant dish to relieve the ding-dong monotony of our market supplies. The more you hunt about amongst the produce of the native gardens, the more surprized you will be at the opportunities afforded you of practising your culinary ingenuity. For over a century we have been contented to see a few country vegetables sent up in curries, and in cur- ries only, never attempting to develop their latent good qualities by artistic treatment. There are times when the supply of vegetables grown from English seed may fail us, or when we cannot expect to procure them; when on the line of march, for instance, out in the jungles, or when quartered at some little place far from the busy haunts of our fellow white men ; the amateur who has studied native vegetables will then dis- cover that his time has not been thrown away. N.B.—Bear in mind that the water in which all vegeta- bles are boiled, excepting the cabbage tribe only, is valuable and ought not to be thrown away. This can de la caisson is a weak broth and forms an excellent basis for sauces to accompany vegetables, etc.

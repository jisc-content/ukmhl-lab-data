Pried sole a la Col- bert. side of the sole, from and up to within an inch of the head and tail; slip a knife under the flesh on each side of the cut, and loosen it from the bones ; then egg and bread- crumb the fish with finely sifted crumbs, and fry it in plenty of fat, with the side bearing the incision uppermost. The edges of this will curl outwards in the process of fry- ing, and the opening thus made should be filled at the time of serving with plenty of maitre d’hdtel butter, the sole being sprinkled with fine salt. While the fish is being drained in front of the fire, the back-bone may be removed carefully, but this is not essential. 3. —After draining the rolled rib meat mentioned in No. 1, and letting it get cold, place it on a dish that will stand the oven, brush it over with egg, and dredge over it a coating of very finely grated dry cheese, and bread-crumbs, in equal proportions : set it in the oven to heat thoroughly, and brown the outside of the crumbs with a hot iron used salamander fashion. When ready, put the meat on a dish and trim round it a circle of hot maccaroni freshly boiled, drained, and tossed in melted butter : over which pour a breakfast-cupful of rich tomato -puree, with two table-spoon- fuls of grated Parmesan or Gray ere, and serve. If you are careful not to overdo the boiling of the meat as previously noted, you will find this dish,-—all details being carefully carried out,-—a very eatable one. A nice thick brown gravy made with butter, flour, and some of the bouillon, flavour- ed with a spoonful of marsala and a tea-spoonful red currant jelly, should go round in a boat. This is also a nice way of serving a fowl. The broth being thickened d lapou- lette for sauce, and the vegetables worked through the sieve d la puree. 4. —See that the birds are roasted, and served on crisp Roast snipe. toast, well buttered, immediately.

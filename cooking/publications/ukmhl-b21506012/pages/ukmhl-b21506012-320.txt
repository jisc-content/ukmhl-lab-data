308 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. one of poppy-seed, a tea-spoonful of Nepaul pepper, one of sugar, one of salt, and one of grated green ginger. Pound all these with sufficient good salad oil to make a paste. Also pound twelve sweet almonds, and one ounce of cocoanut, with a little lime juice to assist the operation. Then mix the two pastes, and stir into them a salt-spoon- ful of cinnamon or clove-powder. A heaped-up table-spoon- ful of this paste to one of the stock powder will produce a very excellent result. Additional heat can be obtained by those who like very hot curries if red chilli powder be added to the above ingredients according to taste. This paste will keep for a few days if put away carefully in a jar and corked down. Having satisfied ourselves as to the composition of our powder and paste, we may now work out, step by step, the process to be followed in'cooking a chicken curry. Choose a nice young chicken—and here let me point out that large chickens nearly full grown ought never to be used in curries—and having cut it up neatly as for a fricas- see, place the pieces aside, and dredge over them a little flour.

When ready, strain the contents of the sauce-pan into a bowl, and skim it clean. A good breakfast-cupful of weak stock should thus be obtained. Lastly, make a breakfast-cupful of milk of cocoanut, or almond, as already described. Now take your stew-pan, and having sliced up six good shallots, or two small white onions, cast the rings into it, with two ounces of Denmark, Normandy, or other good tinned butter ; add a finely-minced clove of garlic, and fry

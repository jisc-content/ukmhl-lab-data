CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. . 272 teaching Kamaskmy is capable of achieving very fair results with it. Now, I think that it would he a mere waste of time to jot down a great number of recipes for pastry. The ordi- nary domestic cookery book generally contains a dozen or more of them which tend, I think, to confuse rather than to instruct the student. In endeavouring to improve our native cooks, we should certainly cast aside all complica- tion, and reduce our instruction to the simplest formulae.

As I said at page 77, that in Madras the chief difficulty the pastry-maker has to contend against is the high temperature : a jugful of iced water poured slowly over the surface of the slab (since marble retains cold far

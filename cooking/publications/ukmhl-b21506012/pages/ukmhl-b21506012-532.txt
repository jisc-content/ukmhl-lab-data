Babbit, or game, may be advantageously cooked in this way in little china cases: petits souffles clc gibier make an excellent second course dish. A wreath of fresh parsley round the bottom of the napkin gives a neat finish to the plat. Choose as many china ramaquin cases, or small dariole moulds, as you have guests ; butter them, and place them on one side. Make a good rich custard, abstaining from sugar, and using a few drops of anchovy sauce, with a savoury seasoning of salt and pepper instead. Empty a tin of salmon ; choose a nice piece for each mould; place the pieces in a colander, and with cold water remove all oily liquid from them ; dry with a clean cloth, and then put them into the moulds, pouring the custard round them. Now steam the moulds, and when set, turn out the boudins carefully. Send round hot, with Hollandaise sauce, or very cold with mayonnaise. Choose plain biscuits, not sweetened, empty some butter in a small frying-pan, lay the biscuits upon it, turning them over the fire, till the butter browns, pepper with grill seasoning (page 510). Put them on a very hot dish, and pour the browned butter over them, and serve. Or if liked very dry, lay them on a griddle rest, and set them in the oven for a minute or two, serving as hot as possible. Biscuit d VIndienne is prepared as the foregoing, but curry powder is dusted over it instead of the plain season- ing of pepper and salt. â™¦ Boudins de saumon. Devilled Biscuit.

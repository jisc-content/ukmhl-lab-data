51 THICK SOUPS AND PUREES. green purie that you desired, presented the appearance of a thin gravy soup, with a deposit of the vegetable pulp at the bottom of each basin—the stock and the pulp not having amalgamated? This result was caused by the omission of one of the processes I have described which is necessary to blend the two together. In French recipes for vegetable purees a thickening of pure butter, cream, or egg-yolks with milk, is often laid down, as explained in the case of Dotage d la bonne, femme, but these liaisons are as a rule too ‘ rich ’ for many people, besides being too expensive. Grecy soup should be served with bread cut into dice and fried in butter; or crisped on a buttered tin in the oven after having been soaked in a little of the stock. CroiLtons, treated in this way, should accompany all vegetablepur&es. Purees of celery, Jerusalem artichokes, (Palestine soup), vegetable marrow, onion, and turnips, if the stock be kept free from colour, can be served as white soups, and cream, or the substitute already described, will lie found an im- provement to all of them. All green vegetable purees derive enrichment in ap- pearance by the judicious addition of “ spinach-greening ” which is, in itself, the liquor obtained from spinach boiled, drained, worked through the sieve, and then squeezed through a piece of muslin. I have seen people quite de- ceived with a soup made with dried peas and coloured with “ spinach-greening ” in imitation oi pur 6c clepois verts. A pinch of sugar ought not to be forgotten in making these soups. The enterprising cultivators of asparagus at Madras ought now and then to indulge their guests with that excellent soup “ puree d’asperges,” which however ranks next, I take it, to the still more artistic “consomme aux pointes d’asperges. ’'

195 THE SAVOURY OMELETTE. As I said before, omelettes may be varied in many ways. If “ aux fines herbes," curly parsley and shallot are neces- sary ; minced marjoram or thyme, garden-cress (the com- panion, I mean, of mustard) or celery leaves, are agreeable, and many are fond of a spoonful of finely chopped green chilli, omitting the seeds of course. Chopped ham, chopped tongue, chopped bacon, and chop- ped corned beef, are added to omelettes with good effect. The words “ aiijambon,” “ au larcl,” “ au langue de bceuf,” (He., specify the addition. I have found it better to fry the minced ham, &c., independently, keeping it handy for ad- dition to the omelette during the rolling over stage, as it goes into the dish. Cold cooked vegetables, cut up and tossed a while in melt- ed butter separately, may be thus added with success. I recommend sprigs of the flower of the cauliflower, artichoke bottoms cut into dice, or Jerusalem artichokes sliced, and cut up. Peas, the grains of Indian corn, chopped French beans, or the seeds of the bandecai or moringa pod are thus very pleasantly treated. In the case of an "omelette aux Ugumes,” a dust of grated cheese gives a pleasing finishing touch when the ovielette reposes in the hot dish. “ Ovielette aux tomates” :—Cut three or four ripe tomatoes into pieces. Cut a sweet onion into the thinnest slices pos- sible. Melt a table-sjDoonful of butter in a small sauce-pan, cast into it the onion slices ; let them cook without brown- ing ; then add the pieces of tomato, pepper and salt; stir the sauce-pan carefully till the tomatoes are cooked which will be in about ten minutes. Keep the mixture hot, and pour it over the surface of an ordinary omelette just as you are on the point of turning it out of the frying-pan. The omelette will roll over of its own accord, enveloping the tomatoes within it as it passes into the dish. The “ omelette au Parmesan” (or any mild dry cheese) is a

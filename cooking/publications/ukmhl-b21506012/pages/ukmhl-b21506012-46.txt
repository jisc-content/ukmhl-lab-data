CULINARY JOTTINGS NON MADRAS. 34 finely minced raw beef free from fat, put it on the fire again, stirring well till it boils, remove tbe pot from the fire, let the broth settle, and then pour it off gently into the bowl, taking great care not to disturb tbe sedi- ment. Perhaps, however, you may not have saved a bit of meat for this contingency, so you must attain your object with the white of an egg, thus :—Break an egg, and throw the white and the shell together into a slop basin,—be careful not to let an atom of the yolk go in,—beat the white and shell up to a stiff froth, and mix it, Hake by flake, very completely with the cool soup.

You have got your stock as bright and clear as sherry, but after adding the ingredients just men- tioned “ a change comes over the spirit of your dream,”— the soup turns cloudy.

There is another feature in a clear soup which I have reserved for special attention, and that is the colouring. Now, an idea prevails amongst numbers of English people that a soup to be good and strong must be dark-coloured. • Old-fashioned people speak of your modern consomme as a

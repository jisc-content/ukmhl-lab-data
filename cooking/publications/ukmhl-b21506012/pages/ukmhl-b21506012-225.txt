213 FRITTERS. few spoonfuls of well made white sauce, add a little season- ing, with the yolk of an egg when off the fire, and set it to get cool, and firm. In like manner, tinned lobster, tinned oysters, and any tinned fish, can thus be successfully treated. In using them, however, it is necessary to wash, and drain them from the liquid of the tin. The sauce should be made very carefully, so that it may freshen up the fish as much as possible. “ Angels on horseback ”—i.e.:—oysters plainly dipped in the batter I have given you, and fried secundum artem, are perhaps as dainty morsels as can be presented to the jaded appetite of an Anglo-Indian. Drain the oysters from their liquor in the tin, wipe them, and set them, en mari- nade all the day in a soup plate, with the juice of three limes, an onion sliced, some whole peppers, and a few clovs; turn them occasionally till they are wanted for the friture- pan. Oyster fritters thus treated, form an excellent garnish, and may be served with boiled or fried fish, or a dish of .filets de bceuf. Here is a super-excellent idea of the “ G. C.’s” :—Split each oyster open, almost as wide, comparatively speaking, as you do a kidney, and insert therein a little of the fol- lowing composition :—toss on the fire in butter, with pepper, salt, and a spoonful of rich brown sauce, a dessert- spoonful each of minced mushroom, shallot, and truffle ; thicken this with the yolks of two eggs, give it the juice of a lime, and let it get cold. After putting a small allow- ance of this in each oyster, shut the sides together, dip it in the batter, and fry immediately. This would be practi- cable with the Bombay oyster. I have already indicated the vegetables which make good fritters, and here repeat my high opinion of that method of treating them.

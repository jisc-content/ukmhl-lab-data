SAUCES. 91 Equal portions of boiled carrot, French beans, turnip or knolkhol, cut into small dice, with a few peas, asparagus points, and green haricot beans, when gently heated in sauce blonde, form that charming assistance to a dish of grilled cutlets, or any plain entree, called macedoine de legumes. Be careful not to mash the vegetables, so do not overboil them in the first instance.* Sauce Milanaise is a delicious variation of sauce Soubise. Cut up two parboiled Bombay onions, and put them into • a sauce-pan with an ounce of butter, a pinch of sugar, and a salt-spoonful of salt; add a table-spoonful of previously boiled rice, or pearl barley, and moisten with a breakfast- cupful of broth ; let them cook slowly, and when the onions are done, add a table-spoonful of finely grated mild cheese (Parmesan for choice), stir the mixture, pass it through a sieve, and mingle it with half a pint of thin sauce blonde. A spoonful of cream may obviously be added if approved. Bread-Sauce. Of the whole category of simple sauces none is more generally maltreated, I think, than “bread-sauce.” Deli- cious we know when properly made, it is positively a repulsive mess when wrongly treated.

The system pursued by the ignorant cook may be thus * Any four of these vegetables are enough for a macedoine.—W.

294 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. glass of Madeira or any sound white wine may be mingled with the gravy, the pie dish should he rubbed with a shal- lot before it is packed, finely chopped parsley should he sprinkled over the bottom of the dish before the beef collops are arranged upon it, and the pigeons’ livers with bacon rolled round them should he arranged on the sur- face. I have also found that mutton collops may be used with almost as good an effect as those of beef. I used the meat ol' the blade-bone of a shoulder, cut into neat pieces ; these should be rolled with a slice of bacon inside them as di- rected for beef. 6. “Snipe Pie.”—When snipe are plentiful, as they often are in India, the cook ought to remember this delicacy. Supposing eight birds to be available, I would work in this way:—I would prepare six of them, as if for roasting, for the pie; and two I would sacrifice for the gravy, which ought to be very first rate. For this purpose two sheep’s feet and two pounds of gravy meat must be obtained, besides about a couple of pounds of the undercut, or tender ribmeat, for the pie. Having made as good a gravy as pos- sible, I would throw into it the two snipe, and pi'oceed to make a little puree (as explained in Menu No. 16) pound- ing the trails and meat of the birds, after they have been slowly simmered in the gravy, to a paste, and blending it with the gravy secundum artem. After rubbing the pie- dish with a shallot, I would fill up the bottom of it with little collops of the tender beef rolled with strips of bacon, “spiced pepper” being dusted over each layer until all the beef has been used. I would lay the six snipe on the sur- face of the beef with slices of lean bacon, ham, tongue, or Bologna sausage, between each bird, garnish as usual, bap- tize the pie with the puree, saying some of it for the final process previously described, cover it with a nice light paste, and bake.

MENU FOB A DIN NEB OF SIX. 472 Chocolate souffle ^eâ€™ an<^ Srate ^ into half apint of milk, add a few drops of vanilla essence, and boil the milk so that the chocolate may become thoroughly dissolved: when this has been done, the flavoured milk should be thickened with two tea-spoonfuls of potato flour, or well dried imported flour, then strained, and set to get cold. The yolks of four eggs and a glass of liqueur should then be beaten up with the cold batter, the whites of six eggs being added in the shape of a stiff froth just before baking. A proper souffle case or tin should be used to ensure success. Gateau Napolitain. Take of powdered lump sugar the weight of twelve eggs in their shells, and take half that weight of potato flour; separate the whites from the yolks of the eggs, beat up the latter with the sugar, adding a few drops of essence of lemon. Whisk the whites to a stiff froth, mix the two together, and incorporate with the mixture, quickly and effectually, the potato flour, beating it all the time with the egg whisk. Pour into a plain mould, buttered. Bake in a quick oven until done. When cold, cut the cake in hori- zontal slices half an inch thick. Spread half the slices of cake with apricot jam, and half with chocolate icing. Ar- range the slices one over the other, so as to form the cake again. Trim the slices neatly, and ice the cake com- pletely over with chocolate icing. This must be done quickly, and the icing should be kept hot, for it soon sets. Ornament the cake with any bonbons or sweet-meats, which must be put on before the icing has time to cool. .'B

516 MENU FOE A LITTLE HOME DINNER. Haggis. This most savory composition ought strictly speaking to be cooked in the paunch of a sheep well cleaned to receive it, but as this is a troublesome operation, it will be found just as satisfactory to use a jar the top of which can be hermetically sealed with paste. Take the tongue, heart, kidneys, and liver, of a freshly killed sheep: those of a lamb for choice. Weigh them, and prepare half of the weight of fat bacon, a quarter pint of well-dried oatmeal, two large onions parboiled and shredded, two tea-spoonfuls of salt, half a nutmeg grated, and one tea-spoonful of black pepper. Boil the liver, then chop it up reserving half as mince and pounding the rest to paste : this must be passed through the sieve. Parboil the heart, kidneys, and tongue, then chop them up; also chop the bacon into small dice; now mix the oatmeal with the chopped meats, adding the onion, and seasoning. Put all into a jar, moistening with a pint of strong gravy in which the liver paste should be mixed, and the juice of a lime. Steam, or bake in the oven for three hours, and serve. This is delicious as a rechauffe if it be served, baked hot, in silver coquilles.

I have heard a good many people speak in high praise of the pastry that they have eaten at certain liostelries on the Neilgherrie^ and express wonder that similarly excellent feuilletage is never placed before them here. Climate has a great deal to say to this, and without wishing to depreciate the talent of the Coonoor or Ooty pdtissiers, we must remember the advantages that they enjoy in the matter of tempera- ture. The next golden rule is that which enjoins scrupulous cleanliness. Everything connected with this department must be as bright and clean as possible. A third law, which I think our cooks rarely obey, is the one that demands the careful weighing of ingredients. Ramasamy converses about “cups” of butter and “table- spoonful” of flour. I do not think that he is nearly par- ticular enough with regard to the accurate weight of the things he uses. Carelessness in this matter must obviously be the precursor of failure.

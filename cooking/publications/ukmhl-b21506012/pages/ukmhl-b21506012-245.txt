Potted snipe, hare, partridges, &c., are excellent Don’t forget the livers when you are potting birds, and'turn back to page 75 for my recipe for “foie gras forcemeat,” a little of which will encourage your game pate exceedingly. If you happen to have any spare remnants olfoie gras handy, slip them into the potted meat, and no man will blame you. “Mock-crab” is the name given to a very good hors (Voeuvre in which cheese plays a prominent part; it is made in this way:—a quarter of a pound of prawn meat, two ounces of good fresh cheese, a tea-spoonful of mustard powder, a dessert-spoonful of salad oil, a dessert-spoonful of “anchovy vinegar,” and a liberal dusting of spiced pep- per. Pound everything (omitting the prawns) and work the mixture till it looks like a very thick mayonnaise sauce adding oil if necessary to obtain that result: when ready, mingle it with the prawn meat, pounded, &c., as in the former receipt, and trim it into a shapely little mould for serving. Even without any prawn meat a very good mock- crab can be made : a table-spoonful of anchovy sauce sup- plies the fishy flavour. Butter can, of course, be used instead of oil. “Pulled bread” accompanies the cheese in the place of biscuits. You can make it easily enough, if you bake at home, as follows:—-Make a pound loaf, and when the bread is all but done, take it from the oven, tear the crumb from the inside with a fork in irregular pieces, place them on a buttered baking tin and crisp them in the oven.

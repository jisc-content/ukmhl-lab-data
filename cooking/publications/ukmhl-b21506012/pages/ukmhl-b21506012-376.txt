364 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. contents of the pan should be poured into a bowl to cool, and when cold, pounded to a paste, and mixed with the stuff- ing. The hack of the hare should he larded, or covered with thin slices of bacon pinned down with little skewers; it should then be wrapped in oiled paper, and roasted, a con- stant basting of melted butter or clarified beef suet, with vinegar and water in equal parts, being kept up throughout the process. When nearly done, the bacon strips should be removed, and the back lightly dredged with flour ; the skin should be allowed to brown, and run into crisp blisters : the hare should then be served,—with a sauce made as follows :— First make a good pint of the best gravy you can : cut the liver into dice, take a small sauce-pan, melt an ounce of butter in it, throw into it an onion finely shreded, toss the onion till it colours nicely, then throw in the chopped liver, shaking the pan for a minute or two: next add a little gravy, stir well, pour in all the gravy and simmer till the liver is cooked. Now, strain the gravy, and pour into it through a strainer the marinade of port wine, vine- gar, ketchup, and red currant jelly in which the hare was soaked, put it on the fire in a sauce-pan, boil up and pro- ceed to thicken as follows :— Bemove the sauce-pan from the fire, let the gravy therein cool for two minutes ; take part of it, and stir into it sepa- rately in a cup the blood you saved in the first instance ; mix well, and add this and the liver to the gravy in the sauce-pan, which should now be replaced on the fire, and brought almost to the boil, when it will be ready. It is a good plan—especially in the case of a large N ilgiri have—to remove the head, neck and shoulders, and hind legs, reserving those parts for soup or stew, and using the back and loins for roasting only. In this case the part to he roasted should be put into marinade, and the stuffing and larding conducted exactly as in the preceding recipe. If

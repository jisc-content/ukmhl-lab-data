Take out the onions, chop them up, and return them to the stew- pan with a small piece of butter rolled in flour, add the pieces of rabbit, a tumblerful more or less of milk, and a little grated nutmeg. Let the whole simmer very slowly for an hour, and just before serving add a piece of fresh butter the size of a walnut. Whichever plan you adopt remember that there should be no stint in regard to the onions. The pieces of rabbit should actually be bountifully smothered. The French homely dish of rabbit is the gibclotte, a kind of fricassee. Take a quarter of a pound of leanish bacon, cut it into dice, and fry them with half an ounce of butter in a stew-pan till colored. Now take out the bacon, and put in the pieces of rabbit, let them fry in the butter and bacon fat for six minutes, then return the bits of bacon, dredge half an ounce of flour over the rabbit, cover the pieces with broth and a glass of marsala, season with pepper, salt and sweet herbs, and simmer steadily till the rabbit is cooked. Serve it within a circle of small glazed onions. If mushrooms can be got, put into the stew, say a dozen buttons, when the simmering commences. With wild fowl—duck and teal especially—alike in camp and cantonment, the Anglo-Indian table is generally well supplied during the winter season.

RECHA UFFES. 187 golden brown. These served with a macedoine de legumes, sauce soubise, horse radish sauce, tomato, or tartare, are de- licious ; but the meat must be really juicy, or, in plainer terms, must have been slightly underdone in the first in- stance. Apropos of batter, I must not forget to say, that pou/nded fish, incorporated with batter, that is to say, worked into it, and fried in seething fat hy dropping the mixture into the pan by spoonfuls at a time, produces a dish of flitters most welcome at breakfast alone, or capital as a garnish for a larger dish of fish. A remarkably nice little dish, also contrived with batter, is the crepe de poisson, or indeed of anything. The crepe is a pancake. Picture to yourself a nicely-made thin pan- cake :—spread it out upon a flat dish, and cut it into pieces two inches wide, and three inches long. Upon the sur- face of each piece, place a very thin slice of bacon slightly smaller each way than the crepe, over the bacon put a table- spoonful of any nice mince, well worked with an egg or two, and a little cold sauce to give it moisture and cohe- sion : then roll up your crepes, put them on a buttered tin, brush them with a whipped egg, bread-crumb them, and bake brown in the oven. Cold cooked vegetables, such as cauliflowers, cabbage, Jerusalem artichokes, and vegetable marrows, may be mash - ed up with potatoes, or alone, diluted with melted butter, cream, or milk with the yolk of an egg strained into it, dusted over with grated cheese, and cooked au grcctin. Mixed vegetables may be cut into dice and warmed up in white sauce cl la macedoine de legumes, and cold peas, cauli- flower, French beans, and cabbage, may be tossed in butter in a frying-pan, and served d la maitre d’hotel. You wil find a good many recipes for the treatment of cooked vege- tables in the chapters I have devoted to that especial sub- ject.

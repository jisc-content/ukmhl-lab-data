540 OUR KITCHENS IN INDIA. things which we consider to be as inevitable as it is dis- gusting. But stop a moment—is it inevitable ? Let us consider that point. The fans et oriejo viali, it seems to me, are to be detected without difficulty. Think, first of all, of the distances which as a rule separate our kitchens from our houses, and the fact that the room is part and parcel of a block of godowns—not infrequently within easy access of the stables. Setting aside other considerations for a mo- ment, do we not at once perceive here two grave evils:— in the first place that proper supervision of the kitchen is almost out of the question ; and, in the second, that pro- miscuous gatherings of outsiders,—the friends, relations, and children (a fruitful source of dirtiness) of our servants —can take place in it undetected ? Again : the room is generally constructed with as little ventilation and light as possible, its position with regard to the sun is never thought of, and arrangements for its proper drainage are rare. As there is no scullery, or place of washing up, &c., the ground in the immediate vicinity of the kitchen re- ceives the foul liquid (as well as all refused matter) which is carelessly thrown out upon it. The consequence is that hard by many a cook-room in this Presidency, there is a noisome cesspool containing an inky looking fluid, the ex- halations from which can scarcely improve the more deli- cate articles of food which are sent from the house for preparation.

There is no chimney, you see, so the wall up which the smoke is creeping towards an opening in the roof, is lined by an ancient coating of soot. Observe the mass of patriarchal looking cobwebs depending from the

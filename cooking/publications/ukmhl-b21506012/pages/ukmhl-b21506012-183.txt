171 OUR VEGETABLES. ful of dried thyme or marjoram, a dozen pepper corns, a tea- spoonful of sugar and one of salt, and stir well over a brisk fire till the fat melts well, and the vegetables begin to fry in it. Do not let them brown, but pour in before that stage arrives enough warm water to cover them completely. N ow draw the pan to the edge of the fire, and cook very gently, carefully stirring the contents of your pan to prevent them catching. When the vegetables, &c., have been well cook- ed, strain off the liquid, put it in a clean sauce-pan, and boil until it has diminished to about a quarter of its ori- ginal-quantity, then strain it off into a bowl. When re- quired, this vegetable essence should be carefully skimmed, poured into a sauce-pan, and sufficient water should be added to cook the celery or other vegetable that may lie put into it. Celery stewed in blanc can be served advantageously a lamoelle, i.e., with beef marrow. In this case you must thicken the blanc in. which it was cooked, and color it with caramel. The marrow should be treated in this way :â€”Break the bone, take out the raw marrow, cut it into dice, blanch them for five minutes in scalding water, drain them, and heat them up gently in a little of the saucer?; bain-marie. A dessert-spoonful each of this should lie put into little croustades of fried bread, and served round the celery as a garnish. Cut your croustades square, out of stale bread, and hollow a little space in each to hold the marrow ; or make little pastry cases, in small patty pans, and fill them with the marrow. Pile the celery in the centre of the dish, pour the remainder of the sauce over it, and serve, with the croustades in a circle round it, very hot. Cardoons, (carrions) a la moellc are of course well known by those who have travelled abroad. I have seen tinned cardoons in India, but not the vegetable itself. According to M.

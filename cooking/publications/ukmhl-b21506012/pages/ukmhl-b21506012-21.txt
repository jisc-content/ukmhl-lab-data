THE MENU. 9 with its plain dressing of oil and vinegar (not a thick eggy one, I heg) should accompany the r6t as a matter of course. If unable to follow the rules of the revised menu accurate- ly, owing to an indifferent market, or some other unavoid- able reason, the wise dinner-giver should fall back upon the older form, and be contented with a less pretentious festival.

148 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 4. “ Au lard,”—the same method, using bacon instead of ham. The bacon atoms should be nice and crisp. 5. The “pur&e,” previously described. French beans (haricots verts), are well worthy of our attention, for we can get them when other vegetables are out of season. They are, besides, the correct accompani- ment of the roast saddle, the roast loin, and, of course, of venison. Now, there is a very common and very grievous mistake, which cooks—in India especially—are prone to make. They slice the pods of this bean into thin strips. By doing this, nearly all the flavour of the bean is lost. The pods, which must he gathered young, should he simply peeled all round to get rid of the delicate fibre, their ends should he nipped off, and they should then be plunged into boiling water :—a pinch of soda will preserve their bright green tint, and at least a tea-spoonful of salt and one of sugar should be m ixed with the water. If quite young, there will be no fibre to remove. To preserve the green tint, the following plan is also re- commended :—Put a large spoonful of wood ashes in a piece of linen, fold it up, and place it in a strainer, pouring the boiling water in which the beans are to be cooked over it. This plan is equally efficacious with globe artichokes, cab- bages, &c. (Audot.) I have however found that French beans grown in India lose so much of their flavour by being boiled that I have adopted steaming them in an ordinary vegetable steamer. The pods may be cut across into lengths of an inch and a half to facilitate operations. Be sure that the beans are quite young, or they will be tough. As soon as the fibre round the pods becomes stringy, they are too old.

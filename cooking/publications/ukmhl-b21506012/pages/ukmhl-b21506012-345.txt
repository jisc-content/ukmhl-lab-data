333 CAMP COOKERY. and pound loaf tin, and a cake tin : these various things are not expensive ; they should be kept in the house (when in cantonment) away from the cook-room, as clean as possible, and be scrupulously reserved for their own pur- poses. Having provided yourself with this equipment, you should use Yeatman’s baking powder, the best import- ed or locally made flour you can get, oatmeal occasionally, salt, and either good butter made at home, or that of any well-known brand preserved in tin. Here is a reliable receipt for eight nice breakfast or dinner rolls one and a half ounce each :— eight ounces or one large breakfast-cupful of flour; one tea-spoonful of good butter ; two tea-spoonfuls of Yeatman’s powder ; one salt-spoonful of salt; nine table-spoonfuls of milk for imported, eight for Indian, flour. Bub the butter into the flour with one of the wooden spoons after having spread the latter with the baking pow- der in the enamelled pan, and sprinkled the salt over it; now mix your dough as lightly as you can, using both wooden spoons, and shaking the milk into the flour by degrees. When nicely formed, divide it into eight equal portions, pat them into shape with the spoons, and place them in eight patty-pans well buttered. These must be put on the baking-sheet, and slipped into the oven, which should have been heated to receive them to such a degree that you can hardly bear your hand inside it. The time taken in baking depends upon the sort of oven you employ : as soon as the rolls brown very slightly, having risen into nice round forms, they are ready. This recipe may be altered to five ounces of flour, and three of oatmeal, for a change. French Bolls :—Half a pound of flour, a dessei’t-spoon- ful of butter, one small egg, two tea-spoonfuls of Yeat-

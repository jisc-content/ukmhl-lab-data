119 BUAISING AND BOASTING. ed bird. I leave these expensive compositions alone, for receipts can be easily hunted up for them when a special occasion may demand a “ dindon truffe d la Perigord,” or a “ dinde braisee d lafinanoiere,” dc., dc.

Much depends upon the fine mincing of all the ingre- dients, and their thorough incorporation : the suet should be chopped as finely as possible. The eggs cause cohesion

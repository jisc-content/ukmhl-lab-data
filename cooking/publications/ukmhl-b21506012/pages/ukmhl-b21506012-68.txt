CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 56 rently the whole repertoire of sauces within the reach of the local chef. -N.fi.—I have never been able by the way to trace the origin of the Madras custom of serving a portion of salad with a thick eggy dressing on the same plate as the slice of hot fish.

It may be urged that your fish is brought home from market too late in the evening for the successful accom- plishment of studied effects, and perhaps your butler will

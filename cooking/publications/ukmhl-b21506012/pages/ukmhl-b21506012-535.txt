MENU FOR A LITTLE HOME DINNER. 523 it, now pour gently round the layer a cupful of strong gravy made from the coarser meat previously mentioned ; repeat the process adding another layer of rolled beef slices, and more gravy, till the dish is packed; garnish the sur- face with pieces of hard-boiled egg, and cover the whole with a good light crust, bake in the usual way and serve. Oysters, minced anchovies, chopped olives, and mushrooms may, of course, be mingled with the layers ; and a glass of marsala may enrich the gravy if you desire perfection.

Put this into a small circular souffle tin, and bake it in a moderate oven, send it to table the moment it is ready, dusted over with finely sifted sugar. A little preserve may accompany the omelette souffle, and a few drops of any liqueur will be found an agreeable addi- tion. The great thing is, to serve immediately : you can- not therefore bake the souffle in a distant kitchen; the baking should be conducted as close to the dining-room door as possible, and the dish should be brought in the Woodcock toasts.

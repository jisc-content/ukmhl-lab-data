10:3 SA XJCES—CONCL UDED. saying this I speak from experience. I first read Gouffb before I had taken to practical cooking work, and before I had actually made sauces, &c., ladle in hand, in an English kitchen. Since going through that ordeal, I have again come across the book, and I find that much that I had for- merly to skip as too complicated, now seems easy enough. I propose now to place before you, in the simplest man- ner I can, Gouffe’s fundamental sauces. Those who may be acquainted with that author, will observe that in the first place I shall reduce the recipes to a much shorter compass, and in the next, that I shall omit everything that is not down-right necessary to produce a fair result. Gouffe propounds the following sauces as the founda- tion of nearly all those of a high class that you are likely to encounter:— 1. Espagnole. 2. Veloute. 3. Allemande. 4. Bechamel. 5. Marinade. 6. Poivrade. Of these veloute, aliemande, and b&chamel are so closely allied, that I shall confine myself to the last. Marinade and ■poivrade I have already alluded to. Espagnole is, of course, worthy of close attention. My fundamental sauces will therefore he reduced to two:—one brown, and the other white,—and these I think will lie found ample for the Indian kitchen. Veal stock plays an important part in Gouffe’s recipes. Unfortunately for us we can never reckon on obtaining that delicate meat. Nevertheless, while freely admitting its value, I do not look upon veal as a sine pud non in sauce-making. A really carefully made chicken consomme, assisted by a ham or bacon bone, provides you with an excellent equivalent. On special occasions it would be quite worth while to sacrifice a good fowl for this purpose with a little lean ham or bacon.

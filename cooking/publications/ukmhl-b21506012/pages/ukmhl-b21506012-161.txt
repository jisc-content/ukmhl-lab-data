149 OUR VEGETABLES. Having cooked the beans to your satisfaction, you can serve them in the following excellent methods, and always secure a nice entremets with them if you like :— 1 “ Aux fines herbes.”-—Turn them out into a hot dish, melt a lump of butter in a little sauce-pan with some finely- chopped parsley, some common garden cress, some finely- minced shallot if approved, some pepper, and a pinch of grated nutmeg,-—pour over the beans, and serve. 2. “ Ausauce blanche. ’ ’—Make a sauce blanche with flour and melted flutter, some of the water in which the beans wei'e cooked, salt, pepper, and a little nutmeg ; stir into this the yolk of a raw egg, or a spoonful of cream, give it two or three drops of lime-juice, and add as above. 3. “ Au sauce au fcoinage."—Make a sauce blanche as above, enrich it with the yolks of two eggs and a little milk or cream, dredge into it a table-spoonful of mild grated cheese, and pour it over the beans piping hot. 4. “ Au larcl."—Mince some fat bacon with a little shal- lot, and work them awhile in the sauce-pan : add the boil- ed French beans, toss them about for a minute or two, and serve. 5. “ A la creme.”—Pour a coffee-cupful of boiling cream over the beans. 6. “ A la maitre d’hotcl."—Stir a table-spoonful of meutre d’hotel butter into them when piping hot. A well-made tomato sauce, suubise sauce, or a rich vcloute, are all applicable to French beans : and a poulette made of butter, a little flour, and some of the water in which the beans were cooked, thickened with yolks of eggs, and sea- soned with salt, assists them greatly. French beans, cold, make a capital salad: I must, how- ever, reserve that form of serving them for discussion else- where.

228 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. divers canap&s, using lax, caviare, sardines, fish-roe, green butter, strips of green capsicum, or of cucumber, and gar- nishing with tongue or ham cut tastefully with a cutter, grated ham, or powdered hard-boiled yolk of egg. In making canapes, for service before dinner, care should be taken to keep them small. The dimensions I have given should not be exceeded and the bread should be stale and cut thin. An excellent plan is to cut the slices of bread (with a pastry cutter) the size of a five-shilling piece, to butter them, and arrange tastefully thereon the composition you have decided upon, covering each with powdered egg or ham. Very elaborate canapes are propounded by a certain school of cookery in London. These are designed in variegated patterns, rings, or quarterings, with colored ingredients upon circular, oval, or rectangular pieces of bread; black being provided by truffle, greenish grey with caviare, green by green butter, scarlet by coraline, yellow and orange with yolks, and white with the whites of eggs. To my mind these triumphs of fiddling are not worth the time and trouble they cost, they certainly suggest fingering, and the combi- nation of several flavours is contrary to the canons of scien- tific taste. The anteprandial bonne bouche cannot be too simple. A couple of savoury morsels which harmonize well with each other, arranged neatly, and garnished tastefully, offer what is wanted at this period of the dinner, and are surely more inviting than curious, and unknown mixtures, all pretty coloring notwithstanding. In selecting your hors d’oeuvres to accompany the cheese try to avoid giving two fishy things on the same dish, thus : —do not give anchovies, and prawn butter together, or olives farqies and caviare; but take, let us say, anchovy butter, devilled ham, and oat biscuit, or cream cheese, olives farqies, and wafer biscuit. Here are a few combinations :— Anchovy fillets, water-cress-butter, dry toast.

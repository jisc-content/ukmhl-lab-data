Replace it in the sauce-pan, thicken it with butter and a little flour, colour it with caramel, and place your six fillets in it to gently heat up without coining to the boil; when quite hot, place the fillets in their dish, pouring the sauce round them and serve, with a crisply fried curl of bacon, between each of them. Petits pois verts should fill the centre of the dish. 4.—Put eight nicely trimmed choplets of mutton into a stew-pan with some scraps of bacon, Mutton cutlets k la onion carrots, dried herbs, pepper,salt, and a pinch of grated nutmeg, with a pint of good gravy, and a glass of sherry, and gently stew the little chops till done. Now lay them out on a large dish, covered by another with a weight upon it; when quite cold, trim them finally into shape if necessary. Meanwhile strain the gravy in which they were stewed, remove all fat, and set it on one side. Now mince an onion very small, and a few capers, with two or three truffles also. Fry the onions a golden brown, add the minced capers and truffles with pep- per, salt, and a spoonful of chopped parsley, moisten with a little of the gravy, thicken it with a couple of eggs, and then put the mince away to get cold : cut some papers for your cutlets and oil or butter them : now spread your cold thick mince over your cutlets liberally, roll them, or rather fold them in their papers most carefully, and broil them on the grid-iron sufficiently long to heat them thoroughly; or if preferred, they can be just as well heated in the oven. Serve your cutlets in their papers, and let a rich sauce be handed round in a boat made of the remains of the gravy originally got from the cooking of the cutlets, slightly thickened with butter and flour, flavoured with red currant jelly, anchovy vinegar, and spoonful of sherry, all judici- ously applied. The “Maintenon cutlets” may be placed round a ring of mashed potatoes filled with celery purie.

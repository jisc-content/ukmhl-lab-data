When satisfactorily filled, put on the oval cover, cement the edges with white of egg, and pinch them to- gether firmly, brush the top over with a well-beaten egg, and bake the pie in a slow oven. While baking, you can simmer the bones and trimmings of the neck, with a couple of sheep’s feet cleaned and cut up, and make a clear yet strong broth ; this, when cold, should solidify as jelly; flavour it with pepper and salt, and after the pie has been baked, and is still hot, pour a little of it through the open- ing in the top of the cover.

Next make a forcemeat as follows :—Take the livers of the birds and

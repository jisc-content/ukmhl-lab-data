GO CULINARY .JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. fry will turn out a flabby and greasy mess instead of a crisp, appetising dish.” For nearly all fish-frying, the frying basket is an invalu- able utensil, used, of course, in conjunction with the deep- sided friture-pan. Fish either whole, or in fillets, when fried in the English fashion, is generally egged and bread-crumbed. The Italians, who are perhaps the best ‘ frysters ’ in the world, either flour their fish, or dip it in batter. Both methods are, to my mind, vastly superior to the bread-crumbing process. If, however, you must use crumbs, see that they are stale, and well sifted ; not the pithy lumps, both great and small, too often set before you, because Ramasamy will not look ahead, and rarely, if ever keeps a bottled supply of stale, well rasped bread in hand. To obtain a satisfactory result, proceed as follows :— Having crumbled some stale bread as small as you can in a napkin, set it in the oven till crisp, pound in a mortar, and pass the crumbs through a stiff wire sieve ; then place the plate containing them into the oven to dry thoroughly. To apply them properly, beat up two eggs with a dessert-spoonful of salad oil, and the same of water. This mixture should be brushed over the fish like varnish, and the fish should then be turned over in a napkin, con- t lining the dry crumbs. Pale yellowish-brown crust raspings, equally carefully sifted after pounding, should be kept in hand also for the second “ crumbing.” This should be applied after the first top dressing has dried. For flouring :—dip the fish in milk, and then turn it over in a napkin containing some well dried flour. Recipes for frying batter will be found in the chapter reserved for the discussion of that process of cookery. It ought not to be at all thick for fish frying.

MENU FOB A DINNER OF SIX. 442 thicken in the bain-marie, with the yolks of three eggs: when satisfactory, strain, cool, acid the yolks of two eggs, and put in the pieces of chicken, heating them without boiling. Cut the carrot, and French beans, with the livers you saved, into dice, and when you dish the chicken, garnish your entree with them and the button onions. A casserole of mashed potatoes, shaped like the pastry case of a vol- au-vent, and nicely ornamented, can hold the chicken, and the garnish should be sprinkled over the surface. 4.—Order a shoulder of the best mutton you can get, bone it carefully, wash it, dry it, and stuffed. flatten it out upon a clean board. Dust it over with spiced pepper and salt, and lay over it a number of thin slices of cold cooked bacon. Make a good bowl of turkey stuffing (page 119) and spread it evenly over the bacon, roll the meat carefully up, and secure it in shape with tapes. Put four ounces of butter into a stew-pan, and turn the roll of mutton over in it till it takes colour. Now pour in a pint or so of good broth made from the bones and trimmings, with two Bombay onions cut up, a clove of garlic, a carrot sliced, six pepper- corns, a blade of mace, a good piece of celery, a dessert- spoonful of sugar, a dessert-spoonful of salt, a tumbler of chablis or sauterne, and half a glass of brandy. Braise the mutton in this until it is done. Dish it on a hot dish, and brown its surface with a hot iron. Strain off the gravy, remove the fat, flavour it as for game with half a glass of Madeira, a dessert-spoonful of red currant jelly, the juice of a lime, and a few drops of chilli vinegar; let it boil up, pour it round the mutton, and serve. Garnish the dish with small white onions (the size used for pickling) glazed, and send round potatoes a la maitre d’liotel. 5.—Boast the birds properly over a bright fire (Bama- samy will bake them if he can, or fry them in a frying-pan) and serve them Roast snipe.

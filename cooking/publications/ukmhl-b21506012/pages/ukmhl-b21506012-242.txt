230 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. in view when composing a fancy butter, may be thus sum- med upa pleasant flavour, a pretty tint, and novelty. To secure the first it is imperatively necessary that the basis upon which you work be beyond suspicion. The butter you use must be the best possible. If, therefore, you cannot make it at home from cream you have set under your own eye, I strongly advise you to use that of a freshly opened “Denmark” tin.

Mince as finely as possible sufficient curled parsley to fill a table-spoon generously. 5. Mince also as finely as possible capers sufficient to fill a tea-spoon, heaped up. 6. —Having these ingredients ready, first colour the but- ter by working into it, as lightly as you can, enough of the “spinach-greening” to secure the tint your require (it

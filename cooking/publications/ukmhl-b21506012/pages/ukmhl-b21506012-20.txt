CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 8 In favour of the older English custom it has been argued, with considerable justice, that delicate works of culinary science—such as entrees are supposed to be—should be pre- sented while the palate is yet fresh, and while the diner is thoroughly able to detect and appreciate the niceties of flavour, crispness, tenderness, and'so forth ; that a slice of plainly roasted or boiled meat, with a selected vegetable, should follow ; then a morsel of game, and the entremets. Advocates of this very excellent method, it will be observ- ed, do not pay any particular attention to the rot. When game is out of season, they present a savory entremets immediately after them releve, and send round their salad with the saddle or sirloin Thus, in the space marked in the printed menu for “ rot,” we occasionally see “ aspic de foie gras” with “ dsperges cn branches,” and no rot what- ever. Of the two systems the older one is certainly the simpler. The correct introduction of the rot is really the novel feature of the new menu—“ pouted au cresson, salade,” for exam- ple,. never figured in the old bill of fare in the place of game—and by its introduction the releve, altered a good deal in character, is of necessity pushed out of its original place. It will always be conceded, I think, by partisans of both systems, that each possesses merits of an undeniable character. The old method, as we have seen, is the simpler, and consequently the easier of the two, while the new may be voted more truly artistic. In adopting the latter, how- ever, it is a sine qua non that all the principles of the dinner be observed, and faithfully carried out. We canuot miss'a single point, or our little feast will become a fiasco. We must not serve, that is to say, “ pintade au cresson” as a releve, or “ jambon au Madcre” as a rdt— trifling errors that I have noticed at certain banquets modelled according to the new regime. Neither can we forget the salad, which

The recipes given for the treatment of fish apply, it will be found, to the varieties of the finny tribe best known and esteemed at Madras, viz.:—the seer, pomfret, rob&l, sole, grey mullet, and whiting. Of these the first being a large salmon-shaped fish, which is cut up and sold much in the same manner as salmon, is susceptible of being similarly cooked. Small seer are flabby and unfit for the table, but they make good fish stock.

The sole and whiting can be treated exactly like the fishes of the same name at home.

Bony fish are best prepared in the form of purde :—boiled, passed through the sieve, and sent

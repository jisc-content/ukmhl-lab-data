54?) OUR KITCHENS IN INDIA clean place, not only for the preparation of food, but also for its keeping during the day. Think for a moment of the dish of neck of mutton cutlets that the cook takes away to the cook-room at 10 a.m., after his mistress has inspected the market supplies. The cutlets re-appear at dinner time, it is true, but dare we consider how the poor things spent their day before the hour of their cooking arrived? In my ideal room they would be trimmed im- mediately upon a clean dresser, flattened with the cutlet bat, and then arranged neatly upon a large fiat dish, dusted over with pepper and salt, lightly dredged with flour, and consigned till wanted in the gauze safe ; or, if so required, they might be placed in marinade, and then put away beyond the reach of flies. The trimmings would, of course, be collected upon a plate, and sent out to the kitchen for the production of broth for sauce at once. And now for a few words about kitchen ranges and equipments. Until almost the other day, so to speak, an English range was regarded as too expensive a luxury for people in India of ordinary means. The expenditure of from two to three hundred rupees upon such a thing was looked upon as an extravagant freak.

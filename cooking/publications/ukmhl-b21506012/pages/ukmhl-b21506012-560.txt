OUR KITCHENS IN INDIA. 548 I know of a case in which a young and zealous native chef absolutely begged his mistress to permit him to pre- pare his jellies, pastry, &c., in a spare room in the house, alleging as his reason that the kitchen was too hot and smoky : and I am perfectly sure that the majority of good Madras cooks would appreciate a similar concession. The recusants would, in all probability, be gentlemen who have become wedded to practices whereof their consciences are afraid.

Another great thing to obtain, to my mind, is a really

CAMP COOKERY. 389 Birds that have been mauled in shooting can be utilized in the camp stock pot. Purees of game can be made if you have taken out your utensils, if not, you must make the game broth as strong as possible, helped by the fowl stock already described, and thicken it with flour and butter. The addi- tion of marsala or port is, of course, a great improvement. TINNED-FISH.

TINNED MEATS. Tinned Australian, and other preserved lumps of meat, are valuable additions to the store box of the jungle-

OUR CURRIES. 307 by the use of certain spices, and green leaves, garlic, onions, green ginger, almond, cocoanut, &c., at the time of cooking the curry. The spices, which should be used according to taste and discretion, are these:—cloves (laoong), mace (jaioatri), cinnamon (kalmi darchini), nutmeg (jciephat), cardamoms (iaelachi), and allspice (seetul chini gach). A salt-spoonful of one, or at most of two, of these aromatic powders blended, will suffice for a large curry. Dr. Kitchener’s precept, viz., that the mixing of several spices is a blunder, should never be forgotten. The green leaves that are often useful when judiciously introduced are:—fennel (souf), “ maythibajec,” lemon-grass (uggea-ghas), bay-leaves (tajipatha), “karay-patch,” “kote- mear” leaves (green coriander), 4c.; they should be removed before serving. Leaves should be picked out before serv- ing. When green ginger is used it should be sliced very fine, and pounded to a paste ; a dessert-spoonful being sufficient for one curry. The indispensably necessary suspicion of sweet-acid can be produced most readily by a dessert-spoonful of powder- ed or moist sugar and the juice of a lime, or a spoonful of vinegar. A table-spoonful of sweet chutney and the juice of a lime make a good substitute; but a table-spoonful of red currant jelly, with one of chutney, and a little vinegar, or lime juice, form to my mind the nicest combination for dark curries. I strongly advocate the very capital plan of making a fresh paste of some of the above adjuncts, in sufficient quantity for the curry in hand, and blending it with the stock powder when cooking the latter. Here is a reliable recipe One small onion, one clove of garlic, one dessert- spoonful of turmeric, one of freshly-roasted coriander-seed,

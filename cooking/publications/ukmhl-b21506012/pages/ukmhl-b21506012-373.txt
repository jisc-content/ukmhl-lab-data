CAMP COOKERY— (OUR FRESH-WATER FISH). 361 to meet our requirements from the notes of a reliable author: To prepare fresh-water fish (1.) The gills and fins should be cut off; then the fish must be opened, and the viscera removed, being thoroughly dried inside and out with a cloth. If it is to be fried, it is now ready to be floured, or bread-crumbed. (2.) When fish are scaly, they must be scaled very lightly and carefully with a knife, and then be well washed with salt and water to remove all slime. (3.) If no scales, proceed as above without scaling. (4.) To Boil Fish.—Put it into a fish-kettle, with salt, fennel, and a bundle or two of sweet herbs, enough water with a little vinegar to cover the fish. When quite boiling, put in the fish, after three minutes check ebullition, and let it boil slowly. (5.) The liquor in which fish is boiled should be saved for stock or sauce if not too salt. (6.) To Broil.—After the fish has been scaled, &c., notch it two or three times on the back, strew some salt on the fish, and broil, basting with butter, and turning frequently. (7.) To Bake.—Stuff and season with sweet herbs pow- dered and coarse pepper, and salt; put plenty of butter in the dish. (8.) To Stew Fish in the Oven.—Put it in a stew-pan covered with fish broth, with a little white wine or claret; add some salt, spices, an anchovy, and a bundle of sweet herbs, cover the pan, and put in a moderate oven. (9.) Whether roasted, fried, broiled, boiled, baked, or stewed, fish should be done thoroughly. (10.) The best herbs are marjoram, savory, parsley, thyme, green ginger, grated moringa root, and fennel. 31

158 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. beetroot, “ turnip tops ” (leaves), and water-cress, are capa- ble of similar dressing. Sorrel (oseillc) which should be dressed in the manner described for spinach is not half enough used. Your cook will know it if you order “sorely,”—Kamasamy’s pro- nunciation of the double ‘ r ’ being peculiar)—and nothing is nicer than a mutton (neck) cutlet or fillet of beef with a sorrel puree, for the pungent taste of the vegetable suggests a novelty to your palate. My readers who are in the habit of enjoying themselves on the Neilgherries ought to try a dish of pork cutlets with a puree of sorrel {menu No. 12), for with a rich white meat, sorrel is especially agi’eeable. Some prefer half sorrel and half spinach, or a quarter of spinach to three-quarters of sorrel: this is of course a matter of taste. I mentioned this vegetable in connection with potage cl la bonne femme when talking about soups, and I may add now that a plain gravy soup thickened, and flavoured with sorrel puree is far from bad. In cooking sorrel, onion and a little sugar are essen- tial, and lettuce leaves are a great assistance. This vegetable is largely cultivated by the Natives. Hind :—cookch-paluk, Tam :—choke!b-keeray. The Jerusalem artichoke (topinambour) is a vegetable which, as a rule, people either dislike exceedingly, or are very fond of. I place it amongst the best we have. Wash the artichokes, peel and shape them nicely, dropping each one into salt and water at once to prevent its turning black ; when all are ready, put them into a sauce-pan with a gallon of cold-water, and two table-spoonfuls of salt; boil till tender (which will take about twenty minutes after boiling-point has been attained) and drain, serving them with a nice sauce blanche.

49 THICK SOUPS AND PUREES. poultry, and of all game, can be turned to capital account in a puree. Even an ancient, and extraordinarily tough fowl (“ moorghi ”) may be thus rendered fit to eat. For the sick, and for those suffering from tooth-ache, food cooked in this manner is invaluable, whilst there can be no doubt that it must be good for children. In order to be able to accomplish the making of purees satisfactorily you must possess a strong pestle and mortar, a large hair sieve, a wire sieve, and a mincing machine. If you desire to make a pur&e of meat of any kind, an immense amount of labour is saved by first using the mincer, the work in the mortar is then reduced to a mini- mum, and the pounded meat will soon be ready to pass through the sieve. In using the sieve, by the way, caution your cook that he must always put whatever he wishes to pass through it, at the shallow end, placing the sieve over a large bowl, or dish, big enough to receive it, and rubbing the puree through it with a large wooden spoon. From time to time he must invert the sieve, and scrape off the portion of the puree which always adheres to the reverse side of the hair, or wire. A cook must be patient in the use of this utensil, and achieve his object by perseverance, rather than by boisterous work. If you bear too heavily on the hair, your sieve will soon bulge, and ere long the hair will part company from the wooden cylinder to which it is attached. The work of both pounding in the mortar, and passing- through the sieve, is rendered easier by the addition of a little butter or stock during the process. Purees, as soups, are prepared in this way:—You first must make as good a bowl of stock as you can from bones, meat, scraps, (bones of ham and bacon especially valuable sufficient for the number of people you have to cater for. Let it get cool and remove the fat that rises to its surface.

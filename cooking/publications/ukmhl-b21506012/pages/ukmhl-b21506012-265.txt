A dusting of hot rasped crust crumbs should he given on taking the dish from the oven. This entremets is nicer still with artichoke bottoms,— •the leafy kind, and ceufs farcis may be associated with them instead of plain hard-boiled eggs. Maccaroni, and the numerous varieties of the Italian paste family of which it is the best known member, should invariably be plunged into boiling water to commence with—no matter whether you intend to cook them in milk, or stock, afterwards—in order to rid them of the imper- ceptible dirt which clings to them. Remember that mac- caroni is a much handled comestible, and that washing it in water is incorrect. I adverted to this when speaking of soups (page 34), and described how the cleansing can alone be effected. Besides, maccaroni must not be ivetted to begin with by any liquid not boiling. Mark these golden rules laid down by the ‘G.

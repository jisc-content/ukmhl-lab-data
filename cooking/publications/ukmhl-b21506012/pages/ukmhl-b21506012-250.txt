CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 288 ings for anchovy toasts; especially those of spinach, beet- root leaves, peas, or any delicate greens. A number of nice toasts can be made with eggs ; from the plainly poached egg served upon a little square of bread fried a golden brown in butter, to the delicate “ rdti&s des ceufs brouilles aux truffes.” Buttered eggs (ceufs brouilles) are undeniably good if served quite simply, upon crisply-fried bread, straight frorp the fire. Grated bam, finely minced tongue, and little dice of crisply-fried bacon, are capital, if at hand, to garnish the surface of the eggs with; and chopped herbs, anchovy, or the minced remnants of any fish like sardines, pilchards, or herrings, may be stirred into the eggs just before serving with marked advantage. Cold cooked vegetables, such as cauliflower, artichokes, asparagus, &c., may be cut up and mixed with the eggs in the same way,—in fact, a moment’s thought will generally enable a careful cook to make his buttered egg toasts additionally tasty by the introduction of some nice trifle left from a previous meal, which could scarcely be made use of in any other manner. Hard-boiled eggs make a very eatable toast in this way: —Grate a coffee-cupful of corned beef, bacon-lean, or ham • cut four hard-boiled eggs into eight pieces each; mix a good sauce blanche rather thickly, flavour it with a tea- spoonful of anchovy sauce, and slip into it, so as to get thoroughly hot, the cut up eggs ; when steaming, pour the contents of your sauce-pan over four nicely fried squares of bread, dust the grated beef over their surfaces and serve at once. The happy owners of dairies to whom cream is not an extraordinary luxury should try :— “ R6ti&s' des oaitfs cl la creme," which are simply poached eggs served upon crisply fried toasts, with thick boiling cream poured over them.

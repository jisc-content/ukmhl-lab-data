MENU FOR A PARTY OF EIGHT. 406 8. —Be very careful with your preparation of the batter for these fritters (page 211); cut the Peach fritters. , , . . U 6 . . peaches (American ones in tin are ex- cellent) into neat pieces ; dust them with powdered sugar, and let them lie in a little maraschino, or any nice liqueur till wanted, then dip them in your batter, and fry them in abundance of boiling fat; drain them on blotting paper, and serve them dusted over with founded loaf sugar, finely sifted. In the case of raw fruit the peaches cut in halves, peeled, and stoned, should be carefully stewed in syrup with a dash of liqueur and a little lime juice first, then set to get cold, and after being drained, dipped in batter, &c., as above explained. All fritters should be served without delay. 9. —This iced pudding is similar to that given in Menu No. Ill substituting cherries for straw- iced pudding with berries. The only difference I would cherries. t % J suggest is this:—I would first make a rich custard, retaining the pale yellow colour, and adding the preserved cherries to the partly frozen custard, with a liqueur-glass of kirsch. In all other respects follow the directions given in Menus Nos. I and III. Note.—To adapt this menu, braise the entrecote and serve it after the fish, insert pintados or caillcs aucresson instead of the salpicon encaisses, and save the salad to accompany the rot. Instead of No. 9 give at dessert a nice ice say :— Glace,—-parfait ciu cafe. r\ -"li/ *

3 INTRODUCTION. I propose to carry out my scheme in a series of chapters commencing with cook-room experiences, the judicious management of the cook, and some general remarks on the equipment of the store-room and kitchen; then to take the salient features of a dinner one by one, and when 1 have discussed soups, fish, entries, &c., &c., to submit a number of menus, worked out in detail, adapted to our resources in this part of India. I know full well that to several accomplished disciples of Brillat Savarin at Madras, I can impart nothing new. On the contrary, it would better become me to sit at their feet and listen, than to rush in where they have hesitated to tread. To this talented coterie, I appeal for forbearance. I entreat them to be merciful, inasmuch as they are very strong. I feel, indeed, that in their presence, I may truly say with Bamasamy, that I am “ a very poor man,—I beg your pardon.” No. I address my jottings to the many who yearn to follow reform, but who cannot discover the method of doing so ; who,—to quote the words of a very hospitable friend,— “ like nice things better than nasty things,” yet have hitherto failed to penetrate the secret of success ; and who view with daily sorrow the lamentable parody of dinner which it seems good to their cooks to place before them. I shall treat of cosy, sociable little dinners of from two to ten people, rather than of the elaborate banquets of the great; and the main object before me will always be to study economy in conjunction with the system I advocate.

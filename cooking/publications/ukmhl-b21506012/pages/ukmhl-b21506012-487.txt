Dissolve and stir in an ounce and a half of isinglass. Flavour it with any essence you like, strain it, and divide it into three basins; colour the first a bright red with cochineal, the second green with spinach greening, and leave the third its original colour. Whip each separately to a froth. These operations must be done while the custard is still warm. Set according to the following process :—Lay a mould on ice, pour some of the red cream into it to the thickness of about an inch. When this is set, pour in a similar layer of the plain cream, and, when this is set, pour in a layer of the green cream. Go on pouring in layers in the same way until the mould is filled. When the cream is quite set, turn it out, and serve. Care must be taken in pouring in each kind of cream to get every layer the same depth. This is best done by measuring with water how much liquid will go to make a layer of the lequiied thickness, and then getting a cup which just holds that quantity, and using it to measure the cream.

159 OUR VEGETABLES Or, when three parts clone, yon can lift them up, and simmer them till quite done, in rich brown gravy. Or, you can, when half-boiled, drain them dry, and bake them upon a well-buttered tin, serving them with plain melted butter, a dressing of oil, vinegar, minced shallot and salt, or any sauce piquante you fancy.

SALADS. 221 The other form of salad dressing is closely connected with mayonnaise sauce, and has many admirers. With some vegetable ingredients it undoubtedly works better than its plainer relative. In England, however, it is almost always spoilt by being overdosed with vinegar,—-common, acid stuff without any flavouring,—and in nearly every cookery book of the average capacity, you are told to mix oil and vinegar in equal parts, which I have already denounced. An old recipe called “Dr. Kitchener’s salad mixture” embodies as many mistakes as could well be made in a dressing of this kind:—“two table-spoonfuls of oil, or melted butter (!) two or three table-spoonfuls of vinegar.” The “poet’s recipe ” already alluded to is equally faulty. In point of fact, the part played by the vinegar in these dressings is really so small as regards measurement that a fixed amount can scarcely be laid down. In proportion to the oil, one-eiglith is to my mind the outside allotment that should he given.

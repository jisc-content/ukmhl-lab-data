342 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. Son’s Army ration in two qualities. This is a strong well flavoured stew, good by itself, and valuable in composition with a fresh stew. Their Army sausage is another excel- lent thing for the camp. I have already spoken of tinned vegetables, and also of the produce of the country (pages 174 to 178). The tra- veller ought to try and find out what country garden stuff can be got from the villages near his camp. The recipes I have given will be found easy, and the insipidity of tin- ned food will be much relieved by an occasional nicely dressed dish of common vegetables. N.B.—To improve a tough steak or dish of chops Spread a layer of salad oil over both sides of the meat, and place it between two plates for an hour or two before cooking. Camp Jelly.—Take one of Southwell’s jelly tablets, place it in a basin or bowl which should be immersed in hot water. The tablet will soon commence to liquefy, and when partly dissolved, add a breakfast-cupful of boiling water, and stir till liquefaction is complete. Pour this into a mould; in cold weather it will set again naturally, in warm weather a little ice must be used. The tablets are sold with various flavourings. Many of the dishes detailed in the previous chapters, especially those spoken of under the title of “ Eggs, mac- caroni, and cheese,” will be found practicable in the camp ; amongst the menus, more than one nice recipe for cooking mutton, fowls, and chickens, has been recorded ; in short, if the pilgrim be blessed by the possession of an intelligent cook, and provided with a judicious assortment of culinary necessaries and stores, his tent life should never fail to possess amongst its many attractions that indubitably im- portant one—a really good dinner.

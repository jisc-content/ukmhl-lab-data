232 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOB MADRAS. Fish that is very salt must, of course, be soaked in water before it can he used : anchovies in oil do not need that treatment. Gorgona anchovies, on the other hand, must be' freed from brine by steeping. Home-made potted meats, if carefully made, so far sur- pass those which you get in tins, that I can hardly under- stand why they are so rarely attempted. Really good but- ter, and a very little pure gravy, attentively extracted from some fresh meat and bones, are the chief corner-stones in such compositions. Ramasamy invariably over-spices his potted meat, cooks it over the fire, in some strange way, and the less we enquire into the class of butter he uses the better. Potted prawns should be made precisely as laid down for prawn butter, omitting the final amalgamation with butter. I will select home-made potted tongue as a trust- worthy method of using up meat advantageously :— Take one pound weight of tongue, home-cured (do not hesitate to pay eight or ten annas for it when fresh : the sum will not ruin you, and you will get your money’s worth), four ounces of the best butter, a salt-spoonful of pounded mace, a coffee-cup of beef gravy, a tea-spoonful of “ spiced pepper ” (q. v. page 121), and work them in this manner :— cut off the hard skin of the tongue, and pass the meat through your mincing machine : after that, pound it tho- roughly in your mortar, adding the butter and gravy dur- ing the operation : press the meat through your wire-sieve to get rid of gristle, and lumps, work the spiced pepper and mace into it, and pat it down tightly in a jar : smooth the surface : melt a table-spoouful of the same sort of butter in a sauce-pan, and pour it over the surface ; let it get cold, and the work will be completed. This receipt is practicable, as to quantities, with .cold corned beef, chicken and tongue (half and half), cold roast beef, and even mutton. Roast-

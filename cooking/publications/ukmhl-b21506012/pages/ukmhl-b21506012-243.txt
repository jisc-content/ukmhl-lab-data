Maitre cl’hotel butter I have already given (page 90). It is quite worthy of a place amongst hors cl’oeiivres. Prawn butter,—a highly delicious composition, should be made in this way :—Boil the prawns, clean them care- fully, pound them to a paste in your mortar, mixing a little butter with them to assist the operation. Now, melt some butter in a sauce-pan, mix your pounded prawn meat in it, and as soon as it appears to have absorbed the but- ter (having been well stirred during the process and fla- voured with a very little cayenne pepper, and powdered mace) take it out, let it get cold, and mix it with your iced butter in the proportion of about half and half. The pounding must be thorough; there should be no granulated particles of prawn meat in the butter. Crab-coral butter, and lobster butter may be made exactly as the foregoing : in the case of the former, I would put in a couple of anchovies, as the coral is rather tasteless ; and in that of the latter, I would wash the lobster clean, getting rid of all oily, tinny juices. To do this, turn the contents of the tin out upon a sieve, with a bowl under it to catch the liquor ; when the lobster meat drips no longer, pour over it a good jugful of clean cold water turning the pieces so that they may all come under the stream, then dry and pound it. Yellow butter. Hard-boiled yolks of eggs may be passed through the sieve, and be made to form a part of any fancy butter ; they tint plain butter yellow, and make a tasty pat if flavoured with soft herring roes, or cod’s roes, peppered, and sharpened with a few capers.

PRIiFACE TO THE SIXTH EDITION. 'N the revision of this, my sixth edition, I have taken the r±) utmost pains to bring the Culinary Jottings “up to date.” Forty-six pages of new matter have been introduced, much of the original text has been altered, and much removed to give place to newer and better advice, while each branch of the science of cookery has been reconsidered and discussed in the light of maturer experience. I trust that the Public, whom I thank very cordially for the support they have given me during the past thirteen years, will find my last effort an improvement upon its predecessors, and continue to regard with favour Their very faithful Servant, . ]Vyvern. Madras, November 1891.

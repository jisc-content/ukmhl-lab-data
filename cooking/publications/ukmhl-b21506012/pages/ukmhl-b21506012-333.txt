321 MULLIGA TUNNY. to vegetarians, as well as to those who have no objection to eat meat, for I hope to be able to show that a very ex- cellent vmlligatunny can be made without any assistance from fish, flesh, or fowl. This preparation, originally peculiar to Southern India, derives its name from two Tamil words—molegoo (pepper), and tunned (water). In its simple form, as partaken of by the poorer natives of Madras, it is, as its name indicates, a “pepper-water” or soupe maigre, which Mootoosamy makes as follows :—He pounds together a dessert-spoonful of tamarind, six red chillies, six cloves of garlic, a tea- spoonful of mustard seed, a salt-spoonful of fenugreek seed, twelve black peppercorns, a tea-spoonful of salt, and six leaves of kary-pauk. When worked to a paste, lie adds a pint of water, and boils the mixture for a quarter of an hour. While this is going on, he cuts up two small onions, puts them into a chatty, and fries them in a dessert-spoonful of ghee till they begin to turn brown, when he strains the pepper-water into the chatty, and cooks the mixture for five minutes, after which it is ready. The pepper-water is, of course, eaten with a large quantity of boiled rice, and is a meal in itself. The English, taking their ideas from this simple composition, added other condiments, with chicken, mutton, &c., thickened the liquid with flour and butter, and hv degrees succeeded in concocting a soupe grasse of-a decidedly acceptable kind. Oddly enough, we undoubtedly get the best vmlligatunny now-a-days in England, where it is presented in the form of a clear, as well as in that of a thick, soup. In an artistic point of view, the former is to my mind infinitely the better of the two, as I shall endeavour to explain later on. Never- theless, the thick is by no means to be despised. The superiority of the English adaptation needs but little explanation, for it may safely be attributed to the fact that the soup is composed upon a really strong foundation in

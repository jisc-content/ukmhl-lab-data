71 HINTS ABOUT ENTREES. chup in which a table-spoonful of red currant jelly has been dissolved, with a tea-spoonful of “spiced pepper,” some pepper corns, salt, a chopped onion, and a dessert- spoonful of marjoram and thyme blended. A hash of cold mutton collops that have lain a few hours in this prepara- tion is very like that of venison, and the fillets of an Indian hare, (a little underdone in the roasting) similarly steeped all day, are really excellent. In this particular instance you must strain the marinade, and add it to the thick gravy in which the hash or fillets have to be sim- mered. Marinade need not be made in extravagant quantities. It should cover the bottom of the dish on which you place the meat, your object being gained by occasional turning, and basting. When wanted, the cook should lift the meat from the dish, let it drain a minute or so, and then pro- ceed to business. Independently of the method in which you purpose to cook them, a great deal depends upon the careful trimming of a dish of mutton cutlets. How uninviting do these miniature chops look when they have been cut anyhow from the joint to which they belonged ? First, saw off the ends of the row of bones level, and cut off the outer flap ; now take a very sharp knife, and divide the row of cutlets down to the bone with one clean decided cut between each of them, and, lastly, sever them one by one with a single stroke of the chopper. Next, lay them on your board and give them a few strokes with your cutlet bat, trim them into shape, and then place them in the mari- nade. The hungry man may be able, no doubt, to eat the cutlets his cook may send him, “ rough hew them as he may,” but for an entree, we must study appearance. Little paper frills placed round the ends of the bones of the cutlets before serving, give a finish to your entree.

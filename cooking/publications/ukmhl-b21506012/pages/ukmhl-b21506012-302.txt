About ii pound and a half of these slices having been obtained, I next cut off all remnants of good lean that still adhered to the bones, and put them into a bowl. The bones were then broken up, and cast into a large stew-pan with every atom of skin, fat, gristle, &c., that I could find left in the dish after the trimming operation.

MENU FOB A PARTY OF EIGHT. 430 9.—Gently boil a quarter of a pound of the best rice till about half done, then drain it and put ratrioe.1106 a 1Impe' ^ into a stew-pan with a pint and a half of good boiling milk, and six ounces of sugar, add a coffee-cupful of boiling cream, stir well, and simmer till the rice is done.

Put the whites of seven eggs into a bowl, and whip them as stiffly as possible, add half a pound of sugar, mix well,

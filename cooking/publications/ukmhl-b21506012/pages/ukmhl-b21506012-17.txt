THE MENU. 5 attraction :—in good wine, no lack of ice, the brightest plate, snow}^ linen, well toned light, and tasteful adorn- ment of the table; with all minutiae remembered—from dcs petits pains in the deftly-folded napkins, to the artistic salad which in all modern menus is not expressed yet, like salt, understood to be present. An extra entree may, of course, be given, but if the one selected be really nice, the releve correct, and the game about to' follow be the best in season, I fail to recognize the necessity of the addition. And, here, it may not be altogether unprofitable to con- sider attentively certain points connected with the modern banquet upon which opinions differ, and concerning which a good many people find a difficulty in coming to a satis- factory decision. The moot point or points to which I refer are associated with the general plan or arrangement of the menu, and in order to explain them, it will be necessary to trace their cause carefully. In the days of old, our forefathers divided their hills of fare into a number of courses. Thus, the soup and fish comprised the first course; the entrees and joint the second; and the game and sweets the third ; cheese and dessert being served independently. But pf late years, we have simplified matters, and the modern menu, adapted to a great extent, of course, from that of France, is placed before us in two “ services,” as exemplified in the following table :— Potage .. Soup. Premier service .. Poisson .. Pish. Entries .. Side-dishes. .Relevis .. Joint, or remove. Hots .. The roast (game or poultry) Second service ... Entremets .. Savory and sweet dishes. Fromage .. Cheese. . Dessert .. Dessert,

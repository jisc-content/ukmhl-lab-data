MENU FOR A DINNER OF SIX. 464 all bones, skin and scraps, and make a nice clear white broth with them. Take of the fowl meat two parts, of cold boiled tongue one part, and of truffles one part. Mince all very finely and mix them together. Melt an ounce of butter in a sauce-pan, stir into it a table-spoonful of flour, moisten it with some broth, and then add the mince: flavour it with salt, pepper, and a little powdered thyme to taste, and stir it over the fire for three or four minutes : take it off the fire, and add two eggs beaten up with the juice of a lime and strained. Spread the mince out upon a large dish (it should be pretty stiff) and let it get cold.

Lard them freely with fat bacon. If

89 SA UCES, Throw in just before serving a table-spoonful of minced parsley, fennel, or chopped capers, and you will have :— same an persil, sauce a a 'femail, or sauce aux cdpres. Stir into it after it is made, a dessert-spoonful (or more if liked) of anchovy, Harvey, ketchup, or any sauce you fancy. For sauce aux fines herbes, flavour a pint of milk by boil- ing up in it—blanched first for five minutes in scalding water—a Bombay onion, a tiny bit of garlic, and a handful of parsley: when well flavoured, strain the milk through muslin and stir it by degrees into a sauce-pan in which a couple of ounces of butter and two of flour have been mixed ; thicken gently by bringing the mixture to the boil, strain, and add, just before serving, a table-spoonful of minced curled parsley, a dessert-spoonful of chopped garden cress, and half one of chopped green stem of spring onion. A squeeze of a lime may be judiciously added to this sauce. Fillets of pomfret, or any fish that you can fillet nicely, stewed gently in milk thus flavoured, with the same thick- ened and poured over them when done, are excellent. Small rings of sliced gherkins added to some plain “ melt- ed butter” form the sauce aux cornichons you remember abroad; a tea-spoonful of tarragon vinegar should accom- pany .the rings. “ Melted butter ” for sweet entremets such as cabinet pud- ding, et'hoc genus omne, should be made exactly in the same way as sauce blanche, with sugar instead of salt, and with milk, or milk and water. An egg beaten up in brandy, sherry, or liqueur, added off the fire at the last moment is a great improvement. By adding strong warm broth or stock to the butter and flour, instead of water or milk and water as in sauce blanche, you produce sauce blonde which forms the basis of several useful sauces.

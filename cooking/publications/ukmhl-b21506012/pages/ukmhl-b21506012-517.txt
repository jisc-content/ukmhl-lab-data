Simmer the lettuces until done, take them out, drain them, and when dry, cut them into shreds with a dessert-knife : put the shredded pieces at the bottom of I your tureen, pour the consomme, boiling hot, over them, and serve. One average lettuce will be found enough for four basins. The broth in which it is cooked must be strained, and added to the soup : see, however, that it is clear. 2.—Clean and trim a line pomfret; draw off the skin Pomfret in the Nor- ancl detach the flesh from the bone with mandy manner. a shai-p knife : take the two sides so * Lettuces cooked in this manner may be served as a vegetable, in which form they are delicious: omit the shredding and serve them with their broth poured over them.—W. 4?

CAMP COOKERY— (OUR FRESH-WATER FISH). 355 very materials which are needed to complete with subtlety our dish of fish. The next point is the association of onions with fish cookery, and the very slow simmering of the composition. Lastly, the egg thickening which should not be omitted on any account. Accepting this as our standard method of stewing fillets of fresh-water fish, we need only consider the matelote, which is a stew of a somewhat richer character. Eels, of which I shall speak presently, are, as we all know, specially dedi- cated to this dish by the chief writers on cookery, but fillets of fish in variety can thus be turned to good account. In fact Ude translates matelote by the English term “hotchpotch”, thereby indicating that it should be com- posed of a medley of fish. Commence, after filleting the fish, and preparing a broth as in the former recipe, by frying at the bottom of a stew- pan in butter a dozen small red shallots cut up as for curry- making. Let them take colour, and then add the fillets, the broth, and a muslin hag containing a tea-spoonful each of marjoram and thyme, twelve peppercorns, and a blade of mace; pour into the broth a couple of glasses of claret, close the pan, and set it over a low fire to simmer gently till the fillets are cooked. Remove the stew-pan, arrange the fillets upon a hot entree dish, .empty the broth into a clean sauce-pan through a strainer, add to its piquancy with a dessert-spoonful of anchovy and Harvey sauce blended, one of mushroom ketchup and the squeeze of a lime; thicken this with half an ounce of butter and half an ounce of flour (or more according to the quantity of broth) and pour it over the fillets. If you can put in with the fillets to begin with a pint measure of carefully clean- ed fresh-water shrimps, so much the better ; and on special occasions a tin of oysters will add to the success of the composition. Fillets, I need scarcely point out, can be baked or broiled

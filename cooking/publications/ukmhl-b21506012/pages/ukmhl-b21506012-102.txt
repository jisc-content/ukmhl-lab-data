CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 90 Maitre d hotel sauce is simply scouce blonde with a bounti- ful supply of finely minced curled parsley, a half pinch of spiced pepper, finished off the fire with the well beaten yolk of air egg, and a squeeze of lime juice. Mincing parsley requires attention. If it be done when the leaves are wet, the pieces will all stick together, and much of the juice will be lost. Parsley must first be blanched in scalding water, and then carefully dried in a cloth, after which it can be chopped as finely as possible. Maitre d’hotel butter, I may add par parenthese, is made thus:—To two ounces of iced fresh butter, add the juice of one lime, a dessert-spoonful of chopped parsley free from moisture, a little white pepper, and a pinch of salt. Form it with your butter bat, and then set it in the ice box. A nice juicy, grilled chop, or a little grilled fillet of beef, served with a piece of maitre d’hotel butter melting over it, is a French method of captivating the appetite. Sauce d la, poulcttc, is worthy of distinction among ordi- nary white sauces. Its chief points are :—first, that it is thickened with the raw yolks of eggs besides a little flour ; secondly, that it is garnished with button mushrooms. It is a creamy looking sauce the colour of a rich custard. Make an ordinary thin sauce blonde with one pint of chicken broth, one ounce of butter, one ounce of flour, pepper and salt to taste : stir well for a quarter of an hour, and it will be a thin white sauce : then add en bain-marie one by one the strained and well beaten yolks of three eggs, finish off with a pat of butter, and a couple of table-spoonfuls of chopped mushrooms. Note that the pulp of some large sweet onions that have been simmered in milk till tender, and passed through the sieve, when worked into sauce blonde, with a spoonful of cream to finish with for high days and holidays, gives you sauce Soubise.

CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 78 the easier substitute of hollowecl.-out rolls. The knack of making nice light pastry is, however, far from'common. Neither reading, nor even practical demonstration, will teach it. So unless you are certain that your cook pos- sesses the gift, never permit him to waste good materials in idle experiments. x\n entree, of pastry, if not unmis- takably good, is a blot upon the face of your menu. In nearly all recipes for the sauces of high class entrees contained in good works upon cookery, it will be found that the use of a strong meat-gravy foundation is a sine qua non, for some of them butter is unsparingly advocated, while cream is very frequently prescribed. In an early chapter of my jottings, I mentioned that I would far sooner recommend a little extra expense with regard to these items than in the wholesale distribution of “ Europe stores.” I repeat the opinion emphatically now. The dinner cooked with an adequate allowance of good stock, cream and butter, requires but little aid from Messrs. Crosse and Blackwell. Unfortunately, however, for those who desire to follow this precept at Madras, our supply of milk is meagre in quality and quantity, and absurdly expensive. The only way to obtain a little butter fit to eat, if you do not maintain a dairy of your own, is to have a cow milked at your door, and to set the milk so obtained for cream in your own larder. I cannot fix the exact cost of a pound of butter thus made, but, approximately speaking, it may be stated that five measures of milk at one rupee (the current rate) will not yield more than a good third of a pound, so your pound of butter will cost you nearly' three rupees !:|: There will be a slight difference if the milk be rich ; in my estimate, I speak, of course, of the average country cow’s milk purchased at the door. —ft * Milk lias become a little cheaper since this was written, but the difficulty regarding butter and cream seems in no way removed.—W.

CUBBIES—CONTINUED. 310 Fresh chutneys should be served in saucers which should lie tastefully arranged upon a tray. Four or five varieties can he presented together, so that there may be an oppor- tunity of selection. Caviare dressed with a few drops of lime juice and a dust_ of yellow pepper, roes of fish pounded with a little butter, potted prawns, potted ham, crab paste, lobster paste, and sardine paste, are hors d'oeuvres that can accompany the chutneys and materially assist them. The best fresh chutneys are: tomato, cucumber, mint, brinjal, cocoanut, mango or apple, tamarind, and potato.

For cucumber chutney :—Cut the cucumber into thin strips an inch long; say tlmee heaped-up table-spoonfuls ; mix with them a tea-spoonful of finely-minced onion, one of chopped green chilli, and one of parsley; moisten with a dessert-spoonful of vinegar in which a pinch of sugar has been dissolved, a dessert-spoonful of salad oil, and dust over it salt and black pepper at discretion.

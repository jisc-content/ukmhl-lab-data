OUR VEGETABLES. 175 our best exporters of preserved provisions to compete, in this particular branch of their business, with the great French and American firms. Compare the tinned green peas, or asparagus, exported by the former with the petits pois verts, or asperges we get from France. Of these I have already spoken ; we may accordingly proceed to consider :— Tinned French beans, (haricots verts). These excellent vegetables should be turned out upon a saute-pan, shaken in butter until hot, and served. Or they may be treated in any of the methods already set forth for cooked fresh hari- cots verts. They make excellent purees, and may be cut up, and warmed with other vegetables in a macedoine de legumes. I strongly recommend them to be served d la creme, or a la poulette, with a saddle of mutton. Flageolets, another delicious tinned legume, should be carefully warmed, andthensevvedcllajmulette, or d la creme, or plainly cl la maitre cVhotel. They are very effective when associated with other vegetables “cl la macedoine,’’ and especially nice if mixed with haricots verts, moistened with some fresh butter, and served as haricots panaches. Fonds d’artichauts, if delicately handled, may be cooked up in any of the ways recommended for the cooked fresh artichoke. Pointes d’asperges are, as a rule, too soft to stand much manipulation. The safest plan is to heat them cn bain-marie in their tin, drain off their liquor and then to turn them into the soup or sauce in which they are to be served. They make an excellent addition to a chaucl froicl if set carefully in the border of aspic which should of course be iced. Pure iced cream is, in such circumstances, their best sauce. Macedoine de legumes as a central garnish for cutlets can hardly be surpassed. The macedoine must be gently heated up in a really good poulette, or bechamel sauce, and a spoonful of cream may be added if liked.

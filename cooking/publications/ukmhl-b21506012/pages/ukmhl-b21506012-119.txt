107 SA UCES—CONCL UDED. with sweet-breads, fillets of tongue, and slices of foie-gras is merely a careful stew of fowl fillets, or quenelles, in the garnished sauce I have described. These should have been previously cooked, they will then merely require gently heating up in the sauce. It will be observed that the specialties of the two sauces just given are a flavour of truffles and Madeira in Pe'rigucux, and of chicken essence with prepared Financicre for the sauce of that name. Bechamel. Bechamel, which I select as the best type of a funda- mental white sauce, should be made in this way :— (a) . Take the same ingredients that I have detailed for Espagnole, and commence by slicing up the onion, and shak- ing the rings in an ounce of melted butter at the bottom of the stew-pan ; do not let them take colour, but add your meat* and bones at once, and cover them with water, omit- ting the browning stage. (b) . Go on now to make a clear consomme ; instead of burnt-sugar colouring, add a tea-spoonful of powdered sugar plain, and all the vegetables. If this be carefully prepared and skimmed, you will obtain a pellucid broth which should be strained, and kept ready for use presently. (c) . Take a sauce-pan, and melt a couple of ounces of “ cow-brand,” or any good preserved butter in it ; add two ounces of flour, stir for five minutes, and add by degrees your clear broth, half a pint of cream, a small tinful of mushrooms chopped, salt, and pepper ; stir over the fire till boiling, and then permit the sauce to simmer slowly for an hour, taking off all fat that may rise. (cl). At the end of the hour, you can strain the bechamel into a sauce-pan, and place it in the bain-marie. Before # Veal, if procurable, if not, a fowl instead of beef.—W.

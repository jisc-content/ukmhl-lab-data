I give you elsewhere several dishes in which tomatoes play an important part, I will, therefore, confine myself now to two excellent recipes for serving them as an entremets. “ Au cjratin’’:—Cut a slice off the top of each tomato as you would decapitate a boiled egg. With a dessert-knife scoop out the pulp and seeds from the shell as well as you can, put the cases so obtained on one side : make a puree with the scooped out pulp proceeding as laid down for to- mato sauce, (q. v.), strain off the seeds, and thicken it with fine bread-crumbs : beat up some’ eggs (one for every two cases) and mix the whole well, stuff the cases therewith, give the surface of each a light dusting of grated cheese, bake on a buttered dish for ten minutes, and serve. Another method, which has the advantage of simplicity, may be followed in this way. Put an ounce of butter into a small stew-pan, throw into it a table-spoonful of finely minced sweet onion, put the pan on the fire and lightly fry the onion; before the pieces take color, put into the vessel four or five large, or a dozen small tomatoes, cut up into small pieces. Stir well over the fire until the tomatoes are thoroughly cooked. Now rub an au gratin dish with a piece of garlic, butter it, and pour into it the contents of the stew-pan, dust over the surface a layer of Parmesan, Gruyere, or other mild cheese, and bake for eight or ten minutes: serve hot. “A V Italienne” :—Cutthe tomatoes in halves, scoop out the pulp and seeds with a silver spoon, and place the cases on a baking dish upon which you have poured a little of the best salad oil. Make a mixture of grated ham, bread-crumbs, some finely minced shallot, parsley, marjoram, and thyme, seasoned with pepper and salt; mix this with the tomato pulp, and fill the cases, covering them completely, shake an allowance of salad oil in drops overall, and bake for a few minutes, serving the dish intact as it comes from the oven. 15

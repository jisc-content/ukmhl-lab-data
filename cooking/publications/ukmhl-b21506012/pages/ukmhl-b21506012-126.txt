114 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. mutton, or the wizen loinlet,—ancl let us assume that the meat, though small, is fairly good,—what shall we do with it? In a country where it is impossible to keep cooked meat, the fact of a joint being small, need hardly be considered a drawback, but we have before us the flesh of an immature ox or sheep, a good deal of bone in proportion to the meat, and very little fat. I say boldly that plainly roasting such a fragment is a mistake. Unless the joint be of a fair size, and above the average as to fat like the saddle, or the spe- cially fine sirloin we buy for a dinner party, I would never roast it. The morsel can ill afford to lose the little gravy it possesses which the stab of the spit is bound to draw, and which we rarely see sent to table for Ramasamy appre- ciates it as an adjunct to his curry. The only way to cook little joints, such as those I have indicated, is to braise them. You thus obtain all the nour- ishment the meat can give, and a tasty and tender dish into the bargain. Braising. - This admirable method of cookery is far too rarely adopted : so for the benefit of those who do not understand the process, I had better mention that braising consist in placing meat in a closed pan, with some made-gravy or stock round it, vegetables cut up, and a judicious allowance of salt and pepper.

To braise a little Indian joint successfully, you must first bone it, then trim it, tie it with a string into a neat sqape, give it a dust of salt and pepper, and put it on one

SAVOURY TOASTS. 241 and the fat that you saved, pour the remaining melted fat over it, divide it into portions, and put it in the oven. When quite crisp, and ‘ short,’ serve straightway without fear. Mustard, Nepaul pepper, and salt should accom- pany, and hot plates should be placed before each guest. Savoury toast made of the remains of cold roast game are delicious. Teal, wild-duck, snipe, quails, and florican ; young pea-fowl, spur-fowl, jungle-fowl, and even par- tridges may be thus presented a second time, forming a kind of rechauffe which rarely fails to be appreciated. The method of preparing a game-toast is somewhat similar to that I have described for ‘ ‘ kidney toast ’ ’ (a). The cold meat should be picked from the bones, and pounded with a little butter to a paste : the skin and bones (well mashed) should be set to make a good, strong, game-flavoured gravy wherewith to form a thick puree in conjunction with the pounded meat, the process of blending which is precisely the same as that mentioned in the recipe previously alluded to. Pour the puree over hot fried toasts, and serve with- out hesitation. All purees of game composed for toasts should be mixed rather thickly so as to rest upon the toast, and not spread all over the dish. Nepaul pepper, and quarters of limes should be handed round with them. I have already said that spinach, and other delicate greens—worked up in the form of purees—were very nice if served upon anchovy toast. They make capital toasts alone. A well made puree of spinach laid upon a crisply fried, and well buttered toast, is decidedly good; a poach- ed egg, or a.layer of “buttered eggs” can be added, of course, with enhanced effect. An excellent toast can be made with the tender leaves and stalks of the beet-root. After having been boiled and diained like spinach, they should be chopped up and heated 21

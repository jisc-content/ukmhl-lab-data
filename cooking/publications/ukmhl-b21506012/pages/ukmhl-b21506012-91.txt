79 BA TBEES—CON CL UDED. There is a terrible preparation which milkmen sell to our cooks under the title of “ kitchen butter.” To add to its attractiveness, it is generally smeared upon a leaf, and ' carried in the hand ! It looks like the compound used for greasing the wheels of railway carriages in England, which a porter once told a friend of mine was “ mostly made of ingredients, and stuff as ive makes hup a’purpose." I fear that our so-called “ kitchen butter ” might be equal- ly vaguely described. What, then, can people of moderate incomes do? For, I take it that even wealthy folk at home would hesitate to pay six shillings a pound for the butter used by their cooks ! The most economical remedy for this evil is to use preserved butter. The “Italian,” “ Copenhagen,” (cow brand), “ Nor- mandy,” and “Denmark,” are all especially free from brine, or taint of any kind, and can be thoroughly recommended. One pound tin, carefully used, ought to suffice for the cook- ing of a dinner for eight persons, (assuming even that the menu contain a full amount of dishes -requiring butter in their composition) and, in my humble opinion, the result will generally be found to justify that amount of extra- vagance. Wash the butter well first with cold water, then with fresh milk, and set it on ice. In Chapter IV I stated that experience compelled me to denounce the use of bottled truffles, tinned mushrooms, and cepes, on account of their want of flavour, and con- sequent inability to take the place occupied in European cookery by the fresh fungi of which they are the preserved specimens. I now repeat my opinion that at all events they do not repay the expense of their purchase. What then can be done to supply their place ? I at once point to the two best flavoured accessories we can command in India :—the pate dc foie gras and bottled financierc. In each of these preparations the flavour of the cooked truffle appears to have been caught, and sealed up. I therefore

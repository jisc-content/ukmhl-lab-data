BOILING AND STEAMING. 127 rapidly done, and the inside scarcely cooked at all. The joint looks done, and is consequently sent up with the un- satisfactory result which I have pointed out. Simmering a joint of meat is undoubtedly a troublesome process in India. The cookâ€™s attention must he kept up throughout the work. He cannot lift the pot to the hob, or change its position on the range, as the English cook can so easily do. He must be ever watchful about his fire, and guard against there being too much, or too little firewood under his vessel. In fact, I doubt whether it is possible for Ramasamy to conduct the simmering process satisfactorily with only the common appliances of the cookroom at his com- mand. Those who possess ranges, or cooking stoves, should count themselves especially fortunate. Their cooks can regulate the heat they want at will. But, with a common cookroom fireplace, the difficulty of maintaining the un- varying gentle heat so highly essential, appears to me to be very great. Duringthe boiling of a joint, the water should, atall times, he kept so as to cover it. If there be any loss by evapora- tion, it should be made good at once by the addition of hot water. No matter what kind of meat you boil, you will find it improved by the addition of a few vegetables. Custom has ruled that we should }mt in carrots, and turnips, with boiled beef ; turnips, or sweet onions, with boiled mutton ; onions with a rabbit, (fcc., yet true cooks add a judicious assort- mentof herbs, &c., toeoery boiled dish. A large sweet onion, some celery, a carrot, parsley, a sprig of marjoram, or thyme, a little hag of flavouring materials such as a clove of garlic, a blade of mace, a few cloves, some whole peppers, and the peel of a lime, should always go into the pot with a boiling fowl. Unless you have tried them, you have no idea how these things improve the taste of boiled joints. It is a very capital plan to boil a fowl in the soup-stock.

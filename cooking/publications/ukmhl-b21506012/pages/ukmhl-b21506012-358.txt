CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 346 there can be no doubt that this is correct, notwithstand- ing a strange idea that some people entertain that salmon, pike, and certain other varieties of English fresh-water fish, are better if kept for at least a day. Another point is the speedy removal of the viscera. The fish intended for the table should be killed at the water-side at once, and then emptied, the liver alone being saved. It should then be wiped dry with a cloth, and sent up to the camp or bungalow forthwith with directions to the cook for its treatment. If large enough, fresh-water fish should certainly be crimped as soon as killed, i.e., scored with a sharp knife, transversely from head to tail, on each side nearly to the bone, the cuts being about two inches apart according to the size of the fish. A douche of the coldest water avail- able should follow, and a plunge in the stream in a cool shady spot for a quarter of an hour. Crimping should be carried out before the fish stiffens. The process renders the flesh “firmer, and crisper” (says Sir Humphrey Davy) “by preserving the irritability of the fibre,” while the speedy removal of the intestines, and the grass and weeds, on which the fish has been feeding, from its throat goes far to destroy the muddy taste, and to nullify any unwhole- some effect that may arise from the sort of food it may have been eating. Old Isaak inveighed very strongly against allowing a fish to soak in water after it had once been cleansed, point- ing out that such a practice “abated much of'its sweet- ness.” Speedy cooking after cleaning was his maxim. Boiling fresli-water fish is less to be recommended than baking, stewing, broiling, roasting, or frying it. Sir Henry Thompson shows in his admirable treatise on Food and Feeding that much of the nutritious element is lost by this process, notwithstanding that you plump the fish into boil- ing salt and water to secure as much as possible its juices

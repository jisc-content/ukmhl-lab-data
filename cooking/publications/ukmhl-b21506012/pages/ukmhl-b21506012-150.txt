138 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS, never more genei'ally followed with regard to other \egeta- bles. It will be, I think, admitted nem con that we live in a climate out here especially demanding vegetable diet. With the thermometer indicating 90° or thereabouts, plain ani- mal food is not only distasteful to many, but absolutely unwholesome. We cannot, therefore, devote too much atten- tion to the cookery of vegetables. Let us consider what we have got under three heads (a) —English vegetables grown in India. (b) —Country vegetables. (c) —Vegetables preserved in tins. At different periods during the year we can get in Mad- ras:—potatoes, green peas, cauliflowers, cabbages, spinach, artichokes (Jerusalem), and globe artichokes from the Hills, French beans, carrots, parsnips, turnips, knolkhol, celery, marrows, leeks, cucumbers, tomatoes, lettuces, beetroot, en- dive, and onions : all under head number one. Under head number two wehave, brinjals, bandecai, vari- ous beans, country cucumber, and greens (which cook well as spinach), moringa pods, small tomato or love apple, maize, (mucka cholum) sorrel, pumpkins, yams, onions large and small, garlic, and sweet potato. For head number three, which we will take separately, we must consult the list of preserved French and American vegetables published by any well-known Firm. I have omitted asparagus, seakale, and salsify, from my list under the first head, as those excellent vegetables have not yet been cultivated by the gardeners of Bangalore or the Neilgherries in sufficient quantity to form a portion of the vegetable supply of our markets. For the benefit however, of such enterprising amateurs as may he able to grow them privately, I will mention how each should be treated by the cook hereafter.

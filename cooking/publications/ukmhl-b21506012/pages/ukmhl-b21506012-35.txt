23 CERTAIN KITCHEN REQUISITES. A cupboard fitted with a lock and key should be given to the cook for the safe custody of the many small articles I have enumerated, and a set of shelves for his utensils. The cook-room table should be roomy and strong, and to ensure its cleanliness, it should be continually scalded down with boiling water and soda, and well rubbed over with sand paper. Lastly, no kitchen should be without a clock. A cook of ordinary intelligence can, without difficulty, be taught to mark the progress of the hands, and work by time, rather than by guess-work. It is hardly necessary, I hope, for me to point out the intense importance of cleanliness in the kitchen, and in all utensils connected therewith. It you cannot go to the kitchen yourself, it is essential that you should hold weekly inspections of all your cooking utensils, which should be spread out on a mat in the verandah for that purpose. Give out leashing soda, for you cannot keep things clean without it; and be very particular about the cloths that are used by the cook. There is a horrible taste which sometimes cling to soups, sauces, etc., which a friend of mine specifies as “ dirty cloth taste.” This is eloquent of neglect, and dirty habits in the kitchen. Sieves will do for many things, but there are some compositions which must be strained through cloths, we cannot, therefore, be too attentive with reference to this part of our kitchen equipment.

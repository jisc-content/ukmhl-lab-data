These vegetables will be found most valuable, for they are very nutritious and whole- some. They must be soaked for at least twelve hours, and then be placed in cold water with a little salt, and gra- dually boiled. When boiling point has been attained, the vessel should be drawn to the side of the fire, and its con- tents simmered till they are soft. They should be served with a pat of butter melting among them, a dust of freshly ground black pepper, and salt. Bacon, cut into dice and fried, may be introduced with them or they may be served dlapoulette, d lamctitrecVhotel, or with brown sauce.

You sometimes see a hungry man polish off his bivalves before the lime, pepper, and bread and butter, have reached him. You can combat this contingency by breaking up the dishes containing these adjuncts into detachments, and serving them in two or three directions at once. But a far better plan is this :—before dinner is announced, put the plates of oysters with the slices of brown bread and butter upon them in each guest’s place, and send your vinegar and pep- per round as fast as you can after they are seated. The shells are in this case omitted. The garnishing of the compartments of the hors cVoeuvres dish should be tastefully done with knots of curled parsley, curled cress, a little bunches of fresh water-cress. Instead of the elaborate service a V Italienne, a single cold canape, if very carefully composed, maybe placed upon each guest’s plate as a prelude to the dinner-when oysters are out of season. This practice is decidedly preferable for a dinner party. Cut some thin slices of stale brown or white bread, butter them as for sandwiches, and cut out of them very neatly a number of oblong pieces two inches long, and one and a half broad.

Garnish each canape thus made with a turned olive, a tiny leaf from the golden heart of a lettuce, or a sprig of water-cress. Or sprinkle over each a canopy of grated ham, granulated hard- boiled yolk of egg, or cod’s roe. In like manner you can with a little forethought compose

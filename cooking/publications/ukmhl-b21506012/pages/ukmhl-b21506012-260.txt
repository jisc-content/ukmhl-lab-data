248 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS, a little clear gravy, herbs and onion as used for omelette making, the tomato, cold vegetables, and carefully sifted bread-crumbs. The remains of fish, game, and poultry; grated ham, corned beef, and tongue, and slices of saus- ages, may be also occasionally made use of by an ingenious cook. Let us first consider a few ways of serving eggs :— “ (Eufs sur le plat”:—This simple, yet capital, method of doing eggs in a hurry should be noted. Melt a table- spoonful of butter in an omelette-pan, and slip two eggs into it, carefully avoiding breaking the yolks ; let them set in the butter, as a poached egg sets in water ; the moment they are sufficiently firm, lift them with a slice into the hot dish ready to receive them, pouring the butter in which they were cooked over them. Put in the eggs the moment the butter melts ; foT, when first they go in, the pan should not be too hot: a drop or two of tarragon vinegar may he shaken over the dished eggs, or a tiny bit of maitre cl’hotcl butter, the size of a pea, may be allowed to melt over each of them. If, after dishing the eggs, you return the pan to the fire, and brown the butter before pouring it over them, you have “ceufs an beurre noir.” Eggs broken gently over very finely grated cheese,— which has been dissolved in melted butter in an omclctte- pan over the fire—and allowed to set are called “ ceufs au fromage”: they should be dusted with pepper, and salt before serving. I have frequently mentioned “ buttered-eggs ” * in con- nection with fish, vegetable cookery, and toasts. By some, the dish is called “ scrambled eggs,” which is perhaps the more accurate title, being a translation of the French “ceufs brouilles,” the name given to it by our “lively neighbours.” Do not forget the many ways in which you may sei’ve this composition, and proceed to make it thus :— The “ rumbled eggs ” of Ramasimy.

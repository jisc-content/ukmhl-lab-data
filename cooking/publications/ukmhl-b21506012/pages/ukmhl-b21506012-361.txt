CAMP COOKERY—(OUli FRESH-WATER FISH). 349 in the proportion of one quarter (or one-thircl if you can spare it) of the whole preparation is most essential, because it preserves the moisture within, so necessary to prevent the fish being too dry. Tinned oysters, and the liquor with them can, of course, be used instead of the fresh-water shell- fish, or with them if the fish be very large. Here is a good receipt for baking a murral (a) —-See that the fish is perfectly clean, and thoroughly dry before stuffing it. Take sufficient bread-crumbs to fill the fish nicely without overcrowding, put them into a bowl, break into the bowl two, three, or more eggs according to the quantity of crumbs, which is of course decided by the size of the fish. The eggs when added should moisten the crumbs throughout. Add about a tea-spoonful each of thyme and marjoram from the bottle, and enough chopped suet to represent one-third, or not less than one quarter of the whole mixture, salt and pepper in proportion. (b) —Instead of suet, tinned butter can be used, or minced cooked fat bacon. Two or three anchovies, wiped free from oil,'may be minced and added, or a slight allowance of anchovy sauce ; if the liver of the fish has been saved it should be minced, and put in also. (c) —In deciding the exact amounts of these ingredients you must be guided by discretion, remembering that the crumbs give bulk, and the eggs cohesion; that the suet, butter, or fat provides the necessary internal basting, so to speak, while the herbs, seasoning, and anchovy, yield flavour. (cl)—Having thoroughly blended the whole composition like a pudding, fill the murral with it carefully, sewing up the opening in which it is confined. If by chance you have made a little too much, the stuffing that is over can be divided into portions, cutlet-wise, and fried, to be served as a garnish. 30

SALADS. 217 vegetables principally employed being, lettuces (cabbage, and coss), endive, tomatoes, onions, cucumbers, parsley, young radishes, garden-cress, and water-cress, in the latter condition ; and in the former, beet-root, French beans, flageolets, potatoes, artichokes, cauliflower, turnip-tops, as- paragus, cabbage, vegetable marrow, and young carrots. With cold cooked country vegetables, I have made capital salads ; young brinjals, the inollay-keeray, bandecai, coun- try beans, greens of sorts, and little pumpkins gathered very young, are all worthy of treatment in this way. Touching salad-dressing a great deal might be written, for concerning its composition cookery books seem to pos- sess “ a thousand several tongues,” and every tongue to bring in “ a several tale.” Let us try and be contented, how- ever, with a few standard ones, remembering that salads may be clothed in simplicity, as well as in grandeur. True connoisseurs, I think, adhere, as a rule, to the very simplest: that is to say, the simplest as far as the compo- nent parts, and the process of mixing them, are concerned. The artist’s hand and eye, and some little experience to boot are, of course, essential to acquire that nicety of judgment of quantity which a plain dressing demands. It is, there- fore, the hardest to describe. Let me lead off with one general law for every salad, of which English people are, collectively speaking, ignorant. It is this :— Abstain from the vinegar bottle as much as possible. You do not want an acid dish at all. Vinegar is merely added to lend a peculiar flavour to the composition, and to assist it with an almost imperceptible pungency. That most per- nicious advice : “ Four times the spoon with oil of Lucca crown, And twice with vinegar procured from town”’ 19

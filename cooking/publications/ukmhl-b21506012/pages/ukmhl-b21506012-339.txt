327 MULLIGATUNNY. couple of ounces of almonds in a mortar, with a little milk, give it a pinch of sugar, pour a coffee-cup of scalding water over it, and let the mixture stand till wanted. Now, having ascertained that the chicken is quite tender, stir in a dessert-spoonful of good chutney, a tea-spoonful of red currant jelly, and a tea-spoonful of lime-juice, and, after five minutes’ simmering, strain off the whole of the liquid into a bowl. Pick out the nicest pieces of chicken for garnish, brush off any pieces of onion or carrot that may adhere to them, and put them aside. Now, skim the surface of the liquid, and, when quite clear of grease, proceed to thicken it, using a table-spoonful of butter and one of flour, and stirring in the soup slowly. All having been poured in, strain into the sauce-pan the almond milk, using a piece of muslin in order to catch up the bits of nut. Let the mul- ligatunny come to the boil, and serve. The chief points to observe are:—First, the separate boil- ing of the chicken ; and the separate cooking of the paste or powder ; next their amalgamation and the simmering and addition of a pleasant sub-acid; then the straining, skimming and thickening; and lastly, the introduction of the almond milk. Instead of almond milk, co'eoanut milk (the infusion of the nut, I mean) may obviously be used, and a table-spoonful of cream, or a couple of raw yolks of eggs, may be stirred into the tureen with the soup, by de- grees, just before serving. For mutton mulligatunny follow this recipe, substitut- ing a neck or breast of mutton for the chicken. It will be seen from these observations that, while there is no difficulty whatever in making mulligatunny of a supe- rior, as well as of an ordinary kind, it is a soup that demands no little care and attention. Whether it is worth the trouble or not is a question that can only be decided by practical experiment. I have no hesitation in recommend- ing the trial.

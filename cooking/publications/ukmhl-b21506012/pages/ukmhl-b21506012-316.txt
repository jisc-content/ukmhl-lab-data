804 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS, There are also certain green leaves which are undoubt- edly not to he despised as flavouring agents. By their means flavours can be effectively changed. I will speak of them again when discussing the process of curry-making step by step. Then there is that most important item the cocoanut. This, as every one knows, is added to a curry in the form of “milk,” i.e., an infusion produced by scraping the white nutty part of the cocoanut, and soaking the scrap- ings in boiling water. This, squeezed through muslin, is the “ milk” required in curry-making. The quantity to be used depends upon the nature of the curry. Malay curries, for instance, require a great deal of nutty “milk.” The point in connection with this adjunct, however, that must not be missed, is the period at which it should be added. If put in too soon, the value of the nutty juice will be lost,—cooked away, and overpowered by the spicy condi- ments with which it is associated. So we must reserve the “ milk,” as we do cream or the yolk of an egg in the case of a thick soup or rich sauce, and stir it into our curry the last thing just before serving. It should be noted carefully that the water found inside a cocoanut is not cocoanut milk according to the culin- ary vocabulary. The infusion is what is used in curry- making. The strained milk extracted in the same way from pound- ed sweet almonds can be put into a curry very advantage- ously : it may he used alone, or he associated with cocoanut milk. One ounce of the latter, to twelve almonds, will be found a pleasant proportion. When cocoahuts cannot be got, almond milk (lait d’amandes) makes a capital substi- tute : a quarter of a pound of sweet almonds pounded with live hitter ones, moistened with a cnp of boiling milk, or broth, and then strained.

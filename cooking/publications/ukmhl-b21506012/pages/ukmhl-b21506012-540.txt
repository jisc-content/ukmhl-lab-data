Within the case place layers of apples cut small (or sliced ripe plantains) with apricot jam spread between each layer, some lime juice sprinkled over them all, and a good allowance of white sugar : when packed, cover the bottom of the mould with slices of bread and butter, the same as that used for the top and sides, and bake till the bread browns nicely.

Turn it out very care- fully, and let cold custards accompany the charlotte. ■*- Florican roti.

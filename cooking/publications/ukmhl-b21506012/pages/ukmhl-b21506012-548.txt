ON COFFEE-MAKING. 536 A little butter or salad oil is strongly recommended ; it prevents the escape of much of the fragrance of the berry while roasting, and becomes quite dried up before the roasting is finished. The custom in the Indian kitchen is to bake, often to over-bake, the berries and then tunny- cutch ammah pounds them to a dull black powder as fine as flour. The result is a leaden-tinted liquid, acrid in flavour, and repulsive to look upon. Having ground the coffee properly,—it should be rich in aroma, and of a beautiful pale snuff colour—the best coffee-pot to use, after all, is the percolator. Be liberal with the coffee (a tablespoonful for each person), heat it in the oven, also heat the coffee-pot thoroughly, fill the upper chamber of the percolator according to your requirements, ram the hot coffee powder down firmly, and having previ- ously measured the amount of coffee liquid you require, pour boiling water, according to that measurement, in tea- spoonfuls at a time, through the upper strainer upon the powder. The slower the water is added, the more thoroughly the coffee will become soaked, and, the dripping being retarded, the essence will be as strong as possible. As soon as the coffee has run through, pour the rich essence you have obtained into your cups, and for cafe, an lait fill them up with boiling milk, for cafe noir with a little boiling water. As it is scarcely possible for your servant to make coffee with all this care at the end of a dinner party, I recom- mend that the essence be made just before dinner, and kept covered up. For a party of twelve, two brews will be re- quired. At the time it is wanted, the boiling milk imparts quite enough heat to the essence in the case of cafe an lait; and, for black coffee, a gentle re-heating, joins the modicum of boiling water aforesaid, insures a good cup; only do not forget to pass round with it a flask of fine champagne cognac. I have confined my remarks to the method which

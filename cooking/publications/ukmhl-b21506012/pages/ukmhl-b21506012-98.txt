CULINARY JOTTINGS NOR MADRAS. 86 pan, four or five small sauce-pans in sizes, a bain-marie pan to set them in, a small pair of scales, two wooden spoons, a plated spoon of each size, a Hour dredger, a couple of earth- enware bowls, a block tin.perforated strainer and a pointed strainer, both with handles, a wire sieve, a hair sieve, and a mortar. The materials you will call into play from time to time will he :—butter, Hour, eggs, spiced pepper, salt, onions, limes, a few cloves of garlic, spices, the contents of your cruet-stand, say :—Harvey, and mushroom ketchup ; an- chovy, chilli, tarragon, and French vinegars ; besides mus- tard, with pickled gherkins, capers, and red-currant jelly. Carefully-made gravy, broth, or stock, will generally be wanted, for which special provision must be made, but for ordinary sauces, you can generally manage to make enough broth from scraps and trimmings. In doing this you have the consolation of knowing that there is nothing wasted. Sundry spoonfuls of red or white wine will be necessary now and then, and if you wander beyond the Rubicon of moderation to the realms of high art, you will naturally ask as occasion may demand for champagne, truffles, cocks- combs, cream, mushrooms, ham and olives. Of all writers upon cookery none has dealt more clearly with the subject of sauces than Jules Gouffe. His work may appear difficult to understand in places, and his recipes may seem frequently composed upon too large a scale to be useful to mistresses of small establishments, but in the system that he has adopted with regard to this important feature of kitchen work, he has hit the right nail upon the head. He classes as fundamental sauces,—from which nearly the whole category may be said to have sprung,— those well-known names:—Espaynole, Velonte, Allemandc, Bechamel and Poivrade; of these, to my thinking, the first two may be considered by humbler disciples as the parents of the rest.

81 ENTREES—GONCL UDED. The crisp batter in the former, and the pastry in the latter case, supply the necessary accompaniment of the delicate composition each contains. Apart from its being palpably inartistic, there are other reasons which prompt the abolition of sending round vege- tables with entrees. I refer to the time that is wasted in doing so, and the serious complication it adds to the service. Whilst the matter-of-fact objection to the practice is, that by the time they are really wanted for the joint, vegetables that have been hawked about with the entrees are cer- tainly mangled and cold, if not wholly expended, for few people prepare relays of potatoes, &c., to follow those sent up with their side-dishes. Next in regard to garnishing :—As a general rule, our native cooks, assisted I dare say by the butler, are much given to the ornamentation of their entries. Now, whilst fully prepared to pander as much as possible to the “ lust of the eye,” I warn you to be careful lest these efforts to make things look pretty be overdone. Slices of raw cucum- ber should be severely interdicted, for they impart an inky flavour to the entree round which they may be trimmed ; and funny devices cut out of vegetables, and dotted about a dish, should be forbidden, for they suggest to the hyper- critical mind an idea that perhaps fingers have been busily employed in arranging them. Pray do not permit your cook to garnish a croquette with a raw spring onion,—the green stem stripped and curled, and the bulb thrust into the croquette. I have actually seen this done, and once upon a time barely escaped eating the onion, which would have been a sad catastrophe, seeing that I had a most agreeable companion by my side. Let the arrangement of your entries err on the side of simplicity rather than otherwise. To look effective, entries should be arranged well above the level of silver dish upon which they are served.

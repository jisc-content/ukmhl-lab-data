Lightly roast a tender fowl, and cut from it when cold as many nice fillets as you have fonds, shaping them so as to tit the tops of the latter. Make a puree, with the scraps of meat left after trimming the fillets, associating with it some pounded mushroom. From a cold boiled tongue cut as many round slices as you have lillets. Make a good veloute with the bones, skin, &c., assisted by a little fresh meat, and reduce as already explained for chaud-froid sauce. Now moisten the puree, with a little sauce, and fill the cavities of the fonds ; over that put the slices of tongue, some morq puree, and then the fillets. Mask the whole with the thick chaud-froid sauce, let them get cold, trim them neatly, set them on a napkin, and garnish each with a piece of truffle. If carefully made, this makes a nice entree.

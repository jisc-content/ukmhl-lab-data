CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 28 either “ burning curries,” or “ Europe tins” ; — in fact, this is my chief object in writing these jottings. Although I am strongly against the use of tinned things to the exclusion of fresh materials, I by no means wish to interdict such standard groceries as:—pickles, sauces, jams, bacon, cheese, maccaroni, vermicelli, vinegars, flavouring essences, tart fruits, biscuits, isinglass, arrowroot, oatmeal, pearl barley, cornflour, olives, capers, dried herbs, and so on. Grated Parmesan cheese (sold in bottles by Crosse and Blackwell) should never be forgotten, the salad oil should be the best procurable, and no store-room should be without tarragon vinegar, anchovy vinegar, French vinegar, and white wine vinegar. Amongst sauces I consider “ Harvey” the best for general use; Sutton’s “Empress of India,” is a strong sauce with a real flavour of mushrooms; Moir’s sauces, and “ Read- ing sauce,” are very trustworthy, and there are others which, no doubt, commend themselves to different palates, but I denounce “ Worcester sauce” and “ Tapp’s sauce” as agents far too powerful to be trusted to the hands of the native cook. Sutton’s essence of anchovies is said to possess the charm of not clotting, or forming a stoppage in the neck of the bottle. I have a deep respect for both walnut and mushroom ketchup, soy, and tomato conserve. Then as special trifles, we must not forget caviare, olives farcies, and anchovies in oil.

For the same reason I denounce preserved mush- rooms as aforesaid, and those awfully indigestible, flavour- less lumps of giant fungus called cepes ! The cook should be carefully shown the use of flavour- ing essences, and also that of dried herbs. He ought also to be taught never to run out of bread crumbs. Stale

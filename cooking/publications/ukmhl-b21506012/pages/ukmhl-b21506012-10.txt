AUTHOR’S PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION. ArHEN I first began to write about Cookery I flattered *Pc) myself that I had undertaken a very easy, and plea- sant task. I thought that my jottings would be composed cu/rrente calamo, and that I should be able to carry out my project with satisfaction and success. But at the horn- of launching my frail shallop from the shore, I am compassed about with grave doubts concerning its seaworthiness. Alas !:— “ My conscience hath a thousand several tongues, And every tongue brings in a several tale, And every tale condemns me for” a very Icarus. Lo ! the wings of my ambition have melted, and I have fallen into the sea of blighted hope. I am only conscious of failure. I undertook much, what have I performed ? Whilst, however, I frankly acknowledge my many shortcomings, I derive some consolation in trying to believe that, there may nevertheless be a few things recorded in the pages of my book which will be found useful. If this hope be realized, and if the Ladies of Madras—to whom, in all humility, I dedicate the first fruits of my labours—discover here and there a word of assist- ance when perplexed about their daily orders, I shall be bounti- fully rewarded, and the winter of my discontent will indeed be made glorious summer. I have to tender my best acknowledgments to the Proprietors of the Madras Athenceum and Daily Nevus for the permission they have kindly given me to republish my culinary articles which appeared originally in that journal; I have to express my gratitude for the hints I have received from friendly savants in the science of cookery; and to own that I have obtained the most valuable aid from the writings of Jules Goutle, and the “G. C.” Madras, 1st November 1878. - *£IL jtVYYERN.

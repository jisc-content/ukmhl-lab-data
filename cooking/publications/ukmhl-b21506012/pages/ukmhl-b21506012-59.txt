47 THICK SOUPS AND PUBEES, a quarter of a pound of sorrel leaves, a lettuce, and a bunch of parsley, all finely shred, add pepper, salt, half an ounce of flour, and keep stirring for five minutes. You then add a dessert-spoonful of pounded loaf-sugar, and a tea- cupful of the stock, freed from fat, and not coloured. Let the mixture reduce nearly to a glaze, when you gradually stir in about a quart of the stock ; and let the soup simmer for a quarter of an hour. You now must prepare about a dozen pieces of bread cut very thin about two inches long, and an inch wide, taking care that there is crust along one of their long sides, and you must dry these thoroughly in the oven. When it is time to send up the soup, you remove the superfluous fat from it, and set it to simmer for a quarter of an hour. Now, prepare a liaison made as follows :â€”Put the yolks of two eggs in a basin, beat them well as for an omelette adding one ounce of butter. Take the soup off the fire, dip a coffee cup into it, and mix that quantity of it with the egg and butter, adding another cupful when the butter is melted. Put the bread into the tureen, pour the soup over the slices of bread, next gradually add the liaison with one hand, as you stir the soup with the other, and serve in three minutes. This should be enough for six basins. The yolks must be thoroughly freed from white and well beaten, if not, pieces of the white will form in flakes in the boiling soup, and spoil its appearance. This leads me to an important point in some thick soups, and 'purees and that is the addition of cream, or milk with butter and the yolks of eggs. It will be found in some recipes that boiled milk is ordered to be added. The distinction is important : not merely is the risk of curdling avoided, but the flavour imparted to thQpotage is different. All know, for example, how different is the taste of coffee that is made with boiling milk, from that to which cold milk has been added.

OUR CURRIES. 309 till the onions turn a nice yellow brown. Then add a heaped-up table-spoonful of the stock powder, and one of the paste, or, if you have not made the latter, two table- spoonfuls of the powder. Cook the curry-stuff with the onions and butter for a minute or two, slowly, adding by degrees a wine-glassful of the cocoanut milk, and then also by degrees the breakfast-cupful of broth. If you like curry with a thickish gravy stir in a dessert-spoonful of flour with the butter, onions, and curry stuff. The effect of this when simmered for a quarter of an hour will be a rich, thick, curry gravy, or sauce. Omit the flour, and the consistency will be that of ordinary gravy. The stew-pan should now be placed en bain-marie while we proceed to prepare the chicken. Take a saute-pan : melt in it an ounce of butter, or clari- fied beef suet, add a shallot cut up small, and fry for a couple of minutes. Next put the pieces of chicken into the sa%£e-pan, and lightly fry them. As soon as slightly coloured, the pieces of chicken should be transferred to the stew-pan in which they should rest for at least half an hour, marinading, as it were, in the curry gravy. After that, the stew-pan should be placed over a gentle tire, and if the liquid be found insufficient to cover the pieces of chicken, stock, if available, or water, should be added. A gentle simmering process should now be encouraged, during which the bay-leaf,chutney, and sweet-acid should be added. If powder without fresh paste has been used, the pounded almond and cocoanut may now be put in, with a little spice and grated green ginger. The curry gravy should at this period be tasted, and if a little more acid or sweet be found necessary, the proper correction should be made. As soon as the pieces of chicken have become tender, thoroughly stewed that is to say, the remainder of the cocoanut “ milk” should be stirred in, and in three minutes the operation will be complete.

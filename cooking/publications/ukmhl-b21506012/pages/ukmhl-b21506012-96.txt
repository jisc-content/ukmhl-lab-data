84 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. In thus proposing the total abolition of the utterly use- less elaboration of entrees, and the tedious practice of cir- culating them, I feel I am accepting a grave responsibility. Had I not put the system I have explained to very careful test I should hesitate to preach such apparently heterodox opinions. All I would ask is a trial. Remember that the introduction of cutlet moulds, aspic*mignon moulds, china cases, &c., has facilitated this system of separate service to the utmost. Thus we are able to break up our entrees into ‘ portions for one,’ as it were, without difficulty. In- stead of a single mould of creme da volaillc, for instance, we can turn one little creme for each guest by dividing the ■puree into portions, and steaming them in little moulds. The system merely requires a small amount of considera- tion, I think, to commend itself to the mind of the modern hostess.

CULINARY JOTTINGS NOR MADRAS. 310 If a semi-dry or dry curry be required, the gravy must be still further reduced by simmering with the lid off, the pieces of meat being continually stirred about with a wooden spoon to prevent their catching at the bottom of the pan. When the proper amount of absorption has been attained, remove the pan and serve. The fire must be very low for this operation. On the other hand, if a moist curry be the object, additional stock must be putin during the simmer- ing process. Now, those to whom the slipshold method of curry- making, ordinarily followed by native cooks, is familiar, will, perhaps, think that the process I have recommended is needlessly troublesome. The separate frying of the chicken, the period of rest in the bciin-mciric, dc., may seem to them unnecessary. I am, however, perfectly confident that in order to produce a dish of a superior class, we must be prepared to take all this trouble, bringing an enlightened system of cookery to bear upon the subject. The condi- ments and ingredients which, so to speak, provide the curry flavour, are after all mere accessories. I look upon a chicken curry as a fricassee, or blanquette ci V Indienne, and consider that it should certainly be treated according to the prin- ciples of scientific cookery. What is worth doing at all, is worth doing well. The soaking of meat in the liquid curry-stuff is an im- portant point, especially when previously cooked meat is to be curried. Remember how much better a salmis or a hash tastes if the meat of which it is composed has been marinaded for an hour or so, before being finally heated up, in the carefully-made gravy or sauce composed for it. This, I think, accounts for an opinion I once beard ex- pressed by a friend of undoubted ability in culinary criti- cism, to the effect that he always found curries of a certain kind better when warmed up and served as a rechauffe than when presented for the first time.

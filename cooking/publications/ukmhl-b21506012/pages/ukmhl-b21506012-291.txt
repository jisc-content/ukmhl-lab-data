279 PASTRY-MAKING, ET CETERA. pression. Think of the cold pigeon-pie at home, and you will remember no puff pastry : your mind’s eye'will rather picture a close crust about half, or three-quarters of an inch thick, glazed externally, with egg, and with the feet of the birds peeping invitingly from the centre : a firm plain paste that you cut out in a whole piece without its breaking into fragments ; pale brown and crusty externally, and soft and white internally, with hits of jelly adhering to it. Well, that is the kind of crust that I am so anxious to impart to Ramasamy, for which the following recipe is, I think, reli- able :— Put one pound of well-dried and sifted hour on the slab, or in an enamelled basin ; make a hollow in the centre, and work into it a quarter of a pound of cold clarified suet cut into pieces, adding a tea-spoont’ul of salt. When mix- ed, sprinkle over it as much iced water as will bind it thoroughly : dredge some flour over the slab, and roll the paste out half an inch thick. Cut up another quarter of a pound of clarified suet, and dot it over the surface of the paste, fold the paste over it, and roll it out again very thin; fold it in three, set in the ice-box for ten minutes, give it three more turns, and then roll it out half an inch thick when it may be cut to cover the pie. A French savoury pie-crust is made in this way: Empty a pound of flour into a bowl, and rub lightly into it half a pound of clarified suet; add a tea-spoonful of salt, and com- plete the dough by adding to it by degrees a quarter of a pint of water in which two eggs have been beaten. Roll the paste out, give it two or three turns, and finish it as ia the foregoing receipt. A plainer crust can be made by reducing the suet, and a richer and more volatile one by adding a couple of ounces or so of iced butter. Raised pie-crust, or number three, is perhaps less under- stood by Ramasamy than the other kinds that I have men-

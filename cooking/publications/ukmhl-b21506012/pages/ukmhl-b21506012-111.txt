If made on the plains, early in the afternoon, the sauce- boat should he placed in the ice-box ; hut, to he successful, mayonnaise sauce ought, if possible, to he made as near the time of service as possible. When cream is used, it takes the place of the oil, hut if only a little can he spared, a des- sert-spponful may be added as a last touch to the sauce I have described with good effect. All mayonnaise sauces should he iced, if only for a few minutes. The points in this sauce to he noted are, the order in which the various ingredients should be introduced, the use of the raw yolks in conjunction with the hard-boiled (they produce the thick creaminess you want), the liberal use of good oil, and the addition last of all, in sparing quantity, of the tarragon vinegar. You do not want an acid sauce at all, remember. English cooks, as a rule, ruin their maynnaise and salad dressings, by measuring the oil anti vinegar they use in equal portions! No artist measures these ingredi- ents.* You might as well expect a painter to tell you the number of grains of the colours he used in painting a pic- ture. You must not omit a little onion, hut whilst permit- ting the flavour “ scarce suspected to animate the whole,” you must on no account permit the “ atoms to lurk .within the bowl”—the ladies in Sydney Smith’s days were per- haps less critical in the matter of this fragrant bulb, than - are our fair enslavers in the present year of grace. Tartare sauce is the same as the above, without the use of hard-boiled eggs : raw yolks alone should be used, and the oil and vinegar should be added in the following pro- portions ; a tea-spoonful of the latter, to two table-spoonfuls * Gouffe’s calculation represents the quantity of vinegar as barely one-eighth of the oil.—W. -

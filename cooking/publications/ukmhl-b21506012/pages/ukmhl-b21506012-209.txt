THE SAVOURY OMELETTE. 197 smoked by being hung over a lire constantly replenished with damp coir, or other fuel. After this, it should be hung in the cook-room over the fire, and it will be ready for the table the third evening. If you can get fresh roe for your omelette so much the better ; if not, Madras pre- served roe, well soaked and fried in butter, will be found an excellent substitute. Omelettes may be cooked aux fines herbes, served upon a bed of tomato puree■, and dusted over with grated cheese. They may also be laid upon a puree of green peas, or of spinach. They may be improved with minced game, and be associated effectively with mince of any kind. Chopped mushrooms or truffles (previously cooked, minced, and toss- ed in butter) are, of course, very delicious additions to them; and oysters may be introduced in the same way. Savoury omelettes are sent up with rich Espagnole, Perigueux, and Becha mel sauces,and may contain some finel y minced kidney stewed in champagne. Almost all fish, prawns, lobster, &c., go well with them, and whether simple or elaborate, plain or rich, an omelette rarely fails,—if properly made,—to win appreciation, and be thankfully accounted for. Concerning sweet omelettes advice will be given here- after. i -e»-

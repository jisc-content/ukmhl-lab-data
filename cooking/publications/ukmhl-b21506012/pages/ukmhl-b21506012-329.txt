C UBRIE S—CONTIN TIED. 317 haps appreciated by our forefathers who adopted an almost Oriental method of life. The best ktibab, to my mind, is one made of tender mutton or veal, and treated as fol- lows :— Cut the mutton into thickish pieces, about an inch square' and half an inch thick; cut out of some slices ol good bacon some pieces an inch square also, but about a quarter the thickness of the mutton ; cut up some pieces of parboiled white onion upon the same pattern as the bacon, and some thin slices of green ginger to match.

1 26 • CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. neatly in the shape required with tapes, into boiling salted water to begin with. After five minutes at this extreme tem- perature, add enough cold water to reduce the heat to half- boiling. Like the pot-au-feu the contents of the vessel should now be watched, and skimmed, and the flavouring vegeta- bles, and herbs, added when the scum has been removed. The water, let me observe, must at first be boilimj ; when re- duced, it should be as hot as you can bear to touch, and the early stage of returning to the actual boil should be retard- ed as much as possible. The high temperature at first is essential to harden the outside of the meat, and retain the juices, and nutriment. Boiled meat at the English dinner table is often spoiled by being “ golloped,” as cooks say, that is, done too fast. Meat thus maltreated cannot fail to be tough. You must simmer your boiled leg of mutton, just as carefully as you would the meat of a pot-au-feu. When once boiling-point has been at- tained, ease off the fire a little, and endeavour to obtain a uniform heat below the pot that will just keep its surface, as it were, alive. An occasional bubble, is what you want, with gentle motion, the water muttering to you, not jabber- ing and fussing, as it does when boiling. If you follow this process, you will never have to send a boiled leg of mutton away from the table because of its being too underdone in side to be fit to eat. Remember that the liquor in which a joint has been boil- ed is weak stock. If reduced by being simmered with the lid of the cooking vessel removed, it can be turned to account in many ways, especially for the enrichment of white sauce. It thus can at the time be used with propriety as a basis for celery, onion, turnip, or other white puree to accompany the joint. The common error made by cooks in England, just as much as by our Ramasamy, consists in their keeping up the high pressure too long, whereby the outside of the joint is

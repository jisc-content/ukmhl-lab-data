156 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. passed closely over the surface of the dish will brown it nicely. For those who do not like cheese, the following “ ait gra- tin'' is to be recommended :—arrange your pieces of cauli- flower as before explained, strew over them some fine stale bread-crumbs, with some olives, a few capers, and an an- chovy chopped up small; pour over this a cupful of hot melted butter, hake for ten minutes, and serve. Salad oil is better than melted butter, but I fear that my country- men will shrink from such a ‘ foreign’ suggestion. Spinach (epinards) is a thing that we can get in the most trying weather, and with common care no entremets dc legumes are more delicate than those which we can achieve with this vegetable. Having selected two pounds of leaves carefully, wash them well, blanch them by plunging them for a couple of minutes in scalding water, drain, cool, and chop them up. Put into a stew-pan one ounce of butter, three-quarters of an ounce of flour, and a pinch of salt, and one of sugar; stir this over the fire for three minutes, then add the spinach leaves ; stir round for five minutes, and moisten with a coffee-cupful of milk, gravy, or stock ; stir for two minutes more, and then add a breakfast-cupful of the milk or stock, stir for five minutes and take the pan from the fire. Now, mingle a little butter, with the spinach, or give it a spoon- ful of cream, or the yolk of an egg dissolved in a little milk, then turn it out upon a good hot dish, garnish it with sippets of fried bread, fleurons of puff pastry, or short-bread biscuits specially baked for the dish, and serve. I mix a little grated cheese with the short-bread paste which I think goes well with the spinach, and some give the least suspicion of sugar ; I think that the savoury method is the better of the two.

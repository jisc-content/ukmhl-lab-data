97 SAUCES. and have butter enough to spare for the undertaking. I strongly advise my friends who reside on the Neilgherries to make this sauce (a little goes a long way mind) for their globe artichokes; one table-spoonful is enough for one arti- choke, and the plates should be really hot.* Note that the saucepan should be removed from the fire before, the butter has quite liquefied. The heat of the sauce- pan will complete the melting. This is necessary to pre- serve the creaminess of the butter, which would be lost if it were allowed to become an oil over the fire. Hollandaisc made with eggs is known abroad as Hollan- claise jaune. Horse-Radish Sauce. “ Horse-radish sauce” (sauce raifort) is the standard ad- junct to our national food, “ the roast beef of old England,” and beef in India cries out for its help far more piteously than its rich relation far away. Horse-radish grows well at Ootacamund, and I once grew some with success at Banga- lore, but the scraped root of the moringa, or “ drum-stick” tree, provides so good a substitute that we may rest con- tented with a sauce thus composed :— To serve hot:— scrape as finely as you can a cupful of the root shavings, simmer them in half a pint of ch^ken broth ; when done, thicken the broth, custard-wise, with the yolks of three eggs beaten up with a dessert-spoonful of tarragon vinegar; add pepper, salt, and a very little grated nutmeg, and serve in a sauce-boat. A richer recipe suggests the addition, off the fire, of a cof- fee-cupful of cream with the yolks of the eggs, and then to let the sauce remain on the fire, cn bain-marie, stirring well until it is very hot (but not boiling) and serving it in a hot sauce-boat. * A tea-spoonful of anchovy vinegar is in this case better than lime-juice.—W. 9

MENU FOR A PARTY OF EIGHT. 439 Gnocchetti. This receipt was given to me by a lady who has resided nearly all her life in Italy. Take two tumblers of broth or milk and put the liquid in a stew-pan on the fire with one ounce of butter, a pinch of salt, and two of pepper. Boil, take off the fire, add four ounces of sifted flour, and mix well, adding two ounces of grated Parmesan cheese: stir over the fire for one minute, remove the sauce-pan, breaking into it three large or four small eggs, one after the other, and stirring con- tinually. Divide the paste you now have got into small portions rolling them about the size of walnuts ; put these into a buttered saute-pan, pour boiling milk over them, simmer for five minutes, and drain on a sieve. Now arrange a layer of the gnocchetti on a dish, sprinkle with Parmesan, add another layer, and sprinkle, moisten with a good sauce blanche, cover all with a final layer of Parmesan, set in the oven to colour, and serve very hot.

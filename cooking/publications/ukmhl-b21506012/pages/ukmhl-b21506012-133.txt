BRAISING AND ROASTING. 11 three Bombay onions the size of Badminton balls, wash, peel, and boil them in two waters to extract the acrid flavour.

Add to this, five ounces of bread-crumbs, and dust over the mixture a liberal allowance of spiced pepper (which I give later on) and salt: when nice- ly worked together, add an ounce of butter or suet cut into dice and bind the ingredients with three eggs, it will now be ready for use. The proportions of this stuffing may be re- lied on : it is mild, yet pleasantly flavoured, and, “ leaves not a trace of sad memory behind.” Goose stuffing is made in a similar way, and the composi- tion is a pleasant addition to some joints of pork: let my friends on the Hi!Is try a loin, honed, rolled, and stuffed with this, and roasted over a bright fire.

In all stuffings, and forcemeats, whether required for roast, boiled, or braised poultry; for the dainty galantine or the savoury pie, there are few things more useful to have at hand than “ spicecl pepper.” It saves an infinity of trouble, and is an invaluable thing for a thousand dishes.

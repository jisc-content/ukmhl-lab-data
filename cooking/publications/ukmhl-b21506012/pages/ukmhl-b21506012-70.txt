58 GULIN ABY JOTTINGS FOB MADBAS. Boiling. After having thoroughly cleansed, and wiped the fish, rub it over with a little vinegar, and place it on the drainer of the fish-kettle, so that when done it may be lifted out without risk of breaking up. Put plenty of salt over the fish, and a dessert spoonful of vinegar into the water in which it is to be boiled. Let the water be boiling, and in sufficient quantity to cover the fish. Place the kettle on a brisk fire, and boil the fish as fast as possible. Skim off all scum that rises, and take care to suspend operations, the moment the fish is done. Overboiled fish is nasty to eat, and ugly to look upon : underdone fish is unfit for human food. The cookery books allow ten minutes per pound as a fair average of the time required for this operation, but so much depends upon the thickness of the fish to be boiled, that the cook should test it now and then with the point of a skewer, and as soon as the flesh parts easily from the bone, let him decide that it is ready. The old fashioned system of putting fish into cold water, and cooking it slowly, has altogether exploded. Such a method abstracts nearly all the nutritive material, and if it be reduced afterwards the water forms when cold a strong gelatinous mass. Even fast boiling takes much of this property from the fish. It is accordingly a manifest advantage to reduce the water in which the fish was boil- ed, and use this when making the sauce to accompany it. Never let your fish, after it is done, remain soaking in the water in which it has been cooked; drain it at once, or it will become what cooks call “ woolly.” If ready too soon, let it rest on the drainer over the hot kettle, and cover it with a napkin. As a rule the Native cook dresses his fish far too soon. The keeping of it hot till required ruins it. Every effort should be made to teach him to go by the clock, and not put the fish to cook till the hands show him that he has just time to do it nicely.

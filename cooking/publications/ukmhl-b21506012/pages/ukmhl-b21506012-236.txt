224 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. chopped olives, onions, and a minced anchovy among the stalks. Here is a noble recipe for a mayonnaise a la gouffe for which I have to thank a fair friend once well known in Madras. In an oval, or round cylinder-mould placed upon ice, pour a very little well made liquid aspic jelly; as soon as it is all but set, dispose neatly therein a number of little balls of green butter, and prawn butter (q.v.) alternately, cover them with some more of the jelly, set them, and repeat the process in layers as it were until the mould is packed. You mrfst ice the balls of butter before you put them in, and alternate them differently in each layer, so that the colours may be checkered. The mould can now be left in ice to consolidate thoroughly. When turned out, you can garnish it externally with balls of the same fancy butters, turned olives, strips of anchovy, and hard-boiled yolks of egg, and pack its hollow centre with the fish, or fowl, of which your mayonnaise is composed. Lettuce leaves culled from the golden heart should crown the centre, and be arranged with some whole boiled prawns in their shells round the margin of the dish outside the mould. The mould of jelly and its sauce should be kept in the ice-box till the nick of time before serving, when (in this case) the latter should be poured over the contents in the centre of the mould. For aspic jelly, vide Menu, No. 9. My up-country readers have only to make their fancy butter from tinned lobster meat, instead of prawns, to turn out just as grand a .mayonnaise as this. For fancy butters, please follow me in the next chapter.

Chicken, ox and sheep’s tongues, tender mutton, ham, bacon, oysters, pigeons, turkey, rabbit, the livers of all poultry, of rabbits, and game,—whether previously cooked or not,—provide materials out of which these entrees can be made.

If you preserve your own ox tongues in this country, and keep one generally ready for use, you will have a very valuable thing to fall back upon for “ made ” entrees.

But even without this assistance, a little jar of the plain composition, made as * Use the white breast-meat of a cold roast chicken if you cannot get veal in this country. The melted bacon must be pounded with the liver.—W.

The latter should be scraped free from their fibrous skin, cut into four inch lengths, and stewed in blanc as described for celery a la mocllc. • In order to blanch the artichoke stems, it is necessary, after the vegetable has been gathered, to bend the shoot down, and earth it up : the parts thus covered turn white, and in this way you obtain an excellent substitute for car- doons. Salsify, (salsifis ouscorsondre) isan edible root which we ought to grow abundantly in India. There are two kinds of this vegetable :—the white and the black. The former is called salsifis, the latter, which is by far the better, scorso- nata. The one is gathered in its first year’s growth, the other not until it is two years old. I do not know whether any of our horticultural societies havq yet introduced sal- sify or not ; for the benefit of those who, like myself, have grown it in India, I take the opportunity of recommending the previous recipe (viz.:—a la mocllc) as equally applicable to the gently stewed roots of this plant. Salsify has a very perceptible flavour of the oyster (is indeed called the “ oyster plant ” in America), and forms several delicious an tramets. The roots peel easily when boil- ed, and when mashed the pulp is as white as snow. Simply mashed with cream, and a tea-spoonful of anchovy sauce, with a covering of bread-crumbs strewn over it, and a little meltedbutter, then baked till brown, and servedin coquilles, salsify presents an exact imitation of “oysters scalloped.” Salsify puree with cream can be served wherever oyster sauce is recommended,—-with a tasty fillet of beef for in- stance,—it makes a most toothsome patty, and as a white soup (pu/rde) it can be sent up as a bisque d’hultres. Never peel black salsify (scorsondre) before boiling, for, if

CAMP COOKERY—(OUR FRESH-WATER FISH). 351 sauce over it, and serve. Be very careful in moving the fish : indeed, if you think that it may break during that operation, leave it alone, pour the sauce over it, and wrap a napkin round the baking-dish in which it should be served. If the fish be over three pounds in weight it is well worth while to roast it. The preparations in regard to cleaning, drying, and stuffing are the same as those just described for baking. The operation of spitting, however, requires great care, for if carelessly done, and the fish be at all over-roast- ed,- the chances are that it will fall off the spit, and break to pieces. To guard against this catastrophe you should make a cradle for the fish in this way :— Take four strips of thinly split bamboo, cut them a little longer than the fish, lay them in rows four inches apart, and tie across them, at in the following diagra m ntervals of six inches, four tapes as The tapes, which are represented by the dotted lines, should be knotted to each strip of bamboo at the points of intersection. Thus we have a cradle large enough for a fish eighteen inches long, and a foot or a little more in girth. It is secured to the spit by the ends of the tapes, which are left over for that purpose. The arrangement is in principle something like the cradle which is placed round a horse’s neck to prevent his tearing himself when under treatment for a wound.

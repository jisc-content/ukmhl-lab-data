IVIBISTTJ INTO. I'V- For a party of eight, Consomme de poisson. Filets de pomfret a la poulette. Croquettes de canard a la Bordelaise. Cotelettes de mouton au creme de fromage. Chapon au chou-fleur. Mousse de topinambours. Gelee de marasquin aux fruits. Charlotte a la Sicilienne. 1.—This is a clear soup flavoured with fish. A crab for instance answers the purpose admir- ably, but any fish will do. Let us take the crab. Make ordinary clear consomme for the number you expect. One large crab or two small ones will suffice for eight basins.* Boil the crab : drain and clean it: pick out the flesh, saving that of the claws for garnishing. Pound the rest of the meat and shells in a mortar, put the whole of it into the consomme you have made, with a little bag containing a quarter ounce of dried basil, and boil gently for half an hour, strain through a fine sieve, or tamis cloth,—it should now be bright and clear,—heat it up again, * Crabs being cheap, I recommend that the claws and legs be alone taken for soup; you can then use the broth they yield without risk. Cut them off and simmer gently till all their flavour has been extracted, blend this broth with the consommi, and proceed as above,—W.

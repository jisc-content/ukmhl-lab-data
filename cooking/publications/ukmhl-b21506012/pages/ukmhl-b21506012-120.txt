108 CULINABY JOTTINGS FOB MAD BAS. using, a gill of cream may be finally stirred into the sauce as you take it from the bain-marie. Veloute is exactly like this omitting the cream when you add the stock, and also the chopped mushrooms : it is there- fore less expensive and not quite so rich. Allemande is veloute flavoured with chicken essence, and chopped mushrooms : it is thickened with yolks of eggs, and no cream is needed in its composition. With these for your bases, you can make the following rich white sauces :—oyster, lobster, supreme, veniticnne, poivracle blanche, rich soubise, champignons blanches, puree clc celeri, and other rich white purees. In fact all sauces which, in either simple form, are made with sauce blanche, or sauce blonde, may be served in a superior manner by using veloute or bechamel as their ground work. I have already described the making of chicken, or rather fowl essence : the same principles being observed, you can obtain valuable flavouring gravies from all poul- try bones, especially from those of a turkey. The giblets should never he thrown away, for they assist a gravy greatly. In like manner game bones are very valuable. Essences of mushrooms, of truffles, and ham, are obtained by stewing them cut into small pieces in consomme. A. dash of Medeira or sound Marsala is necessary with game essences, while chablis and sauterne give assistance to fish essences which are used, of course, to improve sauces like creme cl’anchois, creme clc crevettes, and all fish sauces. Reduced vinegar, i.c., vinegar boiled until half or more of its quantity has evaporated, and wine similarly reduced, produce valuable flavouring agents. Mirepoix is a strong broth made from meat and vege- tables, flavoured with wine and sweet herbs, and strained, but not thickened. It is used as a flavouring medium.

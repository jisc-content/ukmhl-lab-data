THICK SOUPS AND PUREES. 53 which you spread your napkin before you after a day with the hounds, a trudge after wild partridges, or a long drive through the keen frosty air of some by-gone Christmastide! These soups are what house-keepers call “ rich,” for in their composition you must employ port, or Madeira, red currant jelly, butter, yolks of eggs, &c. One of the greatest cooks of the age propounds half a bottle of old port for his hare soup ! and all game soups take a goodly share of wine. The points to observe in the making of these purees are, first, to get every atom of flavour you can of the bones, scraps, and giblets, which is done by simmering them watchfully in stock.

Next to blend the pulp of the game with the stock in the way I have previously described. And lastly, to follow with accuracy whatever recipe you have taken as regards the flavouring elements. Do not leave out anything if you can possibly manage it. Dried sweet herbs, (thyme and marjoram,) are as necessary in game soups, as is basil in turtle ; and red currant jelly is indispensable. Spice is often mentioned in recipes for these soups. I do not recom- mend it. In fact, beyond the two cloves inserted in the onion used for the stock, I would carefully omit it. As I intend to give detailed instructions for game purees in their turn in my menus, I will not pursue the subject any further in this chapter. Neither will I discuss the treatment of tinned soups just yet, for I shall reserve that branch of Indian soup-making for consideration hereafter in a chapter devoted to u Camp cookery.” I will conclude these observations with a recipe for a vegetable stock which, by itself, is a pleasantly flavoured soup ; mingled with purees it takes the place of beef or

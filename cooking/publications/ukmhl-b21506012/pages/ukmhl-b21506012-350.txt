338 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. drops of celery essence, a table-spoonful of mushroom ket- chup, a tea-spoonl'ul of sugar, and another tea-spoonful of salt. Now, let the pan come to the boil again, and then reduce the fire for the simmering stage which should continue till the onion is soft. When the pieces of fowl are nice and tender, the broth is ready : long cooking will avail nothing : so lift up your pan, and strain off the broth into a bowl, it will be beautifully bright and clear ; slight- ly tinted with caramel (page 35) and served hot, with a dessert-spoonful of marsala, and a dissolved dessert-spoon- ful of “Julienne,” this consomme rlc volatile will be found sufficient for two hungry men. When used in connection with a tin of soup, the broth should be poured from the bowl into the pan again, and the tin of soup added to it a slow process of boiling should now be commenced, during which any scum, the soup may throw up, should be studiously removed, for all tinny im- purities will thus begot rid of: when all but boiling, a table-spoonful of marsala should be added, and the soup served. The pieces of fowl if not over-cooked,—which let me point out is quite unnecessary,—may be served in the form of fricassee, or be bread-crumbed or dipped in batter, and fried, and served with maccaroni and tomato conserve. Very valuable stock, remember, can be made from fresh mutton scraps, the scrag-end, feet, and trimmings; and even cold roast mutton bones are useful. The broth should, whenever possible, be assisted by bacon skin, bones, and trimmings, minced lean bacon is most valuable, a thick slice of Brunswick or Bologna sausage, and a chicken, or any game you can spare. With this, if onions, any vege- tables, and peai'l barley be available, you can make a capital hotchpotch. If not, mix a tin of that soup with it, or a dessert spoonful of Julienne. * If a thick soup, like mockturtle for instance, you must thicken the consomme with a little flour and butter.—W.

The last, most worthy, recipe of all, —♦— JJT.T is not generally known, my clear Wyvern,” writes (4l my learned, and very kind friend C. S., “ that the fumes of sulphur prevent the rapid decomposition of animal matter, and that a fine tender mutton chop can be had, even in the hottest weather, by exposing the joint from which it is cut to the fumes of burning pastiles, placed in an air-tight box, for two or three hours after the meat is brought home from market. A joint thus treated will keep perfectly for thirty-six hours, even in Madras, and be found deliciously tender the day after it was purchased. The pastiles should be composed as follows Eight parts of powdered sulphur. One and a half part of powdered, charcoal. A quarter part of powdered saltpetre. Mix all together, and make them into pastiles, adding just enough gum water for the purpose; shape them like pyramids, and dry them in the sun. A roomy box,—say a three-dozen case,—furnished with hooks to suspend the meat by, with a closely fitting door, and all crevices filled with putty, and pasted over with strips of strong paper, is the sort of receptacle you require for the fumigation. Suspend the meat, place two or three pastiles below it, light them, close the door securely, and leave it till the pastiles have burnt out, and the fumigation has been thoroughly effected.”

194 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. sides of the pan be sloped as I have described : it will not require folding. 10. Three-quarters of a minute is ample time for the whole operation, if the pan be properly hot when the mix- ture is poured into it. 11. Have the hot dish close by the fire, so that you can turn the omelette into it instantcr. A little melted butter, with some chopped parsley, may, with advantage, be put into the dish. 12. It is above all things necessary to have a very brisk fire under the pan while the omelette is being cooked. A braiser filled with live charcoal is the best kind of fire, and the fan must be vigorously plied from the moment that the mixture is poured into the pan. I have nevertheless cooked many a good omelette over a spirit lamp, and also over a gas jet. A light, and very eatable omelette can be turned out by Ramasamy-’s method if it be slightly modified in accordance with the canons of intelligent cookery. I have said that he beats his whites of egg separately and goes on to make a sort of batter. Now the beating of the whites is not by itself an ei'ror ; it is his subsequent form of proceeding that spoils his work. If the following process be followed a good result will be obtained :— Break four eggs carefully, and separate the yolks from the whites, have ready your fines herbes as in the former recipe, a clean and roomy omelette-pan, and half an ounce of butter. Whisk the whites to a stiff froth ; to it add the yolks well mixed, and the fines herbes; pour the mix- ture into your pan which should be prepared as already explained, let the omelette set, and roll it over quickly with its centre scarcely formed, into the dish. In this case the omelette rises like a souffle, and if rapidly treated turns out very light indeed.

222 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. measure. As soon as you have got a creamy, well-flavoured sauce to suit your fancy, strain it through the little block tin strainer to get rid of every lump, and the little bits of onion. This should be done over the sauce-boat, which should be put into the ice-box or upon a bed of crushed ice, as soon as it is filled. If you want a thick sauce of this kind, lightly flip the oil with the raw eggs adding it by degrees, and the mixture will soon be stiff enough, especially if you put in another raw yolk. Use French mustard (moutard de maille) in preference to English.- Never use Worcester sauce on any account whatever. N.B.—In all rich salad, or mayonnaise dressings, cream may be used instead of oil, or be added to a made sauce as a finishing touch. I recommend very strongly that the salad, nicely dressed in its bowl, and the icy-cold sauce in its boat, should be preserved separately, and handed round together. If you mix a salad of this kind before dinner, and let it soak, it deteriorates considerably before the time comes for its ser- vice. Cover up your nicely selected well dried lettuce leaves, &c., and they will be crisp, if handed round with their sauce following them, on the arrival of “ the roast.” This advice holds good with mayonnaise. The meat or fish of which the dish may be composed becomes sodden, and dead, and the green accompaniments fall off in crispness if bathed for any length of time in dressing. Besides, after the meal, a mixed mayonnaise or salad is wasted, whereas one with which the sauce was separately served may be turned to account. You have in the former case only to pick the meat out of the lettuce leaves, and place it on a separate dish. Theplain salad I first mentioned must, of course, be mixed the very last thing before dinner, unless you can boldly rise

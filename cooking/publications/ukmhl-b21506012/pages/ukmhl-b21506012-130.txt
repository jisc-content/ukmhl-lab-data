118 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. Stuffings. If permitted to follow the customs of the cookroom, the uneducated Ramasamy will send up your roast fowl—hardly as large as an English chicken,—with its breast strangely puffed out and distorted with a horrible compound which be calls “ stuffing.” This you carefully avoid eating onac- count of its nastiness, hut few, I take it, boldly order their cooks never to perpetrate the atrocity again, being under an impression that stuffing is necessary in roasting poultry. The only birds that should he stuffed in the crop are tur- keys, and exceptionally fine capons. Who amongst you ever saw a roast fowl in England, stuffed ? The barbarous practice has become common out here, and ought to be put down as utterly wrong. Moisture, which is so necessary in roasting, should, as I have already observed, he secured by either larding the fowl with fat bacon, or tying a slice of bacon over the breast. I however advocate a stuffing for the inside of a fowl intended for braising as follows :—well mashed potato, and boiled sweet onion, in the proportion of two-thirds of the former to one-third of the latter. The mashed potato, of course, cofitains butter, spiced pepper, a little weak broth and the 3 oik of an egg, and helps to preserve the juiciness of the bird ; the flavour it imparts too is, I think, agreeable. This with a little chopped sage may he used for ducks. Do not use milk with the mashed potato for it turns the stuffing sour.

But this cannot be called “ stuffing.” A turkey, on the other hand, requires carefully made force- meat, and, as you all know, there are many varieties thereof. Truffles, and chestnuts form the epicurean stuffings of the roast turkey, and one of oysters is propounded for the boil-

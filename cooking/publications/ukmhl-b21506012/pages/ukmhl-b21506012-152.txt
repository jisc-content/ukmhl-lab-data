140 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS, them with salt, and place a wet cloth on the top of them. The sauce-pan should be then put on the fire, and in about half an hour, drawn upon the kitchener (at the side of the fire) to remain hot till the potatoes are wanted.” Choose potatoes as much of a size as you can for boiling : do not boil a large and two small ones together if you can help it. When potatoes are boiled in the ordinary fashion, that is, placed in a sauce-pan with a due allowance of salt, and covered well with cold water, they should be lifted, and drained after half an hour’s cooking, and then be returned to the hot, empty sauce-pan, covered with a wet cloth, and placed at the margin of the fire to keep hot, and to dry them- selves thoroughly. In boiling potatoes in the ordinary method, it is a good thing to check the rate of cooking, every now and then, by adding a little cold water, and the time ought to he,—after boiling commences,-—from eighteen to twenty minutes. “ Steamed potatoes ” should be scrubbed, picked, and wip- ed, after having been set for five minutes or so in cold-water. Then place them in the steamer over boiling water, and let them steam till done: the time will vary according to size from twenty to forty minutes : the fork (or a skewer) should go through them easily, if not, they are not done. A minute in a fast oven will dry them if needful. New potatoes should be scrubbed, rubbed with a coarse cloth, and boiled or steamed according to taste : you cannot expect them to be very mealy, of course, and with some peo- ple their waxiness constitutes their chief charm. Having boiled or steamed our potato satisfactorily, let us see in how many ways we may serve it, presuming that we have turned it out as flourily as we could desire. First, of course, it may be sent up plainly, either in its skin, or crumbled into the dish made hot to receive it.

MENU FOE A PAETY OF EIGHT. 383 a pot of strawberry jam with sufficient berries11' ^ °f straw' water to make enough syrup to fill your mould, strain it, colour it a rosy pink with a drop or two of cochineal, and add a glass of liqueur or brandy ; melt an ounce of gelatine, and strain it, when cold, into the syrup, stirring well:—decorate a plain mould with almonds, put it on ice, and pour your strawberry syrup into it by degrees; coyer it over, and set it in ice for two hours ; turn it out, and serve it with cold custard in glasses, or iced cream. If in season, you can, of course, make the syrup with fresh strawberries ; and when filling the mould, you may add to its attractiveness by setting layers of whole fruit (fresh or preserved) in it in the style of a jelly. Iced cream should accompany. 9.—Make a cake case (see Menu No. IV) with finger biscuits, or slices of sponge cake and Iced apneot cream |e^ ft get firm. Mix a rich custard, pudding. 0 flavour it with a dash of liqueur, and whip it well with half an ounce of dissolved gelatine. Work the mixture in the ice pale until it begins to freeze well, then stir into it a good allowance of chopped crystallized apri- cots and a coffee-cupful of rich cream well whipped. Mix well in the ice pail, and then fill a mould with the frozen mixture, completely covering it with lumps of ice. It should be left thus for an hour, when it will be ready to turn out and serve. The mould should be just large enough to be covered by the cake case. Note.—To adapt this menu according to the new regime, serve the saddle after the fish, and instead of gelantines of quails, let the birds be roasted with a slice of fat bacon over their breasts, and sent round with bread sauce, fried crumbs, and filbert chips of potato. A plain salacle or water- cress should accompany the rot. Instead of the icedjnulding an apricot cream ice should be presented at dessert, being en- tered at the end of the menu thus:—Glace,—cr&med’abricots.

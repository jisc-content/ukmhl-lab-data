104 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. With regard to Espetgnolc which, as many of you no doubt know, is a rich, thick, bvowii sauce, I would simplify Gouffe’s receipt as follows :— Espagnole. (a) . Get ready a couple of sheep’s trotters chopped in pieces, with a ham or bacon bone, or a few lean slices of either, any raw cutlet trimmings you may have, and two pounds of beef gravy meat cut into squares. (b) . Now cut up a couple of onions and throw them into a stew-pan with an ounce of butter, fry them a golden yellow, then add a breakfast-cupful of broth, or water, and the pieces of meat previously prepared ; shake the pan every now and then, and let the meat take colour. (c) . Now, add water enough to cover the ‘meat, &c., completely, reduce the fire, and let the contents of the pan come slowly to the boil, skimming carefully during that period. (d) . When the surface seems nicely clear of grease and scum, add another onion, with two carrots sliced, two leeks, a turnip, about an ounce of celery, a clove of garlic, half a dozen pepper corns, a spoonful of dried sweet herbs tied up in a bag, a bunch of parsley, some burnt sugar colouring, and salt to taste. No spice. (c). As soon as the vegetables have been cooked, remove the pan from the fire, pick out the vegetables, and place it so that it may simmer slowly for a couple of hours. Now, lift it up, and strain off your gravy: there should be quite a pint and a half of it. (/). Next, take a sauce-pan and melt two ounces of but- ter at the bottom of it, stir in two ounces of flour and make a roux, when the colour satisfies you, add by degrees, stir- ring as you do so, the pint or so of the strong gravy that you strained from the stew-pan.

109 SA UCES—CONCL TIDED. D’ Uxcllcs, ov fines herbcs, is composed as follows :—Chop up six ounces of fresh mushrooms, six ounces of fresh parsley, and two ounces of shallot: put the minced shallot into a stew-pan with two ounces of fresh butter and a sea- soning of salt and black pepper ; fry on a brisk fire for five minutes, add the minced mushrooms and parsley, fry for five minutes more, and put the mixture in a jar for use as required.

This should be made when mushrooms are procurable dur- ing the rains, it will be found most useful as a flavouring and finishing agent. Thickenings.

You must then employ a liaison or thickening to correct the error in the manner described for thick soups at page 40.

For a brown sauce brown roux, with brown gravy. In either case the liaison mixed separately very smoothly is stirred through a strainer into the sauce off the fire : when this has been done, the sauce-pan is replaced on the fire and stirred until the desired thickness is obtained. Yolks of eggs are also used for liaison: they must be carefully freed from the whites, beaten up with a little hot-water, or stock, and added to the sauce off the fire, the thickening being very cautiously conducted afterwards over a low fire as in custard-making. The sauce must be allowed to cool for two or three minutes before the egg thickening is put into it. This thickening is used inpoulette sauce, for fricassees, and for the enrichment of numerous sauces. Addenda. Here is an economical wrinkle :—Let us suppose that 10

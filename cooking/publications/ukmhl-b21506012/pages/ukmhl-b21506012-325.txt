Not exactly the sort of dish to tempt a lady, still slightly affected by mal-cle-mer, who has been urged by her stew- ardess to rouse herself, “poor dear,” and try and eat some- thing. Having had this mess thrust before him day after day for three weeks, no wonder that the “ vcocuus viator finds something in the curry of Ceylon to delight him. “ Good! said I to myself, cheered at the sight” (a plump, freshly-roasted leveret), wrote Brillat Savarin concerning his experiences of a journey ; “I am not entirely abandon- ed by Providence : a traveller may gather a flower by the ivay-side."

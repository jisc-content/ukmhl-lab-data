MENU FOB A PARTY OF EIGHT. 391 cold, mask the cutlets on one side only with reduced b&chamel, or Espagnole sauce. When this mask or glaze has set, trim the edges neatly, and the cutlet is ready. You must now prepare the socle or stand upon which to arrange your cutlets. This is made of ground rice, and is not intended to be eaten. Wash a pound of rice, and boil it gently with a little salt. When soft, pound it in a mortar, and mould it to the shape required. In this case we want a circle about three inches high with a hollow centre for a salad, and sloped gently on its outer rim to admit of the cutlets being laid upon it securely. When formed satisfac- torily, the socle should be coated with butter or white sauce, and the cutlets arranged round its outer face. They should have their masked sides outwards. The hollow centre of the socle should be filled with a salade cuite of mixed cold cooked peas, flageolets, French beans cut in diamonds, stars of carrot, &c. The top of the socle may be formed sufficiently wide to admit of a garnish of white of egg, turned carrots, &c., being laid upon it.* When completed, this entree should be kept in the icebox till wanted. With the exception of the mayonnaise dress- ing, which should he separately made, and poured over the salad just before serving, it can be made early in the day, and is consequently so much off the cook’s hands as the dinner hour arrives. It will be found vastly better than the everlasting pate de foie gras en aspic. Iced cream may be used instead of mayonnaise dressing, and the salade may be composed of flageolets, pointes d’asperges, &c., alone. 4.—The difficulty in this dish is the batter which should be most carefully considered. * All this elaborate treatment might be dispensed with (see page 83) by serving a cutlet on a very cold plate, with a portion of the cold salade cuite, to each guest direct from the buffet.

CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 368 a wire sieve : put a breakfast-cupful of these in a baking tin with sufficient butter to moisten them, place the tin in the oven. Stir the crumbs occasionally until they have absorbed all the butter, and are of a golden colour. Larding is of course an optional proceeding, but the tying of a slice or slices of bacon over the breast is most neces- sary. In the absence of bacon, a well oiled paper should be wrapped round the bird, but this must he removed for the browning stage towards the end of the roasting. The caution given at page 122 as to plucking, and at page 123 as to parboiling before roasting (a villainy per- petrated too often by Bamas&my), and roasting too soon before the bird is wanted, should be read over here, for our game is ruined by these practices. Partridges, and game birds that seem rather old, are better if turned into the camp stock pot at once ; still, very careful stewing often renders old birds palatable. Perhaps the best way of cooking Indian partridges is with cabbage, perdeeaux au chou, in the following manner:— Prepare four partridges as for boiling, with their legs tucked in : lard their breasts with bacon and put an onion inside each of them. Cut a nice cabbage into quarters, blanch them, and steep them in cold salt and water for an hour. Now take a roomy stew-pan, line its bottom with two carrots, and two large onions sliced in rings, a sprink- ling of powdered herbs, and a dusting of salt and pepper. Put the partridges above this lining, inserting a quarter of cabbage in the spaces between each bird, a slice of bacon here and there, and some slices of Bologna or Brunswick sausage. Moisten with a good gravy made of the bird trimmings, a couple of sheep’s feet, and vege- tables, with a seasoning of herbs, pepper and salt. This should be sufficient in quantity to cove?- the birds. Boil closely covered up, and then simmer for an hour and a

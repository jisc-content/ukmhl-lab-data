358 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. taken, and can be overcome almost wholly by careful and speedy cleaning. This should always be remembered, and skinning is equally necessary. The fish should then be blanched in boiling water for five minutes, and, after being taken out, rubbed with a clean cloth to remove the oily coating with which it is often enveloped. It can now be divided into fillets, and cooked in any of the methods speci- fied in the domestic cookery book; and whether stewed according to the recipes already given, halted in a pie, or served cm gratin, wrapped in buttered paper and broiled on the grid-iron, curried, or in mold, it rarely fails to be pro- nounced excellent. For a large eel Isaak Walton’s plan may be followed: —Having cut off the head, turn the skin over, and draw it down (as you draw off a stocking) as far as it is necessary for the removal of the viscera ; this operation having been performed very completely, wipe the fish well, and give him three or four scotches on both sides with a knife, put into these a mixture of chopped herbs, and minced anchovy, and stuff him with the same kneaded up with butter ; next draw the skin back again, secure it with a tape at the neck end, and then roast or bake him, basting first with salt and water till the skin cracks, and then with melted butter and vinegar: when done, serve him with the liquor which exudes during the cooking as sauce. The vacuum to be filled with stuffing is so small that a little suffices. The'fresh-water turtle (Emyclagranosa), Tam : Pal-amai; Hind : Dhooth thambale, is really a delicacy well worthy of the closest attention. This, the edible variety, is distin- guished from the repulsive non-edible sort,—the Pi-amai, or Emys trijuga,—by the yellow colour of its soft under shell being black and fetid. The former is to be compared with the much prized terrapin or tide-water tortoise of North America. It is valuable in soup or stew, and makes a very delicate curry.

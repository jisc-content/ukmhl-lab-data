CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 6 ' In addition to the above, the custom of presenting oysters before the soup is becoming daily more fashionable, and many people have adopted the practice of sending round hors d' oeuvres, in the continental manner, as a pre- lude to the repast. A matter of this kind is obviously a matter of taste, touching which no writer on cookery should take upon himself to lay down an arbitrary law. I am per- sonally decidedly in favour of the oyster, or, when oysters cannot be got, of a single, well selected, hors .d’ceuvre. The dainty atom titivates the palate, as it were, and prepares it for the soup that is about to come. When, how- ever, a relish of this description is given, it will be found decidedly advantageous, be it noted, if plates containing it be put upon the table in the places laid for the guest before dinner is announced.

What, then, is the rot ? Well, from personal observation I am constrained to say that this is a matter upon which

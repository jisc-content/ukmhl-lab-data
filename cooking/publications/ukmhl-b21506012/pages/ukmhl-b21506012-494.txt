Bind the salpicon with four eggs, and spread it thickly over the inside of the boned loin, then roll the joint up, and tie it firmly into shape,—do not skewer it. Now braise the loin in a gravy made from its own bones and trimmings, with a glass of marsala, a clove of garlic, and scraps of vegetables of all kinds arranged round it.

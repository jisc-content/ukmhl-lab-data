CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 288 with quarters of hard-boiled eggs : if you have a few but- ton mushrooms, you can use them for that purpose also, and strew some finely minced parsley over the whole. The cupful of gravy should he poured gently into the packed pie-dish the last thing, just to moisten the contents as it were. Assuming that the cook can make a good light pie-crust, and that the dish has been neatly covered in therewith, care must be taken about the state of the oven :—if too slack, the crust will he heavy and dull, and if too hot, it will he burnt before the pie is-completely cooked. The oven should be so hot that you cannot quite bear your hand inside it. Always leave an aperture in the centre of your pie-crust, which you can cover with an ornamental device in pastry when the gravy has been finally added. This is necessary as a vent for the escape of the gas which the cooking of the meat generates, and also as an opening through which you can pour the rest of your gravy as a finishing touch after the pie is quite baked. The glazing of the crust should he done toivards the end of the baking by brushing a well beaten up egg over its surface. If you hear these general rules in mind, I am sure that you will soon experience a marked improvement in the savoury pies that your cook may in future place before you. There ought to he little or no difficulty in flavouring a pie even though circumstances may render it impossible for you to compose the really good gravy which I have recommended as so highly essential. Take an ordinary “chicken and beef-steak pie” for instance : there ought to be some scraps left after cutting the beef to fit the pie- dish, and there must be some valuable trimmings available for broth-making when you have cut up and dressed the chicken—the neck, pinions, legs and feet, giblets, &c.

284 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. Savoury puddings, though homely, and perhaps hardly to be recommended for dinner parties, are, in their way, not to be despised. The best paste for them, I think, is one made as follows :—Chop very finely six ounces of clari- fied suet, and dredge a little flour over it as you mince it. Mix with it one pound of flour, a tea-spoonful of salt, and sufficient water to make a smooth, pliant paste. Roll it out, and it will be ready for use. A basin is the best thing to use for the boiling : rub it well with butter, line it with the paste rolled at least half an inch thick, put in the meat, close over the top securely, tie the basin up with a cloth, and steam the pudding slowly for three hours. To ensure success, a pudding cannot be too slowly boiled. Snipe pudding : Line a roomy bowl with pudding paste : prepare four snipes as for roasting: lay a thin steak on the bottom of the hollowed paste, and place the snipes over it with bacon slices between them ; cover them with another thin steak, and before closing the paste, pour in a coffee- cupful of very strong essence of beef. Try the following essence on special occasions :—Cut a mild white onion in half, blanch the halves in scalding hot water, take them out, dry and slice them up very finely; put them into a sauce-pan with an ounce of butter ; fry till turning yellow; add a dessert-spoonful of finely minced ham, a dessert-spoonful of Harvey sauce, a salt-spoonful of spiced pepper, and a breakfast-cupful of beef broth in which one snipe has been jugged ; flavour with a dessert- spoonful of Marsala, and a tea-spoonful of red currant jelly ; simmer till the ingredients have yielded their full flavour, and the liquid has been reduced one-third, then strain, and add as already directed before finally closing the pudding. I am altogether against cutting the birds in halves as some advise, or picking out their trails : they are far better left intact.

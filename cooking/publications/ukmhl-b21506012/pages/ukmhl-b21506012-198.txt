.186 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. fried bread is an agreeable adjunct to certain dishes ; sod- den, slightly smoke toast is inexpressibly disagreeable any- where. Miscellaneous. Bacon is valuable with all rechauffes of meat, and poached eggs are acceptable when served on the surface of hashes, and minces. Ham, I need scarcely say, if on hand, can be turned to the very best account, and tongue also for that matter, to assist the flavouring of minces, croquettes, rissoles, et hoc genus omne.

366 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. An excellent hash may be made of a cold roast have (or venison) in this way:â€”Trim off as much of the meat as you can find in slices, and cut out what remains of the stuff- ing : break up all the hones and put them with the skin and scraps into a stew-pan with a large onion cut up, pepper- corns, a bit of celery if possible, and any vegetable, a little spice, any sauce that may have been left, a couple of glasses of red wine and enough water to cover the hones, &c.; sim- mer these ingredients for an hour and a half, and then strain off the gravy.

CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 318 cardamoms, and half one of pounded cloves. Cook this for five minutes, dilute with a pint of mutton broth, then put in the meat, and simmer over a moderate fire until the pieces seem tender. Now, take the pan from the fire, and work into it a strong infusion obtained from four ounces •of well-pounded sweet almonds diluted with hot water and squeezed through muslin, and a breakfast-cupful of cream. Mix thoroughly, adding a dessert-spoonful of turmeric powder, and a tea-spoonful of sugar. Put the pan over a very low fire, and let the curry simmer as gently as possi- ble for a quarter of an hour, finishing off with the juice of a couple of limes. This, it will be perceived, is another curry of a rich yet mild description. The total absence of chilli, indeed, constitutes, in the opinion of many, its chief attraction. According to the ancient canons by which the service of curries was regulated, chutneys of various kinds were considered as essentially necessary as the lordly platter of rice which, of course, accompanied them. These may be divided into two distinct classes : tire preserved or bottled chutneys, and those that are made of fresh materials on the spot. Of the former I need say nothing: they are easily procured, and most people know the kind that suits them best. But concerning the latter, I think a little reflection will be found advantageous. There can be no doubt that the presentation of these chutneys,—the little hors d’auvres, so to speak, of the curry service,—has of late years passed quietly into desuetude. This has been the result, to be sure, of the disappearance of curries from the menu of the modern dinner, and the very moderate degree of attention that they now command at our hands. Assuming, however, that those who still occasionally patronize the dish would rather see it at its best, and served correctly than not, I will go on with a few recipes that will be found easy enough.

254 CULINARY JOTTINGS NOR MADRAS. — and tender, stop the boiling by a dash of cold water, lift the vessel, and drain it completely, returning the macca- roni to the hot pan. If you want to cook Italian pastes in milk or stock, whichever you use should he boiling : blanch the paste in boiling water for ten minutes to clean it, drain it carefully, and turn it into the stock or milk, also boiling as the case may be, to finish cooking, the process being slow simmering. The accepted form of serving maccaroni with English- men is either swimming in tasteless white sauce round a boiled fowl, or turkey, or in a pie-dish “augratin.” In the former fashion it is generally presented in such a flabby, tasteless manner, that the general unpopularity of Italian pastes may be easily accounted for. The “au gratin” is better understood perhaps, but even there, there is room for improvement. “Maccaroni au gratin” :—First boil the maccaroni as I have laid down, if in milk or siock, so much the better. Well butter a pie-dish, arrange the maccaro-ni therein neat- ly, give it a dusting with black pepper and salt, pour round it a large cupful of good.sawce blonde (q. v., page 89) in which you have mixed two ounces of grated cheese : let this run well in amongst the bed of maccaroni, and shake over the surface a liberal coating of grated cheese. Make this thoroughly hot, in the oven, brown the surface of the cheese by passing a red hot iron about half an inch above it, and send it up. Maccaroni “an gratin” should be nice and moist: you can use cream instead of sauce blonde if you like, and tomato puree may be introduced in its composition. A little minced fish such as herring, prawns, lobster, or an- chovy, may he dotted about amongst the maccaroni, and with minced ham and chicken, or tongue and chicken, you can make a capital home-dinner entree, following in other respects the ordinary recipe.

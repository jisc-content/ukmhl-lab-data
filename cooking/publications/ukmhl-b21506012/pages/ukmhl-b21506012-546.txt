534 MENU VOli A LITTLE HOME DINNER. Or, plainer, for the home dinner.—Beat an ounce and a half of butter with the curd obtained from a breakfast- cupful of milk; add two eggs, and sugar to taste, a few drops of lemon essence, a dessert-spoonful of brandy, or marsala, and the juice of a lime: put into the pastry-lined patty- pans well buttered, and bake for about twenty minutes. Curds :—The richer recipes for cheese-cakes are com- posed, it will generally be found, with curds, with the method of making which some of my readers may be un- acquainted. A little lump of alum put into cold milk, and then set on the fire, will turn milk to a curd as quickly as anything, or two tea-spoonfuls of preserved 1 rennet’ will turn a quart of milk; the homely way, however, is to boil a pint of water in a stew-pan, to beat two eggs up with a pint of milk, and to add the mixture to the boiling water, with the juice of a couple of limes. As the curd rises it should be skimmed off, and laid upon a sieve to drain. When dry, it is ready. Lobster pilao a la Turque. Choose the firm pieces of a lobster from the tin, trim them neatly, set them in a buttered sa/^e-pan and warm them thoroughly. Arrange the pieces in a circle in a hot silver dish filling the centre with riz a la Turque (page 259). Pour some of the following sauce dl'Indiennc over the pieces of lobster, but not over the rice, and serve. Cut up a sweet onion, or half a dozen shallots, and throw the pieces into a small stew-pan with two ounces of butter. Fry till the onions begin to take colour, then stir in a table- spoonful of good curry powder or paste; cook this for five minutes, then add a pint of plain gravy; let the contents of the pan simmer now for a quarter of an hour while you make a coffee-cupful of lait d’amandes (page 304). Stir this into the sauce, adding the yolks of two eggs, off the fire, before serving.

45 THICK SOUPS AND PUREES. labours all day have been sedentary, and ladies who have lunched well, and passed their day in graceful repose. And it is mainly for them, be it remembered, that I com- pose what a friendly critic terms my “ menus mignons.” Thick soups may be divided into two classes—the white, and the brown. The principles followed in both are very similar ; the main difference, of course, consists in the sort of meat used, and the employment of dark or light roux, or liaison, as the case may be. Liaison au roux is simply butter melted at the bottom of a sauce-pan over a very moderate fire, with flour added to it, according to the quantity of soup you want to thicken. The butter must be melted first, the flour being dredged in by degrees, and stirred vigorously at the bot- tom of the sauce-pan until thoroughly incorporated, and velvety. As soon as it turns brown, the roux is ready, this is what is wanted for brown soups. For a white, the liaison must not be allowed to take colour ; you must com- mence adding the soup to it as soon as the flour and butter have been sufficiently worked together. Grouffb’s propor- tions in making a roux for storage are half a pound of butter to one pound of flour. The preparation keeps well, and the quantity wanted for soup can be taken according to the recipe followed from time to time. One ounce to the quart is enough as a rule. This system of cooking the butter and flour together is especially necessary to prevent the taste of raw flour being imparted to the soup. The old-fashioned method of dredging flour into the soup had this disadvantage, besides being objectionable on the score of extravagance : for there was much waste from the lumps which were strained off after the operation, and thrown away. In making these soups, the utmost care should be taken not to over-do the thickening. In the case of a whit

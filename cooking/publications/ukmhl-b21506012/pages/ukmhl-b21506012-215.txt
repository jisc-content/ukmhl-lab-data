ON LUNCHEONS. 203 Maccaroni, iu the usual Italian fashion, is infinitely supe- rior to our perpetual method of serving it. It makes an excellent luncheon dish. Boil the maccaroni in boiling water in a sauce-pan (which may be rubbed with a clove of-garlic) until it is tender-; the moment it is tender, stop the boiling by adding a cup of cold water, if not, it will be sodden. Drain it carefully, as you do rice, and let it re- main in the hot sauce-pan.

The cheese should form long threads when lifted from the dish with the maccaroni. If you have any stock or consomme to spare, you can im- prove this dish by simmering the maccaroni therein after the draining stage. When the stock has been absorbed, add the tomato, &c.

At the moment when the setting indicates that the omelette is all but ready to roll into the dish prepared for it, quickly spread over its surface a layer of apricot, raspberry, or strawberry jam. This should be all ready at hand before the frying commences. As soon as the jam is spread, turn the omelette overinto the hot dish which should haveadust-

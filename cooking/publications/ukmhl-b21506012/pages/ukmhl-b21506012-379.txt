CAMP COOKERY. 367 piece of vension can be kept three or four days in this liquid: see that it is constantly turned. The roasting should be attended to carefully : first set the flesh after wip- ing it well by bolding the joint over a clear charcoal fire for a minute. This facilitates the larding which should next be carried out. When prepared, wrap it in oiled paper, and proceed to cook it in the manner prescribed for roast hare. For a good sauce to accompany the above, take one pint of the marinade ; boil, and strain it; thicken it with half an ounce of butter and half an ounce of flour; color with caramel, reduce a little, add a table-spoonful of marsala, and serve. In cantonment, with the proper appiliances at hand, I •would braise rather than roast the venison, using for its moistening a carefully made mirepoix,—page 108. Jungle-sheep requires just as much care as ordinary vension, for if cooked like mutton, in the style generally adopted by Ramasamy, it is, as a rule, dry and insipid. The neck and loin chops are excellent when “ jugged” as prescribed for bare. The rule of the koast in regard to game birds :—the fiorican, Himalayan pheasant, pea-chick, partridge, jungle- fowl, &c., is first to pluck, draw, singe, and truss, placing a couple of shallots and one ounce of butter inside the bird. Then to lard the breast very finely, tie a thin slice of bacon over the larding, and roast the bird at a moderate fire, basting it frequently with butter. A few minutes before the bird is done, remove the slice of bacon, so as to let the larding take colour. Serve with plain gravy, fried crumbs, and bread sauce. Time, about thirty minutes.

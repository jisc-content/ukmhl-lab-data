Work the mince about for ten minutes, then empty the contents of the frying-pan into a mortar, and pound the mixture to a paste. Now cut eight fine truffles into dice the size of a pea, melt an ounce of butter in the frying-pan, and throw in the truffles; toss for a couple of minutes, and add a claret-glassful of Madeira ; let the dice simmer in this, and then pour them with the liquor-into a bowl. You can now pack the pie as follows :— Spread a layer of liver paste over the inside of each bird, put a spoonful of truffles upon it, and roll the bird up ; cut the hare into slices, and treat them in the same way : next put a layer of the liver paste over the bottom of the pie, dot it over with truffles, arrange the rolls of hare meat over that, spread some liver paste over them, a few truffles, and some thin slices of cooked fat bacon : next arrange a layer of snipe, and continue until the pie is tightly filled ; cover the topmost layer with fat bacon, sprinkled over with marjoram leaves, cover the pie closely and bake. When done, pour into it a little very strong jelly (liquefied) made of the bones and trimmings of the game, two sheep’s feet, and the truffle liquor. Or, instead of the truffles, open a small tin of pdte de foie gras, turn it out, free it from the fat, then, with a dessert-knife, cut it into dice and dot these about in pack- ing the pie. It must be here observed that raised pies should not be made during the hot weather; unless eaten immediately they soon turn sour ; but they will be found capital on the Hills, at Bangalore, and on the plains during the cold seaon.

CAMP COOKERY— (OUR, FRESH-WATER, FISH). 350 The turtle shold be killed by decapitation : it should then be bung over a vessel to bleed ; when this ceases, the under shell should be detached, the animal being laid on its back to facilitate the operation. Cut all round the edge of the under shell, detach it, and remove the intestines adhering to the back. Take out all the inside, carefully preserving the green fat which is found for the most part round the inside of the shell. Steep this fat in a basin of cold water. Cut off the fins, saw the shells up in pieces, and take the head ; put these to boil separately with the turtle meat till quite tender, and till the meat separates easily from the bones : then drain off the liquid, cut the meat neatly off the bones, returning the latter with the shells to the broth, and placing the meat between two dishes to get cold. The broth should now be set on the fire again to boil, and reduce some- what. In the meantime a strong fowl consomme should have been simmering on the fire, the meat assisted by onions, dried sweet herbs, and such seasoning as can be procured. . This having been completed satisfactorily, the turtle broth being also ready, both should be strained and blended, a muslin bag containing some mixed herbs, including basil and a blade of mace, should be putin, and the amalgamated broths set on the fire to boil, and then to simmer for half an hour, during which stage the cold turtle meat should be put in also. If required for a thick soup, the usual thickening process should follow, the muslin bag having been removed. The green fat should be blanched in boiling water and useda/o»c as garnish. Last of all, Madeira or marsala, according to the quantity of the soup, with a squeeze of lime juice should be added : the soup should then be served. A few drops of tabasco will perhaps be agreeable to many. I am altogether against the introduction of forcemeat

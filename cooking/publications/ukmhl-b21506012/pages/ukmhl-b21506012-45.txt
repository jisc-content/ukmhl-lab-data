S3 ON STOCK, AND CLEAN SOUPS. sauce, and two of mushroom ketchup; when thepot-au-feu is, so to speak, thus completed, it must be left to simmer slowly from three to four hours till the meat is thoroughly done. The soup should now be strained into a basin and left to get cool, so that any remaining fat may be effectu- ally skimmed off. The clear liquor is then fit to he warmed and served with maccaroni, bread sippets, or vegetables, &c., according to the kind of soup you wish to have. Observe that in order to carry out this recipe, an open, roomy vessel is necessary; a closed pot like a digester must not be used. By allowing the liquid to steam freely, uncovered, you assist the clearing process. This is, to my mind, the simplest recipe you can follow to achieve a bright clear consomme. It is, of course, im- perative that you proceed exactly as described. First, the meat covered with cold water, and brought very slow- ly to the boil, being very carefully skimmed the while. Next, when the skimming is completed, the vegetables,— to be removed when done,—the little bouquet of sweet herbs, the sugar, and a small allowance of sauce and ketchup. Now, a period, of three hours to simmer, followed by straining. The liquor you have after this is actually beef consomme or strong broth quite clear and pale in color. Bemoving the fat whilst the simmering is going on is obviously a very important stage which cannot be too patiently manipulated. The fat so obtained is invaluable for frying purposes. It should be melted after it has settled, and strained through a piece of muslin. It may so happen that, owing to insufficient skimming in the early stage of the proceedings, you find to your sorrow that the consomme is not as clear as you could wish. You must therefore clarify it. There are two good ways of doing this. The simpler, and I consider, the more effica- cious of the two is to put into the cool broth some very

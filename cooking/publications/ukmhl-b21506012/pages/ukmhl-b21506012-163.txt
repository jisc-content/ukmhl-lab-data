151 OUR VEGETABLES. they are done Pressure is now necessary to get rid of the water, and when thoroughly drained, they can be sent up. Cabbages however are better done in the steamer, by which process they do not absorb so much water, so do not require such careful draining. The flavour of all green vegetables, indeed, is more successfully developed by this system of cookery than by boiling. The only objection that may be urged is that their- colour is rarely so bright. This may be overcome by placing a bag with wood ashes enclosed in it in the water. Vegetables should be carefully prepared as if for boiling, some salt should be sprinkled over their leaves, and they should be placed, dry, in the perforated receptacle that fits into the top of the steamer. Water should then he poured into the lower vessel, tilling it not more than half full The steamer should then be placed over a brisk fire. After steaming has set in, the con- tents of the receptacle should be examined now and then, and tested exactly as boiled vegetables are. I can strongly recommend Warren’s vegetable steamer made of block-tin for this process. There are numerous methods of dressing greens,—after boiling or steaming them,—which ought to attract favour- able attention, and I can assure you that with a very little trouble you can turn out a most excellent series of dishes, which will well repay you, and raise the lowly cabbage to a much higher position in your estimation than it at pre- sent may occupy. Before I pass to the fanciful styles in which cabbages can be dressed, I ought however to call attention to a bad habit that the native cook often indulges in. I mean that of chopping up a plain boiled cabbage before serving it. Setting aside the ugly appearance that the dish presents « when thus maltreated, the chopping is a wasteful practice. The cut-up cabbage dries quickly, and will hardly be found worth dressing up a second time ; whereas, if served whole,

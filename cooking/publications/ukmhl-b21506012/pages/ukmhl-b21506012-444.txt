J form of the two : tastes vary however, so I shall describe both methods. First, for the clear :—- Procure the stock meat as usual, and half an ox-head un- skinned (a calf’s head is the proper thing, but we must deal with fact, not fiction, knowing that we cannot get veal here), well,—clean the head thoroughly, keeping the skin on, and scalding it to get rid of the hair: remove every atom of brain, and wash the meat in several waters, set it to soak a while in cold water, and then place it in your soup kettle ; cover it with water and let it simmer slowly for an hour, skimming all fat, and scum that may rise : take it up (it will be about half done), remove the bones and set it, with a weight upon it, on a dish to flatten and get cold.

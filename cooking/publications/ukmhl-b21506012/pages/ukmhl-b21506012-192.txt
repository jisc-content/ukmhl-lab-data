180 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. your pungent sauces, and essences, be kept under lock and key, and give out, from time to time, the doles that are ne- cessary for delicate flavouring. If you do this, your hashes will cease to be slices of meat, cooked up in hot water and Worcester sauce, thickened with flour; neither will your minces, croquettes, cassolettes, ifcc., be presented withasauce similarly composed. There are certain hard and fast laws to be observed generally with regard to the treatment of cold meat, &c., which ought never to he forgotten. Let me enumerate them :— 1. Always cut off carefully all parts that have been browned in the previous cooking, such as skin, &c. 2. Use the trimmings, and all bones, assisted by any- thing you may have to spare, to make the strongest broth you can for your rechau ffe. 3. Be generous in your allowance of butter and eggs, and, if recommended in the recipe you are following, do not refuse a small modicum of cream. 4. Never be without red-currant jelly, olives, anchovies, grated cheese, grated bread-crumbs (bottled), musbroom- ketchup, good vinegar, bottled garden berbs, and a mild sauce like Harvey. 5. Try to maintain a little kitchen garden, in large pots, or boxes, containing English curled parsley, marjoram, thyme, garden-cress, and celery. The last need not be planted for its root’s sake, the leaves and stalks provide the cook with his flavouring agent. 6. Teach your cook that meat that has been once cook- ed, does not require to be boiled or stewed de novo. Des- cribe a hash or a mince to him as meat gently warmed up in gravy or sauce separately made to receive it. You must now turn back to Chapter X in which I tried to‘explain the fundamental principles of sauce-making

Now take an enamelled-pan and break into it the yolks of ten eggs, strain the made chocolate, and add it to the eggs, stirring continually over a low fire, or in the bain-marie until the custard thickens satisfac- torily. Mix half an ounce of dissolved gelatine into the custard, strain, and whip it well while warm and let it get cold. Set a mould in the ice-pail, and when the custard has cooled nicely, pour it into the mould, freeze in the usual way, using the spatula frequently ; when the custard seems nearly frozen, add a wine-glass of very cold syrup flavoured with vanilla, continue the working, and then pour in a pint of well-whipped cream. Finish the freez- ing thoroughly, close the mould securely, and bury it in ice for a couple of hours. Then turn the parfait out on a nap- kin, and serve. If you have a parfait-mould and ice pail, the ordinary form of freezing can he dispensed with. Mix the parfait, put it in the mould, close the mould securely, and bury it in crushed ice and bay salt in the pail. A parfait requires four hours to set in this method, and the crushed ice must be replenished as it melts. At least twenty pounds of ice must be at hand. Note.—To adapt this menu, serve the hen turkey after the fish, and let the quails be roasted and sent round with the usual accompaniments. The parfait should be reserved for dessert.

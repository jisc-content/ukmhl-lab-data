CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 88 A pinch of sugar with the salt assists all white sauces. Please observe that milk is not absolutely necessary in making “ white sauce.” The chief objection to its use is, that, in this country, it causes the sauce with which it may be used to turn sour the next day. I consequently advo- cate the use of broth, made from chicken bones or mutton scraps, instead of milk. Broth enriches the sauce, and if strong, makes it equal to same, blonde. The water in which peas, carrots, parsnips, onions, celery, and leeks, have been boiled,—-the eau de cuisson of the French kitchen,—maybe used advantageously for this purpose. If required for fish, the liquor in which the fish was boiled reduced by rapid boiling ; or a broth made from the bones, fins, and trimmings separately simmered should be used. This has been already strongly advocated in Chapter VII. Indeed so valuable do I consider the fish stock basis that I would,—for any special occasion,—sacrifice a fish entire, or part of one, for its concoction. The common error in making “ melted-butter,” or white sauce is the stirring of the flour into the sauce. The raw flour imparts a paste-like flavour, ■ while it produces the effect required at the expense perhaps of double the neces- sary quantity of flour, for the lumps strained off are utterly wasted. The caution given in regard to roux, and its ap- plication to soups at page 45 is equally apposite here. A too sparing use of butter is another cardinal mistake. With half a pint of good sauce blanche you can work out several tasty recipes as follows :— Beat up the yolk of an egg, and the juice of a couple of limes; strain, and add to your melted butter just before serving; off the fire mind, or the sauce will curdle. Beat up the yolk of an egg with a tea-spoonful of dried chopped tarragon, and a table-spoonful of butter warmed till it has melted, and add in the same way :—sauce d l’ estragon.

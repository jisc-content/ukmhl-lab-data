CULINARY JOTTINGS NOR MADRAS. 202 sprinkling of sliced olives, then the lettuce leaf, &c., as pre- viously described—“ say, dost thou like the picture?” In houses where the cook can really master an omelette properly, one with Parmesan laid upon a fricassee of cauli- flower flowers, or upon a puree de topinambours, or com- posed auxpointes d'asperejes, aux tomates, or mix truffes, may safely form an item of the choicest luncheon bill of fare. Here is a pretty little recipe for a filet, de boiiif a l’Ita- lic nm which, to my mind, is worthy of attention, and well adapted for a mid-day festival. Take a tender fillet of beef (the undercut of the sirloin if possible) preserve it whole after trimming it into shape ; make an incision in it length- ways, and insert therein a long strip of bacon, fat and lean in equal parts, previously rolled in a fines herbes mince com- posed of a table-spoonful each of finely chopped mushroom, and parsley, a dessert-spoonful of minced shallot, and some pepper: tie up the fillet now, carefully, with tape. Take a good slice of bacon, mince it very small with thyme, mar- joram, lime peel, a clove of garlic, half a sweet onion and a carrot, shake this mixture in a little butter at the bottom of a stew-pan, and when it melts, place the fillet upon it, and turn it gently till it browns nicely. Now, pour in a pint of tomato puree, diluted with beef gravy to the consis- tency of ordinary pea-soup : simmer your fillet in this till it is done, it ought to be kept at least a couple of hours at a gentle heat: when ready to serve, strain off the sauce, place the fillet upon a very hot dish, remove the tape, gar- nish with glazed onions, haricots verts, Brussels sprouts, or any nice vegetable, and pour a little of the sauce over it. Have ready some hot boiled, and drained maccaroni iu a sauce-pan, empty all the sauce that remains amongst the maccaroni, shake into it a table-spoonful of finely grated cheese, toss the whole over the fire for a minute, and dish it separately 'in a very hot dish. Serve the two together immediately.

234 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. “Cheese fingers” should be made in these proportions,— a quarter of a pound of puff paste, a pinch of salt, two ounces of grated Parmesan, or other mild cheese, and a very little cayenne, Nepaul pepper, or a few drops of “tabasco.” Work the ingredients together, roll the paste out about half an inch thick, cut it into oblong shapes, about three inches long, bake and serve as hot as possible, on a napkin. “Devilled ham” is sold in tins, it is as good a thing as can be got at a pinch, if you have no time to make a hors d'ceuvre at home. It is not as hot as its name would lead you to suppose: it is merely potted ham well peppered. Buy your “Bombay ducks” in tins from Treacher and Co., of that city. I discovered this in Piccadilly of all places in the world. Jackson and Co. import the “ducks” from Bombay neatly flattened out, floui'ed, and packed in oblong tins. When you remember the number of hands through which the bazar-bought fish passes, the flies that have settled upon it, and the impossibility of washing dried fish, you will, I hope, agree with me that my recommenda- tion is absolutely philanthropical. The fashion of substituting a carefully considered savoury vlat instead of the cumbersome cheese service, as advocat- ed by Sir Henry Thompson in his Food and Feeding, is assuredly a step in the right direction, especially at dinner parties. If you follow this practice, you can eliminate the dishes of cheese, butter, biscuits, and zests which ordinarily accompany them, and confine the service to a single canape, croute au Parmesan, ramaquin, or biscuit au foie gras, to each guest. A selection of an appropriate savoury morsel can easily be made from those given in this chapter.

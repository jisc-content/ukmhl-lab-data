255 EGGS, MACC A RON I, AND CHEESE. “Maccaroni dl' Italienne” will be found in Chapter XVII, (page 203). “Maccai’oni d la Milanaise,” another excellent method, may be described as follows :—Boil two ounces of macca- roni, and keep it hot in its own pan after draining. Make a breakfast-cupful of good chicken broth flavoured with an onion, sweet herbs, and black pepper corns. With that make a nice “veloute an fromagc” in this way:—Melt an ounce of butter in a sauce-pan, stir into it a dessert-spoon- ful of flour, mix them to a paste, and by degrees pour in the hot chicken broth ; as this is thickening, add to it two ounces of grated cheese, or Parmesan from the bottle, a tea-spoonful of powdered mustard, salt, and “spiced pep- per,” at discretion ; continue to stir the sauce until it reaches a creamy thickness, when you can finish it off the fire by a table-spoonful of cream, or the yolks of two raw eggs beaten separately. Now, stir the sauce into the hot boiled maccaroni, and serve immediately. The association of tomatoes with maccaroni seems to be as happy as that of green peas with a duckling, egg sauce with saltfish, or red currant jelly with a well hung saddle. These vegetables are generally applied in the form of puree, to achieve which you must cut them into quarters, trim them from stalk, &c., and put them into a sauce-pan with an ounce of butter, and one onion sliced in rings, a few pepper corns, three cloves of garlic, a tea-spoonful of dried basil, and a little salt; boil till the quarters are quite soft, and then turn the contents of the sauce-pan out upon a hair sieve. When thus drained, pick out the garlic, and pepper corns, and rub the vegetable through the sieve with a wooden spoon : the pulp that comes through,—well pep- pered with black pepper,—must be heated again, a lump of butter and the yolk of an egg being added before it is mixed with the maccaroni. Maccaroni with “conserva cli pomi cl'oro” is an Italian

Has not some thrifty professor of kitchen lore actually dedicated a little hook to the mysteries of cooking cold mutton, and how to penetrate them ? I have never seen the work, but, without boasting, I think I could fill a couple of chapters myself upon a similar theme. The mistake most of us make is one on the side of same- ness. We pick up a tasty recipe for warming up fish, a cunning method of treating cold vegetables, or a marvel- lously good wrinkle about a hash, and ring the changes on our small stock of knowledge acl nauseam.

MENU FOR A DINNER OF SIX. 463 hare was cooked to the stew-pan, set it on the fire, and let it throw up all grease, &c., in the form of scum, which skim off carefully. Now take a small sauce-pan, and mix therein the blood you saved, and some of the soup cooled slightly from the stew-pan : thoroughly amalgamate these (in the bain-marie), and when well blended, add the mixture slowly through the pointed tin strainer, to the gradually re-heating soup. Let it come nearly to the boil, and then serve it over the pieces of hare you preserved. This is Gouffb’s receipt simplified. There are other ways of making hare soup, especially that called potage d la puree cle lievere, which are always popular. The puree is, of course, assisted with pounded meat, red currant jelly, lime juice, and plenty of portwine. See Menu No. XIX. 2.—Divide three nice whitings in fillets. Dip them in batter (according to my old receipt) sauce^wllltings sha,P and fry them a crisp golden yellow in a bath of boiling fat. Drain them and serve with the following sauce in a boat,—fry a Bombay onion finely minced, with one clove of garlic also minced, in butter at the bottom of a sauce-pan ; when turning brown, put in a table-spoonful of chopped parsley, a tea-spoonful of sugar, a coffee-cupful of vinegar, and a pint of fish stock. A tea-spoonful of red currant jelly may next be stirred in, and a table-spoonful of mushroom ketchup. As soon as the mixture becomes nicely flavoured, and the juices of the various ingredients appear to be extracted, strain off the sauce. Now cut up a table-spoonful of minced pickled gherkins (cornichons), add the mince to the strained gravy, heat it up to concert pitch, and send it round with your fried fish in a boat. 3-—Proceed with a nice sized chicken or small fowl as though you were going to make qitenel- wi^aspa^agusles> viz- Lightly roast it. Cut off the best meat, and put it aside. Save

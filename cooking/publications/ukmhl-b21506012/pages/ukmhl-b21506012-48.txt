CULINARY JOTTINGS FOE MADRAS. 36 some a great improvement. I strongly advise any of my readers who mite to England for their stores, not to forget to ask for a little bottle of American “ Tabasco ” or quintessence of cayenne, sold by Messrs. Jackson and Co., Piccadilly, priced half a crown : each bottle is furnished with a• patent stopper to enable you to shake out a drop at a time ; two drops in each basin of soup is generally found enough, and the flavour is very good, quite superseding chilli-vinegar for this purpose. The next important feature for consideration in soup- making is the adding of wine, which, I think, may be regarded as very essential. Madeira or marsala is better than sherry for most soups. A rich, full, fruity wine,— inexpensive for want of age, and scarcely mellow enough for after dinner drinking,—is the class best adapted for kitchen use. If sherry be preferred, it ought to be a fruity one, and sound, not a cheap extraordinary compound, composed of molasses, washings of sherry casks, and the most villainous brandy; but honest sherry, lacking age, perhaps, yet bond ficle wine. Be careful, however, not to overdo the soupqon of wine that you add to a clear soup; a good table-spoonful is, to my mind, enough for a tureen filled for eight persons. Thick soups, especially those made of game, mock-turtle, giblet, kidney, and the like, take a larger share of wine : hare soup requires port or burgundy, wild duck and teal soup also, whilst pot ages of snipe, partridges, quails, jungle-fowls, &c., are, I think, better enriched with Madeira, or marsala. I have hitherto purposely omitted saying anything con- cerning the treatment of the meat and vegetables of which a pot-au-feu is made, being anxious to keep strictly to the subject which we have been discussing,—the cookery of a clear consomme. Before I go on with soup-making, how- ever, I beg par parenthesc as it were, to turn back to that period in the preparation of the soup when we strained the

CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. no you are giving a dinner party, and that a turkey, capon, or pair of fowls are to be presented. On cleaning and prepar- ing the birds, put aside all the giblets, and trimmings, especially the heads, necks, feet, hearts, livers, gizzards, and pinions which are of no use whatever if left on. Cut all these into small pieces, scald them, fry them with an onion, and a carrot sliced, in some butter, or clarified suet at the bottom of a stew-pan: shake the pan, and when beginning to color, add a breakfast cupful of water and a glass of Marsala; reduce almost to a glaze, then add a pint of water and stew gently to extract the whole of the essence from the scraps : when this has been done, a little water being added to check boiling from time to time, pour all through a strainer, and cool it for the fat to rise. This having been removed you will have a grand basis for your brown sauce for the turkey. A little raw meat or lean ba- con may of course be put in, while a couple of sheep’s feet would improve the gravy by adding to its gelatinous con- sistency. An excellent sauce for these birds can be made with the cashu-nut in this manner :—Make a colorless essence of the giblets, as just explained, by omitting the coloring stage : strain it, remove the fat, and place it on bain-marie. For half a pint or so of sauce, take a breakfast cupful of the nuts, scald them to remove dirt, and any shell that may adhere to them : this having been done, boil them in milk, or milk and water, with salt to taste, and a pinch of sugar: when soft, drain and pound them in a mortar, moistening them with some of the milk in which they were boiled : when pounded to a paste, put a quarter of an ounce of flour into a clean stew-pan with a quarter ounce of butter, mix a white roux, and then add giblet essence and nut- paste by degrees till the puree reaches a nice consistency, and the paste has been expended. This can be finished, off the fire before serving, with the yolk of an egg, or a table-spoonful of cream.

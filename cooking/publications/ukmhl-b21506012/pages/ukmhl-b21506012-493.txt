481 MENU FOB A PARTY OF SIX. garnished with curls of crisply fried Blanquette of fowl. and bunches of cuvly parsley. For the blanquette:—slightly roast a young, well-fed fowl, covering the breast with buttered paper to prevent its burning: when done, put it on a dish, and let it get cold. Then carve it neatly, cutting the white meat off in nice little round fillets, and saving the wings, merrythought, &c. Take the bones, skin, giblets (previously saved), trimmings, and coarser meat of the drumsticks, and heat them well with your pestle. Next throw them into a sauce- pan, with as much clear stock as will cover them, a glass of sherry, and the usual proportion of vegetables, especially celery, a bag of savoury herbs, lime peel, and a pinch of sugar. Make with this an excellent fowl consomme, an essence as it were, adding six pomaded sweet, and one bitter almond. When quite ready, strain it off, and thicken it as for vcloute. Then having got a rich, creamy, delicately flavoured white sauce, put into it all your pieces of fowl, with some pellets of tongue cut like gun wads rather thickly, some sweetbreads (if you can get them), some button mushrooms, a few oysters trimmed free from their beards, a few slices of truffle, the liver of the fowl minced, and some grated lean bacon or ham. Gently,—ever so gently mind,— heat up the blanquette, and let it simmer for half an hour over a low fire ; the various flavours will thus be extracted, and your plat be ready to serve whenever you want it. A table-spoonful of cream, or the yolks of two raw eggs beaten in a cup with a little of the sauce should be added, and stirred well in as a finishing touch. 4.—Bone the .loin, introduce a number of slices of bacon under the flap, fill the inside with a to^Ttuffed!" 0t mut forcemeat made with three ounces of bread-crumb, the meat of the undercut chopped up small, with the kidney (scalded first), and some of the nicest fat, seasoned with herbs, spiced pepper, chop- 46

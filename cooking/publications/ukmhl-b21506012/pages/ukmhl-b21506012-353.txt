CAMP COOKERY. 341 An excellent method may be thus described:—Having made your mince and flavoured it, if possible, with a little chopped lean bacon, anchovy, sausage meat, &c., bind it with a little good sauce thickened with a couple of eggs, and let it get cold : make a good sized thin pan-cake, take it from the pan when almost done, put it on a dish, and arrange some slices of cold cooked bacon upon it, lay the mince upon the bacon, give it a dust of spiced pepper, and fold the pan-cake over it : brush it over with an egg, bread- crumb it, and bake it a golden brown in your oven. The pan-cake should he large enough of course to envelope the mince securely. If you look upon a tin of preserved meat as a dish that has been cooked once, and has accordingly to be dressed en rechauffe, you will not fail to turn it to good account. But warmed up as it comes from the tin, unaided, and care- lessly dished, it presents an irregular mass of sodden and tasteless diet which few would care to touch unless driven to do so by the calls of ungovernable hunger. A very useful thing in camp is a Bologna sausage. Not necessarily for consumption ait naturel,but for flavouring and assisting other meats. A very common plat,—Ramasamy’s chicken cutlets for instance,—can thus be much improved ; a few thin slices in a pie or stew are most serviceable, while eaten cold with cold roast fowl or game it is always accept- able. / Preparations like Messrs. Crosse and Blackwell’s “ducks and green peas,” “Irish stew,” “ox cheek and vegetables,” &c., are useful in combination ; so if you find that your butler has brought such things to camp, you must pick the meat out of its surroundings, dress it with some fresh chicken meat, as a rissole, croustade or a mince, and cook the gravy and vegetables with some fresh chicken broth as a sauce. One of the best introductions of late years is Moir and

CAMP COOKERYâ€” (OUR FRESH-WATER FISH). 347 and flavour. Neverthelesss, it may occasionally happen that vou have no other alternative. If so, remember the boiling salt and water. If instead of water you can pre- pare a court bouillon (see page 59) so much the better. For the stock I would use the trimmings of fish, heads, fins, tails, and any sort of fish that may on account of its boni- ness be considered to he heyond the pale of cookery. Onions, and any available vegetable, should he boiled with the fish, and a little white wine, such as chablis, sauterne, or hock may he added. Instead of white wine a glass of claret can he used, and, if that be impossible, one of vinegar. In camp there may he difficulties in regard to some of the ingredients I have named, but the principles can be observed as far as possible. A bottle of dried sweet herbs ought always to be included in the camp store-box. In cantonments, of course, matters can be managed simply enough. If the supply of milk he cheap and plentiful, court bouillon a la Nantaiso may be tried, i.e., milk and water in equal parts, with pepper and salt to taste. Baking can generally be accomplished by Bamasamy in camp under difficulties that would petrify his European brother ; roasting on the spit, too, he can manage success- fully : while stewing and broiling cause less trouble than either of the two former processes, and may perhaps suit his appliances more readily. There is, as a rule, no little difficulty in frying fish when in camp, for the medium can rarely be got in sufficient quantity. Ghee will probably be the only kind procurable, and if perfectly fresh and sweet this may be used for dress- ing small fry such as the Chela argentea (Tam : Vellachee), C. cltipeoides (Tam : Netleli), the gudgeon, Gobius giuris (Tam : Ulvag), and fillets of various fishes. Dipping in milk and flouring will be found far better than

ON STOCK, AND GLEAN. SOUPS. oo weak, washy composition only lit for foreigners. But if you take the very self-same liquor ancl brown it with a lot of burnt onion, and thicken it with flour and butter, or worse still with arrowroot, they are perfectly satisfied. Did you ever make jugged beef tea for a sick friend, the strongest possible essence of raw lean beef? Was not the liquor so obtained as clear as sherry, pale-coloured, with a quantity of granulated particles of the beef floating in it ? Well, when strained that would have been consomme without the flavouring produced from vegetables and the bouquet of sweet herbs, and surely strong enough for the veriest John Bull that ever talked nonsense about cookery.

A little of this should be put into the soup prior to the three hour’s simmering stage, if a golden brown be the tint desired. The utmost care should be taken to prevent the caramel burning: if it turns black, the prepa- ration is spoiled.

The old cooks, who studied the art, and were encouraged in its cultiva- tion, have passed away to their happy hunting grounds ; and the sons and grandsons, who now reign in their stead, have been taught to devote themselves to more fashionable dishes. While, however, it cannot be denied that the banish- ment of curries from the menus of our high-art banquets, both great and small, is, for many reasons, indispensably necessary, there can be no doubt that at mess and club dinners, at hotels, and at private houses, as already shown, these time-honoured dishes will always be welcome. Has not the time arrived then for us to endeavour to resuscitate the ancient cunning of our books, and to take some pains to attain that end'?

One of the causes of our daily failures is undoubtedly the lazy habit we have adopted of per- mitting our cooks to fabricate their “ curry-stuff,” on the spot, as it is required.

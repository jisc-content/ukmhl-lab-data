4o ON STOCK, AND CLEAN SOUPS. returns the meat, &c., to the pot again, covers it with water, and lets that boil away. The liquid thus produced, I need scarcely say, is terrible to look upon, and very nasty to taste, the whole essence of the meat having been frittered away by the first process. It is a dull, greasy- looking fluid like dish washings. Nevertheless Bamasamy strains it off and calls it the “second sort gravy.” He next amalgamates the two “sorts,” browns the mixture with burnt onion, and clarifies it (as a I’ule but partially) with the white of an egg. Having got it as clear as he can, be rasps some raw potato into it to obtain a nice glutinous starch, and when the soup seems sufficiently gummy, he strains once more and sends it to table. Setting aside other considerations, pray observe the wastefulness of this awful process. It is not exaggeration to say that half the quantity of soup-meat and bone requir- ed by the ignorant native cook might be saved if he could be prevailed upon to follow the laws of intelligent cookery. At the Hill stations of India, and in places where the temperature does not rise above 70°, stock can be made and kept as it is in England; but it is a mistake to add the vegetables until the day on which the soup is to be served. First make the pure consomme with water, meat, bone, and salt, as described for pot-au-feu, omitting all vege- tables and flavourings. This must be poured into china or enamelled basins, and kept in a cool larder, as milk is kept. The process of adding vegetables, &c., should be proceeded with as if the making of the pot-au-feu had been divided into two parts. Bring the consomme to the boil before adding anything. Stock while keeping should be boiled up daily, after which it may be replaced as before in the larder.

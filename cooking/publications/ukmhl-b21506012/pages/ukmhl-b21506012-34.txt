22 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. One mincing machine, and a tin box with divisions for a small supply of pepper-corns, salt, ground pepper, sugar, &c. A wooden slab, (or marble if you can get one) for pastry, with rolling pin is necessary, and also a pestle and mortar. A stone or iron one is best for India; I have lost two Wedgwood mortars—broken through careless use on a stone-paved floor. I strongly recommend that every cook should have at least four common earthenware or enamelled bowls, two of them with lips, for setting stock, gravies, &c., &c., and it will be found as well to give him a few cheap ci*ockery sun- dries for exclusive use in his kitchen. If not, portions of your breakfast and dinner sets will find their wajr to the cook-room, and the list of killed, wounded, and missing will become alarming. I think the following sufficient for a small kitchen : two jugs, two cups and saucers, a wine-glass for measurement, six plates, three soup plates, two large and four small flat dishes, two small basins, and three wire covers to protect meat, &c , from flies : these articles may obviously be of the commonest-ware, or better still of grey enamelled iron. 1 Dishing-up fork. 2 Common forks. 5 Cook’s knives in sizes. 1 Eoot knife. 1 Mincing knife. 1 Chopping board. 1 Toasting fork. 1 Block tin colander 2 Tin gravy strainers. 2 Pointed gravy do. 1 Wire sieve. 2 Hair sieves of sizes. 1 Wire frying basket. aspics mignons. 1 Paste jagger. 1 Set of pastry cutters. 1 Dozen patty pans. | A dozen mince pie pans. 1 Baking sheet. 2 Baking tins. 2 Bread or cake tins. 2 Souffle tins of sizes. 1 Set of freezing Utensils. 3 Jelly moulds of sizes. 12 Small tin moulds for 1 Coffee mill.

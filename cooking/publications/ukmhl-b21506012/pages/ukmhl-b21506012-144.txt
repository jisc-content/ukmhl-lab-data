CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 182 ner cooked in its own vapour and juices ; but in the matter of fuel braising is by far the more expensive method, while the careful regulation of the heat, itc., costs infinitely more trouble than the simple boiling of a Warren’s pot. The one process requires the hand of a chef: the other can be managed by any one. The not uncommon practice of partly roasting a joint ‘ after it has been nearly cooked in a Warren’s pot is erro- neous. The result can at best be that of meat half-boiled, half-roasted,—“neither fish, nor fowl, nor good red her- ring,” so to speak. A good cook ought, by the clever treat- ment of the gravy made by the meat, to be able to diversify both the appearance and flavour of the joint, adding to its attractiveness by a tasteful garnish of maccaroni or vege- tables. The utmost cleanliness is absolutely necessary in the use of Warren’s pot. Somewhat similar in treatment is the process of Jugging. There is, I think, a dish called by Eamasamy “ boiled chops," cooked in this manner, which is familiar to every one in this part of India, and really deserving of attention, for it is susceptible of improvement, and far greater develop- ment. A nice steak ; a dish of neck cutlets ; the blade bone of the shoulder, boned and flattened ; a tender fowl, boned and flattened ; game similarly prepared, and even fish, can thus be dressed very daintily. I advocate the making of a vessel specially for “ jugged " dishes, as follows :—An oval tin, ten inches long, and seven and a half inches across ; one inch and three-quarters deep. The tin should have its upper edge turned outwards like a pie-dish, half an inch wide, so that a flat cover may be pasted closely to it, and it should have a ring at each end to serve for handles. The cover should be an oval sheet of tin slightly larger in its measurements than the interior

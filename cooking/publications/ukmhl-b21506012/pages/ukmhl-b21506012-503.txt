MENU FOB A PARTY OF SIX. 491 with salt, white and red pepper, a few drops of anchovy sauce, a little pounded mace, and work the whole together with some nice freshly made butter till thoroughly incorpo- rated: set it in an earthenware jar, and pour a spoonful of melted butter over the surface. This simple dish should be noted :— Cut up a well grown chicken as if for fricassee, and mari- nade the pieces in salad oil with the juice of a lime, an onion sliced in rings, pepper and salt. Half an hour before serving, take out the onion, and wipe the pieces of chicken on a cloth, then dip them in milk, flour them well, and fry in plenty of hot fat accelerating the heat during the pro- cess. When the pieces are cooked, having been fried a golden yellow colour, pile them on a napkin garnished with crisply fried parsley. A nice sauce should accom- pany in a boat, bread sauce, poivrade, or Robert. Take half a pound of sifted flour; put it on the paste board ; make a hole in the centre of the flour ; break three eggs in it; add half an ounce of butter, and a pinch of salt; mix all into a nice smooth paste. Roll the paste out very thin, say about the sixteenth of an inch, let it dry, then cut it into ribbons an inch and a half broad; put live of these ribbons above one another, sprinkling a little flour between each; then with a knife cut through them crosswise, making thin shreds like vermicelli; shake them in a cloth with a little flour to prevent them adhering to one another, then throw them into two quarts of boiling water for six minutes. Use no aides exactly as you would maccaroni. <► Fritot de volaille. Nouilles.

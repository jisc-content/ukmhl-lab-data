551 OUR KITCHENS IN INDIA room, ancl the “ few useful kitchen sundries” in the back verandah, is often very striking. The loan system is also eloquent of the inefficient equip- ments of our neighbours. To meet the culinary wants of a dinner party at the Robsons’, the Dobsons’ ice-pail, fish- kettle, and sieves, are requisitioned ; and vice versd, when the Dobsons invite their friends, the Robsons’ kitchen is pillaged to the extent of a border mould, a ham boiler, and the pastry cutters. I need say no more about equipments : those who are interested in the matter will find a list of kitchen neces- saries at page 21. Having, I hope, satisfactorily demonstrated thatakitchen range should surely find a place in the category of things to be “ devoutly wished for” by all who take any interest in their cuisine, let me now point out a few of the advan- tages to be derived from the use of one. After having once set up a good range, the purchaser ought, in the first place, to experience a marked diminu- tion in his fuel account. The native cook’s objection “ too much firewood taking” is, let me observe, a downright perversion of fact. If properly understood, and utilized to its full extent, the English range, with its one fire, must surely consume less fuel than do the numerous open fires in an Indian cook-room. This is self-evident. According to the method that is followed in the latter system, a separate fire is required for each thing—for the bath water, the kettle, the oven, the sauce and stew-pans, &c., &c. A range provided with a hot-plate, an oven, and a boiler, supplies with its one fire all these wants at once. Vessels, the contents of which require rapid boiling, are placed over the fire-hole, while things needing slow treat- ment, like soups, stews, &e., find a place upon the hot- plate, or fiat surface of the range. The oven is, of course,

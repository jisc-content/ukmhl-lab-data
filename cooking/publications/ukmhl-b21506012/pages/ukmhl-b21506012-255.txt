SAVOURY TOASTS. 243 of grated Parmesan cheese should be shaken over the sur- face of the toasts as an embellishment, and Nepaul pepper should be handed round. Milk may be used instead of the cream. Very young brintals (binegun) may be treated exactly in the same manner as the foregoing, as also the pods of the moringa (“ drum-stick ”) tree. Be sure that you select tender pods for toast-making, or the result will disappoint you. A very superior dish of this kind can be concocted if you happen to be able to obtain the flower-pod of a cocoa- nut palm. Treat the buds of the embryo flower which the pod contains as laid down for bande-cai; that is to say, boil the flower, after you have cut it out of the pod, in salt and water till tender, then cut off the buds, and heat them up in a sauce-pan in thickened cream, or in milk thickened with yolks of two eggs, pour them over hot fried toasts, which should he sent up immediately. The white stalks of the flower, if quite young, can be served exactly like asparagus, i.e.—boiled, laid in a very hot dish, with plenty of butter melting over them, or maitre cl’hotel butter if at hand, and’assisted by “ Dutch sauce.” No toast is needed in this case. The coeoanut flower-pods can be obtained now and then at Madras, for the toddy- drawers cut them off when tapping the palms for sap. I can strongly recommend my readers to try both the dishes I have mentioned. Sardine toast, herring toast,' cod’s-roe toast, pil- chard toast, salmon toast, <&c., &c., are all" nice, and very easily made. Trim the fish free from oil, skin, fins, bones, &c., and chop it up on a plate, give it a dust of Nepaul pepper, with a very little salt, and knead it up with a little butter. Put a part of butter at the bottom of a sauce-pan, proceed as if to make a sauce blanche with a little milk, incorporate

240 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. Kidney toast is generally far from being considered a very dainty one. Let me suggest two methods, one with the kidneys au natural, the other made with those which you can cut out of a cold roast saddle (a)—Take four ordinary kidneys, and blanch them first of all in scalding water (as recommended in-Menu No. 23) then lift them out, and dry them in a cloth. Make a strong broth or gravy out of any bones or scraps you may have, and stew the kidneys therein till they are nice and tender, then take them out, drain them, aud pour the gravy in which they were cooked into a bowl. Now, cut up and pound the kidneys to a paste in your mortar with some butter, and pass it through your sieve. When ready, skim any grease that may have risen to the top of your gravy, and take a me- dium-sized sauce-pan, working as follows :—Melt a dessert- spoonful of butter at the bottom of the sauce-pan, stir into it a dessert-spoonful of flour, when creamy, add by degrees a breakfast-cupful of the gravy and lastly, kidney-paste until all is expended : flavour the puree, with one dessert- spoonful portwine, one tea-spoonful red current jelly, one dessert-spoonful anchovy vinegar, and a few drops of chilli vinegar. Let the contents of your sauce-pan thicken properly by coming to the boil, and then pour the puree over four squares of hot fried toast. Let there be no delay in serving. If made exactly in this way, this toast will be found an excellent one. Madeira or Marsala may be used instead of port. (ft)—Cut the kidneys out of the cold saddle, together with all the fat belonging to them ; chop up as much fat as there is of kidney meat for the toast, and throw the remaining fat, freed from all burnt skin, &c., into your frying-pan : now, fry in the melted' fat a large round of bread till it turns golden yellow, and has sucked up a good deal of the fat. Take it out, place it on a flat silver dish, cover its surface with the chopped pieces of kidney

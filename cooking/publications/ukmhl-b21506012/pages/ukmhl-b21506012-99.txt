SA UC.ES. 87 There are nevertheless several standard sauces which must be spoken of independently ; for instance, melted butter (sauce blanche), Hollandaise, soulnse, vnaitre d’hdtel, bread-sauce, mayonnaise, tar-tare, r&moulacJe, ravigote, Robert, piquante, t&c. Let us take these first, for they are perhaps more simple, and certainly oftener in request than Espagnole, veloute, and their various descendants. Simple Sauces. Failure in the composition of “melt.ed-but.ter” (sauce blanche) is so common, that I will commence with a few hints with regard to that homely preparation. The pith of this sauce consists in melting your lump of butter {good butter mind) first at the bottom of your sauce-pan, next to add the flour, which soon forms a smooth paste when worked with the melted butter, and then by degrees the warm water, or milk and water with a pinch of salt. Work this well with a wooden spoon till it is soft and creamy to look upon, pass it through your tin strainer into a hot sauce boat, and, as you serve it, add a pat of fresh butter the size of a rupee, which will, of course, melt of its own accord, and give that ‘ buttery ’ flavour which you desire—not that ‘ flour-and-watery’ one so suggestive of the composition you would employ for fixing scraps in an album. For half a pint of good white sauce, you will require two ounces of butter, one ounce of flour, a salt-spoonful of salt, and half a pint of warm broth, or milk and water. Use one ounce of butter, and the flour first, and save the extra ounce of butter to finish with. As flours vary in their thickening power it is possible the sauce may sometimes seem a little too thick. In this case a slight addition of broth or water will set matters- straight, but this should be done before the final addition of pure butter.

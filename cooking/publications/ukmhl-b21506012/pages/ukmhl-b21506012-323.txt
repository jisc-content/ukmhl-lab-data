our CURRIES. 311 kept during the night in a china curry dish, and be resus- citated the next morning with some fresh butter, onions and a little gravy, it ought, if anything, to he found better than on the previous night, since the meat has become thoroughly flavoured by the curry gravy, while the latter is of course reduced and so strengthened by the second simmering. These directions will be found pi~acticable with most ordinary meat curries. Those made of fresh fish, prawns, and shellfish, require a somewhat different process, while those of cut up, or minced cooked meat, tinned or cooked fish, dressed vegetables, and hard-boiled eggs, merely require to he gently heated up in a carefully-made curry The Malay or “Ceylon curry,” as it is sometimes called, is, of course, a specialite and there are kubdbs, quoornias, it’c., <fc., that need separate consideration. Above all things it is necessary to achieve our end by patience. Slorv cookery is the backbone of curry-making. Is not this dish too frequently presented- to us with the chicken like leather, and the gravy around it like oily water apd snuff ? Unless the process he gentle, the former result is certain, and if we do not cook our curry-powder and paste carefully, a crude, snuff-like effect is equally sure. The infusion of the nut is quite as essential as the curry-powder itself. Rice is of course the standard concomitant of curries of all kinds. For the correct method of boiling it, see page gravy. 257.

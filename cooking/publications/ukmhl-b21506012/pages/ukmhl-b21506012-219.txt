207 ON LUNCHEONS. piece of Grny&re, and two ripe plantains, is nice, but the taste of eating cheese with fruits is, I fear, un-English. The traveller’s luncheon basket, and that of the sports- man are analogous. A friend of mine with whom I used to walk the paddy fields, adopted the plan of taking out a digester pot, previously filled with stewed steak and oys- ters, or some equally toothsome stew. This he trusted to his syce, who lit a fire somewhere or other, in the marvel- lous way the natives of this country never fail to do, and, always had the contents of the pot steaming hot at the exact spot, and at the very moment we required it. But I think that a good cold lunch is the best for the open air, when work must follow. I can recommend a galantine made of a small fowl, boned and rolled, with a block of tongue and some forcemeat introduced in the centre of it. A home-made brawn of tongue, a part of an ox head, with a good allowance of fat bacon cut in dice and some sheep’s trotters, well seasoned, and sightly spiced, is another sj)ecialite worth noting. A nice piece of the brisket of beef salted and spiced, boil- ed, boned, placed under a weight, and then trimmed into a neat shape (the trimmings come in for sandwiches, potted- meat, or “ bubble and squeak ”) is a very handy thing for the tiffin basket; and a much respected patron of mine recommends for travelling, a really good cold plum-pudding in which a glass of brandy has been included. Cake is acceptable at every kind of luncheon ; in fact, cakes were invented for that meal, for 5 o’clock tea, wed- dings, and for school-boys only.

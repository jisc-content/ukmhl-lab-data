I 16 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. Poultry, ducks, and geese, are far better braised than roasted, unless you keep a fowl-yard of your own, and feed and kill the birds at home. To braise poultry well, you. must make the gravy from the giblets, and trimmings of the birds, assisted by a little gravy-meat. See addenda page 110. In fact all braises are better if you help the gravy with a little extra meat. The French throw in a glass or two of light white wine when braising poultry, and a glass of Madeira or Marsala with a like quantity of Har- vey sauce is a sterling aid in cooking mutton or beef in this method. A slice of bacon is very effective with all braised meat Roasting. Roasting in India is carried out on the spit, accordingly if you must roast your little joint, see that it is not actually spitted,—that is, thrust through by the spit. With a little care, a small Indian joint can easily be tied to it. By the use of a “ cradle-spit ” you obviate even this trouble. Do not let your cook use coarse wooden skewers, but make hiril tie a joint into a shape with tape, for every stab inflicted in it will rob the piece of meat of its juiciness. Tastes vary so strangely as to the “ doing ” of meat, that is is impossible to lay down a law as to time in roasting. Commence by putting the meat close to the coals for six or eight minutes to seal the surface, and secure the inter- nal juices as much as possible : then move it further back. It is essential to use an equal fire throughout the process, and to guard against cooking the joint too fast. Frequent basting is a sine qua non, and you should dredge a little flour over the meat to finish with, to produce a crisp, brown, frothy surface. You should preserve the fat of your sirloin, or loin of mutton, by tying over it a wrapper of buttered paper. The French place their small joints in marinade, which I described fully in Chapter VIII, page 70. This process

SOS OUR CURRIES. on a frosty day used to be a thing worth recording in a pilgrim’s diary with red letters. Assuming that we have procured, or made, a really good stock powder, the accessories next present themselves for our consideration. These are very important, for, with their aid, a clever cook can diversify the flavour, and style of his curries; without them—he the powder or paste never so well composed—the dish will certainly lack finish, and the true characteristics of a good curry.

190 CULINARY JOTTINGS NOR MADRAS. at a traveller’s bungalow, at a picnic, or in the privacy of our back verandah in cantonment. Eggs, though neither as cheap, nor as plentiful as in days of yore, are still to be got: we can obtain charcoal, and a broken chatty to bold it: we can get an iron omelette-pan, made to order, in the bazar: we need never be without a tin of “Normandy,” “Denmark,” or “cow brand” butter; or, failing that, a bottle of the best salad oil. Salt, pepper, and a bottle of dried parsley ought not to be beyond our reach, and an onion is not an expensive luxury. Thus provided, we ought to be in a position to turn out a capital dish, very rapidly, at any time, and anywhere. Omelettes, as you all know, can be diversified ad libitum : we need never, therefore, be afraid of falling back upon them. Before I proceed to the discussion of omelette-maikmg, however, let me point out that Ramasamy has been led astray altogether with regard to this branch of bis art. He sends you up a very nice pudding, symmetrical in de- sign, of a goodly consistency, and of a rich brown colour- You almost require a dessert-knife to help it. It is, of course, lighter somewhat than a ‘ roly-poly’ pudding made of paste, but it greatly resembles that homely composition. It is a first cousin of the pancake, and Ramasamy evidently uses the stuff of which it is made to coat his plantains when bidden to make fritters. He starts wrongly to commence with, when mixing bis omelette. In addition to the eggs (the whites of which he whips separately) lie puts in a little flour, some milk or a little water, and, in point of fact, makes a lightish sort of batter. This, I l’egret to say, he mixes, vigorously whips, and fries in a fair amount of ghee, folding it into shape, and keeping it on the fire till it is nice and firm, and coloured as I before described. That tins is no more an omelette than our old friend “ the man in the moon” 1 need hardly assure you. Native cooks are nevertheless

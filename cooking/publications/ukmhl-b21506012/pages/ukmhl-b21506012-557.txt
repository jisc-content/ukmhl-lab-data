OUR KITCHENS IN INDIA. 545 The day’s work having been completed, the doors of the three rooms should be carefully locked, and the whole corps de cuisine dismissed, the keys being brought to the mistress of the house. The idea of the kitchen being used by a number of native employes as a sleeping chamber is obvi- ously too horrible to need more than a passing remark. The two chief objections that will here suggest them- selves will be, I feel sure, on the one hand the difficulty of establishing the kind of kitchen I have described, and, on the other, the expense of equipping it according to the standard which obtains in England.

Few owners of houses would go to the expense of a new building.

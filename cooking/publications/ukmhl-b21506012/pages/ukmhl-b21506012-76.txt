CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 64 round it, sending up the rest of the broth first, poured boiling hot over some slices of stale bread. * Remove the bag of condiments, of course, before serving the bouilla- baisse. The dish may not he as good, to he sure, as that which some of ray readers may have enjoyed in the south of Prance, but if the ingredients I have named be used without any omissions, a very fair imitation will certainly be produced. In regard to the sauces which should accompany fish directions will be found elsewhere. I would, however, here emphasize the importance of a good fish stock as the true basis of them. It has been shown that the water in which a fish has been boiled is highly charged with nutri- tive matter, and that if reduced it becomes when cold a fish jelly. It surely stands to reason then that to throw this away is an act of sublime ignorance, since it at once supplies the best medium possible for- the sauce. For fried, broiled, baked, and stewed fish, the trimmings provide admirable stock stuff:—heads, livers, bones, fins, tails, skin, &c. This fresh essence should be used instead of water, or milk for all fish sauces, and for moistening au gratins. Having thus sketched the various ways of preparing fish for the table, I must request my readers to note the recipes I have given in detail in my moms. One word of appeal before I pass on to another sub- ject :—Please give up the utterly inexplicable and cer- tainly most erroneous practice of serving salad with eggxj dressing, cucumber (cold), and beetroot, with hot fish, and absolutely on the same hot plate ! The individual answer- able for the introduction of this barbarism should he con- demned to eat lukewarm salad on a hot plate three times a day in penal servitude for life !

MENU FOB A PABTY OF EIGHT. 400 of sugar. Stir in half an ounce of dissolved gelatine while the custard is warm, and whip it briskly and put it into the freezer. Freeze, mixing into the half-frozen custard a coffee-cupful of whipped cream. Turn it out when ready, cover with the case, and serve. Note.—To adapt this menu, you need only insert after the fish, Bceuf ci la mode, vide page 123. Instead of No. 8 give a chocolate ice at dessert:—Glace,—creme ait cliocolat. ♦ Smoked fish—Pomfret specially. Clean and wash the fish, cut in two pieces if a flat fish, if otherwise cut it in slices about half an inch thick, remove all bones, dry on a clean cloth. Prepare a fire of cocoanut fibre (coir) : it produces a fine smoke: place an oiled grid-iron over the smoke, and after well buttering the fish on both sides, lay it on the grid, cover it over with the lid of a cooking pot to concentrate the smoke : in about ten minutes the fish will turn a rich reddish brown on the side meeting the smoke, now turn it over, and let it take colour on the other side : it is now ready. A little anchovy sauce may be mixed with the butter when buttering the fish. Serve with any nice sauce.

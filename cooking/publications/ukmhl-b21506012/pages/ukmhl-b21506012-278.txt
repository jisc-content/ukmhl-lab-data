CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. 266 The tongue, having been drained for six or eight hours, should be placed in the brine in the evening, where it ought to remain for a couple of days, being frequently turned over and basted during that period. On the evening of the second dayâ€™s soaking the tongue must be drained from the brine, and then hung to dry in the smoke of the kitchen fire for a couple of days, after which it may be considered fit to use. Wrap it in paper during the smoking stage, and soak it a little before cook- ing in cold water. The above process can, of course, be depended upon for preserving tongues for much longer periods. I can recom- mend it to sportsmen who, after killing deer or bison in the jungle, hardly know what to do with the good meat thrown upon their hands. A brine tub for tongues and humps would not seriously increase their impedimenta, and a moderately quick servant could soon master the secret of curing. Artificial smoking can easily be manag- ed out in camp, and the ingredients I have named can be carried out of cantonment without much trouble. Never mind if a tongue seem to shrivel up after the smoking stage; after the soaking, which it must receive before cook- ing, it will revive wonderfully, and regain its original pro- portions. A tongue that has merely lain in brine for a couple of days may be cooked at once withot smoking; soaking is then unnecessary: but a well smoked tongue requires soaking, according to the degree of dryness it may have attained, from two hours upwards. Tongues have an annoying habit of curling themselves round, contracting, that is to say, as they get cold after cooking. To combat this unsightliness, and straighten the tongue, Ramasamy is wont to thrust a good thick wooden skewer straight through it from end to end, which

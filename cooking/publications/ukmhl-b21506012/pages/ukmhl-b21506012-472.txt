MENU FOR A DINNER OF SIX. 460 Choose a small sauce-pan, melt an ounce of butter in it, stir in the caviare, dust it well with Nepaul pepper, and add the juice of a lime. When piping hot, spread the caviare over the fried bread (which should have been kept in the oven) and send up the canapes without delay. Or,—spread the caviare cold over the cold fried bread, mask the surface with thick mayonnaise sauce, and garnish with a turned olive upon each.

Make a rich custard with ten yolks of eggs, Orleans pudclmg. -><• three-quarters of a pound of sugar, and a quart of boiled milk. Add the gelatine to the cus- tard while the latter is hot, and stir it until it is dissolved ; flavour it with essence of almond, then strain it into a bowl. Cut up one ounce of candied orange peel, one ounce of citron, one ounce of raisins, and one ounce of currants, wash them well, dry them, and then toss the minced con- fitures in a frying-pan with a small tumbler of rum : as soon as the rum is absorbed, stop and take the pan off the fire. Put a mould upon ice, pour a layer of custard into it first with some of the minced fruit; when set, put a layer of crushed ratafias, then another layer of custard with fruit, again crushed ratafias, and so on till the mould is filled, cover it in ice and let it rest for an hour, then turn it out and serve. If cream be used instead of milk for the custard, a richer result may be obtained; a good pudding is nevertheless to be made with milk. Half these quantities will be enough for a party of six, i.c., a pint mould. Genoises ail cliocolat.

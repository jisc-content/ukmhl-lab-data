274 CULINARY JOTTINGS FOR MADRAS. pestle and one spoon. This I consider a matter of material consequence. Setting aside all hypercritical notions of cleanliness, it stands to reason that the less the paste is touched by the warm human hand, the better and lighter it will prove. Similarly, therefore, let the turns in the rolling-out stage be done with two spoons. If the mixing stage were carried out in a roomy enamelled iron pan, or bowl, set in ice, the spoon process could be easily managed. Pastry should be made, if possible, in the morning before the real heat of the day had set in. Fruit tarts are far nicer cold than hot, why not make them early then ? Or if you like them-served hot, why not re-heat them in the oven at the time they are required ? For patties, bouchees, timbales, tartlets, cheese-cakes, &c., this course is strongly to be advocated. The pastry cases ought to be made early, baked at once and put away ; in the evening they should be filled with the salpicon, purdc, jam, cheese-cake mixture, or confiture, be re-heated in the oven, and sent to table. A most important feature in pastry is its baking. Too slack, or too fierce an oven, will destroy all the careful work I have just described. A good hot oven is requh'ed, suffi- ciently brisk to raise the pastry, yet not severe enough to burn or even scorch it. Ramasamy is inclined to err on the side of extreme heat, which, I think, accounts for those harsh, talc-like slabs of pale brown crust, piled up one on top of the other, which so many of us are forced to accept as “puff-paste.” The higher that these layers of talc have “done raise it uff,” the more successful does Ramasamy consider himself. “Erroneous vassal !” Puff-pastry can- not be too white, or too volatile ; so fragile indeed should it be that it ought e’en to crumble to atoms if stricken with a feather. And now for a few words touching ingredients :— The flour used should be the best imported, and in a moist

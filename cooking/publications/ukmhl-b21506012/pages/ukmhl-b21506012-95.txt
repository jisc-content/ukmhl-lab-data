83 ENTREES—CONULUDED. front of you tells you what is coming, and in this way you would be spared, at all events, the unpleasantness of having a hot silver dish with its savoury contents thrust in between you and the lady you have taken in to dinner ; conversation would never be auuoyingly interrupted ; pretty costumes and dress coats would he less liable to be baptized with hot gravy, whilst much valuable time would be saved. The action of the punkah too ought not to be forgotten in regard to its effect on a hot entree in slow procession at a large dinner party. Since the foregoing remarks were written I have entirely given up the handing round of entrees, and the result has been most satisfactory. The advantages gained are :— (a) . The entree itself is not slightly spoiled as it cer- tainly is when slowly handed round. (b) . The guests are spared the trouble of helping them- selves, a thing most of them do not understand. (c) . There is much valuable time saved, first in not having to change the plates all round the table, and then in substituting direct service, sur les plats, for the circula- tion pf the dish itself and its sauce. (fl). The erection of a beautiful edifice, so dear to the French cook’s heart, is rendered unnecessary : the cutlet, fillet, or whatever it is, is put on the hot plate straight from the fire, together with the correct allowance of gar- nish and sauce straight from the bain-marie, and passed to the guest at once. Thus we have one operation in the kitchen only—the intermediate decorative process beiim altogether eliminated. All you have to do is to instruct your head servant very carefully, and to see that the cook and he understand each other as to each plat, its garnish, and sauce. To insure this, have instructions jotted down on paper for the butler’s guidance.

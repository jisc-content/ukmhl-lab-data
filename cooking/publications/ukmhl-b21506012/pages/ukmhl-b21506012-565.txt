The extraction of the nutritive elements of meat and bone requires, we all know, that slow process of cookery called simmering—a process as readily carried out with an English range, as it is almost impossible with the open brick-and-mud fire-places of the cook-room. At least, it stands to reason that—be the tunny-cutch never so careful —the low fire, at an even degree of temperature, which simmering requires, can scarcely be maintained for hours together by the eye and hand alone. With a range in our kitchen, therefore, all we should have to do would be to explain the simmering system, and point out how easily it can be managed. Then, as soon as the native cook discovered that all that was necessary was to pull his soup kettle so many inches back upon the hot- plate, he would do so, for the new plan would not interfere with his customary absence for “rice.” In the end we should get a soup of superior quality extracted from about half the quantity of meat that we formerly issued. In like manner all dishes requiring slow cookery, hashes, stews, sauces,—even our curries, which are often sent up tough from being too quickly cooked,—would be easily prepared, and certainly be far more digestible. The cleanli- ness of the system need not be dwelt upon, smoke would become a thing unknown, and ashes could no longer be wafted by every breeze into our food. With so much to be said in favour of the kitchen range, it seems strange that its cost should be considered pro- hibitive by so many well-to-do people in India. If pro- perly used the economies it effects must, in the end, repay its purchase, while it ought to be at all times a very sale- able article. Why, I repeat, should we hesitate to provide ourselves in India with an appliance that in England is re- 55

MENU FOB A LITTLE HOME DINNER. 529 singe, ancl tress the fiorican, placing a Bombay onion, rolled in fat boiled bacon, inside its carcass. Tie a thin slice of bacon over the breast, and roast the bird over a moderate fire, basting it frequently with melted butter. A few minutes before the fiorican is done, remove the slice of bacon, so as to let the breast take colour. Serve with plain gravy, fried crumbs, and bread sauce. Time, about thirty minutes. Proceed in the same way if you happen to have a wild peachick, a young jungle fowl, or a spur fowl. A most appropriate accompaniment to roast fiorican, roast pheasant, guinea-fowl, &c., are :— Croustades de truffes a l’Espagnole. Line as many little open tartlet pans as you have guests with some carefully made short-bread paste. An oval not much larger than the bowl of the table-spoon is the shape best suited to the purpose. Butter them well first to keep them from burning, and preserve their hollow centres while baking them by a piece of stale bread, to be removed after- wards. Cut up some truffles in dice, using enough to yield a good dessert-spoonful per bead. Warm the mince up gently in some rich Espacgnole sauce flavoured with a dash of Madeira, and keep it en bain-marie. When wanted, fill the crisp crotistades with a spoonful each of the truffles and sauce, dish them en serviette, and send them round with the bird. Groustacles de champignons, made in the same way but substituting mushrooms for truffles, may be served with roast game very effectively. 52

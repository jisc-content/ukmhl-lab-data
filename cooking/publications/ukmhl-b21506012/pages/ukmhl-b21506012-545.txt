Good fresh butter, red or yellow pepper, and salt, constitute all their accompaniments. 5. —Boil four eggs hard, put them into a basin of cold water; when cold, cut them in halves Jerusalem artichokes crosswise with a dessert-knife dipped in melted butter. Slice off a piece from each rounded end, so that the halves will sit upright, and prepare the yolks as laid down at page 253. Boil four large Jerusalem artichokes : when just done, and not overdone mind, lift them out of the water, and let them get cold : out of each artichoke, trim with a silver dessert-knife two thick flat slices each capable of holding a half egg, butter the eight slices, lay them upon a flat augratin dish well buttered, and set half an egg upon each of them: put on the top of each egg a little pat of anchovy butter, set the dish in the oven till the steam rises freely, and serve piping hot. If you can pour some melted maitre d’hdtel or prawn butter over them, the dish becomes quite worth serving at a dinner party. 6. —Line six tartlet tins with puff paste, and fill the „ patties with this mixture :—Beat half “ Maids of honour.” 1 n „ . pound sugar with yolks of six eggs m a basin, and pound together in a mortar two ounces of blanched sweet almonds, three bitter ones, two table-spoon- fuls of orange-flower water, the juice of four limes, and two potatoes (mealy ones) boiled, drained, and passed through a hair sieve. Mix the eggs, sugar, and almond paste. Turn a quarter of milk to curd, crumble it, and beat it up with four ounces of good butter till quite smooth, then mix it thoroughly with the eggs, almonds, &c., adding a glass of brandy, and one of maraschino. Bake till thoroughly hot in a moderate oven, and serve with finely sifted sugar dust- ed over them.

If you follow these rules closely, you ought never to fail to turn out nice fritters, provided, of course, that your hatter be properly made. I cannot too strongly impress upon you the necessity of attention to this part of the work which so many cooks slur over carelessly. I have adopted as a stan- dard batter in my own kitchen one recommended by the “G. C.,” whose advice I have so often quoted in these pages.

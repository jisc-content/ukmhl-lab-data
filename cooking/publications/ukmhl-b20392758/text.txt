Nothing lovelier can be found la Woman, than to study household good.—Milton, LONDON: S. 0. BBETON, 248, STEAND, Tv.a 1861.LONDON: COX AND WYMAN, PRINTERS, GREAT QUEEN-STilEET, LINCOLN'S-INN FIELDS.PEEFACE. I MUST frankly own, that if I liad known, beforeliand, tliat) lliis book wonld have cost me the labour which it has, I should never have been courageous enough to commence it. What moved me, in the first instance, to attempt a work like this, was the discomfort and suffering which I had seen brought upon men and women by household mismanagement. I have always thought that there is no m.ore fruitful source of family discontent tha,n ?u housewife's badly-cooked dinners and untidy ways. Men are now so well served out of doors,—at their clubs, v»^ell-ordered taverns, and dining-houses, that in order to compete with the attractions of these places, a mistress must be thoroughly acquainted with the theory and practice of cookery, as Vv^ell as l^e perfectly conversant with all the other arts of making and keeping a comfortable home. In this book I have attempted to give, under the chapters devoted to cookery, an intelligible arrangement to every recipe, a list of the ingredients, a plain statement of the mode of preparing each dish, and a careful estimate of its cost, the mtinher of Ijeojple for vv^hom it is sufficient, and the time v/hen it is seasoncihle. For the matter of the recipes, I am indebted, in some measure, to many correspondents of the " Englislwoman's Domestic Maga- zine," who have obligingly placed at my disposal their formulge for many original preparations. A large lorivate circle has also rendered me considerable service. A diligent study of the works of the best modern wiiters on cookery was also necessary to the faithful fulfilment of my task. Friends in England, Scotland, Ireland, France, and Germany, have eJso very materially aided me. I have paid great attention to those recipes which come under the head of " Cold Meat Cookery." But in the depart- ment belonging to the Cook I have striven, too, to make my work something more than a Cookery Book, and have, therefore, on theiv PREFACE. best authority tliat I could obtain, given an account of tlie natural liistory of the animals and vegetables v^^hicli we use as food. I have followed the animal from his birth to his appearance on the table; have described the manner of feeding him, and of slaying him, the position of his various joints, and, after giving the recipes, have described the modes of carving Meat, Poultry, and Game. Skilful artists have designed the nrmierous drav/ings vfhich appear in this v/orli, and which illustrate, better than any description, many important and interesting items. The coloured plates are a novelty not without value. Besides the great portion of the book which has especial reference to the cook's department, there are chapters devoted to those of the other servants of the household, who have all, I trust, their duties clearly assigned to them. Towards the end of the work will be found valuable chapters on the Management of Children "—" The Doctor," the latter principally referring to accidents and emergencies, some of which are certain to occur in the experience of every one of us; and the last chapter contains " Legal Memoranda," which will be service- able in cases of doubt as to the proper course to be adopted in the relations between Landlord and Tenant, Tax-gatherer and Tax-payer, and Tradesman and Customer. These chapters have been contributed by gentlemen fully en- titled to confidence; those on medical subjects by an experienced surgeon, and the legal matter by a solicitor. I wish hero to acknowledge the kind letters and congratulations I have received during the progress of this work, and have only further to add, that I trust the result of the four years' incessant hiljour Y/hich I have expended will not be altogether unacceptable ,■:') som.e of my countrymen and countrywomen.

As WITH THE Commander op an Army, or the leader of any enterprise, so is it with the mistress of a house. Her spirit will be seen through the whole establishment; and just in proportion as she performs her duties intel- ligently and thoroughly, so will her domestics follow in her path. Of all those acquirements, which more particularly belong to the feminine character, there are none which take a higher rank, in our estimation, than such as enter into a knowledge of household duties ; for on these are perpetually dependent the happiness, comfort, and well-being of a family. In this opinion we are borne out by the author of ''The Vicar of Wakefield," who says: ''The modest virgin, the prudent wife, and the careful matron, are much more serviceable in life than petticoated philosophers, blustering heroines, or virago queens. She who makes her husband and her children happy, who reclaims the one from vice and trains up the other to virtue, is a much greater character than ladies described in romances, whose whole occupation is to murder mankind with shafts from their quiver, or their eyes." 2. Pursuing this Picture, we may add, that to be a good housewife does not necessarily imply an abandonment of proper pleasures or amusing recre- ation ; and we think it the more necessary to express this, as the perform- ance of the duties of a mistress may, to some minds, perhaps seem to bo B2 HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT. incompatible with the enjoyment of Hfe. Let us, however, now proceed to describe some of those home quahties and virtues which are necessary to the proper management of a Household, and then point out the plan which may be the most profitably pursued for the daily regulation of its aiiairs, 3. Early Eising is one of the most Essential Qualities which enter into good Household Management, as it is not only the parent of health, but of innumerable other advantages. Indeed, when a mistress is an early riser, it is almost certain that her house will be orderly and well-managed. On the contrary, if she remain in bed till a late hour, then the domestics, who, as we have before observed, invariably partake somewhat of their mistress's character, will surely become sluggards. To self-indulgence all are more or less disposed, and it is not to be exj)ected that servants arc freer from this fault than the heads of houses. The great Lord Chatham thus gave his advice in reference to this subject:—I would have inscribed on the curtains of your bed, and the walls of your chamber, ' If you do not rise early, you can make progress in nothing.'" 4. Cleanliness is also indispensable to Health, and must be studied both in regard to the person and the house, and all that it contains. Cold or tepid baths should be employed every morning, unless, on account of illness or other circumstances, they should be deemed objectionable. The bathing of children will be treated of under the head of Management qf Childken." 5. Frugality and Economy are Home Virtues, without which no household can prosper. Dr. Johnson says: ''Frugality may be termed the daughter of Prudence, the sister of Temperance, and the parent of Liberty. He that is extravagant will quickly become poor, and poverty will enforce dependence and invite corruption." The necessity of practising economy should be evident to every one, whether in the possession of an income no more than sufficient for a family's requirements, or of a large fortune, which puts financial adversity out of the question. We must always remember that it is a great merit in housekeeping to manage a little well. "He is a good waggoner," says Bishop Hall, " that can turn in a little room. To live well in abundance is the praise of the estate, not of the person. I will study more how to give a good account of my little, than how to make it more." In this there is true wisdom, and it may be added, that those who can manage a little well, are most likely to succeed in their management of larger matters. Economy and frugality must never, however, be allowed to degenerate into parsimony and meanness. 6. The Choice of Acquaintances is very important to the happiness of a mistress and her family^ A gossiping acquaint^vnce, who indulges in tb»THE MISTRESS. 3 scandal and ridicule of her neighbours, should be avoided as a pestilence. It is likewise all-necessary to beware, as Thomson sings, ''The whisper'd tale, That, like the fabling Nile, no fountain knows ,*— Fair-faced Deceit, whose wily, conscious eye Ne'er looks direct; the tongue that licks the lust But, when it safely dares, as prompt to sting.'* If the duties of a family do not sufficiently occupy the time of a mistress, society should be formed of such a kind as will tend to the nititiial interchange of general and interesting information. 7. Friendships should not be hastily formed, nor the heart given, at once, to every new-comer. There are ladies who uniformly smile at, and approve everything and everybody, and who possess neither the courage to repi-ehend vice, nor the generous warmth to defend virtue. The triendship of such persons is without attachment, and their love without affection or even preference. They imagine that every one who has any penetration is ill-natured, and look coldly on a discriminating judgment. It should be remembered, however, that this discernment does not always proceed from an uncharitable temper, but that those who possess a long experience and thorough knowledge of the world, scrutinize the conduct and dispositions ot people before they trust themselves to the tirst fair appearances. Addison, who was not deficient in a knowledge of mankind, observes that " a friend- ship, whiGh makes the least noise, is very often the most useful; for which reason, I should prefer a prudent triend to a zealous one." And Joanna Baillie telis us that Friendship is no plant of hasty growth. Though planted m esteem's deep-fix^d''soil. The gradual culture of kind intercourse Must brmg it co pertection." 8. Hospitality is a most Excellent Virtue ; but care must be taken that tne love of eompanj'-, for its own sake, does not become a prevailing passion; for then the habit is no longer hospitality, but dissipation. Keaiity and truthfulness in this, as in all other duties of life, are the points to be studied; for, as Washington Irving well says, ''There is an emanation from the heart in genuine hospitality, which cannot be described, but is imme- diately felt, and puts the stranger at once at his ease," With respect to the continuance of friendships, however, it may be foimd necessary, in somo cases, for a mistres.^ to relinquish, on assuming the responsibility of a house- hold, many of those commenced in the earlier part of her life. This will be tlio moro requisite, if the number still retained be quite equal to her means and opportunities.4 HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT. 9. In Conversation, Trifling Occurrences, such as small disappoint- ments, petty annoyances, and other every-day incidents, should never be mentioned to your friends. The extreme injudiciousness of repeating these will be at once apparent, when we reflect on the unsatisfactory discussions which they too frequently occasion, and on the load of advice which they are the cause of being tendered, and which is, too often, of a kind neither to be useful nor agreeable. Greater events, whether of joy or sorrow, should be communicated to friends; and, on such occasions, their sympathy gratifies and comforts. If the mistress be a wife, never let an account of her husband's failings pass her lips; and in cultivating the power of conversa- tion, she should keep the versified advice of Cowper continually in her memory, that it Should flow like water after summer showers, Not as if raised by mere mechanic powers." In reference to its style. Dr. Johnson, who was himself greatly disting-uished for his colloquial abilities, says that *^no style is more extensively accept- able than the narrative, because this does not carry an air of superiority over the rest of the company; and, therefore, is most likely to please them. For this purpose we should store our memory with short anecdotes and enter- taining pieces of history. Almost every one listens with eagerness to extem- porary history. Vanity often co-operates with curiosity; for he that is a hearer in one place wishes to qualify himself to be a principal speaker in some inferior company; and therefore more attention is given to narrations than anything else in conversation. It is true, indeed, that sallies of wit and quick replies are very pleasing in conversation ; but they frequently tend to raise envy in some of the company: but the narrative way neither raises this, nor any other evil passion, bvit keeps all the company nearly upon au equality, and, if judiciously managed, will at once entertain and improve them all." 10. Good Temper should be cultivated by every mistress, as upon it the welfare of the household may be said to turn; indeed, its influence can hardly be over-estimated, as it has the effect of moulding the characters of those around her, and of acting most beneficially on the happiness of the domestic circle. Every head of a household should strive to be cheerful, and should never fail to show a deep interest in all that appertains to the well- being of those who claim the protection of her roof. Gentleness, not partial and temporary, but universal and regular, should pervade her conduct; for where such a spirit is habituallj'- manifested, it not only delights her children, but makes her domestics attentive and respectful; her visitors are also pleased by it, and their happiness is increased, 11. On the Important Subject of Dress and Fashion we cannot do better than quote an opinion from the eighth volume of the Englishwoman'sTHE MISTEES3. 5 Domestic Magazine." The writer there says, '^Let people write, talk, lecture, satirize, as they may, it cannot be denied that, whatever is the prevailing- mode in attire, let it intrinsically be ever so absurd, it will never lool; as ridiculous as another, or as any other, which, however convenient, comfort- able, or even becoming, is totally opposite in style to that generally worn." 12. In Purchasing Articles of Wearing Apparel, whether it be a silk dress, a bonnet, shawl, or riband, it is well for the buyer to consider three things: I. That it be not too expensive for her purse. II. That its colour harmonize with her complexion, and its size and pattern with her figure. III. That its tint allow of its being worn with the other garments she possesses. The quaint Fuller observes, that the good wife is none of our dainty dames, who love to appear in a variety of suits every day new, as if a gown, like a stratagem in war, were to be used but once. But our good wife sets up a sail according to the keel of her husband's estate; and, if of high parentage, she doth not so remember what she was by birth, that she forgets what she is by match. To Brunettes, or those ladies having dark comi)lexiong, silks of a grave hue are adapted. For Blondes, or those having fair complexionsj lighter colours are preferable, as the richer, deeper hues are too overpowering for the latter. The colours which go best together are green with violet; gold-colour with dark crimson or lilac ; pale blue with scarlet; pink with black or white; and gray with scarlet or pink. A cold colour generally requires a warm tint to give life to it. Gray and pale blue, for instance, do not combine well, both being cold colours. 13. The Dress of the Mistress should always be adapted to her circum- stances, and be varied with different occasions. Thus, at breakfast she should be attired in a very neat and simple manner, wearing no ornaments. If this dress should decidedly pertain only to the breakfast-hour, and be specially suited for such domestic occupations as usually follow that meal, then it would be well to exchange it before the time for receiving visitors, if the mistress be in the habit of doing so. It is still to be remembered, however, that, in changing the dress, jewellery and ornaments are not to be worn until the full dress for dinner is assumed. Further information and hints on the subject of the toilet will appear under the department of the " Lady's-Maid." The advice ofPolonius to his son Laertes, in Shakspeare's tragedy of" Hamlet,'* is most excellent j and although given to one of the male sex, will equally apply to a *4ayre ladye Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy, But not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy; For the apparel oft proclaims the man." 14. Charity and Benevolence are duties which a mistress owes to herself as well as to her fellow-creatures; and there is scarcely any income so small, but something may be spared from it, even if it be but the widow's mite." It is to be always remembered, however, that it is the spirit of charityHOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT. ■which imparts to the gift a value far beyond its actual amouut; and is by far its better part. True Charity, a plant divinely nursed, I'ed by the love from which it rose at first, Thrives against hope, and, in the rudest scene. Storms but enliven its unfading green ; Exub'rant is the shadow it supplies. Its fruit on earth, its growth above the skies. Visiting the houses of the poor is the only practical way really to understand the actnaJ state of each family j and although there may be difficulties in following out this plan in the metropolis and other large cities, yet in country towns and rural districts these objections do not obtain. Great advantages may result from visits paid to the poor; for there being, unfortunately, much ignorance, generally, amongst them with respect to all household knowledge, there will be opportunities for advising and instructing them, in a pleasant and unobtrusive manner, in cleanliness, industry, cookery, and good management. 15. In Marketing, that the Best Articles are the Cheapest, may be laid down as a rule ; and it is desirable, unless an experienced and confi' dential housekeeper be kept, that the mistress should herself purchase all provisions and stores needed for the house. If the mistress be a j^oung wife, and not accustomed to order "things for the house," a little practice and experience will soon teach her who are the best tradespeople to deal with, and. w^hat are the best provisions to buy. Under each particular head of Fish, Meat, Poultry, Game, &c., will be described the proper means of ascertaining the quality of these comestibles. 16. A Housekeeping Account-book should invariably be kept, and kept punctually and precisely. The plan for keeping household accounts, which we should recommend, would be to make an entry, that is, write down into a daily diary every amount paid on that particular day, be it ever so small; then, at the end of the month, let these various payments be ranged under their specific heads of Butcher, Baker, &c. ; and thus will be seen the pro- portions paid to each tradesman, and any one month's expenses may be con- trasted with another. The housekeeping accounts should be balanced not less than once a month; so that you may see that the money you have in hand tallies with your account of it in your diary. Judge Haliburton never wrote truer words than when he said, " No man is rich whose expenditure exceeds his means, and no one is poor whose incomings exceed his outgoings." When, in a large establishment, a housekeeper is kept, it will be advisable for the - mistress to examine her accounts regularly. Then any increase ol expenditure which may be apparent, can easily be explained, and the housekeeper will have the satisfaction of knowing whether her efforts to manage her department well and economically, have been successful. 17. Engaging Domestics is one of those duties in which the judgment of the njistress must be keenly exercised. There arc some respectable registry-offices, where good servients may sometimes be hired; but the plan rather to be recommended is, for the mistress to make inquiry amongst herTHE MISTRESS. 7 circle of friends and acquaintances, and her tradespeople. The latter gene- rally know those in their neighbourhood, who are wanting situations, and will communicate with them, when a personal interview with some of them will enable the mistress to form some idea of the characters of the applicants, and to suit herself accordingly. We would here point out an error—and a grave one it is—into which some mistresses fall. They do not, when engaging a servant, expressly tell her all the duties which she will be expected to perform. This is an act of omission severely to be reprehended. Every portion of work which the maid will have to do, should be plainly stated by the mistress, and understood by the servant. If this plan is not carefully adhered to, domestic contention is almost certain to ensue, and this may not be easily settled; so that a change of servants, which is so much to be deprecated, is continually occurring. 18. In obtaining a Servant's Character, it is not well to be guided by a written one from some unknown quarter ; but it is better to have an interview, if at all possible, with the former mistress. By this means you will be assisted in your decision of the suitableness of the servant for your place, from the appearance of the lady and the state of her house. Negligence and want of cleanliness in her and her household generally, will naturally lead you to the conclusion, that her servant has suffered from the influence of the bad example. The proper course to pursue in order to obtain a personal interview with the lady is this :—The servant in search of the situation must be desired to see her former mis- tress, and ask her to be kind enough to appoint a time, convenient to herself, when you may call on her; this proper observance of courtesy being necessary to prevent any unseasonable intrusion on the part of a stranger. Your first questions should be relative to the honesty and general morality of her former servant; and if no objection is stated in that respect, her other qualifications are then to be ascertained. Inquiries should be very minute, so that you may avoid disappointment and trouble, by knowing the weak points of your domestic. 19. The Treatment of Servants is of the highest possible moment, as well to the mistress as to the domestics themselves. On the head of the house the latter will naturally fix their attention; and if they perceive that the mistress's conduct is regulated by high and correct principles, they will not fail to respect her. If, also, a benevolent desire is shown to promote their comfort, at the same time that a steady performance of their duty is exacted, then their respect will not be unmingled with affection, and they will be still more solicitous to continue to deserve her favour. ^o. In giving a Character, it is scarcely necessary to say that the mistress should be guided by a sense of strict justice. It is not fair for one lady to recommend to another, a servant she would not keep herself. The benefit, too, to the servant herself is of small advantage ; for the failings which she possesses will increase if suff'ered to be indulged with impunity. It is hardly necessary to remark, on the other hand, that no angry feelings on the part of a mistress towards her late servant, should ever be allowed, in the slightest degree, to influence her, so far as to induce her to disparage her maid's character. 21.

All the domestics mentioned in the above table would enter into the establishment of a wealthy nobleman. The number ot servants, ot course, would become smaller in proportion to the lesser size of the establishment; and we may here enumerate a scale of servants suited to Tarious incomes, commencing with— About £1,000 a year—A cook, upper housemaid, nursemaid, under housemaid, and a man servant. About £750 a year—A cook, housemaid, nursemaid, and footboy. About £500 a year—A cook, housemaid, and nursemaid. About £300 a year—A maid-of-all-work and nursemaid. About £200 or £150 a year—A maid-of-all-work (and girl occasionally). 12. Having thus indicated some of the more general duties of the mistress, relative to the moral government of her household, we will now give a few specific instructions on matters having a more practical relation to the position which she is supposed to occupy in the eye of the world. To do this the more clearly, we will begin with her earliest duties^ and take her completely through the occupations of a day. 23. Having risen early, as we have already advised (see 3), and having given due attention to the bath, and made a careful toilet, it will be well at once to see that the cldldren have received their proper ablutions, andTHE MISTRESS. 9 are in every way clean and comfortable. The first meal of the day, breakfast, will then be served, at which all the family should be punctually present, unless illness, or other circumstances, prevent. 24. After Breakfast is over, it will be well for the mistress to make a round of the kitchen and other offices, to see that all are in order, and that the morning's work has been properly performed by the various domestics. The orders for the day should then be given, and any questions which the domestics desire to ask, respecting their several departments, should be answered, and any special articles they may require, handed to them from the store-closet. In those establishments where there is a housekeeper, it will not be so necessary for the mistress, personally, to perform the above-named duties. 25. After this General Superintendence of her servants, the mistress, if a mother of a young family, may devote herself to the instruction of some of its younger members, or to the examination of the state of their wardrobe, leaving the later portion of the morning for reading, or for some amusing recreation. " Eecreation," says Bishop Hall, 'Ms intended to the mind as whetting is to the scythe, to sharpen the edge of it, which would otherwise grow dull and blunt. He, therefore, that spends his whole time in recreation is ever whetting, never mowing; his grass may grow and his steed starve ; as, contrarily, he that always toils and never recreates, is ever mowing, never whetting, labouring much to little purpose. As good no scythe as no edge. Then only doth the work go forward, wlien the scythe is so seasonably and moderately whetted that it may cut, and so cut, that it may have the help of sharpening." Unless the means of the mistress be very circumscribed, and she be obliged to devote a great deal of her time to the making of her children's clothes, and other economical pursuits, it is right that she should give some time to the pleasures of literature, the innocent delights of the garden, and to the improvement of any special abihties for music, painting, and other elegant arts, which she may, happily, possess. 16. These Duties and Pleasures being performed and enjoyed, the hour of luncheon will have arrived. This is a very necessary meal between an early breakfast and a late dinner, as a healthy person, with good exercise, should have a fresh supply of food once in four hours. It should be a light meal; but its solidity must, of course, be, in some degree, proportionate to the time it is intended to enable you to wait for your dinner, and the amount of exercise you take in the mean time. At this time, also, the servants' dinner will be served. In those estabhshments where an early dinner is served, that will, of course, take the place of the luncheon. In many houses, where a nursery dinner is provided for the children at about one o'clock, the mistress and the elder portion of the family make their luncheon at the same time from the same joint, or whatever may be provided. A mistress will arrange, according to circumstances, the serving of the meal; but the more usual plan is for the lady of the house to have the joint brought to her table, and afterwards carried to the nursery.10 HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT. 27. After Luncheon, Morning Calls and Visits may be made and received. These may be divided under three heads: those of ceremony, friendship, and congratulation or condolence. Visits of ceremony, or courtesy, which occasionally merge into those of friendship, are to be paid under various circumstances. Thus, they are uniformly required after dining at a friend's house,, or after a ball, picnic, or any other party. These visits should be short, a stay of from fifteen to twenty minutes being quite sufficient. A lady paying a visit may remove her boa or neckerchief; but neither her shawl nor bonnet. When other visitors are announced, it is well to retire as soon as possible, taking care to let it appear that their arrival is not the cause. When they are quietly seated, and the bustle of their entrance is over, rise from your chair, taking a kind leave of the hostess, and bowing politely to the guests. Should you call at an inconvenient time, not having ascertained the luncheon hour, or from any other inadvertence, retire as soon as possible, without, however, showing that you feel yourself an intruder. It is not difficult for any well-bred or even good-tempered person, to know what to say on such an occasion, and, on politely withdrawing, a promise can be made to call again, Lf the lady you have called on, appear really disappointed. 28. In Paying Visits of Friendship, it v/ill not be so necessary to be guided by etiquette as in paying visits of ceremonj''; and if a lady be pressed by her friend to remove her shawl and bonnet, it can be done if it will not interfere with her subsequent arrangements. lb is, however, requisite to call at suitable times, and to avoid staying too long, if your friend is engaged. The courtesies of society should ever be maintained, even in the domestic circle, and amongst the nearest friends. During these visits, the manners should be easy and cheerful, and the subjects of conversation such as may be readily terminated. Serious discussions or arguments are to be altogether avoided, and there is much danger and impropriety in expressing opinions of those persons and characters with whom, perhaps, there is but a slight acquaintance. {See 6, 7, and 9.) It is not advisable, at any time, to take favourite dogs into another lady's drawing- room, for many persons have an absolute dislike to such animals; and besides this, there is always a chance of a breakage of some article occurring, through their leaping and bounding here and there, sometimes very much to the fear and annoyance of the hostess. Her children, also, unless they are particularly well-trained and orderly, and she is on exceedingly friendly terms with the hostess, should not accompany a lady in making morning calls. Where a lady, however, pays her visits in a carriage, the children can be taken in the vehicle, and. remain in it until the visit is over. 29. For Morning Calls, it is well to be neatly attired; for a costume very different to that you generally wear, or anything approaching an evening dress, will be very much out of place. As a general rule, it may be said, both in reference to this and all other occasions, it is better to be under-dressed than over-dressed. A strict account should be kept of ceremonial visits, and notice how soon your visits have been returned. An opinion may thus be formed as to whether your frequent visits are, or are not, desirable. There are, naturally, instances when the circumstances of old age or ill health will preclude any return of a call; but when this is the case, it must not interrupt the discharge of the duty. 30. In Paying Visits of Condolence, it is to be remembered that theyTHE MISTRESS* 11 should be paid within a week after the event which occasions them. If the acquaintance, however, is but slight, then immediately after the family has appeared at public worship. A lady should send in her card, and if her friends be able to receive her, the visitor's manner and conversation should be subdued and in harmony with the character of her visit. Courtesy would dictate that a mourning card should be used, and that visitors, in paying condoling visits, should be dressed in black, either silk or plain-coloured apparel. Sympathy with the affliction of the family, is thus expressed, and these attentions are, in such cases, pleasing and soothing. In all these visits, if your acquaintance or friend be not at home, a card should be left. If in a carriage, the servant will answer your inquiry and receive your card; if paying your visits on loot, give your card to the servant in the hall, but leave to go in and rest should on no account be asked. The form ot words, " Not at home," may be understood in different senses; but the only courteous way is to receive them as being perfectly true. You may imagine that the lady of the house is really at nome, and that she would make an exception m your favour, or you may think that your acquaintance is not desired; but, in either case, not the slightest "wrord is to escape you, which would suggest, on your part, such an impression, 31. In Receiving Morning Calls, the foregoing description of the etiquette to be observed in paying them, will be of considerable service. It is to be added, however, that the occupations of drawing, music, or reading should be suspended on the entrance of morning visitors. If a lady, however, be engaged with light needlework, and none other is appropriate in the drawing-room, it may not be, under some circumstances, inconsistent with good breeding to quietly continue it during conversation, particularly if the visit be protracted, or the visitors be gentlemen. Formerly the custom was to accompany all visitors quitting the house to the door, and there take leave of them; but modern society, which has thrown off a great deal of this kind of ceremony, now merely requires that the lady of the house should rise from her seat, shake hands, or courtesy, in accordance with the intimacy she has with her guests, and ring the bell to summon the servant to attend them and open the door. In making a first call, either upon a newly-married couple, or persons newly arrived in the neigh- bourhood, a lady should leave her husband's card together with her own, at the samo time, stating that the profession or business in which he is engaged has prevented him from having the pleasure of paying the visit, with her. It is a custom with many ladies, when on the eve of an absence from their neighbourhood, to leave or send their own and husband's cards, with the letters P. P. C. in the right-hand corner. These letters are the initials of the French words, " Four prendre conge" meaning, " To take leave." 32. The Morning Calls being paid or received, and their etiquette properly attended to, the next great event of the day in most establishments is The Dinnerand we only propose here to make a few general remarks on this important topic, as, in future pages, the whole ^''Art of Dining" will be thoroughly considered, with reference to its economy, comfort, and enjoyment. 33. In giving or accepting an Invitation for Dinner, the following is the form of words generally made use of. They, however, can be varied in proportion to the intimacy or position of the hosts and guests:—12 HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT. Mr. and Mrs. A present their compliments to Mr. and Mrs. B , and request the honour, [or hope to have the pleasure] ot their company to dinner on Wednesday, the 6th of December next. A Street, Novemler \Wi, 1859. R. S. V. P. The letters in the corner imply Repond.ez, sHl vous plait;*' meaning, an answer will oblige." The reply, accepting the invitation, is couched in the following terms :— Mr. and Mrs. B present their compliments to Mr. and Mrs. A , and will do themselves the honour of, [or will have much IDleasure in] accepting their kind invitation to dinner on the 6th of Decem- ber next. B Square, JS'Ovemher ISih, 1859. Cards, or invitations for a dinner-party, should be issued a fortnight or three weeks (sometimes even a month) beforehand, and care should be taken by the hostess, in the selection of the invited guests, that they should be suited to each other. Much also of the pleasure of a dinner-party will depend on the arrangement of the guests at table, so as to form a due admixture of talkers and listeners, the grave and the gay. If an invita- tion to dinner is accepted, the guests should be punctual, and the mistress ready in her drawing-room to receive them. At some periods it has been considered fashionable to come late to dinner, but lately nous avons change tout cela, 34. The Half-hour before Dinner has always been considered as the great ordeal through which the mistress, in giving a dinner-party, will either pass with flying colours, or, lose many of her laurels. The anxiety to receive her guests,—her hope that all will be present in due time,—her trust in the skill of her cook, and the attention of the other domestics, all tend to make these few minutes a trying time. The mistress, however, must display no kind of agitation, but show her tact in suggesting light and cheerful subjects of conversation, which will be much aided by the introduction of any i)ar- ticular new book, curiosity of art, or article of vcrtu, which may pleasantly engage the attention of the company. " Waiting for Dinner," however, is a trying time, and there are few who have not felt— How sad it is to sit and pine, The long half-hour before we dine ! Upon our watches oft to look. Then wonder at the clock and cook, •3;- -ii- % -K- -it And strive to laugh in spite of Fate I But laughter forced soon quits the room, And leaves it in its former gloom. But lo! the dinner now appears. The object of our hopes and fears, The end of all our pain !** In giving an entertainment of this kind, the mistress should remember that it is her duty to make her guests feel happy, comfortable, and quite at their ease; and the guestsTHE MISTRESS. 13 should also consider that they have come to the house of their hostess to be happy. Thus an opportunity is given to all for innocent enjoyment and intellectual improvement, when also acquaintances may be formed that may prove invaluable through life, and informa- tion gained that wiU enlarge the mind. Many celebrated men and women have been great talkers; and, amongst others, the genial Sir Walter Scott,'who spoke freely to every one, and a favourite remark of whom it was, that he never did so without learning something he didn't know before. 35. Dinner being announced, the host offers his arm to, and places on his right hand at the dinner-table, the lady to whom he desires to pay most respect, either on accomit of her age, position, or from her being the greatest stranger in the party. If this lady be married and her husband present, the latter takes the hostess to her place at table, and seats himself at her right hand. The rest of the company follow in couples, as specified by the master and mistress of the house, arranging the party according to their rank and other circumstances which may be known to the host and hostess. It will be found of great assistance to the placing of a party at the dinner-table, to have the names of the guests neatly (and correctly) written on small cards, and placed at that part of the table where it is desired they should sit. With respect to the number of guests, it has often been said, that a private dinner-party should consist of not less thau the number of the Graces, or more than that of the Muses. A party of ten or twelve is, perhaps, in a general way, sufficient to enjoy themselves and be enjoyed. White kid gloves are worn by ladies at dinner-parties, but should be taken off before the business of dining commences, 36. The Guests being Seated at the Dinner-table, the lady begins to help the soup, which is handed round, commencing with the gentleman on her right and on her left, and continuing in the same order till all are served. It is generally established as a rule, not to ask for soup or fish twice, as, in so doing, part of the company may be kept waiting too long for the second course, when, perhaps, a little revenge is taken by looking at the awkward consumer of a second portion. This rule, however, may, under various circumstances, not be considered as binding. It is not usual, where taking wine is en regie, for a gentleman to ask a lady to take wine until the fish or soup is finished, and then the gentleman honoured by sitting on the right of the hostess, may politely inquire if she wiU do him the honour of taking wine with him. This will act as a signal to the rest of the company, the gentleman of the house most probably requesting the same pleasure of the ladies at his right and left. At many tables, however, the custom or fashion of drinking wine in this manner, is abolished, and the servant fills the glasses of the guests with the various wines suited to the course which is in progress. 37. When Dinner is finished, the Dessert is placed on the table, accompanied with finger-glasses. It is the custom of some gentlemen to wet a corner of the napkin; but the hostess, whose behaviour will set the tone to all the ladies present, will merely wet the tips of her fingers, which will serve all the purposes required. The French and other continentals have a habit of garghng the mouth; but it is a custom which no English gentle- woman should, in the slightest degree, imitate. 38. When Fruit has been taken, and a glass or two of wine passed round, the time will have arrived when the hostess will rise, and thus give14 HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT. the signal for the ladies to leave the gentlemen, and retire to the drawing- room. The gentlemen of the party will rise at the same time, and he who is nearest the door, will open it for the ladies, all remaining courteously standing until the last lady has withdrawn. Dr. Johnson has a curious jjaragraph on the effects of a dinner on men. " Before dinner," he says, "men meet with great inequality of understanding; and those who are con- scious of their inferiority have the modesty not to talk. When they have drunk wine, every man fieels himselt happy, and loses that modesty, and grows impudent and vociferous ; but he is not improved, he is only not sensible of his defects." This is rather severe, but there may be truth in it. In former times, when the bottle circulated freely amongst the guests, it was necessary for the ladies to retire earlier than they do at present, for the gentlemen ol tne company soon became unfit to conduct themselves with that decorum which is essential in the presence ot ladies. Thanks, however, to the improvements in modern society, and the high example shown to the nation by its most illustrious personages, temperance is, in these happy days, a striking feature m the character of a gentleman. Delicacy of con- duct towards the female sex has increased with tJie esteem in wlucn they are now universally held, and thus, the very early withdrawing ot the ladies from the dining-room is to be deprecated. A lull in the conversation will seasonaDly indicate the moment for liie ladies* departure, 39. After-dinner Invitations may be given ; by which we wish to be understood, invitations for the evening. The time of the arrival of these visitors will vary according to their engagements, or sometimes will be varied in obedience to the caprices of fashion. Guests invited for the evening are, bowever, generally considered at liberty to arrive whenever it will best sidt themselves,—usually between nine and twelve, unless earlier hours are specihcally named. By this arrangement, many fashionable people and otners, who have numerous engagements to fuitil, oiten contrive to make tiieii appearance at two or three parties in the course of one evening. 40. The Etiquette op the Dinner-party Table being disposed of, let us now enter shgiitiy into that ot an evening party or ball. The invitations issued and accepted for either of these, will be written in the same style as those already described for a dinner-party. They should be sent out at least three weeks before the day fixed for the event, and should be replied to witnin a week ot ttieir receipt. By attending to tnese courtesies, the guests will have time to consider ttreir engagements and prepare their dresses, and the Hostess will, also, ijnow wuat will be tne number of her party. If the entertainment is to be simply an evening party, this must be specified on the card or note of invitation. Short or verbal invitations, except where persons are exceedingly intimate, or are very near relations, are very far from proper, although, of course, in this respect and in many other respects, very much always depends on the manner in which the invitation is given. True politeness, however, should be studied even amongst the nearest friends and relations; for the mechanical forms of good breeding are of great consequence, and too much famiharity may have, for its eifect, the destruction of friendship. 41. As THE Ladies and Gentlemen arrive, each should bo shown to a room exclusiv^ely provided for their reception; and in that set apart for thoTHE MISTRESS. 15 ladies, attendants should be in waiting to assist in uncloaking, and helping to arrange the hair and toilet ot those who require it. It will be found convenient, in those cases where the number ot guests is large, to provide numbered tickets, so that they can be attached to the cloaks and shawls ot each lady, a duplicate of which should be handed to the guest. Coffee is sometimes provided in this, or an ante-room, for those wbo would like to partake of it. 42. As THE Visitors are announced by the Servant, it is not necessary for the lady of the House to advance each time towards the door, but merely to rise from her seat to receive their courtesies and congratulations. If, indeed, the bostess wishes to show particular favour to some peculiarly honoured guests, she may mtroduce them to others, whose acquaintance she may imagine will be especially suitable and agreeable. It is very often the practice of the master of the house to introduce one gentleman to another; but occasionally the lady performs this office ; when it will, of course, be polite for the persons thus introduced to take their seats togetber lor the time being. The custom of non-introduction is very much in vogue in many houses, and guests are thus left to discover for themselves the position and qualities of the people around them. The servant, indeed, calls out the names ot all the visitors as they arrive, but, m many instances, mispronounces them; so that it will not be well to follow this mformation, as if it were an unerring guide. In our opmion, it is a cheerless and depressmg custoni, although, in thus speaking, we do not allude to the large assembheb of the aristocj-auy, but to the smaller parties of the middle classes. 43. A Separate Koom or Convenient Buffet should be appropriated for refreshments, and to which the dancers may retire; and cakes and biscuits, with wine negus, lemonade, and ices, handed round. A supper is also mostly provided at the private parties of the middle classes; and this requires, on the part of the hostess, a great deal of attention and supervision. It usually takes place between the first and second, parts of the programme of the dances, of which there should be several prettily written or printed copies distributed about the ball-room. In private parties, a lady is not to refuse the invitation of a gentleman to dance, unless she be previously engaged. The hostess must be supposed to have asked to her house only those persons whom she knows to be perfectly respectable and of unblemished character, as well as pretty equal in position; and thus, to decline the olFer of any gentleman present, would be a tacit reflection on the master and mistress of the house. It may be mentioned here, more especially for the young who w^ill read thia book, that introductions at baUs or evening parties, cease with the occasion that calls them forth, no introduction, at these times, giving a gentleman a right to address, after- wards, a lady. She is, consequently, free, nest morning, to pass her partner at a ball of the previous evening without the slightest recognition. 44. The Ball is generally Opened, that is, the first place in the first quadrille is occupied, by the lady of the house. When anything prevents this, the host will usually lead off the dance v/ith the lady who is either the highest in rank, or the greatest stranger. It xnll bo well for the hostess, even if she be very partial to the amusement, and a graceiul nccr, not to participate inHOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT. it £0 any great extent, lest her lady guests should have occasion to complain of her monopoly of the gentlemen, and other causes of neglect. A few dances will suffice to show her interest in the entertainment, without unduly trenching on the attention due to her guests. In all its parts a ball should be perfect,— The music, and the banquet, and the wine ; The garlands, the rose-odours, and the flowers.** The hostess or host, during the progress of a ball, will courteously accost and chat •with their friends, and take care that the ladies are furnished with seats, and that those who wish to dance are provided with partners. A gentle hint from the hostess, conveyed in a quiet ladyhke manner, that certain ladies have remained unengaged during several dances, is sure not to be neglected by any gentleman. Thus will be studied the com- fort and enjoyment of the guests, and no lady, in leaving the house, will be able to feel the chagrin and disappointment of not having been invited to "stand up" in a dance during the whole of the evening, 45. When any of the Carriages of the Guests are announced, or the time for their departure arrived, they should make a slight intimation to the hostess, without, however, exciting any observation, that they are about to depart. If this cannot be done, however, without creating too much bustle, it will be better for the visitors to retire quietly without taking their leave. During the course of the week, the hostess will expect to receive from every guest a call, where it is possible, or cards expressing the gratification expe- rienced from her entertainment. This attention is due to every lady for the pains and trouble she has been at, and tends to promote social, kindly feelings. 46. Having thus discoursed of parties of pleasure, it will be an interesting change to return to the more domestic business of the house, although all the details we have been giving of dinner-parties, balls, and the like, appertain to the department of the mistress. Without a knowledge of the etiquette to be observed on these occasions, a mistress would be unable to enjoy and appre- ciate those friendly pleasant meetings which give, as it were, a fillip to life, and make the quiet happy home of an English gentlewoman appear the more delightful and enjoyable. In their proper places, all that is necessary to be known respecting the dishes and appearance of the breakfast, dinner, tea, and supper tables, will be set forth in this work. 47. A Family Dinner at Home, compared -with either giving or going to a dinner-party, is, of course, of much more frequent occurrence, and many will say, of much greater importance. Both, however, have to be con- sidered with a view to their nicety and enjoyment; and the latter more particularly with reference to economy. These points will be especially noted in the following pages on Household Cookery." Here we will only say, that for both mistress and servants, as well in large as small households, it will be found, by far, the better plan, to cook and serve the dinner, and to lay the tablecloth and the sideboard, with the same cleanliness, neatness, and scrupulous exactness, whether it be for the mistress herself alone, a small family, or for *^company." If this rule be strictlyTHE MISTRESS. 17 adhered to, all will find themselves increase in managing skill; whilst a knowledge of their daily duties will become familiar, and enable them to meet difficult occasions with ease, and overcome any amount of obstacles. 48. Op the Manner of Passing Evenings at Home, there is none pleasanter than in such recreative enjoyments as those which relax the mind from its severer duties, whilst they stimulate it with a gentle delight. Where there are young people forming a part of the evening circle, interesting and agreeable pastime should especially be promoted. It is of incalculable benefit to them that their homes should possess all the attractions ot healthtul amuse- ment, comfort, and happiness ; for if they do not find pleasure there, they will seek it elsewhere. It ought, therefore, to enter into the domestic policy of every parent, to make her children feel that home is the happiest place in the world; that to imbue them with this delicious home-feeling is one of the choicest gifts a parent can bestow. Light or fancy needlework often forms a portion of the evening's recreation for tha ladies of the household, and this may be varied by an occasional game at chess or back- gammon. It has often been remarked, too, that nothing is more delightful to the feminine members of a family, than the reading aloud of some good standard work or amusing publication, A knowledge of polite literature may be thus obtained by the whole family, especially if the reader is able and willing to explain the more difficult passages of the book, and expatiate on the wisdom and beauties it may contain. This plan, in a great measure, realizes the advice of Lord Bacon, who says, ** Eead not to contradict and refute, nor to believe and take for granted, nor to find talk and discourse, but to weigh and consider." 49. In Retiring for the Night, it is well to remember that early rising is almost impossible, if late going to bed be the order, or rather disorder, of the house. The younger members of a family should go early and at regular hours to their beds, and the domestics as soon as possible after a reasonably appointed hour. Either the master or the mistress of a house should, after all have gone to their separate rooms, see that all is right with respect to the lights and fires below; and no servants should, on any account, be allowed to remain up after the heads of the house have retired. 50. Having thus gone from Early Rising to Early Retiring, there remain only now to be considered a few special positions respecting which the mistress of the house will be glad to receive some specific information. 51. When a Mistress Takes a House in a new locality, it will be etiquette for her to wait until the older inhabitants of the neighbourhood call upon her ; thus evincing a desire, on their part, to become acquainted with the new comer. It may be, that the mistress will desire an intimate acquaintance with but few of her neighbours; but it is to be specially borne in mind that all visits, whether of ceremony, friendship, or condolence, should be punctiliously returned. c18 HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT. 52. You MAT PERHAPS HAVE BEEN FAVOURED witli letters of introduction from some of your friends, to persons living in the neighbourhood to which you have just come. In this case inclose the letter of introduction in an envelope with your card. Then, if the person, to whom it is addressed, calls in the course of a few days, the visit should be returned by you within the week, if possible. Any breach of etiquette, in this respect, will not readily be excused. In the event of your being invited to dinner under the above circumstances, nothing but necessity should prevent you from accepting the invitation. If, however, there is some distinct reason why you cannot accept, let it be stated frankly and plainly, for politeness and truthfulness should be ever allied. An opportunity should, also, be taken to call in the course of a day or two, in order to politely express your regret and disappointment at not having been able to avail yourself of their kindness. 53. In Giving a Letter ot? Introduction, it should always be handed to your friend, unsealed. Courtesy dictates this, as the person whom you are introducing would, perhaps, wish to know in what manner he or she was spoken of. Should you receive a letter from a friend, introducing to you any person known to and esteemed by the writer, the letter should be immediately acknowledged, and your willingness expressed to do all in your poYfer to carry out his or her wishes. 54. Such are the onerous Duties which enter into the position of the mistress of a house, and such are, happily, with a slight but continued atten- tion, of by no means difficult performance. She ought always to remember that she is the first and the last, the Alpha and the Omega in the government of her establishment; and that it is by her conduct that its whole internal policy is regulated. She . is, therefore, a person of far more importance in a community than she usually thinks she is. On her pattern her daughters model themselves ; by her counsels they are directed; through her virtues all are honoured ;—^' her children rise up and call her blessed; her husband, also, and he praiseth her." Therefore, let each mistress always remember her responsible position, never approving a mean action, nor speaking an unrefined word. Let her conduct be such that her inferiors may respect her, and such as an honourable and right-minded man may look for in his wife and the mother of his children. Let her think of the many compliments and the sincere homage that have been paid to her sex by the greatest philosophers and writers, both in ancient and modern times. Let her not forget that she has to show herself worthy of Campbell's compliment when he said,— The world was sad ! the garden was a wild ! And man the hermit sigh'd, till woman smiled." Let her prove herself, then, the happy companion of man, and able to take unto herself the praises of the pious prelate, Jeremy Taylor, who says,— "A good wife is Heaven's last best gift to man,—his angel and minister of graces innumerable,—his gem of many •\drtues,—^his casket of jewels—herTHE MISTRESS. 19 voice is sweet music—her smiles his brightest day;—her kiss, the guardian of his innocence;—her arms, the pale of his safety, the balm of his health, the balsam of his life ;—her industry, his surest wealth;—^her economy, his safest steward;—her lips, his faithful counsellors ;—her bosom, the softest pillow of his cares; and her prayers, the ablest advocates of Heaven's blessings on his head." Cherishing, then, in her breast the respected utterances of the good and the great, let the mistress of every house rise to the responsibility of its management; so that, in doing her duty to all around her, she may receive the genuine reward of respect, love, and affection ! ^ote.—Many mistresses have experienced the hoirors of house-hunting, and it is well known that " three removes are as good (or bad, rather) as a fire." Nevertheless, it being quite evident that we must, in these days at least, live in houses, and are sometimes obliged to change our residences, it is well to consider some of the conditions which will add to, or diminish, the convenience and comfort of our homes. Although the choice of a house must be dependent on so many different circumstances with different people, that to give any specific directions on this head would be impossible and useless ; yet it will be advantageous, perhaps, to many, if we point out some of those general features as to locality, soil, aspect, &c., to which the attention of all house-takers should be carefully directed. Regarding the locality, we may say, speaking now more particularly of a town house, that it is very important to the health and comfort of a family, that the neighbourhood of all factories of any kind, producing un- wholesome effluvia or smells, should be strictly avoided. Neither is it well to take a house in the immediate vicinity of where a noisy trade is carried on, as it is unpleasant to the feelings, and tends to increase any existing irritation of the system. Referring to soils; it is held as a rule, that a gravel soil is superior to any other, as the rain drains through it very quickly, and it is consequently drier and less damp than clay, upon which water rests a far longer time. A clay country, too, is not so pleasant for walking exercise as one in which gravel predominates. The aspect of the house should be well considered, and it should be borne in mind that the more sunlight that comes into the house, the healthier is the habitation. The close, fetid smell which assails one on entering a narrow court, or street, in towns, is to be assigned to the want of light, and, consequently, air. A house with a south or south-west aspect, is lighter, warmer, drier, and consequently more healthy, than one facing the north or north-east. Great advances have been made, during the last few years, in the prin- ciples of sanitary knowledge, and one most essential point to be observed in reference to a house, is its drainage," as it has been proved in an end- less number of cases, that bad or defective drainage is as certain to destroy health as the taking of poisons. This arises from its injuriously afiecting the atmosphere ; thus rendering the air we breathe unwholesome and deleterious. Let it be borne in mind, then, that unless a house is effectually drained, the health of its inhabitants is sure to suffer ; and they will be susceptible of ague, rheumatism, diarrhoea, fevers, and cholera. We now come to an all-important point,—that of the water supply. The value of this necessary article has also been lately more and more recognized in connection with the question of health and life ; and most houses are well supplied with every convenience connected with water. Let it, however, be well understood, that no house, however suitable in other respects, can be20 HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT. desirable^ if this grand means of health and comfort is, in the slightest degree, scarce or impure. No caution can be too great to see that it is pure and good, as well as plentiful; for, knowing, as we do, that not a single part of our daily- food is prepared without it, the importance of its influence on the health of the inmates of a house cannot be over-rated. Ventilation is another feature which must not be overlooked. In a general way, enough of air is admitted by the cracks round the doors and windows ; but if this be not the case, the chimney will smoke ; and other plans, such as the placing of a plate of finely-perforated zinc in the upper part of the window, must be used. Cold air should never be admitted under the doors, or at the bottom of a room, unless it be close to the fire or stove ; for it will flow along the floor towards the fireplace, and thus leave the foul air in the upper part of the room, unpurified, cooling, at the same time, unpleasantly and injuriously, the feet and legs of the inmates. The rent of a house, it has been said, should not exceed one-eighth of the whole income of its occupier ; and, as a general rule, we are disposed to assent to this estimate, although there may be many circumstances which would not admit of its being considered infallible.21 CHAPTER II. THE HOUSEKEEPEB. 55. As SECOND IN Command in the House, except in large establishments, where there is a house steward, the housekeeper must consider herself as the immediate representative of her mistress, and bring, to the management of the household, all those qualities of honesty, industry, and vigilance, in the same degree as if she were at the head of her own family. Constantly on the watch to detect any wrong-doing on the part of any of the domestics, she will overlook all that goes on in the house, and will see that every department is thoroughly attended to, and that the servants are comfortable, at the samo time that their various duties are properly performed. Cleanliness, punctuality, order, and method, are essentials in the character of a good housekeeper. Without the first, no household can be said to be well managed. The second is equally all-important; for those who are under the housekeeper will take their *'cue" from her ; and in the same proportion as punctuality governs her movements, so will it theirs. Order, again, is indispensable; for by it we wish to be understood that "there should be a place for everything, and everything in its place." Method, too, is most necessary ; for when the work is properly contrived, and each part arranged in regular succession, it will be done more quickly and more effectually. 56. A NECESSARY QUALIFICATION FOR A HOUSEKEEPER is, that-she should thoroughly understand accounts. She will have to write in her books an accurate registry of all sums paid for any and every purpose, all the current expenses of the house, tradesmen's bills, and other extraneous matter. As we have mentioned under the head of the Mistress {see 16), a housekeeper's accounts should be periodically balanced, and examined by the head of the house. Nothing tends more to the satisfaction of both employer and employed, than this arrangement. Short reckonings make long friends," stands good in this case, as in others. It will be found an excellent plan to take an account of every article which comes into the house connected with housekeeping, and is not paid for at the time. The book containing these entries can then be compared with the bills sent in by the various tradesmen, so that any discrepancy can be inquired into and set right. An intelligent housekeeper will, by this means, too, be better able to judge of the average consumption of each article by the household; and if that quantity be, at any time, exceeded, the cause may be discovered and rectified, if it proceed from waste or carelessness. 57. Although in the department op the Cook, the housekeeper does not generally much interfere, yet it is necessary that she should possess a good knowledge of the culinary art, as, in many instances, it may be requisite for her to take the superintendence of the kitchen. As a rule, it may be stated, that the housekeeper, in those establishments where there is no house steward or man cook, undertakes the preparation of the confectionary, attends22 HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT. to the preserving and pickling of fruits and vegetables; and, in a general way, to the more difficult branches of the art of cookery. Much of these arrangements will depend, however, on the qualifications of the cook; for instance, if she be an able artiste, there will be but little necessity for the housekeeper to interfere, except in the already noticed articles of confectionary, &c. On the contrary, if the cook be not so clever an adept in her art, then it will be requisite for the housekeeper to give more of her attention to the business of the kitchen, than in the former case. It- will be one of the duties of the housekeeper to attend to the marketing, in the absence of either a house steward or man cook. 58. The Daily duties of a Housekeeper are regulated, in a great measure, by the extent of the establishment she superintends. She should, hov/ever, rise early, and see that all the domestics are duly performing their work, and that everything is progressing satisfactorily for the preparation of the breakfast for the household and family. After breakfast, which, in large establishments, she will take in the housekeeper's room " with the lady's- maid, butler, and valet, and where they will be waited on by the still-room maid, she will, on various days set apart for each purpose, carefully examine the household linen, with a view to its being repaired, or to a further quantity being put in hand to be made ; she will also see that the furniture throughout the house is well rubbed and polished; and will, besides, attend to all the necessary details of marketing and ordering goods from the tradesmen. The housekeeper's room is generally made use of by the lady's-maid, butler, and valet, who take there their breakfast, tea, and supper. The lady's-maid will also use this apartment as a sitting-room, when not engaged with her lady, or with some other duties, which would caU her elsewhere. In different establishments, according to their size and the rank of the family, different rules of course prevail. For instance, in the mansions of those of very high rank, and where there is a house steward, there are two distinct tables kept, one in the steward's room for the principal members of the household, the other in the servants' hall, for the other domestics. At the steward's dinner-table, the steward and housekeeper preside; and here, also, are present the lady's-maid, butler, valet, and head gardener. Should any visitors be staying with the family, their servants, generally the valet and lady's-maid, vdll be admitted to the steward's table. 59. After Dinner, the housekeeper, having seen that all the members of the establishment have regularly returned to their various duties, and that all the departments of the household are in proper working order, will have many important matters claiming her attention. She will, possibly, have to give the finishing touch to some article of confectionary, or be occupied with some of the more elaborate processes of the still-room. There may also be the dessert to arrange, ice-creams to make; and all these employments call for no ordinary degree of care, taste, and attention. The still-room was formerly much more in vogue than at present; for in days of " auld lang syne," the still was in constant requisition for the supply of sweet-flavoured waters for the purposes of cookery, scents and aromatic substances used in the preparation of the toilet, and cordials in cases of accidents and illness. There are some estabHshments, however, in which distillation is still carried on, and in these, the still-room maid has her old duties to perform. In a general way, however, this domestic is immediately con- cerned with the housekeeper. For the latter she lights the fire, dusts her room, prepares the breakfast-table, and waits at the different meals taken in the housekeeper's room (see 58). A still-room maid may learn a very great deal of useful knowledge from her intimate connection with the housekeeper, and if she be active and intelligent, may soon fit herself for a better position in the household.23 THE HOUSEKEEPEB. 60. In the Evening, the housekeeper will often busy herself with the necessary preparations for the next day's duties. Numberless small, but still important arrangements, will have to be made, so that everything may move smoothly. At times, perhaps, attention will have to be paid to the breaking of lump-sugar, the stoning of raisins, the washing, cleansing, and drying of currants, &c. The evening, too, is the best time for setting right her account of the expenditure, and duly writing a statement of moneys received and paid, and also for making memoranda of any articles she may require for her store- room or other departments. Periodically, at some convenient time,—for instance, quarterly or half-yearly, it is a good plan for the housekeeper to make an inventory of everything she has under her care, and compare this with the Usts of a former period; she will then be able to furnish a statement, if necessary, of the articles which, on account of time, breakage, los3, or other causes, it has been necessary to replace or replenish. 61. In concluding these remarks on the duties of the housekeeper, we will briefly refer to the very great responsibility which attaches to her position. Like ^^Ctesar's wife," she should be "above suspicion," and her honesty and sobriety unquestionable; for there are many temptations to which she is exposed. In a physical point of view, a housekeeper should be healthy and strong, and be particularly clean in her person, and her hands, although they may show a degree of roughness, from the nature of some of her employments, yet should have a nice inviting appearance. In her dealings with the various tradesmen, and in her behaviour to the domestics under her, the demeanour and conduct of the housekeeper should be such as, in neither case, to diminish, by an undue familiarity, her authority or influence. Note.—It will be useful for the mistress and housekeeper to know the best seasons for various occupations connected with Household Management; and we, accordingly, subjoin a few hints which we think will prove valuable. As, in the winter months, servants have much more to do, in consequence of the necessity there is to attend to the number of fires throughout the household, not much more than the ordinary every-day work can be attempted. In the summer, and when the absence of fires gives the domestics more leisure, then any extra work that is required, can be more easily performed. The spring is the usual period set apart for house-cleaning, and removing all the dust and dirt, which will necessarily, with the best of housewives, accumulate during the winter months, from the smoke of the coal, oil, gas, &c. This season is also well adapted for washing and bleaching linen, &c., as, the weather, not being then too hot for the exertions necessary in washing counterpanes, blankets, and heavy things in general, the work is better and more easily done than in the intense heats of July, which month some recommend for these purposes. Winter curtains should be taken down, and replaced by the summer white ones; and furs and woollen cloths also carefully laid by. The former should be well shaken and brushed, and then pinned upon paper or linen, with camphor to preserve them from the moths. Furs, &c., will be preserved in the same way. Included, under the general description of house-cleaning, must be understood, turning out all the nooks and corners of drawers, cupboards, lumber-rooms, lofts, &c., with a view of getting rid of all unnecessary articles, which only create dirt and attract vermin ; sweeping of chimneys, taking up carpets, painting and whitewashing the kitchen and offices, papering rooms, when needed, and, generally speaking.24 HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT. the house putting on, v/ith the approaching summer, a bright appearance, and a new face, in unison with nature. Oranges now should be preserved, and orange wine made. The summer will be found, as we have mentioned above, in consequence of the diminution of labour for the domestics, the best period for examining and repairing household linen, and for "putting to rights" all those articles which have received a large share of weai and teai during the dark wmter days. In direct reference to this matter, we may here remark, that sheets should be turned " sides to middlebefore they are allowed to get very thin. Otherwise, patching, which is uneconomical trom the time it consumes, and is unsightly in point of appearance, will have to be resorted to. In June and July, gooseberries, currants, raspberries, strawberries, and other summer fruits, should be preserved, and jams and jellies made. In July, too, the making of walnut ketchup should be attended to, as the green walnuts will be approaching perfection for this purpose. Mixed pickles may also be now made, and it will be found a good plan to have ready a jar of pickle-juice (for the making of which all information will be given in future pages), mto which to put occasionally some young French beans, cauliflowers, &c. In the early autumn, plums of various kinds are to be bottled and preserved, and jams and jellies made. A little later, tomato sauce, a most useful article to have by you, may be prepared ; a supply of apples laid in, if you have a place to keep them, as also a few keeping pears and filberts. Jindeavour to keep also a large vegetable marrow,—it will be found delicious in the wmtei. In October and November, it will be necessary to prepare tor the coid weather, and get ready the winter clothing lor the various members of the family. The white summer curtains will now be carefully put away, the fire- places, grates, and chimneys looked to, and the house put in a thorough state of repair, so that no loose tile" may, at a future day, interfere with your comfort, and extract sometfiing considerable from your pocket. in December, the principal household duty lies in preparing for the creature comforts of those near and dear to us, so as to meet old Christmas with a happy face, a contented mind, and a full larder ; and in stoning the plums, washing the currants, catting the citron, beating the eggs, and Mixing the PuDUiNG, a housewife is not unworthily greeting the genial season of all good things.25 CHAPTER III. ARRANGEMENT AND ECONOMY OF THE KITCHEN. 62. " The Distribution of a Kitchen," says Count Rumford, the celebrated philosopher and physician, who wrote so learnedly on all subjects connected with domestic economy and architecture, " must always depend so much on local circumstances, that general rules can hardly be given respecting it; the principles, however, on which this distribution ought, in all cases, to be made, are simple and easy to be understood," and, in his estimation, these resolve themselves into symmetry of proportion in the building and convenience to the cook. The requisites of a good kitchen, however, demand something more special than is here pointed out. It must be remembered that it is the great laboratory of every household, and that much of the ''weal or woe," as far as regards bodily health, depends upon the nature of the preparations concocted within its walls. A good kitchen, therefore, should be erected with a view to the following particulars. 1. Convenience of distribution in its parts, with largeness of dimension. 2. Excel- lence of light, height of ceiling, and good ventilation. 3. Easiness of access, without passing through the house. 4. Sufficiently remote from the principal apartments of the house, that the members, visitors, or guests of the family, may not perceive the odour incident to cooking, or hear the noise of culinary opera- tions. 5. Plenty of fuel and water, which, with the scullery, pantry, and storeroom, should be so near it, as to offer the smallest possible trouble in reaching them. The kitchens of the Middle Ages, in England, are said to have been constructed after the fashion of those of the Romans. They were generally octagonal, with several fireplaces, but no chimneys; neither was there any wood admitted into the building. The accompanying cut, fig. 1, represents the turret which Fig. 1, was erected on the top of the conical roof of the kitchen at Glastonbury Abbey, and which was per- forated with holes to allow the smoke of the fire, as well as the steam from cooking, to escape. Some kitchens had funnels or vents below the eaves to let out the steam, which was sometimes considerable, as the Anglo-Saxons used their meat chiefly in a boiled state. From this circumstance, some of their large kitchens had four ranges, comprising a boihng-place for small boiled meats, and a boiling-house for the great boiler. In private houses the culinary arrangements were no doubt different; for Du Cange mentions a httle kitchen with a chamber, even in a solarium, or upper floor.MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. 26 63. The Simplicity of the Primitive Ages has frequently been an object of poetical admiration, and it delights the imagination to picture men living upon such fruits as spring spontaneously from the earth, and desiring no other beverages to slake their thirst, but such as fountains and rivers supply. Thus we are told, that the ancient inhabitants of Argos lived principally on pears ; that the Arcadians revelled in acorns, and the Athenians in figs. This, of course, vs^as m the golden age, before ploughing began, and when mankind enjoyed all kinds of plenty without having to earn their bread ''by the sweat of their brow." This delightful period, however, could not last for ever, and the earth became barren, and continued unfruitful till Ceres came and taught the art of sowing, with several other useful inventions. The first whom she taught to till the ground was Triptolemus, who communicated his instructions to his countrymen the Athenians. Thence the art was carried into Achaia, and thence into Arcadia. Barley was the first grain that was used, and the invention of bread-making is ascribed to Pan. The use of fire, as an instrument of cookery, must have been coeval with this inven- tion of bread, which, being the most necessary of all kinds of food, was frequently used in a sense so comprehensive as to include both meat and drink. It was, by the Greeks, baked under the ashes, 64. In the Primary Ages it was deemed unlawful to eat flesh, and when mankind began to depart from th»ir primitive habits, the flesh of swine was the first that was eaten. For several ages, it was pronounced unlawful to slaughter oxen, from an estimate of their great value in assisting men to cultivate the ground; nor was it usual to kill young animals, from a sentiment which considered it cruel to take away the life of those that had scarcely tasted the joys of existence. At this period no cooks were kept, and we know from Homer that his ancient heroes prepared and dressed their victuals with their own hands. Ulysses, for example, we are told, hke a modern charwoman, excelled at lighting a fire, whilst Achilles was an adept at turning a spit. Subsequently, heralds, employed in civil and military affairs, filled the office of cooks, and managed marriage feasts; but this, no doubt, was after mankind had advanced in the art of living, a step further than roasting, which, in all places, was the ancient manner of dressing meat. 65. The Age of Boasting we may consider as that in which the use of the metals would be introduced as adjuncts to the culinary art; and amongst these, iron, the most useful of them all, would necessarily take a prominent place. This metal is easily oxidized, but to bring it to a state of fusibility, it requires a most intense heat. Of all the metals, it is the widest diffused and most abundant; and few stones or mineral bodies are without an admixture of it. It possesses the valuable property of being welded by hammering; and hence its adaptation to the numerous purposes of civilized life. Metallic grains of iron have been found in strawberries, and a twelfth of the weight of the wood of dried oak is said to consist of this metal. Blood owes its coloiu: of redness to the quantity of iron it contains, and rain and snow are seldom perfectly free from it. In the arts it is employed in three states,—as cast iron, wrought iron, and steel. In each of these it largely enters into the domestic economy, and stoves, grates, and the general implements of cookery, are usually composed of it. In antiquity, its27 ECONOMY OF THE KITCHEN. employment was, comparatively speaking, equaDy universal. The excavations made at Pompeii have proved this. The accompanying cuts present us with specimens of stoves. Fig. 4>. Fig, 5. both ancient and modern. Fig. 2 is the remains of a kitchen stove found in the house of Pansa, at Pompeii, and would seem, in its perfect state, not to have been materially differ- ent from such as are in use at the present day. Fig. 3 is a self-acting, simple open range in modern use, and may be had of two qualities, ranging, according to their dimensions, from £3.10s, and £3.18s. respectively, up to £4. 10s. and £7. 5s. They are completely fitted up with oven, boiler, sliding cheek, wrought-iron bars, revolving shelves, and brass tap. Fig. 4 is called the Improved Leamington Kitchener, and is said to surpass any other range in use, for easy cooking by one tire. It has a hot plate, which is well calculated for an ironing-stove, and on which as many vessels as will stand upon it, may be kept boiling, without being either soiled or injured. Besides, it has a perfectly ventilated and spacious wrought-iron roaster, with movable shelves, draw-out stand, double dripping-pan, and meat-stand. The roaster can be converted into an oven by closing the valves, when bread and pastry can be baked in it in a superior manner. It also has a large iron boiler with brass tap and steam-pipe, round and square gridirons for chops and steaks, ash-pan, open fire for roasting, and a set of ornamental covings with plate-warmer attached. It took a first-class prize and medal in the Great Exhibi- tion of 1851, and was also exhibited, with all the recent improvements, at the Dublin Exhibition in 1853. Fig. 5 is another kitchener, adapted for large families. It has on the one side, a large ventilated oven; and on the other, the fire and roaster. The hot plate is over all, and there is a back boiler, made of wrought iron, with brass tap and steam-pipe. In other respects it resembles Fig. 4, with which it possesses similar advantages of construction. Either may be had at varying prices, according to size, from £5.15s. up to £23.10s. They are supplied by Messrs. Kichard & John Slack, 336, Strand, London. 66. From Kitchen Ranges to the implements used in cookery is but a step. With these, every kitchen should be well supplied, otherwise the cook must not be expected to ^'perform her office" in a satisfactory manner. Of the culinary utensils of the ancients, our knowledge is very limited ; but as the art of living, in every civilized country, is pretty much the same, the instruments for cooking must, in a great degree, bear a striking resemblance to each other.28 MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. On referring to classical antiquities, we find mentioned, among household utensils, leather bags, baskets constructed of twigs, reeds, and rushes ; boxes, basins, and bellows; bread-moulds, brooms, and brushes ; caldrons, colan- ders, cisterns, and chafing-dishes ; cheese-rasps, knives, and ovens of the Dutch kind; funnels and frying-pans ; handmills, soup-ladles, milk-pails, and oil-jars; presses, scales, and sieves ; spits of different sizes, but some of them large enough to roast an ox ; spoons, fire-tongs, trays, trenchers, and drinking- vessels ; with others for carrying food, preserving milk, and holding cheese. This enumeration, if it does nothing else, will, to some extent, indicate the state of the simpler kinds of mechanical arts among the ancients. In so far as regards the shape and construction of many of the kitchen utensils enumerated above, they bore a great resemblance to our own. This will be seen by the accompanying cuts. Fig. 6 is an ancient stock-pot in bronze, which seems to have been made to hang over the fire, and was found in the buried city of Pompeii. Fig. 7 is one of modern make, and may be obtained either of copper or wrought iron, tinned inside. Fig. 8 is another of antiquity, with a large ladle and colander, with holes attached. It is taken from the column of Trajan. The modern ones can be obtained at all prices, according to size, from Ids. 6d. up to £1. Is, 67. In the Manufacture of these Utensils, bronze metal seems to have been much in favour with the ancients. It was chosen not only for their domestic vessels, but it was also much used for their public sculptures and medals. It is a compound, composed of from six to twelve parts of tin to one hundred of copper. It gives its name to figures and all pieces of sculpture made of it. Brass was another favourite metal, which is composed of copjDor and zinc. It is more fusible than copper, and not so apt to tarnish. In a pure state it is not malleable, unless when hot, and after it has been melted twice it will not bear the hammer. To render it capable of being wrought, it re- quires 7 lb. of lead to be put to 1 cwt. of its own material. The Corinthian brass of antiquity was a mixture of silver, gold, and copper. A fine kind of brass, supposed to be made by the cementation of copper plates with calamine, is, in Germany, hammered out into leaves, and is called Dutch metal in this countr}'. It is employed in the same way as gold leaf. Brass is much used for watchworks, as well as for wire. 68. The braziers, ladles, stewpans, saucepans, gridirons, and colanders of antiquity might generally pass for those of the English manufacture of the present day, in so far as shape is concerned. In proof of this we have placed together the following similar articles of ancient and modern pattern, in order Fiff. 6. Fig. 7. Fig. 8.29 ECONOMY OF THE KITCHEN. that the reader may, at a single view, see wherein any difference that is between them, consists. Fig. 12. Ancient. Fig. 15, Modern. Fig. 16. Modern. Fig. 17. Ancient. Fig. 18. Ancient. !Figs. 9 and 10 are flat sauce or saute pans, the ancient one being fluted in the handle, and having at the end a ram's head. Figs. 11 and 12 are colanders, the handle of the ancient one being adorned, in the original, with carved representations of a cornucopia, a satyr, a goat, pigs, and other animals. Any display of taste in the adornment of such utensils, might seem to be useless; but when we remember how much more natural it is for us all to be careful of the beautiful and costly, than of the plain and cheap, it may even become a question in the economy of a kitchen, whether it would not, in the long run, be cheaper to have articles which displayed some tasteful ingenuity in their manu- facture, than such as are so perfectly plain as to have no attractions whatever beyond their mere suitableness to the purposes for which they are made. Figs. 13 and 14 are saucepans, the ancient one being of bronze, originally copied from the cabinet of M. r Abbe Charlet, and engraved in the Antiquities of Montfaucon. Figs. 15 and 17 are gridirons, and 16 and 18 dripping-pans. In all these utensils the resemblance between such as were in use 2,000 years ago, and those in use at the present day, is strikingly manifest. 69. Some op the Ancient Utensils represented in the above cuts, are copied from those found amid the ruins of Herculaneum and Pompeii. These Eoman cities were, in the first century, buried beneath the lava of an eruption of Vesuvius, and continued to be lost to the world till the beginning of the last century, when a peasant, in digging for a well, gradually discovered a small temple with some statues. Little notice, however, was taken of this circumstance till 1736, when the king of Naples, desiring to erect a palace at Portici, caused extensive excavations to be made, when the city of Hercu- laneum was slowly unfolded to view. Pompeii was discovered about 1750, and30 MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. being easier cleared from the lava in which it had so long been entombed, disclosed itself as it existed immediately before the catastrophe which over- whelmed it, nearly two thousand years ago. It presented, to the modern world, the perfect picture of the form and structure of an ancient Roman city. The interior of its habitations, shops, baths, theatres, and temples, were all disclosed, with many of the implements used by the workmen in their various trades^ and the materials on which they were employed, when the doomed city was covered with the lavian stream. 70. Amongst the most essential Requirements of the kitchen are scales or weighing-machines for family use. These are found to have existed among the ancients, and must, at a very early age, have been both publicly and privately employed for the regulation of quantities. The modern English weights were adjusted by the 27th chapter of Magna Charta, or the great charter forced, by the barons, from King John at Runnymede, in Surrey. Therein it is declared that the weights, all over England, shall be the same, although for different commodities there were two different kinds, Troy and Avoirdupois. The origin of both is taken from a grain of wheat gathered in the middle of an ear. The standard of measures was originally kept at Winchester, and by a law of King Edgar was ordained to be observed throughout the kingdom. Mg. 19. Fig. 20. Fig. 19 is an ancient jpair of common scales, with two basins and a movable weight, which, is made in the form of a head, covered with the pileus, because Mercuiy had the weights and measures under his superintendence. It is engraved on a stone in the gallery of Florence. Fig. 20 represents a modern weighing-machine, of great con- venience, and generally in use in those estabUshments where a great deal of cooking is carried on. 71. Accompanying the Scales, or weighing-machines, there should be spice-boxes, and sugar and biscuit-canisters of either white or japanned tin. The covers of these should fit tightly, m order to exclude the air, and if necessary, be lettered in front, to distinguish them. The white metal of which they are usually composed, loses its colour when exposed to the air, but undergoes no further change. It enters largely into the composition of culinary utensils, many of them being entirely composed of tinned sheet-iron ; the inside of copper and iron vessels also, being usually what is called tinned. This art consists of covering any metal with a thin coating of tin; and itECONOMY OP THE KITCHEN. SI requires the metal to be covered, to be perfectly clean and free from rust, and also that the tin, itself, be purely metallic, and entirely cleared from all ashes or refuse. Copper boilers, saucepans, and other kitchen utensils, are tinned after they are manufactured, by being first made hot and the tin rubbed on with resin. In this process, nothing ought to be used but pure grain-tin. Lead, however, is sometimes mixed with that metal, not only to make it lie more easily, but to adulterate it—a pernicious practice, which in every article connected with the cooking and preparation of food, cannot be too severely reprobated. — The following list, supplied by Messrs. Kichard & John Slack, 336, Strand, will show the articles required for the kitchen of a family in the middle class of life, although it does not contain all the things that may be deemed necessary for some families, and may contain more than are required for others. As Messrs. Slack them- selves, however, publish a useful illustrated catalogue, which may be had at their establishment gratis, and which it will be found advantageous to consttlt by those about to furnish, it supersedes the necessity of our enlarging that which we give :— $. d. 1 Tea-kettle 6 6 1 Toasting-fork 1 0 1 Bread-grater 1 0 1 Pair of Brass Candlesticks 3 6 1 Teapot and Tray 6 6 1 Bottle-jack 9 6 6 Spoons 1 6 2 Candlesticks 3 6 1 Candle-box 1 4 6 Knives and Forks 5 3 2 Sets of Skewers 1 0 1 Meat-chopper ,.... 1 9 1 Cinder-sifter 1 3 1 Coffee-pot 2 3 1 Colander 1 6 8 Block-tin Saucepans 5 9 5 Iron Saucepans 12 0 1 Ditto and Steamer 6 6 1 Large Boiling-pot 10 0 4 Iron Stewpans • 8 9 8. d. 6 1 Dripping-pan and Stand ... 1 Dustpan , 1 1 Fish and Egg-slice 1 2 Fish-kettles 10 0 1 Flour-box 1 0 3 Flat-irons 3 6 2 Frying-pans 4 0 1 Gridiron 2 0 1 Mustard-pot 1 0 1 Salt-ceUar 0 8 1 Pepper-box 0 6 1 Pair of BeUows 2 0 3JeUy-mould3 8 0 1 Plate-basket 5 6 1 Cheese-toaster 1 10 1 Coal-shovel 2 6 1 Wood Meat-screen 30 0 The Set , 11 1 72. As NOT ONLY Health but Life may be said to depend on the cleanliness of culinary utensils, great attention must be paid to their con- dition generally, but more especially to that of the saucepans, stewpans, and boilers. Inside they should be kept perfectly clean, and where an open fire is used, the outside as clean as possible. With a Leamington range, saucepans, stewpans, &c., can be kept entirely free from smoke and soot on the outside, which is an immense saving of labour to the cook or scullery-maid. Care should be taken that the lids fit tight and close, so that soups or gravies may not be suffered to waste by evaporation. They should be made to keep the steam in and the smoke out, and should always be bright on the upper rim, where they do not immediately come in contact with the fire. Soup-pots and kettles should be washed immediately after being used, and dried before the fire, and they should be kept in a dryMODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. 32 place, in order that they may escape the deteriorating influence of rust, and, thereby, be destroyed. Copper utensils should never be used in the kitchen unless tinned, and the utmost care should be taken, not to let the tin be rubbed off. If by chance this should occur, have it replaced before the vessel is again brought into use. Neither soup nor gravy should, at any time, be suffered to remain in them longer than is absolutely necessaiy, as any fat or acid that is in them, may affect the metal, so as to impregnate with poison what is intended to be eaten. Stone and earthenware vessels should be pro- vided for soups and gravies not intended for immediate use, and, also, plenty of common dishes for the larder, that the table-set may not be used for such purposes. It is the nature of vegetables soon to turn sour, when they are apt to corrode glazed red-ware, and even metals, and frequently, thereby, to become impregnated with poisonous particles. The vinegar also in pickles, by its acidity, does the same. Consideration, therefore, should be given to these facts, and great care also taken that all sieves, jelly-hags, and tapes for collared articles, be well scalded and kept dry, or they will impart an un- pleasant flavour when next used. To all these directions the cook should pay great attention, nor should they, by any means, be neglected by the mistress of the household, who ought to remember that cleanliness in the kitchen gives health and happiness to home, whilst economy will immeasurably assist in preserving them. 73. Without Fuel, a Kitchen might be pronounced to be of little use; therefore, to discover and invent materials for supplying us with the means of domestic heat and comfort, has exercised the ingenuity of man. Those now known have been divided into five classes ; the first comprehending the fluid inflammable bodies ; the second, peat or turf; the third, charcoal of wood ; the fourth, pit-coal charred ; and the fifth, wood or pit-coal in a crude state, with the capacity of yielding a copious and bright flame. The first may be said seldom to be employed for the purposes of cookery ; but peat, especially amongst rural populations, has, in all ages, been regarded as an excellent fuel. It is one of the most important productions of an alluvial soil, and belongs to the vegetable rather than the mineral kingdom. It may be described as composed of wet, spongy black earth, held together by decayed vegetables. Formerly it covered extensive tracts in England, but has greatly disappeared before the genius of agricultural improvement. Charcoal is a kind of artificial coal, used principally where a strong and clear fire is desired. It is a black, brittle, insoluble, inodorous, tasteless substance, and, when newly-made, possesses the remarkable property of, absorbing certain quantities ot the different gases. Its dust, when used as a polishing powder, gives great brilliancy to metals. It consists of wood half-burned, and is manufactured by cutting pieces of timber into nearly the same size, then disposing them in heaps, and covering them with earth, so as to prevent communication with the air, except when necessary to make them burn. When they have been sufficiently charred, the fire is extinguished by stopping the vents through which the air is admitted. Of coal there are various species;ECONOMY OF THE KITCHEN. ns, pit, culm, slate, cannel, Kilkenny, sulphurous, bovey. Jet, &c. Theso have all their specific differences, and are employed for various purposes; but are all, more or less, used as fuel. The use of coal for burning purposes was not known to tlio Bomans. In Britain it was discovered about fifty years before the birth of Christ, in Lancashire, not far from where Manchester now stands; but for ages after its discovery, so long as forests abounded, wood continued to be the fuel used for Si-ing. The first public notice of coal is in the reign of Henry III,, who, in 1272, granted a charter to the town of Newcastle, permitting the inhabitants to dig for coal. It took some centuries more, how- ever, to bring it into common use, as this did not take place till about the first quarter of the seventeenth century, in the time of Charles I. A few years after the Kestoration, we find that about 200,000 chaldrons were consumed in London. Although several countries possess mines of coal, the quahty of their mineral is, in general, greatly inferior to that of Great Britain, where it is f<^und mostly in undulating districts abounding with valleys, and interspersed with plains of considerable extent. It lies usually between the strata of other substances, and rarely in an horizontal position, but with a dip or inclination to one side. Our cut, Fig. 21, represents a section of coal as it is found in the stratum. Fig. 21. 74. To BE ACQUAINTED WITH THE PERIODS when things are in season, is one of the most essential pieces of knowledge which enter into the '^Arfc of Cookery."

When Fuel and Food ahe pFvOCURED, the next consideration is, how the latter may be best preserved, with a view to its being suitably dressed. More waste is often occasioned by the want of judgment, or of necessary care in this particular, than by any other cause. In the absence of proper places for keeping provisions, a hanging safe, suspended in an airy situation, is the best substitute. A well-ventilated larder, dry and shady, is better for meat and poultry, which require to be kept for some time j and the utmost skill in the culinary art will not compensate for the want of proper attention to this particular. Though it is advisable that animal food should be hung up in the open air till its fibres have lost some degree of their toughness, yet, if it is kept till it loses its natural sweetness, its flavour has become dete- riorated, and, as a v;holesome comestible, it has lost many of its qualities conducive to health. As soon, therefore, as the slightest trace of putrescence is detected, it has reached its highest degree of tenderness, and should be dressed immediately. During the sultry summer months, it is difficult to procure meat that is not either tough or tainted. It should, therefore, be well examined when it comes in, and if flies have touched it, the part must be cut off, and the remainder well washed. In very cold weather, meat and vegetables touched by the frost, should be brought into the kitchen early in the movning, and soaked in cold water. In loins of meat, the long pipe that runs by the bone should be taken out, as it is apt to taint; as also the kernels of beef. Eumps and edgebones of beef, when bruised, should not be purchased. All these things ought to enter into the consideration of every household manager, and great care should be taken that nothing is thrown away, or suffered to be wasted in the kitchen, which might, by proper management, be turned to a good account. Tho shank-bones of mutton, so little esteemed in general, give richness to soups or gravies, if well soaked and brushed before they are added to the boiling. They are also particularly nourishing for sick persons. Roast-beef bones, or shank-bones of ham, make excellent stock for pea-soup.—When the whites of eggs are used for jelly, confectionary, or otherMODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. 38 purposes, a pudding or a custard should be made, tliat the yolks may be used. All things likely to be wanted should be in readiness : sugars of different sorts ; currants washed, picked, and perfectly dry; spices pounded, and kept in very small bottles closely corked, or in canisters, as we have already directed (72). Not more of these should be purchased at a time than are likely to be used in the course of a month. Much waste is always prevented by keeping every article in the place best suited to it. Vegetables keep best on a stone floor, if the air be excluded; meat, in a cold dry place ; as also salt, sugar, sweet- meats, candles, dried meats, and hams. Rice, and all sorts of seed for puddings, should be closely covered to preserve them from insects ; but even this will not prevent them from being affected by these destroyers, if they are long and carelessly kept.39 CHAPTEE ly. INTRODUCTIOlSr TO COOKEBY, 76. As IN THE Fine Aets, the progress of mankind from barbarism to civiliza- tion is marked by a gradual succession of triumphs over the rude materialities of nature, so in the art of cookery is the progress gradual from the earliest and simplest modes, to those of the most complicated and refined. Plain or rudely-carved stones, tumuli, or mounds of earth, are the monuments by which barbarous tribes denote the events of their history, to be succeeded, only in the long course of a series of ages, by beautifully-proportioned columns, gracefully-sculptured statues, triumphal arches, coins, medals, and the higher efforts of the pencil and the pen, as man advances by culture and observation to the perfection of his faculties. So is it with the art of cookery. Man, in his primitive state, lives upon roots and the fruits of the earth, until, by degrees, he is driven to seek for new means, by which his wants may be supplied and enlarged. He then becomes a hunter and a fisher. As his species increases, greater necessities come upon him, when he gradually abandons the roving life of the savage for the more stationary pursuits of the herdsman. These beg^efc still more settled habits, when he begins the practice of agriculture, forms ideas of the rights of property, and has his own, both defined and secured. The forest, the stream, and the sea are now no longer his only resources for food. He sows and he reaps, pastures and breeds cattle, lives on the cultivated produce of his fields, and revels in the luxuries of the dairy ; raises flocks for clothing, and assumes, to all intents and purposes, the habits of permanent life and the comfortable condition of a farmer. This is the fourth stage of social progress, up to which the useful or mechanical arts have been incidentally developing themselves, when trade and commerce begin. Through these various phases, onl^ to live has been the great object of mankind; but, by-and-by, comforts are multiplied, and accumulating riches create new wants. The object, then, is not only to live, but to live economically, agreeably, tastefully, and well. Accordingly, the art of cookery commences; and although the fruits of the earth, the fowls of the air, the beasts of the field, and the fish of the sea, are still the only food of mankind, yet these are so prepared, improved, and dressed by skill and ingenuity, that they are the means of immeasurably extending the boundaries of human enjoyments. Everything that is edible, and passes under the hands of the cook, is more or less changed, and assumes new forms. Hence the influence of that iunctionary is immense upon the happiness of a household. 77. In order that the duties of the Cook may be properly performed, and that he may be able to reproduce esteemed dishes with certainty, all40 MODERN HOTJSEHOLD COOKERY. terms of indecision sliould be banished from his art. Accordingly, what is known only to him, will, in these pages, be made known to others. In them all those indecisive terms expressed oy a bit of this, some of that, a small piece of that, and a handful of the other, shall never be made use of, but all quantities be precisely and explicitly stated. With a desire, also, that all ignorance on this most essential part of the culinary art should disappear, and that a uniform system of weights and measures should be adopted, we give an account of the weights which answer to certain measures. A Table-spoonful is frequently mentioned in a recipe, in the prescriptions of medical men, and also in medical, chemical, and gastronomical works. By it is generally meant and understood a measure or bulk equal to that which would be produced by half an ounce of water. A Dessert-spoonful is the half of a table-spoonful; that is to say, by it is meant a measure or bulk equal to a quarter of an ounce of water, A Tea-spoonful is equal in quantity to a drachm of water. A Drop.—This is the name of a vague kind of measure, and is so called on account of the liquid being dropped from the mouth of a bottle. Its quantity, hov/ever, will vary, either from the consistency of the liquid or the size and shape of the mouth of the bottle. The College of Physicians determined ^^^^^ the quantity of a drop to be one grain, 60 drops making r - "f one fluid drachm. Their drop, or sixtieth part of a fluid j ; drachm, is called a minim. i|j : Graduated glass measures can be obtained at any chemist's, and , I : they save much trouble. One of these, containing a wine pint, is jll ; divided into 16 oz., and the oz. into 8 drachms of water; by which |, - J any certain weight mentioned in a recipe can be accurately measured ^sep*^ out. Home-made measures of this kind can readily be formed by ,^^g^^;;^,_i;;»»^ 1,^ weighing the water contained in any given measure, and marking on any tall glass the space it occupies. This mark can easily be Fig. 22. made with a file. It will be interesting to many readers to know the basis on which the French found their system of weights and measures, for it certainly possesses the grandeur of simplicity. The metre, which is the basis of the whole system of French weights and measures, is the exact measurement of one forty-millionth part of a meridian of the earth. ^8. Excellence in the Art of Cookery, as in all other things, is only attain- able by practice and experience. In proportion, therefore, to the opportunities wliich a cook has had of these, so will be his excellence in the art. It is in the large establishments of princes, noblemen, and very affluent families alone, that the man cook is found in this country. He, also, superintends the kitchens of large hotels, clubs, and public institutions, where he, usually, makes out the bills of fare, which are generally submitted to the principal for approval. To be able to do this, therefore, it is absolutely necessary that he should be a judge of the season of every dish, as well as know perfectly the state of every article he undertakes to prepare. He must also be a judge of every article he buys ; for no skill, however great it may be, will enable him to make that good which is really bad. On him rests the responsibility of the cooking generally, whilst a speciality of his department, is to prepare the rich soups, stews, ragouts, and such dishes as enter into the more refined and41 INTRODUCTION TO COOKERY. complicated portions of liis art, and such as are nob usually understood by ordinary professors. He, therefore, holds a high position in a household, being inferior in rank, as already shown (21), only to the house steward, the valet, and the butler. In the luxurious ages of Grecian antiquity, Sicilian cooks were the most esteemed, and received high rewards for their services. Among them, one called Trimalcio was such an adept in his art, that he could impart to common fish both the form and flavour of the most esteemed of the piscatory tribes. A chief cook in the palmy days of Eomaii voluptuousness had about £800 a year, and Antony rewarded the one that cooked the supper which pleased Cleopatra, with the present of a city. With the fall of the empire, the culinary art sank into less consideration. In the middle ages, cooks laboured to acquire a reputation for their sauces, which they composed of strange combinations, for the sake of novelty, as well as singularity, 79. The Duties of the Cook, thiI Kitchen and the Scullery Maids, are so intimately associated, that they can hardly be treated of separately. The cook, how^ever, is at the head of the kitchen; and in proportion to her IDossession of the qualities of cleanliness, neatness, order, regularity, and celerity of action, so will her influence appear in the conduct of those who are under her; as it is upon her that the whole responsibility of the business of the kitchen rests, w^hilst the others must lend her, both a ready and a willing assistance, and bo especially tidy ia their appearance, and active in their movements. In the larger estabhshments of the middle ages, cooks, with the authority of feudal chiefs, gave their orders from a high chair in which they ensconced themselves, and commanded a view of all that was going on throughout their several domains. Each held a long wooden spoon, with which he tasted, without leaving his seat, the various comestibles that were cooking on the stoves, and which he frequently used as a rod of punishment on the backs of those whose idleness and gluttony too largely predominated over their diligence and temperance, 80. If, as we have said (3), the Quality of Early Rising be of the first importance to the mistress, w^hat must it be to the servant! Let it, therefore, be taken as a long-proved truism, that without it, in every domestic, the effect of all things else, so far as ivorh is concerned, may, in a great measure, be neutralized. In a cook, this quality is most essential; for an hour lost in tho morning, will keep her toiling, absolutely toihng, all day, to overtake that which might otherwise have been achieved with ease. In large establishments, six is a good hour to rise in the summer, and seven in the winter. 8t. Her First Duty, in large establishments and where it is requisite, should be to set her dough for the breakfast rolls, provided this has not been done on the previous night, and then to engage herself with those numerous little preliminary occupations which may not inappropriately be termed laying out her duties for the day. This will bring in the breakfast hour of eight, after which, directions must be given, and preparations made, for the different dinners of the household and family. 82. In those numerous households where a cook and housemaid are only kept, the general custom is, that the cook should have the charge of theMODEEN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. 42 dining-room. The hall, the lamps and the doorstep are also committed to her care, and any other work there may be on the outside of the house. In establishments of this kind, the cook will, after having lighted her kitchen fire, carefully brushed the range, and cleaned the hearth, proceed to prepare for breakfast. She will thoroughly rinse the kettle, and, filhng it with fresh water, will put it on the fire to boil. She will then go to the breakfast-room, or parlour, and there make all things ready for the breakfast of the family. Her attention will next be directed to the hall, which she will sweep and wipe; the kitchen stairs, if there be any, will now be swept; and the hall mats, which have been removed and shaken, will be again put in their places. The cleaning of the kitchen, pantry, passages, and kitchen stairs must always be over before breakfast, so that it may not interfere with the other business of the day. Everything should be ready, and the whole house should wear a comfortable aspect when the heads of the house and members of the family make their appearance. jN'othing, it may be depended on, wiU so please the mistress of an establishment, as to notice that, although she has not been present to see that the work was done, atten- tion to smaller matters has been carefully paid, with a view to giving her satisfaction and increasing her comfort, 83. By the time that the Cook has performed the duties mentioned above, and well swept, brushed, and dusted her kitchen, the breakfast-bell will most likely summon her to the parlour, to " bring in " the breakfast. It is the cook's department, generally, in the smaller establishments, to wait at breakfast, as the housemaid, by this time, has gone up-stairs into the bedrooms, and has there applied herself to her various duties. The cook usually answers the bells and single knocks at the door in the early part of the morning, as the tradesmen, with whom it is her more special business to speak, call at these hours. 84. It is in her Preparation op the Dinner that the cook begins to feel the weight and responsibility of her situation, as she must take upon herself all the dressing and the serving of the principal dishes, which her skill and ingenuity have mostly prepared. Whilst these, however, are cooking, she must be busy with her pastry, soups, gravies, ragouts, &c. Stock, or what the French call consommS, being the basis of most made dishes, must be always at hand, in conjunction with her sweet herbs and spices for seasoning. '^A place for everything, and everything in its place," must be her rule, in order that time may not be wasted in looking for things when they are wanted, and in order that the whole apparatus of cooking may move with the regularity and precision of a well-adjusted machine;—all must go on simultaneously. The vegetables and sauces must be ready with the dishes they are to accompany, and in order that they may be suitable, the smallest oversight must not be made in their preparation. When the dinner-hour has arrived, it is the duty of the cook to dish-up such dishes as may, without injury, stand, for some time, covered on the hot plate or in the hot closet; but such as are of a more important or recherche kind, must be delayed until the order ''to serve" is given from the drawing-room. Then comes45 INTRODUCTION TO COOKERY. haste; but there must bo no hurry,—all must work with order. The cooli takes charge of the fish, soups, and poultry; and the kitchen-maid of the vegetables, sauces, and gravies. These she puts into their appropriate dishes, whilst the scullery-maid waits on and assists the cook. Everything must be timed so as to prevent its getting cold, whilst great care should be taken, that, between the first and second courses, no more time is allowed to elapse than is necessary, for fear that the company in the dining-room lose all relish for what has yet to come of the dinner. When the dinner has been served, the most important feature in the daily life of the cook is at an end. She must, however, now begin to look to the contents of her larder, taking care to keep everything sweet and clean, so that no disagreeable smells may arise from the gravies, milk, or meat that may be there. These are the principal duties of a cook in a first-rate establishment. In smaller establishments, the housekeeper often conducts the higher department of cooking (see 58, 59, 60), and the cook, with the assistance of a scuUery-maid; performs some of the subordinate duties of the kitchen- maid. When circumstances render it necessary, the cook engages to perform the whole of the work of the kitchen, and, in some places, a portion of the house-work also. 85. Whilst the Cook is engaged with her Morning Duties, the kitchen-maid is also occupied with hers. Her first duty, after the fire is lighted, is to sweep and clean the kitchen, and the various ofiices belonging to it. This she does every morning, besides cleaning the stone steps at the entrance of the house, the halls, the passages, and the stairs which lead to the kitchen. Her general duties, besides these, are to wash and scour all these places twice a week, with the tables, shelves, and cupboards. She has also to dress the nursery and servants'-hall dinners, to prepare all fish, poultry, and vegetables, trim meat joints and cutlets, and do all such duties as may be considered to enter into the cook's department in a subordmate degree. 86. The Duties of the Scullery-maid are to assist the cook; to keep the scullery clean, and all the metallic as well as earthenware kitchen utensils. The position of scullery-maid is not, of course, one of high rank, nor is the payment for her services large. But if she be fortunate enough to have over her a good kitchen- maid and clever cook, she may very soon learn to perform various little duties connected with cooking operations, which may be of considerable service in fitting her for a more responsible place. Now, it wiU be doubtless thought by the majority of our readers, that the fascinations connected with the position of the scuUery-maid, are not so great as to induce many people to leave a comfortable home in order to work in a scullery. But we are acquainted with one instance in which the desire, on the part of a young girl, was so strong to become connected with the kitchen and cookery, that she abso- lutely left her parents, and engaged herself as a scullery-maid in a gentleman's house. Here she showed herself so active and intelligent, that she very quickly rose to the rank of kitchen-maid; and from this, so great was her gastronomical genius, she became, m a short space of time, one of the best women-cooks in England. Mtei this, we think, it must be allowed, that a cook, like a poet, nascitur, nonfit.MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. 87. Modern Cookery stands so greatly indebted to tlie gastronomic pro- pensities of our French neighbours, that many of their terms are adopted and applied by English artists to th© same as well as similar preparations of their own. A vocabulary of these is, therefore, indispensable in a work of this kind. Accordingly, tho following will be found sufficiently complete for all ordinary purposes:— EXPLANATION OF FEENCH TERMS USED IN MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. Aspic.—A savoury jelly, used as an exterior moiilding for cold game, poultry, fish, &c. This, being of a transparent nature, allows the bird which it covers to be seen through it. This may also be used for decorating or garnishing. AssiETTE (plate).—Assiettes are the small entrees and Jiors-d^ceuvres, the quantity of which does not exceed what a plate will hold. At dessert, fruits, cheese, chestnuts, biscuits, &c., if served upon a plate, are termed assiettes.— AssiETTE VOLANTE is a dish which a servant hands round to the guests, but is not placed upon the table. Small cheese souffles and different dishes, which ought to be served very hot, are frequently m-ade assiettes volantes. Au-ELEU.—Fish dressed in such a manner as to have a bluish appearance. Bain-marie.—An open saucepan or kettle of nearly boiling water, in which a smaller vessel can be set for cooking and warming. This is very useful for keeping articles hot, without altering their quantity or quality. If you keep sauce, broth, or soup by the fireside, the soup reduces and becomes too strong, and the sauce thickens as well as reduces; but this is prevented by using the bain-marie, in which the water should be very hot, but not boiling. Bechamel.—French white sauce, now frequently used in Enghsh cookery. Blanch.—To whiten poultry, vegetables, fruit, &c., by plunging them into boiling water for a short time, and afterwards plunging them into cold water, there to remain until they are cold. Blanquette.—A sort of fricassee. BouiLLi.—Beef or other meat boiled; but, generally speaking, boiled beef is understood by the term. Bouillie.—A French dish resembling hasty-pudding. Bouillon.—A thin broth or soup. Braise.—To stew meat with fat bacon until it is tender, it having previously been blanched, BraisierE.—A saucepan having a lid with ledges, to put fire on the top. Brider.—To pass a packthread through poultry, game, &c., to keep together their members. Caramel (burnt sugar).—This is made with a piece of sugar, of tho size of a nut, browned in the bottom of a saucepan; upon which a cupful ot stock is45 INTRODUCTION TO COOKERY. gradually poured, stirring all the time a glass of broth, little by little. It may be used with the feather of a quill, to colour meats, such as the upper part of fricandeaux r and to impart colour to sauces. Caramel made with water instead of stock may be used to colour comjpCtcs and other entremets. Casserole.—A crust of rice, which, after having been moulded into the form of a pie, is baked, and then filled with a fricassee of white meat or a pur^e of game. Compote.—A stew, as of fruit or pigeons. Consomme.—Rich stock, or gravy. Croquette.—Ball of fried rice or potatoes. Croutons.—Sippets of bread. Daubii^ire.—An oval stev/pan, in which daubcs are cooked; dauhes being meat or fowl stewed in sauce. DiisosSER.—To lone, or take out the bones from poultry, game, or fish. This is an operation requiring considerable experience. Entrees.—Small side or corner dishes, served with the first course. Entremets.—Small side or corner dishes, served with the second course. Escalopes.—CoUops ; small, -ound, thin pieces of tender meat, or of fish, beaten with the handle of a strong knife to make them tender. Feuilletage.—Puff-paste. Flamber.—To singe fowl or game, after they have been picked. FoNCER.—To put in the bottom of a saucepan slices of ham, veal, or thin broad slices of bacon. Galette.—A broad thin cake. Gateau.—A cake, correctly speaking; but used sometimes to denote a pudding and a kind of tart. Glacer.—To glaze, or spread upon hot meats, or larded fowl, a thick and rich sauce or gravy, called glaze. This is laid on with a feather or brush, and in confectionary the term means to ice fruits and pastry vdth sugar, which glistens on hardening. Hors-d'(EUVRES,—Small dishes, or assiettes volantes of sardines, anchovies, and other relishes of this kind, served to the guests during the first course. {See Assiettes volantes.) Lit.—A bed or layer; articles in thin slices are jDlaced in layers, other articles, or seasoning, being laid between them. Maigre.—Broth, soup, or gravy, made without meat. Matelote.—A rich fish-stew, which is generally composed of carj?, eels, trout, or barbel. It is made with wine. Mayonnaise.—Cold sauce, or salad dressing. Menu.—The bill of fare. Meringue.—A kind of icing, made of whites of eggs and sugar, well beaten.MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. 46 MiROTON.—Larger slices of meat than collops; such as slices of beef for a vinaigrette, or ragout or stew of onions. MouiLLER.—To add water, broth, or other liquid, during the cooking. Paner.—To cover over with very fine crumbs of bread, meats, or any other articles to be cooked on the gridiron, in the oven, or frying-pan. PiQUER.—To lard with strips of fat bacon, poultry, game, meat, &c. This should always be done according to the vein of the meat, so that in carving you slice the bacon across as well as the meat. POELEE.—Stock used instead of water for boiling turkeys, sweetbreads, fowls, and vegetables, to render them less insipid. This is rather an expensive preparation. Puree.—Vegetables, or meat reduced to a very smooth pulp, which is afterwards mixed with enough liquid to make it of the consistency of very thick soup. Eagout.—Stew or hash. Kemoulade.—Salad dressing. KissOLES.—Pastry, made of light puff-paste, and cut into various forms, and fried. They may be filled with fish, meat, or sweets. Roux.—Brown and white; French thickening. Salmi.—Ragout of game previously roasted. Sauce Piquante.—A sharp sauce, in which somewhat of a vinegar flavour predominates. Sauter.—To dress with sauce in a saucepan, repeatedly moving it about. Tamis.—Tammy, a sort of open cloth or sieve through which to strain broth and sauces, so as to rid them of small bones, froth, &c. TOURTE.—Tart. Fruit pie. Trousser.—To truss a bird; to put together the body and tie the wings and thighs, in order to round it for roasting or boiling, each being tied then with packthread, to keep it in the required form. Vol-AU-VENT.—A rich crust of very fine puff-paste, which may be filled with various delicate ragouts or fricassees, of fish, flesh, or fowl. Fruit may also be inclosed in a vol-an-veni^i7 SOUPS. CHAPTER V. GElTEBAIi DIRECTIONS FOR MAKING SOUPS. 88. Lean, juicy Beep^ Mutton, and Veal, form the basis of all good soups; therefore it is advisable to procure those pieces which afford the richest succulence, and such as are fresh-killed. Stale meat renders them bad, and fat is not so well adapted for making them. The principal art in composing good rich soup, is so to proportion the several ingredients that the flavour of one shall not predominate over another, and that all the articles of which it is composed, shall form an agreeable whole. To accomplish this, care must be taken that the roots and herbs are perfectly well cleaned, and that the water is proportioned to the quantity of meat and other ingredients. Generally a quart of water may be allowed to a pound of meat for soups, and half the quantity for gravies. In making soups or gravies, gentle stewing or simmering is incomparably the best. It may be remarked, however, that a really good soup can never be made but in a well-closed vessel, although, perhaps, greater wholesomeness is obtained by an occasional exposure to the air. Soups will, in general, take from three to six hours doing, and are much better prepared the day before they are wanted. When the soup is cold, the fat may be much more easily and completely removed ; and when it is poured offi care must be taken not to disturb the settlings at the bottom of the vessel, which are so fine that they will escape through a sieve, A tamis is48 MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKEBY, the best strainer, and if the soup is strained while it is hot, let the tamis or cloth be previously soaked in cold water. Clear soups must be perfectly transparent, and thickened soups about the consistence of cream. To thicken and give body to soups and gravies, potato-mucilage, arrow-root, bread-rasp- ings, isinglass, flour and butter, barley, rice, or oatmeal, in a lil^tle water rubbed well together, are used. A piece of boiled beef pounded to a pulp, with a bit of butter and flour, and rubbed through a sieve, and gradually incorporated with the soup, will be found an excellent addition. When the soup appears to be too thin or too weak, the cover of the boiler should be taken off, and the contents allowed to boil till some of the watery parts have evaporated ; or some of the thickening materials, above mentioned, should bo added. When soups and gravies are kept from day to day in hot weather, they should be warmed up every day, and put into fresh scalded pans or tureens, and placed in a cool cellar. In temperate weather, every other day may be sufficient. 89. Various Herbs and Vegetables are required for the purpose of making soups and gravies. Of these the principal are,—Scotch barley, pearl barley, wheat flour, oatmeal, bread-raspings, pease, beans, rice, vermicelli, macaroni, isinglass, potato-mucilage, mushroom or mushroom ketchup, champignons, parsnips, carrots, beetroot, turnips, garlic, shalots, and onions. Sliced onions, fried with butter and flour till they are browned, and then rubbed through a sieve, are excellent to heighten the colour and flavour of brown soups and sauces, and form the basis of many of the fine relishes furnished by the cook. The older and drier the onion, the stronger will be its flavour. Leeks, cucumber, or burnet vinegar ; celery or celery-seed pounded. The latter, though equally strong, does not impart the delicate sweetness of the fresh vegetable ; and when used as a substitute, its flavour should be corrected by the addition of a bit of sugar. Cress-seed, parsley, common thyme, lemon thyme, orange thyme, knotted marjoram, sage, mint, winter savoury, and basil. As fresh green basil is seldom to be procured, and its fine flavour is soon lost, the best way of preserving the extract is by pouring wine on the fresh leaves. 90. For the Seasoning op Soups, bay-leaves, tomato, tarragon, chervil, burnet, allspice, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, clove, mace, black and white pepper, essence of anchovy, lemon-peel, and juice, and Seville orange-juice, are all taken. The latter imparts a finer flavour than the lemon, and the acid is much milder. These materials, with wine, mushroom ketchup, Harvey's sauce, tomato sauce, combined in various proportions, are, with other ingredients, manipulated into an almost endless variety of excellent soups and gravies. Soups, which are intended to constitute the principal part of a meal, certainly ought not to be flavoured like sauces, which are only designed to give a relish to some particular dish.SOUP, BROTH, AND BOUILLON. 91. It has been asserted, that English cookery is, nationally speakini^, far from being the best in the world. More than this, we have been frequently told by brilliant foreign writers, half philosophers, half chefs, that we are the worst cooks on the face of the earth, and that the proverb which alludes to the divine origin of food, and the precisely opposite origin of its preparers, is peculiarly applicable to us islanders. Not, however, to the inhabitants of the whole island ; for, it is stated in a work which treats of culinary operations,, north of the Tweed, that the broth" of Scotland claims, for excellence and wholesomeness, a very close second place to the bouillon, or common soup of France. Three hot meals of broth and meat, for about the price of one: roasting joint," our Scottish brothers and sisters get, they say ; and we hasten to assent to what we think is now a very well-ascertained fact. We are glad to note, however, that soups of vegetables, fish, meat, and game, are now very frequently found in the homes of the English middle classes, as well as in the mansions of the wealthier and more aristocratic ; and we take this to be one evidence, that we are on the right road to an improvement in our system ot cookery. One great cause of many of the spoilt dishes and badly-cooked:^^ meats which are brought to our tables, arises, we think, and most will: agree with us, from a non-acquaintance with common, every-day things." Entertaining this view, we intend to preface the chapters of this work with a simple scientific resume of all those causes and circumstances which relate to the food we have to prepare, and the theory and chemistry of the various culinary operations. Accordingly, this is the proper place to treat of the, quality of the flesh of animals, and describe some of the circumstances which influence it for good or bad. We will, therefore, commence with the circumstance of age, and examine how far tliis afiects the quality of meat. 92. During the period between the Birth and Maturity op Animals, their flesh undergoes very considerable changes. For instance, when the animal is young, the fluids which the tissues of the muscles contain, possess a large proportion of what is called alhunien. This albumen, which is also the chief component of the white of eggs, possesses the peculiarity of coagulating or hardening at a certain temperature, like the white of a boiled egg, into a soft, white fluid, no longer soluble, or capable of being dissolved in water. As animals grow older, this peculiar animal matter gradually decreases, in proportion to the other constituents of the juice of the flesh. Thus, the reason why veal, lamb, and young pork are white, and without gravy when cooked, is, that the large quantity of albumen they contain hardens, or becomes coagulated. On the other hand, the reason why beef and muttoa E I50 MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. are hroivn, and have gravy, is, that the proportion of albumen they containj is small;, in comparison with their greater quantity of fluid which is soluble, and not coagulable. 93. The Quality of the Flesh of an Animal is considerably influenced by the nature of the food on which it has been fed; for the food supplies the material which produces the flesh. If the food be not suitable and good, the meat cannot be good either ; just as the paper on which these words are printed, could not be good, if the rags from which it is made, were not of a fine quality. To the experienced in this matter, it is well known that the flesh of animals fed on farinaceous produce, such as corn, pulse, &c., is fii-m, well-flavoured, and also economical in the cooking ; that the flesh of those fed on succulent and pulpy substances, such as roots, possesses these qualities in a somewhat less degree; whilst the flesh of those whose food contains fixed oil, as linseed, is greasy, high coloured, and gross in the fat, and if the food has been used in large quantities, possessed of a rank flavour. 94. It is indispensable to the Good Quality of Meat, that the animal should be perfectly healthy at the time of its slaughter. However slight the disease in an animal may be, inferiority in the quality of its flesh, as food, is certain to be produced. In most cases, indeed, as the flesh of diseased animals has a tendency to very rapid putrefaction, it becomes not only unwholesome, but absolutely poisonous, on account of the absorption of the virus of the unsound meat into the systems of those who partake of it. The external indications of good and bad meat will be described under its own particular head, but we may here premise that the Iyer of all wholesome meat, when freshly killed, adheres firmly to the bone. 95. Another Circumstance greatly Affecting the Quality of Meat, is the animal's treatment hefore it is slaughtered. This influences its value and wholesomeness in no inconsiderable degree. It will be easy to understand this, when we reflect on those leading principles by which the life of an animal is supported and maintained. These are, the digestion of its food, and the assimilation of that food into its substance. Nature, in effecting this pro- cess, first reduces the food in the stomach to a state of pulp, under the name of chyme, which passes into the intestines, and is there divided into two principles, each distinct from the other. One, a milk-white fluid, — the nutritive portion,—is absorbed by innumerable vessels which open upon the mucous membrane, or inner coat of the intestines. These vessels, or absorbents, discharge the fluid into a common duct, or road, along which it is conveyed to the large veins in the neighbourhood of the heart. Here it is mixed with the venous blood (which is black and impure) returning from every part of the body, and then it supplies the waste which is occasioned in the circulating stream by the arterial (or pure) blood having furnished matter for the substance of the animal. The blood of the animal having completed its course through all parts, and having had its waste recruited by the digested food, is now received51 THE CHEMISTRY AND ECONOMY OF SOUP-MAKING. into the heart, and by the action of that organ it is urged through the kings, there to receive its purification from the air which the animal inhales. Again returning to the heart, it is forced through the arteries, and thence distributed, by innumerable ramifications, called capillaries, bestowing to every part of the animal, life and nutriment. The other principle—the innutritive portion— passes from the intestines, and is thus got rid of. It will now be readily under- stood how flesh is affected for bad^ if an animal is slaughtered when the circu- lation of its blood has been increased by over-driving, ill-usage, or other causes of excitement, to such a degree of rapidity as to be too great for the capillaries to perform their functions, and causing the blood to be congealed in its minuter vessels. Where this has been the case, the meat will be dark-coioured, and become rapidly putrid ; so that self-interest and humanity alike dictate kind and gentle treatment of all animals destined to serve as food for man. THE CHEMISTRY AHD ECONOMY OP SOUP-MAKING. 96. Stock being the Basis of all meat soups, and, also, of all the principal sauces, it is essential to the success of these culinary operations, to know the most complete and economical method of extracting, from a certain quantity of meat, the best possible stock or broth. The theory and philosophy of this process we will, therefore^ explain, and then proceed to show the practical course to be adopted. 97. As ALL Meat is principally composed of fibres, fat, gelatine, osmazomcj and albumen, it is requisite to know that the fibres are inseparable, constituting almost all that remains of the meat after it has undergone a long boiling. 98. Fat is dissolved by boiling; but as it is contained in cells covered by a very fine membrane, which never dissolves, a portion of it always dheres to the fibres. The other portion rises to the surface of the stock, and is that which has escaped from the cells which were not whole, or which have burst by boiling. 99. Gelatine is soluble : it is the basis and the nutritious portion of the stock. When there is an abundance of it, it causes the stocky when cold, to become a jelly. 100. Osmazome is soluble even when cold, and is that part of the meat which gives flavour and perfume to the stock. The flesh of old animals contains more osmazome than that of young ones. Brown meats contain more than white, and the former make the stock more fragrant. By roasting meat, the osmazome appears to acquire higher properties ; so, by putting the remains of roast meats into your stock-pot, you obtain a better flavour £2MODERN HorssnoLD COOKEr.r. 52 101. Albumen is of the nature of the white of eggs; it can be dissolved in cold or tepid water, but coagulates when it is put into water not quite at the boiling-point. From this property in albumen, it is evident that if the meat is put into the stock-pot when the water boils, or after this is made to boil up quickly, the albumen, in both cases, hardens. In the first it rises to the sur- face, in the second it remains in the meat, but in both it prevents the gelatine and osmazome from dissolving; and hence a thin and tasteless stock will be obtained. It ought to bo known, too, that the coagulation of the albumen in the meat, always takes place, more or less, according to the size of the piece, as the parts farthest from the surface always acquire that degree of heat which congeals it before entirely dissolving it. 102. Bones ought always to form a component part of the stock-pot. They are composed of an earthy substance,—to which they owe their solidity,—of gelatine, and a fatty fluid, something like marrow. Two ounces of them con- tain as much gelatine as one jwund of meat; but in them, this is so incased in the earthy substance, that boiling water can dissolve only the surface of whole bones. By breaking them, however, you can dissolve more, because you multiply their surfaces ; and by reducing them to powder or paste, you can dissolve them entirely ; but you must not grind them dry. We have said (99) that gelatine forms the basis of stock; but this, though very nourishing, is entirely without taste ; and to make the stock savoury, it must contain osmazome. Of this, bones do not contain a particle ; and that is the reason why stock made entirely of them, is not liked ; but when you add meat to the broken or pulverized bones, the osmazome contained in it makes the stock . sufficiently savoury. 103. In concluding this part of our subject, the following condensed hints " -^d directions should be attended to in the economy of soup-making :— I. Beef makes the best Stock ; veal stock has less colour and taste; ' whilst mutton sometimes gives it a tallowy smell, far from agreeable, unless the meat has been previously roasted or broiled. Fowls add very little to the flavour of stock, unless they be old and fat. Pigeons, when they are old, add the most flavour to it; and a rabbit or partridge is also a great . improvement. From the freshest meat the best stock is obtained. II. If the Meat be Boiled solely to make stock, it must be cut up into the smallest possible pieces ; but, generally speaking, if it is desired to have good stock and a piece of savoury meat as well, it is necessary to put a rather large piece into the stock-pot, say sufficient for two or three days, during which time the stock will keep well in all weathers. Choose the freshest meat, and liave it cut as thick as possible ; for if it is a thin, flat piece, it will not look well, and will be very soon spoiled by the boiling. III. Never t^ash Meat, as it deprives its surface of all its juices j separat*53 THE CHEMISTRY AND ECONOMY OF SOUP-MAKIXG. it from the bones, and tie it round with tape, so that its shape may be pre- served, then put it into the stock-pot, and for each pound of meat, let there be one pint of water; press it down with the hand, to allow the air, which it contains, to escape, and which often raises it to the top of the water. IV. Put the Stock-pot on a gentle fire, so that it may heat gradually. The albumen will first dissolve, afterwards coagulate ; and as it is in this state lighter than the liquid, it will rise to the surface; bringing with it all its impurities. It is this which makes the scum. The rising of the hardened albumen has the same effect in clarifying stock as the white of eggs ; and, as a rule, it may be said that the more scum there is, the clearer will be the stock. Always take care that the fire is very regular, V. Remove the Scum when it rises thickly, and do not let the stock boil, because then one portion of the scum will be dissolved, and the other go to the bottom of the pot; thus rendering it very difficult to obtain a clear broth. If the fire is regular, it will not be necessary to add cold water in order to make the scum rise; but if the fire is too large at first, it will then be necessary to do so. VI. When the Stock is well skimmed, and begins to boil, put in salt and vegetables, which may be two or three carrots, two turnips, one parsnip, a bunch of leeks and celery tied together. You can add, according to taste, a piece of cabbage, two or three cloves stuck in an onion, and a tomato. The latter gives a very agreeable flavour to the stock. If fried onion be added, it ought, according to the advice of a famous French chef, to be tied in a little bag : without this precaution, the colour of the stock is liable to be clouded. VII. By this time we will now suppose that you have chopped the bones which were separated from the meat, and those which were left from the roast meat of the day before. Remember, as was before pointed out, that the more these are broken, the more gelatine you will have. The best way to break them up is to pound them roughly in an iron mortar, adding, from time to time, a little water, to prevent them getting heated. It is a great saving thus to make use of the bones of meat, which, in too many English families, we fear, are entirely wasted; for it is certain, as previously stated (Xo. 102), that two ounces of bone contain as much gelatine (which is the nutritive portion of stock) as one pound of meat. In their broken state tie them up in a bag, and put them in the stock-pot; adding the gristly parts of cold meat, and ti im- mings, which can be used for no other purpose. If, to make up the weight, you have received from the butcher a piece of mutton or veal, broil it slightly over a clear fire before putting it in the stock-pot, and be very careful that it does not contract the least taste of being smoked or burnt. Vlir. Add now the Vegetables, which, to a certain extent, will stop the boiling of the stock. Wait, therefore, till it simmers well up again, then54 MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. draw it to the side of the fire^ and keep it gently simmering till it is served, preserving, as before said, your fire always the same. Cover the stock-pot well, to prevent evaporation; do not fill it up, even if you take out a little stock, unless the meat is exposed; in which case a little boiling water may be added, but only enough to cover it. After six hours' slow and gentle simmering, the stock is done; and it should not be continued on the fire, longer than is necessary, or it will tend to insipidity. Note.—It is on a good stock, or first good broth and sauce, that excellence in cookery depends. If the preparation of this basis of the culinary art is intrusted to negligent or ignorant persons, and the stock is not well skimmed, but indifferent results will be obtained. The stock will never be clear; and when it is obliged to be clarified, it is deteriorated both in quality and flavour. In the proper management of the stock-pot an immense deal of trouble is saved, inasmuch as one stock, in a small dinner, serves for all purposes. Above all things, the greatest economy, consistent with excellence, should be practised, and the price of everything which enters the kitchen correctly ascertained. The theory of this part of Household Management may appear trifling; but its practice is extensive, and therefore it requires the best attention.RECIPES, CHAPTER YI. FBUIT AND VEGETABLE SOUPS.

As a general rule, the process of browning is to be discouraged, as apt to impart a slightly unpleasant flavour to the stock, and, consequently, all soups made from it. TO CLARIFY STOCK. 109. Ingeedients.—The whites of 2 eggs, I pint of water, 2 quarts of stock. 3Iode.—Supposing that by some accident the soup is not quite clear, and that its quantity is 2 quarts, take the whites of 2 eggs, carefully {-separated from their yolks, whisk them well together with the v/ater, and add gradually the 2 quarts of boiling stock, still whisking. Place the soup on the fire, and when boiling and well skimmed, whisk the eggs with it till nearly boiling again ; then draw it from the fire, and ltt.it settle, until the whites of the eggs become separated. Pass liirough a fine cloth, and the soup should be clear. Kate.—The rule is, that all clear soups should be of a light straw-colour, and should not savour too strongly of the meat; and that all white or brown thick soups should have no more consistencj' than will enable them to adhere slightly to the s^DOon when hot.

Sufficient for 8 persons. The Almond-Tree.—This tree is indigenous to the northern p.irts of Asia and Africa, but it is now cultivated in Europe, especially in the south of France, Italy, and Spain. It flowers iii spring, and produces its fruit in August. Although there are two kinds of almonds, the sioeet and the hitter, they are considered as only varieties of the same species. The best sweet almonds brought to England, are called the Syrian or Jordan, and come from Malaga; the inferior qualities are brought from Valentia and Italy. Bitter almonds come prin- cipally from Magadore. Anciently, the almond was much es- teemed by the nations of the East. Jacob included it among the presents which he designed for Joseph.. The Greeks called it the Greek or Thasian nut, and the Eomans believed that by eating half a dozen of them, they were secured against drunk- enness, however deeply they might imbibe. Almonds, however, are considered as very indigestible. The hitter contain, too, principles which produce two violent poisons,—prussic acid and a kind of volatile oil. It is consequently dangerous to eat them in large quantities. Almonds pounded together with a little sugar and water, however, produce a milk similar to that which is yielded by animals. Their oil is used for making fine soap, and their cake as a cosmetic. APPLE SOUP. 111.

The Apple.—This useful fruit is mentioned in Holy Writ; and Homer describes it as valuable in his time. It was brought from the East by the Eomans, who held it in the highest estimation. Indeed, some of the citizens of the "Eternal city" distinguished certain fa- vourite apples by their names. Thus the Manlians were called after Manlius, the Claudians after Claudius, and the Appians after Appius. Others were designated after the country whence they were brought; as the Sidonians, the Epirotes, and the Greeks. The best varieties are natives of Asia, and have, by grafting them upon others, been inft-oduced into Europe. The crab, found in our hedges, is the only variety indigenous to Britain; therefore, for the introduction of other kinds we are, no doubt, indebted to the Eomans. In the time of the Saxon heptarchy, both Devon and Somerset were distinguished as the apple countrrj ; and there are still existing in Herefordshire some trees said to have been planted in the time of William the Conqueror. From that time to this, the varieties of this precious fruit have gone on increasing, and are now said to number up- wards of 1,500. It is peculiar to the temperate zone, being found neither in Lapland, nor within the tropics. The best baking apples for early use are the Colvilles; the best for autumn are the rennets and pearmains; and the best for winter and spring are russets. The best table, or eating apples, are the Margarets for early use; the Kentish codlin and summer pearmain for summer; and for autumn, winter, or spring, the Dowton, golden and other pippins, as the ribstone, with small russets. As a food, the apple cannot be considered to rank high, as more than the half of it consists of water, and the rest of its properties are not the most nourishing. It is, however, a useful adjunct to other lands of food, and, when cooked, is esteemed as slightly laxative. APPLE AIvD BLOSSOM. ARTICHOKE (JERUSALEM) SOUP. {A White Soup.) 112.

From what country it comes originally, is not tnown, but it was cultivated \l in the earHest ages of antiquity, as the Egyptians were afflicted with the y loss of it in the ear, in the time of Moses. It was a favourite grain with ' the Athenians, but it was esteemed as an ignominious food by the Eomans. i^^otwithstanding this, however, it was much used by them, as it was in former times by the English, and still is, in the Border counties, in Corn- wall, and also in Wales. In other parts of England, it is used mostly for malting purposes. It is less nutritive than wheat; and in 100 parts, has of starch 79, gluten 6, saccharine matter 7, husk 8. It is, however, a lighter and less stimulating food than wheat, which renders a decoction of it well adai)ted for invahds whose digestion is weak. BBEAD SOUP, {Economical.) 117.

Beead.—-The origin of bread is involved in the obscurity of distant ages. The Greeks attributed its invention to Pan; but before they, themselves, had an existence, it was, o doubt, in use among the primitive nations of mankind. The Chaldeans and the Egyptia is were acquainted with it, and Sarah, the companion of Abraham, mixed flour and water together, kneaded it, and covered it with ashes on the hearth. The Scriptures inform us that leavened bread was known to the Israelites, but it is not known when the art of fermenting it was discovered. It is said that the Komaus learnt it during their wars with Perseus, king of Macedon, and that it was introduced to the " imperial city" abo t 200 years before the birth of Christ. Wi h them it no doubt found its way into Britain; but after their departure from the island, it probably ceased to be used. "We know that King Alfred allowed the unfermented cakes to burn in the neatherd's cottage; and that, even in the sixteenth century, unfermented cakes, kneaded by the women, were the only kind of bread known to the inhabitants of Norway and Sweden. The Itahans of this day consume the greater portion of their flour in the form of polenta, or soft pudding, vermicelli, and macaroni; and, iu the remoter districts of Scotland, much Q-UERir, OE GKiifDiNG-MiLL. unfermented bread is still used. We give a cut of the quern grinding-mill, which, towards the end of the last century, was in use in that country, and which is thus described by Dr. Johnson in his ** Journey to the Hebrides:"—"It consists of two stones about a foot and a half in diameter; the lower is a Httle convex, to which the concavity of the upper must be fitted. In the middle of the upper stone is a round hole, and on one side is a long handle. The grinder sheds the corn gradually into the hole with one hand, and works the handle round with the other. The corn slides down the convexity of the lower stone, and, by the motion of the upper, is ground in its passage." Such a primitive piece of machinery, it may safely be said, has entirely disappeared from this country.—In other parts of this work, we shall have opportunities of speaking of bread and bread-making, which, from its great and general use in the nourishment of mankind, has emphatically been called the "stajff of life." The necessity, therefore, of having it both pure and good is of the first importance. CABBAGE SOUP. 118.

The Cabbage.—It is remarkable, that although there is no country iu the world now more plentifully suppHed with fruits and vegetables than Great Britain, yet the greater number of these had no existence in it before the time of Henry VIIl. Anderson,FRUIT AND VEGETABLE SOUPS. 63 writing under tlie date of 1548, says, " The English cultivated scarcely any vegetables be* fore the last two centuries. At the commencement of the reiga of Henry VIII. neither salad, nor carrots, nor cabbages, nor radishes, nor any other comestibles of a like nature, were grown in any part of the kingdom; they came from Holland and Flanders." The original of all the cabbage tribe is the wild iDlant sea-coleworty which is to be found wasting whatever sweetness it may have on the desert air, on many of the clilTs of the south coast of England. In this state, it scarcely weighs more than half an ounce, yet, in a cultivated state, to what dimensions can it be made to grow! However greatly the whole of the tribe is esteemed among the moderns, by the ancients they were held in yet higher estimation. The Egyp- tians adored and raised altars to them, and the Greeks and Komans ascribed many of the most exalted virtues to them. Cato affirmed, that the cabbage cured aU diseases, and de- clared, that it was to its use that the Komans were enabled to live in health and without the assistance of physicians for 600 , years. It was introduced by that people into Germany, Gaul, - and, no doubt, Britain; although, in this last, it may have been suffered to pass into desuetude for some centuries. The whole tribe is m general wholesome and nutritive, and forms a valuable adjunct to animal food. CABBAGE SEEDINa. SOUP A LA CANTATBICE. {An Excellent Soup, very Beneficial for the Voice.) 119.

The Cabbot.—There is a wild carrot which grows in England; but it is white and email, and not much esteemed. The garden carrot in general use, was introduced in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, and was, at first, so highly esteemed, that the ladies wore leaves of it in tneir head-dresses. It is of great value in the culinary art, especially for soups and stews. It can be used also for beer instead of malt, and, in distillation, it yields a large quantity of spirit. The carrot is proportion- ably valuable as it has more of the red than the yellow part. There is a large red variety much used "L ""'•'^■r farmers for colouring butter. As a garden ' ' vegetable, it is what is called the orange-carrot that •• —— ■ =^ is usually cultivated. As a fattening food for cattle, TAZZA AND CABBOT LEAVES. i* is excellent; but for man it is indigestible, on account of its fibrous matter.

Note.—This soup can be made brown, instead of white, by omitting the cream, and colouring it a little. When celery cannot be procured, half a drachm of the seed, finely pounded, will give a flavour to the soup, if put in a quarter of an hour before it is done. A little of the essence of celery will answer the same purpose. Celeet.—This plant is indigenous to Britain, and, in its wild state, grows by the side of ditches and along some parts of the seaeoast. In this state itjs called smallage, and, to some extent, is a dangerous narcotic. By cultivation, however, it has been brought to the fine flavour which the garden plant possesses. In the vicinity of Manchester it is raised to an enormous size. Wnen our natural observation is assisted by the accurate results ascertained by the light of science, how infinitely does it enhance our delight in contemplating the products of nature ! To know, for example, that the end- less variety of colour which we see in plants is developed only by the rays of the sun, is to know a truism sublime by its very comprehensiveness. The cause of the whiteness of celery is nothing more than the want of light in its vegetation, and in order that this effect may be produced, the plant is almost wholly covered with earth j the tops of the leaves alone being suffered to appear above the ground.

Pahsley.—Among the Greeks, in the classic ages, a crown of parsley was awarded, both in the Nemaean and Isthmian games, and the voluptuous Anacreon pronounces this beautiful herb the emblem of joy and festivity. It has an elegant leaf, and is extensively Tised in the culinary art. When it was introduced to Britain is not known. There are several varieties,—the plain-leayed and the cicrled-le&yed, celery-parsley, Hamburg parsley, and purslane. The curled is the best, and, from the fox*m of its leaf, has a beautiful appearance on a dish as a garnish. Its flavour is, to many, very agreeable in soups ; and although to rabbits, hares, and sheep it is a luxury, to parrots it is a poison. The celery'-parsley is used as a celery, and the Hamburg is cultivated only tor its roots, which are used as parsni]ps or carrots, to eat with meat. The purslane is a native of South America, and is not now much in use. CHESTWUT (SPANISH) SOUP. 124.

The CHESTinjT.—TMs fruit is said, by some, to have originally come from Sardis, in Lydia; and by others, from Castanea, a city of Thessaly, from which it takes its name. By the ancients it was much used as a food, and is still common in France and Italy, to which countries it is, by some, considered indigenous. In the southern part of the European continent, it is eaten both raw and roasted. The tree was intro- duced into Britain by the Eomans; but it only flourishes in the warmer parts of the island, the fruit rarely arriving at maturity in Scotland. It attains a great age, as well as an immense size. As a food, it is the least oily and most farinaceous of all the nuts, and, therefore, the easiest of digestion. The tree called the horse cJiesinut is very different, although its fruit very much resembles that of the other. Its *' nuts," though eaten by horses and some other animals, are unsuitable for human food. cocoA-nsruT soup. 125.

To the natives of those climates, its bark supplies the material for erecting their dwellings ; its leaves, the means of roofing them; and the leaf-stalks, a kind of gauze for covering their windows, or protecting the baby in the cradle.

Oars are supplied by the leaves; drinking-cups, spoons, and other domestic utensils by the shells of the nuts; milk by its juice, of which, also, a kind of honey and sugar are prepared. When fermented, it furnishes the means of intoxication ; and when the fibres are burned, their ashes supply an alkali for making soap. The buds of the tree bear a striking resemblance to cabbage when boiled; but when they are cropped, the tree dies. In a fresh state, the kernel is eaten raw, and its juice is a most agreeable and refreshing beve- rage. When the nut is imported to this country, its fruit is, in general, comparatively dry, and is considered indigestible. The KWS & BLOSSOM, tree is one of the least pro- ductive of the palm tribe. SOUP A LA CBEOY. 126. Ingeediejtts.—4 carrots, 2 sliced onions, 1 cut lettuce, and chervil; 2 oz. butter, 1 pint of lentils, the crumbs of 2 French rolls, half a teacupful of rice, 2 quarts of medium stock No. lOo. Mode.—Put the vegetables with the butter in the stewpan, and let them simmer 5 minutes ; then add the lentils and 1 pint of the stock, and stew gently for half an hour. 'Now fill it up with the remainder of the stock, let it boil another hour, and put in the crumb of the rolls. When well soaked, rub all through a tammy. Have ready the rice boiled; pour the soup over this, and serve. Time.—i j hour. Average cost, Is, 2d. per quart. Seasonable all the year. Sufficient for 8 persons. The Lentil.—This belongs to the legumious or jtJwZse kind of vegetables, which rank next to the corn plants in their nutritive properties. The lentil is a variety of the bean tribe, but in Eng- land is not used as human food, although considered the best of aU kinds for pigeons. On the Continent it is cultivated for soups, as well as for other preparations for the table; and among the presents which David received from Shobi, as recounted in the Scriptures, were beans, lentils, and parched pulse. Among the Egyptians it was extensively used, and among the Greeks, the Stoics had a maxim, which declared, that " a wise man acts always with reason, and prepares his own lentils." Among the Eomans it was not much esteemed, and from them the English may have inherited a prejudice against it, on account, it is said, of its rendering men indolent. It takes its name from lentus, * slow,' and, according to Pliny, produces mildness and moderation of temper, p 268 MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. CUCUMBEB SOUP (Frencli Recipe). 127. Ingredients.—1 large cucumber, a piece of butter the size of a walnut, a little chervil and sorrel cut in large pieces salt and pepper to taste, the yolks of 2 eggs, 1 gill of cream, 1 quart of medium stock N"o. 105. jyfocZe.—Pare the cucumber, quarter it, and take out the seeds; cut it in thin slices, put these on a plate with a little salt, to draw the water from them; drain, and put them in your stewpan, with the butter. When they are warmed through, without being browned, pour the stock on them. Add the sorrel, chervil, and seasoning, and boil for 40 minutes. Mix the well-beaten yolks of the eggs with the cream, which add at the moment of serving. Time.—1 hour. Avei^age cost, Is. 2d. per quart. Seasonable from June to September. Sufficient for 4 persons. The Cucumber.—The antiquity of this fruit is very great. In the sacred writings we find that the people of Israel regretted it, whilst sojourning in the desert; and at the present time, the cucumber, and other fruits of its class, form a large portion of the food of the Egyptian people. By the Eastern nations generally, as well as by the Greeks and Komans, it was greatly esteemed. Like the melon, it was originally brought from Asia by the Eomans, and in the 14th century it was common in England, although, in the time of the wars of *' the Eoses," it seems no longer to have been cultivated. It is a cold food, and of difficult digestion when eaten raw. As a preserved sweetmeat, however, it is esteemed one of the most agreeable. Eaa SOUP. 128.

SoRBEL.—This is one of the spinaceous plants, which take their name from spinach, which is the chief among them. It is little used in English cookery, but a great deal in French, in which it is employed for soups, sauces, and salads. In English meadows it is ■usually left to grow wild j but in France, where it is cultivated, its flavour is greatly improved. KALE BBOSE (a Scotch Recipe). 132.

Put the fowl into the stock, with, at first, one half of the leeks, and allow it to simmer gently. In half an. hour add the remaining leeks, and then it may simmer for 3 or 4 hours longer. It should be carefully skimmed, and can be seasoned to taste. In serving, take out the fowl, and carve it neatly, placing the pieces in a tureen, and pouring over them the soup, which should be very thick of leeks (a xmree of leeks the French would call it). Time.—4: hours. Average cost, Is. 6d. per quart; or, with stock No. 106, Is. Seasonahh in winter. Sufficient for 10 persons. Note.—^Without the fowl, the above^ which would then be merely called leek soup;, is very good, and also economical. Cock-a-leekie was largely consumed at the Burns Centenary Festival at the Crystal Palace^ Sydenham, in 1859. The Leek.—As in the case of the cucumber, this vegetable was bewailed by the Israelites in their journey through the desert. It is one of the alliaceous tribe, which consists of the onion, garlic, chive, shallot, and leek. These, as articles of food, are perhaps more widely diffused over the face of the earth than any other genus of edible plants. It is the national badge of the Welsh, and tradition ascribes to St. David its introduction to that part of Britain. The oi'igin of the wearing of the leek on St. David's day, among that people, is thus given in " Beeton's Dictionary of Uni- VEESAL Information:"—"It probably originated from the cus- tom of CyTiihortha, or the friendly aid, practised among farmers. In some districts of South Wales, aU the neighbours of a small farmer were wont to appoint a day when they attended to plough his land, and the hke; and, at such time, it was the custom for each to bring his portion of leeks with him for making the broth or soup." {See St. David.) Others derive the origin of the custom from the battle of Cressy. The plant, when grown in Wales and Scotland, is sharper than it is in England, and its flavour is preferred by many to that of the onion in broth. It is very wholesome, and, to prevent its tainting the breath, should be well boiled. MACABONI SOUP. 135. Ingrediekts.—3 oz. of macaroni, a piece of butter the size of a walnut, salt to taste, 2 quarts of clear stock No. 105.

The crowd of Naples consists in a general tide rolling up and down, and in the middle of this tide, a hundred eddies of men. You are stopped by a carpenter's bench, you are lost among shoemakers' stalls, and you dash among the pots of a macaroni stall." This article of food ia nothing more than a thick paste, made of the best wheaten flour, with a small quantity of water. When it has been well worked, it is put into a hollow cylindrical vessel, pierced with holes ot the size of tobacco-pipes at the bottom. Through these holes the mass is forced by a powerful screw bearing on a piece of wood made exactly to tit the inside of the cylinder. Whilst issuing irom the holes, it is partially baked by a fire placed below the cylinder, and is, at the same time, drawn away and hung over rods placed about the room, in order to dry. In a few days it is tit for use. MACABONI. both wholesome and nutritious, it ought to be much more used by all classes in England than it is. It generally ac- companies Parmesan cheese to the tables of the rich, but is also used for thickening soups and making puddings. SOUP MAIGBB (i.e. without Meat). 136.

Seasonable all the year. Sufficient for 8 persons. The Lettuce.—This is one of the acetarious vegetables, which comprise a large class, chiefly used as pickles, salads, and other condiments. The lettuce has in all antiquity been distinguished as a kitchen-garden plant. It was, without preparation, eaten by the Hebrews with the Paschal lamb; the Greeks delighted in it, and the Komans, in the time of Domitian, had it prepared with eggs, and served in tne first course at their tables, merely to excite their appetites. Its botanical name is Lactuca, so called from the milky juice it exudes when its stalks are cut. It possesses a narcotic virtue, noticed by ancient physicians; and even in our day a lettuce supper is deemed conducive to repose. Its proper character, however, is that of a cooling summer vegetable, not very LETTUCE, nutritive, but serving as a corrective, or diluent of animal food. MILK SOUP (a Nice Dish for Children). 137.

Thicken with butter and flour, and serve. Time.—2 hours. Average cost, id. per quart. Seasonable in winter. Sufficient for 8 persons. The Onion.—Like the cabbage, this plant was erected into an object of worship by the idolatrous Egyptians 2,000 years before the Christian era, and it still forms a favourite food in the country of these people, as well as in other parts of Africa. When it was first introduced to England, has not been ascertained; but it has long been in use, and esteemed as a favourite seasoning plant to various dishes. In warmer climates it is much milder in its flavour; and such as are grown in Spain and Portugal, are, comparatively speaking, very large, and are often eaten both in a onion. boiled and roasted state. The Strasburg is the most esteemed; and, although all the species have highly nutritive properties, they impart such a disagreeable odour to the breath, that they are often rejected even where they are liked. Chewing a little raw parsley is said to remove this odour. PAW KAIL. 140.

Sufficient for 4 persons. The Paesnip.—This is a biennial plant, with a root like a carrot, which, in nutritiv-e and saccharine matter, it nearly equals. It is a native of Britain, and, in its wild state, may be found, in many parts, growing by the road-sides. It is also to be found, generally distributed over Europe; and, in Catholic countries, is mostly used with salt fish, in Lent. In Scotland it forms an excellent dish, when beat up with butter and potatoes; it is, also, excellent when fried. In Ireland it is found to yield, in conjunction with the hop, a pleasant beverage; and it contains as much spirit as the carrot, and makes an excellent wine. Its proportion of nutritive matter is 99 parts in 1,000 j 9 being mucilage and 90 sugar. PEA SOUP (QBEEIT). 142.

Seasonable all the year round, but more suitable for cold weather. Sufficient for 12 persons. The Pea.—It is supposed that the common gray pea, found wild in Greece, and other parts of the Levant, is the original of the common garden pea, and of all the domestic varieties belong- ing to it. The gray, or field pea, called hisallie by the French, is less subject to run into varieties than the garden kinds, and is considered by some, per- haps on that account, to be the wild plant, retaining still a large proportion of its original habit. From the tendency of aU other varieties "to run av/ay" and become different to vihat they originally were, it is very difficult to determine the races to wliich they belong. The pea was well knovsoi to the Eomans, and, probably, was introduced to Britain at an early period; for we find peas mentioned by Lydgate, a poet of the 15th century, as being hawked in London. They seem, however, for a considerable time, to have fallen out of use; for, in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, Fuller teUs us they were brought from Holland, and were accounted " fit dainties for ladies, they came so far and cost so dear." There are some varieties of peas which have no hning in their pods, which are eaten cooked in the same way as kidney- beans. They are called sugar peas, and the best variety is the large crooked sugar, which is also very good, used in the common way, as a culinary vege- table. There is also a white sort, which readily sphts when subjected to the action of millstones set vvide apart, so as not to grind them. These are used largely for soups, and especially for sea-stores. From the quantity of farinaceous and saccharine matter contained in the pea, it is highly nutritious as an article of food.MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. 76 PEA SOUP (inexpensive). 144.

The Potato.—Humboldt doubted whether this root was a native of South America; but it has been found growing wild both in Chili and Buenos Ayres. It was first brought to Spain from the neighbourhood of Quito, in the early part of the sixteenth century, first to England from Virginia, in 1586, and first planted by Sir Walter Ealeigh, on his estate of Youghal, near Cork, in Ireland. Thence it was brought and planted in Lancashire, in England, and was, at first, recommended to be eaten as a delicate dish, and not as common food. This was in 1587.

The Peince op Wales.—This soup was invented by a philanthropic friend of the Editress, to be distributed among the poor of a considerable village, when the Prince of Wales attained his majority, on the 9th November, 1859. Accompanying this fact, the following notice, which appears in " Beeton's Dictionaetop Univeksal Informa- tion," may appropriately be introduced, premising that British princes attain their majority in their 18th year, whilst mortals of ordinary rank do not arrive at that period till their 21st.—" Albeet Edwaed, Prince of Wales, and heir to the British throne, merits a place in this work on account of the high responsibilities which he is, in all pro- babiHty, destined to fulfil as sovereign of the British empire. On the 10th of November, 1858, he was gazetted as having been invested with the rank of a colonel in the army. Speaking of this circumstance, the Times said,—* The significance of this event is, that it marks the period when the heir to the British throne is about to take rank amongMODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. 78 men, and to enter formally upon a career, whicli every loyal subject of the queen will pray may be a long and a happy one, for his own sake and for the sake of the vast empire which, in the course of nature, he v/ill one day be called to govern.

Sufficient for 8 persons. Rice.—This is a plant of Indian origin, and has formed the principal food of the Indian and Chinese people from the most remote antiquity. Both Pliny and Dioscorides class it with the cereals, though Galen places it among the vegetables. Be this as it may, however, it was imported to Greece, from India, about 283 years before Christ, and by the ancients it was esteemed both nutritious and fattening. There are three kinds of rice,—the Hill rice, the Patna, and the Carolina, of the United States. Of these, only the two latter are imported to this country, and the Carohna is considered the best, as it is the dearest. The nourishing pro- EAES 01' EicE. perties of rice are greatly inferior to those of wheat; but it is both a light and a wholesome food. In combination with other foods, its nutritive qua,lities are greatly increased; but from its having little stimulating power, it is apt, when taken in large quantities alone, to lie long on the stomach,.7^ FRUIT AND VEGETABLE SOUPS.

Note.—The yolks of 2 eggs_, beaten up with a little cream, previously boiled, and added at the moment of serving, much improves this soup. Sago.—The farinaceous food of this name con- stitutes the pith of the Sago tree (the Sagusfari' nifera of Linnaeus), which grows spontaneously in the East Indies and in the archipelago of the Indian Ocean. There it forms the principal farinaceous diet of the inhabitants. In order to procure it, the tree is felled and sawn in pieces. The inth. is then taken out, and x^ut in receptacles of cald water, where it is stirred until the flour separates from the filaments, and sinks to the bottom, where it is suffered to remain until the water is poured olf, when it is taken out and spread on wicker frames to dry. To give it the round granular form in which we find it come to this country, it is passed through a colander, then rubbed into little balls, and drigd. The tree is not fit for felling until it has attained a growth of seyen years, when a single -.. trunk will yield 600 lbs. weight; and, as an acre of SAGO palm. ground will grow 430 of these trees, a large return of flour is the result. The best quality has a slightly reddish hue, and easily dissolves to a jelly, in hot water. As a restorative diet, it is much uised. SEMOLIETA SOUP. 153. Ikgeedients.—5 oz. of semolina, 2 quarts of boiling stock, " No. 105, or 106.80 MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. Mode.—Drop the semolina into the boiling stock, and keep stirring, to prevent its burning.

Time.—1 hour. Average cost, Is. dd. per quart. Seasonable all the 3'ear. Sufficient for 8 persons. Note.—This receipe was communicated to the Editress by an English gentle- man, who was present at the battle of Solferino, on June 24, 1859, and who was requested by some of Victor Emmanuel's troops, on the day before the battle, to partake of a portion of their potage. He willingly enough consented, and found that these clever campaigners had made a most palatable dish from very easily-procured materials. In sending the recipe for insertion in this work, he has, however, Anglicised, and somewhat, he thinks, improved it. SPIIsrACH SOUP (Frencli Becipe). 155. Ingredients.—As much spinach as, when boiled, will half fill a vegetable-dish, 2 quarts of very clear medium stock, No. 105.

SpiifAcn.—This plant was unknown by the ancients, although it was cultivated in the monastic gardens of the continent in the middle of the 14th century. Some say, that it was originalh' ePi^TACH. brought from Spain; but there is a wild species growing in England, and cultivated in Lincohishire, in preference to the other. There are thno varieties in use; the round-leaved, the triangiUar-leaved, and'HI FRUIT AND VEGETABLE SOUPS. Flanders spinach, known by its large leaves.

It is, by washing, procured »s a starch Irom the tree, then dried, either in the sun or on plates of hot iron, and afterwards broken into grains, in which form it is imported into this country. Its nutritive pro- perties are larg-,, and as a food for persons of delicate digestion, or for children, it is in great estimation. "No amylaceous substance," says Dr. Christison, is so much relished by infants about the time of weaning; and in them it is less apt to become sour during digestion than any other farinaceous food, even arrowroot not excepted." TURNIP SOUP. 157.

Tke ruRNiP.—Although turnips grow wild in England, they arc not the original of the cultivated vegetable made use of in this country. In ancient times they were grown for cattle by the Eomans, and in Germany and the Low Countries they have from time immemorial been raised for the same purpose. In their cultivated state, they are generally supposed to have been intro- duced to England from Hanover, in the time of George 1.; but this has been doubted, as (xeorge II. caused a description of the Norfolk system to be sent to his flanoverian subjects, for their enlightenment in the art of turnip culture. As a culinary vegetable, it is excellent, whether eaten alone, mashed, or mixed with soups and itews. Its nutritious matter, however, is small, being only 42 parts in 1,000.

Note.—The above recipe was used in the winter of 1858 by the Editress, who made, each week, in her copper, 8 or 9 gallons of this soup, for distribu- tion amongst about a dozen families of the village near which she lives. The cost, as will be seen, was not great; but she has reason to believe that the soup was very much liked, and gave to the members of those families, a dish of warm, comforting food, in place of the cold meat and piece of bread which form, with too many cottagers, their usual meal, when, with a little more knowledge of the cooking" art, they might have, for less expense, a warm dish every day.

The coM3i02T llAEE.-.This little animal is found througliout Europe, and, indeed, in most of the northern parts of the world; and as it is desti- tute of natural weapons of defence, Providence has endowed it with an extraordinary amount of the passion of fear. As if to awaken the vigilance of this passion, too. He has fur- nished it with long and tubular ears, in order that it may catch the remotest sounds; and with full, prominent eyes, which enable it to see, at one and the same time, both before and behind it. The hare feeds in the evenings, and sleeps, ; in its form, during the day; and, as it generally lies on the ' ground, its feet, both below and above, are protected with a thick covering of hair. Its flesh, though esteemed by the r llomans, was forbidden by the Druids and by the earlier Uritons. It is now, though vei'y dark and dry, and devoid of fat, much esteemed by Europeans, on account of the peculiarity of its flavour. In purcnasing this animal, it ought to be remembered that both hares and rabbits, when old, have their claws rugged and blunt, their haunches thick, and their ears dry and tough. The ears of a young hare easily tear, and it has a narrow cleft in the lip; whilst its claws are both smooth and sharp. HESSIAN SOUP.

Vegetable Mullagatawny is made with veal stock, by boiling and pulping chopped vegetable marrow, cucumbers, onions^ and tomatoes, and seasoning with curry powder and cayenne. Nice pieces of meat, good curry powder, and strong stock, are necessary to make this soup good. CoKiAKDEE.—This plant, which largely enters into the compo- sition of curry powder with turmeric, originally comes from the East; but it has long been cultivated in England, especially in Essex, where it is reared for the use of confectioners and druggists. In private gardens, it is cultivated for the sake of its tender leaves, which are highly aromatic, and are employed in soups and salads. Its seeds are used in large quantities for the purposes of distillation. A GOOD MUTTOlSr SOUP. 175. Ingkedie^jts.—A neck of mutton about 5 or 6 lbs., 3 carrots, 3 turnips, 2 onions, a large bunch of sweet herbs, including parsley ; salt and pepper to taste; a litte sherry, if liked; 3 quarts of water.

Ti7ne.—i5 hours. Average cost, including the meat, Is. 3c?. per quart. Seasonable at any time. Sufficient for 8 persons. The Sheep.—This animal formed tlie principal riches of the patriarchs, in tlie days of old, and, no doubt, multiplied, until its species were spread over the greater part of Western Asia; but at what period it was introduced to Britain is not known. It is now found in almost every part of the globe, although, as a domestic animal, it depends almost entirely upon man for its support. Its value, however, amply repays him for whatever care and kindness he may bestow upon it; for, like the ox, there ia scarcely a part of it that he cannot convert to some useful purpose. The fleece, which serves it for a covering, is appropriated by man, to serve the same end to himself, whilst its skin is also applied to various purposes in civilized lile. Its entrails are used as strings for musical instruments, and its bones are calcined, and employed as tests in the trade of the refiner. Its milk, being thicker than that of the cow, yields a greater quantity of butter and cheese, and its liesh is among the most wholesome and nutritive that can be eaten. Thomson has beautifully described the appearance of the sheep, when bound to undergo the operation of being shorn of its wool. " Behold, where bound, and of its robe bereft By needy man, that all-depending lord, How meek, how patient, the mild creature lies ! What softness in his melancholy face. What dumb complaining innocence appears l" OX-CHEEK SOUP. 176. IKGEEDIENTS.—An ox-cheek, 2 oz. of butter, 3 or 4 slices of lean ham or bacon, 1 parsnip, 3 carrots, 2 onions, 3 heads of celery, 3 blades of mace, 4 cloves, a faggot of savoury herbs, 1 bay-leaf, a tea- spoonful of salt, half that of pepper, 1 head of celery, browning, the crust of a French roll, 5 quarts of water, 3Iode,—Lay the ham in the bottom of the stewpan, with the butter; break the bones of the cheek, wash it clean, and put it on the ham. Cut the vegetables small, add them to the other ingredients, and set the whole over a slow fire for J of an hour. Now put in the water, and simmer gently till it is reduced to 4 quarts ; take out the fleshy part of the cheek, and strain the soup into a clean stewpan; thicken with flour, put in a head of sliced celery, and simmer till the celery is tender. If not a good colour, use a little browning. Cut the meat into small square pieces, pour the soup over, and serve with the crust of a French roll in the tureen. A glass of sherry much improves this soup. Time.—S to 4 hours. Average cost, Sd. per quart. Seasonable in winter.92 MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKELY. The Ox.—Of the quadrupedal animals, the flesh of those that feed upon herbs is tho most wholesome and nutritious for human food. In the early ages, the ox was used as a religious sacrifice, and, in the eyes of the Egyptians was deemed so sacred as to bo worthy of exaltation to represent Taurus, one of the twelve signs of the zodiac. To this day, the Hindoos venerate the cow, whose flesh is forbidden to be eaten, and whose fat, supposed to have been employed to grease thecartridgesof the Indian army, was one of tho proximate causes of the great Sepoy rebellion of 1857. There are no animals of greater use to man than the tribe to which the ox belongs. There is hardly a part of them that does not enter into some of the arts and purposes of civilized Mfe. Of their horns are made combs, knife-handles, boxes, spoons, and drinking-cups. They are also made into transparent plates for lanterns; an invention ascribed, in England, to King Alfred. Glue is made from their gristles, cartilages, and portions of their hides. Their bones often form a substitute for ivory; their skins, when calves, are manufactured into vellum; their blood is the basis of Prussian blue ; their sinews furnish hue and strong threads, used by saddlers ; their hair enters into various manufactures ; their tallow is made into candles; their flesh is eaten, and the utility of tho milk and cream of the cow is well known. OX-TAIL SOXTP. 177. Ingredients.—2 ox-tails, 2 slices of ham, 1 oz. of butter, 2 carrots, 2 turnips, 3 onions, 1 leek, 1 head of celery, 1 bunch of savoury herbs, 1 bay-leaf, 12 whole peppercorns, 4 cloves, a table- spoonful of salt, 2 tablespoonfuls of ketchup, | glass of port wine, S quarts of water. Mode.—Cut up the tails, separating them at the joints; wash them, and put them in a stewpan, with the butter. Cut the vegetables in slices, and add them, with the peppercorns and herbs. Put in I pint of water, and stir it over a sharp fire till the juices are drawn. Fill up the stewpan with the water, and, when boiling, add the salt. Skim well, and simmer very gently for 4 hours, or until the tails are tender. Take them out, skim and strain the soup, thicken with flour, and flavour with the ketchup and port wine. Put back the tails, simmer for 5 minutes, and serve. Time—i^ hours. Average cost. Is. Zd, per quart. Seasonable in winter. Sufficient for 10 persons. PABTBIDGE SOUP. 178.

It became known to the Greeks and Romans, whose tables it helped to fui'nish with food. Formerly, the lied was scarce in Italy, but its place was supplied by the White, which, at considerable expense, was frequently procured from the Alps. The Athenians trained this bird for fighting, and Severus used to lighten the cares of royalty by witnessing the spirit of its combats. The Greeks esteemed its leg most highly, and rejected the other por- tions as unfashionable to be eaten. The Romans, however, ventured a little further, and ate the breast, whilst we consider the bird as wholly palatable. It is an inhabitant of all the temperate countries of Europe, but, on account of the geniality of the climate, it abounds most in the Ukraine. PHEASANT SOUP. 179. Ingeedients.-~2 pheasants, \ lb. of butter, 2 slices of ham, 2 large onions sliced, f head of celery, the crumb of two Frencli rolls, the yolks of 2 eggs boiled hard, salt and cayenne to taste, a little pounded mace, if liked; 3 quarts of stock No. 105. 3Iode.—Qut up the pheasants, flour and braise them in the butter and ham till they are of a nice brown, but not burnt.

Put it into a deep dish, and set it by for a day. Have ready a stewpan of boiling water, place the dish in it, and keep it boiling ; stir occasionally, and when the soup is thick and ropy, it is done. Form it into little cakes by pouring a small quantity on to the bottom of cups or basins; when cold, turn them out on a flannel to dry. Keep them from the air in tin canisters. Average cost of this quantity, 165. Note.—Soup can be made in 5 minutes with this, by dissolving a small piece, about the size of a walnut, in a pint of warm water, and simmering for 2 minutes. Vermicelli, macaroni, or other Italian pastes, may be added. The Laueel, oe Bat.—The leaves of this tree frequently enter into the recipes of cookery; but they ought not to be used without the greatest caution, and not at all, iinless the cook is perfectly aware of their effects. It ought to be known, that there are two kinds of bay-trees,—the Classic laurel, whose leaves are comparatively harmless, and the Cherry-laurel, which is the one whose leaves are employed in cookery. They have a kernel-hke flavour, and are used in blanc-mange, puddings, custards, &c.; but, when acted upon by water, they develop prussic acid, and, therefore, but a small number of the leaves should be used at a time. KABEIT SOUP. i8i.

Put them into warm v/ater, and draw the blood ; when quite clean, put them in a stewpan, vv ith a faggot of herbs, and a teacupful, or rather more, of veal stock or water. Simmer slowly till done through, and add the 3 quarts of water, and boil for an hour. Take out the rabbit, pick the meat from the bones, covering it up to keep it white; put the bones back in the liquor, add the vegetables, and simmer for 2 hours; skim and strain, and let it cool. Now pound the meat in a mortar, with the yolks of the eggs, and the crumb of the roll previously soaked ; rub it through a tammy, and gradually add it to the strained liquor, and sim- mer for 15 minutes. Mix arrowroot or rice-flour with the cream (say 2 dessert-spoonfuls), and stir in the soup ; bring it to a boil, and serve. This soup must be very white, and instead of thickening it with arrowroot or rice-flour, vermicelli or pearl barley can be boiled ia a little stock, and put in 5 minutes before serving.99 MEAT, POULTRY, AND GAME SOUPS.

The Turkey.—The common turkey is a native of Korth America, and was thence introduced to England, in the reign of Henry VIII. According to Tusser's *' Five Hundred Points of Good Husbandry," about the year 1585 it began to form a dish at our rural Christmas feasts. " Beef, mutton, and pork, shred pies of the best, Pig, veal, goose, and capon, and turkey well dress'd, Cheese, apples, and nuts, joUy carols to hear, As then in the country is counted good cheer." It is one of the most difficult birds to rear, of any that we have; yet, in its wild state, is found in great abundance in the forests of Canada, where, it might have been imagined that the severity of the chmate would be unfavourable to its ever becoming plentiful. They are very fond of the seeds of nettles, and the seeds of the foxglove poison them, TUBTLE SOUP (founded on M. Ude's KoQipe). 189. Ingeedients.—A turtle, 6 slices of ham, 2 knuckles of veal, 1 large bunch of sweet herbs, 3 bay-leaves, parsley, green onions, 1 onion, 6 cloves, 4 blades of mace, i lb. of fresh butter, 1 bottle of Madeira, 1 lump of sugar. For the Quenelles d Tortue, 1 lb. of veal, 1 lb. of bread crumbs, milk, 7 eggs, cayenne, salt, spices, chopped parsley, the juice of 2 lemons. nMODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. 08 Mode.—To make tliis soup with less difficulty, cut olf the head of the turtle the preceding day. In the morning open the turtle by leaning heavily with a knife on the shell of the animars back, whilst you cut this off all round. Turn it upright on its end, that all the water, &c. may run out, when the flesh should be cut off along the spine, with the knife sloping towards the bones, for fear of touching the gall, which sometimes might escape the eye. "When all the flesh about the members is obtained, wash these clean, and let them drain. Have ready, on the Are, a large vessel full of boiling water, into which put the shells ; and when you perceive that they come easily off, take them out of the water, and prick them all, with those of the back, belly, fins, head, &c. Boil the back and belly till the bones can be taken off, without, however, allowing the softer parts to be sufficiently done, as they will be boiled again in the soup. When these latter come off easily, lay them on earthen dishes singly, for fear they should stick together, and put them to cool. Keep the liquor in which you have blanched the softer parts, and let the bones stew thoroughly in it, as this liquor must be used to moisten all the sauces. All the flesh of the interior parts, the four legs and head, must be drawn down in the following manner :—Lay the slices of ham on the bottom of a very large stewpan, over them the knuckles of veal, according to the size of the turtle ; then the inside flesh of the turtle, and over the whole the members. Now moisten-with the water in which you are boiling the shell, and draw it down thoroughly. It may now be ascertained if it be thoroughly done by thrusting a knife into the fleshy part of the meat. If no blood appears, it is time to moisten it again with the liquor in which the bones, &c. have been boiling. Put in a large bunch of all such sweet herbs as are used in the cooking of a turtle,—-sweet basil, sweet marjoram, lemon thyme, winter savory, 2 or 3 bay-leaves, common thyme, a handful of parsley and green onions, and a large onion stuck with 6 cloves. Let the whole be thoroughly done. With respect to the members, probe them, to see whether they are done, and if so, drain and send them to the larder, as they are to make their appearance only when the soup is absolutely completed. When the flesh is also completely done, strain it through a silk sieve, and make a very thin white roux; for turtle soup must not be much thickened. When the flour is sufficiently done on a slow fire, and has a good colour, moisten it with the liquor, keeping it over the fire till it boils. Ascertain that the sauce is neither too thick nor too thin; then draw the stewpan on the side of the stove, to skim off the white scum, and all the fat and oil that rise to the surface of the sauce. By this time all the softer parts will be sufficiently cold; when they must be cut to about99 MEAT, POULTRY, AND GAME SOUrS. the size of one or two inches square, and thrown into the soup, which must now be left to simmer gently. When done, skim off all the fat and froth. Take all the leaves of the herbs from the stock,—sweet basil, sweet marjoram, lemon thyme, winter savory, 2 or 3 bay- leaves, common thyme, a handful of parsley and green onions, and a large onion cut in four pieces, with a few blades of mace. Put these in a stewpan, with about J lb. of fresh butter, and let it simmer on a slow hre till quite melted, when pour in 1 bottle of good Madeira, adding a small bit of sugar, and let it boil gently for 1 hour. When done, rub it through a tammy, and add it to the soup. Let this boil, till no white scum rises ; then take with a skimmer all the bits of turtle out of the sauce, and put them in a clean stewpan: when you have all out, pour the soup over the bits of turtle, through a tamm^^ and proceed as follows :— duENELLES A ToETTJE.—Make somc quenelles d tortue^ which being substitutes for eggs, do not require to be very delicate. Take out the ffeshy part of a leg of veal, about 1 lb., scrape off all the meat, without leaving any sinews or fat, and soak in milk about the same quantity of crumbs of bread. When the bread is well soaked, squeeze it, and put it into a mortar, with the veal, a small quantity of calf's udder, a little butter, the yolks of 4 eggs, boiled hard, a little cayenne pepper, salt, and spices, and pound the whole very fine ; then thicken the mixture with 2 whole eggs, and the yolk of another. Next try this farce or stuffing in boiling-hot water, to ascertain its consist- ency : if it is too thin, add the yolk of an egg. When the farce is perfected, take half of it, and put into it some chopped parsley. Let the whole cool, in order to roll it of the size of the yolk of an egg; poach it in salt and boiling water, and when very hard, drain on a sieve, and put it into the turtle. Before you send up, squeeze the juice of 2 or 3 lemons, with a little cayenne pepper, and pour tha into the soup. The eins may be served as a ^:>/a^ d'entree with a little turtle sauce ; if not, on the following day you may warm the turtle au hain marie, and serve the members entire, with a matelote sauce, garnished with mushrooms, cocks' combs, quenelles, &c. When either lemon-juice or cayenne pepper has been introduced, no boiling must take place. Note,—It is necessary to observe, that the turtle prepared a day before it is used, is generally preferable^ the flavour being more uniform. Be particular, v/hen you dress a very large turtle, to preserve the green fat (be cautious not to study a very brown colour,—the natural green of the fish is preferred by every epicure and true connoisseur) in a separate stewpan, and likewise when the turtle is entirely done, to have as many tureens as you mean to serv^e each H 2100 MODEPvN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. time. You cannot put the whole in a large vessel, for many reasons : first_, it will be long in cooling ; secondly, when you take some out, it will break all the rest into rags. If you warm in a hain marie, the turtle will always retain the same taste; but if you boil it often, it becomes strong, and loses the delicacy of its flavour. The Cost or Turtle Soup.—This is the most expensive soup brought to table. It is sold by the quart,—one guinea being the standard price for that quantity. The price of live turtle ranges from ^d. to 2s. per lb., according to supply and demand. When live turtle is dear, many cooks use the tinned turtle, which is killed when caught, and preserved by being put in hermetically- sealed canisters, and so sent over to England. The cost of a tin, containing 2 quarts, or 4 lbs., is about £2, and for a small one, containing the green fat, 75. Qd, From these about 6 quarts of good soup may be made. The Geeen Turtle.—This reptile is found in large numbers on the coasts of all the islands and continents within the tropics, in both the* old and new worlds. Their length is often five feet and upwards, and they range in weight from 50 to 500 or 600 lbs. As ^^^^^^^^ turtles find a constant supply of food on the coasts which they ^^^^^K^^^^ frequent, they are not of a quarrelsome disposition, as the turtle is highly prized on account of the delicious quality of its flesh, the fat of the upper and lower shields of the animal being esteemed the richest and most delicate parts. The soup, however, is apt to disagree with weak stomachs. As an article of luxury, th© turtle has only come into fashion within the last 100 years, and some hundreds of tureena of turtle soup are served annually at the lord mayor's dinner in Guildhall. igo. Inghedients.—Hemains of a cold tongue, 2 lbs. of sliin of beef, any cold pieces of meat or beef-bones, 2 turnips, 2 carrots, 2 onions, 1 parsnip, 1 head of celery, 4 quarts of water, i teacupful of rice; salt and pepper to taste. Mode,—Put all the ingredients in a stewpan, and simmer gently for 4 hours, or until all the goodness is drawn from the meat. Strain off the soup, and let it stand to get cold. The kernels and soft parts of the tongue must be saved. When the soup is wanted for use, skim off all the fat, put in the kernels and soft parts of the tongue, slice in a small quantity of fresh carrot, turnip, and onion; stew till the vegetables are tender, and serve with toasted bread.

It is, or ought to be, manufactured by the London professional brewers, from the best pale malt, or amber and malt. Six barrels are usually drawn from one quarter of malt, with which are mixed 4 or 5 lbs. of hops. As a beverage, it is agreeable when fresh; but it is not adapted to keep long. FISH SOUPS.

In Natural History, Fishes form the fourth class in the system of Linnseus, and are described as having long under-jaws, eggs without white, organs of sense, fins for supporters, bodies covered with concave scales, gills to supply the place of lungs for respiration, and water for the natural element of their existence. Had mankind no other knowledge of animals than of such as inhabit the land and breathe their own atmosphere, they would listen with incredulous wonder, if told that there were other kinds of beings which existed only in the waters, and which would die almost as soon as they were taken from them. However strongly these facts might be attested, they would hardly believe them, without the operation of their own senses, as they would recollect the effect produced on their own bodies when immersed in water, and the impossibility of their sustaining life in it for any lengthened period of time. Experience, however, has taught them, that the "great deep" is crowded with inhabitants of various sizes, and of vastly different constructions, with modes of life entirely distinct from those which belong to the animals of the land, and with peculiarities of design, equally wonderful with those of any other works which have come fi'om the hand of the Creator. The history of these races, however, must remain for ever, more or less, in a state of darkness, since the depths in which they live, are beyond the power of human exploration, and since the illimitable expansion of their domain places them almost entirely out of the reach of human accessibilit3%106 MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. 200. In Studying the Conformation oe Fishes, we naturally concludo that they are, in every respect, well adapted to the element in which they have their existence. Their shape has a striking resemblance to the lower i:)art of a ship; and there is no doubt that the form of the fish originally suggested the form of the ship. The body is in general slender, gradually diminishing towards each of its extremities, and flattened on each of its sides. This is precisely the form of the lower part of the hull of a ship ; and it enables both the animal and the vessel, with comparative ease, to penetrate and divide the resisting medium for which they have been adapted. The velocity of a ship, however, in sailing before the wind, is by no means to be compared to that of a fish. It is well known that the largest fishes will, with the greatest ease, overtake a ship in full sail, play round it without effort, and shoot ahead of it at pleasure. This arises from their great flexibility, which, to compete with mocks the labours of art, and enables them to migrate thousands of miles in a season, without the slightest indications of languor or fatigue. 201. The principal Instruments employed by Fishes to accelerate their motion, are their air-bladder, fins, and tail. By means of the air-bladder they enlarge or diminish the specific gravity of their bodies. When they wish to sink, they compress the muscles of the abdomen, and eject the air contained in it; by which, their weight, compared with that of the water, is increased, and they consequently descend. On the other hand, when they wish to rise, they relax the compression of the abdominal muscles, when the air-bladder fills and distends, and the body immediately ascends to the surface. How simply, yet how wonderfully, has the Supreme Being adapted certain means to the attain- ment of certain ends ! Those fishes which are destitute of the air-bladder are heavy in the water, and have no great alacrity" in rising. The larger pro- portion of them remain at the bottom, unless they are so formed as to be able to strike their native element downwards with sufficient force to enable them to ascend. "When the air-bladder of a fish is burst, its power of ascending to the surface has for ever passed away. From a knowledge of this fact, the fishermen of cod are enabled to preserve them alive for a considerable time in their well-boats. The means they adopt to accomplish this, is to perforate the Hound, or air-bladder, with a needle, which disengages the air, when the fishes immediately descend to the bottom of the well, into which they are thrown. Without this operation, it would be impossible to keep the cod under water whilst they had life. In swimming, the Ji7is enable fishes to preserve their upright position, especially those of the belly, which act like two feet. Without these, they vfould svv^im with their bellies upward, as it is in their backs that the centre of gravity lies. In ascending and descending, these are likewise of great assistance, as they contract and expand accordingly. The iail is an instrument of great muscular force, and largely assists the fish in all its motions. In some instances it acts like the rudder of a ship, and enables it to turn sideways; and when moved from side to side with a quick vibratory motion, fishes are made, in the same manner as the ^^screw" propeller makes107 TKS NATURAL HISTORY OF FISHES. a steamship, to dart forward witli a celerity proportioned to the muscular force with which it is employed. 202. The Bodies of Fishes are mostly covered with a kind of horny scales ; but some are almost entirely without them, or have them so minute as to be almost invisible ; as is the case with the eel. The object of these is to preserve them from injury by the pressure of the water, or the sudden contact with pebbles, rocks, or sea-weeds. Others, again, are enveloped in a fatty, olea- ginous substance, also intended as a defence against the friction of the water ; and those in which the scales are small, are supplied with a larger quantity of slimy matter. 203. The Respiration of Fishes is effected by means of those comb-liko organs which are placed on each side of the neck, and which are called gills. It is curious to watch the process of breathing as it is performed by the finny tribes. It seems to be so continuous, that it might almost pass for sin illustra- tion of the vexed problem which conceals the secret of perpetual motion. In performing it, they fill their mouths with water, which .they drive backwards with a force so great as to open the large flap, to allow it to escape behind. In this operation all, or a great portion, of the air contained in the water, is left among the leather-like processes of the gills, and is carried into the body, there to perform its part in the animal economy. In proof of this, it has been ascertained that, if the water in which fishes are put, is, by any means, denuded of its air, they immediately seek the surface, and begin to gasp for it. HencC;, distilled water is to them what a vacuum made by an air-pump, is to most other animals. For this reason, when a fishpond, or other aqueous receptacle in which fishes are kept, is entirely frozen over, it is necessary to make holes in the ice, not so especially for the purpose of feeding them, as for that of giving them air to breathe. 204. The Positions of the Teeth of Fishes are well calculated to excite our amazement; for, in some cases, these are situatedin the jaws, some- times on the tongue or palate, and sometimes even in the throat. They are in general sharp-pointed and immovable ; but in the carp they are obtuse, and in the pike so easily moved as to seem to have no deeper hold than such as the mere skin can afford. In the herring, the tongue is set with teeth, to enable it the better, it is supposed, to retain its food. 205. Although Naturalists have DmDED Fishes into two great tribes-, the osseous and the cartilaginous, yet the distinction is not very precise ; for the first have a great deal of cartilage, and the second, at any rate, a portion of calcareous matter in their bones. It may, therefore, be said that the bones of fishes form a kind of intermediate substance between true bones and cartilages. The backbone extends through the whole length of the body, and consists ol vertebra), strong and thick towards the head, but weaker and more slender as it approaches the tail. Each species has a determinate number of vertebrra.103 MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. jyhicli are increased in size in proi^ortion witli the body. The ribs are attached ^-o the processes of the vertebra), and inclose the breast and abdomen. Some kinds, as the rays, have no ribs ; whilst others, as the sturgeon and eel, have rery short ones. Between the pointed processes of the vertebraa are situated the bones which support the dorsal (back) and the anal (below the tail) fins, which are connected with the processes by a ligament. At the breast are the sternum or breastbone, clavicles or collar-bones, and the scapulse or shoulder- blades, on which the pectoral or breast fins are placed. The bones which support the ventral or belly fins are called the ossa pelvis. Besides these prin- cipal bones, there are often other smaller ones, placed between che mascicis to assist their motion. -206. Some op the Organs op Sense in Fishes are supposed to be possessed by them in a high degree, and others much more imperfectly. Of the latter kind are the senses of touch and taste, which are believed to be very slightly developed. On the other hand, those of hearing, seeing, and smelling, are ascertained to be acute, but the first in a lesser degree than both the second and third. Their possession of an auditory organ was long doubted, and even denied by some physiologists; but it has been found placed on the sides of the skull, or in the cavity which contains the brain. It occupies a position entirely distinct and detached from the skull, and, in this respect, differs in the local disposition of the same sense in birds and quadrupeds. In some fishes, as in those of the ray kind, the organ is wholly encompassed by those parts which contain the cavity of the skull; whilst in the cod and salmon kind it is in the part within the skull. Its structure is, in every way, much more simple than that of the same sense in those animals which live entirely in the air ; but there is no doubt that they have the adaptation suitable to their condition. In some genera, as in the rays, the external orifice or ear is very small, and is placed in the upper surface of the head; whilst in others there is no visible ex- ternal orifice whatever. However perfect the sight of fishes may be, experience has shown that this sense is of much less use to them than that of smelling, in searching for their food. The optic nerves in fishes have this peculiarity,—that they are not confounded with one another in their middle progress between their origin and their orbit. The one passes over the other without any com- munication ; so that the nerve which comes from the left side of the brain goes distinctly to the right eye, and that which comes from the right goes distinctly to the left. In the greater part of them, the eye is covered with the same transparent skin that covers the rest of the head. The object of this arrange- ment, perhaps, is to defend it from the action of the water, as there are no eyelids. The globe in front is somewhat depressed, and is furnished behind with a muscle, which serves to lengthen or flatten it, according to the necessi- ties Ol the animal. The crystalline humour, which in quadrupeds is flattened, in, in fishes, nearly globular. The organ of smelling in fishes is large, and is endued, at its entry, with a dilating and contracting power, which is employed as the wants of the animal may require. It is mostly by the acuteness of their smell that fishes are enabled to discover their lood ; for their tongue is notTHE NATURAL HISTORY OP FISHES. 109 designed for nice sensation, being of too firm a cartilaginous substance foi this purpose. 207. With respect to the Food of Fishes, this is almost universally found in their own element. They are mostly carnivorous, though they seize upon almost anything that comes in their way : they even devour their ovm offspring, and manifest a particular predilection for all living creatures. Those, to which Nature has meted out mouths of the greatest capacity, would seem to pursue everything with life, and frequently engage in fierce conflicts with their prey. The animal with the largest mouth is usually the victor ; and he has no sooner conquered his foe than he devours him. Innumerable shoals of one species pursue those of another, with a ferocity which draws them from the pole to the equator, through all the varying temperatures and depths of their boundless domain. In these pursuits a scene of universal violence it the result; and many species must have become extinct, had not Nature accurately proportioned the means of escape, the production, and the numbers, to the extent and variety of the danger to which they are exposed. Hence the smaller species are not only more numerous, but more productive than the larger; whilst their instinct leads them in search of food and safety near the shores, where, from the shallowness of the waters, many of their foes are unable to follow them. 208. The Fecundity of Fishes has been the wonder of every natural philosopher whose attention has been attracted to the subject. They are in general oviparous, or egg-producing ; but there are a few, such as the eel and the blenny, which are viviparous, or produce their young alive. The males have the milt and the females the roe; but some individuals, as the sturgeon and the cod tribes, are said to contain both. The greater number deposit their spawn in the sand or gravel; but some of those which dwellin the depths of the ocean attach their eggs to sea-weeds. In every instance, however, their fruitfulness far surpasses that of any other race of animals. According to Lewenhoeck, the cod annually spawns upwards of nine millions of eggs, con- tained in a single roe. The flounder produces one million ; the mackerel above five hundred thousand ; a herring of a moderate size at least ten thousand ; a carp fourteen inches in length, according to Petit, contained two hundred and sixty-two thousand two hundred and twenty-four ; a perch deposited three hundred and eighty thousand six hundred and forty ; and a female sturgeon seven millions six hundred and fifty-three thousand two hundred. The viviparous species are by no means so prolific ; yet the blenny brings forth two or three hundred at a time, which commence sporting together round their parent the moment they have come into existence. 209. In reference to the Longevity of Fishes, it is affirmed to surpass that of all other created beings ; and it is supposed they are, to a great extent, exempted from the diseases to which the flesh of other animals is heir. In place of suffering from the rigidity of age, which is the cause of the natural110 MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY, decay of those thatlive and more and have their being" on the land, their bodies continue to grow with each succcediDg supply of food^ and the conduits of life to perform their functions unimpaired. The age of fishes has not been properly ascertained, although it is believed that the most minute of the species has a longer lease of life than man. The mode in which they die has been noted by the Rev. Mr. White, the eminent naturalist of Selbourne. As soon as the fish sickens, the head sinks lower and lower, till the animal, as it were, stands upon it. After this, as it becomes weaker, it loses its poise, till the tail turns over, when it comes to the surface, and floats with its belly upwards. The reason for its floating in this manner is on account of the body being no longer balanced by the fins of the belly, and the broad muscular back preponderating, by its own gravity, over the belly, from this latter being a cavity, and consequently hghter. 210. Fishes are either Solitary or Gregarious, and some of them migrate to great distances, and into certain rivers, to deposit their spawn. Of sea-fishes, the cod, herring, mackerel, and many others, assemble in immense shoals, and migrate through different tracts of the ocean ; but, whether con- sidered in their solitary or gregarious capacity, they are alike wonderful to all who look through Nature up to Nature's God, and consider, with due humilitj'-, yet exalted admiration, the sublime variety, beauty, power, and grandeur of His productions, as manifested in the Creation. PISH AS AjST ABTICIiS OF HUMAN FOOD. 211. As the Nutritive Properties of Fish are deemed inferior to those of what is called butchers' meat, it would appear, from all we can learn, that, in all ages, it has held only a secondary place in the estimation of those who have considered the science of gastronomy as a large element in the happiness of mankind. Among the Jews of old it was very little used, although it seems not to have been entirely interdicted, as Moses prohibited only the use of such as had neither scales nor fins. The Egyptians, however, made fish an article of diet, notwithstanding that it was rejected by their priests. Egypt, however, is not a country favourable to the production of fish, although we read of the people, when hungry, eating it raw ; of epicures among them having dried it in the sun ; and of its being salted and preserved, to serve as a repast on days of great solemnity. The modern Egyptians are, in general, extremely temperate in regard to food, lilven the richest among them take little pride, and, perhaps, experience as little delight, in the luxuries of the table. Their dishes mostly consist of pilaus, soups, and stews, prepared principally of onions, cucumbers, and other cold vegetables, mixed with a little meat cut into small pieces. On special occasions, however, a whole sheep is placed on the festive board; but during several of the hottest months of the year, the richest restrict thems>:;lves entirely to a vegetable diet. The poor are contented with a little oil or sour milk, in which they may dip their bread. ^13. Passing from Africa to Europe, we come amongst a people whoIll FISH AS AN ARTICLE 0? HUMAN FOOD. have, almost from time immemorial, occupied a high place irx the estimation of every civilized country ; yet the Greeks, in their earlier ages, made very little use of fish as an article of diet. In the eyes of the heroes of Homer it had little favour; for Menelaus complained that ''hunger pressed their digestive organs," and they had been obliged to live upon fish. Subsequently, however, fish became one of the principal articles of diet amongst the Hellenes ; and both Aristophanes and Athenseus allude to it, and even satirize their countrymen for their excessive partiality to the turbot and mullet. So infatuated were many of the Greek gastronomes with the love of fish, that some of them would h?,ve preferred death from indigestion to the relinquishment of the precious dainties with which a few of the species supplied them. Phiioxenes of Cythera was one of these. On being informed by his physician that he was going to die of indigestion, on account of the quantity he was consuming of a delicious fish, "Be it so," he calmly observed; " but before I die, let me finish the remainder." 213. The GEOGr.APniCAL Situation of Greece vs^as highly favourable for the development of a taste for the piscatory tribes ; and the skill of the Greek cooks was so great, that they could impart every variety of relish to the dish they were called upon to prepare. Athenaeus has transmitted to posterity some very important precepts upon their ingenuity in seasoning with salt, oil, and aromatics. At the present day the food of the Greeks, through the combined influence of poverty and the long fasts which their religion imposes upon them, is, to a large extent, composed of fish, accompanied with vegetables and fruit. Caviare, x^repared from the roes of sturgeons, is the national ragout, which, Hke all other fish dishes, they season with aromatic herbs. Snails dressed in garhc are also a favourite dish. 214. As THE Romans, in a great measure, took their taste in the fine arts from the Greeks, so did they, in some measure, their piscine appetites. The eel-pout and the lotas's liver were the favourite fish dishes of the Eoman epicures; whilst the red mullet was esteemed as one of the most delicate fishes that could be brought to the table. "With all the elegance, taste, and refinement of Eoman luxury, it was sometim.es promoted or accompanied by acts of great barbarity. In proof of this, the mention of the red mullet suggests the mode in which it was sometimes treated for the, to us, horrible entertainment of the fashionable in Eoman circles. It may be premised, that as England has, Eome, in her pahny days, had, her fops, who had, no doubt, through the medium of their cooks, discovered that when the scales of the red mullet were removed, the flesh presented a fine pink-colour. Having discovered this, it was further observed that at the death of the animal, this colour passed through a succession of beautiful shades, and, in order that these might be witnessed and enjoyed in theh: fullest perfection, the poor mullet was served alive in a glass vessel. 215. The love of Fish among the ancient Romans rose to a real mania. Apicius offered a prize to any one who could invent a new brine compounded of the liver of red mullets; and LucuUus had a canal cut through a mountain, in the neighbourhood of Naj^les, that fish might be the more easily transported to the gardens of his villa. Hortensius, the orator, wept over the death of a turbot which he had fed with his own hands; and the daughter of Druses adorned one that she had, with rings of gold. These were, surely, instances of misplaced affection ; but there is no accounting for tastes. It was but tho112 MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. other day that we read in the " Times'^ oi a wealthy living English hermit, who delights in the companionship of rats ! The modern Eomans are merged in the general name of Italians, who, with the exception of macaroni, have no specially characteristic article of food. 216. From Eome to Gaul is, considering the means of modern locomotion, no great way ; but the ancient sumptuary laws of that kingdom give us little information regarding the ichthyophagous propensities of its inhabitants. Louis XII. engaged six fishmongers to furnish his board with fresh-water animals, and Francis I. had twenty-two, whilst Henry the Great extended his requirements a little further, and had twenty-four. In the time of Louis XIV, the cooks had attained to such a degree of perfection in their art, that they could convert the form and flesh of the trout, pike, or carp, into the very shape and flavour of tUe most delicious game. The French long enjoyed a European reputation for their skiU and refinement in the preparing of food. In place of plain joints, French cookery delights in the marvels of what are caUed made dishes, ragouts, stews, and fricassees, in which no trace of the original materials of which they are compounded is to be found. 217. From Gaul we cross to Britain, where it has been asserted, by, at least, one authority, that the ancient inhabitants ate no fish. However this aiay be, we know that the British shores, particularly those of the North Sea, aave always been well supplied with the best kinds of fish, which we may .reasonably infer was not unknown to the inhabitants, or likely to be lost upon Uiem for the lack of knowledge as to how they tasted. By the time of Edward II., fish had, in England, become a dainty, especially the sturgeon, which was permitted to appear on no table but that of the king. In the fourteenth century, a decree of King John informs us that the people ate both seals and porpoises; whilst in the days of the Troubadours, whales were fished for and caught in the Mediterranean Sea, for the purpose of being used as human food. Whatever checks the ancient British may have had upon then* piscatory appetites, there are happily none of any great consequence upon the modern, who delight in wholesome food of every kind. Their taste is, perhaps, too much inclined to that which is accounted sohd and substantial; but they really eat more moderately, even of animal food, than either the French or the Germans. Eoast beef, or other viands cooked in the plainest manner, are, with them, a sufficient luxury; yet they delight in living ^cell, whilst it is easy to prove how largely their affections are developed by oven the prospect of a substantial cheer. In proof of this we will just observe, that if a great dinner is to be celebrated, it is not uncommon for the appointed stewards and committee to meet and have a preliminary dinner among themselves, in order to arrange the great one, and after that, to have another dinner to discharge the bill which the great one cost. This enjoyable disposition we take to form a very large item in the aggregate happiness of the nation. 218. The general Use op Fish, as an article of human food among civilized nations, we have thus sufficiently shown, and will conclude this portion of our subject with the following hints, which ought to be remembered by all those ViTho are fond of occasionally varying their dietary with a piscine dish:— I. Fish shortly before they spawn are, in general, best in condition. When the spawning is just over, they are out of season, and unfit for human food.GENERAL DIRECTIONS FOR DRESSING FISH. 113 II. When fish is out of season, it has a transparent, bluish tinge, however much it may be boiled; when it is in season, its muscles are firm, and boil white and curdy. III. As food for invalids, white fish, such as the ling-, cod, haddock, coal-fish, and whiting, are the best; flat fish, as soles, skate, turbot, and llounders, are also good. IV. Salmon, mackerel, herrings, and trout soon spoil or decompose after they are killed ; therefore, to be in perfection, they should be prejjared for the table on the day they are caught. With flat fish, this is not of such con- sequence, as they will keep longer. The turbot, for example, is improved by being kept a day or two. GENEBAIi DIBSCTIOITS FOR DBSSSIHG- FISH. 219. In Dressing Fish, of any kind, the first point to be attended to, is to see that it be perfectly clean. It is a common error to wash it too much ; as by doing so the flavour is diminished. If the fish is to be boiled, a little salt and vinegar should be put into the water, to give it firmness, after it is cleaned. Cod-fish, whiting, and haddock, are far better if a little salted, and kept a day; and if the weather be not very hot^ they will be good for two days. 220. When Fish is Cheap and Plentiful, and a larger quantity is piir chased than is immediately wanted, the overplus of such as will bear it should be potted, or pickled, or salted, and hung up ; or it may be fried, that it may serve for stewing the next day. Fresh-water fish, having frequently a muddy smell and taste, should be soaked in strong salt and water, after it has been well cleaned. If of a sufficient size, it may be scalded in salt and water, and afterwards dried and dressed. *» 221. Fish should be put into Cold Water, and set on the fire to do very gently, or the outside will break before the inner part is done. Unless the fishes are small, they should never be put into warm water; nor should water, either hot or cold, be poured on to the fish, as it is liable to break the skin : if it should be necessary to add a little water whilst the fish is cooking, it ought to be poured in gently at the side of the vessel. The fish-pl?.te may be drawn up, to see if the fish be ready, which may be known by its easily separating from the bone. It should then be immediately taken out of the water, or it will become woolly. The fish-plate should be set crossways over the kettle, to keep hot for serving, and a clean cloth over the fish, to prevent its losing its colour. 222. In Garnishing Fish, great attention is required, and plenty of parsley, I114 MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY, horseradish^ and lemon should be used. If fried parsley be used, it must be washed and picked, and thrown into fresh water. When the lard or dripping boils, throw the parsley into it immediately from the water, and instantly it will be green and crisp, and must be taken up with a slice. When v/ell done, and with very good sauce, fish is more appreciated than almost any other dish. The liver and roe, in some instances, should be placed on the dish, in order that they may be distributed in the course of serving; but to each recipe will be ap23ended the proper mode of serving and garnishing. 223. If Fish is to be Fried or Broiled, it m-ust be dried in a nice soft cloth, after it is well cleaned and washed. If for frjdng, brush it over with egg, and sprinkle it v/ith some fine crumbs of bread. If done a second time with the egg and bread, the fish will look so much the better. If required to be very nice, a sheet of white blotting-paper must be placed to receive it, that it may be free from all grease. It must also be of a beautiful colour, and all the crumbs appear distinct. Butter gives a bad colour; lard and clarified dripping are most frequently used ; but oil is the best, if the expense be no objection. The fish should be put into the lard when boiling, a,nd there should be a suffi- ciency of this to cover it. 224. Ween Fish is Broiled, it must be seasoned, floured, and laid on a very clean gridiron, which, when hot, should be rubbed with a bit of suet, to prevent the fish from sticking. It must be broiled over a very clear fire, that it may not taste smoky; and not too near, that it may not be scorched. 225. In choosing Fish, it is well to remember that it is possible it may bo fresJi, and yet not good. Under the head of each particular fish in this work, are appended rules for its choice and the months when it is in season. Nothing can be of greater consequence to a cook than to have the fish good ; as if this important course in a dinner does not give satisfaction, it is rarely that the repast goes off well.RECIPES. CHAPTER YIII. FISH. [^Nothing is more difficult than to give the average prices of Fish, inasmuch as a few heurs of bad iveather at sea loill, in the space of one day, cause such a difference in its supply, that the same fish—a turhot for instance—which r,iay le lought to-day for six or seven shillings, ivill, to-morrow, he, in the London markets, worth, perhaps, almost as many pounds. The average costs, therefore, which loill he found appended to each recipe, must he understood as about the average price for the different hinds of fish, when the marJcet is supplied upon an average, and when the various sorts are of an average size and quality. General Rule in Choosing Fish.—A proof of freshness and goodness in most fishes, is their being covered with scales ; for, if deficient in this respect, it is a sign of their being stale, or having been ill-used.'\ FKIED ANCHOVIES. 226. Ingeedieis^ts.—1 tablespoonful of oil, i a glass of wliite wine, sufficient flour to thicken; 12 anchovies. 3£ode.—Mix the oil and wine together, with sufficient flour to make them into a thickish paste; cleanse the anchovies, wipe them, dip them in the paste, and fry of a nice brown colour. 2Yme.—^ hour. Average cost for this quantity, 9c7. Seasonable all the year. Sufficient for 2 persons. The Anchovy.—In his book of " British Fishes/* Mr. Yarr ell states that "the anchovy is a common fish in the Mediterranean, from Greece to Gibraltar, and was well known to the Greeks and Eomans, by whom the liquor prepared from it, called garum, was in great estimation. Its extreme range is extended into the Black Sea. The fishing for them is carried on during the night, and lights are used with the nets. The anchovy is common on the coasts of Portugal, Spain, and France. It occurs, I have no doubt, at the Channel Islands, and has. been taken on the Hampshire coast, and in the Bris- tol Channel." Other fish, of inferior quality, but resembhng the real Gorgona anchovy, are frequently sold for it, and passed off as genuine. I2 THE AJSrCHOVT.116 MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. ANCHOVY BUTTER OR PASTE. 227. Ingredients.—2 dozen ancliovies, lib. of fresh butter. Mode.—Wash, the anchovies thoroughly; bone and dry them, and pound them in a mortar to a paste. Mix the butter gradually with them, and rub the whole through a sieve. Put it by in small pots for use, and carefully exclude the air with a bladder, as it soon changes the colour of anchovies, besides spoiling them. Average cost for this quantity, 2s. POTTED ANCHOVIES. Potted Anchovies are made in the same way, by adding pounded mace, cayenne, and nutmeg to taste. ANCHOVY TOAST. 5-28. Ingredients.—Toast 2 or 3 slices of bread, or, if wanted very savoury, fry them in clarified butter, and spread on them the paste, No. 227. Made mustard, or a few grains of cayenne, may be added to the paste before laying it on the toast. Akchovy Paste.—"When some delicate zest," says a work just issued on the adulte- rations of trade, *'is required to mate the plain English breakfast more palatable, many people are in the habit of indulging in what they imagine to be anchovies. These fish are preserved in a kind of piekling-bottle, carefully corked down, and surrounded by a red-looking liquor, resembling in appearance diluted clay. The price is moderate, one shilling only being demanded for the luxury. When these anchovies are what is termed potted, it implies that the fish have been pounded into the consistency of a paste, and then placed in flat pots, somewhat similar in shape to those used for pomatum. This paste is usually eaten spread upon toast, and is said to form an excellent boiine louche, which enables gentlemen at wine-parties to enjoy their port with redoubled gusto. Unfortunately, in six cases out often, the only portion of these preserved delicacies, that contains anything indicative of anchovies, is the paper label pasted on the bottle or pot, on which the word itself is printed. . . . All the samples of anchovy paste, analyzed by different medical men, have been found to be highly and vividly coloured with very largo quantities of bole Armenian." The anchovy itself, when imported, is of a dark dead colour, and it is to make it a bright *' handsome-looking sauce " that this red earth is used. BARBEL. 229. Ingeedients.—i pint of port wine, a saltspoonful of salt, 2 table- spoonfuls of vinegar, 2 sliced onions, a faggot of sweet herbs, nutmeg and mace to taste, the juice of a lemon, 2 anchovies; 1 or 2 barbels, according to size. Mode.—Boil the barbels in salt and water till done ; pour off some of the water, and, to the remainder, put the ingredients mentioned above. Simmer gently for i hour, or rather more, and strain. Put in the fish; heat it gradually; but do not let it boil, or it will be broken.117 risn. !ZVm^?.—Altogether 1 hour. Sufficient for 4 persons, Seasonable from September to JSTo vember. The Bahbel.—This fishtakes its namefromthe barbs or AYattels at its mouth ; and, in England, is esteemed as one of the worst of the fresh-water fish. It was, however, formerly, if not now, a favourite with the Jews, excellent cookers of fish. Others would boil with it a piece of bacon, that it might have a relish. It is to be met with from two to three or four feet long, and is said to live to a great age. From Putney upwards, in the Thames, some are found of large size 5 but they are valued only as affordin; the angle. THE BARBEL. sport to the brethren of BBILI,. 230. Ingeedients.—J lb. of salt to cacli gallon of water; a littia vinegar. 3Iode.—Clean the brill, cut off the fins, and rub it over with a little lemon-juice, to preserve its whiteness. Set the fish in sufficient cold water to cover it; throw in salt, in the above proportions, and a little vinegar, and bring it gradually to boil; simmer very gently till the fish is done, which will be in about 10 minutes ; but the time for boiling, of course, depends entirely on the size of the fish. Serve it on a hot napkin, and garnish with cut lemon, parsley, horseradish, and a little lobster coral sprinkled over the fish. Send lobster or shrimp sauce and plain melted butter to table with it. Time,—After the water boils, a small brill, 10 minutes; a large brill, 15 to 20 minutes. Average cost^ from 4s. to 8s. Seasonable from August to April. The Brill.—This fish resembles the sole, but is broader, and when large, is esteemed by many rjjjj. buill. in a scarcely less degree than the turbot, whilst it is much cheaper. It is a fine fish, and is abundant in the London market. To Choose Brill.—The flesh of this fish, like that of turbot, should be of a yellowish tint, and should be chosen on account of its thickness. If the flesh has a bkiish tint, it is not good. CODFISH. 231. Cod may be boiled whole; but a large head and shoulders aro quite sufficient for a dish, and contain all that is usually helped, because, when the thick part is done, the tail is insipid and overdone. The latter, cut in slices, makes a very good dish for frying; or it mayTHE COD. 118 MODEBN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. be salted down and served with egg sauce and parsnips. Cod, when _^^^^^^^7>_-:--. boiled quite fresh, is watery ; salting a little, renders it firmer. The Cod Tribe.—The Jugular, characterized by bony gills, and ventral fins before the pectoral ones, commences the second of the Linuaean orders of fishes, and is a numerous tribe, inhabiting only the depths of the ocean, and seldom visiting the fresh waters. They have a smooth head, and th gill membrane has seven rays. The body is oblongs and covered with deciduous scales. The fins ara all inclosed in skin, whilst their rays are unarmed. The ventral fins are slender, and terminate in g point. Their habits are gregarious, and they feed on smaller fish and other marins animals. COD'S HEAD AHD SHOUIiDEBS. 23a. Ingeedients.—Sufficient water to coyer the fish ; 5 oz. of salt to each gallon of water. Mode.—Cleanse the fish thoroughly, and rub a little salt oyer the thick part and inside of the fish, 1 or 2 hours before dressing it, as this very much improyes the flayour. Lay it in the fish-kettle, with sufiicient cold water to coyer it. Be yery particular not to pour the water on the fish, as it is liable to break it, and only keep it just simmering. If the water should boil away, add a little by pouring it in at the side of the kettle, and not on the fish. Add salt in the aboye proportion, and bring it gradually to a boil. Skim yery carefully, draw it to the side of the fire, and let it gently simmer till done. Take it out and drain it; serye on a hot napkin, and garnish with cut lemon, horseradish, the roe and liyer. {See Coloured Plate C.) Time.—According to size, f an hour, more or less. Average cost, from 3s. to 6s, Sufficient for 6 or 8 persons. Seasonable from November to March. Note.—Oyster sauce and plain melted butter should be served with this. To Choose Cod.—The cod should be chosen for the table when it is plump and round near the tail, when the hollow behind the head is deep^ and when the sides are undulated as if they were ribbed. The glutinous parts about the head lose their delicate flavour, after the fish has been twenty-four hours ■Dut of the v/ater. The great point by which the cod should be judged is the firmness of its flesh; and, although the cod is not firm when it is alive, its quality may be arrived at by pressing the finger into the flesh. If this rises immediately, the fish is good ; if not, it is stale. Another sign of its goodness iS;, if the fish, when it is cut, exhibits a bronze appearance, like the silver side of a round of beef. When this is the case, the flesh will be firm when cooked. Stiffness in a cod, or in any other fish, is a sure sign of freshness, though not always of quality. Sometimes, codfish, though exhibiting signsMODERN MODE OF SEUVIXG DISHES.FISH. 119 of rough usage, will eat much better than those with red gills, so strongly recommended by many cookery-books. This appearance is generally caused by the fish ha\Ting been knocked about at sea, in the well-boats, in which they are conveyed from the fishing-grounds to market. SALT COD, COMMONLY CALLED "SALT-FISH." 233. Ingeediekts.—Sufficient water to coyer tlie fisli. Mode,—Wash the fish, and lay it all night in water, with a \ pint of vinegar. "When thoroughly soaked, take it out, see that it is perfectly clean, and put it in the fish-kettle with sufficient cold watei to cover it. Heat it gradually, but do not let it boil much, or the fish will be hard. Skim well, and when done, drain the fish and put it on a napkin garnished with hard-boiled eggs cut in rings. Time.—About 1 hour. Average costj 6d. per lb. Seasonable in the spring. Sufficient for each person, | lb. Note.—Serve with egg sauce and parsnips. This is an especial dish on Ash- Wednesday. Preserving Cod.—Immediately as the cod are caught, their heads are cut off. They are then opened, cleaned, and salted, when they are stowed away in the hold of the vessel, in beds of five or six yards square, head to tail, with a layer of salt to each layer of fish. V^hen they have lain in this state three or four days, in order that the water may drain from them, they are shifted into a diiFerent part of the vessel, and again salted. Here they remain tiU the vessel is loaded, when they are sometimes cut into thick pieces and packed in barrels for the greater convenience of carriage. COD SOUJSTDS Should be well soaked in salt and water, and thoroughly washed before dressing them. They are considered a great delicacy, and may either be broiled, fried, or boiled: if they are boiled, mix a little milk with the water. COD SOUNDS, EKT POULB. 234. Ingeedients.—Por forcemeat, 12 chopped oysters, 3 chopped anchovies, | lb. of bread crumbs, 1 oz. of butter, 2 eggs; seasoning of salt, pepper, nutmeg, and mace to taste ; 4 cod sounds. Mode,—Make the forcemeat by mixing the ingredients well together. Wash the sounds, and boil tiiem in milk and water for I an hour; take them out and let them cool. Cover each with a layei of forcemeat, roll them up in a nice form, and skewer them. Hub over with lard, dredge with flour, and cook them gently before the fire in a Dutch oven. Time.^l hour. Average cost, 6d, per lb.120 MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. Seasonable from November to March. Sufficient for 4 persons. The Sounds in" CoDrisn.—These are the air or swimming bladders, by means of which the fishes are enabled to ascend or descend in the water. In the Newfoundland fishery they are taken out previous to incipient putrefaction, washed from their sUme and salted for exportation. The tongues are also cured and packed up in barrels; hilst, from the livers, considerable quantities of oil are extracted, this oil having been found possessed of the most nourishing properties, and particularly beneficial in cases of pulmonary afiections. O O D P I E. (^conomtcaL) I. 235. Ijn^geedients.—Any remains of cold cod, 12 oysters, sufficient melted butter to moisten it; mashed potatoes enough to fill up the dish. Mode.—Flake the fish from the bone, and carefully take away all the skin. Lay it in a pie-dish, pour over the melted butter and oysters (or oyster sauce, if there is any left), and cover with mashed potatoes. Bake for i an hour, and send to table of a nice brown colour. Time.— § hour. Seasoiiahle from November to March. II. 236. Ingeedients.—2 slices of cod; pepper and salt to taste; J a teaspoonful of grated nutmeg", 1 large blade of pounded mace, 2 oz. of butter, | pint of stock No. 107, a paste crust {see Pastry). For sauce, 1 tablespoonful of stock, J pint of cream or milk, thickening of flour or butter; lemon-peel chopped very fine to taste; 12 oysters. Mode.—Lay the cod in salt for 4 hours, then wash it and place it in a dish; season, and add the butter and stock; cover with the crust, and bake for 1 hour, or rather more. Now make the sauce, by mixing the ingredients named above; give it one boil, and pour it into the pie by a hole made at the top of the crust, which can easily be covered by a small piece of pastry cut and baked in any fanciful shape—such as a leaf, or otherwise. Time.—1| hour. Average cost, with fresh fish, 25. 6c?. Seasonable from November to March. Sufficient for 6 persons. Note.—^The remains of cold fish may be used for this pio. CUBKIED COD. 237. Ingredients.—2 slices of large cod, or the remains of any cold fish; 3 oz. of butter, 1 onion sliced, a teacupful of white stock, thick-Ffsn. 121 ening of butter and flour, 1 tablespoonful of curry-powder, J pint of cream, salt and cayenne to taste. 3fode.—¥l^ke the fish, and fry it of a nice brown colour with the butter and onions; put this in a stewpan, add the stock and thick- ening, and simmer for 10 minutes. Stir the curry-powder into the cream ; put it, with the seasoning, to the other ingredients; give one boil, and serve. Time.—% hour. Average cost^ with fresh fish, Zs, Seasonable from November to March. Sufficient for 4 persons. The Food of the Cod.—This cliiefly consists of the smaller species of the scaly tribes, shell-fish, crabs, and worms. Their voracity is very great, and they will bite at any small body they see moved by the water, even stones and pebbles, which are frequently found in their stomachs. They sometimes attain a great size, but their usual weight is from 14 to 40 lbs. COD A LA CREME. 238. Ingredients.—1 large slice of cod, 1 oz. of butter, 1 chopped shalot, a little minced parsley, ^ teacupful of white stock, J pint of milk or cream, flour to thicken, cayenne and lemon-juice to taste, 5 teaspoonful of powdered sugar. Mode—^oW. the cod, and while hot, break it into flakes; put the butter, shalot, parsley, and stock into a stewpan, and let them boil for 5 minutes. Stir in sufficient flour to thicken, and pour to it the milk or cream. Simmer for 10 minutes, add the cayenne and sugar, and, when liked, a little lemon-juice. Put the fish in the sauce to warm gradually, but do not let it boil. Serve in a dish garnished with croutons. Time.—Rather more than f hour. Average cost, with cream, 2s, Seasonable from November to March. Sufficient for 3 persons. Note.—The remains of fish from the preceding day ans^ver very well for this dish, COD A LA BECHAMEL. 239.

Mode.—Flake the cod carefully, leaving out all skin and bone; put the bechamel in a stewpan with the butter, and stir it over the fire till the latter is melted; add seasoning, put in the fish, and mix it well with the sauce. Make a border of fried bread round the dish, lay in the fish, sprinkle over with bread crumbs, and baste with122 MODERN HOUSBHOLD COOKERT. butter. Brown either before tbe fire or with a salamander, and garnish with toasted bread cut in fanciful shapes. Time.—| hour. Average cost, exclusive of the fish, Qd, The Habitat or the Cod.—This fisli is found only in tlie seas of tlie northern parts of the world, between the latitudes of 45° and 66°. Its great rendezvous are the sand- banks of l^ewfoundland, Nova Scotia, CajDe Breton, and New England. These places are its favourite resorts; for there it is able to obtain great quantities of worms, a food peculiarly grateful to it. Another cause of its attachment to these places has been said to be on account of the vicinity to the Polar seas, where it returns to spawn. Eew are taken north of Iceland, and the shoals never reach so far south as the Straits of Gibraltar. Many are taken on the coasts of Norway, in the Baltic, and off the Orkneys, which, prior to the discovery of ISTewfoundland, formed one of the pi-incipal fisheries. The London market is supplied by those taken between the Dogger Bank, the Well Bank, and Cromer, on the east coast of England. COD A IiA MAITHS D'HOTSL. 240. Ingeedients.—2 slices of cod, ^ lb. of butter, a little chopped shalot and parslej^; pepper to taste, | teaspoonful of grated nutmeg, or rather less, when the flavour is not liked ; the juice of J lemon. Mode.—Boil the cod, and either leave it whole, or, what is still better, flake it from the bone, and take off the skin. Put it into a stewpan with the butter, parsley, shalot, pepper, and nutmeg. Melt the butter gradually, and be very careful that it does not become like oil. When all is well mixed and thoroughly hot, add the lemon-juice, and serve. Time.—J hour. Average cost, 2s. 6d.; with remains of cold fish, 5d. Seasonable from !N"ovember to March, Sufficient for 4 persons. Note.—Cod that has been left will do for this. The Seasoi!T ros Fishiitg Cod.—The best season for catching cod is from the beginniug of February to the end of April; and although each fisherman engaged in taking them, catches no more than one at a time, an expert hand will sometimes take four hundred in a day. The employment is excessively fatiguing, from the weight of the fish as well as from the coldness of the climate. COD A L'lTAIiIElTNE. 241. Ikgeedients.—2 slices of crimped cod, 1 shalot, 1 slice of ham minced very fine, i pint of white stock, No. 107 ; when liked, J teacupful of cream ; salt to taste; a few drops of garlic vinegar, a little lemon-juice, f teaspoonful of powdered sugar. Jibf/e.—Chop the shalots, mince the ham very fine, pour on the stock, and simmer for 15 minutes. If the colour should not be good, add cream in the above proportion, and strain it through a fine sieve; season it, and put in the vinegar, lemon-juice, and sugar. jCTow boil the cod, take out the middle bone, and skin it; put it on the dish without breaking, and pour the sauca over it.123 FISH. Time.—| hour. Average cost, 3s. 6d.y with, fresh fish. Seasonable from November to March. Sufficient for 4 persons. TnE FEcrifiuTT op the Cod.—In our preceding remarks on the natural Iiistory of fishes, we have spoken of the amazing fruitfulness of this fish; but in this we see one more instance of the wise provision which ]N"ature has made for supplying the wants of man. So extensive has been the consumption of this fish, that it is surprising that it has not long ago become extinct; which would certainly have been the case, had it not been for its wonderful powers of reproduction. " So early as 1368," says Dr. Cloquet, **the inhabitants of Amsterdam had dispatched fishermen to the coast of Sweden ; and in the first quarter of 1792, from the ports of France only, 210 ves?els went out to the cod-fisheries. Every year, however, upwards of 10,000 vessels, of all nations, are em- ployed in this trade, and bring into the commercial world more than 40,000,000 of salted and dried cod. If we add to this immense number, the havoc made among the legions of cod by the larger scaly tribes of the great deep, and take into account the destruction to which the young are exposed by sea-fowls and other inhabitants of the seas, besides the myriads of their eggs destroyed by accident, it becomes a miracle to find that such mighty multitudes of them are still in existence, and ready to continue the exhaustless supply. Yet it ceases to excite our wonder when we remember that the female can every year give birth to more than 9,000,000 at a time." BAKED CARP. 242. Ingeedients.—1 carp, forcemeat, bread crumbs, 1 oz. butter, •| pint of stock No. 105, i pint of port wine, 6 anchovies, 2 onions sliced, 1 bay-leaf, a faggot of sweet herbs, fiour to thicken, the juice of 1 lemon; cayenne and salt to taste; | teaspoonful of powdered sugar. J/bJe.—Stuff the carp with a delicate forcemeat, after thoroughly cleansing it, and sew it up, to prevent the stuffing from falling out. Eub it over with an egg, and sprinkle it with bread crumbs, lay it in a deep earthen dish, and drop the butter, oiled, over the bread crumbs. Add the stock, onions, bay-leaf, herbs, wine, and anchovies, and bake for 1 hour. Put 1 oz. of butter into a stewpan, melt it, and dredge in sufficient flour to dry it up; put in the strained liquor from the carp, stir frequently, and when it has boiled, add the lemon-juice and seasoning. Serve the carp on a dish garnished with parsley and cut lemon, and the sauce in a boat. Time.—\\ hour. Average cost. Seldom bought. Seasonable from March to October. Sufficient for 1 or 2 persons. The Carp.—This species of fish inhabit the fresh waters, where they feed on worms, insects, aquatic plants, small fish, clay, or mould. Some of them are migratory. They have very small mouths and no teeth, and the gill membrane has three rays. The body is smooth, and generally whitish. The carp both grows and increases very fast, and is accounted the most valuable of all fish for the stocking of ponds. It has been pronounced the queen of river-fish, and was first introduced to this country about three hundred years ago. Of its sound, or air-bladder, a kind of glue is made, and a green paint of itsMODERN HOUSEHOIJD COOKERY. 124 STEWED CABP. 243. Ii^-GEEDIENTS.-—1 carp, salt, stock No. 10-5, 2 onions, 6 cloves, 12 peppercorns, 1 blade of mace, i pint of port wine, the juice of J lemon, cayenne and salt to taste, a faggot of savoury herbs. Mode.—Scale the fish, clean it nicely, and, if very large, divide it; lay it in the stewpan, after having rubbed a little salt on it, and put in sufficient stock to cover it; add the herbs, onions, and spices, and stew gently for 1 hour, or rather more, should it be very large. Dish up the fish with great care, strain the liquor, and add to it the port wine, lemon-juice, and cayenne; give one boil, pour it over the fish, and serve. Time,—\\ honr. Average cost. Seldom bought. Seasonable from March to October. JSiffficient for 1 or 2 persons. Note.—This fish can be boiled plain, and served with parslej'- and butter. Chub and Char may bo cooked in the same manner as the above, as also Dace and Roach. The Age oi' Carp.—This fish has been found to live 150 years. The pond in the garden of Emmanuel College, Cambridge, contained one that had lived there 70 years, and Gesner mentions an instance of one 100 years old. They are, besides, capable of being tamed. Dr. Smith, in his ** Tour on the Continent," says, in reference to the prince of Conde's seat at ChantiUy, *' The most pleasing things about it were the immense shoals of very large carp, silvered over with age, like silver-fish, and perfectly tame ; so that, when any passengers approached their watery habitation, they used to come to the shore in sucii numbers as to heave each other out of the water, begging for bread, of which a quantity was always kept at hand, on purpose to feed them. They would even allow themselves to be handled." THE CHXTB. TUB CHAE. The Chub.—This fish takes its name from its head, not only in England, but in othei countries. It is a river-fish, and resembles the carp, but is somewhat longer. Its flesh is not in much esteem, being coarse, and, when out of season, full of small hairy bones The head and throat are the best parts. The roe is also good. The Chae.—This is one of the most deHcious of fish, being esteemed by some superiot to the salmon. It is an inhabitant of the deep lakes of mountainous countries. Its flesh is rich and red, and full of fat. The largest and best kind is found in the lakes oi "Westmoreland, and, as it is considered a rarity, it is often potted and preserved. The Dace, or Dare.—This fish is gregarious, and is seldom above ten inches louji; although, according to Linnaeus, it grows a foot and a half in length. Its haunts are in deep water, near piles of bridges, where the stream is gentle, over gravelly, sandy, or clayey bottoms; deep holes that are shaded, water-lily leaves, and under the foam caused by an eddy. In the warm months they are to be found in shoals on the shallows near to streams. They are in season about the end of April, and graduaUy improve tillpisn. 125 February, when they attain their highest condition. In that month, when just taken, scotched (crimped), and broiled, they are said to be more palatable than a fresh herring. THE DACE. THE EOACK, The Eoach.—This fish is found throusfhout Europe, and the western parts of Asia, in deep still rivers, of which it is an inhabitant. It is rarely more than a pound and a half in weight, and is in season from September till March. It is plentiful in England, nnd the finest are caught in the Thames. The proverb, " as sound as a roach," is derived from the French name of this fish being roche, which also means rock, TO DBESS CRAB. 244. Ikgredients.—1 crab, 2 tablespoonfuls of vinegar, 1 ditto of oil; salt, white pepper, and cayenne, to taste. 3Iode.—Empty the shells, and thoroughly mix the meat with the above ingredients, and put it in the large shell. Garnish with slices of cut lemon and parsley. The quantity of oil may be increased when it is much liked. (See Coloured Plate I.) Average cost, from 10c?. to 2s. Seasonable all the year; but not so good in May, June, and July. Sufficient for 3 persons. To Choose Crab.—The middle-sizod crab is the best; and the crab^ like the lobster, should be judged by its weight; for if light, it is watery. HOT CRAB. 245. Ingredients.—1 crab, nutmeg, salt and pepper to taste, 3 oz. of butter, ^ lb. of bread crumbs, 3 tablespoonfuls of vinegar. 3Iode.—A{tev having boiled the crab, pick the meat out from the shells, and mix with it the nutmeg and seasoning. Cut up the butter in small pieces, and add the bread crumbs and vinegar. Mix altoge- ther, put the whole in the large shell, and brown before the fire or with a salamander. Time,—1 hour. Average cost, from 10c?. to 2s. Seasonahle all the year; but not so good in May, June, and July. Sufficient for 3 persons. The Crab Tribe.—The whole of this tribe of animals have the body covered Avith a hard and strong shell, and they live chiefly in the sea. Some, however, inhabit fresh12-3 MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY, waterSj and a few live upon land. They feed variously, on acjiiatic or marine plants, small iish, mollusciB, or dead bodies. The black-clawed species ia found on the rocky coasts of bioth Euro^De and India, and is the same that is introduced to our tables, being much more highly esteemed as a food than many others of the tribe. The most remarkable feature in their history, is the changing; of their shells, and the reproduction of their broken claws. I'he former occurs once a year, usually between Christ- mas and Easter, when the crabs retire to cavities in the rocks, or conceal themselves under great stones. Fishenuen say that they wiU live confined in a pot or basket for several months together, without any other food than what is col- lected from the sea-water; and that, even in this situation, they will not decrease in weight. The hermit crab is another of the species, and has the pecuharity of taking possession of the deserted shell of some other animal, as it has none of its own. This circumstance was known to the ancients, and is alluded to in the following lines from Oppian :— The hermit fish, unarm'd by Nature, left Helpless and weak, grow strong by harmless theft, Eearful they stroll, and look with panting wish Eor the cast crust of some new-cover'd fish; Or such as empty lie, and deck the shore. Whose first and rightful owners are no more. They make glad seizure of the vacant room, And count the borrow'd shell their native home; Screw their soft limbs to fit the winding case. And boldly herd with the crustaceoua race. CBAYFISH. 246. Crayfish should be thrown into boiling water, to which has been added a good seasoning of salt and a little vinegar. When done, which will be in J hour, take them out and drain them. Let them cool, arrange them on a napkin, and garnish with plenty of double parsley. Note.—This fisli is frequently used for garnishing boiled tuikey, boiled fowl, calfs head, turbot, and all kinds of boiled fish.

The Doett, or John- Dory.—This fish is of a yellowish golden colour, and is, in general, rare, although it is sometimes taken in abundance on the Devon and Cornish coasts. It is highly the jokn dory. esteemed for the table, and its flesh, when dressed, is of a beautiful clear white. When fresh caught, it is tough, and, being a ground fish, it is not the worse for being kept two, or even three days before it is cooked. BOILED EELS. 249. Ingeedients.—4 small eels, sufficient water to cover them ; a large bunch of parsley.

The Eel Tribe.—The Apodal, or bony-gilled and ventral-finned fish, of which the eel forms the first Linn^an tribe, in their general aspect and manners, approach, in some instances, very nearly j to serpents. They have a smooth head and slip- ~ pery skin, are in general naked, or covered with SHch small, soft, and distant scales, as are scarcely visible. Their bodies are long and slender, and they are supposed to subsist entirely on animal Tl - • . Chore are about nine species of them, ™e eel. mostly found in the seas. One of them frequents our fresh waters, and three of the others occasionally pay a visit to our shores. STEV7ED EELS. I. 250.

The Common Eel.—This fish is known frequently to quit its native element, and to set oir oil a wandering expedition in the night, or just about the close of dav, oyer the meadows, in search of snails and other prey. It also, sometimes, betakes itself to isolated ponds, apparently for no other pleasure than that which may be supposed to be found in a change of habitation. This, of course, accounts for eels being found in waters which were never suspected to contain them. This rambling disposition in the eel has been long known to naturalists, and, from the following lines, it seems to have been known to the ancients :— *' Thus the mail'd tortoise, and the wand'ring eel. Oft to the neighbouring beach will silent steal." n. 251. Ingeedients.—2 lbs. of middling-sized eels, 1 pint of medium stock, No. 105, I pint of port wine; salt, cayenne, and mace to taste ; 1 teaspoonful of essence of anchovy, the juice of ^ a lemon.

Note.—Garfish may be dressed like eels, aud either broiled or baked. The Peoductiveness of the Eel.—"Having occasion," says Dr. Anderson, in the Bee, to be once on a visit to a friend's house on Dee-side, in Aberdeenshire, I frequently- delighted to walk by the banks of the river. I, one day, observed something like a black string moving along the edge of the water, where it was quite shallow. Upon closer inspection, I discovered that this was a shoal of young eels, so closely joined together as to appear, on a superficial view, one continued body, moving briskly up against the stream. To avoid the retardment they experienced from the force of the current, they kept close along the water's edge the whole of the way, following all the bendings and sinuosities of the river. Where they were embayed, and in stiU water, the shoal dilated in breadth, so as to be sometimes nearly a foot broad ; but when they turned a cape, where the current was strong, they were forced to occupy less space and press close to the shore, struggling very hard till they passed it. This shoal continued to move on, night and day without interruption for several weeks. Their progress might be at the rate of about a mUe an hour. It was easy to catch the animals, though they were very active and nimble. They were eels perfectly well formed in every respect, but not exceeding two inches in length. I conceive that the shoal did not contain, on an average, less than from twelve to twenty in breadth; so that the number that passed, on the whole, must have been very great. Whence they came or whither they went, I know not; but the place where I saw this, was six miles from the sea." EEL PIE. 253.

Haunts op the Eel,—These are usually in mud, among w<;eds, under roots or stumps of trees, or in holes in the banks or the bottoms of rivers. Here they often grow to ru enormous size, sometimes weighing as much as fifteen or sixteen pounds. They seldom come forth from their luding-places except in the night; and, in winter, bury themselves deep in the mud, on account of their great susceptibility of cold. EELS A LA TABTABE. 255.

YoKACiTY 01' THE Eel.—We find in a note upon Isaac Y/alton, by Sir John Hawkifls, that lie knew of eels, when kept in ponds, frequently destroying ducks. From a canal near his house at Twickenham he himself missed many young ducks; and on draining, in order to clean it, great numbers of large eels were caught in the mud. When some of these were opened, there were found in their stomaclis the undigested heads of tho quacking tribe v^^hich had become their yictims. EELS EH MATHXiOTE. 256.

After it is slriniied and cut in pieces, the parts will con- tinue to move for a conwderable time, and no fish will live so long out of vrater. The Lampkex.—With the Eomans, this fish occupied a respectable rank among the piscine tribes, and in Britain it has at various periods stood high in pubHc favour. It was the cause of the death of Henry I. of England, who ate so much of them, that it brought on an attack of indigestion, which carried him off. It is an in- habitant of the sea, ascending rivers, principally about the end of winter, and, after passing a few months in fresh water, returning again to its oceanic resid(?nce. It is most in season in March, April, and May, but is, by some, regarded as an unwholesome food, although looked on by others as a great delicacy. They are dressed as eels. PISH AHD OYSTEH PIE. 257.

Seasonable from August to Novem- ber. The Floundee.—This comes under tlie tribe usually denominated Flat-fish, and is generally- held in the smallest estimation of any among them. It is an inhabitant of both the seas and the rivers, while it thrives in ponds. On the rLOUNDEES. English coasts it is very abundant, and the London market consumes it in largo quantities. It is considered easy of digestion, and the Thames flounder is esteemed a delicate fish. FBIED FLOUNDERS. 260. Ingiiediekts.—Flounders, egg, and bread crumbs; boiling lard. 3Iode.—Cleanse the fish, and, two hours before they are wanted, rub them inside and out with salt, to render them firm; wash and wipe them very dry, dip them into egg, and sprinkle over with bread crumbs ; fry them in boiling lard, dish on a hot napkin, and garnish with crisped parsley.

The Gtjbitet.—"If I be not ashamed of my soldiers, I am a souced gurnet," says FalstalT; the gue?^et, which shows that this fish has been long known in England. It is very common on the British coasts, and is an escelleut fish as food. BAKED HADDOCKS. 263. Ingredients.—A nice forcemeat {see Forcemeats), butter to taste, egg and bread crumbs. 3Iode.—Scale and clean the fish, without cutting it open much ; put in a nice delicate forcemeat, and sew up the slit.

THE HADDOCK. The Haddock.—This fish migrates in immense shoals, and arrives on the Yorkshire coast about the middle of winter. It is an inhabitant of the northern seas of Europe, but does not enter tho Baltic, and is not known in the Mediterranean. On each side of the body, just beyond the gills, it has a dark spot, which superstition asserts to be the impressions of the finger and thumb of St. Peter, when taking the tribute money out of a fish of this species, BOILED HADBOCK:. 264. Ikgredieuts.—SufHcient water to cover the fish; | lb. of salt to eacli gallon of water. J/o^/e.—Scrape the fish, take out the inside, wash it thoroughly, and lay it in a kettle, with enough water to coyer it, and salt in the above proportion. Simmer gently from 15 to 20 minutes, or rather more, should the :fish be very large. For small haddocks, fasten the tails in their mouths, and put them into boiling water. 10 to 15 minutes will cook them. Serve with plain melted butter, or anchovy sauce. TiVwe.-—Large haddock, | hour; small, i hour, or rather less. Average cost, from 9^7. upwards. Seasonable from August to February. Weight oI" the IDaddock.—The haddock seldom grows to any great size. In general, they do not weigh more than two or three pounds, or exceed ten or twelve inches in size. Such are esteemed very delicate eating; but they liave been caught three feet long, when their flesh is-coarse. DKIED HADDOCIC I. 265. Dried haddock should be gradually warmed through, either before or over a nice clear iire, Eub a little piece of butter over, just before sending it to table. n. 266. IxGREBiEi^TS.—1 large thick haddock, 2 bay-leaves, 1 small bunch of savoury herbs, not forgetting parsley, a little butter and pepper; boiling water. Mode,—Cut up the haddock into square pieces, make a basin hot by means of hot water, which pour out. Lay in the fish, with the bay- leaves and herbs ; cover with boiling water; put a plate over to keep in the steam, and let it remain for 10 minutes. Take out the slices, put them in a hot dish, rub over with butter and pepper, and serve. Time.—'10 minutes. Seasonable at any time, but best in winter.i35 risn. The FiSTNAiT Haddock.—This is the common haddock cured and dried, and takes its name from the fishing-village of Findhorn, near Aberdeen, in Scotland, where the art has long attained to perfection. The haddocks are there hung up for a day or two in the smoke of peat, when they are ready for cooking, and are esteemed, by the Scotch, a great dehcacy. In London, an imitation of them is made by AAashing the fish over with pyroligneous acid, and hanging it up in a.dry place for a few days. BED HEBBINGS, or TABMOUTH BLOATEBS. 267. The best way to cook these is to make incisions in the skin across the fish, because they do not then require to be so long on the fire, and will be far better than when cut open. The hard roe makes a nice relish by pounding it in a mortar, with a little anchovy, and spreading it on toast. If very dry, soak in warm v/ater 1 hour before dressing. TnE Eed HERRiNa.—"Red herrings lie twenty-four hours in the bruie, when they are taken out and hung up in a smoking-house formed to receive them. A brushwood fire is then kindled beneath them, and when they are sufficiently smoked and dried, they are p\it into barrels for carriage. BAKED WHITE HEBBOTGS. 263. Ingeediekts.~-12 herrings, 4 bay-leaves, 12 cloves, 12 allspice, 2 small blades of mace, cayenne pepper and salt to taste, sufficient vinegar to fill up the dish. Jibt^e.-—Take the herrings, cut off the heads, and gut tliem. Put them in a pie-dish, heads and tails alternately, and, between each layer, sprinkle over the above ingredients. Cover the fish with the vinegar, and bake for | hour, but do not use it till quite cold. The herrings may be cut down the front, the backbone taken out, and closed again. Sprats^ done in this way are very delicious. Time,—| an hour. Average cost^ Id. each. To Choose the Herring.—The more scale*? this fish has, the surer the sign of its freshness. It should also have a bright and silvery look; but if red about the head, it is a sign that it has been dead for some time. The Heering.—The herring tribe are found in the greatest abundance in the highest northern latitudes, where they find a quiet retreat, and security from their numerou3 enemies. Here they multiply beyond expression, . and, in shoals, come forth from their icy region to visit other portions of the great deep. In June they are found about Shetland, whence they proceed down to the Orkneys, where they divide, and surround the islands of Great Britain and Ireland. The principal British herring-fish- eries are off the Scotch and Norfolk coasts; and the fishing is always carried on by means of nets, which are usually laid at night; for, if stretched by day, they are supposed to frighten the fish liSRiii>rG. away. The moment the herring is taken out of the water it dies. Hence the origin ol the common saying, ** dead as a herring." KEGEBEE. 269. Ingeei?iekts.—Any cold fish, 1 teacupful of boiled rice, 1 oz. of butter, I teaspoonful of mustard, 2 soft-boiled eggs,' salt and cayenne to taste.136 MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. Mode,—Pick the fish carefully from the bones, mix with the other ingredients, and serve very hot. The quantities may be varied according to the amount of fish used. Time,—| hour after the rice is boiled. Average cost, 6d., exclusive of the fish. TO BOIIi LOBSTEBS. 270. Ikgredients.—J lb. of salt to each gallon of water. Jfoc7^.—Buy the lobsters alive, and choose those that are heavy and full of motion, which is an indication of their freshness. When the shell is incrusted, it is a sign they are old : medium-sized lobsters are the best. Have ready a stewpan of boiling water, salted in the above proportion; put in the lobster, and keep it boiling quickly from 20 minutes to | hour, according to its size, and do not forget to skim well. If it boils too long, the meat becomes thready, and if not done enough, the spawn is not red : this must be obviated by great attention. Rub the shell over with a little butter or sweet oil, which wipe off again. Time.—^mdll lobster, 20 minutes to § hour; large ditto, J to f hour. Average cost, medium size, Is. 6d. to 2s. 6c?. Seasonable all the year, but best from March to October. To Choose Lobsters.—This shell-fish, if it has been cooked alive, as it ought to have been, will have a stiffness in the tail, which, if gently raised, will return with a spring. Care, however, must be taken in thus proving it; for if the tail is pulled straight out, it will not return; when the fish might be pro- nounced inferior, which, in reality, may not be the case. In order to be good, lobsters should be weighty for their bulk; if light, they will be watery ; and those of the medium size, are always the best. Small-sized lobsters are cheap- est^ and answer very well for sauce. In boiling lobsters, the appearance of the shell will be much improved by rubbing over it a little butter or salad-oil on being immediately taken from the pot. Tns LonsTER.—This is one of the crab tribe, and is found on most of the rocky coasts of Great Britain. Some are caught with the hand, but the larger number in pots, which serve all the purposes of a trap, being made of osiers, and baited with garbage. Theyare shaped like a wire mousetrap ; so that when the lobsters once enter them, they cannot get out again. They are fastened to a cord and sunk in the sea, and their place marked by a buoy. The fish is very prolific, and deposits its eggs in the sand, where they are soon hatched. On the coast or Norway, they are very abundant, and it is from there that the English metropolis is mostly supplied. They are rather indigestible, and, as a food, not so nutritive as they are generally supposed to be. HOT LOBSTER. 271. Inghedients.—1 lobster, 2 oz. of butter, grated nutmeg; salt, pepper, and pounded mace, to taste; bread crumbs, 2 eggs.FISH. 137 Ifode.-—Found, the meat of the lobster to a smooth paste with the butter and seasoning, and add a few bread crumbs. Beat the eggs, and make the whole mixture into the form of a lobster; pound the spawn, and sprinkle over it. Bake j hour, and just before serving-, lay over it the tail and body shell, with the small claws underneath, to resemble a lobster. Twie.—J hour. Average cost^ 2s, Qd, Seasonahle at any time. Sufficient for 4 or 5 persons. LOBSTER SALAD. 272. Ingredients.—1 hen lobster, lettuces, endive, small salad (whatever is in season), a little chopped beetroot, 2 hard-boiled eggs, a few slices of cucumber. For dressing, equal quantities of oil and vinegar, 1 teaspoonful of made mustard, the yolks of 2 eggs; cayenne and salt to taste; ^ teaspoonful of anchovy sauce. These ingredients should be mixed perfectly smooth, and form a creamy-looking sauce. Ilode,—"Wash the salad, and thoroughly dry it by shaking it in a cloth. Cut up the lettuces and endive, pour the dressing on them, and lightly throw in the small salad. Mix all well together with the pick- ings from the body^of the lobster; pick the meat from the shell, cut it up into nice square pieces, put half in the salad, the other half reserve for garnishing. Separate the yolks from the whites of 2 hard-boiled eggs ; chop the whites very fine, and rub the yolks through a sieve, and afterwards the coral from the inside. Arrange the salad lightly on a glass dish, and garnish, first with a row of sliced cucumber, then with the pieces of lobster, the yolks and whites of the eggs, coral, and beetroot placed alternately, and arranged in small separate bunches, so that the colours contrast nicely. Average cost^ 35. Qd. Sufficient for 4 or 5 persons. Seasonable from April to October; may be had all the year, but salad is scarce and expensive in winter. X^ote.—A few crayfish make a pretty garnishing to lobster salad. The Shell op the Lobsteb.—Like the others of its tribe, the lobster annnally casts its shell. Previously to its throwing off the old one, it appears sick, languid, and restless, but in the course of a few days it is entirely invested in its new coat of armour. Whilst it is in a defenceless state, however, it seeks some lonely place, where it may lie undisturbed, and escape the horrid fate of being devoured by some of its own species who have the advantage of still being encased in their mail.

Celeeitt or the Lobstes,—In its element, tlie lobster is able to run with great speed upon its legs, or small claws, and, if alarmed, to spring, tail foremost, to a considerable distance, " even," it is said, " with the swiftness of a bird flying." Fishermen have seen some of them pass about thirty feet vsdth a wonderful degree of swiftness. When frightened, they will take their spring, and, like a chamois of the Alps, plant themselves up^n the very spot upon which they designed to hold themselves. XiOBS^TSK CUBBY (an Entree). 274.

CooKiJTG THE LoBSTEK.—"When this fish was to be served for lha table, among the ancients, it was opened len^^thwise, and filled with a gravy composed of coriander and pepper. It was then pnton the gridiron and slowly cooked, whiiit it was being basted with the same kind of gravy witli which the flesh had become impregnated. TO DBESS LOBSTEKS, 276. When the lobster is boiled, rub it over with a little salad-oil, which wipe off again; separate the body from the tail, break off the great claws, and crack them at the joints, without injuring the meat; split the tail in halves, and arrange all neatly in a dish, with the body upright in the middle, and garnish with parsley. {See Coloured Plate, H.)

Seasonahle at any time. Local Attachment op the Lobster.—It is said that the attachment of this animal is strong to some particular parts of the sea, a circumstance celebrated in the following lines:— Konght like their home the constant lobsters prize, And foreign shores and seas unknown despise. Though cruel hands the banish'd wretch expel, And force the captive from his native cell. He will, if freed, return Avith anxious care, Pind the known rock, and to his home repair; No novel customs learns in different seas.

How THE LOBSTEB Feeds.—The pincers of the lobster's large claws are furnished with nobs, and those of the other, are always serrated. With the former, it keeps firm hold of the stalks of submarine plants, and with the latter, it cuts and minces its food with great dexterity. The knobbed, or numb claw, as it is called by fishermen, is sometimes on the right and sometimes on the left, indifierently. BAKED MACKEBEI,. 279.

In the Orkneys they are seen till August; but the greatest fishery is on the west coasts of England. To Choose Mackerel.—In choosing this fish, purchasers should, to a great extent, be regulated by the brightness of its appearance. If it have a trans- parent, silvery hue, the flesh is good; but if it be red about the head, it is stale. FILLETS OF MACKEBEL. 282.

The VoEiciTY of the Mackerel.—The voracity of this fish is very great, and, from their immense numbers, they are bold in attacking objects of which they might, other- wise, be expected to have a wholesome dread. Pontoppidan relates an anecdote of a sailor belonging to a ship lying in one of the harbours on the coast of Norway, who, having gone into the sea to bathe, was suddenly missed by his companions; in the course of a few minutes, however, he was seen on the surface, with great numbers of mackerel clinging to him by then- mouths. His comrades hastened in a boat to his assistance; but when they had struck the fishes from him and got him up, they found he was so severely bitten, that he shortly afterwards expired.MODERN nOUSI^ilOLD COOKERY, flour; put in the other ingredients, and let it boil for 2 minutes.

On the following day, this was put into an earthen pot, which was uncovered, and placed in a situation to get the rays of tlie sun. At the end of two or three months, it was hermetically sealed, after having had added to it a quantity of old wine, equal to one third of the mixture. GBEY MIJLIiST. 284.

The Stbiped Eed Mullet.—This fish was very highly esteemed by the ancients, especially by the Komans, who gave the most extravagant prices for it. Those of 2 lbs. weight were valued at about £15 each; those of 4 lbs. at £Q0, and, in the reign of Tiberius, three of them were sold for £209. To witness the changing loveliness of their colour during their dying agonies, was one of the principal reasons that such a higb price was paid for one of these fishes.

The Edible Otstek.—This shell-fish is almost universally distributed near the shores of seas in all latitudes, and they especially abound on the coasts of France an^ Sritain. The coasts most celebrated, in England, for tbem, are those of Essex and Suffolk. lier^e they are dredged up by means of a net vrith an iron scraper at the mouth, tbat is dragged by a rope from a boat over the beds. As soon as taken from their native beds, they are stored in pits, formed for the iDurpose, furnished with sluices, through which, at the spring tides, the water is suffered to flow. This water, being stagnant, soon becomes green in warm weather; and, in a few days afterwards, the oysters acquire the same tinge, which increases their value in the market. They do not, however, attain their perfection and become fit for sale till the end of six or eight weeks. Oysters are not considered proper for the table till they are about a year and a half oldj so that the brood of one spring are not to be taken for sale, till, at least, the September: twelvemonth afterwarda.

The Otstee and inE Scallop.—The oyster is described as ab'valve shell-iish, having the valves generally unequal. The hinge is without teeth, but furnished with a some- what oval cavity, and mostly with lateral transverse grooves. From a similarity in the structure of the hinge, oysters and scallops have been classified as one tribe; but they differ very essentially both in their external appearance and their habits. Oysters adhere to rocks,^r, as in two or three species, to roots of trees on the shore; while tha scallops are always detached, and usually lurk in the sand.MODERN MODE OF SERVING DISHES. 1145 FISH.

The Oysteb Fishery.—The oyster fishery in Britain is esteemed of so much import- Ance, that it is regulated by a Court of Admiralty. In the mouth of May, the fishermen are allowed to take the oysters, in order to separate the spawn from the eulteh, the latter of which is thrown in again, to preserve the bed for the future. After this month, it is felony to carry away the cultch, and otherwise punishable to take any oyster, between the shells of which, when closed, a shilling will rattle. TO KEEP OYSTERS. 290. Put them in a tub, and cover them with salt and water. Let them remain for 12 hours, when they are to be taken out, and allowed to stand for another 12 hours without water.

Excellence of the Ekglish Oyster—The Frencli assert that the English oysters, which are esteemed the best in Europe, were originally procured from Cancalle Bay, near St. Malo; but they assign no proof for this. It is a fact, however, that the oysters eaten in ancient Rome were nourished in the channel which then parted the Isle oi Thanet from England, and which has since been filled up, and converted into meadows.

The Peech.—This is one of the best, as it is one of the most common, of our fresh-water fishes, and is found in nearly all the lakes and rivers in Britain and Ireland, as well as through the whole of Europe within the temperate zone. It is extremely voracious, and it has the pecu- liarity of being gregarious, which is contrary to "allf ' ■ ' the nature of all fresh-water fishes of prey. The best season to angle for it is from the beginning THE PEKCH. of May to the middle of July. Large numbers of this fish are bred in the Hampton Court and Bushy Park ponds, all of which are well supplied with running water and with plenty of food; yet they rarely attain a large size. In the Regent's Park they are also very numerous; but are seldom heavier than three quarters of a pound. FBIED PEKCH. 293. Ii^'GEEDiENTS.—Egg and bread crumbs, hot lard.

Serve with Dutch or anchovy sauce, and plain melted butter. According to size, ^ to 1 hour.—Average cost. Seldom bought. Seasonable from September to March. The Pike—THs fish is, on account of its voracity, termed tlie fresh-water shark, and is abundant in most of the European lakes, especially those of the northern parts. It grows to an immense size, some attaining to the measure of eight feet, in Lapland and Eussia. The smaller lakes, of this country and Ireland, vary in the kinds of fish they produce ; some affording trout, others pike ; and so on. Where these happen to be together, hov»*ever, the trout soon becomes extinct. " Within a short distance of Castlebar,''" says a writer on sports, "there is a small bog-lake caRed Derreens. Ten years ago it was celebrated for its numerous well-sized trouts. AccidcDtally pike effected a passage into the lake from the Minola river, and now the trouts are extinct, or, at least, none of them are caught or seen. Previous to the intrusion of the pikes, half a dozen trouts would be killed in an evening in Dorreens, wliose collective weight often amounted to twenty pounds." As an eating fiih, the pike i-s iu general dry. BAKED PIKE. 296. Ingeediekts.—1 or 2 pike, a nice delicate stuffing (se^ Force- meats), 1 egg, bread crumbs, I lb. butter.

Throw them into boiling water, salted as above, and keep them boiling for about 7 or 8 minutes. Shrimps should be done in the same way; but less time must be allowed. It may easily be known when they are done by their changing colour. Care should be taken that they are not over-boiled, as they then become tasteless and indigestible.

Bring it quickly to a boil, take off all the scum, and let it simmer gently till the fish is done, which will be when the meat separates easily from the bone. Experience alone can teach the cook to fix the time for boiling fish; but it is especially to be remembered, that it should never be under- dressed, as then nothing is more unwholesome. Neither let it remain in the kettle after it is sufficiently cooked, as that would render it insipid, watery, and colourless. Drain it, and if not wanted for a few minutes, keep it warm by means of warm cloths laid over it. Servo on a hot napkin, garnish with cut lemon and parsley, and send lobster or shrimp sauce, and plain melted butter to table with it. A dish of dressed cucumber usually accompanies this fish.

Sufficient, "a- lb., or rather less, for each person.150 .MODERN HOUSEHOLD COGKEPvY. Note.—Cut lemon should be put on the table with this fish ; and a little of the juice squeezed over it is considered by many persons a most agreeable addition. Boiled peas are also^ by some connoisseurs^ considered especially adapted to be served with salmon. To Choose Salmon.—To be good, the belly should be firm and thick, which may readily be ascertained by feehng it with the thumb and finger. The cir- cumstance of this fish having red gills, though given as a standing rule in most cookery-books, as a sign of its goodness, is not at all to be relied on, as this quality can be easily given them by art. SALMON AiMD OAPEB SAUCE. 302. Ikgeedients.—2 slices of salmon, 3; lb. butter, | teaspoonful of chopped parsley, 1 shalot; salt, pepper, and grated nutmeg to taste. Mode,—Lay the salmon in a baking-dish, place pieces of butter over it, and add the other ingredients, rubbing a little of the seasoning . into the hsh ; baste it frequently; when done, take it out and. drain for a minute or two; lay it in a clish, pour caper sauce over it, and serve. Salmon dressed in this way, with tomato sauce, is very delicious. Time.—About f hour. Average cost^ Is. Zd. per lb. Seasonable from April to August. Sufficient for 4 or 5 persons. The Migeatoey Habits of the Salmoi?". — The instinct with which the salmon revisits its native river, is one of the most curious circumstances in its natural history. As the swallow returns annually to its nest, so it returns to the same spot to deposit its ova. This fact would seem to have been repeatedly proved, M. De Lande fastened a copper ring round a salmon's tail, and found that, for three successive seasons, it returned to the same place. Dr. Bloch states that gold and silver rings have been attached by eastern princes to salmon, to prove that a communication existed between the Persian Grulf and the Caspian and iNorthern Seas, and that the experiment succeeded. COIiLABSD BALMO]^. 303. Ingeedie^s'ts.—A piece of salmon, say 3 lbs., a high seasomQg of salt, pounded mace, and pepper ; water and vinegar, 3 bay-leaves. J/oc/'e.—Split the hsh ; scale, bone, and wash it thoroughly clean ; wipe it, and rub in the seasoning inside and out; roll it up, and bind firmly ; lay it in a kettle, cover it with vinegar and water vinegar, in proportion to the water); add the bay-leaves and a good seasoning of salt and whole pepper, and simmer till done. Do not remove the lid. Serve with melted butter or anchovy sauce. For preserving the collared fish, boil up the liquor in which it was cooked, and add a little more vinegar. Pour over when cold. Time.—| hour, or rather more. Habitat op the Salmois-.—The salmon is styled by Walton the " king of fresh-water fish," and is found distributed over the north of Europe and Asia, from Britain to151 FISH. THE SALMOJT. Kamschatka, but is never found in warm latitudes, nor has it ever been caught even so far south as the Mediterranean. It lives in fresh as well as in salt waters, depositing its spawn in the former, hundreds of miles from the mouths of some of those rivers to which it has been known to resort. In 1859, great efforts were made to introduce this fish into the AustraUan colonies; and it is believed that the attempt, after many difficulties, which were very skilfully overcome, has been successful. CRIMPED SALMON". 304. Salmon is frequently dressed in this way at many fashionable tables, but must bo very fresh, and cut into slices 2 or 3 inches thick. Lay these in cold salt and water for 1 hour ; have ready some boiling water, salted, as in recipe No. 301, and well skimmed ; put in the fish, and simmer gently for J hour, or rather more ; shonld it be very thick, garnish the same as boiled salmoji, and serve with the same sauces. Time—I hour, more or less, accord- ing to size. Note.—Never use vinegar with salmon, as it spoils the taste and coloiu- of the fish. The Salmq]^ Tribe.—This is the Abdominal fish, forming the fourth of the orders of Linnaeus. They are distinguished from other fishes by having two dorsal lins, of which the hindmost is fleshy and without rays. They have teeth both on the tongue and in the jaws, whilst the body is covered with round and minutely striated scales. CUBIIIED SALMOH. 305. Ikgkebients.—Any remains of boiled sahnon, | pint of strong or medium stock (No. 105), 1 onion, 1 tablespoonful of curry-powder, 1 teaspoonful of Harvey's sauce, 1 teaspoonful of anchovy sauce, 1 oz. of butter, the juice of | lemon, cayenne and salt to taste. Mode.—Cut "up the onions into small pieces, and fry them of a pale brown in the butter; add all the ingredients but the salmon, and simmer gently till the onion is tender, occasionally stirring the contents; cut the salmon into small square pieces, carefully take away ail skin and bone, lay it in the stewpan, and let it gradually heat through ; but do not allow it to boil long. Time—I hour. Average cost, exclusive of the cold fish, 9d. Growtti op the Salmoi^.—At the latter end of the year—some as soon as ITovember— salmon begin to press up the rivers as far as they can reach, in order to deposit their spawn, which they do in the sand or gravel, about eighteen inches deep. Here it lies buried till the spring, when, about the latter end of March, it begins to exclude the young, which gradually increase to four or five inches in length, and are then termed smelts or'smouts. About the beginning of May, the river seems to be alive with them, and there is no forming an idea of their numbers without having seen them. A seasonable flood, however, comes, and hurries them to the " great deep whence, about the middle of June, they com- mence their return to the river again. By this time they are twelve or sixteen inches long, and progressively increase, both in number and size, till about the end of July, when152 MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. they have become large enough to be denominated grihe. Early in August they become fewer in numbers, but of greater size, having advanced to a weight of from six to nine pounds. This rapidity of growth appears surprising, and realizes the remark of Walton, that " the salmlet becomes a salmon in as short a time as a gosling becomes a goose." Kecent writers have, however, thrown considerable doubts on this quick growth of the ealmoDe SALMON" CUTLETS. 306. Cut the slices 1 inch thick, and season them with pepper and salt; butter a sheet of v/hite paper, lay each slice on a separate piece> with their ends twisted; broil gently over a clear fire, and servo with anchovy or caper sauce. When higher seasoning is required, add a few chopped herbs and a little spice. Time.—5 to 10 minutes. SALMOlSr A LA GEISTEVESE. 307. Ingeedients.—2 slices of salmon, 2 chopped shalots, a little parsley, a small bunch of herbs, 2 bay-leaves, 2 carrots, pounded mace, pepper and salt to taste, 4 tablespoonfuls of Madeira, J pint of white stock (No. 107), thickening of butter and flour, 1 teaspoonful of essence of anchovies, the juice of 1 lemon, cayenne and salt to taste. Mode.—Hub the bottom of a stewpan over with butter, and put in the shalots, herbs, bay-leaves, carrots, mace, and seasoning; stir them for 10 minutes over a clear fire, and add the Madeira or sherry x simmer gently for i hour, and strain through a sieve over the fish, which stew in this gravy. As soon as the fish is sufficiently cooked, take away all the liquor, except a little to keep the salmon moist, and put it into another stewpan ; add the stock, thicken with butter and flour, and put in the anchovies, lemon-juice, cayenne, and salt; lay the salmon on a hot dish, pour over it part of the sauce, and serve the remainder in a tureen. Time.—1^ hour. Average cost for this quantity, 35. 6d. Sufficient for 4 or 5 persons. PICKLED SALMON". 308. liYGEEDiENTS.—Salmon, f oz. of whole pepper, ^ oz. of whole allspice, 1 teaspoonful of salt, 2 bay-leaves, equal quantities of vinegar and the liquor in which the fish was boiled. Mode.—After the fish comes from table, lay it in a nice dish with a cover to it, as it should be excluded from the air, and take away the bone; boil the liquor and vinegar with the other ingredients for 10 minutes, and let it stand to get cold ; pour it over the salmon, and in 12 hours this will be fit for the table. Time, 10 minutes.153 FISH. To Cure Salmon.—This proeesi consists in splitting the fish, rubbing it with salt, and then putting it into pickle in tubs provided for the purpose. Here it is kept for about six weeks, when it is taken out, pressed and packed in casks, with layers of salt. POTTED SALMOIT. 309. Ingeedieists.—Salmon ; pounded mace, cloves, and pepper to taste; 3 bay-leaves, ^Ib. butter. 3fode.—Skin the salmon, and clean it thoroughly by wiping with a cloth (water would spoil it); cut it into square pieces, which rub with salt; let them remain till thoroughly drained, then lay them in a dish with the other ingredients, and bake. When quite done, drain them from the gravy, press into pots for use, and, when cold, pour over it clarified butter. Time.—| hour. Ait Aveesion m the Salmon".—The salmon is said to have an aversion to anything red ; hence, fishermen engaged in catching it do not wear jackets or caps of that colour. Pontoppidan also says, that it has an abhorrence of carrion, and if any happens to be thrown into the places it haunts, it immediately forsakes them. The remedy adopted for this in ISTorway, is to throw into the polluted Avater a lighted torch. As food, salmon, w^heu in perfection, is one of tJie most delicious and nutritive of our fish. BAKED SEA-BBEAM. 310. Ingredients.—1 bream. Seasoning to taste of salt, pepper, and cayenne ; 5 lb. of butter. 3Iode.—Well wash the bream, but do not remove the scales, and wipe away all moisture with a nice dry cloth. Season it inside and out with salt, pepper, and ca3^enne, and lay it in a baking-dish. Place the butter, in small pieces, upon the fish, and bake for rather more than i an hour. To stuff this fish before baking, vrill bo found a great improvement. Time.—Kather more than J an hour. Seasonable in summer. Note.—This fish may be broiled over a nice clear fire^ and served with a good brown gravy or white sauce, or it may bo stewed in wine. TuE Sea-Bream.—This is an abundant fish in CornAvall, and it is frequently found in the fish- market of Hastings during the summer mouths, but it is not in nauch esteem. ME. TAERELL's EECIPE. ''When gioroughly cleansed, the fish shouldbe wiped dry, but none of the scales should be taken off In this state it should be broiled, turning it often, and if the skin cracks, nour It a httle to keep the outer case entire. When on table, the whole skin and ecales turn ott without difilculty, and the muscle beneath, saturated in its own natural iuices. wiiich the outside covering has retained, will be of good flavour." THE SEA-BEEAM.154 MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. TO DBESS SHAD. 311. Ingeedients.—1 shad, oil, pepper, and salt. JfofZe.—Scale, empty and wash the fish carefully, and make two or three incisions across tlie hack. Season it with pepper and salt, and let it remain in oil for f hour. Broil it on both sides over a clear fire, and serve with caper sauce. This fish is much esteemed by the French, and by them is considered excellent. Time.—Nearly 1 hour. Average cost.—Seldom bought. Seasonable from April to June. THE SHAD. The Shad.—This is a salt-water fisli, but is lieid iu little esteem. It enters our rivers to spawn in May, and great numbers of tiiem are taken oiDposite the Isle of Dogs, in the Thames. POTTED SHBIMPS. 312. Ingredieints.—1 pint of shelled shrimps, \ lb. of fresh butter, 1 blade of pounded mace, cayenne to taste; when liked, a little nutmeg. 3Iode.—Have ready a pint of picked shrimps, and put them, with the other ingredients, into a stewpan; let them heat gradually in the butter, but do not let it boil. Pour into small pots, and when cold, cover with melted butter, and carefully exclude the air. Time.—\ hour to soak in the butter. Average cost for this quantity, Is. 3(?. BUTTERED PBAWiSTS OB SHBIMPS. 313. Ingredients.—1 pint of picked prawns or shrimps, f pint of stock No. 104, thickening of butter and flour; salt, cayenne, and nutmeg to taste. Mode.—Pick the prawns or shrimps, and put them in a stewpan with the stock ; add a thickening of butter and flour; season, and simmer gently for 3 minutes. Serve on a dish garnished with fried bread or toasted sippets. Cream sauce may be substi- tuted for the gravy. Time.—3 minutes. Average cost for this quantity, Is. id. The Shbimp.—This shell-fish is smaller than the prawn, and is greatly relished in London as a delicacy. It inhabits most of the sandy shores of Europe, and the Isle of Wi^ht is especially famous for them.155 FISH. BOILED SKATE. 314. IngeediejS'TS.—:i lb. of salt to each gallon of water. Mode,—Cleanse and skin the skate, lay it in a fish-kettle, with sufficient water to cover it, salted in the above proportion. Let it simmer very gently till, done ; then dish it on a hot napkin, and serve with shrimp, lobster, or caper sauce. Time.—According to size, from l to 1 hour. Average cost^ id per lb. Seasonable from August to April. CBIMPED SKATE. 315. Ingeecients.—J lb. of salt to each gallon of water. Mode.—Clean, skin, and cut the fish into slices, which roll and tie round with string. Have ready some water highly salted, put in the fish, and boil till it is done. Drain well, remove the string, dish on a hot napkin, and serve with the same sauces as above. Skate should never be eaten out of season, as it is liable to produce diarrhoea and other diseases. It may be dished without a napkin, and the sauce poured over. Time.—About 20 minutes. Average cost^ Ad. per lb. Seasonable from August to April. To CHOOSE Skate.—This fish should be chosen for its firmness^ breadth^ and thickness, and should have a creamy appearance. When crimped, it should not be kept longer than a day or two, as all kinds of crimped fish soon become sour. The Skate.—This is one of the raj tribe, and ^ is extremely abundant and cheap in the fishing towns of England. The flesh is white, thick, and nourishing; but, we suppose, from its being so plentiful, it is esteemed less than it ought to be on account of its nutritive properties, and the ease with which it is digested. It is much im- proved by crimping; in v^hich state it is usually sold in London. The Tiiohnback differs from the true skate by having largo spines in its back, of which the other is destitute. It is taken in great THOENBACK SKATE, abundance during the spring and summer months, but its llesh is not so good as it is in November. It is, in regard to quality, inferior to that of the true skate. SEATS V7ITH CAPEB SAUCE (a la Francaise) 316. Ingeediexts.—2 or 3 slices of skate, | pint of vinegar, 2 oz. of salt, i teaspoonful of pepper, 1 sliced onion, a small bunch of parsle^^ 2 bay-leaves, 2 or 3 sprigs of thyme, sufficient water to cover the fish. Mode.—Put in a fish-kettle all the above ingredients, and simmer the skate in them till tender. When it is done, skin it neatly, andMODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. 156 pour over it some of the liquor in wliicli it has been hoiling. Drain it, put it on a hot dish, pour over it caper sauce, and send some of the latter to table in a tureen. Time,-—^ hour. Average cost, id, per lb. Seasonable from August to April. ^ote.—Skate may a'so be served with onion sauce, or parsley and butter. SMAIili SKATE FRIED. 317. Ingeedients.—Skate, sufficient vinegar to cover them, salt and pepper to taste, 1 sliced onion, a small bunch of parsley, the juice of ^ lemon, hot dripping. Mode.—Cleanse the skate, lay them in a dish, with sufficient vinegar to cover them; add the salt, pepper,onion, parsley, and lemon-juice, and let the fish remain in this pickle for l| hour. Then drain them well, flour them, and fry of a nice brown, in hot dripping. They may be served either with or without sauce. Skate is not good if dressed too fresh, unless it is crimped ; it should, therefore, be kept for a day, but not long enough to produce a disagreeable smell. Time.—10 minutes. Average cost, 4.d. per lb. Seasonable from August to April. Other species of Skate.—Besides the true slcate, there are several other species found in our seas. These are Irno'.vn as tho ?"hife skate, the long-nosed skate, and the Homelyn ray, which are of inferior quality, though often crimped, and sold for true skate. TO BAKE SMELTS. 318. Ingeediekts.—12 smelts, bread crumbs, J lb. of fresh butter, 2 blades of pounded mace ; salt and cayenne to taste. 3£ode.—Wash, and dry the fish thoroughly in a cloth, and arrange them nicely in a fiat baking-dish. Cover them with fine bread crumbs, and place little pieces of butter all over them. Season and bake for 15 minutes. Just before serving, add a squeeze of lemon-juice, and garnish with fried parsley and cut lemon. Thiie.—J hour. Average cost, 2s. per dozen. Seasonable from October to May. Sufficient for 6 persons. To Choose Smelts.—When good, this fish is of a fine silvery appearance, and when alive, their backs are of a dark brown shade, which, after death, fades to a light fawn. They ought to have a refreshing fragrance, resembling that of a CTiicumber. The Odotir o? the Smelt.—This peculiarity in the smelt has been compared, by some, to the fragrance of a cucumber, and by others, to that of a violet. It is a very elegant fish, and formerly abounded in the Tliames. The AOiarine, or sand smelt, is cometimes sold for the true one; but it is an inferior fish, being drier in the quality of its flesh. On the south coast of England, \yhcre the true sm.elt is rare, it is plentiful.157 risn. TO FRY SMELTS. 319. Ingeedien'TS.—Egg and bread crumbs, a little flour; boiling lard. ilfbfZe.—Smelts should be very fresh, and not washed more than is necessary to clean them. Dry them in a cloth, lightly flour, dip them in egg, and sprinkle over with very fine bread crumbs, and put them into boiling lard. Fry of a nice pale brown, and be careful not to take off the light roughness of the crumbs, or their beauty will be spoiled. Dry them before the fire on a drainer, and serve with plain melted butter. This fish is often used as a garnishing. Time.—5 minutes. Average cost, 2s. per dozen. Seasonable from October to May. The Smelt.—This is a delicate little fish, and is in high esteem. Mr. Yarrell asserts that the THE SiTELT. true smelt is entirely confined to the western and eastern coasts of Britain. It very rarely ventures far from the shore, and is plentiful in November, December, and January. BAKED SOLES. 320. In'giiedients.—2 soles, f lb. of butter, egg, and bread crumbs, minced parsley, 1 glass of sherry, lemon-juice; cayenne and salt to taste. Mode. — Clean, skin, and well wash the fish, and dry them thoroughly in a cloth. Brush them over with egg, sprinkle with bread crumbs mixed with a little minced parsley, lay them in a large flat baking-dish, white side uppermost; or if it will not hold the two soles, they may each be laid on a dish by itself; but they must not be put one on the top of the other. Melt the butter, and pour it over the whole, and bake for 20 minutes. Take a portion of the gravy that flows from the fish, add the wine, lemon-juice, and season- ing, give it one boil, skim, pour it imder the fish, and serve. Time.—20 minutes. Average cost^ Is. to 2s. per pair. Seasonable at any time. Sufficient for 4 or 5 persons. To CHOOSE Soles.—This fish should be both thick and firm. If the skin is difficult to be taken off, and the flesh looks grey, it is good. The Sole.—This rants next to the turbot in point of excellence among our flat fish. It is abundant on the British coasts, but those of the the sole. ■western shores are much superior in size to those taken on the northern. The finest are caught in Torbay, and frequently weigli 8 or 10 lbs. per pair. Its tlesh being firm, white, and delicate, is greatly esteemed.MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. BOILED SOLES. '321. Ingredients.—5 lb. salt to each gallon of water. Mode.—Cleanse and wash the fish carefully, cut off the fins, but do not skin it. Lay it in a fish-kettle, with sufficient cold water to cover it, salted in the above proportion. Let it gradually come to a boil, and keep it simmering: for a few minutes, according to the size of the fish. Dish it on a hot napkin after well draining; it, and garnish wdth parsley and cut lemon. Shrimp, or lobster sauce, and plain melted butter, are usually sent to table with this dish. Time.—After the water boils, 7 minutes for a middling-sized sole. Average cost, Is. to 25. per pair. Seasonable at any time. Sufficienty—1 middling-sized sole for 2 persons. SOLE OB COD PIE. 322. Ingeedients.—The remains of cold boiled sole or cod, seasoning to taste of pepper, salt, and pounded mace, 1 dozen oysters to each lb. of fish, 3 tablespoonfuls of white stock, 1 teacupful of cream thickened with flour, puff paste. Mode,—Clear the fish from the bones, lay it in a pie-dish, and be- tween each layer put a few oysters and a little seasoning; add the stock, and, w^hen liked, a small quantity of butter; cover with puff paste, and bake for ^ hour. Boil the cream with sufficient flour to thicken it; pour in the pie, and serve. Time.—^ hour. Average cost for this quantity, I0d» Scasoiiahle at any time. Sufficient for 4 persons. SOLES WITH CBEAM SAUCE. 323. Ingeedients.—2 soles; salt, cayenne, and pounded mace to taste ; the juice of i lemon, salt and water, I pint of cream. Mode.—Skin, wash, and fillet the soles, and divide each fillet in 2 pieces ; lay them in cold salt and water, which bring gradually to a boil. When the water boils, take out the fish, lay it in a delicately clean stewpan, and cover with the cream. Add the seasoning, simmer very gently for ten minutes, and, just before serving, put in the lemon- juice. The fillets may be rolled, and secured by means of a skewer; but this is not so economical a way of dressing them, as double the quantity of cream is required. Time.—10 minutes in the cream.159 nsn. Average cost, from Is. to 2s. per pair. Seasonable at any time. Sufficient for 4 or 5 persons. This will be found a most delicate and delicious dish. The Sole a favourite with the Ancient Greeks.—This fish was much sought after by the ancient Greeks on account of its light and nourishing qualities. The brill, the flounder, the diamond and Dutch plaice, which, with the sole, were known under the general name ot'passeres, were all equally esteemed, and had generally the same qualities attributed to them. FILLETED SOLES A L'lTALIEEnSTE. 324. Ingeedients.—2 soles; salt, pepper, and grated nutmeg to taste ; egg and bread crumbs, butter, the juice of 1 lemon. Mode.—Skin, and carefully wash the soles, separate the meat from the bone, and divide each fillet in two pieces. Brush them over with white of egg, sprinkle with bread crumbs and seasoning, and put them in a baking-dish. Place small pieces of butter over the whole, and bake for i hour. When they are nearly done, squeeze the juice of a lemon over them, and serve on a dish, with Italian sauce (see Sauces) poured over. Time.—^ hour. Average cost, from 1^. to 2s. per pair. Seasonable at any time. Sufficient for 4 or 5 persons. "Whtting may be dressed in the same manner, and will be found very delicious. The Flavour op the Sole.—This, as a matter of course, greatly depends on the nature of the ground and bait upon which the animal feeds , Its natural food are small crabs and shell-fish. Its colour also depends on the colour of the ground where it feeds ; for if this be white, then the sole is called the white, or lemon sole; but if the bottom be muddy, then it is called the black sole. Small-sized soles, caught in shallow water on the coasts, are the best in flavour. PBICASSEED SOLES. 325. Ikgeedients.—2 middling-sized soles, 1 small one, i tea- spoonful of chopped lemon-peel, 1 teaspoonful of chopped parsley, a little grated bread; salt, pepper, and nutmeg to taste; 1 egg, 2 oz. butter, i pint of good gravy, 2 tablespoonfuls of port wine, cayenne and lemon-juice to taste. Mode.—Yrj the soles of a nice brown, as directed in recipe No. 327, and drain them well from fat. ' Take all the meat from the small sole, chop it fine, and mix with it the lemon-peel, parsley, bread, and seasoning; work altogether, with the yolk of ai?. egg and the butter; make this into,small balls, and fry them. Thicken the gravy with a dessert-spoonful of flour, add the port wine, cayenne, and lemon-M0D2RN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY.

SeasonaUe at any time. Sufficient for 4 or 5 persons. How Soles are caught.—The instrument usually emr)loyed is a trawl net, which is sh.aped like a pocket, of from sixty to eighty feet long, and open at the mouth from thirty-two to forty feet, and three deep. This is dragged along the ground by the vessel, and on the art of the fisherman in its employment, in a great measure depends the quality of the fish he catches. If, for example, he drags the net too quickly, all that are caught are swept rapidly to the end of the net, where they are smothered, and sometimes destroyed. A medium has to be observed, in order that as few as possible escape being caught in the net, and as many as possible preserved alive in it. FBIED FILLETED SOLES. 326. Soles for filleting should be large, as the flesh can be more easily separated from the bones, and there is less waste. Skin and wash the fish, and raise the meat carefully from the bones, and divide it into nice handsome pieces. The more usual way is to roll the fillets, after dividing each one in two pieces, and either bind them round with twine, or run a small skewer through them. Brush over with egg, and cover with bread crumbs; fry them as directed in the fore- going recipe, and garnish with fried parsley and cut lemon. When a pretty dish is desired, this is by far the most elegant mode of dressing soles, as they look much better than when fried whole. {See Coloured Plate A.) Instead of rolling the fillets, they may be cut into square pieces, and arranged in the shape of a pyramid on the dish. Time.—About 10 minutes. Average costf from Is. to 2s. per pair. Seasonable at any time. Sufficienty—2 large soles for 6 persons. FBIED SOLES. 327- Ingredients.—2 middling-sized soles, hot lard or clarified dripping, egg, and bread crumbs. 3Iode.—^'k\n and carefully wash the soles, and cut off the fins, wipe them very dry, and let them remain in the cloth until it is time to dress them. Have ready some fine bread crumbs and beaten egg; dredge the soles with a little flour, brush them over with egg, and cover with bread crumbs. Put them in a deep pan, with plenty of clarified dripping or lard (when the expense is not objected to, oil is still better) heated, so that it may neither scorch the fish nor make them sodden. When they are sufficiently cooked on one side, turn them carefully, and brown them on the other : they may be considered ready when a thick smoke rises. Lift them out carefully, and layIGl FISH. them before the fire on a reversed sieve and soft paper, to absorb tlie fat. Particular attention should be paid to this, as nothing is more disagreeable than greasy fish: this may be always avoided by dress- ing them in good time, and allowing a few minutes for them to get thoroughly crisp, and free from greasy moisture. Dish them on a hot napkin, garnish with cut lemon and fried parsley, and send them to table with shrimp sauce and plain melted butter. Time.—10 minutes for large soles ; less time for small ones. Average cost, from Is. to 25. per pair. Seasonable at any time. Sufficient for 4 or 5 persons. SOLES WITH MUSHROOMS. 328. INGREDIENTS.—1 pint of milk, 1 pint of water, 1 oz. butter, 1 oz. salt, a little lemon-juice, 2 middling-sized soles. Mode,—Cleanse the soles, but do not skin them, and lay them in a fish-kettle, with the milk, water, butter, salt, and lemon-juice. Bring them gradually to boil, and let them simmer very gently till done, which will be in about 7 minutes. Take them up, drain them well on a cloth, put them on a hot dish, and pour over them a good mushroom sauce. {See Sauces.) Time.—After the water boils, 7 minutes. Seasonahle at any time. Sufficient for 4 persons. SPBATS. 329. Sprats should be cooked very fresh, which can be ascertained by their bright and sparkling eyes. Wipe them dry; fasten them in-rows by a skewer run through the eyes; dredge with fiour, and broil them on a gridiron over a nice clear fire. The gridiron should be rubbed with suet. Serve very hot. Ti?7ie.—3 or 4 minutes. Average cost. Id. per lb. Seasonahle from !N"ovember to March. To Choose Sprats.—Choose these from their silvery appearraice, as th3 brighter they are, so are they the fresher. SPBATS PBIED IIST BATTZE. 330. Ingredients.—2 eggs, flour, bread crumbs; seasoning of salt and pepper to taste. 3Iode.—"Wipe the sprats, and dip them in a batter made of the abovs ingredients. Fry of a nice brown, serve very hot, and garnish with fried parsley. Sprats may be baked like herrings. {See No. 268.) M1C2 MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. DBIED SPBATS. 331. Dried sprats shoiiid be put into a basin, and boiling water poured over them; they may then be skinned and served, and this will be found a much better way than boiling them. Tee Speat.—This migratory fish is rarely found longer than four or five inches, and visits the shores of Britain after the herring and other kinds of fish have taken their departure from them. On the coasts of Sufiblk, Essex, and TO^^S^^^^^^^ Kent, they are very abundant, and from 400 to S^^^^^^^^ 500 boats are employed in catching them during the winter season. Besides plentifully supplying THE SPK.AT London market, they are frequently sold at sixpence a bushel to farmers for manuring pur- poses. They enter the Thames about the beginning of JS'ovember, and leave it in March. At Yarmouth and Gravesend they are cured like red herrings. BAKED STURaEOlT. 332. Ingeedients.—1 small sturgeon, salt and pepper to taste, 1 small bunch of herbs, the juice of i lemon, j lb. of butter, 1 pint of white wine. Mode.—Cleanse the fish thoroughly, skin it, and split it along the belly without separating it; have ready a large baking-dish, in which lay the fish, sprinkle over the seasoning and herbs very finely minced, and moisten it with the lemon-juice and wine. Place the butter in small pieces over the whole of the fish, put it in the oven, and baste frequently; brown it nicely, and serve with its own gravy. Time.—JSTearly 1 hour. Average cost^ Is. to Is. Qd. per lb. Seasonable from August to March. The Sturgeon.—This fish commences the sixth of the Linnsean order, and all the species are large, seldom measuring, when full-grown, less than three or four feet ia length. Its flesh is reckoned extremely delicious, and, in the time of the emperor Severn?, was so highly valued by the ancients, that it was brought to table by servants crowned with coronets, and preceded by a band of music^ It is an inhabitant of the Baltic, the Mediter- ranean, the Caspian, and the Black Sea, and of the Danube, the Volga, the Don, and other large rivers. It is abundant in the rivers of North America, and is occasionally taken in the Thames, as well as in the Eske and the Eden. It is one of those fishes considered as I'oyal property. It is from its roe that caviare, a favourite food of the Eussians, is prepared. Its flesh is dehcate, firm, and white, but is rare in the London market, where it sells for Is. or Is. Gd. per lb. The Steelet is a smaller species of sturgeon, found in the Caspian Sea and some Kussian rivers. It also is greatly prized on account of the delicacy of its flesh. the sturgeon. FvOAST STUHGEOJNT. 333. Ingbediejjts.—Yeal stuffing, buttered paper, the tail-end of a sturgeon. itZbi/e.—Cleanse the fish, bone and skin it; make a nice veal stuffing163 nsn. 335- Ingbedie^^^ts.—I pint of stock No. 105, I pint of Madeira or {see Forcemeats), and fill it with the part where the bones came from; roll it in buttered paper, bind it "Kp firmly with tape, like a fillet of veal, and roast it in a Dutch oven before a clear fire. Serve with good brown gravy, or plain melted butter. Ti7ne.—About 1 hour. Average cost^ Is. to Is. Gd. per To. Seasonable from August to March. Note.—»?turgeon may be plain-boiled, and served with Dutcli sraice. Tlio fish is very firm, and requires long boiling. Estimate of the STUEaEo;?r by the Anciektts.—B}' the ancients, tlie flesh of this fish was compared to the ambrosia of the immortals. The poet Martial passes a h'-gh eulogium upon it, and assigns it a place on the luxurious tables of the Palatine Mount. If Ave may credit a modern traveller in China, the people of that country generally entirely abstain from it, and the sovereign of the Celestial Empire confines it to his own kitchen, or dispenses it to only a few of his greatest favourites. MATEIiOT OF TENCH. 334. iNGr.EDiENTS.—i pint of stock Ko. 105, | pint of port wine, 1 dozen button onions, a few mushrooms, a faggot of herbs, 2 blades of mace, 1 oz. of butter, 1 teaspoonful of minced parsley, thyme, 1 shalot, 2 anchovies, 1 teacupful of stock No. 105, flour, 1 dozen oysters, the juice of | lemon ; the number of tench, according to size. 3£ode.—Scale and clean the tench, cut them into pieces, and lay them in a stewpan; add the stock, wine, onions, mushrooms, herbs, and mace, and simmer gently for I hour. Put into another stewpan all the remaining ingredients but the oysters and lemon-juice, and boil slowly for 10 minutes, when add the strained liquor from the tench, and keep stirring it over the fire until somewhat reduced. Kub it through a sieve, pour it over the tench with the oysters, which must be previously scalded in their own liquor, squeeze in the lemon-juice, and serve. Garnish with croutons. Time.—| hour. Seasonahle from October to June. The Tejtch.—This fish is generally found in foul and weedy waters, and in such places as are well supplied with rushes. They thrive best in standing waters, and are more numerous in pools and ponds than in rivers. Those taken in the latter, however, are preferable for the table. It does not often exceed four or five pounds in weight, and is in England esteemed as a delicious and wholesome food. As, however, they are sometimes found in waters where the mud is excessively fetid, their flavour, if cooked im- mediately" on being caught, is often very unpleasant; but if they are transx"erred into clear water, they soon recover from the obnoxious taint. TEKCH STEWED WITH WIITE. M 2 THE TENCH,MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. 161 sherry, salt and pepper to taste, 1 bay-leaf, thickening of butter and flour. 3fode.—Clean and crimp the tench; carefully lay it in a stewpan with the stock, wine, salt and pepper, and bay-leaf; let it stew gently for i hour; then take it out, put it on a dish, and keep hot. Strain the liquor, and thicken it with butter and flour kneaded together, and stew for 0 minutes. If not perfectly smooth, squeeze it through a tammy, add a very little cayenne, and pour over the fish. Garnish with balls of veal forcemeat. Time.—Ptather more than l hour. Seasonable from October to June. A SINGULAR QUALITY i>- THE TE^'c^.—It is Said that tlie tench is possessed of such healing proiDcrties among the tinny tribes, that even the voracious pike spares it on thi3 account. The pike, fell t3^rant of the liquid plain, With ravenous waste devours his fellow train; Yet howsoe'er ^Yith raging famine pined, The tench he spares, a medicinal kind; For when by wounds distress'd, or sore disease, He courts the salutary fish for ea«e; Close to his scales the kind ph3'sician glides. And sweats a healing balsam from his sides. In our estimation, however, this self-denial in the pike may be attributed to a less poetical cause; namely, from the mud-loving disposition of the tench, it is enabled to keep itself so completely concealed at the bottom of its aqueous haunts, that it remains secure from the attacks of its predatory neighbour. STEWED TROUT. 336. IxGr.EDiENTS.—2 middling-sized trout, onion cut in thin slices, a little parsley, 2 cloves, 1 blade of mace, 2 bay-leaves, a little thyme, salt and pepper to taste, 1 pint of medium stock No. 105, 1 glass of port wine, thickening of butter and flour. Ilode.—Wash the fish very clean, and wipe it quite dry. Lay it in a stewpan, with all the ingredients but the butter and flour, and simmer gently for ^ hour, or rather more, should not the fish be quite done. Take it out, strain the gravy, add the thickening, and stir it over a sharp fire for 5 minutes ; pour it over the trout, and serve. Time.—According to size, l hour or more. Average cos^.—Seldom bought. Seasonable from May to September, and fatter from the middle to the end of August than at any other time. Sufficient for 4 persons. ' Trout may be served with anchovy or caper sauce, baked in buttered paper, or fried whole like smelts. Trout dressed a la Genevese is extremely delicate; for this proceed the same as with salmon, No. 307.1G5 FISH. The Trout.—This fish, though esteemed by the moderna for its delicacy, was little re<»arded by the ancients. Although it abounded in tlio lakes of the Roman empire, it is generally mentioned by ^Yriters only on account of the beauty of its colours. About the end of Sep- tember, they quit the deep water to which they had retired during the hot weather, for the purpose of spawning. This they always do on a gravelly bottom, or where gravel and sand are mixed among stones, towards the end or by the sides of streams. At this period they become black about the head and body, and become soft and unwholesome. They are never good when they are large with roe; but there are in all trout rivers some barren female fish, which continue good throughout the winter. In the common trout, the stomach is luicommonly strong and muscular, shell-fi.sh formiiT;^ a portion of the food of the animal; and it takes into its stomach gravel or sm;ill stones in order to assist in comminuting it. T3IE TROUT. BOILED TUBBOT. 837. Ingiiedients.—6 oz. of salt to each gallon of water. 3Iode.—Choose a middling-sized turbot; for they are invariably the inost valuable: if very large, the raeat will be tough and thready. Three or four hours before dressing, soak the fish in salt and water to take off the slime; then thoroughly cleanse it, and v/ith a knife make an incision down the middle of the back, to prevent the skin of the belly from cracking. Paib it over with lemon, and be particular not to cut oft the fins. Lay the fish in a very clean turbot-kettle, with sufficient cold water to cover it, and salt in the above proportion. Let ifc gradually come to a boil, and skim very carefully; keep it gently simmering, and on no account let it boil fast, as the fish would have a very unsightly appearance. When the meat separates easily from the bone, it is done ; then take it out, let it drain well, and dish it on a hot napkin. Eub a little lobster spawn through a sieve, sprinkle it over the fish, and garnish with tlifts of parsley and cut lemon. Lobster or shrimp sauce, and plain melted butter, should be sent to table with it. {See Coloured Plate E.) Time.—After the water boils, about J hour for a large turbot; niiddliug size, about 20 minutes. Average cost,—large turbot, from 105. to 12j. ; middling size, fror.i 125. to 155. Seasonable at any time. Sufficient, 1 middling-sized turbot for 8 persons. Note.—An amusing anecdote is related, by Miss Edgcworth, of a bishop, •who, descending to his kitchen to superintend the dressing of a turbot, and discovering that his cook had stuj^idly cut off the fins, immediately comimenced sewing them on again with liis own episcopal fingers. This dignitary knew the value of a turbot's gelatinous appendages.MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. m GABOTSH FOB TURBOT OK OTHEB LABGE FISH. 338. Take the crumb of a stale loaf, cut it into small pyramids with flat tops, and on the top of each pyramid, put rather more than a table- spoonful of white of egg beaten to a stiff froth. Over this, sprinkle finely-chopped parsley and fine raspings of a dark colour. Arrange these on the napkin round the fish, one green and one brown alter- nately. To Choose Turbot.—See that it is thick, and of a yellowish white; for if of a bluish tint, it is not good. The-Tuebot—This is the most esteemed of all our flat fish. The northern parts of the Enghsh coast, and some places olf the coast of Holland, produce turbot in great abundance, and in greater excehence than any other parts of the world. The London market is chiefly supphed by Dutch fishermen, who bring to it nearly 90,000 a year. The flesh is firm, white, . rich, and gelatinous, and is the better for being kept a day or two previous to cooking it. In many parts of the country, turbot and hahbut are indiscriminately sold for each other. They are, however, perfectly distinct; the upper parts of the former being marked with large, unequal, and obtuse tubercles, while those of the other are quite smooth, and covered with oblong soft scales, which firmly adhere to the body. tiil: tueeot. Fish-kettles are made in an oblong form, and have two handles, with a movable bottom, pierced full of holes, on which the fish is laid, and on which it may be lifted from the water, by means of two long handles attached to each side of the movable bottom. This is to pre- vent the liability of breaking the fish, as it would necessarily be if it were cooked in a com- mon saucepan. In the hst of-Messrs. Kichard and John Slack (see 71), the price of two of these is set down at 10s. The turbot-kettle, as will be seen by our cut, is made differently from ordinary fish-kettles, it being leas deep, whilst it is wider, and more pointed at the sides; thus exactly answering to tiie shape of the fish which it is intended should be boiled in it. It may be obtained from the same manufacturers, and its price is £1. TUKBOT-SEITLE. BAKED FIIiLSTS OF TURBOT. 339. Iis-QHEDiENis.—The remains of cold turbot, lobster sauce left from the preceding day, egg, and bread crumbs; cayenne and salt to taste ; minced parsley, nutmeg, lemon-juice. Mode.—After having cleared the fish from all skin and bone, divide it into square pieces of an equal size; brush them over with egg, sprinkle with bread crumbs mixed with a little minced parsley and seasoning. Lay the fillets in a baking-dish, with sulficient butter to baste with. Bake for i hour, and do not forget to keep them well moistened with the butter. Put a little lem.on-juice and grated nut- meg to the cold lobster sauce; make it hot, and pour over the fish,FISH. 167 "whicli must be well drained from the butter. GarEish witli parsley and cut lemon. Time.—Altogether, k hour. Seasonable at any time. Note.—Cold turbot thus warmed in the remains of lobster sauce will be found much nicer than putting the fish again in water. FILLETS OF TUBBOT A L'ITALIEKK"E. 34^5. Ingredients.—The remains of cold turbot, Italian sauce. (See Sauces.) ilToi/e.—Clear the fish carefully from the bone, and take away all shin, which gives an unpkasant flavour to the sauce. Make tlie sauce hot, lay in the fish to warm through, but do not let it boil. Garnish with croutons. Time.—5 minutes. Seasonahle all the year. The attcient Eomaks' Estim^ate of Tttbsot,—As this luxr;rioiT= people compared soles to partridges, and sturgeons to peacocks, so they found a reseuiblanco to tlie turbot in tlie pheasant. In the time of Domitian, it is said one was taken of such dimensions as to require, in the imperial kitchen, a new stove to be erecled, and a new dish to be made for it, in order that it might be cooked and served wliole : not even imperial Rome could furnish a stove or a dish large enough for the monstrous animal. Where it was caut^ht, we are not aware; hut the turbot of the Adriatic Sea held a high rank in the *' Eternal City." TUBBOT A LA CREME. 341. Ingredients.—The remains of cold turbot. For sauce, 2 oz. of butter, 4 tablespoonfuls of cream ; salt, cayenne, and pounded mace to taste. Mode.—Clear away all skin and bone from the flesh of the turbot, which should be done when it comes from table, as it causes less waste when trimmed hot. Cut the flesh into nice square pieces, as equally as possible; put into a stewpan the butter, let it melt, and add the cream and seasoning ; let it just simmer for one minute, but not boil. Lay in the fish to warm, and serve it garnished witli croutons or a paste border. Time.—10 minutes. Seasonahle at any time. Note.—The remains of cold salmon may be dressed in this way, raid the above mixture may be served in a vol-au-vs)it. TURBOT AU GRATIIsr. 342.

Serve vrith anchovy or caper sauce, and plain melted butter. jfYme.—After the water boils, 5 minutes. A verage cost for small whitings, id. each. Seasonable all the year, but best from October to March. Sufficiejit, 1 small whiting for each person. To Choose Whiting.—Choose for tlie firmness of its flcsli and the sih-ery hue of its appearance. The Whiting.—This fish forms a light, ten- der, and delicate food, easy of di;?estion. It appears in our seas in the spring, within three miles of the shores, where it arrives in large shoals to deposit its spawn. It is caught by line, and is usually between ten and twelve inches long, and seldom exceeding a pound and a half in weight. On the edge of the Dogger Bank, however, it has been caught so heavy as ta weigh from three to seven or eight pounds. When less than six inches long, it is not allowed to be caught. EPvOIIiED WHITIIvra. 344. Inghedients.—Salt and water, flour. Mode.—W^ash the whiting in salt a.nd water, wipe them thoroughly, and let them remain in the cloth to absorb all moisture. Flour them well, and broil over a very clear fire. Serve with maitre d'hotcl sauce, or plain melted butter {see Sauces). Be careful to preserve the liver, as by some it is considered very delicate. Time.—5 minutes for a small whiting. Average cost, id. each. Seasonable all the year, but best from October to March. Sufficient, 1 small whiting for each person.

Ingeedients.—Egg' and bread crumbs, a little flour, hot lard or clarified dripping. IIode.—Tsike off the skin, clean, and thoroughly wipe the fish free from all moisture, as this is most essential, in order that the egg and bread crumbs may properly adhere. Fasten the tail in the mouth by means of a small skewer, brush the fish over with egg, dredge with a little flour, and cover with bread crumbs. Fry them in hot lard or clarified dripping of a nice colour, and serve them on a napkin, gar- nished with fried parsley. {See Coloured Plate D.)

Mode,—Grease the bottom of a baking-dish with butter, and over it, strew some minced parsley and mushrooms. Scale, empty, and w^ash the whitings, and wipe them thoroughly dry, carefully preserving the livers. Lay them in the dish, sprinkle them with bread crumbs and seasoning, adding a little grated nutmeg, and also a little more minced parsley and mushrooms. Place small pieces of butter over the w^hiting, moisten Vv^ith the wine, and bake for 20 minutes in a hot oven. If there should be too much sauce, reduce it by boiling over a sharp fire for a few minutes, and pour under the fish. Serve with a cut lemon, and no other sauce. Tiine.—20 minutes.

The Whiting Pout, and PolI.ick.—About the moutli of the Thames, and {gene- rally all round the English coasts, as well as in the northern seas, the pout is plentiful. It bears a strilcing resemblance to the whiting, and is esteemed as an excellent fish.— The pollacTc is also taken all round our coasts, and likewise bears a striking resemblance to the whiting; indeed, it is sometimes mistaken by the inexperienced for that fish; its flesh being considered by many equally delicate. TO DUEBS WHITEBAIT. 348. I]s-GiiEDiENTS.—A little flour, hot lard, seasoning of salt. 3fode.—This fish should be put into iced water as soon as bought, unless they are cooked immediately. Drain them from the water in a colander, and have ready a nice clean dry cloth, over which put 2 good handfuls of flour. Toss in the whitebait, shake them lightly in the cloth, and put them in a wicker sieve to take avray the superfluous flour. Throw them into a pan of boiling lard, very few at a time, and let them fry till of a whitey-brown colour. Directly they are done, they must be taken out, and laid before the fire for a minute or two on a sieve reversed, covered with blotting-paper to absorb the fat. Dish them on a hot napkin, arrange the fish very high in the centre, and sprinkle a little salt over the whole. Time.—3 minutes. Seasonahle from April to August. Whitebait. — This highly-esteemed little fish appears in innumerr.ble'multitudes in the river Thames, near Greenwich and Blaekwall, during the month of July, when it forms, served with Jemon and brown bread and butter, a tempting dish to vast numbers of Londoners, "WHITEBAIT. >^ho flock to the various taverns of these places, in order to gratify their appetites. The fish has been supposed be the fry of the shad, the sprat, the smelt, or the bleak. Mr. Yarrell, however, maintains that it is a species in itself, distinct from every other fish. When fried with flour, it is esteemed a great delicacy. The ministers of the Crown have had a custom, for many years, of having a "whitebait dinner" just before the close of the session. It is invariably the precursor of the prorogation of Parliament, and the repast is provided by the jjroprietor of the *' Trafalgar," Greenwich. FISH PIE, WITH TEJSrCH AISTD EELS. 349.

It will be seen, from the number and variety of tbe recipes wbicli we have been enabled to give under the head of Fisn, that there exists in the salt ocean, and fresh-water rivers, an abundance of aliment, which the present state of gastronomic art enables the cook to introduce to the table in the most agreeable forms, and oftentimes at a very moderate cost. Less nutritious as a food than the flesh of animals, more succulent than vegetables, fish may be termed a middle dish, suited to all temperaments and constitutions; and one which those who are recovering from illness may partake of with safety and advantage. As to which is the best fish, there has been much discussion. The old Latin iDroverb, however, de gii&tihus non disputandtun, and the more modern Spanish one, sohre los gustos no hai disjouta, declare, with equal force, that where taste is concerned, no decision can be arrived at. Each person's palate may be differently affected—pleased or displeased ; and there is no standard by which to judge why a red mullet, a sole, or a turbot, should l>u better or worse than a salmon, trout, pike, or a tiny tench. Fish, as we have explained, is less nourishing than meat; for it is lighter in weight, size for size, and contains no ozmazome {see No. lOo). Shell-fish, oysters particularly, furnish but little nutriment; and this is the reason why so many of the latter can be eaten without injury to the system.. In Brillat Savarin's* clever and amusing volume, ^' The Physiology of Taste," he says, that towards the end of the eighteenth century it was a most common thing for a well-arranged entertainment in Paris to commence with oysters, and that many guests were not contented without swallowing twelve dozen. Being anxious to know the weight of this advanced-guard, he ascertained that a dozen oysters, fluid included, weighed 4 ounces,—thus, the twelve dozen would weigh about 3 lbs. ; and there can be no doubt, that the same persons v.lio made no worse a dinner on account of having partaken of the oysters, would have been completely satisfied if they had eaten the same weight of chicken or mutton. An anecdote, perfectly well authenticated, is narrated of a French gentleman (M. Laperte), residing at Versailles, who was extra- vagantly fond of oysters, declaring he never had enough. Savarin resolved to procure him the satisfaction, and gave him an invitation to dinner, which was duly accepted. The guest arrived, and his host kept company with him in swallowing the delicious bivalves up to the tenth dozen, when, exhausted, * Brillat Savarin was a French lawyer and judge of considerable eminence and great talents, and wrote, under the above title, a book on gastronomy, full of instructive information, enlivened with a fund of pleasantly-told anecdote.MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. 174 ho gave up, and let M. Laperte go on alone. This gentleman managed to cat thirty-two dozen within an hour, and would doubtless have got through more, but the person who opened them is described as not being very skilful. In the interim Savarin was idle, and at length, tired with his painful state of inaction, he said to Laperte, whilst the latter was still in full career, "Men cher, you will not eat as many oysters to-day as you meant; let us dine." They dined, and the insatiable oyster-eater acted at the repast as if he had fasted for a week. GEHEHAIi DIBSCTIOHS FOB CABVING PISH. In Carving Fish, care should be taken to help it in perfect flakes, as, if these are broken, the beauty of the fish is lost. The carver should be ac- quainted, too, v/ith the choicest parts and morsels ; and to give each guest an equal share of these tiilits should be his maxim. Steel knives and forks should on no account be used in helping fish, as these are liable to impart to it a very disagreealSle flavour. Where silver fish-carvers are considered too dear to bo bought, good electro-plated ones answer very well, and are inexpensive. The prices set down for them by Messrs. Slack, of the Strand, are from a guinea upwards. COB'S HEAD AND SHOULDEBS.

Note.—Of this fish, the parts about the backbone and shoulders are the firmest, and most esteemed by connoisseurs. The sound, which lines the fish beneath the backbone, is considered a delicacy, as are also the gelatinous parts about the head and neck. FISH CAEYING.

The carver should ask the175 FISH CARVIJ^'G. SALMON. (For recipe, see No. 801; and for mode of dressing, Coloured Plate B.) First run the knife quite down to tlie bone, along the side of the fish, from a to 6, and also from c to d. Then help the thick part lengthwise, that is, in the direction of the lines from a to 6; and the thin part breadthwise, that is, in the direction of the lines from e to /, as shown in the engraving. A slice of the thick part should always be accompanied by a smaller piece of the thin from the belly, where lies the fat of the fish. Note.—Many persons, in carving salmon, make the mistake of slioing the thick part of this fish in the opposite direction to that we have stated; an-d thusj by the breaking of the flakes, the beauty of its appearance is destroyed. BOILED OR FBIBD SOLE. (For recipes, see Nos. 321 and 327.) The usual way of helping this fish is to cut it quite through, bone and all, distributing it in nice and not too large pieces. A moderately- sized sole will be sufiicient for three slices; namely, the head, middle, and tail. The guests should be asked which of these they prefer. A small one will only give two slices. If the sole is very large, the upper side may be raised from the bone, and then divided into pieces; and the under side afterwards served in the same way. In helping Filleted Soles, one fillet is given to each person. (For mode of serving, see Coloured Plate A.) TURBOT. (For recipe, see No. 337 ; and for mode of serving. Coloured Plate E.) First run the fish-slice down the thickest part of the fish, quite through to the bone, from a to and then cut handsome and regular slices in the direction of the lines downwards, from c to e, and upwards from c to c/, as shown in the engraving. When the carver has removed all the meat from the upper side of the fish, the backbone should be raised, put on one side of the dish, and the under side helped as the upper.NoU.—^The thick parts of the middle of the back are the best slices in a turbot; and the rich gelatinous skin covering the fish^ as well as a little of the thick part of the fins, are dainty morsels, and should be placed on each plate. WHITING, &c. Whiting, pike, haddock, and other fish, when of a sufficiently large size, may be carved in the same manner as salmon. When small, they may be cut through, bone and all, and helped in nice pieces, a middling-sized whiting serving for two slices. Note.—The thick part of the Eel is reckoned the best; and this holds good ^ of all flat fish. The TAIL of the Lobster is the prime part, and next to that the claws.

An Anecdote is told of the princo de Soubiso, who, intending to give an entertainment, asked for the bill of fare. Ilis chef came, presenting a list adorned with vignettes, and the first article of whieh, that met the prince's eye, was fifty hams." '^Bertrand," said the prince, I think you must be extravagant; Fifty hams ! do you intend to feast my whole regiment?" '^No, Prince, there will be but one on the table, and the surplus I need for my Espagnole, blondes, garnitures, &c," " Bertrand, you are robbing me: this item will not do." Monseigneur," said the artiste, you do not appreciate me. Give me the order, and I will put those fifty hams in a crystal flask no longer than my thumb." The prince smiled, and the hams were passed. This was all very well for the prince de Soubise ; but as we do not write for princes and nobles alone, but that our British sisters may make the best dishes out of the least expensive ingredients, we will also pass the hams, and give a few general directions concerning Sauces, &c. 355. The Prepakation and Appearance of Sauces and Gravies are of the highest consequence, and in nothing does the talent and taste of the cook more display itself. Their special adaptability to the various viands they are to accompany cannot be too much studied, in order that they may har- monize and blend with them as perfectly, so to speak, as does a pianoforte accompaniment with the voice of the singer. 356. The General Basis of most Gravies and some sauces is the same stock as that used for soups {see Nos. 104, 105, 106, and 107); and, by the N178 MODERN nOUSEHOLD COOKERY. employment of tliese, with, perhaps, an additional slice of ham, a little spice, a few herbs, and a slight flavouring from some cold sauce or ketchup, very nice gravies may be made for a very small expenditure. A milt (either of a bullock or sheep), the shank-end of mutton that has already been dressed, and the necks and feet of poultry, may all be advantageously used foi grav3^, where much is not required. It may, then, be established as a rule, that there exists no necessity for good gravies to be expensive, and that there is no occasion, as many would have the world believe, to buy ever so m.any pounds of fresh meat, in order to furnish an ever so little quantity of gravy, 357. BrcO"WN Sauces, generally speaking, should scarcely be so thick as white sauces ; and it is well to bear in mind, that all those which are intended to mask the various dishes of poultr}^ or meat, should be of a sufficient consistency to slightly adhere to the fowls or joints over which they are poured. For browning and thickening sauces, &c., browned flour may be properly employed. 358. Sauces should possess a decided character ; and whether sharp or sweet, savoury or plain, they should carry out their names in a distinct manner, although, of course, not so much flavoured as to make them too piquant on the one hand, or too mawkish on the other. 359. Gravies and Sauces should be sent to . table very hot ; and there is all the more necessity for the cook to see to this point, as, from their being usually served in small quantities, they are more liable to cool quickly' than if they were in a larger body. Those sauces, of which cream or eggs form a component part, should be well stirred, as soon as these ingredients are added to them, and must never be allowed to boil; as, in that case, they would instantly curdle. 360. Although Pickles may be purchased at shops at as low a rate as they can usually be made for at home, or perhaps even for less, yet we would advise all housewives, who have suflicient time and convenience, to prepare their own. The only general rules, perhaps, worth stating here,—as in the recipes all necessary details will be explained, are, that the vegetables and fruits used should be sound, and not over ripe, and that the very best vinegar should be employed. 361. For Forcemeats, special attention is necessary. The points which cooks should, in this branch of cookery, more particularly observe, are the thorough chopping of the suet, the complete mincing of the herbs, the careful grating of the bread-crumbs, and the perfect mixing of the whole. These are the three principal ingredients of forcemeats, and they can scarcely be cut too small, as nothing like a lump or fibre should be anywhere per- ceptible. To conclude,, the flavour of no one spice or herb should be per- mitted to predominate.RECIPES. CHAPTER X. Saltan, ^tcMes, (Bxnbm, mx)^ ^^oxtmxmh. ANCHOVY SAUCE FOR FISH. 3G-2. Ingkedients.—4 anchovies, 1 oz. of butter, ^ pint of melted butter, cayenne to taste. diode.—Bone the anchovies, and pound them in a mortar to a paste, with 1 oz. of butter. Make the melted butter hot, stir in the pounded anchovies and cayenne; simmer for 3 or 4 minutes; and if liked, add a squeeze of lemon-juice. A more general and expeditious way of making this sauce is to stir in l| tablespoonfuls of anchovy essence to I pint of melted butter, and to add seasoning to taste. Boil the whole up for 1 minute, and serve hot, Time.—o minutes. Average cost, 5d. for h pint. Sufficient, this quantity, for a brill, small turbot, 3 or 4 soles, &c. Ais^CHOVY Butter {see No. 227). Cayenne.—This is the most acrid and stimulating spice with which we are acquainted. It is a powder prepared from several varieties of the capsicum annual East-India plants, of which there are three so far nat'aralized in this country as to be able to grow in the open air : these are the Guinea, the Cherry, and the Bell pepper. All the pods of these are extremely pungent to the taste, and in the green state are used by us as a pickle. When ripe, they are ground into cayenne pepper, and sold as a condiment. The best of this, however, is made in the West Indies, from what is called the Sird pepper, on account of hens and turkeys being extremely partial to it. It is im- ported ready for use. ^ Of the capsicum species of plants there are five; but the-orincipal are,—1. Capsicum annunm, the com- mon long-podded capsicum, which is cultivated in our gar- dens, and of which there are two varieties, one with red, and another with yellow fruit. 2. Capsicum baccatum, or bird epper, which rises -with a shrubby stalk four or five feet igh, with its berries growing at the division of the branches : this is small, oval-shaped, and of a bright-red colour, from which, as we have said, the best cayenne is made. 3. Cap' sicmn grossum, the bell-pepper: the fruit of this is red, and the CAPSicuiT. IS the only kind fit for pickhng. n2180 MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY, APPLE SAUCE FOB GEESE, PORK, &c. 363. Ingredients.—6 good-sized apples, sifted sugar to taste, a piece of butter the size of a walnut, water. 3fode.—Pare, core, and quarter the apples, and throw them into cold water to preserve their whiteness. Put them in a saucepan, with sufficient water to moisten them, and boil till soft enough to pulp. Beat them up, adding sugar to taste, and a small piece of butter This quantity is sufficient for a good-sized tureen. Tiine.—According to the apples, about f hour. Average cost, 4(7. Sufficient^ this quantity, for a goose or couple of ducks. BROWJSr APPLE SAUCE. 3^4. Ingredients.—6 good-sized apples, i pint of brown gravy, cayenne to taste. Mode, Put the gravy in a stewpan, and add the apples, after having pared, cored, and quartered them. Let them simmer gently till tender; beat them to a pulp, and season v;ith cayenne. This sauce is pre- ferred by many to the preceding. Time.—According to the apples, about J hour. Average cost, 6d, ASPARAGUS SAUCE. 3S5. Ingredients.—1 bunch of green asparagus, salt, 1 oz. of fresh butter, 1 small bunch of parsley, 3 or 4 green onions, 1 large lump of sugar, 4 tablespoonfuls of sauce tournee. Mode.—Break the asparagus in the tender part, wash well, and put them into boiling salt and water to render them green. When they are tender, take them out, and put them into cold water; drain them on a cloth till all moisture is absorbed from them. Put the butter in a stewpan, with the parsley and onions; lay in the asparagus, and fry the whole over a sharp fire for 5 minutes. Add salt, the sugar and sauce tournee, and simmer for another 5 minutes. Rub all through a tammy, and if not a very good colour, use a little spinach green. This sauce should be rather sweet. Time.—xiltogether 40 minutes. Average cost for this quantity, Is. id, ASPIC, or ORInTAMEIMTAL SAVOURY JELLY". 3S0. Ingredients.—4 lbs. of knuckle of veal, 1 cow-heel, 3 or 4 slices of ham, any poultry trimmings, 2 carrots, 1 onion, 1 faggot of181 SAUCES, ETC. savoury herbs, 1 glass of sherry, 3 quarts of water; seasoning to taste of salt and whole white pepper; 3 eggs. Mode.—Lay the ham on the bottom of a stewpan, cut up the veal and cow-heel into small pieces, and lay them on the ham; add the poultry trimmings, vegetables, herbs, sherry, and water, and let the whole simmer very gently for 4 hours, carefully taking away all scum that may rise to the surface; strain through a fine sieve, and pour into an earthen pan to get cold. Have ready a clean stewpan, put in the jelly, and be particular to leave the sediment behind, or it will not be clear. Add the whites of 3 eggs, with salt and pepper, to clarify; keep stirring over the fire, till the whole becomes very white; then draw it to the side, and let it stand till clear. When this is the ease, strain it through a cloth or jelly-bag, and use it for moulding poultry, &c. {See Explanation of French Terms, page 44.) Tarragon vinegar may be added to give an additional flavour. Time.—Altogether 4-2- hours. Average cost for this quantity, 45. "White Pepper.—This is the produce of the same plant as that which produces the black pepper, from which it is manufactured by steeping this in lime and water, and rubbint? it between the hands till the coats come off'. The best berries only will bear this operation ; hence the superior qualities of white pepper fetch a higher price than, those of the other. It is less acrid than the black, and is much prized among the Chinese. It is sometimes adulterated with rice-flour, as the black is with bui*nt bread. The berries of the pepper-plant grow in spikes of from twenty to thirty, and are, when ripe, of a bright-red colour. After being gathered, which is done when they are green, they are spread out in the sun, where they dry and become black and shrivelled, when they are ready for being prepared for the market. BECHAMEIi, or FBEHCH WHITE SAUCE. 367. Ingredients.—1 small bunch of parsley, 2 cloves, | bay- leaf, 1 small faggot of savoury herbs, salt to taste; 3 or 4 mush- rooms, when obtainable; 2 pints of white stock, 1 pint of cream, 1 tablespoonful of arrowroot. Mode.—Put the stock into a stewpan, with the parsley, cloves, bay-leaf, herbs, and mushrooms; add a seasoning of salt, but no pepper, as that would give the sauce a dusty appearance, and should be avoided. "When it has boiled long enough to extract the flavour of the herbs, &c., strain it, and boil it up quickly again, until it is nearly half-reduced. Now mix the arrowroot smoothly with the cream, and let it simmer very gently for 5 minutes over a slow fire; pour to it the reduced stock, and continue to simmer slowly for 10 minutes, if the sauce be thick. If, on the contrary, it be too thin, it must be stirred over a sharp fire till it thickens. This is the foundation of many kinds of satices, especially white sauces. Always make it thick, as you can easily thin it with cream, milk, or white stock.THE CLOVE, inch in length, situate below. MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. 182 Time.—Altogether, f hour.

The Clove.—The clove-tree is a native of the Molucca Islands, particularly Amboyna, and attains the height of a laurel-tree, and no verdure is ever seen under it. From the extremities of the branches quantities of flowers grow, first white; then they become green, and next red and hard, when they have arrived at their clove state. "When they become dry, they assume a yellowish hue, which sub- sequently changes into a dark brown. As an aromatic, the clove is highly stimulating, and yields an abundance of oil. There are several varieties of the clove; the best is called the royal clove, which is scarce, and which is blacker and smaller than the other kinds. It is a curious fact, that the flowers, when fuUy developed, are quite in©dorous, and that the real fruit is not in the least aromatic. The form is that of a nail, having a globular head, formed of the four petals of the corolla, and four leaves of the calyx not expanded, with a nearly cylindrical germen, scarcely an BECHAMEL MAIGHE, or WITHOUT MEAT. 368. Ii^GEEDiENTS.—2 onions, 1 blade of mace, mushroom trim- mings, a small bunch of parslej^ 1 oz. of butter, flour, i pint of water, 1 pint of milk, salt, the juice of i lemon, 2 egg;s. 3fode.—'Pxd in a stewpan the milk, and J pint of water, with the onions, mace, mushrooms, parsley, and salt. Let these simmer gently for 20 minutes. In the mean time, rub on a plate 1 oz. of flour and butter; put it to the liquor, and stir it v/ell till it boils up; then place it by the side of the fire, and continue stirring until it is perfectly smooth. Now strain it through a sieve into a basin, after which put it back in the stev/pan, and add the lemon-juice. Beat up the yolks of the eggs with about 4 dessertspoonfuls of milk; strain this to the sauce, keep stirring it over the fire, but do not let it boil, lest it curdle. This is a good sauce to pour over boiled fowls wlien they are a bad colour. PICKLED BEETROOT. 369. Ikgeedients.—Sufficient vinegar to cover the beets, 2 oz. of whole pepper, 2 oz. of allspice to each gallon of vinegar. 3fode,—Wash the beets free from dirt, aiid be very careful not to prick the outside skin, or they would lose their beautiful colour. Put them into boiling water, let them simmer gently, and when about three parts done, which will be in H hour, take them out and let them cool. Boil the vinegar with pepper and allspice, in the above proportion, for ten minutes, and when cold, pour it on the beets, which must be peeled and cut into slices about J inch thick.183 SAUCrS, ETC. Average cost for this quantity, 2d, Cover with bladder to exclude the air, and in a week they will be fit for use. Average costy 3s. per gallon. Black Pepper.—This well-known aromatic spice is the fruit of a species of climbing vine, and is a native of the East Indies, and is extensively cultivated in Malabar and the eastern islands of Borneo, Sumatra, and Java, and others in the same latitude. It was formerly confined to these countries, but it has now been introduced to Cayenne. It is generally employed as a condiment; but it should never be forgotten, that, even in small quantities, it produces detrimental eifects on inflammatory constitutions. Dr. Paris, in his work on Diet, says, " Foreign spices were not intended by Nature for the inhabitants of temperate climes 5 they are heat- ir)g, and highly stimulant. I am, however, not anxious to give more weight to this objection than it deserves. Man is no longer the child of I^atiire, nor the passive inhabitant of any particular region. He ranges over every part of the globe, and elicits nourishment from the productions of every climate. Nature is very kind in favouring the growth of those productions which are most likely to answer our local wants. Those climates, for instance, which engender endemic diseases, are, in general, congenial to the growth of plants that operate as antidotes to them. But if we goto the East for tea, there is no reason why we should not go to the West for sugar. The dyspeptic mvalid, however, should be cautious in their use; they may alford temporary benefit, at the expense of permanent mischief. It has been well said, that the best quality of spices is to stimulate the appetite, and their worst to destroy, by insensible degrees, the tone of the stomach. The intrinsic goodness of meats should always be suspecte'il when they require spicy seasonings to compensate for their natural want of sapidity." The quahty of pepper is known by rubbing it between the hands : that which withs^^^ib'ids this operation is good, that which is reduced to powder by it is bad. The quantity of pepper imported into Europe is very great. BENTON SAUCS (to serve witb. Hot or Cold Koast Beef). 370. Ingkedients.—1 tablespoonful of scraped horseradish, 1 tea- spoonful of made mustard, 1 teaspoonful of pounded sugar, 4 table- spoonfuls of -vinegar. Ifode.—Grate or scrape the horseradish very fine, and mix it with the other ingredients, wLich must be all well blended together; serve in a tureen. With cold meat, this sauce is a very good substitute for pickles. BKSAD SAUCE (to serve with Boast Turkey, Fov^rl, Game, &c.). I. 371. Ingeedients.—1 pint of milk, fib. of the crumb of a stale loaf, 1 onion; pounded mace, cayenne, and salt to taste; 1 oz. of butter. Mode.—Peel and quarter the onion, and simmer it in the milk till perfectly tender. Break the bread, which should be stale, into small pieces, carefully picking out any hard outside pieces; put it in a very BLACK PEPPEB,MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKLRY. clean saucepan, strain the milk over it, cover it up, and let it remain for an hour to soak. Now beat it up with a fork very smoothly, add a seasoning of pounded mace, cayenne, and salt, with 1 oz. of butter ; give the whole one boil, and serve. To enrich this sauce, a small quantity of cream may be added just before sending it to table. Time.—Altogether, if hour. Average cost for this quantity, 4c?. Sufficie7it to serve with a turkey, pair of fowls, or brace of partridges. Mace.—This is the membrane which surrounds the shell of the nutmeg. Its general qualities are the same as those of the nutmeg, producing an agreeable aromatic odour, with a hot and acrid taste. It is of an oleaginous nature, is yellowish in its hue, and is used largely as a condiment. In "Beeton's Dictionary" we find that ^ the four largest of the Banda Islands produce 150,000 lbs. of it annually, which, with nutmegs, are their principal articles of export. II. 372. Ingrediexts.—Giblets of poultry, f lb. of the crumb of a stale loaf, 1 onion, 12 whole peppers, 1 blade of mace, salt to taste, 2 tablespoonfuls of cream or melted butter, 1 pint of water. Mode.—Put the giblets, with the head, neck, legs, (S:c., into a stewpan; add the onion, pepper, mace, salt, and rather more than 1 pint of water. Let this simmer for an hour, when strain the liquor over the bread, which should be previously grated or broken into small pieces. Cover up the saucepan, and leave it for an hour by the side of the fire ; then beat the sauce up with a fork until no lumps remain, and the whole is nice and smooth.

BHOWiraTG FOR GRAVIES AISTD SAUCES. 373. The browning for soups {see "No. 108) answers equally well for sauces and gravies, when it is absolutely necessary to colour them in this manner; but where they can be made to look brown by using ketchup, wine, browned flour, tomatoes, or any colour sauce, it is far preferable. As, however, in cooking, so much depends on appearance, perhaps it would be as well for the inexperienced cook to use the artificial means (No. 108). When no browning is at hand, and you wish to heighten the colour of your gravy, dissolve a lump of sugar in an iron spoon over a sharp fire ; when it is in a liquid state, drop it into the sauce or gravy quite hot. Care, however, must be taken not to put in too much, as it would impart a very disagreeable flavour.SAUCES, ETC. 185 BEURRE NOIB, or BROWNED BUTTEB (a French Sauce). 374. Ingredients.—|lb. of butter, 1 tablespoonful of minced pars- ley, 3 tablespoonfuls of vinegar, salt and pepper to taste. 3Iode.—Put the butter into a fryingpan over a nice clear fire, and TV'hen it smokes, throw in the parsley, and add the vinegar and seasoning. Let the whole simmer for a minute or two, when it is ready to serve. This is a very good sauce for skate. Time.—\ hour. CLARIFIED BUTTER. 375. Put the butter in a basin before the fire, and when it melts, stir it round once or twice, and let it settle. Da not strain it unless absolutely necessary, as it causes so much waste. Pour it gently oif into a clean dry jar, carefully leaving all sediment behind. Let it cool, and carefully exclude the air by means of a bladder, or piece of Vv ash-leather, tied over. If the butter is salt, it may be washed before melting, when it is to be used for sweet dishes. MELTED BUTTER. I. 376. Ingredients.—\ lb. of butter, a dessertspoonful of flour, 1 wineglassful of water, salt to taste. 3fode.—Cut the butter up into small pieces, put it in a saucepan, dredge over the flour, and add the water and a seasoning of salt; stir it one icay constantly till the whole of the ingredients are melted and thoroughly blended. Let it just boil, when it is ready to serve. If the butter is to be melted with cream, use the same quantity as of water, but omit the flour; keep stirring it, but do not allow it to boil.

We find it stated in " Beeton's Dictionary of Universal Inform- ation," under the article *' Banda Islands," that the four largest are appropriated to the cultivation of nutmegs, of which about 500,000 lbs. are annually produced. The plant, through the enterprise of the British, has now found its way into Penang and Bencoolen, where it flourishes and pro- duces well. It has also been tried to be naturalized in the West Indies, and it bears fruit all the year round. There are IHS NUTMEG. two kinds of nutmeg,—one vfild, and long and oval-shaped, the other cultivated, and nearly round. The best is firm and bard, and has a strong aromatic odour, with a hot and acrid taste. It ought to be used ■virith caution by those who are of paralytic or apoplectic habits. THICKENED BUTTER. 379. Ingredients.—J pint of melted butter, Ko. 376, the yolks of 2 eggs, a little lemon-juice. Ifode—M^ke the butter quite hot, and be careful not to colour it. Yiell whisk the yolks of the eggs, pour them to the butter, beating them all the while. Make the sauce hot over the fire, but do not let it boil; add a squeeze of lemon-juice. MELTED BUTTER MADE WITH MILK. 380. Ingeedients.—1 teaspoonful of fiour, 2 oz. butter, 5 pint of milk, a few grains of salt. 3fode.—KiK the butter and flour smoothly together on a plate, put it into a lined saucepan, and pour in the milk. Keep stirring it one tvai/ovev a sharp fire; let it boil quickly for a minute or two, and it is ready to serve.

This sauce may be made brown by using gravy instead of white stock, and flavouring it with mushroom ketchup or Harvey*s sauce. Aeeoweoot.—This nutritious fecula is obtained from the roots of a plant which is cultivated in both the East and West Indies. When the roots are about a year old, they are dug up, and, after being well washed, are beaten to a pulp, which is afterwards, by means of water, sepa- rated from the fibrous part. After being passed through a sieve, once more washed, and then suffered to settle, the sediment is dried in the sun, when it has become arrowroot. The best is obtained from the West Indies, but a large quantity of what is sold in London is adul- terated with potato-starch. As a means of knowing arrowroot when it is good, it may be as well to state, that the genuine article, when formed into a jelly, will ^remain firm for three or four days, whilst the adulterated will become as thin as milk in the course of twelve hours.

Ingredients.—1J lbs. of moist sugar, | lb. of salt, | lb. of garlic, i lb. of onions, i lb. of powdered ginger, i lb. of dried chilies, % lb. of mustard-seed, | lb. of stoned raisins, 2 bottles of best vinegar, 30 large unripe sour apples. Mode.—The sugar must be made into syrup ; the garlic, onions, and ginger be finely pounded in a mortar; the mustard-seed be washed in cold vinegar, and dried in the sun ; the apples be peeled, cored, and sliced, and boiled in a bottle and a half of the vinegar. "When all this is done, and the apples are quite cold, put them into a large pan, and gradually mix the whole of the rest of the ingredients, including the remaining half-hot tie of vinegar. It must be well stirred until the whole is thoroughly blended, and then put into bottles for use. Tie a piece of wet bladder over the mouths of the bottles, after they are well corked. This chetney is very superior to any which can be bought, and one trial will prove it to be delicious. Note.—This recipe was given by a native to an English lacly, who had long been a resident in India, and who, since her return to her native country, has become quite celebrated amongst her friends for the excellence of this Eastern relish. Gaklic.—The smell of this plant is generally considered oSensive, and it is the most acrimonious in its taste of the whole of the alliaceous tribe. In 1548 it was introduced to England from the shores of the Mediterranean, where it is GAELIC, abundant, and in Sicily it grows naturally. It was in greater repute with our ancestors than it is with ourselves, although it is still used as a seasoning herb. On the continent, especially in Italy, it is much used, and the French consider it an essential in many made dishes.BAUCES, ETC. 191 CHILI VINEQAB. 393. Ingkedients.—50 fresh red Englisli chilies, 1 pint of vinegar. 3Iode.—Pound or cut the chilies in half, and infuse them in the vinegar for a fortnight, when it will be fit for use.

In a short time, boil up the vinegar again, add pep- per and ginger in the above proportion* and instantly cover them up. Tie them down with bladder, and in a few days they will be fit for use. Long Pepper.—This is the produce of a different plant from that which produces the black, it consisting of the half-ripe flower-heads of what naturalists call Fiper longum and cliaha. It is the gi'owth, however, of the same countries; indeed, all the spices are tho produce of tropical climates only. Originally, tho most valuable of these were found in the Spice Islands, or Moluccas, of the Indian Ocean, and were highly •„-r,»T,T,-r, prized by the nations of antiquity. The Romans in- LONG PEPPER. dulged in them to a most extravagant degree. The long pepper is less aromatic than the black, but its oil is more pungent. CUCUMBER SAUCE, WHITE. 400.

Ingredients.—Cucumbers, salt. Mode.—Pare and slice the cucumbers (as for the table), sprinkle well with salt, and let them remain for 24 hours ; strain oif the liquor, pack in jars, a thick layer of cucumbers and salt alternately ; tie down closely, and, when wanted for use, take out the quantity re- quired. Now wash them well in fresh water, and dress as usual with pepper, vinegar, and oil. The Cucumber.—Though the melon is far superior in point of flavour to this fruit, yet it is allied to the cucumber, which is know^n to naturalists as Cucumis sativus. The modern Egyptians, as did their fore- ^j,^ C'^^cuiibe'R fathers, still eat it, and others of its class. Cucumbers " ^ ^'^ were observed, too, by Bishop Heber, beyond the Gauges, in India; and Burchhardfc noticed them in Palestine. {See No. 137.) AKT EXCELLENT WAY OF PHESEBVIITa CUCUMBERS. 403.

If they are not a fine green, change the water again, cover them as before, and make them hot. When they are a good colour, take them off the fire and let them cool; cut them in quarters, take out the seeds and pulp, and put them into cold water. Let them remain for 2 days, changing the water twice each day, to draw out the salt. Put the sugar, with | pint of water, in a saucepan over the fire ; remove the scum as it rises, and add the lemon-peel and ginger with the outside scraped off; when the syrup is tolerably thick, take it off the fire, and when cold^ wipe the cucumbers dry, and put them in. Boil the syrup once in 2 or 3 days for 3 weeks; strengthen it if required^ and let it be quite cold before the cucumbers are put in. Great attention must be paid to the directions in the commencement of this recipe, as, if these are not properly carried out, the result will be far from satisfactory. Seasonable.—This recipe should be used in June, July, or August. Common Salt.—By tliis we mean salt used for cooking purposes, whicli is found in great abundance both on land and in the waters of the ocean. Sea or salt water, as it is often called, contains, it has been, discovered, about three per cent, of salt on an average. Sohd rocks of salt are also found in various parts of the world, and the county of Chester contains many of these mines, and it is from there that much of our salt comes. Some springs are so highly impregnated with salt, as to have received the name of "brine" springs, and are supposed to have become so by passing through the salt rocks below ground, and thus dissolving a portion SALT-MINE AT NOHTHWICH. of this mineral substance. We here give an engraving of a salt-mine at ITorthwich, Cheshire, where both salt-mines and brine-springs are exceedingly pro- ductive, and are believed to have been wrought so far back as during the oo« ,npation of Britain by the Komans.

In"geedients.—J teaspoonful of flour, 2 oz. of butter, 4 table- spoonfuls of vinegar, the yolks of 2 eggs, the juice of i lemon; salt to taste. Mode.—Put all the ingredients, except the lemon-juice, into a stew- pan ; set it over the fire, and keep continually stirring. "When it is sufficiently thick, take it ofi', as it should not boil. If, however, it happens to curdle, strain the sauce through a tammy, add the lemon- juice, and serve. Tarragon vinegar may be used instead of plain, and, by many, is considered far preferable. Average cost, 6d. Note. — This sauce may be poured hot over salad, and left to get quite cold, when it should be tliick, smooth, and somewhat stiff. Excel- lent salads may be made of hard eggs, or the remains of salt fish flaked nicely from the bone, by pouring over a little of the above mixture when hot, and allowing it to cool. The Lemoit.—This fruit is a native of Asia, and is mentioned by Virgil as an antidote to poison. It is hardier than the orange, and, as one of the citron tribe, was brought into Europe by the Arabians. The lemon was first cultivated in England in the beginning of the 17th century, and is novi^ often to be found in our green- houses. The kind commonly sold, however, is imported from Portugal, Spain, and the Azores. Some also come from St. Helena; but those from Spain are esteemed the best. Its juice is now an essential for culinary purposes ; but as an antiscorbutic its value is still greater. This juice, which TnE LE^iOir. is called citric acid, may be preserved in bottles for a con- siderable tune, by covering it vvitii a thin stratum of oil. Shruh is made from it with rum and sugar, GBSEIT DUTCH SAUCE, or HOLLAISTDAISE VEETE. 406. Ingbedients.—6 tablespoonfuls of Bechamel, No. 367, season- ing to taste of salt and cayenne, a little parsley-green to colour, the juice of J a lemon.

A moment before serving-, put in the lemon- juice, but not before ; for otherwise the sauce would turn yellow, and its appearance be thus spoiled. Average cost, id. Bechamel Sauce.—This sauce takes its name from a Monsieur Bechamel, a rich French financier, who, according to some authorities, invented it; whilst others affirm he only patronized it. Be this as it may, it is one of the most pleasant sauces Avhich come to table, and should be most carefully and intelligently prepared. It is frequently used, as in the above recipe, as a principal ingredient and basis for other sauces. TO PICKLE EGGS. 407. Ingeedients.—16 egg's, 1 quart of vinegar, i oz. of Dlack pepper, | oz. of Jamaica pepper, | oz. of ginger. Mode.—Boil the eggs for 12 minutes, then dip them into cold water, and take off the shells.

Average cost, for this quantity. Is. 9cf. Seasonable.—This should be made about Easter, as at this time eggs are plentiful and cheap. A store of pickled eggs will be found very useful and ornamental in serving with many first and second course dishes. Ginger.—The ginger-plant, known to naturalists as Zingiber officinale, is a native of the East and West Indies. It grows somevr^hat like the lily of the valley, but its height is about three feet. In Jamaica it flowers about August or September, fading about the end of the year. The fleshy creeping roots, which form the ginger of commerce, are in a proper state to be dug when the stalks are entirely withered. This operation is usually ''i'Xi^k^^ performed in January and February; and when the roots are *' taken out of the earth, each one is picked, scraped, separately G-lNGEE. washed, and afterwards very carefully dried. G-inger is gene- rally considered as less pungent and heating to the system than might be expected from its eflects on the organs of taste, and it is frequently used, with considerable efleet, as an anti-spasmodic and carminative.

Shalot, or Eschalot.—Tliis plant is supposed to have been introduced to England by the Crusaders, who found it growing wild in the vicinity of Ascalon. It is a bulbous root, and when full groAvn, its leaves wither in July. They ought to be taken up in the autumn, and. when dried in the house, will keep till spring.

Ingredients.—2 oz. of ham or lean bacon-, J lb. of suet, the rind of half a lemon, 1 teaspoonful of minced parsley, 1 teaspoonful of minced sweet herbs; salt, cayenne, and pounded mace to taste; 6 oz. of bread crumbs, 2 eggs. Ifode.—Shred the ham or bacon, chop the suet, lemon-peel, and herbs, taking particular care that all be very finely minced; add a seasoning to taste, of salt, cayenne, and mace, and blend all thoroughly together with the bread crumbs, before wetting. Now beat and strain the eggs, work these up with the other ingredients, and the force- meat will be ready for use. When it is made into balls, fry of a nice brown, in boiling lard, or put them on a tin and bake for i hour in a moderate oven. As we have stated before, no one flavour should predominate greatly, and the forcemeat should be of sufficient body to cut with a knife, and yet not dry and heavy. For very delicate forcemeat, it is advisable to pound the ingredients together before binding with the egg ; but for ordinary cooking, mincing very finely answers the purpose. Average cost, Sd. Sufficient for a turkey, a moderate-sized fillet of veal, or a hare. Jj ^ Note.—In forcemeat for Hare, the liver of tlie animal is sometimes added. Boil for 5 minutes, mince it very small, and mix it with the other ingre- dients. If it should be in an misound state, it nrost be on no accovmt made use of. Sweet Herbs.—Those most usually employed for piii'- poses of cooldng, such as the flavouring of soups, sauces, forcemeats, &c., are thyme, sage, mint, marjoram, savory, and basil. Other sweet herbs are cultivated for purposes of medicine and perfumery: they are most grateful botli to the organs of taste and smelling; and to the aroma ^ derived from them is due, in a great measure, the sweet j and exhilarating fragrance of our " flowery meads." In ( BASIL. town, sweet herbs have to be procured at the greengrocers' or herbalists', whilst, in the country, the garden should , furnish aU that are wanted, the cook taking great care to have some dried in the autuma ; for her use throughout the winter months. |SAUCES; ETC. 201 FOKCEMEAT FOS BAKED PIKE. 418.

It will be well to state, in the beginning of this recipe, that French forcemeat, or quenelles, consist of the blending of three separate pro- cesses ; namely, panada, udder, and whatever meat you intend usingo Panada. 420. iNaEEDiENTS.—The crumb of 2 penny rolls, 4 tabiespoonfuls of white stock, JSTo. 107, 1 oz. of butter, I slice of ham, 1 bay-leaf, a little minced parsley, 2 shalots, 1 clove, 2 blades of mace, a few mushrooms (when obtainable), butter, the yolks of 2 eggs. Mode.—Soak the crumb of the rolls in milk for about J hour^ then take it out, and squeeze so as to press the milk from it; put the soaked bread into a stewpan with the above quantity of white stock, and set it on one side ; then put into a separate stewpan 1 oz. of butter, a slice of lean ham cut small, with a bay-leaf, herbs, mush- rooms, spices, &c., in the above proportions, and fry them gently over a slow fire. When done, moisten with 2 teacupfals of white stocky boil for 20 minutes, and strain the whole througli a sieve over the panada in the other stewpan. Place it over the fire, keep constantly stirring, to prevent its burning, and when quite dry, put in a small piece of butter. Let this again dry up by stirring over the fire ; then, add the yolks of 2 eggs, mix well, put the panada to cool on a clean plate, and use it when required. Panada should always be v/ell flavoured, as the forcemeat receives no ta^te from any of the other ingredients used in its preparation. Boiled Calf's Udder for French. Forcemeats. 421.

That portion which passes through the strainer is one of the three ingredients of which French forcemeats are generally composed; but many cooks substitute butter for this, being a less troublesome and more expeditious mode of prepara- tion. Pestle and Moetae.—ITo cookery can be perfectly performed witliout tlie aid of the useful instruments shown in the engraving. PESTLE AITD MOETAE. For pounding things Sufficiently fine, they are invaluable, and the use of them will save a good deal of time, besides increasing the excellence of the preparations. They are made of iron, and, in that material, can be bought cheap ; but as these are not available for all purposes, "vve should recommend, as more economical in the end, those made of Wedgwood, although these are considerably more expensive than the former. Veal Quenelles. 422. Ingredients.—Equal quantities of veal, panada (No. 420), and calf's udder (Ko. 421), 2 eggs; seasoning to taste of pepper, salt, and pounded mace, or grated nutmeg ; a little flour. Mode—Take the fleshy part of veal, scrape it with a knife, till all the meat is separated from the sinevfs, and allow about | lb. for an entree. Chop the meat, and pound it in a mortar till reduced to a paste ; then roll it into a ball; make another of panada (No. 420), the same size, and another of udder (No. 421), taking care that these three balls be of the same size. It is to be remembered, that equality of size, and not of weight, is here necessary. When the three ingredients are properly prepared, pound them altogether in a mortar for some time; for the more quenelles are pounded, the more delicate the^^ are. Now moisten with the eggs, whites and yolks, and continue pounding, adding a seasoning of pepper, spices, &c. When the whole is well blended together, mould it into balls, or whatever shape is intended, roll them in flour, and poach in boiling water, to which a little salt should have been added. If the quenelles are not firm enough, add the yolk of another egg, but omit the white, which only makes them hollow and puffy inside. In the preparation of this recipe, it would be well to bear in mind that the ingredients are to be well pounded and seasoned, and must be made hard or soft according to the dishes they are intended for. For brown or white ragouts they should be firm, and when the quenelles are used very small, extreme delicacy will be necessary in their preparation. Their flavour may be varied by using the flesh of rabbit, fowl, hare, pheasant, grouse, or an extra quantity of mushroom, parsley, &c.SAUCES, ETC. 203 Time,—x4.boiit \ hour to poach in boiling water. Sufficient, J lb. of veal or other meat, with other ingredients in pro- portion, for 1 entree. Note.—The French are noted for their skill in making forcemeats; one of the principal causes of their superiority in this respect being, that they pound all the ingredients so diligently and thoroughly. Any one with the slightest Xiretensions to refined cookery, must, in this particular, implicitly follow tho example of our friends across the Channel.

When well mixed, take a small piece in a spoon, and poach it in some boiling water; and if it is delicate, fii'm, and of a good flavour, it is ready for use. PBIED BBEAD CBUMBS. 424. Cut the bread into thin slices, place them in a cool wen over- night, and when thoroughly dry and crisp, roll them down into fine crumbs. Put some lard, or clarified dripping, into a frjdng-pan; bring it to the boiling-point, throw in the crumbs, and fry them very quickly. Directly they are done, lift them out with a slice, and drain them before the fire from all greasy moisture. When quite crisp, they are ready for use. The fat they are fried in should be clear, and the crumbs should not have the slightest appearance or taste of having been, in the least degree, burnt.

Ingeedients.—1 small carrot, a small faggot of sweet licrbs, including parslej-, 1 onion, 5 or 6 mushrooms (when obtainable), 1 bay- leaf, 6 cloves, 1 blade of mace, 2 oz. of butler, 1 glass of sherry, li- pint of Y/hite stock, No. 107, thickening of butter and flour, the juice of half a lemon. Mode.—Cut up the onion and carrot into small rings, and put them into a stewpan with the herbs, mushrooms, bay-leaf, cloves, and mace ; add the butter, and simmer the whole very gently over a slow Are until the onion is quite tender. Pour in the stock and sherry, and stew slowly for 1 hour, when strain it ofl" into a clean saucepan.

Twie.—iiltogethex 2 hours. Average cost, Is. Zd per pint. Sufficient, half this quantity for two slices of salmon. Sage.—This was originally a native of the south of Europe, but it has long been cultivated in the English garden. There arc several kinds of it, known as the green, the red, the SAGE. small-leaved, and the broad-leaved balsanyic. In cookery, its principal use is for stuffings and' sauces, for which purpose the red is the most agreeable, and the green the next. The others are used for medical purposes. 428. INGEEDIENTS.—Salt and water, 1 oz. of bruised ginger, -h oz of whole black pepper, J oz. of whole allspice, 4 cloves, 2 blades of mace, a little horseradish. This proportion of pepper, spices, &c., for 1 quart of vinegar. Mode.—IjQt the gherkins remain in salt and water for 3 or 4 days, when take them out, wipe perfectly dry, and put them into a stone jar. Boil sufficient vinegar to cover them, with spices and pep-205 SAUCES, ETC. pour it, quite per, &c., in the above proportion, for 10 minutes; boiling", over the gherkins, cover the jar with vine-leaves, and put over them a plate, setting them near the fire, where they must remain all night. Next day drain off the vinegar, boil it up again, and pour it hot over them. Cover up with fresh leaves, and let the whole remain till quite cold. E"ow tie down closely with bladder to exclude the air, and in a month or two, they will be fit for use. Time.—4 days. Seasonable from the middle of July to the end of August. Gheukins.—Gherkins are young cucumbers; and the only way in which they are used for cooking purposes is Gheekin^S pickling them, as by the recipe here given. Not having arrived at maturity, they have not, of course, so strongly a developed flavour as cucumbers, and, as a pickle, they are very general favourites. GOOSEBEHRY SAUCE FOB BOILED MACKEBEL. 429. Ingredients.—1 pint of green gooseberries, 3 tablespoonfuls of Bechamel, No. 3G7 (veal gravy may be substituted for this), 2 oz. of fresh butter; seasoning to taste of salt, pepper, and grated nutmeg. Mode.—Boil the gooseberries in water until quite tender; strain them, and rub them through a sieve. Put into a saucepan the Bechamel or gravy, with the butter and seasoning ; add the pulp from the gooseberries, mix all v/ell together, and heat gradually through. A little pounded sugar added to this sauce is by many persons con- sidered an improvement, as the saccharine matter takes off the extreme acidity of the unripe fruit. Ti7ne.—Boil the gooseberries from 20 minutes to -J hour. Sufficient, this quantity, for a large dish of mackerel. SeasonoMe from May to July. The Goosebeest.—This useful and wholesome fruit (Hibes p'ossiilaria) is thought to be indigenous to the British Isles, and may be occasionally found in a wild state in some of the eastern counties, although, when unculti- vated, it is but a very small and inferior berry. The high state of perfection to which it has been here brought, is due to the skill of the English gardeners; for in no other country does it attain the same size and flavour. The humidity of the British climate, however, has doubtless something to do with the result; and it is said that gooseberries produced in Scotland as far north as Inverness, are of a very superior character. Malic and citric ncid blended with sugar, pro- duce the pleasant flavour of the gooseberry; and upon the proper development of these xjroperties depends the success of all cooking operations with which they are connected. THE GOOSESBKar.20o MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. GLAZE FOil COVEBIKG COLD HAM8, TONGUES, &g. 4^. Ii^TGEEDiENTS.—Stock Ko. 104 or 107, doubling the quantity of meat in eacl"!. Mode.—We may remark at tlie outset, tliat unless glaze is wanted in very large quantities, it is seldom made expressly. Either of the stocks mentioned above, boiled down and reduced very considerably^ will be found to produce a very g-ood glaze. Put the stock into a stewpan, over a nice clear fire ; let it boil till it becomes somevv^hat stiff, Avhen keep stirring, to prevent its burning. The moment it is sufficiently reduced, and comes to a glaze, turn it out into the glaze- pot, of which we have here given an engraving. As, however, this is not to be found in every establishment, a white earthenware jar would answer the purpose ; and this may be placed in a vessel of boiling water, to melt the glaze when required. It sliould never be warmed in a saucepan, except on the principle of the bain marie, lest it should reduce too much, and become black and bitter. If the glaze is wanted of a pale colour, more veal than beef should be used in making the stock ; and it is as well to omit turnips and celery, as these impart a disagreeable bitter flavour. To Glaze Cold Joints, &c.—Melt the glaze by placing the vessel which contains it^ into the bain marie or saucepan of boiling water ; brush it over the meat with a paste- brush, and if in places it is not quite covered, repeat the operation. The glaze should not be too dark a colour. (See Coloured Cut oi Glazed Ham, P.) Glaze-Kettle.—This is a kettle used for keep- ing the strong stock boiled down to a jelly, which is known by the name of glaze, it is composed of two tin vessels, as shown in the cut, one of which, the upper,—containing the glaze, is inserted into one of larger diameter and containing boiling water, A brush is put in the small hole at the top of the hd, and is emiDloyed for putting the glaze on anything that may require it. The Bain Marie.—So long ago as the time when emperors ruled in Eome, and the yellow Tiber passed through a j)opulous and wealthy city, this utensil was extensively em- ployed ; and it is frequently mentioned by that profound culinary chemist of the ancients, Api- cius. It is an open kind of vessel (as shown in the engraving and explained in our paragraph IS'o. 87, on the French terms used in modern cookery), filled with boiling or nearly boiUng water; and into this water should be put all the stewpans containing those ingredients which it is desired to keep hot. The quantity and quality of the contents of these vessels are not at all all'ected: and if the hour of dinner is uncertain in any establishment, by reason of the nature of the master's business, nothing is eo certain a means of preserving the flavour of aU dishes as the employment of the bain marie. GLAZE-KETTLE. THE BAIN MAEIE.SAUCES^ ETC. 207 GKESlSr SAUCE FOR GREEN GEESE OR DUCKLINGS. 431. Ingeedients.—I pint of sorrel-juice, 1 glass of slierry, ^ pint of green gooseberries, 1 teaspoonful of pounded sugar, 1 oz. of fresh butter. Mode.—Boil the gooseberries in water until they are quite tender ; mash them and press them through a sieve; put the pulp into a saucepan with the above ingredients; simmer for 3 or 4 minutes, and serve very hot. Time.—Z or 4 minutes. Note.—We have given this recipe as a sance for green geese, thinking that some of our readers might sometimes require it; but, at the generality of fashionable tables, it is now seldom or never served. SoEREL.—We gather from the pages of Pliny and Api- cius, that sorrel was cultivated by the Eomans in order to give it more strength and flavour, and that they also partook of it sometimes stevred with mustard, being seasoned with a little oil and vinegar. At the present day, English cookery is not much indebted to this plant (Rumex Ace- tosa), although the French make use of it to a considerable SOriiel. extent. It is found in most parts of G-reat Britain, and also on the continent, groAving wild in the grass meadows, and, in a few gardens, it is culti- vated. The acid of sorrel is very ^roMomce, and is what chemists term a binoxalate of potash; that is, a combination of oxalic acid with potash. GENERAL STOCK FOR GRAVIES. 432. Either of the stocks, Nos. 104, 105, or 107, will be found to answer very well for the basis of many gravies, unless these are s!wanted very rich indeed. By the addition of various store sauces, thickening and flavouring, the stocks here referred to may be con- verted into very good gravies. It should be borne in mind, however, that the goodness and strength of spices, wines, flavourings, &c.^ evaporate, and that they lose a great deal of their fragrance, if added to the gravy a long time before they are wanted. If this point is attended to, a saving of one half the quantity of these ingredients will be eliected, as, with long boiling, the flavour almost entirely passes away. The shank-bones of mutton, previously well soaked^ will be found a great assistance in enriching gravies; a kidney or melt, beef skirt, trimmings of meat, &c. &c., answer very well vv^hen only a small quantity is wanted, and, as we have before observed, a good gravy need not necessarily be so very expensive ; for economi- cally-prepared dishes are oftentimes found as savoury and wholesom.e as dearer ones. The cook should also remember that the fragrance of gravies should not be overpowered by too much spice, or any strong essences, and that they should always be warmed in a ham may-ie, aftei203 MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. they are flavoured, or else in a jar or jug placed in a saucepan full of boiling water. The remains of roast-meat gravy should always be saved; as, when no meat is at hand, a very nice gravy in haste may be made from it, and when added to hashes, ragouts, &c., is a great improvement. Gravy-Kettle. — This is a utensii •wliich will not be found in every kitchen ; but it is a useful one where it is necessary to ];eep gravies hot for the purpose of pouring over various dishes as they are cooldng. It is made of copper, and should, consequently, be heated over the hot plate, if there be one, or a charcoal stove. The price at wliich it can be purchased is set down by Messrs. Slack at 14s. GBAVY-EETTLE. GBAVY FOB BOAST MEAT. 433. Ii^GEEDiENTS.—Gravy, salt. Mode,—Put a common dish with a small quantity of salt in it under the meat, about a quarter of an hour before it is removed from the fire. "When the dish is full, take it away, baste the meat, and pour the gravy into the dish on which the joint is to be served. Sauces and Geavies iisr the Middle Ages.—JSTeither poultry, butcher's meat, nor roast game were eaten dry in the middle ages, any more than fried fish is now. Different sauces, each having its own peculiar flavour, were served with all these dishes, and even •with the various mparts of each animal. Strange and grotesque sauces, as, for example, *'eggs cooked on the spit," butter fried and roasted," were invented by the cooks of those days; but these preparations had hardly any other merit than that of being surprising and difficult to make. A QUICKLY-MADE GBAVY. 434. Inghedients.—I lb. of shin of beef, i onion, \ carrot, 2 or 3 sprigs of parsley and savoury herbs, a piece of butter about the size of a walnut; cayenne and mace to taste, f pint of water.

A quickly-made gravy, under some circumstances that we have liuown occur, will be useful to many housekeepers when tliey have not much time for preparation. But, talking of speed, and time, and preparation, what a combination of all these must have been necessary for the feast at the wedding of Charles VI. of France. On that occasion, as Froissart the chronicler tells us, the art of cooking, with its in- numerable paraphernalia of sauces, with gravy, pepper, cinnamon, garlic, scallion, brains, gravy soups, rmWi. potage, and ragoiits, had a signal triumph. The skilful cZfe/*- de-cuisine of the royal houseliold covered the great marble table of the regal palace with no less than a hundred different dishes, prepared in a hundred different ways.200 SAUCES, ETC.

Cloves.—This very agreeable spice is the uuexpanded flower-buds of the CaryopliyUns nromaticus, a handsome branching tree, a native of the Malacca Islands. They take their name from the Latin word davus, or the French clou, both meaning a nail, and to which the clove has a considerable resemblance. Cloves were but little known to the ancients, and Pliny appears to be the only writer who mentions them; and he says, vaguely enough, that some were brought to Eome, veiy similar to grains of pepper, but som-cvvhat longer ; that they were only to be found in India, in a wood consecrated to the gods ; and that they served in the nmnufacture of perfumes. The Dutch, as in the case of the nutmeg (see 378), endeavoured, when they gained possession of the Spice Islands, to securo a monopoly of cloves, and, so that the cultivation of the tree might be confined to Amboyna, their chief island, bribed the surrounding chiefs to cut down all trees found elsewhere. The Amboyna, or royal clove, is said to be the best, and is rare ; bu t other kinds, nearly equally good, are jDi'oduced in other parts of the world, and they como to Europe from Mauritius, Bourbon, Cayenne, and Martinique, as also from St. Kilts, P210 MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY.

Ingredients.—2 lbs. of shin of beef, i lb. of lean ham, 1 onion or a few shalots, 2 pints of water, salt and whole pepper to taste, 1 blade of mace, a faggot of savoury herbs, | a large carrot, i a head of celery. Mode.—-Out up the beef and ham into sniall pieces, and slice the vegetables; take a jar, capable of holding two pints of water, and arrange therein, in layers, the ham, meat, vegetables, and seasoning, p 2212 MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY, alternately, filling up with the above quantity of water; tie down the jar, or put a plate over the top, so that the steam may not escape; place it in the oven, and let it remain there from 6 to 8 hours ; should, however, the oven be very hot, less time will be required. When sufliciently cooked, strain the gravy, and when cold, remove the fat. It may be flavoured with ketchup, T\^ines, or any other store sauce that may be preferred; It is a good plan to put the jar in a cool oven over-night, to draw the gravy; and then it will not require so long baking the following day. Time. — From 6 to 8 hours, according to the oven. Average costy Id. per pint. Celery.—As in the above recipe, tlie roots of celery are principally used in England for flavouring soups, sauces, and gravies, and for serving with cheese at the termination of a dinner, and as an ingredient for salad. In Italy, however, the green leaves and stems are also employed for stews and soups, and the seeds are al o more frequently made use of on the continent than in our own islands. In Germany, celery is ve.ry highly esteemed; and it is there boiled and served up as a dish by itself, as well as used in the composition of mixed dishes. We ourselves tliink that this mild aromatic plant might oftener be cooked than it is; for there are very few nicer vegetable preparations brought to table than a well-dressed plate of stewed celery. VEAIi GRAVY- FOB WHITE SAUCES, FEIOASSEES, &c. 442. Ingeedients.—2 slices of nicely flavoured lean ham, any poultry trimmings, 3 lbs. of lean veal, a faggot of savoury herbs, including parsley, a few green onions (or 1 large onion may be substituted for these), a few mushrooms, when obtainable ; 1 blade of mace, salt to taste, 3 pints of water. Mode.—Cut up the ham and veal into small square pieces, put these in a stewpan, moistening them with a small quantity of water ; place them over the fire to draw down. When the bottom of the stewpan becomes covered with a white glaze, fill up with water in the above proportion; add the remaining ingredients, stew very slowly for 3 or 4 hours, and do not forget to skim well the moment it boils. Put it by, and, when cold, take ofi* all the fat. This may be used for Be- chamel, sauce tournee, and many other white sauces. Tinie.—Z or 4 hours. Average cost, 9d. per pint.

Add a thickening of butter and flour, and the lemon-juice ; set it on the fire, and let it just boil up, when it will be ready for use. It may be flavoured with a little tomato sauce, and, where a rather dark-coloured gravy is not objected to, ketchup, or Harvey's sauce, may be added at pleasure. Time.—liath.eT more than 1 hour.

IisGPvEDiEKTS.—Trimmings of venison, 3 or 4 mutton shank- bones, salt to taste, 1 pint of water, 2 teaspoonfuls of walnut ketchup. ? 3fode.—Brown the trimmings over a nice clear fire, and put them in a stewpan with the shank-bones and water ; simmer gently for 2 hours, strain and skim, and add the walnut ketchup and a seasoning of salt. Let it just boil, when it is ready to serve. Tt7ne.—2 hours. Vejtisoit.—Far, far away in ages past, our fathers loved the chase, and what it brought; and it is usually imagined that when Isaac otdered his son Esau to go out with his weapons, his quiver and his bow, and to prepare for him savoury meat, such as he loved, that it was venison he desired. The vase Solomon, too, delighted in this kind of fare; for we learn that, at his table, every day were served the vnld ox, the roebuck, and the stag. Xenophon informs us, in his History, that Cyrus, king of Persia, ordered that the beer. venison should never bo wanting at his repasts; and of the effeminate Greeks it was the dehght. The Komans, also, were devoted admirers of the flesh of the deer; and our own kings and princes, from the Great Alfred down to the Prince Consort, have hunted, although, it must be confessed, vinder vastly different circumstances, the swift buck, and relished their "haunch" all the more keenly, that they had borne themselves bravely in the pursuit of the animal. TO DUY HBBBS FOB WINTER USE. 445. On a very dry day, gather the herbs, just before they begin to flower. If this is done when the weather is damp, the herbs will not be so good a colour. (It is very necessary to be particular in little matters like this, for trifles constitute perfection, and herbs nicely diie 1 will be found very acceptable when frost and snow are on the ground. It is hardly necessary, however, to state that the flavour and fragrance of fresh herbs are incomparably finer.) They should be perfectly freed from dirt and dust, and be divided into small bunches, with their roots cut ofi". Dry them quickly in a very hot oven, or before the fire, as by this means most of their flavour will be preserved, and be carefulMODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. 2U not to burn them; tie them up in paper bags, and keep in a dry plaj^e. This is a very general way of preserving dried herbs ; but we would recommend the plan described in a former recipe. Seasonable.—From the month of July to the end of September is the proper time for storing herbs for winter use. HERB POWDEB FOB FLAVOUBIlSra, wlien Fresh Herbs are not obtainable. 446. Iis^GREDiENTS.—1 oz. of dried lemon-thyme, 1 oz. of dried winter savory, 1 oz. of dried sweet marjoram and basil, 2 oz. of dried parsley, 1 oz. of dried lemon-peel. Mode.—Prepare and dry the herbs by recipe No. 445; pick the leaves from the stalks, pound them, and sift them through a hair-sieve; mix in the above proportions, and keep in glass bottles, carefully excluding the air. This, we think, a far better method of keeping herbs, as the flavour and fragrance do not evaporate so much as when they are merely put in paper bags. Preparing them in this way, you have them ready for use at a moment's notice. Mint, sage, parsley, &c., dried, pounded, and each put into separate bottles, will be found very useful in winter. COrvK WITH CoEKS WITH V/ooDEisT Tops.—Tliese are tlie best corks to use •WOODEK TOP. when it is indispensable tlia,t the air should not be admitted to the ingredients contained in bottles which are in constant use. The top, which, as will be seen by the accompanying .little cut, is larger than the cork, is made of wood; and, besides effectually covering the whole top of the bottle, can be easily removed and again used, as no corkscrew is necessary to pull it out. Savort.—This we find described by Columella, a voluminous Eoman writer on agri- culture, as an odoriferous herb, which, "in the brave days of old," entered into the seasoning of nearly every dish. Verily, there are but few new things under the sun, and we don't find that we have made many discoveries in gastronomy, at least beyond what was known to the ancient inhabitants of Italy. We possess two varieties of this aromatic herb, known to naturalists as Satureja. They are called summer and winter savory, according to the time of the year when they are fit for gathering. Both sorts are in general cultivation throughout England. HOBSEBADISH SAUCE, to serve with Boast Beef. 447. INGREDIE:^TTS.—4 tablespooufuls of grated horseradish, 1 tea- spoonful of pounded sugar, 1 teaspoonful of salt, i teaspoonful of pepper, 2 teaspoonfuls of made mustard ; vinegar. Mode,—Grate the horseradish, and mix it well with the sugar, salt, pepper, and mustard ; moisten it with sufficient vinegar to give it the consistency of cream, and serve in a tureen : 3 or 4 table- spoonfuls of cream added to the above, very much improve the appearance and flavour of this sauce. To heat it to serve with hot215 SAUCES^ ETC. roast beef, put it in a bain marie or a jar, which place in a saucepan of boiling water; make it hot, but do not allow it to boil, or it will curdle. ^i'S j}^ote.—This sauce is a great improvement on the old-fashioned way of serving cold-scraped horse- radish with hot roast beef. The mixing of the cold vinegar with the warm gravy cools and spoils every- thing on the plate. Of course, with cold meat, the sauce should be served cold. The Horseradish.—This has been, for many years, a faTourite accompaniment of roast beef, and is a native of England. It grows wild in wet ground, but has long been cultivated in the garden, and is, occasionally, used in winter salads and in sauces. On account of the great volatility of its oU, it should never be preserved by drying, but should be kept moist by being buried in sand. So rapidly does its volatile oil evaporate, that even when scraped for the table, it almost immediately spoils by exposure to the air. inE HORSERADISH. HOBSEBADISH VINSGAB. 448. Ingeedients.—J lb. of scraped horseradish, 1 oz. of minced shalot, 1 drachm of cayenne, 1 quart of vinegar. 3fode—Tut all the ingredients into a bottle, which shake well every day for a fortnight. When it is thoroughly steeped, strain and bottle, and it will be fit for use immediately. This will be found an agreeable relish to cold beef, &e. Seasonable.—This vinegar should be made either in October or ]N"ovember, as horseradish is then in its highest perfection. INDIAN CUBBY-POWDEK, founded on Dr. Kitchener's Becipe. 449. Ikgeedients.—J lb. of coriander-seed, i lb. of turmeric, 2 oz. of cinnamon-seed, i oz. of cayenne, 1 oz. of mustard, 1 oz. of ground ginger, J ounce of allspice, 2 oz. of fenugreek-seed. 3£ode.—Put all the ingredients in a cool oven, where they should remain one night; then pound them in a mortar, rub them through a sieve, and mix thoroughly together ; keep the powder in a bottle, from which the air should be completely excluded. Note.—We have given this recipe for curry-powder^ as some persons prefe, to make it at home ; but that purchased at any respectable shop is. generally speaking, far superior, and; taking ail things into consideration, very frequently more economical. INDIAN MUSTABD, an excellent Belisli to Bread and Butter, or any cold Meat. 450. lixGEEDiENTS.-—i lb. of the best mustard, i lb. of fiour, i oz.216 MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. of salt, 4 shalots, 4 tablespoonfuls of vinegar, 4 iaMespoonfals of ketchup, i bottle of anchovy sauce. 3Iode.—Put the mustard, flour, and salt into a basin, and make them into a stiff paste with boiling* water. Boil the shalots with the vinegar, ketchup, and anchovy sauce, for 10 minutes, and pour the whole, toiling^ over the mixture in the basin ; stir well, and reduce it to a proper thickness ; put it into a bottle, with a bruised shalot at the bottom, and store away for use. This makes an excellent relish, and if properly prepared will keep for years. Mustard.—Before the year 1729, mustard was not known at English tables. About tliat thne an old woman, of the name of Clements, residmg in Durham, began to grind the seed in a mill, and to pass the flour through several processes necessary to free the seed from its husks. She kept her secret for many years to herself, during which she sold large quantities of mustard through- out the country, but especially in London. Here it was introduced to the royal table, when it received the apiproval of George I. From the circumstance of Mrs. Clements being a resident at Durham, it obtained the name of Durham mustard. In the county of that name it is still principally cultivated, and the MUSTAED. plant is remarkable for the rapidity of its growth. It is the best stimulant employed to impart strength to the digestive organs, and even in its previously coarsely-pounded state, had a high reputation with our ancestors. II^TDIAIM PIOKLii] (very Superior). 451. Ikgredieistts.—To each gallon of vinegar allow 6 cloves of garlic, 12 shalots, 2 sticks of sliced horseradish, \ lb. of bruised ginger, 2 oz. of whole black pepper, 1 oz. of long pepper, 1 oz. of allspice, 12 cloves, \ oz. of cayenne, 2 oz. of mustard-seed, \ lb. of mustard, 1 oz. of turmeric ; a white cabbage, cauliflowers, radish- pods, Erench beans, gherkins, small round pickling-onions, nastur- tiums, capsicums, chiiies, &c. Mode,—Cut the cabbage, v/hich must be hard and white, into slices, and the cauliflowers into small branches; sprinkle salt over them in a large dish, and let them remain two days ; then dry them, and put them into a very large jar, with garlic, shalots, horseradish, ginger, pepper, allspice, and cloves, in the above proportions. Boil sufficient vinegar to cover them, which pour over, and, when cold, cover up to keep them free from dust. As the other things for tho pickle ripen at diflerent times, they may be added as they are ready : these will be radish-pods, French beans, gherkins, small onions, nas- turtiums, capsicuDis, chiiies, &c. &c. As these are procured, they must, first of all, be washed in a little cold vinegar, wiped, and then simply added to the other ingredients in the large jar, only taking care that they are covered by the vinegar. If more vinegar should be wantedSAUCES, ETC. 217 to add to the piclde, do not omit first to boil it before adding it to the rest. When you have collected all the things you require, turn all out in a large pan, and thoroughly mix them. Now put the mixed vegetables into smaller jars, without any of the vinegar; then boil the vinegar again, adding as much more as will be required to fill the different jars, and also cayenne, mustard-seed, turmeric, and mustard, which must be well mixed with a little cold vinegar, allowing the quantities named above to each gallon of vinegar. Pour the vinegar, boiling hot, over the pickle, and v/hen cold, tie down with a bladder. If the piclde is wanted for immediate use, the vinegar should be boiled twice more, but the better way is to make it during one season for use during the next. It will keep for years, if care is taken that the vegetables are quite covered by the vinegar. This recipe was taken from the directions of a lady whose pickle was always pronounced excellent by all who tasted it, and who has, for many years, exactly followed the recipe given above. Note.—For small families, perhaps the above quantity of pickle will bo considered too large; but this may be decreased at pleasure, taking care to properly proportion the various ingredients. Keeping Pickles.—I^othing shows more, perhaps, the difference between a tidy thrifty housewife and a lady to whom these desirable epithets may not honestly be applied, than the appearance of their respective store-closets. The former is able, the moment any- thing is wanted, to put her hand on it at once; no time is lost, no vexation incurred, no dish spoilt for the want of "just a little something,"—the latter, on the contrary, hunts all over her cupboard for the ketchuj) the cook requires, or the pickle the husband thinks he should like a little of with his cold roast beef or mutton-chop, and vainly seeks for the Embden groats, or arrowroot, to make one of her little boys some gruel. One plan, then, we strenuously advise all who do not follow, to begin at once, and that is, to label all their various pickles and store sau.ces, in the same way as the cut here shows. It will occupy a little time at first, but tiiere will be economy of it in the long run. ViNEaAB.—This term is derived from the two French words vin aigre, ' sour wine,' and should, therefore, be strictly applied to that which is made only from wine. As the acid is the same, however it is procured, that made from ale also takes the same name. Nearly all ancient nations were acquainted with the use of vinegar. We learn in EulJi, that the reapers in the East soaked their bread in it to freshen it. The Eomans kept large quantities of it in their cellars, using it, to a great extent, in their seasonings and sauces. This people attributed very beneficial qualities to it, as it was supposed to be digestive, antibilious, and antiscorbutic, as well as refreshing. Spartianus,'"a Latin historian, tells us that, mixed with water, it was the drink of the soldiers, and that, thanks to this beverage, the veterans of the Koman army braved, by its use, the inclemency and variety of all the different seasons and climates of Europe, Asia, and Africa. It is said, the Spanish peasantry, and other inhabitants of the southern parts of Europe, still foUow this practice, and add to a gallon of water about a gill of wine vinegar, with a little salt; and that this drink, with a little bread, enables them, under the heat of their burning sun, to sustain the labours of the field. INDIA]^ OHETHEY SAUCE. 452. Ingeedients.—8 oz. of sharp, sour apples, pared and cored; 8 oz. of tomatoes, 8 oz. of salt, 8 oz. of brown sugar, 8 oz. of stoned218 MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. raisins, 4 oz. of cayenne, 4 oz. of powdered ginger, 2 oz. of garlic, 2 oz. of shalots, 3 quarts of vinegar, 1 quart of lemon-juice. Mode.—Chop the apples in small square pieces, and add to them the other ingredients. Mix the whole ¥/ell together, and put in a well-covered jar. Keep this in a warm place, and stir every day for a month, taking care to put on the lid after this operation; strain, but do not squeeze it dry ; store it away in clean jars or bottles for use, and the Jiquor will serve as an excellent sauce for meat or fish. Seasonahle.—Make this sauce when tomatoes are in full season, that is, from the beginning of September to the end of October. Pickles.—The ancient G-reelcs and Eonians held their pickles in high estimation. They consisted of flowers, herbs, roots, and vegetables, preserved in vinegar, and which were kept, for a long time, in cylindrical vases with wide mouths. Their cooks prepared pickles with the greatest care, and the various ingredients were macerated in oil, brine, and vinegar, with which they were often impregnated drop by drop. Meat, also, after having been cut into very small pieces, was treated in the same manner. ITALIAN- SATJCB (Brown). 453. Ingeedients.—A few chopped mushrooms and shalots, i pint of stock, No. 105, i glass of Madeira, the juice of ^ lemon, i teaspoonful of pounded sugar, 1 teaspoonful of chopped parsley. Mode.—Vxkt the stock into a stewpan with the mushrooms, shalots, and Madeira, and stew gently for | hour, then add the remaining ingredients, and let them just boil. When the sauce is done enough, put it in another stewpan, and warm it in a lain marie. {See No. 430.) The mushrooms should not be chopped long before they are wanted, as they will then become black. Time.—J hour. Average cost^ for this quantity, 7d, Sufficient for a small dish. ITALIAH SAUCE (V/Mte). 454. Ij^'GEEDients.—i pint of white stock, No. 107; 2 tablespoonfuls of chopped mushrooms, 1 dessertspoonful of chopped shalots, 1 slice of ham, minced very fine; J pint of Bechamel, No. 367 ; salt to taste, a few drops of garlic vinegar, \ teaspoonful of pounded sugar, a squeeze of lemon-juice. Mode.—Put the shalots and mushrooms into a stewpan with the stock and ham, and simmer very gently for i hour, v/hen add the Bechamel. Let it just boil up, and then strain it through a tammy; season with the above ingredients, and serve very hot. If this sauce should not have retained a nice white colour, a little cream may be added.219 SAUCES; ETC. Time.—i hour. Average cost, for this quantity, lOd. Sufficient for a mo derate-sized dish. Note.—To preserve the colour of the mushrooms after pickling, throw them into water to which a little lemon-juice has been added. TO PICKLE liEMOIsTS WITH THE PEEL OIsT. 455. Ingredients.—6 lemons, 2 quarts of boiling water; to each quart of vinegar allow i oz. of cloves, i oz. of white pepper, 1 oz. of bruised ginger, J oz. of mace and chilies, 1 oz. of mustard-seed, | stick of sliced horseradish, a few cloves of garlic. Mode.—Put the lemons into a brine that will bear an egg; let them remain in it 6 days, stirring them every day; have ready 2 quarts of boiling water, put in the lemons, and allow them to boil for ^ hour ; take them out, and let them lie in a cloth until perfectly dry and cold. Boil up sufficient vinegar to cover the lemons, with all the above ingredients, allowing the same proportion as stated to each quart of vinegar. Pack the lemons in a jar, pour over the vinegar, &c. boiling hot, and tie down with a bladder. They will be fit for use in about 12 months, or rather sooner. Seasonable.—This should be made from November to April. The Lemott.—In the earlier ages of the world, the lemon does not appear to have been at all known, and the Romans only became acquainted with it at a very late period, and then only used it to keep moths from their garments. Its acidity would seem to have been unpleasant to them ; and in Pliny's time, at the commencement of the Christian era, this fruit was hardly accepted, otherwise than as an excellent anti- dote against the effects of poison. Many anecdotes have been related concerning the anti-venomous properties of the lemon; Atlienaeus, a Latin writer, telling us, that on one occasion, two men felt no eifects from the bites of dangerous serpents^j because they had previously eaten of this fruit. TO PICKLE LEMONS WITHOUT THE PEEL. 456. Ingeedients.—6 lemons, 1 lb. of fine salt; to each quart of vinegar, the same ingredients as Wo. 455. 3fode.—Peel the lemons, slit each one down 3 times, so as not to divide them, and rub the salt well into the divisions ; place them in a pan, where they must remain for a week, turning them every other day; then put them in a Dutch oven before a clear fire until the salt has become perfectly dry ; then arrange them in ajar. Pour over sufii- cient boiling vinegar to cover them, to which have been added the ingredients mentioned in the foregoing recipe ; tie down closely, and in about 9 months they will be fit for use. SeasonaUe.—The best time to make this is from November to April. Note.—After this pickle has been made from 4 to 5 months, the liquor may be strained and bottled, and will be found an excellent lemon ketchup.MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. 220 Lemon'-juice.—Citric acid is tlie principal component part of lemon-juice, whicli, in addition to the agreeableness of its flavour, is also particularly cooling and grateful. It is likewise an antiscorbutic; and this qixality enhances its value. In order to combat the fatal eifects of scurvy amongst the crews of ships at sea, a regular allowance of lemon-juice is served out to the men; and by this practice, the disease has almost entirely disappeared. By putting the juice into bottles, and pouring on the top sufficient oil to cover it, it may be preserved for a considerable time. Italy and Turkey export great quantities of it in this manner. IiEMOH SAUCE FOB BOILSD FOWLS. 457. iNaEEDiENTS.—1 small lemon, f pint of melted butter, 'No. S80. Mode.—Cut tbe lemon into very thin slices, and these again into very small dice. Have ready J pint of melted butter, made by recipe 1^0. 380 ; put in the lemon ; let it just simmer, but not boil, and pour it over the fowls. Tijne.—1 minute to simmer. Average cost, 6d. Sufficient for a pair of large fowls. - • liEMOiy^ WHITE SAUCE, FOE FOWLS, FBICASSEES, &c. 458. Ingeedients.—f pint of cream, the rind and juice of 1 lemon, i teaspoonful of whole white pepper, 1 sprig of lemon thyme, 3 oz. of butter, 1 dessertspoonful of flour, 1 teacupful of white stock; salt to taste. Mode.—Put the cream into a very clean saucepan (a lined one is best), with the lemon-peel, pepper, and thyme, and let these infuse for I hour, when simmer gently for a few minutes, or until there is a nice flavour of lemon. Strain it, and add a thickening of butter and flour in the above proportions ; stir this well in, and put in the lemon- juice at the moment of serving; mix the stock with the cream, and add a little salt. This sauce should not boil after the cream and stock are mixed together. Tz7ne.—Altogether, J hour. Average cost, Is. 6d. Sufficient, this quantity, for a pair of large boiled fowls. Note.—r Where the expense of the cream is objected to, milk may be substituted for it. In this case, an additional dessertspoonful^ or rather more^ of flour must be added. Lemoi-t Thyme.—Two or three tufts of this species of thyme, Thymus citriodorns, usually find a place in the herb compartment of the Icitchen-garden. It is a trailing evergreen, is of smaller grov/th than the common kind (see No. 166), and is remarkable for its smell, which closely resembles that of the rind of a lemon. Hence its dis- tinctive name. It is used for some particular dishes, in which the fragrance of the lemon is desired to slightly predominate.SAUCES; ETC. 221 LSAMINGTOH SAUCE (an Excellent Sauce for Flavouring Gravies, Hashes, Soups, &c.). {Author's Recipe.) 459. IiraREDiENTS.—Walnuts. To eacli quart of walnut-juice allow 3 quarts of vinegar, 1 pint of Indian soy, 1 oz. of cayenne, 2 oz. of shalots, f oz. of garlic, i pint of port wine. Mode.—Be very particular in choosing the walnuts as soon as they appear in the market; for they are more easily bruised before they become hard and shelled. Pound them in a mortar to a pulp, strew some salt over them, and let them remain thus for two or three days, occasionally stirring and moving them about. Press out the juice, and to each quart of walnut-liquor allow the above proportion of vinegar, soy, cayenne, shalots, garlic, and port wine. Pound each ingredient separately in a mortar, then mix them well together, and store away for use in small bottles. The corks should be well sealed. Seasonable.—This sauce should be made as soon as walnuts are obtainable, from the beginning to the middle of July. 460. Ingeedieistts.—1 pint of brandy, the rind of two small lemons, 2 oz. of loaf-sugar, J pint of water. JibfZe.—Peel the lemons rather thin, taking care to have none of the white pith. Put the rinds into a bottle with the brandy, and let them infuse for 24 hours, when they should be strained. Now boil the sugar with the water for a few minutes, skim it, and, when cold, add it to the brandy. A dessertspoonful of this will be found an excellent flavouring for boiled custards. Lemoit Kind oe Peel.—This contains an essential oil of a very high flavour and fragra,nce, and is consequently esteemed both a wholesome and agreeable stomachic. It is used, as will be seen by many recipes in this book, as an ingredient for flavouring a number of various dishes. Under the name of Cajtdied LEMON-PEEii, it is cleared of the pulp and preserved by sugar, when it becomes an excellent sweetmeat. By the ancient medical philosopher Galen, and others, it may be added, that dried lemon-peel was considered as one of the best digestives, and recommended to weak and delicate persons, lilAISOK" OF EaaS FOB- THICKEHIHG- SAUCES. 461. Ingredients.—The yolks of 3 eggs, 8 table spoonfuls of milk or cream. Mode.—Beat up the yolks of the eggs, to which add the milk, and strain the whole through a hair-sieve. When the liaison is being added to the sauce it is intended to thicken, care must be exercised to keep stirring it during the whole time, or, otherwise, the eggs will curdle. It should only just simmer, but not boil.222 MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKEHY.

Mode.—ash the liver, and let it boil for a few minutes ; peel the lemon very thin, remove the white part and pips, and cut it into very small dice; mince the liver and a small quantity of the lemon rind very fine; add these ingredients to \ pint of smoothly-made melted butter ; season with a little salt, put in the cut lemon, heat it gradually, but do not allow it to boil, lest the butter should oil. Time.—1 minute to simmer. Sufficient to serve with a pair of small fowls. IiIVEB AND PARSLEIT SAUCB FOR POULTRY. 463. Ingeedients.—The liver of a fowl, one tablespoonful of minced parsley, ^ pint of melted butter, No. 376. llode.—Wash and score the liver, boil it for a few minutes, and mince it very fine ; blanch or scald a small bunch of parsley, of which there should be sufiicient when chopped to fill a tablespoon ; add this, with the minced liver, to i pint of smoothly-made melted butter; let it just boil; when serve. Time.—1 minute to simmer. Sufficient for a pair of small fowls. LOBSTER SAUCE, to serve with Turbot, Salmon, Brill, &c. {Very Good.) 464. Ingeedients.—1 middling-sized hen lobster, f pint of melted butter, No. 376; 1 tablespoonful of anchovy sauce, t oz. of butter, salt and cayenne to taste, a little pounded mace when liked, 2 or ^ tablespoonfuls of cream. Jfot/e.—Choose a hen lobster, as this is indispensable, in order to render this sauce as good as it ought to be. Pick the meat from the shells, and cut it into small square pieces; put the spawn, which will be found under the tail of the lobster, into a mortar vv^ith i oz. of butter, and pound it quite smooth; rub it through a hair-sieve, and cover up till wanted. Make f pint of melted butter by recipe No. 376; put in ail the ingredients except the lobster-meat, and well mix the sauce before the lobster is added to it, as it should retain its square form, and not come to table shredded and ragged. Put in the meat, let it get thoroughly hot, but do not allow it to boil, as the colour would immediately be spoiled ; for it should be remembered that this sauce should always have a bright red appearance. If it is in-BAUCES, ETC. 223 tended to be served with, turbot or brill, a little of the spawn (dried and rubbed through a sieve without butter) should be saved to garnish with; but as the goodness, flavour, and appearance of the sauce so much depend on having a proper quantity cf spawn, the less used for garnishing the better. Time.—l minute to simmer. Average cost, for this quantity, 2s. Seasonable at any time. Sufficient to serve with a small turbot, a brill, or salmon for 6 persons. Nofe.—Melted butter made with milk, No. 380, will be found to answer very well for lobster sauce, as by employing it a nice white colour will be obtained. Less quantity than the above may be made by using a very small lobster, to which add only i pint of melted butter, and season as above. Where economy is desired, the cream may be dispensed with, and the remains of a cold lobster left from table, may, with a little care, be converted into a very good sauce. MAITHE D'HOTEL BUTTEB, for putting into Broiled Fish just before it is sent to Table. 465. Ingeedients.—J lb. of butter, 2 dessertspoonfuls of minced parsley, salt and pepper to taste, the juice of 1 large lemon. Mode,—Work the above ingredients well together, and let them be thoroughly mixed with a wooden spoon. If this is used as a sauce, it may be poured either under or over the meat or fish it is intended to be served with. Average cost, for this quantity, 5d. Note.—4: tablespoonfuls of Bechamel, Ko. 367, 2 do. of white stock, No. 107, with 2 oz. of the above maitre d'hdtel butter stirred into it, and just allowed to simmer for 1 minute, wil 1 be found an excellent hot maitre d'hdtel sauce. maifrl (rh6fp?^n/'^^^''^-~^5^ house-steward of England is synonomous with the S.n.i^r«w ?^rance; and, m ancient times, amongst the Latins, he was called procurator, or major-domo.

Ingeediefts.—1 slice of minced ham, a few poultry-trim- mings, 2 shalots, 1 clove of garlic, 1 bay-leaf, f pint of water, 2 oz. of lOutter, 1 dessertspoonful of flour, 1 heaped tablespoonful of choppedMODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. 22i parsley; salt, pepper, and cayenne to taste; the juice of i large lemon, ^ teaspoonful of pounded sugar. 3fode.—Put at the bottom of a stewpan the minced ham, and over it the poultry-trimmings (if these are not at hand, veal should be substi- tuted), with the shalots, garlic, and bay-leaf. Pour in the water, and let the whole simmer gently for 1 hour, or until the liquor is reduced to a full ^ pint. Then strain this gravy, put it in another saucepan, make a thickening of butter and flour in the above proportions, and stir it to the gravy over a nice clear fire, until it is perfectly smooth and rather thick, care being taken that the butter does not float on the surface. Skim well, add the remaining ingredients, let the sauce gradually heat, but do not allow it to boil. If this sauce is intended for an entree, it is necessary to make it of a sufficient thickness, so that it may adhere to what it is meant to cover. Time.—if hour. Average cost, Is. 2d. per pint. Sufficient for re-warming the remains of J calf's head, or a small dish of cold flaked turbot, cod, &c. MAIGBE MAITBE D'HOTEL' SAUCE (HOT). (Made without Meat.) 467. Ingredients.—-i- pint of melted butter, ISTo. 376 : 1 heaped tablespoonful of chopped parsley, salt and pepper to taste, the juice of i large lemon ; when liked, 2 minced shalots. Mode.—Make I pint of melted butter, by recipe ISTo. 376 ; stir in the above ingredients, and let them just boil; when it is ready to serve. Time.—1 minute to simmer. Average cost, 9d. per pint. MAYO]Sri3"AISE, a Sauce or Salad-Dressing for cold Chicken, Meat, and other cold Dishes. 468. Ingeedients.—The yolks of 2 eggs, 6 tablespoonfuls of salad- oil, 4 tablespoonfuls of vinegar, salt and white pepper to taste, 1 i tablespoonful of white stock, 'No. 107, 2 tablespoonfuls of cream. 3Iode.—Put the yolks of the eggs into a basin, with a seasoning of pepper and salt; have ready the above quantities of oil and vinegar,' in separate vessels; add them veri/ gradually to the eggs ; continue stirring and rubbing the mixture with a wooden spoon, as hereiif consists the secret of having a nice smooth sauce. It cannot be stirred too frequently, and it should be made in a very cool place, or, if ice is at hand, it should be mixed over it. When the vinegar and oil are well incorporated with the eggs, add the stock and cream, stirring all the time, and it will then be ready for use.SAUCES, ETC. 225 For a fisli Mayonnaise, this sauce may be coloured with lobster- spawn, pounded ; and for poultry or meat, where variety is desired, a little parsley-juice may be used to add to its appearance. Cucumber, Tarragon, or any other flavoured vinegar, may be substituted for plain, where they are liked. Average cost, for this quantity, 7d. Sufficient for a small salad. Note.—In mixing the oil and vinegar with the eggs, put in first a few drops of oil, and then a few drops of vinegar, never adding a large quantity of either at one time, By this means, you can be more certain of the sauce not curdling. Patience and practice, let us add, are two essentials for making this sauce good. MINT SAUCE, to serve with. Koast Lamb. 4^9. Inghedients.—4 dessertspoonfuls of chopped mint, 2 dessert- spoonfuls of pounded white sugar, J pint of vinegar. Mode.—"Wash the mint, which should be young and fresh-gathered, free from grit; pick the leaves from the stalks, mince them very fine, and put them into a tureen; add the sugar and vinegar, and stir till the former is dissolved. This sauce is better by being made 2 or 3 hours before wanted for table, as the vinegar then becomes impreg- nated with the flavour or the mint. By many persons, the above pro- portion of sugar would not be considered sufficient; but as tastes vary, we have given the quantity which we have found to suit the general palate. Average cost, Sd. Sufficient to serve with a middling-sized joint of lamb. licte.—Where green mint is scarce and not obtainable, mint vinegar may be substituted for it, and will be found very acceptable in early spring. Mtin't.—The common mint criltivated in our gardens is known as the Mentha viridis, and is employed in diiferent culinary processes, heing sometimes boiled with certain dishes, and ai'terwards with- drawn. It has an agree'able aromatic flavour, and forms an in- gredient in soups, and sometimes is used in spring salads. It is MIUT. valuable as a stomachic and antispasmodic; on which account it is generally served at table with pea-soup. Several of its species grow wild iu low situations iu the country. MINT VIHEGAS. 470. IiTGREDiEKTS.—Yiuegar, mint. IfocZe,—Procure some nice fresh mint, pick the leaves from the stalks, and fill a bottle or jar with them. Add vinegar to them until Q226 MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. the bottle is full; cover closely to exclude the air, and let it infuse for a fortnight. Then strain the liquor, and put it into small bottles for use, of which the corks should be sealed. Seasonahh^—Thxs should be made in June, July, or August. MIXED PICKLE. {Very Good.) 471. IiTGEEDTENTS.—To each gallon of vinegar allow \ lb. of bruised ginger, \ lb. of mustard, ^ lb. of salt, 2 oz. of mustard-seed, l-k oz. of turmeric, 1 oz. of ground black pepper, J oz. of cayenne, cauliflowers, onions, celery, sliced cucumbers, gherkins, French beans, nasturtiums, capsicums. Mode.—Have a large jar, with a tightly-fitting lid, in which put as much vinegar as required, reserving a little to mix the various powders to a smooth paste. Put into a basin the mustard, turmeric, pepper, and cayenne ; mix them with vinegar, and stir well until no lumps remain; add all the ingredients to the vinegar, and mix well. Keep this liquor in a warm place, and thoroughly stir every morning for a month with a wooden spoon, when it will be ready for the dijfferent vegetables to be added to it. As these come into season, have them gathered on a dry day, and, after merely wiping them with a cloth, to free them from moisture, put them into the pickle. The cauliflowers, it may be said, must be divided into small bunches. Put all these into the pickle raw, and at the^end of the season, when there have been added as many of the vegetables as could be pro- cured, store it away in jars, and tie over with bladder. As none of the ingredients are boiled, this pickle will not be fit to eat till 12 months have elapsed. Whilst the pickle is being made, keep a wooden spoon tied to the jar; and its contents, it may be repeated, must be stirred every morning. Seasonahle.—Make the pickle-liquor in May or June, as the season arrives for the various vegetables to be picked. MUSHROOM KETCHUP. 472. Ti^TGEEDlENTS.—To each peck of mushrooms f lb. of salt; to each quart of mushroom-liquor J oz. of cayenne, i oz. of allspice, ^ oz. of ginger, 2 blades of pounded mace. Mode.—Choose full-grown mushroom-flaps, and take care they are perfectly fresh-gathered when the weather is tolerably dry; for, if they are picked during very heavy rain, the ketchup from which they are made is liable to get musty, and will not keep long. Put'SAUCES^ ETC. 227 a layer of them in a deep pan, sprinkle salt over them, and then another layer of mushrooms, and so on alternately. Let them remain for a few hours, when break them up with the hand ; put them in a nice cool place for 3 days, occasionally stirring and mashing them well, to extract from them as much juice as possible. Now measure the quantity of liquor without straining, and to each quart allow the above proportion of spices, &c. Put all into a stone jar, cover it up very closely, put it in a saucepan of boiling water, set it over the lire, and let it boil for 3 hours. Have ready a nice clean stewpan ; turn into it the contents of the jar, and let the whole simmer very- gently for J hour; pour it into a jug, where it should stand in a cool place till the next day ; then pour it off into another jug, and strain it into very dry clean bottles, and do not squeeze the mushrooms. To each pint of ketchup add a few drops of brandy. Be careful not to shake the contents, but leave all the sediment behind in the jug ; cork well, and either seal or rosin the cork, so as perfectly to exclude the air. When a very clear bright ketchup is wanted, the liquor must be strained through a very fine hair-sieve, or flannel bag, after it has been very gently poured off; if the operation is not successful, it must be repeated until you have quite a clear liquor. It should be examined occasionally, and if it is spoiling, should be rebelled with a few peppercorns. Seasonable from the beginning of September to the middle of October, when this ketchup should be made. JSfote.—This flavouriKg ingredient^ if genuine and well prepared, is one of the most useful store sauces to the experienced cook, and no trouble should be spared in its preparation. Double ketchup is made by reducing the liquor to half the quantity ; for example, 1 quart must be boiled down to 1 pint. This goes farther than ordinary ketchup, as so little is required to flavour a good quantity of gravy. The sediment may also be bottled for immediate use, and will be found to answer for flavouring thick soups or gravies. How TO Distinguish Mushrooms pbom Toadstools.—The cultivated mushroom, known as Agaricus campestris, may be distinguished from other poisonous kinds of fungi by its having pink or flesh-coloured gills, or under-side, and by its invariably having an agreeable smeU, which the toadstool lias not. W^hen young, mushrooms are like a small round button, both the stalk and head being white. As they grow larger, they expand their heads by degrees into a flat form, the giLls underneath being at first of a pale flesh-colour, but becoming, as they stand longer, dark brown or blackish. Nearly all the poisonous I kinds are brown, and have in general a rank and putrid smeU. Edible mushrooms are 1 found in closely-fed pastures, but seldom grow in woods, where most of the poisonous sorts are to be found. TO DRY MUSHKOOMS. j 473. JibJe.—Wipe them clean, take away the brown part, and I peel off the skin; lay them on sheets of paper to dry, in a cool228 MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. oven, when they will slirivel considerably. Keep tliem in paper bags, which hang in a dry place. When wanted for use, put them into cold gravy, bring them gradually to simmer, and it will be found that they will regain nearly their usual size. The Musheoom.—The cultivated or garden mushroom is a speeies of fungus, which, in England, is considered the best, and is there usually eaten. The tribe, however, is nu- merous, and a large proportion of them are poisonous; hence it is always dangerous to make use of mushrooms gathered in their wild state. In some parts of Europe, as in Grer- mauy, Kussia, and Poland, many species grow wild, and are used as food; but in Britain, two only are generally eaten. These are mostly employed for the flavouring of dishes, and are also dried and piclded. Catsup, or Ketchup, is made from them by mixing spices and salt with their juice. The young, called buttons, are the best for pickUcg when in the globular form. THE MUSHROOM. BROWjSr MUSHPtOOM SAITOE, to serve witli Roast Meat, &c. 474. Ingeedients.—I pint of button muskrooms, i pint of good beef gravy, No. 435, 1 tablespoonfal of mushroom ketchup (if at hand), thickening of butter and flour. Mode.—Put the gravy into a saucepan, thicken it, and stir over the fire until it boils. Prepare the mushrooms by cutting off the stalks and wiping them free from grit and dirt; the large flap mushrooms cut into small pieces will answer for a brown sauce, when the buttons are not obtainable ; put them into the gravy, and let them simmer very gently for about 10 minutes; then add the ketchup, and serve. Time.—llather more than 10 minutes. Seasonable from August to October. JVote.—^Wlion fresh mushrooms are not obtainahle, the powder No. 477 may be used as a substitute for brown sauce. WHITE MUSHROOM SAUCE, to serve with Boiled .Fowls, Cutlets, &c. I. 475. Ingeediekts.—Eather more than ^ pint of button mushrooms, , lemon-juice and water, 1 oz. of butter, J pint of Bechamel, ^0. 367, i teaspoonful of pounded sugar. Mode.—Turn the mushrooms white by putting them into lemon-juice and water, having previously cut off the stalks and wiped them per- fectly free from grit. Chop them, and put them in a stewpan with the butter. When the mushrooms are softened, add the Bechamel,229 SAUCES^ ETC. and simmer for about 5 minutes ; should they, however, not be done enough, allow rather more time. They should not boil longer than necessary, as they would then lose their colour and flavour. E-ub the whole through a tammy, and serve very hot. After this, it should be warmed in a bain marie. Time.—Altogether, | hour. Average cost, Is, Reasonable from August to October. II. A More Simijle Method, 476. Ingredients.—i pint of melted butter, made with milk. No. 380 ; \ pint of button mushrooms, 1 dessertspoonful of mushroom ketchup, if at hand; cayenne and salt to taste. Irlode.—Make the melted butter by recipe No. 380, and add to it the mushrooms, which must be nicely cleaned, and free from grit, and the stalks cut off. Let them simmer gently for about 10 minutes, or until they are quite tender. Put in the seasoning and ketchup ; let it just boil, when serve. Tiyne.—Rather more than 10 minutes. Average cost, 8d. Seasonable from August to October. Growth op the Musheoom and other Fungi.—The quick growth of the mushroom and other fuugi is no less wondei^ful than the length of time they live, and the numerous dangers they resist while they continue in the dormant state. To spring up "like a mushroom in a night" is a scriptu.ral mode of expressing celerity j and this completely accords with all the observations which have been made concerning this curious class of plants. Mr. Sowerby remarks—" I have often placed specimens of the Fhallus caniniis by a window over-night, while in the egg-form, and they have been fully grown by the morning." MUSHSOOM POWBEB (a vakiable addition to Sauces and Gravies, when fresh Muslirooms are not obtainable). 477. Iix'GEEDiEi^TS.—J peck of large mushrooms, 2 onions, 12 cloves, 5 oz. of pounded mace, 2 teaspoonfuls of white pepper. llode.—Peel the mushrooms, wipe them perfectly free from grit and dirt, remove the black fur, and reject all those that are at all worm- eaten ; put them into a stewpan with the above ingredients, but without water ; shake them over a clear fire, till all the liquor is dried up, and be careful not to let them burn ; arrange them on tins, and dry them in a slow oven ; pound them to a fine powder, which put into small di-7/ bottles ; cork well, seal the corks, and keep it in a dry place. In using this powder, add it to the gravy just before serving, when it will merely require one boil-up. The flavour imparted by this means to the gravy, ought to be exceedingly good.MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. 230 Seasonable.—This should be made in September, or at the beginning of October. Note.—If the bottles in which it is stored away are not perfectly dry, as, also the mushroom powder, it will keep good but a very short time. PICKLED MUSHROOMS. 478. Ikgeebieis'TS.—Sufficient vinegar to cover the mushrooms; to each quart of mushrooms, 2 blades of pounded mace, 1 oz. of ground pepper, salt to taste. Mode.—Choose some nice young button mushrooms for pickling, and rub olf the skin with a piece of flannel and salt, and cut off the stalks ; if very large, take out the red inside, and reject the black ones, as they are too old. Put them in a stewpan, sprinkle salt over them, with pounded mace and pepper in the above proportion ; shake them well over a clear fire until the liquor flows, and keep them there until it is all dried up again; then add as much vinegar as will cover them; just let it simmer for 1 minute, and store it away in stone jars for use. When cold, tie down with bladder and keep in a dry place : •they will remain good for a length of time, and are generally con- sidered delicious. Seasonable.—Make this the same time as ketchup, from the begin- ning of September to the middle of October. IsTatuiit! of the Mushroom.—Locality has evidently a considerable influence on the nature of the juices of the mushroom; for it has been discovered, after fatal experience, that some species, which are perfectly harmless when raised in open meadows and pasture- lands, become virulently poisonous when they happen to grow in contact with stagnant water or putrescent animal and vegetable substances. What the precise nature of the poison in fungi may be, has not been accurately ascertained. A VEE-Y" EIOH AITD GOOD MUSHHOOM SAUCE, to serve with Fov/ls or Rabbits. 479. Ingeediekts.—1 pint of mushroom-buttons, salt to taste, a little grated nutmeg, 1 blade of pounded mace, 1 pint of cream, 2 oz. of butter, flour to thicken. Mode.—Uuh the buttons with a piece of flannel and salt, to take off the skin; cut ofl" the stalks, and put them in a stewpan with the above ingredients, previously kneading together the butter and flour ; boil the whole for about ten minutes, stirring all the time. Pour some of the sauce over the fowls, and the remainder serve in a tureen. Time.—10 minutes. Average cost, 2s. Sufficient to serve with a pair of fowls. Seasonable from August to October.231 SAUCES, ETC. HOW TO MIX MUSTARD. 480. Ingeedients.—Mustard, salt, and water. Jfcjf/e.—Mustard should be mixed with water that has been boiled and allowed to cool; hot water destroys its essential properties, and raw cold water might cause it to ferment. Put the mustard in a cup, with a small pinch of salt, and mix with it very gradually sufficient boiled water to make it drop from the spoon without being watery. Stir and mix well, and rub the lumps well down with the back of a spoon, as well-mixed mustard should be perfectly free from these. The mustard-pot should not be more than half full, or rather less if it will not be used in a day or two, as it is so much better when freshly mixed. TARTAR MUSTARD. 481. InGEEDIEKTS.—Horseradish vinegar, cayenne, i a teacupful of mustard. Mode.—KsiYe ready sufficient horseradish vinegar to mix with the above proportion of mustard ; put the mustard in a cup, with a slight seasoning of cayenne; mix it perfectly smooth with the vinegar, adding this a little at a time; rub down with the back of a spoon any lumps that may appear, and do not let it be too thin. Mustard may be flavoured in various ways, with Tarragon, shalot, celery, and many other vinegars, herbs, spices, &c.; but this is more customary in France than in England, as there it is merely considered a " vehicle of flavours," as it has been termed. PICKLICD NASTURTIUMS (a very good Su'bstitute for Capers) 482. Ingeedients.—To each pint of vinegar, 1 oz. of salt, 6 pepper- corns, nasturtiums. 3Iode.—Gather the nasturtium-pods on a dry day, and wipe them clean with a cloth; put them in a dry glass bottle, with vinegar, salt, and pepper in the above proportion. If you cannot find enough ripe to fill a bottle, cork up what you have got until you have some more fit; they may be added from day to day. Bung up the bottles, and seal or rosin the tops. They will be fit for use in 10 or 12 months; and the best way is ^ to make them one season for the next. -^^^ ^^^^^^ Seasonable.—Lqo\ for nasturtium-pods from KASTUExiuiis. the end of July to the end of August. Nasiustiums.—Tlie elegant nasturtium-plaut; called by naturalists Tropceohm, and282 MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. which can be procured from the beginning of September to Christmas. 2 or 3 "whicli sometimes goes by tlie name of Indian cress, came originaKy from Peru, but ■was easily made to grow in these islands. Its young leaves and flowers are of a slightly hot nature, and many consider them a good adjunct to salads, to which they certainly add a pretty appearance. When the beautiful blossoms, which may be employed with great eiFect in garnishing dishes, are off, then the fruit is used as described in the above recipe. PBEl^CH Ol^lCN SAUClil, or SOUBISS. 483. Inghediej^-ts.—l- pint of Bechamel, Ko. 367, 1 bay-leaf, seasoning to taste of pounded mace and cayenne, 6 onions, a small piece of ham. Mode.—Peel the onions and cut them in halves; put them in a stewpan, with just sufficient water to cover them, and add the bay- leaf, ham, cayenne, and mace ; be careful to keep the lid closely shut, and simmer them until tender. Take them out and drain tho- roug-hly; rub them through a tammy or sieve (an old one does for the purpose) with a wooden spoon, and put them to i pint of Bechamel; keep stirring over the fire until it boils, when serve. If it should require any more seasoning, add it to taste. Time.—f hour to boil the onions. Average cost^ \0d. for this quantity. Sufficient for a moderate-sized dish. WHITE OmOH- SAIJGS, for Boiled Babbits, Boast Shoulder of Mutton, &c. 484. Ingredieitts.— 9 large onions, or 12 middling-sized ones, 1 pint of melted butter made with milk (K"o. 380), \ teaspoonful of salt, or rather more. Mode.—Peel the onions and put them into water to which a little salt has been added, to preserve their whiteness, and let them remain for 5 hour. Then put them in a stewpan, cover them with water, and let them boil until tender, and, if the onions should be very strong, change the water after they have been boiling for | hour. Drain them thoroughly, chop them, and rub them through a tammy or sieve. Make 1 pint of melted butter, by recipe No. 380, and when that boils, put in the onions, with a seasoning of salt; stir it till it simmers, when it will be ready to serve. If these directions are carefully attended to, this onion sauce will be delicious. Time.—From f to 1 hour, to boil the onions. Avei^age cost, 9d. per pint. Sufficient to serve with a roast shoulder of mutton, or boiled rabbit. Seasonable from August to March. Note.—To make this sauce very mild and delicate, use Spanish onions,SAUCES, ETC. 233 tablespoonfuls of cream added just before serving, Yvill be found to im- prove its appearance very much. Small onions^ when very young-, may bo cooked whole, and served in melted butter. A sieve or tammy sliould bo kept expressly for onions : an old one answers the purpose, as it is liable to retain the flavour and smell, which of course would be excessively dis- agreeable in delicate preparations. BEOWi^ ONIOl^ SATJGEl. 485. Tngbedients.—6 large onions, rather more than f pint of good gravy, 2 oz. of butter, salt and pepper to taste. Mode.—Slice and fry the onions of a pale brown in a stewpan, with the above quantity of butter, keeping them well stirred, that they do not get black. When a nice colour, pour over the gravy, and let them, sirnmer gently until tender. Now skim off every particle of fat, add the seasoning, and rub the whole through a tammy or sieve ; put it back in the saucepan to warm, and when it boils, serve. Time.—Altogether 1 hour. Seasonable from August to March. Note.—Where a very high flavouring is liked, add 1 tablespoonful of mush- room ketchup, or a small quantity of port wine. History of the 0>:io]S'.—It is not supposed tliatany variety of the onion is incHgenou>3 to Britain, as when the large and mild roots imported from warmer climates, have been cultivated in these islands a few years, they deteriorate both in size and sweetness. It is therefore most likely that this plant was first introduced into England from continental Europe, and that it originally was produced in a southern climate, and has gradually become acchmatized to a colder atmosphere. {See No. 139.) PICKLED ONIOISTS (a very Simple Method, and exceedingly Good). \ 486. Ikgeedients.—Pickling onions; to each quart of vinegar^ 2 teaspoonfuls of allspice, 2 teaspoonfuls of v/hole black pepper. Mode.—Have the onions gathered when quite dry and ripe, and, with the fingers, take oil the thin outside skin ; then, with a silver knife (steel should not be used, as it spoils the colour of the onions), remove one more skin, when the onion will look quite clear. Have ready some very dry bottles or jars, and as fast as they are peeled, put them in. Pour over sufficient cold vinegar to cover them, with pepper and allspice in the above proportions, taking care that each jar has its share of the latter ingredients. Tie down with bladder, and put them in a dry place, and in a fortnight they will be fit for use. This is a most simple recipe and very delicious, the onions being nice and crisp. They should be eaten within 6 or 8 months after being done, as the onions are liable to become soft. Seasonable from the middle of July to the end of August. 'mMODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. 3 or 4 strips of lemon or orange peel, a few leaves of basil, if at hand, PICKLED ONIOIsrS. 487. Ingeedients.—1 gallon of pickling" onions, salt and water, milk; to each k gallon of vinegar, 1 oz. of bruised ginger, i teaspoonful of cayenne, 1 oz. of allspice, 1 oz. of whole black pepper, J oz. of whole nutmeg bruised, 8 cloves, J oz. of mace. Jibc?^.—Grather the onions, which should not be too small, when they are quite dry and ripe; wipe off the dirt, but do not pare them; make a strong solution of salt and water, into which put the onions, and change this, morning and night, for 3 days, and save the last brine they were put in. Then take the outside skin off, and put them into a tin saucepan capable of holding them all, as they are always better done together. Now take equal quantities of milk and the last salt and water the onions were in, and pour this to them; to this add 2 large spoonfuls of salt, put them over the fire, and watch them very attentively. Keep constantly turning the onions about with a wooden skimmer, those at the bottom to the top, and vice versa; and let the milk and water run through the holes of the skimmer. Eemember, the onions must never boil, or, if they do, they will be good for nothing; and they should be quite transparent. Keep the onions stirred for a few minutes, and, in stirring' them, be particular not to break them. Then have ready a pan with a colander, into which turn the onions to drain, covering them with a cloth to keep in the steam. Place on a table an old cloth, 2 or 3 times double; put the onions on it when quite hot, and over them an old piece of "blanket; cover this closely over them, to keep in the steam. Let them remain till the next day, when they will be quite cold, and look yellow and shrivelled ; take otf the shrivelled skins, when they should be as white as snow. Put them in a pan, make a pickle of vinegar and the remaining ingredients, boil all these up, and pour hot over the onions in the pan. Cover -very closely to keep in all the steam, and let them stand till the following day, v/hen they v\dli be quite cold. Put them into jars or bottles well bunged, and a tablespoonful of the best olive-oil on the top of each jar or bottle. Tie them down with bladder, and let them stand in a cool place for a month or six weeks, when they will be fit for use. They should be beautifully w^hite, and eat crisp, without the least softness, and will keep good many months. Reasonable from the middle of July to the end of August. OBAiraE aHAVY, for Wildfowl, Widgeon, Teal, &c. 488. Ingeedients.—i pint of white stock, No. 107, 1 small onion,235 SAUCES; ETC. the juice of a Seville orange or lemon, salt and pepper to taste, 1 glass of port wine. llode,—Put the onion, cut in slices, into a stewpan with the stodt orange-peel, and basil, and let them simmer very gently for i hour oi rather longer, should the gravy not taste sufficiently of the peel iStrain it off, and add to the gravy the remaining ingredients ; let the whole heat through, and, when on the point of boiling, serve very hot in a tureen which should have a cover to it. Time.—Altogether i hour. Sufficient for a small tureen. OYSTER FORCEMEAT, for Roast or Boiled Turkey. 489. I]S'GKEDiENTS.—i pint of bread crumbs, li oz. of chopped suet or butter, 1 faggot of savoury herbs, i saltspoonful of grated nutmeg, salt and pepper to taste, 2 eggs, 18 oysters. 3Iode.—Grate the bread very fine, and be careful that no large lumps remain; put it into a basin with the suet, which must be very finely minced, or, when butter is used, that must be cut up into small pieces. Add the herbs, also chopped as small as possible, and seasoning; mix all these well together, until the ingredients are thoroughly mingled. Open and beard the oysters, chop them, but not too small, and add them to the other ingredients. Beat up the eggs, and, with the hand, work altogether, until it is smoothly mixed. The turkey should not be stuffed too full: if there should be too much forcemeat, roll it into balls, fry them, and use them as a garnish. Sufficient for 1 turkey. OYSTER KETCHUP. 490.

IiTGEEDiENTS.—100 oysters ; to each J pint of Yinegar, 1 blade of pounded mace, 1 strip of lemon-peel, 12 black peppercorns. Mode.—Get the oysters in good condition, open them, place tbem in a saucepan, and let tbem simmer in their own liquor for about 10 minutes, very gentlj^; then take them out, one by one, and place them in a jar, and covei; them, when cold, with a pickle made as follows:—Measure the oyster-liquor ; add to it the same quantity of vinegar, with mace, lemon-peel, and pepper in the above proportion, and boil it for 5 minut-es; when cold, pour over the oysters, and tie them down very closely, as contact with the air spoils them, Seasonahle from September to April. Hote.—Put this pickle away in small jars; because directly one is opened, its contents should immediately be eaten;^ as they soon spoil. The pickle should not be kept more than 2 or 3 months. OYSTEE, SAlios, to serve with. Pisli, Boiled Poultry, &c. 492. Ingeediekts.—3 dozen oysters, i pint of melted butter, made with milk, No. 380. 3Iode.—Open the oysters carefully, and save their liquor ; strain it into a clean saucepan (a lined one is best), put in the oysters, and let them just come to the boiling-point, when they should look plump. Take them off the fire immediately, and put the whole into a basin. Strain the liquor from them, mix with it sufficient milk to make i pint altogether, and follow the directions of l^o. 380. "When the melted butter is ready and very smooth, put in the oysters, which should be previously bearded, if you wish the sauce to be really nice. Set it by the side of the fire to get thoroughly hot, hut do not allotv it to boil, or the oysters will immediately harden. Using cream instead of milk makes this sauce extremely delicious. When liked, add a seasoning of cayenne, or anchovy sauce; but, as we have before stated, a plain sauce should be plain, and not be overpowered by highly-fiavoured essences ; therefore we recommend that the above directions be implicitly followed, and no seasoning added. Average cost fov this qiiajitiij, 2s. Sufficient for G persons. Never allow fewer than 6 oysters to 1 person, unless the party is very large. Seasonahle from September to April. A more economical sauce may be made by using a smaller quantity of oysters, and not bearding them before they are added to the sauce: this may ansv/erSAUCES, ETC. 237 the purpose, but we cannot undertake to recommend it as a mode of making this delicious adjunct to fish, &c. PAKSIiEY AND BUTTEK, to serve with Calf's Head, Boiled Fowls, &c. 493. Ingeedients.—2 tablespoonfuls of minced parsley, | pint of melted butter, No. 376. Mode—'Fnt into a saucepan a small quantity of water, slightly salted, and when it boils, throw in a good bunch of parsley which has been preyiously washed and tied together in a bunch; let it boil for 5 minutes, drain it, mince the leaves ver7j fine, and put the above quantity in a tureen; pour over it i pint of smoothly-made melted butter; stir once, that the ingredients may be thoroughly mixed, and serve. Tiine.—5 minutes to boil the parsley. Average cost, 4,d. Sufficient for 1 large fowl; allow rather more for a pair. Seasonable at any time. Note.—Sometimes, in the middle of winter, parsley-leaves are not to be had, when the following will be found an excellent substitute:—Tie up a little parsley-seed in a small piece of muslin, and boil it for 10 minutes in a small quantity of water; use this water to make the melted butter with, and throw into it a little boiled spinach, minced rather fine, which will have an appearance similar to that of parsley. Pakslet.—If there be nothing new under the sun, there are, at any rate, different uses found for the same thing; for this pretty aromatic herb was used in ancient times, as we learn from mythological narrative, to adorn the head of a hero, no less than Hercules ; and now—^vas ever fall so great ?—we moderns use it in connection with the head of—a calf. According to Homer's "Iliad," warriors fed their chariot-steeds on parsley; and PHny acquaints us with the fact that, as a symbol of mourning, it was admitted to furnish the funeral tables of the Eomans. Egypt, some say, first produced this herb ;. thence it was introduced, by some unknown voyager, into Sardinia,where the Carthaginians found it, and made it known to the inhabitants of Marseihes. (^See No. 123.) PEISD PAKSLEY, for GarnisMng. 494- Ingredients.—Parsley, hot lard or clarified dripping*. JfocZe.—Gather some young parsley; wash, pick, and dry it tho- rougly in a cloth ; piit it into the wire basket of which we have given an engraving, and hold it in boiling lard or dripping for a minute or two. Directly it is done, lift out the basket, and let it stand before the fire, that the parsley may become thoroughly crisp ; and the quicker it233 MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. is fried the better. Should the kitchen not be furnished with the above article, throw the parsley into the frying-pan, and when crisp, lift it out with a slice, dry it before the fire, and when thoroughly crisp, it will be ready for use. WIBE BASKET. WiEE Basket.—For this recipe, a wire basket, as shown in the annexed engraving, will be found very useful. It is very light and handy, and may be used for other similar purposes besides that described above. PAESIjUY juice, for Colouring various Dishes. 495. Procure some nice young parsley; wash it and dry it thoroughly in a cloth ; pound the leaves in a mortar till all the juice is extracted, and put the juice in a teacup or small jar ; place this in a saucepan of boiling water, and warm it on the lain marie principle just long enough to take off its rawness ; let it drain, and it will be ready for colouring. TO PBESERVB PABSLBY THBOUGH THE WmTEK. 49^- Use freshly-gathered parsley for keeping, and wash it perfectly free from grit and dirt; put it into boiling water which has been slightly salted and well skimmed, and then let it boil for 2 or 3 minutes ; take it out, let it drain, and lay it on a sieve in front of the fire, when it should be dried as expeditiously as possible. Store it away in a very dry place in bottles, and when wanted for use, pour over it a little warm water, and let it stand for about 5 minutes. Seosonahle,—Th.h may be done at any time between June and October. AlSr EXCELLENT PICKLE. 497' Ii^GEEDiENTS.—Equal quantities of medium-sized onions, cucumbers, and sauce-apples ; teaspoonful of salt, | teaspoonful of cayenne, 1 wineglassful of soy, 1 wineglassfal of sherry; vinegar. 3Iode.—Slice sufficient cucumbers, onions, and apples to fill a pint stone jar, taking care to cut the slices very thin; arrange them in alternate layers, shaking in as you proceed salt and cayenne in the above proportion ; pour in the soy and wine, and fill up with vinegar. It will be fit for use the day it is made. Seasonable in August and September. [This recipe was forwarded to the editress of this work by a subscriber to the Englishwoman's Domestic Magazine." Mrs. Beeton^ not having tested it, cannot vouch for its excellence ; but the contributor spoke very highly in its favour.]SAUCES, ETC. 239 Sot.—This is a sauce frequently made use of for fish, and comes from Japan, where it is prepared from the seeds of a plant called Dolichos Soja. The Chinese also manu- facture it; but that made by the Japanese is said to be the best. All sorts of statements have been made respecting the very general adulteration of this article in England, and we fear that many of them are too true. When genuine, it is of an agreeable flavour, thick, and of a clear brown colour. PICKLED BED CABBAGE. 498. iNesEDIENTS.—Eed cabbages, salt and water; to each quart of vinegar, f oz. of ginger well bruised, 1 oz. of whole black pepper, and, when liked, a little cayenne. Mode.—Take off the outside decayed leaves of a nice red cabbage, cut it in quarters, remove the stalks, and cut it across in very thin- slices. Lay these on a dish, and strew them plentifully with salt, covering them with another dish. Let them remain for 24 hours, turn into a colander to drain, and, if necessary, wipe lightly with a clean soft cloth. Put them in a jar; boil up the vinegar with spices .in' 'the above proportion, and, when cold, pour it over the cabbage. It will be fit for use in a Vv^eek or two, and, if kept for a very long time, the cabbage is liable get soft and to discolour. To be really nice and crisp, and of a good red colour, it should be eaten almost immediately after it is made. A little bruised cochineal boiled with the vinegar adds much to the appearance of this pickle. Tie down with bladder, and keep in a dry place. Seasonable in July and August, but the piekie will be much more crisp if the frost has just touched the leaves. Eed Cabbage.—This plant, in its growth, is similar in form to that of the white, but is of a bluish-purple colour, which, however, turns red on the application of acid, as is the case with all vegetable blues. It is principally from the white vegetable that the Germans make their saner kraiit; a dish held in such high estimation wdth the inhabitants of Vaderland, but which requires, generally speaking, with strangers, a long acquaintance in order to become sufficiently impressed with its numerous merits. The large red Dutch is the kind generally recommended for pickhng. PLTJM-PUDDIHG SAUCE. 499' TjrGtREDiEiTTS.—1 wineglassful of brandy, 2 oz. of very fresh I butter, 1 glass of Madeira, pounded sugar to taste. Mode.—Put the pounded sugar in a basin, with part of the brandy and the butter; let it stand by the side of the fire until it is warm and the sugar and butter are dissolved; then add the rest of the brandy, with the Madeira. Either pour it over the pudding, or serve in a tureen. This is a very rich and excellent sauce. Average cost, Is. Zd. for this quantity. Suficient for a pudding made for 6 persons.

Mode.—Bruise the shalots in a mortar, and put them in a stone jar with the walnut-liquor ; place it before the fire, and let it boil until reduced to 2 pints. Then, into another jar, put all the ingredients except the bay-leaves, taking care tha^t they are well bruised, so that the fl.avour may be thoroughly extracted ; put this also before the fire, and let it boil for 1 hour, or rather more. When the contents of both jars are sufficiently cooked, mix them together, stirring them well as you mix them, and submit them to a slow boiling for i hour; cover closely, and let them stand 24 hours in a cool place ; then open the jar and add the bay-leaves; let it stand a week longer closed down, svhen strain through a flannel bag, and it will be ready for use. Tho above quantities will make i gallon. Time.—Al-together, 3 hours. Seaso7iahle.—This sauce may be made at any time.£11 BAUCrS, ETC. BEMOULADE, or FKENCII SALAD-DEESSIISTG. 503. Ingeedients.—4 eggs, i tablespoonful of made mustard, salt and cayenne to taste, 3 tablespoonfuls of olive-oil, 1 tablespoonful of tarragon or plain vinegar. Mode,—Boil 3 eggs quite hard for about J hour, put them into cold water, and let them remain in it for a few minutes; strip off the shells, put the yolks in a mortar, and pound them very smoothly; add to them, very gradually, the mustard, seasoning, and vinegar, keeping all well stirred and rubbed down with the back of a wooden spoon. Put in the oil drop by drop, and when this is thoroughly mixed with the other ingredients, add the yolk of a raw egg, and stir well, when it will be ready for use. This sauce should not be curdled ; and to prevent this, the only way is to mix a little of everything at a time, and not to cease stirring. The quantities of oil and vinegar may be increased or diminished according to taste, as many persons would prefer a smaller proportion of the former ingredient. Geeen Eemoulade is made by using tarragon vinegar instead of plain, and colouring with a little parsley-juice, No. 495. Harvey's sauce, or Chili vinegar, may be added at pleasure. Ttme,—^ hour to boil the eggs. Average cost, for this quantity, *Id. Sufficient for a salad made for 4 or 6 persons. Tarragon".—The leaves of this plant, known to naturalists as Artemisia dracicnculiis, are much used in France as a tarragon". flavouring ingredient for salads. From it also is made the vinegar known as tarragon vinegar, which is employed by the French in mixing their mustard. It originally comes from Tartary, and does not seed in France. SAGE-AND-OWIOW STUFFING, for Geese, Ducks, and Pork. 504. Ingredients.—4 large onions, 10 sage-leaves, ^ lb. of bread crumbs, 1J oz. of butter, salt and pepper to taste, 1 egg. Jfoc?e.—Peel the onions, put them into boiling water, let them simmer for 5 minutes or rather longer, and, just before they are taken out, put in the sage-leaves for a minute or two to take off their raw- ness. Chop both these very fine, add the bread, seasoning, and butter, and work the whole together with the yolk of an egg, when the stuffing will be ready for use. It should be rather highly seasoned, and the sage-leaves should be very finely chopped. Many cooks do not parboil the onions in the manner just stated, but merely use thcni RMODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY, 212 raw. The stufiiiig thee, however, is not nearly so mild, and, to many- tastes, its strong flavour would be very objectionable. When made for goose, a portion of the liver of the bird, simmered for a few minutes and very finely minced, is frequently added to this stufiing; and where economy is studied, the egg may be dispensed with. Time.—Rather more than 5 minutes to simmer the onions. Average cost^ for this quantity, i.d. Sufficient for 1 goose, or a pair of ducks. 505. Soyer's Recipe for Goose Stuffing.—Take 4 apples, peeled and cored, 4 onions, 4 leaves of sage, and 4 leaves of lemon tliyme not broken, and boil them in a stewpan with sufficient water to cover them ; when done, pulp them through a sieve, removing the sage and thyme ; then add sufficient pulp of mealy potatoes to cause it to be sufficiently dry without sticking to th© hand; add pepper and salt, and stuff the bird. SALAD DKESSING- (Excellent). I. 506. Ingredients.—1 teaspoonsful of mixed mustard, 1 teaspoonful of pounded sugar, 2 tablespoonfuls of salad oil, 4 tablespoonfuls of milk, 2 tablespoonfuls of vinegar, cayenne and salt to taste. 3Iode.—V\jit the mixed mustard into a salad-bowl with the sugar, and add the oil drop by drop, carefully stirring and mixing all these ingredients well together. Proceed in this manner with the milk and vinegar, which must be added very gradually^ or the sauce will curdle. Put in the seasoning, when the mixture will be ready for use. If this dressing is properly made, it will have a soft creamy appearance, and will be found very delicious with crab, or cold fried fish (the latter cut into dice), as well as with salads. In mixing salad dressings, the ingredients cannot be added too gradually^ or stirred too much. Average cost^ for this quantity, Zd, Sufficient for a small salad. This recipe can be confidently recommended by the editress, to whom it was given by an intimate friend noted for her salads. ScAECiTT OF Salads in England.—Three centuries -ago, very few vegetables were cultivated in England, and an author writing of the period of Henry VIII,'s I'eign, tells us that neither salad, nor carrots, nor cabbages, nor radishes, nor any other comestibles of a like nature, were grown in any part of the kingdom : they came from Holland and Flanders. We further learn, that Queen Catharine herself, with all her royalty, could not procure a salad of English growth for her dinner. The king was obliged to mend this sad state of affairs, and send to Holland for a gardener in order to cultivate those pot-herbs, in the growth of which England is now, perhaps, not behind any other coun- try in Europe.SAUCES, ETC. 243 The Olive ai^d Olive Oil.—This tree assumes a liigli degree of interest from the historical circumstances vv'itli wLicli it is connected, A leaf of it was brought into the ark by the dove, when that vessel was still floating on the waters of the great deep, and gave the first token that the deluge was subsiding. Among the Greeks, the prize of the victor in the Olympic games was a v.'reath of wild olive; and the " Mount of Olives" is rendered familiar to our ears by its being mentioned in the Scriptures as near to Jei'usalem. The tree is indigenous in the north of Africa, Syria, and Greece; and the Eomans introduced it to Italy. In Spain and the south of France it is now cultivated; and although it grows in England, its fruit does not ripen in the open air. Both in Greece and Por- tugal the fruit is eaten in its ripe state; but its taste is not agreeable to many palates. To the Italian shep' erd, bread and olives, with a little wine, form a nourishing diet; but in England, olives are usually only introduced by way of dessert, to destroy the taste of the viands v/hich have been previously eaten, that the flavour of the wine may be the better enjoyed. There are three kinds of olives imported to London,—the French, Sxianish, and Italian: the first are from Provence, and are generally accounted exceUent; the second are larger, but more bitter; and the last are from Lucca, and are esteemed the best. The oil extracted from olives, called olive oil, or salad oil, is, with the continentals, in continual request, more dishes being prepared with than without it, we should imagine. With us, it is principally used in mixing a salad, and when thus employed, it tends to prevent fermentation, and is an antidote against flatulency. THE OLIVE. II. 507. iNGEEDiEiiTTS.—4 eggs, 1 teaspoonful of mixed mustard, J tea- spoonful of white pepper, half that quantity of cayenne, salt to taste, 4 tablespoonfuls of cream, vinegar. Ifode,—Boil the eggs until hard, which will be in about i hour or 20 minutes; put them into cold water, take off the shells, and pound the yolks in a mortar to a smooth paste. Then add all the other ingredients, except the vinegar, and stir them well until the whole are thoroughly incorporated one with the other. Pour in sufficient vinegar to make it of the consistency of cream, taking care to add but little at a time. The mixture will then be ready for use. Average cost^ for this quantity. Id. Sufficient for a moderate-sized salad. Note.—The whites 01 the eggs, cut into rings, will serve very well as a garnishing to the salad. III. 508. Ingeediekts.—1 egg, 1 teaspoonful of salad oil, 1 teaspoonful of mixed mustard, i teaspoonful of salt, i teaspoonful of pounded sugar, 2 tablespoonfuls of vinegar, 6 tablespoonfuls of cream. JiocZe.—Prepare and mix the ingredients by the preceding recipe, and be very particular that the whole is well stirred. Note.—In making salads, the vegetables, &c., should never be added to the sauce very long before they are wanted for table; the dressing, however, may B 221-1 MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. always be j^repared some hours before required. Where salads are much in request, it is a good plan to bottle off sufficient dressing for a few days' con- sumption, as, thereby, much time and trouble are saved. If kept in a cool place, it will remain good for 4 or 5 days. Poetic Eecipe tok Salad—The Eev. Sydney Smith, the witty canon of St. Paul's, who thought that an enjoyment of the good things of this earth was compatible with aspirations for things higher, wrote the following excellent recipe for salad, which we should advise our readers not to x^ass by without a trial, when the hot weather invites to a dish of cold lamb. May they find the flavour equal to the rhyme.— *' Two large potatoes, pass'd through kitchen sieve, Smoothness and softness to the salad give : Of mordent mustard add a single spoon, Distrust the condiment that bites too soon; But deem it not, thou man of herbs, a fault, To add a double quantity of salt: Four times the spoon with oil of Lucca crowu, And twice with vinegar procured from ' town;' _ True flavour needs it, and your poet begs. The pounded yellow of two well-boil'd eggs. Let onion's atoms lurk within the bowl. And, scarce suspected, anim.ate the whole ; And, lastly, in the flavour'd compound toss A magic spoonful of anchovy sauce. Oh ! great and glorious, and herbaceous treat, 'Twould tempt the dying anchorite to eat. Back to the world he'd turn his weary soul, ^ And plunge his fingers in the salad-bowl." SAUCE AliliEMANDE, or GERMAIM SAUCE. 509. Iis-GEEDiENTS.—i pint of saucG tournee (No. 517), the yolks of 2 eggs. Mode.—Put the sauce into a stewpan, heat it, and stir to it the beaten yolks of 2 eggs, which have been previously strained. Let it just simmer, but not boil, or the eggs will curdle; and after they are added to the sauce, it must be stirred without ceasing. This sauce is a general favourite, and is used for many made dishes. Time—I minute to simmer. Average cost^ 6d, SAUCE ARISTOCBATIQUE (a Store Sauce). 510. iNGiiEDiENTS.—Grreen walnuts.

To every pint of the boiled liquor, k pint of vinegar, i pint of port wine, 2 tablespoonfuls of soy. 3Iode.—Pound, the walnuts in a mortar, squeeze out the juice through a strainer, and let it stand to settle. Pour off the clear juice, and to every pint of it, add anchovies, spices, and cloves in the above proportion. Boil all these together till the anchovies are dissolved, then strain the juice again, put in the shalots (8 to every pint), and215 SAUCES^ ETC. boil again. To every pint of the boiled liquor add vinegar, wine, and soy, in the above quantities, and bottle off for use. Cork well, and seal the corks. Seasonahle.—Mdke this sauce from the beginning to the middle of July, when walnuts are in perfection for sauces and pickling. Average costy 3s. 6d, for a quart. Manufactuke of Sauces.—In France, during the reign of Louis XII., at the latter end of the llth century, there was formed a company of sauce-manufacturers, who obtained, in those days of monopohes, the exclusive privilege of nialdng sauces. The statutes drawn up by this company inform ns that the famous sauce a la cameline, sold by them, was to be composed of "good cinnamon, good ginger, good cloves, good grains of paradise, good bread, and good vinegar." The sauce Tence, was to be made of "good sound almonds, good ginger, good wine, and good verjuice." May we respectfully express a hope—not that we desire to doubt it in the least—that the English sauce-manufacturers of the 19th century are equally considerate and careful in choosing their ingredients for their various v/ell-known preparations. SAUOB A L'AUBOSE, for Trout, Soles, &c. 511. Ingeedients.—The spawn of 1 lobster, 1 oz. of butter, i pint of Bechamel (No. 367), the juice of J lemon, a high seasoning of salt and cayenne. Mode.—Take the spawn and pound it in a mortar with the butter,, until quite smooth, and work it through a hair sieve. Put the- Bechamel into a stewpan, add the pounded spawn, the lemon-juice,., which must be strained, and a plentiful seasoning of cayenne and salt; let it just simmer, but do not allow it to boil, or the beautiful red colour of the sauce will be spoiled. A small spoonful of anchovy, essence may be added at pleasure. Time,—1 minute to simmer. Average cost^ for this quantity, \s\ Sufficient for a pair of large soles. Seasonable at any time.

Note.—This sauce originally took its name as being similar to that which the French sailor {matelot) employed as a relish to the fish he caught and ate. In some cases, cider and perry were substi- tuted for the wine. The Norman matelotes wero very celebrated. The Bat.—We have already described ITo. 180) the difference between the cherry-laurel (Priimis Laurus cerasm) and the classic laurel {Laurus nohilis), the former only bein<^ used for culinary ixirposes. The latter beautiful evergreen was consecrated by the ancients to priests and heroes, and used in their sacrifices. " A crovrn of bay" was the earnestly- desired reward for great enterprises, and for the display of uncommon genius in oratory or writing. It was more par- ticularly sacred to Apollo, because, according to the fable, the nymph Daphne was changed into a laurel-tree. The ancients believed, too, that the laurel had the power of com- municating the gift of proi)hecy, as well as poetic genius; and, when they wished to procure pleasant dreams, would I)lace a sprig under the pillow of their bed. It was the symbol, too, of victory, and it was thought that the laurel could never be struck by lightning. From this word comes that of " laureateAlfred Tennyson being the present poet laureate, crowned wdth laurel as the first of living bards. SAUCE PIQUAITTE, for Cutlets, Boast Meat, &o. 513.

The Growth of the PEPPEH-PLiiirT.—Our readers will see at Nos. 369 and 399, a description, with engravings, of the qualities of black and long pepper, and an account of where these spices are found. We will here say something of the manner of the growth of the pepper-plant. Like the vine, it requires support, and it is usual to plant a thorny tree by its side, to which it may cling. In Malabar, the chief pepper district of India, the jacca-tree (Artocarpus integrifolia) is made thus to yield its assistance, the same soil being adapted to the growth of both plants. The stem of the pepper- plant entwines round its support to a considerable height; the flexile branches then droop downwards, bearing at their extremities, as well as at other parts, spikes of green flowers, which are followed by the pungent berries. These hang in large bunches, resembling in shape those of grapes; but the fruit grows distinct, each on a little stalk, like currants. Each berry contains a single seed, of a globular form and brownish colour, but which changes to a nearly black when dried; and this is the pepper of commerce. The leaves are not unlike those of the ivy, but are larger and of rather a lighter colour; they partake strongly of the peouHar smell and pungent taste of the berry. SAUCE TOUBNES. 517. Ingredients.-—1 pint of v/liite stock (No. 107), thickening of liour and butter, or white roux (No. 526), a faggot of savoury herbs, including parsley, 6 chopped mushrooms, 6 green onions. 3fode.—Put the stock into a stewpan with the herbs, onions, and mushrooms, and let it simmer very gently for about J hour ; stir in sufficient thickening to make it of a proper consistency; let it boil for a few minutes, then skim off all the fat, strain and serve. This sauce, %yith the addition of a little cream, is now frequently called veloute. Time.—i- hour. Average cost, for this quantity, 6d. Note.—If poultry trimmings are at hand, the stock should be made of these ; and the above sauce should not be made too thick, as it does not then admit of the fat being nicely removed. SWEET SAUCE, for Venison. 518. Ingeedients.— A small jar of red-currant jelly, 1 glass of port wine. 3Iode.-—Y\xi the above ingredients into a stewpan, set them over the fire, and, when melted, pour in a tureen and serve.

Average costy for this quantity, 8d, SAUSAGE-MEAT STUFFING-, for Turkey. 520. Ingkediekts.—6 oz. of lean pork, 6 oz. of fat pork, both weighed after being chopped (beef suet may be substituted for the latter), 2 oz. of bread crumbs, 1 small tablespoonful of minced sage, 1 blade of pounded mace, salt and pepper to taste, 1 egg. 3Iode.—Chop the meat and fat very finely, mix with them the other ingredients, taking care that the whole is thoroughly incorporated. Moisten with the egg, and the stuffing will be ready for use. Equal quantities of this stuffing and forcemeat, No. 417, will be found to answer very well, as the herbs, lemon-peel, &c. in the latter, impart a very delicious flavour to the sausage-meat. As preparations, how- ever, like stuffings and forcemeats, are matters to be decided by individual tastes, they must be left, to a great extent, to the dis- crimination of the cook, who should study her employer's taste in this, as in every other respect. Average cost, 9cl. Sufficient for a small turkey. SAVOUBY JELLY FOR MEAT PIES. 521. Ingredients.—3 lbs. of shin of beef, 1 calf's-foot, 3 lbs. of knuckle of veal, poultry trimmings (if for game pies, any game trim- mings), 2 onions stuck with cloves, 2 carrots, 4 shalots, a bunch of savoury herbs, 2 bay-leaves; when liked, 2 blades of mace and a little spice; 2 slices of lean ham, rather more than 2 quarts of water. Mode.—Cut up the meat and put it into a stewpan with all the ingredients except the water; set it over a slow fire to drawdown, and, when the gravy ceases to flow from the meat, pour in the water. Let it boil up, then carefully take away all scum from the top. Cover the stewpan closely, and let the stock simmer very gently for 4 hours : if rapidly boiled, the jelly will not be clear. When done, strain it through a fine sieve or flannel bag ; and when cold, the jelly should be quite transparent. If this is not the case, clarify it with the whites of eggs, as described in recipe No. 109. Time.—4 hours. Average costy for this quantity, 5s. SHBIMP SAUCE, for Various Kinds of Fish. 522. Tngeedients.—J pint of melted butter (No. 376), i pint of picked shrimps, cayenne to taste.250 MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. Mode.—Make the melted butter very smoothly by recipe No. 376, shell the shrimps (sufficient to make J pint when picked), and put them into the butter; season with cayenne, and let the sauce just simmer, but do not allow it to boil. When liked, a teaspoonful of anchovy sauce may be added. Time.—1 minute to simmer. Average costj Gd, Sufficient for 3 or 4 persons. SPOTACH GBEEN FOR COLOUBINQ VARIOUS DISHES. - 523. Ingredients.—2 handfuls of spinach. Mode.—Pick and wash the spinach free from dirt, and pound the leaves in a mortar to extract the juice ; then press it through a hair sieve, and put the juice into a small stewpan or jar. Place this in a bain marie, or saucepan of boiling water, and let it set. Watch it closelj', as it should not boil; and, as soon as it is done, lay it in a sieve, so that all the water may drain from it, and the green will then be ready for colouring. If made according to this recipe, the spinach-green will be found far superior to that boiled in the ordinary way. HOT SPICE, a Delicious Adjunct to Chops, Steaks, Gravies, &c. 524. Ingredients.—3 drachms each of ginger, black pepper, and cinnamon, 7 cloves, -i oz. mace, f oz. of cayenne, 1 oz. grated nutmeg, li oz. white pepper. Mode.—Pound the ingredients, and mix them thoroughly together, taking care that everything is well blended. Put the spice in a very dry glass bottle for use. The quantity of cayenne may be increased, should the above not be enough to suit the palate. CiNNAMOir.—The cinnamon-tree (Laurtcs Cinnamo- mum) is a valuable and beautiful species of the laurel family, and grows to the height of 20 or 30 feet. The trunk is short and straight, with wide-spreading branches, and it has a smooth ash-like bark. The leaves are upon short stalks, and are of an oval shape, and 3 to 5 inches long. The flowers are in panicles, with six small petals, and the fruit is about the size of an olive, soft, insipid, and of a deep blue. This incloses a nut, the kernel of which germinates soon after it falls. The wood of the tree is white and not very sohd, and its root is thick and branching, exuding a great quantity of cam- cixvisAMorf. , phor. The inner bark of the tree forms the cinnamon of commerce. Ceylon was thought to be its native island; but it has been found in Malabar, Cochin-China, Sumatra, and the Eastern Islands ; also in the Brazils, the Mauritius, Jamaica, and other tropical localities.

Ingredients.—6 oz. of butter, 9 oz. of flour. 3Iode.—lielt the butter in a stewpan over a slow fire, end251 SAUCES, ETC. dredge in, very gradually, the flour; stir it till of a light-brown colour—to obtain this do it very slowly, otherwise the flour will burn and impart a bitter taste to the sauce it is mixed with. Pour it in a jar, and keep it for use: it will remain good some time. Time,—AhoMt i hour. Average cost, 7d, WHITE EOUX, for thickening White Sauces. 526. Allow the same proportions of butter and flour as in the preceding recipe, and proceed in the same manner as for brown roux, but do not keep it on the fire too long, and take care not to let it colour. This is used for thickening white sauce. Pour it into a jar to use when wanted. Time.—I hour. Average costy *Jd. Sufficient.—A dessertspoonful will thicken a pint of gravy. Note.—Besides the above, sauces may be thickened with potato flour, ground rice, baked floui', arrowroot, &c.: the latter will be found far preferable to the ordinary flour for white sauces. A slice of bread, toasted and added to gravies, answers the two purposes of thickening and colouring them. SPAITISH OHIONS-PICKLED. 527. IiTGiiEBiENTS.—Onions, vinegar; salt and cayenne to taste. Mode.—Cut the onions in thin slices; put a layer of them in the bottom of a jar; sprinkle with salt and cayenne; then add another layer of onions, and season as before. Proceeding in this manner till the jar is full, pour in sufficient vinegar to cover the whole, and the pickle will be fit for use in a month. 8easo)iahIe,—Ma,Y be had in England from September to February.

The tomato fruit is about the size of a small potato, and is chiefly used in soups, sauces, and gravies. THE TOMATO. It is sometimes served to table roasted or boiled, and when green, makes a good ketchup or pickle. In its unripe state, it is esteemed as excellent sauce for roast goose or pork, and when quite ripe, a good store sauce may be prepared from it. TOMATO SAUCE FOB KEEPING (Excellent). I. 530. I^^^GEEDIENTS.—To every quart of tomato-pulp allow 1 pint of cayenne vinegar (No. 386), % oz. of shalots, } oz. of garlic, peeled and cut in slices; salt to taste. To every six quarts of liquor, 1 pint of soy, 1 pint of anchovy sauce. ilfot7e.—Gather the tomatoes quite ripe ; bake them in a slow oven till tender; rub them through a sieve, and to every quart of pulp add cayenne vinegar, shalots, garlic, and salt, in the above proportion; boil the whole together till the garlic and shalots are quite soft; then rub it through a sieve, put it again into a saucepan, and, to every six quarts of the liquor, add 1 pint of soy and the same quantity of anchovy sauce, and boil altogether for about 20 minutes; bottle off for use, and carefully seal or rosin the corks. This will keep good for 2 or 3 years, but will be fit for use in a week. A useful and less expensive sauce may be made by omitting the anchovy and soy. JVme.—Altogether 1 hour. Seasonable.—Make this from the middle of September to the end of October. II. 63^. Ingeei>ients.—1 dozen tomatoes, 2 teaspoonfuls of the best powdered ginger, 1 dessertspoonful of salt, 1 head of garlic choppedSAUCES, ETa "HaaoK 253 iiae, 2 tablespoonfuls of vinegar, 1 dessertspoonful of Cliili vinegar (a small quantity of cayenne may be substituted for this). Mode.—Choose ripe tomatoes, put them into a stone jar, and stand them in a cool oven until quite tender ; when cold, take the skins and stalks from them, mix the pulp with the liquor v/hich is in the jar, but do not strain it; add all the other ingredients, mix well together, and put it into well-sealed bottles. Stored away in a cool dry place, it will keep good for years. It is ready for use as soon as made, but the flavour is better after a week or tw^o. Should it not appear to keep, turn it out, and boil it up with a little additional ginger and cayenne. For immediate use, the skins should be put into a wide-mouthed bottle with a little of the different ingredients, and they will be found very nice for hashes or stews. Time.—1 or 5 hours in a cool oven. Seasonable from the middle of September to the end of October. III. 532. Ingeedients.—3 dozen tomatoes ; to every pound of tomato- pulp allow 1 pint of Chili vinegar, 1 oz. of garlic, 1 oz. of shalot, 2 oz. of salt, 1 large green capsicum, -i teaspoonful of cayenne, 2 pickled gherkins, 6 pickled onions, 1 pint of common vinegar, and the juice of 6 lemons. 3fode.—Choose the tomatoes when quite ripe and red ; put them in a jar with a cover to it, and bake them till tender. The better way is to put them in the oven overnight, when it will not be too hot, and examine them in the morning to see if they are tender. Do not allow them to remain in the oven long enough to break them; but they should be sufficiently soft to skin nicely and rub through the sieve. Measure the pulp, and to each pound of pulp, add the above propor- tion of vinegar and other ingredients, taking care to chop very fine the garlic, shalot, capsicum, onion, and gherkins. Boil the whole together till everything is tender; then again rub it through a sieve, and add the lemon-juice. !N'ow boil the whole again till it becomes as thick as cream, and keep continually stirring; bottle it when quite cold, cork well, and seal the corks. If the flavour of garlic and shalot is very much disliked, diminish the quantities. Time.—Bake the tomatoes in a cool oven all night. Seasonable from the middle of September to the end of October. Note.—A quantity of liquor will flow from the tomatoes, which must bo put through the siovc with the rest. Keep it well stirred while on the fire, and use a wooden spoon.254 MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY.

This pickle will be fit for use in about 8 or 9 months. Thne.—20 minutes. Seasonahle.—lsleike the pickle in May or June, to be ready for the various vegetables. Note.—As tills pickle takes 2 or 3 months to make,—that is to say, nearly that time will elapse before all the different vegetables are added,—care must bo taken to keep the jar which contains the pickle well covered, either with a closely-fitting lid, or a piece of bladder securely tied over, so as perfectly to exclude the air. PICKLED WALNUTS (Very Good). 534- Ikgeedients.—100 walnuts, salt and water. To each quart of vinegar allow 2 oz. of whole black pepper, 1 oz. of allspice, 1 oz. of bruised ginger. Mode.—Procure the walnuts while young ; be careful they are not woody, and prick them well with a fork ; prepare a strong brine of salt and vrater (dibs, of salt to each gallon of water), into which put the walnuts, letting them remain 9 days, and changing the brine every third day; drain them off, put them on a dish, place it in the sun until they become perfectly black, which will be in 2 or 3 days ; have ready dry jars, into which place the walnuts, and do not quite fill the jars. Boil sufficient vinegar to cover them, for 10 minutes, with spices in the above proportion, and pour it hot over the walnuts, which must be quite covered with the pickle; tie down with bladder, and keep in a dry place. They will be fit for use in a month, and will keep good 2 or 3 years Time.—10 minutes. Seasonable.—Make this from the beginning to the middle of July, before the walnuts harden.

Now boil the liquor with the shalots, cloves, mace, pepper, and garlic, and let all simmer till the shalots sink; then put the liquor into a pan, and, when cold, bottle, and cork closely. It should stand 6 months before using: should it ferment during that time, it must be again boiled and skimmed. Time.—About | hour. Seasonable in September, when the wahiut- shells are obtainable. The Walnut.—This nut is a native of Persia, and wa3 introduced into England from France. As a pickle, it is much used in the green state; and grated walnuts iu Spain are much employed, both in tarts and other dishes. On the continent it is occasionally employed as a substitute for olive oil in cooking ; but it is apt, under such circumstances, to become rancid. The matter which remains after the oil is extracted is considered highly nutritious for poultry. It is called marey and in Switzerland is eaten under the name of pain amer by the poor. The oil is frequently manufactured into a kind of soap, and the leaves and green husks yield an extract, which, as a brown dj'3, is used to stain hair, wool, and wood.MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERT. 256 WHITE SAUCE (Good). 637.

THE LEAMlifGTON STOVE, OE KITCHEIfEB, VARIOUS MODES OF COOmG MEAT. CHAPTER XI. GENERAL REMAEKS. 540. In Our " Introduction to Cookery" (see No. 76) we have describccT tli8 gradual progress of mankind in the art of cookery, the probabiUty being, that the human race, for a long period, lived wholly on fruits. Man's means of attacking animals, even if he had the desire of slaughtering them, were very limited, until he acquired the use of arms. He, however, made weapons for himself, and, impelled by a carnivorous instinct, made prey of the animals that surrounded him. It is natural that man should seek to feed on flesh ; he has too small a stomach to be supported alone by fruit, which has not sufficient nourishment to renovate him. It is possible he might subsist on vegetables; but their preparation needs the knowledge of art, only to be obtained after the lapse of many centuries. Man's first weapons were the branches of trees, v/hich were succeeded by bows and arrows , and it is worthy of remark, that these latter weapons have been found with the natives of all climates and latitudes. It is singular how this idea presented itself to individuals so differently placed.MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. 253 c;4i. Brillat SaVARIN sa.ys, tliat raw flesh has but one inconvenience,— from its viscousness it attaches itself to the teeth. He goes on to say, that it is not, however, disagreeable ; but, when seasoned with salt, that it is easily digested. He tells a story of a Croat captain, w^hom he invited to dinner in 1815, during the occupation of Paris by the alHed troops. This officer was amazed at his host's preparations, and said, " When we are campaigning, and get hungry, we knock over the first animal we find, cut off a steak, powder it with salt, which we always have in the sabretasche, put it under the saddle, c^allop over it for half a mile, and then dine like princes." Again, of the huntsmen of Dauphiny it is said, that when they are out shooting in Sep- tember, they take with them both pepper and salt. If they kill a very fat bird, they pluck and season it, and, after carrying it some time in their caps, eat it. This, they declare, is the best way of serving it up. 542. Subsequently to the Croat Mode, which, doubtless, was in fashion in the earlier ages of the world, fire was discovered. This was an accident; for fire is not, although we are accustomed to call it so, an element, or spon- taneous. Many savage nations have been found utterly ignorant of it, and many races had no other way of dressing their food than by exposing it to the rays of the sun. 543. The Inhabitants of the Marian Islands, which wore discovered in 1521, had no idea of fire. Never was astonishment greater than theirs when they first saw it, on the descent of Magellan, the navigator, on one of their isles. At first they thought it a kind of animal, that fixed itself to and fed upon wood. Some of them, who approached too near, being burnt, the rest were terrified, and durst only look upon it at a distance. They were afraid, they said, of being bit, or lest that dreadful animal should wound with his violent respiration and dreadful breath ; for these were the first notions they formed of the heat and flame. Such, too, probably, were the notions the Greeks originally formed of them. 544. Fire having been Discovered, mankind endeavoured to make use^ of it for drying, and aftervrards for cooking their meat; but they were a considerable time before they hit upon proper and commodious methods of employing it in the preparation of their food. 545. Meat, then, placed on Burning Fuel was found better than when raw : it had more firmness, was eaten with less difficulty, and the ozmazome being condensed by the carbonization, gave it a pleasing perfume and flavour. Still, however, the meat cooked on the coal would become somewhat befouled, certain portions of the fuel adhering to it. This disadvantage was remedied by passing spits through it, and placing it at a suitable height above the burn- ing fuel. Thus grilling was invented ; and it is well known that, simple as is this mode of cookery, yet all meat cooked in this way is richly and pleasantly favoured. In Homer's time, the art of cookery had not advanced muchVARIOUS MODES OF COOKING MEAT. 259 beyond this; for we read in the " Iliad/' how the great A-chilles and his lilend Patroclus regaled the three Grecian leaders on breads v/ine, and broiled meat. It is noticeable, too, that Homer does not speak of boiled meat anywhere ia his poems. Later, however, the Jews, coming out of their captivity in Egypt, had made much greater progress. They undoubtedly possessed kettles ; and in one of these, Esau's mess of pottage, for which he sold his birthright, must have been prepared. 546. Having thus briefly traced a History of Gastronomical Progresses, we will now proceed to describe the various methods of cooking meat, and make a few observations on the chemical changes which occur in each of the operations. 547. In this Country, plain boiling, roasting, and baking are the usual methods of cooking animal food. To explain the philosophy of these simple culinary operations, we must advert to the effects that are produced by heat on the principal constituents of flesh. When finely-chopped mutton or beef is steeped for some time in a small quantity of clean water, and then subjected to slight pressure, the juice of the meat is extracted, and there is left a white tasteless residue, consisting chiefly of muscular fibres. When this residue is heated to between 158° and VJV Fahrenheit, the fibres shrink together, and become hard and horny. The influence of an elevated temperature on the soluble extract of flesh is not less remarkable. When the watery infusion, which contains all the savoury constituents of the meat, is gradually heated, it soon becomes turbid; and, when the temperature reaches 133°, flakes of whitish matter separate. These flakes are albumen, a substance precisely similar, in all its properties, to the white of egg {see No. 101). When the temperature of the watery extract is raised to 158°, the colouring matter of the blood coagulates, and the liquid, which was originally tinged red by this substance, is left perfectly clear, and almost colourless. When evaporated, even at a gentle heat, this residual liquid gradually becomes brown, and acquires the flavour of roast meat. 548. These Interesting Facts, discovered in the laboratory, throw a flood of light upon the mysteries of the kitchen. The fibres of meat are surrounded by a liquid which contains albumen in its soluble state, just as it exists in the unboiled egg. During the operation of boiling or roasting, this substanco coagulates, and thereby prevents the contraction and hardening of the fibres. The tenderness of well-cooked meat is consequently proportioned to the amount of albumen deposited in its substance. Meat is underdone when it has been heated throughout only to the temperature of coagulating albumen : it is thoroughly done when it has been heated through its whole mass to the temperature at which the colouring matter of the blood coagulates : it is ovei-done when the heat has been continued long enough to harden the fibres. 549. The Juice of Flesh is Water, holding in solution many substances s 22o0 MODERN HOUSDHOLD COOKERY. besides albumen, which are of the highest possible value as articles of food. In preparing meat for the table, great care should be taken to prevent the escape of this precious juice, as the succulence and sapidity of the meat depend on its retention. The meat to be cooked should be exposed at first to a quick heat, which immediately coagulates the albumen on and near the surface. A kind of shell is thus formed, which effectually retains the whole of the juice within the meat. 550. During the Operations of Boiling, Roasting, and Baking, fresh boef and mutton, when m.oderately fat, lose, according to Johnston, on an average about— In boiling. In baking. In roasting. 4 lbs. of beef lose lib 1 lb. 3 oz 1 lb. 5 oz. 4 lbs. of mAitton lose ... 14 oz 1 lb. 4 oz 1 lb. 6 oz. BAKING. 551. The Difference between Roasting Meat and Baking it, may bo generally described as consisting in the fact, that, in baking it, the fumes caused by the operation are not carried off in the same way as occurs in roasting. Much, however, of this disadvantage is obviated by the improved construction of modern BiEiNG-Disn. ovens, and of especially those in connection with the Leamington kitchener, of which we give an engraving here, and a full description of v/hich will be seen at paragraph No. 65, with the prices at which they can be purchased of Messrs. R. and J. Slack, of the Strand. With meat baked in the generality of ovens, however, which do not possess ventilators on the principle of this kitchener, there is undoubtedly a peculiar taste, which does not at all equal the flavour developed by roasting meat. The chemistry of baking may be said to be the same as that described in roasting. 552. Should the Oven be very brisk, it will be found necessary to cover the joint with a piece of white paper, to prevent the meat from being scorched and blackened outside, before the heat can penetrate into the inside. This paper should be removed half an hour before the time of serving dinner, so that the joint may take a good colour. 553. By Means of a Jar, many dishes, which will be enumerated under tlieir special heads, may be economically prepared in the oven. The principal of these are soup, gravies, jugged hare, beef tea; and this mode of cooking may be advantageously adopted with a ham, which has previously been covered with a common crust of flour and water.VARIOUS MODES OF COOKING MEAT. 26i 55,4. All Dishes prepared for Baking should be more highly seasoned than when intended to be roasted. There are some dishes which, it may be said, are at least equally well cooked in the oven as by the roaster; thus, a shoulder of mutton and baked potatoes, a fillet or breast of veal, a sucking pig, a hare, well basted, will be received by connoisseurs as well, when baked, as if they had been roasted. Indeed, the baker's oven, or the family oven, may often, as has been said, be substituted for the cook and the spit with greater economy and convenience. 555. A Baking-dish, of which we give an engraving, should not bo less than 6 or 7 inches deep; so that the meat, which of course cannot be basted, can stew in its own juices. In the recipe for each dish, full explana- tions concerning any special points in relation to it will be given. BoiLma. 556. Boiling, or the preparation of meat by hot water, though one of the easiest processes in cookery, requires skilful management. Boiled meat should be tender, savoury, and fullof its own juice, or natural gravy ; but, through the carelessness and ignorance of cooks, it is too often sent to table hard, tasteless, and innutritions. To insure a successful result in boiling flesh, the heat of the lire must be judiciously regulated, the proper quantity of water must be kept up in the pot, and the scum which rises to the surface must be carefully removed. 557. Many Writers on Cookery assert that the meat to be boiled should be i3ut into cold ivater, and that the pot should be heated gradually; but Liebig, the highest authority on all matters connected with the chemistry of food, has shov/n that meat so treated loses some of its most nutritious constituents. " If the flesh," says the great chemist, "be introduced into the boiler when th© water is in a state of brisk ebullition, and if the boiling be kept up for a few minutes, and the pot then placed in a warm place, so that the temperature of the water is kept at 158° to 165°, we have the united conditions for giving to the flesh the qualities which best fit it for being eaten." V/hen a piece of meat is plunged into boiling water, the albumen which is near the surface immediately coagulates, forming an envelope, which jDrevents the escape of the internal juice, and most effectually excludes the water, which, by mixing with this juice, would render the meat insipid. Meat treated thus is juicy and well-flavoured, when cooked, as it retains most of its savoury constituents. On the other hand, if the piece of meat be set on the fire with cold water, and this slowly heated to boiling, the flesh undergoes a loss of soluble and nutritious substances, while, as a matter of course, the soup becomes richer in these matters. The albumen is gradually dissolved from the surface to the centre; the fibre loses, more or less, its quality of shortness or tenderness, and becomes hard and tough : the thinner the piece of meat is, the greater is its loss of savoury constituents. In order to obtain well-flavoured and eatableBIODEPvN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. 262 meat, we must relinquish the idea of making good soup from it^ as that mode of boiling which yields the best soup gives the driest, toughest, and most vapid meat. Slow boiling whitens the meat; and, we suspect, that it is on this account that it is in such favour with the cooks. The wholesomeness of food is, however, a matter of much greater moment than the appearance it presents on the table. It should be borne in mind, that the whiteness of meat that has been boiled slowly, is produced by the loss of some imjDortant alimentary properties. 558. The Objections we have eaised to the practice of putting meat on the fire in cold water, apply with equal force to the practice of soaking meat before cooking it, which is so strongly recommended by some cooks. Fresh meat ought never to be soaked, as all its most nutritive constituents are soluble in water. Soaking, however, is an operation that cannot be entirely dispensed with in the preparation of animal food. Salted and dried meats require to be soaked for some time in water before they are cooked. 559. For Boiling Meat, the softer the water is, the better. When spring water is boiled, the chalk which gives to it the quality of hardness, is pre- cipitated. This chalk stains the meat, and communicates to it an unpleasant earthy taste. When nothing but hard water can be procured, it should be softened by boiling it for an hour or two before it is used for culinary purposes. 560. The Fire must be watched with great attention during the opera- tion of boiling, so that its heat may be properly regulated. As a rule, the pot should be kept in a simmering state; a result which cannot be attained without vigilance. 561. The Temperature at which Water boils, under usual circum- stances, is 212° Fahr. Water does not become hotter after it has begun to boil, however long or with whatever violence the boiling is continued. This fact is of great importance in cookery, and attention to it will save much fuel. Water made to boil in a gentle way by the application of a moderate heat is just as hot as when it is made to boil on a strong fire with the greatest possible violence. When once water has been brought to the boiling point, the fire may be considerably reduced, as a very gentle heat will suffice to keep the water at its highest temperature. 562. The Scum which rises to the surface of the pot during the operation of boiling must be carefully removed, otherwise it will attach itself to the meat, and thereby spoil its appearance. The cook must not neglect to skim during the whole process, though by far the greater part of the scum rises at first. The practice of wrapping meat in a cloth may be dispensed with if the skimming be skillfully managed. If the scum be removed as fast as it rises, the meat will be cooked clean and pure, and come out of the vessel in which it was boiled, much more delicate and firm than when cooked in a cloth.VARIOUS MODES OF COOKING MEAT. 263 563. When taken prom the Pot, the meat must be wiped with a clean cloth, or, what will be found more convenient, a sponge previously dipped in water and wrung dry. The meat should not be allowed to stand a moment longer than necessary, as boiled meat, as well as roasted, cannot be eaten too hot. 564. The Time allowed for the Operation of Boiling must be regu- lated according to the size and quality of the meat. As a general rule, twenty minutes, reckoning from the moment when the boiling commences, may be allowed for every pound of meat. All the best authorities, however, agree in this, that the longer the boiling the more perfect the operation. 565. A FEW Observations on the Nutritive Value of Salted Meat may be properly introduced in this place. Every housewife knows that dry salt in contact with fresh meat gradually becomes fluid brine. The application of salt causes the fibres of the meat to contract, and the juice to flow out from its pores: as much as one-third of the juice of the meat is often forced out in this manner. Now, as this juice is pure extract of meat, containing albumen, osmazome, and other valuable principles, it follows that meat which has been preserved by the action of salt can never have the nutritive properties of fresh meat. 566. The Vessels used for Boiling should be made of cast-iron, well tinned within, and provided with closely-fitting lids. They must be kept scru- pulously clean, otherwise they will render the meat cooked in them unsightly and unwholesome. Copper pans, if used at all, should be reserved for operations that are performed with rapidity ; as, by long contact with copper, food may become dangerously contaminated. The kettle in which a joint is dressed should be large enough to allow room for a good supply of water; if the meat be cramped and be surrounded with but little water, it will be stewed, not boiled. 567. In Stewing, it is not requisite to have so great a heat as in boiling. A gentle simmering in a small quantity of water, so that the meat is stewed almost in its own juices, is all that is necessary. It is a method much used on the continent, and is wholesome and economical. Two useful culinary vessels are represented ahove. One is a boiling-pot, in %yhieh large joints may be boiled; the other is a stewpan, with a closely-fitting lid, to which is attached a long handle j so that the ccver can be removed without scalding the fingers. BOILIKG-POT. STEWPAIT.MODEEN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. 568. The Hot-plate is a modern improvement on the old kitchen ranges, being used for boiling and stewing. It is a plate of cast iron, having a closed fire burning beneath it, by which it is tho- roughly well heated. On this plate are set the various saucepans, stewpans, &c.; and, by this convenient and economical method, a number of dishes may be prepared at one time. The culinary processes of braising and stewing are, in this manner, rendered more gradual, and consequently the substance acted on becomes more tender, and the gravy is not so much reduced. BEOILING-. 569. Generally speaking, small dishes only are prepared by this mode of cooking; amongst these, the beef-steak and mutton chop of the solitary English diner may be mentioned as celebrated all the world over. Our beef-steak, indeed, has long crossed the Channel; and, with a view of jDleasing the Britons, there is in every carte at every French restaurant, by the side of d la Marengo, and d la Mayonnaise,—hifteh d'Angleierre. In order to succeed in a broil, the cook must have a bright, clear fire ; so that the surface of the meat may be quickly heated. The result of this is the same as that obtained in roasting; namely, that a crust, so to speak, is formed outside, and thus the juices of the meat are retained. The appetite of an invalid, so difiicult to minister to, is often pleased with a broiled dish, as the flavour and sapidity of the meat are so well EEVOLVING GEIDIROli. 5 70. The Utensils used for Broiling need but little description. The com- mon gridiron, for which see engraving at No. 68, is the same as it has been for ages past, although some little variety has been introduced into its manufacture, by the addition of grooves to the bars, by means of which the liquid fat is carried into a small trough. One point it is well to bear in mind, viz., that the grid- iron should be kept in a direction slanting towards the cook, so that as little fat as possible may fall into the fire. It has been observed, that broiling is the most difiicult manual ofiice the general cook has to perform, and one that requires the most unremitting attention ; for she may turn her back upon the «tewpan or the spit, but the gridiron can never be left with impunity. The Tv8volving gridiron, shown in the engraving, possesses some advantages of convenience, which will be at once apparent.265 VARIOUS MODES OP COOKING MEAT, ^71. This very favourite Mode of Cooking may be accurately described as boiling in fat or oil. Substances dressed in this way are generally well received, for they introduce an agreeable variety, possessing, as they do, a peculiar flavour. By moans of frying, cooks can soon satisfy many requisitions made on tliem, it being a very expeditious mode of pre- paring dishes for the table, and one which can bo employed when the fire is not sufficiently saute pan. large for the purposes of roasting and boiling. The grea,t point to be borne in mind in frying, is that the liquid must be hot enough to act instantaneously, as all the merit of this culinary operation lies in the invasion of the boiling liquid, which carbonizes or burns, at the very instant of the immersion of the body placed in it. It may be ascertained if the fat is heated to the proper degree, by cutting a piece of bread and dipping it in the frying-pan for five or six seconds ; and if it be firm and of a dark brown when taken out, put in immediately what you wish to prepare ; if it be not, let the fat be heated until of the right temperature. This having been eifected, moderate the fire, so that the action may not be too hurried, and that by a continuous heat the juices of the substance maybe preserved, and its ilavour enhanced. 572. The Philosophy of Frying consists in this, that liquids subjected to the action of fire do not all receive the same quantity of heat. Being diSer- cntly constituted in their nature, they possess different capacities for caloric." Thus, you may, with impunity, dip your finger in boiling spirits of wine; you would take it very quickly from boiling brandy, yet more raj^idly from water; whilst the effects of the most rapid immersion in boiling oil need not be told. As a consequence of this, heated fluids act differently on the sapid bodies presented to them. Those put in water, dissolve, and are reduced to a soft mass ; the result being hoiullon, stock, &c. (see No. 103). Those substances, on the contrary, treated with oil, harden, assume a more or less deep colour, and are finally carbonized. The reason of these different results is, that, in the first instance, water dissolves and extracts the interior juices of the alimentary substances placed in it; whilst, in the second, the juices are preserved ; for they are insoluble in oil. 573. It is to be especially rei-iembered, in connection with frying, that all dishes fried in fat should be placed before the fire on a piece of blotting- paper, or sieve reversed, and there left for a few minutes, so that any superfluous greasy moisture may be removed. 574. The Utensils used for the Purposes of Frying are confined to frying-pans, although these are of various sizes ; and, for small and delicate dishes, such as collops, fritters, pancakes, &c,, the smtte pan, of which v/e sive an. enQ'ravinn*. is used.MODEEN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. 266 cooKiJsra by gas. 575. Gas-Cooking can scarcely now be considered a novelty,—many estab- lishments, both small and large, have been fitted with apparatus for cooking by this mode, which undoubtedly exhibits some advantages. Thus the heat may be more regularly supphed to the substance cooking, and the operation is essentially a clean one, because there can be no cinders or other dirt to be provided for. Some labour and attention necessary, too, with a coal fire or close stove, may be saved ; and, besides this, it may, perhaps, be said that culinary operations are reduced, by this means, to something like a certainty. 576. There are, however, we think, MANY objections to this mode of cooking, more especially when applied to small domestic es- tablishments. For instance, the ingenious ma- chinery necessary for carrying it out, requires cooks perfectly conversant with its use ; and if the gas, when the cooking operations are finished, be not turned off, there will be a large increase in the cost of cooking, instead of the economy which it has been supposed to bring. For large establishments, such as some of the immense London ware- houses, where a large number of young men have to be catered for daily, it may be well adapted, as it is just possible that a slight increase in the supply of gas necessary for a couiole of joints, may serve equally to cook a dozen dishes. BOASTING. 577. Op the Various Methods of Preparing Meat, Boasting is that which most effectually preserves its nutritive qualities. Meat is roasted by being- exposed to the direct influence of the fire. This is done by placing the meat before an open grate, and keeping it in motion to prevent the scorching on any particular part. When meat is properly roasted, the outer layer of its albumen is coagulated, and thus presents a barrier to the exit of the juice. In roasting meat, the heat must be strongest at first, and it should then be much reduced. To have a good juicy roast, therefore, the fire must be red and vigorous at the vf>ry commencement of the operation. In the most careful roasting, some of the juice is squeezed out of the meat: this evaporates on the surface of the meat, and gives it a dark brown colour, a rich lustre, amd a strong aromatic taste. Besides these effects on the albumen and the expelled juice, roasting converts the cellular tissue of the meat into gelatine, and melts the fat out of the fat-cells.VARIOUS MODES OF COOKING MEAT. 578. If a Spit is used to support the meat before the firC; it should be kept quite bright. Sand and water ought to be used to scour it with^ for brickdust and oil may give a disagreeable taste to the meat. When well scoured, it must be wiped quite dry with a clean cloth; and, in spitting the meat, the prime parts should be left untouched, so as to avoid any great escape of its juices. 579. Kitchens in Lauge Establishments are usually fitted with what are termed '^smoke-jacks." By means of these, several spits, if required, may be turned at the same time. This not being, of course, necessary in smaller establishments, a roasting apparatus, more economical in its consumption of coal, is more frequently in use. 580. The Bottle-jack, of which we here give an illustration, with the wheel and hook, and showing the precise manner of using it, is now commonly used in many kitchens. This consists of a spring inclosed in a brass cylinder, and requires winding up before it is used, and some- times, also, during the operation of roasting. The joint is fixed to an iron hook, which is suspended by a chain connected with a wheel, and which, in its turn, is connected with the bottle-jack. Beneath it stands the dripping-pan, which we have also engraved, together with the basting-ladle, the use of which latter should not be spared ; as there can be no good roast without good basting. ^' Spare the rod, and spoil the child," might easily be paraphrased into Spare the basting, and spoil the meat." If the joint is small and light, and so turns unsteadily, this may be remedied by fixing to the wheel one of the kitchen weights. Sometimes this jack is fixed inside a screen; but there is this objection to this apparatus,—that the meat cooked in it resembles the flavour of baked meat. This is derived from its being so completely surrounded with the tin, that no sufiicient current of air gets to it. It will be found preferable to make use of a common meat- screen, such as is shown in the woodcut . This contains shelves for warming plates and dishes; and with this, the reflection not being so powerful, and more air being admitted to the joint, the roast may be very excellently cooked. 581. In Stirring the Fire, or putting tresh coals on it, the dripping-pan should deippis-g-pan- akd basting-lidlb.

Under each particular Recipe there is stated the time required for roasting each joint; but, as a general rule, it may be here given, that for every pound of meat, in ordinary-sized joints, a quarter of an hour may be allotted. 583. White Merits, and the Meat of Young Animals, require to be very well roasted, both to be pleasant to the palate and easy of digestion. Thus veal, pork, and lamb, should be thoroughly done to the centre. 584. i\IUTTON AND Beef, on the other hand, do not, generally speaking, require to be so thoroughly done, and they should be dressed to the point, that, in carving them, the giavy should just run, but not too freely. Of course in this, as in most other dishes, the tastes of individuals vary ; and there are many who cannot partake, with satisfaction, of any joint unless it is what others would call overdressed.QUxiDEUPEDS. CHAPTER XII. GET-TERAIi OBSBRVATIOIvrS 0]Sr QUADBUPHDS. 585. By the General Assent of Mankind, the Empire of Nature Las been divided into three kingdoms ; the first consisting of minerals^ the second of vegetaMes, and the third of animals. The Mineral Kingdom com^^rises all substances which are without those organs necessary to locomotion, and the duo performance of the fmictions of life. They are composed of the accidental aggregation of particles, which, under certain circumstances, take a constant and regular figure, but which are more frequently found without ar.y definite conformation. They also occupy th.e ititerior parts of the earth, as v\'^ell as compose those huge masses by which we see the land in some parts guarded against the encroachments of the sea. The Vegetable Kingdom covers and beautifies the earth with an endless variety of form and colour. It consists of organized bodies, but destitute of the power of locomotion. They are nourished by means of roots; they breathe by means of leaves ; and propagate by means of seed, dispersed within certain limits. The Animal Kingdom consists of sentient beings, that enliven the external parts of the earth. They possess the powers of voluntary motion, respire air, and are forced into action by the cravings of hunger or the parching of thirst, by the instincts of animal passion, or by pain. Like the vegetable kingdom,270 MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. they are limited witliin the boundaries of certain countries by tlie conditions of climate and soil; and some of the species prey upon each other. Linnjcus has divided them into six classes ;—Mammalia, Birds, Fishes, Amphibious Animals, Insects, and Worms. The three latter do not come within the limits of our domain ; of fishes we have already treated, of birds we shall treat, and of mammalia we v/ill nov/ treat. 586. This Class of Animals embraces all those that nourish their young by means of lacteal glands, or teats, and are so constituted as to have a w^arm or red blood. In it the whale is placed,—an order which, from external habits, has usually been classed with the fishes ; but, although this animal exclusively inhabits the water, and is supplied v/ith fins, it nevertheless exhibits a striking alliance to quadrupeds. It has vv^arm blood, and produces its young alivo; it nourishes them with milk, and, for that purpose, is furnished with teats. It is also supplied with lungs, and two auricles and two ventricles to the heart; all of which bring it still closer into an alliance with the quadrupedal species of the animo.! kingdom. 587. The General Characteristics of the ]\Iammalia have been fre- quently noticed. The bodies of nearly the whole species are covered with hair, a kind of clothing which is both soft and warm, little liable to injury, and bestowed in proportion to the necessities of the animal and the nature of the climate it inhabits. In all the higher orders of animals, the head is the principal seat of the organs of sense. It is there that the eyes, the ears, the nose, and the mouth are placed. Through the last they receive their nourishment. In it are the teetli, which, in most of the mammalia, are used not only for the mastication of food, but as weapons of offence. They are inserted into two movable bones called jaws, and the front teeth are so placed that their sharp edges may easily be brought in contact with their food, in order that its fibres may readily be separated. Next to these, on each side, are situated the canine teeth, or tusks, v/hich are longer than the other teeth, and, being pointed, are used to tear the food. In the back jaws are placed another form of teeth, called grinders. These are for masticating the food ; and in those animals that live on vegetables, they are flattened at the to]3; but, in carnivora, their upper surfaces are furnished with sharp-pointed protuberances. From the numbers, form, and disposition of the teeth, the various genera of quadrupeds have been arranged. The oiose is a cartilaginous body, pierced with two holes, which are called nostrils. Through these the animal is affected by the sense of smell; and in some it is prominent, whilst in others it is flat, compressed, turned upwards, or bent downwards. In beasts of prey, it is frequently longer than the lips ; and in some other animals it is elongated into a movable trunk or proboscis, whilst, in the rhinoceros tribe, it is armed with a horn. The eyes of quadrupeds aro generally defended by movable lids, on the outer margins of which are fringes of hair, called eyelashes. The opening of the pupil is in general circular ; but in some species, as in those of the Cat and Hare, it is contracted into a271 GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON QUADRUrEDS. perpendicular line, wliilst in the Horse^ tlie Ox, and a few others, it forms a transverse bar. The ears are openings, generally accompanied with a cartilage v/hicli defends and covers them, called the external ears. In water-animals the latter are wanting ; sound, in them, being transmitted merely through orifices in the head, which have the name of auditory-holes. The most defenceless animals are extremely delicate in the sense of hearing, as are likewise most beasts ol prey. Most of the mammiferous animals icalk on four feet, which, at the extremities, are usually divided into toes or fingers. In some, however, the feet end in a single corneous substance called a hoof. The toes of a few end in broad, flat nails, and of most others, in pointed claws. Some, again, have the toes connected by a membrane, which is adapted to those that are destined to pass a considerable portion of their lives in water. Others, again, as in the Bat, have the digitations of the anterior feet greatly elongated, the intervening space being filled by a membrane, which extends round the hinder legs and tail, and by means of which they are enabled to rise into the air. In Man, the hand alone comprises fingers^ separate, free, and flexible; but Apes, and some other kinds of animals, have fingers both to the hands and feet. These, therefore, are the only animals that can hold movable objects in a single hand. Others, such as Rats and Squirrels, have the fingers sufficiently small and flexible to enable them to i^ick up objects : but they are compelled to hold them in both hands. Others, again, have the toes shorter, and must rest on the fore-feet, as is the case with dogs and cats when they wdsh to hold a substance firmly on the ground with their paws. There are still others that have their toes united and drawn under the skin, or enveloped in corneous hoofs, and are thereby enabled to exercise no prehensile power whatever. 588. According to the Design and End of Nature, mammiferous animals are calculated, when arrived at maturity, to subsist cn various kinds of fooc!,— some to live wholly upon flesh, others upon grain, herbs, or fruits ; but in their infant state, milk is the appropriate food of the whole. That this food may never fail them, it is universally ordained, that the young should no sooner come into the world, than the milk should flow in abundance into the members with which the mother is supplied for the secretion of that nutritious fluid. By a wonderful instinct of Nature, too, the young animal, almost as soon as it has come into life, searches for the teat, and knows perfcotly, at the f^rst, how, by the process of suction, it will be able to extract the fluid necessary to its existence. 589. In the General Economy of Nature, this class of animals sgcdis destined to preserve a constant equilibrium in the number of anim^ated beings that hold their existence on the surface of the earth. To man they are imme- diately useful in various ways. Some of their bodies afford him food, their skin shoes, and their fleece clothes. Some of them unite with him in participating the dangers of combat with an enemy, and others assist him in the chase, in exterminating wilder sorts^ or banishing them from the haunts of civilization.272 MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. Many, indeed, are injurious to him ; but most of tliem, in some shape or other, he turns to his service. Of these there is none he has made more subservient to his purposes than the common ox, of which there is scarcely a part that lie has not been able to convert into some useful purpose. Of the horns he makes drinking-vessels, knife-handles, combs, and boxes; and when they are softened by means of boiling water, he fashions them into transparent plates for lan- terns. This invention is ascribed to King Alfred, who is said to have been the first to use them to preserve his candle time-measures from the wind. Glue is made of the cartilages, gristles, and the finer pieces of the parings and cuttings of the hides. Their bone is a cheap substitute for ivory. The thhi- nest of the calf-skins are manufactured into vellum. Their blood is made the basis of Prussian blue, and saddlers use a fine sort of thread prepared from their sinews. The hair is used in various valuable manufactures; the suet, fat, and tallow, are moulded into candles ; and the milk and cream of the cow yield butter and cheese. Thus is every part of this animal valuable to man, who has spared no jDains to bring it to the highest state of perfection. 590. Amoxg the various Breeds of the Ox, upon which man hafs bestowed his highest powers of culture, there is now none takes a higlier place than that known by the name of Skort-Horns. From the earliest f.ges, Great Britain has been distinguished for the excellence of her native breeds of cattle, and there are none in England that have obtained greater celebrity than those which have this name, and which originated, about seventy years ago, on the banks of the Tecs. Thence they have spread into the valleys of the Tweed; thence to the Lothians, in Scotland; and south- ward, into the fine pastures of England. They are now esteemed the SEOKT-UOESr GOV/. tiUORT-nOEN BULL. most profitable breed of cattle, as there is no animal which attains sooner to maturity, and none that supplies meat of a superior quality. The value of some of the improved breeds is something enormous. At the sale of Mr. Charles Colling, a breeder in Yorkshire, in 1810, his bull Comet'* sold for 1,000 guineas. At the sale of Earl Spencer s herd in 1846, 104 cows, heifers, and calves, with nineteen bulls, fetched £8,468. 5s. ; being an average of £(^8. 17s. apiece. The value of such animals is scarcely to be estimated by273 THE OX. those who are unacquainted with the care with which they are tended, and with the anxious attention which is paid to the purity of their breed, A modem writer^ well acquainted with this subject, says, "There are now, at least, five hundred herds, large and small, in this kingdom, and from six to seven thousand head registered every alternate year in the herd-book." The necessity for thus recording the breeds is greater than might, at first sight, be imagined, as it tends directly to preserve the character of the cattle, while it sometimes adds to the value and reputation of the animal thus entered. Besides, many of the Americans, and large purchasers for the foreign market, will not look at an animal without the breeder has taken care to qualify him for such reference. Of short-horned stock, there is annually sold from £40,000 to £50,000 wortli by public auction, independent of the vast numbers disposed of by private contract. The breed is highly prized in Belgium, Prussia, France, Italy, and Russia; it is imported into most of the British colonies, and is greatly esteemed both for its meat and its dairy produce, wherever it is known. The quickness with which it takes on fiesh, and the weight which it frequently makes, are well known ; but we may mention that it is not uncommon to see steers of from four to five years old realize a weight of from 800 to 1,000 lbs. Such animals command from the butcher from £30 to £40 per head, according to the quality; whilst others, of two or three years old, and, of course, of less weight, bring as much as £20 apiece. 591. Long-Horns.—This is the prevailing breed in our midland counties and in Ireland ; but they are greatly inferior to the short-horns, and are fast being supplanted by them. Even where they have been cultivated wilh the nicest care and brought to the greatest perfection, they are inferior to the others, and must ultimately be driven from the farm. 592. The Aldskney.—Among the dairy breeds of England, the Alderney takes a prominent place, not on account of the quantity of milk which it yields, but on account of the excellent quality of the cream and butter which are produced from it. Its docility is marvellous, and in appearance it greatly resembles the Ayrshire breed of Scotland, the excellence of which is supposed LOITG-HORN" BULL, LONG-HORN COW.MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. 274 to be, in some degree, derived from a mixture of the Alderney blood with that breed.

ALDEEITEY BUtt. quality of the milk which they severally produce; that of the Alderney being rich in quality, and that of the Ayrshire abundant in quantity. The merit of the former, however, ends with its milk, for as a grazer it is worthless. 593. Scottish Breeds.—Of these the Kyloe, which belongs to the Highlands of Scotland ; the Galloway, which has been called the Kyloe without horns; and the Ayrshire, are the breeds most celebrated. The first has kept his place, and on account of the compactness of his form, and the excellent quality of his flesh, he is a great favourite with butchers who have a select family trade. It GALLOWAY BULL. ©ALtOWAY COW. is alike unsuitable lor the dairy and the arable farm ; but in its native High- lands it attains to great perfection, thriving upon the scanty and coarse herbage which it gathers on the sides of the mountains. The Galloway has a larger frame, and when fattened makes excellent beef. But it has given place to the short-horns in its native district, where turnip-husbandry is pursued with advantage. The Ayrshire is peculiarly adapted for the dairy, and for the abundance of its milk cannot be surpassed in its native district. In this it stands unrivalled, and there is no other breed capable of converting275 BEEP. the produce of a poor soil into such fine butter and cheese. It is difficult to fatten, however, and its beef is of a coarse quality. We have chosen these as among the principal representative breeds of the ox species ; but there are other breeds which, at all events, have a local if not a general celebrity. 594. The general Mode of Slaughtering Oxen in this country is by striking them a smart blow with a hammer or poleaxe on the head, a little above the eyes. By this means, when the blow is skilfully given, the beast is brought down at one blow, and, to prevent recovery, a cane is generally inserted, by which the spinal cord is perforated, which in- stantly deprives the ox of all sensation of pain. In Spain, and some other countries on the continent, it is also usual to deprive oxen of life by the opera- tion of pithing or dividing tho spinal cord in the neck, close to the back part of the head. This is, in effect, the same mode as is practised in the celebrated Spanish bull-fights by the matador, and it is instantaneous in depriving the animal of sensation, if the operator be skilful. We hope and believe that those men whose disagreeable duty it is to slaughter the ^'beasts of the field" to provide meat for mankind, inflict as little punish- ment and cause as little suffering as possible, 595. The Manner in which a Side of Beef is cut up in London, is shown in the engraving on this page. In the metropolis, on ac- count of the large number of its population possessing the means to indulge in the ^'best of every- thing," the demand for the most dehcate joints of meat is great, the price, at the same time, being much higher for these than for the other parts. The consequence is, that in London the carcass is there divided so as to obtain the greatest quantity of meat on the most esteemed joints. In many places, T 2 SIDE OP BEEF, SHOWING THE SEVEEAL JOINTS.MODERN nOUSEHOLD COOKEIIT. 273 hov/ever^ v/here, from a greater equality in the social condition and habits of the inhabitants, the demand and prices for the different parts of the carcasses are more equalized, there is not the same reason for the butcher to cut the best joints so largo. 596. The Meat on those Parts of the Animal in which the muscles are least called into action, is most tender and succulent; as, for instance, along the back, from the rump to the hinder part of the shoulder ; whilst the limbs, shoulder, and neck, are the toughest, driest, and least-esteemed. 597. The Names op the several Joints in the hind and fore quarters of a side of beef, and the purposes for which they are used, are as follows:— HIND quarter. 1. Sirloin.—The tv70 sirloins, cut together in one joint, form a baron ; this, when roasted, is the famous national dish of Englishmen, at entertainments, on occasion of rejoicing. 2. Rump,—the finest part for steaks. 3. Aitch-bone,—boiling piece. 4. Buttock,—prime boiling piece. 5. Mouse-round,—boiling or stewing. 6. Hock,—stewing. 7. Thick flank, cut with the udder-fat,—primest boiling piece. 8. Thin flank,—boiling. fore quarter. 9. Five ribs, called the fore-rib.—This is considered the primest roasting piece. 10. Four ribs, called the middle-rib,—greatly esteemied by housekeepers as the most economical joint for roasting. 11. Two ribs, called the chuck-rib,—used for second quality of steaks. 12. Leg-of-mutton piece,—the muscles of the shoulder dissected from the breast. 13. Brisket, or breast,—used for boiling, after being salted. 1-1. Neck, clod, and sticking-piece,—used for soups, gravies,, stocks, pies, and mincing for sausages. 15. Shin,—stewing. The following is a classification of the qualities of meat, according to the several joints of beef, when cut up in the London manner. First class—includes the sirloin, with the kidney suet (1), the rump-steak piece (2), the fore-rib (9). Seco7id class.—The buttock (4), the thick flank (7), the middle-rib (10). Third class.~The aitch-bone (3), the mouse-round (5), the thin flank (8), the chuck (11), the leg-of-mutton piece (12), the brisket (13). Fourth class.~The neck, clod, and sticking-pieco (14). Fifth class.—The hock (6), the shin (15). iMODERN MODE OF SERVING DISHES.RECIPESe CHAPTER XIII. BAKED BEEF (Cold Meat Cookery). I. 598. Ikgeedients.—About 2 lbs. of cold roast beef, 2 small onions^ 1 large carrot or two small ones, 1 turnip, a small bunch, of savoury herbs, salt and pepper to taste, 4 tablespoonfuls of gravy, 3 tablespoon- fuls of ale, crust or mashed potatoes. Mode.—Cn.t the beef in slices, allowing a small amount of fat to each slice; place a layer of this in the bottom of a pie-dish, with a portion of the onions, carrots, and turnips, which must be sliced; mince the herbs, strew them over the meat, and season with pepper and salt. Then put another layer of meat, vegetables, and seasoning; and proceed in this manner until all the ingredients are used. Pour in the gravy and ale (water may be substituted for the former, but it is not so nice), cover with a crust or mashed potatoes, and bake for i hour, or rather longer. Time.—Rather more than f hour. Ave7'age costy exclusive of the meat, Gd. /Sufficient for 5 or 6 persons. Seasonable at any time.

Mode.•—Buttev the sides of a deep dish, and spread mashed pota- toes over the bottom of it; on this place layers of beef in thin slices (this may be minced if there is not sufficient beef to cut into slices) ^278 MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. well seasoned with pepper and salt, and a very little onion and herbs, which should be preyiously fried of a nice brown ; then put another layer of mashed potatoes, and beef, and other ingredients, as before; pour in the gravy or sauce, cover the whole with another layer of potatoes, and bake for 4 hour. This may be served in the dish, or turned out. Time.—| hour. Average cost, exclusive of the cold beef, Gd. Sufficient.—A. large pie-dish full for 5 or 6 persons. Seasonable at any time. Beef.—The quality of beef depends on various circumstances; sncli as the age, the sex, the breed of the animal, and also on the food upon which it has been raised. Bull beef is, in general, dry and tough, and by no means possessed of an agreeable flavour; whilst the flesh of the ox is not only highly nourishing and digestible, but, if not too old , extremely agreeable. The flesh of the cow is, also, nourishing, but it is not so agreeable as that of the ox, although that of a heifer is held in high estimation. The flesh of the smaller breeds is much sweeter than that of the larger, which is best when the animal is about seven years old. That of the smaller breeds is best at about five years, and that of the cow can hardly be eaten too young. BAKED BEEP-STEAK PUDDHsTG. 600. Ikgeedients.—6 oz. of flour, 2 eggs, not quite 1 pint of milk, salt to taste, li lb. of rump-steaks, 1 kidney, pepper and salt. Mode,—Cut the steaks into nice square pieces, with a small quantity of fat, and the kidney divide into small pieces. Make a batter of flour, eggs, and milk in the above proportion ; lay a little of it at the bottom of a pie-dish; then put in the steaks and kidney, which should be well seasoned with pepper and salt, and pour over the remainder of the batter, and bake for 1^ hour in a brisk but not fierce oven. Time.—14 hour. Average costy 2s, Sufficient for 4 or 5 persons. Seasonable at any time. BEEE A IiA MODE. {Economical.) 601. IiTOiiEDTETTTS.—About 3 Ibs. of clod or sticking of beef, 2 oz. of clarified dripping, 1 large onion, flour, 2 quarts of water, 12 berries of allspice, 2 bay-leaves, 4 teaspoonful of whole black pepper, salt to taste. Ilode.—Cut the beef into small pieces, and roll them in flour; put the dripping into a stewpan with the onion, which should be sliced thin. Let it get quite hot; lay in the pieces of beef, and stir them well about. When nicely browned all over, add degrees boiling water in the above proportion, and, as the water is added, keep the whole well stirred. Put in the spice, bay-leaves, and seasoning, cover the stewpan closely, and set it by the side of the fire to stew very279 BEEF.

Zd* Sufficient for 6 persons. Seasonable at any time. BEEF A IiA MODE. 6o2. Ingeedients.—6 or 7 lbs. of the thick flank of beef, a few slices of fat bacon, 1 teacupful of vinegar, black pepper, allspice, 2 cloves well mixed and finely pounded, making altogether 1 heaped teaspoon- ful; salt to taste, 1 bunch of savoury herbs, including parsley, all finely minced and well mixed; 3 onions, 2 large carrots, 1 turnip, 1 head of celery, 1^ pint of water, 1 glass of port wine. Mode—Sliee and fry the onions of a pale brown, and cut up the other vegetables in small pieces, and prepare the beef for stewing in the following manner:—Choose a fine piece of beef, cut the bacon into long slices, about an inch in thickness, dip them into vinegar, and then into a little of the above seasoning of spice, &c., mixed with the same quantity of minced herbs. With a sharp knife make holes deep enough to let in the bacon ; then rub the beef over with the remainder of the seasoning and herbs, and bind it up in a nice shape with tape. Have ready a well-tinned stewpan (it should not be much larger than the piece of meat you are cooking), into which put the beef, with the vegetables, vinegar, and water. Let it simmer ver^ gently for 5 hours, or rather longer, should the meat not be extremely tender, and turn it once or twice. "When ready to serve, take out the beef, remove the tape, and put it on a hot dish. Skim off every particle of fat from the gravy, add the port wine, just let it boil, pour it over the beef, and it is ready to serve. Great care must be taken that this does not boil fast, or the meat will be tough and tasteless ; it should only just bubble. "When convenient, all kinds of stews, &c., should be cooked on a hot-plate, as the process is so much more gradual than on an open fire. Time.—5 hours, or rather more. Average cost, 7d. per lb. Svfficient for 7 or 8 persons. Seasonable all the year, but more suitable for a winter dish. Good Meat.—The Iyer of meat wlaen fresWy killed, and the animal, when slaughtered, heing in a state of perfect health, adheres lirnily to the bones. Beef of the best quality is of a deep-red colour; and when the animal has approached maturity, and been well fed, the lean is intermixed with fat, giving it the mottled appearance which is so much esteemed. It is also full of juice, which resembles in colour claret wine. The fat of the best beef is of a firm and waxy consistency, of a colour resembling that of the finest grass butter; bright in appearance, neither greasy nor friable to the touch, but moderately unctuous, in a medium degree between the last-mentioned properties.280 MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. BEEF-STEAKS AND OYSTER SAUCE. 603. Ingredients.—3 dozen oysters, ingredients for oyster sauce {see No. 492), 2 lbs. of rump-steak, seasoning to taste of pepper and salt. Mode.—Moke the oyster sauce by recipe No. 492, and when that is ready, put it by the side of the fire, but do not let it keep boiling. Have the steaks cut of an equal thickness, broil them over a very clear fire, turning them often, that the gravy may not escape. In about 8 minutes they will be done, when put them on a very hot dish; smother with the oyster sauce, and the remainder send to table in a tureen. Serve quickly. Time.—'About 8 to 10 minutes, according to the thickness of the steak. Average cost, Is. per lb. Sufficient for 4 persons. Seasonable from September to April, BEEF-STEAK PIE. 604. Ingredients.—3 lbs. of rump-steak, seasoning to taste of salt, cayenne, and black pepper, crust, water, the yolk of an egg. Mode.—Have the steaks cut from a rump that has hung a few days, that they may be tender, and be particular that every portion is per- fectly sweet. Cut the steaks into pieces about 3 inches long and 2 wide, allowing a small piece of fat to each piece of lean, and arrange the meat in layers in a pie-dish. Between each layer sprinkle a seasoning of salt, pepper, and, when liked, a few grains of cayenne. Fill the dish sufficiently with meat to support the crust, and to give it a nice raised appearance when baked, and not to look flat and hollow. Pour in sufficient water to half fill the dish, and border it with paste (see Pastry); brush it over with a little water, and put on the cover ; slightly press dovv^n the edges with the thumb, and trim oflt* close to the dish. Orna- ment the pie with leaves, or pieces of paste cut in any shape that i'ancy may direct, brush it over with the beaten yolk of an egg; make a hole in the top of the crust, and bake in a hot oven for about 'II hour. Ti7ne.—In a hot oven, li hour. Average costy for this size, 35. 6d. Sufficient for 6 or 8 persons. Seasonable at any time. Note.—Beef-steak pies may be flavoured in various ways, with oysters andBEEF. their liquor, mushrooms, minced onions, kc. For family pies, suet may bo used instead of butter or lard for the crust, and clariiied beef-dripping answers very well where economy is an object. Pieces of underdone roast or boiled meat may in pies be used very advantageously ; but always remove the bone from pie-meat, unless it be chicken or game. We have directed that the meat shall be cut smaller than is usually the case; for on trial we have found it much more tender, more easily helped, and with more gravy, than when put into the dish in one or two large steaks. BEEF-STEAK AHD KIDNEY PUDDIlSra-. 605. Ingbediekts.—2 lbs. of rump-steak, 2 kidneys, seasoning to taste of salt and black pepper, suet crust made with milk {see Pastry), in the proportion of 6 oz. of suet to each 1 lb. of flour. ilib^/e.—Procure some tender rump steak (that which has been hung a little time), and divide it into pieces about an inch square, and cut each kidney into 8 pieces. Line the dish (of which we have given an engraving) with crust made with suet and flour in the above proportion, leaving a small piece of crust to overlap the edge. Then cover the bottom with a portion of the steak and a few pieces of kidney; season with salt and pepper (some add a little flour to thicken the gravy, but it is not necessary), and then add another layer of steak, kidney, and seasoning. Proceed in this manner till the dish is full, when pour in sufficient water to come within 2 inches of the top of the basin. Moisten the edges of the crust, cover the pudding over, press the two crusts together, that the gravy may not escape, and turn up the overhanging paste. -far • i. 1 • 1, i. i.

If the water diminishes, always replenish with some, hot in a jug, as the pudding should be kept covered all the time, and not allowed to stop boiling. "When the cloth is removed, cut out a round piece in the top of the crust, to prevent the pudding bursting, and send it to table in the basin, either in an ornamental dish, or with a napkin pinned round it. Serve quickly. Titne.—'For a pudding with 2 lbs. of steak and 2 kidneys allow 4 hours. Average costy 2s. Sd, Sufficient fov 6-persons. Seasonable all the year, but more suitable in winter. J^^'ote.—Beef-steak pudding may be very much enriched bv adding a few-282 MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. oysters or mushrooms. The above recipe was contributed to this work by a Sussex lady, in which county the inhabitants are noted for their savoury puddings. It differs from the general way of making them, as the meat is cut up into very small pieces and the basin is differently shaped : on trial, this pudding will be found far nicer, and more full of gravy, than when laid in large pieces in the dish. Bad Meat.—In the flesh of animals slaughtered whilst suffering acute inflammation or fever, the hollow fibres, or capillaries, as they are called, which form the substance of the Iyer, are filled with congested and unassimilated animal fluid, which, from its impurity, gives the Iyer a dark colour, and produces a tendency to rapid putrefaction. In a more advanced stage of such disease, serous, and sometimes purulent matter, is formed in the cellular tissues between the muscles of the flesh; and when such is the case, nothing can be more poisonous than such abominable carrion. In the flesh of animals killed whilst under the influence of any disease of an emaciating effect, the Iyer adheres but slightly to the bones, with its fibres contracted and dry; and the little fat that there may be is friable, and shrunk within its integuments. The flesh of animals slaughtered whilst under considerable depression of vital energy (as from previous bleeding) has a a diminished tendency to stifi'en after death, the feebleness of this tendency being in proportion to the degree of depression. It presents, also, an unnatural blue or pallid appearance, has a faint and slightly sour smell, and soon becomes putrid. When an animal has died otherwise than by slaughtering, its flesh is flaccid and clammy, emits a peculiar faint and disagreeable smell, and, it need scarcely be added, spontaneous 'decomposition proceeds very rapidly. BEEP-STEAKS WITH PBIED POTATOES, or BIPTEK AUX POMMES-DE-TEUBE (a la mode Prancaise). 606. Ingeedients.—2 lbs. of steak, 8 potatoes, i lb. of butter, salt and pepper to taste, 1 teaspoonful of minced herbs. Mode—Vut the butter into a frying or saiite pan, set it over the fire, and let it get very hot; peel, and cut the potatoes into long thin slices ; put them into the hot butter, and fry them till of a nice brown colour. ISfow broil the steaks over a bright clear fire, turning them frequently, that every part may be equally done: as they should not be thick, 5 minutes will broil them. Put the herbs and seasoning in the butter the potatoes were fried in, pour it under the steak, and place the fried potatoes round, as a garnish. To have this dish in perfection, a portion of the fillet of the sirloin should be used, as the meat is generally so much more tender than that of the rump, and the steaks should be cut about g of an inch in thickness. Time»—5 minutes to broil the steaks, and about the same time to fry the potatoes. Average cost^ Is, per lb. Sufficient for 4 persons. Seasonable all the year ; but not so good in warm weather, as the meat cannot hang to get tender. BOILED AITCH-BONE OP BEEP. 607. Ingeedients.—Beef, water. Mode.—Aiter this joint has been in salt 5 or 6 days, it will beBEEF. 283 ready for use, and will not take so long boiling as a round, for it is not so solid. Wash the meat, and, if too salt, soak it for a few hours, changing the water once or twice, till the required freshness is obtained. Put into a saucepan, or boiling-pot, sufEcient water to cover the meat; set it over the fire, and when it boils, plunge in the joint {see No. 557), and let it boil up quickly. Now draw the pot to the side of the fire, and let the process be very gradual, as the water must only simmer, or the meat will be hard and tough. Carefully remove the scum from the surface of , T , . . « AITCH-BONE OP BEEP. the water, and continue doing this for a few minutes after it first boils. Carrots and turnips are served with this dish, and sometimes suet dumplings, which may be boiled with the beef. Garnish with a few of the carrots and turnips, and serve the remainder in a vegetable-dish. Time.—An aitch-bone of 10 lbs., 2i hours after the water boils; one of 20 lbs., 4 hours. Average cost, 6d. per lb. Sufficient.—10 lbs. for 7 or 8 persons. Seasonable all the year, but best from September to March. liote.—The liquor in which the meat has been boiled maybe easily converted into a very excellent pea-soup. It will require very few vegetables^ as it will be impregnated with the flavour of those boiled with the meat. The Action op Salt on Meat.—The manner in which salt acts in preserving meat is not difficult to understand. By its strong affinity, it, in the first place, extracts the juices from the substance of meat in sufficient quantity to form a saturated solution with the water contained in the juice, and the meat then absorbs the satiirated brine in place of the juice extracted by the salt. In this way, matter incapable of putrefaction takes the places of that portion in the meat which is most perishable. Such, however, is not the only office of salt as a means of preserving meat; it acts also by its astringency in contracting the fibres of the muscles, and so excludes the action of air on the interior of the substance of the meat. The last-mentioned operation of salt as an antiseptic is evinced by the diminution of the volume of meat to which it is applied. The astringent action of saltpetre on meat is much greater than that of salt, and thereby renders meat to which it is applied very hard; but, in small quantities, it considerably assists the antiseptic action of salt, and also prevents the destruction of the florid colour of meat, which is caused by the application of salt. Thus, it will be perceived, from the foregoing statement, that the application of salt and saltpetre diminishes, in a considerable degree, the nutritive, and, to some extent, the wholesome qualities of meat; and, therefore, in their use, the quantity applied should be as small as possible, consistent with the perfect preservation of the meat. BOILED BOUND OF BEEF. 6o8. IxaEEDiENTS.—Beef, water. Mode.—As a whole round of beef, generally speaking, is too large for small families, and very seldom required, we here give the recipe for dressing a portion of the silver side of the round. Take from 12 to 16 lbs.,284 MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. after it has been in salt about 10 days; just wash o& the salt, skewer it up in a nice round-looking form, and bind it with tape to keep the skewers in their places. Put it in a saucepan of boiling water, as in the preceding recipe, set it upon a good fire, and when it begins to boil, carefully remove all scum from the surface, as, if this is not attended to, it sinks on to the meat, and when brought to table, presents a very unsightly appearance. When it is well skimmed, draw the pot to the corner of the fire, and let it simmer very gently until done. Remove the tape and skewers, which should be replaced by a silver one; pour over a little of the pot-liquor, and garnish with carrots. (See coloured plate 2.) Carrots, turnips, parsnips, and sometimes suet dumplings, accompany this dish; and these may all be boiled with the beef. The pot-liquor should be saved, and converted into pea- soup ; and the outside slices, which are generally hard, and of an uninviting appearance, may be cut oif before being sent to table, and potted. These make an excellent relish for the breakfast or luncheon table. Ti?ne.—Part of a round of beef weighing 12 lbs., about 3 hours after the water boils. Average costf Sd. per lb. Sufficient for 10 persons. Seasojiahle all the year, but more suitable for winter. 609. Soyer's Eecipe for Preserving the Gravy in Salt Meat, when it is TO BE SERVED COLD.—Fill two tubs with cold water, into which throw a few pounds of rough ice ; and when the meat is done, put it into one of the tubs of ics-water; let it remain 1 minute, when take out, and put it into the other tub. Fill the first tub again v/ith water, and continue this process for about 20 minutes; then set it upon a dish, and let it remain until quite cold. Wheii cut, the fat will be as white as possible, besides having saved the whole of the gravy. If there is no ice, spring water will answer the same purpose, but will require to be more frequently changed. Note.—The Brisket and EuMPmay be boiled by the above recipe; of course allowing more or less time, according to the size of the joint. BEEF CAKE. 610. INGKEDIENTS.—The remains of cold roast beef; to each pouiid of cold meat allow i lb. of bacon or ham ; seasoning to taste of pepper and salt, 1 small bunch of minced savoury herbs, 1 or 2 eggs. Ilode,—Mince the beef very finely (if underdone it will be better), add to it the bacon, which must also be chopped very small, and mix well together. Season, stir in the herbs, and bind with an egg, or 2 should 1 not be sufficient. Make it into small square cakes, aboutBEEF. 285 h incli thick, fry them in hot drix^pingf, and serve in a dish Y>^ith good. gravy poured round them. Tijne.—10 minutes. A verage cost, exclusive of the cold meat, Qd, Seasonable at any time. BROILSD BESF-STSAKS or BUMP-STEAKS. 611. IifGREDiENTS.—Stcaks, a piece of butter the size of a walnut, salt to taste, 1 tablespoonful of good mushroom ketchup or Harvey's sauce. 3fode.—As the success of a good broil so much depends on tho state of the fire, see that it is bright and clear, and perfectly free from smoke, and do not add any fresh fuel just before you require to use the gridiron. Sprinkle a little salt over the fire, put on the gridiron for a few minutes, to get thoroughly hot through ; rub it with a piece of fresh suet, to prevent the meat from sticking, and lay on the steaks, which should be cut of an equal thickness, about f of an inch, or rather thinner, and level them by beating them as Utile as possible with a rolling-pin. Turn them frequently with steak-tongs (if these are not at hand, stick a fork in the edge of the fat, that no gravy escapes), and in from 8 to 10 minutes they will be done. Have ready a very hot dish, into which put the ketchup, and, when liked, a little minced shalot; dish up the steaks, rub them over with butter, and season with pepper and salt. The exact time for broiling steaks must be determined by taste, whether they are liked underdone or well done; more than from 8 to 10 minutes for a steak f inch in thickness, we think, would spoil and dry up the juices of the meat. Great expe- dition is necessary in sending broiled steaks to table; and, to have them in perfection, they should not be cooked till everything else prepared for dinner has been dished up, as their excellence entirely depends on their being served very hot. Garnish with scraped horseradish, or dices of cucumber. Oyster, tomato, onion, and many other sauces, are frequent accompaniments to rump-steak, but true lovers of this English dish generally reject all additions but pepper and salt. Twie.—8 to 10 minutes. Average cost, Is. per lb. Sufficient.—Allow i lb. to each person; if the party consist entirely of gentlemen, f lb. will not be too much. Seasonable all the year, but not good in the height of summer, as the meat cannot hang long enough to be tender. BiPPERENT Seasons pob Beep.—We have already stated {see ITo. 593) tliat tlie Scots breed of oxen, like the South-down in mutton, stands first in excellence. Ifc should be borne in mind, however, that each county has its particular season, and that tha London and other large markets are always supphed by those counties whose meat, from local circumstances, is in the best condition at the time. Thus, the season in Norfolk, from which the Scots come (these being the principal oxen bred by the lS"orfolkMODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. 283 and Suffolk graziers), comiTiences about Christmas and terminates about June, when this breed begins to fall oif, their place being taken by grass-fed oxen. A large quantity of most ezcellent meat is sent to the " dead markets" from Scotland, and some of the best London butchers are supplied from this source. BROILED BEEl^ AISTD MUSHROOM SAUCE (Cold Meat Cookery). 612. Ingredients.—2 or 3 dozen small button mTishrooms, 1 oz. of butter, salt and cayenne to taste, 1 tablespoonful of mushroom ketchup, mashed potatoes, slices of cold roast beef. 3Iode,—AYipe the mushrooms free from grit with a piece of flannel, and salt; put them in a stewpan with the butter, seasoning*, and ketchup ; stir over the fire until the mushrooms are quite done, when pour it in the middle of mashed potatoes, browned. Then place round the potatoes slices of cold roast beef, nicely broiled, over a clear fire. In making the mushroom sauce, the ketchup may be dispensed with, if there is sufficient gravy. Time,—| hour. Average cost, exclusive of the meat, 8c?. 8ea$oncible from August to October. BROILED BEEF AND OYSTER SAUCE (Cold Meat Cookery). 613. Ingeedients.—2 dozen oysters, 3 cloves, 1 blade of mace, 2 oz. of butter, i teaspoonful of flour, cayenne and salt to taste, mashed potatoes, a few slices of cold roast beef. Mode.—Vvit the oysters in a stewpanj with their liquor strained; add the cloves, mace, butter, flour, and seasoning, and let them simmer gently for 5 minutes. Have ready in the centre of a dish round walls of mashed potatoes, browned; into the middle pour the oyster sauce, quite hot, and round the potatoes place, in layers, slices of the beef, which should be previously broiled over a nice clear fire. Time—5 minutes. Average cost, Is, 6c?., exclusive of the cold meat. Sufficient for 4 or 5 persons. Seasonable from September to April. BROILED BEEP-BONES. 614. Ingredients.—The bones of ribs or sirloin; salt, pepper, and cayenne. Diode.—Separate the bones, taking care that the meat on them is not too thick in any part; sprinkle them well with the above season- ing, and broil over a very clear fire. When nicely browned, they are done; but do not allow them to blacken.287 BEEP. TO DKESS A BULLOCK'S HEART, 615. Ingbebients.—1 heart, stuffing of veal forcemeat, ITo. 417. Mode.—Put the heart into warm water to soak for 2 hours; then wipe it well with a cloth, and, after cutting off the lobes, stuff the inside with a highly-seasoned forcemeat (No. 417). Fasten it in, by means of a needle and coarse thread ; tie the heart up in paper, and set it before a good fire, being very particular to keep it well basted, or it will eat dry, there being very little of its own fat. Two or three minutes before serving, remove the paper, baste well, and serve with good gravy and red-currant jelly or melted butter. If the heart is very large, it will require 2 hours, and, covered with a caul, may be baked as well as roasted. Time.—Large heart, 2 hours. Average cost^ 25. Qd, Sufficient for 6 or 8 persons.

TO CLAilIFY BESF DBIPPHMG. I. 621. Good and fresh dripping answers very well for basting every- thing except game and poultry, and, when well clarified, serves for frying nearly as well ^as lard; it should be kept in a cool place, and will remain good some time. To clarify it, put the dripping into a basin, pour over it boiling water, and keep stirring the whole to wash, away the impurities. Let it stand to cool, when the water and dirty sediment will settle at the bottom of the basin. Eemove the dripping, and put it away in jars or basins for use. ANOTHER WAY. 6-22. Put the dripping into a clean saucepan, and let it boil for a feW minutes over a slow fire, and be careful to skim it well. Let it stand to cool a little, then strain it through a piece of muslin into jars for use. Beef dripping is preferable to any other for cooking purposes, as, with mutton dripping, there h }iable to be a tallowy taste and smelL BOAST FILLET OF BEEF (Larded). iNGUEDiENTS.—About 4 Ibs. of the inside fillet of the sirloin, uMODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. 290 1 onion, a small bunch of parsley, salt and pepper to taste, sufficient vinegar to cover the meat, glaze, Spanish sauce, No. 411. 3Iode.—Lard the beef with bacon, and put it into a pan with suffi- cient vinegar to cover it, with an onion sliced, parsley, and seasoning, and let it remain in this piclde for 12 hours. Roast it before a nice clear fire for about 1^ hour, and, v/hen done, glaze it. Pour some Spanish sauce round the beef, and the remainder serve in a tureen. It may be garnished v\^ith Spanish onions boiled and glazed. Time.—1 j hour. Average cost, exclusive of the sauce, 45. Sufficient for 6 or 8 persons. Seasonable at any time. FEICAKTDEAU OP BEEF. 624. Ikgeedienis.—About 3 lbs. of the inside fillet of the sirloin (a piece of the rump may be substituted for this), pepper and salt to taste, 3 cloves, 2 blades of mace, 6 whole allspice, 1 pint of stock JSTo. 105, or water, 1 glass of sherry, 1 bunch of savoury herbs, 2 shalots, bacon. Mode—Cut some bacon into thin strips, and sprinkle over them a seasoning of pepper and salt, mixed with cloves, mace, and allspice, well pounded. Lard the beef with these, put it into a stewpan with the stock or water, sherry, herbs, shalots, 2 cloves, and more pepper and salt. Stew the meat gently until tender, when take it out, cover it closely, skim off all the fat from the gravy, and strain it. Set it on the fire, and boil, till it becomes a glaze. Glaze the larded side of the beef with this, and serve on sorrel sauce, which is made as follows:—Wash and pick some sorrel, and put it into a stewpan with only the water that hangs about it. Keep stirring, to prevent its burning, and when done, lay it in a sieve to drain. Chop it, and stew it with a small piece of butter and 4 or 5 tablespoonfuls of good gravy, for an hour, and rub it through a tammy. If too acid, add a little sugar; and a little cabbage-lettuce boiled with the sorrel will be found an improvement. Ti7ne—2 hours to gently stew the meat. Average cost, for this quantity, 45. Su-fficient for 6 persons. Seasonable at any time. FBIED SALT BEEP (Cold Meat Cookery). 625. Ingeedients.—A few slices of cold salt beef, pepper to taste, I lb. of butter, mashed potatoes. Mode,—Cut any part of cold salt beef into thin slices, fry them291 BEEF. gently in butter, and season with a little pepper. Have ready some very hot mashed potatoes, lay the slices of beef on them, and garnish with 3 or 4 pickled gherkins. Cold salt beef, warmed in a little liquor from mixed pickle, drained, and served as above, will be found good. Time.—About 5 minutes. Average cost, exclusive of the meat, 4J. Seasonable at any time. FRIED KUMP-STEAK. 626. Inge-EDIEITTS.—Steaks, butter or clarified dripping. Ifode.—Although broiling is a far superior method of cooking steaks to frying them, yet, when the cook is not very expert, the latter mode may be adopted ; and, when properly done, the dish may really look very inviting, and the flavour be good. The steaks should be cut rather thinner than for broiling, and with a small quantity of fat to each. Put some butter or clarified dripping into a frying-pan; let it get quite hot, then lay in the steaks. Turn them frequently until done, which Vv'ill be in about 8 minutes, or rather more, should the steaks be very thick. Serve on a very hot dish, in which put a small piece of butter and a tablespoonful of ketchup, and season with pepper and salt. They should be sent to table quickly, as, when cold, the steaks are entirely spoiled. Ti7ne.—8 minutes for a medium-sized steak, rather longer for a very thick one. Average cost. Is. per lb. Seasonaole ail the year, but not good in summer, as the meat carinot hang to get tender. Note,—Where much gravy is liked, make it in the follovfing manner:—As soon as the steaks are done, dish them, pour a little boiling water into the frying-pan, add a seasoning of pepper and salt, a small piece of butter, and a tablespoonful of Harvey's sauce or mushroom ketchup. Hold the pan over the fire for a minute or two, just let the gravy simmer, then pour on the steak, and serve. A FitENcnaTAN's Opinioit of Beef.—The following is translated from a celebrated modern French work, the production of one who in Paris enjoys a great reputation as cook and chemist:—The flesh of the ox, to be in the best condition, should be taken from an animal of from four to six years old, and neither too fat nor too lean. This meat, whicli possesses in the liighest degree the most nutritive qualities, is generally easily digested ; stock is made from it, and it is eaten boiled, broiled, roasted, stewed, braised, and in a hundred other different ways. Beef is the foundation of stock, gravies, braises, &c.; its nutritious and succulent gravy gives body and flavour to numberless ragouts. It is an exhaustless mine in the hands of a skillul artist, and is truly the king of the kitchen. Without it, no soup, no gravy; and its absence would produce almost a famine in the civilized world ! BEEF FRITTEBS (Cold Meat Cookery). 627.

Should the batter be too thick, more water must be added. Pare down the cold beef into thin shreds, season with pepper and salt, and mis it with the batter. Drop a small quantity at a time into a pan of boiling lard, and fry from 7 to 10 minutes, according to the size. Yv'hen done on one side, turn and brown them on the other. Let them dry for a minute or two before the Are, and serve on a folded napkin. A small quantity of finely- minced onions, mixed w^ith the batter, is an improvement. Time.—From 7 to 10 minutes. Average cost, exclusive of the meat, Qd. Seasonable at any time. HASI-IED BEEF (Cold Meat Cookery). I. 628. Ingredients.—Gravy saved from the meat, 1 teaspoonfal of tomato sauce, 1 teaspoonful of Harvey's sauce, 1 teaspoonful of good mushroom ketchup, | glass of port wine or strong ale, pepper and salt to taste, a little flour to thicken, 1 onion finely minced, a few slices of cold roast beef. 3lode.—Put all the ingredients but the beef into a stewpan vnth. whatever gravy may have been saved from the meat the day it wa& roasted ; let these simmer gently for 10 minutes, then take the stewpan ofi' the fire; let the gravy cool, and skim off the fat. Cut the beef into thin slices, dredge them with flour, and lay them^ in the gravy ; let the whole simmer gently for 5 minutes, but not boil, or the meat v.iil be tough and hard. Serve very hot, and garnish with sippets of toasted bread. Time.—2Q minutes. Average cost, exclusive of the cold meat, id. Seasonahle at any time. ^ II. 6-29. Ingeedients.—The remains of ribs or sirloin of beef, 2 onions, 1 carrot, 1 bunch of savoury herbs, pepper and salt to taste, | blade of pounded mace, thickening of flour, rather more than 1 pint of water. Mode.—Take off all the meat from the bones of ribs or sirloin of beef; remove the outside brown and gristle; place the meat on one side, and well stew the bones and pieces, with the above ingredients, for about 2 hours, till it becomes a strong gravy, and is reduced to293 BEEF. rather more than 4- pint; strain this, thicken with a teaspoonful of ilour, and let the gravy cool ; skim off all the fat; lay in the meat, let it get hot through, but do not aliov/ it to boil, and garnish with sippets of toasted bread. The gravy may be flavoured as in the preceding recipe. Time.—llather more than 2 hours. Average cost, exclusive of the cold meat, 2d. Seasonahle at any time. Note.—Either of the above recipes may be served in walls of mashed potatoes browned ; in whicli case the sippets should be omitted. Be careful that hashed meat does not boil^ or it will become tough. TO PREPAKS HUNa BEEF. ^30. This is preserved by salting and drying, either with or vrith- out smoke. Hang up the beef 3 or 4 days, till it becomes tender, but take care it does not begin to spoil; then salt it in the usual way, either by dry-salting or by brine, with bay-salt, brown sugar, saltpetre, and a little pepper and allspice; afterv/ards roll it tight in a cloth, and hang it up in a warm, but not hot place, for a fortnight or more, till it is sufficiently hard. If required to have a little of the smoky ilavour, it may be hung for some time in a chimney-corner, or smoked in any other way: it will keep a long time. HUHTES'S BEEF. 631. Ikghedients.—For a round of beef vv^eighing 25 lbs. allow 3 oz. of saltpetre, 3 oz. of coarse sugar, 1 oz. of cloves, 1 grated nutmeg, I oz. of allspice, 1 lb. of salt, f lb. bay-salt. Mode.—Let the beef hang for 2 or 3 days, and remove the bone. Pound spices, salt, (&c. in the above proportion, and let them be reduced to the finest powder. Put the beef into a pan, rub all the ingre- dients well into it, and turn and rub it every day for rather more than a fortnight. Yv'hen it has been sufEeiently long in pickle, wash the meat, bind it up securely with tape, and put it into a pan with I pint of water at the bottom; mince some suet, cover the top of the meat with it, and over the pan put a common crust of flour and water; bake for 6 hours, and, when cold, remove the paste. Save the gravy that flows from it, as it adds greatly to the ilavour of hashes, stews, <jco. The beef may be glazed and garnished with meat jelly. , Time.—Q hours. Seasonahle all the year. Note.—In salting or pickling beef or pork for family consumption, it not being generally required to be kept for a great length of time, a less quantity ofMODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. salt and a larger quantity of other matters more adapted to retain mellowness in meat,, may be employed, which could not be adopted by the curer of the immense quantities of meat required to be preserved for victualling the ship- ping of this maritime country. Sugar, which is well known to possess the jDreserving principle in a very great degree, without the pungency and astrin- gency of salt, may be, and is, very generally used in the preserving of meat for family consumption. Although it acts without corrugating or contracting the fibres of meat, as is the case in the action of salt, and, therefore, does not impair its mellowness, yet its use in sufficient quantities for preservative efiect, without the addition of other antiseptics, would impart a flavour not agreeable to the taste of many persons. It may be used, however, together ■with salt, with the greatest advantage in imparting mildness and mellovmess to cured meat, in a proportion of about one part by weight to four of the mixture; and, perhaps, now that sugar is so much lower in price than it was in former years, one of the obstructions to its more frequent use is removed, TO DBESS BEEF KIDITSY. I. 632. Ingkedients.—1 kidney, clarified butter, pepper and salt to taste, a small quantity of highly-seasoned gravy, 1 tablespoonful of lemon-juice, ^ teaspoonful of powdered sugar. Mode,—Cut the kidneys into neat slices, put them into warm water to soak for 2 hours, and change the water 2 or 3 times; then put them on a clean cloth to dry the water from them, and lay them in a frying-pan with some clarified butter, and fry them of a nice brown ; season each side with pepper and salt, put them round the dish, and the gravy in the middle. Before pouring the gravy in the dish, add the lemon-juice and sugar. Time.~¥rom 5 to 10 minutes. Average cost, 9d. each. Seasonable at any time. II. 633. Ikgeedients.—1 kidney, 1 dessertspoonful of minced parsley, 1 teaspoonful of minced shalot, salt and pepper to taste, | pint of gravy, No. 438, 3 tablespoonfuls of sherry. Mode.—Toke off a little of the kidney fat, mince it very fine, and put it in a frying-pan; slice the kidney, sprinkle over it parsley and shalots in the above proportion, add a seasoning of pepper and salt, and fry it of a nice brown. When it is done enough, dredge over a little flour, and pour in the gravy and sherry. Let it just simmer, but not boil any more, or tlie kidney would harden ; serve very hot, and garnish with croutons. "Where the flavour of the shalot is disliked, it may be omitted, and a small quantity of savoury herbs substituted . for it.BEEF. 295 Time.—From 5 to 10 minutes, according to the thickness of the slices. Average cost, 9c?. each. Sufficient for 3 persons. Seasonalle at any time. III. A more Simple MetJiod. 634. Cut the kidney into thin slices, flour them, and fry of a nice brown. "When done, make a gravy in the pan by pouring away the fat, putting in a small piece of butter, J pint of boiling water, pepper and salt, and a tablespoonful of mushroom ketchup. Let the gravy just boil up, pour over the kidney, and serve. BOILED MABKOW-BOISTES. 635. Ingkebients.—Bones, a small piece of common paste, a floured cloth. 3Iode.—Have the bones neatly sawed into convenient sizes, and cover the ends with a small piece of common crust, made with flour and water. Over this tie a floured cloth, and place them upright in a saucepan of boiling water, taking care there is sufficient to cover the bones. Boil them for 2 hours, remove the cloth and paste, and serve them upright on a napkin with dry toast. Many persons clear the marrow from the bones after they are cooked, spread it over a slice of toast and add a seasoning of pepper ; when served in this manner, it must be very expeditiously sent to table, as it so soon gets cold. Time.—2 hours. Seasonable at any time. I^ote.—Marrow-bones may be baked after preparing them as in the pre- ceding recipe ; they should be laid in a deep dish, and baked for 2 hours. Marrow-Bones.—Bones are formed of a dense cellular tissue of membranous matter, made stiff and rigid by insoluble earthy salts; of which, phosphate of lime is the most abundant. In a large bone, the insoluble matter is generally deposited in such a manner as to leave a cavity, into which a fatty substance, distinguished by the name of marrow, is thrown. Hollow cyhndi-ical bones possess the quahties of strength and lightness in a remarkable degree. If bones were entirely sohd, they would be unnecessarily heavy; and if their mate- rials were brought into smaller compass, they would be weaker, because the strength of a bone is in proportion MARROW-BoifES. to the distance at which its fibres are from the centre. Some animals, it must, how- ever, be observed, have no cavities in the centre of their bones j such as the whale tribe, skate, and turtles. MIJSrOED BEEF (Cold Meat Cookery). 636.

The length of this column, however, varies mnch, and the number of vertebrae of which it is composed is far from being uniform. These numerical differences principally depend on the unequal development of the caudal portion, or tail-end, of the column. Thus, the tail-forming vertebras sometimes do not exist at all,—amongst certain bats for example; in other instances we reckon forty, fifty, and even upwards of sixty of these bones. Among the greater number of mammals, the tail is of little use for locomotion, except that it acts in many cases as does the rudder of a ship, steadying the animal in his rapid movements, and enabling him to turn more easily and quickly. Among some animals, it becomes a very powerful instrument of progression. Thus, in the kangaroos and jerboas, the tail forms, with the hind feet, a kind of tripod from which the animal makes its spring. With most of the American monkeys it is prehensile, and serves the animal as a fifth hand to sus- pend itself from the branches of trees; and, lastly, among the whales, it grows to an enormous size, and becomes the principal instrument for swimming. A PIOKLS FOB, TOIsraUBS OB BEEF (Kewmarket Beeipe). 641. Ingredients.—1 gallon of soft water, 3 lbs. of coarse salt, 6 oz. of coarse brown sugar, | oz. of saltpetre. Mode,—Put all tlie ingredients into a saucepan, and let them boil for i hour, clear off the scum as it rises, and when done pour the pickle into a pickling-pan. Let it get cold, then put in the meat, and allow it to remain in the pickle from 8 to 14 days, according to the size. It will keep good for 6 months if well boiled once a fortnight. Tongues will take 1 month or 6 weeks to be properly cured; and, in salting meat, beef and tongues should always be put in separate vessels. Time.—A moderate-sized tongue should remain in the pickle about a month, and be turned every day. POTTED BEEP. I. 642. Ingredients.—2 lbs. of lean beef, 1 tablespoonful of water, i lb. of butter, a seasoning to taste of salt, cayenne, pounded mace, and black pepper. Mode,—Procure a nice piece of lean beef, as free as possible from gristle, skin, &c., and put it into a jar (if at hand, one with a lid) with 1 tablespoonful of water. Cover it closely^ and put the jar into a saucepan of boiling water, letting the water come within 2 inches of the top of the jar. Boil gently for 3-^ hours, then take the beef, chop it very small with a chopping-knife, and pound it thoroughly in a mortar. Mix with it by degrees all, or a portion, of the gravy that will have run from it, and a little clarilied butter; add the seasoning, put it in small pots for use, and cover with a little batter just vv^armed and poured over. If much gravy is299 BEEF. added to it, it will keep but a short time; on the contrary, if a large proportion of butter is used, it may be preserved for some time. Time—Si hours. Average cost, for this quantity. Is. 8d, Seasonable at any time. POTTED BEEF (Cold Meat Cookers^. ir. 643. Ingredients.—The remains of cold roast or boiled beef, | lb. of butter, cayenne to taste, 2 blades of pounded mace. Ilode.—As we have stated in recipe No. 608, the outside slices of boiled beef may, with a little trouble, be converted into a very nice addition to the breakfast-table. Cut up the meat into small pieces and pound it well, with a little butter, in a mortar; add a seasoning of cayenne and mace, and be very particular that the latter ingredient is reduced to the finest powder. When all the ingredients are thoroughly mixed, put it into glass or earthen potting-pots, and pour on the top a coating of clarified butter. Seasonable at any time. Note.—If cold roast beef is used, remove all pieces of gristle and dry outside pieces, as these do not pound well. Preserved Meats.—When an organic substance, like the flesh of animals, is heated to the boiling-point, it loses the property of passing into a state of fermentation and decay. Fresh animal milk, as is well known, coagulates, after having been kept for two or three days, into a gelatinous mass ; but it may be preserved for an indefinite period, as a perfectly sweet liquid, if it be heated daily to the boiling-iDoint. The knowledge of this effect of an elevated temperature has given rise to a most important branch of in- dustry,—namely, the preparation of preserved meats for the use of the navy and merchant service. At Leith, in the neighbourhood of Edinburgh, at Aberdeen, at Bordeaux, at Marseilles, and in many parts of Germany, establishments of enormous magnitude exist, in which soup, vegetables, and viands of every description are prepared, in such a manner that they retain their freshness for years. The prepared aliments are inclosed in canisters of tinned iron plate, the covers are soldered air-tight, and the canisters exposed to the temperature of boiling water for three or four hours. The aliments thus acquire a stability, which one may almost say is eternal; and when a canister is opened, after the lapse of several years, its contents are found to be unaltered in taste, colour, and smell. We are indebted to the French philosopher Gay-Lussac for this beautiful practical application of the discovery that boiling checks fermentation. An exclusive salt-meat diet is extremely injurious to the health; and, in former times, thousands of mariners lost their lives for the want of fresh aliments during long voyages. We are sorry to say that the preserved meats are sometimes carelessly prepared, and, though the statement seems incredible, sometimes adulterated. Dr. Lankester, who has done so much to expose the frauds of trade, that he ought to be regarded as a public benefactor, says that he has seen things which were utterly unfit for food, shipped as preserved meats. Surely, as he observes, there ought to be some superintendent to examine the so-called articles of food that are taken on board ship, so that the poor men who have been fighting our battles abroad may run no risk of being starved or poisoned on their way home.

Curmer, however, one of the latest writers on the culinary art, tells us that this is a vulgar error, and that French beef is far superior to that of England. This is mere vaunting on the part of our neighbours, who seem to want la gloire in everything; and we should not deign to notice it, if it had occurred in a work of small pretensions ; but M. Curmer's book professes to be a complete exposition of the scientific principles of cookery, and liolds a high rank in the didactic literature of France. We half suspect that M. Curmer obtained his knowledge of English beef in the same way as did the poor Frenchman, whom the late Mr, Mathews, the comedian, so humorously described. Mr. Lewis, in his "Physiology of Common Life," has thus revived the story of the beef-eating son of France :—"A Frenchman was one day blandly remonstrating against the supercilious scorn expressed by Englishmen for the beef of France, which he, for his part, did not find so inferior to that of England. * I have been two times in England/ he remarked, ' but I nevere find the bif so superieur to ours. I find it vary conveenient that they bring it you on leetle pieces of stick, for one penny; but I do not find the bif superieur.' On hearing this, the Englishman, red Vvith astonishment, exclaimed, * Good heavens, sir! you have been eating cat's meat.' " No, M. Curmer, we are ready to acknowledge the superiority of your cookery, but we have long since made up our mmds as to the inferiority of your raw material. OLIVES. I. 650. Ii^-GEEDIEITTS.—2 Ibs. of rump-steak, 1 egg, 1 tablespoonful of minced savoury herbs, pepper and salt to taste, 1 pint of stock, No. 105, 2 or 3 slices of bacon, 2 tablespoonfuls of any store sauce, a slight thickening of butter and flour. Mode.—Have the steaks cut rather thin, slightly beat them to make them level, cut them into 6 or 7 pieces, brush over with egg, and sprinkle v/ith herbs, which should be very finely minced; season with pepper and salt, and roll up the pieces tightly, and fasten with a small skewer. Put the stock in a stewpan that will exactly hold them, for by being pressed together, they will keep their shape better ; lay in the rolls of meat, co^er them with the bacon, cut in thin slices, and over that put a piece of paper. Stew them very gently for full 2 hours; for the slower they are done the better. Take them out, rem.ove the skewers, thicken the gravy with butter and flour, andd03 BEEF. flavour with any store sauce tliat may be preferred. Give one boil, pour over the meat, and serve. Time.—-2. hours. Average costy Is. per pound. Sufficient for 4 or 5 persons. Seasonable at any time. II. {Economical.) 651. Ingeedients.—The remains of underdone cold roast beef, bread crumbs, 1 shalot finely minced, pepper and salt to taste, gravy made from the beef bones, thickening of butter and fiour, 1 table- spoonful of mushroom ketchup. Ifode.—Cut some slices of underdone roast beef about half an inch thick; sprinkle over them some bread crumbs, minced shalot, and a little of the fat and seasoning ^ roll them, and fasten with a small skewer. Have ready some gravy made from the beef bones ; put in the pieces of meat, and stew them till tender, which will be in about I5 hour, or rather longer. Arrange the meat in a dish, thicken and flavour the gravy, and pour it over the meat, when it is ready to serve. Time.—1^ hour. Average costy exclusive of the beef, 2d. Seasonalle at any time. BBOILED OX-TAIL (an Entree). 652. IiTGHEDiENTS.—2 tails, if pint of stock, No. 105, salt and cayenne to taste, bread crumbs, 1 egg. Mode.—Joint and cut up the tails into convenient-sized pieces, and put them into a stewpan, with the stock, cayenne, and salt, and, if liked very savoury, a bunch of sweet herbs. Let them simmer gently for about 2j hours; then take them out, drain them, and let them cool. Beat an egg upon a plate; dip in each piece of tail, and, afterwards, throw them into a dish of bread crumbs ; broil them over I a clear fire, until of a brownish colour on both sides, and serve with a good gravy, or any sauce that may be preferred. Time.—About 2j hours. Average cost, from 9d. to Is. 6c?., according to the season. Sufficient for 6 persons. Seasonable at any time. JS'ote.—These may be more easily prepared by putting the tails in a brisk oven, after they have been dipped in egg and bread-crumb ; and, when brown, I they are done. They myst be boiled the same time as for broiling.SOI MODERN IIOUSSnOLD COOKERY. Stuange Tails.—TSTaturalists cannot explain the uses of some of the strain go tiiila borne by animals. In the Egyptian and Syrian sheep, for instance, the tail grows so iarf^e, that it is not unfreq.nently supported npon a sort of little cart, in order to prevent inconveniencd to the animal. This mor.stroiis appendage sometimes attains a weight of seventy, eighty, or even a hundred pounds. TO DUE S3 BEEF PALATSS (an Sntree). 653. Ikgeedients.—4 palates, sufficient gravy to cover them (No. 438), ca^^enne to taste, 1 tablespoonful of mushroom ketchup, 1 tabie- spoonful of piclded-onion liquor, thickening of butter and flour. 3Iodc.—Yfash the palates, and put them into a stewpan, Tidth sufficient water to cover them, and let them boil until perfectly tender, or until the upper skin may be easily peeled off. Have ready sufficient gravy (No. 438) to cover them ; add a good seasoning of cayenne, and thicken with roux, Ko. 525, or a little butter kneaded wdth flour; let it boil up, and skim. Cut the palates into square pieces, put them in the gravy, and let them simmer gently for J hour; add ketchup and onion-liquor, give one boil, and serve. Time.—From 3 to 5 hours to boil the palates. Suj/icient for 4 persons. Seasonable at any time. J>^ote.—Palates may be dressed in various ways with sauce tournee, good onion sauce/ tomato sauce, and also served in a vol-au-veut; but the above will be found a more simple method of dressing them. • BEES' PICKLE, wliich may also be used for any kind of Meat, Tongues, or Hams. 654. Iin^geedients.—6 lbs. of salt, 2 lbs. of fine sugar, 3 oz. of powdered saltpetre, 3 gallons of spring Vv ater. JibfZfi.—Boil all the ingredients gently together, so long as any scum or impurity arises, which carefully remove; when quite cold, pour it over the meat, every part of which must be covered with the brine. This may be used for pickling any kind cf meat, and may be kept for some time, if boiled up occasionally with an addition of the ingredients. Time.—A ham should be kept in the pickle for a fortnight; a piece of beef weighing 14 lbs., 12 or 15 days; a tongue, 10 days or a fort- night. JVoie.—For salting and pickling meat, it is a good plan to rub in only half tl\o quantity of salt directed, and to let it remain for a day or two to disgorge and effectually to get rid of the blood and slime ; then rub in the remainder of the salt and other ingredients, and proceed as above. This rule may be ax^plied to all the recipes we have given for salting and pickling meat.S05 BEEF. TO PICKLS PART OF A BOUND 03? BEEF FOB HANGING. 655. Ingredients.—For 14 lbs. of a round of beef allow 1^ lb. of salt, I oz. of powdered saltpetre ; or, 1 lb. of salt, i lb. of sugar, i oz. of powdered saltpetre. 3Iode.—Ji\ih in, and sprinkle either of the above mixtures on 14 lbs. of meat. Keep it in an earthenware pan, or a deep wooden tray, and turn twice a week during 3 weeks; then bind up the beef tightly with coarse linen tape, and hang it in a kitchen in which afire is constantly kept, for 3 weeks. Pork, hams, and bacon may be cured in a similar way, but will require double the quantity of the salting mixture; and, if not smoke-dried, they should be taken down from hanging after 3 or 4 weeks, and afterwards kept in boxes or tubs, amongst dry oat-husks. Time,—2 or 3 weeks to remain in the brine; to be hung 3 weeks. Seasoncihle at any time. Note.—Tho meat may bo boiled fresh from this pickle, instead of smok- ing it. ^ . BEEP BAGOUT (Cold Meat Cookery). 656. Ikgeedients.—About 2 lbs. of cold roast beef, C onions, pepper, salt, and mixed spices to taste; \ pint of boiling water, 3 lablespoonfuls of gravy. J/o<:7<?.—Cut the beef into rather large pieces, and put them into a stewpan with the onions, which must be sliced. Season well with pepper, salt, and mixed spices, and pour over about i pint of boiling water, and gravy in the above proportion (gravy saved from the meat answers the purpose); let the whole stew very gently for about ^ hours, and serve with pickled walnuts, gherkins, or capers, just ^^armed in the gravy. Time.—2 hours. Average cost, exclusive of the meat, 4.d, Seasonahle at any time. BOAST BIBS OF BEEP. 657. Ingredients.—Beef, a little salt. Irlode.—The fore-rib is considered the primest roasting piece, but the middle-rib is considered the most economical. Let the meat be well hung (should the weather permit), and cut off the thin ends of the bones, which should be salted for a few days, and then boiled. Put the meat down to a nice clear fire, put some clean dripping into the pan, dredge the joint with a little flour, and keep continu?.lly X806 MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. basting the wliole time. Sprinkle some line salt over it (this must never be done until the joint is dished, as it draws the juices from the meat); pour the dripping from the pan, put in a little boiling water slightly salted, and strain the gravy over the meat. Garnish with tufts of scraped horseradish, and send horseradish sauce to table with it {see No. 447). A Yorkshire pudding {see Puddings) sometimes accompanies this dish, and, if lightly made and well cooked, will be found a very agreeable addition. Time.—10 lbs. of beef, 21 hours; 14 to 16 lbs,, from Zh to 4 hours. Ave7'age cost^ 8M- per lb. Sufficient.—A joint of 10 Ybs. sufficient for 8 or 9 persons. Seasonable at any time. MEiiOKAjrDA m EoASTiiTG.—The management of the lire is a point of primary importance in roasting. A radiant fire throughout the operation is absolutely necessary to insure a good result. When the article to be dressed is thin and delicate, the fire may be small; but when the joint is large, the fire must fill the grate. Meat must never be put down before a hollow or exhausted fire, which may soon want recruiting : on the other hand, if the heat of the fire becomes too fierce, the meat must be remoTcd to a considerable distance till 'it is somewhat abated. Some cooks always fail in their roasts, though they succeed in nearly everything else. A French writer on the culinary art says that anybody can learn hov.^ to cook, but one must be born a roaster. According to ^liebig, beef or mutton cannot be said to be sufficiently roasted until it has acquired, throughout the whole mass, a temperature of 15S°; but poultry may be well cooked when the inner parts have attained a temperature of from 130'^ to 140°. This depends on the greater amount of blood which beef and mutton contain, the colouring matter of blood not being coagulable under 158°. EOAST BIBS OF BESF, Boned and Boiled (a very Convenient Joint for a Small Family). 658. Ingeedients.—1 or 2 ribs of beef. If ode.—Choose a fine rib of beef, and have it cut according to the ■weight you require, either wide or narrow. Bone and roll the meat round, secure it with wooden skewers, and, if necessary, bind it round with a piece of tape. Spit the beef firmly, or, if a bottle-jack is used, put the joint on the hook, and place it wear a nice clear fire. Let it, remain so till the outside of the meat is set, when draw it to a distance, and keep continually basting until the meat is done, which can be ascertained by the steam from it drawing towards the fire. As this joint is solid, rather more than J hour must be allowed for each lb. Kemove the skewers, put in a plated or silver one, and send the joint to table with gravy in the dish, and garnish with tufts of horseradish. H^)rseradish sauce, ]^o. 447, is a great improvement to roast beef. Tiine.—Fov 10 lbs. of the rolled ribs, 3 hours (as the joint is very solid, we have allowed an extra | hour); for 6 lbs., H hour. Average cosfy 8id. per lb. Sufficient.—A. joint of 10 lbs. for 6 or 8 persons. Seasonalle all the year.BEEF. 807 NoU.—Vfhen tliG wciglit exceeds 10 lbs., we would not advise tlie above mothod of bonrng and rolling; only in the case of 1 or 2 ribs, when the joint cannot stand upright in the dish, and would look awkward. The bones should be put on with a few vegetables and herbs, and made into stock. EoAST Beef has long been a national dish in England. In most of our patriotic songs it is contrasted with the fricasseed frogs, popularly supposed to be the exclusiye diet of rrencLmen. O the roast beef of old England, And O the old English roast beef." This national chorus is appealed to whenever a song-writer wishes to account for the valour displayed by Englishmen at sea or on land. BOAST SmiiOIN OF BSEF. 659. Ingredients.—Beef, a little salt. Mode,—As a joint cannot be well roasted without a good fire, see that it is well made up about f hour before it is required, so that when the joint is put down, it is clear and bright. Choose a nice sir- I loin, the v/eight of which should not exceed 16 lbs,, as the outside would be too much done, whilst the inside would not be done enough. Spit it or hook it on to the jack firmly, dredge it slightly with flour, and place it near the fire at first, as directed in the preceding recipe. Then draw it to a distance, and keep continually basting until the meat is done. Sprinkle a small quantity of salt over it, empty the dripping-pan of all the dripping, pour in some boiling water slightly salted, stir it about, and strain over the meat. Garnish with tufts of horseradish, and send horseradish saaice and Yorkshire pudding to table with it. For carving, see p. 317. Time.—A sirloin of 10 lbs., 2i hours; 14 to 16 lbs., about 4 or 4i hours. Average costy S^d. per lb. Sufficient.—A joint of 10 lbs. for 8 or 9 persons. Seasojiahle at any time. I The rump, round, and other pieces of beef are roasted in the same [manner, allowing for solid joints 5 hour to every lb. I^ote.—The above is the usual method of roasting meat; but to have it in perfection and the juices kept in, the meat should at first be laid close to the fire, and when the outside is set and firm, drawn away to a good distance, and then left to roast very slowly ; where economy is studied, this plan would not answer, as the meat requires to be at the fire double the time of the ordinary way of cooking ; consequently, double the quantity of fuel would be consumed. ^ ORiGiisr OP THE WOEU " SiRLOiiT."—The loin of beef is said to have been knighted by iimg Charles II., at Friday Hall, Chingford. Tlie " Merry Monarch" returned to this liospitable mansion from Epping Forest literally ''as hungry as a hunter," and beheld, n ith delight, a huge loin of beet steaming upon the table. " A noble joint!" exclaimed I x2303 MODERN nOUSElIOLD COOKERY. the king. " By St. George, it shall have a title !" Then drawing: his s-^rord, he raised it above the meat, and cried, with, mock dignity, *'_Loin, we di:b thee knight; henceforward be Sir Loin!" This anecdote is doubtless apocry- phal, although the oak table upon which the joint was supposed to have received its knight- hood, might have been seen by any one who visited Friday-llill House, a few years ago. It is, perhaps, a pity to spoil so noble a story; but the interests of^ truth demand that we declare that sirloin is probably a corruption of siirloin, which signifies the upper part of a loin, the prefix sur being equivalent to over or nhooe.' lu French we find this joint called sur- longc, which so closely resembles our sirloin, that we may safely refer the two words to a cbmmou origin. TO SALT BEEF. 660. Ingredients.—round of beef, 4 oz. of sugar, 1 oz. of powdered saltpetre, 2 oz. of black pepper, J lb. of bay-salt, h lb. of common salt. il/oc/e.—Hub the meat well with salt, and let it remain for a day, to disgorge and clear it from slime. The next day, rub it v^^ell with the above ingredients on every side, and let it remain in the pickle for about a fortnight, turning it every day. It may be boiled fresh from the pickle, or smoked. Time.—I round of beef to remain in pickle about a fortnight. Average costj 7d. per lb. Seasonahle at any time. Note.—The aitch-bone, flank, or brisket may be salted and pickled by any of the recipes we have given for salting beef, allowing less time for small joints to remain in the pickle; for instance, a joint of 8 or 9 lbs. will bo sufficiently salt in about a week. THE DUTCH WAY TO SALT BEEF. 661. IxGEEDiENTS.—10 Ibs. of Icaii bccf, 1 lb. of treacle, 1 oz. of saltpetre, 1 lb. of common salt. 3Iode.—Hub the beef well with the treacle, and let it remain for 3 days, turning and rubbing it often; then wipe it, pound the salt and saltpetre very fine, rub these well in, and turn it every day for 10 days. Roll it up tightly in a coarse cloth, and press it under a large weight; have it smoked, and turn it upside down every day. j3oil it, and, on taking it out of the pot, put a heavy weight on it to press it.

Make a forcemeat by recipe No. 417; spread it over half of the steak; roll it up, bind and skewer it firmly, that the forcemeat may not escape, and roast it before a nice clear fire for about H hour, or rather longer, should the roll be very large and thick. Keep it constantly basted with butter, and serve with brown gravy, some of which must bo poured round the steak, and the remainder sent to table in a tureen. Thne.—U- hour. Average cost^ Is. per lb.

Turn daily in the liquor for a fortnight, soak it for a few hours in water, dry with a cloth, cover with a coarse paste, put a little water at the bottom of the pan, and bake in a moderate oven for 4 hours. If it is not covered with a paste, be careful to put the beef into a deep vessel, and cover with a plate, or it vvill be too crisp. During the time the meat is in the oven it should be turned once or twice. Time.—4 hours. Average cost, 7cl. per lb. Seasonable at any time. Eaking Meat.—Bating exerts some unexplained influence on meat, rendering it less ' savoury and less agreeable than meat which has been roasted. "Those wlio have • travelled in Germany and France,'* writes Mr. Lewis, one of our most popular scientific authors, "must have repeatedly marvelled at the singular uniformity in the flavour, or want of flavour, of the various 'roasts' served up at the table-d'hote." The general explanation is, that the German and French meat is greatly inferior in quality to that of England and Holland, owing to the inferiority of pasturage ; and doubtless this is one cause, but it is not the chief cause. The meat is inferior, but the cooking is mainly at fault. The meat is scarcely ever roasted, because there is no coal, and firewood is expensive. The meat is therefore baked; and the consequence of this baking is, that no meat is eatable or eaten, with its own gravy, but is always accompanied by some sauco more or less piquant. The Germans generally believe that in Jingland we eat our beef and mutton almost raw j they shudder at our gravy, as if it were so much blood. jl STEWED BEEF or KUMP STEAK (an Entree). ' 666.

Ingredients.—7 lbs. of a brisket of beef, vinegar and salt, 6 carrots, 6 turnips, 6 small onions, 1 blade of pounded mace, 2 whole allspice pounded, thickening of butter "and flour, 2 tablespoonfuls of ketchup ; stock, or water. Ilode.—About an hour before dressing it, rub the meat over with vinegar and salt; put it into a stewpan, with sufficient stock to cover it (when this is not at hand, water may be substituted for it), and be particular that the stewpan is not much larger than the meat. Skim well, and when it has simmered very gently for 1 hour, put in the vegetables, and continue simmering till the meat is perfectly tender. Draw out the bones, dish the meat, and garnish either with tufts oi'£12 MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. canliflower or braised cabbage cut in quarters. Thicken as inueh gravy as required, with a little butter and flour; add spices and ]-:etchup in the above proportion, give one boil, pour some of it over the meat, and the remainder send in a tureen. Time.—Rather more than 3 hours. Average cost, 7d. per lb, Sufficiejit for 7 or 8 persons. Seasonable at any time. Note.—The remainder of the liquor in which the beef was boiled may bo served as a soup, or it may be sent to table with the meat in a tureen. STEWED BUMP OS* BEEF. 670. Ikgeedients.—i rump of beef, sufhcient stock to cover it (In 0. 105), 4 tablespoonfuls of vinegar, 2 tablespoonfuls of ketchup, 1 large bunch of savoury herbs, 2 onions, 12 cloves, pepper and salt to taste, thickening of butter and flour, 1 glass of port wine. Mode.—Cut out the bone, sprinkle the meat with a little cayenne (this must be sparingly used), and bind and tie it flrmly up with tape ; put it into a stewpan with sufiicient stock to cover it, and add vinegar, ketchup, herbs, onions, cloves, and seasoning in the above proportion, and simmer very gently for 4 or 5 hours, or until the meat is perfectly tender, which may be ascertained by piercing it with a thin skewer. When done, remove the tape, lay it into a deep dish, which keep hot; strain and skim the gravy, thicken it with butter and flour, add a glass of port v/ine and any flavouring to make the gravy rich and palatable ; let it boil up, pour over the meat, and serve. This dish may be very much enriched by garnishing vrith forcemeat balls, or filling up the space whence the bone is taken with a good forcemeat; sliced carrots, turnips, and onions boiled v/ith the meat, are also a great improvement, and, where expense is not objected to, it may be glazed. This, however, is not necessary where a good gravy is poured round and over the meat. T{7ne.—I rump stewed gently from 4 to 5 hours. Average cost, lOfZ. per lb. Su^.cient for 8 or 10 persons, Seasonable at any time. Note.—K stock or gravy in which to boil the meat, may be made of the bone and trimmings, by boiling them with water, and adding carrots, onions, turnips, and a bunch of sweet herbs. To make this dish richer and mora savoury, half-roast the rump, and afterwards stew it in strong stock and a little Madeira. This is an expensive method, and is not, after all, much better than a plainer-dressed joint. The Baeon- of Beef.—This noble joint, which consisted of two sirloins not cut asunder, was a favourite dish of our ancestors. It is rarely seen nowadays; indeed, it seems ouu of place on a modern table, us it requires the grim boar's Lead and Cnristmaa p^e asBEEF. 313 supporters. Sir Walter Scott has described a feast at which the baron of beef would have appeared to great advantufre.

When a lord's son came of ago, in the olden time, the baron of beef was too small a joint, by many degrees, to satisfy the retainers who would flock to the hall; a whole ox was therefore generally roasted over a fire built up of huge logs. Vie may here mention, that an ox was roasted entire on the frozen Thames, in the early part of the present century. STEWSD SHII^- OF BEEF. 671. Ingeedients.—A shin of beef, 1 head of celery, 1 onion, a fag-g-ot of savoury herbs, 1 teaspoonfiil of allspice, f teaspoonful of whole black pepper, 4 carrots, 12 button onions, 2 turnips, thickening of butter and flour, 3 tablespoonfuls of mushroom ketchup, 2 table- spoonfuls of port wine ; pepper and salt to taste. Mode,—Have the bone sawn into 4 or 5 pieces, cover with hot water, bring it to a boil, and remove any scum that may rise to the surface. Put in the celery, onion, herbs, spice, and seasoning, and simmer very gently until the meat is tender. Peel the vegetables, cut them into any shape fancy may dictate, and boil them with the onions until tender; lift out the beef, put it on a dish, which keep hot, and thicken with butter and flour as much of the liquor as will be wanted for gravy ; keep stirring till it boils, then strain and skim. Put the gravy back in the stewpau, add the seasoning, port wine, and ketchup, give one boil, and pour it over the beef; garnish with the boiled carrots, turnips, and onions. Time.—The meat to be stewed about 4 hours. Average cost, id. per lb. with bone. Sufficient for 7 or 8 persons. Seasonable at any time. TOAD-IK-THE-HOLE (a Homely but Savoury Dish). 672.

For the batter, 3 eggs, 1 pint of milk, 4 table- spoonfuls of fioiir, t saltspoonful of salt. Ifode.—Cut up the steak and kidney into convenient-sized pieces, and put them into a pie-dish, with a good seasoning of salt and pepper; mix the flour with a small quantity of milk at first, to prevent its being lumpy; add the remainder, and the 3 eggs, w^liich should be v\^ell beaten; put in the salt, stir the batter for about 5 minutes, and pour it over the steak.

Note.—The rGmains of cold beef, rather underdone, mc.j be substituted for the steak, and, when hked, the smallest possible quantity of minced onion or slialot may be added. BoiiiSD ToisrauE. 673. Inghedieitts.—1 tongue, a bunch of savoury herbs, water. Mode.—In choosing a tongue, ascertain how long it has been dried or pickled, and select one with a smooth skin, which denotes its being young and tender. If a dried one, and rather hard, soak it at least for 12 hours previous to cooking it; if, however, it is fresh from the pickle, 2 or 3 hours will be sufHcient for it to remain in soak. Put the tongue into a stewpan v/ith plenty of cold water and a bunch of savoury herbs ; let it gradually come to a boil, skim well, and sim- mer very gently until tender. Peel oif the skin, garnish with tufts of cauliflowers or Brussels sprouts, and serve. Boiled tongue is. frequently sent to table with boiled poultry, instead of ham, and is, by many persons, preferred. If to serve cold, peel it, fasten it down,to a pioce of board by sticking a fork through the root, and another through the top, to straighten it. When cold, glaze it, and put a paper ruche round the root, and garnish with tufts of parsley. Ti7ne.—A large smoked tongue, 4 to 4i hours; a small one, 2i to 3 hours.

INGREDIENTS.—9 Ibs. of Salt, 8 oz. of sugar, 9 oz. of powdered saltpetre. Mode.—Eub the above ingredients well into the tongues, and keep them in this curing mixture for 2 months, turning them every day. Drain them from the pickle, cover Vv^ith brown paper, and have them smoked for about 3 weeks. Ti77ie.—The tongues to remain in pickle 2 months; to be smoked 3 v/eeks. Svfficient.—The above quantity of brine sufUcient for 12 tongues, of 5 lbs. each. Seasonable at any time. The Tongues oe Animals.—The tongue, whether in the ox or in man, is the seat of the sense of taste. This sense warns the animal against swallowing deleterious sub- stances. Dr. Carpenter says, that, among the lower animals, the instinctive perceptions con- nected with this sense, are much more remark- able than our own; thus, an omnivorous monkey will seldom touch fruits of a poisonous character, although their taste may be agreeable. How- ever this may be, man's instinct has decided beee tokgue. that ox-tongue is better tha,n horse-tongue; nevertheless, the latter is frequently substituted by dishonest dealers for the former. The horse's tongue may be readily distinguished by a spoon-hke expansion at its end. TO PICKLE .iLHD DRESS A TONGUE TO EAl^ COLD. 676.

BEEF CARVING AITOHBOITS or BEEF. A boiled aitch-bone of beef is not a difficult joint to carve, as will be seen on reference to the accom- panying engraving. By following with the knife the direction of the line from 1 to 2, nice slices will be easily cut. It may be necessary, as in a round of beef, to cut a thick slice off the out- side before commencing to serve.EEEF CArvVixa, S17 BKISKET OF BEEF. There is but little description necessary to add, to show the carving of a boiled brisket of beef, beyond the engraving here inserted. The only point to be observed is, that the joint should be cut evenly and firmly quite across the bones, so that, on its re- appearance at tabic, it should not have a jagged and untidy look. BIBS OF BEEF. This dish resembles the sirloin, except that it has no fillet or under- cut. As explained in the recipes, the end piece is often cut off, salted and boiled. The mode of carving is similar to that of the sirloin, viz., in the direction of the dotted line from 1 to 2. This joint will be the more easily cut if the plan be pursued which is suggested in carving the sirloin; namely, the inserting of the knife immediately between the bone and the meat, before commencing to cut it into slices. All joints of roast beef should be cut in even and thin slices. Horse- radish, finely scraped, may be served as a garnish ; but horseradish sauce is preferable for eating with the beef. SIKIiOm OF BEEF. This dish is served differently at various tables, some preferring it to come to table with the fillet, or, as it is usually called, the undercut, uppermost. The reverse way, as shov/n in the cut, is that most usually adopted. Still the undercut is best eaten when hot; consequently, the carver him- self may raise the joint, and cut some slices from the under side, in the direction of from 1 to 2, as the fillet is very much preferred by some eaters. The upper part of the sirloin should be cut in the direction of the line from 5 to 6, and care should be taken to carve it evenly and in thin slices. It will be found a great assistance, in carving this joint well, if the knife be first inserted just above the bone at the bottom, and run sharply along between the bone and meat, and also to divide the meat from the bone in the same way at the side of the joint. The slices will then come avfay more readily.MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. 318 Some carvers cut the upper side of the sirloin across, as shown by the line from 3 to 4 ; but this is a wasteful plan, and one not to be recom- mended. With the sirloin, very finely-scraped horseradish is usually served, and a little given, when liked, to each guest. Horseradish sauce is preferable, however, for serving on the plate, although the scraped horseradish may still be used as a garnish. A BOUND OF BES3?. A round of beef is not so easily carved as many other joints of beef, and to manage it properly, a thin-bladed and very sharp knife is necessary. Off the outside of the joint, at its top, a thick slice should first be cut, so as to leave the surface smooth; then thin and even slices should be cleverly carved in the direction of the lino 1 to 2; and with each slice of the lean a delicate morsel of the fat should be served. BEEF TOSTGUE. Passing the knife down in the direction of from 1 to 2, a not too thin slice should be helped; and the carving of a tongue may be continued in this way until the best portions of the upper side are served. The fat which lies about the root of the tongue can be served by turning the tongue, and cutting in the direction of from 3 to 4.CHAPTER XIY. GEK'SBAL OBSSKVATIONS OI-T THE SHESP AND LAMB. 678. Of all Wild or Domesticated Animals, the sheep is, without excep- tion, the most useful to man as a food, and the most necessary to his health and comfort; for it not only supplies him with the lightest and most nutri- ♦tious ot meats, but, in the absence of the cow, its udder yields him milk, cream, and a sound though inferior cheese; while from its* fat he obtains light, and from its fleece broadcloth, kerseymere, blankets, gloves, and hose. Its bones when burnt make an animal charcoal—ivory black—to polish his boots, and when powdered, a manure for the cultivation of his wheat; the skin, either split or whole, is made into a mat for his carriage, a housing for his horse, or a lining for his hat, and many other useful purposes besides, being extensively employed in the manufacture of jparchment; and finally, when oppressed by care and sorrow, the harmonious strains that carry such soothing contentment to the heart, are elicited from the musical strings, pre- pared almost exclusively from the intestines of the sheep. 679. This Valuable Animal, of which England is estimated to maintain an average stock of 32,000,000, belongs to the class already indicated under the ox,—the Mammalia ; to the order of Rumenantia, or cud-chewing animal; to the tribe of Ca]pridce, or horned quadrujpeds; and the genus Ovis, or theMODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. 320 sheep." The sheep may be either with or without horns ; when present, however, they have always this peculiarity, that they spring from a triangular base, are spiral in form, and lateral, at the side of the head, in situation. Tiia fleece of the sheep is of two sorts, either short and harsh, or soft and woolly ; the wool always preponderating in an exact ratio to the care, attention, and amount of domestication bestowed on the animal. The generic peculiarities of the sheep are the triangular and spiral form of the horns, always larger in the male when j^rescnt, but absent in the most cultivated species ; having sinuses at the base of all the toes of the four feet, with two rudimentar}'' hoofs on the fore legs, two inguinal teats to the udder, with a short tail in the wild breed, but of varying length in the domesticated ; have no incisor teeth in the upper jaw, but in their place a hard elastic cushion along the margin of the gum, on which the animal nips and breaks the herbage on which it feeds ; in the lower jaw tliere are eight incisor teeth and six molars on each side of both jaws, making in all 82 teeth. The fleece consists of tv;o coats, one to keep the animal warm, the other to carry off the water without wetting the skin. The first is of wool, the weight and fineness of which depend on the quality of the pastm-e and the care bestowed on the flock ; the other of hair, that pierces the wool and overlaps it, and is in excess in exact proportion to the badness of the keep and inattention with which the animal is treated. 680. The great Object op th3 Grazier is to procure an animal that will yield the greatest pecuniary return in the shortest time ; or, in other words, soonest convert grass and tm'nips into good mutton and fine fleece. All sheep will not do this alike ; some, like men, are so restless and irritable, that no system of feeding, however good, will develop their frames or make them fat. The system adopted by the breeder to obtain a valuable animal for the butcher, is to enlarge the capacity and functions of the digestive organs, and reduce those of the head and chest, or the mental and respiratory organs. In the first place, the mind should be tranquillized, and those spaces that can never produce animal fibre curtailed, and greater room afforded, as in the abdomen, for those that can. And as nothing militates against the fattening process so much as restlessness, the chief wish of the grazier is to find a dull, indolent sheep, one who, instead of frisking himself, lea2:>ing his wattles, or even condescending to notice the butting gambols of his silly companions, silently fills his paunch with pasture, and then seeking a shady nook, indolently and luxuriously chews his cud with closed eyes and blissful satisfaction, only rising vv^hen his delicious repast is ended, to proceed silently and without emotion to repeat the pleasing process of laying in more provender, and then returning to his dreamy siesta to renew the delightful task of rumination. Such animals are said to have a li/mphcdic temperament, and are of so kindly a nature, that on good pasturage they may be said to grow daily. The Leicestershire breed is tlie best example of this lymphatic and contented animal, and the active Orkney, who is half goat in his habits, of the restless aiid unprofitable. The rich pasture of our midland counties321 THE SHEEP. would take years in makiiig the why Orkney fat and profitable, while ono day's fatigue in climbing roc]^:s after a coarse and scanty herbage v/ould pro- bably cause the actual death of the pampered and short-winded Leicester. 68i. The moiie removed from the Nature of the animal is the food on which it lives, the more difficult is the process of assimilation, and the more complex the chain of digestive organs; for it must bo evident to all, that the same apparatus that converts/es/i mio jlcsh, is hardly calculated to transmute grass into flesh. As the process of digestion in carnivorous animals is ex- tremely simple, these organs are found to be remarkably short, seldom ex- ceeding the length of the animal's body ; while, whore digestion is more difficult, from the unassimilatiug nature of the aliment, as in the ruminant order, the alimentary canal, as is the case with the sheep, is twenUj-seveii times the length of the Jjody. The digestive organ in all ruminant animals consists of jour stomachs, or, rather, a capacious pouch, divided by doorways and valves into four compartments, called, in their order of position, the Paunch, the Reticulum, the Omasum, and the xibomasum. When the sheep nibbles the grass, and is ignorantly supposed to be eatlDg, he is, in fact, only preparing the raw material of his meal, in reality only mowing the pasture, which, as he collects, is swallowed instantly, passing into the first receptacle, the paicnch, where it is surrounded by a quantity of warm saliva, in which the herbage undergoes a process of maceration or softening, till the animal having filled this compartment, the contents pass through a valve into, the seconder smaller bag,—the rcticidum,v:heYG, having again filled the paunch with a reserve, the sheep lies down and commences that singular j^rocess .of chewing the cud, or, in ether v/ords, masticating the food he has collected.. By the operation of a certain set of muscles, a small quantity of this softened food from the reticidur.i, or second bag, is passed into the mouth, which it now becomes the pleasure of the sheep to grind under his molar teeth into a soft smooth pulp, the operation being further assisted by a flow of saliva, answering the double purpose of increasing the flavour of the aliment and promoting the solvency of the mass. Having completely comminuted and blended this mouthful, it is swallowed a second time ; but instead of returning to the paunch or reticulum, it passes through another valve into a side cavity,—the omas^im, where, after a maceration in more saliva for some hours, it glides by the same contrivance into the fourth pouch,—the ahomasum, an apartment in all respects analogous to the ordinary stomach of animals, and where the process of digestion, begun and carried on in the j^revious three, is here con- summated, and the nutrient principle, by means of the bile, eliminated from the digestied aliment. Such is the process of digestion in sheep and oxen. 682. No other Animal, even of the same order, possesses in so remarkable a degree the power of converting pasture into flesh as the Leicestershire sheep; the South Down and Cheviot, the two next breeds in quality, are, in consequence of the greater vivacity of the animal's nature, not equal to it in that respect, though in both the brain and chest are kept subservient to the Y822 MODEEN HOUSEHOLD COOKER i. greater capacity of the organs of digestion. Besides the advantage of increased bulk and finer fleeces^, the breeder seeks to obtain an augmented deposit of tissue in those parts of the carcase most esteemed as food, or, what are called in the trade "prime joints and so far has this been effected, that the com- j)arative weight of the hind quarters over the fore has become a test of quality in the breed, the butchers in some markets charging twopence a pound more for that portion of the sheep. Indeed, so superior are the hind quarters of mutton now regarded, that very many of the Yv^est-end butchers never deal in any other part of the sheep. 683. The Difeeuence in the Quality of the Flesh in various breeds is a well-established fact, not alone in flavour, but also in tenderness ; and that the nature of the pasture on which the sheep is fed influences the flavour of the meat, is equally certain, and shown in the estimation in which those flocks are held which have grazed on the thymy heath of Bamstead in Sussex. It is also a well-established truth, that the larger the frame of the animal, the coarser is the meat, and that small hones are both guarantees for the fineness of the breed and the delicacy of the flesh. The sex too has much to do in determining the quality of the meat; in the males, the lean is closer in fibre, deeper in colour, harder in texture, less juicy, and freer from fat, than in the female, and is consequ-ently tougher and more diflicult of digestion ; but probably age, and the character of the pasturage on which they are reared, has^ more than any other cause, an influence on the quality and tenderness of the meat. 684. The numerous Varieties of sheep inhabiting the different regions of the earth have been reduced by Cavier to three, or at most four, species : the Ovis Ammon, or the Argali, the presumed parent stock of all the rest; the Ovis TragelapJms, the bearded sheep of Africa; the Ovis Altismon, the Mus- mon of Southern Europe; and the Ovis montana, the Mouflon of America; though it is believed by many naturalists that this last is so nearly identical with the Indian Argali as to be undeserving a separate place. It is still a controversy to which of tliesG three we are indebted for the many breeds of modern domestication; the Argali, hov»^ever, by general belief, has been con- sidered as the most 2^rohahle progenitor of the present varieties. 685. The Effects produced by Change of Climate, accident, and other causes, must have been great to accomplish so complete a physical alteration as the primitive Argali must have undergone before the Musmon, or Mouflon of Corsica, the immediate progenitor of all our European breeds, assumed his present appearance. The Argali is about a fifth larger in size than the ordi- nary English sheep, and being a native of a tropicial clime, his fleece is of hair instead of wool, and of a warm reddish brown, approaching to yellow; a thick mane of darker hair, about seven inches long, commences from two long tufts at the angle of the jaws, a,nd, rmimxig under the throat and neck, descends down the chest, dividing, at the fore fork, into two parts, one running323 THE siJEr^r. down the front of each log, as low as tlie sJiank. Tho norns, unlike the character of the order generally, have a quadrangular base, and, sweeping inwards, terminate in a sharp point. The tail, about seven inches long, ends in a tuft of stiff hairs. From this remarkable muffler-looking beai*d, the French have given the species the name of Moufion cl manchcites. From the primitive stock eleven varieties have been reared in this country, of the domesticated sheep, each supposed by their advocates to possess some one or more special qualities. These eleven, embracing the Shetland or Orkney ; the Dun-woolled ; Black-faced, cr heath-bred ; the Moorland, of Devonshire; the Cheviot; the Horned, of Norft)lk ; the Ryeland; South-Down; the Merino; the Old Leicester, and the Teeswater, or New Leicester, have of late years been epitomized ; and, or all useful and practical purposes, reduced to the following four orders :— 686. The South-Down, the Leicester, the Black-faced, and tho Cheviot. 687. South-Downs.—It appears, as far as our investigation can trac^the fact, that from the very earliest epoch of agricultural history in England, the breezy range of light chalky hills running through the south-west and SOVTJI-DOVfl\ EAM. south of Sussex and Hampshire, and known as the South-Downs, has been famous for a superior race of sheep ; and we find the Romans early estab- lished mills and a cloth-factory at Winchester, where they may be said to terminate, which rose to such estimation, from the fineness of the wool and texture of the cloth, that the produce was kept as only worthy to clothe emperors. From this, it may be inferred that sheep have alv/ays been indi- genous to this hilly tract. Though boasting so remote a reputation, it is comparatively v/ithin late years that the improvement and present state of perfection of this breed has been effected, the South-Down now ranking, for symmetry of shape, constitution, and early maturity, v/ith any stock in the kingdom. The South-Down has no horns, is covered with a fine wool from y2S2'l MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. two to three inches long, has a small head, and legs and face of a grey colour. It isj however; considered deficient in depth and breadth of chest. A marked souin-Dowir ewe. peculiarity of this breed is that its hind quarters stand higher than the foro^ the quarters weighing from fifteen to eighteen pounds. 688. The Leicester.—It was not till the year 1755 that Mr. Robert Bakewell directed his attention to the improvement of his stock of sheeiD, and ultimately effected that change in the character of his flock which has brought the breed to hold so prominent a place. The Leicester is regarded as the largest example of the improved breeds, very productive, and yielding a good fleece. He has a small head, covered with short Vvhite hairs, a clean muzzle, an open countenance, full eye, long thin ear, tapering neck, well-arched ribs, and straight back. The meat is indifferent, its flavour not being so good as that of the South-Down, and there is a very large proportion of fi\t. Average weight of carcase from 90 to 100 lbs.THE SHEEP. 325 6S9.

Though the Romney Marshes, that wide tract of morass and low- laiid moor extending from the Weald (or ancient forest) of Kent into Sussex, has rather been regarded as a general feeding-ground for any kind of sheep to be pastured on, it has yet, from the earliest date, been famous for a breed of animals almost peculiar to the locality, and especially for si^e, length, thickness, and quantity of wool, and what is called thickness of stocking ; and on this account for ages held pre-eminence over every other breed in the kingdom. So satisfied were the Kentish men with the superiority of theirS27 THE SHEEP. sheep, that they long resisted any crossing in the breed. At length, however, this was effected, and from the Old Romney and Now Leicester a stock was produced that proved, in an eminent degree, the advantage of the cross ; and though the breed was actually smaller than the original, it was found that the new stock did not consume so much food, the stociving was increased, they were ready for the market a year sooner ; that the fat formed more on the exterior of the carcase, where it was of most advantage to the grazier, .rather than as formerly in the interior, v/here it v/ent to the butcher as offal; and though the wool v/as shorter and lighter, it was of a better colour, finer, and possessed of superior felting properties. 692. The Romney Marsh Breed is a large animal, deep, close, and com- pact, with white face and legs, and yields a heavy fleece of a good staple quality. The general structure is, however, considered defective, the chest being narrow and the extremities coarse ; nevertheless its tendency to fatten, and its early maturit}'", are universally admitted. The Romney Marsh, there- fore, though not ranking as a first class in respect of perfection and symmetry of breed, is a highly useful, profitable, and generally advantageous variety of the English domestic sheep. 693. Different Names have been given to sheep by their breeders, according to their age and sex. The male is called a ram, or tup ; after weaning, he is said to be a hog, or hogget, or a lamb-hog, tup-hog, or teg ; later he is a wether, or wether-hog ; after the first shearing, a shearing, or dinmont; and after each succeeding shearing, a two, three, or four-shear " ram, tup, or wether, according to circumstances. The female is called a ewe, or gimmer-lamb, till weaned, when she becomes, according to the shepherd's nomenclature, a gimmer-ewe, hog, or teg ; after shearing, a gimmer or shear- ing-ewe, or theave ; and in future a two, three, or four-shear ewe, or theave.MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOICERY. 694. The Mode of Slaughterixg Sheep is perhaps as liu.mane and expe- ditious a process as could be adopted to attain the objects sought : the animal being laid on its side in a sort of concave stool, the butcher, while pressing the body with his knee, transfixes the throat near the angle of the jaw, passing: his knife between the windpipe and bones of the neck ; thus dividing the jugulars, carotids, and large vessels, the death being very rapid from such a hemorrhage. 695. Almost every Large City has a particular manner of cutting up, or^ as it is called, dressing the carcase. In London this process is very simple, and as our butchers have found that much skewering back, doubling one part over another, or scoring the inner cuticle or fell, tends to spoil the meat and shorten the time it would otherwise keep, they avoid all such treatment entirel}^ The carcase when flayed (v/hich operation is performed while yet vrarm), the sheep when hung up and the head removed, presents the profile shown in our cut; the small numerals indicating the parts or joints into which one half of the animal is cut. After separating the hind from the fore quarters, with eleven ribs to the latter, the quarters are usually subdivided in the nianner shown in the sketch, in which the several joins are defined by the intervening lines and figures. Iliiid quarter : No. 1, the leg; 2, the loin—the two, when cut in one piece, being called the saddle. I^ore quarter: No. 3, the shoulder ; 4 and 5 the neck ; No. 5 being called, for distinction, the scrag, which is generally afterwards separated from 4, the lov/er and better joint ; No. Q, the breast. The haunch of mutton, so often served at public dinners and special entertainments, comprises all the leg and so much of the loin, short of the ribs or lap, as is indicated on the upper part of the carcase by a dotted line. 696. The Gentle and Timid Disposition of the sheep, and its defenceless condition, must very early have attached it to man for motives less selfish than either its fleece or its flesh; for it has been proved beyond a doubt that, obtuse as we generally regard it, it is susceptible of a high degree of domesticity, obedience, and affec- tion. In many parts of Europe, where the flocks are guided by the shepherd's voice alone, it is no unusual thing for a sheep to quit the herd when called by its name, and follov/ the keeper like a dog. In the mountains of Scotland, when a flock is invaded by a savage dog, the rams have been knovvmto form the herd into a circle, and placing themselves on the SIDE 017 MUTTOIir, SIr0^yIXG THE SEVERAL JOIKIS.THE LAMB. 329 outside line^ keep the enemy at bay, or chargirig on bim in a troop, have despatched him v/ith their horns. 697. The Value of the Skeep seems to have been early understood by Adam in his fallen state ; his skin not only affording him protection for his body, but a covering for his tent; and accordingly, we find Abel intrusted with this por- tion of his father's stock ; for the Bible tells us that Abel was a keeper of ' sheep." What other animals were domesticated at that time we can only conjecture, or at what exact period the flesh of the sheep was first eaten for food by man, is equally, if not uncertain, open to controversy. For thougii some authorities maintain the contrary, it is but natural to suppose that when Abel brought firstlings of his flock, ''and the fat thereof," as a sacrifice, the less dainty portions, not being oblations, were hardly likely to have been flung away as refuse. Indeed, without supposing Adam and his descendants to have eaten animal food, we cannot reconcile the fact of Jubal Cain, Cain's son, and his family, living in tents, as they are reported to have done, know- ing that both their own garments and the coverings of the tents, were made from the hides and skins of the animals they bred ; for the number of sheep and oxen slain for oblations only, would not have supplied sufficient material for two such necessary purposes. The opposite opinion is, that animal food was not eaten till after the Flood, when the Lord renewed his covenant with IsToah. From Scriptural authority we learn many interesting facts as regards the sheep : the first, that mutton fat was considered the most delicious portion of any meat, and the tail and adjacent part the most exquisite morsel in the v/hole body ; consequently, such were regarded as especially fit for the offer of sacrifice. From this fact we may reasonably infer that the animal still so often met with in Palestine and Syria, and known as the Fat-tailed sheep, was in use in the days of the patriarchs, though probably not then of the size and weight it now attains to ; a supposition that gains greater strength, when it is remembered that the ram Abraham found in the bush, when he w^ent to offer up Isaac, was a horned animal, being entangled in the brake by his curved horns; so far proving that it belonged to the tribe of the Capridcc, the fat- tailed sheep appertaining to the same family. LAMB S. 698. Though the Lambing Season in this Country usually commences in March, under the artificial system, so much pursued now to please the appe- tite of luxury, lambs can be j^rocured at all seasons. When, however, the sheep lambs in mid-winter, or the inclemency of the weather would endanger tlie hves of mother and young, if exposed to its influence, it is customary to rear the lambs within-doors, and under the shelter of stables or barns, where, foddered on soft hay, and part fed on cow's milk, the little creatures thrive rapidly: to such it is customary to give the name of House Lamb, to distin- guish it from that reared in the open air, or grass-fed. The ewe goes fiveMODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. S30 2. Breast; 3. Shoulder; 4. Loin; 5. Leg; 1,2,3. Fore Quarter. months witii her young, about 152 days, or close on 22 weeks. The weanmg season commences on poor lands, about the end of the thu-d month^ but on rich pasture not till the close of the fourth—sometimes longer. 699. From the large Proportion of Moisture or Fluids contained in the tissues of all young animals, the flesh of lamb and veal is much more prone, in close, damp weather, to become tainted and spoil than the flesh of the more mature, drier, and closer-textured beef and mutton. Among epicures, -the most delicious sorts of lamb are those of the South-Down breed, known by their black feet; and of these, those v/hich have been exclusively suckled on the milk of the parent ewe, are considered the finest. Next to these in estimation are those fed on the milk of • several dams, and last of all, though the fattest, the grass-fed lamb ; this, how- m ever, implies an age much greater than either of the others. 700. Lamb, in the early part of the season, how- ever reared, is in London, and indeed generally, sold in quarters, divided with eleven ribs to the fore- quarter ; but, as the season advances, these are sub- divided into two, and the hind-quarter in the same manner ; the first consisting of the shoulder, and the neck an.d breast; the latter, of the leg and the loin,—as shown in the cut illustrative of mutton. As lamb, from the juicy nature of its flesh, is espe- cially liable to spoil in unfavourable weather, it should be frequently wiped, so as to remove any moistui-» that may form on it. 701. In the Purchasing of Lamb for the Table, there are certain signs by which the expe- rienced judgment is able to form an accurate opinion whether the animal has been lately slaughtered, and whether the joints possess that condition of fibre indicative of good and wholesome meat. The first of these doubts may be solved satisfactorily by the bright and dilated appearance of the eye; the quality of the fore- quarter can always be guaranteed by the blue or healthy ruddiness of the jugular, or vein of the neck ; while the rigidity of the knuckle, and the firm, compact feel of the kidney, will answer in an equally positive manner for the integrity of the hind-quarter. 702.

The Good Shepherd.—The sheep's complete dependence upon the shepherd for protection from its numerous enemies is frequently referred to in the Bible; tlius tlie Psalmist likens himself to a lost sheep, and prays the Almighty to seek his servant; and our Saviour, when despatching his twelve chosen disciples to preach the Gospel amongst their unbelieving brethren, com];)ares them to lambs going ampngst wolves. The shepherd of the East, by kind treatment, calls forth from his sheep unmistakable signs of affection. The sheei5 obey his voice and recognize the names by which he calls them, and they follow him in and out of the fold. The beautiful figure of the " good shepherd," which so often occurs in the New Testament, expresses the tenderness of the Saviour for mankind. " The good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep."—John, x. 11. "I am the good sheplierd, and know my sheep, and am known by mine."—John, x. 11. " And other sheep I have which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice : and there shall be one fold and one shepherd."—John, x. 16.

Various Qualities op Mutton.—Mutton is, unlouutedjj, the meat most generally used in families ; and, both b}^ connoisseurs and medical men, it stands first in favour, whether its fine flavour, digestible qualifications, or general wliolesomeness, be considered. Of all mutton, that furnished by the South-Down sheep is the most highly esteemed; it is also the dearest, on account of its scarcity, and the great demand for it. Therefore, if the housekeeper is told by the butcher that Ive has not any in his shop, it should not occasion disappointment to the purchaser. The London and other markets are chiefly' supplied with sheep called half-breeds, which are a cross between the Down and Lincoln or Leicester. These half-breeds make a greater weight of mutton than the true South- Downs, and, for this very desirable qualillcation, they are preferred by the great sheep- masters. The legs of this mutton range from 7 to 11 lbs. in weight; the shoulders,, necks, or loins, about 6 to 9 lbs.; and if care is taken not to purchase it too fat, it will be found the most satisfactory and economical mutton that can be bought. BRAISED LEG OF MUTTON. 708.

The Order op the GtOLDEN Fleece.—This order of knighthood was founded by Phihp the Good, duke of Burgundy, in 1429, on the day of his marriage Avith the Princess Isabella of Portugal. The number of the members was originally fixed at thirty-one, mcludmg the sovereign, as the head and chief of the institution. In 1516, Pope Leo X. consented to mcrease the number to fifty-two, including the head, In 1700 the ermanMODERN HOUSEHOLD -COOKERY, emperor Charles VI. and King Philip of Spain both laid claim to the order. The former, however, on leaving Spain, which he could not maintain by force of arms, took with him, to Vienna, tb.3 archives of the order, the inauguration of which he solemnized there in 1713, with great magnificence; but Philip V. of Spain declared himself G-rand Master, and formally protested, at the congress of Cambrai (1721),against the pretensions of the emperor. The dispute, though subsequently settled by the intercession of France, England, and Holland, vf-ds frequently renewed, until the order was tacitly introduced into both countries, and it now passes by the respective names of the Spanish or Austrian " Order of the Golden Fleece," according to the country where it is issued.

Mode,—Cut the mutton into pieces about 2 inches square, and let it be tolerably lean ; put it into a stewpan, with a little fat or butter, and fry it of a nice brown; then dredge in a little flour, slice the onions, and put it with the herbs in the stewpan ; pour in sufficient watery^^6^ to coyer the meat, and simmer the whole gently until the mutton is tender. Take out the meat, strain, and skim off all the fat from the gf^vy, and put both the meat and gravy back into the stewpan ; add about a quart of young green peas, and let them boil gently until done. 2 or 3 slices of bacon added and stewed with the mutton give additional flavour ; and, to insure the peas being a beau- tiful green colour, they may be boiled in water separately, and added to the stew at the moment of serving. 2j hours.

Names of Animals Saxon, and their Flesh Fouman.—The names of all our domestic animals are of Saxon origin ; but it is curious to observe that Norman names have been given to the different sorts of flesh which these animals yield. How beauti- fully this illustrates the relative position of Saxon and 'Norman after the Conquest. The Saxon hind had the charge of tending and feeding the domestic animals, but only that they might appear on the table of his Norman lord. Thus ' ox,' ' steer/ * cow,' are Saxon, but 'beef is Norman; 'calf is Saxon, but 'veal' Norman; 'sheep' is Saxon, but 'mutton* Norman; so it is severally with 'deer' and 'venison,* 'swine' and 'pork,' 'fowl' and 'pullet.' 'Bacon/ the only flesh which, perhaps, €ver came within his reach, is the single exception. BEOILiOD MUTTOjKT A^T> TOMATO SAUCE (Cold Meat Cookery). 710.

SsEPHEups AKD THEiB Flocks.—The shepherd's crook is older than either the husbandman's plough or the warrior's sword. We are told that Abel was a keeper of sheep. Many passages in holy writ enable us to appreciate the pastoral riclics of the first eastern nations ; and we can form an idea of the number of their flocks, when we read that Jacob gave the children of Hamor a hxmdred sheep for the price of a field, and that the king of Israel received a hundred thousand every year from the king of Moab, his tributary, and a like number of rams covered with their fleece. The tendency which most sheep have to ramble, renders it necessary for them to be attended by a shepherd. To keep a flock within bounds is no easy task; but the watchful shepherd manages to accomplish it without harassing the sheep. In the Highlands of Scotland, where the herbage is scanty, the sheep-farm requires to be very large, and to bo watched over by many shepherds. The farms of some of the great Scottish landowners are of enormous extent. "How many sheei3 have you on your estate ?" asked Prince Esterhazy of the duke of Argyll. "I have not the most remote idea/' replied the duke; " but I know the shepherds number several thousands." BBOIIiED MUTTOK CHOPS. 711.

The Goldek Fleece.—The ancient fable of the Golden Fleece may be thus briefly told :—Phryxus, a son of Athamus, Idng of Thebes, to escape the persecutions of his stepmother Ino, paid a visit to his friend ^etes, king of Colchis. A ram, whose fleece was of pure gold, carried the youth through the air in a most obliging manner to theMUTTON. court of his friend. When safa at Colchis, Phryxus ofTered the ram on the altars of Mars, and pocketed the fleece. The Idng received him with great kindness, and gave him his daughter Chalciope in marriage; but, some time after, he murdered him iu order to obtain possession of the precious fleece. The murder of Phrjxus was amply revenged by the Greeks. It gave rise to the famous Argonautic expedition, under- taken by Jason and fifty of the most celebrated heroes of Greece. The Argonauts recovered the fleece by the help of the celebrated sorceress Medea, daughter of iEetes, who fell desperately in love with the gallant but faithless Jason. In the story of the voyage of the Argo, a substratum of truth probably exists, though overlaid by a mass of fiction. The ram which carried Phryxus to Colchis is by some supposed to have been the name of the ship in which he embarked. The fleece of gold is thought to represent the immense treasures he bore away from Thebes. The alchemists of the fifteenth century were firmly convinced that the Golden Meece was a treatise oa the transmuta- tion of metals, written on sheepskin. HABICOT MUTTOIS". I. 716. Ingeedients.—4 lbs. of the middle or best end of tbe neck of mutton, 3 carrots, 3 turnips, 3 onions, pepper and salt to taste, 1 table- spoonful of ketchup or Harvey's sauce. Mode,—Trim off some of the fat, cut the mutton into rather thin chops, and put them into a frying-pan with the fat trimmings. Fry of a pale brown, but do not cook them enough for eating. Cut the carrots and turnips into dice, and the onions into slices, and slightly fry them in the same fat that the mutton was browned in, but do not allow them to take any colour. E"ow lay the mutton at the bottom of a stewpan, then the vegetables, and pour over them just sufficient boiling water to cover the whole. Give one boil, skim well, and then set the pan on the side of the fire to simmer gently until the meat is tender. Skim off every particle of fat, add a seasoning of pepper and salt, and a little ketchup, and serve. This dish is very much better if made the day before it is wanted for table, as the fat can be so much more easily removed when the gravy is cold. This should be particularly attended to, as it is apt to be rather rich and greasy if eaten the same day it is made. It should be served in rather a deep dish. Time,—2^ hours to simmer gently.

Flavour with ketchup, Harvey's sauce, tomato sauce, or any flavouring that may be preferred, and let the meat gradually warm through, but not boil, or it will harden. To hash meat properly, it should be laid in cold gravy, ^nd only left on the fire just long enough to warm through. Time.—l^ hour to simmer the gravy. Average cost, exclusive of the meat, id, Seasonable at any time.MUTTON. ZZd Hashed Mttttoit.—Many persons express a decided aversion to hashed mutton; and, doubtless, this dislike has arisen from the fact that they have unfortunately never been properly served with this dish. If properly done, however, the meat tender (it ought to be as tender as when first roasted), the gravy abundant and well flavoured, and the sippets nicely toasted, and the whole served neatly; then, hashed mutton is by no means to be despised, and is infinitely more wholesome and appetizing than the cold leg or shoulder, of which fathers and husbands, and their bachelor friends, stand in such natural awe. HODGE-PODGE (Cold Meat Cookery). 720. Ingeedients.—About 1 lb. of underdone cold mutton, 2 let- tuces, 1 pint of green peas, 5 or 6 green onions, 2 oz. of butter, pepper and salt to taste, I teacupful of water.

Mode—llxim off some of the fat of the above quantity of loin or neck of mutton, and cut it into chops of a moderate thickness. Pare and halve the potatoes, and cut the onions into thick slices. Put a layer of potatoes at the bottom of a stewpan, then a layer of mutton and onions, and season with pepper and salt; proceed in this manner until the stewpan is full, taking care to have plenty of vegetables at the top. Pour in the water, and let it stew very gently for 2^ hours, keeping the lid of the stewpan closely shut the ivliole time, and occasionally shaking it to prevent its burning. Time.—21 hours.

Put all the ingredients into the stewpan in layers, first a layer of vegetables, then one of meat, and sprinkle seasoning of pepper and salt between each layer; cover closely, and let the whole stew very gently for 1 hour or rather more, shaking it frequently to prevent its burning. Time.—Rather more than 2 hours. Average cost. Is. 6d. Sufficient for 5 or 6 persons. Seasonable.—Suitable for a winter dish. Note.—Irish stew may be prepared in the same mamier as above, but baked in a jar instead of boiled. About 2 hours or rather more in a moderate oven will be sufficient time to bake it, ITALIATsT MUTT015" CUTLETS. 723. Ikgredieots.—About 3 lbs. of the neck of mutton, clarified butter, the yolk of 1 egg, 4 tablespoonfuls of bread crumbs, 1 table- spoonful of minced savoury herbs, 1 tablespoonful of minced parsley, 1 teaspoonful of minced shalot, 1 saltspoonful of finely-chopped lemon- peel ; pepper, salt, and pounded mace to taste; flour, i pint of hot broth or water, 2 teaspoonfuls of Harvey's sauce, 1 teaspoonful of soy, 2 teaspoonfuls of tarragon vinegar, 1 tablespoonful of port wine. IIode.—Qvit the mutton into nicely-shaped cutlets, flatten them, and trim off some of the fat, dip them in clarified butter, and then into the beaten yolk of an egg. Mix well together bread crumbs, herbs, parsley, shalot, lemon-peel, and seasoning in the above propor- tion, and cover the cutlets with these ingredients. Melt some butter in a frying-pan, lay in the cutlets, and fry them a nice brown; take them out, and keep them hot before the fire. Dredge some flour into the pan, and if there is not sufficient butter, add a little more; stir till it looks brown, then pour in the hot broth or water, and the remaining ingredients; give one boil, and pour round the cutlets. If the gravy should not be thick enough, add a little more flour. Mushrooms, when obtainable, are a great improvement to this dish, and when not i in season, mushroom-powder may be substituted for them. Time.—lQ minutes;—rather longer, should the cutlets be very thick. Average cost, 2s. 9d. Sufficient for 5 or 6 persons. Seasonahle at any time. The Downs.—The well-known substance clialb, which the chemist regards as a nearly pure carbonate of lime, and the microscopist as an aggregation of inconceivably minute . shells and corals, forms the sub-soil of the hilly districts of the south-east of England. The chalk-hills known as the South Downs start from the bold promontory of BeacUy Head, { traverse the county of Sussex from east to west, and pass through Hampshire into Surrey, i The North Downs extend from Godalmiug, by Grodstone, into Kent, and terminate in the | line of cliffs which stretches from Dover to Eamsgate. The Downs are clothed with short ;S41 MUTTO^r. verdant turf; but tlie layer of soil wMeh rests upon the chalk ia too thin to support trees and shrubs. The hills have rounded summits, and their smooth, undulated outlines are unbroken save by the sepulchral monuments of the early inhabitants of the country. The coombes and furrows, which ramify and extend into deep valleys, appear like dried-up channels of streams and rivulets. From time immemorial, immense flocks of sheep have been reared on these downs. The herbage of these hills is remarkably nutritious; and whilst the natural healthiness of the climate, consequent on the dryness of the air and the moderate elevation of the land, is eminently favourable to rearing a superior race of sheep, the arable land in the immediate neighbourhood of the Downs affords the means of a supply of other food, when the natural produce of the hills fails. The mutton of the South-Down breed of sheep is highly valued for its delicate flavour, and the wool for its fineness; bvit the best specimens of this breed, when imported from England into the West Indies, become miserably lean in the course of a year or two, and their woolly ileece gives place to a covering of short, crisp, brownish hair. BROILED KIDlsTBYS (a Breakfast or Supper Dish). 724. Ingkedients.—Sheep kidneys, pepper and salt to taste. Mode.—Ascertain that the kidneys are fresh, and cut them open very evenly, lengthwise, down to the root, for should one half be thicker than the other, one would be underdone whilst the other would be dried, but do not separate them; skin them, and pass a skewer under the white part of each half to keep them flat, and broil over a nice clear fire, placing the inside downwards; turn them when done enough on one side, and cook them on the other. Eemove the skewers, place the kidneys on a very hot dish, season with pepper and salt, and put a tiny piece of butter in the middle of each; serve very hot and quickly, and send very hot plates to table. Ti7ne,—6 to 8 minutes. Average cost, ijc/. each. Sufficient.—Allow 1 for each person. Seasonable at any time. JSfote.—A prettier dish than the above may be made by serving the kidneys each on a piece of buttered toast cut in any fanciful shape. In this case a little lemon-juice will be found an improvement. FBIED KIDNEYS. 725. IiTGHEDiENTS.—Kidneys, butter, pepper and salt to taste. 3Iode.—Cut the kidneys open without quite dividing them, remove the skin, and put a small piece of butter in the frying-pan. When the butter is melted, lay in the kidneys the flat side downwards, and fry them for 7 or 8 minutes, turning them when they are half-done. Serve on a piece of dry toast, season with pepper and salt, and put a small piece of butter in each kidney ; pour the gravy from the pan over them, and serve very hot. Time.—7 or 8 minutes. Average cost^ lid. each. Sufficient.—Allow 1 kidney to each person. Seasonable at any time.MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. 3^2 KOAST HAUITCH OF MUTTOlNr. 726. Ingeedients.—Hauncli of mutton, a little salt, flour. Mode—Let this joint hang as long as possible without becoming tainted, and while hanging dust flour over it, which keeps off" the flies, and prevents the air from getting to it. If not well hung, the joint, when it comes to table, will neither do i^^'^'"' ^^^^^^^^^ credit to the butcher or the cook, as it ^^M^ ^ '^y^^^^L ^^^1 ^® tender. Wash the outside ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ well, lest it should have a bad flavour from keeping; then flour it and put it HAWCH OF MUTTON-. _ , . , . , n I' ^ down to a nice brisk nre, at some distance, so that it may gradually warm through. Keep continually basting, and about i hour before it is served, draw it nearer to the fire to get nicely brown. Sprinkle a little fine salt over the meat, pour ofl" the dripping, add a little boiling water slightly salted, and strain this over the joint. Place a paper ruche on the bone, and send red-currant jelly and gravy in a tureen to table with it. 2Vme.—About 4 hours. Average cost, 10c?. per lb. Sufficient for 8 to 10 persons. Seasonable,—In best season from September to March. How TO But Meat Ecoi^omically.—If the housekeeper is not very particular as to the precise joints to cook for dinner, there is oftentimes an opportunity for her to save as much money in her purchases of meat as will pay for the bread to eat with it. It often occurs, for instance, that the butcher may have a superfluity of certain joints, and these he would be glad to get rid of at a reduction-of sometimes as much as Id. or \\d, per lb., and thus, in a joint of 8 or 9 lbs., will be saved enough to buy 2 quartern loaves. It frequently happens with many butchers, that, in consequence of a demand for legs and loins of mutton, they have only shoulders left, and these they will be glad to sell at a reduction. ROAST LEG OF MUTTOIT. 727. Ingeedients.—Leg of mutton, a little salt. Mode,—K^ mutton, when freshly killed, is never tender, hang it almost as long as it will keep; flour it, and put it in a cool airy place for a few days, if the weather will permit. "Wash off the flour, wipe it very dry, and cut off the shank-bone; put it down to a brisk clear fire, dredge with flour, and keep continually basting the whole time it is cooking. About 20 minutes before serving, draw it near the fire to get nicely brown ; sprinkle over it a little salt, dish the meat, pour off the dripping, add some boiling water slightly salted, strain it over the joint, and serve.MUTTON. Time.—A. leg of mutton weighing 10 lbs., about 2^ or 2i hours; one of 7 lbs., about 2 hours, or rather less. Average cost, Sid. per lb. Sufficient'—A moderate-sized leg of mutton sufficient for 6 or 8 persons. Seasonable at anytime, but not so good in June, July, and August. BOAST LOIN" OF MUTTON. I 728. IiraBEBlEiTTS.—Loin of mutton, a little salt. Mode.—Cwt and trim off the superfluous fat, and see that the butcher joints the meat properly, as thereby much annoyance is saved to I the carver, when it comes to table. Have ready a nice clear fire (it need not be a very wide large one), put down the meat, dredge with flour, and baste well until it is done. Make the gravy as for roast leg of mutton, and serve very hot. Time,—A loin of mutton weighing 6 lbs., li hour, or rather longer. Average cost, 8id. per lb. Sufficient for 4 or 5 persons. /Seasonable at any time. BOLIiED LOIN OF MUTTON" (Very Excellent). i 729. Ingredieis^ts.—About 6 lbs. of a loin of mutton, i teaspoonful of pepper, I teaspoonful of pounded allspice, ? teaspoonful of mace, I teaspoonful of nutmeg, 6 cloves, forcemeat No. 417, 1 glass of port wine, 2 tablespoonfuls of mushroom ketchup. Mode.—Hang the mutton till tender, bone it, and sprinkle over it ipepper, mace, cloves, allspice, and nutmeg in the above proportion, all of which must be pounded very fine. Let it remain for a day, then make a forcemeat by recipe No. 417, cover the meat with it, and roll and bind it up firmly. Half bake it in a slow oven, let it grow cold, take off the fat, and put the gravy into a stewpan; flour the meat, put it in the gravy, and stew it till perfectly tender. Now take out the meat, unbind it, add to the gravy wine and ketchup as above, give one boil, and pour over the meat. Serve with red-currant jelly; and, if obtainable, a few mushrooms stewed for a few minutes in the gravy, will be found a great improvement. Time.—l^ hour to bake the meat, U hour to stew gently. XOITT OP MUIIOKT.MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. S44 Average cost, 4tS, 9d. Suffccient for 5 or 6 persons. Seasonable at any time. Note.—This joint will be found very nice if rolled and stuffed, as here directed, and plainly roasted. It should be well basted, and served with a good gravy and currant jeliy. BOILED NECK OF MUTTOIT. 730. IiTGEELiENTS.—4 Ibs. of the middle, or best end of tlie neck of mutton; a little salt. Mode.—Trim oif a portion of the fat, should there be too much, and if it is to look particularly nice, the chine-bone should be sawn down, the ribs stripped halfway down, and the ends of the bones chopped off; this is, however, not necessary. Put the meat into sufficient hoiling water to cover it; when it boils, add a little salt and remove all the scum. Draw the saucepan to the side of the fire, and let the water get so cool that the finger may be borne in it; then simmer very shivhj and gently until the meat is done, which will be in about 1^ hour, or rather more, reckoning from the time that it begins to simmer. Serve with turnips and caper sauce, No. 382, and pour a little of it over the meat. The turnips should be boiled with the mutton ; and, when at hand, a few carrots will also be found an improvement. These, however, if very large and thick, must be cut into long thinnish pieces, or they will not be sufficiently done by the time the mutton is ready. Garnish the dish with carrots and turnips placed alternately round the mutton. Time.—4 lbs. of the neck of mutton, about li hour. Average cost, 8|c7. per lb. g Sufficient for 6 or 7 persons. ^ Seasonable at any time. The Poets ok Sheep.—The keeping of floelis seems to have been the first employment of mankind; and the most ancient sort of poetry was probably pastoral. The poem known as the Pastoral gives a picture of the Hfe of the simple shepherds of the golden age, who are supposed to have beguiled their time in singing. In all pastorals, repeated allusions are made to the *' fleecy flocks," the " milk-white lambs," and '* the tender ewes ;" indeed, the sheep occupy a position in these poems inferior only to that of the shepherds who tend them. The "nibbling sheep" has ever been a favourite of the poets, and has suppUed them with figures and similes without end. Shakspere frequently compares men to sheep. When Gloster rudely drives the lieutenant from the side of Henry YI., the poor king thus touchingly speaks of his helplessness :— " So flies the reckless shepherd from the wolf: So first the harmless sheep doth yield his fleece. And next his throat, unto the butcher's knife." In the " Two Gentlemen of "Verona," we meet with the following humorous com- parison :— *' Froteus. The sheep for fodder follow the shepherd, the shepherd for food follows not the sheep : thou for wages foUowest thy master, thy master for wages follows not thee j therefore, thou art a sheep. "Sjpeed. Such another proof will make me cry haa'*345 MUTTON. The descriptive ^oets give us some cliarining pictures of sheep. Every one ia familiar with the sheep-shearing scene in Thomson's " Seasons — ** Heavy and dripping, to the breezy brow Slow move the harmless race; where, as they spread Their swelling treasures to the sunny ray, Inly disturb'd, and wond'ring what this wild ^ Outrageous tumult means, their loud complaints The country fill; and, toss'd from rock to rock. Incessant bleatings run around the hiUs." What an exquisite idea of stillness is conveyed in the oft-quoted line from Gray's "Elegy:"— ** And drowsy tinklings lull the distant fold." From Dyer's quaint poem of " The Fleece " we could cull a hundred passages relating to sheep; but we have already exceeded our space. We cannot, however, close this brief notice of the allusions that have been made to sheep by our poets, without quoting a couple of verses from Kobert Burns's " Elegy on Poor Mailie/' his only ** petyo^^;e;"— '* Thro' a' the town she troll'd by him; A lang half-mile she could descry him; Wi' kindly bleat, when she did spy him, She ran wi' speed; A friend mair faithfu' ne'er cam' nigh him Than Mailie dead. ** I wat she was a sheep o' sense.

Ingredients.—Neck of mutton; a little salt. 3fode.—For roasting, choose the middle, or the best end, of the neck of mutton, and if there is a very large proportion of fat, trim off some of it, and save it 'for making into suet puddings, which will be found exceedingly good. Let the bones be cut short, and see that it is properly jointed before it is laid down to the fire, as they will be more easily separated when they come to table. Place the joint at a nice brisk fire, dredge it with flour, and keep 1 o ^5 '^'^r^J'-c, continually basting until done. A few 1—3. Jiest end. 2—3, Scrag. , ° , minutes before serving, draw it nearer the fire to acquire a nice colour, sprinkle over it a little salt, pour off the dripping, add a little boiling water slightly salted; strain this over the meat and serve. Red-currant jelly may be sent to table with it. Time.—4; lbs. of the neck of mutton, rather more than 1 hour. Average cost^ Si^?. per lb. Sufficient for 4 or 5 persons. Seasonahle at any time. Woollen Manufactuees.—The distinction between hair and wool is rather arbitrary than natural, consisting in the greater or less degrees of fineness, softness, and pliability of the fibres. When the fibres possess these properties so far as to admit of their bein^i^ spun and woven into a texture sufiieiently pliable to be used as an article of dress, they are called wool. The sheep, llama, Angora goat, and the goat of Thibet, are the animals from which most of the wool used in manufactures is obtained. The finest of all wools is that from the goat of Thibet, of which the Cashmere shawls are made. Of European wools, the finest is that yielded by the Merino sheep, the Spanish and Saxon breeds taking the precedence. The Merino sheep, as now naturalized in Australia, furnishes an excellent fieece; but all varieties of sheep-wool, reared either in Europe or Australia, are inferior in softness of feel to that grown in India, and to that of the llama of the Andes. The best of our British wools are inferior in fineness to any of the above- mentioned, being nearly twelve times the thickness of the finest Spanish raerino; but, for the ordinary purposes of the manufacturer, they are unrivalled. BOAST SADDLE OP MUTTO]Sr. 738. Ihgeedieitts.—Saddle of mutton; a little salt. Mode.—To insure this joint being tender, let it hang for ten days or a fortnight, if the weather per- mits. Cut off the tail and flaps, and trim away every part that has not indisputable pretensions to be eaten, and have the skin taken off and skewered on again. Put it down to a bright, clear fire, and, when the joint SADDLE OE MUTT03S-. , , •, • /. i has been cooking for an hour, remove the skin and dredge it with flour. It should not be placed too nearMUTTON. 349 the fire, as the fat should not be in the slightest degree burnt. Keep constantly basting, both before and after the skin is removed; sprinkle some salt over the joint. Make a little gravy in the dripping-pan ; pour it over the meat, which send to table with a tureen of made gravy and red-currant jelly. Time—A saddle of mutton weighing 10 lbs., 2i hours; 14 lbs., 3j hours. When liked underdone, allow rather less time. Average costy IQd. per lb. Sufficient.—A moderate-sized saddle of 10 lbs. for 7 or 8 persons. Seasonable all the year; not so good when lamb is in full season. BOAST SHOULDER OF MTJTTOIT. 739. Ingredients.—Shoulder of mutton; a little salt. Mode.—Vxit the joint down to a bright, clear fire ; flour it well, and keep continually basting. About J hour before serving, draw it near the fire, that the outside may acquire a nice brown colour, but not sufficiently near to blacken the fat. Sprinkle a little fine salt over the meat, empty the dripping-pan of its contents, pour in shouldeb of mutton-. a little boiling water slightly salted, and strain this over the joint. Onion sauce, or stewed Spanish onions, are usually sent to table with this dish, and sometimes baked potatoes. Time.—A shoulder of mutton weighing 6 or 7 lbs., li hour. Average cost^ Sd. per lb. Sufficient for 5 or 6 persons. Seasonable at any time. iVo^e.-—Shoulder of mutton may be dressed in a variety of ways; boiled, and served with onion sauce; boned, and stuffed with a good veal forcemeat; or baked, with sliced potatoes in the dripping-pan. The Etteice Shepherd.—James Hogg was perhaps the most remarkable man that exer wore the maud of a shepherd. Under the garb, aspect, and bearing of a rude peasant (and rude enough he was in most of these things, even after no inconsiderable experience of society), the world soon discovered a true poet. He taught himself to write, by copying the letters of a printed book as he lay watching his flock on the hill- side, and believed that he had reached the utmost pitch of his ambition when he first found that his artless rhymes could touch the heart of the ewe-milker who partook the shelter of his mantle during the passing storm. If ** the shepherd " of Professor Wilson's *' Noctes Ambrosianse " may be taken as a true portrait of James Hogg, we must admit that, for quaintness of humour, the poet of Ettrick Porest had few rivals. Sir Walter Scott said that Hopg's thousand little touches of absurdity afforded him more enter- tainment than the best comedy that ever set the pit in a roar. Among the written productions of the shepherd-poet, is an account of his own experiences in sheep-tending, called The Shepherd's Calender." This work contains a vast amount of useful in- formation upon sheep, their diseases, habits, and management. The Ettrick Shepherd died in 1835.350 MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY.

Singed Sheep's Head.—The village of Dudingston, which stands ''-mthin a mil© of Edinburgh town," was formerly celebrated for this ancient and homely Scottish dish. In the summer months, many opulent citizens used to resort to this place to solace themselves over singed sheep's heads, boiled or baked. The sheep fed upon the neigh- bouring hills were slaughtered at this village, and the carcases were sent to town; but the heads were left to be consumed in the place. "We are not aware whether the custom of eating sheep's heads at Dudingston is still kept up by the good folks of Edinburgh, TOAB-IKT-THE-HOLE (Cold Meat Cookery). 743.

Two lambs "of the first year" w^ere appointed to be sacrificed daily for the morning and evening sacrifice; and a lamb served as a substitute for the first-born of unclean animals, such as the ass, which could not be accepted as an offering to the Lord. Every year, also, on the anniversary of the deliverance of the children of Israel from the bondage of Egypt, every family was ordered to sacrifice a lamb or kid, and to sprinkle some of its blood upon the door-posts, in commemoration of the judgment of God upon the Egyptians. It was to be eaten roasted, with unleavened bread and bitter herbs, in haste, with the loins girded, tho shoes on the feet, and the staff in the hand; and whatever remained until the morning was to be burnt. The sheep was also used in the numerous special, individual, and national sacrifices ordered by the Jewish law. On extraordinary occasions, vast quantities of sheep were sacrificed at once; thus Solomon, on the completion of tho temple, offered *• sheep and oxen that could not be told nor numbered for multitude."

A deep cut should, in the first place, be made quite down , to the bone, across the knuckle-end of the joint, along the line 1 to 2. This will let the gravy escape; and then it should be carved, in not too thick slices, along the whole length of the haunch, in the direction of the line from 4 to 3. LEa OF MUTTOK. 760. This homely, but capital English joint, is almost invariably served at table as shown in the engraving. The carving of it is not very diflicult: the knife should be carried sharply down in the direction of the line from 1 to 2, and slices taken from either side, as the guests may desire, some liking the knuckle- end, as well done, and others preferring the more underdone part. The fat should be sought near the line 3 to 4. Some connoisseurs are fond of having this joint dished with the under-side uppermost, so as to get at the finely-grained meat lying under that part of the meat. LEG OE MUTTOM-,359 MUTTON CARVING. known as tlie Pope's eye; but this is an extravagant fashion, and one that will hardly find favour in the eyes of many economical British housewives and housekeepers. LOm OF MUTTON. 761. There is one point in connection with carving a loin of mutton which includes every other; that is, that the joint should be thoroughly well jointed by the butcher before it is cooked. This knack of jointing requires practice and the proper tools; and no one but the butcher is supposed to have these. If the bones be not well jointed, the carving of a loin of mutton is not a gracious busi- loin of muttoit. ness ; whereas, if that has been attended to, it is an easy and untroublesome task. The knife should be inserted at fig. 1, and after feeling your way between the bones, it should be carried sharply in the direction of the line 1 to 2. As there are some people who prefer the outside cut, while others do not like it, the question as to their choice of this should be asked. SADDLE OF MUTIOX, SADDLE OF MUTTOIT. 762. Although we have heard, at various intervals, growlings ex- pressed at the inevitable " saddle of mutton'* at the dinner-parties of our middle classes, yet we doubt whether any other joint is better liked, when it has been well hung and artistically cooked. There is a diversity of opinion respecting the mode of sending this joint to table; but it has only reference to whether or no there shall be any portion of the tail, or, if so, how many joints of the tail. We ourselves prefer the mode as shown in our coloured illustration "0;" but others may, upon equally good grounds, like the way shown in the engraving on this page. Some trim the tail with a paper frill. The carving is not difficult: it is usually cut in the direction of the line from 2 to 1, quite down to the bones, in evenly-sliced pieces. A fashion, however, patronized by some, is to carve it obliquely, in the direction of the line from 4 to 3; in which case the joint would be turned round the other way, having the tail end on the right of the carver. SHOULDER OF MUTTOlsT. 763. This is a joint not difficult to carve. The knife should beSCO MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. dra^Yn from the outer edge of the shoulder in the direction of the line from 1 to 2, until the bone of the shoulder is reached. As many slices as can be carved in this manner should be taken, and afterwards the meat lying on either side of the blade-bone should be served, by carving in the direction of 3 to 4 and 3 to 4. The uppermost side of the shoulder being now finished, the joint should be turned, and slices taken off along its whole length. There are some who prefer this under-side of the shoulder for its juicy flesh, although the grain of the meat is not so fine as that on the other side. SHOULDEE OP MXJTTOX. FOEE-QUAETER OP LAMB. FOEE-QtrARTER OF LAMB. 764. We always think that a good and practised carver delights in the manipulation of this joint, for there is a little field for his judg- ment and dexterity which does not always occur. The separation of the shoulder from the breast is the first point to be attended to; this is done by passing the knife lightly round the dotted line, as shown by the figures 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, so as to cut through the skin, and then, by raising with a little force the shoulder, into which th-e fork should be firmly fixed, it will come away with just a little more exercise of the knife. In dividing the shoulder and breast, the carver should take care not to cut away too much of the meat from the latter, as that would rather spoil its appearance when the shoulder is removed. The breast and shoulder being separated, it is usual to lay a small piece of butter, and sprinkle a little cayenne, lemon-juice, and salt between them; and when this is melted and incorporated with the meat and gravy, the shoulder may, as more convenient, be removed into another dish. The next operation is to separate the ribs from the brisket, by cutting through the meat on the line 5 to 6. The joint is then ready to be served to th<s guests; the ribs being carved in the direction of the lines from 9 to 10, and the brisket from 7 to 8. The carver should ask those at the table what parts they prefer—ribs, brisket, or a piece of the shoulder. LEG OF LAMB, LOIK OP LAMB, SADDLE OF LAMB, SHOULDER OF LAMB, are carved in the same manner as the corresponding joints of mutton. (See Nos. 760, 761, 762, 763.)CHAPTER XYI. GENERAL OBSEBVATIOHS OIT THE COMMON HOa. 765. The Hog belongs to the order Mammalia, the genus Sns scrofa, and the species Pachydermata, or thick-skinned; and its generic characters are, a small head, with long flexible snout truncated ; 42 teeth, divided into 4 upper incisors, converging, 6 lower incisors, projecting, 2 upper and 2 lower canine, or tusks,—the former short, the latter projecting, form-idable, and sharp, and 14 molars in each jaw ; cloven feet furnished with 4 toes, and tail, small, short, and twisted; while, in some varieties, this appendage is altogether wanting. 766. Fko:>i the Number and Position of the Teeth, physiologists are enabled to define the nature and functions of the animal; and from those of the Sus, or hog, it is evident that he is as much a grinder as a hiter, or can live as well on vegetable as on animal food; though a mixture of both is plainly indicated as the character of food most conducive to the integrity and health of its physical system, 767. Thus the Pig Tribe, though not a ruminating mammal, as might be inferred from the number of its molar teeth, is yet a link between the Jierhivorous and the carnivorous tribes, and is consequently what is known as an omnivoroiLS quadruped; or, in other words, capable of converting any kind of aliment into nutriment.362 MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. 768. Though the Hoof in the Hog is, as a general rule, cloven, there are several remarkable exceptions, as in the species native to Norway, Illyria, Sardinia, and formerly to the Berkshire variety of the British domesticated pig, in which the hoof is entire and it?icleft. 769. Whatever Difference in its Physical Nature, climate and soil may produce in this animal, his functional characteristics are the same in whatever part of the world he maybe found; and whether in the trackless forests of South America, the coral isles of Polynesia, the jungles of India, or the spicy brakes of Sumatra, he is everywhere known for his gluttony, laziness, and indifference to the character and quality of his food. And though he occasionally shows an epicure's relish for a succulent plant or a luscious carrot, which he will discuss with all his salivary organs keenly excited, he will, the next moment, turn with equal gusto to somo carrion offal that might excite the forbearance of the unscrupulous cormorant. It is this coarse and repulsive mode of feeding that has, in every country and language, obtained for him the opprobrium of being " an unclean animal." 770. In the Mosaical Law, the pig is condemned as an unclean beast, and consequently interdicted to the Israelites, as unfit for human food. ''And the swine, though he divideth the hoof and be cloven-footed, yet he cheweth not the cud. He is unclean to you."—Lev. xi. 7. Strict, however, as the law was respecting the cud-chewing and hoof-divided animals, the Jews, with their usual perversity and violation of the divine commands, seem afterwards to have ignored the prohibition; for, unless they ate pork, it is difficult to con- ceive for what purpose they kept droves of swine, as from the circumstance recorded in Matthew xviii. 32, when Jesus was in Galilee, and the devils, cast out of the two men, were permitted to enter the herd of swine that were feeding on the hills in the neighbourhood of the Sea of Tiberias, it is very evident they did. There is only one interpretation by which we can account for a prohibition that debarred the Jews from so many foods which we regard as nutritious luxuries, that, being fat and the texture more hard of digestion than other meats, they were likely, in a hot dry climate, where vigorous exercise could seldom be taken, to produce disease, and especially cutaneous affections; indeed, in this light, as a code of sanitary ethics, the book of Leviticus is the most admirable system of moral government ever conceived for man's benefit. 771. Setting his coarse Feeding and slovenly Habits out op the question, there is no domestic animal so profitable or so useful to man as the much-maligned pig, or any that yields him a more varied or more luxurious repast. The prolific powers of the pig are extraordinary, even under the restraint of domestication; but when left to run wild in favourable situa- tions, as in the islands of the South Pacific, the result, in a few years, from two animals put on shore and left undisturbed, is truly surprising; for they breed so fast, and have such numerous litters, that unless killed off inTHE HOG. 863 vast numbers both for the use of the inhabitants and as fresh provisions for ships' crews, they would degenerate into vermin. In this country the pig has usually two litters, or farrows, in a year, the breeding seasons being April and October; and the period the female goes with her young is about four months,—16 weeks or 122 days. The number produced at each litter depends upon the character of the breed; 12 being the average number in the small variety, and 10 in the large; in the mixed breeds, however, the average is between 10 and 15, and in some instances has reached as many as 20. But however few, or however many, young pigs there may be to the farrow, there is always one who is the dwarf of the family circle, a poor, little, shrivelled, half-starved anatomy, with a small melancholy voice, a staggering gait, a woe-begone countenance, and a thread of a tail, whose existence the complacent mother ignores, his plethoric brothers and sisters repudiate, and for whose emaciated jaws there is never a spare or supple- mental teat, till one of the favoured gormandizers, overtaken by momentary oblivion, drops the lacteal fountain, and gives the little squeaking struggler the chance of a momentary mouthful. This miserable little object, which may be seen bringing up the rear of every litter, is called the Tony pig, or the Antliony; so named, it is presumed, from being the one always assigned to the Church, when tithe was taken in kind; and as St. Anthony was the patron of husbandry, his name was given in a sort of bitter derision to the starveling that constituted his dues; for whether there are ten or fifteen farrows to the litter, the Anthony is always the last of the family to come into the world, 772. From the Crossness of his Feeding, the large amount of aliment he consumes, his gluttonous way of eating it, from his slothful habits, laziness, and indulgence in sleep, the pig is particularly liable to disease, and especially indigestion, heartburn, and affections of the skin. 773. To COUNTERACT THE CONSEQUENCE OP A VIOLATION OF THE Physical Laws, a powerful monitor in the brain of the j)ig teaches him to seek for relief and medicine. To open the pores of his skin, blocked up with mud, and excite perspiration, he resorts to a tree, a stump, or his trough— anything rough and angular, and using it as a curry-comb to his body, obtains the luxury of a scratch and the benefit of cuticular evaporation; he next proceeds with his long supple snout to grub up antiscorbutic roots, cooling salads of mallow and dandelion, and, greatest treat of all, he stumbles on a piece of chalk or a mouthful of delicious cinder, which, he knows by instinct, is the most sovereign remedy in the world for that hot, unpleasant sensation he has had all the morning at his stomach. 774. It is a Eemarkable Fact that, though every one who keeps a pig knows how prone he is to disease, how that disease injures the quality of the meat, and how eagerly he pounces on a bit of coal or cinder, or any coarse dry substance that will adulterate the rich food on which he lives, and byMODERN HODSEHOLD COOKERY. m affording soda to his system, correct the vitiated fluids of his body,—yet very few have the judgment to act on what they see, and by supplying the pig with a few shovelfuls of cinders in his sty, save the necessity of his rooting for what is so needful to his health. Instead of this, however, and without supplying the animal with what its instinct craves for, his nostril is bored with a red-hot iron, and a ring clinched in his nose to prevent rooting for what he feels to be absolutely necessary for his health ; and ignoring the fact that, in a domestic state at least, the pig lives on the richest of all food,—scraps of cooked animal substances, boiled vegetables, bread, and other items, given in that concentrated essence of aliment for a quadruped called wash, and that he eats to repletion, takes no exercise, and finally sleeps all the twenty-four hours he is not eating, and then, when the animal at last seeks for those medicinal aids which would obviate the evil of such a forcing diet, his keeper, instead of meeting his animal instinct by human reason, and giving him what he seeks, has the inhumanity to torture him by a ring, that, keeping up a perpetual "raw" in the pig's snout, prevents his digging for those corrective drugs which would remove the evils of his artificial existence. 775. Though subject to so many Diseases, no domestic animal is more easily kept in health, cleanliness, and comfort, and this without the necessity of ^'ringing," or any excessive desire of the hog to roam, break through his sty, or plough up his pound. Whatever the kind of food may be on which the pig is being fed or fattened, a teaspoonful or more of salt should always be given in his mess of food, and a little heap of well-burnt cinders, with occa- sional bits of chalk, should always be kept by the side of his trough, as well as a vessel of clean water: his pound, or the front part of his sty, should be totally free from straw, the brick flooring being every day swept out and sprinkled with a layer of sand. His lair, or sleeping apartment, should be well sheltered by roof and sides from cold, wet, and all changes of weather, and the bed made up of a good supply of clean straw, sufficiently deep to enable the pig to burrow his unprotected body beneath it. All the refuse of the garden, in the shape of roots, leaves, and stalks, should be placed in a corner of his pound or feeding-chamber, for the delectation of his leisure moments; and once a week, on the family washing-day, a pail of warm soap-suds should be taken into his sty, and, by means of a scrubbing-brush and soap, his back, shoulders, and flanks should be well cleaned, a pail of clean warm water being thrown over his body at the conclusion, before he is allowed to retreat to his clean straw to dry himself. By this means, the excessive nutrition of his aliment will be corrected, a more perfect digestion insured, and, by opening the pores of the skin, a more vigorous state of health acquired than could have been obtained under any other system. 776. We have already said that no other animal yields man so mayiy kinds and varieties of luxurious food as is supplied to him by the flesh of the hog differently prepared; for almost every part of the animal, either fresh;865 THE HOG. salted, or di'ied, is used for food ; and even those viscera not so employed aro of the utmost utility in a domestic point of view. 777. Though destitute op the Hide, Horns, and Hoofs, constituting the offal of most domestic animals, tho pig- is not behind the other mammalia in its usefulness to man. Its skin, especially that of the boar, from its extreme closeness of texture, when tanned, is employed for the seats of saddles, to cover powder, shot, and drinking-flasks; and the hair, according to its colour, flexibility, and stubbornness, is manufactured into tooth, nail, and hair- brushes,—others into hat, clothes, and shoe-brushes; while .the longer and finer qualities are made into long and short brooms and painters' brushes ; and a still more rigid description, under the name of bristles," are used by the shoemaker as needles for the passage of his wax-end. Besides so many bene- fits and useful services conferred on man by this valuable animal, his fat, in a commercial sense, is quite as important as his flesh, and brings a price equal to the best joints in the carcase. This fat is rendered, or melted out of the caul, or membrane in which it is contained, by boiling water, and, while liquid, run into prepared bladders, when, under the name of lard, it becomes an article of extensive trade and value. 778. Of the numerous Varieties of the Domesticated Hog, the fol- lowing list of breeds may be accepted as the best, presenting severally all those qualities aimed at in the rearing of domestic stock, as affecting both the breeder and the consumer. Native—Berkshire, Essex, York, and Cumber- land; Foreign—tho Chinese. Before, however, proceeding with the con- sideration of the different orders, in the series we have placed them, it will be necessary to make a few remarks relative to the pig generally. In the first place, the Black Pig is regarded by breeders as the best and most eligible animal, not only from the fineness and delicacy of the skin, but because it is less affected by the heat in summer, and far less sul»ject to cuticular disease than either the white or brindled hog, but more particularly from its kindlier nature and greater aptitude to fatten. 779. The Great Quality first sought for in a Hog is a capacious stomach, and next, a healthy power of digestion ; for the greater the quantity lie can eat, and the more rapidly he can digest* what he has eaten, the more quickly will he fatten ; and the faster he can be made to increase in flesh, with- out a material increase of bone, the better is the breed considered, and the more valuable the animal. In the usual order of nature, the development of flesh and enlargement of bone proceed together; but here the object is to outstrip the growth of the bones by the quicker development of their fleshy covering. 780. The Chief Points sought for in the Choice op a Hog are breadth of chest, depth of carcase, width of loin, chine, and ribs, compactness of form, docility, cheerfulness, and general beauty of appearance. The headMODERl^ HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. 366 in a well-bred hog must not be too long, the forehead narrow and convex, cheeks full, snout fine, mouth small, eyes small and quick, ears short, thin, and sharp, pendulous, and pointing forwards; neck full and broad^ particularly on the top, where it should join very broad shoulders; the ribs, loin, and haunch should be in a uniform line, and the tail well set, neither too high nor too low ; at the same time the back is to be straight or slightly curved, the chest deep, broad, and prominent, the legs short and thick; the belly, when well fattened, should nearly touch the ground, the hair be long, thin, fine, and having few bristles, and whatever the colour, uniform, either white, black, or blue ; but not spotted, speckled, brindled, or sandy. Such are the features and requisites that, among breeders and judges, constitute the heau ideal of a perfect pig, 781. The Berkshire Pig is the best known and most esteemed of all our English domestic breeds, and so highly is it regarded, that even the varieties of the stock are in as great estimation as the parent breed itself. The characteristics of the Berkshire hog are that it has a tawny colour, spotted with black, large ears hanging over the eyes, a thick, close, and well-made body, legs short and small in the bone; feeds up to a great weight, fattens quickly, and is good either for pork or bacon. The New or Improved Berk- shire possesses all the above qualities, but is infinitely more prone to fatten, while the objectionable colour has been entirely done away with, being now either all white or completely black. 782. Next to the former, the Essex takes place in pubHc estimation, always competing, and often successfully, with the Berkshire, The peculiar characters of the Essex breed are that it is tip-eared, has a long sharp head, is roach-backed, with a long flat body, standing high on the legs ; is rather bare BEEKSHIEE SOW.THE HOG. 367 of hair, is a quick feeder, has an enormous capacity of stomach and belly, and an appetite to match its receiving capability. Its colour is white, or els© black ESSEX sow. and white, and it has a restless habit and an unquiet disposition. The present valuable stock has sprung from a cross between the common native animal and either the White Chinese or Black Neapolitan breeds. 783. The Yorkshire, called also the Old Lincolnshire, was at one time the largest stock of the pig family in England, and perhaps, at that time, the roBKSHiBS sow. worst. It was long-legged, weak in the loins, with coarse white curly hair, and flabby flesh. Now, however, it has undergone as great a change as any breedMODEEN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY, 868 in the kingdom, and by judicious crossing has become the most valuable we possess, being a very well-formed pig throughout, with a good head, a pleasant docile countenance, with moderate-sized drooping ears, a broad back, slightly curved, large chine and loins, with deep sides, full chest, and well covered with long thickly-set white hairs. Besides these quaUties of form, he is a quick grower, feeds fast, and will easily make from 20 to 25 stone before completing his first year. The quality of the meat is also uncommonly good, the fat and lean being laid on in almost equal proportions. So capable is this species of development, both in flesh and stature, that examples of the Yorkshire breed have been exhibited weighing as much as a Scotch ox. 784. Though almost every County in England can boast some local variety or other of this useful animal, obtained from the native stock by crossing with some of the foreign kinds, Cumberland and the north-west parts of the kingdom have been celebrated for a small breed of white pigs, with a thick, compact, and well-made body, short in the legs, the head and back well formed, ears slouching and a little downwards, and on the whole, a hardy, profitable animal, and one well disposed to fatten, 785. There is no variety of this useful Animal that presents such peculiar features as the species known to us as the Chinese pig; and as it is the general belief that to this animal and the Neapolitan hog we are indebted for that remarkable improvement which has taken place in the breeds of the English pig, it is necessary to be minute in the description of this, in all respects, singular animal. The Chinese, in the first place, consists of many varieties, and pre- sents as many forms of body as differences of colour ; the best kind, how- ever, has a beautiful white skin of singular thinness and delicacy ; the hair too is perfectly white, and thinly set over the body, with here and there a few CL'MBEBLAIfD SOW.2 B THE HOG. 3G9 bristles. He has a broad snout, short head, eyes bright and fiery, very small fine pink ears, wide cheeks, high chine, with a neck of such immense thick- CHiNESE sow. ness, that when the animal is fat it looks like an elongated carcase,—a mass of fat, without shape or form, like a feather pillow. The belly is dependent, and almost trailing on the ground, the legs very short, and the tail so small as to be little more than a rudiment. It has a ravenous appetite, and will cat anything that the wonderful assimilating powers of its stomach can digest; and to that capability, there seems no limit in the whole range of animal or vegetable nature. The consequence of this perfect and singularly rapid di- gestion is an unprecedented proneness to obesity, a process of fattening that, once commenced, goes on with such rapid development, that, in a short time, it loses all form, depositing such an amount of fat, that it in fact ceases to have any refuse part or offal, and, beyond the hair on its back and the callous extremity of the snout, the ivhole carcase is eatable. 786. When judiciously fed on Vegetable Diet, and this obese tendency checked, the flesh of the Chinese pig is extremely delicate and delicious ; but when loft to gorge almost exclusively on animal food, it becomes oily, coarse, and unpleasant. Perhaps there is no other instance in nature where the effect of rapid and perfect digestion is so well shown as in this animal, which thrives on everytliing, and turns to the benefit of its physical economy, food of the most oj^i^osite nature, and of the most unwholesome and offensive character. When fully fattened, the thin cuticle, that is one of its characteristics, cracks, from the adipose distension beneath, exposing the fatty mass, which discharges a liquid oil from the adjacent tissues. The great fault in this breed is the remarkably small quantity of lean laid down, to the immense proportion of fat. Some idea of the growth of this species may be inferred from the fact of their attaining to 18 stone before two years, and when further advanced, as muchMODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. 370 as 40 stone. In its pure state, except for roasters, the Chinese pig is too disproportionate for the English market; but when crossed with some of our lean stock, the breed becomes almost invaluable. 787. The Wild Boar is a much more cleanly and sagacious animal than the domesticated hog; he is longer in the snout, has his ears shorter and his tusks considerably longer, very frequently measuring as much as 10 inches. They are extremely sharp, and are bent in an upward circle. Unlike his domestic brother, who roots up here and there, or wherever his fancy takes, the wild boar ploughs the ground in continuous lines or furrows. The boar, when selected as the parent of a stock, should have a small head, be deep and broad in the chest; the chine should be arched, the ribs and barrel well rounded, with the haunches falling full down nearly to the hock; and he should always be more compact and smaller than the female. The colour of the wild boar is always of a uniform hue, and generally of an iron grey; shading off into a black. The hair of the boar is of considerable length, especially about the head and mane; he stands, in general, from 20 to 30 inches in height at the shoulders, though instances have occurred where he has reached 42 inches. The young are of a pale yellowish tint, irregularly brindled with light brown. The boar of Germany is a large and formidable animal, and the hunting of him, with a small species of mastiff, is still a national sport. From living almost exclusively on acorns and nuts, his flesh is held in great esteem, and in Westphalia his legs are made into hams by a process which, it is said, enhances the flavour and quality of the meat in a remarkable degree. 788. There are two Points to be taken into consideration by all breeders of pigs—to what ultimate use is the flesh to be put; for, if meant to be eaten WESTPHALIAir BOAB,•THE HOG. 371 fresh^ or simply salted, ths small breed of pigs is best suited for the purpose j if for hams or bacon, the large variety of the animal is necessary. Pigs are usually weaned betv/een six and eight weeks after birth, after which they are fed on soft food, such as mashed potatoes in skimmed or butter-milk. The general period at which the small hogs are killed for the market is from 12 to 16 weeks; from 4 to 5 months, they are called store pigs, and are turned out to graze till the animal has acquired its full stature. As soon as this point has been reached, the pig should be forced to maturity as quickly as possible; he should therefore be taken from the fields and farm-yard, and shut up on boiled potatoes, buttermilk, and peas-meal, after a time to be followed by grains, oil-cake, wash, barley, and Indian meal; supplying his sty at the same time with plenty of water, cinders, and a quantity of salt in every mess of food presented to him. 789. The Estimated Number op Pigs in Great Britain is supposed to exceed 20 millions; and, considering the third of the number as worth-£2 apiece, and the remaining two-thirds as of the relative value of IO5. each, would give a marketable estimate of over £20,000,000 for this animal alone. 790. The best and most humane Mode of Killing all large Hogs is to strike them down like a bullock, with the pointed end of a poleaxe, on the forehead, which has the effect of killing the animal at once; all the butcher has then to do, is to open the^ aorta and great arteries, and laying the animal's neck over a trough, let out the blood as quickly as possible. The carcase is then to be scalded, either on a board or by immersion in a tub of very hot water, and all the hair and dirt rapidly scraped off, till the skin is made per- fectly white, when it is hung up, opened, and dressed, as it is called, in the usual way. It is then allowed to cool, a sheet being thrown around the carcase, to prevent the air from discolouring the newly-cleaned skin. When meant for bacon, the hair is singed instead of being scalded off. 791. In the Country, where for ordinary consum.ption the pork killed for sale is usually both larger and fatter than that supplied to the London con- sumer, it is customary to remove the skin and fat down to the lean, and, salting that, roast what remains of the joint. Pork goes further, and is consequently a more economical food than other meats, simply because the texture is closer, and there is less waste in the cooking, either in roasting or boiling. 792. In fresh Pork, the leg is the most economical family joint, and the loin the richest. 793. Comparatively Speaking, very little difference exists between the weight of the live and dead pig, and this, simply because there is neither the head nor the hide to be removed. It has been proved that pork loses in cooking 13^ per cent, of its weight. A salted hand v/eighing 4 lbs. 5 oz. lost in the cooking 11 oz.; after cooking, the meat weighing only 3 lbs. 1 oz., and the 2 B 2MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. S72 bone 9 oz. The original cost was l^d. a pound ; but by this deduction, the cost rose to 9d. per pound with the bone, and lOld. without it, 794. Pork, to be Preserved, is cured in several ways,—either by covering it with salt, or immersing it in ready-made brine, where it is kept till required; or it is only partially salted, and then hung up to dry, when the meat is called white bacon ; or, after salting, it is himg in wood smoke till the flesh is impreg- nated with the aroma from the wood. The Wiltshire bacon, which is regarded as the finest in the kingdom, is prepared by laying the sides of a hog in large wooden troughs, and then rubbing into the flesh quantities of powdered bay- salt, made hot in a frying-pan. This process is repeated for four days ; they are then left for three weeks, merely turning the flitches every other day. After that time they are hung up to dry. The hogs usually killed for purposes of bacon in England average from 18 to 20 stone ; on the other hand, the hogs ■ killed in the country for farm-house purposes, seldom weigh less than 26 stone. The legs of boars, hogs, and, in Germany, those of bears, are prepared dif- ferently, and called hams. 795. The Practice in vogue Formerly in this country was to cut out the hams and cure them separately ; then to remove the ribs, which were roasted as spare-ribs," and, curing the remainder of the side, call it a '^gammon of bacon." Small pork to cut for table in joints, is cut up, in most places throughout the kingdom, as represented in the engraving. The side is divided with nine ribs to the fore quarter ; and the following is an enumeration of the joints in the two respective quarters :— r 1. The leg. Hind Quarter i 2. The loin. L 3. The spring, or belly, r 4. The hand. Fore Quarter < 5. The fore-loin. L 6. The cheek. The weight of the several joints of a good pork pig of four stone may be as follows; viz. :— The leg 8 lbs.

ArsTRiAN Method 01" Herding Pigs.—In the Austrian empire there are great numbers of wild swine, while, among the wandering tribes peopling the interior of Hun« gaijy, and spreading over the vast steiDpes of that country, droves of swine form a great portion of the wealth of the people, who chiefly live on a coarse bread and wind-dried bacon. In German Switzerland, the Tyrol, and other mountainous districts of continental Europe, though the inhabitants, almost everywhere, as in England, keep one or more pigs, they are at little or no trouble in feeding them, one or more men being employed hj one or several villages as swine-herds; who, at a certain hour, every morning, call for the pig or pigs, and driving them to their feeding-grounds on the moimtain-side and in the wood, take custody of the herd till, on the approach of night, they are collected into a comi3act body and driven home for a night's repose in their several sties. The amount of intelligence and docihty displayed by the pigs in these mountain regions, is much more considerable than that usually allowed to this animal, and the manner in which these immense herds of swine are collected, and again distributed, without an accident or mistake, is a sight both curious and interesting; for it is all done without the assistance of a dog, or the aid even of the human voice, and solely by the crack of the long-lashed and heavily-loaded whip, which the swine-herd carries, and cracks much after the fashion of the French postilion; and which, though he frequently cracks, waking a hundred sharp echoes from the woods and rocks, he seldom has to use correctionally; the animal soon acquiring a thorough knowledge of the meaning of each crack; and once having felt its leaded thong, a lasting remembrance of its power. At early dawn, the swine-herd takes his stand at the outskirts of the first village, and begins flourishing through the misty air his immensely long lash, keeping a sort of rude time with the crack, crack, crack, crack, crack, crack of his whip. The nearest pigs, hearing the well-remembered sound, rouse from their straw, and rush from their sties into the road, followed by aU their litters. As soon as a sufiicient number are collected, the drove is set in motion, receiving, right and left, as they advance, fresh numbers; whole communities, or solitary individuals, streaming in from all quarters, and taking their place, without distinction, in the general herd; and, as if conscious where their breakfast lay, without wasting a moment on idle investigation, all eagerly push on to the mountains. In this manner village after village is collected, tiU the drove not unfre- quently consists of several thousands. The feeding-ground has, of course, often to be changed, and the drove have sometimes to be driven many miles, and to a considerable height up the mountain, before the whip gives the signal for the dispersion of the374 MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. body and tlie order to feed, when the herdsman proceeds to form himself a shelter, and look after his own comfort for the rest of the day._ As soon as twilight sets in, the whip is again heard echoing the signal for muster; and in the same order in which they were collected, the swine are driven back, each group tailing off to its respective sty, as the herd approaches the villages, till the last grunter, having found his home, the drover seeks his cottage and repose.

English Mode op Hunting, and Indian Pig-sticking.—The hunting of the wild Iboar has been in all times, and in all countries, a pastime of the highest interest and excitement, and from the age of Nimrod, has only been considered second to the more dangerous sport of lion-hunting. The buried treasures of Nineveh, restored to us bj Mr. Layard, show us, on their sculptured annals, the kings of Assyria in their royal pastime of boar-hunting. That the G-reeks were passionately attached to this sport, we know both from history and the romantic fables of the poets. Marc Antony, at one of his breakfasts with Cleopatra, had eight wild boars roasted whole; and though the Komans do not appear to have been addicted to hunting, wild-boar fights formed part of their gladiatorial shows in the amphitheatre. In France, Germany, and Britain, from the earhest time, the boar-hunt formed one of the most exciting of sports ; but it was only in this countiy that the sport was conducted without dogs,—a real hand-to-handMODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. contest of man and beast; tlie hunter, armed only with a boar-spear, a weapon about four feet long, the ash staiF, guarded by plates of steel, and terminating in a long, narrow, and very sharp blade: this, with a hunting-knife, or hanger, completed his offensive arms. Thus equipped, the hunter would either encounter his enemy face to face, confront his desperate charge, as with erect tail, depressed head, and flaming eyes, he rushed with his foamy tusks full against him, who either sought to pierce his vitals through his counter, or driving his spear through his chine, transfix his heart; or failing those more difficult aims, plunge it into his flank, and, without withdrawing the weapon, strike his ready hanger into his throat. But expert as the hunter might be, it was not often the formidable brute was so quickly dispatched; for he would sometimes seize the spear in his powerful teeth, and nip it off like a reed, or, coming full tilt on his enemy, by his momentum and weight bear him to the earth, ripping up, with a horrid gash, his leg or side, and before the writhing hunter could draw his knife, the infuriated beast would plunge his snout in the wound, and rip, with savage teeth, the bowels of his victim. At other times, he would suddenly swerve from his charge, and doubling on his opponent, attack the hunter in the rear. From his speed, great weight, and savage disposition, the wdld boar is always a dangerous antagonist, and requires great courage, coolness, and agility on the part of the hunter. The continental sportsman rides to the chase in a cavalcade, with music and dogs,—a kind of small hound or mastifi", and leaving all the honorary part of the contest to them, when the boar is becoming weary, and while beset by the dogs, rides up, and drives his lance home in the beast's back or side. Boar- hunting has been for some centuries obsolete in England, the animal no longer existing in a wild state among us; but in our Indian empire, and especially in I3engal, the pastime is pursued by our countrymen with all the daring of the national character ; and as the animal which inhabits the cane-brakes and jungles is a formidable foe, the sport is attended with great excitement. The hunters, mounted on small, active horses, and armed only with long lances, ride, at early daylight, to the skirts of the jungle, and having sent in their attendants to beat the cover, wait till the tusked monster comes crashing from among the canes, when chase is immediately given, till he is come up with, and transfixed by the first weapon. Instead of flight, however, he often turns to bay, and by more than one dead horse and wounded hunter, shows how formidable he is, and what those polished tusks, sharp as pitch-forks, can effect, when the enraged animal defends his life.

Poach the eggs and slip them on to the bacon without breaking the yolks, and serve quickly.PORK. 377 Time,—3 or 4 minutes. Average cost^ lOd, to Is. per lb. for the primest parts. Sufficient.—Allow 6 eggs for 3 persons. Seasonable at any time. JN'ote.—Fried rashers of bacon, curled, serve as a pretty garnish to many dishes; and, for small famihes, answer very well as a substitute for boiled bacon, to serve with a small dish of poultry, &c. BROILED RASHERS OF BAC03M (a Breakfast Dish). B03, Before purchasing bacon, ascertain that it is perfectly free from rust, which may easily be detected by its yellow colour ; and for broiling, the streaked part of the thick flank, is generally the most esteemed. Cut it into thin slices, take off the rind, and broil over a nice clear fire; turn it 2 or 3 times, and. serve very hot. Should there be any cold bacon left from the previous day, it answers very well for breakfast, cut into slices, and broiled or fried. Time.—3 or 4 minutes. Average cost, lOd. to l5. per lb. for the primest parts. Seasonahle at any time. Note.—When the bacon is cut very thin, the slices may be curled round and fastened by means of small skewers, and fried or toasted before the fire. BOILED BACOK. 804. Ingredients.—Bacon ; water. Mode.—As bacon is frequently excessively salt, let it be soaked in warm water for an hour or two previous to dressing it; then pare off the rusty parts, and scrape the under-side and rind as clean as possible. Put it into a saucepan of cold water, let it come gradu- ally to a boil, and as fast as the scum rises to the surface of the water, remove it. Let it simmer very gently until it is thorotighli/done; then take it up, strip off the skin, and sprinkle over the bacon a few bread raspings, and garnish with tufts of cauliflower or Brussels sprouts. When served alone, young and tender broad beans or green peas are the usual accompaniments. Time.—I lb. of bacon, J hour; 2 lbs., if hour. Average cost, IQd. to Is. per lb. for the primest parts. Sufficient.—2 lbs., when served with poultry or veal, sufficient for 10 persons. Seasonable at any time.378 MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. TO CUBE BACOlSr OT THE WILTSHIRE WAT. 805. Ingeedients—14 lb. of coarse sugar, li lb. of bay-salt, 6 oz. of saltpetre, 1 lb. of common salt. Jfo(/e.—Sprinkle each flitch with salt, and let the blood drain off for 24 hours; then pound and mix the above ingredients well together and rub it well into the meat, which should be turned every day for a month ; then hang it to dry, and afterwards smoke it for 10 days. Time.—To remain in the picMe 1 month, to be smoked 10 days. Sufficient.—The above quantity of salt for 1 pig. How Pigs WEEE toemeelt Pastueed and Fed.—Though, unquestionably far greater numbers of swine are now kept in England than formerly, every peasant having one or more of that useful animal, in feudal times immense droves of pigs were kept by the franklings and barons; in those days the swine-herds being a regular part of the domestic service of every feudal household, their duty consisted in daily driving the herd of swine from the castle-yard, or outlying farm, to the nearest woods, chase, or forest, where the frankling or vavasour had, either by right or grant, what was called free tvarren, or the hberty to feed his hogs off the acorns, beech, and chestnuts that lay in such abundance on the earth, and far exceeded the power of the royal or privileged game to consume. Indeed, it was the hcense granted the nobles of free warren, espe- cially for their swine, that kept up the iniquitous forest laws to so late a date, and covered so large a portion of the land with such immense tracts of wood and brake, to the injury of agriculture and the misery of the people. Som.e idea of the extent to which swine were grazed in the feudal times, may be formed by observing the number of pigs still fed in Epping Forest, the Forest of Dean, and the ISTew Forest, in Hamp- shire, where, for several months of the year, the beech-nuts and acorns yield them so plentiful a diet. In Germany, where the chestnut is so largely cultivated, the amount of food shed every autumn is enormous; and consequently the pig, both wild and domestic, has, for a considerable portion of the year, an unfaihng supply of admirable nourish- ment. Impressed with the value of this fruit for the food of pigs, the Prince Consort has, with great judgment, of late encouraged the collection of chestnuts in Windsor Park, and by giving a small reward to old people and children for every bushel collected, has not only found an occupation for many of the unemployed poor, but, by providing a gratuitous food for their pig, encouraged a feeling of providence and economy. POB CUKOTG- BACOK, AISTD KEEPIIMG IT FREE FBOM BUST (Cobbett's Recipe). 806. The two Sides that eemain, and which are called flitcheS;, are to be cured for bacon. They are first rubbed with salt on their insides, or flesh sides, then placed one on the other, the flesh sides uppermost, in a salting- trough which has a gutter round its edges to drain away the brine; for, to have sweet and fine bacon, the flitches must not be sojjping in brine, v/hicli gives it the sort of vile taste that barrel and sea pork have. Every one knows how difierent is the taste of fresh dry salt from that of salt in a dissolved state ; therefore change the salt often,—once in 4 or 5 days ; let it melt and sink in, but not lie too long ; twice change the flitches, put that at bottom which was first on the top : this mode will cost you a great deal more in salt than the sopping mode, but without it your bacon will not be so sweet and fine, nor keep so well. As for the time required in making your flitches sufficiently salt, it depends on circumstances. It takes a longer time for a thick than a thin flitch, and longer in dry than in damp weather, or in a dry than in a damp place ; but for the flitches of a hog of flve score, in weather not very dry or damp, about 6 weeks may do ; and as yours is to be fat, which receives little379 PORK. injury from over-salting, give time enough, for you are to have bacon until Christmas comes again. 807. The Place for Salting should, like a dairy, always be cool, but well ventilated; confined air, though cool, will taint meat sooner than the mid- day sun accompanied by a breeze. With regard to smoking the bacon, two precautions are necessary: first, to hang the flitches where no rain comes down upon them; and next, that the smoke must proceed from wood, not peat, turf, or coal. As to the time required to smoke a flitch, it depends a good deal upon whether there be a constant fire beneath ; and whether the fire be large or small: a month will do, if the fire be pretty constant and rich, as a farm- house fire usually is ; but over-smoking, or rather too long hanging in the air, makes the bacon rust; great attention should therefore be paid to this matter. The flitch ought not to be dried up to the hardness of a board, and yet it ought to be perfectly dry. Before you hang it up, lay it on the floor, scatter the flesh side pretty thickly over with bran, or with some fine sawdust, not of deal or fir; rub it on the flesh, or pat it well down upon it: this keeps the smoke from getting into the little openings, and makes a sort of crust to be dried on. 808. To keep the Bacon sweet and good, and free from hoppers, sift fine some clean and dry wood ashes. Put some at the bottom of a box or chest long enough to hold a flitch of bacon ; lay in one flitch, and then put in more ashes, then another flitch, and cover this with six or eight inches of the ashes. The place where the box or chest is kept ought to be dry, and should the ashes become damp, they should be put in the fiireplace to dry, and when cold, put back again. With these precautions, the bacon will be as good at the end of the year as on the first day. 809. For Simple General Eules, these may be safely taken as a guide ; and those who implicitly follow the directions given, will possess at the expira- tion of from 6 weeks to 2 months well-flavoured and well-cured bacon. Hog not Bacon". Anecdote of Losd Bacon.—As Lord Bacon, on one occasion, was about to pass sentence of death, upon a man of the name of Hogg, v^^ho had just been tried for a long career of crime, the prisoner suddenly claimed to be heard in arrest of judgment, saying, with an expression of arch confidence as he addressed the bench, *' I claim indulgence, my lord, on the plea of relationship; for I am convinced your lordship will never be unnatural enough to hang one of your own family." " Indeed,'' replied the judge, with some amazement, " I was not aware that I had the honour of your alliance; perhaps you wUl be good enough to name the degree of our mutual affinity." "I am sorry, my lord," returned the impudent thief, "I cannot trace the links of consanguinity; but the moral evidence is sufficiently pertinent. My name, my lord, is Hogg, your lordship's is Bacon; and ail the world wiU allow that bacon and hog are verj/ closely allied." " I am sorry," replied his lordship, " I cannot admit the truth of your instance : hog cannot be bacon till it is hanged; and so, before I can admit your plea, or acknowledge the family compact, Hogg must be hanged to-morrow morning." TO BAKE A HAM. 810. Ingredients.—Ham ; a common crust. Mode,—-A.?^ a bam for baking should be well soaked, let it remain380 MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY, in water for at least 12 hours. Wipe it dry, trim away any rusty places underneatli, and cover it with a common crust, taking care that this is of sufficient thickness all over to keep the gravy in. Place it in a moderately-heated oven, and bake for nearly 4 hours. Take off the crust, and skin, and cover with raspings, the same as for boiled ham, and garnish the knuckle with a paper frill. This method of cooking a ham is, by many persons, considered far superior to boiling it, as it cuts fuller of gravy and has a finer flavour, besides keeping a much longer time good. Tiine.—A medium-sized ham., 4 hours. Average cost, from 8c?. to lOJ. per lb. by the whole ham. ^easonahle all the year. TO BOIL A HAM. 811. Ingeedients.—Ham, water, glaze or raspings. Mode—In choosing a ham, ascertain that it is perfectly sweet, by running a sharp knife into it, close to the bone ; and if, when the knife is withdrawn, it has an agreeable smell, the ham is good ; if, on the con- trary, the blade has a greasy appear- ance and offensive smell, the ham is bad. If it has been long hung, and is very dry and salt, let it remain in soak for 24 hours, changing the water fre- Ciuently. This length of time is only necessary in the case of its being very hard ; from 8 to 12 hours would be sufficient for a Yorkshire or Westmoreland ham. Wash it thoroughly clean, and trim away from the under-side, all the rusty and smoked parts, which would spoil the appearance. Put it into a boiling-pot, with sufficient cold water to cover it; bring it gradually to boil, and as the scum rises, carefully remove it. Keep it simmering very gently until tender, and be care- ful that it does not stop boiling, nor boil too quickly. When done, take it out of the pot, strip off the skin, and sprinkle over it a few fine bread-raspings, put a frill of cut paper round the knuckle, and serve. If to be eaten cold, let the ham remain in the water until nearly cold: by this method the juices are kept in, and it will be found infinitely superior to one taken out of the water hot; it should, however, be borne in mind that the ham must not remain in the saucepan all night. When the skin is removed, sprinkle over bread-raspings, or, if wanted particularly nice, glaze it. Place a paper frill round the knuckle, and garnish with parsley or cut vegetable flowers. {See Coloured Plate P.)3^1 PORK. Time.—A ham weighing: 10 lbs., 4 hours to simmer gently; 15 lbs., 5 hours ; a very large one, about 6 hours. Average cost, from 8d to lOJ. per lb. by the whole ham. /Seasonable all the year. HOW TO BOIL A HAM TO GIVE IT AK EXCELLENT FLAVOUR. 8i2. Ingredients.—-Vinegar and water, 2 heads of celery, 2 turnips^ 3 onions, a large bunch of savoury herbs. 3fode.—Prepare the ham as in the preceding recipe, and let it soak for a few hours in vinegar and water. Put it on in cold water, and v/hen it boils, add the vegetables and herbs. Simmer very gently until tender, take it out, strip off the skin, cover with bread-raspings, and put a paper ruche or frill round the knuckle. Time,—A ham weighing 10 lbs., 4 hours. Average cost, 8d. to 10c?. per lb. by the whole ham. Seasonable at any time. How TO Silence a Pig. Anecdote of Chaules V.—When the emperor Charles Y. V7as one day walking in the neighbourhood of Vienna, full of pious considerations, engendered by the thoughts of the Dominican cloister he was about to visit, he was much annoyed by the noise of a pig, which a country youth ^yas carrying a little way before him. At length, irritated by the unmitigated noise, "Have you not learned how to quiet a pig ? " demanded the imperial traveller, tartly. " Noa," replied the ingenuous peasant, ignorant of the quality of his interrogator ;— ** noa; and I should very much like to know how to do it," changing the position - of his burthen, and giving his load a surreptitious pinch of the ear, which immediately altered the tone and volume of his complaining. "Why, take the pig by the tail," said the emperor, "and you will see how quiet he will become." Struck by the novelty of the suggestion, the countryman at once dangled his noisy companion by the tail, and soon discovered that, under the partial congestion caused by it3 inverted position, the pig had indeed become silent; when, looldng with admiratioa:^ on his august adviser, he exclaimed,— " Ab, you must have learned the trade much longer than I, for you understand it a great deal better." PBIED HAM AND EGGS (a Breakfast Dish). 813. Ingeedients.—Ham; eggs. I\fode,—Cut the ham into slices, and take care that they are of the same thickness in every part. Cut off the rind, and if the ham should be particularly hard and salt, it will be found an improvement to soak it for about 10 minutes in hot water, and then dry it in a cloth.. Put it into a cold frying-pan, set it over the fire, and turn the slices 3 or 4 times whilst they are cooking. When done, place them on a dish, which should be kept hot in front of the fire during the time the eggs are being poached. Poach the eggs, slip them on to the slices of ham, and serve quickly. Time.—"J or 8 minutes to broil the ham.382 MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. Average cost^ Sd. to lOd. per lb. by the whole ham. Sufficient.—Allow 2 eggs and a slice of ham to each person. Seasonable at any time. J^ote.—Ham may also be toasted or broiled ; but, with the latter method, to insure its being well cooked, the fire must be beautifully clear, or it will have a smoky flavour far fi'om agreeable. POTTED HAM, that will keep Good for some time. I. 814. Ingeedients.—To 4 lbs. of lean ham allow 1 lb. of fat, 2 tea- spoonfuls of pounded mace, i nutmeg grated, rather more than i teaspoonful of cayenne, clarified lard. Mode.—Mince the ham, fat and lean together in the above propor- tion, and pound it well in a mortar, seasoning it with cayenne pepper, pounded mace, and nutmeg; put the mixture into a deep baking-dish, and bake for i hour; then press it well into a stone jar, fill up the jar with clarified lard, cover it closely, and paste over it a piece of thick paper. If well seasoned, it will keep a long time in winter, and will be found very convenient for sandwiches, &c. Time.—i hour.

IiTGEEDiENTS.—To 2 Ibs. of lean ham allow J lb. of fat, 1 tea- spoonful of pounded mace, i teaspoonful of pounded allspice, \ nutmeg, pepper to taste, clarified butter. Mode.—Cut some slices from the remains of a cold ham, mince them small, and to every 2 lbs. of lean, allow the above proportion of fat. Pound the ham in a mortar to a fine paste, with the fat, gradually add the seasoning and spices, and be very particular that all the ingredients are well mixed and the spices well pounded. Press the mixture into potting-pots, pour over clarified butter, and keep it in a cool place. Average cost for this quantity, 25. Qd, Seasonable at any time. Importance of the Boar's Head, Scottish Feuds, &c.—The boar's head, in ancient times, formed the most important dish on the table, and was invariably the first placed on the board upon Christmas-day, being preceded by a body of servitors, a flourish of trumpets, and other marks of distinction andreverence, and carried into the hall by the individual of next rank to the lord of the feast. At some of our colleges and inns of court, the serving of the boar's head on a silver platter on Christmas-day is a custom still followed ; and till very lately, a boar's head was competed for at Christmas time by the young men of a rural parish in Essex. Indeed, so highly was the grizzly boar's head regarded in former times, that it passed into a cognizance of some of the noblest familiesPOEK. 383 in the realm: thus, it was not only the crest of the Nevills and Warwicks, with their collateral houses, but it was the cognizance of Eichard III., that— " Wretched, bloody, and usurping boar. That spoil'd your summer fields and fruitful vines. Swills your warm blood like wash, and makes his trough In your embowell'd bosoms,"— and whose nature it was supposed to typify; and was universally used as a sign to taverns. The Boar's Head in Eastcheap, which, till within the last twenty-five years still stood in all its primitive quaintness, though removed to make way for the London-bridge approaches, will live vividly in the mind of every reader of Shakspeare, as the resort of the prince of Wales, Poins, and his companions, and the residence of Falstaff and his coney-catching knaves, Bardolph, Pistol, andNym; and whose sign was a boar's head, carved in stone over the door, and a smaller one in wood on each side of the doorway. The traditions and deeds of savage vengeance recorded in connection with this grim trophy of the chase are numerous in all parts of Europe. But the most remarkable connected with the subject in this country, were two events that occurred in Scotland, about the 11th and 15th centuries. A border family having been dispossessed of their castle and lands by a more powerful chief, were reduced for many years to great indigence, the expelled owner only living in the hope of wreaking a terrible vengeance, which, agreeably to the motto of his house, he was content to '* bide his time" for. The v.surper having invited a large number of his kindred to a grand hunt in his new domains, and a feast after in the great hall, returned from the chase, and discovering the feast not spread, vented his wrath in no measured terms on the heads of the tardy servitors. At length a menial approached, followed by a line of servants, and placing the boar's head on the table, the guests rushed forward to begin the meal; when, to their horror, they discovered, not a boar's but a bull's head,—a sign of death. The doors were immediately closed, and the false servants, who were the adherents of the dispossessed chief, threw off their disguise, and falHng on the usurper and his friends, butchered them and every soul in the castle belonging to the rival faction. A tribe of caterans, or mountain robbers, in the Western Highlands, having been greatly persecuted by a powerful chief of the district, waylaid :him and his retinue, put them all to the sword, and cutting off the chief's head, repaired to his castle, where they ordered the terrified wife to supply them with food and drink. To appease their savage humour, the lady gave order for their entertainment, and on returning to the hall to see her orders were complied with, discovered, in place of the boar's head that should have graced the board, her husband's bleeding head; the savage caterans, in rude derision, as a substitute for the apple or lemon usually placed between the jaws, having thrust a slice of bread in the dead man's mouth. FOR CURIira HAMS (Mons. Ude's Becipe). 8i6. In-GKEDIENTS.—For 2 hams weighing about 16 or 18 lbs. each, allow 1 lb. of moist sugar, 1 lb. of common salt, 2 oz. of saltpetre, 1 quart of good vinegar. Mode,—As soon as the pig is cold enough to be cut up, take the 2 hams and rub them well with common salt, and leave them in a large pan for 3 days. "When the salt has drawn out all the blood, drain the hams, and throw the brine away. Mix sugar, salt, and saltpetre together in the above proportion, rub the hams well with these, and put them into a vessel large enough to hold them, always keeping the salt over them. Let them remain for 3 days, then pour over them a quart of good vinegar. Turn them in the brine every day for a month, then drain them well, and rub them with bran. Have them smoked over a wood fire, and be particular that the hams are hung as high up as possible from the fire; otherwise the fat will melt, and they wiU become dry and hard.MODERN HOTJSEHOLD COOKERY. 384 Time.—To be pickled 1 montli; to be smoked 1 montL • Sufficient for 2 hams of 18 lbs. eacb. Seasonable from October to March. The Peice of a Sow in Apbica.—In one of the native states of Africa, a pig one day stole a piece of food from a child a3 it was in the act of conveying the morsel to its mouth ; upon Avhieh the robbed child cried so loud that the mother rushed out of her hovel to ascertain the cause ; and seeing the purloining pig make off munching his booty, the woman in her heat struck the grunter so smart a blow, that the surly rascal took it into liis head to go home very much indisposed, and after a certain time resolved to die,—a resolution that he accordingly put into practice ; upon v\^hich the owner instituted judicial proceedings before the Star Chamber court of his tribe, against the husband and family of the woman whose rash act had led to such results; and as the pig happened to be a soiv, in the very flower of her age, the prospective loss to the owner in unnumbered i;eems of pigs, with the expenses attending so high a tribunal, swelled the damages and ■costs to such a sum, that it was found impossible to pay them. And ag, in the barbarous justice existing among these rude people, every member of a family is equally liable as the individual who committed the -wrong, the father, mother, children, relatives,—an entire community, to the number of fhirty-two souls, were sold as slaves, and a fearful sum of human misery perpetrated, to pay the value of a thieving old sow. TO SALT TWO HAMS, about 12 or 15 lbs. each. 817. Ii^GEEDiENTS.—2 Ibs. of troacle, J lb. of saltpetre, 1 lb. of bay-salt, 2 pounds of common salt. Ifode.—Two days before they are put into pickle, rub the hams well with salt, to draw away all slime and blood. Throw what comes from them away, and then rub them with treacle, saltpetre, and salt. Lay them in a deep pan, and let them remain one day; boil the above proportion of treacle, saltpetre, bay-salt, and common salt for | hour, and pour this pickle boiling* hot over the hams: there should be sufficient of it to cover them. For a day or two rub them well with it; afterwards they will only require turning. They ought to remain in this pickle for 3 weeks or a month, and then be sent to be smoked, which will take nearly or quite a month to do. An ox-tongue pickled in this way is most excellent, to be eaten either green or smoked. Time.—To remain in the pickle 3 weeks or a month; to be smoked about a month. Seasonable from October to March. TO CUBE SWEET HAMS IN THE WESTMOBELAND WAY. 818. Ingeedients.—3 lbs. of common salt, 3 lbs. of coarse sugar, 1 lb. of bay-salt, 3 quarts of strong beer.

Put the above ingredients into a saucepan, and boil for J hour; pour over the hams, and let them remain a month in the pickle. Eub and turn them every day, but do not take them out of the piclding-pan; and have them smoked for a month. Time.—lio be pickled 1 month ; to be smoked 1 month. Seasonable from October to March. •385 PORK. TO PICKLE HAMS (Suffolk Becipe). 819.

Novel way op Recovering- a Stolen- Pig.—It is a well-Irnown fact, that in Ireland the pig is, in everi/^ respect, a domesticated animal, sharing often both the bed and tha board of the family, and making an outer ring to the domestic circle, as, seated round the pot of potatoes, they partake of the midday meal called dinner. An Irishman upon one occasion having lost an interesting member of his household, in the form of a promising young porker, consulted his priest on the occasion, and having hinted at the person he suspected of purloining the *' illegant slip of a pig," he was advised to take no further notice of the matter, but leave the issue to his spiritual adviser. Next Sunday his reverence, after mass, came to the front of the altar-rails, and looking very hard at the supposed culprit, exclaimed, *• Who stole Pat Doolan's pig ? " To this inquiry there was of course no answer;—the priest did not expect there would be auj. The following Sunday the same query was propounded a little stronger—" Who of you was it, I say, who stole poor Pat Doolan's pig?" It now became evident that the culprit was a hardened sinner; so on the third Sunday, instead of repeating the unsatisfactory inquiry, the priest, after, as usual, eyeing the obdurate offender, said, in a tone of pious sorrow, ''Mike Eegan, Mike Rega,n, you treat me with contempt!" That night, when the family was all asleep, the latch of the door was noiselessly lifted, and the illegant slip of a pig" cautiously slipped into the cabin. TO SMOKB HAMS AND irISH AT HOMS. 820. Take an old hogshead, stop up all the crevices, and fix a place to put a cross-stick near the bottom, to hang the articles to be smoked on. Next, in the side, cut a hole near the top, to introduce an iron pan filled with sawdust and small pieces of green wood. Having turned the tub upside down, hang the articles upon the cross-stick, introduce the iron pan in the opening, and place a piece of red-hot iron in the pan, cover it with sawdust, and all will be complete. Let a large ham remain 40 hours, and keep up a good smoke. TO CUBB BACOH OB HAMS IN THE DSVOISTSHIBB WAIT, 821. Inghedients.—To every 14 lbs. of meat, allow 2 oz. of salt- petre, 2 oz. of salt prunella, 1 lb. of common salt. For the pickle, 3 gallons of water, 5 lbs. of common salt, 7 lbs. of coarse sugar, 3 lbs. of bay-salt. 3fode.—Weigh the sides, hams, and cheeks, and to every 14 lbs* allow the above proportion of saltpetre, salt prunella, and common 2 c386 MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. salt. Pound and mix these together, and rub well into the meat; lay it in a stone trough or tub, rubbing it thoroughly, and turning it daily for 2 successive days. At the end of the second day, pour on it a pickle made as follows :—Put the above ingredients into a saucepan, set it on the fire, and stir frequently; remove all the scum, allow it to boil for J hour, and pour it hot over the meat. Let the hams, &c., be well rubbed and turned daily; if the meat is small, a fortnight will be sufficient for the sides and shoulders to remain in the pickle, and the hams 3 weeks; if from 30 lbs. and upwards, 3 weeks will be required for the sides, &c., and from 4 to 5 weeks for the hams. On taking the pieces out, let them drain for an hour, cover with dry sawdust, and smoke from a fortnight to 3 weeks. Boil and carefully skim the pickle after using, and it will keep good, closely corked, for 2 years. When boil- ing it for use, add about 2 lbs. of common salt, and the same of treacle, to allow for waste. Tongues are excellent put into this pickle cold, having been first rubbed well with saltpetre and salt, and allowed to remain 24 hours, not forgetting to make a deep incision under the thick part of the tongue, so as to allow the pickle to penetrate more readily. A fortnight or 3 weeks, according to the size of the tongue, will be sufiicient. Time,—Small meat to remain in the pickle a fortnight, hams S weeks; to be smoked from a fortnight to 3 weeks. The following is from Morton's Cyclopsedia of Agriculture/' and will be found fully worthy of the Ligh character of that publication. CURING or HAMS AND BACON. 822 . The carcass of the hog, after hanging over-night to cool, is laid on a strong ■ bench or stool, and the head is separated from the body at the neck, close behind the ears; the feet and also the internal fat are removed. The carcass is next divided into two sides in the following manner:—The ribs are divided about an inch from the spine on each side, and the spine, with the ends of the ribs attached, together with the internal flesh between it and the kidneys, and also the flesh above it, throughout the whole length of the sides, are removed. The portion of the carcass thus cut out is in the form of a wedge—the breadth ot the interior consisting of the breadth of the spine, and about an inch of the ribs on each side, being diminished to about half an inch at the exterior or skin along the back. The breast-bone, and also the first anterior rib, are also dissected from the side. Sometimes the whole of the ribs are removed; but this, for reasons afterwards to be noticed, is a very bad practice. When the hams are cured separately from the sides, which is generally the case, they are cut out so as to include the hock-bone, in a similar manner to the London mode of cutting a haunch of mutton. The carcass of the hog thus cut up is redely for being salted, which process, in large curing establishments, is generally asPORK. 887 follows. The skin side of the pork is rubbed over with a mixture of fifty parts by weight of salt, and one part of saltpetre in powder, and the incised parts of the ham or flitch, and the inside of the flitch covered with the same. The salted bacon, in pairs of flitches with the insides to each other, is piled one pair of flitches above another on benches slightly inclined, and furnished with spouts or troughs to convey the brine to receivers in the floor of the salting- house, to be afterwards used for pickling pork for navy purposes. In this state the bacon remains a fortnight, which is suflicient for flitches cut from hogs of a carcass weight less than 15 stone (14 lbs. to the stone). Flitches of a larger size, at the expiration of that time, are wiped dry and reversed in their place in the pile, having, at the same time, about half the first quantity of fresh, dry, common salt sprinkled over the inside and incised parts; after which they remain on the benches for another week. Hams being thicker than flitches, will require, when less than 20 lbs. weight, 3 weeks; and when above that weight, 4 weeks to remain under the above-described process. The next and last process in the preparation of bacon and hams, previous to being sent to market, is drying. This is efl'ected by hanging the flitches and hams for 2 or 3 weeks in a room heated by stoves, or in a smoke-house, in which they are exposed for the same length of time to the smoke arising from the slow com- bustion of the sawdust of oak or other hard wood. The latter mode of com- pleting the curing process has some advantages over the other, as by it the meat is subject to the action of creosote, a volatile oil produced by the combus- tion of the sawdust, which is powerfully antiseptic. The process also furnishing a thin covering of a resinous varnish, excludes the air not only from the muscle but also from the fat; thus eff'ectually preventing the meat from becoming rusted; and the principal reasons for condemning the practice of removing the ribs from the flitches of pork are, that by so doing the meat becomes unpleasantly hard and pungent in the process of salting, and by being more opposed to the action of the air, becomes sooner and more extensively rusted. Notwithstanding its superior efficacy in completing the process of curing, the flavour which smoke-drying imparts to meat is disliked by many persons, and it is therefore by no means the most general mode of drying adopted by mercantile curers. A very impure variety of i^yroligneot^s acid, or vinegar made from the destructive distillation of wood, is sometimes used, on account of the highly preservative power of the creosote which it contains, and also to impart the smoke-flavour; in which latter object, however, the coarse ' flavour of tar is given, rather than that derived from the smoke from combus- tion of wood. A considerable portion of the bacon and hams salted in Ireland is exported from that country packed amongst salt, in bales, immediately from the-salting process, without having been in any degree dried. In the process of salting above described, pork loses from eight to ten per cent, of its weight, I according to the size and quality of the meat; and a further diminution of I weight, to the extent of five to six per cent., takes place in drying during the I first fortnight after being taken out of salt; so that the total loss in weight I occasioned by the preparation of bacon and hams in a proper state for market, is not less on an average than fifteen per cent, en the v/eight of the fresh pork, 2 o 2J!JOr>ERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. Seasonahle from October to March. 3 lbs. of potatoes, pepper and salt to taste. COIiIiAHED PIG'S FACE (a Breakfast or Xiiincheon Bisli). 823. INGIIELIENTS.—I pig's face ; salt. For brine, 1 gallon of spring water, 1 lb. of common salt, f handful of cliopped juniper-berries, 6 bruised cloves, 2 bay-leaves, a few sprigs of thyme, basil, sage, J cz. of saltpetre. For forcemeat, J lb. of ham, | lb. bacon, 1 teaspoonfiil of mixed spices, pepper to taste, J ib. of lard, 1 tablespoonful of minced parsley, 6 young onions. 3Iode—Singe the head carefully, bone it without breaking the skin, and rub it well with salt. Make the brine by boiling the above ingre- dients for i hour, and letting it stand to cool. "When cold, pour it over the head, and let it steep in this for 10 days, turning and rubbing it often. Then wipe, drain, and dry it. For the forcemeat, pound the ham and bacon very finelj^, and mix with these the remaining ingredients, taking care that the whole is thoroughly incorporated. Spread this equally over the head, roll it tightly in a cloth, and bind it securely with broad tape. Put it into a saucepan with a few meat trimmings, and cover it with stock ; let it simmer gently for 4 hours, and be particular that it does not stop boiling the whole time. When quite tender, take it up, put it between 2 dishes with a heavy weight on the top, and when cold, remove the cloth and tape. It should be sent to table on a napkin, or garnished with a piece of deep white paper with a ruche at the top. Time.—4: hours. Average costj from 25. to 2s. Q>d. _ Tee lYiLD and Domestic Hog.—The domestic hog is the descendant of a race long since banished from this island; and it is remarkable, that while the tamed animal has been and is kept under surveillance, the wild type whence this race sprung, has maintained itself ill its ancient fi'oedom, the fierce denizen of the forest, and one of the renowned beasts of the chase. Whatever doubt may exist as to the true origin of the dog, the horse, the ox, and others, or as to whether their origina.1 race is j'et extant or not, these doubts do not apply to the domestic hog. Its wild source still exists, and is universally recognized: like the wolf, however, it has been expelled from our island; but, like that animal, it still roams through the vast wooded tracts of Europe and Asia. TO DEESB Pia'S FKT (a Savoury Dish). 324. Ik-geediek"ts,—Ij lb. of pig's fry, 2 onions, a few snge-Ieaves, Mode.—Piit the lean fry at the bottom of a pie-dish, sprinkle over it some rnineed sage and onion, and a seasoning of pepper and salt; slice the potatoes : put a layer of these on the seasoning, then the fat fry, then more seasoning, and a layer of potatoes at the top. Fill the dish, with boiling water, and bake for 2 hours, or rather longer. pig's tace.339 PORK. Tnne.—Reit'hev more than 2 hours. Average cost, Qd. per lb* Sufficient for 3 or 4 persons. Seasonahle from October to March. TO MELT LABD. 825. Melt the inner fat of the pig, by putting it in a stone jar, and placing this in a saucepan of boiling water, previously stripping ofi: the skin. Let it simmer gently over a bright fire, and as it melts, pour it carefully from the sediment. Put it into small jars or bladders for use, and keep it in a cool place. The flead or inside fat of the pig, before it is melted, makes exceedingly light crust, and is particularly wholesome. It may be preserved a length of time by salting it well, and occasionally changing the brine. When wanted for use, wash and wipe it, and it will answer for making into paste as well as fresh lard. Average cost, lOd, per lb. BOILED LEa OF POBSI, 826. IiSTGEEDiENTS.—Leg of pork; salt. Mode,—For boiling, choose a small, compact, weli-filled leg, and rub it well with salt; let it remain in pickle for a week or ten days, turniug and rubbing it every day. An hour before dressing it, put it into cold water for an hour, which improves the colour. If the pork is purchased ready salted, ascertain how long the meat has been in pickle, and soak it accordingly. Put it into a boiling-pot, with suffi- cient cold water to cover it; let it gradually come to a boil, and remove the scum as it rises. Simmer it very gently until tender, and do not allow it to boil fast, or the knuckle will fall to pieces before the middle of the leg is done. Carrots, turnips, or parsnips may be boiled with the pork, some of which should be laid round the dish as a garnish, and a well-made pease-pudding is an indispensable accompaniment. Time.—K leg of pork weighing 8 lbs., 3 hours after the water boils, and to be simmered very gently. Average cost, 9d, per lb. Sufficient for 7 or 8 persons. Seasonahle from September to March. Note.—The liquor in which a leg of pork has been boiled, makes excellent pea-soup. Antiquity the Hog.—The hog has survived changes which have swept muUifcudes of pachydermatous animals from the surface of our eai*th. It still presents the samo characteristics, both physical and moral, which the earliest writers, whether sacred or pro- fane, have faithfully delineated. Although the domestic has been more or less modified by long culture, yet the wild species remains unaltered, insomuch that the fossil relics may be ideatilied with the bones of their existing descendants.MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. 390 BOAST GBISKIN OP PORK. 8-27. Ikgeedients.—Pork; a little powdered sage. 3Iode.—As this joint frequently comes to table hard and dry, particu- lar care should be taken that it is well basted. Put it down to a bright SPABE-KIB OP POEK. fire, and flour it. About 10 minutes before taking it up, sprinkle over some powdered sage; make a little gravy in the dripping-pan, strain it over the meat, and serve with a tureen of apple sauce. This joint will be done in far less time than when the skin is left on, conse- quently, should have the greatest attention that it be not dried up. Time—Qih'km of pork weighing 6 lbs., if hour. Average cost, Id. per lb. Sufficient for 5 or 6 persons. Seasonahle from September to March. Note.—A siDare-rib of pork is roasted in the same manner as above, and would ti\kQ 1-5 hour for one weighing about 6 lbs. LARDma. 828. Ikgeedients.—Bacon and larding-needle. Mode.—B^QOTL for larding should be firm and fat, and ought to be cured without any saltpetre, as this reddens white meats. Lay it on a table, the rinds downwards; trim oif any rusty part, and cut it into slices of an equal thickness. Place the slices one on the top of ano- ther, and cut them evenly into nar- row strips, so arranging it that every piece of bacon is of the same size. Bacon for fricandeaux, poultry, and game, should be about 2 inches in length, and rather more than one-eighth of an inch in width. If for larding fillets of beef or loin of veal, the pieces of bacon must be thicker. The following re- cipe of Soyer is, we think, very explicit; and any cook, by following the directions here given, may be able to lard, if not well, sufficiently for general use. "Have the fricandeau trimmed, lay it, lengthwise, upon a clean napkin across your hand, forming a kind of bridge with your thumb BACON rOS LAKDING, AliD LAEDING-NEEDLE.POIIK. B&l at the part you are about to commence at; tlien with the point of the larding-needle make three distinct lines across, I inch apart; run the needle into the third line, at the further side of the fricandeau, and bring- it out at the first, placing one of the lardoons in it; draw the needle through, leaving out J inch of the bacon at each line ; proceed thus to the end of the row; then make another line, i inch distant, stick in another row of lardoons, bringing them out at the second line, leaving the ends of the bacon out all the same length; make the next row again at the same distance, bringing the ends out between the lardoons of the first row, proceeding in this manner until the whole jsurface is larded in chequered rows. Everything else is larded in a similar way; and, in the case of poultry, hold the breast over a charcoal fire for one minute, or dip it into boiling water, in order to make the flesh firm."

HIND LOIN 03? POKE. crackling, which would harden before the meat would be heated through, were it placed too near. If very lean, it should be rubbed over with a little salad oil, and kept well basted all the time it is at the fire. Pork should be very thoroughly cooked, but not dry ; and be careful never to send it to table the least underdone, as nothing is more unwholesome and disagreeable than underdressed white meats. Serve with apple sauce, No. 363, and a little gravy made in the dripping-pan. A stuffing of sage and onion may be made separately, and baked in a flat dish t this method is better than putting it in the meat, as many persons have so great an objection to the flavour. Time.~K loin of pork weighing 5 lbs., about 2 hours : allow more time should it be very fat. Average cost, ^d. per lb. Sufficient for 5 or 6 persons. Seasonable from September to March. Fossil Remains of the Hog.—In British strata, the oldest fossil remains of the ho» which Professor Owen states that he has examined, were from fissures in the red crag i (probably miocene) of Newbourne, near Woodbridge, Suffolk. " They were associated892 MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. with teetli of an extinct felis about the size of a leopard, with those of a bear, and with remains of a large cervus. These mammalian remains were found with the ordinary fossils of the red crag: they had undergone the same process of trituration, and were impregnated with the same colouring matter as the associated bones and teeth of fishes acknowledged to be derived from the regular strata of the red crag. These mammali- ferous beds have been proved by Mr. Lyell to be older than the lluvio-marine, or Norwich crag, in which remains of the mastodon, rhinoceros, and horse have been discovered j an(f still older than the fresh-water pleistocene deposits, from which the remains of the mammoth, rhinoceros, &c. are obtained in such abundance. I have met," says the professor, in addition, "with some satisfactory instances of the association of fossil remains of a species of hog with those of the mammoth, in the newer pliocene fresh« ■waterformations of England." TO DBY PIGS' CHEEKS. 830. Ikgredients.—Salt, i oz. of saltpetre, 2 oz. of bay-salt, 4 cz. of coarse sugar. 3fode—C\it out the snotit, remove the brains, and split the head, taking ofp the upper bone to make the jovv^l a good shape ; rub it well with salt; next day take away the brine, and salt it again the fol- lowing day; cover the head with saltpetre, bay-salt, and coarse sugar, in the above proportion, adding a little common salt. Let the head be often turned, and when it has been in the pickle for 10 days, smoke it for a week or rather longer. Time.—To remain in the pickle 10 days; to be smoked 1 week. Seasonable.—Should be made from September to March. Note.—A pig's cheek, or Eatli chap, will take about 2 hours after the water boils. PIG'S IjIVER (a Savoury and Economical Dish). 831. Ingeedients.—The liver and lights of a pig, 6 or 7 slices of bacon, potatoes, 1 large bunch of parsley, 2 onions, 2 sage-leaves, pepper and salt to taste, a little broth or water. Ilode—Slide the liver and lights, and wash these perfectly clean, and parboil the potatoes; mince the parsley and sage, and chop the onion rather small. Put the meat, potatoes, and bacon into a deep tin dish, in alternate layers, with a sprinkling of the herbs, and a seasoning of pepper and salt between each ; pour on a little water or broth, and bake in a moderatelj-heated oven for 2 hours. Time.—2 hours. Average cost^ Is. Qd. Si(fficie7it for 6 or 7 persons. Seasonable from September to March. PIG'S PETTITOES. 832. Ikgbedients.—A thin slice of bacon, 1 onion, i blade of mace, 6 peppercorns, 3 or 4 sprigs of thyme, 1 pint of gravy, pepper and salt to taste, thickening of butter and flour.PORK. 893 3Iode.—Put the liver, heart, and pettitoes into a stewpan with the bacon, mace, peppercorns, thyme, onion, and gravy, and simmer these gently for \ hour; then take out the heart and liver, and mince them very fine. Keep stewing the feet until quite tender, which will be in from 20 minutes to i hour, reckoning from the time that they boiled up first; then put back the minced liver, thicken the gravy with a little butter and flour, season with pepper and salt, and simmer over a gentle fire for 5 minutes, occasionally stirring the contents. Dish the mince, split the feet, and arrange them round alternately with sippets of toasted bread, and pour the gravy in the middle. Time.—Altogether 40 minutes. Sufficient for 3 or 4 persons. Seasonable from September to March. TO PICKLB POIiK. 833. Ingeedients.—i lb. of saltpetre; salt. 3fode.—As pork does not keep long without being salted, cut it into pieces of a suitable size as soon as the pig is cold. Rub the pieces of pork well with salt, and put them into a pan with a sprinkling of it between each piece : as it melts on the top, strew on more. Lay a coarse cloth over the pan, a board over that, and a weight on the board, to keep the pork down in the brine. If excluded from the air, it will continue good for nearly 2 years. Average cost^ lOd per lb. for the prime parts. Seasonable.—The best time for pickling meat is late in the autumn. The Universality op the Hog. — A singular circumstance in the domestic history of the hog, is the extent of its distribution over the surface of the earth; being found even in insulated places, where the inhabitants are semi-barbarous, and where the wild species is entirely unknown. The South-Sea islands, for example, were found on their discovery to be well stocked with a small black hog; and the traditionary belief of the people was that these animals were coeval with the origin of themselves. Yet they possessed no knowledge of the wild boar, or any other animal of the hog kind, from which the domestic breed might be supposed to be derived. In these islands the hog is the principal quadruped, and the fruit of the bread-tree is its principal foody although it is also fed with yams, eddoes, and other vegetables. This nutritious diet, which it has in great abundance, is, according to Foster, the reason of its flesh being so delicious, so full of juice, and so rich in fat, which is not less delicate to the taste than the finest butter. TO BOIL PICKLED PORK. 834. Ingredients.—Pork ; water. Mode.—Should, the pork be very salt, let it remain in water about 2 hours before it is dressed; put it into a saucepan with sufficient cold water to cover it, let it gradually come to a boil, then gently simmer until quite tender. Allow ample time for it to cook, as nothing is more disagreeable than underdone pork, and when boiled fast, the meat becomes hard. This is sometimes served with boiled poultry894 MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. and roast veal, instead of bacon : when tender, and not over salt, it will be found equally good. Time.—K piece of pickled pork weighing 2 lbs., Ij hour; 4 lbs., rather more than 2 hours. Average cost, lOd. per lb. for the primest parts. Seasonable at any time. The Aktiqijity oi? the Hog.—By vrliat nation and in what period the Log was reclaiiDed, is iuvolved in the deepest obscurity. So far back as we have any records of history, we find notices of this animal, and of its flesh being used as the food of man. By some nations, however, its llesh was denounced as unclean, and therefore prohibited to be used, whilst by others it was esteemed as a great delicacy. By the Mosaic law it was foi'bidden to be eaten by the Jews, and the Mahometans hold it in utter abhor- rence. Dr. Kitto, however, says that there does not appear to be any reason in the law of Moses why the hog should be held in such peculiar abomination. There seems nothing to have prevented the Jews, if they had been so inclined, to rear pigs for sale, or for the use of the land. In the Talmud there are some indications that this was actually done; and it was, probably, for such purposes that the herds of swine mentioned in the New Testament w^ere kept, although it is usual to consider that they were kept by the foreign settlers in the land. Indeed, the story which accounts for the peculiar aversion of the Hebrews to the hog, assumes that it did not originate until about 130 years before Christ, and that, previously, some Jews were in the habit of rearing hogs for the purposes indicated. FOEK PISS (Warwickshire Hecipe). 835. Ingredients.—For the crust, 5 lbs. of lard to 14 lbs. of flour, milk, and water. For filling the pies, to every 3 lbs. of meat allow 1 oz. of salt, 2j oz. of pepper, a small quantity of cayenne, 1 pint of water. Hocle.—Ruh into the flour a portion of the lard; the remainder put with sufficient milk and v/ater to mix the crust, and boil this gently for J hour. Pour it boiling on the flour, and knead and beat it till perfectly smooth. 'Now raise the crust in either a round or oval form, cut up the pork into pieces the size of a nut, season it in the above proportion, and press it compactly into the pie, in alternate layers of fat and lean, and pour in a small quantity of water; lay on the lid, cut the edges smoothly round, and pinch them together. Bake in a brick oven, which should be slow, as the meat is very solid. Yery frequently, the inexperienced cook finds much difficulty in raising the crust. She should bear in mind that it must not be allowed to get cold, or it will fall immediately: to prevent this, the operation should be performed as near the fire as possible. As considerable dexterity and expertness are necessary to raise the crust v/ith the hand only, a glass bottle or small jar may be placed in the middle of the paste, and the crust moulded on this; but be particular that it is kept warm the whole time. Su:^cient.~The proportions for 1 pie are 1 lb. of flour and 3 lbs. of meat. Seasonable from September to March.FORK. 395 The Flesh of Swine in Hot Climates.—It is observed by M. Sonini, tliat the flesh of swine, in hot climates, is considered unwholesome, and therefore may account for its proscription by the legislators and priests of the East. In Egypt, Syria, and even the southern parts of Greece, although both white and dalicate, it is so flabby and surcharged with fat, that it disagrees with the strongest stomachs. Abstinence from it in general was, therefore, indispensable to health uncler the burning suns of Egypt and Arabia. The Egyptians were permitted to eat it only once a year,—on the feast of the moon; and then they sacrificed a number of these animals to that planet. At other seasons, should any one even touch a hog, he was obliged immediately to plunge into the river JS^ile, as he stood, with his clothes on, in order to purify himself from the supposed contamination he had contracted by the touch. LITTLE EAISEB POBK PIES. 636. INGREDIENTS.--2 Ibs. of llour, i lb. of butter, i lb. of mutton suet, salt and wliite pepper to taste, 4 lbs. of the neck of pork, 1 dessertspoonful of powdered sage. Ifode.—Well dry the flour, mince the suet, and put these with the butter into a saucepan, to be made hot, and add a little salt. When melted, mix it up into a stiff paste, and put it before the fire with a cloth over it until ready to make up ; chop the pork into small pieces, season it with white pepper, salt, and powdered sage ; divide the paste into rather small pieces, raise it in a round or oval form, fill with the meat, and bake in a brick oven. These pies will require a fiercer oven than those in the preceding recipe, as they are made so much smaller, and consequently do not require so soaking a heat. Ti7ne.—If made small, about l| hour. Seasonable from September to March. Swineherds of Antiquity.—From the prejudice against the nog among the ancients, those who tended them formed an isolated class, and were esteemed as the outcasts of society. However much the flesh of the animal was esteemed by the Greeks and llomans, yet the swineherd is not mentioned by either the classic writers or the poets who, in ancient Greece and Eome, painted rural life. We have no descriptions of gods or heroes descending to the occupation of keeping swine. The swineherd is never introduced into the idyls of Theocritus, nor has Virgil admitted him into his eclogues. The Eumseus of Homer is the only exception that we have of a swineherd meeting with favour in the eyes of a poet of antiquity. This may be accounted for, on the supposition that the prejudices of the Egyptians relative to this class of men, extended to both Greece and Italy, and imparted a bias to popular opinion. TO MAKE SAUSAGES. (Author's Oxford Recipe.) 837. Ii^-GEEDiENTS.—1 lb. of pork, fat and lean, without skin or gristle; 1 lb. of lean veal, 1 lb. of beef suet, 4 lb. of bread crumbs, the rind of i lemon, 1 small nutmeg, 6 sage-leaves, 1 teaspoonful of pepper, 2 teaspoonfuls of salt, i teaspoonful of savory, ^ teaspoonful of marjoram. JfbcZe.—Chop the pork, veal, and suet finely together, add the bread crumbs, lemon-peel (which should be well minced), and a small nutmeg grated. Wash and chop the sage-leaves very finely; add these396 MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY, with the remaining ingredients to the sausage-meat, and when thoroughly'mixed, either put the meat into skins, or, when wanted for table, form it into little cakes, which should be floured and fried. Average cost, for this quantity, 2s. Qd. Sufficient for about 30 moderate-sized sausages. Seaso7iable from October to March. The Hog inr England.—rrom time immemorial, in England, this animal has been esteemed as of the highest importance. In the Anglo-Saxon period, vast herds of swine v/ere tended by men, who watched over their safety, and who collected them under shelter at night. At that time, the flesh of the animal was the staple article of con- sumption in every family, and a large portion of the wealth of the rich freemen of the country consisted of these animals. Hence it was common to make bequests of swine, with lands for their support; and to these were attached rights and privileges in con- nection with their feeding, and the extent of woodland to be occupied by a given number was granted in accordance with established rules. This is proved by an ancient Saxon grant, quoted by Sharon Turner, in his History of the Anglo-Saxons," where the right of pasturage is conveyed in a deed by the follovfing Avords:—'' I give food for seventy swine in that woody allotmont which the countrymen call Wolferdinlegh," FBIED SAUSAGES. 838. Ingredients.—Sausages ; a small piece of butter. Jfof/e.—Prick the sausages with a fork (this prevents them from bursting), and put them into a frying-pan with a small piece of butter. Keep moving the pan about, and turn the sausages 3 or 4 times. In from 10 to 12 minutes they will be sufficiently cooked, unless they are very large, when a little more time should be allowed for them. Dish them with or without a piece of toast under them, and serve very hot. In some counties, sausages are boiled and served on toast. They should be plunged into boiling water, and simmered for about 10 or 12 minutes. Time.—10 to 12 minutes. Average cost, IQd, per lb. Seasonable.—Good from September to March. Hote.—Sometimes, in close warm weather, sausages very soon turn sour; to prevent this, put them in the oven for a few minutes with a small piece of butter to keep them moist. When wanted for table, they will not require so long frying as uncooked sausages. The Saxon Swineherd.—The men employed in herdiug swine during the Anglo- Saxon i^eriod of our history were, in general, thralls or born slaves of the soil, who were assisted by powerful dogs, capable even of singly contending with the wolf until his master came wdth his spear to the rescue. In the " Ivanhoe" of Sir Walter Scott, wc have an admirable picture, in the character of Gurth, an Anglo-Sason swineherd, as we also have c)f his master, a large lauded proprietor, a great portion of whose wealth consisted of swine, and whose rude but plentiful board was liberally supphed with the flesh. SAUSAGE-MEAT CAKES. 839. Ikgeedients.—-To every lb. of lean pork, add % lb. of fat bacon,397 PORK, 4 oz. of salt, 1 saltspoonful of pepper, I teaspoonful of grated nutmeg*, 1 teaspoonful of minced parsley. 3fode.—'RemoYe from the pork all skin, gristle, and bone, and chop it finely with the bacon ; add the remaining ingredients, and carefully mix altogether. Pound it well in a mortar, make it into convenient- sized cakes, flour these, and fry them a nice brown for about 10 minutes. This is a very simple method of making sausage-meat, and on trial vnll prove very good, its great recommendation being, that it is so easily made. 2zme.—10 minutes. Seasonable from September to March. TO SCAIiD A STJCKIHG-Pia. 840. Put the pig into cold water directly it is killed ; let it remain for a few minutes, then immerse it in a large pan of boiling v/ater for 2 minutes. Take it out, lay it on a table, and pull off the hair as quickly as possible. When the skin looks clean, make a slit down the belly, take out the entrails, well clean the nostrils and ears, wash the pig in cold water, and wipe it thoroughly dry. Take off the feet at the first joint, and loosen and leave sufficient skin to turn neatly over. If not to be dressed immediately, fold it in a wet cloth to keep it from the air. The LriRNED Pig.—That the pig is capable of education, is a fact long known to the world; and though, like the ass, naturally stubborn and obstinate, that he is equally amenable with other animals to caresses and kindness, has been shown from very remote time ; the best riioderu evidence of his docility, however, is the instance of the learned pig, first exhibited about a century since, but which has been continued down to our own time by repeated instances of an animal who will put together all the letters or ligures that compose the day, month, hour, and date of the exhibition, besides many other unquestioned evidences of memor}'-. The instance already given of breaking a sow into a pointer, till she became more stanch even than the dog itself, though surprising, is far less wonderful than that evidence of education where so' generally obtuse an animal may be taught not only to spell; but couple figures and give dates correctly. BOAST SUCKmG-PIQ. 841. Ingeedients.—-Pig, 6 oz. of bread crumbs, 16 sage-leaves, pepper and salt to taste, a piece of butter the size of an egg, salad oil or butter to baste with, about 4 pint of gravy, 1 tablespoonful of lemon-juice. Irlode.—A sucking-pig, to be eaten in perfection, should not be more than three wrecks old, and should be dressed the same day that it is killed. After preparing the pig for cooking, as in the preceding recipe, stuff it with finely-grated bread crumbs, minced sage, pepper, salt, and a piece of butter the size of an egg, all of which should be well mixed together, and put into the body of the pig. Sew up the398 MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. slit neatly, and truss the legs back, to allow the inside to be roasted, and the under part to be crisp. Put the pig down to a bright clear fire, not too near, and let it lay till thoroughly dry ; then have ready some butter tied up in a piece of thin cloth, and rub the pig with this in every part. Keep it well rubbed with the butter the whole of the time it is roasting, and do not allow the crackling to become blistered or burnt. When half-done, hang a pig-iron before the middle part (if this is not obtainable, use a flat iron), to prevent its being scorched and dried up before the ends are done. Before it is taken from the fire, cut off the head, and part that and the body down the middle. Chop the brains and mix them with the stuffing; add i pint of good gravy» a tablespoonful of lemon-juice, and the gravy that flowed from the pig ; put a little of this on the dish with the pig, and the remainder send to table in a tureen. Place the pig back to back in the dish, with one half of the head on each side, and one of the ears at each end, and send it to table as hot as possible. Instead of butter, many cooks take salad oil for basting, which makes the crackling crisp ; and as this is one of the principal things to be considered, perhaps it is desirable to use it; but be particular that it is very pure, or it will impart an un- pleasant flavour to the meat. The brains and stuffing may be stirred into a tureen of melted butter instead of gravy, when the latter is not liked. Apple sauce and the old-fashioned currant sauce are not yet quite obsolete as an accompaniment to roast pig. Time.—1^ to 2 hours for a small pig. Average costy 5s, to 6s, Sufficient for 9 or 10 persons. Seasonable from September to February. How Roast Pig was discovered.—Charles Lamb, who, in the early part of this century, delighted the reading public by his quaint prose sketches, written under the title of_ "Essays of Elia," has, in his own quiet humorous way, devoted one paper to the subject of Roast Pig, and more especially to that luxurious and toothsome dainty fenown as " CRACKLiiirG j" and shows, in a manner peculiarly his own, hoiv cr adding first came into the ivorld. According to this erudite authority, man in the golden age, or at all events the primitive age, eat his pork and bacon raw, as, indeed, he did his beef and mutton; unless, as Hudibras tells us, he was an epicure, when he used to make a saddle of his saddle of mutton, and after spreading it on his horse's back, and riding on it for a few hours till thoroughly warmed, he sat down to the luxury of a dish cooked to a turn. At the epoch of the story, however, a citizen of some Scythian community had the misfortune to have his hut, or that portion of it containing his live stock of pigs, burnt down. In going over the debris on the following day, and picking out all the available salvage, the proprietor touched something unusually or unexpectedly hot, which caused him to shake Ms hand with great energy, and clap the tips of his sufi'ering fingers to his mouth. The act was simple and natural, but the result was wonderful. He rolled his eyes in ecstatic pleasure, his frame distcn ied, and, conscious of a celestial odour, his nostrils widened, and, while drawing in deep inspirations of the ravishing perfume, he sucked his fingers with a gusto he had never, in his most hungry moments, conceived. Clearing away the EOAST SUCKING-Pia.899 PORK CARVING. rubbish from beneath liim, he at last brought to view the carcase of one of his pigg, roasted to death. Stooping down to examine this curious object, and touching its body, a fragment of the burnt skin was detached, which, with a sort of superstitious dread, he at length, and in a spirit of philosophical inquiry, put into his mouth. Ye gods! the felicity he then enjoyed, no pen can chronicle! Then it was that he—the world—first tasted cmcHing. Like a miser with his gold, the Scythian hid his treasure from the Erying eyes of the world, and feasted, in secret, more sumptuously than the gods. When e had eaten up all his pig, the poor man fell into a melancholy; he refused the most tempting steak, though cooked on the horse's back, and turned every half-hour after his own favourite recipe ; he fell, in fact, from his appetite, and was reduced to a shadow, till, unable longer to endure the torments of memory he hourly suffered, he rose one night and secretly set fire to his hut, and once more was restored to flesh and manhood. Finding it impossible to live in future without roast-pig, he set fire to his house every time his larder became empty; till at last his neighbours, scandahzedby the frequency of these incendiary acts, brought his conduct before the supreme council of the nation. To avert the penalty that awaited him, he brought his judges to the smouldering ruins, and discovering the secret, invited them to eat; which having done, with tears of gratitude, the august synod embraced him, and, with an overflowing feeling of ecstasy, dedicated a statue to the memory of the man who first instituted roast pork. POEK CARVING. SUCKINQ-PIG. 842. A sucking-pig seems, at first siglit, ratlier an elaborate dish, or rather animal, to carve ; but by carefully mastering the details of the business, every difficulty will vanish; and if a partial failure be at first made, yet all embarrassment will quickly disappear on a second trial. A sucking-pig is usually sent to table in the manner shown in the engraving (and also in coloured plate S), and the first point to be attended to is to separate the shoulder from the carcase, by carrying the knife quickly and neatly round the circular line, as shown by the figures 1, 2, 3;—the shoulder will then easily come away. The next step is to take off the leg; and this is done in the same way, by cutting round this joint in. the direction shown by the figures 1, 2, 3, in the same way as the ; shoulder. The ribs then stand fairly open to the knife, which should be carried down in the direction of the line 4 to 5 ; and two or three helpings will dispose of these. The other half of the pig is served, of course, in the same manner. Difierent parts of the pig are variously esteemed; some preferring the flesh of the neck; others, the ribs; and others, again, the shoulders. The truth is, the whole of a sucking-pig is delicious, delicate eating; but, in carving it, the host should consult the various tastes and fancies of his guests, keeping I the IcTger joints, generally, for the gentlemen of the party.400 MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. H A M. 843. In cutting a ham, tlie carver must be guided according as he , desires to practise economy, or have, at once, fine slices out of the prime part. Under the first supposition, he will commence at the knuckle end, and cut ofit • thin slices towards the thick part of the ham. To reach the choicer portion, the knife, which must be very sharp and thin, should be carried quite down to the bone, in the direction of the line 1 to 2. The slices ishould be thin and even, and always cut down to the bone. There are some who like to carve a ham by cutting a hole at the top, and then slicing pieces ofi" inside the hole, gradually enlarging the circle; but we think this a plan not to be recommended. A ham, wlien hot, is usually sent to table with a paper ruffle round the kniickle; when cold, it is served in the manner shown by coloured plate P. LEG o¥ pchk:. 844. This joint, which is such a favourite one with many people, is easy to carve. The knife should be carried sharply down to the bone, clean through the crackling, in the direction of the line 1 to 2. Sage and onion and apple sauce are usually sent to table with this dish,—sometimes the leg of pork is stujQfed,—and the guests should be asked if they will have either or both. A frequent plan, and we think a good one, is now pur- sued, of sending sage and onion to table separately from the joint, as it is not everybody to whom the flavour of this stuffing is agreeable. yote.—The other dishes of pork do not call for any special remarks as to their carving or helping. I- HAM.CHAPTER XYIII. GEJSrERAL OBSEKVATIONS ON THE CALF. 845. Any Remarks made on the Calf or the Lamb must naturally be in a measure supplementary to the more copious observations made on the parent stock of either. As the calf, at least as far as it is identified with veal, is destined to die young,—to be, indeed, cut ofif in its comparative infancy,—it may, at first sight, appear of little or no consequence to inquire to what particular variety, or breed of the general stock, his sire or dam may belong. The great art, however, in the modern science of husbandry has been to obtain an animal that shall not only have the utmost beauty of form of which the species is capable, but, at the same time, a constitution free from all taint, a frame that shall rapidly attain bulk and stature, and a disposition so kindly that every quantum of food it takes shall, without drawback or procrastination, be eliminated into fat and muscle. The breed, then, is of very considerable consequence in determining, not only the quality of the meat to the consumer, but its commercial value to the breeder and butcher. 846. Under the Artificial System adopted in the rearing of domestic cattle, and stock in general, to gratify the arbitrary mandates of luxury and fashion, we can have veal, like lamb, at all seasons in the market, though tho usual time in the metropolis for veal to make its appearance is about tho beginning of February. 2l>MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. 402 847. The Cow goes with Young for Nine Months, and the affection and solicitude she evinces for her offspring is more human in its tenderness and intensity than is displayed by any other animal; and her distress when she hears its bleating, and is not allowed to reach it with her distended udders, is often painful to witness, and when the calf has died, or been accidentally killed, her grief frequently makes her refuse to give down her milk. At such times, the breeder has adopted the expedient of flaying the dead carcase, and, distending the skin with hay, lays the effigy before her, and then taking advan- tage of her solicitude, milks her while she is caressing the skin with her tongue, 848. In a State op Nature, the cow, like the deer, hides her young in the tall ferns and brakes, and the most secret places ; and only at stated times, twice or thrice a day, quits the herd, and, hastening to the secret cover, gives suck to her calf, and with the same circumspection returns to the com- munity. 849. In some Countries, to please the epicurean taste-of vitiated appe- tites, it is the custom to kill the calf for food almost immediately after birth, and any accident that forestalls that event, is considered to enhance its value. We are happy to say, however, that in this country, as far as England and Scot- land are concerned, the taste for very young veal has entirely gone out, and ''Staggering Bob," as the poor little animal was called in the language of the ' shambles, is no longer to be met with in such a place. 850. T!he Weaning OP Calves is a process that requires a great amount of care and judgment; for though they are in reality not weaned till betvv^een the eighth and the twelfth week, the process of rearing them by hand com- mences in fact from the birth, the calf never being allowed to suck its dam. As the rearing of calves for the market is a very important and lucrative business, the breeder generally arranges his stock so that ten or a dozen of his cows shall calve about the same time; and then, by setting aside one or two, to find food for the entire family, gets the remaining eight or ten with their full fountains of milk, to carry on the operations of his dairy. Some people have an idea that skimmed milk, if given in sufficient quantity, is good enough for the weaning period of calf-feeding; but this is a very serious mistake, for the cream, of which it has been deprived, contained nearly all the oleaginous prin- ciples, and the azote or nitrogen, on which the vivifying properties of that fluid depends. Indeed, so remarkably correct has this fact proved to be, that a calf reared on one part of new milk mixed with five of water, will thrive and look well; while another, treated with unlimited skimmed milk, will be poor, thin, and miserable. 851. It is sometimes a matter op considerable trouble to induce the blundering calf—whose instinct only teaches him to suck, and that he will do at anything^ and with anything—to acquire the knowledge of imbibition, thafc403 THE CALF. for the first few days it is often necessary to fill a bottle witli milk, and, opening his mouth, pour the contents down his throat. The manner, however, by which he is finally educated into the mystery of suction, is by putting his allowance of milk into a large wooden bowl; the nurse then puts her hand into the milk, and, by bending her fingers upwards, makes a rude teat for the calf to grasp in his lips, when the vacuum caused by his suction of the fingers, causes the milk to rise along them into his mouth. In this manner one by one the whole family are to be fed three times a day; care being taken, that new-born cah'es are not, at first, fed on milk from a cow who has some days calved. 852. As THE Calf progresses towards his tenth week, his diet requires to be increased in quantity and quality; for these objects, his milk- can be thickened with flour or meal, and small pieces of softened oil-cake are to be slipped into his mouth after sucking, that they may dissolve there, till he grows familiar with, and to like the taste, when it may be softened and scraped down into his milk-and-water. After a time, sliced turnips softened by steam are to be given to him in tolerable quantities ; then succulent grasses; and finally, hay may be added to the others. Some farmers, desirous of rendering their calves fat for the butcher in as short a time as possible, forget both the natural weakness of the digestive powers, and the contracted volume of the stomach, and allow the animals either to suck ad libitum, or give them, if brought up at the pail or by hand, a larger quantity of milk than they can digest. The idea of overloading the stomach never suggests itself to their minds. They suppose that the more food the young creature consumes, the sooner it will be fat, and they allow it no exercise whatever, for fear it should denude its very bones of their flesh. Under such circumstances, the stomach soon becomes deranged ; its functions are no longer capable of acting; the milk, subjected to the acid of the stomach, coagulates, and forms a hardened mass of curd, when the muscles become affected with spasms, and death frequently ensues. 853. There was no species op Slaughtering practised in this country so inhuman and disgraceful as that, till very lately, employed in killing this poor animal; when, under the plea of making the flesh %oh ite, the calf was bled day by day, till, when the final hour came, the animal was unable to stand. This inhumanity is, we believe, now everywhere abolished, and the calf is at once killed, and with the least amount of pain; a sharp-pointed knife is run through the neck, severing all the large veins and arteries up to the vertebrae. The skin is then taken off to the knee, which is disjointed, and to the head, wiiich is removed; it is then reflected backwards, and the carcase having been opened and dressed, is kept apart by stretchers, and the thin membrane, the caul, extended over the organs left in the carcase, as the kidneys and sweet- bread ; some melted fat is then scattered suddenly over the whole interior, giving that white and frosted appearance to the meat, that is thought to add to its beauty; the whole is then hung up to cool and harden. 3 D 2MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. 404 854. The manner of Cutting up Veal for the English market is to divide the carcase into four quarters, with eleyen ribs to each fore quarter; which are again subdivided into joints as exempHfied ou the cut. Hind quarter:—, 1. The loin. 2. The chump, consisting of the rump and hock-bone. S. The fillet. 4. The hock, or hind knuckle. Fore qiiarter:— 5. The shoulder. Q. The neck. 7. The breast. 8. The fore knuckle. 855. The several parts op a moderately- sized WELL-FED Calf, about eight weeks old, are nearly of the following weights :—loin and chump 181bs., fillet 12| lbs., hind knuckleSg lbs., shoulder 11 lbs., neck 11 lbs., breast 9 lbs., and fore knuckle 5 lbs. ; making a total of 144 lbs. weight.

Ingeedtents.—^ lb. of cold roast veal, a few slices of bacon, 1 pint of bread crumbs, | pint of good veal gravy, ^ teaspoonful of minced lemon-peel, 1 blade of pounded mace, cayenne and salt to taste, 4 eggs. Mode.—M.mGe finely the veal and bacon; add the bread crumbs, gravy, and seasoning, and stir these ingredients well together. Beat up the eggs thoroughly; add these, mix the whole well together, put into a dish, and bake from f to 1 hour. When liked, a little good gravy may be served in a tureen as an accompaniment. Time.—From f to 1 hour. Average cost^ exclusive of the cold meat, 6d. Sufficient for 3 or 4 persons. Seaso7iahle from March to October. ROAST BREAST OF VEAL. 857. iNaEEDiENTS.—Yeal; a little flour. Mode.—Wash the veal, well wipe it, and dredge it with flour ; put it down to a bright fire, not too near, as it should not be scorched. Baste it plentifully until done ; dish it, pour , over the meat some good melted but- ter, and send to table with it a piece of boiled bacon and a cut lemon. Tme.—From H- to 2 hours. Seasonable from March to October. BEEAST OF VEAL.MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. 406 STEWED BBBAST OF VEAIi AND PEAS. 858. Ingeedients.—Breast of veal, 2 oz. of butter, a buncL. of savoury herbs, including parsley ; 2 blades of pounded mace, 2 cloves, 5 or 6 young onions, 1 strip of lemon-peel, 6 allspice, i teaspoonful of pepper, 1 teaspoonful of salt, thickening of butter and flour, 2 table- spoonfuls of sherry, 2 tablespoonfuls of tomato sauce, 1 tablespoonful of lemon-juice, 2 tablespoonfuls of mushroom ketchup, green peas. IIode—Qut the breast in half, after removing the bone underneath, and divide the meat into convenient-sized pieces. Put the butter into a frying-pan, lay in the pieces of veal, and fry until of a nice brown colour. Now place these in a stewpan with the herbs, mace, cloves, onions, lemon-peel, allspice, and seasoning; pour over them just suffi- cient boiling water to cover the meat; well close the lid, and let the whole simmer very gently for about 2 hours. Strain off as much gravy as is required, thicken it with butter and flour, add the remaining ingredients, skim well, let it simmer for about 10 minutes, then pour it over the meat. Have ready some green peas, boiled separately; sprinkle these over the veal, and serve, It may be garnished with forcemeat balls, or rashers of bacon curled and fried. Instead of cutting up the meat, many persons prefer it dressed whole;—in that case it should be half-roasted before the water, &c. are put to it. Time.—2i hours. Average cost, 8^d, per lb. Sufficient for 5 or 6 persons. Seasonable from March to October. Beeeding op Calves.—The forwarding of calves to maturity, whether intended to be reared for stock, or brought to an early market as veal, is always a subject of ^reat importance, and requires a considerable amount of intelligence in the selection of the best course, to adopt for either end. When meant to be reared as stock, the breeding should be so arranged that the cow shall calve about the middle of May. As our sub- ject, however, has more immediate reference to the calf as meat than as stock, we shall confine our remarks to the mode of procedure adopted in the former case ; and here, the first process adopted is that of weaning; which consists in separating the calf entirely/ from the cow, but, at the same time, rearing it on the mother's milk. As the business of the dairy would be suspended if every cow were allowed to rear its young, and butter, eheese, and cream become desiderata,—things to be desired, but not possessed, a system of economical husbandry becomes necessary, so as to retain our dairy produce, and yet, for some weeks at least, nourish the calf on its mother's milk, but without allowing the animal to draw that supply for itself: this, with the proper substituted food on which to rear the young animal, is called weaning, VBAIi CAKB (a Convenient Dish for a Picnic). 859. Ingeedients.—A few slices of cold roast veal, a few slices of cold ham, 2 hard-boiled eggs, 2 tablespoonfuls of minced parsley, a little pepper, good gravy. Mode—Cut off all the brown outside from the veal, and cut the €ggs into slices. Procure a pretty mould ; lay veal, ham, eggs, andVEAL. 407 parsley in layers, with a little pepper between each, and when the mould is full, get some strong stock, and fill up the shape. Bake for ^ hour, and when cold, turn it out. Time.—i hour. Seasonable at any time. BOILED CALF'S FEET AND PABSLEY^AND BUTTEK. 860. Ingredients.—2 calf's feet, 2 slices of bacon, 2 oz. of butter, 2 tablespoonfuls of lemon-juice, salt and whole pepper to taste, 1 onion, a bunch of savoury herbs, 4 cloves, 1 blade of mace, water, parsley and butter No. 493. Mode.—FioGuve 2 white calf s feet; bone them as far as the first joint, and put them into warm water to soak for 2 hours. Then put the bacon, butter, lemon-juice, onion, herbs, spices, and seasoning into a stewpan ; lay in the feet, and pour in just sufficient water to cover the whole. Stew gently for about 3 hours ; take out the feet, dish them, and cover with parsley and butter, made by recipe No. 493. The liquor they were boiled in should be strained and put by in a clean basin for use : it will be found very good as an addition to gravies, &c. &c. Time.—Rather more than 3 hours. Average cost^ in full season, 9d, each. Sufficient for 4 persons. Seasonable from March to October. When a Calf should be Killed.—The age at which a calf ought to be killed should not be under four weeks : before that time the flesh is certainly not wholesome, wanting firmness, due development of muscular fibre, and those animal juices on wliich the flavour and nutritive properties of the flesh depend, whatever the unhealthy palate of epicures may deem to the contrary. In France, a law exists to prevent the slaughtering of calves under six weeJcs of age. The calf is considered in prime condition at ten weeks, when he wiU weigh from sixteen to eighteen stone, and sometimes even twenty. FBICASSEED CALF'S FEET. 861. Ingeedients.—A set of calf's feet; for the batter allow for each egg 1 tablespoonful of fiour, 1 tablespoonful of bread crumbs, hot lard or clarified dripping, pepper and salt to taste. Mode.—If the feet are purchased uncleaned, dip them into warm water repeatedly, and scrape off the hair, first one foot and then the other, until the skin looks perfectly clean, a saucepan of water being kept by the fire until they are finished. After washing and soaking in cold water, boil them in just sufficient water to cover them, until the bones come easily away. Then pick them out, and after straining the liquor into a clean vessel, put the meat into a pie-dish until the next day. Now cut it down in slices about k inch thick, lay on them a408 MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY, stiff batter made of eg^, flour, and bread crumbs in the above pro- portion ; season with pepper and salt, and plunge them into a pan of boiling lard. Fry the slices a nice brown, dry them before the fire for a minute or two, dish them on a napkin, and garnish with tufts of parsley. This should be eaten with melted butter, mustard, and vinegar. Be careful to have the lard boiling to set the batter, or the pieces of feet will run about the pan. The liquor they were boiled in should be saved, and will be found useful for enriching gravies, making jellies, &c. &c. Twne.—About 3 hours to stew the feet, 10 or 15 minutes to fry them. Average cost, in full season, 9d. each. Sufficient for 8 persons. Seasonahle from March to October. Note.—This dish can be highly recommended to delicate persons. CoLOUE_ OF Veal.—As whiteness of flesh is considered a great advantage in veal, butchers, in the selection of their calves, are in the habit of examining the inside of its mouth, and noting the colour of the calf's eyes; alleging that, from the signa they there see, they can prognosticate whether the veal will be white or florid. COIiLABED CAIiF'S HEAD. 862. INGREDIENTS.—A calf's head, 4 tablespoonfuls of minced parsley, 4 blades of pounded mace, k teaspoonful of grated nutmeg, ■white pepper to taste, a few thick slices of ham, the yolks of 6 eggs boiled hard. Mode.—Scald the head for a few minutes; take it out of the water, and with a blunt knife scrape off all the hair. Clean it nicely, divide the head and remove the brains. Boil it tender enough to take out the bones, which will be in about 2 hours. When the head is boned, flatten it on the table, sprinkle over it a thick layer of parsley, then a layer of ham, and then the yolks of the eggs cut into thin rings and put a seasoning of pounded mace, nutmeg, and white pepper between each layer; roll the head up in a cloth, and tie it up as tightly as possible. Boil it for 4 hours, and when it is taken out of the pot, place a heavy weight on the top, the same as for other collars. Let it remain till cold; then remove the cloth and binding, and it "will be ready to serve. Time.—Altogether 6 hours. Average cost, 5s. to 7s. each. Seasonahle from March to October. Feeding a Calp.—The amount of milk necessary for a calf for some time, will be about four quarts a day, though, after the first fortnight, that quantity should be gradually increased, according to its development of body, when, if fed exclusively on milk, as much as three gallons a day will be requisite for the due health and require- ments of the animal. If the weather is fine and genial, it should be turned into an orchard or small paddock for a few hours each day, to give it an opportunity to acquireVEAL. a relish for the fresh pasture, which, by the tenth or twelfth week, it will begin to nibble and enjoy. After a certain time, the quantity of milk may be diminished, and its place supplied by water thickened with meal. Hay-tea and linseed-jelly are also higlily nutritious substances, and may be used either as adjuncts or substitutes. FBICASSEED CALF'S HEAD (an Entree). 863. Ingeedients.—The remains of a boiled calf's head, 1^- pint of the liquor in which the head was boiled, 1 blade of pounded mace, 1 onion minced, a bunch of savoury herbs, salt and white pepper to taste, thickening of butter and flour, the yolks of 2 eggs, 1 tablespoon- ful of lemon-juice, forcemeat balls. Mode.—K-emove all the bones from the head, and cut the meat into nice square pieces. Put H pint of the liquor it was boiled in into a saucepan, with mace, onion, herbs, and seasoning in the above pro- portion ; let this simmer gently for f hour, then strain it and put in the meat. When quite hot through, thicken the gravy with a little butter rolled in flour, and, just before dishing the fricassee, put in the beaten yolks of eggs and lemon-juice ; but be particular, after these two latter ingredients are added, that the sauce does not boil, or it will curdle. Garnish with forcemeat balls and curled slices of broiled bacon. To insure the sauce being smooth, it is a good plan to dish the meat first, and then to add the eggs to the gravy: when these are set, the sauce may be poured over the meat. Ti77ie,—Altogether, I5 hour. Average cost, exclusive of the meat, 6d. CALF'S HEAD a la Maitre d'Hotel. 864. Ingeedients.—The remains of a cold calf's head, rather more than 1 pint of Maitre d'hotel sauce No. 466. Mode.—Make the sauce by recipe No. 466, and have it sufficiently thick that it may nicely cover the meat; remove the bones from the head, and cut the meat into neat slices. When the sauce, is ready, lay in the meat; let it gradually/ warm through, and, after it boils up, let it simmer very gently for 5 minutes, and serve. Tiiiie.—'Raihev more than H hour. Average cost, exclusive of the meat, Is. 2d. Seasonable from March to October. The Calf iif Ameeica.—In America, the calf is left with the mother for three op four days, when it is removed, and at once fed on barley and oats ground together and made into a gruel, 1 quart of the meal being boiled for half an hour in 12 quarts of water. One quart of this certainly nutritious gruel, is to be given, lukewarm, morning and evening. In ten days, a bundle of soft hay is put beside the calf, which he soon begins to eat, and, at the same time, some of the dry meal is placed in his manger for him to lick. This process, gradually increasing the quantity of gruel twice a day, is continued for two months, till the calf is fit to go to grass, and, as it is said, with the best possible success. But, in this country, the mode pointed out in No. 862 has received the sanction I of the best experience.MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. m CUERIBD VEAL (Cold Meat Cookery), 865. IiTGEEDiENTS.—The remains of cold roast veal, 4 onions, 2 apples sliced, 1 tablespoonful of curry-powder, 1 dessertspoonful of flour, i pint of broth or water, 1 tablespoonful of lemon-juice. 3fode—Slice the onions and apples, and fry them in a little butter; then take them out, cut the meat into neat cutlets, and fry these of a pale brown; add the curry-powder and flour, put in the onion, apples, and a little broth or water, and stew gently till quite tender; add the lemon-juice, and serve with an edging of boiled rice. The curry may be ornamented with pickles, capsicums, and gherkins arranged prettily on the top. Time—'I hour. Average cost, exclusive of the meat, id. Seasonable from March to October. VEAL CUTLETS (an Entree). 866. Ingeedients.—About 3 lbs. of the prime part of the leg of veal, egg and bread crumbs, 3 tablespoonfuls of minced savoury herbs, salt and pepper to taste, a small piece of butter. 3fode.—Have the veal cut into slices about | of an inch in thickness, and, if not cut perfectly even, level the meat with -a cutlet-bat or rolling-pin. Shape and trim the cutlets, and brush them over with egg. iSprinkle with bread crumbs, with which have been mixed minced herbs and a seasoning of pepper and salt, and press the crumbs down. Fry them of a delicate brown in fresh lard or butter, and be careful not to burn them. They should be very thoroughly done, but not dry. If the cutlets be thick, keep the pan covered for a few minutes at a good distance from the fire, after they have acquired a good colour: by this means, the meat will be done through. Lay the cutlets in a dish, keep them hot, and make a gravy in the pan as follows : Dredge in a little flour, add a piece of butter the size of a walnut, brown it, then pour as much boiling water as is required over it, season with pepper and salt, add a little lemon-juice, give one boil, and pour it over the cutlets. They should be garnished with slices of broiled bacon, and a few forcemeat balls will be found a very excellent addition to this dish. Time.—For cutlets of a moderate thickness, about 12 minutes ; if very thick, allow more time.VEAL, Average costy lOd. per lb. Sufficient for 6 persons. Seasonable from March to October. JVote.—Veal cutlets may be merely floured and fried of a nice brown; the gravy and garnishing should be tlie same as in the preceding recipe. They may also be cut from the loin or neck, as shown in the engraving. BKOILED VSAIj CUTLETS a ritalienne (an Entree). 867. Ingkedients.—Neck of veal, salt and pepper to taste, the yolk of 1 egg, bread crumbs, ^ pint of Italian sauce No. 453. Mode.—Cut the veal into cutlets, flatten and trim them nicely; powder over them a little salt and pepper; brush them over with the yolk of an egg, dip them into bread crumbs, then into clarified butter, and, afterwards, in the bread crumbs again; broil or fry them over a clear fire, that they may acquire a good brown colour. Arrange them in the dish alternately with rashers of broiled ham, and pour the sauce, made by recipe No. 453, in the middle. Time—10 to 15 minutes, according to the thickness of the cutlets. Average cost^ lOd, per lb. Seasonable from March to October. • The Calf's-Head Club.—W^hen the restoration of Charles II. took the strait waistcoat off the minds and morose religion of the Commonwealth period, and gave a loose rein to the long-compressed spirits of the people, there still remained a large section of society wedded to the former state of things. The elders of this party retired from pubhc sight, where, unoffended by the reigning saturnalia, they might dream in seclusion over their departed Utopia. The young bloods of this school, however, who were compelled to mingle in the world, yet detesting the pohtics which had become the fashion, adopted a novel expedient to keep ahve their republican sentiments, and mark their contempt of the reigning family. They accordingly met, in considerable numbers, at some convenient inn, on the 30th of January in each year,—the anniversary of Charles's death, and dined together off a feast prepared from calves' heads, dressed in every Eossible variety of way, and with an abundance of wine drank toasts of defiance and atred to the house of Stuart, and glory to the memory of old HoU Cromwell; and having lighted a large bonfire in the yard, the club of fast young Puritans, with their white handkerchiefs stained red in wine, and one of the party in a mask, bearing an axe, followed by the chahman, carrying a calf's head pinned up in a napkin, marched ia mock procession to the bonfire, into which, with great shouts and uproar, they flung the enveloped head. This odd custom was continued for some time, and even down to the early part of this century it was customary for men of repubhcan poUtics always to dine off calf's head on the 30th of January.

Cooking Collops.—Dean Ramsay, wlio tells us, in his " Remimscences of Scottish Life and Character," a number of famous stories of the strong-headed, warm-hearted, and plain-spoken old dames of the north, gives, amongst them, the following:—A strong-minded lady of this class was inquiring the character of a cook she was about to hire. The lady who was giving the character entered a little upon the cook's moral quahfications, and described her as a very decent woman j to which the astounding reply—this was 60 years ago, and a Dean tells the story—" Oh, d n her decency can she make good collops ? " BOAST FILLET OP VEAL. 87^2. Ingredients.—Veal, forcemeat No. 417, melted butter. Mode.—Have the fillet cut according to the size required; take out the bone, and after raising the skin from the meat, put under the flap a nice forcemeat, made by recipe No. 417. Prepare sufficient of this, as there should be some left to eat cold, and to season and flavour a mince if required. Skewer and bind the veal up in a round form; dredge well with £our, put it down at some dis- tance from the fire at first, and baste con- tinually. About J hour before serving, draw it nearer the fire, that it may acquire more colour, as the outside should be of a rich brown, but not. burnt. Dish it, remove the skewers, which replace by a silver one; pour over the joint some good melted butter, and serve with either boiled ham, bacon, or pickled pork. Never omit to send a cut lemon to table with roast veal. Time.--A fillet of veal weighing 12 lbs., about 4 hours. Average cost, 9d. per lb. Sufficient for 9 or 10 persons.

Mode.—If the whole of the leg is purchased, take off the knuckle to stew, and also the square end, which will serve for cutlets or pies. Eemove the bone, and fill the space with a forcemeat No. 417. Roll and skewer it up firmly; place a few skewers at the bottom of a stew- pan to prevent the meat from sticking, and cover the veal with a little weak stock. Let it simmer very gently until tender, as the more slowly veal is stewed, the better. Strain and thicken the sauce, flavour it with lemon-juice, mace, sherry, and white pepper; give one boil, and pour it over the meat. The skewers should be removed, and replaced by a silver one, and the dish garnished with slices of cut lemon. Time.—A. fillet of veal weighing 6 lbs., 3 hours' very gentle stewing. Average costf 9d. per lb. Sufficient for 5 or 6 persons. Seasonable from March to October. The GoLDEi^^ Calf.—We are told in the book of Genesis, that Aaron, in the lengthened absence of Moses, was constrained by the impatient people to make them an image to •worship}; .and that Aaron, instead of using his delegated power to curb this sinful expression of the tribes, and appease the discontented Jews, at once complied with their demand, and, telling them to bring to him their rin^s and trinkets, fashioned out of their willing contributions a calf of gold, before which the multitude fell down and worshipped. "Whether this image was a solid figure of gold, or a wooden effipr merely, coated with metal, is uncertain. To suppose the former,—knowing the size of the image made from such trifling articles as rings, we must presuppose the Israelites to have spoiled the Egyptians most unmercifully: the figure, however, is of more consequence than the weight or size of the idol. That the Israelites brought away more from Goshen than the plunder of the Egyptians, and that they were deeply imbued with Egyptian superstition, the golden calf is only one, out of many, instances of proof; for a gilded ox, covered with a pall, was in that country an emblem of Osiris, one of the gods of the 33gyptian trinity. Besides having a sacred cow, and many varieties of the holy bull, this priest-ridden people worshipped the ox as a symbol of the sun, and offered to it divine honours, as the emblem of frugality, industry, and husbandry. It is therefore probable that, in borrowing so familiar a type, the Israelites, in their calf-worship, meant, under a well-understood cherubic symbol, to acknowledge the full force of those virtues, under an emblem of divine power and goodness. The prophet Hosea is full of denunciations against calf-worship in Israel, and alludes to the custom of kissing these idols, Hosea, viii. 4—6. PBIOANDEAU OP VEAL (an Entree). 874. Ingeedients.—A piece of the fat side of a leg of veal (about 3 lbs.), lardoons, 2 carrots, 2 large onions, a faggot of savoury herbs, 2 blades of pounded mace, 6 whole allspice, 2 bay-leaves, pepper to taste, a few slices of fat bacon, 1 pint of stock No. 107. 3fode.—The veal for a fricandeau should be of the best quality, orMODERN MODE OF SEHVING DISHES.415 VEAL. it will not be good. It may be known by the meat being white and not thready. Take off the skin, flatten the veal on the table, then at one stroke of the knife, cut off as much as is required, for a fricandeau with an uneven surface never looks well. Trim it, and with a sharp knife make two or three slits in the middle, that it may taste more of the seasoning. 'Now lard it thickly with fat bacon, as lean gives a red colour to the fricandeau. Slice the vegetables, and put these, with the herbs and spices, in the middle of pbioandeau oe teal. a stewpan, with a few slices of bacon at the top: these should form a sort of mound in the centre for the veal to rest upon. Lay the fricandeau over the bacon, sprinkle over it a little salt, and pour in just sufficient stock to cover the bacon, &c., without touching the veal. Let it gradually come to a boil; then put it over a slow and equal fire, and let it simmer very gently for about 2i hours, or longer should it be very large. Baste it frequently with the liquor, and a short time before serving, put it into a brisk oven, to make the bacon firm, which otherwise would break when it was glazed. Dish the fricandeau, keep it hot, skim off the fat from the liquor, and reduce it quickly to a glaze, with which glaze the fricandeau, and serve with a puree of whatever vegetable happens to be in season—spinach, sorrel, asparagus, cucumbers, peas, &c. Time—2^ hours. If very large, allow more time. Average cost, Zs, 6d, Sufficient for an entree. Seasonable from March to October. PEICAITDllAIT OF VEAL {3Iore economical.) 875.

Stew very gently for 3 hours; glaze, and serve it on sorrel, spinach, or with a little gravy in the dish. Time.—Z hours. Average cost, 2s. 6d. Sufficient for an entree. Seasonable from March to October j^^ote.—When the prime part of the leg is cut off, it spoils the whole ; con- sequently, to use this for a fricandeau is rather extravagant. The best end of the neck answers the purpose nearly or quite as well. BOILED CALF'S HEAD (with the Skin on). 876. Ingredients.—Calf s head, boiling water, bread crumbs, 1 large bunch of parsley, butter, white pepper and salt to taste, 4 table- spoonfuls of melted butter, 1 tablespoonful of lemon-juice, 2 or 3 grains of cayenne.

When perfectly clean, take the eyes out, cut off the ears, and remove the brain, which soak for an hour in warm water. Put the head into hot water to soak for a few minutes, to make it look white, and then have ready a stewpan, into which lay the head; cover it with cold water, and bring it gra- dually to boil. Remove the scum, and add a little salt, which assists to throw it up. Simmer it very gently from 2^ to 3 hours, and when nearly done, boil the brains for ^ hour; skin and chop them, not too finely, and add a tablespoonful of minced parsley which has been previously scalded. Season with pepper and salt, and stir the brains, parsley, &c., into about 4 tablepoonsfuls of melted butter; add the lemon-juice and cayenne, and keep these hot by the side of the fire. Take up the head, cut out the tongue, skin it, put it on a small dish with the brains round it; sprinkle over the head a few bread crumbs mixed with a little minced parsley ; brown these before the fire, and serve with a tureen of parsley and butter, and either boiled bacon, ham, or pickled pork as an accompaniment. Time.—2i to 3 hours. Average cost, according to the season, from 3s. to 7s. Gd, Sufficient for 8 or 9 persons. Seasonable from March to October. BOILED CALF'S HEAD (without the Skin). 877. Ingeedients.—Calf s head, water, a little salt, 4 tablespoonfuls of melted butter, 1 tablespoonful of minced parsley, pepper and salt to taste, 1 tablespoonful of lemon-juice.417 VEAL.

Take up the head, skin the tongue, and put it on a small dish with the brains round it. Have ready some parsley and butter, smother the head with it, and the remainder send to table in a tureen. Bacon, ham, pickled pork, or a pig's cheek, are indispensable with calfs head. The brains are some- times chopped with hard-boiled eggs, and mixed with a little Bechamel or white sauce. Time.—Fiom li to 2\ hours. Average cost, according to the season, from 3s. to 5s. Sufficient for 6 or 7 persons. Seasonable from March to October. Is^ote.—Tlie liquor in which the head was boiled should be saved : it makes excellent soup, and will be found a nice addition to gravies, &c. Half a calf's head is as frequently served as a whole one, it being a more convenient-sized joint for a small family. It is cooked in the same manner, and served with the same sauces, as in the preceding recipe. HASHED CALF'S HEAD (Cold Meat Cookery). 878. Ingeediei^ts.—The remains of a cold boiled calf's head, 1 quart of the liquor in which it was boiled, a faggot of savoury herbs, 1 onion, 1 carrot, a strip of lemon-peel, 2 blades of pounded mace, salt and white pepper to taste, a very little cayenne, rather more than 2 table- spoonfuls of sherry, 1 tablespoonful of lemon-juice, 1 tablespoonful of mushroom ketchup, forcemeat balls. 3fode.—Cut the meat into neat slices, and put the bones and trim- mings into a stewpan with the above proportion of liquor that the head was boiled in.

The Calf a Symbol of Divins Poweb.—A. singular symbolical ceremony existed among the Hebrews, in wMch. the calf performed a most important part. The calf being a type or symbol of Divine power, or what was called the EloMm,—the Almighty intelligence that brought them out of Egypt,—was looked upon much in the same light by the Jews, as the cross subsequently was by the Christians, a mystical emblem of the Divine passion and goodness. Consequently, an oath taken on either the calf or the cross was considered equally solemn and sacred by Jew or Nazarene, and the brealdng of it a soul-staining perjury on themselves, and an insult and profanation, directly offered to the Almighty. To render the oath more impressive and solemn, it was customary to slaughter a dedicated calf in the temple, when, the priests having divided the carcase into a certain number of parts, and with intervening spaces, arranged the severed limbs on the marble pavement, the one, or all the party, if there were many individuals, to be bound by the oath, repeating the words of the compact, threaded their way in and out through the different spaces, till they had taken the circuit of each portion of the divided calf, when the ceremony was concluded.

After investing the city for some time, and reducing the inhabi- tants to dreadful suffering and privation, the Babylonians, hearing that Pharaoh, whom the Jews had solicited for aid, was rapidly approaching with a powerful army, hastily raised the siege, and, removing to a distance, took up a position where they could inter- cept the Egyptians, and still cover the city. No sooner did the Jews behold the retreat of the enemy, than they believed all danger was past, and, with their usual turpitude, they repudiated their oath, and refused to liberate their oppressed countrymen. For this violation of their covenant with the Lord, they were given over to all the horrors of the sword, pestilence, and famine.—Jeremiah, xxxiv. 15—17. MIK-CHD VEAL AND MAOAROrTI.

Names of Calves, &c.—During the time tlie young male calf is suckled by liis mother, he is called a bull- or ox-calf; when turned a year old, he is called a stirk, stot, or yearliug; on the completion of his second year, he is called a two-year-old bull or steer (and in some counties a twinter); then, a three-year-old steer ; and at four, an ox or a bullock, which latter names are retained till death. It may be here remarked, that the term ox is used as a general or common appellation for neat cattle, in a specific sense, and irrespective of sex; as the British ox, the Indian ox. The female is termed cow, but while sucking the mother, a cow-calf; at the age of a year, she is called a yearling quey; in another year, a heifer, or twinter ; then, a three-year-old quey or twinter ; and, at four years old, a cow.

The FATTENIK-Gi- OF Calves.—The fattening of calves for tlie market is an important business in Lanarkshire or Clydesdale, and numbers of newly-dropped calves are regularly carried there from the farmers of the adjacent districts, in order to be prepared for the butcher. The mode of feeding them is very simple; milk is the chief article of their diet, and of this the calves require a sufficient supply from first to last. Added to this, they must be kept in a well-aired place, neither too hot nor too cold, and freely supplied with dry litter. It is usual to exclude the light,—at all events to a great degree, and to put within their reach a lump of challr, which they are very fond of licking. Thus fed, calves, at the end of 8 or 9 weeks, often attain a very large size; viz., 18 to 20 stone, exclusive of the offal. Far heavier weights have occurred, and without any dete- rioration in the delicacy and richness of the flesh. This mode of feeding upon millc alone at first appears to be very expensive, but it is not so, when all things are taken into consideration; for at the age of 9 or 10 weeks a calf, originally purchased for 8 shillings, will realize nearly the same number of pounds. For 4, or even 6 weeks, the milk of one cow is sufficient,—indeed half that quantity is enough for the first fortnight; but after the 5th or 6th week it will consume the greater portion of the milk of two moderate cows; but then it requires neither oil-cake nor linseed, nor any other food. Usually, however, the calves are not kept beyond the age of 6 weeks, and will then sell for 5 or 6 pounds each : the milk of the cow is then ready for a successor. In this manner a relay of calves may be prepared for the markets from early spring to the end of summer, a plan more advantageous than that of overfeeding one to a useless degree ef corpulency. VBAIi SAUSAG-ES. 904. In-geediekts.—Equal quantities of fat bacon and lean veal; to every lb. of meat, allow 1 teaspoonful of minced sage, salt and pepper to taste.

Seasonable from March to October. STEWED VEAL, with Peas, young Carrots, and new Potatoes. 905. Ingredients.—3 or 4 lbs. of the loin or neck of veal, 15 young carrots, a few green onions, 1 pint of green peas, 12 new potatoes, a bunch of savoury herbs, pepper and salt to taste, 1 tablespoonful of lemon-juice, 2 tablespoonfuls of tomato sauce, 2 tablespoonfuls of mushroom ketchup. Mode,—Dredge the meat with flour, and roast or bake it for about f hour: it should acquire a nice brov/n colour. Put the meat into a stewpan with the carrots, onions, potatoes, herbs, pepper, and salt; pour over.it sufficient boiling water to cover it, and stew gently for 2 hours. Take out the meat and herbs, put it in a deep dish, skim off all the fat from the gravy, and flavour it with lemon-juice, tomato sauce, and mushroom ketchup in the above proportion. Have ready a pint of green peas boiled separately ; put these with the meat, pour over it the gravy, and serve. The dish may be garnished with a few forcemeat balls. The meat, when preferred, may be cut into chops,431 VEAL. and floured and fried instead of being roasted ; and any part of veal dressed in this way will be found extremely savoury and good.

Cow-Pox, OE Variola.—It is to Dr. Jcnner, of Berkeley, Gloucestersliire, who died in 1823, that we ov/e the x)ractice of vaccination, as a preservative from the attack of that destructive scourge of the human race, the small-pox. The experimeuts of this philosophic man were begun in 1797, and published the next year. He had observed that cows were subject to a certain infectious eruption of the teats, and that those persons who became affected by it, while milking the cattle, escaped the smail-pos raging around them. This fact, known to farmers from time immemorial, led him to a course of experiments, the result of which all are acquainted with. TSNDROISrS DE VEAU (an Entree). 910.

Seasonable from March to October. A Frenchman's Opinion Veal.—great authority in his native Paris tells us, that veal, as a meat, is but little nourishing, is relaxing, and sufficiently difficult of digestion. Lending itself, as it does, he says, in all the iIo\Yery imagery of the French tongue and manner, '* to so many metamorphoses, it may be called, without exaggeration, the chameleon of the kitchen. Who has not eaten calf's head mc naturel, simply boiled with the skin on, its ilavour heightened by sauce just a little sharp ? It is a dish as wholesome as it is agreeable, and one that the most inexperienced cook may serve with success. Calf s feet a lapmdette, au gratin, fried, &c.; les cervelles, served in the same manner, and under the same names; sweetbreads en fricandeau, piques enfm,—all these offer most satisfactory entrees, which the art of the cook, more or less, varies for the grati- ^cation of his glory and the well-beirjg of our appetites. We have not spoken, in the cbove catalogue, either of the liver, or of ih.efraise, or of the ears, which also share the honour of appearing at our tables. Where is the man not acquainted with calf's liver h la bourgeoise, the most frequent and convenient dish at unpretentious tables ? The/mise, cooked in water, and eaten with vinegar, is a wholesome and agreeable dish, and contains a mucilage well adapted for dehcate persons. Calf's ears have, in common with the feet and cervelles, the advantage of being able to bo eaten either fried or a la poulette; and besides, can be made into a, farce, witli the addition of peas, onions, cheese, &c. Neither is it confined to the calf's tongue, or even the eyes, that these shall dispute alone the glory of awakening the taste of man; thus, the fressure (which, as is known, comprises the heart, the moii, and the rate), although not a very recherche dish, lends itself to all the caprices of an expert artist, and m.ay, under various marvellous disguises, deceive, and please, and even awaken our appetite!"—Verily, we might say, after this rhapsody olf our neighbour, that his country's weal will not suffer in him as an able and eloquent exponent and admirer.VEAL. 435 VEAL CAEVING. , BBSAST OF VEAL. 912. The carving of a breast of veal is not dissimilar to tliat of a fore-quarter of lainb, when the shoulder has been taken off. The breast of veal consists of two parts,— the rib-bones and the gristly brisket. These two parts should first be sepa- rated by sharply passing the knife in the direction of the lines 1, 2; when they are entirely divided, the rib-bones should be carved in the direction of the lines 5 to 6; and the brisket can be helped by cut- ting pieces in the direction 3 to 4. The carver should ask the guests whether they have a preference for the brisket or ribs ; and if there be a sweetbread served with the dish, as it often is with roast breast of veal, each person should receive a piece.

This is not altogether the most easy-looking dish to cut when it is put before a carver for the first time ; there is not much real difficulty in the operation, however, when the head has been attentively examined, and, after the ma^nner of a phrenologist, you get to knov7 its bumps, good and bad. In the first place^ inserting the knife quite down to the bone, cut slices in the direction of the line 1 to 2; with each of these should be helped a piece of what is called the throat sweetbread, cut in the direction of from 3 to 4. The eye, and the flesh round, are favourite morsels with many, and should be given to those at the table who are known to be the greatest connoisseurs. The jawbone being removed, there will then be found some nice lean; and the palate, which is reckoned by some a tit-bit, lies under the head. On a separate dish there is always served the tongue and brains, and each guest should be asked to take some of these. 2 F 2MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. ^36 the knife down in the direction of the line 1 to 2.

The engraving, showing the dotted line from 1 to 2, sufficiently indicates the direction v/hich should be given to the knife in carving this dish. The best slices are those from the thickest part of the knuckle, that is, outside the line 1 to 2. * LOIIT OF VEAL. 916. As is the case with a loin of mutton, the careful jointing of a loin of veal is more than half the battle in carving it. If the butcher bo negligent in this matter, he should be ad- monished ; for there is nothing more annoying or irritating to an inexperienced carver than to be obliged to turn his knife in all directions to find the exact place w^here it should be inserted in order to divide the bones.

" Birds, the free tenants of laud, air, and ocean, Their forms all symmetry, their motions grace; In plumage delicate and'beautiful; Thick without burthen, close as fishes' scales, Or loose as full-blown poppies to the breeze." The Pelican Islarid. 917. The Divisions of Birds are founded principally on their habits o life, and the natural resemblance which their external parts, especially their bills, bear to each other. According to Mr. Vigors, there are five orders, each of which occupies its peculiar place on the surface of the globe; so that the air, the forest, the land, the marsh, and the water, has each its appropriate kind of inhabitants. These are respectively designated as Birds of Prey, Perchers, Walkers, Waders, and Swimmers ; and, in contemplating their variety, lightness, beauty, and wonderful adaptation to the regions they severally inhabit, and the functions they are destined to perform in the grand scheme of creation, our hearts are lifted with admiration at the exhaustless ingenuity, power, and wisdom of Him who has, in producing them, so strikingly ''manifested His handiwork." Not only these, however, but all classes of animals, have their peculiar ends to fulfil; and, in order that this may be eliGctually performed, they are constructed in such a manner as will enable them to carry out their conditions. Thus the quadrupeds, that are formed to438 MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. tread the earth in common with man, are muscular and vigorous; and, whether they have passed into the servitude of man, or are permitted to range the forest or the field, they still retain, in a high degree, the energies with Tvhich they were originally endowed. Birds, on the contrary, are generally feeble, and, therefore, timid. Accordingly, wings have been given them to enable them to fly through the air, and thus elude the force which, by nature, they are unable to resist. Notwithstanding the natural tendency of all bodies towards the centre of the earth, birds, when raised in the atmosphere, glide through it with the greatest ease, rapidity, and vigour. There, they are in their natural element, and can vary their course with the greatest prompti- tude—can mount or descend with the utmost facility, and can light on any spot with the most perfect exactness, and without the slightest injury to themselves. 918. The IVIechanism which enables Birds to wing their course through the air, is both singular and instructive. Their bodies are covered with feathers, which are much lighter than coverings of hair, with which quadrupeds are u;sually clothed. The feathers are so placed as to overlap each other, like the slates or the tiles on the roof of a house. They are also arranged from the fore-part backwards ; by which the animals are enabled the more conveniently to cut their way through the air. Their bones are tuoular or hollow, and extremely light compared with those of terrestrial animals. This greatly facilitates their rising from the earth, whilst their heads, being comparatively small, their bills shai^ed like a wedge, their bodies slender, sharp below, and round above,—all these present a union of conditions, favourable, in the last degree, to cutting their way through the aerial element to which they are considered as more peculiarly to belong. With all these conditions, however, birds could not fly without wings. These, there- fore, are the instruments by which they have the power of rapid locomotion, and are constructed in such a manner as to be capable of great expansion when stmck in a downward direction. If we except, in this action, the slight hollow which takes place on the under-side, they become almost two planes. In order that the downward action may be accomplished to the necessary extent, the muscles which move the wings have been made exceedingly large; so large, indeed, that, in some instances, they have been estimated at not Igbs than a sixth of the weight of the Vv'hole body. Therefore, when a bird is on the ground and intends to fly, it takes a leap, and immediately stretching its wings, strikes them out with great force. By this act these are brought into an oblique direction, being turned partly upwards and partly horizontally forwards. That part of the force which has the upward tendency is neutralized by the weight of the bird, whilst the horizontal force serves to carry it forward. The stroke being completed, it moves upon its v/ings, which, being contracted and having their edges turned upwards, obviate, in a great measure, the resistance of the air. When it is sufficiently elevated, it makes a second stroke downwards, and the impulse of the air again moves it forward. These successive strokes may be regarded as so many leaps taken in the air. WhenBIRDS. 439 the bird desires to direct its course to the right or the left^ it strikes strongly with the opposite wing^ which impels it to the proper side. In the motions of the animal, too, the tail takes a prominent part, and acts like the rudder of a ship, except that, instead of sideways, it moves upwards and downwards. If the bird wishes to rise, it raises its tail; and if to fall, it depresses it; and, whilst in a horizontal position, it keeps it steady. There are few who have not observed a pigeon or a crow preserve, for some time, a horizontal flight without any apparent motion of the wings. This is accomplished by the bird having already acquired sufficient velocity, and its wings being parallel to the horizon, meeting with but small resistance from the atmosphere. If it begins to fall, it can easily steer itself ux3ward by means of its tail, till the motion it had acquired is nearly spent, when it must be renewed by a fev/ more strokes of the wings. On alighting, a bird expands its wings and tail fully against the air, as a ship, in tacking round, backs her sails, in order that they may meet with all the resistance possible. 919. In the GoNSTEUCTiOiT OJ' THE Etes of birds, there is a peculiarity necessary to their condition. As they pass a great portion of their lives amoEg thickets and hedges, they are provided for the defence oi their eyes from external injuries, as well as from the effects of the light, when %ing in opposition to the rays of the sun, with a nictating or winking membrane, which can, at pleasure, be drawn over the whole eye like a curtain. This covering is neither opaque nor wholly pellucid, but is somewhat transparent; and it is by its means that the eagle is said to be able to gaze at the sun. ''In birds," says a writer on this subject, " v/e find that the sight is much more piercing, extensive, and exact, than in the other orders of animals. The eye is much, larger in proportion to the bulk of the head, than in any of these. This is a superiority conferred upon them not without a corresponding utility: it seems even indispensable to their safety and subsistence. Were this organ in birds dull, or in the least degree opaque, they would be in danger, from the rapid- ity of their motion, of striking against various objects in their flight. In this case their celerity, instead of being an advantage, would become an evil, and their flight be restrained by the danger resulting from it. Indeed we may consider the velocity with which an animal moves, as a sure indication of the perfection of its vision. Among the quadrupeds, the sloth has its sight greatly limited; whilst the hawk, as it hovers in the air, can espy a lark sitting on a clod, perhaps at twenty times the distance at which a man or a dog could perceive it.'\ Q20. Amongst the many peculiarities in the Construction of Birds, not the least is the mode by which their respiration is accomplished. This is effected by means of air-vessels, which extend throughout the body, and adhere to the under-surface of the bones. These, by their motion, force the air through the true lungs, which are very small, and placed in the uppermost part of the chest, and closely braced down to the back and ribs. The lungs, which are never expanded by air, are destined to the sole purpose of oxidizing4-10 MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERT. the blood. In tlie experiments made by Mr, John Hunter, to discover the use of this general diffusion of air through the bodies of birds, he found that it prevents their respiration from being stopped or interrupted by the rapidity of their motion through a resisting medium. It is well known that, in pro- portion to celerity of motion, the air becomes resistive ; and were it possible for a man to move with the swiftness of a swallow, as ho is not provided with an internal construction similar to that of birds, the resistance oi the air would soon suffocate him. 921. Birds are Distributed over every part of the Globe, being found in the coldest as well as the hottest regions, although some species are restricted to particular countries, whilst others are widely dispersed. At certain seasons of the year, many of them change their abodes, and migrate to climates better adapted to their temperaments or modes of life, for a time, than those v^rhich they leave. Many of the birds of Britain, directed by an unerring instinct, take their departure from the island before the com- mencement of mnter, and proceed to the more congenial warmth of Africa, to return with the next spring. The causes assigned by naturalists for this peculiarity are, either a deficiency of food, or the want of a secure asylum for the incubation and nourishment of their young. Their migrations are gene- rally performed in large com.panies, and, in the day, they follow a leader, which is occasionally changed. During the night, many of the tribes send forth a continual cry, to keep themselves together ; although one would think that the noise which must accompany their flight would be sufficient for that purpose. The flight of birds across the Mediterranean was noticed three thousand years ago, as we find it said in the book of Numbers, in the Scrip- tures, that "There went forth a wind from the Lord, and brought quails from the sea, and let them fall upon the camp, and a day's journey round about it, to the height of two cubits above the earth." 922. If the Beauty of Birds were not a recommendation to their being universally admired, their general liveliness, gaiety, and song would endear them to mankind. It appears, however, from accurate observations founded upon experiment, that the notes iDCCuliar to different kinds of birds are altogether acquired, and that they are not innate, any more than language is to man. The attempt of a nestling bird to sing has been compared to the endeavour of a child to talk. The first attem^Dts do not seem to possess the slightest rudiments of the future song; but, as the bird grows older and becomes stronger, it is easily perceived to be aiming at acquiring the art of giving utterance to song. Whilst the scholar is thus endeavouring to form his notes, v/hen he is once sure of a passage, he usually raises his tone, but drops it again when he finds himself unequal to the voluntary task he has midertaken. "LTany well-authenticated facts," says an ingenious writer, "seem decisively to prove that birds have no innate notes, but that, liko mankind, the language of those to whose care they have been committed at their birth, will be their language in after-life." It would appear, however.BlUDS. 441 somewhat unaccountable why, in a wild state, they adhere so steadily to the song of their own species only, v.dicn the notes ot so many others are to be heard around them. This is said to arise from the attention paid by the nestling bird to the instructions of its own parent only, generally disregarding the notes of all the rest. Persons, however, who have an accurate ear, and who have given their attention to the songs of birds, can frequently distinguish some which have their notes mixed with those of another species ; but this is in general so trifling, that it can hardly be considered as more than the mere varieties of provincial dialects. 923. In Reference to the Food op Birds, we find that it varies, as it does in quadrupeds, accv">rding to the species. Some are altogether car- nivorous ; others, as so many of the web-footed tribes, subsist on fish; others, again, on insects and worms; and others on grain and fruit. The extraordinary powers of the gizzard of the granivorous tribes, in comminuting their food so as to prepare it for digestion, v^^ould, were they not supported by incontrovertible facts founded on experiment, appear to exceed all credibility. Tin tubes, full of grain, have been forced into the stomachs of turkeys, and in twenty-four hours have been found broken, compressed, and distorted into every shape. Twelve small lancets, very sharp both at the point and edges, have been fixed in a ball of lead, covered with a case oi paper, and given to a turkey-cock, and left in its stomach for eight hours. After that time the stomach Avas opened, wdien nothing appeared except the naked ball. The twelve lancets were broken to pieces, whilst the stomach remained perfectly sound and entire. From these facts, it is concluded that the stones, so frequently found in the stomachs of the feathered tribes, are highly useful in assisting the gastric juices to grind down the grain and other hard substances wdiich constitute their food. The stones, themselves, being also gTound down and separated by the powerful action of the gizzard, are mixed with the food, and, no doubt, contribute very greatly to the health, as well as to the nourishment of the animals. 924. All Birds being Oviparous, the eggs which they produce after the process of incubation, or sitting for a certain length of time, are, in the various species, difterent both in figure and colour, as well as in point of number. They contain the elements of the future young, for the perfecting of which in the incubation a bubble of air is always placed at the large end, between the shell and the inside skin. It is supposed that from the heat communicated by the sitting bird to this confined air, its spring is increased beyond its natural tenor, and, at the same time, its parts are put into motion by the gentle rarefaction. By this means, pressure and motion are communi- cated to the ]Darts of the egg, which, in some inscrutable way, gradually promote the formation and growth of the young, till the time comes for its escaping from the shell. To i^reserve an egg perfectly fresh, and even fit for incubation, for 5 or 6 months after it has been laid, Reaumur, the French naturalist, has shown that it is only necessary to stop up its pores with a slight coating of varnish or mutton-suet.442 MOBEHN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. 925. BiRDS^ HOWEVER, DO NOT LAY EGG3 before they have some place to put tliem ; accordmgly, they consti act nests for themselves with astonishing arc. As builders, they exhibit a degree of architectural skill, niceness, and pro- priety, that would seem even to mock the imitative talents of man, however greatly these are marked by his own high intelligence and ingenuity. "Each circumstance Most artfully contrived to favour warmth. Here read the reason of the vaulted roof; He: Providence compensates, ever kind, The enormous disproportion that subsists Between the mother and the numerous brood Which her small bulk must quicken into hfe." In building their nests, the male and female generally assist each other, and they contrive to make the outside of their tenement bear as great a resemblance as possible to the surrounding foliage or branches; so that it cannot very easily be discovered even by those v/ho are in search of it. This art of nidification is one of the most wonderful contrivances which the wide field of Nature can show, and which, of itself, ought to be sufficient to compel mankind to the belief, that they and every other part of the creation, are con- stantly under the protecting power of a superintending Being, Vv'^hose benign dispensations seem as exhaustless as they are unlimited./ RECIPES. CHAPTER XXI. CHICKEN CUTLETS (an Entree), 926. Ingeedients.—2 cliickeiis; seasoning to taste of salt, white pepper, and cayenne ; 2 blades of pounded mace, egg and bread crumbs, clarified butter, 1 strip of lemon-rind, 2 carrots, 1 onion, 2 tablespoonfuls of mushroom ketchup, thickening of butter and flour, 1 egg. Mbc?e.—Eemove the breast and leg bones of the chickens; cut the meat into neat pieces after haying skinned it, and season the cutlets with pepper, salt, pounded mace, and cayenne. Put the bones, trimmings, &c., into a stewpan with 1 pint of water, adding carrots, onions, and lemon-peel in the above proportion ; stew gently for H hour, and strain the gravy. Thicken it with butter and flour, add the ketchup and 1 egg well beaten; stir it over the fire, and bring it to the simmering-point, but do not allow it to boil. In the mean time, egg and bread-crumb the cutlets, and give them a few drops of clarified butter ; fry them a delicate brown, occasionally turning them; arrange them pyramidically on the dish, and pour over them the sauce. Time.—10 minutes to fry the cutlets. Average costf 2s. each. Sufficient for an entree. Seasonable from April to July. Fowls as Food—Brillat Savarin, pre-eminent in gastronomio taste, says that lie believes the whole gallinaceous family was made to enrich our larders and furnish our tables; for, from the quail to the turkey, he avers their flesh is a light aliment, full of flavour, and fitted equally well for the invahd as for the man of robust health. The fine flavour, however, which Nature has given to all birds coming under the definition of poultry, man has not been satisfied with, and has used many means—such as keeping them in solitude and darkness, and forcing them to eat—to give them an unnatural state of fatness or fat. This fat, thus artificially produced, is doubtless delicious, and the taste and succulence of the boiled and roasted bird draw forth the praise of theMODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKErvY. guests around the table. Well-fattened and tender, a fowl is to the cook what the canvas is to the i^ainter; for do we not see it served boiled, roasted, fried, fricasseed, hashed, hot, cold, whole, dismembered, boned, broiled, stulFed, on dishes, and in pies,— always handy and ever acceptable ? The Common- on Domestic Fowl.—From time immemorial, the common or domestic fowl has been domesticated in England, and is supposed to be originally the offspring of some wild species which abound in the forests of India. It is divided into a variety of breeds, but the most esteemed are, the Poland or Black, the Dorking, the Bantam, the Game Fowl, and the Malay or Chittagong. The common, or barn-door fowl, is one of the most delicate of the varieties; and at Dorking, in Surrey, the breed is brought to great perfection. Till they are four months old, the term chicken is apphed to the younj^ female; after that age they are called pullets, till they begin to lay, when they are called hens. Tlie English counties most productive in poultry are Surrey, Sussex, Norfolk, Herts, Devon, and Somerset. FRENCH CHICKEJSr CUTLETS (Cold Meat Cookery). 927. Ingredients.—The remains of cold roast or boiled fowl, fried bread, clarified butter, the yolk of 1 egg, bread crumbs, i teaspoonful of finely-minced lemon-peel; salt, cayenne, and mace to taste. For sauce,—1 oz. of butter, -2 minced shalots, a few slices of carrot, a small bunch of savoury herbs, including parsley, 1 blade of pounded mace, 6 peppercorns, I pint of gravy. Ilode.—Cut the fowls into as many nice cutlets as possible; take a corresponding number of sippets about the same size, all cut one shape; fry them a pale brown, put them before the fire, then dip the cutlets into clarified butter mixed with the yolk of an egg, cover with bread crumbs seasoned in the above proportion, with lemon-peel, mace, salt, and cayenne; fry them for about 5 minutes, put each piece on one of the sippets, pile them high in the dish, and serve with the following sauce, which should be made ready for the cutlets. Put the butter into a stewpan, add the shalots, carrot, herbs, mace, and peppercorns; fry for 10 minutes or rather longer; pour in i pint of good gravy, made of the chicken bones, stew gently for 20 minutes, strain it, and serve. Time. — 5 minutes to fry the cutlets ; 35 minutes to make the gravy. Average cost, exclusive of the chicken, 9^7. Seasonahle from April to July. Eggs pok HatchinCt.—Eggs intended for hatching should be removed as soon as laid, and placed in bran in a dry, cool place. Choose those that are near of a size; and, as a rule, avoid those that are equally thick at both ends,—such, probably, contain a doublo Tolk, and will come to no good. Eggs intended for hatching should never be stored longer than a month, as much less the better. Nine eggs may be placed under a Bantam hen, and as many as fifteen under a Dorking. The odd number is considered pr^erable, as more easily packed. It will be as well to mark the eggs you give the hen to sit on, so that you may know if she lays any more : if she does, you must remove them; for, if hatched at all, they would be too late for the brood. If during incubation an egg should be broken, remove it, and take out the remainder, and cleanse them in luke-warm water, or it is probable the sticky natvire of the contents of the broken egg will make the others cling to the hen's feathers; and they, too, may be fractured. Hens Sitting,—Some hens are very capricious as regards sitting ; they will make a great fuss, and keep pining for the nest, and, when they are permitted to take to it, theyrouLTHT, will sit just long Gnough to addle the eggs, and tlien they're off again. _ The safest way to guard against such annoyance, is to supply the hen ^Yith some hard-boiled eggs; if she sits on them a reasonable time, and seems steadily inclined, like a good matron, you may then give her proper eggs, and let her set about the business in earnest. CHICKEN OR FOWL PATTIES. 928. Ingredients.—The remains of cold roast cliicken or fowl; to every f lb. of meat allow 2 oz. of ham, 3 tablespoonfuls of cream, 2 tablespoonfuls of veal gravy, h teaspoonful of minced lemon-peel; Cftyenne, salt, and pepper to taste; 1 tablespoonful of lemon-juice, 1 oz. of butter rolled in flour ; puff paste. Mode.—Mince very small the white meat from a cold roast fowl, after removing all the skin; weigh it, and to every ^ lb. of meat allow the above proportion of minced ham. Put these into a stewpan with the remaining ingredients, stir over the fire for 10 minutes or J hour, taking care that the mixture does not burn. Uoll out some puff paste about i inch in thickness; line the patty-pans with this, put upon each a small piece of bread, and cover with another layer of paste; brush over with the yolk of an egg, and bake in a brisk oven for about i hour. When done, cut a round piece out of the top, and, with a small spoon, take out the bread (be particular in not breaking the outside border of the crust), and fill the patties with the mixture. Time.—| hour to prepare the meat; not quite J hour to bake the crust. Seasonable at any time. Hatching.—Sometimes the chick within the shell is unable to break away from its prison; for the white of the egg will occasionally harden in the air to the consistence of joiners' glue, when the poor chick is in a terrible fix. An able writer says, " Assistance in hatching must not be rendered prematurely, and thence unnecessarily, but only iu the case of the chick being plainly vmable to release itself; then, indeed, an addition may probably be made to the brood, as great numbers are always lost in this way. The chick makes a circular fracture at the big end of the egg, and a section of about one-third of the length of the shell being sejparated, delivers the prisoner, provided there is uo obstruction from adhesion of the body to the membrane which lines the shell. Between the body of the chick and the membrane of the shell there exists a viscous fluid, the white of the egg thickened with the intense heat of incubation, until it becomes a positive glue. When this happens, the feathers stick fast to the shell, and the chicks remain confined, and must perish, if not released." The method of assistance to be rendered to chicks which have a difficulty in re- leasing themselves from the shell, is to take the egg in the hand, and dipping the finger or a piece of linen rag in warm water, to apply it to the fastened parts until they are loosened by the gluey substance becoming dissolved and separated from the feathers. The chick, then, being returned to the nest, will extricate itself,—a mode generally to be observed, since, if violence were used, it would prove fatal. Nevertheless, breaking the shell may sometimes be necessary; and separating with the fingers, as gently as may be, the membrane from the feathers, which are still to be moistened as mentioned above, to facihtate the operation. The points of small scissors may be useful, and when there is much resistance, as also apparent pain to the bird, the process must be conducted in the gentlest manner, and the shell separated into a number of small pieces. The signs of a need of assistance are the egg being partly pecked and chipped, and the chick discontinuing its efforts for five or six hours. Weakness from cold may disable the chicken from commencing the operation of pecking the shell, which must then be artificially performed with a circular fracture, such as is made by the bird itself.MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. CHIOKBIT OB FOWL PIE. 929. Ingeedients.—2 small fowls or 1 large one, white pepper and salt to taste, h teaspoonful of grated nutmeg, h teaspoonful of pounded mace, forcemeat 'No, 417, a few slices of ham, 3 hard-boiled eggs, i pint of water, puff crust. Mode—Sinn and cut up the fowls into joints, and put the neck, leg, and backbones in a stewpan, with a little water, an onion, a bunch of savoury herbs, and a blade of mace; let these stew for about an hour, and^ when done, strain off the liquor: this is for gravy. Put a layer of fowl at the bottom of a pie-dish, then a layer of ham, then one of forcemeat and hard-boiled eggs cut in rings;. between the layers put a seasoning of pounded mace, nutmeg, pepper, and salt. Proceed in this manner until the dish is full, and pour in about I pint of water; border the edge of the dish with puff crust, put on the cover, ornament the top, and glaze it by brushing over it the yolk of an egg. Bake from 1J to li hour, should the pie be very large, and, when done, pour in, at the top, the gravy made from the bones. If to be eaten cold, and wished particularly nice, the joints of the fowls should be boned, and placed in the dish with alternate layers of force- meat ; sausage-meat may also be substituted for the forcemeat, and is now very much used. When the chickens are boned, and mixed with sausage-meat, the pie will take about 2 hours to bake. It should be covered with a piece of paper when about half-done, to prevent the paste from being dried up or scorched. Time.—Fov a pie with unboned meat, 1| to 1J hour; with boned meat and sausage or forcemeat, 1| to 2 hours. Average cost^ with 2 fowls, 6s. 6c?. Sufficient for 6 or 7 persons. Seasonable at any time. The Young Chicks—The chicks that are hatched first should be taken from under- neath the hen, lest she might think her task at an end, and leave the remaining eggs to spoil. As soon as the young birds are taken from the mother, they must be placed in a basket lined with soft wool, flannel, or hay, and stood in the sunlight if it be summer time, or by the fire if the weather be cold. It is a common practice to cram young chicks with food as soon as they are born. This is quite unnecessary. They will, so long as they are kept warm, come to no harm if they take no food for twenty-four hours follov/ing their birth. Should the whole of the brood not be hatched by that time, those that are born may be fed with bread soaked in milk, and the yolk of a hard-boiled egg. POTTED CHICKBK Oil FOWL (a liuncheon or Breakfast Disii). 930. iNaREDiENTS.—The remains of cold roast chicken; to every lb. of meat allow j- lb. of fresh butter, salt and cayenne to taste, 1 teaspoonful of pounded mace, i small nutmeg. Mode.-Stvii^ the meat from the bones of cold roast fowl; when it i& freed from gristle and skin, weigh it, and, to evpry lb. of meat, allow447 POULTRY. the above proportion of "butter, seasoning', and spices. Cut tlie meat into small pieces, pound it well with tlie fresh butter, sprinkle in the spices gradually, and keep pounding until reduced to a per- fectly smooth paste. Put it into potting-pots for use, and cover it with clarified butter, about i inch in thickness, and, if to be kept for some time, tie over a bladder : 2 or 3 slices of ham, minced and pounded with the above ingredients, will be found an improvement. It should be kept in a dry place. tSeasonahle at any time. EEEDiisra AND Cooping the Chices.—When all the cMclrs are hatched, they should be placed along vnih the mother under a coop in a warm dry spot. If two hens happen to have their broods at the sa,me time, their respective chicks should be carefully kept separate; as, if they get mixed, and so go under the wrong coop, the hens will probably maim and destroy those who have mistaken their dwelling. After being kept snug beneath the coop for a week (the coop should be placed under cover at nightfall), the chicks may be turned loose for an hour or so in the warmest part of the day. They should be gradually weaned from the soaked bread and chopped egg, instead of whicii grits or boiled barley should be given; in 8 or 10 days their stomachs wiU be strong enough to receive bruised barley, and at the end of 3 weeks, if your chicks be healthy, they wiU be able to take care of themselves. It wiU be well, however, to keep your eye on them a week or so longer, as the elder chickens may drive them from their food. Great care should be taken that the very young chicks do not run about the wet ground or on damp grass, as this is the most prominent and fatal cause of disease. While under the coop v/ith their mother, a shallow prn or plate of water should be supplied to the chicks, as in a deeper vessel they are liable to drench themselves and take cold, or possibly to get drowned. CHICKEIT OB FOWL SALAD. 931. Ingeedients.—The remains of cold roaster boiled chicken, 2 lettuces, a little endive, 1 cucumber, a few slices of boiled beetroot, salad-dressing No. 506. 3Iode.—Trim neatly the remains of the chicken; wash, dry, and slice the lettuces, and place in the middle of a dish; put the pieces of fowl on the top, and pour the salad-dressing over them. Garnish .the edge of the salad with hard-boiled eggs cut in rings, sliced cucumber, and boiled beetroot cut in slices.

Age akd Flavour of Chickens.—It has been the opinion of the medical faculty of all ages and all countries, that the llesh of the young chicken ia the most delicate I and easy to digest of aU animal food. It is less alkalescent than the flesh of any other animal, and its entire freedom from any irritating quality renders it a fit dish, for the ailing, or those whose stomachs are naturally weak. In no animal, however, does age work such a change, in regard to the quality'of its flesh, as it does in domestic j fowls. In their infancy, cocks and hens are equally tender and toothsome ; but as time I overtakes thera it is the cock whose flesh tougheus first. A year-old cock, indeed, is fitMODERN HOUSEnOLD COOKERY. us for little else than to be converted into soup, wliile a hen at the same age, although sufficiently substantial, is not callous to the insinuations of a carving-knife. As regards capons, however, the rule respecting age does not hold good. There is scarcely to be found a more delicious animal than a well-fed, well-dressed capon. Age does i^^ot dry up his juices ; indeed, like wine, he seems but to mellow. At three years old, even, he is as tender as a chick, with the additional advantage of his proper chicken flavour being fully developed. The above remarks, however, concerning the capon, only apply to such as are naturally fed, and not crammed. The latter process may produce a handsome- loolcmg bird, and it may weigh enough to satisfy the whim or avarice of its stulFer ; but, v/hen before the fire, it will reveal the cruel treatment to which it has been subjected, and will weep a drippingpan-ful of fat tears. You will never find heart enough to place such a grief-worn guest at the head of your table. It should be borne in mind as a rule, that small-boned and short-legged poultry are likely to excel the contrary sort in delicacy of colour, flavour, and fineness of flesh. HASHED DUCK (Cold Meat Cookery), 932. Ikgeediets^ts.—The remains of cold roast duck, rather more than 1 pint of weak stock or water, 1 onion, 1 oz. of butter, thickening of butter and flour, salt and cayenne to taste, i teaspoonful of minced lemon-peel, 1 dessertspoonful of lemon-juice, \ glass of port wine. 3Iocle—Qvit the duck into nice joints, and put the trimmings into a stewpan ; slice and fry the onion in a little butter; add these to the trimmings, pour in the above proportion of weak stock or water, and stew gently for 1 hour. Strain the liquor, thicken it with butter and flour, season with salt and cayenne, and add the remaining ingre- dients ; boil it up and skim well; lay in the pieces of duck, and let them get thoroughly hot through by the side of the fire, but do not allow them to boil: they should soak in the gravy for about l hour. Garnish with sippets of toasted bread. The hash may be made richer by using a stronger and more highly-ilavoured gravy ; a little spice or pounded mace may also be added, when their llavour is liked. Time.—l^ hour. Average cost, exclusive of the cold duck, id. Seasonable from Kovember to February; ducklings from May to August. The Duck.—This bird belongs to the order of Naiaiores, or Swimmers; the most familiar tribes of which are ducks, swans, geese, auks, X3cnguins, petrels, pelicans, guille- mots, gulls, and terns. They mostly live in the water, feeding on lish, worms, and aquatic plants. They are generally polygamous, and make their nests among reeds, or in moist places. The flesh of many of the species is eatable, but that of some is extremely rank and oily. The duck is a native of Britain, but is foimd on the margins of most of the European lakes. It is excessively greedy, and by no means a nice feeder. It requires a mixture of vegetable and animal food; but aquatic insects, corn, and vegetables, are its proper food. Its flesh, however, is savoury, being not so gross as that of the goose, and of easier digestion. In the green-pea season it is usually found on an English table; but, according to Ude, " "N'ovember is its proper season, when it is plump and fat." TO KAGOUT A DUCK WHOLE. 933. Iis'GEEDiENTS.—1 large duck, pepper and salt to taste, good beef gravy, 2 onions sliced, 4 sage-leaves, a few leaves of lesnon thyme, thickening of butter and fiour. JfbfZe.—After having emptied and singed the duck, season it inside with pepper and salt, and truss it. Roast it before a clear fire for449 POULTHY. about 20 minutes, and let it acquire a nice brown colour. Put it into a stewpan with sufficient well-seasoned beef gravy to cover it; slice and fry the onions, and add these, with the sage-leaves and lemon thyme, both of which should be finely minced, to the stock. Simmer gently until the duck is tender; strain, skim, and thicken the gravy with a little butter and flour; boil it up, pour over the duck, and serve. When in season, about 14 pint of young green peas, boiled separately, and put in the ragout, very much improve this dish. Time—20 minutes to roast the duck ; 20 minutes to stew it. Average cost^ from 2s. ^cl. to 2s. 6d. each. Sufficient for 4 or 5 persons. Seasonable from November to February ; ducklings from April to August. The Buenos Atres i)vcx.—The Baenos Ayres diicliis of East-Iadian birth, and is chiefly valuable as an ornament; for we siip- pose one would as soon think of picking a Chinese teal for luncheon, or a gold fish for breakfast, as to consign the handsome Buenos Ayres to the spit. The prevailing colour of this bird is black, with a metallic lustre, and a gleaming of blue steel about its breast and wings. Vaeieties of Ducks.—Naturalists comit nearly a hundred different species of ducks; and there is no doubt that the intending keeper of these harmless and profitable birds may easily take his choice from amongst twenty different sorts. There is, however, so little difference in the vai'ious members of the BUSITOS AYEES DUCK3. family, either as regards hardiness, laying, or hatching, that the most incompetent fancier or breeder may indulge his taste without danger of making a bad bargain. In connection with their value for table, light-coloured ducks are always of milder flavour than those that are dark-coloured, the white Ayles- bury's being general favourites. Ducks reared exclusively on vegetable diet will have a whiter and more dehcate flesh than those allowed to feed on animal ofial; while the flesh of birds fattened on the latter food, will be firmer than that of those vrhich have only partaken of food of a vegetable nature. BOAST DUCKS. 934. Ingeedients.—A couple of ducks; sagc-and-onion stuffing No. 504 ; a little flour. Choosing and Trussing.—Choose ducks with plump bellies, and with thick and yellowish feet. They should be trussed with the feet on, which should be scalded, and the skin peeled ofl', and then turned up close to the legs. Run a skewer through the middle of each leg, after having drawn them as close as possible to the body, to plump up the breast, passing the same quite through the body. Out ofl; the heads and necks, and the pinions at the first joint; bring these close to the sides, twist the feet round, and truss them at the back of the bird. After the duck is stufled, both ends should be secured with string, so as to keep in the seasoning. Mode.—'Lo insure ducks being tender, never dress them the same 2 G450 MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. day they are killed ; and if the weather permits, they should hang a day or two. Make a stuffing of sage and onion sufficient for one duck, and leave the other unseasoned, as the flavour is not liked by every- body. Put them down to a brisk clear fire, and keep them well basted the whole of the time they are cooking. A few minutes before serving, dredge them lightly v/ith flour, to make them froth and look plump; and when the steam draws tov/ards the fire, send them to table hot and quickly, with a good brown gravy poured round, but not over the ducks, and a little of the same in a tureen., "When in season, green peas should invariably accompany this dish. Twne.—Fall-grown ducks from | to 1 hour; ducklings from 25 to 35 minutes. Average costy from 2s. Zd, to 25. 6d. each. Sufficient.—A. couple of ducks for 6 or 7 persons. Seasonable.—Ducklings from April to August; ducks from November to February. J>J'ote.—Ducklings are trussed and roasted in the same manner, and served with the same sauces and accompaniments. When in season, serve apple sauce. The Eouen- Buck.—Tlae Eouen, or Elione duck, is a large and handsome variety, of, Trench extraction. The plumage of the Rouen duck is somewhat sombre; its flesh is also much darker, and, though of highe^^ flavour, not near so delicate as that of our own Aylesbury. It is with this latter breed that the Rouen duck is generally mated; and the result is said to be in- crease of size and strength. In Xor- raandy and Brittany these ducks, as v/ell as other_ sorts, greatly abound; and the " duck-Hver ^a^es " are there almosf: as popular as the pate defoie gras of Stras- burg. In order to bring the Jivprx of the wretched duck to the fashion: bleand unnatural size, the same diabolical cruelty is resorted to as in the case of the Stras- burg goose. The poor birds are nailed by the feet to a board placed close to a EOUE^r BUCKS. fire, and, in that position, plentifully sup« plied with food and water. In a few days, the carcase is reduced to a mere shadow, while the liver has grown monstrously. We would rather abstain from the acquaintance of a man who ate pate de foie graSf knov/iug its component parts. Duck's EGGS.-^The ancient notion that ducks whose beaks have a tendency to curve ■upwards, are better layers than those whose beaks do not thus point, is, we need ;j hardly say, simply absurd: all ducks are good layers, if they are carefuUy fed and ;j tended. Ducks generally lay at night, or early in the morning. While they are in ' perfect health, they wiU do this ; and one of the surest signs of indisposition, among birds of this class, is irregularity in laying. The eggs laid will approach nearly the colour of the layci',—light-coloured ducks laying white eggs, and brown ducks greenish-blue egga; dark-coloured birds laying the largest eggs. One time of day the notion was prevalent .1 that a duck would hatch no other eggs than her own; and although this is not true, it will be, nevertheless, as well to match the duck's own eggs as closely as possible; for we , have known instances wherein the duck has turned out of the nest and destroyed eggs differing from her own in size and colour. DucKs.--Th© Mallard, or Wild Duck, from which is derived the domestic species, i*POULTRY. 451: 2 G 2 prevalent tlirouglioiit Europe, Asia, and America. Tlie mallard's most remarliable characteristic is one wliich sets at defiance tlie speculations of the most i^rofoundj ornithologist. The female bird is extremely plain, but the male's plumage is a splendour of greens and browns, and browns and blues. In the spring, however, the plumage of the male begins to fade, and in two months, every vestige of his finery has departed,, and he is not to be distinguished from his soberly-garbed wife. Then the greens, and the blues, and the browns begin to bud out again, and by October he is once more a gorgeous drake. It is to be regretted that domestication has seriously deteriorated the moral character of the duck. In a wild state, he is a faithful husband, desiring but one wife, and devoting himself to her; but no sooner is he domesticated than he becomes polygamous, and makes nothing of owning ten or a dozen wives at a time. As regards the females, they are much more solicitous for the welfare of their progeny in a wild, state than a tame. Should a tame duck's duckling get into mortal trouble, its mother will just signify her sorrow by an extra " quack," or so, and a flapping of her wings; but touch a wild duck's little one if you dare ! she will buffet you with her broad wings, and dash boldly at your face with her stout beak. If you search for her nest amongst the long grass, she will try no end of manoeuvres to lure you from it, her favourite ruse being to pretend lameness, to delude you into the notion that you have only to pursue her vigorously, and her capture is certain; so you persevere for half a mile or so, and then she is up and away, leaving you to find your way back to the nest if you can. Among the ancients, opinion was at variance respecting the wholesomeness and digestibility of goose flesh, but concerning the excellence of the duck all pa.rties were agreed; indeed, they not only assigned to duck-meat the palm for exquisite flavour and delicacy, they even attribtited to it medicinal powers of the highest order. ISTot only the Eoman medical, writers of the time make mention of it, but likewise the philosophers of the period,,. Plutarch assures us that Cato preserved his whole household in health, in a season when. plague and disease were rife, through dieting them on roast duck. STEWED DUCK AND PEAS (Cold Meat Cookery), 935. Iis^'GEEDiEKTS.—TliG remains of cold roast duck, 2 oz. of butter,, 3 or 4 slices of lean ham or bacon, 1 tablespoonful of flour, 2 pints of thin gravy, 1, or a small bunch of green onions, 3 sprigs of parsley,, 3 cloves, 1 pint of young green peas, cayenne and salt to taste, 1 tea- spoonful of pounded sugar. 3£ode.—Put the butter into a stewpan; cut up the duck into joints, lay them in with the slices of lean ham or bacon ; make it brown, then dredge in a tablespoonful of flour, and stir this well in before adding the gravy. Put in the onion, parsley, cloves, and gravy, and when it has simmered for J hour, add a pint of young green peas, and stew gently for about i hour. Season with cayenne, salt, and sugar; take out the duck, place it round the dish, and the peas in the middle. Ti?ne.—| hour. Average cost, exclusive of the cold duck. Is. Seasonable from June to August. DucTis Hatching.—Concerning incubation by ducks, a practised writer says, ''The duck requires a secret and safe place, rather than any attendance, and will, at nature's call, cover her eggs and seek her food. On hatching, there is not often a necessity for taking away any of the brood; and, having hatched, let the mother retain her young ones upon the nest her own time. On her moving with her brood, let a coop be prepared upon the short grass, if the weather be fine, and under shelter, if otherwise." CoopiNa A-iTD FEEDiNa DucKLiKGS.—Brood ducks should be cooped at some dis- tance from any other. A wide and flat dish of water, to be often renewed, should stand just outside the coop, and barley, or any other meal, be the first food of the ducklings. It will be needful, if it be wet weather, to clip their tails, lest these draggle, and so weaken the bird. The period of the duck's confinement to the coop will depend on the weather, and on the strength of the ducklings. A fortnight is usually the extent of time necessary, and they may even be sometimes permitted to enjoy the luxury of a swim at ;.936.

They should not, however, be allowed to stay too long in the water at first; for they will then become ill, their feathers get rough, and looseness of the bowels ensue. In the latter case, let them be closely cooped for a few days, and bean- meal or oatmeal be mixed with their ordinary food. The Atldsbury Duck.—The white Aylesbury duck is, and deservedly, a universal favourite. Its sno\vy plumage and comfortable comportment make it a credit to the poultry-yard, while its broad and deep breast, and its ample back, convey the assurance that your satisfaction will not cease at its death. In parts of Bucking- hamshire, this member of the duck fa- mily is bred on an extensive scale; not on plains and commons, however, as might be naturally imagined, but in the abodes of the cottagers. Kound the walls of the living-rooms, and of the bedroom even, are fixed rows of wooden boxes, lined with hay; and it is the business of the wife and children to nurse and com- fort the feathered lodgers, to feed the little ducklings, and to take the old ones out for an airing. Sometimes the "stock" ducks are the cottager's own property, but it more frequently happens that they are intrusted to his care by a -wholesale breeder, who pays him so much per score for all ducklings properly raised. To be perfect, the Aylesbury duck should be plump, pure white, with yellow feet, and a flesh- coloured beak. gravy, cayenne and salt to taste, 4 teaspoonful of minced lemon-peel, 1 teaspoonful of pounded sugar, 2 oz. of butter rolled in flour, pint of green peas. i)fb(fe.—Gut up the duck into joints, lay it in the gravy, and add a seasoning of cayenne, salt, and minced lemon-peel; let this gradually warm through, but not boil. Throw the peas into boiling water slightly salted, and boil them rapidly until tender. Drain them, stir in the pounded sugar, and the butter rolled in flour; shake them over the fire for two or three minutes, and serve in the centre of the dish, with the duck laid round. Time,—15 minutes to boil the peas, when they are full grown. Seasonable from June to August. PATTENiNa Ducks.—Many duck-keepers give their birds nothing in the shape of food, letting them wander about and pick up a living for themselves; and they will seem to get fat even upon this precarious feeding. Unless, however, ducks are supplied with, besides chance food, a liberal feed of solid corn, or grain, morning and evening, their flesh will become flabby and insipid. The simple way to fatten ducks is to let them have as much substantial food as they will eat, bruised oats and pea-meal being the standard fattening I'ood for them. No cramming is required, as with the turkey and some other poultry : they will cram themselves to the very verge of suffocation. At the same time, plenty of exercise and clean water should be at their service. Ameeican Mode of Capturing Ducks. — On the American rivers, the modes of capture are various. Sometimes half a dozen artificial birds are fastened to a little raft, and which is so weighted that the sham birds squat naturally on the water. This is quite sufficient to attract the notice of a passing flock, who descend to cultivate the acquaint- ance of the isolated few when the conceded hunter, with bis fowling-piece, scatters ft ATLESBUEY DUCKS.POULTRY, 453 Average cost, exclusive of the cold duck, Is.

In the winter, when the water is covered with rubble ice, the fowler of the Delaware paints his canoe entirely white, lies flat in the bottom of it, and floats with the broken ice; from which the aquatic inhabitants fail to distinguish it. So floats the canoe till he within it understands, by the quacking, and fluttering, and whirring of wings, that he is in the midst of a flock, when he is up in a moment with the murderous piece, and dying quacks and lamentations rend the still air. Bow-bill Ducks, &c.—Every one knows how aAvkward are the Anatidcc, waddling along on their unelastic webbed toes, and their short legs, which, being placed consi- derably backward, make the fore part of the body preponderate. Some, how- ever, are formed more adapted to terres- trial habits than others, and notably amongst these may be named Devdro' nessa sponsa, the summer duck of Ame- rica. This beautiful bird rears her young in the holes of trees, generally overhang- ing the water. When strong enough, the young scramble to the mouth of the hole, launch into the air with their little wings and feet spread out, and drop into their favourite element. Whenever their birthplace is at some distance from the water, the mother carries them to it, one by one, in her bill, holding them so as not to injure their yet tender frame. On several occasions, however, Avhen the hole was 30, 40, or more yards from a piece of water, Audubon observed that the mother suffered the young to fall on the grass and dried leaves beneath the tree, and afterwards led them directly to the nearest edge of the next pool or creek. There are some curious varieties of the domestic duck, which only appear interesting from their singularity, for there does not seem to be anything of use or value in the unusual characteristics which distinguish them; thus, the bow-bill duck, as shown in the engraving, called by some writers the hook-bill, is remarkable for the peculiarly strange distortion of its beak, and the tuft on the top of its head. The penguin duck, again, waddles in an upright position, like the penguin, on account of the unnatural situation of its legs. These odd peculiarities add nothing of value to the various breeds, and may be set down as only the result of accidental mal- formation, transmitted from generation to generation. good gravy, 4 shalots, a few slices of carrot, a small bunch of savoury herbs, 1 blade of pounded mace, 1 lb. of turnips, weighed after being peeled, 2 oz. of butter, pepper and salt to taste. diode.—Cut up the duck into joints, fry the shalots, carrots, and herbs, and put them, with the duck, into the gravy ; add the pounded mace, and stew gently for 20 minutes or h hour. Cut about 1 lb. of turnips, weighed after being peeled, into ^-inch squares, put the butter into a stewpan, and stew them till quite tender, which will be in about | hour, or rather more; season with pepper and salt, and serve in the centre of the dish, with the duck, &c. laid round. Thne.—Eather more than | hour to stew the turnips. Seasonable from November to February. The Wild Duck.—In many parts of England the wild duck is to be found, especially in those desolate fenny parts where water abounds. In Lincolnshire they are plentiful, and are annually taken in the decoys, which consist of ponds situate in the marshes, and BOW-BILL DUCKS.MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. 454: •surrounded with wood or reeds to prevent the birds which frequent them from, being disturbed. In these the birds sleep during the day; and as soon as evening sets in, the ■decot/ rises, and the wild fowl feed daring the night. Now is the time for the deeoy ducks to entrap the others. From the ponds diverge, in dilFerent directions, certain oanals, at the end of v/hich funnel nets are placed; along these the deeoi/ diichs, trained for the purpose, lead the others in search of food. After they have got a certain length, a decoy-man appears, and drives them further on, until they are finally taken in the nets. It is from these decoys, in Lincolnshire, that the London market is mostly suijplied. The Chinese have a singular mode of catching these ducks. A person wades in the water up to the chin, and, having his head covered with au empty calabash, a^pproaches the place where the ducks are. As the birds have no suspicion of the nature of the object v/hich is concealed under the calabash, they sUfler its approach, and allow it to move at will among their llock. The man, accordingly, walks about in the midst of his ganae, and, whenever he pleases, pulls them by the legs under the water, and fixes them to his belt, until he has secured as many as he requires, and then moves olf as he went amongst them, without exciting the slightest suspicion of the trick he has been playing them. This singular mode of duck-hunting is also practised on the Ganges, the earthen vessels of the Hindoos being used instead of calabashes. These vessels, being those in which the inhabitants boil their rice, are considered, after once being used, as defiled, and are accordingly thrown into the river. The duck-takers, finding them suitable for their purpose, put them on their heads ; and as the ducks, from seeing them constantly floating down the stream, are familiar with their appearance, they regard them as objects from which no danger is to be expected. Dtjck-snaees is the LnrcoLHSHiEE Fens.—The following interesting account of 2iow duck-snaring used to be managed in the Lincolnshire fens, was published some years ago, in a work entitled the " Feathered Tribes."—" In the lakes to which they resorted, their favourite haunts were observed, and in the most sequestered part of a haunt, a pipe or ditch was cut across the entrance, decreasing gradually in width from the entrance to the further end, which was not more than two feet wide. The ditch was of a circular form, but did not bend much for the first ten yards. The banks of the lake on each side of the ditch were kept clear of weeds and close herbage, in order that the ducks might get on them to sit and dress themselves. Along the ditch, poles were driven into the ground close to the edge on each side, and the tops were bent over across the ditch and tied together. The poles then bent forward at the entrance to the ditch, and formed an arch, the top of which was ten feet distant from the surface of the water; the arch was made to decrease in height as the ditch decreased in width, so that the remote end was not more than eighteen inches in height. The poles were placed about six feet from each other, and connected by poles laid lengthwise across the arch, and tied together. Over the whole was thrown a net, which was made fast to a reed fence at the entrance and nine or ten yards up the ditch, and afterwards strongly j)egged to the ground. At the end of the ditch furthest from the entrance, was fixed what was called a tunnel-net, of about four yards in length, of a round form, and kept open by a number of hoops about eighteen inches in diameter, placed at a small distance from each other to keep it distended. Supposing the circular bend of the ditch to be to the right, when one stands with his back to the lake, then on the left-hand side, a number of reed fences were constructed, called shootings, for the purpose of screening the decoy-man from observation, and, in such a manner, that the fov/1 in the decoy would not be alarmed while he was driving those that were in the pipe. These shootings, which were ten in number, were about four yards in length and about six feet high. From the end of the last shooting a person could not see the lake, owing to the bend of the ditch ; and there was then no further occasion for shelter. Were it not for these shootings, the fowl that remained about the mouth of the ditch would have been alarmed, if the person driving the fowl already under the net should have been exposed, and would have become so shy as entirely to forsake the place." The Decoy-matt, Dog, and Ducks.—" The first thing the decoy-man did, on ap- roaching the ditch, was to take a piece of lighted peat or turf, and to hold it near is mouth, to prevent the birds from smelling him. He was attended by a dog trained to render him assistance. He walked very silently about halfway up the shootings, where a small piece of v/ood was thrust through the reed fence, which made an aperture just large enough to enable him to see if there were any fowl wifhin; if not, he walkedPOULTRY. 455 to see if any were about the entrance to the ditch. If there were, he stopped, made a motion to his dog, and gave him a piece of cheese to eat, when the dog went directly to a hole through the reed fence, and the birds immediately flew oif the bank into the water. The dog returned along the bank between the reed fences, and came out to his master at another hole. The man then gave the dog something more to encourage him, and the dog repeated his rounds, till the birds were attracted by his motions, and followed him into the mouth of the ditch—an operation which was called ' working them.* The man now retreated further back, working the dog at different holes, until the ducks were sufficiently under the net. He then commanded his dog to lie down under the fence, and going himself forward to the end of the ditch next the lake, he took off his hat, and gave it a wave between the shootings. All the birds that were under the net could then see him, but none that were in the lake could. The former flew forward, and the man then ran to the next shooting, and waved his hat, and so on, driving thera along until they came into the tunnel-net, into which they crept. When they were all in, the man gave the net a twist, so as to prevent them getting back. He then took the net off from the end of the ditch, and taking out, one by one, the ducks that were in it, dislocated their necks,'* BOILED FOWLS OB CHICKENS. 938. Ingeedients.—A pair of fowls ; water. Choosing and Trussing,—In choosing- fowls for boiling, it should be borne in mind that those that are not black-legged are generally much whiter when dressed. Pick, draw, singe, wash, and truss them in the following manner, without the livers in the wings ; and, in drav/ing, bo careful not to break the gall-bladder:—Cutoff the neck, leaving sufficient skin to skewer back. Cut the feet off to the first joint, tuck the stumps into a slit made on each side of the belly, twist the wings over the back of the fowl, and secure the top of the leg and the bottom of the wing together by running a skewer through them and the body. The other side must be done in the same manner. Should the fowl be very large and old, draw the sinews of the legs before tucking them in. Make a slit in the apron of the fowl, large enough to admit the parson's nose, and tie a string on the tops of the logs to keep them in their proper place. Mode.—When they are firmly trussed, put them into a stewpan with plenty of hot water; bring it to boil, and carefully remove all the scum as it rises. Simmer very ge7itly until the fowl is tender, and bear in mind that the slower it boils, the plumper and whiter will the fowl be. Many cooks wrap them in a floured cloth to preserve the colour, and to prevent the scum from clinging to them; in this case, a few slices of lemon should be placed on the breasts; over these a sheet of buttered paper, and then the cloth ; cooking them in this manner renders the flesh very white.

There is little doubt, however, that, like the dog, it has been attached to mankind ever since mankind were attached to civilization. Although the social posi- tion of this bird is, at the present time, highly respectable, it is nothing to what it was when Kome was mistress of the world. Writing at that period, Pliny says, respecting the domestic cock, The gait of the cock is proud and commanding; he walks with head erect and elevated crest; alone, of all birds, he habitually looks up to the sky, raising, at the same time, his curved and scythe- formed tail, and inspiring terror in the lion himself, that most intrepid of ani- mals. * * They regulate the conduct of our magistrates, and open or close to them their own houses. They prescribe rest or movement to the Eoman fasces : they command or prohibit battles. In a word, they lord it over the masters of the world." As well among the ancient Greeks as the Eomans, was the cock regarded with respect, and even awe. The former people practised divinations by means of this bird. Supposing there to be a doubt in the camp as to the fittest day to light a battle, the letter of every day in the week would be placed face downwards, and a grain of corn placed on each; then the sacred cock would be let loose, and, according to the letters he pecked his corn from, so would the battle-time be regulated. On one momentous occasion, however, a person inimical to priestly interest officiously examined the grain, and found that those lying on the letters not wanted were made of wax, and the birds, preferring the true grain, left these untouched. It is needless to add that, after this, divination through the medium of cocks and grain fell out of fashion. Whether or no the learned fowl above aUuded to were of the "game" bi'eed, is I unknown; but that the birds were bred for the inhuman sport of fighting many hundred years before the Christian era, there can be no doubt. Themistocles, the Athenian king, who flourished more than two thousand years ago, took advantage of the sight of a pitched battle between two cocks to harangue his soldiers on courage. "Observe," said he, "with what intrepid valour they fight, inspired by no^ other motive than love of victory; whereas you have to contend for your religion and your libert}'', for your wives and children, and for the tombs of your ancestors." And to this day his courage has not degenerated. He still preserves his bold and elegant gait, his sparkling eye, while his wedge-shaped beak and cruel spurs are ever ready to support his defiant crow. It is no wonder that the breed is not plentiful—first, on account of the few eggs laid by the hen; and, secondly, from the incurable pugnacity of the chicks. Half-fledged broods may be found blind as bats from fighting, and only waiting for the least glimmer of sight to be at it again. Without doubt, the flesh of game fowls is every way superior to that of every chicken of the family. BKOILED FOWL AISTD MUSHROOM SAXJCB. 939.

The jBantaim.—No one will dispute that for beauty, animation, plumage, and eouraf^e the Bantam is entitled to rank next to the game fowl. As its name undoubtedly implies, the bird is of Asiatic origin. The choicest sorts are the butF-coloured, and those that are entirely black. A year-old "Bantam cock of pure breed wiU not weigh more than six- teen ounces. Despite its small size, however, it is marvellously bold, especially in defence of its progeny. A friend of the writer's, re- siding at Kensington, possessed a pair of thorough-bred Bantams, that were allowed the range of a yard where a fierce bull-terrier was kennelled. The hen had chicks; and, when about three weeks old, one of them strayed into the dog-kennel. The grin baast within took no notice of the t'ny fiedf,eing; but, when the anxious mother ventured in to fetch out the truant, with a growl the dog woke, and nearly snapped her asunder in his great jaws. The cock bii'd saw the tragic fate of its partner; but, nothing daunted, flew at the dog with a fierce cry, and pecked savagely at its face. The odds, however, were too great; and, when the tenner had sufficiently recovered from the astonishment caused by the sudden and unexpected attack, he seized the audacious Bantam, and sbook him to death ^ and, in five minutes, the devoted couple were entombed in Finelier's capacious maw. black; bantams.

The DoRKiwa.—This bird takes its name from tliat of a town in Surrey, where the breed is to be found in greater numbers, and certainly in greater perfection, than else- where. It is generally believed that this particular branch of poultry was found in the town above mentioned as long aga as the Roman era. The Dorking's chief characteristic is that he has five claws on each foot; the extra claw, however, is never of sufficient length to encumber the foot, or to cause it to "drag" its nest, or scratch out the eggs. The colour of the true Dorking is pure white; long in the body, short in the legs, and a prolific layer. Thirty years ago, there was much eontrovers}' respecting the ori- gin of the Dorking. The'men of Sussex declared that the bird belonged to them, and brought birds indigenous to their weald, and possessing all the Dorking fine points and peciiliarities, in proof of the declaration. Others inclined to the belief that the Poland bird was the father of the Dorking, and not without at least a show of reason, as the former bird much resembles the latter in shape ; and, despite its sombre hue, it is well known that the Poland cock will occasionally beget thorough white stock from white English hens. The commotion has, hovrever, long ago subsided, and Dorking still retains its fair reputation for fowl, CTIBBIED FOWL. 941.

The Poland.—This bu-d, a native of Holland, is a great favourite with fowl-keepers, especially those who have an eye to profit rather than to amusement. Those varieties known as the "silver spangled" and the "gold spangled" are handsome enough to please the most fastidious ; but the common black breed, with the bushy crown of wliit© leathers, is but a plain bird. The chief value of the common Poland lies in the great459 POULTRY. tinniber of eggs they produce; indeed, in man)- parts, they are as well Itnown^a ^'^everlasting layers" as by their proper name. Ilovvever, the experienced brceoer would take good care to send the eggs of his everlasting layers to market, and not use them for home consumption, as, although they may be as large as thoso laid by other hens, the amount of nutri- ment contained in them is not nearly so great. Mr. Mowbray once kept an ac- count of the number of eggs produced by this prolific bird, with the following result:—From the 25th of October to the 25th of the follomng September five hens laid 503 eggs; the average weiglit of each egg was one ounce five drachms, and the total weight of the whole, exclu- sive of the shells, 50$ pounds. Taking the weight of the birds at the fair average of five pounds each, we thus see them producing withiu a year double their spangled eolands. weight of egg alone; and, supposing every egg to contain a chick, and allowing the chick to grow, in less than eighteen months from the laying of the first egg, two thousand Jioe hundred pounds of chicken-m«at would be the result. The Poland is easily fattened, and its flesh is generally considered juicier and of richer flavour than most others. CUimiED FOWL OR OHICKEH (Cold Meat Cookery). 942.

The Cochht-Chijta.—About fifteen years ago, the arrival of this distinguished Asiatic created in England as great a sensation as might be expected from the landing of aa invading host. The first pair that ever made their appearance here were na- tives of Shanghai, and were presented to the queen, who exhibited them at the Dublin poultry-show of 1846. Then began the " Cochin "furor. As soon as ifc was discovered, despite the most strenuous endeavours to keep the tremendous secret, that a certain dealer was pos- sessed of a pair of these birds, straight- way the avenues to that dealer's shop were blocked by broughams, and cha- riots, and hack cabs, until the shy poulterer had been tempted by a suffi- ciently high sum to part with his trea- sure._ Bank-notes were exchanged for Cochin chicks, and Cochin eggs were in as great demand as though they had "been laid by the fabled golden goose.

For elegance of shape or quality of flesh, the Cocliin cannot for a moment stand comparison with our handsome dunghill; neither can the indescribable mixture of growling and braying, peculiar to the former, vie with the musical trumpeting of our own morning herald : yet our poultry-breeders have been immense gainers by the intro- duction of the ungainly celestial, inasmuch as 7iew blood has been infused into the English chicken family.

Space for Eow^ls.—We are no advocates for converting the domestic fowl into a cage-bird. We have known amateur fowl-keepers—worthy souls, who would butter the very barley they gave their pets, if they thought they would the more enjoy it—coop up a male bird and three or four hens in an ordinary egg-chest placed on its side, and with the front closely barred with iron hooping! This system will not do. Every animal, from man himself to the guinea-pig, must have what is vulgarly, but truly, known as " elbow-roomand it must be self-evident how emphatically this rule applies to winged animals. It may be urged, in the case of domestic fowls, that from constant disuse, and from clipping and plucking, and other sorts of maltreatment, their wings can hardly be regarded as instruments of fiigh*!^ we maintain, however, that you may jjluck a fowl's wing-joints as bare as a pumpkin, but you will not erase from his memory that he is a fowl, and that his proper sphere is the open air. If he likewise reflects that he is an ill-used fowl—a prison-bird—he will then come to the conclusion, that there is not the least use, under such circumstances, for his existence; and you must admit that the decision is only logical and natural.

The Fowl-house.—In building a fowl-house, take care that it be, if ^oossible, built against a wall or fence that faces the soidJi, and thus insure its inmates agamst many cold winds, driving rains, and sleets they will otherwise suffer. Let the floor of the house slope half an inch to the foot from back to front, so as to insure drainage; let it also be close, hard, and perfectly smooth; so that it may be cleanly swept out. A capital plan is to mix a few bushels of chalk and dry earth, spread it over the floor, and pay a paviour's labourer a trifle to hammer it level with his rammer. The fowl-house should be seven feet high, and furnished with perches at least two feet apart. The perches must be level, and not one above the other, or unpleasant consequences may ensue to the undermost row. The perches should be ledged (not fixed—^just dropped into sockets, that they may be easily taken out and cleaned) not lower than five feet from the ground, convenient slips of wood being driven into the waU, to render the ascent as easy as possible. The front of the fowl-house should be latticed, taking care that the interstices be not wide enough even to tempt a chick to crawl through. STesting-boxes, containing soft hay, and fitted against the walls, so as to be easily reached by the perch-ladder, should be supplied. It will be as well to keep by you a few portable doors, so that you may hang one before the entrance to a nesting-box, when the hen goes in to sit. This will prevent other hens from intruding, a habit to which some are much addicted, I FHICASSEED FOWL OR CHICKEIsr (an Entree). 945.

Put the trimmings, with the necks and legs, into a stewpan ; add the parsley, onions, clove, mace, shalot, bay-leaf, and a seasoning of pepper and salt; pour to these the water that the chickens were blanched in, and simmer gently for rather more than 1 hour.

Si/fficient.—l large fowl for one entree. Seasonable at any time. Stocking the Fowl-house.—Take care that the birds with which you stock your house are young. The surest indications of old age are fading of the comb and gills from brilliant red to a dingy brick-colour, general paleness of plumage, brittleness of the feathers, length and size of the claws, and the scales of the legs and feet assuming a ragged and corny appearance. Your cock and hens should be as near two years old as possible. Hens will lay at a year old, but the eggs are always insignificant in size, and the layers giddy and unsteady sitters. The hen-bird is in her prime for breeding at three years old, and will continue so, under favourable circumstances, for two years longer ; after which she will decline. Crowing hens, and those that have large combs, are generally looked on with mistrust; but this is mere silliness and siiperstition—though it is possible that a spruce young cock would as much object to a s^Douse with such peculiar addictions, as a young fellow of our own species wouJd to a damsel who whistled and who wore v/hiskers. Fowls with yellow legs should be avoided; they are generally of a tender constitution, loose-fleshed, and of indifferent flavour. FBIOASSESD FOWL (Cold Meat Cookery). 946.

Chaeacxeiiistics of Health and Powee.—The chief characteristics of health in a fowl are brightness and dryness of eye and nostrils, the comb and wattles firm and ruddy, the feathers elastic and glossy. The most useful cock is generally the greatest tyrant, who struts among his hens despotically, with his head erect and his eyes ever watchful. There is likely to be handsomer and stronger chicks in a house where a bold, active— even savage—bird reigns, than vrhere the lord of the hen-house is a weak, meek creature, who bears the abuse and peckings of his wives without a remonstrance. I much prefer dark-coloured cock-birds to those of light plumage. A cock, to be handsome, should be of middling size ; his bill should be short, comb bright-red, wattles large, breast broad, and wings strong. His head should be rather small than otherwise, his legs short and sturdy, and his spurs well-formed; his feathers should be short and close, and the more frequently and heartily he crows, the better father he is likely to become. The common error of choosing hens above the ordinary stature of their respective varieties should be avoided, as the best breeding-hens are those of medium size.rOULTRY. m FRIED FOWLS (Cold Meat Cookery).

I occurrence with him to conceive a sudden and violent disHke for one or more of his I wives, and not allow the obnoxious ones to approach within some distance of the others; ! indeed, I know many cases where the capricious tyrant has set upon the innocent cause of his resentment and killed her outright. In all such cases, the hen objected to should be removed and replaced by another. If the cock should, by any accident, get killed, considerable delicacy is required in introducing a new one. The hens may mope, and refuse to associate with their new husband, clustering in corners, and making odious comparisons between him and the departed; or the cock may have his own peculiar notions as to what a wife should be, and be by no means satisfied with those you have provided him. The plan is, to keep him by himself nearly the whole day, supplying him plentifully vdVa. exhilarating food, then to turn him loose among the hens, and to continue this practice, allowing him more of the society of his wives each day, until you suffer him to abide with them altogether.

Various Modes ov Fattenino Fov7ls.—It would, I think, be a difficult matter to find, among the entire fraternity of fowl-keepers, a dozen whose mode of fattening " stock" is the same. Some say that the grand secret is to give them abundance of saccharine food J others say nothing beats heavy corn steeped in milkj while another breeder,MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. celebrated in his day, and the recipient of a gold medal from a learned society, says, " The best method is as follows :—The chickens are to be taken from the hen the night after they are hatched, and fed with eggs hard-boiled, chopped, and mixed with crumbs of bread, as larks and other small birds are fed, for the first fortnight; after which give them oatmeal and treacle mixed so as to crumble, of which the chickens are very fond, and thrive so fast that, at the end of two months, they will be as large as full-grown fowls." Others there are who insist that nothing beats oleaginous diet, and cram their birds with ground oats and suet. But, whatever the course of diet favoured, on one point they seem agreed; and that is, that, while fattening, the fowls should he Tcept in the dark. Supposing the reader to be a dealer,—a breeder of gross chicken-meat for the market (against which supposition the chances are 10,000 to 1), and beset with as few scruples as generally trouble the huckster, the advice is valuable. *' l^augh and grow fat" is a good maxim enough j but Sleep and grow fat" is, as is well known to folks of porcine attributes, a better. The poor birds, immured in their dark dungeons, ignorant that there is life and sunshine abroad, tuck their heads under their wings and make a long night of it; while their digestive organs, having no harder work than to pile up fat, have an easy time enough. But, unless we are mistaken, he who breeds poultry for lus own eating, bargains for a more substantial reward than the questionable pleasure of burying his carving-knife in chicken grease. Tender, deUcate, and nutritious fiesh is the great aim; and these qualities, I can affirm without fear of contradiction, were never attained by a dungeon-fatted chicken; perpetual gloom and darkness is as incompatible with chicken life as it is wdth human. If you wish to be convinced of the absurdity of endeavouring to thwart nature's laws, plant a tuft of grass, or a cabbage- plant, in the darkest corner of your coal-cellar. The plant or the tuft may increase in length and breadth, but its colour will be as wan and pale, almost, as would be your own face under the circumstances. POULET A LA MABENGO. 949.

The fowl was procured, but there was no butter at hand, and unluckily none could be found in the neighbourhood. There was oil in abundance, however; and the cook having poured a certain quantity into his skillet, put in the fowl, with a clove of garlic and other seasoning, with a little white wine, the best the country afforded; he then gar- nished it with mushrooms, and served it up hot. This dish proved the second conquest of the day, as the first consul found it most agreeable to his palate, and expressed hia satisfaction.

The _ BEST Yf ay to Fatteit Fowls.—The barn-door fowl is in itself a completo refutation of the cramming and dungeon policy of feeding practised by some. This fowl, which has the common run of the farm-yard, living on dairy-scraps and olfal from the stable, begins to grow fat at threshing-time. He has his fill of the finest corn; he has his fill of fresh air and natural exercise, and at last he comes smoking to the table,— a dish for the gods. In the matter of unnaturally stuffing and confining fowds, Mowbray is exactly of our opinion. He says : " The London chicken-butchers, as they are termed, are said to be, of all others, the most expeditious and dexterous feeders, putting up a coop of fowls, and making them thorougldy fat within the si^ace of a fortnight, using much grease, and that perhaps not of the most delicate kind, in the food. In this way I have no boasts to make, having always found it necessa.ry to allow a considerable number of weeks for the purpose of making fowds fat in coops. In the common way this business is often badly managed, fowls being huddled together in a smaR coop, tearing each other to pieces, instead of enjoying that repose w^hich alone can insure the wished-for object—irregularly fed and cleaned, imtil they become so stenched and poisoned in their own excrement, that their flesh actually smells and tastes when smoking upon the table," Sussex produces the fattest and largest poultry of any county^ in England, and the fatting x^rocess there most common is to give them a gruel made of pot-liquor and bruised oats, with which are mixed hog's grease, sugar, and milk. The foAvls are kept very warm, and crammed morning and night. They are put into the coop, and kept there two or three days before the cramming begius, and then it is con- tinued for a fortnight, and the birds are sent to market, RAGOUT OF FOWL. 051.

The best Fowls to Fatteit, &c.—The chicks most likely to fatten well are those first hatched in the brood, and those with the shortest legs. Long-legged fowls, as a, rule, are by far the most difficult to fatten. The most delicate sort are those which are put up to fatten as soon as the hen forsakes them; for, as says an old writer, "then they wiU be in fine condition, and full of flesh, which flesh is afterwards expended in the exercise of foraging for food, and in the increase of stature; and it may be a work of some weeks to recover it,—especially with young cocks." But whether you take them in hand as chicks, or not till they are older, the three prime rules to be obseryed are, sound and various food, warmth, and cleanliness. There is nothing that a fatting fowl grows so fastidious about as his water. If water any way foul be offered him, he will not drink it, but sulk with his food, and pine, and you all the while wondering the reason why. Keep them separate, allowing to each bird as much space as you can spare. Spread the ground with sharp sandy gravel; take care that they are not dis- turbed. In addition to their regular diet of good corn, make them a cake of ground oats or beans, brown sugar, milk, and mutton suet. Let the cake lie till it is stale, then crumble it, and give each bird a gill-measureful morning and evening. No entire grain should be given to fowls during the time they are fattening; indeed, the secret of success lies in supplying them vnth the most nutritious food without stint, and in such a form that their digestive mills shall find no difficulty in grinding it. BOAST FOV^LS, 952. Ingeedients.—A pair of fowls ; a little flour. 3£ode,—Fowls to be tender should he killed a couple of days before they are dressed ; when the feathers come out easily, then let them be picked and cooked. In drawing them, be careful not to break the gall-bag, as, wherever it touches, it would impart a very bitter taste; the liver and gizzard should also be preserved. Truss them in the following manner:—After having carefully picked them, cut off the head, and skewer the skin of the neck down over the back. Cut off the claws; dip the legs in boiling water, and scrape them; turn the pinions under, run a skewer through them and the middle of the legs, which should be passed through the body to the pinion and leg on the other side, one skewer securing the limbs on both sides. The liver and gizzard should be placed in the wings, the liver on one side and the gizzard on the other. Tie the legs together by passing a trussing-needle, threaded with twine, through the backbone, and secure it on the other side. If trussed like a capon, the legs are placed more apart. When firmly trussed, singe them all over; put them down to a bright clear fire, paper the breasts with a sheet of buttered paper, and keep the fowls well basted. Roast them for fhour, more or less, according467 POULTRY. to the size, and 10 minutes before serving*, remove the paper, dredge the fowls with a little fine flonr, put a piece of butter into the basting- ladle, and as it melts, baste the fowls with it; when nicely frothed and of a rich colour, serve with good brown gravy, a little of which should be poured over the fowls, and a tureen of well-made bread sauce, No. 371. Mushroom, oyster, or egg sauce are very suitable accompaniments to roast fowl.—Chicken is roasted in the same manner. Time.—A very large fowl, quite 1 hour, medium-sized one | hour, chicken J hour, or rather longer. Average cost, in full season, 5s. a pair; when scarce, 75. 6d. the pair. Sufficient for 6 or 7 persons. Seasonable all the year, but scarce in early spring. The Diseases of Fowls, and how to Cure thejj:.—The diseases to wLieli Gallus domesiicus is chiefly liable, are roup, pip, scouring, and chip. The first-mentioned is the most common of all, and results from cold. The ordinary symptoms,—swollen eyes, running at the nostrils, and the i)urple colour of the >Yattles. Part birds so affected from the healthy ones, as, when the disease is at its height it is as contagious as glanders among horses. Wash out the nostrils with warm water, give daily a peppercorn in- closed in dough; bathe the eyes and nostrils with warm milk and water. If the head is much swollen, bathe with warm brandy and water. When the bird is getting well, put half a spoonful of sulphur in his drinking-water. Some fanciers prescinbe for this disease half a spoonful of table salt, dissolved in half a gill of water, in which rue has been steeped; others, pills composed of ground rice and fresh butter: but the remedy first mentioned will be found far the best. As there is a doubt respecting the whole- someness of the eggs laid by roupy hens, it will be as well to throw them away. The pip is a white horny skin growing on the tip of the bird's tongue. It should be removed with the point of a penknife, and the place rubbed with salt. FOV/L AND BICU OKOQUETTSS (an Sntree). 953. Ingeedients.—I lb. of rice, 1 quart of stock or broth, 3 oz. of butter, minced fowl, egg, and bread crumbs. Mode.—Put tho rice into the above proportion of cold stock or broth, and let it boil very gently for i hour ; then add the butter, and simmer it till quite dry and soft. When cold, make it into balis^ hollow out the inside, and fill with minced fowl made by recipe No. 956. The mince should be rather thick. Cover over with rice, dip the balls into egg, sprinkle them with bread crumbs, and *fry a nice brown. Dish them, and garnish with fried parsley. Oysters, white sauce, or a little cream, may be stirred into the rice before it cools. Time.—i hour to boil the rice, 10 minutes to fry the croquettes. Average cost, exclusive of the fowl, 8d. Seaso7iahle at any timoo Chip.—If tiie birds are allowed to paddle about on wet soil, or to be much out in the rain, they will get "chip." Young chicks are especially liable to this complaint. They will sit shivering in out-of-the-way corners, perpetually uttering a dolorous " chip, chip;" seemingly frozen with cold, though, on handling them, they are found to be in high fever. A wholesale breeder would take no pains to attempt the cure of fowls so afflicted; but they who keep chickens for the pleasure, and not for the profit they yield.MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. 468 will be inclmed to recover them if possible. Give tliem none but warm food, lialf a peppercorn rolled in a morsel of dough every night, and a little nitre in their water. Above all, keep them warm; a corner in the kitchen fender, for a day or two, will do more to effect a cure than the run of a druggist's warehouse. CBOaUETTES OP FOWL (an Entree). 954. Ingredients.-—3 or 4 slialots, 1 oz. of butter, 1 teaspoonful of flour, white sauce; pepper, salt, and pounded mace to taste; 4 tea- spoonful of pounded sugar, the remains of cold roast fowls, the yolks of 2 eggs, egg, and bread crumbs. Mode.—Mince the fowl, carefully removing all skin and bone, and fry the shalots in the butter ; add the minced fowl, dredge in the flour, put in the pepper, salt, mace, pounded sugar, and sufficient white sauce to moisten it; stir to it the yolks of 2 well-beaten eggs, and set it-by to cool. Then make tht3 mixture up into balls, egg and bread-crumb them, and fry a nice brown. They may be served on a border of mashed potatoes, with gravy or sauce in the centre. Time.—10 minutes to fry the balls. Seasonable at any time. The Tuen".—What is termed " turrling" with song-birds, is known, as regard fowls, as the *' turn." Its origin is the same in both cases,—over-feeding and want of exercise. Without a moment's warning, a fowl so afilicted will totter and fall from its perch, and unless assistance be at hand, speedily give up the ghost. The veins of the palate should be opened, and a few drops^ of a mixture composed of six parts of sweet nitre and one of ammonia, poured down its throat. I have seen ignorant keepers plunge a bird, stricken with the '* turn," into cold water; but I never saw it taken out again ahve; and for a good reason: the sudden chill has the effect of driving the blood to the head,—of aggravating the disease indeed, instead of relieving it. HASHED FOWL—an Entree (Cold Meat Cookery). 955. Ingredients.—The remains of cold roast fowl, 1 pint of water, 1 onion, 2 or three small carrots, 1 blade of pounded mace, pepper and salt to taste, 1 small bunch of savoury herbs, thickening of butter and flour, li tablespoonful of mushroom ketchup. Ifode.—Cut off the best joints from the fowl, and the remainder make into gravy, by adding to the bones and trimmings a pint oi water, an onion sliced and fried of a nice brown, the carrots, mace, seasoning, and herbs. Let these stew gently for Ij hour, strain the liquor, and thicken with a little flour and butter.

Mix-half a teaspoouful of hydro- oxalic acid with twelve teaspoonfuls of water,—apply to the itching parts with an old shaving-brush. Obstetjction" the Chop.—Obstruction of the crop is occasioned by wealniess or greediness. You may know when a bird is so afflicted by his crop being distended almost to bursting. Mowbray tells of a hen of his in this predicament; when the crop was opened, a quantity of new beans were discovered in a state of vegetation. The crop should be sHt from the bottom to the top with a sharp pair of scissors, the contents taken out, and the slit sewed up again with tine white thread. MINCED FOWL—an Entree (Cold Meat Cookery}. 956. I^-GEEDiENTS.—The remains of cold roast fowl, 2 hard-boiled eggs, salt, cayenne, and ponnded mace, 1 onion, 1 faggot of savoury- herbs, 6 tablespoonfuls of cream, 1 oz. of butter, two teaspoonfuls of flour, i teaspoonful of finely-minced lemon-peel, 1 tablespoonful of lemon-juice. 3Iode.—Cut out from the fowl all the white meat, and mince it finely without any skin or bone ; put the bones, skin, and trimmings into a stewpan with an onion, a bunch of savoury herbs, a blade of mace, and nearly a pint of water; let this stew for an hour, then strain the liquor. Chop the eggs small; mix them with the fowl; add salt, cayenne, and pounded mace, put in the gravy and remaining ingredients; let the whole just boil, and serve with sippets of toasted bread. Time.—Rdithev more than 1 hour. Average cost, exclusive of the fowl, 8f?. Seasonable at any time. Note.—Another way to make this is to mince the fowl, and warm it in white sauce or Bechamel. When dressed like this, 3 or 4 poached eggs may be placed on the top : o^^sters, or chopped mushrooms, or balls of oyster forcemeat, may be laid round the dish. The Moulting Seasoit.—During the moulting season, beginning properly at the end of September, the fowls will require a httle extra attention. Keep them dry and warm, and feed them liberally on warm and satisfying food. If in any fowl the moult should seem protracted, examine it for broken feather-stumps still bedded in the skin: if you lind any, extract them carefully with a pair of tweezers. If a fowl is hearty and strong, six weeks will see him out of his trouble; if he is weakly, or should take cold during the time, he will not thoroughly recover in less than three months. It is seldom or ever that hens will lay during the moult; while the cock, during the same period, will give so Httle of his consideration to the frivolities of love, that you may as well, nay, much better, keep him by himself till he perfectly recovers, A moulting chicken makca but a sorry dish.

The Scour or Dysentery.—The scour, or dysentery, or diarrhcea, is induced variously. A sudden alteration in diet will cause it, as will a superabundance of green food. The best remedy is a piece of toasted biscuit sopped in ale. If the disease has too tight a hold on the bird to be quelled by this^ give six drops of syrup of white poppies and six drops of cantor-oil, naixed with a little oatmeal or gi^ound rice. Eestrict the bird's diet, for a few days, to dry food,—crushed beans or oats, stale bread- crumbs, &c. FOWL SCOLLOPS (Cold Meat Cookery). 958.

When quite hot, serve, and garnish the dish with rolled ham or bacon toasted. Time.—1 minute to simmer the slices of fowl. Seasonable at any time. The Feather-legged Bajs^tam.—Since the introduction of the Bantam into Europe, it has ramified into many varieties, none of which are destitute of elegance, and some, indeed, remarkable for their beauty. AH are, or ought to be, of small size, but lively and vigorous, exhibiting in their move- ments both grace and stateliness. The variety shown in the engraving is remarkable for the tarsiy or beams of the legs, being plumed to the toes, with stiff, long feathers, which brush the ground. Owing, possibly, to the little care taken to preserve this variety from admixture, it is now not frequently seen. Another variety is often red, with a black breast and single dentated comb. The tani are smooth, and of a dusky blue. When this sort of Bantam is pure, it yields in courage and spirit to none, and is, in fact, a game-fowl in miniature, being as beautiful and graceful as it is spirited. A pure white Bantam, possessing all the quanlications just named, is also bred iu the royal aviary at Windsor. AlSr IHDIAIT DISH OB' FOWL (an Entree). A 959.

The Speckled HAMBUBG.--Of the specliled, or spangled Hamburg, whicli is a favourite breed witb many persons, there are two Tarieties,—the golden-speckled and the silver-speckled. The general colour of the former is golden, or orange-yel- low, each feather having a glossy dark brown or black tip, i)articularly remark- able on the hackles of the cock and the wing-coverts, and also on the darker feathers of the breast. The female is yellow, or orange-brown, the feathers in like manner being margined with black. The Silver-si:)eckied variety is distin- guished by the ground-colour of the plumage being of a silver-white, ynth. perhaps a tinge of straw-ycilow, every leather being margined with a semi-lunar mark of glossy black. Both of these varieties are extremely beautiful, the hens laying freely. First-rate birds com- mand a high price.

Sm JoHTJ- Sebbigtit s Bantams.—Above all Bantams is placed, the celebrated and beautiful breed called Sir John Sebright's Silver Bantams. This breed, which Sir John brought to perfection after years of careful trials, is very small, with un- feathered legs, and a rose comb and short hackles. The plumage is gold or silver, span- gled, every feather being of a golden orange, or of a silver white, with a glossy jet-black margin; the cocks have the tail folded like that of a hen, with the sickle feathers short- ened straight, or nearly so, and broader than usual. The term hen-cocks is, in consequence, often applied to them; but although the sickle feathers are thus modified, no bird i)0ssesse3 higher courage, or a more gallant carriage. The attitude of the cock is, indeed, singularly , , proud; and he is often seen to bear himself so SEBKIGIIT BAK"TAMS, haughtily, that his head, thrown back as if in disdain, nearly touches the two upper feathers— sickles they can scarcely be called—of his tail. Half-bred birds of this kind are not un- common, but birds of the pure breed are not to be obtained without trouble and expense; indeed, some time ago, it Avas almost impossible to procure either a fowl or an egg. ** The finest," says the writer whom we have consulted as to this breed, " we have ever seen, were in Sir John's poultry-yard, adjacent to Turuham-Greeu Common, in the byroad leading to Acton."

All kinds of cold meat and solid fish may be dressed a la Mayonnaise, and make excellent luncheon or supper dishes. The sauce should not be poured over the fowls until473 POULTRY. the moment of serving. Should a very large Mayonnaise be required, use 2 fowls instead of 1, with an equal proportion of the remaining ingredients. Average cosfy with one fowl, 3s. 6d. Sufficient for a moderate-sized dish. Seasonable from April to September. Black Spanish.—The real Spanish fowl is recognized by its uuifoi'mly black colour burnished with tints of green; its peculiar white face, and the large develop ment of its comb and wattle. The hens are excellent layers, and their eggs are of a very large size. They are, however, bad nurses; consequently, their eggs should be laid in the nest of other varieties to be hatched. *' In purchasing Spanish," says an authority, " blue legs, the entire absence of white or coloured feathers in the phiniage, and a large white face, with a very large high cornb, which should be erect in the cock, though pendent in the hens, should be insisted on." The flesh of this fovvl is esteemed ; but, from the smallness of its body when compared with that of the Dorking-, it is not placed on an equality with it for the table. Otherwise, however, they are profitable birds, and their handsome carriage, and striking contrast of colour in the comb, face, and plumage, are a high recommendation to them as kept fowls. Por a town fowl, they are perhaps better adapted than any other variety. BLACK SPANISH. FOWIj PILLAU, based on M.

They have a white and flowing plumage, a full-sized, compact Poland tuft on the head, are muffed, have a full flowing tail, short legs well feathered, and Ave toes upon each foot. Their comb consists merely of two httle points, and their wattles are very small: their colour is that of a pure white. In January, 1854, they arrived in this country from Constantinople; and they take their name from sarai^ the Turkish word for sultan's palace, and ta-ooTc, the Turkish for fowl. They are thus called the " fowls of the sultan," a name which has the twofold advantage of being the nearest to be found to that by which they have been known in their own country, and of designating the country whence they come. Their habits are described as being generally brisk and happy-tempered, but not so easily kept in as Coehin-Chinas. They are excellent layers; but they are non-sitters and small eaters : their eggs are large and white. Brahmas or Cochins v/iU clear the crop of a grass-run long before they will, and, with scattered food^ they soon satisfy themselves and walk away. POULET AUX CESSSOlSrS. 1 964.

Pencilled Hambueg.—This variety of the Hamliurg fowl is of two colours, golden and silver, and is very minutely marked. The hens of both should have the body clearly pencilled across with several bars of black, and the hackle in both sexes should be perfectly free from dark marks. The cocks do not exhibit the pencillings, but are white or brown in the golden or silver birds respectively. Their form is compact, and their atti- tudes graceful and sprightly. The hens do not sit, bat lay extremely well; hence one of their common names, that of Dutch every-day layers. They are also known in different parts of the country, as Chitteprats, Creoles, or Corals, Bolton bays and grays, and, in some parts of Yorksliu-e, by the wrong name of Corsican fowls.

It makes its appearance in winter, and ranges over the whole of the coasts and estuaries frequented by other migrant geese. Mr. Selby states that a vary la'rge body of these birds annually resort to the extensive sandy and muddy flats which lis between the mainland and Holy Island, on the Northumbrian coast, and which are covered by every flow of the tide. This part of the coast appears to havo478 MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. been a favourite resort of these birds from time immemorial, where they have always received the name of Ware geese, no doubt from their continually feeding on marina vegetables.

Should the weather permit, let it hang for a few days : by so doing, the flavour will be very much improved. Pluck, singe, draw, and carefully wash and wipe the goose; cut ofl" the neck close to the back, leaving the skin long enough to turn over; cut off the feet at the first joint, and separate the pinions at the first joint.

Now cut off the end of the vent, and make a hole in the skin sufficiently large for the passage of the rump, in order to keep in the seasoning. 3Iode.—Make a sage-and-onion stuffing of the ahove ingredients, by recipe Ko. 504 ; put it into the body of the goose, and secure it firmly at both ends, by passing the rump through the hole made in the skin, and the other end by tying the skin of the neck to the back; by this means the seasoning will not escape. Put it down to a brisk fire, keep it well basted, and roast from li to 2 hours, according to the size. Re- move the skewers, and serve with a tureen of good gravy, and one of well- made apple-sauce. Should a very highly-flavoured seasoning be preferred, the onions should not be parboiled, but minced raw : of the two methods, the mild seasoning is far superior. A ragout, or pie, should be made of the giblets, or they may be stewed down to make gravy. Be careful to serve the goose before the breast falls, or its appearance will be spoiled by coming flattened to table. As this is rather a troublesome joint to carve, a large quantity of gravy should not be poured round the goose, but sent in a tureen. Time,—A large goose, 1| hour ; a moderate-sized one, Ikiolh, hour. Seasonable from September to March; but in perfection from Michaelmas to Christmas. Average costy 5s. 6d. each. Sufficient for 8 or 9 persons. Note.—A teaspoonful of made mustard, a saltspoonful of salt, a few grains of cayenne, mixed with a glass of port wine, are sometimes pom-ed into the goose by a slit made in the apron. This sauce is, by many i^ersons, considered an improvement. The Goose.—This bird is pretty generally distriljuted over the face of the globe, 73eing met with in l!^"orth America, Lapland, Iceland, Arabia, and Persia. Its varieties are numerous ; but in England there is only one species, which is supposed to be a native breed. The best geese are found on the borders of Suffolk, and in liorfolk and Berkshire; but the largest iiocks are reared in the fens of Lincoln- shire and Cambridge. They thrive best where they have an easy access to water, nnd large herds of them are sent every year to London, to be fattened bv the meti'opolitan poulterers. **A Michael- mas goose," says Dr. Kitchener, "is as famous in the mouths of the million as the minced-pie at Christmas; yet for those who eat with dehcacy, it is, at that time, too full-grown. The true pe- riod when the goose is in the highest perfection is when it has just acquired IllDEX GOOSE.MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. 478 its full growtli, and not begun to harden; if tlie Marcli goose is insipid, the Michaelmas goose is rank. The fine time is "between both; from the second week in June to the Urst in September." It is said that the Michaelmas goose is indebted to Queen Elizabeth for its origin on the table at that season. Her majesty happened to dine on one at the table of an English baronet, when she received the news of the dis- comfiture of the Spanish Armada. In commemoration of this event, she commanded the goose to make its appearance at table on every Michaelmas. We here give an engraving of the Emden goose.

Tns Egyptiatt Goose.—Especial attention has been directed to this bird by Herodotus, who says it was held sacred by the ancient Egyptians, which has been partially contii-med by modern travellers. Mr. Salt remarks, " Horns Apollo says the old geese stay with their young in the most imminent danger, at the risk of their own lives, which I have myself frequently witnessed. Vielpanser is the goose of the Nile, and ■wherever this goose is represented on the walls of the temples in colours, the re- semblance may be clearly traced." The goose is also said to have been a bird under the care of Isis. It has been placed by Mr. G-ould amongst the birds of Europe; not from the number of lialf- reclaimed individuals which are annually shot in Britain, but from the eircum- stance of its occasionally visiting the southern parts of the continent from its native country, Africa. The Toulouse , goose, of which we give an engraving, is a well-known bird. ' BOAST GUIISTEA-FOWIi, Larded. 970. Ikgeei>ie2tts.—A Guinea-fowl, lardoons, flour, and salt.

Tee Guiiq-EA-FowL.—The bird takes its name from Guinea, in Africa, where it is found wild, and in great abundance. It is gregarious in its habits, associating in flocks of two or three hundred, delighting in marshy- grounds, and at night perching upon trees, or on high situations. Its size is about the same as that of a common hen, but it stands higher on its legs. Though domesticated, it retains much of its wild nature, and is apt to wander. The hens lay abundantly, and the eggs are excellent. In their flesh, however, thc}^ are not so white as the common fowl, but more inclined to the colour of the pheasant, for which it frequently makes a good substi- tute at table. The flesh is both savoury and easy of digestion, and is in season when game 16 out of season.

A perfect pouter, seen on a windy day, is certainly a ludicrous sigiit: his feathered legs have the appearance of white trousers; his tapering tail looks like a swallow-tailed coat; his head is entirely concealed by his immense windy protu- berance ; and, altogether, he reminds you of a Uttle " swell" of a past century, staggering uuder a bale of linen. The most common pouters are the .blues, buffs, and whites, or an intermixture of all these various colours. The pouter is not a prolific breeder, is a bad nurse, and more likely to degenerate, if not repeatedly crossed and re-ci'ossed Avith fresh stock, than any other pigeon : nevertheless, it is a useful bird to keep if you are founding a new colony, as it is much attached to its home, and little apt to stray; oon- soquently it is calculated to induce more'restless birds to ^i.ottle down and make themselves comfortable. If you wish to breed pouters, you cannot do worse than intruat them with the care of their own eggs.POULTRY. 481 BOAST PIG-EONS. 974. Ingredients.—Pigeons, 3 oz. of butter, pepper and salt to taste. Trussmg.—Pigeons, to be good, should be eaten fresh (if kept a little, the flavour goes off), and they should be drawn as soon as killed. Cut off the heads and necks, truss the wings over the backs, and cut off the toes at the first joint: previous to trussing, they should be carefully cleaned, as no bird requires so much washing. Mode,—Wipe the birds very dry, season them inside with pepper and salt, and put about f oz. of butter into the body of each: this makes them moist. Put them down to a bright fire, and baste them well the whole of the time they are cooking (they will be done enough in from 20 to 30 minutes); garnish with fried parsley, and serve with a tureen of parsley and butter. Bread-sauce and gravy, the same as for roast fowl, are exceed- ingly nice accompaniments to roast pigeons, as also egg-sance. Tiyne.—Fvom 20 minutes to J hour. Average cost, 6d. to 9d. each. Seasonable from April to September; but in the greatest perfection from Midsummer to Michaelmas. The Pigeoit.—Tlie pigeon tribe forms a connecting link between the passerine birds and poultry. They are widely distributed over the world, some of the specie9 being found even in the arctic regions. Their chief food is grain, and they drink much; not at intervals, like other birds, but by a continuous draught, like quadrupeds. The wild pigeon, or stockdove, is the parent whence all the varieties of the domestic pigeon arc derived. In the wild state it is still found in many parts of this island, making its nest in the holes of rocks, in the hollows of trees, or in old towers, but never, like the ringdove, on branches. The blue house-pigeon is the variety principally reared for the table in this country, and is produced from our farmyards in great numbers. When young, and still fed by their parents, they are most preferable for the table, and are called squabs; under six months they are denominated squeakers, and at six months they begin to breed. Their flesh is accounted savoury, delicate, and stimulating, and the dark-coloured birds are considered to have the highest flavour, whilst the light are esteemed to have the more delicate flesh. The Pigeo^t-house, oe Dovecot.—The first thing to be done towards keeping pigeons is to provide a commodious place for their reception ', and the next is, to provide the pigeons themselves. The situation or size of the dovecot will necessarily depend on convenience but there is one point which must invariably be obsei-ved, and that is, that every pair of x)igeons has two holes or rooms to nest in. This is indispensable, as, without it, there will be no security, but the constant prospect of confusion, breaking of eggs, and the destruction of j'-oung. The proper place for the pigeon-house is the poultry-yard; but it does very well near dwellings, stables, brewhouses, bakehouses, or such offices. Some persons keep pigeons in rooms, and have them making their nests on the floor. The object is to escape the danger of the young falling out; but in such cases, there is a great risk of rats or other vermin getting at the pigeons. Aspect of the Pigeon-house.—The front of the pigeon-house should have a south- west aspect, and, if a room be selected for the purpose, it is usual to break a hole in tho roof of the building for the passage of the pigeons, but which can be closed at conveni- ence. A platform ought to be laid at the entrance for the pigeons to perch uj^on, with some kind of defence against strange cats, which will frequently depopulate a whole dovecot. Yet, although cats are dangerous neighbours for the birds, they are necessary to defend them from the approach of rats and mice, which will not only suck 2 IMODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. 482 the eggs, but destroy the birds. The platform should be painted white, and renewed aa the paint wears off, white being a favourite colour with pigeons, and also most couspic-uou3 as a mark to enable them to find their house. The boxes ought also to be similarly- painted, and renewed when necessary, for which purpose lime and water will do very well. The Necessity of Cleanliness.—As cleanliness in human habitations is of the first importance, so is it in the pigeon-house. There the want of it will soon render the place a nuisance not to be approached, and the birds, both young and old, will be so covered with vermin and filth, that they will neither_ enjoy health nor comfort, whilst early mortality amongst them will be almost certain. In some cases, the pigeon-house is cleaned daily; but it should always be done, at any rate, once a week, and the floor covered with sifted gravel, frequently renewed. _ Pigeons being exceedingly fond of water, and having a prescience of the coming of rain, they may be seen upon the house- tops waiting upon it until late in the evening, and then spreading their wings to receive the luxury of the refreshing shower. When they are confined in a room, therefore, they should be allowed a wide pan of water, to be often renewed. This serves them for a bath, which cools, refreshes, and assists them to keep their bodies clear of vermin. Breeding Pigeons.—In breeding pigeons, it is necessary to match a cock and hen, and shut them up together, or place them near to each other, and in the course of a day or two there is little doubt of their mating. Various rules have been laid down for the purpose of assisting to distinguish the cock from the hen pigeon; but the mascu- line forwardness and action of the cock is generally so remarkable, that he is easily ascertained. The pigeon being monogamous, the male attaches and confines himself to one female, and the attachment is reciprocal, and the fidelity of the dove to its mate is proverbial. At the age of six months, young pigeons are termed squeakers, and then begin to breed, when properly managed. Their courtship, and the well-known tone of voice in the cock, just then acquired and commencing, are indications of their approach- ing union. Nesthngs, while ted by cock and hen, are termed squabs, and are, at that age, sold and used for the table. The dove-house pigeon is said to breed monthly, when well supplied with food. At aU events, it may be depended on, that pigeons of almost any healthy and well-established variety will breed eight or ten times in the year; whence it may readilj' be conceived how vast are the numbers that may be raised. The Caerieb Pigeon.—Without doubt the carrier is entitled to raijk first in the • pigeon family, with the exception, perhaps, of the blue-rock pigeons. ISTo domestic fowl can be traced to so remote an antiquity. When Greece was in its glory, carrier pigeons were usedto convey to distant parts the nanies of the victors at the Olympian games. During the holy war, when Acre was besieged by King Richard, Saladin habitually correspondeil with the besieged by means of carrier pigeons. A shaft from an English crossbow, however, happened to bring one of these feathered mes- sengers to the ground, and the stratagem \Ya9 discovered, the design of the Saracens re- vealed, and so turned against the designers, that Acre was in the hands of the Christiana before the wily Saladin dreamt of such a thing.

Clean three of the feet, and place them in a hole made in the crust at the top : this shows what kind of pie it is. Glaze the crust,—that is to say, brush it over with the yolk of an egg*,—and bake it in a well-heated oven for about hour. When liked, a seasoning of pounded mace may be added. Time.—ll hour, or rather less. Average cost, 5s. 3d, Sufficient for 5 or 6 persons. Seasonable at any time. TuMBLEB PiGEOifS.—The smaller the size of this variety, the greater its value. The head should be round aud smooth, the neck thin, and the tail similar to that of theturbit. Highly-bred birds of this variety will attain an elevation in their flight beyond that of any other pigeons; aud it is in seeing these littla birds wing themselves so far into the sides that the fanciers take such delight. For four or five hours tumblers have been known to keep on the wing; and it is when they are almost lost to the power of human vision that they exhibit those pantomimic feats which give them their name, and which are marked by a tumbling over-and- over process, which suggests the idea of their having suddenly become giddy, been deprived of their self-conti'ol, or overtaken by some calamity. This acrobatic propensity in these pigeons has been ascribed by some to the absence of a proper power in the tail; but it is nothing more than a natural habit, for which uo adequate reason can be assigned. Of this variety, the Almond Tumbler is the most beautiful; and the greater the variation of the colour in the flight and tail, the greater their value. The Euitt Pigeoit.—This is generally esteemed amon* the la'^gest of the pigeon varieties, and being possessed of proportionate strength, with a strong propensity to exercise it, they keep the dovecot in a state of almost continual commotion by domineering over the weaker inmates. They breed tolerably well, however, and are valuable for the table. There is both the Leghorn and the Spanish Eunt, variously plumaged; but when red, white, or black mottled, are most highly esteemed. One of the great advantages connected with the Eunt is, that he is not likely to fly away from home. Being heavy birds, they find it diffi- cult, when well fed, to mount even to a low housetop. Again, they require no loft, or spe» cial dwelKng-place, but, if properly tended, wiU be perfectly satisfied, and thrive as well, in a rabbit-hutch as anywhere. Their flavour is very good; and it is not an uncommon thing for a squeaker Eunt to exceed a pound and a eunt pigeons. quarter in weight. The N"tjn Pigeoit.—The Tumbler bears a strong resemblance to this variety, which is characterized by a tuft of feathers rising from the back of the head, and which, on the whole, is an extremely pretty little bird. Ac- cording to the colour of the head, it is called the red, black, or yellow-headed Kun. To be a perfect bird, it should have a small head and beak; and the larger the tuft at the back of his head, the handsomer the bird is esteemed, and proportianatcly valuable in the eyes of pigeon- fanciers. If UN FIGEO>:S, TUMBLEE PIGEONS.MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY, 484 The Trumpetek Pigeoit.—From tlie circumstance of this "bird imitatincj the sound of a trumpet, instead of cooing, like other pif<eons,it has receivedits designation. It is of the middle size, having its legs and feet covered with feathera, and its plumage generally of a mottled black-and-white. It has a tuft springing from the root of its beak, and the larger this topknot is, the higher the estimation in which the breed is held. In their powers of trumpet- ing some are more expert than others; and whether this has any effect in influ- encing their own estimate of themselves, we cannot say 5 but they are rather select in the choice of their company. If two of them are put in a pigeon-house with other doves, it will be found that they conline their association almost entirely to each other. As much as two guineas have been pr.id for a well4rained docile bird of this kind. The Wood, or Wild Pigeon".—Bufibn enumerates upwards of thirty varieties of the pigeon, which he derives from one root,— viz. the stockdove, or common wild pigeon. All the varieties of colour and form which we witness, he attributes to human con- trivance and'fancy, Nevertheless, there exist essentially specific diffei'ences in these birds, which would appear to be attri- butable rather to the nature of the region, soO, and climate to which they are indige- nous, than to the art and ingenuity of man. The stockdove, in its wild state, is still found in some parts of Britain, forming its nest in the holes of rocks, old towers, and in the hollows of trees; it never, however, like the ringdove, nestles in the branches. Multitudes of wild pigeons still visit our shores in the winter, coming from their more northerly retreats, making their appearance about November, and retiring again in the spring. When forests of beechwood covered large tracts of the ground of this country, these birds used to haunt them in myriads, frequently covering a mile of ground in extent when they went out in the morning to feed.

It has the power of erecting its tail in the manner of a turkey-cock; during which action, especially when paying court to its mate, it trembles or shakes, like the peacock when moving about with his train expanded and in full display. This power of erecting and spreading the tail is not confined to the male bird alone : the female possesses the same power to an equal extent, and otherwise resembles the male in every respect. It is not very prolific, and seldom succeeds so well in the aviary or pigeon-house as most of tho other kinds. of tho PANTAIL PIGEOITS, The Jacobin Pigeon.—This variety, having form precisely similar, with all its peculiar characters undiminished, is, among pigeon- fanciers, designated as of a pure or permanent race. It is distinguished by a remarkable ruff or frill of raised feathers, which, commencing behind the head and proceeding down the neck and breast, forms a kind of hood, not unlike that worn by a monk. From this circumstance, it has obtained its Gallic name of nonnain capuchin. In size it is one of the smallest of the domestic pigeons, and its form is light and elegant. It is a very productive species, and, having its flight considerably impeded by the size and form of its hooded frill, keeps much at home, and i3 well adapted for the aviary or other buildings where pigeons are confined. the power to transmit to posterity a JACOBIN PIGEONS. TURBIT PIGEONS. The Tuebit Pigeon.—This variety bears a strong resemblance to the Jacobin, having a kind of frill in the fore part of its neck, occa- sioned by the breast-feathers lying contrariwise and standing straight out. The species is classed in accordance with the colour of the shoulders, similarly as the Nuns are by the colour of their heads. Their characteristics of excellence area fuU frill, short bill, and small round head. In Germany it is called the ruffle pigeon, in allusion to the feathers on its breast; and it has rarely any feathers on its feet. There ia a peculiarity connected Avith this bird, which somewhat lowers / it in the estimation of fanciers : it seldom rears more than one at a time, which, therefore, marks it as a bird rather for amusement than profit. The Bakb Pigeon.—The name of this variety is a contraction of Barbary, from which country it originally comes. It is both prolific and has excellent qualities as a nurse. The kind most esteemed is that of one uniform colour, that of blue-black being preferable to any other. _ Speckled or mottled Barbs are esteemed the most common of all pigeons. It is not unlike -^^-r the Carrier pigeon, and, at "a small distance, mU^^ might easily be mistaken for the latter. It has c*'^ a short beak and a small wattle. A spong}'-, pinky skin round the eyes is its chief charac- teristic, however, and this increases in size till the bird is three or four years old. This pecu- liarity is hardly distinguishable in very young birds. EAKB PIGEONS,MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. 486 The Eock Pigeoit.—This yariety, in its wild state, is found upon tlie rocky parts of the west of Scotland, and the bold shores of the Western Isles, more abundant than in any other parts of the British islands. As the shores of the mainland are exposed to the muds of the Atlantic, and the comparatively small islands are surrounded by that ocean, the low grounds exposed to the west are seldom covered with snow for any length of time, and thus the birds easily find a supply of food. The numbers which there congregate are often very great, and the din of their united cry is sometime.", very loud and even alarming. The love of home and the certainty of returning to it is very conspicuous in the rock-pigeon or hisei, as it is called by the French. Flocks from different parts of the coasts often meet on the feeding- grounds ; but when the time of returning to rest comes round, each one keeps to its own party. ELUE rvOCK-PIGEON. The Owl Pigeoit.—This pigeon does not seem to be so well known as it formerly was, if we may judge from the fact that few modern writers mention it. Like the Turuit pigeon, the Owl has a remarkable tuft of feathers on the breast, it having been compared by some to the frill of a shirt, and by others to a full- blown white rose. In size, it is not quite so large a pigeon as the Jacobin. It is said to be preferred in France, above other varieties, as a bird to rear and kiU for the table. In England it is very far from being common; indeed, we have applied to several keepers of pigeons, who have fancied themselves acquainted with all the varieties of this bird, and they have been able to tell us nothing of it. Mr. Harrison Weir, our artist, however, has made his portrait from the life. DWL PIGEONS. BOILED BABBIT. 977. Iis^GREDTEis^TS.—Habbit; water. 3Iode.—For boiling", choose rabbits with smooth and sharp claws, as that denotes they are young : should these be blunt and rugged, the ears dry and tough, the animal is old. After emptying and skinning it, wash it well in cold water, and let it soak for about J hour in warm water, to draw out the blood. Bring the head round to the side, and fasten it there by means of a skev/er run through that and the body. Put the rabbit into suffi- cient hot water to cover it, let it boil very gently until tender, which will be in from ^ to f hour, according to its size and age. Dish it, and smother it either with onion, mushroom, or liver sauce, or parsley-and-butter; the former is, however, generally preferred to any of the last-named sauces. When liver-sauce is preferred, the liver should be boiled for a few minutes, and minced very finely, or rubbed through a sieve before it is added to the sauce.POULTRY. 487 Time.—k very young rabbit, -2- bour; a large one, f hour; an old one, 1 hour or longer.

The Rabbit,—Thougli this animal is an inhabitant of most temperate climates, it does not reach so far north as the hare. The wild rabbit is a native of Great Britain, and is found in large numbers in the sandy districts of Norfolk and Cambridgeshire. Its flesh is, by some, considered to have a' higher flavour than that of the tame rabbit, although it is neither so white nor so delicate. The animal, however, becomes larger and fatter in the tame than in the wild state; but it is not desirable to have it so fat as it can be made. CUBRIED BABBIT 978.

The common wild rabbit is of a grey colour, and is esteemed the best for the purposes of food. Its skin is valuable as an article of commerce, being used for the makirjg of hats. Another variety of the rabbit, however, called the " silver-grey," has been lately introduced to this country, and is still more valuable. Its colour is a black ground, thickly interspersed with grey hairs; and its powers as a destroyer and consumer of vegetable food are well known to be enormous, especially by those who have gardens in the vicinity of a rabbit-warren. wild eaebit3.488 MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY.

When cooked in this manner, make a gravy in the pan by recipe No. 866, and pour it round, but not over, the pieces of rabbit. Vaeieties m Eabbits.—Almost everybody knows that a" rabbit is a furry animal, that lives on plants, and burrows in the ground; tliat it has its varieties as well as other animals, and that it is frequently an especial favourite with boys. Among its varieties, the short-legged, with width and substance of loin, is the most hardy, and fattens the most expeditiously. It has, besides, the soundest hver, rabbits generally being subject to defects of that part. It is also the smallest variety. There is a very large species oi the hare-colour, having much bone, length and depth of carcase, large and long ears, with full eyes, resembling those of the hare: it might readily be taken for a hybrid or mule, but for the objection to its breeding. Its flesh is high-coloured, substantial, and more savoury than that of the common rabbit; and, cooked like the hare, it makes a good dish. The large white, and yellow and white species, have whiter and more delicate flesh, and, cooked in the same way, will rival the turkey. Eabbits are divided into four kinds, distinguished as warreners, parkers, hedgehogs, and sweethearts. The warrener, as his name imphes, ia a member of a subterranean community, and is less effeminate than his kindred who dwell tipon the earth and have "the world at their will," and his fur is the most esteemed. After him, comes the parker, whose favourite resort is a gentleman's pleasure-ground, where he usually breeds in great numbers, and from which he frequently drives away the hares. The hedgehog is a sort of vagabond rabbit, that, tinker like, roams about the country^ and would have a much better coat on his back if he was more settled in his habits, and remained more at home. The sweetheart is a tame rabbit, with its fur so sleek, soft, and silky, that it is also used to some extent in the important branch of hat-making, BABBIT A liA MINUTE. 980.

Note.—The liver of the rabbit may be boiled, minced, and mixed with the forcemeat balls, when the flavour is liked. FECirNDiTY OF THE Eabbit.—The fruitfulness of this animal has been the subject of •wonder to all naturalists. It breeds seven times in the year, and generally begets seven or eight j^oimg ones at a time. If we suppose this to happen regularly for a period of four years, the progeny that would spring from a single pair would amount to more than a million. As the rabbit, however, has many enemies, it can never be permitted to increase in numbers to such an extent as to prove injurious to mankind; for it not only lurnishes man with an article of food, but is, by_ carnivorous animals of every descrip- tion, mercilessly sacrificed. Notwithstanding this, however, in the time of the Koman power, they once infested the Balearic islands to such an extent, that the inhabitants were obliged to implore the assistance of a miUtary force from Augustus to exterminate them.

Seasonable from September to February. The Eabbit-hotjse.—Eabbit-lceeping is generally practised by a few individuals in almost every town, and by a few iu almost every part of the country. Forty years ago, there were in the metropolis one or two considerable feeders, who, according to report, kept from 1,500 to 2,000 breeding does. These large establishments, however, have ceased to exist, and London receives the supply of tame as well as wild rabbits chiefly from the country. Where they are kept, however, the rabbit-house should be placed upon a dry foundation, and be well ventilated. Exposure to rain, whether ex- ternally or internally, is fatal to rabbits, which, like sheep, are liable to the rot, springing from the same causes. Thorough ventilation and good air are indispensable where many rabbits are kept, or they will neither prosper nor remain healthy for any length of time. A thorough draught or passage for the air is, therefore, absolutely necessary, and should be so contrived as to be checked in cold or wet weather by the closing or shutting of opposite doors or windows.

The Hutch.—Hutches are generally placed one above another to the height required by the number of rabbits and the extent of the room. Where a large stock is kept, to tnake the most of room, the hutches may be placed in rows, with a sufficient interval between for feeding and cleaning, instead of being, in the usual way, joined to the wall. It is preferable to rest the hutches upon stands, about a foot above the ground, for the convenience of cleaning under them. Each of the hutches intended for breeding should have two rooms,—a feeding and a bed-room. Those are single for the use of the weaned rabbits, or for the bucks, which are always kept separate. The floors should be planed smooth, that wet may run off, and a common hoe, with a short handle, and a short broom, are most convenient implements for cleaning these houses. STEWED BABBIT. 984.

Seasonable from September to February. Fancy Eabbits.—The graceful fall of the ears is the first thing that is looted to Ly the fancier; next, the dewlap, if the animal is in its prime j then the colours and marked points, and, lastly, the shape and general appearance. The ears of a fine rabbit should extend not less than seven inches, measured from tip to tip in a line across the skull; but even should they exceed this length, they are admitted v/ith reluctance into a fancy stock, unless they have a uniform and gracefid droop. The dewlap, which is a fold of skin under the neck and throat, is only seen in fancy rabbits, after they have attained their full growth: it commences immediately under the jaw, and adds greatly to the beauty of their appearance. It goes down the throat and between the fore legs, and is so broad that it projects beyond lop-eaeed eabbit. the chin. The difference between the fancy and common rabbit in the back, independent of the ears, is sufficient to strike the common observer. Fancy rabbits fetch a very high price; so much as five and ten guineas, and even more, is sometimes given for a first-rate doe. If young ones are first procured from a good fajnily, the foundation of an excellent stock can be procured for a much smaller sum. Sometimes the ears, instead of drooping down, slope backwards : a rabbit with this characteristic is scarcely admitted into a fancy lot, and is not considered worth more than the common variety. The next position is when one ear lops outwards, and the other stands erect: rabbits of this kind possess but little value, however fine the shape and beautiful the colour, although they sometimes breed as good specimens as finer ones. The forward or horn-loiD is one degree nearer perfection than the half-lop : the ears, in this case, slope forward and down over the forehead. Eabbits with this peculiarity are often perfect in other respects, Avith the exception of the droop of the ears, and often become the parents of perfect young ones : does of this kind often have the pov/er of lifting an ear erect. In the ear-lop, the ears spread out in an horizontal position, like the wings of a bird in flight, or the arms of a man swimming. A great many excellent does have this characteristic, and some of the best-bred bucks in the fancy are entirely so. Sometimes a rabbit drops one ear completely, but raises the other so nearly horizontally as to constitute an ear-lop : this is superior to all others, except the perfect fall, which is so rarely to be met with, that those which are merely ear-lopped are considered as valuable rabbits, if well bred and with other good qualities. " The real lop has ears that hang down by the side of the cheek, slanting somewhat outward in their descent, with the open part of the ear inward, and sometimes eitlier backwards or forwards instead of perpendicular: when the animals stand in an easy position, the tips of the ears touch the ground. The hollows of the ears, in a fancy rabbit of a first-rate kind, should be turned so completely backwards that only the outer part of them should remain in front: they should match exactly in their descent, and should slant outwards as little as possible." The same authority asserts that perfect lops are so rare, that a breeder possessing twenty of the handsomest and most perfect does would consider himself lucky if, in the course of a year, he managed to raise twelve full-lopped rabbits out of them all. As regards variety and purity of colour an experienced breeder says :— ** The fur of fancy rabbits may be blue, or rather lead-colour, and white, or black and white, or tawny and white, that is, tortoiseshell-coloured. But it is not of so muck importance what colours the coat of a rabbit displays, as it is that those colours shall bo arranged in a particular manner, forming imaginary figures or fancied resemblances to certain objects. Hence the peculiarities of their markings have been denoted by dis-MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. tinctive designations. What is termed ' the blue butterfly smut' was, for somo time, considered the most valuable of fancy rabbits. It is thus named on account of having bluish or lead-coloured spots on either side of the nose, having some resemblance to tho spread wings of a butterfly, what may bs termed the groundwork of the rabbit's face being white. A black and white rabbit may also have the face marked in a similar manner, constituting a * black butterfly smut.' " But a good fancy rabbit must likewise have other marks, without which it cannot be considered a perfect model of its kind. There should be a black or blue patch on its back, called the saddle; the tail must be of the same colour with the back and snout; while the legs should be all white; and there ought to be dark stripes on both sides of the body in front, passing backwards to meet the saddle, and uniting on the top of the shoulders at the part called the withers in a horse. These stripes form what is termed the 'chain/ having somewhat the appearance of a chain or collar hanging round the neck. "Among thorough-bred fancy rabbits, perhaps not one in a hundred will have all these markings clearly and exactly displayed on the coat; but the more nearly the figures on the coat of a rabbit approach to the pattern described, the greater wiU be its value, so far, at least, as relates to colour. The beauty and consequent worth of a fancy rabbit, however, depends a good deal on its shape, or what is styled its carriage. A rabbit is said to have a good carriage when its back is finely arched, rising full two inches above the top of its head, which must be held so low as for the muzzle and the points of the ears to reach almost to the ground."

The Hare-Eabbit.—There has been lately introduced to French tables an animal called the "Hare-rabbit," partaking of the nature, characteristics, and qualifica- tions of both the hare and the rabbit. It is highly spoken of, both as regards flesh and flavour; and it is said to be the only hybrid which is able to perpetuate its race. We hope that some enterprising individual will soon secure for English tables what would seem to be a really valuable addition to our other game and poultry dishes; although it will be rather difficult to exactly assign its proper posi- tion, as within or without the meaning of *' game," as by law established. Only a few specimens have been seen in England at present, but there is no reason to doubt that our rabbit-fanciers will prove equal to the occasion, and cope success- fully with our neighbours across the Channel in introducing a new animal serviceable in the kitchen. THE HAEE-KABBIT.POULTRY. 493 The Aitgoba Rabbit.—This is one of the handsomest of all rabbits. It talies its name from being an inhabitant of Angora, a city and district of Asia Minor. Like the well- known Angora goat and eat, both of which are valuable on account of the fineness of their wool and fur, this rabbit is prized for its long, waved, silky fur, which, as an article of com- merce, is highly esteemed. We are not aware whether it is eaten by the inhabitants, and but few specimens have been introduced into Eng- land, where, doubtless, the beauty of its coat would materially suffer from the more humid and less genial character of the climate. To the rabbits of the ancient and mountainous district of Angora the words of the wise man would seem most to apply, ** The conies are but feeble folk, yet make they their houses in the rocks." Ths Himalaya Rabbit.—Amidst the mighty Himalaya mxountains, whose peaks are the high- est on the globe, the pretty i*abbit here por- traj'ed is found j and his colour seems to be lilce tlie snow, which, above the altitude of from 13,000 to 16,000 feet, perpetually crowns the summits of these monarchs of the world. It is, at present, a very rare animal in England, but will, doubtless, be more extensively known in the course of a few years. From the earth- tunnelling powers of this little animal, Martial declares that mankind learned the art of forti- fication, mining, and covered roads. Himalaya babbits. BOILED TURKEY. 9B6. Ii^GREDiENTS.—Turkey; forcemeat No. 417. Choosing and Trussing,—Hen turkeys are preferable for boiling^, on account of their whiteness and tenderness, and one of moderate size should be selected, as a large one is not suitable for this mode of cooking. They should not be dressed until they have been killed 3 or 4 days, as they will neither look white, nor will they be tender. Pluck the bird, carefully draw, and singe it with a piece of white paper • wash it inside and out, and wipe it thoroughly dry with a cloth. Cut off the head and neck, draw the strings or sinews'of the thighs, and cut off the legs at the first joint; draw the legs into the body, fill the breast with forcemeat made by recipe No. 417 ; run a skewer through the wing and the middle joint of the leg, quite into the leg and wing on the opposite side; break the breastbone, and make the bird look as round and as compact as possible. Mode.—Put the turkey into sufficient hot water to cover it; let it come to a boil, then carefully remove all the scum : if this is .attended to, there is no occasion to boil the bird in a fioured cloth; but it should be well covered with the wat^r. Let it simmer very gently for about 14-hour to If hour, according boiled turkey.MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. m to the size, and serve with either white, celery, oyster, or mushroom sauce, or parsley-and-butter, a little of which should be poured over the turkey.

The Turkey.—The turliey, for wliich fine bird we are indebted to America, is certainly one of the most glorious presents made by the Wew World to the Old, Some, indeed, assert that this bird was known to the ancients, and that it was served at the wed- ding-feast of Charlemagne. This opinion, however, has been controverted by first-rate FvUthorities, who declare that the French name of the bird, dindon, proves its origin ; that the form of the bird is altogether foreign, and that it is found in America alone in a wild state. There is but little doubt, frorn the information which has been gained at considerable trouble, that it appeared, generally, in Europe about the end of the 17th century; that it was first imported into France by Jesuits, Avho had been sent out missionaries to the West; and that from France it spread over Europe. To this day, in many localities in France, a turkey is called a jesuit. On the farms of IT. America, where turkeys are very common, they are raised either from eggs which have been found, or from young ones caught in the woods: they thus preserve almost entirely their original plumage. The turkey only became gradually acclimated, both on the continent and in England: in the middle of the 18th century, scarcely 10 out of 20 young turkeys lived; now, generally speaking, 15 out of the same number arrive at maturity, CKOQUETTES OF TUBKBY (Cold Meat Cookery). 987. Ingredieitts.—The remains of cold turkey; to every f ib. of meat allow 2 oz. of ham or bacon, 2 shalots, 1 02. of butter, 1 table- spoonful of flour, the yolks of 2 eggs, egg and bread crumbs. Mode.—The smaller pieces, that will not do for a fricassee or hash, answer very \^lell for this dish. Mince the meat finely with ham or bacon in the above proportion; make a gravy of the bones and trim- mings, well seasoning it; mince the shalots, put them into a stewpan with the butter, add the flour; mix well, then put in the mince, and about 4 pint of the gravy made from the bones. (The proportion of the butter must be increased or diminished according to the quantity of mince.) When just boiled, add the yolks of 2 eggs ; put the mixture out to cool, and then shape it in a wineglass. . Cover the croquettes with egg and bread crumbs, and fry them a delicate brown.

The Wild TunsET.—In its wild state, the turkey is gregarious, going together in extensive flocks, immbering as many as five hundred. These frequent the great swamps of America, where they roost; but, at sunrise, leave these situations to repair to the dryPOULTRY. 495 woods, in search of berries and acorns. They perch on the boughs of trees, and, by rising from branch to branch, attain the height they desire. They usually mount to the highest tops, apparently from an instinctive conception that the loftier they are the further they are out of danger. They fly awkwardly, but run with great swiftness, and about the month of March become so fat as not to be able to take a flight beyond three or four hundred yards, and are then, also, easily run down by a horseman. Now, how- ever, it rarely happens that wild turkeys are seen in the inhabited parts of America. It is only in the distant and more unfrequented parts that they are found in great numbers. FBIOASSEED TUBKEY (Cold Meat Cookery). 988.

They usually associate in families, consisting of one male and several females. Turkeys are particularly fond of the seeds of nettles, whilst the seeds of the foxglove will poison them. The common turkey is a native of North America, and, in the reign of Henry VIII,, was introduced into England. According to Tusser's '* Five Hundred Points of Good Husbandry," it began about the year 1585 to form a dish at our rural Christmas feasts:— V Beefe, mutton, and pork, shred pies of the best.

"The tnrkey is one of the most difficult birds to rear, and its flesh ia much esteemed. The Disposition of the Tuekey.—Among themselves, turkeys are extremely furious, whilst amongst other animals they are usually both weak and cowardly. The domestic cock frequently makes them keep at a distance, whilst they wiU rarely attack him but in a united body, when the cock is rather crushed by their weight than defeated by their prowess. The disposition of the female is in general much more gentle than that of the male. When leading forth her young to coUect their food, though so large and apparently so powerful a bird, she gives them very slight protection from the attacks of any rapacious animal which may appear against them. She rather warns them of their danger than offers to defend them; yet she is extremely affectionate to her young. HASHED TUBKEY. 989.

HujN'Tiicg Tuekets.—Formerly, in Canada, Lnnting turkeys was one of the principal diversioHS of the natives of that country. When they discovered the retreat of the birds, which Avas generally near a field of nettles, or where grain of any kind was plentiful, they would send a well-trained dog into the midst of the flock. The turkeys no sooner perceived their enemy than they would run off at full speed, and with such SA^iftness that they Vvould leave the dog far behind. He, however, would follow in their wake, and as they could not, for a great length of time, continue at their speed, they were at last forced to seek shelter in the trees. There they would sit, spent with fatigue, till the hunters would approach, and, with long poles, knock them down one after the other. ROAST TUBKEY. ] 990. IiraKEDiENTS.—Turkey; forcemeat No. 417. 1 Choosing and IVussing.—Choose cock turkeys by their short spurs and black legs, in which case they are young; if the spurs are long, and the legs pale and rough, they are old. If the bird has been long killed, the eyes will appear sunk and the feet very dry; but, if fresh, the contrary will be the case. Middling-sized fleshy turkeys are by many persons considered superior to those of an immense growth, as they are, generally speaking, much more tender. They should never be dressed the same day they are killed; but, in cold weather, should hang at least 8 days; if the weather is mild, 4 or 5 days will be found sufficient. Carefully pluck the bird, singe it with white paper, and wipe it thoroughly with a cloth; draw it, preserve the liver and gizzard, and be particular not to break the gall-bag, as no washing will remove the bitter taste it imparts where it once touches. "Wash it inside well, and wipe it thoroughly dry with a cloth; the outside merely requires nicely wiping, as we have just stated. Cut ofl" the neck close to the back, but leave enough of the crop-skin to turn over; break the leg-bone close below the knee, draw out the strings from the thighs, and flatten the breastbone to make it look497 POULTRY. plump. Have ready a forcemeat made by recipe No. 417; fill the breast vnth. this, and, if a trussing-needle is used, sew the neck over to the back; if a needle is not at hand, a skewer will answer the purpose. Run a skewer through the pinion and thigh into the body to the pinion and thigh on the other side, and press the legs as much as pos- sible between the breast and the side bones, and put the liver under one pinion and the gizzard under the other. Pass a string across the back of the bird, catch it over the points of the skewer, tie it in the centre of the back, and be particular that the turkey is very firmly trussed. This may be more easily accomplished with a needle and twine than with skewers. 3fode.—Fasten a s'heet of buttered paper on to the breast of the bird, put it down to a bright fire, at some little distance at first (afterwards draw it nearer), and keep it well basted the whole of the time it is cooking. About \ hour before serving, remove the paper, dvedge the turkey lightly with flour, and put a piece of butter into the basting-ladle; as the butter melts, baste the bird with it. When of a nice brown and well frothed, serve with a tureen of good brown gravy and one of bread sauce. Fried sausages are a favourite addition to roast turkey; they make a pretty garnish, besides adding very much to the flavour. When these are not at hand, a few forcemeat balls should be placed round the dish as a garnish. Turkey maj?- also be stufled with sausage-meat, and a chestnut forcemeat with the same sauce is, by many persons, much esteemed as an accompaniment to this favourite dish.—See coloured plate, A1.

English Tuekets.—These are reared in great numbers in Suffolk, Norfolk, and several other counties, whence they were wont to he driven to the London market in llocks of several hundreds; the improvements in our modes of travelling now, however, enable them to be brought by railway. Their drivers used to manage them with great I facility, by means of a bit of red rag tied to the end of a long stick, which, from the I antipathy these birds have to that colour, effectually answered the purpose of a scourge. 1 There are three varieties of the tui'key in this country,—the black, the white, and the I speckled, or copper-coloured. The black approaches nearest to the original stock, and is esteemed the best. Its flesh is white and tender, delicate, nourishing, and of excellent flavour; it greatly deteriorates with age, however, and is then good for little but Btewing.

About 10 minutes before serving, dredge it lightly with fiour, and baste well; when nicely frothed, send it to table immediately, with a little gravy in the dish, and some in a tureen. If at hand, a few water-cresses may be placed round the turkey as a garnish, or it may be larded. Time.—KboTxt 1 hour. Average cost, Is. to 8s. each. Sufficient for 6 or 7 persons.

The Feathees 03? the Turkey.—Human ingenuity subjects almost every materkil to the purposes of ornament or use, and the feathers of turkeys have been found adapted for more ends than one. The American Indians convert them into an elegant clothing, and, by twisting the inner ribs into a strong double string, with hemp or the inner baric of the mulberry-tree, work it like matting. This fabric has a very rich and glosry appearance, and is as fine as silk shag. The natives of Louisiana used to make fans of the tail; and four of that appendage joined together was formerly constructed into a parasol by the French. TO BOI^S A TUBKEY OB FOWL WITHOUT OPEI^ING IT. {Miss Acton's PvCcixoe,) 992. After the fowl has been drawn and singed, wipe it inside and out with a clean cloth, but do not vfash it. Take off the head, cut through the skin all round the first joint of the legs, and pull them from the fowl, to draw out the large tendons. Eaise the flesh first from the low^er part of the backbone, and a little also from the end of the breastbone, if necessary; w^ork the knife gradually to the socket of the thigh; witli the point of the knife detach the joint from it, take the end of the bone firmly in the fingers, and cut the flesh clean from it down to the next joint, round which pass the point of the knife carefully, and when the skin is loosened from it in every part, cut round the next bone, keeping the edge of the knife close to it, until the whole of the leg is done. Eemove the bones of the other leg in the same manner; then detach the flesh from the back- and breast-bone sufiaciently to enable you to reach the upper joints of the wings; proceed with these as v/ith the legs, but be especially careful499 POULTRY. not to pierce the skin of tlie second joint: it is usual to leave the pinions unboned, in order to give more easily its natural form to the fowl when it is dressed. The merrythought and neck-bones may now easily be cut away, the back- and side-bones taken out without being divided, and the breastbone separated carefully from the flesh (which^ as the work progresses, must be turned back from the bones upon the fowl, until it is completely inside out). After the one remaining bone is removed, drav/ the wings and legs back to their proper form, and turn the fowl right side outwards. 993. A turkey is boned exactly in the same manner; but as it requires a very large proportion of forcemeat to fill it entirely, the legs and wings are sometimes drawn into the body, to diminish the expense of this. If very securely trussed, and sewn, the bird may be either boiled, or stewed in rich gravy, as well as roasted, after being boned and forced ; but it must be most gently cooled, or it may burst. ANOTHER MODE OP BONING A TUBKEY OB FOWL. {Miss AcIotCs Recipe.) 994- Cut through the skin down the centre of the back, and raise the flesh carefully on either side with the point of a sharp knife, until the sockets of the wings and thighs are reached. Till a little practice has been gained, it will perhaps be better to bone these joints before proceeding further ; but after they are once detached from it, the whole of the body may easily be separated from the flesh and taken out entire : only the neck-bones and merrythought will then remain to be removed. The bird thus prepared may either be restored to its original form, by filling the legs and wings with forcemeat, and the body wdth the livers of two or three fowls, mixed with alternate layers of parboiled tongue freed from the rind, fine sausage-meat, or veal forcemeat, or thin slices of the nicest bacon, or aught else of good flavour, which will give a marbled appearance to the fowl when it is carved; and then be sewn up and trussed as usual; or the legs and wings may be drawn inside the body, and the bird being first flattened on a table, may be covered with sausage-meat, and the various other ingredients we have named, so placed that it shall be of equal thick- ness in every part; then tightly rolled, bound firmly together with a fillet of broad tape, wrapped in a thin pudding-cloth, closely tied at both ends, and dressed as follows :--Put it into a braising-pan, stew- pan, or thick iron saucepan, bright in the inside, and fitted as nearly as may be to its size; add all the chicken-bones, a bunch of sweet herbs, two carrots, two bay-leaves, a large blade of mace, twenty-four 2 K 2500 MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. v/hite peppercorns, and any trimmings or bones of undressed veal which may be at hand; cover the whole with good veal broth, add salt, if needed, and stew it very softly, from an hour and a quarter to an hour and a half; let it cool in the liquor in which it was stewed ; and after it is lifted out, boil down the gravy to a jeliy and strain it; let it become cold, clear off the fat, and serve it cut into large dice oi roughed, and laid round the fowl, which is to be served cold, it restored to its form, instead of being rolled, it must be stewed gently for an hour, and may then be sent to table hot, covered with mush- room, or any other good sauce that may be preierred ; or it may be left until the following day, and served garnished with the jelly, which should be firm, and very clear and well-iiavoured : the liquoi in which a calf s foot has been boiled down, added to the broth, wiiJ give it the necessary degree of consistence.

First carve them entirely into joints, then remove the bones, beginning with the legs and wings, at the head of the largest bone; hold this with the lingers, and work the knife as directed in the recipe above. The remainder of the birds is too easily done to require any instructions. TO DRESS WHEATEARS. 996. Ingredients.—-Wheatears; fresh butter. After the birds are picked, gutted, and cleaned, truss them like larks, put them down to a quick tire, and baste them well with fresh butter. When done, which will be in about 20 minutes, dish them on fried bread crumbs, and garnish the dish with slices of lemon. Time—20 minutes. Seasonable from July to October. The Wheateae.—Tlie wheatear is an annual visitor of England: it arrives about the middle of March and leaves in September. The females come about a fortnight before the males, and continue to arrive till the middle ot May. They are in sea-^oa from July to October, and are taken in large numbers on the'South Downs, iu the neighbourhood of Eastbourne, Brighton, and other parts of Sussex. They are taken by means of snares and nets, and numbers of them are eaten on the spot by the inhabi- tants. The larger ones are sent to London and potted, where they are by many as much esteemed as the ortolans of the continent, Mr, Pennant assigns as the reason of their abounding on the downs about Eastbourne, the existence of a species of fly v,hich forms their favourite food, and which feeds on the wild thyme on the adjacent hills. 097..

The lower tier of a rabbit-hutch is esteemed excellent quarters by the guinea-pig: here, as he runs loose, he will devour the waste food of his more admired companion. 8ome naturalists assert that the guinea-pig will breed at two months old, the litter varying from four to twelve at a time. It is varied in colour,—white, fawn, and black, and a mixture of the three colours, form- ing a tortoiseshell, which is the more generally admired hue. Occasionally, the white ones have red eyes, like those of the ferret and the Avhite rabbit. Their llesh, although eatable, is decidedly unfit for food; they have been tasted, however, we presame by some enthusiast eager to advance the cause of science, or by some eccentric epicure in search of a new pleasure for his palate. Unless it has been that they deter rats from intruding within the rabbit- hutch, they are as usokss as they are harmless. The usual ornament of an animal's hind quarters is denied the.n; and were it not lor this lact, and also for their difference in colour, the Shaksperean locution, ** a rat without a tail," would designate them very properly. 998, The Cygnet.—The Cygnet, or the young Swan, was formerly much esteemed; but it has " fallen from its high estate," and is now rarely seen upon the table. We are not sure that it is not still fattened in Norwich for the corporation of that place. Persons who have property on the river there, take the young birds, and send them to some one who is employed by the cor- poration, to be fed ; and for this trouble he is paid, or was wont to be paid, about half a guinea a bird. It is as the future bird of elegance and grace that the young swan is mostly admired; when it has be- come old enough to grace the waters, then it is that all admire her, when she with " Arched neck, Between her white wings mantling, proudly rows Her state with oary feet."

'No dishes require so much knowledge and skill in their oarving as do game and poultry; for it is necessary to be well acquainted with the anatomy of the bird and animal in order to place the knife at exactly the proper point. A tough fowl and an old goose are sad triers of a carver's powers and temper, and, indeed, sometimes of the good humour of those in the neighbourhood of the carver; for a sudden tilt of the BOAST DUCK.MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. dish may eventuate in the placing a quantity of the gravy in the lap of the right or left-hand supporter of the host. We will endeavour to assist those who are unacquainted with the ** gentle art of carving," and also those who are but slightly acquainted with it, by simply de- scribing the rules to follow, and referring to the dis- tinctly-marked illustrations of each dish, which will further help to bring light to the minds of the unini- tiated. If the bird be a young duckling, it may be carved like a fowl, viz., by first taking off the leg and the wing on either side, as described at Fo. 1000; but i^iibr, wijNw, ill cases where the duckling is very small, it Vvill be ^^OT^ucK^^^ ^''^"^^ separajte the leg from the wing, as they will not then form too large a portion for a single serving. After the legs and wings are disposed of, the remainder of the duck will be also carved in the same manner as a fowl; and not much difficulty will be experienced, as ducklings are tender, and the joints are easily broken by a little gentle forcing, or penetrated by the knife. In cases where the duck is a large bird, the better plan to pursue is then to carve it like a goose, that is, by cutting pieces from the breast in the direction indicated by the lines marked from 1 to 2, commencing to carve the slices close to the wing, and then proceeding upwards from that to the breastbone. If more should be wanted than can be obtained from both sides of the breast, then the legs and wings must be attacked, in the same way as is described in connection with carving a fowl. It may be here remarked, that as the legs of a duck are placed far more backward than those of a fowl, their position causing the waddling motion of the bird, the thigh-bones will be found considerably nearer towards the backbone than in a chicken: this is the only difference worth mentioning. The carver should ask each guest if a portion of stuffing would be agreeable ; and in order to get at this, a cut should be made below the breast, as shown by the line from 3 to 4, at the part called the " apron," and the spoon inserted. (As described in the recipe, it is an excellent plan, when a couple of ducks are served, to have one with, and the other without stuffing.) As to the prime parts of a duck, it has been said that " the wing of o, ffier and the leg of a swimmer" are severally the best portions. Some persons are fond of the feet of the duck ; and, in trussing, these should never be taken off. The leg, wing, and neckbone are here shown ; so that it will be easy to see the shape they should be when cut Q^,^3 BOILED FOWL, iooo. This will not be found a very difficult member of the poultry family to carve, unless, as may happen, a very old farmyp.rd oc- cupant, useless for egg-laying purposes, has, by some unlucky mischance, been introduced ' ~ into the kitchen as a "fine young chicken." ^| ^ . Skill, however, and the application of a small ^iLi^T^ -..-^^^i^ amount of strength, combined with a fine - _ -n . . BOILED FOWL. keeping of the temper, will even get over that difficulty. Fixing the fork firmly in the breast, let the knife be sharply passed along the line shown from 1 to 2; then cut doY^nwards from that line to fig. 3 ; and the wing, it will be found, can be easily withdrawn. The shape of the wing should be like the accompanying engraving. Let the fork be placed inside the leg, which should be gently forced away from the body of the fowl; and the joint, being thus discovered, the carver can readily cut through it, and the leg can be served. When the leg is displaced, it should be of the same shape as that shown in the annexed woodcut. The legs and v/ings on either side having been taken off, the carver should draw his knife through the fi.esh in the direction of the line 4 to 5 : by this means the knife can be slipped underneath the merrythought, v/hich, being lifted up and pressed backward, will imme- KEciBoiTE'S iowl. diately come ofi\ The collar- or neck-bones are the next to consider: these lie on each side of the m.errythought, close under the upper part of the wings ; and, in order to free these from the fowl, they must also be raised by the knife at their broad end, and turned from the body towards the breastbone, until the shorter piece of the bone, as shown in the cut, breaks off. There will now be left only the breast, with the ribs. The breast can be, without difficulty, disengaged from the ribs by cutting through the latter, which will offer little impediment. The side-bones are now to be taken off; and to do this, the lower end of the back should be turned from the carver, who should press the point of the knife through the top of the backbone, near the centre, bringing it down towards the end of the back completely through the bone. If the knife is now turned in the opposite direction, the joint will be easily separated from the vertebrae. The backbone being now uppermost, the fork should be pressed firmly down on it, whilst at the same time the knife shouldMODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. 5Gi be employed in raising up the lower small end of the fowl towards the fork, and thus the back will be dislocated about its middle. The v/ings, breast, and merrythonght are esteemed the prime parts of a fowl, and are usually served to the ladies of the company, to whom legs, except as a matter of paramount necessity, should not be given. Byron gave it as one reason why he did not like dining with ladies, that they always had the wings of the fowls, which he himself pre- ferred. We heard a gentleman who, when he might have had a wing, declare his partiality for a leg, saying that he had been obliged to eat legs for so long a time, that he had at last come to like them better than the other more prized parts. If the fowl is, capon-like, very large, slices maybe carved from its breast in the same manner as from a turkey's. EOAST rOWL. BOAST FCWIi. 1001. Generally speaking, it is not necessary so completely to cut np a fowl as we have described in the preceding paragraphs, unless, indeed, a large family party is assembled, and there are a number of "little mouths'* to be filled, or some other such circumstances prevail. A roast fowl is carved in the same manner as a boiled fowl, No. 1000 ; viz., by cutting along the line from 1 to 2, and tiien round the leg betv\^een it and the wing. The markings and detached pieces, as shown in the engravings under the heading of '* Boiled Fowl," ' supersede the necessity of our lengthily again describing the operation. It may be added, that the liver, being considered a delicacy, should be divided, and one half served with each wing. In the case of a fowl being stuffed, it will be x>roper to give each guest a portion, unless it be not agreeable to some one of the party. HOAST GOOSE. H 1002. It would not be fair to say that this dish bodes a great deal of happiness to an inexperienced carver, especially if there is a large party to serve, and the slices off the breast should not suffice to satisfy the desires and cravings of many wholesome appetites, produced, may be, by the various sports in vogue at Michaelmas and Christmas. The beginning of the task, however, is not in any way difficult. Evenly-cut slices, not too thicker too thin, EOAST GOOSE.POULTRY. 505 should be carved from the breast in the direction of the Imc from 2 to 3 ; after the first slice has been cut, a hole should be made with the knife in the part called the apron, passing it round the line, as indicated by the figures 1, 1, 1: here the stuffing is located, and some of this should be served on each plate, unless it is discovered that it is not agreeable to the taste of some one guest. If the carver manages cleverly, he will be able to cut a very large number of fine slices ofi" the breast, and the more so if he commences close down by the wing, and carves upwards towards the ridge of the breastbone. As many slices as can be taken from the breast being carved, the wings should be cut ofi'; and the same process as described in carving boiled fowl, is made use of in this in- stance, only more dexterity and greater force will most probably be required: the shape of the leg, when disengaged from the body of the goose, should be like that shown in the accompanying engraving. It will be necessary, perhaps, in taking ofii" the leg, to turn the goose on its side, and then, pressing down the small end of the leg, the knife should be passed under it from the top quite down to the joint; the leg being now turned back by the fork, the knife must cut through the joint, loosening the thigh-bone from its socketo The merrythought, which in a goose is not so large as might be expected, is disengaged in the same way as that of a fowl—by passing the knife under it, and pressing it backwards towards the neck. The neck-bones, of which we give a cut, are freed by the same process as are those of a fowl; and the same maybe said of all the other parts of this bird. The breast of a goose is the part most esteemed; all parts, however, are good, and full of juicy flavour. PIGEON. 1003. A very straightforward plan is adopted in carving a pigeon: the knife is carried sharply in the direction of the line as shown from 1 to 2, entirely through the bird, cutting it into two precisely equal and similar parts. If it is necessary to make three pieces of it, a small wing should be cut ofi" with the leg on either side, thus serving two guests ; and, by this means, there will be sufficient meat left on the breast to send to the third guest.

In carving a boiled rabbit, let the knife be drawn on each side of the backbone, the whole length of the rabbit, as shown by the dotted line 3 to 4: thus the rabbit will be in three parts.

ROAST TUBKEY. 1005. A noble dish is a turkey, roast or boiled. A Christmas dinner, with the middle classes of this empire, would scarcely be a Christmas dinner without its turkey; and we can hardly imagine an object of greater envy than is presented by a respected portly pater- familias carving, at the season devoted to good cheer and genial charity, his own fat BOAST TiTKKEY. turkcy, aud carving it well. The only art consists, as in the carving of a goose, in getting from the breast as many fine slices as possible; and all must have remarked the very great difference in the large number of people whom a good carver will find slices for, and the comparatively few that a bad carver will succeed in serving. As we have stated in both the carving of a duck and goose, the carver should commence cutting slices close to the wing from, 2 to 3, and then proceed upwards towards the ridge of the breastbone: this is not the usual plan, but, in practice, will be found the best. The breast is the only part which is looked on as fine in a turkey, the legs being very, seldom cut off and eaten at table : they are usually removed to the kitchen, where they are taken off, as hero marked, to appear only in a form which seems to have a special attraction at a bachelor's supper-table,—we mean devilled: served in this way, they are especially liked and relished. A boiled turkey is carved in the same manner as when roasted.CHAPTER XXIL GENEBAIi OBSSBVATIONS OH GAME. 1006. The Common Law of England has a maxim, that goods, in which no person can claim any property, belong, by his or her prerogative, to the king or queen. Accordingly, those animals, those ferce naturce, which come under the denomination of game, are, in our laws, styled his or her majesty's, and may therefore, as a matter of course, be granted by the sovereign to another; in consequence of which another may prescribe to possess the same within a certain precinct or lordship. From this circumstance arose the right of lords of manors or others to the game within their respective liberties; and to protect these species of animals, the game laws were originated, and still rem^ain in force. There are innumerable acts of parliament inflicting penalties on persons who may illegally kill game, and some of them are very severe; but they cannot be said to answer their end, nor can it be expected that they ever will, whilst there are so many persons of great wealth who have not otherwise the means of procuring game, except by purchase, and who will have it. These must necessarily encourage poaching, which, to a very large i extent, must continue to render all game laws nugatory as to their intended effects upon the rustic population. IC07. The Object of these Laws, however, is not wholly confined to the restraining of the illegal sportsman. Even qualified or privileged persons508 MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. must not kill game at all seasons. During the day, the hours allowed for sjporting are from one hour before sunrise till one hour after sunset; whilst the time of killing certain species is also restricted to certain seasons. For example^ the season for bustard-shooting is from December 1 to March 1 ; for grouse, or red grouse, from August 12 to December 10 ; heath-fowl, or black-game, from August 20 to December 20; partridges from September 1 to February 12; pheasants from October 1 to February 1; widgeons, wild ducks, wild geese, wild fowls, at any time but in June, July, August, and September. Hares may bo killed at any time of the year, under certain restrictions defined by an act of parliament of the 10th of George 111. ioo8. The Exercise or Diversion of pursuing Four-footed Beasts of Game is called hunting, which, to this day, is followed in the field and the forest, with gun and greyhound. Birds, on the contrary, are not hunted, but shot in the air, or taken with nets and other devices, which is called fowling ; or they are pursued and taken by birds of prey, which is called hawking, a species of sport now fallen almost entirely into desuetude in England, although, in some parts, showing signs of being revived. IC09. In pursuing Four-footed Beasts, such as deer, boars, and hares, properly termed hunting, mankind were, from the earliest ages, engaged. It was the rudest and the most obvious manner of acquiring human support before the agricultural arts had in any degree advanced. It is an employment, however, requiring both art and contrivance, as well as a certain fearlessness of character, combined with the power of considerable physical endurance. Without these, success could not be very great ; but, at best, the occupation is usually accompanied with rude and turbulent habits; and, when combined with these, it constitutes what is termed the savage state of man. As culture advances, and as the soil proportionably becomes devoted to the plough cr to the sustenance of the tamer or more domesticated animals, the range of the huntsman is proportionably limited ; so that when a country has attained to a high state of cultivation, hunting becomes little else than an amusement of the opulent. In the case of fur-bearing animals, however, it is somewhat different; for these continue to supply the wants of civilization with one of its most valuable materials of commerce. loio. The Themes which form the Minstrelsy of the Earliest Ages, either relate to the spoils of the chase or the dangers of the battle-field. Even the sacred writings introduce us to Nimrod, the first mighty hunter before the Lord, and tell us that Ishmael, in the solitudes of Arabia, became a skilful bow- man ; and that David, when yet young, was not afraid to join in combat with the lion or the bear. The Greek mythology teems with hunting exploits. Hercules overthrows the Nemscan lion, the Erymanthean boar, and the hydra of Lerna; Diana descends to the earth, and pursues the stag; whilst ^sculapius, Nestor, Theseus, Ulysses, and Achilles are all followers of the chase. Aristotle, sage as he was, advises young men to apply themselves early to it; and Plato509 GAME. finds in it something divine. Horace exalts it as a preparative exercise for the path of glory, and several of the heroes of Homer are its ardent votaries. The Romans foUov/ed the limiting customs of the Greeks, and the ancient Britons were hunters before Julius Cicsar invaded their shores. 1011. Although THE Ancient Britons followed Hunting, however, they did not confine themselves solely to its pursuit. They bred cattle and tilled the ground, and, to some extent, indicated the rudimentary state of a pastoral and agricultural life; but, in every social change, the sports of the field maintained their place. After the expulsion of the Danes, and during the brief restoration of the Saxon monarchy, these were still followed : even Edvirardtlie Confessor, who would join in no other "secular amusements, took the greatest delight, says William of Malmesbury, " to follow a pack of swift Hounds in pursuit of game, and to cheer them with his voice." 1012. Nor was Edward the only English sovereign who delighted in tho pleasures of the chase. William the Norman, and his two sons who succeeded him, were passionately fond of the sport, and greatly circumscribed the liberties of their subjects in reference to the killing of game. The privilege of hunting in the royal forests was confined to the king and his favourites ; and in order that these umbrageous retreats might be made more extensive, whole villages were depopulated, places of worship levelled with the ground, and every means adopted that might give a sufficient amplitude of space, in accordance with the royal pleasure, for the beasts of the chase. King John was likewise especially attached to the sports of the field ; whilst Edward III. was so enamoured of the exercise, that even during his absence at the wars in France, he took with him sixty couples of stag-hounds and as many hare-hovmds, and every day amused himself either with hunting or hawking. Great in wisdom as the Scotch Solomon, James I., conceited himself to be, he was much addicted to the amusements of hunting, hawking, and shooting. Yea, it is -even asserted that his precious time vras divided between hunting, the bottle, and his standish : to the first he gave his fair weather, to the second his dull, and to the third his cloudy. From his days down to the present, the sports of the field have continued to hold their high reputation, not only for the promotion of health, but for helping to form that manliness of character which enters so largely into the composition of the sons of the British soil. That it largely helps to do this there can be no doubt. The late duke of Grafton, when hunting, was, on one occasion, thrown into a ditch. A young curate, engaged in the same chase, cried out, ^'Lie still, my lord !" leapt over Mm, and pursued his sport. Such an apparent want of feeling might be -expected to have been resented by the duke ; but not so. On his being helped up by his attendant, he said, That man shall have the first good living that falls to my disposal: had he stopped to have given me his sympathy, I never v^^ould have given him anything." Such v/as the manly sentiment of tlie duke, who delighted in the exemplification of a spirit similarly ardent as his own in the sport, and above the baseness of an assumed sorrow.MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. 510 1013. That Hunting has in many Instances been carried to an Excess is well known^ and the match given by the Prince Esterhazy, regent of Hungary, on the signing of the treaty of peace with France, is not the least extraordinary upon record. On that occasion^ there were killed 160 deer, 100 wild boars, 800 hares, and 80 foxes: this was the achievement of one day. Enormous, however, as this slaughter may appear, it is greatly inferior to that made by the contemporary king of Naples on a hunting expedition. That sovereign had a larger extent of ground at his command, and a longer period for the exercise of his talents; consequently, his sport, if it can so be called, was proportion ably greater. It was pursued during his journey to Vienna, in Austria, Bohemia, and Moravia; when he killed 5 bears, 1,820 boars, 1,950 deer, 1,145 does, 1,625 roebucks, 11,121 rabbits, 13 wolves, 17 badgers, 16,354 hares, and 354 foxes. In birds, during the same expedition, he killed 15,350 pheasants and 12,335 partridges. Such an amount of destruction can hardly be called sport ; it resembles more the indiscriminate slaughter of a battle-field, where the scientific engines of civilized warfare are brought to bear upon defenceless savages. 1014. Deer and Hares may be esteemed as the only four-footed animals now hunted in Britain for the ta.ble ; and even these are not follov/ed with the same ardour as they were wont to be. Still, there is no country in the world where the sport of hunting on horseback is carried to such an extent as in Great Britain, and where the pleasures of the chase are so well understood, and conducted on such purely scientific principles. The Fox, of all tho beasts of the field," is now considered to afibrd the best sport. For this, it is infinitely superior to the stag; for the real sportsman can only enjoy that chase when the deer is sought for and found like other game which are pur- sued with hounds. In the case of finding an outlying fallow-deer, which is unharboured, in this manner, great sport is frequently obtained; but this is now rarely to be met with in Britain. In reference to hare-hunting, it is much followed in many parts of this and the sister island ; but, by the true foxhunter, it is considered as a sport only fit to be pursued by women and old men. Although it is less dangerous and exciting than the fox-chase, how- ever, it has great charms for those who do not care for the hard riding which the other requires. 1015. The Art of taking or killing Birds is called '^fowling," and is either practised as an amusement by persons of rank or property, or for a livelihood by persons who use nets and other apparatus. "When practised as an amuse- ment, it principally consists of killing them with a light firearm called a " fowling-piece," and the sport is secured to those who pursue it by the game laws. The other means by which birds are taken, consist in imitating their voices, or leading them, by other artifices, into situations where they become entrapped by nets, birdhme, or otherwise. For taking large numbers of birds, the pipe or call is the most common means employed; and this is done during the months of September and October. We will here briefly give aGAME. 511 description of the modus operandi pursued in this sport. A thin wood is ilsiially the spot chosen, and, under a tree at a Httle distance from the others, a cabin is erected, and there are only such branches left on the tree as are necessary for the placing of the birdlime, and which are covered with it. Around the cabin are placed avenues with twisted perches, also covered with birdlime. Having thus prepared all that is necessary, the birdcatcher places himself in the cabin, and, at sunrise and sunset, imitates the cry of a small bird calling the others to its assistance. Supposing that the cry of the owl is imitated, immediately different kinds of birds will flock together at the cry of their common enemy, when, a-t every instant, they will be seen falling to the ground, their wings being of no use to them, from their having come in contact with the birdUme. The cries of those which are thus situated now • attract others, and thus are large numbers taken in a short space of time. If owls were themselves desired to be taken, it is only during the night that this can be done, by counterfeiting the squeak of the mouse. Larks, other birds, and v\'ater-fowl, are sometimes taken by nets ; but to describe fully the manner in vv hich this is done, would here occupy too much space. 1016. Feathered Game have from time immemorial given gratification to the palate of man. With the exception of birds of prey, and some other species, Moses permitted his people to eat them ; and the Egyptians made offerings to their priests of their most delicate birds. The ancient Greeks commenced their rei3asts with little roasted birds ; and feathered game, amongst the Romans, was served as the second course. Indeed, several of the dLiiQiQiit goimnands i\iQ imperial city" were so fond of game, that they brought themselves to ruin by eating flamingoes and pheasants. Some I modern nations, the French among others," srxys Monsieur Soyer, " form.erly I ate the heron, crane, crow, stork, swan, corm-orant, and bittern. The first three especially were highly esteemed ; and Lalllevant, cook of Charles VII., teaches us how to prepare these meagre, tough birds. Belon says, that in spite of its revolting taste when unaccustomed to it, the bittern is, however, among the delicious treats of the French. This writer also asserts, that a falcon or a vulture, either roasted or boiled, is excellent eating ; and that if one of these birds happened to kill itself in flying after game, the falconer instantly cooked it. Lebaut calls the heron a royal viand." 1017. The Heron WAS HUNTED by the Hawk, and the sport of hawking is usually placed at the head of those amusements that can only be practised in the country. This precedency it probably obtained from its being a pastime so generally followed by the nobility, not in Great Britain only, but likewiso on the continent. In former times, persons of high rank rarely appeared in public without their dogs and their hawks : the latter they carried v/ith them when they journeyed from one country to another, and sometimes even took I them to battle with them, and would not part with them when taken prisoners, j even to obtain their own liberty. Such birds were esteemed as the ensigns of nobility, and no action was reckoned more dishonourable in a man of rank than512 MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERT. that of giving np his hawk. We have abeady alkided to the hunting propen- sities of our own Edward III., and w^e may also allude to his being equally ad- dicted to hawking. According to Froissart, when this sovereign invaded France, he took with him thirty falconers on horseback, who had charge of his hawks, and every day, as his royal fancy inclined him, he either hunted, or went to the river for the purpose of hawking. In the great and powerful, the pursuit of game as a sport is allowable, but in those who have to earn their bread by the sweat of their brow, it is to be condemned. In Burton's Anatomy of Melancholy" we find a humorous story, told by Poggius, the Florentine, who reprobates this folly in such persons. It is this. A physician of Milan, that cured madmen, had a pit of water in his house, in which he kept his patients, some up to the knees, some to the girdle, some to the chin^ i^ro onodo insaniWj as they were more or less affected. One of them by chance, that was well recovered, stood in the door, and seeing a gallant pass by with a hawk on his fist, well mounted, with his spaniels after him, would needs know to what use all this preparation served. He made answer. To kill certain fowl. The patient demanded again, what his fowl might be worth which he killed in a year ? He replied, Five or ten crowns ; and when he urged him further, what his dogs, horse, and hawks stood him in, he told him four hundred crowns. With that the patient bade him begone, as he loved his life and welfare ; ''for if our master come and find thee here, he will put thee in the pit, amongst the madmen, up to the chin.'' Thus reproving the madness of such men as will spend themselves in those vain sports, to the neglect of their business and necessary affairs. 1018. As THE INEVITABLE Eesult OP SOCIAL PROGRESS is, at least to limit, if not entirely to suppress, such sports as we have here been treating of, much of the romance of country life has passed away. This is more especially the case with falconry, which had its origin about the middle of the fourth century, although^ lately, some attem^Dts have been rather successfully, made to institute a revival of the gentle art" of hawking. Julias Firmicus, who lived about that time, is, so far as we can find, the I first Latin author who speaks of falconers, and the art of teaching one species of birds to fly after and catch others. The occupation of these functionaries has now, however, all but ceased. New and nobler efforts characterize the aims of mankind in the develoj^ment of their civilization, and the sports of the field have, to a large extent, been superseded by other exercises, it may be less healthful and invigorating, but certainly more elegant^ intellectual, and humanizing.RECIPESo CHAPTER XXIII. BOAST BLACK-COCK. 1019. Ikgeedients.—Black-cock, butter, toast. 3Iode.—Let these birds hang for a few days, or they will be tough and tasteless, if not well kept. Pluck and draw them, and wipe the insides and outsides with a damp cloth, as washing spoils the flavour. Cut off the heads, and truss them, the same as a roast fowl, cutting off the toes, and scalding and peeling the feet. Trus- sing them with the head on, as shown in the engraving, is still practised by many cooks, but the former method is now considered the best. Put them down to a brisk fire, well baste them with butter, and serve v/ith a piece of toast under, and a good gravy and bread sauce. After trussing, some cooks cover the breast with vine-leaves and slices of bacon, and then roast them. They should be served in the same manner and with the same accompani- ments as with the plainly-roasted birds. Time.—45 to 50 minutes. Average costy from 5s. to 6s. the brace; but seldom bought. Sufficient^—2 or 3 for a dish. Seasonahle from the middle of August to the end of December. The Black-cock, Heath-cock, ]Mooa-FOWL,OB Heath-poult.—This bird somelhiios weighs as much as four pounds, and the hen about two. It is at present confined to the mora northern parts of Britain, culture and extending population having united in driving it into more desolate regions, except, jperhaps, in a few of the more wild and less-frequented portions of England. It may still be found in the New Forest, in Hampshire, Dartmoor, and Sedgmoor, in Devonshire, and among the hills of Somersetshire, contiguoiis to the latter. It may also be found in Staf- fordshire, in North Wales, and again in j the north of England; but nowhere so I plentiful as in some parts of the Iligh- i lands of Scotland. The males are hardly j distinguishable from the females until tiey are about half-grown, when the black 2 L BLACK-COCK.MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. 514 feathers begin to appear, first about tbe sides and breast. Their food consists of the tops of birch and heath, except when the mountain berries are ripe, at which period they eagerly and even voraciously pick the bilberries and cranberries from the bushes. Large numbers of these birds are found in Norway, almost rivalling the turkey in point of size. Some of them have begun to be imported into London, where they are vended in the shops; but the flavour of their flesh is not equal to that of the Scotch bird. HASHED WILD DUCK. 1020. Ingredients.—The remains of cold roast wild duck, 1 pint of good brown gravy, 2 tablespoonfuls of bread crumbs, 1 glass of claret, salt, cayenne, and mixed spices to taste ; 1 tablespoonful of lemon or Seville orange-juice. 3fode,—Cut the remains of the duck into neat joints, put them into a stewpan, with all the above ingredients ; let them get gradually hot by the side of the fire, and occasionally stir the contents; when on the point of boiling, serve, and garnish the dish with sippets of toasted bread. Tme.—About 5 hour. Seasonable from November to February. BAGOUT OP WILD DUCK. 1021. Ingeedients.—2 wild ducks, 4 shalots, 1 pint of stock Ko. 105, 1 glass of port wine, 1 oz. of butter, a little flour, the juice of I lemon, cayenne and salt to taste. 3Iode.—D\xGks that have been dressed and left from the preceding day will answer for this dish. Cut them into joints, reserve the legs, wings, and breasts until wanted ; put the trimmings into a stewpan with the shalots and stock, and let them simmer for about i hour, and strain the gravy. Put the butter into a stewpan ; when melted, dredge in a little flour, and pour in the gravy made from the bones; give it one boil, and strain it again; add the wine, lemon-juice, and cayenne; lay in the pieces of duck, and let the whole gradually warm through, but do not allow it to boil, or the duck will be hard. The gravy should not be too thick, and should be very highly seasoned. The squeeze of a Seville orange is a great improvement to this dish. Tune.—About | hour to make the gravy ; i hour for the duck gradually to warm through. Seasonable from JSTovember to February. BOAST WILD DUCK. 1022. Ingeedients.—Wild duck, flour, butter. lfo<fe.—Carefully pluck and draw them; cut oiF the heads close to the necks, leaving sufficient skin to turn over, and do not cut oif theMODERN MODE OF SERVING DISHES.GAME. 515 EOAST WILD DTrCK, feet; some twist eacli leg at the knuckle, and rest tlie claws on each side of the breast; others truss them as shown in our illustration, lloast the birds before a quick fire, and, when they are first put down, let them remain for 5 minutes without basting (this will keep the gravy in); afterwards baste plen- tifully with butter, and a few minutes before serving dredge them lightly with flour; baste well, and send them to table nicely frothed, and full of gravy. If overdone, the birds will lose their flavour. Serve with a good gravy in the dish, or orange gravy, "No. 488 ; and send to table with them a cut lemon. To take ofi" the fishy taste which wild fowl sometimes have, baste them for a few minutes with hot water to which have been added an onion and a little salt; then take away the pan, and baste with butter.—See coloured plate, Gr 1. Time.—"When liked underdressed, 20 to 25 minutes; well done, 25 to 35 minutes. Average cost, 4s. to 5s. the couple. Sufficient,—2 for a dish. Seasonable from November to February. The Wild Duck.—The male of tlie wild duck is called a mallard; and the young ones are called flappers. The time to try to find a brood of these is about the month of July, among the rushes of the deepest and most retired parts of some brook or stream, where, if the old bird is sprung, it may be taken as a certainty that its brood is not far off. When once found, flappers are easily killed, as they attain their full growth before their wings are fledged. Consequently, the sport is more like hunting water-rats than shoot- ing birds. When the flappers take wing, they assume the name of wild ducks, and about the month of August repair to the corn-fields, where they remain lentil they are disturbed by the harvest- people. They then frequent the rivers pretty early in the evening, and give excellent sj)ort to those who have pa- tience to wait for them. In order to know a wild due' the claws, which should be black. TES WILD DUCK. , it is necessary only to look at HASHED GAME (Cold Meat Cookery). 1023. Ii^GEEDiEjiTTS.—The remains of cold game, 1 onion stuck with 3 cloves, a few whole peppers, a strip of lemon-peel, salt to taste, thickening of butter and flour, 1 glass of port wine, 1 tablespoonful of lemon-juice, 1 tablespoonful of ketchup, 1 pint of water or weak stock. Mode.—Cnt the remains of cold game into joints, reserve the best 2 L 2516 MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. pieces, and tlie inferior ones and trimmings put into a stewpan with the onion, pepper, lemon-peel, salt, and water or weak stock; stew these for about an hour, and strain the gravy ; thicken it with butter and flour; add the wine, lemon-juice, and ketchup; lay in the pieces of game, and let them gradually warm through by the side of the fire ; do not allow it to boil, or the game will be hard. When on tho point of simmering, serve, and garnish the dish with sippets of toasted bread. Time.—Altogether If hour. Seasonahle from August to March. J^ote.—Any kind of game may bo hashed by the above recipe, and the flavour may be varied by adding flavom-ed vinegars, curry powder, &c.; but wo cannot recommend these latter ingredients, as a dish of game shoukl really have a gamy taste; and if too many sauces, essences, ko., are added to the gravy, they quite overpower and destroy the flavour the dish should possess. GEOUSE PIE. 1024. Ik-geedients.—Grrouse; cayenne, salt, and pepper to taste; 1 lb. of rump-steak, ^ pint of well-seasoned broth, pufr paste. 3Iode.—Line the bottom of a pie-dish with the rump-steak cut into neat pieces, and, should the grouse be large, cut them into joints; but, if small, they may be laid in the pie whole; season highly with salt, cayenne, and black pepper; pour in the broth, and cover with a pufF paste; brush the crust over v/ith the yolk of an egg, and bake from f to 1 hour. If the grouse is cut into joints, the backbones and trimmings will make the gravy, by stewing them with an onion, a little sherry, a bunch of herbs, and a blade of mace: this should be poured in after the pie is baked. 2 WW.—I to 1 hour. Average cost^ exclusive of the grouse, which are seldom bought, Is. 9cL Seasonable from the 12th of August to the beginning of December, HOAST aSOUSE. 1025. iNaEEDiENTS.—Grouse, butter, a thick slice of toasted bread. Mode.—Let the birds hang as long as possible; pluck and draw them ; wipe, but do not wash them, in- side and out, and truss them without the head, the same as for a roast fowl. Many persons still continue to truss BOAST GRorsB. them with the head under the wing, but517 GAME. the former is now considered the most approved method. Put them down to a sharp clear fire ; keep them well basted the whole of the time they are cooking, and serve them on a buttered toast, soaked in the dripping-pan, with a little melted butter poured over them, or with bread-sauce and gravy.—See coloured plate, L1. Time.—i hour; if liked very thoroughly done, 35 minutes. Average cost, 2s. to 2s. Q>d. the brace ; but seldom bought. Sufficient,—2 for a dish. Seasonahle from the 12th of August to the beginning of December. Grouse.—Those birds are divided into wood grouse, black grouse, red grouse, and white grouse. The wood grouse is further distinguished as the cock of the wood, or capercalzie, aud is as large as the turkey, being about two feet niue inches in length, aud weighing from twelve to fif- teen pounds. The female is considerably less than the male, and, in the colour of her feathers, differs widely from the other. This beautiful species is found principally in lofty, mountainous region?, and is very rare iu Great Britain; but in the pine forests of Eussia, Sweden, aud other northern countries, it is very common. In these it has its habitat, feeding on the cones of the trees, and the fruits of various kinds of plants, espe- cially the berry of the juniper. Black grouse is also distinguished as black-game, or the black-cock. It is not larger than the common hen, and weighs only about four pounds. The female is about one-third less than the male, and also differs considerably from him in point of colour. Like the former, they are found chiefly in high situations, and are common in Eussia, Siberia, and other northern countries. They are also found in the northern parts of Great Britain, feeding in winter on the various berries and fruits belongiugto mountainous countries, aud, in summer, frequently descending to the lower lands, to feed upon corn. The red grouse, orcock, or moor-cock, weighs about nineteen ounces, and the female somewhat less. n the wild heathy tracts of the northern counties of England it is plentiful, also in Wales and the Highlands of Scotland. Mr. Pennant considered it peculiar to Britain, those found in the mountainous parts of Spain, France, and Italy, being only varieties of the same bird. "White grouse, white game, or ptarmigan, is nearly the same size as the red grouse, and is found in lofty situations, where it supports itself in the severest weather. It is to be met with in most of the northern countries of Europe, and appears even in Greenland. In the Hebrides, Orkneys, and the Highlands of Scotland, it is also found J and sometimes, though rarely, among the fells of Northumberland and Cumber- land. In winter they fly in flocks, and are so little familiar with the sight of man, thai; they are easily shot, and even snared. They feed on the wild produce of the hills, whicli sometimes imparts to their flesh a bitter but not unpalatable taste. According to Buffou, it is dark-coloured, and somewhat flavoured like the hare. GROUSE SALAD. (Soger's Eecijye.) 1026. Ingeedients.—S eggs, butter, fresh salad, 1 or 2 grouse; for the sauce, 1 teaspoonful of minced shalot, 1 teaspoonful of pounded sugar, the yolk of 1 egg, 1 teaspoonful of minced parsley, ^ oz. of salt, 4 tablespoonfuls of oil, 2 tablespoonfuls of Chili vinegar, 1 gill of cream. BED GEOUSE.MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. 518 Mode.—Boil the eggs hard, shell them, throw them into cold water cut a thin slice oii the bottom to facilitate the proper placing of them in the dish, cut each one into four lengthwise, and make a very thin flat border of butter, about one inch from the edge of the dish the salad is to be served on; fix the pieces of egg upright close to each other, the yolk outside, or the yolk and white alternately; lay in the centre a fresh salad of whatever is in season, and, having previously roasted the grouse rather underdone, cut it into eight or ten pieces, and prepare the sauce as follows :—Put the shalots into a basin, with the sugar, the yolk of an egg, the parsley, and salt, and mix in by degrees the oil and vinegar; when these ingredients are well mixed, put the sauce on ice or in a cool place. "When ready to serve, whip the cream rather thick, which lightly mix with it; then lay the inferior parts of the grouse on the salad, sauce over so as to cover each piece, then lay over the salad and the remainder of the grouse, pour the rest of the sauce over, and serve. The eggs may be ornamented with a little dot of radishes or beetroot on the point. Anchovy and gherkin, cut into small diamonds, may be placed between, or cut gherkins in slices, and a border of them laid round. Tarragon or chervil-leaves are also a pretty addition. The remains of cold black-game, pheasant, or partridge may be used in the above manner, and will make a very delicate dish. Average cost, 2s. 6d. Seasonable from the 12th of August to the beginning of December. The Capeecalzie.—This bird was to be met with formerly botli in Ireland and Scotland, but is now extinct. The male lives separate from the females, except in the breeding season. Its manners and habits are very like those of black grouse, except that it seems to be wholly confined to forests of pine, on the tender shoots of which it feeds. It is by no means uncommon in the woods of Norway, whence we received it. It is also found abundant in Russia, Siberia, Italy, and in some portions of the Alps. It was, in 1760, last seen in Scotland, in the woods of Strathglass. Eeeent at- tempts have been made to re-introduce it into that country, but without success j principally owing, as we should imagine, to the want of sufficient food suitable for THE CAPEECALZIE. its sustenance. G-ROrsE,—Under this general term are included several species of game birds, called black, red, woodland, and white grouse. The black is larger than the red (see No. 1025), and is not so common, and therefore held in higher estimation. The red, however, is a bird of exquisite flavour, and is a native of the mountainous districts of Scotland and the north of England. It feeds on the tops of the heath and the berries that grow amongst them: its colour is a rich chestnut, striped with black. The woodland, or cock of the wood, is the largest among the bird tribes which pass under the denomi- nation of game. It is smaller than the turkey, and was originally common in our mountains; but it is now to be found only in the mountains of Scotland, though it still519 GAME. abounds in the nortli of Europe, Germany, and in the Alps. It is esteemed as delicious eating, and its plumage is extremely beautiful. The white grouse, or ptarmigan, is not a plentiful bird in Britain ; but it is still found in the islands, and weighs about half a pound. The London market is supplied by Norway and Scotland; those from the former country being esteemed the best. When young, it is held in high estimation, being considered as little diiierent from common grouse. ROAST HARE. 1027. Ingeedien'TS.—Hare, forcemeat No. 417, a little milk, butter Choosing and Ti^ussing.—Choose a young liare; which may be known by its smooth and sharp claws, and by the cleft in the lip not being much spread. To be eaten in perfection, it must hang for some time ; and, if properly taken care of, it may be kept for several days. It is better to hang without being paunched; but should it be previ- ously emptied, wipe the inside every day, and sprinkle over it a little pepper and ginger, to prevent the musty taste which long keeping in the damp occasions, and which also affects the stuffing. After it is skinned, wash it well, and soak for an hour in warm water to draw out the blood ; if old, let it lie ^-^^^^ in vinegar for a short time, but wash it well afterwards in several waters. Make (^^S^^^^^k a forcemeat by recipe No. 417, wipe the ^^^^^^^^^^^^^5 hare dry^ fill the belly with it, and sew it ^^^^^^^^^ThIee'"*"*'^ up. Bring the hind and fore legs close to the body towards the head, run a skewer through each, fix the head between the shoulders by means of another skewer, and be careful to leave the ears on. Put a string round the body from skewer to skewer, and tie it above the back. 3£ode.—The hare should be kept at a distance from the fire when it is first laid down, or the outside will become dry and hard before the inside is done. Baste it well with milk for a short time, and afterwards with butter ; and particular attention must be paid to the basting, so as to preserve the meat on the back juicy and nutritive. When it is almost roasted enough, flour the hare, and baste well with butter. When nicely frothed, dish it, remove the skewers, and send it to table with a little gravy in the dish, and a tureen of the same. Red-currant jelly must also not be forgotten, as this is an indispensable accompa- niment to roast hare. For economy, good beef dripping may be substi- tuted for the milk and butter to baste with ; but the basting, as we have before stated, must be continued without intermission. If the liver is good, it may be parboiled, minced, and mixed with the stufiing; but it should not be used unless quite fresh.—See coloured plate, E1.

Sufficient for 5 or 6 persons. Seasonalle from September to the end of February. The Haee.—This little aUE HAKE. ,niinal is found generally distributed over Europe, and, indeed, in most parts of tlie northern v/orld. Its extreme timidity is the en- dowment which Providence has bestowed \^pon it as a means of defence; it is therefore attentive to every sound, and is supplied with ears both long and tubular, with which it can hear with great acuteness. Its eyes, also, are so constructed, and placed so i^rominent in its head, that it can see both before and behind it. It lives entirely upon vege- tables, but its flesh is considered dry, notwithstanding that it is deemed, in many respects, superior to that of tlio rabbit, being more savoury, and of a much higher flavour. Its general time of feeding is the evening ; but during tho day, if not disturbed, it adheres closely to iiBform. POTTED HAIIE (a Lunclieon or Breakfast Disli). 1028. Ikckedients.—1 bare, a few slices of bacon, a large bunch of savoury herbs, 4 cloves, \ teaspoonful of whole allspice, 2 carrots, 2 onions, salt and pepper to taste, 1 pint of water, 2 glasses of sherry. 3'Iode,—Skin, empty, and wash the hare ; cut it down the middle, and put it into a stewpan, with a few slices of bacon under and over it; add the remaining ingredients, and stew very gently until the hare is tender, and the flesh will separate easily from the bones. When done enough, take it up, remove the bones, and pound the meat, ivitli the hacon, in a mortar, until reduced to a perfectly smooth paste. Should it not be sufficiently seasoned, add a little cayenne, salt, and pounded mace, but be careful that these are well mixed with the other ingredients. Press the meat into potting-pots, pour over clarified butter, and keep in a dry place. The liquor that the hare was stewed in, should be saved for hashes, soups, &c. &c. Time—Khont 2A hours to stew the hare. Seasonable from September to the end of February. BROIIjED HABE (a Supper or Luncheon Disli). 1029. Inghedients.—The leg and shoulders of a roast hare, cayenno and salt to taste, a little butter. 3Iode.—Q\x.t the legs and shoulders from a roast hare, season them highly with salt and cayenne, and broil them over a very clear fire for 5 minutes. Dish them on a hot dish, rub over them a little cold butter, and send to table very quickly. Time,—5 minutes.GAJIE, HASHED HAEE. 1030.

Mode,—"Wash the hare nicely, cut it up into joints (not too larg-e), and flour and brown them as in the preceding recipe ; then put them into a stewpan with the herbs, onions, cloves, allspice, pepper, and lemon-peel; cover with hot water, and when it boils, carefully remove all the scum, and let it simmer gently till tender, which will be in about If hour, or longer, should the hare be very old. Take out tho pieces of hare, thicken the gravy with flour and butter, add the ketchup and port wine, let it boil for about 10 minutes, strain it through a sieve over the hare, and serve. A few fried forcemeat balls should be added at the moment of serving, or instead of frying them, they may be stewed in the gravy, about 10 minutes before the hare is wanted for table. Do not omit to serve red-currant jelly | with it. j Time.—Altogether 2 hours. Average cost, 5s. 6d. \ Sufficient for 7 or 8 persons. ; Seasonahle from September to the end of February. \ Note.—Should there be any left, rewarm it the next day by putting the j hare, &c. into a covered jar, and placing this jar in a saucepan of boiling water : this method prevents a great deal of waste. ^ BOAST liANDKAIL, OR COm^-CRAKE. 3033.

The Landeail, oe Cohn-Crake.—This bird is migratory in its habits, yet from its formation, it seems ill adapted for long atrial passages, its wings being short, and placed so forward out of the centre of gravity, that it flies in an extremely heavy and embarrassed manner, and with its legs hanging down. "When it alights, it can hardly be sprung a second time, as it runs very fast, and seems to depend for its safety more on the swiftness of its feet than the ■celerity of its wings. It makes its appear- ance in England about the same time as the quail, that is, in the months of April and May, and frequents the same places. Its singular cry is first heard when the grass becomes long enough to shelter it, and it continues to be heard until the grass is cut. The bird, however, is seldom seen, for it constantly skulks among the thickest portions of the herbage, and runs so nimbly through it, doubling and winding in every direction, that it is difficult to get near it. It leaves this island before the winter, and repairs to other countries in search of its food, which principally consists of slugs, large numbers of which it destroys. It is very common in Ireland, and, whilst migrating to this country, is seen in great numbers in the island of Anglesea. On its first arrival in England, it is so lean as scarcely to weigh above five or six o'iinces; before its departure, however, it has been known to exceed eight ounces, and ia then most delicious eating.

When at hand; a few mushrooms should alwa^^s be added, ♦ POTTED PAETBIDQB. 1037. iNaEEDiENTS.—Partridges; seasoning to taste of mace, allspice white pepper, and salt; butter, coarse paste. Mode.—Pluck and draw the birds, and wipe them inside with a damp cloth. Pound well some mace, allspice, vmite pepper, and salt; mix together, and rub every part of the partridges with this. Pack the birds as closely as possible in a baldng-pan, with plenty of butter over them, and cover with a coarse flour and water crust. Tie a paper over this, and bake for rather more than I-2- hour; let the birds get cold, then cut them into pieces for keeping, pack them closely into a large potting-pot, and cover with clarified butter. This should be kept in a cool dry place. The butter used for potted things will answer for basting, or for paste for meat pies.—See coloured plate, D1. Time.—li hour. Seasonable from the 1st of September to the beginning of February. SAIsMI BE PEBDBIX, or HASHED PAHTBIDG-ES. 1038. Ikgeediekts.—3 young partridges, 3 shalots, a slice of lean ham, 1 carrot, 3 or 4 mushrooms, a bunch of savoury herbs, 2 cloves, 6 whole peppers, f pint of stock, 1 glass of sherry or Madeira, a small lump of sugar. Mode.—Aiiev the partridges are plucked and drawn, roast themGAME. 525 ratlier underdone, and cover tliem with paper, as tliey should not he browned; cut them into joints, take off the skin from the wings, legs, and breasts; put these into a stcwpan, cover them up, and set by until the gravy is ready. Cut a slice of ham into small pieces, and put them, with the carrots sliced, the shalots, mushrooms, herbs, cloves, and pepper, into a stewpan; fry them lightly in a little butter, pour in the stock, add the bones and trimming from the partridges, and simmer for i hour. Strain the gravy, let it cool, and skim off every particle of fat; put it to the legs, wings, and breasts, add a glass of sherry or Madeira and a small lump of sugar, let all gradually warm through by the side of the fire, and when on the point of boiling, serve, and garnish the dish with croutons. The remains of roast partridge answer very well dressed in this wa}'', although not so good as when the birds are in the first instance only half-roasted. This recipe is equally suitable for pheasants, moor- game, &c.; but care must be taken always to skin the joints. Time.—Altogether 1 hour. SifdJicient.—2 or 3 partridges for an entree. Seasonable from the 1st of September to the beginning of February. BOAST PARTBIDGE. 1039. Ikgeedieis'TS.—Partridge ; butter. Choosing and Trussing,—Choose young birds, with dark-coloured bills and yellowish legs, and let them hang a few days, or there will be no fiavour to the fiesh, nor will it be tender. The time they should be kept, entirely depends on the taste of those for v/hom they are intended, as what some persons would consider delicious, would be to others disgusting and offensive. They may be trussed with or without the head, the latter mode being noYi^ considered the most fashionable. Pluck, draw, and wipe the partridge care- fully inside and out; cut ofi^ the head, leaving sufficient skin on the neck to skewer back ; bring the legs close to the breast, between it and the side-bones, and pass a skewer through the pinions and the thick part of the thighs. Y»^hen the head is left on, it should be brought round and fixed on to the point of the skewer. Mode.—When the bird is firmly and plumply trussed, roast it before a nice bright fire; keep it well basted, and a few minutes before serving, fiour and froth it well. Dish it, and serve with gravy and bread sauce, and send to table hot and quickly. A little of the gravy should be poured over the bird.—See coloured plate, D1.MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. Time,—25 to 35 minutes. Average cost, Is. Qd. to 25. a brace. Sufficient—2 for a dish. Seasonable from tlie 1st of September to the beginning of February. The PAETiiiDGE.--This bird is to be found in nearly all the temperate countries of Europe, but is most abundant in tlie Ukraine, although it is unable to bear the extremes of climate, whether hot or cold. It was formerly very common in France, and is considered a table luxury in England. The instinct of this bird is frequently exemplified in a remarkable manner, for the preservation of its young. " I have seen it often," says' a very celebrated writer, and an accurate observer of nature, "and once in particular, I saw an extraordinary instance of an old bird's solicitude to save its brood. As I was hunting with a young pointer, the dog ran on a brood of very small partridges; the old bird cried, fluttered, and ran tumbling along just before the dog's nose, till she had drawn him to a PAHTBIDGES, considerable distance, when she took wing, and flew still further olF, but not out of the field; on this the dog returned to me, near the place where the young ones lay concealed in the grass, which the old bird no sooner perceived than she flew back to us, settled just before the dog's nose again, and by rolling and tumbling about, drew off his attention from her young, and thus preserved her brood a second time. I have also seen, when a kite has been hovering over a covey of young partridges, the old birds fly up at the bird of prey, screaming and fighting with all their might to preserve their brood." Partridges should be chosen young; if old, they are valueless. The young ones are generally known by their yellow legs and dark-coloured bills. PHEASANT OUTLETS. 1040. iNaEEDiENTS.—2 or 3 pboasants, egg and bread crumbs, cayenne and salt to taste, brown gravy. Mode.—Procure 3 young pheasants that have been hung a few days; pluck, draw, and wipe them inside; cut them into joints; remove the bones from the best of these; and the backbones, trim- mings, &c., put into a stewpan, with a little stock, herbs, vegetables, seasoning, &c., to make the gravy. Flatten and trim the cutlets of a good shape, egg and bread crumb them, broil them over a clear fire, pile them high in the dish, and pour under them the gravy made from the bones, which should be strained, flavoured, and thickened. One of the small bones should be stuck on the point of each cutlet. Time.—10 minutes. Average cost, 2s. 6d. to 35. each. Sufficient for 2 entrees. Seasonable from the 1st of October to the beginning of February. nOAST PHEASANT. 1041. Ik-geediekts.—Pheasant, flour, butter. Clioosing and Trussing.—pheasants may be known by the length527 GASIE. KOAST PHEASANT. and sharpness of tlieir spurs; in young ones tliey are short and blunt. The cock bird is generally reckoned the best, except when the hen is with egg. They should hang some time before they are dressed, as, if they are cooked fresh, the flesh will be exceedingly dry and tasteless. After the bird is plucked and drawn, wipe the inside with a damp cloth, and truss it in the same manner as partridge, No. 1039. If the head is left on, as shown in the engraving, bring it round under the wing, and fix it on to the point of the skewer. Mode.—lioast it before a brisk fire, keep it well basted, and flour and froth it nicely. Serve with brown gravy, a little of which should be poured round the bird, and a tureen of bread sauce. 2 or 3 of the pheasant's best tail-feathers are sometimes stuck in the tail as an ornament; but the fashion is not much to be commended.—See coloured plate, Fl. Time.—i to 1 hour, according to the size. Average costy 2s. 6c?. to 35. each. Sufficient,—1 for a dish. Seasonable from the 1st of October to the beginning of February, The Pheasa"nt.—This beautiful bird is said to have been discovered by the Argonauts on the banks of the Phasis, near Mount Ararat, in their expedition to Colchis. It is common, however, in almost all the southern parts of the European conti- nent, and has been long naturalized in the warmest and most woody counties of England. It is very common in France | indeed, so common as to be esteemed a nuisance by the farmers. Although it has been domesticated, this is not easily accomplished, nor is its flesh so palatable then as it is in the wild state. Mr. Ude says—'* It is not often that pheasants are met with possessing that exquisite taste which is acquired only by long keeping, as the damp of this climate prevents their being kept as long as they are in other countries. The hens, in general, are the most delicate. The cocks show their age by their spurs. They are only fit to be eaten when the blood begins to run from the bin, which is commonly six days or a week after they have been killed. The flesh is white, tender, and has a good fiavciir, if you keep it long enoughif not, it is not much different from that of a commoH fowl or hen." BRILLAT SAVABIN'S RECIPE FOR ROAST PHEASANT, a la Sainte Alliance. 1042. When the pheasant is in good condition to be cooked (see No. 1041), it should be plucked, and not before. The bird should then be stuffed in the following manner :—Take two snipes, and draw them, putting the bodies on one plate, and the livers, &c., on another. Take off the flesh, and mince it THE PHEiiSANT.MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. 523 finely with a little beef, l(xvd, a few truffles^ pepper and salt to taste, and stuff the iDlicasant carefully with this. Cut a slice of bread, larger consider- ably than the bird, and cover it with the liver, &c., and a few truffles : an anchovy and a little fresh butter added to these will do no harm. Put the bread, &c., into the dripping-pan, and, when the bird is roasted, place it on the preparation, and surround it with Florida oranges. Do not be uneasy, Savarin adds, about your dinner; for a pheasant served in this way is fit for beings better than men. The pheasant itself is a xery good bird; and, imbibing the dressing and the flavour of the truffle and snii30, it becomes thrice better. BBOILED PHSASArTT (a Breakfast or Luncheon Dish). 1043. Ingeedie:n'ts.—1 pheasant, a little lard, egg and bread crumbs, salt and cayenne to taste. llode.—Cat the legs ofr at the first joint, and the remainder of the bird into neat pieces; put them into a fryingpan with a little lard, and when browned on both sides, and about half done, take them out and drain them; brush the pieces over with egg, and sprinkle with bread crumbs with which has been mixed a good seasoning of cayenne and salt. Broil them over a moderate fire for about 10 minutes, or rather longer, and serve with mushroom-sauce, sauce piquante, or brown gravy, in which a few game-bones and trimmings have been stewed. Ttjne.—Altogether | hour. Sufficient for 4 or 5 persons. Seasonable from the 1st of October to the beginning of February. The Height of Excellence in a Pheasant.—Things edible have tlieir degrees of excellence under various civcumstauces : thus, asparagus, capers, peas, and partridges are best when young. Perfection in others is only reached when they attain maturity: let us say, for example, melons and nearly all fruits (we must except, perhaps, tno medlar), with the majority of those animals whose flesji we eat. But others, again, arc not good until decomposition is about to set in; and here we may mention particularly the snipe and the pheasant. If the latter bird be eaten so soon as three days after it has been killed, it then has no peculiarity of flavour; a pullet would be more relished, and a quail would surpass it in aroma. Kept, however, a proper length of time,—and tliis can be ascertained by a slight smell and change of colour,—then it becomes a highly- flavoured dish, occupying, so to speak, the middle distance between chicken and venison. It is difficult to deiine any exact time to hang " a pheasant; but an}' one possessed of the instincts of gastronomical science,^ can at once detect the right moment when a pheasant should be taken down, in the same way as a good cook knows whether a bird should be removed from the spitj or have a turn or two more. TO DBSSS PLOVEB3. 1044. IifGEEDiEXTS.—-3 plovers, butter, flour, toasted bread. Choosing and Trussing.—Choose those that feel hard at the vent, as that shows their fatness. There are three sorts,—the grey, green, and bastard plover, or lapwing. They will keep good for some time, but if very stale, the feet will be very dry. Plovers are scarcely tit for anything but roasting; they are, however, sometimes stewed, orGAME. 629 jnade into a ragout, but this mode of cooking is not to be recom- mended. Mode.—Vluak off the feathers, wipe the outside of the birds with a damp cloth, and do not draw them ; truss with the head under the wing, put them down to a clear fire, and lay slices of moistened toast in the dripping-pan, to catch the trail. Keep them well hasted, dredge them lightly with flour a few minutes before they are done, and let them be nicely frothed. Dish them on the toasts, over which the trail should be equally spread. Pour round the toast a little good gravy, and send some to table in a tureen. Time—10 minutes to j hour. Average cost, Is. Qd. the brace, if plentiful. Sufficient for 2 persons. Seasonable,—In perfection from the beginning of September to the €nd of January. The PLOvr.B.—There are two species of this bird, the grey and the green, the former feeing larger than the other, and somewhat less than the woodcock. It has generally^ been ■classed with those birds which chielly live in the water; but it would seem only to seek its food there, for many of the species breed u^on the loftiest mountains. Immense flights of these birds are to be seen in the Hebrides, «nd other parts of Scotland; and, in the win- ter, large numbers are sent to the London Biarket, which is sometimes so much glutted with them that they are sold very cheap. Previous to dressing, they are kept till they have a game flavour; and although their Hesh is a favourite with many, it is not uni- the plover. Tersally relished. The green is preferred to I ihe grey, but both are inferior to the woodcock. Their eggs are esteemed as a great delicacy. Birds of this kind are migratory. They arrive ia England in April, live with j lis all the spring and summer, and at the beginning of autumn prepare to take leave by I getting together in flochs. It is supposed that they then retire to Spain, anc^ frequent the sheep-walks with -which that country abounds. TO DBESS THE PTARMIGAN. 1045. Ingredients.—2 or 3 birds; butter, flour, fried bread crumbs. Mode,—The ptarmigan, or white grouse, when young and tender, are exceedingly flne eating, and should be kept as long as possible, to be good. Pluck, draw, and truss them in the same manner as grouse, No. 1025, and roast them before a brisk fire. Tlour and froth I them nicely, and serve on buttered toast, with a tureen of brown I gravy. Bread sauce, when liked, may be sent to table with them, land fried bread crumbs substituted for the toasted bread. 1 Time.—About \ hour. Sufficient,—2 for a dish. I Seasonable from the beginning of February to the end of April, 2 MMODERN nOUSEHOID COOKERY. 530 The Ptarmigan, oe White Ghouse.—TLis bird is nearly the same size as red grouse, and is fond of lofty situations, -where it braves the severest weather, and is found in most parts of Europe, as well as iu Greenland. At Hudson's Bay they appear in such multitudes that so many as sixty or seventy are frequently takeu at once in a net. As they are as tame as chickens, this is done without difficulty. Button says that the Ptarmigan avoids the solar heat, and prefers the frosts of the summits of the mountains; for, as the snow melts on the sides of the mountains, it ascends till it gains the top, where it makes a hole, and burrows in the snow. In winter, it flies in flocks, and feeds on the wild vege- tation of the hills, which imparts to its flesh a bitter, but not altogether an un- palatable taste. It is dark-coloured, and has something of the flavour of the hare, and is greatly relished, and much sought after by some sportsmen. TO DBBS3 QUAILS. 1046. Inghedients.—Quails, butter, toast. Mode.—These birds keep good several days, and should be roasted without drawing. Truss them in the same manner as woodcocks, No. 1062; roast them before a clear fire, keep them well basted, and serve on toast. Time.—About 20 minutes. Average cost.—Seldom bought. Sufficient 2 for a dish. Seasonable from October to December. The Quail.—Quails are almost universally diffused over Europe, Asia, and Africa. Being birds of passage, they are seen in immense flocks, traversing the Mediterranean Sea from Europe to Africa, in the autumn, and returning again in the spring, frequently alighting in their passage on many of the islands of the Archi- pelago, which, with their vast numbers, they almost completely cover. On the western coasts of the kingdom of IS'aples, they have appeared in such prodigious numbers, that, within the compass of four or five miles, as many as a hundred thousand have been taken in a day. " From these circumstances," says a writer on natural history, " it appears highly probable that the quails which supplied the Israelites TEE QUAIL. with food during their journey through the wilderness, were sent thither, on their passage to the north, by a wind from the south-west, sweeping over Egypt and Ethiopia towards the shores of the Pi.ed Sea." In England they are not very numerous, although they breed in it; and many of them are said to remain throughout the year, changing their quarters from the interior parts of the country for the seacoast. TO DUESS SKTIPES. 1047. Ingredients.—Snipes, butter, flour, toast. Mode.—TlnQ^e, like woodcocks, should be dressed without being drawn. Pluck, and wipe them outside, and truss them with the head531 GAME. under the wing, having previously skinned that and the neck. Twist the legs at the first joint, press the feet upon the thighs, and pass a skewer through tliese and the body. Place four on a skewer, tie them on to the jack or spit, and roast before a clear fire for about i hour. Put some pieces of buttered toast into the dripping-pan to catch the trails; flour and froth the birds nicely, dish the pieces of toast with the snipes on them, and pour round, but not over them, a little good brown gravy. They should be sent to table very hot and expeditiously, or they will nbt be worth eating.—See coloured plate Ml. Time.—About \ hour. Average cost, Is. Q>d, to 25. the brace. Sufficient,—4 for a dish. Seasonable from November to February. Note.—Ortolans are trussed and dressed in the same manner. The Si^ips.—This is a migratory bird, and is generally distributed over Europe. It is found in most parts of England, in the high as well as the low lands, depending much on the weather. In very wet seasons it resorts to the hills, but at other times frequents marshes, where it can penetrate the earth with its bill, hunting for worms, which form its principal food. In the Hebrides and the Orkneys snipes are plentiful, and they are fattest in frosty weather. In the breeding season the snipe changes its note entirely from that which it iias in the winter. The male will keep on wing for an hour together, mounting like a lark, and uttering a shrill piping noise; then, w^ith a bleating sound, not unlike that made by an old goat, it will descend with'great velocity, cspe- t^^' sjtipe. cially if the female \m ^MAvag in her nest, from which it will not wander far, HOAST TEAIi. 1048. IK V _,vuiENTS.-~Teal, butter, a little flour Mode.—Choose fat plump birds, after the frost has set in, as they are generally better flavoured ; truss them in the same manner as wild duck. No. 1022; roast them before a brisk fire, and keep them well basted. Serve with brown or orange gravy, water-cresses, and a cut lemon. The remains of teal make excellent hash. Time.—From 9 to 15 minutes. Average cost, \s. each; but seldom bought. Sufficient,—2 for a dish. Seasonable from October to February. HOAST HAUj>7CH OF VENISOK. 1049. Ingredients.—Yenison, coarse flour-and-water paste, a little flour. 2 M 2MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY, 532 3Iode.^ChoosQ a haunch with clear, bright, and thick fat, and the cleft of the hoof smooth and close ; the greater quantity of fat there is, the better quality will the meat be. As many people object to venison when it has too much haut gout^ ascertain how long it has been kept, by running a sharp skewer into the meat close to the bone; when this is withdrawn, its sweetness can be judged of. "With care and attention, it will keep good a fortnight, unless the weather is very mild. Keep it perfectly dry by wiping it with clean cloths till not the least damp remains, and sprinkle over powdered ginger or pepper, as a preventative against the fly. When required for use, wash it in warm water, and dry it ivell with a cloth; butter a sheet of white close fire; baste the venison immediately, to prevent the paper and string from burning, and continue this operation, without intermission,, the whole of the time it is cooking. About 20 minutes before it is done, carefully remove the paste and paper, dredge the joint with flour, and baste well with butter until it is nicely frothed, and of a nice pale- brown colour ; garnish the knuckle-bone with a frill of white paper^ and serve with a good, strong, but unflavoured gravy, in a tureen, and currant jelly; or melt the jelly with a little port wine, and serve that also in a tureen. As the principal object in roasting venison is to preserve the fat, the above is the best mode of doing so where expense is not objected to ; but, in ordinary cases, the paste may be dispensed v/ith, and a double paper placed over the roast instead: it will not require so long cooking without the paste. Do not omit to send very hot plates to table, as the venison fat so soon freezes: to be thoroughly enjoyed by epicures, it should be eaten on hot-water plates. The neck and shoulder may be roasted in the same manner. Time,—A large haunch of buck venison, with the paste, 4 to 5 hours; haunch of doe venison, 3? to 3| hours. Allow less time without the paste. Average cost, Is. id. to Is. 6d. per lb. Sufficient for 18 persons. Seasonable.—Buck venison in greatest perfection from June to Michaelmas; doe venison from November to the end of January. The Deer.—This active tribe of animals principally inhabit wild and woody regionf. In their contentions, both with each other and the rest of tlio brute creation, these paper, put it over the fat, lay a coarse paste, about I inch in thickness, over this, and then a sheet or two of strong paper. ^ Tie the whole firmly on to the BOAST niUNCH OF VENISON. haunch with twine, and put the joint down to a strongGAME. 535 Animals not only use their horus, but strike very furiously with their fore feet. Some of the species are employed as beasts of draught, whilst the flesh of the n hole is wholesome, and that of some of the kinds, under the name of "venison," is considered very delicious. Persons fond of hunting have invented peculiar terms by which the objects of theirpursuit are characterized: thus the stag is called, the first year, a calf, or hind-calf; the second, & knolber ; the thii'd, a brock; the fourth, a stapgard; the fifth, 'a stag; and the sixth, a hart. The female is, the first year, called a caff; the second, a hearse ; and the third, a hind. In Britain, the stag has become scarcer than it formerly was; but, in the High- lands of Scotland, herds of four or five hundred may still be seen, ranging over the vast mountains of the north; and some of the stags of a great size. In former times, the great feudal chieftains used to hunt with all the pomp of eastern sovereigns, assembling some thousands of their clans, who drove the deer into the toils, or to such stations as were occupied by their chiefs. As this sport, however, was occasionally used as a means for collecting their vassals together for the purpose of concocting rebellion, an act was passed prohibitory of such assemblages. In the ** Waverley " of Sir Walter Scott, a deer-hunting scene of this kind is admirably described. Venison.—This is the name given to the flesh of some kinds of deer, and is esteemed as very delicious. Diflerent species of deer are found in wr.rm as well as cold climates, and are in several instances invaluable to man. This is especially the case with the JLaplander, whose reindeer constitutes a large proportion of his wealth. There— *' The reindeer unharness'd in freedom can play. And safely o'er Odin's steep precipice stray, Whilst the wolf to the forest recesses may fly. And howl to the moon as she glides through the sky." In that country it is the substitute for the horse, the cow, the goat, and the sheep. From its milk is produced cheese ; from its skin, clothing; from its tendons, bowstrings iind thread ; from its horns, glue ; from its bones, spoons ; and its flesh furnishes food. In England we have the stag, an animal of great beauty, and much admired. He is a native of many parts of Europe, and is supposed to have been originally introduced into this country from France. About a century back he was to be found wild in some of the rough and mountainous parts of Wales, as well as in the forests of Exmoor, in Devonshire, and the woods on the banks of the Tamar. In the middle ages the deer formed food for the not over abstemious monks, as represented by Friar Tuck's larder, in the admirable fiction of "Ivanhoe;" and at a later pex-iod it was a deer-stealing adventure that drove the " ingenious " William Shakspeare to London, to become a -common player, and the greatest dramatist that ever lived. HASHED VENISOW. 1050. Ingkedients.—The remains of roast venison, its own or mutton gravy, thickening of butter and flour. Mode.—Cut the meat from the bones in neat slices, and, if there is sufficient of its own gravy left, put the meat into this, as it is prefer- able to any other. Should there not be enough, put the bones and .trimmings into a stewpan, with about a pint of mutton gravy; let them stew gently for an hour, and strain the gravy. Put a little £our and butter into the stewpan, keep stirring until brown, then add the strained gravy, and give it a boil up; skim and strain again, and, •when a little cool, put in the slices of venison. Place the stewpan by the side of the fire, and, when on the point of simmering, serve : do not allow it to boil, or the meat will be hard. Send red-currant jelly to table with it.

The Fallow-Deeb.—This is the domestic or park deer; and no two finimals can make a nearer approach to each other than the staj: nnd it, and yet no two animals keep mox'8 distinct, or avoid each other with a mora inveterate animosity. They never beiJ. or intermix together, and consequently r ever give rise to an intermediate race: it is even rare, unless they have been tiansportcd thither, to find fallow-deer ia a FALLOW-DEEK (bUCE:). country where stags are numerous. He is very esaily tamed, and feeds upon many things which the stag refuses: he also browzes closer than the stag, and preserves his venison better. The doe produces one fawn, sometimes two, but rarely three. In short, they resemble the stag in all his natural habits, and the greatest dilTerencd between them is the duration of their lives : the stag, it is said, lives to the age of thirty-five or forty years, and the fallow-deer does not live more than twenty. As they are smaller than the stag, it is probable that their growth is sooner completed. STEWED VENISOJSr. 1051. Ingeedienis.—A shoulder of venison, a few slices of mutton fat, 2 glasses of port wine, pepper and allspice to taste, 1^ pint of weak stock or gravy, J teaspoonful of w^hole pepper, | teaspoonfui of whole allspice. Mode.—Hang the venison till tender; take out the hone, flatten the meat with a rolling-pin, and place over it a few slices of mutton fat, which have been previously soaked for 2 or 3 hours in port wine; sprinkle these with a little fine allspice and pepper, roll the meat up, and bind and tie it securely. Put it into a stewpan with tlic bone and the above proportion of weak stock or gravy, whole allspice, black pepper, and port wine ; cover the lid down closely, and simmer, very gently, from 3 ^- to 4 hours. When quite tender, take off the tape, and dish tiio meat; strain the gravy over it, and send it to table with red-GAMS. ciirrant jelly.

Seasonahle.—Buck venison, from June to Michaelmas; doe venison, from November to the end of January. The Eoebtjck.—This is tlie Cervuscapreolus, or common roe, and is of a reddish-brown colour. It is an inhabitant of Asia, as well as of Europe. It Las great grace in its THE BOEBrCK. movements, and stands about two feet seven inches high, and has a length of about three feet nine. The extent of its horns is from six to eight inches. The Stag.—The stag, or hart, is the male of the red deer, and the hind is the female, lie is much-larger than the fallow-deer, and his age is indicated by his horns, which are round instead of being palmated, like those of the fallov»'-deer. During the first year he has no horns, but a horny excrescence, which is short and rough, and covered with THE ST^G. a thin hairy skin. The next year, the horns are single and straight; and in the third they have two antlers, three the fourth, four the fifth, and five the sixth year; although this number is not always certain, for sometimes they are more, and often i less. After the sixth year, the antlers do not always increase; .and, although inMODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. 536 number they may amount to six or seven on each side, yet the animal's age is then estimated rather by the size of the antlers and the thickness of the branch which sus- tains them, than by their variety. Large as these horns seem, however, they are shed every year, and their phice supplied by new ones. This usually takes place in the spring. When the old horns have fallen olf, the new ones do not make their appearance immedi- ately ; but the bones of the skull are seen covered with a transparent periosteum, or skin, •which enwraps the bones of all animals. After a short time, however, the skin begins to swell, and to form a sort of tumour. From this, by-and-by, rising from the head, shoot forth the antlers from each side ; and, in a short time, in proportion as the animal is in condition, the entire horns are completed. The solidity of the extremities, however, is not 5)erfect until the horns have arrived at their full growth. Old stags usually shed their lorns first, which generally happens towards the latter end of February or the beginning of March. Such as are between five and six years old shed them about the middle ok latter end of March ; those still younger in the month of April; and the youngest of all not till the middle or latter end of May. These rules, though generally true, are subject to variations ; for a severe winter will retard the shedding of the horns.—The Hijfi) haa no horns, and is less fitted for being hunted than the male. She takes the greatest caro- of her 3'ouug, and secretes them in the most obscure thickets, lest they become a prey to their numerous enemies. All the rapacious family of the cat kind, with the wolf, the dog, the eagle, and the falcon, are continually endeavouring to find her retreat, whilst the stag himself is the foe of his own oftspring. When she has young, therefore, it would seem that the courage of the male is transferred to the female, for she defends them with the most resolute bravery. If pursued by the hunter, she will fly before the- hounds for half the day, and then return to her young, whose life she has thus preserved at the hazard of her own. The New Venisox.—The deer population of our splendid English parks was, until a few years since, limited to two species, the fallow and the red. But as the fallow-deer itself was an acclimated animal, of comparatively recent introduction, it came to be a question why might not the proprietor of any deer-park in England have the luxury of at least half a dozen species of deer and antelopes, to,adorn the hills, dales, ferny brakes, and rich pastures of his domain ? The temperate regions of the whole world might h& made to yield specimens of the noble ruminant, valuable either for their individual beauty, or for their availability to gastronomic purposes. During the last four or five years a few spirited English noblemen have made the experiment of breeding foreign deer in their parks, and have obtained such a decideck ISLAND (bull). XLAND (COW). fiuccess, that it may be hoped their example w-iil induce others to follow in a course which will eventually give to England's rural scenery a new element of beauty, and to English tables a fresh viand of the choicest character. A practical solution of this interesting question was made by Viscount Hill, at Hawke- stone Park, Salop, in January, 1859. On that occasion a magnificent eland, an acclimated scion of the species whose native home is the South African wilderness, was killed for the table. The noble beast was thus described ;—He weighed 1,176 lbs. as he dropped ; huge as a short-horn, but with bone not half the size ; active as a deer, stately in all nis paces, perfect in form, bright in colour, with a vast dewlap, and strong sculptured horn. This eland in his lifetime strode majestic on the hill-side, where he dwelt with his mates and their progeny, all English-born, like himself." Three pairs of the same species of deer were left to roam at large on the picturesque slopes throughout the day.MODERN MODE OF SERVING DISHES.GAME. 537 and to return to their home at pleasure. *' Here, during winter, they arc assisted with roots and hay, but in summer they have nolhinp; but the pasture of tlie park; so that, in point of expense, they cost no more than cattle of the best description." Travellers and sportsmen say that the male eland is unapproached in the quality of his flesh by any ruminant in South Africa ; that it grows to an enormous size, and lays on fat with as prcat facility as a true short-horn ; while in texture and flavour it is inflnitely superior. The lean is remarkably fine, the fat firm and delicate. It was tried in every fashion,— braised brisket, roasted ribs, broiled steaks, filet saute, boiled aitchbone, &c.,—and in all, gave evidence of the fact, that a new meat of surpassing value had been added to the products of the English park. When we hear such a gratifying account of the eland, it is pleasing to record that lord Hastings has a herd of the Canadian wapiti, a herd of Indian nylghaus, and another of the small Indian hog-deer; that the Earl of Ducie has been successful in breeding the magnificent Persian deer. The eland was first acclimated in England by the lato Earl of Derby, between the years 1835—1851, at his menagerie at Knowsley. On his death, in 1851, he bequeathed to the Zoological Society his breed of elands, consisting oi two males and three females. Here the animals have been treated with the greatest success, and from the year 1853 to the present time, the females have regularly repro- duced, without the loss of a single calf.

The Woodcock—This bird being migratorj-in its habits, has, consequently, no settled habitation; it cannot be consideied as the property of any one, and is, therefore, not game by law. It breeds in high northern lati- tudes, and the time of its appe ranee and dis- appearance in Sweden coincid-s exactly with that of its arrival in and return from Great Britain. On the coast of Suffolk its vernal and autumnal visits have been accurately observed. In the first week of October it makes its appear- ance in small numbers, but in November and December it appears in larger numbers, and always after sunset, and most gregai'iously. In the same manner as woodcocks take their leave of us, they quit France, Germany, and Italy, making the northern and colder climates their summer rendezvous. They visit Burgundy in the latter part of October, but continue there only a few weeks, the country being hard, and unable to supply them with such sustenance as they require. In the vdnter, they are found as far south as Smyrna and Aleppo, and, during the same season, in Barbary, wliere the Africans name them " the ass of the partridge." It has been asserted that thoy have been seen as far south as Egypt, which is the most remote region to which they can be traced on that side of the eastern world ; on the other side, they are common in Japan. Those which resort to the countries of the Levant are supposed to come from the moun- tains of Armenia, or the deserts of Tartary or Siberia. The flesh of the woodcock is held in high estimation ; hence the bii'd is eagerly sought after by the sportsman. THE woodcock:. GAME CAEVING. blackcoce:. 1054. Skilful carving of game undoubtedly adds to the pleasure of the guests at a dinner-table; for game seems pre-eminently to be composed of such delicate limbs and tender flesh that an inapt prac- titioner appears to more disadvantage when mauling these pretty and favourite dishes, than larger and more robust pieces de resistance. As described at recipe ISTo, 1019, this bird is variously served with or without the head on ; and although we do not personally object to the appearance of the head as shown in the woodcut, yet it seems to be more in vogue to serve it without. The carving is not difficult, but should be elegantly and deftly done. Slices from the breast, cut in the direction of the dotted line from 2 to 1, should be taken off, the merrythought dis- placed, and the leg and wing removed by running the knife along from 3 to 4, and following the directions given under the head of boiledGAME. fowl, N'o. 1000, reserving the thigh, which is considered a great deli- cacy, for the most honoured guests, some of whom may also esteem the brains of this bird. WILD DUCK. 1055. As game is almost universally served as a dainty, and not as a dish to stand the assaults of an altogether fresh appetite, these dishes are not usually cut up entirely, but only those parts are served of each, which are considered the best-flavoured and the primest. Of wild-fowl, the breast alone is considered by epicures worth eat- ing, and slices are cut from this, in the direction indicated by thelines, from 1 to 2 ; if necessary, the leg and wing can be taken ofF by passing the knife from 3 to 4, and by generally following the directions described for carving boiled fowl, No. 1000. BOAST HABB. 1056. The " Grand Carver " of olden times, a functionary of no ordi- nary dignity, was pleased when he had a hare to manipulate, for his skill and grace had an opportunity of dis- play. Diners d la Riisse may possibly, ere while, save modern gentlemen the neces- sity of learning the art which was in auld lang syne one of the necessary accomplish- ments of the youthful squire; but, until side-tables become universal, or till we see the oflice of ** grand carver " once more instituted, it will be well for all to learn how to assist at the carving of this dish, which, if not the most elegant in appearance, is a very general favourite. The hare, having its head to the left, as shown in the woodcut, should be first served by cutting slices from each side of the backbone, in the direction of the lines from 3 to 4. After these prime parts are disposed of, the leg should next be dis- engaged by cutting round the line indicated by the figures 5 to 6. The shoulders will then be taken 0^ by passing the knife round from 7 to 8. The back of the hare should now be divided by cutting quite through its spine, as shown by the line 1 to 2, taking care to feel with the point of the knife for a joint w^here the back may bo readily penetrated. It is the usual plan not to serve any bone in helping hare ; and thus the flesh should be sliced from the legs and placed alone on the plate. In large establishments, and where men-cooks are kept, it is often the case that the backbone of the hare, especiallyMODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. 5i0 in. old animals, is taken out, and tlien the process of carving is, of course, considerably facilitated. A great point to be remembered in connection with carving hare is, that plenty of gravy should accompany each helping; otherwise this dish, which is naturally dry, will lose half its flavour, and so become a failure. Stuffing is also served with it; and the ears, which should be nicely crisp, and the brains of the hare, are esteemed as delicacies by many connoisseurs. PARTRIDGES. 1057. There are several ways of carving this most familiar game bird. The more usual and summary mode is to carry the knife sharply along the top of the breastbone of the bird, and cut it quite through, thus di- viding it into two precisely equal and similar parts, in the same manner as carving a pigeon, No. 1003. Another plan is to cut it into three pieces; viz., by severing a small wing and leg on either side from the body, by following the line 1 to 2 in the upper woodcut; thus making 2 helpings, when the breast will re- main for a third plate. The most elegant manner is that of thrusting back the body from the legs, and then cutting through the breast in the direction shown by the line 1 to 2 : this plan will give 4 or more small helpings. A little bread-sauce should be served to each guest. GROUSE. 1058. GPtOusE may be carved in the way first described in carving partridge. The backbone of the grouse is highly esteemed by many, and this part of many game birds is considered the finest flavoured. PHEASANT. 1059. Fixing the fork in the breast, let the carver cut slices from it in the direction of the lines from 2 to 1: these are the prime pieces. If there be more guests to satisfy than these slices will serve, then let the legs and wings be disengaged in the same manner as described in carving boiled fowl, No. 1000, the point where the wing joins the neckbone being carefully found. The merrythought will come off in the same way as that of BOAST PHUASANT.GAME. 641 a fowl. The most valued parts are the same as those which are most considered in a fowl. SNIPE. 1060. One of these small hut delicious hirds may he j^iven, whole, to a p:entleman; hut, in helping a lady, it will he hetter to cut them quite through the centre, from 1 to 2, completely dividing them into equal and like portions, and put only one half on the plate. HAUNCH OF VENISON. 1061. Here is a grand dish for a knight of the carving-knife to exercise his skill upon, and, what will be pleasant for many to know, there is hut little difficulty in the 1 performance.

Although some epicures affect to believe that some parts of the haunch are superior to others, yet we doubt if there is any difference between the slices cut above and below the line. It should be borne in mind to serve each guest with a portion of fat; and the most expeditious carver will be the best carver, as, like mutton, venison soon begins to chill, when it loses much of its charm. WOODCOCK. 1062. This bird, like a partridge, may be carved by cutting it exactly into two like portions, or made into three helpings, as de- scribed in carving partridge (No. 1C57). The backbone is considered the tit-bit of a woodcock, and by many the thigh is also thought a great delicacy. This bird is served in the manner advised by Brillat Savarin, in connection with the pheasant, viz., on toast which has received its drippings whilst roasting; and apiece of this toast should inva- riably accompany each plate.

" Strange there should be found Who, self-imprisoa'd in their proud saloons, Renounce the odours of the open field Tor the unscented fictions of the loom ; Vv'ho, satisfied with only pencilled seeucs. Prefer to the performance of a God, Th' inferior wonders of an artist's hand ! Lovely, indeed, the mimic works of art. But Nature's works far lovelier."—CowrEii. 1069. ''The Animal and Vegetable Kingdo.ms/' says Hogg, in his Natural History of the Vegetable Kingdom, ''may be aptly compared to the primary colours of the prismatic spectrum, which arc so gradually and intimately blended, that we fail to discover where the one terminates and where the other begins. If we had to deal with yellow and blue only, the eyo would easily distinguish the one from the other; but when the two are blended, and form green, we cannot tell where the blue ends and the yellow begins. And so it is in the animal and vegetable kingdoms. If our powers of observation wore limited to the highest orders of animals and plants, if there v/ere only mammals, birds, reptiles, fishes, and insects in the one, and trees, shrubs, and herbs in the other, we should then be able v/ith facility to define the bounds of the two kingdoms ; but as we descend the scale of each, and arrive at the lowest forms of animals and plants, we tliere meet with bodies of the simplest structure, sometimes a mere cell, whose organization, modes of development and reproduction, are so anomalous, and partake so much ofMODEUN HOUSEnOLD COOKERY. 514 the character of both, that we cannot disthig-uish whelhor they are plants or whether they are animals." 1070. Whilst it is thus difficult to determine where the animal begins and the vegetable ends, it is as difficult to account for many of the sin- gularities by which numbers of plants are characterized. This, however, can hardly be regarded as a matter of surprise, when we recollect that, so f;\r as it is at present known, the vegetable kingdom is composed of upwards of 92,000 species of plants. Of this amazing number the lichens and the mosses are of the simplest and hardiest kinds. These, indeed, may be considered as the very creators of the soil: they thrive in the coldest and most sterile regions, many ot them commencing the operations of nature in the growth of vegetables on the barest rocks, and receiving no other nourishment than such as may be supplied to them by the simple elements of air and rain. When they have exhausted their period in such situations as have been assigned them, they pass into a state of decay, and become changed into a very fine mould, which, in the active spontaneity of nature, immediately begins to produce other species, which in their turn become food for various mosses, and also rot. This process of growth and deca}'', being, from time to time, continued, by-and-by forms a soil sufficient for the maintenance of larger plants, which also die and decay, and so increase the soil, until it becomes deep enough to sustain an oak, or even the weight of a tropical forest. To create soil amongst rocks, however, must not bo considered as the only end of the lichen ; different kinds of it minister to the elegant arts, in the form of beautiful dyes ; thus the lichen vocella Is used to communicate to silk and wool, various shades of purple and crimson, which greatly enhance the value of these materials. This species is chiefly imported from the Canary Islands, and, when scarce, as an article of commerce has brought as much as £1,000 per ton. 1071. In the vicinity of Lichens, the Musci, or Mosses, are generally to be found. Indeed, wherever vegetation can be sustained, there they are, affording protection to the roots and seeds of more delicate vegetables, and, by their spongy texture, retaining a moisture which preserves other plants from the withering drought of summer. But even in winter we find them enlivening, by their verdure, the cold bosom of Nature. We see them abound- ing in our pastures and our woods, attaching themselves to the living, and still more abundantly to the dead, trunks and branches of trees. In marshy places they also abound, and become the medium of their conversion into fruitful fields. This is exemplified by the manner in which peat-mosses are formed : on the surface of these we find them in a state of great life and vigour; immediately below we discover them, more or less, in a state of decomposition; and, still deeper, we find their stems and branches consolidated into a light brown peat. Thus are extensive tracts formed, ultimately to be brought into a state of cultivation, and rendered subservient to the wants of man. 1072. When Nature has found a soil, her next care is to perfect the5i5 VEGETABLES, growth of her seeds, and then to disperse them. Whilst the seed remains confined in its capsule, it cannot answer its purpose ; hence, when it is suQi- ciently ripe, the pericardium opens, and lets it out. What must strike every observer with surprise is, how nuts and shells, which we can hardly crack with our teeth, or even with a hammer, will divide of themselves, and make way for the little tender sprout which proceeds from the kernel. There are instances, it is said, such as in the Touch-me-not {imioaiiens), and the Cuckoo- flower {cardamine), in which the seed-vessels, by an elastic jerk at the moment of their explosion, cast the seeds to a distance. We are all aware, however, that many seeds—those of the most composite flowers, as of the thistle, and <]andelion—are endowed with, what have not been inappropriately called, wings. These consist of a beautiful silk-looking down, by which they are enabled to float in the air, and to be transported, sometimes, to considerable distances from the parent plant that produced them. The swelling of this clovrny tuft v/ithin the seed-vessel is the means by which the seed is enabled to overcome the resistance of its coats, and to force for itself a passage by which it escapes from its little prison-house. 1073. Birds, as well as Quadrupeds, are likewise the means of dispersing the seeds of plants, and placing them in situations where they ultimately grovr. Amongst the latter is the squirrel, which is an extensive planter of oaks ; na}^ it may be regarded as having, in some measure, been one of the creators of the British navy. We have read of a gentleman who was walking one day in some woods belonging to the Duke of Beaufort, near Troy House, in Mon- mouthshire, when his attention v/as arrested by a squirrel, sitting very com- posedly upon the ground. He stopped to observe its motions, when, in a short time, the little animal suddenly quitted its position, and darted to the top of the tree beneath which it had been sitting. In an instant it returned with an acorn in its mouth, and with its paws began to burrow in the earth. After digging a small hole, it therein deposited an acorn, which it hastily covered, and then darted up the tree again. In a moment it was down v>^ith another, v.hich it buried in the same manner; and so continued its labour, gathering and burying, as long as the gentleman had patience to watch it. This industry in the squirrel is an instinct which directs it to lay up a store of provision for the winter; and as it is probable that its memory is not suffi- ciently retentive to enable it to recollect all the spots in which it deposits its acorns, it no doubt makes some slips in the course of the season, and loses some of them. These few spring up, and are, in time, destined to supply the place of the parent tree. Thus may the soifs of Britain, in some degree, consider themselves to be indebted to the industry and defective memory of this little animal for the production of some of those ''wooden walls " which have, for centuries, been the national pride, and which have so long braved the battle and the breeze " on the broad bosom of the great deep, in every quarter of the civilized globe. As with the squirrel, so with jays and pies, which plant among the grass and moss, horse-beans, and probably forget where they have secreted them. Mr. White, the naturalist, says, that both 2nMODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. 516 horse-beans and peas sprang up in his field-walks in the autumn ; and he attri- butes the sowing of them to birds. Bees, he also observes, are much the best setters of cucumbers. If they do not happen to take kindly to the frames, the best way is to tempt them by a little honey put on the male and female bloom. When they are once induced to haunt the frames, they set all the fruit, and will hover with impatience round the lights in a morning till the glasses are opened. 1074. Some of tith Acorns planted by the Squirrel of Monmouth- shire may be nov/ in a fair way to become, at the end of some centuries, venerable trees ; for not the least remarkable quality of oaks is the strong principle of life with which they are endued. In Major Kooke's ^' Sketch of the Forest of Sherwood " we find it stated that, on some timber cut down in Berkland and Bilhaugh, letters were found stamped in the bodies of the trees, denoting the king's reign in which they v/ere marked. The bark appears to have been cut off, and then the letters to have been cut in, and the next year's wood to have grown over them without adhering to where the bark had been cut out. The ciphers were found to be of James I., William and Mary, and one of King John. One of tlie ciphers of James was about one foot within the tree, and one foot from the centre. It was cut down in 1786. The tree must have been two feet in diameter, or two yards in circumference, when the mark was cut. A tree of this size is generally estimated at 120 years' growth; which number being subtracted from the middle year of the reign of Jam.es, would- carry the year back to 1492, which would be about the period of its being planted. The tree with the cipher of William and Mary displayed its mark about nine inches Vvithin the tree, and three feet three inches from the centre. This tree was felled in 1786. The cipher of John was eighteen inches within the tree, and rather more than a foot from the centre. The middle year of' the reign of that monarch was 1207. By subtracting from this 120, the number of years requisite for a tree's growth to arrive at the diameter of two feet, the date of its being planted would seem to have been 1085, or about twenty years after the Conquest. 1075. Considering the great Endurance of these Trees, we are nece-ssarily led to inquire into the means by which they are enabled to arrive at such strength and maturity; and whether it may be considered as a humiliation we will not determine, but, with all the ingenious mechanical contrivances of man, we are still unable to define the limits of the animal and vegetable kingdoms. Plants have been described by naturalists, who would determine the limits of the two kingdoms, as organized living bodies, without volition or locomotion, destitute of a mouth or intestinal cavity, which, when detached from their place of growth, die, and, in decaj^, ferment, but do not putrefy, and which, on being subjected to analysis, furnish an excess of carbon and no nitrogen. The powers of chemistry, and of the microscope, however, instead of confirming these views, tend more and more to show that a still closer affinity exists between plants and animals; for it is now ascertained517 VEGETABLES. that nitrogen, which was believed to bo present only in animals, enters largely into the composition of plants also. When the microscope is brought to aid our powers of observation, we find that there are organized bodies belonging to the vegetable kingdom which possess very evident powers of locomotion, and which change about in so very remarkable a manner, that no other causa than that of volition can be assigned to it." Thus it would seem that, in this particular at least, some vegetables bear a very close resemblance to animal life; and when we consider the manner in which they are supplied with nourish- ment, and perform the functions of their existence, the resemblance would seem still closer. If, for example, we take a thin transverse slice of the stem of any plant, or a slice cut across its stem, and immerse it in a little puro water, and place it under a microscope, we will find that it consists princi- pally of cells, more or less regular, and resembling those of a honeycomb CP.LLULAR DEVELOPMENT. or a network of cobweb. The size of these varies in different plants, as it does in different parts of the same plant, and they are sometimes so minute as to require a million to cover a square inch of surface. This singular struc- ture, besides containing water and air, is the repository or storehouse of various secretions. Through it, the sap, when produced, is diffused sideways through the plant, and by it numerous clianges are effected in the juices which fill its cells. The forms of the cells are various ; they are also subject to various transformations. Sometimes a number of cylindrical cells are laid end to end, and, by the absorption of the transvei'se partitions, form a continuous tube, as in the sap-vessels of plants, or in muscular and nervous fibre ; and when cells are thus woven together, they are called cellular tissue, which, in the hum.an body, forms a fine net-like membrane, envelo2:)ing or connecting most of its structures. In pulpy fruits, the cells may be easily separated one from the other; and within the cells are smaller cells, commonly known as pulp. Among the cell-contents of some plants are beautiful crystals, called raphidcs. The terra is derived from pa^tQ, a needle, on account of the resemblance of I the crystrd to a needle. They are composed of the phosphatQ and oxalate of 1 2 N 2548 MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. lime; but there is great difference of opinion as to the^'r usre m the economy t-f the plant, and one of the French philosophers endeavoured to prove that crys- siLicrors cniCLE from under-side of leaf of deutzia scabea. tals are the possible transition of the inorganic to organic matter. The differ- ences, however, between the highest form of crystal and the lowest form of SILICEOUS CUTICLE OF GRASS. organic life known, viz., a simple reproductive cell, are so manifold and striking, that the attempt to make crystals the bridge over which inorganic519 VEGETABLES. matter passes into organic, is almost totally regarded as futile. In a layer of an onion, a fig, a section of garden rhubarb, in some species of aloe, in tho bark of many trees, and in portions of tho cuticle of the medicinal squill, bun- dles of these needle-shaped crystals are to be found. Some of them are as large as l-40th of an inch, others are as small as the 1-lOOOth. They are found in all parts of the plant,—in tho stem, bark, leaves, stipules, petals, fruit, i-oots, and even in the pollen, with some few exceptions, and they are always situated in the interior of cells. Some plants, as many of the cactus tribe, are made up almost entirely of these needle-crystals; in some instances, every cell of the cuticle contains a stellate mass of crystals ; in others, the whole interior is full of them, rendering the plant so exceedingly brittle, that the least touch will occasion a fracture ; so much so, that some specimens of Caches seniiis, said to be a thousand years old, which were sent a few years since to Kew, from South America, were obliged to be packed in cotton, with all the care of the most delicate jewellery, to preserve them during transport. 1076. Besides the Cellular Tissue, there is what is called a vascular sj'stem, which consists of another set of small vessels. If, for example, we, early in the spring, cut a branch transversely, we will perceive the sap oozing out from numerous points over the whole of the divided surface, except on that part occupied by the pith and tho bark; and if a twig, on which the leaves are already unfolded, be cut from the tree, and placed with its cut end in a watery solution of Brazil-wood, the colouring matter will be found to ascend into the leaves and to the top of the twig. In both these cases, a close examination with a powerful microscope, will discover the sap perspiring from the divided portion of the stem, and the colouring matter rising through real tubes to the top of the twig ; these are the sap or conducting vessels of the plant. If, however, we examine a transverse section of the vine, or of any other tree, at a later period of the season, we find that the wood is apparently dry, whilst tho bark, particularly that part next the wood, is swelled with Hmd. This is contained in vessels of a different kind from those in which the sap rises. They are found in the hark only in trees, and may be called re- turning vessels, from their carrying the sap downwards after its preparation in the leaf. It is believed that the passage of the sap in plants is conducted in a manner jDrecisely similar to that of the blood in man, from the regular contraction and expansion of the vessels; but, on account of their extreme minuteness, it is almost an impossibility to be certain upon this point. Nume- rous observations made with the microscope show that their diameter seldom exceeds a 290th part of a hne, or a 3,000th part of an inch. Leuwenhoeck ixjckoned 20,000 vessels in a morsel of oak about one nineteenth of an inch square. 1077. In the Vascular System of a Plant, we at once see tho great analogy which it bears to the veins and arteries in the human system ; but neither it, nor the cellular tissue combined, is all that is required to perfccb the production of a vegetable. There is, besides, a tracheal system, which550 MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. is composed of vciy minute elastic spiral tubes, designed for the purpose of conveying air both to and from the plant. There are also fibres, which consist of collections of these cells and vessels closely united together. These form the root and the stem. If we attempt to cut them transversely, we meet with difficulty, because we have to force our way across the tubes, and break them ; but if we slit the wood lengthwise, the vessels are separated without breaking. The layers of wood, which appear in the stem or branch of a tree cut transversely, consist of different zones of fibres, each the produce of one 3'ear's growth, and separated by a coat of cellular tissue, without which they could not be well distinguished. Besides all these, there is the cuticle, which extends over every part of the plant, and covers the bark with three distinct coats. The liber, or inner bark, is said to be formed of hollow tubes, which convey the sap downwards to increase the solid diameter of the tree. 1078. The Root A^-D the Stem kow demand a slight kotice. The former is designed, not only to support the plant by fixing it in the soil, but also to fulfil the functions of a channel for the conveyance of nourishment: it is therefore furnished with pores, or spongioles, as they are called, from their resemblance to a sponge, to suck up whatever comes within its reach. It is found in a variety of forms, and hence its adaptation to a great diversity of soils and circumstances. We have heard of a willow-tree being dug up and its head planted where its roots were, and these sufi'ered to spread out in the air like naked branches. In course of time, the roots became branches, and the branches roots, or rather, roots rose from the branches beneath the ground, and branches shot from the roots above. Some roots last one j^ear, others two, and others, like the shrubs and trees which they produce, have an indefinite period of existence ; but they all consist of a collection of fibres, composed of vascular and cellular tissue, without tracheae, or breathing-vessels. The stem is the grand distributor of the nourishment taken up by the roots, to the several parts of the plant. The seat of its vitality is said to be in the point or spot called the neck, which separates the stem from the root. If the root of a young plant bo cut off, it will shoot out afresh ; if even the stem be taken away, it will be renewed; but if this part be injured, the plant will assuredly die. 1079. In accordance with the plan of this Work, special notices of culinary vegetables will accompany the various recipes in which they are spoken of; but here we cannot resist the opportunity of declaring it as our conviction, that he or she who introduces a useful or an ornamental plant into our island, ought justly to be considered, to a large extent, a benefactor to the country. No one can calculate the benefits which may spring from this very ^•egctable, after its qualities have become thoroughly known. If viewed in no other light, it is pleasing to consider it as bestowing upon us a share of the blessings of other climates, and cnabhng us to participate in the luxury which a m^ore genial sun has produced.batter,—' J lb. of flour, a little salt, the yolk of I egg, milk. RECIPES. CHAPTER XXV. BOILED AKTICHOKES. 1080. Ingredients.—To each i gallon of water, allow 1 heaped tablespoonful of salt, a piece of soda the size of a shilling ; artichoke?. Mode.—Wash the artichokes well in several waters ; see that no insects remain about them, and trim away the leaves at the bottom. Cut off the stems and put them into hoiling water, to which have been added salt and soda in the above proportion. Keep the saucepan uncovered, and let them boil quickly until tender; ascertain when they are done by thrusting a fork in them, or by trying if the leaves can be easily removed. Take them out, let them drain for a minute or two^ aetichokes. and serve in a napkin, or with a little white sauce poured over. A tureen of melted butter should accom- pany them. This vegetable, unlike any other, is considered better for being gathered two or three days ; but they must be well soaked and washed previous to dressing. Time.—20 to 25 minutes, after the water boils. Sufficient^—a dish of 5 or 6 for 4 persons. Seasonable from July to the beginning of Sep- tember. The CoirposiTJS, ob Composite Flowers.—This family is so extensive, as to contain nearly a twelfth part of the wholo of the vegetable kingdom. It embraces about 9,000 speciess, distributed over almost every country; and new discoveries are constantly being made and added to the number. Towards ths poles their numbers diminish, and slightly, also, towards the equator; but they abound in the tropical and sub-tropical islai:d3, and in the tracts of continent not far from the sea- shore. Among esculent vegetables, the Lettuce, Salsify, Scor- zonera, Cardoon, and Artichoke belong to the family. FMED ABTICHOKES. (Entremets, or Small Dish to be served with, the Second Course.} 1081.

Constituent Properties of the Artichoke.—According to the analj^sis of Bra- connet, the constituent elements of an artichoke are,—starch 30, albumen 10, uncrjstal- lizable sugar 148, gum 12, fixed oil 1, v/oody fibre 12, inorganic matter 27, and water 770.55B VEGETABLES. and boil them in salt and water until tender. Have ready i pint of BOILED JEHUSALEM ARTICHOKES. 1084. Ingeedients.—To each § gallon of water allow 1 heaped tablespoonful of salt; artichokes. Wash, peel, and shape the artichokes in a round or oval form, and put them into a saucepan with sufficient cold water to cover them, salted in the above proportion. Let them boil gently ^hxichokes. until tender; take them up, drain them, and serve them in a napkin, or plain, whichever mode is preferred ; send to table with them a tureen of melted butter or cream sauce, a little of which may be poured over the artichokes when they are not served in a napkin. Time.—About 20 minutes after the water boils. A verage costy 2d. per lb. Sufficienty—\Q for a dish for 6 persons. Seasonable from September to June. Uses of the Jerusalem Aktichoke.—This being a tuberous-rooted plant, with leafy stems from lour to six feet bigli, it is alleged that its tops will atfbrd as mucli fodder per acre as a crop of oats, or more, and its roots half as mnny tubers as an ordinary crop of potatoes. The tubers, being abundant in the market-gardens, are to be had at little more than the price of potatoes. The fibres of tlie stems may be separated by maceration, and manufactured into cordage or cloth; and this is said to be done in some parts of the north and ^Yest of France, as about Hagenau, where this plant, on the poor Euudy soils, is an object of field culture. MASHED JERUSALEM ARTICHOKES. 1085. Ingeedients.—To each \ gallon of water allow 1 oz. of salt; 15 or 16 artichokes, 1 oz. butter, pepper and salt to taste. 3Iode.—Boil the artichokes as in the preceding recipe until tender; drain and press the water from them, and beat them up with a fork. When thoroughly mashed and free from lumps, put them into a saucepan with the butter and a seasoning of tvJiite pepper and salt; keep stirring over the lire until the artichokes are quite hot, and serve.

Mode.—Peel and cut the artichokes in the shape of a pear; cut a piece oftHhe bottom of each, that they may stand upright in the dish,MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. 551 white sauce, made by recipe 'No. 538 ; disli the artichokes, pour over them the sauce, and place between each a fine Brussels sprout: these should be boiled separately, and not with the artichokes. 2i7ne.—About 20 minutes. Average cost^ 2d. per lb. Sufficient for 6 or 7 persons. Seasonable from September to June. The Jerusalem Aktichoee.—This plant is well known, being, for its tubers cultivated not only as a garden vegetable, but also as an agricultural crop. By many it is much esteemed as an esculent, when cooked in various ways; and the domesticated animals eat both the fresh fohage and the tubers with great rehsh. By some, they are not r^nlvr considered nourishing, but even fattening, ^ BOIIjED aspakagus. 1087. Ingeedients—To each i gallon of water allow 1 heaped tablespoonful of salt; asparagus. Iflode—Aspaiagus should be dressed as soon as possible after it is cut, although it may be kept for a day or two by putting the stalks into cold water ; yet, to be good, like every other vegetable, it cannot be cooked too fresh. Scrape the white part of the stems, hegiiining from the head, and throw them into cold water; then tie them into ASPARAGUS Oir TOAST. ASPARAGUS TONGS. bundles of about 20 each, keeping the heads all one woj', and cut the stalks evenly, that they may all be the same length ; put them into boiling water, with salt in the above proportion ; keep them boiling quickly until tender, with the saucepan uncovered. When the aspa- ragus is done, dish it upon toast, which bhould be dipped in the water it was cooked in, and leave the white ends outwards each way, with the points meetirg in the middle. Serve v/ith a tureen of melted butter. Ti/ne.—15 to 18 minutes after the water boils. Average cost, in full season, 25. 6d. the 100 heads. Sufficient,—KWow about 50 heads for 4 or 5 persons. Seasonable.—May be had, forced, from January but cheapest in May, June, and July. Asparagus.—This plant belongs to the variously-featured family of the order LilincecB, which, in the temperate regions of both hemispheres, are most abundant, and, between the tropica, gigantic in size and arborescent in form. Asparagus is a native of Great Britain, and is found on various parts of the seacoast, and in the fens of Lincolnshire. At Kynarve Cove, in Cornwall, there is an island called " Asparagus Island," from the abun- dance in which it is there found. The uses to which the young shoots are applied, and the manure in which they are cultivated in order to bring them to the highest stnte of excellence, hava ASPAEAGUS. been a study with many kitchen-gardeners.655 VEGETABLES. ASPARAGUS PEAS. (Entremets, or to be served as a Side-dish, with the Second Course.) 1088. iNGiiEDiENTS.—100 heads of asparagus, 2 oz. of butter, a small bunch of parsley, 2 or 3 green onions, flour, 1 lump of sugar, the yolks of 2 eggs, 4 tablespoonfuls of cream, salt. Jfot/e.—Carefully scrape the asparagus, cut it into pieces of an equal size, avoiding that which is iu the least hard or tough, and throw them into cold water. Then boil the asparagus in salt and water until three-parts done ; take it out, drain, and place it on a cloth to dry the moisture away from it. Put it into a stewpan with the butter, parsley, and onions, and. shake over a brisk fire for 10 minutes. Dredge in a little flour, add the sugar, and moisten with boiling water. When boiled a short time and reduced, take out the parsley and onions, thicken with the yolks of 2 eggs beaten with the cream ; add a seasoning of salt, and, w^hen the whole is on the point of simmering, serve. Make the sauce sufficiently thick to adhere to the vegetable. J'/me.—Altogether, J hour. Average cost^ Is. Qd. a pint. Seasonable in May, June, and July. MEDiciNiiL Uses or Asparagus.—This plant not only acts as a wLolesome and nutritious vegetable, but also as a diuretic, aperient, and deobstruent. The chemical analysis of its juice discovers its composition to be a peculiar crystallizable principle, called asparagin, albumen, mannite, malic acid, and some salts. Thours says, the cellular tissue contains a substance similar to sago. The berries are capable of under- going vinous fermentation, and affording alcohol by distillation. In their unripe state • they possess the same properties as the roots, and probably in a much higher degree. ASPAKAGUS PUDDING. (A delicious Dish, to be served with the Second Course.) 1089. IxGREDiENTS.—I pint of asparagus peas, 4 eggs, 2 table- spoonfuls of flour, 1 tablespoonful of ver?/ finely minced ham, 1 oz. of butter, pepper and salt to taste, milk. Mode,—Cut up the nice green tender parts of asparagus, about the size of peas; put them into a basin with the eggs, which should be well beaten, and the flour, ham, butter, pepper, and salt. Mix all these ingredients well together, and moisten with sufficient milk to make the pudding of the consistency of thick batter; put it into a pint buttered mould, tie it down tightly with a floured cloth, place it in hoiling watery and let it boil for 2 hours; turn it out of the mould on to a hot dish, and pour plain melted butter rounds but not over, the pudding. Green peas pudding may be made in exactly the same manner, substituting peas for the asparagus. Time.—2 hours. Average cost, Is. 6d. per pint. Seasonahle in May, June, and July.MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. BOILED PKENCH BEANS. 1090. Ikgrediej^ts.—To each i gallon of water allow 1 heaped tablespoonfiil of salt, a vertj small piece of soda. 3/o{7e.—This vegetable should always be eaten young, as, when allowed to grow too long, it tastes stringy and tough when cooked. Cut olF the heads and tails, and a thin strip on each side of the beans, to remove the strings. Then divide each bean into 4 or 6 pieces, ac- cording to size, cutting them lengthways in a slanting direction, and, as they are cut, put them into cold water, with a small quantity of salt dissolved in it. Have ready a saucepan of boiling water, with salt and soda in the above proportion; put in the beans, keep them boiling quickly, with the lid uncovered, and be careful that they do not get smoked. When tender, scAKLET EUNNER. whlch may be ascertained by their sinking to the bottom of the saucepan, take them up, throw them into a colander; and when drained, dish and serve with plain melted butter. When very young, beans are sometimes served whole; when they are thus dressed, their colour and flavour are much better preserved ; but the more general way of dressing them is to cut them into thin strips. jr/?;?(?.—Yery young beans, 10 to 12 minutes; moderate size, 15 to 20 minutes, after the water boils. Average cost^ in full season, \s. 4.d. a peck; but, when forced, very expensive. Sufficient,—Allow i peck for 6 or 7 persons. Seasonable from the middle of July to the end of September; but may be had, forced, from February to the beginning of June. PRBNCH MODE OP COOKING PRENCH BEANS. 1091. Iis^GEEDiENTS.—A quart of French beans, 3 oz. of fresh butter, popper and salt to taste, the juice of i lemon. Mode.—Cut and boil the beans by the preceding recipe, and when tender, put them into a stewpan, and shake over the fire, to dry away the moisture from the beans. When quite dry and hot, add the butter, pepper, salt, and lemon-juice; keep moving the stewpan, without using a spoon, as that would break the beans; and when the butter is melted, and all is thoroughly hot, serve. If the butter should not mix well, add a tablespoonful of gravy, and serve very quickly.557 VEGETABLES. Tunc—Ahout i ^ouv to boil the beans; 10 minutes to shake tliem ever the fire. Average cost, in full season, about Is, id. a peck. Sufficient for 4 or 5 persons. Seasonable frona the middle of July to the end of September. BOILED BROAD OR WINDSOR BEANS. 1092. Ingredients.—To each gallon of water, allow 1 heaped tablespoonful of salt; beans. Mode—This is a favourite vegetable with many persons, but to be nice, should be young and freshly gathered. After shelling the beans, put them into boiling water, salted in the above proportion, and let them boil rapidly until tender. Drain them well in a colan- der; dish, and serve with them separately a tureen of parsley and butter. Boiled bacon should always accompany this vegetable, but the beans should be cooked separately. It is usually served with the beans laid round, and the parsley and butter in a tureen. Beans also make an excellent garnish to a ham, and when used for this purpose, if very old, should have their skins removed. Time.—Yery young beans, 15 minutes; when of a moderate size, 20 to 25 minutes, or longer. Average cost, unshelled, 6d. per peck. Sufficient.—Allow one peck for 6 or 7 persons. Seasonable in July and August. NuTKiTiVE Propeeties oe THE Beatt.—Tlic produce of beans in meal is, like tliat of Eeas, more in proportion to the grain than in any of the cereal grasses. A bushel of cans is supposed to yield fourteen pounds more of £l*ur than a bushel of oats; and a bushel of peas eighteen pounds moi'e, or, according to some, twenty pounds. A thou- sand parts of bean flour were found by Sir 11. Davy to yield 570 parts of nutritive matter, of which 426 were mucilage or starch, 103 gluten, and 41 extract, or matter rendered insoluble during the process. BROAD BEANS A LA POULETTE. 1093. Ingredients.—2 pints of broad beans, ^ pint of stock or broth, a small bunch of savoury herbs, including parsley, a small lump of sugar, the yolk of 1 egg, i pint of cream, pepper and salt to taste. Mode.—Procure some young and freshly-gathered beans, and shell sufficient to make 2 pints; boil them, as in the preceding recipe, until nearly done; then drain them and put them into a stewpan, with the stock, finely-minced herbs, and sugar. Stew the beans until perfectly tender, and the liquor has dried away a little; then beat up the yolk of an egg with the cream, add this to the beans, let the whole getMODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKEHY. thoroughly hot, and when on the point of simmering:, serve. Should the beans be very large, the skin should be removed previously to boiling them. Tune—10 minutes to boil the beans, 15 minutes to stew them in the stock. Average cost^ unshelled, 6c?. per peck. Seasonable in July and August. Origin and Varieties of the Bean.—This valuable plant is said to be a native of Egypt, but, like otber plants which have been domesticated, its origin is uncertain. It has been cultivated in Europe and Asia from time immemorial, and has been long known in Britain. Its varieties may be included under two general heads,—the white, or garden beans, and the grey, or field beans. Of the former, sown in the fields, the mazagan and long-pod are almost the only sorts; of the latter, those known as the horse-bean, the small or ticks, and the prolific of Heligoland, are the principal sorts. New varieties are procured in the same manner as in other plants. BOILSD BEHTKOOT. 1094. Ingredients.—Beetroot; boiling water. Ilode.—When large, young, and juicy, this vegetable makes a very excellent addition to winter salads, and may easily be con- verted into an economical and quickly-made pickle. {See 'No. 369.) Beetroot is more frequently served cold than hot: Tvhen the latter mode is preferred, melted butter should be sent to table with it. It may also be stewed with button onions, or boiled and served with roasted onions. Wash the beets thoroughly; but do not prick or break the skin before they are cooked, or they would lose their beautiful colour in boiling. Put them into boiling water, and let them boil until tender, keeping them well covered. If to be served hot, remove the peel quickly, cut the beetroot into thick slices, and send to table melted butter. For salads, pickle, &c., let the root cool, then peel, and cut it into slices. T^??2e.—Small beetroot, to 2 hours ; large, 2^ to 3 hours. Average cost, in full season, 2c?. each. Seasonable,—May be had at any time. Beetroot.—The geographical distribution of the order Saltworts (Salsolacece), to which beetroot belongs, is most common in extra-tropical and temperate regions, where they are common weeds, frequenting waste places, among rubbish, and on marshes by the seashore. In the tropics they are rare. They are characterized by the large quan- tity of mucilage, sugar, starch, and alkahne salts which are found in them. Many of them are used as potherbs, and some are emetic and vermifuge in their medicinal pro- perties. The root of garden or red beet is exceedingly wholesQme and nutritious, and Dr. Lyon Playiair has recommended that a good brown bread may be made by rasping down this root with an equal quantity of flour, lie says that the averiige quality of flour contains about 12 per cent, of azotized principles adapted for the formation of flesh, and the average quality of beet contains about 2 per cent, of the same materials.VEGETABLES.

Ingeedients.—To each i gallon of water allow 1 heaped tahlespoonful of salt; brocoli. ifibc/e.—Strip off the dead outside leaves, and the inside ones cut off level with the flower; cut off the stalk close at the bottom, and put the brocoli into cold salt and water, with the heads downwards. When they have re- mained in this for about f hour, and they are perfectl?/ free from insects, put them into a saucepan of hoiling water, salted in the above proportion, and keep them boiling quickly over a brisk fire, with the saucepan uncovered. Take them up v^ ith a slice the moment they are done ; drain them well, and serve vvith a tureen of melted butter, a little of which should be poured over the brocoli. If left in the water after it is done, it will break, its colour will be spoiled, and its crispness gone. Time.—Small brocoli, 10 to 15 minutes; large one, 20 to 25 minutes. Average cost, 2d. each. Sitfficieiit,—2 for 4 or 5 persons. Seasonable from October to March; plentiful in Feb- ruary and March. The Kohl-Eabi, or Tuhnip-Cabuagt:.—This variety pi'esents a singular development, inasmucli as the stem swells out like a large turnip on the surface of the ground, the leaves shooting from it all round, and the top being surmounted by a cluster of leaves issuing from it. Although not generally grown as a garden vegetable, if VLr-,ed when young and tender, it is wholesome, nutritious, and very palatable. BOILED BBUSSEIiS SPROUTS. J 096.

Keep them boiling quickly, with the lid uncovered, until tender; and the moment they are done, take them up, or their colour will be spoiled; when well drained, serve. The great art in cooking greens properly, and to have them a good colour, is to put them into plenty oi fast-boiling water, to let them boil very quickly, and to take them up the moment - they become tender. BRUSSELS Ti}ne.—Bvocoli sprouts, 10 to 12 minutes; young SPROUTS. greens, 10 to 12 minutes; sprouts, 12 minutes, after the water boils. Seasonable.—Sprouts of various kinds may be had all the year. Green Kale, or Borecole.—When Colewort, or Wild Cabbage, is brought into a state of cultivation, its character becomes greatly improved, although it still retains the loose open leaves, and in this form it is called Green Kale, or Borecole. The scientific name is Borecole oleracea acejphala, and of it there are many varieties, both as regards the form and colour of the leaves, us well as the height which the plants attain. We may observe, that among them, are included the Thousand-headed, and the Cow or Tree Cabbage. BOILED CABBAGE. 1098. Ingeedients.—To each 4 gallon of water allow 1 heaped tablespoonful of salt; a very small piece of soda. Mode.—Yick, off all the dead outside leaves, cut off as much of the stalk as possible, and cut the cabbages across twice, at the stalk end; if they should be very large, quarter them. Wash them well in coldVEGETABLES. 501 water, place tliem in a colander, and drain; then put them into plenty of fast-hoiling water, to wliich have been added salt and soda in the above proportions. Stir them down once or twice in the water, keep the pan uncovered, and let them boil quickly until tender. The instant they are done, take them up into a colander, place a plate over them, let them thoroughly drain, dish, and serve. Time.—Large cabbages, or savoys, J to J hour, young summer cabbage, 10 to 12 minutes, after the water boils. Average cost, 2d. each in full season. Sitffictott,—2 large ones for 4 or 5 persons. Seaso7iabIe.—Cahhsiges and sprouts of various kinds at any time. The Cabbage Tribe ; their Origiit.—Of all tlie tribes of the Cruciferce this is by far the most important. Its scientific name is BrassicccB, and it contains a collection of plants which, both in themselves and their products, occupy a prominent position in agriculture, commerce, and domestic economy. On the cliffs of Dover, and in many places on the coasts of Dorsetshire, Cornwall, and Yoi-kshire, there grove's a wild plant, with variously-indented, much-waved, and loose spreading leaves, of a sea-green colour, and large yellow :Uo\ver3. In spring, the leaves of this plant are collected by the inha- bitants, who, after boiling them in two waters, to remove the saltness, use them as a vegetable along with their moat. This is the Brassiea oleracea of science, the Wild Cabbage, or Colewort, from which have originated all tiie varietie3 of Cabbage, Cauli- flower, Greens, and Brocoli. STEWED BED CABBAGE. 1099. Ingredients.—1 red cabbage, a small slice of ham, § oz. of fresh butter, 1 pint of weak stock or broth, 1 gill of vinegar, salt and pepper to taste, 1 tablespoonful of pounded sugar. 3Iode.—Cut the cabbage into very thin slices, put it intoastewpan, with the ham cut in dice, the butter, h pint of stock, and the vinegar; cover the pan closely, and let it stew for 1 hour. When it is very tender, add the remainder of the stock, a seasoning of salt and pepper, and the pounded sugar; mix all well together, stir over the fire until nearly all the liquor is dried away, and serve. Fried sausages are usually sent to table with this dish: they should be laid round and on the cabbage, as a garnish. Time.—Rather more than 1 hour. Average costj id. each. Sufficient for 4 persons. Seasonable from September to January. The Wild Cabbage, or Cole-woet.—This plant, as it is found on the sea-clifFs of England, presents us with the origin of the cabbage tribe in its simplest and normal form. In this state it is the true Collet, or Colewort, although the name is now applied to any young cabbage which has a loose and open heart. BOILED CABBOTS. 1100. Ingredients.—To each h gallon of water, allow 1 heaped tablespoonful of salt; carrots. Mode,—Cut off the green tops, wash and scrape the carrots, and 2oMODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. 5C5 should there be any black specks, remove them. If very lar^e, cut them in halves, divide them lengthwise into four pieces, and put them into boiling water, salted in the above proportion; let them boil until tender, which may be ascertained by thrusting a fork into them : dish, and serve very hot. This vegetable is an indispensable accompaniment to boiled beef. Y\''hen thus served, it is usually boiled with the beef; a few carrots are placed round the dish as a garnish, and the remainder sent to table iu a vcgetable-dish. Young carrots do not require nearly so much boiling, nor should they be divided : these make a nice addition to stewed veal, &c. T/??2e.—Large carrots, If to 2i hours; young ones, about i hour. Average cost, 6d. to 8d, per bunch of 18. Sufficient,—i large carrots for 5 or 6 persons. Seasonable.—Young carrots from April to June, old ones at any time. Oeioin of TnE Careot.—In its wild state, this vegetable is found plentifully in Britain, both in cultivated lands and by waysides, and is known by the name of birds-nest, from its umbels of fruit becoming incurved from a hollow cup, like a birds-nest. In this state its root is whitish, slender, and hard, with an acrid, disagreeable taste, and a strong aromatic smell, and was formerly x^sed as an aperient. When cultivated, it is reddish, thick, fleshy, with a pleasant odour, and a peculiar, CAEEOTS. sweet, mucilaginous taste. The carrot is said by naturalists not to contain much nourishing matter, and, generally speak- ' ing, is somevv'hat difficult of digestion. TO DFvESS CARBOTS IH THE GERMAJsT WAY. 1101. Ingredients.—8 large carrots, 3 oz. of butter, salt to taste, a very little grated nutmeg, 1 tablespoonful of finely-minced parsley, 1 dessertspoonful of minced onion, rather more than 1 pint of weak stock or broth, 1 tablespoonful of flour. 3£ode.—Wash and scrape the carrots, and cut them into rings of about I inch in thickness. Put the butter into a stewpan; when it is melted, lay in the carrots, with salt, nutmeg, parsley, and onion in the above proportions. Toss the stewpan over the fire for a few minutes, and when the carrots are well saturated with the butter, pour in the stock, and simmer gently until they are nearly tender. Then put into another stev/pan a small piece of butter; dredge in about a tablespoonful of flour ; stir this over the fire, and when of a nice brown colour, add the liquor that the carrots have been boiling in ; let this just boil up, pour it over the carrots in the other stewpan, and let them finish simmering until quite tender. Serve very hotVEGETABLES. 563 This vegetable, dressed as above, is a favourite accompaniment of roast pork, sausages, &c. &c. Time.—About f hour. Average costy 6d. to Sd. per buncli of 18. Sufficient for 6 or 7 persons. Seasonable.—Young carrots from April to June, old ones at any- time. Constituents of the Caeeot,—These are erystallizable and uucrystallizable sugar, a little starcli, extractive, gluten, albumen, volatile oil, vegetable jelly, or pectin, saline matter, malic acid, and a peculiar erystallizable ruby-red neuter principle, v/ithout odour or taste, called carotin. This vegetable jelly, or pectin, so named from its singular property of gelatinizing, is considered by some as another form of gum or mucilage, combined with vegetable acid. It exists more or less in all vegetables, and is especially abundant in those roots and fruits from vrhich jellies are prepared. STEWED CARROTS. 1102. Ii^GEEDiENTS.—7 or 8 large carrots, 1 teacupful of broth, pepper and salt to taste, i teacupful of cream, thickening of butter and flour. Mode,—Scrape the carrots nicely; half-boil, and slice them into a stewpan; add the broth, pepper and salt, and cream; simmer till tender, and be careful the carrots are not broken. A few minutes before serving, mix a little flour with about 1 oz. of butter; thicken the gravy with this; let it just boil up, and serve. Teme.—About | hour to parboil the carrots, about 20 minutes to cook them after they are sliced. I Average cost, Gd. to 8c?. per bunch, of 18. I Sufficient for 5 or 6 persons. I Seasonable.—Young carrots from April to June, old ones at any I time. Nutritive Properties of the Carrot.—Sir H, Davy ascertained the nutritive matter of the carrot to amount to ninety-eight parts in one thousand; of which ninety- live are sugar and three are starch. It is used in winter and spring in the dairy to give colour and ilavour to butter; and it is excellent in stev/s, haricots, soups, and, when boiled whole, with salt beef. In the distilleiy, owing to the great proportion of sugar in its composition, it yields more spirit than the potato. The usual quantity is twelve gallons per ton. ' SLICED CARROTS. ! (Entremets, or to be served with the Second Course, as a Side-dish.) 1103. Ingeedients.—5 or 6 large carrots, a large lump of sugar, 1 pint of weak stock, 3 oz. of fresh butter, salt to taste. Mode.—Scrape and wash the carrots, cut them into slices of an equal size, and boil them in salt and water, until half done; drain them well, put them into a stewpan. with the sugar and stock, and I let them boil over a brisk fire. When reduced to a glaze, add the j 2 o 2 1 IMODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKEKr. fresh butter and a seasoning of salt; shake the stewpan about well, and when the butter is well mixed with the carrots, serve. There should be no sauce in the dish when it comes to table, but it should all adhere to the carrots. T{7ne.—Altogether, f hour. Average cost, 6d. to Sd, per bunch of 18. Sufficient for 1 dish. Seasonable.—Young carrots from April to June, old ones at any time. The Seed op thb Carhot.—In order to save the seed of carrots, the plan is, to select annually the most perfect and best-shaped roots in the takiug-up season, and either preserve tliem in sand in a cellar till spring, or plant thena immediately in an open airy part of the garden, protecting them ^^ ith litter during severe frost, or earthing tliem over, and uncovering them in March follovping. The seed is in no danger from being injured by any other plant. In August it is fit to gather, and is best preserved on the stalks till wanted. BOILED CAULIFLOWEK. BOILED CAULIFLOWEKS. 1104. Ingeediexts.—To each j gallon of water allow 1 heaped tablespoonful of salt. ilfo<7e.—Choose cauliflowers that are close and white; trim off the decaj^ed outside leaves, and cut the stalk off flat at the bottom. Open the flower a little in places to remove the in- sects, which generally are found about the stalk, and let the cauliflowers lie in salt and water for an hour previous to dressing them, with their heads downwards: this will effectually draw out all the vermin. Then put them into fast-boiling water, with the addition of salt in the above proportion, and let them boil briskly over a good fire, keeping the sauce* pan uncovered. The water should be well skimmed; and, when the cauliflowers are tender, take them up with a slice; let them drain, and, if large enough, place them upright in the dish. Serve with plain melted butter, a little of which may be poured over the flower. :ZVme.—Small cauliflower, 12 to 15 minutes, large one, 20 to 25 minutes, after the water boils. Average cost, for large cauliflowers, 6f7. each. Sufficient.—Allow 1 large cauliflower for 3 persons. Seasonahle from the beginning of June to the end of September. CAULIFLOWER.5Q5 VEGETABLES.

Witli a good heart, and nicely blanched, this vegetable is generally eaten raw, and is usually served with the cheese. Let the roots be washed free from dirt, all the decayed and outside leaves being cut off, preserving as much of the stalk as possible, and all specks or blemishes being care- fully removed. Should the celery be large, divide it lengthwdse into quarters, and place it, root downwards, in a celery-glass, which should be rather more than half filled with water. The top leaves may be curled, by shredding them in narrow strips with the point of a clean skewer, at a distance of about 4 inches from the top. Average cost^ 2d. per head. Sufficient.—Allow 2 heads for 4 or 5 persons. Seasonable from October to April. Note.—This vegetable is exceedingly useful for flavouring soups, sauces, &c., and makes a very nice addition to winter salad. STEWED CELERY A LA CREME. 1108. Ingredients.—6 heads of celery ; to each \ gallon of water allow 1 heaped tablespoonful of salt, 1 blade of pounded mace, ^ pint of cream. Mode.—Wash the celery thoroughly ; trim, and boil it in salt and water until tender.

Time.—Large heads of celery, 25 minutes; small ones, 15 to 20 minutes. Average cost, 2d. per head. Sufficient for 5 or 6 persons. Seasonable from October to April. Alexanders.—This plant is the Smyrnium olusfratum of science, and is used in this country in the same way in which celery is. It is a native of Great Britain, and is found in its wild state near the seacoast. It received its name from the Italian *' herba Alexandrinai^" and is supposed to have been originally brought from Alexandria; but, be this as it may, its cultivation is now almost entirely abandoned. STEWED CELEHY (with White Sauce). I. 1109. Ingredients.—6 heads of celery, 1 oz. of butter; to each567 VEGETABLES. i gallon of water allow 1 heaped tablespoonful of salt, I pint of wliite sauce, ^0. 537 or 538. Mode.—Have ready sufficient boiling water just to cover the celery, with salt and butter in the above proportion. Wash the celery well; cut off the decayed outside leaves, trim away the green tops, and shape the root into a point; put it into the boiling water; let it boil rapidly until tender; then take it out, drain well, place it upon a dish, and pour over about 4 pint of white sauce, made by either of the recipes 'No. 537 or 538. It may also be plainly boiled as above, placed on toast, and melted butter poured over, the same as asparagus is dished. Time.—Large heads of celery, 25 minutes, smal ones, 15 to 20 minutes, after the Vv'ater boils. Average cost, 2d. per head. Sufficient for 5 or 6 persons. Seasonable from October to April. Oeigin op Celeey.—111 the marshes and ditches of this country there is to be found a very common plant, known b}' the name of Smallage. This is the wild form of celery j but, by being sul)jGcted to cultivation, it loses its acrid nature, and becomes mild and sweet. In its natural state, it has a peculiar rank, coarse taste and smell, and its root was reckoned by the ancients as one of the " five greater aperient roots." There is a variety of this in which the root becomes turnip-shaped and large. It is called CelericB, and is extensively used by the Germans, and preferred by them to celery. In a raw state, this plant does not suit weak celeky. stomachs; cooked, it is less difficult of digestion, although a large quantity should not be II. 1110. Ingredients.—6 heads of celery, pint of white stock I or weak broth, 4 tablespoonfuls of cream,, thickening of butter and : iiour, 1 blade of pounded mace, a veri/ little grated nutmeg; pepper i and salt to taste. 3/o67^.—Wash the celery, strip off the outer leaves, and cut it into lengths of about 4 inches. Put these into a saucepan, with the broth, and stew till tender, which will be in from 20 to 25 minutes; then add the remaining ingredients, simmer altogether for 4 or 5 minutes, pour into a dish, and serve. It may be garnished with sippets of toasted bread. Time.—Altogether, i hour. Average cost, 2d. per head. Sufficient for 5 or 6 persons. Seasonable from October to April. Note.—By cutting the celery into smaller pieces, by stewing it a little longer, and, when done, by pressing it through a sieve, the above stew may be converted into a pur^e of celery.MODERN nOUSEnOLD COOKERY. 568 TO DRESS CUCUMBERS. 1111.

Geographical Distribution" of Cucumbers.—This family is not known in the frigid zone, is somewhat rare in the temperate, but in the tropical and warmer regions throughout the world they are abundant. They are most plentiful in the continent of Hindostan; but in America are not near so plentiful. Many of the kinds supply cucuiiBER. useful articles of consumption for food, and others are actively medicinal in their virtues. Generally speaking, c!olicate stomachs should avoid tliis plant, for it is cold and indigestible. CUCUMBERS A LA POULETTE. 1112. Ingeedients.—2 or 3 cucumbers, salt and vinegar, 2 oz. of butter, flour, J pint of broth, 1 teaspoonful of minced parsley, a lump of sugar, the yolks of 2 eggs, salt and pepper to taste. Mode.—Vare and cut the cucumbers into slices of an equal thick- ness, and let them remain in a pickle of salt and vinegar for | hour; then drain them in a cloth, and put them into a stewpan with the butter. Fry them over a brisk fire, but do not brown them, and then dredge over them a little flour; add the broth, skim off all the fat, which will rise to the surface, and boil gently until the gravy is somewhat reduced; but the cucumber should not be broken. Stir in the yolks of the eggs, add the parsley, sugar, and a seasoning of pepper and salt; bring the whole to the poitit of hoiling^ and serve. Time.—Altogether, 1 hour.

Sufficient for 4 or 5 persons. Seasonable,—Forced from the beginning of March to the end of June ; in full season in July and August. Properties and Uses op the Cucurbits.—The common cucumber is the C. sativus of science, and although the whole of the family have a similar action in the animal economy, yet there are some which present us with great anomalies. The roots of those which are perennial contain, besides fecula, which is their base, a resinous, acrid, and bitter principle. The fruits of this family, however, have in general a sugary taste, and are more or less dissolving and perfumed, as we find in the melons, gourds, cucumbers, vegetable-marrows, and squashes. But these are slightly laxative if partaken of largely. In tropical countries, this order furnishes the inhabitants with a large portion of their food, which, even in the most arid deserts and most barren islands, is of the finest quality. In China, Cashmere, and Persia, they are cultivated on the lakes on the lloating collections of weeds common in these localities. In India they are everjrwhere abundant, either in a cultivated or wild state, and the seeds of all the family are sweet and mucilaginous. STEWED CUCUMBERS. 1114- Ingeediekts.—3 large cucumbers, flour, butter, rather more than I pint of good brown gravy. 3fode,—Cut the cucumbers lengthwise the size of the dish they are intended to be served in; empty them of the seeds, and put them into boiling water with a little salt, and let them simmer for 5 minutes; then take them out, place them in another stewpan, with the gravy, and let them boil over a brisk fire until the cucumbers are tender.

It was introduced to this country from Jamaica, in 1570; since which period it has continued to he cultivated. It was formerly called the Musk Melon. EJSTDIVE. 1116. This vegetable, so beautiful in appearance, makes an excellent addition to winter salad, when lettuces and other salad herbs are not obtainable. It is usually placed in the centre of the dish, and looks remarkably pretty with slices of beetroot, hard-boiled eggs, and curled celery placed round it, so that the colours con- trast nicely. In preparing it, carefully wash and cleanse it free from insects, which are gene- rally found near the heart; remove any decayed or dead leaves, and dry it thoroughly by shaking in a cloth. This vegetable may also be served hot, stewed in cream, brQwn gravy, or butter; but when dressed thus, the sauce it is stewed in should not be very highly seasoned, as that would destroy and overpower the tlavour of the vegetable.

Withering states, that before the stems of the common Goats-beard shoot up, the roots, boiled like asparagus, have the same flavour, and are nearly as nutritious. We are also informed by Viilars that the children in Dauphine universally eat the stems and leaves of the young plant before the flowers appear, with great avidity. The fresh juice of these tender herbs is said to be the best solvent of bile. STEV\rED ENDIVE. 1117. IngeedieisTS.—6 heads of endive, salt and water, 1 pint of broth, thickening of butter and flour, 1 tablespoonful of lemon-juice, a small lump of sugar. 3fode.—Wash and free the endive thoroughly from insects, remove the green part of the leaves, and put it into boiling water, slightly salted. Let it remain for 10 minutes ; then take it out, drain it til] there is no water remaining, and chop it very fine. Put it into a stewpan with the broth ; add a little salt and a lump of sugar, and boil until the endive is perfectly tender. When done, which may be ascertained by squeezing a piece between the thumb and finger, add a thickening of butter and flour and the lemon-juice : let the sauce boil up, and serve.

Habicots an"D Lentils.—Although these vegetables are not much usedin this country, yet in France, and other Catholic countries, from their peculiar constituent properties, they form an excellent substitute for animal food during Lent and maigre days. At tho time of the prevalence of the Eoman religion in this country, they were probably much more generally used than at present. As reformations artf often carried beyond necessity, possibly lentils may have fallen into disuse, as an article of diet amongst Protestants, for fear the use of them might be considered a sign of popery. ii HABICOTS BIiANCS A LA MAITEE D'HOTiEIi. 1120. Ingkedients.—1 quart of white haricot beans, \ lb. of fresh butter, 1 tablespoonf td of minced parsley, popper and salt to taste, the juice of i lemon. i)lfoc?(?.—Should the beans be very dry, soak them for an hour or two in cold water, and boil them until perfectly tender, as in the preceding recipe. If the water should boil away, replenish it with a little more cold, which makes the skin of the beans tender. Let them be very thoroughly done; drain them well; then add to them the butter, minced parsley, and a seasoning of pepper and salt. Keep moving ' the stewpan over the fire without using a spoon, as this would break the beans; and, when the various ingredients are well mixed with them, squeeze in the lemon-juice, and serve very hot.

Seasonable in winter. ^." -^'^^.Jl-as.'K^..—This is thfi haricot llnna of fH« Frencli, and is a native of India. It ripens readuy, in dry summers, in most parts of Critain, but iU culture has hitherto beenVEGETABLES. .,,^73 confined to gardens in England; but ia Germany and Switzerland it is grown in fields. It is usually harvested by pulling up the plants, which, being dried, are stacked and thrashed. The haulm is both of little bulk and little use, but the seed is used in making the esteemed French dish called haricot, with which it were well if the working classes of this country were acquainted. There is, perhaps, no other vegetable dish so cheap and easily cooked, and, at the same time, so agreeable and nourishing. The beans are boiled, and then mixed with a little fat or salt butter, and a little milk or water and flour. From 3,840 parts of kidney-bean Einhoff obtained 1,805 parts of matter analogous to atarch, 351 of vegeto-animal matter, and 799 parts of mucilage, . HAHICOT BEANS AND MINCED ONIONS, iiai. Ingeedients.—1 quart of white haricot beans, 4 middling:- sized onions, I pint of good brown gravy, pepper and salt to taste, a little flour. 3fode.—Peel and mince the onions not too finely, and fry them m butter of a light brown colour; dredge over them a little flour, and add the gravy and a seasoning of pepper and salt. Have ready a pint of haricot beans well boiled and drained; put them with the onions and gravy, mix all well together, and serve very hot. Teme.—From 2 to 2i hours to boil the beans; 5 minutes to fry the onions. Average cost. Aid, per quart. Sufficient for 4 or 5 persons. Seasonable in winter. HOBSEBADISH. 1122. This root, scraped, is always served with hot roast beef, and is used for garnishing many kinds of boiled fish. Let the horseradish remain in cold water for an ho^r; wash it well, and with a sharp knife scrape it into very thin shreds, commencing from the thick end of the root. Arrange some of it lightly in a small glass dish, and the remainder use for garnishing the joint: it should be placed in tufts round the border of the dish, with I or 2 bunches on I the meat. Average cost, 2d, per stick. Seasonable from October to June. The Hoksekadish.—This belongs to the tribe Alyssidce, and is highly stimulant and exciting to the stomach. It has been recommended in chronic rheumatism, palsy, dropsical complaints, and in cases of enfeebled digestion. Its principal use, however, is as a condiment to promote appetite and excite the digestive organs. The horseradish contains sulphur to the extent of thirty per cent, in the number of its elements; and it is to the presence of this quality that the metal vessels in which the radish is some- times distilled, are turned into a black colour. It is one I of the most powerful excitants and antiscorbutics we have, j and forms the basis of several medical preparations, in the form of wines, tinctures, and syrups, hobsebabish.574 MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. LETTUCES. 1123. These form one of the principal ingredients to summer salads; should be nicely blanched, and be eaten young. They are seldom served in any other way, but may be stewed and sent to table in a good brown gravy flavoured with lemon-juice. In preparing them for a salad, carefully wash them free from dirt, pick off all the decayed and outer leaves, and dry them thoroughly by shaking them in a cloth. Cut off the stalks, and either halve or cut the lettuces into small pieces. The manner of cutting them up entirely depends on the salad for which they are intended. In France the lettuces are sometimes merely wiped with a cloth and not washed, the cooks there declaring that the act of washing them injuriously affects the pleasant crispness of the plant; in this case scrupulous attention must be paid to each leaf, and the grit thoroughly wiped away. Average cost, when cheapest, Id, each. SufficieiiU—Allow 2 lettuces for 4 or 5 persons. Seasonable from March to the end of August, but may be had all the year. The Lettuce.—Ail the varieties of the garden lettuce have originated from Vcxe Lactuca saiiva of science, which has never yet been found in a wild state. Henco it may be concluded "tliat it is merely another form of some species, changed through the effects of cultivation. In its young state, the lettuce forms a well-known and wholesome salad, containing a bland pellucid juice, with little taste or smell, and having a cooling and soothing influence on the system. This arises from the large qviantities of water and mucilage it contains, and not from any narcotic principle which it is supposed to possess. During the period of flowering, it abounds in a peculiar milky juice, which flows from the stem when wounded, and which has been found to be possessed of decided medicinal properties. BAKED MUSHROOMS. (A Breakfast, Luncheon, or Supper Dish.) 1124. Ingredients.—16 to 20 mushroom-flaps, butter, pepper to taste. Mode.—For this mode of cooking, the mushroom flaps are better than the buttons, and should not be too large. Cut off a portion of the stalk, peel the top, and wipe the mushrooms carefully with a piece of flannel and a little fine salt. Put them into a tin baking-disb, with a very small piece of butter placed on each mushroom; sprinkle over a little pepper, and let them bake for about 20 minutes, or longer should the mushrooms bo very large.

Put a small piece of butter on each mushroom, season with pepper and salt, and squeeze over them a few drops of lemon-juice. Place the dish before the fire, and when the butter is melted, serve very hot and quickly.

Ingredients.—To each quart of mushrooms, allow 3 oz, of butter, pepper and salt to taste, the juice of 1 lemon, clarified butter. Mode.—Peel the mushrooms, put them into cold water, with a little lemon-juice; take them out and drt/ them very carefully in a cloth. Put the butter into a stewpan capable of holding the mushrooms; when it is melted, add the mushrooms, lemon-juice, and a seasoning of pepper and salt; draw them down over a slow fire, and let them remain until their liquor is boiled away, and they have become quite dry, but be careful in not allowing them to stick to the bottom of the stewpan. When done, put them into pots, and pour over the top clarified butter. If wanted for immediate use, they will keep good a few days without being covered over. To re-warm them, put the mushrooms into a stewpan, strain the butter from them, and they will be ready for use. Average costy Id. each. Seasonable.—Meadow mushrooms in' September and October; cul- tivated mushrooms may be had at any time. Localities of the Mushroom.—Mushrooms are to be met witli in pastures, woods, and marshes, but are very capricious and uncertain in their places of growth, multitudes being obtained in one season where few or none were to be found in the preceding. They sometimes grow solitary, but more frequently they are gregarious, and rise in a regular circular form. Many species are employed by man as food ; but, generally speaking, they are difficult of digestion, and by no means very nourishing. Many of them are also of suspicious qualities. Little reliance can be placed either on their taste, smell, il or colour, as much depends on the situation in which tbey vegetate; and even the same « plant, it is affirmed, may be innocent when young, but become noxious when advanced i| in age. STEWED MUSHKOOMS. 1127. Ingeedients.—1 pint mushroom-buttons, 3 oz. of fresh butter, white pepper and salt to taste, lemon-juice, 1 teaspoonful of flour, cream or milk, \ teaspoonful of grated nutmeg. Mode.—Cut off the ends of the stalks, and pare neatly a pint of mushroom-buttons; put them into a basin of water, with a little lemon-juice, as they are done. When all are prepared, take them from the water with the hands, to avoid the sediment, and put them into a stewpan with the fresh butter, white pepper, salt, and the juice of J lemon; cover the pan closely, and let the mushrooms stew gently from 20 to 25 minutes; then thicken the butter with the above pro- portion of flour, add gradually sufficient cream, or cream and milk, to make the sauce of a proper consistency, and put in the grated nutmeg. If the mushrooms are not perfectly tender, stew them for 5 minutes longer, remove every particle of butter which may be floating on the top, and serve.VEGETABLES. 577 Time.—\ hour. Average cost^ from 9d. to 25. per pint. Sufficient for 5 or 6 persons. Seasonable—Mesidoyf miishrooms in September and October. To PEOCTJEE MtrsHEOOMS.—In order to obtain mushrooms at all seasons, several methods of propagation have been had recourse to. It is said that, in some parts of Italy, a species of stone is used for this purpose, which is described as being of two different kinds; the one is found in the chalk hills near IN'aples, and has a white, porous, stalactical appearance; the other is a hardened turf from some volcanic moantaina near Florence. These stones are kept in cellars, and occasionally moistened with water which has been used in the washing of mushrooms, and are thus supplied with their minute seeds. In this country, gardeners provide themselves with what is called spawn, either from the old manure of cucumber-beds, or purchase it from those whose business it is to propagate it. When thus procured, it is usually made up for sale in quadriis, consisting of numerous white fibrous roots, having a strong smell of mushrooms. This is planted in rows, in a dry situation, and carefully attended to for five or six weeks, when the bed begins to produce, and continues to do so for several months.

Seaso7iahle.—Kedidiow mushrooms in September and October. Analysis of Fungi.—The fungi have been examined chemically with much caro, both by MM. Bracannot and Vauquelin, who designate the insoluble spongy matter by the name of fungiu, and the soluble portion is found to contain the bolotic and the fuugic acids, BAKED SPANISH ONIONS. 1129. Ingredients.—4 or 5 Spanish onions, salt, and water. Mode.—Put the onions, with their skins on, into a saucepan of boiling water slightly salted, and let them boil quickly for an hour. Then take them out, wipe them thoroughly, wrap each On: in a piece of paper separately, and bake them in a moderate oven for 2 hours, or longer, should the onions be very large. They may be served in their skins, and eatefl with a piece of cold butter and a seasoning of pepper and salt; or they may be peeled, and a good brown gravy poured over them. 2 P578 MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. Time.—I hour to boil, 2 hours to bake. Average cost, medium-sized, 2d, each. Suficient for 5 or 6 persons. Seasonable from September to January. Tee Genus Allium.—The Onion, like the Leek, Garlic, and Shalot, belongs to the g:enu3 Allium^ which is a numerous species of vegetable j and every one of them possesses, more or less, a volatile and acrid pene- trating principle, pricking the thin transparent membrane of the eyelids ; and all are very similar in their properties. In the whole of them the bulb is the most active part, and any one of them may supply the place of the other; for they are all irritant, excitant, and vesicant. With many, the onion is a very great favourite, and is considered an extremely nutritive vegetable. The Spanish kind is frequently taken for supper, it being simply boiled, and then seasoned with salt, pepper, and butter. Some dredge on a little flour, but many prefer it without this. BUBISTT OHIOISrS FOR GRAVIES. 1130. Ikgkedients.—J lb. of onions, f pint of water, i lb. of moist sugar, I pint of vinegar. Mode.—Peel and chop the onions fine, and put them into a stewpan (not tinned), with the water; let them boil for 5 minutes, then add the sugar, and simmer gently until the mixture becomes nearly black and throws out bubbles of smoke. Have ready the above proportion of boiling vinegar, strain the liquor gradually to it, and keep stirring with a wooden spoon until it is well incorporated. When cold, bottle for use. JVme.—Altogether, 1 hour. Properties of the Onion".—The onion is possessed of a white, acrid, volatile oil, holding sulf)hur in solution, albumen, a good deal of uncrystallizable sugar and muci- lage ; phosphoric acid, both free and combined with lime; acetic acid, citrate of lime, and lignine. Of all the species of allium, the onion has the volatile principle in the greatest degree ; and hence it is impossible to separate the scales of the root without the eyes being affected. The juice is sensibly acid, and is capable of being, by fermentation, converted into vinegar, and, mixed with water or the dregs of beer, yields, by distillation, an alcoholic liquor. Although used as a common esculent, onions are not suited to aU stomachs; there are some who cannot eat them either fried or roasted, whilst others prefer them boiled, which is the best way "of using them, as, by the process they then undergo, they are deprived of their essential oil. The pulp of roasted onions, vydth oil, forms an excellent anodyne and emoUient poultice to suppurating tumours. STEWED SPANISH ONIONS. 1131. Ik-gsedients.—5 or 6 Spanish onions, 1 pint of good broth or gravy. Mode.—Peel the onions, taking care not to cut away too much of the tops or tails, or they would then fall to pieces ; put them into a stewpan capable of holding them at the bottom without piling them one on the top of another; add the broth or gravy, and simmer very gently until the oniony are perfectly tender. Dish them, pour the gravy round, and serve. Instead of using broth, Spanish onions may579 VEGETABLES. be stewed with a large piece of butter: they must be done very gradually over a slow fire or hot-plate, and will produce plenty of gravy. Time.—To stew in gravy, 2 hours, or longer if very large. Average cost,—medium-sized, 2c?. each. Sufficient for 6 or 7 persons. Seasonable from September to January. JS'ote.—Stewed Spanish onions are a favourite accompaniment to roast shoulder of mutton. OsiGiN OF THE Okioh".—This Vegetable is thouglit to have originally come from India, through Egypt, where it became an object of worship. Thence it was transmitted to Greece, thence to Italy, and ultimately it was distributed throughout Europe, in almost every part of \Yhich it has, from time immemorial, been cultivated. In warm climates it is found to be less acrid and much sweeter than in colder latitudes; and in Spain it is not at all unusual to see a peasant munching an onion, as an Englishman would an apple. Spanish onions, which are imported to this country during the winter months, are, when properly roasted, perfectly sweet, and equal to many preserves, BOILED PARSHIPS. 1132. Ingredients.—Parsnips; to each i gallon of water allow 1 heaped tablespoonful of salt. Mode.—Wash the parsnips, scrape them thoroughly, and, with the point of the knife, remove any black specks about them, and, should they be very large, cut the thick part into quarters. Put them into a saucepan of boiling water salted in the above proportion, boil them rapidly until tender, which may be ascertained by thrusting a fork in them; take them up, drain them, and serve in a vegetable-dish. This vegetable is usually served with salt fish, boiled pork, or boiled beef: when sent to table with the latter, a few should be placed alternately with carrots round the dish, as a garnish. 2Vme.—Large parsnips, 1 to hour; small ones, i to 1 hour. Average cost, Id. each. Sufficient.—Allow 1 for each person. Seasonable from October to May. The Paeskip.—This vegetable is found wild in meadows all over Europe, and, in England, is met with very fre- quently on diy banks in a chalky soil. In its wild state, the root is white, mucilaginous, aromatic, and sweet, with some degree of acrimony: when old, it has been known to cause vertigo. Willis relates that a whole family fell into delirium from having eaten of its roots, and cattle never touch it in its wild state. In domestic economy the parsnip is much used, and is found to be a highly nutritious vege- table. In times of scarcity, an exceUent bread has been made from the roots, and they also furnish an excellent wine, resembliug the malmsey of Madeu-a and the Canaries: a spirit is also obtained from them in as great quantities as from carrots. The composition of the parsnip-root has been found to be 79-4 of water, G-9 starch and fibre, 6-1 gum, 5-5 sugar, and 2-1 of albumen. 2 P 2MODEEN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. 580 BOILED GKEEN PEAS. 1133. Ingredients.—Green peas; to each i gallon of water allow 1 S7nall teaspoonful of moist sugar, 1 lieaped tablespoonful of salt. Mode.—This delicious vegetable, to be eaten in perfection, should be young, and not gathered or shelled long before it is dressed. Shell the peas, wash them well in cold water, and drain them; then put them into a saucepan with plenty of fast-hoilmg water, to which salt and moist sugar have been added in the above proportion; let them boil quickly over a brisk fire, with the lid of the saucepan uncovered, and be careful that the smoke does not draw in. When tender, pour them into a colander; put them into a hot vegetable-dish, and quite in the centre of the peas place a piece of butter, the size of a walnut. Many cooks boil a small bunch of mint with the peas, or garnish them wdth it, by boiling a few sprigs in a saucepan by themselves. Should the peas be very old, and difficult to boil a good colour, a very tiny piece of soda may be thrown in the water previous to putting them in; but this must be very sparingly used, as it causes the peas, when boiled, to have a smashed and broken appearance. With young peas, there is not the slightest occasion to use it. Time.—Young peas, 10 to 15 minutes; the large sorts, such as marrowfats, &c., 18 to 24 minutes ; old peas, i hour. Average cost, when cheapest, Q>d, per peck; when first in season, Is, to Is. Qd, per peck. Sufficient.—Al\o\Y 1 peck of unshelled peas for 4 or 5 persons. Seasonable from June to the end of August. Origin" op the Pea.—All the varieties of garden peas which are cultivated have originated from the Pisum sativum, a native of the south of Europe ; and field peas are varieties of Fisum arvense. The Evei'lasting Pea is LatTiyriis latifolius, an old favourite in flower-gardens. It is said to yield an abundance of honey to bees, which are remark- ably fond of it. In this country the pea has been grown from time immemorial; but its culture seems to have diminished since the more general introduction of herbage, plants, and roots, G-BEBN PEAS A LA FRAlSrCAISE. 1134. Ingeedients.—2 quarts of green peas, 3 oz. of fresh butter, a bunch of parsley, 6 green onions, flour, a small lump of sugar, 4 teaspoonful of salt, a teaspoonful of flour. Jfb(7e.—Shell sufficient fresh-gathered peas to fill 2 quarts; put them into cold water, with the above proportion of butter, and stir them about until they are well covered with the butter; drain them in a colander, and put them in a stewpan, with the parsley and onions; dredge over them a little flour, stir the peas well, and moisten them with boiling water; boil them quickly over a large fire for 20 minutes, or until there is no liquor remaining. Dip a ,581 VEGETABLES. small lump of sugar into some water, that it may soon melt; put it with the peas, to which add J teaspoonful of salt. Take a piece of butter the size of a walnut, work it together with a teaspoonful of flour ; and add this to the peas, which should be boiling when it is put in. Keep shaking the stewpan, and, when the peas are nicely thick- ened, dress them high in the dish, and serve. Tiine.—Altogether, f hour. Average cosfy 6d, per peck. Sufficient for 4 or 5 persons. Seasonable from June to the end of August. Varieties op the Pea.—The varieties of the Pea are numerous; but they may ba divided into two classes—those grown for the ripened seed, and those grown for gather- ing in a green state. The culture of the latter is chiefly confined to the neighbourhoods of large towns, and may be considered as in part rather to belong to the operations of the gardener than to those of the agriculturist. The grey varieties are the early grey, the late grey, and the purple grey ; to which some add the Marlborough grey and the horn grey. The white varieties grown in fields are the pearl, early Charlton, golden hotspur, the common white, or Sujffolk, and other Suffolk varieties. STEWED GBEEK PEAS. 1135. IiTGREDiENTS.—1 quart of peas, 1 lettuce, 1 onion, 2 oz. of butter, pepper and salt to taste, 1 egg, | teaspoonful of powdered sugar. Ifode—Shell the peas, and cut the onion and lettuce into slices; put these into a stewpan, with the butter, pepper, and salt, but with no more water than that which hangs round the lettuce from washing. Stew the whole very gently for rather more than 1 hour; then stir to it a well-beaten egg, and about ^ teaspoonful of powdered sugar. When the peas, &c., are nicely thickened, serve ; but, after the egg is added, do not allow them to boil. Time.—Ij hour. Average cost, 6d. per peck. Svfficient for 3 or 4 persons. Seasonable from June to the end of August. The Sweet-pea and the Heath oe Wood-pea. —The Avell-known sweet-pea forms a fine covering to a trellis, or lattice-work in a flower-garden. Its gay and fragrant flowers, with its rambling habit, render it pecuharly adapted for such a purpose. The wood- f)ea, or heath-pea, is found in the heaths of Scot- and, and the Highlanders of that country are ex- tremely partial to them, and dry and chew them to give a greater relish to their whiskey. They also regard them as good against chest complaints, and say that by the use of them they are enabled to with- stand hunger and thirst for a long time. The peas have a sweet taste, somewhat like the root of li- quorice, and, when boiled, have an agreeable flavour, and are nutritive. In times of scarcity they have served as an article of food. When well boiled, a fork will pass through them; and, slightly dried, they are roasted, and in Holland and Flanders served up like chestnuts.MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. 582 BAKED POTATOES. 1136. Ingredients—Potatoes. Mode.—Choose large potatoes, as much of a size as possible; "wash them in lukewarm water, and scrub them well, for the browned skin of a baked potato is by many persons considered the better part of it. Put them into a moderate oven, and bake them for about 2 hours, turning them three or four times whilst they are cooking. Serve BAKED POTATOES sEKVED thom iu a uapkiu immediately they are done, IN KXTKm, if ]jep^ a long time in the oven, they have a shrivelled appearance. Potatoes may also be roasted before the fire, - in an American oven; but when thus cooked, they must be done very slowly. Do not forget to send to table with them a piece of cold butter. Time.—Large potatoes, in a hot oven U hour to 2 hours; in a cool oven, 2 to 2i hours. Average cost^ is. per bushel. Sufficient.—Allow 2 to each person. Seasonable all the year, but not good just before and whilst new potatoes are in season. PoTATO-SuGAE.—TMs sugarj substance, found in the tubers of potatoes, ia obtained in the form of syrup or treacle, and has not yet been crystallized. It resembles the sugar of grapes, has a very sweet taste, and may be used for making sweetmeats, and as a substitute for honey. Sixty pounds of potatoes, yielding eight pounds of dry starch, wiU produce seven and a half pounds of sugar. In Kussia it is extensively made, as good, though of less consistency than the treacle obtained from cane-sugar. A spirit is also distilled from the tubers, which resembles brandy, but is milder, and has a flavour as if it were charged with the odour of violets or raspberries. In France this manu- facture is carried on pretty extensively, and five hundred pounds of the tubers will produce twelve quarts of spirit, the pulp being given to cattle. TO BOIIi POTATOES. 1137. iKaEEDiENTS.—10 or 12 potatoes; to each | gallon of water allow 1 heaped tablespoonful of salt. Mode.—Choose potatoes of an equal size, pare them, take out all the eyes and specks, and as they are peeled, throw them into cold water. Put them into a saucepan, with sufficient cold water to cover them, with salt in the above proportion, and let them boil gently until tender. Ascertain when they are done by thrusting a fork in them, and take them up the moment they feel soft through; for if they are left in the water afterwards, they become waxy or watery. Drain away the water, put the saucepan by the side of the fire, with the lid partially uncovered, to allow the steam to escape, and let the potatoes get thoroughly dry, and do not allow them to get burnt. Their superfluous moisture will evaporate, a-nd the potatoes, if a good sort,VEGETABLES. 588 should be perfectly mealy and dry. Potatoes vary so mucli in quality and size, that it is difficult to give the exact time for boiling; they should be attentively watched, and probed with a fork, to ascertain when they are cooked. Send them to table quickly, and very hot, and with an opening in the cover of the dish, that a portion of the steam may evaporate, and not fall back on the potatoes. Time.—Moderate-sized old potatoes, 15 to 20 minutes after the water boils ; large ones, i hour to 35 minutes. Average cost, 4s. per bushel. /Sufficient for 6 persons. Seasonable all the year, but not good just before and whilst new potatoes are in season. JS^ote.—To keep potatoes hot, after draining the water from them, put a folded cloth or flannel (kept for the purpose) on the top of them, keeping the saucepan-lid partially uncovered. This will absorb the moisture, and keei^ them hot some time without spoiling. The Potato.—The potato belongs to the family of the Solanaoece, the greater number of wiiich inhabit the tropics, and the remainder are distributed over the temperate regions of both hemispheres, bnt do not extend to the arctic and antarctic zones. The whole of the family are suspicions; a great number are narcotic, and many are delete- rious. The roots partake of the proxoerties of the plants, and are sometimes even more active. The tubercles of such as produce them, are amylaceous and nutritive, as in. those of the potato. The leaves are generally narcotic ; but they lose this principle in boiling, as is the case with the Solanum nigrum, which are used as a vegetable when cooked. TO BOIIi POTATOSB TN THSIB JAOKSTS. 1138. IiSTGEEDiENTS.—10 or 12 potatoes ; to each i gallon of water, allow 1 heaped tablespoonful of salt. Mode.—To obtain this wholesome and delicious vegetable cooked in perfection, it should be boiled and sent to table with the skin on. In Ireland, where, perhaps, the cooking of potatoes is better under- stood than in any country, they are always served so. Wash the pota- toes well, and if necessary, use a clean scrubbing-brush to remove the dirt from them; and if possible, choose the potatoes so that they may all be as nearly the same size as possible. When thoroughly cleansed, fill the saucepan half full with them, and just cover the potatoes with cold water, salted in the above proportion: they are more quickly boiled with a small quantity of water, and, besides, are more savoury than when drowned in it. Ering them to boil, then draw the pan to the side of the fire, and let them simmer gently until tender. Ascer- tain when they are done by probing them with a fork ; then pour the water, uncover the saucepan, and let the potatoes dry by the side of the fire, taking care not to let them burn. Peel them quickly, put them in a very hot vegetable-dish, either with or without a narjkin, and serve very quickly. After potatoes are cooked, they should neverMODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. be entirely covered up, as the steam, instead of escaping, falls down on them, and makes them watery and insipid. In Ireland they are usually served up with the skins on, and a small plate is placed by the side of each guest. JVme.—Moderate-sized potatoes, with their skins on, 20 to 25 minutes after the water boils ; large potatoes, 25 minutes to f hour, or longer ; 5 minutes to dry them. Average cost, 4s. per bushel. Sufficient for 6 persons. Seasonable all the year, but not good just before and whilst new potatoes are in season. Analysis of the Potato.—Next to the cereals, the potato is the most valuable plant for the production of human food. Its tubers, according to analysis conducted by- Mr. Fromberg, in the laboratory of the Agricultural Chemical Association in Scotland, contain the following ingredients:—75*52per cent, of water, 15"72 starch, 0*55 dextrine, 3"3 of impure saccharine matter, and 3*25 of fibre with coagulated albumen. In a dried state the tuber contains 64'2 per cent, of starch, 2"25 of dextrine, 13'4<7 of impure saccharine matter, 5*77 of caseine, gluten, and albumen, 1 of fatty matter, and 13'31 of fibre with coagulated albumen. TO BOIL NEW POTATOES. 1139. Ingredients.—Potatoes; to each i gallon of water allow 1 heaped tablespoonful of salt. Mode.—Do not have the potatoes dug long before they are dressed, as they are never good when they have been out of the ground some time. Well wash them, rub off the skins with a coarse cloth, and put them into hoiling water salted in the above proportion. Let them boil until tender; try them with a fork, and when done, pour the water away from them; let them stand by the side of the fire with the lid of the saucepan partially uncovered, and when the potatoes are thoroughly dry, put them into a hot vegetable-dish, with a piece of butter the size of a walnut; pile the potatoes over this, and serve. If the potatoes are too old to have the skins rubbed off, boil them in their jackets; drain, peel, and serve them as above, with a piece of butter placed in the midst of them. Time,—\ to i hour, according to the size. Average cost^ in full season, Id, per lb. Sufficient,—Allow 3 lbs. for 5 or 6 persons. Seasonable in May and June, but may be had, forced, in March. Potato Staech.—This fecula has a beautiful white crystalline appearance, and is inodorous, soft to the touch, insoluble in cold, but readily soluble in boiling water. It is on this starch that the nutritive properties of the tubers depend. As an ahment, it is well adapted for invalids and persons of delicate constitution. It may be used in the form of arrow-root, and eaten with milk or sugar. For pastry of all kinds it is more light and easier of digestion than that made with flour of wheat. In confectionery it serves to form creams and jellies, and in cookery may be used to thicken soups and sauces. It accommodates itself to the chest and stomach of children, for whom it is well adapted; and it is an aliment that cannot be too generally used, as much on account of its ^yholesomeness as its cheapness, and the ease with which it is kept, which are equal, if not superior, to all the much-vaunted exotic feculee ; as, salep, tapioca, sago, and arrow-root.585 VEGETABLES. TO STEAM POTATOES. 1140. Ingeedients.—Potatoes ; boiling water. Mode—This mode of cooking potatoes is now mucli in vogue, particularly where they are wanted on a large scale, it being so very convenient. Pare the potatoes, throw them into cold water as they -are peeled, then put them into a steamer. Place the steamer over a saucepan of boiling water, and steam the potatoes from 20 to 40 minutes, according to the size and sort. When a fork goes easily through them, they are done ; then take them up, dish, and serve very quickly. Time.—20 to 40 minutes. Average cost^ 4s. per bushel. Sufficient.—Allow 2 large potatoes to each person. Seasonable all the year, but not so good whilst new potatoes are in season. Uses op the Potato.—Potatoes boiled and beaten along with sour milk form a sort of cheese, which is made in Saxony; and, when kept in close vessels, may be preserved for several years. It is generally supposed that the water in which potatoes are boiled IS injurious ; and as instances are recorded where cattle having drunk it were seriously affected, it may be well to err on the safe side, and avoid its use for any alimentary purpose. Potatoes which have been exposed to the air and become green, are very un- wholesome. Cadet de Vaux asserts that potatoes will clean linen as well as soap; and it is well known that the berries of the S. saponaceum are used in Peru for the same purpose. HOW TO USE COLD POTATOES. SI41. Ingeedients.—The remains of cold potatoes; to every lb. allow 2 tablespoonfuls of flour, 2 ditto of minced onions, 1 oz. of butter, milk. Mode.—'M.2ish. the potatoes with a fork until perfectly free from lumps; stir in the other ingredients, and add sufficient milk to moisten them well; press the potatoes into a mould, and bake in a moderate oven until nicely brown, which will be in from 20 minutes to i hour. Turn them out of the mould, and serve. Tiine.—20 minutes to i hour. Seasonable at any time. Potato Bee ad.—The manner in which this is made is very simple. The adhesive tendency of the flour of the potato acts against its being baked or kneaded without being mixed with wheaten flour or meal j it may, however, be made into cakes in the following manner:—A small wooden frame, nearly square, is laid on a pan like a frying-pan, and is grooved, and so constructed that, by means of a presser or lid introduced into the groove, the cake is at once fashioned, aocording to the dimensions of the mould. The frame containing the farina may be almost immediately withdrawn after the mould is formed upon the pan; because, from the consistency imparted to the incipient cake by the heat, it will speedily admit of being safely handled : it must not, however, be fried too hastily. It will then eat very palatably, and might from time to time be soaked for puddings, Uke tapioca, or might be used like the cassada-cake, for, when well buttered and toasted, it will be found an excellent accompaniment to breakfast. In Scotland, cold boiled potatoes are frequently squeezed up and mixed with flour or oatmeal, and an excellent cake, or scon, obtained.MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. 586 FEIED POTATOES (French Faroliion). 1142. IiTGEEDiEi^TS.—Potatoes, hot butter or clarified dripping, salt. Mode.—Teel and cut the potatoes into thin slices, as nearly the same size as possible; make some butter or dripping quite hot in a frying-pan ; put in the potatoes, and fry them on both sides of a nice brown. When they are crisp and done, take them up, place them on a cloth before the fire to drain the grease from them, and serve very hot, after sprinkling them with salt. These are delicious with rump-steak, and, in France, are frequently served thus as a breakfast dish. The remains of cold potatoes may also be sliced and fried by the above recipe, but the slices must be cut a little thicker. Ti7ne.—Sliced raw potatoes, 5 minutes ; cooked potatoes, 6 minutes. Average cost, As. per bushel. Sufficient,—Q sliced potatoes for 3 persons. Seasonable at any time. A GERMASr METHOD OF COOKIKG POTATOES. 1143. Ingkedients.—8 to 10 middling-sized potatoes, 3 oz. of but- ter, 2 tablespoonfuls of flour, h pint of broth, 2 tablespoonfuls of vinegar. Ilode.—Pnt the butter and flour into a stewpan; stir over the tire until the butter is of a nice brown colour, and add the broth and vinegar; peel and cut the potatoes into long thin slices, lay them in the gravy, and let them simmer gently until tender, which will be in from 10 to 15 minutes, and serve very hot. A laurel-leaf simmered with the potatoes is an improvement. Time.—10 to 15 minutes. Seasonable at any time. pRESEBViHG POTATOES.—In general, potatoes are stored or preserved in pits, cellars, pies, or camps; but, whatever mode is adopted, it is essential that the tubers be perfectly dry; otherwise, they will surely rot; and a few rotten potatoes will contaminate a whole mass. The pie, as it is called, consists of a trench, lined and covered with straw; the potatoes in it being piled in the shape of a house roof, to the height of about three feet. The camps are shallow pits, filled and ridged up in a simOar manner, covered pp with the excavated mould of the pit. In Kussia and Canada, the potato is preserved in boses, in houses or cellars, heated, when necessary, to a temperature one or two degrees above the freezing-point, by stoves. To keep potatoes for a considerable time, the best way is to place them in thin layers on a platform suspended in an ice-cellar: there, the temperature being always below that of active vegetation, they will not sprout; while, not being above one or two degrees below the freezing-point, the tubers will not be frostbitten. Another mode is to scoop out the eyes with a very small scoop, and keep the roots buried in earth; a third mode is to destroy the vital principle, by kiln-drying, steaming, or scalding; a fourth is to bury them so deep in dry soil, that no change of temperature will reach them; and thus, being without air, they will remain upwards of a year without vegetating.VEGETABLES. 587 POTATOES A LA MAITRE D'HOTEL. 1144. Ingeedients.—Potatoes, salt and water ; to every 6 potatoes allow 1 tablespoonful of minced parsley, 2 oz. of butter, pepper and salt to taste, 4 tablespoonfuls of gravy, 2 tablespoonfuls of lemon-juice. Mode,—Wash the potatoes clean, and boil them in salt and water by recipe No. 1138 ; when they are done, drain them, let them cool; then peel and cut the potatoes into thick slices : if these are too thin, they would break in the sauce. Put the butter into a stewpan with the pepper, salt, gravy, and parsley; mix these ingredients well toge- ther, put in the potatoes, shake them two or three times, that they may be well covered with the sauce, and, when quite hot through, squeeze in the lemon-juice, and serve. Time.—J to 2 hour to boil the potatoes ; 10 minutes for them to heat in the sauce. Average cost, is. per bushel. Sufficient for 3 persons. Seasonable all the year. MASHED POTATOES. 1145. Ingeedients.—Potatoes; to every lb. of mashed potatoes allow 1 oz. of butter, 2 tablespoonfuls of milk, salt to taste. Mode.—Boil the potatoes in their skins ; when done, drain them, and let them get thoroughly dry by the side of the fire ; then peel them, and, as they are peeled, put them into a clean saucepan, and with a large fork beat them to a light paste; add butter, milk, and salt in the above proportion, and stir all the ingredients well over the fire. When thoroughly hot, dish them lightly, and draw the fork backwards over the potatoes to make the surface rough, and serve. When dressed in this manner, they may be browned at the top with a salamander, or before the fire. Some cooks press the potatoes into moulds, then turn them out, and brown them in the oven: this is a pretty mode of serving, but it makes them heavy. In whatever way they are sent to table, care must be taken to have them quite free from lumps. Time.—From i to f hour to boil the potatoes. Average cost, 4s. per bushel. Sufficient,—1 lb. of mashed potatoes for 3 persons. Seasonable at any time. PUBEm DS POMMSIS DE TSBSS, or. Very TMn-mashed Potatoes. 1146. Ingeedients.—To every lb. of mashed potatoes allow i pint of good broth or stock, 2 oz. of butter.MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY, 588 Mode—Boil the potatoes, well drain them, and pound them smoothly in a mortar, or beat them np with a fork; add the stock or broth, and rub the potatoes through a sieve. Put the puree into a very clean saucepan with the butter; stir it well over the fire until thoroughly hot, and it will then be ready to serve. A puree should be rather thinner than mashed potatoes, and is a delicious accompaniment to delicately broiled mutton cutlets. Cream or milk may be substituted for the broth when the latter is not at hand. A casserole of potatoes, which is often used for ragouts instead of rice, is made by mashing potatoes rather thickly, placing them on a dish, and making an opening in the centre. After having browned the potatoes in the oven, the dish should be wiped clean, and the ragout or fricassee poured in. Time.—Ahout | hour to boil the potatoes; 6 or 7 minutes to warm the puree. Average cost, is. per bushel. Sufficient.—Allow 1 lb. of cooked potatoes for 3 persons. Seasonable at any time. Varieties op the Potato.—These are very numerous. " They differ," says an authority, " in their leaves and bulk of haulm; in the colour of the skin of the tubers; in the colour of the interior, compared with that of the skin; in the time of ripening; in being farina- ceous, glutinous, or watery; in tasting agreeably or disagreeably; in cooking readily or tediously; in the length of the subterraneous stolones to which the tubers are attached ; in blossoming or not blossoming; and, finally, in the soil which they prefer." The earliest varieties grown in fields are,—the Early Kidney, the Nonsuch, the Early Shaw, and the Early Champion. This last is the most generally cultivated round London : it is both SWEBT POTATO. mealy and hardy. The sweet potato is but rarely eaten in Britain; but in America it is often servea at table, and is there very highly esteemed. POTATO BIS SOLES. 1147. Ingbedients.—Mashed potatoes, salt and pepper to taste; when liked, a very little minced parsley, egg, and bread crumbs. Mode.—Boil and mash the potatoes by recipe No. 1145; add a seasoning of pepper and salt, and, when liked, a little minced parsley.

Time.—lQ minutes to fry the rissoles. Seasonable at any time. Note.—The flavour of these rissoles may be very much increased by adding finely-minced tongue or ham, or even chopped onions, when these are liked.VEGETAELES. 589 Qualities of Potatoes.—In making a clioice from the many varieties of potatoes which are everywhere found, the best way is to get a sample and taste them, and then fix upon the kind which best pleases your palate. The Shaw is one of the most esteemed of the early potatoes for field culture; and the Kidney and Bread-fruit are also good sorts. The Lancashire Pink is also a good potato, and is much cultivated in the neigh- bourhood of Liverpool. As late or long-keeping potatoes, the Tartan or lied-apple stands very high in favour. POTATO SNOW. 1148. Ingeedients.—Potatoes, salt, and water. Mode.—Choose large white potatoes, as free from spots as possible; boil them in their skins in salt and water until perfectly tender; drain and dry them thoroughly by the side of the fire, and peel them. Put a hot dish before the fire, rub the potatoes through a coarse sieve on to this dish; do not touch them afterwards, or the flakes will fall, and serve as hot as possible. Ti7ne.—i to f hour to boil the potatoes. Average cost^ is. per bushel. Sufficient—Q potatoes for 3 persons. Seasonable at any time. The Potato as an Article oe Human Food.—This valuable esculent, next to wheat, is of the greatest importance in the eye of the political economist. From no other crop that can be cultivated does the public derive so much benefit; and it has been demon- strated that an acre of potatoes will feed double the number of people that can be fed from an acre of wheat. TO DRESS SALSIFY. 1149. Ingrediei^ts.—Salsify; to each i gallon of water allow 1 heaped tablespoonful of salt, 1 oz. of butter, 2 tablespoonfuls of lemon-juice. Mode.—Scrape the roots gently, so as to strip them only of their outside peel; cut them into pieces about 4 inches long, and, as they are peeled, throw them into water with which has been mixed a little lemon-juice, to prevent their discolouring. Put them into boiling water, with salt, butter, and lemon-juice in the above proportion, and let them boil rapidly until tender ; try them with a fork; and, when it penetrates easily, they are done. Drain the salsify, and serve with a good white sauce or French melted butter. Time.—30 to 50 minutes. Seasonable in winter. Note.—This vegetable may be also boiled, sliced, and fried in batter of a nice brown. When crisp and a good colour, they should be served with fried parsloy in the centre of the dish, and a little fine salt sprinkled over the salsify. Salsify.—This esculent is, for the sake of its roots, cultivated in gardens. It belongs to the Composite class of flowers, which is the most extensive family in the vegetable kingdom. This family is not only one of the most natural and most uniform in structure, but there is also a great similarity existing in the properties of the plants of which it is composed. Generally speaking, all composite floNvers are tonic or stimulant in their medical virtues.590 MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. BOIIiED SEA-KALE. 1150. Ii^GREDiENTS.—-To each i gallon of water allow 1 heaped tablespoonful of salt. Mode.—Well wash the kale, cut away any wormeaten pieces, and tie it into small bunches; put it into boiling water, salted in the above proportion, and let it boil quickly until tender. Take it out, drain, untie the bunches, and serve with plain melted butter or white sauce, a little of which may be poured over the kale. Sea- kale may also be parboiled and stewed in good brown gravy : it will then take about | hour altogether. Time.—15 minutes; when liked very thoroughly done, allow an extra 5 minutes. Average cost, in full season, ^d. per basket. Sufficient.—Allow 12 heads for 4 or 5 persons. Seasonable from February to June. Sea-kale.—This plant belongs to the Asparagus tribe, and grows on seashores, especially in the West of England, and in the neighbourhood of Dubhn. Although it is now in very general use, it did not come into repute till 1794. It is easily cultivated, and is esteemed as one of the most valuable esculents indigenous to Britain. As a vegetable, it is stimulating to the appetite, easily digestible, and nutritious. It is so light that the most delicate organizations may readily eat it. The flowers form a favourite resort for bees, as their petals contain a great amount of saccharine matter. BOILED SALAD. 1151. Ingeedients.—2 heads of celery, 1 pint of French beans, lettuce, and endive. Ilode.—Boil the celery and beans separately until tender, and cut the celery into pieces about 2 inches long. Put these into a salad- rSENCH BEATTS.

This composition, if less agreeable than vegetables in their raw state, is more wholesome; for salads, however they may be compounded, when eaten uncooked, prove to some people indigestible. Tarragon, chervil, burnet, and boiled onion, may be added to the above salad with advantage, as also slices of cold meat, poultry, or fish. Seasonable from July to October. AcETARious Vegetables.—By the term Acetarious vegetables, is expressed a nume- rous class of plants, of various culture and habit, which are principally used as salads, pickles, and condiments. They are to be considered rather as articles of comparative luxury than as ordinary food, and are more desirable for their coolness, or their agree- able flavour, than for their nutritive powers. Cauliflower.—The cauliflower is less indigestible than the cabbage j it possesses a most agreeable flavour, and is sufliciently delicate to be served at the tables of the wealthy. It is a wholesome vegetable, but should be eaten moderately, as it induces flatulence. Persons of weak constitutions and dehcate stomachs should abstain from caviliflower as much as possible. They may be prepared in a variety of ways; and, ia selecting them, the whitest should be chosen; those tinged with green or yellow being of indiiiererit quahty. SIJMMEB BAIiAD. 1152. Ti5"GREDiENTS.—3 lettuccs, 2 handfuls of mustaid-and-cress, 10 young radishes, a few slices of cucumber. Mode.—Let the herbs be as fresh as possible for a salad, and, if at all stale or dead-looking, let them lie in water for an hour or two, which will very much refresh them. "Wash and carefully pick them over, remove any de- cayed or wormeaten leaves, and drain them thoroughly by swinging them gently in a clean cloth. With a silver knife, cut the lettuces into small pieces, and the radishes and cucum- bers into thin slices ; arrange all these ingre- salad m bowl. dients lightly on a dish, with the mustard- and-cress, and pour under, but not over the salad, either of the sauces No. 506, 507, or 508, and do not stir it up until it is to be eaten. It may be garnished with hard-boiled eggs, cut in slices, sliced cucumbers, nasturtiums, cut vegetable-flowers, and many other things that taste will always suggest to make a pretty and elegant dish. In making a good salad, care must be taken to have the herbs freshly gathered, and tlioroughlij drained before the sauce is added to them, or it will be watery and thin. Young spring onions, cut small, are by many persons considered an improvement to salads; but, before these are added, the cook should always consult the taste of her employer. Slices of cold meat or poultry added to a salad make a convenient and quickly-made summer luncheon-dish; or cold fish, flaked, will also be found exceedingly nice, mixed with it.592 MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. Average cost, 9d. for a salad for 5 or 6 persons; but more expensive when the herbs are forced. Sufficient for 5 or 6 persons. $0 Seasonable from May to Septem- ber. CTJCTJMBEB-SLICl. CuCTJMBEES.—The cucumber is refreshing, but neither nutritious nor digestible, and should be excluded from the regimen of the delicate. There are various modes of preparing cucum- bers. When gathered young, they are called gherkins: these, pickled, are much used in seasonings. Eadishes.—This is the common name given to the root of the Haphanus safivus, one of the varieties of the cultivated horseradish. There are red and white radishes ; and the French have also what they call violet and black ones, of which the black are the larger. Eadishes are composed of nearly the same constituents as turnips, that is to say, mostly fibre and nitrogen; and, being generally eaten raw, it is on the last of these that their flavour depends. They do not agree with people, except those who are in good health. and have active digestive powers; for they are difficult of digestion, and cause flatulency and wind, and are the cause of headaches when eaten to excess. Besides being eaten raw, they are sometimes, but rarely, boiled; and they also serve as a pretty garnish for salads. In China, the radish may be found growing naturally, without cultivation; and may be occasionally met with in England as a weed, in similar places to where the wild turnip grows ; it, however, thrives best in the garden, and the" ground it Ukes best is a deep open loam, or a well-manured sandy soil. WINTER SALAD. 1153. iNaEEDiENTS.—Endive, mustard-and-cress, boiled beetroot, I 3 or 4 hard-boiled eg-gs, celery* Mode.—The above ingredients form the principal constituents of a winter salad, and may be converted into a very pretty dish, by nicely contrasting the various colours, and by tastefully garnishing it. Shred the celery into thin pieces, after havings carefully washed and cut away all wormeaten pieces; cleanse the endive and mustard-and-cress free from grit, and arrange these high in the centre of a salad-bowl or dish; garnish with the hard-boiled eggs and beetroot, both of which should be cut in slices ; and pour into the dish, but not over the salad, either of the sauces No. 506, 507, or 508. Never dress a salad long before it is required for table, as, by standing, it loses its fresh- ness and pretty crisp and light appearance; the sauce, however, may TTBNIP EADISHES.

Sufficient for 5 or 6 persons. Seasonahle from the end of September to March. Sat-ads,—Salads are raw vegetables, of which, among us, the lettuce is the most generally used; several others, however, such as cresses, celery, onions, Leetvoot, &c., are occasionally employed. As vegetables eaten in a raw state are apt to ferment on the stomach, and as they have very little stimulative power uiDon that organ, they are usually dressed with some condiments, such as pepper, vinegar, salt, mustard, and oil. Eespecting the use of these, medical men disagree, especially in reference to oil, which is condemned by some and recommended by others. POTATO SALAD. 1154- Ingiiedients.—10 or 12 cold boiled potatoes, 4 tablespoonfuls of tarragon or plain vinegar, 6 tablespoonfuls of salad-oil, pepper and salt to taste, 1 teaspoonfui of minced parsley. Mode.—Cut the potatoes into slices about \ inch in thickness; put these into a salad-bowl with oil and vinegar in the above proportion ; season with pepper, salt, and a teaspoonfui of minced parsley; stir the salad well, that all the ingredients may. be thoroughly incorpo- rated, and it is ready to serve. This should be made two or three hours before it is wanted for table. Anchovies, olives, or pickles may be added to this salad, as also slices of cold beef, fowl, or turkey. Seasonahle at any time.

Put it into a very large saucepan, with about i pint of water, just sufficient to keep the spinach from burning, and the above proportion of salt. Press it down frequently with a wooden spoon, that it may be done equally; 2qMODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. 594 and when it has boiled for rather more than 10 minutes, or until it is perfectly tender, drain it in a colander, squeeze it quite dry, and chop it finely. Put the spinach into a clean stewpan, with the butter and a seasoning of pepper; stir the whole over the fire until quite hot; then put it on a hot dish, and garnish with sippets of toasted bread. Ti7ne.—10 to 15 minutes to boil the spinach, 5 minutes to warm with the butter. Average cost for the above quantity, Sd. Sufficient for 5 or 6 persons. Seasonable.—Spring spinach from March to July; winter spinach from November to March. J}^ote.—Grated nutmeg, pounded mace, or lemon-juice may also be added to enrich the flavour; and poached eggs are also frequently served with spinach: they should be placed on the top of it, and it should be garnished with sippets of toasted bread.—See coloured plate U. Varieties op Spinach.—These comprise the Strawberry spinach, which, under that name, was wont to be grown in our flower-gardens; the Good King Harry, the Garden Oracle, the Prickly, and the Eound, are the varieties commonly used. The Oracle is a hardy sort, much esteemed in France, and is a native of Tartary, introduced in 1518. The common spinach has its leaves round, and is softer and more succulent than any of the Brassica tribe. SPIHACH DBESSED WITH GEE AM, a la Francaise. 1156.

Tomatoes.—The Tomato is a native of tropical countries, but is now cultivated considerably both in France and England. Its skin is of a brilliant red, and its flavour, which is somewhat sour, has become of immense importance in the culinary art. It is used both fresh and preserved. When eaten fresh, it is served as an entremets; but its principal use is in s3uce and gravy; its flavour stimulates the appetite, and is almost universally approved. The Tomato is a w^holesome fruit, and digests easily. From July to September, they gather the tomatoes green in France, not breaking them away from the stalk; they are then hung, head downwards, in a dry and not too cold place and there they ripen.

' -i ^ times, and serve witn any kind 01 roast meat, v/ith which they will be found a delicious accompaniment. 2Vr/?e.—20 to 25 minutes. Average cost, in full season, ^d. per basket. Sufficient for 4 or 5 persons. Seasonable from August to October; but may be had, forced, much earlier. An-alysis op the Tomato.—The fruit of the love-apple is the only part used as an esculent, and it has been found to contain a particular acid, a volatile oil, a brown, very iVagrant extracto-resinous matter, a vegeto-mineral matter, muco-saccharine, some salts, and, in all probability, an alkaloid. The whole plant has a disagreeable odour, and its juice, subjected to the action of the fire, emits a vapour so powerful as to cause vertigo and vomiting. II. 1160. Ingeedients.—8 tomatoes, about i pint of good gravy, thickening of butter and flour, cayenne and salt to taste. Mode—TldikQ out the stalks of the tomatoes; put them into a wide stewpan, pour over them the above proportion of good brown gravy, and stew gently until they are tender, occasionally carefulhj turning them, that they may be equally done. Thicken the gravy with a littlo butter and flour worked together on a plate ; let it just boil up597 VEGETABLES. after the thickening is added, and serve. If it be at hand, these should be served on a silver or plated vegetable-dish. Time,—20 to 25 minutes, very gentle stewing. Average cost, in full season, 9c?. per basket. Sufficient for 4 or 5 persons. Seasonahle in August, September, and October; but may be had, forced, much earlier. The Tomato, on Love-apple.—This vegetable is a native of Mexico and South America, but is also found in the East Indies, where it is supposed to have been intro- duced by t :ic Spaniards. In this country it is much more cultivated than it formerly was ; and the more the community becomes acquainted with the many agreeable forma in which the fruit can be prepared, the more widely will its cultivation be extended. For Icetchup, soups, and sauces, it is equally applicable, and the unripe fruit makes one of the best pickles. TBUFFLES AU IsTATUIlEIi. ii6i. Ingeedients.—Truffles, buttered paper. 3Iode.—Select some fine truffles; cleanse them, by washing them in several waters with a brush, until not a particle of sand or grit remains on them; wrap each truffle in buttered paper, and bake in a hot oven for quite an hour; take off the paper, wipe the truffles, and serve them in a hot napkin. Ti?ne.—1 hour. A verage cost,—"Not often bought in this country. Seasonahle from November to March. The Common Teueele.—This is the Tuber ciharium of science, and belongs to that nume- rous class of esculent fungi distinguished from other vegetables not only by the singularity of their forms, but by their chemical composition. Upon analysis, they are found not only to contain the usual components of the vegetable kingdom, such as carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen, but like- l wise a large proportion of nitrogen; from which = they approach more nearly to the nature of ani- mal flesh. It was long ago observed by Dr. Dar- win, that all the mushrooms cooked at our tables, tkuefles. as well as those used for ketchup, possessed an . ' animal flavour; and soup enriched by mushrooms only has sometimes been supposed to contain meat. TO DBESS TBUPFLBS WITH CHAMPAGl^E. 1162. lNGEEDiENTS.—12fine black truffles, a few slices of fat bacon, 1 carrot, 1 turnip, 2 onions, a bunch of savoury herbs, including parsley, 1 bay-leaf, 2 cloves, 1 blade of pounded mace, 2 glasses of champagne, i pint of stock. iifoc^e.—Carefully select the truffles, reject those that have a musty I smell, and wash them well with a brush, in cold water only, until I perfectly clean. Put the bacon into a stewpan, with the truffles and ! the remaining ingredients; simmer these gently for an hour, and let 1 the whole cool in the stewpan. When to be served, rewarm them,598 MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. and drain tliem on a clean cloth; then arrange them on a delicately* white napkin, that it may contrast as strongly as possible with the truffles, and serve. The trimmings of truffles are used to flavour gravies, stock, sauces, &c.; and are an excellent addition to ragouts, made dishes of fowl, &c. Time.—1 hour. Average cost,—Not often bought in this country. Seasonable from November to March. The Teuffle.—The Truffle belongs to the family of the Mushroom. It is certain that the truffle must possess, equally with other plants, organs of reproduction; yet, notwithstanding all the efforts of art and science, it has been impossible to subject it to a regular culture. Truffles grow at a considerable depth under the earth, never appear- ing on the surface. They are found in many parts of France: those of Perigord and Magny are the most esteemed for their odou,r. There are three varieties of the species, —the black, the red, and the white: the latter are of little value. The red are very rare, and their use is restricted. The black has the highest repute, and its consumptiou is enormous. W^hen the peasantry go to gather truffles, they take a pig with them to scent out the spot where they grow. When that is found, the pig turns up the surface with his snout, and the men then dig until they find the truffles. Good truffles are easily distinguished by their agreeable perfume; they should be light in proportion to their size, and elastic when pressed by the finger. To have them in perfection, they should be quite fresh, as their aroma is considerably diminished by any conserving pro- cess. Truffles are stimulating and heating. Weak stomachs digest them with difficulty. Some of the culinary uses to which they are subjected render them more digestible; but they should always be eaten sparingly. Their chief use is in seasoning and garnitures. In short, a professor has said, " Meats with truffles are the most distinguished dishes that opulence can offer to the epicure." The Truffle grows in clusters, some inches below the surface of the soil, and is of an irregular globular form. Those which grow wild in England are about the size of a hen's egg, and have no roots. As there is nothing to indicate the places where they are, dogs have been trained to discriminate their scent, by which they are discovered. Hogs are very fond of them, and frequently lead to their being found, from their rutting up the ground in search of them, ITAIilAIT MODS OF DRESSma TBXJFFLES. 1163. Ingbedien^ts.—10 truffles, | pint of salad-oil, pepper and salt to taste, 1 tablespoonful of minced parsley, a very little flnely-mincej garlic, 2 blades of pounded mace, 1 tablespoonful of lemon-juice. Mode,—After cleansing and brushing the truffles, cut them into thin slices, and put them in a baking-dish, on a seasoning of oil, ' pepper, salt, parsley, garlic, and mace in the above proportion. Bake i them for nearly an hour, and, just before serving, add the lemon-juice* | and send them to table very hot. i JVme.—Nearly 1 hour. | Average cost—Eot often bought in this country. ffji Seasonable from ITovember to March. Where Truffles are found.—In this country, the common truffle is founcl on the downs of Hampshire, Wiltshire, and Kent; and they abound in dry light soils, and more i especially in oak and chestnut forests. In France they are plentiful, and many aw i imported from the south of that country and Italy, where they are much larger and m, i greater perfection: they lose, however, much of their flavour by drying. Truffles have i in England been tried to be propagated artificially, but without success. TRUFFLES A L'lTAIiIEITIsrE. 1164. iK'aEEDiEKTS.—10 truffles, 1 tablespoonful of minced parsley^ \ 1 minced shalot, -salt and pepper to taste, 2 oz. of butter, 2 tablft- !VEGETABLES. 599 spoonfuls of good brown gravy, tlie juice of ^ lemon, cayenne to taste. Mode,—Wash the trulHes and cut them into slices about the size of a penny-piece ; put them into a saute pan, with the parsley, shalot, salt, pepper, and 1 oz. of butter; stir them over the fire, that they may all be equally done, which will be in about 10 minutes, and drain of? some of the butter; then add a little more fresh butter, 2 table- gpoonfuls of good gravy, the juice of i lemon, and a little cayenne; stir over the fire until the whole is on the point of boiling, when serve. Ti77ie.—Altogether, 20 minutes. Average cost.—I^ot often bought in this country. Seasonable from November to March. Uses op the TEUFFLii:.—Like the Morel, trulHes are seldem eaten alone, but ard niiicliused in gravies,, soups, and ragouts. They are likewise dried for the winter months, and, when reduced to powder, form a useful culinary ingredient; they, however, have many virtues attributed to them which they do not possess. Their wholesomeness is, perhaps, questionable, and they should be eaten with moderation. ^BOILSD TUBHIPS. 1165. Ingeedients.—Turnips; to each i gallon of water allow 1 heaped tablespoonful of salt. 3£ode,—Pare the turnips, and, should they be very large, divide them into quarters; but, unless this is the case, let them be cooked whole. Put them into a saucepan of boiling water, salted in the above proportion, and let them boil gently until tender. Try them with a fork, and, when done, take them up in a colander ; let them thoroughly drain, and serve. Boiled turnips are usually sent to table with boiled mutton, but are infinitely nicer when mashed than served v^^hole: unless nice and young, they are scarcely worth the trouble of dressing plainly as above. Time.—Old turnips, % to H hour; young ones, about 18 to 20 minutes. Average cost^ id. per bunch. Sif^icient.—Allow a bunch of 12 turnips for 5 or 6 persons. Seasonable.—May be had all the year; but in spring only useful for flavouring gravies, &c. The Tuenip.—This vegetable is the Brcmica Bap'.i of science, and grows wild in England, but cannot be brought exactly to resemble what it becomes in a cultivated state. It is said to have been originally introduced from Hanover, and forms an excellent culinary vegetable, much used all over Europe, where it is either eaten alone or mashed and cooked in soups and stews. They do not thrive in a hot climate; for in India they, and many more of our garden vegetables, lose their flavom' and become comparatively^ tasteless. The Swede is the largest variety, but it is too coarse for the table.600 MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY, MASHED TUHlSriPS. 1166. iKaREDiENTS.—10 or 12 large turnips; to each f gallon of water allow 1 heaped tablespoonful of salt, 2 oz. of butter, cayenne or white pepper to taste. Mode.—Pare the turnips, quarter them, and put them into boiling water, salted in the above proportion; boil them until tender ; then drain them in a colander, and squeeze them as dry as possible by pressing them with the back of a large plate. When quite free from water, rub the turnips with a wooden spoon through the colander, and put them into a very clean saucepan; add the butter, white pepper, or cayenne, and, if necessary, a little salt. Keep stirring them over the fire until the butter is well mixed with them, and the turnips are thoroughly hot; dish, and serve. A little cream or milk added after the turnips are pressed through the colander, is an im- provement to both the colour and flavour of this vegetable. Time.—From k to f hour to boil the turnips; 10 minutes to warm them through. Average cost, 4(2. per bunch. Si'ficient for 4 or 5 persons. Seaso7iahle.—May be had all the year ; but in spring only good for flavouring gravies. Vegetables reduced to Puree.—Persons in the flower of youth, having healthy stomachs, and leading active lives, may eat all sorts of vegetables, without inconvenience, save, of course, in excess. The digestive functions possess great energy during the period of youth: the body, to develop itself, needs nourishment. Physical exercise gives an appetite, which it is necessary to satisfy, and vegetables cannot resist the vigorous action of the gastric organs. An old proverb says, At twenty one can digest iron." But for aged persons, the sedentary, or the delicate, it is quite otherwise. Then the gastric power has considerably diminished, the digestive organs have lost their energy, the process of digestion is consequently slower, and the least excess at table is followed by derangement of the stomach for several days. Those who generally digest vegetables with difficulty, should eat them reduced to a pulp or jpuree, that is to say, with their skins and tough fibres removed. Subjected to this process, vegetables which, when entire, would create flatulence and wind, are then comparatively harmless. Experience has established the rule, that nourishment is not complete without the alliance of meat with vegetables. We would also add, that the r(?gime most favourable to health is found in variety : variety pleases the senses, monotony is disagreeable. The eye is fatigued by looking always on cue object, the ear by listening to one sound, and the palate by tasting one flavour. It is the same with the stomach : consequently, variety of food is one of the essentials for securing good digestion. GEBMAIQ- MODS OF COOKma TUBITIPS. 1167. IiTGKEDiENTS.—8 large tiiraips, 3 oz. of butter, pepper and salt to taste, rather more than i pint of weak stock or broth, 1 table- spoonful of flour. Ifode.—Make the butter hot in a stewpan, lay in the turnips, after having pared and cut them into dice, and season them with pepper and salt. Toss them over the fire for a few minutes, then add the broth, and simmer the whole gently till the turnips are tender. BrownTEGETABLES. 601 the above proportion of flour with a little butter; add this to the turnips, let them simmer another 5 minutes, and serve. Boiled mut- ton is usually sent to table with this vegetable, and may be cooked with the turnips by placing it in the midst of them: the meat would then be very delicious, as, there being so little liquid with the turnips, it would almost be steamed, and consequently very tender. I'iine.—20 minutes. Average cost, 4f/. per bunch. Sufficient for 4 persons. Seaso7iahle,—May be had all the year. Turnips.—G-ood turnips are delicate in texture, firm, aud sweet. The best sorts con- tain a sweet juicy mucilage, uniting with the aroma a slightly acid qiiality, which is completely neutralized in cooking. The turnip is prepared in a variety of ways. Ducks stufled with turnips have been highly appreciated. It is useful in the regimen of persons afflicted with chronic visceral irritations. The turnip only creates flatulency when it is soft, porous, and stringy. It is then, consequently, bad. TUBNIPS IN WHITE SAUCE. (An Entremets, or to be served with, the Second Course as a Side-dish.) 1168. Ingeedients.—7 or 8 turnips, 1 oz. of butter, I pint of white sauce, No. 538 or 539. Mode.—Peel and cut the turnips in the shape of pears or marbles ; boil them in salt and water, to which has been added a little butter, until tender; then take them out, drain, arrange them on a dish, and pour over the white sauce made by recipe No. 538 or 539, and to which has been added a small lump of sugar. In winter, when other vegetables are scarce, this will be found a very good and pretty-looking dish: when approved, a little mustard may be added to the sauce. Time.—About f hour to boil the turnips. Average cost^ 4.d. per bunch. Sufficient for 1 side-dish. Seasonable in winter. The Fbexch Navet.—This is a variety of the turnip ; but, instead of being globular, has more the shape of the carrot. Its flavour being excellent, it is much esteemed on the Continent for soups and made dishes. Two or three of them Avill impart as much flavour as a dozen of the common turnips will. Accordingly, when stewed in gravy, tlicy are greatly relished. This flavour resides in the rind, which is not cut off, but scraped. This variety was once grown in England, but now it is rarely found in our gardens, though highly deserving of a place there. It is of a yellowish-white colour, and is some- times imported to the London market, BOILED TURNIP GREEISTS. 1169. iNaEEDiENTS.—To cach i gallon of water, allow 1 heaped tablespoonful of salt; turnip-greens. J/of7e.—Wash the greens well in two or three waters, and pick off all the decayed and dead leaves ; tie them in small bunches, and put them into plenty of boiling water, salted in the above proportion. Keep them boiling quickly, with the lid of the saucepan uncovered,602 MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. and when tender, pour them into a colander ; let them drain, arrange them in a vegetable-dish, removfe the string that the greens were tied with, and serve. Time.—15 to 20 minutes. Average cost, id. for a dish for 3 persons. Seasonable in March, April, and May. Cabbage, Tubttip-tops, and G-eeens.—All the cabbage tribe, which, comprises cole- worts, brocoli, cauliflower, sprouts, and turnip-tops, in order to be delicate, should be dressed young, when they have a rapid growth; but, if they have stood the summer, in order to be tender, they should be allowed to have a touch of frost. The cabbage contains much vegetable albumen, and several parts sulphur and nitrate of potass. Cabbage is heavy, and a long time digesting, which has led to a belief that it is very nourishing. It is only fit food for robust and active persons; the sedentary or delicate should carefully avoid it. Cabbage may be prepared in a variety of ways : it serves as a garniture to several recherche dishes,—partridge and cabbage for example. Bacon and cabbage is a very favourite dish; but only a good stomach can digest it. BOILED VEGETABLE MABBOW. 1170. Ii^^GEEDiENTS.—To each i gallon of water, allow 1 heaped tahiespoonful of salt; vegetable marrows. 3fode.—Have ready a saucepan of boiling water, salted in the above proportion; put in the marrows after peeling them, and boil them until quite tender. Take them up with a slice, halve, and, should they be very large, quarter ETABLE MAKKow thcm. Dlsh thcm on toast, and send to table ' o2f TOAST. with them a tureen of melted butter, or, in lieu of this, a small pat of salt butter. Large vegetable marrows may be preserved throughout the winter by storing them in a dry place ; when wanted for use, a few slices should be cut and boiled in the same manner as above; but, when once begun, the marrow must be eaten quickly, as it keeps but a short time after it is cut. Vegetable marrows are also very delicious mashed: they should be boiled, then drained, and mashed smoothly with a wooden spoon. Heat them in a saucepan, add a seasoning of salt and pepper, and a small piece of butter, and dish with a few sippets of toasted bread placed round as a garnish. Time.—Young vegetable marrows 10 to 20 minutes ; old ones, k to I hour. Average cost, in full season. Is. per dozen. Siificient,—Miow 1 moderate-sized marrow for each person. Seasonable in July, August, and September; but may be preserved all the winter. FBIED VEGETABLE MABBOViT. 1171. Iis'GEEDiENTS.—3 medium-sized vegetable marrows, egg and bread crumbs, hot lard. iJf oc?e.—Peel, and boil the marrows until tender in salt and water; then drain them and cut them in quarters, and take out the seeds.VEGETABLES. 603 When thoroughly drained, brush the marrows over with egg, and sprinkle with bread crumbs; have ready some hot lard, fry the marrow in this, and, when of a nice brown, dish ; sprinkle over a little salt and pepper, and serve. Time.—About h hour to boil the marrow, 7 minutes to fry it. Average cost, in full season, Is. per dozen. Sufficient for 4 persons. Seasonable in July, August, and September. The Vegetable Makeow.—This vegetable is now exten- sively used, and belongs to the Cucurbits. It is the C. ovifera of science, and, like the melon, gourd, cucumber, and squash, is widely diffused in the tropical or warmer regions of the globe. Of the nature of this family v/e have already spoken when treating of the cucumber. vegetable maeeovv. CUT VEGETABLES FOB SOUPS, &c. 1172. The annexed engraving represents a cutter for shaping vege- tables for soups, ragouts, stews, &c.; carrots and turnips being the usual vegetables for which this utensil is used. Cut the vegetables into slices about i inch in thickness, stamp them out with the cutter, and boil them for a few minutes in salt and water, until tender. Turnips should be cut in rather thicker slices than carrots, on account of the former boiling more quickly to a pulp than the latter. Caekots.—Several species of carrots are cultivated,—the red, the yellow, and the which. Those known as the Crecy carrots are considered the best, and are very sweet. Tha carrot has been classed by hygienists among flatulent vegetables, and as difficult of digestion. When the root becomes old, it is almost as hard as wood; but the young carrot, which has not reached its full growth, is tender, relishing, nutritiousj and digests well when properly cooked.

BOILED INDIAIT WHEAT or MAIZS. 1174. IiTGEEDiENTS.—The ears of young and green Indian wheat; to every h gallon of water allow 1 heaped tablespoonful of salt. 3Iode.—This vegetable, which makes one of the most delicious dishes brought to table, is unfortunately very rarely seen in Britain; and we wonder that, in the gardens of the wealthy, it is not invariably cultivated. Our sun, it is true, possesses hardly power sufficient to ripen maize; but, with well-prepared ground, and in a favourable position, it might be sufficiently advanced by the beginning of autumn to serve as a vegetable. The outside sheath being taken off and the waving fibres removed, let the ears be placed in boiling water, where they should remain for about 25 minutes (a longer time may be necessary for larger ears than ordinary) ; and, when sufficiently boiled and well drained, they may be sent to table whole, and with a piece of toast underneath them. Melted butter should be served with them. Time.—25 to 35 minutes. Average cos^.—Seldom bought. Sufficient,—1 ear for each person. Seasonahle in autumn. Note.—William Cobbett, the English radical writer and politician^ v/as a great cultivator and admirer of maize, and constantly ate it as a vegetable, boiled. We believe he printed a special i^cipe for it, but we have been unable to lay our hands on it. Mr. Buchanan, the present president of the United States, was in the habit, when ambassador here, of receiving a supply of Indian corn from America in hermetically-sealed cases ; and the publisher of this work remembers, with considerable satisfaction, his introduction to a dish of this vegetable, when in America. He found it to combine the excellences of the young green pea and the finest aspai'agus ; but he felt at first slightly awkward in holding the large ear with one hand, whilst the other had to be 'employed in cutting off" with a knife the delicate green grains.CHAPTER XXYL GENEBAIi OBSBBVATIONS OK PUDDINGS AND PASTBY. 1175. Puddings and Pastry, familiar as they may be, and unimportant as they may be held in the estimation of some, are yet intimately connected with the development of agricultm-al resources in reference to the cereal grasses. When they began to be made is uncertain ; but we may safely presume, that a simple form of pudding was amongst the first dishes made after discovering a mode of grinding wheat into flour. Traditional history enables us to trace man back to the time of the Deluge. After that event he seems to have recovered himself in the central parts of Asia, and to have first risen to eminence in the arts of civilization on the banks of the Nile. From this region, Greece, Carthage, and some other parts along the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, were colonized. In process of time, Greece gave to the Romans the arts which she had thus received from Egypt, and these subsequently diffused them over Europe. How these were carried to or developed in India and China, is not so well ascertained ; and in America their ancient existence rests only on I very indistinct traditions. As to who was the real discoverer of the use of corn, we have no authentic knowledge. The traditions of different countries I ascribe it to various fabulous personages, whose names it is here unnecessary i to introduce. In Egypt, however, corn must have grown abundantly; for I Abraham, and after him Jacob, had recourse to that country for supplies during times of famine.606 MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. 1176. The Habits of a People, to a great extent, are formed by the climate in which they live, and by the native or cultivated productions in which their country abounds. Thus we find that the agricultural produce of the ancient Egyptians is pretty much the same as that of the present day, and the habits of the peoiDle are not materially altered. In Greece, the products cultivated in antiquity were the same kinds of grains and legumes as are cultivated at present, with the vine, the fig, the olive, the apple, and other fruits. So with the Komans, and so with other nations. As to the different modes of artificially preparing these to please the "taste, it is only necessary to say that they arise from the universal desire of novelty, charac- teristic of man in the development ol his social conditions. Thus has arisen the whole science of cookery, and thus arose the art of making puddings. The porridge of the Scotch is nothing more than a siDccies of hasty pudding, composed of oatmeal, salt, and water ; and the '' red pottage " for which Esau sold his birthright, must have been something similar. The "barley-gruel of the Lacedaemonians, of the Athenian gladiators and common people, \^as the same, wit'h the exception of the slight seasoning it had beyond the simplicity of Scottish fare. Here is the ancient recipe for the Athenian national dish Dry near the fire, in the oven, twenty pounds of barley-flour; then parch it; add three pounds of linseed-meal, half a pound of coriander-seed, two ounces of salt, and the quantity of water necessary." To this sometimes a little millet was added, in order to give the paste greater cohesion and delicacy. 1177. Oatmeal AMONGST the Greeks and Eomans was highly esteemed, as was also rice, which they considered as beneficial to the chest. They also held in high repute the Irion, or Indian wheat of the moderns. The flour of this cereal was made into a kind of hasty pudding, and, parched or roasted, was eaten with a little salt. The Spelt, or Ked wheat, was likewise esteemed, and its flour formed the basis of the Carthaginian pudding, for which we here give the scientific recipe :—"Put a pound of red-wheat flour into water, and when it has steeped some time, transfer it to a wooden bowl. Add three pounds of cream cheese, half a pound of honey, and one egg. Beat the whole together, and cook it on a slow fire in a stewpan." Should this be considered unpalatable, another form has been recommended. *'Sift the flour, and, with some water, l^ut it into a wooden vessel, and, for ten days, renew the water twice eaoh day. At the end of that period, press out the water and place the paste in another vessel. It is now to be reduced to the consistence of thick lees, and passed through a piece of new linen. Eepeat this last operation, then dry the mass in the sun and boil it in milk. Season according to taste." These are specimens of the puddings 01 antiquity, and this last recipe vras held in especial favour by the Romans. 1178. However great may have been the qualifications of the ancients, however, in the art of pudding-making, we apprehend that such preparations as gave gratification to their palates, would have genertiUy foimdPUDDINGS AND PASTRY. little favour amongst the insvilated inhabitants of Great Britain. Here, from the simple suet dumpling up to the most complicated Christmas production, the grand feature of substantiality is primarily attended to. Variety in the ingredients,, we think, is held only of secondary consideration with the great body of the people, provided that the whole is agreeable and of sufficient abundance. 1179. Although from Puddings to Pastry is but a step, it requires a higher degree of art to make the one than to make the other. Indeed, pastry is one of the most important branches of the culinary science. It unceasingly occupies itself with ministering pleasure to the sight as well as to the taste; with erecting graceful monuments, miniature fortresses, and all kinds of architectural imitations, composed of the sweetest and most agreeable products of all climates and countries. At a very early period, the Orientals were acquainted with the art of manipulating in pastry; but they by no means attained to the taste, variety, and splendour of design, by which it is characterized amongst the moderns. At first it generally consisted of certain mixtures of flour, oil, and honey, to which it was confined for centuries, even among the southern nations of the European continent. At the com- mencement of the middle ages, a change began to take place in the art of mixing it. Eggs, butter, and salt came into repute in the making of paste, which was forthwith used as an inclosure for meat, seasoned with spices. This advance attained, the next step was to inclose cream, fruit, and mar- malades ; and the next, to build pyramids and castles; when the summit of the I art of the pastry-cook may be su^Dposed to have been achieved. I DIRECTIONS IN CONNECTION Y7ITH THE MAKING OF PUDDINGS AND PASTRY. 1180. A few general remarks respecting the various ingredients of Y/liich puddings and pastry are composed, may be acceptable as preliminary to tlie recipes in this department of Household Management. I 1181. Flour should be of the best quality, and perfectly dry, and I sifted before being used; if in the least damp, the paste made from I it -will certainly be heavy. 1 1182. Butter, unless fresh is used, should be washed from the salt, land well squeezed and wrung in a cloth, to get out all the water and buttermilk, which, if left in, assists to make the paste heavy. IMODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. 608 1183. Lard should be perfectly sweet, which may be ascertained by cutting the bladder through, and, if the knife smells sweet, the lard is good. 1184. Stiet should be finely chopped, perfectly free from sldn, and quite sweet; during the process of chopping, it should be lightly dredged with flour, which prevents the pieces from sticking together. Beef suet is considered the best; but veal suet, or the outside fat of a loin or neck of mutton, makes good crusts; as also the skimmings in which a joint of mutton has been boiled, but without vegetables. 1185. Clarified Beef Dripping^ directions for which will be found in recipes Nos. 621 and 622, answers very well for kitchen pies, puddings, cakes, or for family use. A very good short crust may be made by mixing with it a small quantity of moist sugar; but care must be taken to use the dripping sparingly, or a very disagreeable flavour will be imparted to the paste. 1186. Strict cleanliness must be observed in pastry-making; all the utensils used should be perfectly free from dust and dirt, and the things re- quired for pastry, kept entirely for that purpose. 1187. In mixing paste, add the water very gradually, work the whole together with the knife-blade, and knead it until perfectly smooth. Those who are inexpe- rienced in pastry-making, should work the butter in by breaking it in small I pieces and covering the paste rolled out.

Should there be a bad one amongst them, it can be thrown away; whereas, if mixed with the good ones, the entire quantity would be spoiled. The yolks and whites beaten separately make the articles they are put into much lighter. 1194. Raisins and dried fruits for puddings should be carefully picked, and, in many cases, stoned. Currants should be well washed, pressed in a cloth, and placed on a dish before the fire to get thoroughly dry; they should then be picked carefully over, and euery piece of giit or stone removed from ainongst them. To plump them, some cooks pour boiling water over them, and then dry them before the fire. 1195. Batter pudding should be smoothly mixed and free from lumps. To insure this, first mix the flour with a very small proportion of milk, and add the remainder by degrees. Should the pudding be very lumpy, it may be strained through a hair sieve. 1196. All toiled puddings should be put on in boiling loater^ which must not be allowed to stop simmering, and the pudding must always be covered with the water; if requisite, the saucepan should be kept filled up. 1197.

Scrupulous attention should be paid to the cleanliness of pudding-cloths, as, from neglect in this particular, the outsides of boiled puddings frequently taste very dis- agreeably. As soon as possible after it is taken off the pudding, it should be soaked in water, and then well washed, without soap, unless it be very greasy. It should be dried out of doors, then folded up and kept in a dry place. "When wanted for use, dip it in boiling water, and dredge it slightly with flour. 1201. The dry ingredients for puddings are better for being mixed some time before they are wanted; the liquid portion should only be added just before the pudding is put into the saucepan. 1202. A pinch of salt is an improvement to the generality of puddings; but this ingredient should be added very sparingly, as the flavour should not be detected. 1203. When baked puddings are sufficiently solid, turn them out of the dish they were baked in, bottom uppermost, and strew over them fine sifted sugar. 1204.

CHAPTER XXVII. VEBY GOOD PUPF-PASTE. 1^05. Ikgeedieistts.—To every lb. of flour allow 1 lb. of butter, and not quite J pint of water. 3iode.—Carefully weigh the flour and butter, and have the exact proportion; squeeze the butter well, to extract the water from it, and afterwards wring it in a clean cloth, that no moisture may remain. Sift the flour; see that it is perfectly dry, and proceed in the following manner to make the paste, using a very clean paste- hoard and rolling-pin :~Siipposing the quantity to be 1 lb. of flour, work the whole into a smooth paste, with not quite J pint of water, using a knife to mis it with: the proportion of this latter ingredient must be regulated by the discretion of the cook; if too much be added, the paste, when baked, will be tough. Eoll it out until it is of an equal thickness of about an inch; break 4 oz. of the butter into small pieces; place these on the paste, sift over it a little flour, fold it over, roll out again, and put another 4 oz. of butter. Repeat the rolling and buttering until the paste has been rolled out 4 times, or equal quan- tities of flour and butter have been used. Do not omit, every time the paste is rolled out, to dredge a little flour over that and the rolling-pin, to prevent both from sticking. Handle the paste as lightly as possible, and do not press heavily upon it with the rolling-pin. The next thing to be considered is the oven, as the baking of pastry requires particular attention. Do not put it into the oven until it is sufflciently hot to raise the paste ; for the best-prepared paste, if not properly baked, will be good for nothing. Brushing the paste as often as rolled out, and the pieces of butter placed thereon, with the white of an egg, assists it to rise in leaves or flahes. As this is the great beauty of puft-paste, it is as well to try this method. Average cost^ Is. 4.d. per lb. Butter.—About the secoud century of tlie Christian era, butter was placed by Galen amongst the useful medical agents; and about a century before him, Dioscorides men- tioned that he had noticed that fresh butter, made of ewes' and goats' milk, was served at meals instead of oil, and that it took the place of fat in makiug pastry. Thus we have undoubted authority that, eighteen hundred years ago, there existed a knowledge of thePUDDINGS AND PASTRY. 613 useful qualities of butter. The Eomans seem to have set about making it much as we do; for Pliuy tells us, " Butter is made from milk; and the use of this alinieut, so much sought after by barbarous nations, distinguished the rich from the common people. It is obtained princixjally from cows' milk; that from ewes is the fattest; goats also supply some. It is produced by agitating the milk in long vessels with narroAY openings: a little water is added." MEDIUM PUFF-PASTE. 1200. Ingeedieitts.—To every lb. of flour allow 8 oz. of butter, 4 oz. of lard, not quite ^ pint of water. 3Iocle.—This paste may be made by the directions in the preceding recipe, only using less butter and substituting lard for a portion of it. Mix the flour to a smooth paste with not quite J pint of water; then roll it out 3 times, the first time covering the paste with butter, the second with lard, and the third with butter. Keep the rolling-pin and paste slightly dredged with flour, to prevent them from sticking, and it will be ready for use. Average cost. Is. per lb. BuTTEE iif Haste.-—In his " History of Food," Soyer says that to obtain butter instantly, it is only necessary, in summer, to put new milk into a bottle, some hours after it has been taken from the cow, and shake it briskly. The clots which are thus formed should be thrown into a sieve, v,'ashed and pressed together, and they constitute the finest and most delicate butter that can possibly be made.

To KEEP Butter Fbesh.—One of the best means to preserve butter fresh is, first to completely press out all the buttermilk, then to keep it under water, renewing the water frequently, and to remove it from the influence of heat and air, by wrapping it in a wet cloth.

Presuming that the butter is perfectly free from moisture, and as cool as possible, roll it into a ball, and place this ball of butter on the paste ; fold the paste over the butter all round, and secure it by wrapping it well all over. Platten the paste by rolling it lightly with the rolling-pin until it is quite thin, but not thin enough to allow the butter to break through, and keep the board and paste dredged lightly with flour during the process of making it. This rolling gives it the first turn. Now fold the paste in three, and roll out again, and, should the weather be very warm, put it in a cold place on the ground to cool between the several turns; for, unless this is particularly attended to, the paste will be spoiled. Eoll out the paste again twice, put it by to cool, then roll it out twice more, which will make 6 turnings in all. JS'ow fold the paste in two, and it will be ready for use. If properly baked and well made, this crust will be delicious, and should rise in the oven about 5 or 6 inches. The paste should be made rather firm in the first instance, as the ball of butter is liable to break through. Great attention must also be paid to keeping the butter very cool, as, if this is in a liquid and soft state, the paste will not answer at all. Should the cook be dexterous enough to succeed in making this, the paste will have a much better appearance than that made by the process of dividing the butter into 4 parts, and placing it over the rolled-out paste; but, until experience has been acquired, we recommend puff-paste made by recipe No. 1205. The above paste is used for vols-au-vent, small articles of pastry, and, in fact, everything that requires very light crusts Average cost, Is. Qd. per lb. What to do with Kah'CID Buttek.—When butter hag become very rancid, it should be melted several times by a moderate heat, with or without the addition of water, and as soon as it has been well kneaded, after the cooling, in order to extract any water it may have retained, it should be put into brown freestone pots, sheltered from the contact of the air. The French often add to it, after it has been melted, a piece of toasted bread, which helps to destroy the tendency of the butter to rancidity. SOYEB'S BEOIPE FOR PUPF-PASTE. 1209.

The proportion of the latter ingredient must be judged of Fy the size of the eggs: if these are large, so much will not be required, and more if the eggs are smaller. Average cost, Is. per lb. Sugar and Beetboot.—There are two sorts of Beet,—white and red; occasionally, in the southj a yellow variety is met with. Beetroot contains twenty parts sugar. Everybody knows that the beet has competed with the sugar-cane, and a great part of the French su gar is manufactured from beet. Beetroot has a refreshing, composing, and slightly pur- gative quality. The youngleaves, when cooked, are a substitute for spinach; they are also useful for mixing with sorrel, to lessen its acidity. The large ribs of the leaves are ser- viceable in various culinary preparations; the root also may be prepared in several ways, but its most general use is in salad. Some writers upon the subject have expressed their opinion that beetroot is easUy digested, but those who have taken pains to carefully analyze its qualities make quite a contrary statem-cnt. Youth, of course, can digest it; but to persons of a certain age beet is very indigestible, or rather, it does not digest at all. It is not the sugary pulp which is indigestible, but its fibrous network that resists the action of the gastric organs. Thus, when the root is reduced to a puree, almost any person may eat it. Feench Sugar.—It had long been thought that tropical heat was not necessary to form sugar, and, about 1740, it was discovered that many plants of the temperate zone, and amongst others the beet, contained it. Towards the beginning of the 19th century, circumstances having, in France, made sugar scarce, and consequently dear, the govern-MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. €16 ment caused inquiries to be instituted as to the possibility of finding a substitute for it. Accordinglj, it was ascertained tliat sugar exists in the whole vegetable kingdom; that it is to be found in the grape, chestnut, potato; but that, far above all, the beet contains ifc in a large proportion. Thus the beet became an object of the most careful culture; find many experiments went to prove that in this respect the old world Avas independent of the new. Many manufactories came into existence in all parts of France, and the makiug of sugar became naturalized in that country. COMMON- SHORT CBUST. 1212.

The purity of the water was a great object of the care of the ancients; and we learn that the Athenians appointed four officers to keep watch and ward over the water in their city. These niea had to keep the fountains in order and clean the reservoirs, so that the Vr'ater might be preserved pure and limpid. Like oilicers Avere appointed in other Greek cities.

This crust is quite rich enough for ordinary purposes, but when a better one is desired, use from J to f lb. of suet to every lb. of flour. Some cooks, for rich crusts, pound the suet in a mortar, with a small quantity of butter. It should then be laid on the paste in small pieces, the same as for pufl'-crust, and will be found exceedingly nice for hot tarts. 5 oz. of suet to every lb. of flour v/ill make a very good crust; and even ^ lb. will answer very well for children, or vrhere the crust is wanted very plain.

Water Supply ijt Rome.—ISTothing in Italy is more extraordinary than the remains of the ancient aqueducts. At first, the Eomans were contented with the water from the Tiber. Ancus Martins v/as the first to commence the building of aqueducts destined to convey the water of the fountain of Piconia from Tibur to Rome, a distance of some 33,000 paces. Appius Claudius continued the good v/ork, and to him is due the com- pletion of the celebrated Appian Way. In time, the gigantic v/aterways greatly multi- plied, and, by the reign of Nero, there were constructed nine principal aqueducts, the pipes of which were of bricks, baked tiles, stone, lead, or wood. According to the calcu- lation of Vigenerus, half a million hogsheads of water were conveyed into Rome every day, by upwards of 10,000 small pipes not one-third of an inch in diameter. The water was received in large closed basins, above w^hich rose splendid monuments : these basinsMODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. €18 supplied other subterranean conduits, connected with various quarters of the city, and these conveyed water to small reservoirs furnished with taps for the exclusive use of certain streets. The water which was not drinkable ran out, by means of large pipes, into extensive inclosures, where it served to water cattle. At these places the people washed their linen; and here, too, was a supply of the necessary element in case of fire. COMMOlsr CEUST FOR BAISED PIES. 1217.

Vegetable caseine has also the composition of animal caseine. The finest wheat flour contains more starch than the coarser; the bran of wheat is proportionably richer in gluten. Eye and rye-bread contain a substance resembling starch-gum (or dextrine, as it is called) in its properties, which is very easily converted into sugar. The starch of barley approaches in many pro- perties to cellulose, and is, therefore, less digestible. Oats are particularly rich in plastic substances; Scotch oats are richer than those grown in England'or in Germany. This kind of grain contains in its ashes, after deduction of the silica of the busts, very nearly the same ingredients as are found in the ashes of the juice of flesh. Fine American flour is one of the varieties which is richest in gluten, and is consequently one of the most nutritious. ALMOHD CHEESECAKES. 1219.

They are distinguished into Sweet and Bitter, the produce of different varieties. Of the sweet, there are two varieties, distinguished in commerce by the names of Jordan and Valentia almonds. The former are imported from Malaga, and are longer, narrower, more pointed, and more highly esteemed than the latter, which are imported from Valentia. Bitter almonds are principally obtained from Morocco, and are exported from Mogador. almond AND BLOSSOai. ALMOND PASTE, for Second-Course Dishes. 1220.

"When well pounded, put them into a small preserving-pan, add the sugar, and place the pan on a small but clear fire (a hot-plate is better); keep stirring until the paste is dry, then take it out of the pan, put it between two dishes, and, when cold, make it into any shape that fancy may dictate. Time.~i hour. Average cost, 2s. for the above quantity. Sufficient for 3 small dishes of pastry. Seasonable at any time. Bitter Almonds.—The Bitter Almond is a variety of the common almond, and is injurious to animal life, on account of the great quantity of hydrocyanic acid it contains, and is consequently seldom used in domestic economy, unless it be to give flavour to confectionery; and even then it should be used with great caution. A single drop of the essential oil of bitter almonds is sufficient to destroy a bird, and four drops have caused the death of a middle-sized dog. I BAKED ALMOND PUDDING. (Very rich.) 1221.

Uses of the Sweet Almond.—The kernels of the sweet almond are used either in a green or ripe state, and as an article in the dessert. Into cookery, confectionery, per- lumery, and medicine, they largely enter, and in domestic economy, shonld always be , used in preference to bitter almonds. The reason for advising this, is because the t kernels do not contain any hydrocyanic or prussic acid, although it is found in the leaves, ,: flowers, and bark of the tree. When young and green, they are preserved in sugar, like k green apricots. They furnish the almond-oil; and the farinaceous matter which is left :' after the oil is expressed, forms the pate d'amancles of pei'fumers. In the arts, the oil i is employed for the same purposes as the olive-oil, and forms the basis of kalydor, ? macassar oil, Gowland's lotion, and many other articles of that kind vended by per- • fumers. In medicine, it is considered a nutritive, laxative, and an emollient. ! SMALL ALMOHD PUDDINGS. 1222.

It is said that in some parts of the south of France, where they are extensively grown, horses and mules are fed on the green and dry husks ; but, to prevent any evil consequences arising i| from this practice, they are mixed with chopped straw or oats. \ ALMOJKTD PUFFS. 3223.

"When flat- tened in the form of round cakes, and baked in ovens, they are called beefings ; and large quantities are annually dried in the sun in America, as well as in Normandy, and stored for use during winter, when they may be stewed or made into pies. In a roasted state they are remarkably wholesome, and, it is said, strengthening to a weak stomach. In putrid and malignant fevers, when used with the juice of lemons and currants, they are considered highly efficacious. APPLE CHEESECAKES. 1226.

In most temperate climates it is very extensively cultivated, and in England, both as regards variety and quantity, it is excellent and abundant. Immense supplies are also imported from the United States and from France.

It takes its name from Lamaes abJial, wMch, in ancient British, signifies the day of apple fruit, from being drunk on the apple feast in autumn. In France, a beverage, called by the Parisians raisinee, is made by boihug any given quantity of new wine, skimming it as often as fresh scum rises, and, when it is boiled to half its bulk, straining it. To this apples, pared and cut into quarters, are added; the whole is then allowed to simmer gently, stirring it aU the time with a long wooden spoon, till the apples are thoroughly mixed with the liquor, and the whole forms a species of marmalade, which is extremely agreeable to the taste, having a slight flavour of acidity, like lemon mixed with honey.

J/of?5.—Make a butter-crust by recipe No. 1213, or a suet one by recipe No. 1215, using for a moderate-sized pudding from f to 1 lb. of Hour, with the other ingredients in proportion. Butter a basin; line it with some of the paste ; pare, core, and cut the apples into slices, and fill the basin with these; add the sugar, the lemon-peel and juice, and cover with crust; pinch the edges together, flour the cloth, place it over the pudding, tie it securely, and put it into plenty of fast-boiling water. Let it boil from 1^ to 2^ hours, according to the size; then turn it out of the basin and send to table quickly. Apple puddings may also be boiled in a cloth without a basin; but, when made in this way, must be served without the least delay, as the crust so soon becomes heavy. Apple pudding is a very convenient dish to have when the dinner-hour is rather uncertain, as it does not spoil by being boiled an extra hour;' care, however, must be taken to keep it well covered v/ith the water all the time, and not to allow it to stop boiling. Time.—From li to 2| hours, according to the size of the pudding and the quality of the apples. Average cost, lOd. Sufficient, made with 1 lb. of flour, for 7 or 8 persons.

Put the pie back into the oven, and finish baking, and be particularly careful that it does not catch or burn, v/hich it is very liable to do after the crust is iced. If made with a plain crust, the icing may be omitted. Time.—\ hour before tl^e crust is iced; 10 to 15 minutes afterwards. Average cost^ ^d, ^ufftcient.—Allow 2 lbs. of apples for a tart for 6 persons. Seasonable from August to March; but the apples become flavour- less after February. Note.—Manj^ things are suggested for the flavouring of apple pie; some say 2 or 3 tablespoonfuls of beer, others the same quantity of sherry, which very much improve the taste; whilst the old-fashioned addition of a few cloves is, by many persons, preferred to anything else, as also a few slices of quince. Quinces.—The environs of Corinth originally produced the most beautiful quinces, but the plant was subsequently introduced into Gaul with the most perfect success. The ancients preserved the fruit by placing it, with its branches and leaves, in a vessel tilled with honey or sweet wine, which was reduced to half the quantity by ebullition. Quinces may be profitably cultivated in this country as a variety with other fruit-trees, and may be planted in espaliers or as standards. A very fine-flavoured marmalade may be prepared from quinces, and a small por- tion of quince in apple pie much improves its flavour. The French use quinces for flavouring many sauces. This fruit has the remarkable peculiarity of exhaling an agreeable odour, taken singly; but when in any quantity, or when they are stowed away in a drawer or close room, the pleasant aroma becomes an intolerable stench, although the fruit may be perfectly sound; it is therefore desirable that, as but a few quinces'^ are required for keeping, they should be kept in a high and dry loft, and out of the vvay of the rooms used by the family.

The skin of this fruit has a perfumed flavour, liighly esteemed. A good apricot, when perfectly ripe, is an excellent fruit. It has been somewhat condemned for its laxative qualities, but this has possibly arisen from the fruit having been eaten unripe, or in too great excess. Delicate persons should not eat the apricot uncooked, without a liberal allovvauca of powdered sugar. The apricot makes excellent jam and marmalade, and there aro several foreign preparations of it which are considered great luxuries. 3AKBD OB BOILED ABROWBOOT PUDDmG. 1240.

Time.—Baked batter pudding, with fruit, l\ to li hour; boiled ditto, li to 1| hour, allowing that both are made with the above proportion of batter. Smaller puddings will be done enough in f or 1 hour. Average cost, lOch Sufficient for 7 or 8 persons. Scasonahle at any time, with dried fruits. BOILED BATTER PUDDING. 1248. In-geediekts.—3 eggs, 1 oz. of butter, 1 pint of milk, Stable- spoonfuls of flour, a little salt. Mode.—Put the flour into a basin, and add sufficient milk to moisten it; carefully rub down all the lumps with a spoon, then pour in the remainder of the milk, and stir in the butter, which should be pre- viously melted ; keep beating the mixture, add the eggs and a pinch of salt, and when the batter is quite smooth, put it into a well-buttered basin, tie it down very tightly, and put it into boiling water; move the basin about for a few minutes after it is put into the water, to prevent the flour settling in any part, and boil for I4 hour. This pudding may also be boiled in a floured cloth that has been wetted in hot water; it will then take a few minutes less than when boiled in a basin. Send these puddings very quickly to table, and serve with sweet sauce, wine sauce, stewed fruit, or jam of any kind: when the latter is used, a little of it may be placed round the dish in small quantities, as a garnish.

Beead.—Bread contains, in its composition, in the form of vegetable albumen and vegetable fibrine, two of the chief constituents of flesh, and, in its incombustible con- stituents, the salts which are indispensable for sanguification, of the same quality and in the same proportion as flesh. But flesh contains, besides these, a number of sub- stances which are entirely wanting in vegetable food; and on these peculiar constituents of flesh depend certain effects, by which it is essentially distinguished from other articles of food.

Ilode.—Cut 9 slices of bread and butter not very thick, and put them into a pie-dish, with currants between each layer and on the top. Sweeten and flavour the milk, either by infusing a little lemon- peel in it, or by adding a few drops of essence of vanilla ; well whisk the eggs, and stir these to the milk. Strain this over the bread and butter, and bake in a moderate oven for 1 hour, or rather longer. This pudding may be very much enriched by adding cream, candied peel, or more eggs than stated above. It should not be turned out, but sent to table in the pie-dish, and is better for being made about 2 hours before it is baked. Time,—1 hour, or rather longer. Average cost, dd. Sufficient for 6 or 7 persons. Seasonable at any time. Butter.—Butter is indispensable in almost all culinary preparations. Good fresh butter, used in moderation, is easily digested; it is softening, nutritious, and fattening, and is far more easily digested than any other of the oleaginous substances sometimes used in its place.

Proceed in this manner until the mould is nearly full; then flavour the milk with nutmeg and grated lemon-rind; add the sugar, and stir to this the eggs, which should be well beaten. Beat this mixture for a few minutes; then strain it into the mould, which should be quite full; tie a piece of buttered paper over it, and let it stand for 2 hours ; then tie it down with a cloth, put it into boiling water, and let it boil slowly for 1 hour. In taking it up, let it stand for a minute or two before the cloth is removed ; then quickly turn it out of the mould or basin, and serve with sweet sauce separately. The flavouring of this pudding may be varied by substituting for the lemon-rind essence of vanilla or bitter almonds ; and it may be made much richer by using cream ; but this is not at all necessary.

Make a short crust with i lb. 1 of flour, by either of the recipes 1210 or 1211; lay a border round the i edge of the dish; put on the cover, and ornament the edges ; bake in a brisk oven from i hour to 40 minutes; strew finely-sifted sugar oyer,MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. and serve hot or cold, although the latter is the more usual mode. It is more economical to make two or three tarts at one time, as the trimmings from one tart answer for lining the edges of the dish for another, and so much paste is not required as when they are made singly. Unless for family use, never make fruit pies in very large dishes; select them, however, as deep as possible. Time,—J hour to 40 minutes. Average cost^ in full season, ^d, Sufficient for 5 or 6 persons. SeasonaUe in June, July, and August. Note.—A few currants added to the cherries will be found to impart a nice piquant taste to them. Cherkies.—According to Lucullus, the cherry-tree was known in Asia in the year .of Eome 680. Seventy different species of cherries, wild and culti-vated, exist, which are dis- tinguishable from each other by the difference of their form, size, and colour. The French distil from cherries a liqueur named kirsch-waser (eau de cerises); the Italians prepare, from a cherry called marusca, the liqueur named marasquin, sweeter and more agreeable than the former. _ The- most wholesome cherries have a tender and delicate skin; those with a hard skin should be very carefully masticated. Sweetmeats, syrups, CHERET. tarts, entremets, &c., of cherries, are universally approved. COLD PUDDING. 1262.

Mode.—Chop the suet finely, mix it with the flour, and add the currants, which should be nicely washed, picked, and dried; mix the whole to a limp paste with the water (if wanted very nice, use milk); divide it into 7 or 8 dumplings; tie them in cloths, and boil for li hour. They may be boiled without a cloth : they should then be made into round balls, and dropped into boiling water, and should be moved about at first, to prevent them from sticking to the bottom of the saucepan. Serve with a cut lemon, cold butter, and sifted sugar. Time.—In a cloth, 1 j hour ; without, f hour. Average cost, 9d. Sufficient for 6 or 7 persons. Seasonable at any time. Zante Cuerants.—The dried fruit which goes by the name of currants in grocers' shops is not a currant really, but a small kind of grape, chiefly cultivated in the Morea and the Ionian Islands, Corfu, Zante, &c. Those of Zante are cultivated in an I immense plain, under the shelter of mountains, on the. shore of j the island, where the sun has great power, and brings them to maturity. When gathered and dried by the sun and air, on 1 mats, they are conveyed to magazines, heaped together, and left to cake, until ready for shipping. They are then dug out by iron crowbars, trodden into casks, and exported. The fer- tile vale of "Zante the woody" produces about 9,000,000lbs, of currants annually. In cakes and puddings this delicious [uttJe grape is most extensively used; in fact, we could not make ZANTE cueean-TS. aplum pudding without the currant. .

Boiled without a basin, allow i hour less. "We have allowed rather a large proportion of sugar; but we find fruit puddings are so much more juicy and palatable when?^'^?^ sweetened before they are boiled, besides being more economical. A few raspberries added to red-currant pudding are a very nice addition: about i pint would be sufficient for the above quantity of fruit. Fruit puddings are very delicious if, when they are turned out of the basin, the crust is browned with a salamander, or put into a very hot oven for a few minutes to colour it: this makes it crisp on the surface. Time.—2^ to 3 hours ; without a basin, 2 to 2l ^ hours. Average cost, in full season, Sd Sufficient for 6 or 7 persons. SeasonaUe in June, July, and Angusc. CuEEAT^TS.—The utility of currants, reel, blade, or v^hMe, has long been established in domestic economy. The juice of the red species, if boiled with an equal weight of loaf sugar, forms an agreeable substance called currant jelly, much employed in sauces, and very valuable in the cure of sore throats and colds. The French mix it with sugar and water, and thus form au agreeable beverage. The juice of currants is a valuable remedy in obstructions of the bowels ; and, in febrile comx)laints, it is useful on account of its readily quenching thirst, and for its cooling effect on the stomach, White and flesh-coloured cur- rants have, with the exception of the fullness of flavour, in every resjpect, the same qualities as the red species. Both white CURRANTS. and red currants are pleasant additions to the dessert, but the black variety is mostly used for culinary and medicinal purposes, especially in the form of jelly for quinsies. The leaves of the black currant make a pleasant'tea, BED-CUBBAHT AWD BASPDEBBY TABT. 1267.

This tart is more generally served cold than hot. Time.—| to % hour. Average cost^ Sufficient for 5 or 6 persons. Scasonahle in June, July, and August. Easpeeretes.—There ra-e two sorts of raspberries, the red and the ^Thite. Both the scent and flavour of this fruit aro , very refreshing, and the berry itself is exceedingly Avhole- some, and invaluable to people" of a nervous or bilious tem- perament. We are not aware, however, of its being cultivated with the same amount of care which is bestowed upon some other of the berry tribe, although it is far from improbable that a more careful cultivation would not be repaid by a con- I siderable improvement in the size and flavour of theberr}^; neither, as an eating fruit, is it so universally esteemed as the strawberry, with whose lusciousness and peculiarly agreeable flavour it can bear no comparison. In Scotland, it is found in Ira-ge quantities, growing wild, and is eagerly sought after, \ in the woods, by children. Its juice is rich and abundant, i and to many, extremely agreeable, raspbeehy. BAKED CUSTABD PUDDING-. 1268. Iiq-GREDiEiTTS.—li pint of milk, the rind of I lemon, | lb. of moist sugar, 4 eggs. 3fode,—Put the milk into a saucepan with the sugar and lemon- rind, and let this infuse for about ^ hour, or until the milk is well flavoured ; whisk the eggs, yolks and whites ; pour the milk to them, stirring all the while ; then have ready a pie-dish, lined at the edge with paste ready baked; strain the custard into the dish, grate a little nutmeg over the top, and bake in a ver^/ sloio oven for about i hour, or rather longer. The flavour of this pudding may be varied by substituting bitter almonds for the lemon-rind ; and it may be very much enriched by using half cream and half milk, and doubling the quantity of eggs. Time.—^ to f hour. Average cost^ dd. Sufficient for 5 or 6 persons. Seasonable at any time. Note.—This pudding is usually served cold with fruit tarts. BOIIiED CUSTABD PUDDING. 1269.

Mode,—Put the damsons, with the sugar between them, into a deep pie-dish, in the midst of v/hich, place a small cup or jar turned upside down; pile the fruit high in the middle, line the edges of the dish with short or puff crust, whichever may be preferred; put on the cover, ornament the edges, and bake from i to f hour in a good oven. If puff-crust is used, about 10 minutes before the pie is done, take it out of the oven, brush it over with the white of an egg beaten to a froth with the blade of a knife; strew some sifted sugar over, and a few drops of water, and put the tart back to finish baking: with short crust, a little plain sifted sugar, sprinkled over, is all that will be required. Time.—\ to f hour. Average cost, 10c?. Sufficient for 5 or 6 persons. Seasonahle in September and October. Damsons—Whether for jam, jelly, pie, pudding, water, ice, wine, dried fruit or preserved, the damson, or damascene (for it was originally brought from Damascus, whence its name), is in- valuable. It combines sugary and acid qualities in happy pro- portions, when full ripe. It is a fruit easily cultivated; and, if budded nine inches from the ground on vigorous stocks, it will grow several feet high in the first year, and make fine standards the year following. Amongst the list of the best sorts of baking plums, the damson stands first, not only on account of the abundance of its juice, but also on account of its soon softening. Because of the roughness of its flavour, it requires a large rAirsoirs. quantity of sugar. DAMSOW PUDDma. 1271. Ingeedients.—If pint of damsons, \ lb. of moist sugar, fib. of suet or butter crust.

Seosonahle from November to May. Oran"GE (Citrus Aurantiiim).—The principal varieties are tlie sweet, or China orange, and the bitter, or Seville orange; the Maltese is also ^vortlly of notice, from its red blood-like pulp. The orange is extensively cultivated in the south of Europe, and in Devonshire, on walls with a south aspect, it bears an abundance of fruit. So great is the increase in the demand for the orange, and so ample the supply, that it promises to rival the apple in its popu- larity. The orange-tree is considered young at the age of a hundred years. The pulp of the orange consists of a collection of oblong vesicles filled v.'ith a sugary and re- freshing juice. The orange blossom is loroverbiaUy chosen for the bridal wreath, and, from the same flower, an es- sential oil is extracted hardly less esteemed than the cele- brated ottar of roses. Of all marmalades, that made from the Seville orange is the best. The peel and juice of the orange are much used in culinary preparations. From oranges are made preserves, comfitures, jellies, glacds, sherbet, liqueurs, and syi'ups. The juice of the orange in a glass d'eau sucree makes a refreshing and wholesome drink. From the clarified pulp of the orange the French make a delicious jelly, which they serve in small pots, and call creine. The rasped peel of the orange is used in several sweet entremets, to which it communicates its perfume. The confectioner manufactures a variety of dainties from all parts of the orange. Confections of orange-peel are excellent tonics and stomachics. Persons with delicate stomachs should abstain from oranges at dessert, because their acidity is likely to derange the digestive organs. SMALL DISHES OF PASTEY FOR ENTEEMETS, SUPPER- DISHES, &c. FAlSrCHOnsrNETTES, or CITSTARD TARTLETS. 1315. Ingeedients.—For the custard, 4 eggs, f pint of milk, 2 oz. of butter, 2 oz. of pounded sugar, 3 dessertspoonfuls of flour, flavouring to taste ; the whites of 2 eggs, 2 oz. of pounded sugar. 3fode.—Well beat the eggs; stir to them the milk, the butter, which should be beaten to a cream, the sugar, and flour; mix these ingre- dients well together, put them into a very clean saucepan, and bring them to the simmering point, but do not allow them to boil. Flavour with essence of vanilla, bitter almonds, lemon, grated chocolate, or any flavouring ingredient that may be preferred. Line some round tartlet-pans with good puff-paste ; fill them with the custard, and bake in a moderate oven for about 20 minutes ; then take them out of the pans ; let them cool, and in the mean time whisk the whites of the eggs to a stiff froth ; stir into this the pounded sugar, and spread smoothly over the tartlets a little of this mixture. Put them in the oven again to set the icing, but be particular that they do not scorch :6G1 PUDDINGS AND TASTKY. when the icing looks crisp, they are done. Arrange them, piled high in the centre, on a white napkin, and garnish the dish, and in between the tartlets, with strips of bright jelly, or very firmly-made preserve. Time.—20 minutes to bake the tartlets ; 5 minutes after being iced. Average cost, exclusive of the paste, Is. Sufficient to fill 10 or 12 tartlets. Seasoncihle at any time. Note.—The icing may be omitted on the top of the tartlets, and a spoonful of any kind of preserve put at the bottom of the custard instead ; this varies both the flavour and appearance of this dish. ALMOND PLOWEKS. i3i^>. Ingeedients.—Puff-paste Iso. 1205; to every i lb. of paste allow 3 oz. of almonds, sifted sugar, the white of an egg. 3Iode.-—RoW the paste out to the thickness of J inch, and, with a round fluted cutter, stamp out as many pieces as may be required. "Work the paste up again, roll it out, and, with a smaller cutter, stamp out some pieces the size of a shilling. Brush the larger pieces over with the white of an egg, and place one of the smaller pieces on each. Blanch and cut the almonds into strips lengthwise ; press them slanting into the paste closely round the rings ; and when they are all completed, sift over some pounded sugar, and bake for about 5 hour or 20 minutes. Garnish between the almonds with strips of apple jelly, and place in the centre of the ring a small quantity of strawberry jam; pile them high on the dish, and serve. Time.—\ hour or 20 minutes.

Lay over this preserve another thin paste ; press the edges together all round; and mark the paste in lines with a knife on the surface, to show where to cut it when baked. Bake from 20 minutes to i hour; and, a short time before being done, take the pastry out of the oven, brush it over with the white of an egg, sift over pounded sugar, and put it back in the oven to colour. When cold, cut it into strips ; pile these on a dish pyramidically, and serve. These strips, cut about 2 inches long, piled in circular rows, and a plateful of flavoured whipped cream poured in the middle, make a very pretty dish. Time.—20 minutes to \ hour.

When they are done, make a little hole in the middle of the paste, and fill it up with apricot jam, marmalade, or red-currant jelly. Pile them high in the centre of a dish, on a napkin, and garnish with the same preserve the tartlets are filled with. Time,—\ hour or 20 minutes. Average cost^ with k lb. of pufi'-paste, Is. Sufficient for 2 dishes of pastry. Seasonahle at any time. I^ote.—lt should be borne in mind, that, for all dishes of small pastry, sucli as the preceding, trimmings of pufif-paste, left from larger tarts, answer as well as making the paste expressly. PUITS d'AMOUB, or PUFF-PASTE KINGS. 1321. Ingkedients.—Pufl^'-paste No. 1205, the white of an egg, sifted loaf sugar. iJfoc?^.—Make some good puff-paste by recipe No. 1205 ; roll it out to the thickness of about ^ inch, and, with a round fluted paste- cutter, stamp out as many pieces as may be required; then work the pasteup again, and roll it out to the same thickness, and with a smaller cutter, stamp out sufficient pieces to correspond with the larger ones. Again stamp out the centre of these smaller rings; brush over the others with the white of an egg, place a small ring on the top of every large circular piece of paste, egg over the tops, and bake from 15 to 20 minutes. Sift over sugar, put them back in the oven to colour them; then fill the rings with preserve of any bright colour. Dish them high on a napkin, and serve. So many pretty dishes of pastry may be made by stamping puff-paste out with fancy cutters, and filling the pieces, when baked, with jelly or preserve, that our space will not allow us to give a separate recipe for each of them ; but, as they are all made from one paste, and only the shape and garnish- ing varied, perhaps it is not necessary, and by exercising a little ingenuity, variety may always be obtained. Half-moons, leaves, diamonds, stars, shamrocks, rings, &c., are the most appropriate shapes for fancy pastry. Time.—15 to 25 minutes.

Tie them loosely in a clean cloth, leaving a little room for them to swell, and put them on to boil in cold rain-water, allowing 2i hours after the water has simmered up. When the peas are tender, take them up and drain; rub them through a colander with a wooden spoon ; add the butter, eggs, pepper, and salt; beat all well together for a few minutes, until the ingredients are well incorporated; then tie them tightly in a floured cloth; boil the pudding for another hour, turn it on to the dish, and serve very hot. This pudding should always be sent to table with boiled leg of pork, and is an exceedingly nice accompani- ment to boiled beef. Time.—2^ hours to boil the peas, tied loosely in the cloth; 1 hour for the pudding. Average cost, 6d: Sufficient for 7 or 8 persons. Seasonable from September to March. BAKED PLUM-PUDDING-. 1324. INGREDIEJ7TS.—2 Ibs. of flour, 1 lb. of currants, 1 lb. of raisins, 1 lb. of suet, 2 eggs, 1 pint of milk, a few slices of candied peel. Mode.—Cho^ the suet finely ; mix with it the flour, currants, stoned raisins, and candied peel; moisten with the well-beaten eggs, and add sufficient milk to make the pudding of the consistency of very thick batter. Put it into a buttered dish, and bake in a good oven from 2j to 2| hours; turn it out, strew sifted sugar over, and serve. For a very plain pudding, use only half the quantity of fruit, omit the eggs, and substitute milk or water for them.

Eaisin"-Gr\pe.—AH the kinds of raisius have much the same virtues ; they are nutritive and balsamic, but they are very subject to fermentation with juices of any kind; and. lience, when eaten immoderately, they often bring on colics. Tljere are many varieties of grape used for raisins ; the fruit of Valencia is that mostly dried for culinary purposes, whilst most of the table kinds are grown in Malaga, and called Mus- catels. The finest of all table raisins come from Provence or Italy; the most esteemed of all are those of Roquevaire; they are very large and very sweet. This sort is rarel}'^ eaten by any but the most wealthy. The dried Malaga, or Muscatel i-afsins, which come to this country packed in small boxes, :\ud nicely preserved in bunches, are variable in their quality, but mostly of a rich flavour, when new, juicy, and of a deep purple hue.

Mode.—Mix the flour, currants, suet, and sugar well together; have ready the above proportions of mashed carrot and potato, which stir into the other ingredients; add the treacle and lemon-peel; but put no liquid in the mixture, or it will be spoiled. Tie it loosely in a cloth, or, if put in a basin, do not quite fill it, as the pudding should have room to swell, and boil it for 4 hours. Serve with brandy-sauce.

A few sweet almonds, blanched and cut in strips, and stuck on the pud- ding, ornament it prettily. This quantity may be divided and boiled in buttered moulds. For small families this is the most desirable way, as the above will be found to make a pudding of rather large dimensions. Time.—6 to 8 hours. Average cost, 7s. 6d. Seasonable in winter. Sufficient for 12 or 14 persons. I^ote.—The muscatel raisins can be purcliased at a cheap rate loose (not in bunches): they are then scarcely higher in price than the ordinary raisins, and impart a much richer flavour to the pudding. Sultana Grape.—We have elsewhere stated that the small black grape grown in Corinth and the Ionian Isles is, when dried, the common currant of the grocers' shops; the white or yellow grape, grown in the same places, is somewhat larger than the black variety, and is that which produces the Sultana raisin. It has been called Sultana from its delicate qualities and uniqvie growth : the finest are those of Smyrna. They have not sufficient flavour and sugary properties to serve alone for puddings and cakes, but they are peculiarly valuable for mixing, that is to say, for introducing in company with the richer sorts ofValencias or Muscatels. In white puddings, or cakes, too, where the whiteness must be preserved, the Sultana raisin should be used. But the greatest value of this fruit in the cuisine is that of its saving labour; for it has no stones. Half Muscatels and half Sultanas are an admirable mixture for general purposes.

Baisixs.—Eaisins are grapes, prepared by suffering them to remain on the -vine until they are perfectly ripe, and theu drying them in the sun or by the heat of an oven. The sun-dried grapes are sweet, the oven-dried of an acid flavour. The common way of drying grapes for raisins is to tie two or three bunches of them together, wl)ilst yet on the vine, and dip them into a hot lixivium of wood-ashes mixed with a little of the oil of olives : this disposes them to shrink and wrinkle, after which they are left on the vine three or four days, separated, on sticks in a horizontal situation, and then dried in the sun at leisure, after being cut from the tree.

CHSISTMAS PLUM-PUDDI^fG IIT HLOTJLT) When all these dry ingredients are prepared, mix them well together, then moisten the mixture with the - eggs, which should be well beaten, and the brandy; stir well, that every- thing may be very thoroughly blended, and press the pudding into a buttered . mould; tie it down tightly with a floured cloth, and boil for 5 or 6 hours. ^^^^^^ It may be boiled in a cloth without a mould, and will require the same time allowed for cooking. As Christmas puddings are usually made a few days before they are required for table, when the pudding is taken out of the pot, hang it up immediately, and put a plate or saucer underneath to catch the water that may drain from it. The day it is to be eaten, plunge it into boiling water, and keep it boiling for at least 2 hours ; then turn it out of the mould, and serve with brandy-sauce. On Christmas-day a sprig of holly is usually placed in the middle of the pudding, and about a wineglassful of brandy poured round it, which, at the moment of serving, is lighted, and the pudding thus brought to table encircled in Hame. Time.—5 or 6 hours the first time of boiling; 2 hours the day it is to be served. Average costy 4s. Suffvcient for a quart mould for 7 or 8 persons.

Brandt is the alcoholic or spirituous portion of wine, separated from the aqueous part, the colouring matter, &c., by distillation. The word is of German origin, and in its German form, brantwein, signiiies burnt Avine, or wine that has undergone the action of fire; brandies, so called, however, have been made from potatoes, carrots, beetroot, IDCars, and other vegetable substances; but they are all inferior to true brandy. Brandy is prepared in most wine countries, but that of France is the most esteemed. It is procured not only by distilling the wine itself, but also by fermenting and distilling the ware, or residue of the pressings of the grape. It is procured indiflerently from red or white wine, and different wines yield very different proportions of it, the strongest, of course, giving the largest quantity. Brandy obtained from marc has a more acrid taste than that from wine. The celebrated brandy of Cognac, a town in the depart- ment of Charente, and that brought from Andraye, seem to owe their excellence from being made from white wine. Like other spirit, brandy is colourless when recently distilled; by mere keeping, however, owing, probably, to some change in the soluble matter contained in it, it acquires a slight colour, which is much increased by keeping in casks, and is made of the required intensity by the addition of burnt sugar or other colouring matter. What is called British brandy is not, in fact, brandy, which is the name, as we have said, of a spirit distilled from tvine; but is a spirit made chiefly from malt spirit, with the addition of mineral acids and various flavouring ingredients, the exact composition being kept secret. It is distilled somewhat extensively in this country; real brandy scarcely at all. The brandies imported into England are chiefly from Bordeaux, Kochelle, and Cognac, A POUND PLUM-PUDDING. 1329.

The candied peel is prepared in tlie same manner as orange or lemon-pcel; that is to say, the peel is boiled in water until quite soft, and then susi^ended in concentrated syrup (in the cold), after which it is either dried in a current of warm air, or in a stove, at a heat not exceeding 120° Fahrenheit. The syrup must be kept fully saturated with sugar by reboiling it once or twice during the process. It may be dusted with powdered lump sugar, if necessary. The citron is supposed to be the Median, Assyrian, or Persian apple of the Greeks. It is described by Eisso as having a majestic appearance, its shining leaves and rosy flowers being succeeded by fruit whose beauty and size astonish the observer, whilst their odour gratifies his senses. In China there is an enormous variety, but the citron is cultivated in all orange-gro\\ing countries. PLUM-PUDDING OP FRESH FRUIT. 1330.

Plums.—Almost all the varieties of the cultivated plum are agreeable and refreshing: it is not a nourishing fruit, and if indulged in to excess, when unripe, is almost certain to cause diarrhoea and cholera. Weak and delicate persons had better abstain from plums altogether. The modes of preparing plums are as numerous as the varieties of the fruit.

Sttgib has been happily called the honey of reeds," The sugar-cane apiDearsto he ori- inally a native of the East Indies. The Chinese ave cultivated it for 2,000 years. The Egyptians, Phoenicians, and Jews knew nothing about it. The Greek physicians are the first who speak of it. It was not till the year 1471 that a Venetian discovered the method of purifying brown sugar and maldng loaf sugar. He gained an immense fortune by this discovery. Our supplies are now obtained from Barbadoes, Jamaica, Mauritius, Ceylon, the East and West Indies generally, and the United States; but the largest supplies come from Cuba. Sugar is divided into the following classes : — Refined sugar, white clayed, brown clayed, brown raw, and molasses. The sugar- cane grows to the height of six, twelve, or even sometimes twenty feet. It is propagated from cuttings, requires much hoeing and weeding, giving employment to thousands upon thousands of slaves in the slave countries, and attains maturity in twelve or thirteen months. When ripe, it is cut down close to the stole, the stems are divided into lengths of about three feet, which are made up into bundles, and carried to the mill, to be crushed between rollers. In the process of crushing, the juice runs down into a reservoir, from which, after a while, it is drawn through a siphon; that is to say, the clear fluid is taken from the scum. This fluid undergoes several processes of drying and refining; the methods varying in diflerent manufactories. There are some large establishments engaged in sugar-peiining in the neighbourhoods of BlackwaLl and Bethnal Green, London. The process is mostly in the hands of German workmen. Sugar is adulterated with fine sand and sawdust. Pure sugar is highly nutritious, adding to the fatty tissue of the body j but it is not easy of digestion. SUGAE-CANES.

IntrodtjctiOjNT of Sugar.—Sugar was first known as a drug, aud used by ilic apotlie- caries, and witli them vras a most important article. At its first appearance, some said it was heating; others, that it injured the chest; others, that it disposed persons to apoplexy; the truth, however, soon conquered these fancies, and the use of sugar has increased every day, and there is no household in the civilized world which can do without it.

It was comparatively little known till within the last twenty or thirty years, but it is now cultivated in almost every British garden. The part used is the footstalks of the leaves, which, peeled and cut into small pieces, are put into tarts, either mixed with apples or alone. When quite young, they are much better not peeled. Khubarb comes in season when apples are going out. The common rhubarb is a native of Asia ; the scarlet variety has the linest flavour. Turkey rhu- barb, the Avcll-known medicinal drug, is the root of a very elegant plant {Rheiivi pahnatim), coming to greatest perfection in Tartary. For culinary purposes, all kinds of rhubarb are the better for being blanched. EAISED PIE OP POULTBY OB GAME. 1340. Ingeedients.—To every lb. of flour allow i lb. of butter, i pint of water, the yolks of 2 eggs, \ teaspoonful of salt (these are for the crust); 1 large fowl or pheasant, a few slices of veal cutlet, a few slices of dressed ham, forcemeat, seasoning of nutmeg, allspice, pepper and salt, gravy. ilfot?^.—Make a stiff short crust with the above proportion of butter, flour, water, and eggs, and work it up very smoothly; butter a raised-pie mould, as shown in No. 1190, and line it with the paste. Previously to making the crust, bone the fowl, or whatever bird is intended to be used, lay it, breast downwards, upon a cloth, and season the inside well with pounded mace, allspice, pepper, and salt; then spread over it a layer of forcemeat, then a layer of seasoned 2 X EHTJBABB.MODERN HODSEHOLD COOKERY. 674: veal, and then one of ham, and then another layer of forcemeat, and roll the fowl over, making the skin meet at the back. Line the pie with forcemeat, put in the fowl, and fill up the cavities with slices of seasoned veal and ham and forcemeat; wet the edges of the pie, put on the cover, pinch the edges together with the paste-pincers, and decorate it with leaves; brush it over with beaten yolk of egg, and bake in a moderate oven for 4 hours. In the mean time, make a good strong gravy from the bones, pour it through a fun- nel into the hole at the top ; cover this hole with a small leaf, and the pie, EAisED PIE. when cold, will be ready for use. Let it be remembered that the gravy must be considerably reduced before it is poured into the pie, as, when cold, it should form a firm jelly, and not be the least degree in a liquid state. This recipe is suitable for all kinds of poultry or game, using one or more birds, according to the size of the pie intended to be made; but the birds must always be boned. Truf3.es, mushrooms, &c., added to this pie, make it much nicer; and, to enrich it, lard the fleshy parts of the poultry or game with thin strips of bacon. This method of forming raised pies in a mould is generally called a timhaley and has the advantage of being more easily made than one where the paste is raised by the hands; the crust, besides, being eatable. {See coloured plate N 1.) Time.—Large pie, 4 hours. Average cost, 6s. 6d, Seasonable, with poultry, all the year; with game, from September to March. BAISED PIE OF VEAL AHD HAM. 1341.

Mode.—To raise the crust for a pie with the hands is a very dif- ficult task, and can only be accomplished by skilled and experienced cooks. The process should be seen to be satisfactorily learnt, and plenty of practice given to the making of raised pies, as by that means only will success be insured. Make a hot-water paste by | recipe No. 1217, and from the mass raise the pie with the hands; if | this cannot be accomplished, cut out pieces for the top and bottom, ; and a long piece for the sides; fasten the bottom and side-piece together by means of egg, and pinch the edges well together; then ! line the pie with forcemeat made by recipe No. 415, put in a layer of |PUDDINGS A.ND PASTRY. Q75 veal, and a plentiful seasoning of salt, pepper, nutmeg*, and allspice^ as, let it be remembered, these pies taste very insipid unless highly seasoned. Over the seasoning place a layer of sliced bacon or cooked ham, and then a layer of forcemeat, veal seasoning, and bacon, and so on until the meat rises to about an inch above the paste; taking care to finish with a layer of forcemeat, to fill all the cavities of the pie, and to lay in the meat firmly and compactly. Brush the top edge of the pie with beaten egg, put on the cover, press the edges, and pinch them round with paste-pincers. Make a hole in the middle of the lid, and ornament the pie with leaves, which should be stuck on with the white of an egg ; then brush it all over with the beaten yolk of an egg, and bake the pie in an oven with a soaking heat from 3 to 4 hours. To ascertain when it is done, run a sharp- pointed knife or skewer through the hole at the top into the middle of the pie, and if the meat feels tender, it is sufficiently baked. Have ready about k pint of very strong gravy, pour it through a funnel into the hole at the top, stop up the hole with a small leaf of baked paste, and put the pie away until wanted for use. Should it acquire too much colour in the baking, cover it with white paper, as the crust should not in the least degree be burnt. Mushrooms, trufiies, and many other ingredients, may be added to enrich the flavour of these pies, and the very fleshy parts of the meat may be larded. These pies are more frequently served cold than hot, and form excellent dishes for cold suppers or breakfasts. The cover of the pie is some- times carefully removed, leaving the perfect edges, and the top deco- rated with square pieces of very bright aspic jelly: this has an exceedingly pretty eflect.

When boiled, it should be so managed that the grains, though soft, should be as little broken and as dry as possible. The water in which it is dressed should only simmer, and not boil hard. Very little water should be used, as the grains absorb a great deal, and, consequently, swell much; and if they take up too much at first, it is ditlicult to get rid of it. Bakiug it in puddings is the best mode of preparing it. II. {Plain and Economical; a nice Pudding for Children.) 1343.

Some cooks smooth the rice with the back of a spoon, and then brush it over Y\dth the yolk of an egg, and set it in the oven to colour; but the rice well boiled, white, dry, and with every grain distinct, is by far the more preferable mode of dressing it. During the process of boiling, the rice should be attentively watched, that it be not overdone, as, if this is the case, it will have a mashed and soft appearance.

SAVOUBY CASSEKOLE OF HIOB, Or Bice Border, for Bagouts, Fricassees, &c. (an Entree). 1350. Ingeedients.—lb. of rice, 3 pints of weak stock or broth, 2 slices of fat ham, 1 teaspoonful of salt. 3Iode.—A casserole of rice, when made in a mould, is not such a difficult operation as when it is moulded by the hand. It is an elegant and inexpensive entree, as the remains of cold fish, flesh, or fowl may be served as ragouts, fricassees, &c., in- closed in the casserole. It requires great nicety in its preparation, the principal thing to attend to being the boiling of the rice, as, if this is not sufficiently cooked, the casserole, when moulded, will have a rough appearance, which would entirely spoil it. After having washed the rice in two or three waters, drain it well, and put it into a stewpan with the stock, ham, and salt; cover the pan closely, and let the rice gradually swell over a slow fire, occasionally stirring, to prevent its sticking. When it is quite soft, strain it, pick out the pieces of ham, and, with the back of a large wooden spoon, mash the rice to a perfectly smooth paste. Then well grease a mould (moulds are made purposely for rice borders), and turn it upside down for a minute or two, to drain away the fat, should there be too much; put some rice all round the bottom and sides of it ; place a piece of soft bread in the middle, and cover it with rice; press it in equally with the spoon, and let it cool. Then dip the mould into hot water, turn the casserole care- fully on to .a dish, mark where the lid is to be formed on the top, by making an incision with the point of a knife about an inch from the edge all round, and put it into a ve7y hot oven. Brush it over with a little clarified butter, and bake about 4 hour, or rather longer; then carefully remove the lid, which will be formed by the incision having been made all round, and remove the bread, in small pieces, with the point of a penknife, being careful not to injure the casserole. Fill the centre with the ragout or fricassee, which should be made thick; put on the cover, glaze it, place it in the oven to set the glaze, and serve as hot as possible. The casserole should not be emptied too much, as it is liable to crack from the weight of whatever is put in;680 MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. and in baking it, let tlie oven be very hot, or the casserole will probably break.

Roll out the paste to the thickness of about li inch, and, with a fluted Slrn cutter, stamp it out to the desired shape, either round or oval, and, with the point of a small knife, make a slight incision in the paste all round the top, about an inch from the edge, which, when baked, forms the lid. Put the vol-au-vent into a good brisk oven, and keep the door shut for a few minutes after it is put in. Particular attention should be paid to the heating of the oven, for the paste cannot rise without a tolerable degree of heat 2 T 2692 MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. When of a nice colour, without being scorched, withdraw it from the oven, instantly remove the cover where it was marked, and detach all the soft crumb from the centre: in doing this, be careful not to break the edges of the vol-au-venf; but should they look thin in places, stop them with small flakes of the inside paste, stuck on with the white of an egg. This precaution is necessary to prevent the fricassee or ragout from bursting the case, and so spoiling the appearance of the dish. Fill the vol-au-vent with a rich mince, or fricassee, or ragout, or the remains of cold fish flaked and warmed in a good white sauce, and do not make them very liquid, for fear of the gravy bursting the crust: replace the lid, and serve.

Strawbebkt.—Among the Greeks, the name of the strawberry indicated its tenuity, this fruit forming hardly a mouthful. With the Latins, the name reminded one of tho delicious perfume of this plant. Both nations were equally fond of it, and applied the same care to its cultivation. Virgil appears to place it in the same rank with flowers ; and Ovid gives it a tender epithet, which delicate palates would not disavow. Neither does this luxurious poet forget the wild strawberry, which disappears beneath its modest foliage, but whose presence the scented air reveals.

Yeast consists principally of a substance very similar in composition, and in many of its sensible properties, to gluten; and, when new or fresh, it is inflated and rendered frothy by a large quantity of carbonic acid. When mixed with wort, this su})stance acts upon the saccharine matter; the temperature rises, carbonic acid is disengaged, and the result is ale, which always contains a considerable proportion of alcohol, or spirit. The quantity of yeast employed in brewing ale being small, the saccharine matter is but imperfectly decomposed : hence a considerable portion of it remains in the liquor, and gives it that viscid quality and body for which it is remarkable. The fermenting property of yeast is weakened by boiling for ten minutes, and is entirely destroyed by continuing the boiling. Alcohol j)oured upon it likewise renders it inert j on which account its power lessens as the alcohol is formed during fermentation. YOEKSHIBE PUDI)I]MG, to serve v/ith hot Koast Beef. 1384.

Creams.—The yellowish-white, opaque fluid, smooth and unctuous to the touch, which separates itself from new milk, and forms a layer on its surface, when removed by skimming, is employed in a variety of culinary preparations. The analyses of the contents of cream have been decided to be, in 100 parts—butter, 3*5 ; curd, or matter of cheese, 8*5 ; whey, 92'0. That 3ream contains an oil, is evinced by its staining clothes in the manner of oil; and when boiled for some time, a little oil floats ujDon the surface. The thick animal oil which it contains, the well-known luiter, is seiDarated only by agitation, as in the common process of cTturning, and the cheesy matter remains blended with the whey in the state of luitermiUc. Of the several kinds of cream, the principal are the Devonshire and Dutch clotted creams, the Costorphin cream, and the Scotch sour cream. The Devonshire cream is produced by nearly boihng the milk in shallow tin vessels over a charcoal rive, and kept in that state until the whole of the cream is thrown up. It is used for eating with fruits and tarts. The cream from Costorphin, a village of that name near Edinburgh, is accelerated in its separation from three or four days' old milk, by a certain degree of heat; and the Dutch clotted cream—a coagulated mass in which a spoon will stand upright—is manufactured from fresh-drawn milk, which is put into a pan, and stirred with a spoon two or three times a day, to prevent the cream from separating from the milk. The Scotch " sour cream " is a misnomer ; for it is a material produced without cream. A small tub filled with skimmed milk is put into a larger one, containing hotMODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. 696 water, and after remaining tLei'o all niglit, the tliin milk (called n-imj) is drawn off, and the remainder of the contents of the smaller vessel is **sour cream." 13S6. Jellies are not the nourishing food they were at one time considered to be, and many eminent physicians are of opinion that they are less digestible than the flesh, or muscular part of animals ; still, when acidulated with lemon-juice and flavoured with wine, they are very suitable for some convalescents. Vegetable jelly is a distinct principle, existing in fruits, which possesses the property of gelatinizing when boiled and cooled ; but it is a principle entirely different from the gelatine of animal bodies, although the name of jelly, common to both, sometimes leads to an erroneous idea on that subject. Animal jelly, or gelatine, is glue, whereas vegetable jelly is rather analogous to gum. Liebig places gelatine very low indeed in the scale of usefulness. He says,Gelatine, -which by itself is tasteless, and when eaten, excites nausea, possesses no nutritive value ; that, even when accompanied by the savoury constituents of flesh, it is not capable of supporting the vital process, and when added to the usual diet as a substitute for plastic matter, does not increase, but, on the contrary, diminishes the nutritive value of the food, which it renders insufficient in quantity and inferior in quality." It is this substance w^hich is most frequently emplo3^ed in the manufacture of the jellies supplied by the confectioner ; but those prepared at home from calves' feet do possess some nutrition, and are the only sort that should be given to invalids. Isinglass is the purest variety of gelatine, and is prepared from the sounds or swimming-bladders of certain fish, chiefly the sturgeon. From its wdiiteness it is mostly used for making blanc-mange and similar dishes. 1387. The White op Eggs is perhaps the best substance that can be em-' ployed in clarifying jelly, as well as some other fluids, for the reason that when albumen (and the white of eggs is nearly pure albumen) is put into a liquid that is muddy, from substances suspended in it, on boiling the liquid, the albumen coagulates in a flocculent manner, and, entangling with it the impurities, rises with them to the surface as a scum, or sinks to the bottom, according to their weight. 1388. Souffles, Omelets, akd Sweet Dishes, in which eggs form the principal ingredient, demand, for their successful manufacture, an experienced cook. They are the prettiest, but most difficult of all entremets. The mosfc essential thing to insure success is to secure the best ingredients from an honest tradesman. The entremets coming within the above classification, are healthy, nourishing, and pleasant to the taste, and may be eaten with safety by persons of the most delicate storaaohs,RECIPESo CHAPTER XXIX. BAKED APPLE CUSTARD. 1389. Ingredients.—1 dozen large apples, moist sugar to taste, 1 small teacupful of cold water, the grated rind of one lemon, 1 pint of milk, 4 eggs, 2 oz. of loaf sugar. 3Iode.—Vcel, cut, and core the apples ; put them into a lined sauce- pan with the cold water, and as they heat, bruise them to a pulp ; sweeten with moist sugar, and add the grated lemon-rind. When cold, put the fruit at the bottom of a pie-dish, and pour over it a custard, made with the above proportion of milk, eggs, and sugar; grate a little nutmeg over the top, place the dish in a moderate oven, and bake from 25 to 35 minutes.

INGREDIENTS.—| lb. of short crust Wo. 1211 or 1212, 9 mode- rate-'Sized apples, the rind and juice of ^ lemon, \ lb. of white sugar, f pint of water, a few strips of candied citron. Mode.—Make a short crust by either of the above recipes; roll ^it out to the thickness of 4 inch, and butter an oval mould; line it with the crust, and press it carefully all round the sides, to obtain the form of the mould, but be particular not to break the paste. Pinch the part that just rises above the mould with the paste-pincers, and fill the case with flour ; bake it for about f hour ; then take it out of the oven, remove the flour, put the case back in the oven for another ^ hour, and do not allow it to get scorched. It is now ready for the apples, which should be prepared in the following manner; peel, and take out the cores with a small knife, or a cutter for the purpose, without dividing the apples; put them into a small lined saucepan, just capable of holding them, with sugar, water, lemon juice and rind, in the above proportion. Let them simmer very gently until tender ; then take out the apples, let them cool, arrange them in the flanc or case, and boil down the syrup until reduced to a thick jelly; pour it over the apples, and garnish them with a few slices of can- died citron. 1392. A MOEE SIMPLE PLANC may be made by rolling out the paste, cutting the bottom of a round or oval shape, and then a narrow strip for the sides : these should be stuck on with the white of an egg, to the bottom piece, and the flanc then filled with raw fruit, with sufficient sugar to sweeten it nicely. It will not require so long baking as in a mould ; but the crust must be made everyv/here of an equal thick- ness, and so perfectly joined, that the juice does not escape. This dish may also be served hot, and should be garnished in the same manner, or a little melted apricot jam may be poured over the apples, which very much improves their flavour. 2Tw6.—Altogether, 1 hour to bake the flanc fror^i 30 to 40 miiiutes to stew the apples very gently.

Put the flour into a basin, stir in the butter, which should be melted to a cream ; add the salt, and moisten with sufficient warm milk to make it of a proper consistency, that is to say, a batter that will drop from the spoon. Stir this well, rub down any lumps that may be seen, and add the whites of the eggs, which have been previously well whisked; beat up the batter for a few minutes, and it is ready for use. JS^ow peel and cut the apples into rather thick whole slices, without dividing them, and stamp out the middle of each slice, where the core is, with a cutter. Throw the slices into the batter; have ready a pan of boiling lard or clarified dripping; take out the pieces of apple one by one, put them into the hot lard, and fry a nice brown, turning them when required- When done, lay them on a piece of blotting-paper before the fire, to absorb the greasy moisture ; then dish on a white d'oyley, piled one above the other; strew over them some pounded sugar, and serve very hot. The flavour of the fritters would be very much improved by soaking the pieces of apple in a little wine, mixed with sugar and lemon-juice, for 3 or 4 hours before wanted for table; the batter, also, is better for being mixed some hours before the fritters are made.

Mode,—Mix to a smooth batter the arrowroot with | pint of the milk ; put the other pint on the fire, with laurel-leaves or lemon-peel, whichever may be preferred, and let the milk eteep until it is v/ell flavoured. Then strain the milk, and add it, boiling, to the mixed arrowroot; sweeten it with sifted sugar, and let it boil, stirring it all the time, till it thickens sufficiently to come from the saucepan. Grease a mould with pure salad-oil, pour in the blane-mange, and when quite set, turn it put on a dish, and pour round it a compote of any kind of fruit, or garnish it with jam. A tabiespoonful of brandy, stirred in just before the blanc-mange is moulded, very much improves the flavour of this sweet dish. Time.—Altogether, ^ hour. Average cost, Qd, without the garnishing.

Let it stand for a few minutes, then pour it into the mould, which should be previously oiled with the purest salad-oil, or dipped in cold water. There will be a sediment at the bottom of the jug, which must not be poured into the mould, as, when turned out, it would very much disfigure the appearance of the blanc-mange. This blanc-mange may be made very much richer by using l| pint of cream, and melting the isinglass in § pint of boiling water. The flavour may also be very much varied by adding bay-leaves, laurel-leaves, or essence of vanilla, instead of the lemon- rind and almonds. Noj^eau, Maraschino, Cura9oa, or any favourite liqueur, added in small proportions, very much enhances the flavour of this always favourite dish. In turning it out, just loosen the edges of the blanc-mange from the mould, place a dish on it, and turn it q^uickly over : it should come out easily, and the blanc-mange have a smooth glossy appearance when the mould is oiled, which it frequently has not when it is only dipped in water.

Mode.—The stock for jellies should always be made the day before it is required for use, as the liquor has time to cool, and the fat can Be so much more easily and efiectually removed when thoroughly set. Procure from the butcher's 2 nice calf's feet; scald them, to take off, the hair; slit them in two, remove the fat from between the claws, and wash the feet well in warm water; put them into a stewpan, with the above proportion of cold water, bring it gradually to boil, and BREAD-AISTD-BUTTEB EBITTEBS. JELLY-MOULD. JELLT-BAG.709 CREAMS, JELLIES, OMELETS, ETC. remove every particle of scum as it rises. When it is well skimmed, boil it very gently for 6 or 7 hours, or until the liquor is reduced rather more than half; then strain it through a sieve into a basin, and put it in a cool place to set. As the liquor is strained, measure it, to ascertain the proportion for the jelly, allowing something for the sediment and fat at the top. To clarify it, carefully remove all the fat from the top, pour over a little warm water, to wash away any that may remain, and wipe the jelly with a clean cloth ; remove the jelly from the sediment, put it into a saucepan, and, supposing the quantity to be a quart, add to it 6 oz. of loaf sugar, the shells and well-whisked whites of 5 eggs, and stir these ingredients together cold; set the saucepan on the fire, but do not stir the jelly after it heginsto tcarm. Let it boil about 10 minutes after it rises to a head, then throw in a teacupful of cold water; let it boil 5 minutes longer, then take the saucepan ofi^, cover it closely, and let it remain I hour near the fire. Dip the jelly-bag into hot water, wring it out quite dry, and fasten it on to a stand or the back of a chair, which must be placed near the fire, to prevent the jelly from setting before it has run through the bag. Place a basin underneath to receive the jelly; then pour it into the bag, and should it not be clear the first time, run it through the bag again. This stock is the foundation of all really good jelliesj which may be varied in innumerable ways, by colouring and flavouring with liqueurs, and by moulding it with fresh and preserved fruits. To insure the jelly being firm when turned out, i oz. of isinglass clarified might be added to the above proportion of stock. Substitutes for calf *s feet are now frequently used in making jellies, which lessen the expense and trouble in preparing this favourite dish; isinglass and gelatine being two of the principal materials employed; but, although they may look as nicely as jellies made from good stock, they are never so delicate, having very often an un- pleasant flavour, somewhat resembling glue, particularly when made with gelatine. Time.—Khowi 6 hours to boil the feet for the stock; to clarify it,— i hour to boil, i- hour to stand in the saucepan covered. Average cosf.—Calf *s feet may be purchased for 6c7. each when veal is in full season, but more expensive when it is scarce. Sufficient—2 calf's feet should make 1 quart of stock. Seasonable from Mai'ch to October, but may be had all the year. How TO MAKE A Jelly-bag.—The very stovit flannel called double-mill, used iov ironing-blankets, is the best material for a jelly-bag: those of home manufacture are the only ones to be relied on for thoroughly clearing the jelly. Care should be taken that the seam of the bag be stitched twice, to secure it against unequal filtration. The most convenient mode of using the bag is to tie it upon a hoop the exact size of the outside ot its mouth and, to do this, strings should be sewu rouud it at equal distances, ThoMODEEN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. 710 jelly-bag may, of course, be made any size; but one of twelve or fourteen inches deep, and seven or eiglit across the mouth, will be sufneient for ordinary use. The form of a jelly-bag is the fool's cap. COW-HEEIj stock fob JELIilES {3Iore Economical than Calf's Feet.) 1412. IiTGEEDiEisTTS.—2 cow-lieels, 3 quarts of water. Jfbt/(?.—Procure 2 heels that have only been scalded, and not boiled; split them in two, and remove the fat between the claw^s; wash them well in warm water, and put them into a saucepan with the above proportion of cold water; bring it gradually to boil, remove all the scum as it rises, and simmer the heels gently from 7 to 8 hours, or until the liquor is reduced one-half; then strain it into a basin, mea- suring the quantity, and put it in a cool place. Clarify it in the same manner as calfs-feet stock ISTo. 1411, using, with the other ingredients, about I oz. of isinglass to each quart. This stock should be made the day before it is required for use. Two dozen shank-bones of mutton, boiled for 6 or 7 hours, yield a quart of strong firm stock. They should be put on in 2 quarts of water, which should be reduced one- half. Make this also the day before it is required. Time.—7 to 8 hours to boil the cow-heels, 6 to 7 hours to boil the shank-bones. j Average cost, from 4^?. to Qd. each. j Suficient—2 cow-heels should make 3 pints of stock. 1 Seasonable at any time. ISII'IGIiASS OB GELATIlSrE JELLT. {Sulstitutes for Calfs Feet.) 1413. Ii^GEEDiENTS.—3 OZ. of isiuglassor gelatine, 2 quarts of vrater. ■ Mode.—Put the isinglass or gelatine into a saucepan with the above proportion of cold water ; bring it quickly to boil, and let it boil very fast, until the liquor is reduced one-half. Carefully remove the scum as it rises, then strain it through a jelly-bag, and it will be ready for use. If not required very clear, it may be merely strained through a fine sieve, instead of being run through a bag. Rather more than ^ oz. of isinglass is about the proper quantity to use for a quart of strong calf's-feet stock, and rather more than 2 oz. for the same quantity of fruit juice. As isinglass varies so much in quality and strength, it is difficult to give the exact proportions. The larger the mould, the stifier should be the jelly ; and where there is no ice, more isinglass must be used than if the mixture were frozen. This forms a stock for all kinds of jellies, which may be flavoured in many ways, Time.—H hour.CREAMS, JELLIES, OMELETS, ETC. 711 Suificient, with wine, syrup, fruit, &c., to fill two moderate-sized moulds. Seasonable at any time. Note.—The above, when boiled, should be pcr.dctly clear, and may be mixed warm with wine, flavourings, fruits, &c., and then run through the bag. Isinglass.'—The best isinp^lass is brought from Hussia; some of an inferior kind is brouglit from North and South America and the East Indies : the several varieties may be had from the -wholesale dealers in isinglass in London. In choosing isinglass for domestic use, select that which is whitest, has no unpleasant odour, and which dissolves most readily in water. The inferior kinds are used for fining beer, and similar purposes. Isinglass is much adulterated: to test its purity, take a few threads of the substance, drop some into boiling-water, some into cold water, and some into vinegar. In the boiling water the isinglass wiU dissolve, in cold water it will become white and " cloudy," and in vinegar it will swell and become jelly-like. If the isinglass is adulterated with gelatine (th-at is to say, the commoner sorts of gelatine,—for isinglass is classed amongst gelatines, of all which varieties it is the very purest and best), in boiling -water the gelatine •will not so completely dissolve as the isinglass; in cold water it becomes clear and jelly- like; and in vinegar'it will harden. Hov/ TO mouijD bottled JSLLIES. 1414. Uncoek the bottle; place it in a saucepan of hot water until the jelly is reduced to a liquid state ; taste it, to ascertain whether it is sufficiently flavoured, and if not, add a little wine. Pour the jelly into moulds which have been soaked in water; let it set, and turn it out by placing the mould in hot water for a minute ; then wipe the outside, put a dish on the top, and turn it over quickly. The jelly should then slip easily away from the mould, and be quite firm. It may bo garnished as taste dictates, TO CliAHIITY SYBUP FOB JEIiLIES. 415. Ingkedieis'ts.--To every quart of water allow 2 lbs. of loaf sugar; the white of 1 egg. Mode—Vut the sugar and water into a stewpan ; set it on the fire, and, when the sugar is dissolved, add the white of the egg, whipped np with a little water. Whisk the whole well together, and simmer very gently until it has thrown up all the scum. Take this off* as it rises, strain the syrup through a fine sieve or cloth into a basin, and keep it for use. CALF'S-PEET JELLY. 1416. Ingesdients.—1 quart of calf's-feet stock No. 1411, i lb. of sugar, i pint of sherry, 1 glass of brandy, the shells and whites of 5 eggs, the rind and juice of 2 lemons, i oz. of isinglass. Jfoc?e.—Prepare the stock as directed in recipe No. 1411, taking careMODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY, 712 to leave the sediment, and to remove all the fat from the surface. Put^ it into a saucepan, cold, without clarifying it; add the remaining ingre- dients, and stir them well together be- fore the saucepan is placed on the lire. Then simmer the mixture gently for i hour, hut do not stir it after it begins to tvarm. Throw in a teacupful of cold Tater, boil for another 5 minutes, and keep the saucepan covered by the side of the fire for about i hour, but do not let it boil again. In simmering, the head or scum may be carefully removed as it rises ; but particular attention must be given to the jelly, that it be not stirred in the slightest degree after it is heated. The isinglass should be added when the jelly begins to boil: this assists to clear it, and makes it firmer for turning out. Wring out a jelly-bag in hot water; fasten it on to a stand, or the back of a chair ; place it near the fire with a basin underneath it, and run the jelly through it. Should it not be perfectly clear the first time, repeat the process until the desired brilliancy is obtained. Soak the moulds in water, drain them for half a second, pour in the jelly, and put it in a cool place to set. If ice is at hand, surround the moulds with it, and the jelly will set sooner, and be firmer when turned out. In summer it is necessary to have ice in which to put the moulds, or the cook will be, very likely, disappointed, by her jellies being in too liquid a state to turn out properly, unless a great deal of isinglass is used. When wanted for table, dip the moulds in hot water for a minute, wipe the outside with a cloth, lay a dish on the top of the mould, turn it quickly over, and the jelly should slip out easily. It is sometimes served broken into square lumps, and piled high in glasses. Earthenware moulds are preferable to those of pewter or tin, for red jellies, the colour and trans- parency of the composition being often spoiled by using the latter. To make this jelly more economically, raisin wine may be substi- tuted for the sherry and brandy, and the stock made from cow-heels, instead of calf s feet. Tijne.~20 minutes to simmer the jelly, ^ hour to stand covered. Average cost, reckoning the feet at 6d, each, 3s. 6d. Sufficient to fill two ij-pint moulds. Seasonable at any time.

Omifc the brandy when the flavour is objected to.713 CREAMS, JELLIE3, O.^ELETS, ETC. Shebrt.—There aro several Idnds of sherry, ns pale and bro^vn, and there arc various degrees of each. Sherry is, iu general, of an amber-colour, and, when good, has a lino aromatic odour, with something of the agreeable bitterness of the peach kernel. Wheu new, it is harsh and fiery, and requires to be mellowed in the wood for four or five years. Sherry has of late got much into fashion in England, from the idea that it is more tree from acid than other wines ; but some careful eiperiments on wines do not fully confirm this opinion. CAIfKEIiONS, or FRIED PUFFS. {Sweet Entremets.) 1417.

Make some good puff-paste, by re- cipe No. 1205; roll it out very thin, and cut it into pieces of an equal size, about 2 inches wide and 8 inches long ; place upon each piece a spoonful of jam, wet the edges with the white of egg, and fold the paste over twice ; slightly press the edges together, that the jam may not escape in the frying; and when all are prepared, fry them in boiling lard until of a nice brown, letting them remain by the side of the fire after they are coloured, that the paste may be thoroughly done. Drain them before the fire, dish on a d'oyley, sprinkle over them sifted sugar, and serve. These cannelons are very delicious made with fresh instead of preserved fruit, such as strawberries, raspberries, or currants: it should be laid in the paste, plenty of pounded sugar sprinkled over, and f olded and fried in the same manner as stated above.

Stand them upright all round the edge; carefully put them so closely together that the white of the egg connects them firmly, and place this case in the oven for about 5 minutes, just to dry the egg. Whisk the cream to a stiff froth, with the sugar, fla- vouring, and melted isinglass ; fill the charlotte with it, cover with a slice of sponge-cake cut in the shape of the mould ; place it in ice, I where let it remain till ready for table; then turn it on a dish, remove I the mould, and serve. 1 tablespoonful of liqueur of any kind, or 4 table- I spoonfuls of wine, would nicely flavour the above proportion of cream. ! For arranging the biscuits in the mould, cut them to the shape I required, so that they fit in nicely, and level them with the mould I at the top, that, when turned out, there may be something firm to rest upon. Great care and attention is required in the turning out of this dish, that the cream does not burst the case; and the edgea of the biscuits must have the smallest quantity of egg brushed over them, or it would stick to the mould, and so prevent the charlotte from coming away properly.

Ingeedients.—1 pint of milk, 5 eggs, 3 oz. of loaf sugar, 3 laurel-leaves, or the rind of i lemon, or a few drops of essence of vanilla, 1 tablespoonful of brandy. 3fode.—Put the milk into a lined saucepan, with the sugar, and whichever of the above flavourings may be preferred (the lemon-rind flavours custards most delici- ously), and let the milk steep by the side of the fire until it is well flavoured. Bring it to the point of boiling, then strain it into a basin; whisk the eggs well, and, when the milk has cooled a little, stir in the eggs, and strain this mixture into a jug. Place this jug in a saucepan of boiling water over the iire; keep stirring the custard one way until it thickens; but on no account allow it to reach the boiling-point, as it will instantly curdle and be full of lumps. Take it off the fire, stir in the brandy, and, when this is well mixed with the custard, pour it into glasses, which should be rather more than three-parts full; grate a little nutmeg over the top, and the dish is ready for table. To make custards look and eat better, ducks' eggs should be used, when obtainable ; they add very much to the flavour and richness, and so many are not required as of the ordinary eggs, 4 ducks* eggs to the pint of milk making a deli- cious custard. When desired extremely rich and good, cream should be substituted for the milk, and double the quantity of eggs used, to those mentioned, omitting the Vvhites.

It is made by scaldinpf the roots when they are green and full of sap, tlien peeling them in cold water, and puttiug^ j tliem into jars, with a rich syrup; in which state we receive them. It should be chosen ot a bright-3^ellow colour, with a little transparency: what is dark-coloured, fibrous, and i stringy, is not good. Ginger roots, fit for preserving, and in size equal to West Indian, j have been produced in the Eoyal Agricultural Garden in Edinburgh. TO MAKE GOOSEBEBil3r FOOL. ' : 1433.

The Citeon belongs to the same species as the lemon, > being considered only as a variety, the distinction be- i tweeu them not being very great. It is larger, and is i less succulent, but more acid : with a little artificial heat, i the citron comes to as great perfection in England as in Spain and Italy. The fruit is oblong, and about five or ij six inches in length. The tree is thorny. The juice forms an excellent lemonade with sugar and water; its uses in punch, negus, and in medicine, are well known. The rind is very thick, and, when candied with sugar, forms an excellent sweetmeat. There are several varieties cultivated in England, one of which is termed the For- TEE CiTEOKs bidden Fruit.

Ingredients.—Rather more than 1^ pint of jelly, a few nice strawberries, or red or white currants, or raspberries, or any fresh fruit that may be in season. Mode,—Have ready the above proportion of jelly, which must be very clear and rather sweet, the raw fruit requiring an additional quantity of sugar. Select ripe, nice-looking fruit; pick off the stalks, unless currants are used, when they are laid in the jelly as they come from the tree. Begin by putting a little jelly at the bottom of the mould, which must harden; then arrange the fruit round the sides of the mould, recollecting that it will he reversed ivhen turned out; jTELLY MouLBED WITH thcu pour lu somo more jelly to cHERuiEs. make the fruit adhere, and, when that layer is set, put another row of fruit and jelly until the mould is full. If convenient, put it in ice until required for table, then wring a cloth in boiling water, wrap it round the mould for a minute, and turn the jelly carefully out. Peaches, apricots, plums, apples, &c., are better for being boiled in a little clear syrup before they are laid in the jelly; strawberries, raspberries, grapes, cherries, and currants are put in raw. In winter, when fresh fruits are not obtainable, a very pretty jelly may be made with preserved fruits or brandy cherries: these, in a bright and clear jelly, have a very pretty effect; of course, unless the jelly be veri/ clear, the beauty of the dish will be spoiled. It may be garnished with the same fruit as is laid in the jelly ; for instance, an open jelly with straw- berries might have, piled in the centre, a few of the same fruit prettily arranged, or a little whipped cream might be substituted for the fruit Ttm^.—One layer of jelly should remain 2 hours in a very cool place, before another layer is added.

Ingredients.—H pint of calf's-feet jelly No. 1416, a few drops of prepared cochineal. Mode—Make M pint of jelly by recipe No. 1416, or, if wished more economical, of clarified syrup and gelatine, flavouring it in any way that may be preferred. Colour one-half of the jelly with a few drops of prepared cochineal, and the other half leave as pale as possible. Have ready a mould well wetted in every part; pour in a small quantity of the red jelly, and let this set; when quite firm, pour on it the same quantity of the pale jelly, and let this set; then proceed in this manner until the mould is full, always taking care to let one jelly set before the other is poured in, or the colours would run one into the other. When turned out, the jelly should have a striped appearance. For variety, half the mould may be filled at once with one of the jellies, and, when firm, filled up with the other: this, also, has a very pretty eflect, and is more expeditiously prepared than when the jelly is poured in small quantities into the mould. Blancmange and red jelly, or blancmange and raspberry cream, moulded in the above manner, look very well. The layers of blancmange and jelly should I be about an inch in depth, and each layer should be perfectly hard- ened before another is added. Half a mould of blancmange and half a mould of jelly are frequently served in the same manner. A few pretty dishes may be made, in this way, of jellies or blancmanges left from the-preceding day, by melting them separately in a jug placed in a saucepan of boiling water, and then moulding them by the foregoing directions. (See coloured plate Si.) Time.—\ hour to make the jelly. Average cost, with calf s-feet jelly, 2s.; with gelatine and syrup, more economical. Sufficient to fill li-pint mould. Seasonable at any time. Note.—In making the jelly, use for flavonring a very pale shcny, or tho colour will be too dark to contrast nicely with the red jelly. LEMOIT BLANCMANGE. M42.

LEMOlSr CREAMS. {Very good.) 1445- Ingredients.—1 pint of cream, 2 dozen sweet almonds, 3 glasses of sherry, the rind and juice of 2 lemons, sugar to taste. Mode.—Blanch and chop the almonds, and put them into a jug with the cream ; in another jug put the sherry, lemon-rind, strained juice, and sufficient pounded sugar to sweeten the whole nicely. Pour rapidly from one jug to the other till the mixture is well frothed; then pour it into jelly-glasses, omitting the lemou-rind. This is a very cool and delicious sweet for summer, and may be made less rich by omitting the almonds and substituting orange or raisin wine for the sherry. Time.—Altogether, \ hour.

Pre- viously to adding the lemon-juice to the other ingredients, ascertain that it is very nicely strained, as, if this is not properly attended to, it is liable to make the jelly thick and muddy. As this jelly is very pale, and almost colourless, it answers very well for moulding with a jelly of any bright hue ; for instance, half a jelly bright red, and the other half made of the above, would have a very good eflect. Lemon jelly may also be made with calf's-feet stock, allowing the juice of 3 lemons to every pint of stock. Time.—Altogether, 1 hour. Average cost, with the best isinglass, 2s. 9J.

Ingeedients.—1 lb. of lump sugar, 2 oz. of isinglass, ij pint of water, the juice of 2 lemons, \ pint of liqueur. 3Iode,—Put the sugar, with 1 pint of the water, into a stewpan, and boil them gently by the side of the lire until there is no scum remain- ing, which must be carefully re- moved as fast as it rises. Boil the isinglass with the other -2- pint of water, and skim it carefully in the same manner. Strain the lemon- juice, and add it, with the clarified isinglass, to the syrup ; put in the liqueur, and bring the whole to the boiling-point. Let the saucepan remain covered by the side of the fire for a few minutes ; then pour the jelly through a bag, put it into a mould, and set the mould in ice until required for table. Dip the mould in hot water, wipe the outside, loosen the jelly by passing a knife round the edges, and turn it out carefully on a dish. Xoyeau, Maraschino, Curayoa, brandy, or any kind of liqueur, answers for this jelly ; and, when made with isinglass, liqueur jellies are usually prepared as directed above.

Mode.—Put the milk into a saucepan, with the lemon-peel and sugar ; bring it to the boiling-point, drop in the macaroni, and let it gradually swell over a gentle fire, but do not allow the pipes to break. The form should be entirely preserved ; and, though tender, should be firm, and not soft, with no part beginning to melt. Should the milk dry away before the macaroni is sufficiently swelled, add a little more. Make a custard by recipe No. 1423 ; place the macaroni on a dish, and730 MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. pour the custard over the hot macaroni; grate over it a little nut- meg, and, when cold, garnish the dish with slices of candied citron. Time.—From 40 to 50 minutes to swell the macaroni. Average cost, with the custard, Is. Sufficient for 4 or 5 persons. Seasonable at any time. IvISRIITGUES. 1451. IyGP.EDiE:%TS.—^ lb. of pounded sugar, the whites of 4 eggs. Mode.—TVhisk the whites of the eggs to a stiff froth, and, with a vrooden spoon, stir in quiclihj the ponnded sugar ; and have some boards thick enough to put in the oven to prevent the bottom of the meringues from acquiriag too much colour. Cut some strips of paper about 2 inches wide ; place this paper on the board, and drop a table- spoonful at a time of the mixture on the paper, taking care to let all the meringues be the same size. In dropping it from the spoon, give the mixture the form of an egg, and keep the meringues about 2 inches apart from each otlier on the paper. Strew over them some sifted sugar, and bake in a moderate oven for \ hour. As soon as they begin to colour, remove them from the oven ; take each slip of papc-r by the two ends, and turn it gently on the table, and, with a small spoon, t^ke out the soft part of each meringue. Spread some clean paper on the board, turn the meringues upside down, and put them into the oven to harden and brown on the other side. When required for table, fill them with whipped cream, favoured with liqueur or vanilla, and sweetened with pounded sugar. Join two of the merin- gues together, and pile them high in the dish, as shown in the annexed drawing. To vary their appearance, finely-chopped almonds or cur- rants may be strewn over them before the sugar is sprinkled over; and they may be garnished with any bright-coloured preserve. Great expedition is necessary in making this sweet dish; as, if the me- ringues are not put into the oven as soon as the sugar and eggs are mixed, the former melts, and the mixture would run on the paper, instead of keeping its egg-shape. The sweeter the meringues are made, the crisper w^ill they be; but, if there is not sufiicient sugar mixed with them, they will most likely be tough. They are some- times coloured with cochineal; and, if kept well covered in a dry place, will remain good for a month or six weeks.CREAMS, JELLIES, OMELETS, ETC. 731 Thne.—Altogether, about ^ hour.

Ingeedients.—6 eggs, 1 saltspoonfiil of salt, i saltspoonful of pepper, 5 lb. of butter. 3fode—Break the eggs into a basin, omitting the whites of 3, and beat them up with the salt and pepper until extremely light; then add 2 oz. of the butter broken into small pieces, and stir this into the mixture. Put .^^f^f^^'^^^^^Z:'^ the other 2 oz. of butter into a frying- -^^^^^S^^^^^P pan, make it quite hot, and, as soon as it "^^"^ ■■ 1 begins to bubble, whisk the eggs, &c. very omelet. briskly for a minute or two, and pour them into the pan; stir the omelet with a spoon one way until the mixture thickens and be- comes firm, and when the whole is set, fold the edges over, so that the omelet assumes an oval form; and when it is nicely brown on one side, and quite firm, it is done. To take off the rawness on the upper side, hold the pan before the fire for a minute or two, and brown it with a salamander or hot shovel. Serve very expe- ditiously on a very hot dish, and never cook it until it is just wanted. The flavour of this omelet may be very much enhanced by adding minced parsley, minced onion or eschalot, or grated cheese, allowing 1 tablespoonful of the former, and half the quantity of the latter, to the above proportion of eggs. Shrimps or oysters may also be added : the latter should be scalded in their liquor, and then bearded and cut into small pieces. In making an omelet, be particularly careful that it is not too thin, and, to avoid this, do not make it in too large a frying-pan, as the mixture would then spread too much, and taste of the outside. It should also not be greasy, burnt, or too much done, and should be cooked over a gentle fire, that the whole of the substance may be heated without drying up the outside. Omelets are sometimes served with gravy; but this should never he poured over them^ but served in a tureen, as the liquid causes the omelet to become heavy and fiat, instead of eating light and soft. In making the gravy, the flavour should not overpower that of the omelet, and should be thick- ened with arrowroot or rice flour. Time.—With. 6 eggs, in a frying-pan 18 or 20 inches round, 4 to 6 minutes. Average cost, 9d, Sufficient for 4 persons. Seasonahle at any time HAM OMELET. {A delicious Brecdjast Dish.) 1457.

Do not add any s'^h to the batter, as the ham is usually sufficiently salt to impart a flavour to the omelet. Good lean bacon, or tongue, answers equally well for this dish; but they must also be slightly cooked previously to mixing them with the batter. Serve very hot and quickly, without gravy.

Mix the ingredients for the omelet the same as in recipe xso. 1456, and when the eggs are well whisked, stir in the pieces of kidney. Make the butter hot in the oiiELET-PAir. frying-pan, and when it bubbles, pour in the omelet, and fry it over a gentle fire from 4 to 6 minutes. When the eggs are set, fold the edges over, so that the omelet assumes an oval form, and be careful that it is not too much done: to brown the top, hold the pan before the fire for a minute or two, or use a salamander until the desired colour is obtained, but never turn an omelet in the pan. Slip it carefully on to a very hot dish, or, what is a much safer method, put a dish on the omelet, and turn the pan quickly over. It should be served the instant it comes from the fire Time,—4 to 6 minutes. Average cost^ \s. Sufficient for 4 persons. Seasonahle at any time. TO MAKE A PLAIN SWEET OMELET. M59.

Note.—To render this clisli more economical, substitute milk or the cream, but add a small pinch of isinglass to make the creams firm. Seville Orange {Citrus vulgaris).—This variety, called also bitter oravge, is of the satr.o species as the sweet orange, and grows in great abundance on the banks of the Guadal- quiver, in Andalusia, whence this fruit is chiefly obtained. In that part of Spain there Sire very extensive orchards of these oranges, wliich form the chief wealth of the monasteries. The pulp of the bitter orange is not eaten raw. In the yellow rind, separated from the white spongy substance immediately below it, is contained an essential oil, which is an agreeable warm aromatic, much superior for many purposes to that of the common orange. The best marmalade and the richest wine are made from tliis orange; and from its flowers the best orange-flower water is distilled. SeviilG oranges are also preserved whole as a sweetmeat. OBANGE PKITTEKS. 1465. Ingredients.—For the batter, i lb. of flour, i oz. of butter, J saltspoonfiil of salt, 2 eggs, milk, oranges, hot lard or clarified dripping. Mode,—Make a nice light batter with the above proportion of flour, butter, salt, eggs, and sufficient milk to make it the proper consist- ency ; peel the oranges, remove as much of the white skin as possible, and divide each orange into eight pieces, without breaking the thin skin, unless it be to remove the pips ; dip each piece of orange in the batter. Have ready a pan of boiling lard or clarified dripping; drop in the oranges, and fry them a delicate brown from 8 to 10 minutes. When done, lay them on a piece of blotting-paper before the fire, to drain away the greasy moisture, and dish them on a white d'oyley; sprinkle over them plenty of pounded sugar, and serve quickly.

Peel the oranges, remove as much of the white pith as possible, and divide them into nice-sized slices, without breaking the thin white skin which sur- rounds the juicy pulp. Place the pieces of orange on small skewers, dip them into the hot sugar, and arrange them in layers round a plain mould, which should be well oiled with the purest salad-oil. The sides of the mould only should be lined with the oranges, and the centre left open for the cream. Let the sugar become iirm by cooling ; turn the oranges carefully out on a dish, and fill the centre with whipped cream, flavoured with any kind of liqueur, and sweetened with pounded sugar* This is an exceedingly ornamental and nice dish for the supper-table.

Ingeediexts.—Eggs, flour, milk; to every egg allow 1 oz. of flour, about 1 gill of milk, ^ saltspoonful of salt. Mode.—Ascertain that the eggs are fresh ; break each one separately in a cup ; whisk them well, put them into a basin, with the flour, salt, and a few drops of milk, and beat the v/hole to a perfectly smooth batter ; then add by degrees the remainder of the milk. The propor- tion of this latter ingredient must be regulated by the size of the eggs, &e. (§:c. ; but the batter, when ready for frying, should be of the consistency of thick cream. Place a small frying-pan on the fire to get hot; let it be delicately clean, or the pancakes will stick, and, when quite hot, put into it a small p bee of butter, allowing about 4 oz. to each pancake. When it is melted, pour in the batter, about i teacupful to a pan 0 inches in diameter, and fry it for about 4 minutes, or until, it is nicely brown on one side. By only pouring ifc a small quantity of batter, and so making the pancakes thin, the necessity of turning them (an operation rather difficult to unskilful cooks) is obviated* "When the pancake is done, sprinkle over it some pounded sugar, roll it np in the pan, and take it out with a large slice, and place it on a dish before the fire. Proceed in this manner until sufficient are cooked for a dish ; then send them quickly to table, and continue to send in a further quantity, as pancakes are never good unless eaten almost immediately they come from the frying-pan. The batter may be flavoured with a little grated lemon-rind, or the pancakes may have preserve rolled in them instead of sugar. Send sifted sugar and a cutCREAMS, JELLIES, OMELETS, ETC. 739 lemon to table with them. To render the pancakes very light, the yolks and whites of the eg^s should be beaten separately, and the whites added the last thing to the batter before frying-. Time.—From 4 to 5 minutes for a pancake that does not require turning ; from 6 to 8 minutes for a thicker one. Average cost^ for 3 persons, 6d.

Tlie former is characterized by a very delicate down, %vhile the latter is smooth; but, as a proof of their identity as to spe- cies, trees have borne peaches in one part and necta- rines in another ; and even a single fruit has had down on one side and the other smooth. The trees are almost exactly alike, as well as the blossoms. Pliny states that the peach was orip^inally brought from Persia, where it grows naturally, from which the name of Persica was bestowed upon it by the Romans; and some modern botanists apply this as the generic name, separating them from Amygdalus, or Almond, to which Linnreus had united them. Although they are not tropical, they require a great deal of warmth to bring them to perfec- tion : hence they seldom ripen in this country, in ordi- nary seasons, without the use of walls or glass; conse- quently, they bear a high price. In a good peach, the flesh is firm, the skin thin, of a deep bright colour next PEACH. ^^^> of a yellowish green next to the wall; the pulp is yellowish, full of highly-fiaToured juice, the fleshy part thick, and the stone small. Too much down is a sign of inferior quality. TMs fruit IS much used at the dessert, and makes a delicious preserve. PEAHS A L'ALLEMANDE. H/O.

Mode.—This elegant dish, although it may appear extravagant, is really not so if made when pineapples are plentiful. "We receive them now in such large quantities from the West Indies, that at times they may be purchased at an exceedingly low rate; it would not, of course, be economical to use the pines which are grown in our English pineries for the purposes of fritters. Pare the pine with as little waste as possible, cut it into rather thin slices, and soak these slices in the above proportion of brandy or liqueur and pounded sugar for 4 hours ; then 1 make a batter the same as for apple fritters, substituting cream for 1 the milk, and using a smaller quantity of flour; and, when this is I ready, dip in the pieces of pine, and fry them in boiling lard from 5 to 8 minutes ; turn them when sufficiently brown on one side, and, when done, drain them from the lard before the fire, dish them on a white d'oyley, strew over them sifted sugar, and serve quickly.

This blancmange is better for being made the day before it is wanted, as it then has time to become firm. If laurel-leaves are used for flavouring, steep 3 of them in the milk, and take them out before the rice is added: about 8 drops of essence of almonds, or from 12 to 16 drops of essence of vanilla, would be required to flavour the above proportion of milk. Time.—From 10 to 15 minutes to boil the rice. Average cost^ 9(L Suffxient to fill a quart mould. Seasonable at any time. EICE CROQUSTTES. 1477- Ingeedients.—i lb. of rice, 1 quart of milk, 6oz. of pounded sugar, flavouring of vanilla, lemon-peel, or bitter almonds, egg and bread crumbs, hot lard. 3fode.—Put the rice, milk, and sugar into a saucepan, and let the former gradually swell over a gentle fire until all the milk is dried up ; and just before the rice is done, stir in a few drops of essence of any of the above flavourings. Let the rice get cold ; then form it into small round balls, dip them into yolk of egg, sprinkle them with bread crumbs, and fry them in boiling lard for about 10 minutes, turning them about, that they may get equally browned. Drain the greasy moisture from them, by placing them on a cloth in front of the fire for a minute or two ; pile them on a white d'oyley, and send them quickly to table. A small piece of jam is sometimes introduced into the middle of each croquette, which adds very much to the flavour of this favourite dish.

When the rice is quite soft, put it into teacups, or small round jars, and let it remain until cold ; then turn the rice out on a deep glass dish, pour over a custard made by recipe Is'o. 1423, and, on the top of each ball place a small piece of bright-coloured preserve or jelly. Lemon-peel or vanilla may be boiled with the rice instead of the essence of almonds, when either of these is preferred ; but the flavouring of the custard must corre- spond with that of the rice.

Mix the ground rice with 6 tablespoonfuls of the milk quite smoothly, and put it into a saucepan with the remainder of the millv and butter, and keep stirring it over the fire for about 5 hour, or until the mixture thickens. Separate the yolks from the whites of the eggs, beat the former in a basin, and stir to them the rice and sufli- cient pounded sugar to sweeten the souflle ; but add this latter ingre- dient as sparingly as possible, as, the less sugar there is used, the lighter will be the souflle.

Ilode.—Mix the potato-flour, or whichever one of the above ingre- dients is used, with a little of the milk ; put it into a saucepan, with the remainder of the milk, the butter, salt, and sufficient pounded sugar to sweeten the whole nicely. Stir these ingredients over the fire until the mixture thickens ; then take it ofl" the fire, and let it cool a little. Separate the whites from the yolks of the eggs, beat the latter, and stir them into the souffle batter. Now whisk the whites of the eggs to the firmest possible froth, for on this depends the excellence of the dish; stir them to the other ingredients, and add a few drops of essence of any flavouring that may be preferred ; such as vanilla, lemon, orange, ginger, &c. &c. Pour the batter into a souffle- sorpFL:6-PAir. dish, put it immediately into the oven, and bake for about i hour; then take it out, put the dish into another more ornamental one, such as is made for the purpose ; hold a salamander or hot shovel over the souffle, strew it with sifted sugar, and send it instantly to table. The secret of making a souffle well, is to have the eggs well whisked, but particularly the whites, the oven not too hot, and to send it to table the moment it comes from the oven. If the souffle be ever so well made, and it is allowed, to stand before being sent to table, its appearance and goodness will be entirely spoiled. Souffles may be flavoured in various ways, but must be named accordingly. Vanilla is one of the most delicate and re- cherche flavourings that can be used for this very fashionable dish.

Ilode.—Put the milk into a saucepan with sufficient sugar to sweeten it nicely, and the rind of | lemon. Let this steep by the side of the fire for -3- hour, when take out the peel; separate the whites from the yolks of the eggs, and whisk the former to a perfectly stilf froth, or until there is no liquid remaining; briog the milk to the boiling-point, and drop in the snow a tablespoonful at a time, and keep turning the eggs until sufficiently cooked. Then place them on a glass dish, beat up the yolks of the eggs, stir to them the milk, add a little mere sugar, and strain this mixture into a jug ; place the jug in a saucepan of boiling water, and stir it one way until the mixture thickens, but do not allow it to bail, or it will curdle. Pour this custard over the eggs, when they should rise to the surface. They make an exceediDgly pretty addition to a supper, and should be put in a cold place after being made. When they are flavoured with vanilla or orange-flower water, it is not necessary to steep the milk. A few drops of the essence of either may be poured in the milk just before the whites are poached. In making the custard, a little more flavouring and sugar should always be added. Ti?ne.—About 2 minutes to poach the whites ; 8 minutes to stir the custard.

Strain the strawberry-juice and water through a bag; measure it, and to every pint allow 1$ oz. of isinglass, melted and clarified inj pint of water. Mix this with the juice ; put the jelly into a mould, and set the mould in ice. A little lemon-juice added to the strawberry-juice improves the flavour of the jelly, if the fruit is very ripe; but it must be well strained before it is put to the other ingredients, or it will make the jelly muddy.

Put the cream into a lined saucepan, with the sugar and lemon-rind, and let it remain by the side of the fire until the cream is well flavoured, when take out the lemon-rind. Mix the arrowroot smoothly with the cold milk; add this to the cream, and let it boil gently for about 3 minutes, keeping it Vv'ell stirred. Take it oft' the fire, stir till nearly cold, when add the lemon-juice, and pour the whole over the cakes. Garnish the cream with strips of angelica, or candied citron cut thin, or bright-coloured jelly or preserve. This cream is exceedingly delicious, flavoured with vanilla instead of lemon ; when this flavouring is used, the sherry may be omitted, and the mixture poured over the drf/ cakes.

Alzjond.—The almond-tree is a native of warmer climates than Britain, and is in- digenous to the northern parts of Africa and Asia; but it is now commonly cultivated in Italy. Spain, and the south of France. It is not usually grown in Britain, and the fruit seldom ripens in this country : it is much admired for the beauty of its blossoms. In the form of its leaves and blossoms it strongly resembles the peach-tree, and is included in the same genus by botanists; but the fruit, instead of presenting a delicious pulp like the peach, shrivels up as it ripens, and becomes only a tough coriaceous covering to the stone inclosing the eatable kernel, which is surrounded by a thin bitter skin. It flowers early in the spring, and produces fruit in August. There are two sorts of almonds,— eweet and bitter; but fiiey are considered to be only varieties of the species; and though the qualities of the kernels are very different, they are not distinguishable by their appearance.750 MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY, AIT EASY WAY OP MAKING A TIPSY CAKE. 1488.

Mode.—The whip to lay over the top of the trifle should be made the day before it is required for table, as the flavour is better, and it is much more solid than when prepared the same day. Put into a large bowl the pounded sugar, the v/hites of the eggs, vvhicli should be beaten to a stiff froth, a glass of sherry or sweet wine, and the cream.

Every one knows/' says Brillat Savarin, in his Plij^siology of Taste/* *' that for twenty years Lladame Recamier was the most beautiful woman in Paris. It is also well known that she was exceedingly charitable, and took a great interest in every benevolent work. Wishing to consult the Curd of respecting the working of an institution, she went to his house at five o'clock in the afternoon, and was much astonished at finding him ah-cady at his dinner-table. Madame Recamier wished to retire, but the Curd would not hear of it. A neat white cloth covered the table ; some good old wine sparkled in a crystal decanter; the porcelain was of the best; the plates had heaters of boiling water beneath tliem ; a neatly-costumed maid-scrvant was in attendance. The repast was a compromise between frugality and luxury. The crawfish-soup had just been removed, and there was on the table a salmon-trout, an omelet, and a salad. ' My dinner will tell you,' said the worthy Cure, with a smile, ' that it is fast-day, according to our Church's regulations.* Madame Rdcamier and her host attacked the trout, the sauce served with which betrayed a skilful lan l, the countenance of the Cure the while showing satisfaction. "And now they fell upon the omelet, which was round, sufficiently thick, and cooked, so to speak, to a hair's-breadth. "As the spoon entered the omelet, a thick rich juice issued from it, plea- sant to the eye as well as to the smell; the dish became full of it; and our fair friend owns that, between the perfume and the sight, it made her mouth water. "' It is an omelette au tlion ' (that is to say, a tunny omelet), said the Curd, noticing, with the greatest delight, the emotion of Madame Recamier, * and few people taste it without lavishing praises on it.* '* * It surprises me not at all,* returned the beauty j 'never has so enticing an omelet met my gaze at 2iny of our lay tables.* " ^My cook understands them well, I think.* " ' Yes,' added Madame, ' I never ate anything so delightful.' " Then came the salad, which Savarin recommends to all who place confidence in him. It refreshes without exciting ; and he has a theory that it makes people yoimger. Amidst pleasant converse the dessert arrived. It consisted of three apples cheese, and a plate of preserves ; and then upon a little round table was serveci the Mocha coffee, for which France has been, and is, so justly famous. " ' I never,' said the Curd,' take spirits ; I always offer liqueurs to my guests but reserve the use of them, myself, to my old age, if it should please Provi dence to grant me that.' " Finally, the charming Madame Recamier took her leave, and told all hec friends of the delicious omelet which she had seen and partaken of." And Brillat Savarin, in his capacity as the Layard of the concealed 3 cMODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. 754: treasures of Gastronomia, has succeeded in witlidrawing" from obscurity tho details of the preparation of which so much had been said, and which he imagines to be as wholesome as it was agreeable. Here follows the recipe :— OMELETTB ATI TKOK". 1494. Take, for 6 jpersons, the roes of 2 carp;* bleach them, by putting them, for 5 minutes, in boiling water slightly salted. Take a piece of fresh tunny about the size of a hen's egg, to which add a small shalot already chopped; hash up together the roe and the tunny, so as to mix them well, and throw the whole into a saucepan, with a sufficient quantity of very good butter: whip it up until the butter is melted ! This constitutes the specialty of the omelet. Take a second piece of butter, d discretion, mix it with parsley and herbs, place it in a long-shaped dish destined to receive tho omelet; squeeze the juice of a lemon over it, and place it on hot embers. Beat up 12 eggs (the fresher the better) ; throw up the saute of roe and tunny, stirring it so as to mix all well together ; then make your omelet in the usual manner, endeavouring to tiuii it out long, thick, and soft. Spread it carefully on the dish prepared for it, and serve at once. This dish ought to be reserved for recherche dejeuners, or for assemblies where amateurs meet who know how to cat well: washed down with a good old wine, it will work wonders. JVote.—The roe and the tunny must be beaten up (saut<5) without allowing them to boil, to prevent their hardening, which would prevent them mixing well with the eggs. Your dish should be hollowed towards the centre, to allow the gravy to concentrate, that it may be helped with a spoon. The dish ought to be slightly heated, otherwise the cold china will extract all the heat from the omelet. * Au Americau writer says he has followed this recipe, substituting pike, shad, &c., in the place of carp, and can recommend all these also, with a quiet conecicnGe. Any fish, indeed, naay be used with success.3 C 2 CHAPTER XXX. GENEBAL OBSEBVATIOISTS OK PBESSKVES, CONPEC- TIOISTABY, ICES, ANT> DESSEBT DISHES. PBESEBVES. 1495. From the nature of vegetable substances, and chiefly from their not passing so rapidly into the putrescent state as animal bodies, the mode of preserving them is somewhat different, although the general principles are the same. All the means of preservation are put in practice occasionally for fruits and the various parts of vegetables, according to the nature of the species, the climate, the uses to which they are applied, &c. Some are dried, as nuts, raisins, sweet herbs, &c. ; others are preserved by means of sugar, such as many fruits whose delicate juices would be lost by drying ; some are preserved by means of vinegar, and chiefly used as condiments or pickles ; a few also by salting, as French beans ; while others are preserved in spirits. Vf e have, however, in this place to treat of the best methods of preserving fruits. Fruit is a most important item in the economy of health ; the epicurean C3. .: scarcely be said to have any luxuries without it; therefore, as it is so in- valuable, when we cannot have it fn.sh, we must have it preserved. It has long been a desideratum to preserve fruits by some cheap method, yet by such as would keep them fit for the various culinary purposes, as making tarts and other similar dishes. The expense of preserving them v.-ith sugar is a serious objection ; for, except the sugar is used in considerable quantities, the success is very uncertain. Sugar also overpov/ers and destroys the sub-acid taste so desirable in many fi-uits: those which are preserved in this manner are chiefly intendedMODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. 755 for the dessert. Fruits intended for preservation should be gathered in tho morning, in dry weather, with the morning sun upon them, if possible ; they will then have their fullest flavour, and keep in good condition longer than v/hen gathered at any other time. Until fruit can be used, it should be placed in the dairy, an ice-house, or a refrigerator. In an ice-house it will remain fresh and plump for several days. Fruit gathered in wet or foggy weather will soon be mildewed, and be of no service for preserves. 1496. Having secured the first and most important contribution to tho manufacture of preserves,—the fruit, the next consideration is the preparation of the syrup in which the fruit is to be suspended ; and this requires much care. In the confectioner's art there is a great nicety in proportioning tho degree of concentration of the syrup very exactly to each particular case; and they know this by signs, and express it by certain technical terms. But to distinguish these properly requires very great attention and considerable experience. The principal thing to be acquainted with is the fact, that, in proportion as the syrup is longer boiled, its water will become evaporated, and its consistency will be thicker. Great care must be taken in the management of the fire, that the syrup does not boil over, and that the boiling is not carried to such an extent as to burn the sugar. 1497. The first degree 01 consistency is called tJie thread, which is subdivided into the little and great thread. If you dip the finger into the syrup and apply it to the thumb, the tenacity of the syrup will, on separating the finger and thumb, afford a thread, which shortly breaks : this is the little thread. If the thread, from the greater tenacity, and, consequently, greater strength of the syrup, admits of a greater extension of the finger and thumb, it is called the great thread. There are half a dozen other terms and experiments for testing the various thickness of the boiling sugar towards the consistency called caramel; but that degree of sugar-boiling belongs to the confectioner. A solution of sugar prepared by dissolving two parts of double-refined sugar (the best sugar is the most economical for preserves) in one of water, and boiling this a little, affords a syrup of the right degree of strength, and which neither ferments nor crystallizes. This appears to be the degree called smooth by the confectioners, and is proper to be used for the purposes of preserves. The syrup employed should sometimes be clarified, which is done in the fol- lowing manner :—Dissolve 2 lbs. of loaf sugar in a pint of water; add to this solution the white of an egg, and beat it well. Put the preserving-pan upon the fire with the solution ; stir it with a wooden spatula, and, when it begins to swell and boil up, throw in some cold water or a little oil, to damp the boiling; for, as it rises suddenly, if it should boil over, it would take fire, being of a very inflammable nature. Let it boil up again ; then take it off, and remove carefully the scum that has risen. Boil the solution again, throw in a little more cold water, remove the scum, and so on for three or four times successively ; then strain it. It is considered to be sufliciently boiled when some taken up in a spoon pours out like oil.MODERN MODE OF SERVING DISHES.757 PRESERVES, CONFECTIONARY, ETC. 1498. Although sugar passes so easil}'' into the state of fermentation, and is, in fact, the only substance capable of undergoing the vinous stage of that process, yet it will not ferment at all if the quantity be sufficient to constitute a very strong syrup : hence, syrups are used to preserve fruits and other vegetable substances from the changes they would undergo if left to themselves. Before sugar was in use, honey was emj^loyed to preserve many vegetable productions, though this substance has now given way to the juice of the sugar-cane. 1499. The fruits that are the most fit for preservation in syrup are, apricots, peaches, nectarines, apples, greengages, plums of all kinds, and pears. As an example, take some apricots not too ripe, make a small slit at the stem end, and push out the stone; simmer them in water till they are softened and about half done, and afterwards throw them into cold water. When they have cooled, take them out and drain them. Put the apricots into the pre- serving-pan with sufficient syrup to cover them ; let them boil up three or four times, and then skim them ; remove them from the fire, pour them into an earthen pan, and let them cool till next day. Boil them up three days suc- cessively, skimming each time, and they will then bo finished and in a state fit to be put into pots for use. After each boiling, it is proper to examine into the state of the syrup when cold; if too thin, it will bear additional boiling ; if too thick, it may be lowered with more syrup of the usual standard. The reason why the fruit is emptied out of the preserving-pan into an earthen pan is, that the acid of the fruit acts upon the copper, of which the preserving- pans are usually made. From this example the process of preserving fruits by syrup will be easily comprehended. The first object is to soften the fruit by blanching or boiling it in water, in order that the syrup by which it is pre- served may penetrate through its substance. 1500. Many fruits, when preserved by boiling, lose much of their peculiar and delicate flavour, as, for instance, pine-apples ; and this inconvenience may, in some instances, be remedied by preserving them without heat. Cut the fruit in slices about one fifth of an inch thick, strew powdered loaf sugar an eighth of an inch thick on the bottom of a jar, and put the slices on it. Put more sugar on this, and then another layer of the slices, ^and so on till the jar is full. Place the jar with the fruit up to the neck in boiling water, and keep it there till the sugar is completely dissolved, which may take half an hour, removing the scum as it rises. Lastly, tie a web bladder over the mouth of the jar, or cork and wax it. 1501. Any of the fruits that have been preserved in syrup may be converted into dry preserves, by first draining them from the syrup, and then drying them in a stove or very moderate oven, adding to them a quantity of powdered loaf sugar, which will gradually penetrate the fruit, while the fluid parts of the syrup gently evaporate. They should be dried in the stove or oven on a sieve, and turned every six or eight hours, fresh powdered sugar being sifted over753 MODERN nOUSEHOLD COOKERY, them every time they are turned. Afterwards, they are to be kept in a dry ^ situation, in drawers or boxes. Currants and cherries preserved whole in this manner, in bunches, are extremely elegant, and haA^e a fine flavour. In this way it is, also, that orange and lemon chips are preserved. 1502. Marmalades, jams, and fruit ]>astes are of the same nature, and arc now in very general request. They are prepared without difficulty, by at- tending to a very few directions ; they are somev/hat expensive, but may be kept without spoiling for a considerable time. Marmalades and jams differ little from each other : they are preserves of a half-liquid consistency, made by boihng the pulp of fruits, and sometimes part of the rinds, with sugar. The appellation of marmalade is applied to those confitures which are composed of the firmer fruits, as pineapples or the rinds of oranges ; whereas jams are made of the more juicy berries, such as strawberries, raspberries, currants, mulberries, &c. Fruit pastes are a kind of marmalades, consisting of the pulp of fruits, first evaporated to a proper consistency, and afterwards boiled with sugar. The mixture is then poured into a mould, or spread on sheets of tin, and subsequent^ dried in the oven or stove till it has acquired the state of a paste. From a sheet of this paste, strips may be cut and formed into any j shape that may be desired, as knots, rings, &c. Jams require the same care and attention in the boiling as marmalade; the slightest degree of burning communicates a disagreeable em.pyreumatic taste, and if they are not boiled sufficiently, they will not keep. That they may keep, it is necessary not to be sparing of sugar. 1503. In all the operations for preserve-making, when the preserving-pan is used, it should not be placed on the fire, but on a trivet, unless the jam is made on a hot p»late, when this is not necessary. If the pan is placed close on to the fire, the preserve is very liable to burn, and the colour and flavour be consequently spoiled, 1504. Fruit jellies are compounds of the juices of fruits combined with sugar, concentrated, by boiling, to such a consistency that tho liquid, upon cooling, assumes the form of a tremulous jelly. 1505. Before fruits are candied, they must first be boiled in syrup, after which they are taken out and dried on a stove, or before the fire; the syrup is then to be concentrated, or boiled to a candy height, and the fruit dipped in it, and again laid on the stove to dry and candy : they are then to be put into boxes, and kej)t dr}--. 1506. Conserves consist of fresh vegetable matters beat into a uniform mass with refined sugar, and they are intended to preserve the virtues and properties of recent flowers, leaves, roots, peels, or fruits, unaltered, and as near as possible to what they vrere when fresh gathered, and to give them an agree- able taste.PRESERVES, CONFECTIONARY, ETC. 759 1507. The last-mentioned, but not the least-important preparation of fruit, is the compote, a confiture made at the moment of need, and with much less sugar than would be ordinarily put to preserves. They are most wholesome things, suitable to most stomachs which cannot accommodate themselves to raw fruit or a large portion of sugar : they are the happy medium, and far better than ordinary stewed fruit. COITFECTIONARY. 1508. In speaking of confectionary, it should be remarked that all the vai'ious preparations above named come, strictly speaking, under that head; for the various fruits, flowers, herbs, roots, and juices, which, when boiled with sugar, were formerly employed in pharmacy as well as for sweetmeats, were called confections, from the Latin word conficere, 'to make up but the term confectionary embraces a very large class indeed of sweet food, many kinds of which should not be attempted in the ordinary cuisine. The thousand and one ornamental dishes that adorn the tables of the wealthy should bo purchased from the confectioner : they cannot profitably be made at home Apart from these, cakes, biscuits, and tarts, &c., the class of sweetmeats called confections m.ay be thus classified:—1. Liquid coiifects, or fruits either whole or in pieces, preserved by being immersed in a fluid transparent syrup ; as the liquid confects of apricots, green citrons, and many foreign fruits. 2. Dry confects are those which, after having been bciled in the syrup, are taken out and put to. dry in an oven, as citron and orange-peel, &c. 3. Mar- malade, jams, and pastes, a kind of soft compounds made of the pulp of fruits or other vegetable substances, beat up with sugar or honey; such as oranges, apricots, pears, &c. 4. Jellies are the juices of fruits boiled with sugar to a pretty thick consistency, so as, upon cooling, to form a trembling jelly; as currant, gooseberry, apple jelly, &c. 5. Conservc-5 are a kind of dry confects, made by beating up flowers, fruits, &c., with sugar, not dissolved. 6. Candies are fruits candied over with sugar after having been boiled in the syrup. DESSERT DISHES. 1509. With moderns the dessert is not so profuse, nor does it hold the same relationship to the dinner that it held with the ancients,—the Romans more especially. On ivory tables they would spread hundreds of different kinds of raw, cooked, and preserved fruits, tarts and cakes, as substitutes for the more substantial comestibles with which the guests were satiated. However, as late as the reigns of oui' two last Georges, fabulous sums were often expended upon fanciful desserts. The dessert certainly repays, in its general effect, the expenditure upon it of much pains ; and it may be said, that if there bo any poetry at all in meals, or the process of feeding, there is poetry in the760 MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERT, dessert, the materials for ^hich sliould be selected with taste, and, of course, must depend, in a great measure, upon the season. Pines, melons, grapes, peaches, nectarines, plums, strawberries, apples, pears, oranges, almonds, raisins, figs, walnuts, filberts, medlars, cheriies, &c, &c., all kinds of dried fruits, and choice and delicately-flavoured cakes and biscuits, make up the dessert, together with the most costly and recherche wines. The shape of the dishes varies at different periods, the prevailing fashion at present being oval and circular dishes on stems. The patterns and colours are also subject to changes of fashion ; some persons selecting china, chaste in pattern and colour; others, elegantly-shaped glass dishes on stems, with gilt edges. The beauty of the dessert services at the tables of the wealthy tends to enhance the splendour of the plate. The general mode ot putting a dessert on table, now the elegant tazzas are fashionable, is, to place them down the middle of the table, a tall and short dish alternately ; the fresh fruits being arranged on the tall dishes, and dried fruits, bon-bons, &c., on small round or oval glass plates. The garnishing needs especial attention, as the contrast of the brilliant-coloured fruits with nicely-arranged foliage is verj^ charming. The garnish^ar excellence for dessert is the ice-plant; its crystallized dew drops producing a marvellous effect in the height of summer, giving a most inviting sense of coolness to the fruit it encircles. The double-edged mallow, strawberry, and vine leaves have a pleasing effect; and for winter desserts, the bay, Cuba, and laurel are sometimes used. In town, the expense and difficulty of obtaining natural foliage is great, but paper and composite leaves are to be purchased at an almost nominal price. Mixed fruits of the larger sort are now frequently served on one dish. This mode admits of the display of much taste in the arrangement of the fruit: for instance, a pine in the centre of the dish, surrounded with large plums of various sorts and colours, mixed with pears, rosy-cheeked apples, all arranged with a due regard to colour, have a very good effect. Again, apples and pears look well mingled with plums and grapes, hanging from the border of the dish in a neglige sort of manner, with a large bunch of the same fruit lying on the top of the apples. A dessert would not now be considered complete without candied and preserved fruits and confections. The candied fruits may be purchased at a less cost than they can be manufactured at home. They are preserved abroad in most ornamental and elegant forms. And since, from the facilities of travel, T\re have become so familiar with the tables of the French, chocolate in dif- ferent forms is indispensable to our desserts. ICES. 510. Ices are composed, it is scarcely necessary to say, of congealed cream or water, combined sometimes with liqueurs or other flavouring ingi'edients, or more generally with the juices of fruits. At desserts, or at some evening pi'i-ties, ices are scarcely to be dispensed with. The principal utensils required for making ice-creams are ice-tubs, freezing-pots, spaddles, and761 PRESERVES, CONFECTIONARY, ETC. Tv cellaret. The tub must be large enough to contain about a bushel of ice, pounded small, when brought out of the ice-house, and mixed very carefully with either salt, nitre, or soda. The freezing-pot is best made of pewter. If it be of tin, as is sometimes the case, the congelation goes on too rapidly in it for the thorough intermingling of its contents, on which the excellence of the ice greatly depends. The spaddle is generally made of copper, kept bright and clean. The cellaret is a tin vessel, in which ices are kept for a short time from dissolving. The method to be pursued in the freezing process must bo attended to. When the ice-tub is prepared with fresh-pounded ice and salt, the freezing-pot is put into it up to its cover. The articles to be congealed are then poured into it and covered over; but to prevent the ingredients from separating and the heaviest of them from falling to the bottom of the mould, it is requisite to turn the freezing-pot round and round by the handle, so as to keep its contents moving until the congelation commences. As soon as this is perceived (the cover of the pot being occasionally taken off' for the purpose of noticing when freezing takes place), the cover is immediately closed over it, ice is jDut upon it, and it is left in this state till it is served. The use of the si^addle is to stir up and remove from the sides of the freezing-pot the cream, which in the shaking may have washed against it, and by stirring it in with the rest, to prevent waste of it occurring. Any negligence in stirring the contents of the freezing-pot before congelation takes place, will destroy the whole : either the sugar sinks to the bottom and leaves the ice insufficiently sweetened, or lumps are formed, which disfigure and discolour it. 1511. The aged, the delicate, and children should abstain from ices or iced beverages ; even the strong and healthy should i^artake of them in modera- tion. They should be taken immediately after the repast, or some hours after, because the taking these substances during the process of digestion is apt to provoke indisposition. It is necessary, then, that this function should have scarcely commenced, or that it shuuld be completely finished, before partaking of ices. It is also necessary to abstain from them when persons are very warm, or immediately after taking violent exercise, as in some cases they have produced illnesses which have ended fatally. [Do ladies know to whom they are indebted for the introduction of ices, wliich all the fair sex are passionately fond of?—To Catherine de' Medici. Will not this fact cover a multitude of sins committed by the instigator ot St. Bartholomew ?]RECIPES, CHAPTEE XXXI. TO MAKE SYBUP FOR COMPOTES, &c. 1512. Ingeedients.—To every lb. of sugar allow li pint of water. Mode.—Boil the sugar and water together for \ hour, carefully remoYing the scum as it rises : the syrup is then ready for the fruit. The articles boiled in this syrup will not keep for any length of time, it being suitable only for dishes intended to be eaten immediately. A larger proportion of sugar must be added for a syrup intended to keep. Time.—\ hour. TO CLARIFY SUGAR OR SYRUP. 1513. Ingeedients.—To every lb. of sugar allow J pint of water and k the white of an egg. 3Iode.—Put the sugar, water, and the wh ite of the egg, which should be well beaten, into a preserving-pan or lined saucepan; and do not put it on the fire till the sugar is dissolved. Then place it on the fire, and when it boils, throw in a teacupful of cold water, and do not stir the sugar after this is added. Bring it to the boiling-point again, and then place the pan by the side of the fire, for the preparation to settle. Eemove all the scum, and the sugar will be ready for use. The scum should be placed on a sieve, so that what syrup runs from it may be boiled up again: this must also be well skimmed. Ti7ne.—20 minutes for the sugar to dissolve ; 5 minutes to boil. JS^ote.—The above two recipes are those used in the preparation of dishes usually made at home. There are many degrees of boiling sugar^, which pro- cess requires great care, attention, and experience. Caramel sugar, which makes an elegant cover for sweetm.eats, is difficult to prepare, and is best left to an experienced confectioner. We give the recipe, for those of our readers who care to nttempt the operation.rRESERVES, CONFECTIONARY, ETC. i TO BOIL SUGAK TO CABAMEL. 1514. Ingeedients.—To every lb. of lump sugar allow 1 gill of spring water. Mode.—Boil the sugar and water together very quickly over a clear fire, skimming it very carefully as soon as it boils. Keep it boiling until the sugar snaps when a little of it is dropped in a pan. of cold water. If it remains hard, the sugar has attained the right degree; then squeeze in a little lemon-juice, and let it remain an instant on the fire. Set the pan into another of cold water, and tho caramel is then ready for use. The insides of well-oiled moulds are often ornamented with this sugar, which with a fork should be spread over them in fine threads or network. A dish of light pastry, tastefully arranged, looks very prettily with this sugar spun lightly over it. The sugar must be carefully watched, and taken up the instant it is done. Unless the cook is very experienced and tho- roughly understands her business, it is scarcely worth while to attempt to make this elaborate ornament, as it may be purchased quite as economically at a confectioner's, if the failures in the preparation are taken into consideration.

Another method of drying cherries is to stone them, and to put them into a preserving-pan, with plenty of loaf sugar strewed amongst them. They should be simmered till the fruit shrivels, when they should be strained from the juice. The cherries should then be placed in an oven, cool enough to dry without baking them. About 5 oz. of sugar would be reqviired for 1 lb. of cherries, and the same syrup may be used again to do another quantity of fruit. CHERRY JAM. 1528. Ingredients.—To every lb. of fruit, weighed before stoning, allow h lb. of sugar; to every 6 lbs. of fruit allow 1 pint of red-currant juice, and to every pint of juice 1 lb. of sugar. 3Iode.—Weigh the fruit before stoning, and allow half the weight of sugar; stone the cherries, and boil them in a preserving-pan until nearly all the juice is dried up ; then add the sugar, which should be crushed to powder, and the currant-juice, allowing 1 pint to every 6 lbs. of cherries (original weight), and 1 lb. of sugar to every pint of juice. Boil all together until it jellies, which will be in from 20 minutes to ihour; skim the jam well, keep it well stirred, and, a few minutes before it is done, crack some of the stones, and add the kernels : these impart a very delicious flavour to the jam. Time.—According to the quality of the cherries, from f to 1 hour to boil them; 20 minutes to i hour with the sugar. Average cost, from 7d. to 8c?. per lb. pot. Sufficient,—1 pint of fruit for a lb. pot of jam. Seasonable.—Make this in July or August. ' ^ 3 D770 MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY, TO PBESERVE! OHESIIIES IN SYBUP, ( Very delicious.) 1529. Ingeedients.—4 lbs. of cherries, 3 lbs. of sugar, 1 pint of white - currant juice. Mode.—Let the cherries be as clear and as transparent as possible, and perfectly ripe; pick off the stalks, and remove the stones, dam- aging the fruit as little as you can. Make a syrup with the above proportion of sugar, by recipe No. 1512; mix the cherries with it, and boil them for about 15 minutes, carefully skimming them; turn them gently into a pan, and let them remain till the next day; then drain the cherries on a sieve, and put the syrup and white-currant juice into the preserving-pan again. Boil these together until the syrup is somewhat reduced and rather thick; then put in the cherries, and let them boil for about 5 minutes; take them off the fire, skim the syrup, put the cherries into small pots or wide-mouthed bottles; pour the syrup over, and when quite cold, tie them down carefully, so that the air is quite excluded. Time,—15 minutes to boil the cherries in the syrup; 10 minutes to boil the syrup and currant-juice; 5 minutes to boil the cherries the second time. Average cost for this quantity, 35. 6d. Seasonable.—Make this in July or August. % BLACK-CUIlBAiN-T JAM. 1530. Ikgeedients.—To every lb. of fruit, weighed before being stripped from the stalks, allow f lb. of loaf sugar, 1 gill of water. Mode.—Let the fruit be very ripe, and gathered on a dry day. Strip it from the stalks, and put it into a preserving-pan, with a gill of water to each lb. of fruit; boil these together for 10 minutes; then add the sugar, and boil the jam again for 30 minutes, reckoning from the time when the jam simmers equally all over, or longer, should it not appear to set nicely when a little is poured on to a plate. Keep stirring it to prevent it from burning, carefully remove all the scum, and when done, pour it into pots. Let it cool, cover the top of the jam with oiled laper, and the top of the jars with a piece of tissue-paper brushed over on both sides with the white of an egg: this, when cold, forms a hard stiff cover, and perfectly excludes the air. Great attention must be paid to the stirring of this jam, as it is very liable to burn, on account of the thickness of the j uice. Twie.—lO minutes to boil the fruit and water; 30 minutes with the sugar, or longer.771 PRESERVES, CONFECTIONARY, ETC. Average cost^ from Qd. to 8f7. for a pot capable of holding" 1 lb. Sufficient—kWovf from 6 to 7 quarts of currants to make 1 dozen pots of jam, each pot to hold 1 lb. Seasonable.—Make this in July. BLACK-OUilllAlSrT JELLY. 1531. Ingredients.—Black currants; to every pint of juice allow i pint of water, 1 lb. of loaf sugar. Mode,—Strip the currants frora the stalks, which may be done in an expeditious manner, by holding the bunch in one hand, and passing a small silver fork down the currants: they will then readily fall from the stalks. Put them into a jar, place this jar in a saucepan of boiling water, and simmer them until their juice is extracted; then strain them, and to every pint of juice allow the above proportion of sugar and water; stir these ingredients together cold until the sugar is dissolved; place the preserving-pan on the fire, and boil the jelly for about i hour, reckoning from the time it commences to boil all over, and carefully remove the scum as it rises. If the jelly becomes firm when a little is put on a plate, it is done ; it should then be put into small pots, and covered the same as the jam in the preceding recipe. If the jelly is wanted very clear, the fruit should not be squeezed dry; but, of course, so much juice will not be obtained. If the fruit is not much squeezed, it may be converted into a jam for immediate eating, by boiling it with a little common sugar: this answers very well for a nursery preserve. Tme.—About I hour to extract the juice ; i hour to boil the jelly. Average cost^ from 8c?. to 10c?. per lb. pot. Sufficient—Yxom 3 pints to 2 quarts of fruit should yield a pint of juice. Seasonable.—Make this in July. HED-CURIlAlSrT JAM. 1532. Ingredients.—To every lb of fruit allow f lb. of loaf sugar. Mode.—Let the fruit be gathered on a fine day; weigh it, and then strip the currants from the stalks ; put them into a preserving-pan with sugar in the above propor- tion ; stir them, and boil them for about J hour. Carefully remove the scum as it rises. Put the jam into pots, and, when cold, cover with oiled papers; over these put a piece of tissue-paper brushed over on both sides with the white of an egg ; press the paper round the top of the pot, and, when dry, the jam-pot. covering will be quite hard and air-tight. _ 3 D 2772 MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. Time.—^ to % hour, reckoning from the time the jam hoils all over. Average cost, for a lb. pot, from 6d. to 8^?. Sufficient.—Allow from 6 to 7 quarts of currants to make 12 1-lb. pots of jam. Seasonable.—Make this in July. BED-OURKANT JELLY. 1533. Ingredients.-—Eed currants; to every pint of juice allow J lb. of loaf sugar. Mode,—Have the fruit gathered in fine weather ; pick it from the stalks, put it into a jar, and place this jar in a saucepan of boiling water over the fire, and let it simmer gently until the juice is well drawn from the currants; then strain them through a jelly-bag or fine cloth, and, if the jelly is wished very clear, do not squeeze them too mticJif as the skin and pulp from the fruit will be pressed through with the juice, and so make the jelly muddy. Measure the juice, and to each pint allow f lb. of loaf sugar ; put these into a preserving-pan, set it over the fire, and keep stirring the jelly until it is done, carefully removing every particle of scum as it rises, using a wooden or silver spoon for the purpose, as metal or iron ones would spoil the colour of the jelly. When it has boiled from 20 minutes to i hour, put a little of the jelly on a plate, and if firm when cool, it is done. Take it off the fire, pour it into small gallipots, cover each of the pots with an oiled paper, and then with a piece of tissue-paper brushed over on both sides with the white of an egg. Label the pots, adding the year when the jelly was made, and store it away in a dry place. A jam may be made with the currants, if they are not squeezed too dry, by adding a few fresh raspberries, and boiling all together, with sufficient sugar to sweeten it nicely. As this preserve is not worth storing away, but is only for immediate eating, a smaller proportion of sugar than usual will be found enough : it answers very well for children's pud- dings, or for a nursery preserve. Time.—From f to 1 hour to extract the juice; 20 minutes to 4 hour to boil the jelly. Average cost^ from 8d. to 10c?. per i-lb. pot. Sufficient.—8 quarts of currants will make from 10 to 12 pots of jelly. Seasonable.—Make this in July. J}^ote.—Should the above proportion of sugar not be found sufficient for some tastes, add an extra | lb. to every pint of juice, making altogether 1 lb. WHITE-CUBIIAIMT JELLY. 1534. Ingeedients.—White currants; to every pint of juice allow fib. of good loaf sugar.PREBERVES^ CO^'FECTIONARY; ETC. 773 Mode.—Pick the currants from the stalks, and put them into a jar ; place this jar in a saucepan of hoiling- water, and simmer until the juice is well drawn from the fruit, which will be in from f to 1 hour. Then strain -the currants through a fine cloth or jelly-hag; do not squeeze them too much, or the jelly will not he clear, and put the juice into a very clean preserving-pan, with the sugar. Let this simmer gently over a clear fire until it is firm, and keep stirring and skimming until it is done; then pour it into small pots, cover them, and store away in a dry place. Time.—'I hour to draw the juice ; ^ hour to boil the jelly. Average cost, from Sd. to lOt^. per -^-Ib. pot. Sufficient—From 3 pints to 2 quarts of fruit should yield 1 pint of juice. Seasonable in July and August. BAKED DAMSONS FOB WINTEB USS. 1535. iNaREDiENTS.—To cvery lb, of fruit allow 6 oz. of pounded sugar ; melted mutton suet. Mode.—Choose sound fruit, not too ^ipe ; pick off the stalks, weigh it, and to every lb. allow the above proportion of pounded sugar. Put the fruit into large dry stone jars, sprinkling the sugar amongst it ; cover the jars with saucers, place them in a rather cool oven, and bake the, fruit until it is quite tender. Yfhen cold, cover the top of the fruit with a piece of white paper cut to the size of the jar; pour over this melted mutton suet about an inch thick, and cover the tops of the jars with thick brown paper, well tied down. Keep the jars in a cool dry place, and the fruit will remain good till the following Christmas, but not much longer. Time.—From 5 to 6 hours to bake the damsons, in a very cool oven. Seasonable in September and October. DAMSON CHEESE. 1536.

Put the fruit and sugar into a preserving-pan; keep stirring them gently until the sugar is dissolved, and carefully remove the scum as it rises. Boil the jam for about an hour, reckoning from the time it commences to simmer all over alike : it must be well stirred all the time, or it will be liable to burn and stick to the pan, which will cause the jam to have a very disagreeable flavour. "When the jam looks firm, and the juice appears to set, it is doneo Then take it ofl'the fire, put into pots, cover it down, when quite cold, with oiled and egged papers, the same as in recipe Ho. 1530, and store it away in a dry place.

Ikgrediefts.—Fresh fruits, such as currants, raspberries, cherries, gooseberries, plums of all kinds, damsons, &c.; wide-mouthed glass bottles, new corks to fit them tightly. 3Iode.—Let the fruit be full grown, but not too ripe, and gathered in dry weather. Pick it off the stalks without bruising or breaking the skin, and reject any that is at all blemished : if gathered in the damp, or if the skins are cut at all, the fruit will mould. Have ready some perfectly dry glass bottles, and some nice new soft corks or bungs; burn a match in each bottle, to exhaust the air, and quickly place the fruit in to be preserved; gently cork the bottles, and put them into a very cool oven, where let them remain until the fruit has shrunk away a fourth part. Then take the bottles out; do not open them, but immediately beat the corks in tight, cut off the tops, and cover them with melted resin. If kept in a dry place, the fruit will remain good for months; and on this principally depends the success of the preparation; for if stored away in a place that is in the least damp, the fruit will soon spoil, 2'ime.—From 5 to 6 hours in a very slow oven. H. 1543. INGREDIENTS.—-Any kind of fresh fruit, such as currants, cherries, gooseberries, all kinds of plums, &c.; wide-mouthed glass bottles, new corks to fit them tightly. 3Iode.—The fruit must be full-grown, not too ripe, and gathered on a fine day.

Tie over the tops of the bot- tles pieces of bladder; stand the bottles in a large pot, copper, or boiler, with cold water to reach to their necks; kindle a fire under, let the water boil, and as the bladders begin to rise and puff, prick them. As soon as the water boils, extinguish the fire, and let the bottles remain where they are, to become cold. The next day remove the bladders, and strew over the fruit a thick layer of pounded sugar; fit the bottles with corks, and let each cork lie close at hand to its 4)wn bottle. Hold for a few moments, in the neck of the bottle, two777 PRESERVES, CONFECTIONARY, ETC. or three lighted matches, and when they have filled the hottle neck with gas, and before they go out, remove them very quickly; instantly cork the bottle closely, and dip it in bottle cement. Time,—Altogether about 8 hours. TO BOTTLE FRESH FRUIT WITH SUGAR. {Very useful in Winter.) 1544. Ingredients.—Any kind of fresh fruit; to each quart bottle allow i lb. of pounded sugar. Mode.—Let the fruit be gathered in dry weather. Pick it carefully, and drop it into clean and vert/ dry quart glass bottles, sprinkling over it the above proportion of pounded sugar to each quart. Put the corks in the bottles, and place them in a copper of cold water up to their necks, with small hay-wisps round them, to prevent the bottles from knocking together. Light the fire under, bring the water gradu- ally to boil, and let it simmer gently until the fruit in the bottles is reduced nearly one third. Extinguish the fire, and let the bottles remain in the water until it is perfectly cold; then take them out, make the corks secure, and cover them with melted resin or wax. Time,—About ^ hour from the time the water commences to boil.

Ingredients.—To every pint of fruit-juice allow 1 pint of cream; sugar to taste. Mode.—Let the fruit be well ripened; pick it off the stalks, and put it into a large earthen pan. Stir it about with a wooden spoon, break- ing it until it is well mashed; then, with the back of the spoon, rub it through a hair sieve. Sweeten it nicely with pounded sugar; whip the cream for a few minutes, add it to the fruit, and whisk the whole again for another 5 minutes. Put the mixture into the freezing-MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. 782 pot, and freeze in tlie same manner as directed for Ice Pudding, No. 1290, taking care to stir the cream, &c., two or three times, and to remove it from the sides of the vessel, that the mixture may be equally frozen and smooth. Ices are usually served in glasses, but if moulded, as they sometimes are for dessert, must have a small quan- tity of melted isinglass added to them, to enable them to keep their shape. Easpberry, strawberry, currant, and all fruit ice-creams, are made in the same manner. A little pounded sugar sprinkled over the fruit before it is mashed assists to extract the juice. In winter, when fresh fruit is not obtainable, a little jam may be substituted for it: it should be melted and worked through a sieve before being added to the whipped cream; and if the colour should not be good, a little pre- pared cochineal or beetroot may be put in to improve its appearance. Time.—i hour to freeze the mixture. Average cost^ with cream at Is. per pint, 4«?. each ice. Seasonahhf with fresh fruit, in June, July, and August. TO MAKE PBUIT-WATER ICES. 1556. Ingredients.—To every pint of fruit-juice allow 1 pint of syrup made by recipe No. 1513. Mode,—Select nice ripe fruit; pick off the stalks, and put it into a large earthen pan, with a little pounded sugar strewed over ; stir it about with a wooden spoon until it is well broken, then rub it through a hair sieve.

Proceed as directed for Ice Paddings, iNo. 1290, and when the mixture is equally frozen, put it into small glasses. Raspberry, strawberry, currant, and other fresh-fruit-water ices, are made in the same manner. Ti7ne,—i hour to freeze the mixture. Average costf Sd. to 4d. each. Seasonable, with fresh fruit, in June, July, and August. LEMOW-WATER ICE. 1557- Ingredients.—To every pint of syrup, made by recipe No. 1513, allow ^ pint of lemon-juice; the rind of 4 lemons. 3Iode.—Rub the sugar on the rinds of the lemons, and with it make the syrup by recipe No. 1513, omitting the white of egg. Strain the lemon-juice, add it to the other ingredients, stir well, and put the mixture into a freezing-pot. Freeze as directed for Ice Pudding, No.783 PRESERVES, CONFECTIONARY, ETC. 1290, and, when tlie mixture is thorouglily and equally frozen, put it into ice-glasses. Time.—i hour to freeze the mixture. Average cosf^ Sd, to id. each. Seasonable at any time. ICED CURRANTS, for Dessert. 1558. Ii?"aKEDiENTS.—$ pint of water, the whites of 2 eggs, currants, pounded sugar. Select very fine bunches of red or white currants, and well beat the whites of the eggs. Mix these with the water ; then take the currants, a bunch at a time, and dip them in; let them drain for a minute or two, and roll them in very fine pounded sugar. Lay them to dry on paper, when the sugar will crystallize round each currant, and have a very pretty efiect. All fresh fruit may be prepared in the same manner; and a mixture of various fruits iced in this manner, and arranged on one dish, looks very well for a summer dessert. Time.—4 day to dry the fruit. Average cost, 8d. for a pint of iced currants. Seasonahle in summer. MELONS. 1559. This fruit is rarely preserved or cooked in any way, and should be sent to table on a dish garnished with leaves or flowers, as fancy dictates. A border of any other kind of small fruit, arranged round the melon, has a pretty effect, the colour of the former contrast- ing nicely with the melon. Plenty of pounded sugar should be served with it; and the fruit should be cut lengthwise, in moderate-sized slices. In America, it is frequently eaten with pepper and salt. Average cost^—English, in full season, 35. Gd. to 5s. each; when scarce, 10s. to 155.; seasonable, June to August. French, 25. to 35. 6d, each ; seasonable, June and July. Dutch, 9d. to 2s. each; seasonable, July and August. Melon.—The melon is a inosfc delicious fruit, succulent, cool, and high-flavoured. With us, it is used only at the dessert, and is generally eaten with sugar, ginger, or pepper; but, in France, it is likewise served up at dinner as a sauce for boiled meats.^ It grows wild in Tartary, and has been lately found in abundance on the sandy plains of Jeypoor. It was brought originally from Asia by the homans, and is said to have been common in England in the time o\' Edward III., though it is supposed that it was lost again, as well as the cucumber, during the wars of York and Lancaster. The best kind, called the Cantaloupe, from the name of a place near Rome where it was first cultivated in Europe, is a native of Armenia, where it grows so plentifully that a horse-load maybe bought for a crown.

Strain it through a bag, mea-MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. 784 sure it, and to every pint allow the above proportion of sugar and fruit. Put the sugar into the preserving-pan, moisten it with the juice, boil it up, skim well, and then add the mulberries, which should be ripe, but not soft enough to break to a pulp. Let them stand in the syrup till warm through, then set them on the fire to boil gently; when half done, turn them carefully into an earthen pan, and let them remain till the next day; then boil them as before, and when the syrup is thick, and becomes firm when cold, put the preserve into pots. In making this, care should be taken not to break the mul- berries : this may be avoided by very gentle stirring, and by simmer- ing the fruit very slowly. Time.—J hour to extract the juice; i hour to boil the mulberries the fij-st time, ~ hour the second time. Seasonable in August and September. MuLBEREY.—Mulberries are esteemed for their highly aromatic flavour, and their sub-acid nature. They are considered as coohng, laxative, and generally wholesome. This fruit was very highly esteemed by the Eonians, who appear to have preferred it to every other. The mulberry-tree is stated to have been in- troduced into this country in 1548, being first planted at Sion House, where the original trees still thrive. The planting of them was much encouraged by King James I. about 1605; and considerable attempts were made at that time to rear silkworms on a large scale for the purpose of making silk; but these endeavours have always failed, the climate being scarcely warni MULBEEET. CnOUgh. TO PBESERVE MOBELLO CHERRIES. 1561. Ingredients.—To every lb. of cherries allow Ij lb. of sugar, 1 gill of water. Ifode.—Select ripe cherries ; pick off the stalks, and reject all that have any blemishes. Boil the sugar and water together for 5 minutes; put in the cherries, and boil them for 10 minutes, removing the scum as it rises. Then turn the fruit» &c. into a pan, and let it remain until the next day, when boil it all again for another 10 minutes, and, if necessary, skim well. Put the cherries into small pots ; pour over them the syrup, and, when cold, cover down with oiled papers, and the tops of the jars with tissue-paper brushed over on both sides with the white of an egg, and keep in a dry place. Time.—Altogether, 25 minutes to boil. Average cost^ from Sd. to 10c?. per lb. pot. Seasonable,—Make this in July or August. The CniiERT-TEEE ik Eome.—The Cherry-tree was introduced into Rome by Lucnl- lus, about seventy years before the Christian era; but the capital of the world knew notPRESERVES, CONFECTIONARY, ETC. 785 at first how to appreciate this present as it deserved; for the cherry-tree was propagateii 60 slowly in Italy, that more than a century after its introduction it was far from beinjj generally cultivated. The Romans distin<];uished three principal species of cherries—the Apronian, of a bright red, with a firm and delicate pulp ; the Lutatian, very black and sweet; the Ccecilian, round and stubby, and much esteemed. The cherry embellished the third course in Rome and the second at Athens. PEE SERVED NECTARINES. 1562. Ingredients.—To every lb. of sugar allow i pint of water ; nectarines. Mode.—DWidiQ the nectarines in two, take out the stones, and make a strong" syrup with sugar and water in the above proportion. Put in the nectarines, and boil them until they have thoroughly imbibed the sugar. Keep the fruit as whole as possible, and turn it carefully into a pan. The next day boil it again for a few minutes, take out the nectarines, put them into jars, boil the syrup quickly for 5 minutes, pour it over the fruit, and, when cold, cover the preserve down. The syrup and preserve must be carefully skimmed, or it will not be clear. Time—10 minutes to boil the sugar and water ; 20 minutes to boil the fruit the first time, 10 minutes the second time ; o minutes to boil the syrup. Seasoriahle in August and September, but cheapest in September. STEWED NORMANDY PIPPINS. 1563. Ingredients.—1 lb. of Normandy pippins, 1 quart of water, i teaspoonful of powdered cinnamon, I teaspoonful of ground ginger, 1 lb. of moist sugar, 1 lemon. Mode—Woil wash the pippins, and put them into 1 quart of water with the above proportion of cinnamon and ginger, and let them stand 12 hours ; then put these all together into a stewpan, with the lemon sliced thinly, and half the moist sugar. Let them boil slowly until the pippins are half done ; then add the remainder of the sugar, and sim- mer until they are quite tender. Serve on glass dishes for dessert. Time.—2 to 3 hours. Average cost^ Is. Qd, Seasonable.—Suitable for a winter dish. ICED ORANGES. 1564. Ingredients.—Oranges; to every lb. of pounded loaf sugar allow the whites of 2 eggs. Mode.—Whisk the whites of the eggs well, stir in the sugar, and beat this mixture for ^ hour. Skin the oranges, remove as much of the white pith as possible without injuring the pulp of the fruit; pass a thread through the centre of each orange, dip them into the sugar, and tie them to a stick. Place this stick across the oven, and let the 3 R7m MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. oranges remain until dry, when they will have the appearance of balls of ice. They make a pretty dessert or supper dish. Care must be taken not to have the oven too fierce, or the oranges would scorch and acquire a brown colour, which would entirely spoil their appearance. Time.—From J to 1 hour to dry in a moderate oven. Average cost, l\d. each. Sufficient,— \ lb. of sugar to ice 12 oranges. Seasonable from November to May. The Fibst Ora.nge-tkej5 m Fbattce.—The first Orange-tree cultivated in the centra of France was to be seen a few years ago at Fontainebleau. It was called Le Connetable (the Constable), because it had balonj^^ed to the Connetable de Bourbon, and had been confiscated, together with all property belonging to that prince, after his revolt against his sovereign. COMPOTE OF OBAISTGES. 15^5. Ifghebieitts.—1 pint of syrup No. 1512, 6 oranges. Jfbc/g.—Peel the oranges, remove as much of the white pith as pos- sible, and divide them into small pieces without breaking the thin skin with which they are surrounded. Make the syrup by recipe No. 1512, adding the rind of the orange cut into thin narrow strips. When the syrup has been well skimmed, and is quite clear, put in the pieces of orange, and simmer them for 5 minutes. Take them out carefully with a spoon without breaking them, and arrange them on a glass dish. Reduce the syrup by boiling it quickly until thick; let it cool a little, pour it over the oranges, and, when cold, they will be ready for table. Time.—10 minutes to boil the syrup; 5 minutes to simmer the oranges; 5 minutes to reduce the syrup. Average cost, 9d. Sufficient for 5 or 6 persons. f Seasonable from November to May. The Orange in Poetugat,.—The Orange known under the name of "Portugal Orange" comes originally from China. Not more than two centuries ago, the Portuguese brought thence the lirst scion, which has multiplied so prodigiously that we now see entire forests of orange-trees in Portugal. Orange and Cloves.—It appeai-s to have been the custom formerly, in England, to make new year's presents with oranges stuck full with cloves. We read in one of Ben . Jonson's pieces,—the "Christmas Masque,"—" He has an orange and rosemary, but not a clove to stick in it." OBAUGE MABMALADE. I. 1566. Ingredients.—Equal weight of fine loaf sugar and Seville oranges ; to 12 oranges allow 1 pint of water. Jfof/e.-—Let there be an equal weight of loaf sugar and Seville787 PPtESERVES, CONFECTIONARY, ETC. oranges, and allow the above proportion of water to every dozen oranges. Peel them carefully, remove a little of the white pith, and boil the rinds in water 2 hours, changing the water three times to take off a little of the bitter taste. Break the pulp into small pieces, take out all the pips, and cut the boiled rind into chips. Make a syrup with the sugar and water; boil this well, skim it, and, when clear, put in the pulp and chips. Boil all together from 20 minutes to i hour ; pour it into pots, and, when cold, cover down with bladders or tissue-paper brushed over on both sides with the white of an egg. The juice and grated rind of 2 lemons to every dozen of oranges, added with the pulp and chips to the syrup, are a very great improvement to this marmalade. T{7ne.—2 hours to boil the orange-rinds; 10 minutes to boil the syrup ; 20 minutes to J hour to boil the marmalade. A verage cost^ from Qd, to Sc?. per lb. pot. Seasonable.—This should be made in March or April, as Seville oranges are then in perfection. II. 1567. iNaEEDiEKTS.—Equal weight of Seville oranges and sugar ; to every lb. of sugar allow J pint of water. Mode.—"Weigh the sugar and oranges, score the skin across, and take it off in quarters. Boil these quarters in a muslin bag in water until they are quite soft, and they can be pierced easily with the head of a pin; then cut them into chips about 1 inch long, and as thin as possible. Should there be a great deal of white stringy pulp, remove it before cut- ting the rind into chips. Split open the oranges, scrape out the best part of the pulp, with the juice, rejecting the white pith and pips. Make a syrup with the sugar and water ; boil it until clear; then put in the chips, pulp, and juice, and boil the marmalade from 20 minutes to J hour, removing all the scum as it rises. In boiling the syrup, clear it carefully from scum before the oranges are added to it. Time.—2 hours to boil the rinds, 10 minutes the syrup, 20 minutes to i hour the marmalade. Average costy 6d. to Sd. per lb. pot. Seasonable.—^Make this in March or April, when Seville oranges are in perfection. AN EASY" WAY OF MAKING OBANaE MABMALADE. 1568.

Time.—2 hours to boil the rind, i hour the marmalade. Average cost, from 7d. to 9d. per lb. pot. Seasonable,—Make this in March or April. TO PRESEBVE ORANGES. 1570- InGEEDiENTS.—Oranges; to every lb. of juice and pulp allow 2 lbs. of loaf sugar; to every pint of water i lb. of loaf sugar. Mode,—Wholly grate or peel the oranges, taking off only the thin' outside portion of the rind. Make a small incision where the stalk is taken out, squeeze out as much of the juice as can be obtained, and preserve it in a basin with the pulp that accompanies it. Put the oranges into cold water; let them stand for 3 days, changing the water twice; then boil them in fresh water till they are very tender, and put them to drain. Make a syrup with the above proportion of sugar and water, sufficient to cover the oranges ; let them stand in it' for 2 or 3 days ; then drain them well. Weigh the juice and pulp, allow double their weight of sugar, and boil them together until the scum ceases to rise, which must all be carefully removed; put in thSPRESERVES, CONFECTIONARY, ETC. 789 oranges, boil them for 10 minutes, place them in jars, pour over them the syrup, and, when cold, cover down. They will be fit for use in a week. Time.—3 days for the oranges to remain in water, 3 days in the syrup ; \ hour to boil the pulp, 10 minutes the oranges. Seasonable,—This preserve should be made in February or March, when oranges are plentiful. ORANGE SALAD. IiTGEEDiENTS.—6 orauges, j lb. of muscatel raisins, 2 oz. of pounded sugar, 4 tablespoonfuls of brandy. Mode.—Peel 5 of the oranges ; divide them into slices without breaking the pulp, and arrange them on a glass dish. Stone the raisins, mix them with the sugar and brandy, and mingle them with the oranges. Squeeze the juice of the other orange over the whole, and the dish is ready for table. A little pounded spice may be put in when the flavour is liked; but this ingredient must be added very sparingly. Average cost^ Is. Sufficient for 5 or 6 persons. Seasonable from November to May. COMPOTE OF PEACHES. 157-2. Ingredients.—1 pint of syrup No. 1512, about 15 small peaches. Mode.—Peaches that are not very large, and that would not look well for dessert, answer very nicely for a compote. Divide the peaches, take out the stones, and pare the fruit; make a syrup by recipe No. 1512, put in the peaches, and stew them gently for about 10 minutes. Take them out without breaking, arrange them on a glass dish, boil the syrup for 2 or 3 minutes, let it cool, pour it over the fruit, and, when cold, it will be ready for table. Time.—10 minutes. Average costy Is. 2d. Sufficient for 5 or 6 persons. Seasonable in August and September. Peach and Nectarine.—The peach and nectarine, which are among the most de- licious of our fruits, are considered as varieties of the same species, produced by culti- vation. The former is characterized by a very delicate down, while the latter is smooth; but, as a proof of their identity as to species, trees have borne peaches on one part and nectarines on another; and even a single fruit has had down on one side, and on the other none : the trees are almost exactly alike, as well as the blossoms, Pliny states that the peach was originally brought from Persia, where it grows naturally. At Montreuil, a village near Paris, almost the whole population is employed in the cultivation of peaches; and this occupation has maintained the inhabitants for ages, and, in consequence, they raise better peaches than anywhere else in France. In Maryland and Virginia, peaches grow nearly wild in orchards resembling forests; but the fruit is of little value for the table, being employed only in fattening hogs and for the distillation of peach brandy. On the east side of the Andes, pftaches grow wild among the cornfields and in the moun.-MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. 790 tains, and are dried as an article of food. The young leaves of tlie peacli are sometimes used in cookei*y, from their agreeable flavour; and a liqueur resembling the fine noyeau of Martinique may be made by steeping them in brandy sweetened with sugar and lined with milk : gin may also be flavoured in the same manner. The kernels of the fruit have the same flavour. The nectarine is said to have received its name from nectar, the particular drink of the gods. Though it is considered as the same species as the peach, it is not known which of the varieties come from the other; the nectarine is by some considered as the superior fruit. PEACHES PBESESVED 11^ BrvAHDY". 1573. Ingredients.—To every lb. of fruit weiglied before being* stoned, allow ^ lb. of finely-pounded loaf sugar ; brandy. 3fode.—Let the fruit be gathered in dry weather; wipe and weigh it, and remove the stones as carefully as possible, without injuring the peaches much. Put them into a jar, sprinkle amongst them pounded loaf sugar in the above proportion, and pour brandy over the fruit. Cover the jar down closely, place it in a saucepan of boiling water over the fire, and bring the brandy to the simmering-point, but do not allow it to boil. Take the fruit out carefully, without breaking it; put it into small jars, pour over it the brandy, and, when cold, exclude the air by covering the jars with bladders, or tissue-paper brushed over on both sides with the white of an egg. Apricots may be done in the same manner, and, if properly prepared, will be found delicious. Time.—Erom 10 to 20 minutes to bring the brandy to the simmer- ing-point. Seasonable in August and September. BAKED PSABS. 1574. Ingeebients.—12 pears, the rind of 1 lemon, 6 cloves, 10 whole allspice ; to every pint of water allow -h lb. of loaf sugar. 3Iode.—Pare and cut the pears into halves, and, should they be very large, into quarters ; leave the stalks on, and carefully remove the cores. Place them in a clean baking-jar, with a closely-fitting lid ; add to them the lemon-rind cut in strips, the juice of i lemon, the cloves, pounded allspice, and sufficient water just to cover the whole, with sugar in the above proportion. Cover the jar down closely, put it into a very cool oven, and bake the pears from 5 to 6 hours, but be very careful that the oven is not too hot. To improve the colour of the fruit, a few drops of prepared cochineal may be added; but this will not be found necessary if the pears are very gently baked. 2Vme.—Large pears, 5 to 6 hours, in a very slow oven. Average cost, Id, to 2d. each. Sufficient for 7 or 8 persons. Seasonable from September to January. Peak.—The pear, like the apple, is indigenous to this country; but the wild pear is ft very unsatisfactory fruit. The best varieties were brought from the East by the Komans,791 PRESEPwYES^ COKEECTIONAEY, ETC. ■who cultivated them with care, and probably introduced some of their best sorts into this island, to which others were added by the inhabitants of the monasteries, TheDutcIi and Fleminfjs, as well as the French, have excelled in the cultivation of the pear, and most of the late varieties introduced are from France and Flanders. The pear is a hardy tree, and a longer liver than the apple : it has been known to exist for centuries. There are now about 150 varieties of this fruit. Though pei-fectly wholesome when ripe, the pear is not so when green ; but in this state it is fit for stewing. An agreeable bevei'age, called perry, is made from pears, and the varieties which are least fit for eating make the best perry, PRESEBVED PBABS. 1575. Ingee-dients.—Jargonelle pears ; to every lb. of sugar allow I pint of water. J/b£?e.—Procure some Jargonelle pears, not too ripe; put them into a stewpan with sufficient water to cover them, and simmer them till rather tender, but do not allow them to break; then put them into cold water. Boil the sugar and water together for 5 minutes, skim well, put in the pears, and simmer them gently for 5 minutes. Eepeat the simmering for 3 successive days, taking care not to let the fruit break, i'he last time of boiling, the syrup should be made rather richer, and the fruit boiled for 10 minutes. "When the pears are done, drain them from the syrup, and dry them in the sun, or in a cool oven; or they may be kept in the syrup, and dried as they are wanted. Time.—h hour to simmer the pears in water, 20 minutes in the syrup. Average cost^ Id. to 2d. each. - Seasonahle,—Most plentiful in September and October. STEWED PEARS. 1576. Ingkedie^tts.—8 large pears, 5 oz. of loaf sugar, 6 cloves, 6 whole allspice, i pint of water, 5 pint of port wine, a few drops of prepared cochineal. Ifode.—TsLve the pears, halve them, remove the cores, and leave the stalks on ; put them into a lined saucepan with the above ingredients, and let them simmer very gently until tender, which will be in from 3 to 4 hours, according to the quality of the pears. They should be watched, and, when done, carefully lifted out on to a glass dish without breaking them. Boil up the syrup quickly for 2 or 3 minutes ; allow it to cool a little, pour it over the pears, and let them get per- fectly cold. To improve the colour of the fruit, a few drops of pre- pared cochineal may be added, which rather enhances the beauty of this dish. The fruit must not be boiled fast, but only simmered, and watched that it be not too much done.792 MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY, Time.—3 to 4 hours. Average cost, Is. Q>d. Sufficient for 5 or 6 persons. Seasonable from September to January. The Bon Chketien Peak.—The valuable variety of pear called Bon Chretien, which comes to our tables in winter, either raw or cooked, received its name through the fol- lowing incident:—Louis XI., king of France, had sent for Saint Francois de Paule from the lower part of Calabria, in the hopes of recovering his health through his intercession. The saint brought with him the seeds of this pear; and, as he was called at court Le Bon Chretien^ this fruit obtained the name of him to whom France owed ita introduction. PINEAPPLE CHIPS. 1577. Ingredients.—Pineapples ; sugar to taste. Mode.—VsiXQ and slice the fruit thinly, put it on dishes, and strew over it plenty of pounded sugar. Keep it in a hot closet, or very slow oven, 8 or 10 days, and turn the fruit every day until dry; then put the pieces of pine on tins, and place them in a quick oven for 10 mi- nutes. Let them cool, and store them away in dry boxes, with paper between each layer. Time.—8 to 10 days. Seasonable,—Foreign pines, in July and August. PEE SERVED PINE APPLE. 1578. Ingredients.—To every lb. of fruit, weighed after being pared, allow 1 lb. of loaf sugar; i pint of water. 3focle.—The pines for making this preserve should be perfectly sound but ripe. Cut them into rather thick slices, as the fruit shrinks very much in the boiling. Pare off the rind carefully, that none of the pine be wasted ; and, in doing so, notch it in and out, as the edge cannot be smoothly cut without great waste. Dissolve a portion of the sugar in a preserving-pan with 5 pint of water ; when this is melted, gradually add the remainder of the sugar, and boil it until it forms a clear syrup, skimming well. As soon as this is the case, put in the pieces of pine, and boil well for at least i hour, or until it looks nearly transparent. Put it into pots, cover down when cold, and store away in a dry place. Time.—i hour to boil the fruit. Average cost, 10c?. to Is. per lb. pot. Seasonable.—Foreign pines, in July and August. The Pineapple in Heathendom,—Heathen nations invented protective divinities for their orchards (such as Pomona, Vertumnus, Priapus, &c.), and benevolent patrons for their fruits : thus, the olive-tree grew under the auspices of Minerva; the Muses cherished the palm-tree, Bacchus the lig and grape, and the pine and its cone were coiise- crated to trie great Cyhele. PKESEBVED PINEAPPLE, for Present Use. 1579. Ingredients.—Pineapple, sugar, water. 3Iode,—Cut the pine into slices i inch in thickness ; peel them, and remove the hard part from the middle. Put the parings and hard793 PRESERVES, CONFECTIONARY, ETC. pieces into a stewpan with sufficient water to cover them, and hoil for i hour. Strain the liquor, and put in the slices of pine. Stew them for 10 minutes, add sufficient sugar to sweeten the whole nicely, and boil again for another J hour; skim well, and the preserve will be ready for use. It must be eaten soon, as it will keep but a very short time. Time.—\ hour to boil the parings in water; 10 minutes to boil the pine without sugar, \ hour with sugar. Average cost,—Foreign pines, Is. to 3s. each ; English, from 2s. to 12s. per lb. Seasonable,—Foreign, in July and August; English, all the year. PLUM JAM. 1580. Ingredients.—To every lb. of plums, weighed before being stoned, allow | lb. of loaf sugar. Mode.—In making plum jam, the quantity of sugar for each lb. of frnit must be regulated by the quality and size of the fruit, some plums requiring much more sugar than others. Divide the plums, take out the stones, and put them on to large dishes, with roughly- pounded sugar sprinkled over them in the above proportion, and let them remain for one day; then put them into a preserving-pan,' stand them by the side of the fire to simmer gently for about i hour, and then boil them rapidly for another 15 minutes. The scum must be carefully removed as it rises, and the jam must be well stirred all the time, or it will burn at the bottom of the pan, and so spoil the colour and flavour of the preserve. Some of the stones may be cracked, and a few kernels added to the jam just before it is done : these impart a very delicious flavour to the plums. The above pro- portion of sugar would answer for Orleans plums; the Imperatrice, Magnum-bonum, and Winesour would not require quite so much. Time.—i hour to simmer gently, J hour to boil rapidly. Best 2}lums for presemng.—^Yiolets, Mussels, Orleans, Imperatrice, Magnum-bonum, and Winesour. Seasonahle from the end of July to the beginning of October. Plums.—The Damson, or Damascene plum, takes its name from Damascus, where it grows in great quantities, and whence it was brought into Italy about 114 B.C. The Orleans plum is from France. The Greengage is called after the Gage family, who first brought it into England from the monastery of the Chartreuse, at Paris, where it still bears the name of Reine Claude. The Magnum-bonum is our largest plum, and greatly esteemed for preserves and culinary purposes. The best sorts of plums are agreeable at the dessert, and, when perfectly ripe, are wholesome; but some are too astringent. They lose much of their bad qualities by baking, and are extensively used, from their cheapness, when in full season, in tarts and presei-ves; but they are not a very wholesome fruit, and should be eaten in moderation. PRESEBVED PLUMS. 1581. Ingeediei^ts.—To every lb. of fruit allow | lb. of loaf sugar; for the thin syrup, \ lb. of sugar to each pint of water.MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY, Mode.—Soieet large ripe plums; slightly prick them, to prevent them from bursting, and simmer them very gently in a syrup made with the above proportion of sugar and water. Put them carefully into a pan, let the syrup cool, pour it over the plums, and allow them to re- main for two days. Having previously weighed the other sugar, dip the lumps quickly into water, and put them into a preserving-pan with no more water than hangs about them ; and boil the sugar to a syrup, carefully skimming it. Brain the plums from the first syrup; put them into the fresh syrup, and simmer them very gently until they are clear; lift them out singly into pots, pour the syrup over, and when cold, cover down to exclude the air. This preserve will remain good some time, if kept in a dry place, and makes a very nice addition to a dessert. The magnum-bonum plums answer for this preserve better than any other kind of plum. Greengages are also very deli- cious done in this manner. Time—ihonv to 20minutes to simmer the plums in the first syrup; 20 minutes to i hour very gentle simmering in the second. Seasonable from August to October. TO PEESEBVE PLUMS BBY. 1582. Ifghedients.—To every lb. of sugar allow i pint of water. Mode.—Gather the plums when they are full-grown and just turn- ing colour ; prick them, put them into a saucepan of cold water, and set them on the fire until the water is on the point of boiling. Then take them out, drain them, and boil them gently in syrup made with the above proportion of sugar and water; and if the plums shrink, and will not take the sugar, prick them as they lie in the pan ; give them another boil, skim, and set them by. The next day add some more sugar, boiled almost to candy, to the fruit and syrup; put all together into a wide-mouthed jar, and place them in a cool oven for 2 nights; then drain the plums from the syrup, sprinkle a little powdered sugar over, and dry them in a cool oven. Time.—Id to 20 minutes to boil the plums in the syrup. Seasonable from August to October. ^ Pltjms.—The wild sloe is the parent of the plum, but the acclimated kinds come from the East. The cultivation of this fruit was probably attended to very early in England, as Gerrard informs us that, in 1597, he had in his garden, in Holboru, threescore sorts. The sloe is a shrub common in our hedgerows, and belongs to the natural order Amyg-^ dalecs; the fruit is about the size of a large pea, of a black colour, and covered with » bloom of a bright blue. It is one of the few indigenous to our island. The juice i8 extremely sharp and astringent, and was formerly employed as a medicine, where astringents were necessary. It now assists in the manufacture of a red wine made to imitate port, and also for adulteration. The leaves have been used to adulterate tea i the fruit, when ripe, makes a good preserve.795 PRESERVES; CONFECTIONARY, ETC. STEWED FRENCH PLUMS. {A Dessert Dish.) 1583.

When it is clear, put in the plums with the port wine, lemon-juice, and rind, and simmer very gently for H hour. Arrange the plums on a glass dish, take out the lemon-rind, pour the syrup over the plums, and, when cold, they will be ready for table. A little allspice stewed with the fruit is by many persons con- sidered an improvement. Tune.—1 hour to stew the plums in water, 1| hour in the syrup. Average cost,—plums sufficiently good for stewing, Is. per lb. Sufficient for 7 or 8 persons. Seasonable in winter. PSE SERVED PUMPKIISr. 1584. Ingredients.—To each lb. of pumpkin allow lib. of roughly pounded loaf sugar, 1 gill of lemon-juice. Mode.—Obtain, a good sweet pumpkin ; halve it, take out the seeds, and pare off the rind ; cut it into neat slices, or into pieces about the size of a five-shilling piece. Weigh the pumpkin, put the slices in a pan or deep dish in layers, with the sugar sprinkled between them ; pour the lemon-juice over the top, and let the whole remain for 2 or 3 days. Boil altogether, adding ^ pint of water to every 3 lbs. of sugar used until the pumpkin becomes tender; then turn the whole into a pan, where let it remain for a week; then drain off the syrup, boil it until it is quite thick ; skim, and pour it, boiling, over the pump- kin. A little bruised ginger and lemon-rind, thinly pared, may be boiled in the syrup to flavour the pumpkin. Time.—From I to J hour to boil the pumpkin tender. Average cost, 5d. to 7d. per lb. pot.

Mode.Slice the quinces into a preserving-pan, adding sufficient water for them to float ; place them on the fire to stew, until reduced to a pulp, keeping them stirred occasionally from the bottom, to prevent their burning ; then pass the pulp through a hair sieve, to keep back the skin and seeds. Weigh the pulp, and to each lb. add lump sugar in the above proportion, broken very small. Place the whole on the fire, and keep it well stirred from the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon, until reduced to a marmalade, which may be known by dropping a little on a cold plate, when, if it jellies, it is done. Put it into jars whilst hot; let it cool, and cover with pieces of oiled paper cut to the size of the mouths of the jars. The tops of them may be afterwards covered with pieces of bladder, or tisssue-paper brushed over on both sides with the white of an egg.

Take off the stalks, put the raspberries into a preserving-pan, break them well with a wooden spoon, and let them boil for \ hour, keeping them well stirred. Then, add the currant-juice and sugar, and boil again for i hour. Skim the jam well after the sugar is added, or the preserve will not be clear. The addition of the currant juice is a very great improvement to this preserve, as it gives it a piquant taste, which the flavour of the rasp- berries seems to require. Time—k hour to simmer the fruit without the sugar; i hour after it is added. Average cost, from 6d. to 8d. per lb. pot. Sufficient.—Allow about 1 pint of fruit to fill a 1-lb. pot. Seasonable in July and August. RASPBERBY JELLY. 1589. Ingkedients.—To each pint of juice allow | lb. of loaf sugar. Mode.—Let the raspberries be freshly gathered, quite ripe, and picked from the stalks ; put them into a large jar, ^fter breaking the fruit a little with a wooden spoon, and place this jar, covered, in a saucepan of boiling water. When the juice is well drawn, which will be in from J to 1 hour, strain the fruit through a fine hair sieve or cloth ; measure the juice, and to every pint allow the above proportion of loaf sugar. Put the juice and sugar into a preserving-pan, place it over the fire, and boil gently until the jelly thickens when a little is poured on a plate ; carefully remove all the scum as it rises, pour the jelly into small pots, cover down, and keep in a dry place. This jelly answers for making raspberry cream, and for flavouring various sweet dishes, when, in winter, the fresh fruit is not obtainable. Time.—f to 1 hour to draw the juice. Average cost, from 9(?. to 15. per lb. pot. Sufficient.—From 3 pints to 2 quarts of fruit should yield 1 pint of juice. Seasonable,—This should be made in July or August.

Ifode.—'Fvmt salads are made by stripping the fruit from the stalks, piling it on a dish, and sprinkling over it finely-pounded sugar. They may be made of strawberries, raspberries, currants, or any of these fruits mixed; peaches also make a very good salad. After the sugar is sprinkled over, about 6 large tablespoonfuls of wine or brandy, or 3 tablespoonfuls of liqueur, should be poured in the middle of the fruit; and, when the flavour is liked, a little pounded cinna- mon may be added. In helping the fruit, it should be lightly stirred^ that the wine and sugar may be equally distributed.presehves, confectiottart. etc. 799 Sufficient.—\h pint of fruit, with 3 oz. of pounded sugar, for 4 or 5 persons.

Select well- ripened but sound strawberries; pick them from the stalks, and when the sugar is dissolved in the currant juice, put in the fruit. Simmer the whole over a moderate fire, from 2^ to f hour, carefully removing the scum as it rises. Stir the jam only enough to prevent it from burning at the bottom of the pan, as the fruit should be preserved as whole as possible. Put the jam into jars, and when cold, cover down. Time.—i to f hour, reckoning from the time the jam simmers all oyer. Average cost, from Id. to ^d. per lb. pot. Sufficient.—12 pints of strawberries will make 12 lb. pots of jam.

Pick the stalks from the strawberries, drop them into the bottles, sprinkling amongst them pounded sugar in the above proportion, and when the fruit reaches to the neck of the bottle, fill up with sherry or Madeira. Cork the bottles down with new corks, and dip them into melted resin. tSeasonahle.—Make this in June or July. TO PBESERVE STEAWBEHRIES WHOLE. 1596. Ingeedients.—To every lb. of fruit allow li lb. of good loaf sugar, 1 pint of red-currant juice. 3fode.—'Choose the strawberries not too ripe, of a fine large sort and of a good colour. Pick off the stalks, lay the strawberries in a dish, and sprinkle over them half the quantity of sugar, which must be finely pounded. Shake the dish gently, that the sugar may be equally distributed and touch the under-side of the fruit, and let it remain for 1 day. Then have ready the currant-juice, drawn as for red-currant jelly 'No. 1533 ; boil it with the remainder of the sugar until it forms a thin syrup, and in this simmer the strawberries and sugar, until the whole is sufficiently jellied. Great care must be taken not to stir the fruit roughly, as it should be preserved as whole as possible. Strawberries prepared in this manner are very good served in glasses and mixed with thin cream. Time.—j hour to 20 minutes to simmer the strawberries in the syrup. Seasoiiahle in June and July. TO MAKE EVERTON TOPPEE. 1597. Ingkedients.—1 lb. of powdered loaf sugar, 1 teacupfal of water, | lb. of butter, 6 drops of essence of lemon. Mode.—Vut the v/ater and sugar into a brass pan, and beat the butter to a cream. When the sugar is dissolved, add the butter, and keep stirring the mixture over the fire until it sets, when a little is poured on to a buttered dish ; and just before the toffee is done, add the essence of lemon. Butter a dish or tin, pour on it the mixture, and when cool, it will easily separate from the dish. Butter-Scotch, an excellent thing for coughs, is made with brown, instead of white sugar, omitting the water, and flavoured with | oz. of powdered ginger. It is made in the same manner as toffee. Time.—18 to 35 minutes. Average cost, 10c?. Sufficient to make a lb. of toftee. i801 PRESEIIVES, CONFECTIONARY, ETC, DESSEET DISHES. 1598. The tazza, or dish with stem, the same as that shown in our illustrations, is now the favourite shape for dessert-dishes. The fruit can be arranged and shown to better ad- vantage on these tall high dishes than on the short flat ones. All the dishes are now usually placed down the centre of the table, dried and fresh fruit alter- nately, the former being arranged on small round or oval glass plates, and the latter on the dishes with stems. The fruit should always be gathered on the same day that it is required for table, and should be taste- fully arranged on the dishes, with leaves between and round it. By pur- chasing fruits that ai'e in season^ a des- sert can be supplied at a very moderate cost. These, with a few fancy biscuits, crystallized fruit, bon-bons, &c., are sufficient for an ordinary dessert. AVhen fresh fruit DISH OF NrTS, BOX OS- fkei^ch: plums.

At fashionable ta- bles, forced fruit is served growing in pots, these pots being hidden in more ornamental ones, and arranged with the other dishes.—(See colour- ed plate W 1.) A few vases of fresh flowers, tastefully arranged, add very much to the appear- ance of the dessert; and, when these are not obtainable, a few paper ones, mixed with green leaves, answer very well as a substitute. In decorating a table, whether for luncheon, dessert, or supper, a vase or two of flowers should802 MODERN nOTTSEITOLD COOKERY. never be forgotten, as they add so mucb. to the elegance of tlie tout ensemUe. In summer and au- tumn, ladies resid- ing in the country can always manage to have a few fresh- ly-gathered flowers on their tables, and should never be without this inex- pensive luxury. On the continent, vases or epergnes filled with flowers are in- variablyplaced down the centre of the dinner-table at . re- gular distances. Ices for dessert are usu- ally moulded: when *this is not the case, they are handed round in glasses with wafers to ac- company them. Pre- served ginger is frequently handed round after ices, to prepare the palate for the delicious dessert wines. A basin or glass of finely-p ounded lump sugar must never be omitted at a des- sert, as also a glass jug of fresh cold wa- ter (iced, if possible), and two goblets by its side.

Zests are sometimes served at the close of the dessert; such as an- chovy toasts or bis- cuits. The French often serve plain or grated cheese with a dessert of fresh or dried fruite. At some tables, finger-glasses are placed at the right of each person, nearly half filled with cold spring water, and in winter with tepid water. These precede the dessert. At other tables, a glass or vase is simply handed round, filled with perfumed water, into which each guest dips the corner of his napkin, and, when needful, re- freshes his lips and the tips of his fingers. After the dishes are placed, and every one is provided with plates, glasses, spoons, &c., the wine should be put at each end of the table, cooled ot*803 PRESERVES, CONFECTIONARY, ETC. otherwise, according' to the season. If the party be small, the wine may be placed only at the top of the table, near the host. DISH OF NUTS. 1599. These are merely arranged piled high in the centre of the dish, as shown in the engraving", with or v/ithout leaves round the edge. Filberts should always be served with the outer skin or husk on them ; and walnuts should be w^ell wiped with a damp cloth, and then with a dry one, to remove the unpleasant sticky feeling the shells frequently have. Seasonahle.—Filberts from September to March, good ; may be had after that time, but are generally shrivelled and dry. Walnuts from September to January. Hazel Kut and Filbekt.—The common Ilazcl is the wild, and the Filbert the culti- vated state of the same tree. The hazel is tmmd wild, not only in forests and hedges, in dingles and rftviues, but occurs in extensive tracts in the more northern and mountainous parts of the country. It was formerly one of the most abundant of those trees which are indigenous in this island. It is seldom cultivated as a fruit-tree, though perhaps its nuts are suj)erior in flavour to the others. The Spanish nuts imported are a superior kind, but they are somewhat oily and rather indigestible. Filberts, both the re^ and the white, and the cob-nut, are supposed to be merely varieties of the common hazel, which have been produced, partly by the superiority of soil and climate, and partly by culture. They were originally brought out of Greece to Italy, whence they have found their way to Holland, and from that country to England. It is supposed that, within a few miles of Maidstone, in Kent, there are more filberts grown than in all England besides ; and it is from that place that the London market is supplied. The filbert is longer than the common nut, though of the same thickness, and has a larger kernel. The cob-nut is a still larger variety, and is roundish. Filberts are more esteemed at the dessert than common nuts, and are generally eaten with salt. They are very free from oil, and disagree with few persons. Walnuts.—The Walnut is a native of Persia, the Caucasxis, and China, but was introduced to this kingdom from France. The ripe kernel is brought to the dessert on account of its agreeable flavour ; and the fruit is also much used in the green state, before the stone hardens, as a pickle. In Spain, grated walnuts are employed in tarts and other dishes. The walnut abounds in oil, which is expressed, and which, being of a highly drying nature, and very limpid, is much employed for delicate painting. This, on the continent, is sometimes used as a substitute for olive-oil in cooking, but is very apt to turn rancid. It is also manufactiu'ed into a kind of soap. The marc, or refuse matter after the oil is extracted, proves very nutritious for poultry or other domestic animals, In Switzerland, this is eaten by poor people under the name of pain amer, BOX OF FKENCH PLUMS. 1600. If the box which contains them is exceedingly ornamental, it may be placed on the table; if small, on a glass dish ; if large, without one. French plums may also be arranged on a glass plate, and gar- nished with bright-coloured sweetmeats, which make a very good effect. All fancy boxes of preserved and crystallized fruit may be put on the table or not, at pleasure. These little matters of detail must, of course, be left to individual taste. Seasonahle,—May be purchased all the year; but are in greater perfection in the winter, and are more suitable for that season, as fresh fruit cannot be obtained. 3 F 2804 MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. DISH OF MIXED FBUIT. 1601. For a centre dish, a mixture of various fresh fruits has a remarkably good effect, particularly if a pine be added to the list. A high raised appearance should be given to the fruit, which is done in the following manner. Place a tumbler in the centre of the dish, and, in this tumbler, the pine, crown uppermost; round the tumbler put a thick layer of moss, and, over this, apples, pears, plums, peaches, and such fruit as is simultaneously in season. By putting a layer of moss underneath, so much fruit is not required, besides giving abetter shape to the dish. Grapes should be placed on the top of the fruit, a portion of some of the bunches hanging over the sides of the dish in a neglige kind of manner, which takes off the formal look of the dish. In arranging the plums, apples, &c., let the colours contrast well. Seasonable.—Suitable for a dessert in September or October. Gbapes.—France produces about a thousand Tarieties of the grape, which is cultivated more extensively in that country than in any other. Hygienists agree in pronouncing gi'apes as among the best of fruits. The grape possesses several rare quahties : it is nourishing and fattening, and its prolonged use has often overcome the most obstinate cases of constipation. The skins and pips of grapes should not be eaten. BOX OF CHOCOLATE. 1602. This is served in an ornamental box, placed on a glass plate or dish. Seasonable.—May be purchased at any time. DISH OF APPLES. 1603. The apples should be nicely wiped with a dry cloth, and arranged on a dish, piled high in the centre, with evergreen leaves between each layer. The inferior apples should form the bottom layer, with the bright-coloured large ones at the top. The leaves of the laurel, bay, holly, or any shrub green in winter, are suitable for garnishing dessert dishes. Oranges may be arranged in the same manner; they should also be wiped with a dry cloth before being sent to table. DISH OF MIXED SUMMER FRUIT. 1604. This dish consists of cherries, raspberries, currants, and straw- berries, piled in different layers, with plenty of leaves between each layer; so that each fruit is well separated. The fruit should be arranged with a due regard to colour, so that they contrast nicely one with the other. Our engraving shows a layer of white cherries at the bottom, then one of red raspberries; over that a layer of white currants, and at the top some fine scarlet strawberries. Seasonable in June, July, and August.805 PRESERVES, CONFECTIONARY, ETC. ALMONDS AND RAISHsTS. 1605. These are usually served on glass dishes, the fruit piled high in the centre, and the almonds blanched, and strewn over. To blanch the almonds, put them into a small mug or teacup, pour over them boiliDg water, let them remain for 2 or 3 minutes, and the skins may then bo easily removed. Figs, dates, French plums, &c., are all served on small glass plates or oval dishes, but without the almonds. Seasonable at any time, but more suitable in winter, when fresh fruit is not obtainable. Dates.—Dates are imported into Britain, in a dried state, from Barbary and Egypt, and, when in good condition, they are much esteemed. An inferior kind has lately become common, which are dried hard, and have little or no flavour. They should be chosen large, softish, not much wrinkled, of a reddish-yellow colour on the outside, with a whitish membrane between the fruit and the stone. DISH OF STEAWBEBBIES. 1606. Fine strawberries, arranged in the manner shown in the en- graving, look exceedingly well. The inferior ones should be placed at the bottom of the dish, and the others put in rows pyramidically, with the stalks downwards ; so that when the whole is completed, nothing but the red part of the fruit is visible. The fruit should be gathered with rather long stalks, as there is then something to support it, and it can be placed more upright in each layer. A few of the finest should be reserved to crown the top. TO HAVE WALNUTS PHESH THROUGHOUT THE SEASOIiT. 1607. Ingredients.—To every pint of water allow 1 teaspoonful of salt. 3£ode.—Place the walnuts in the salt and water for 24 hours at least; then take them out, and rub them dry. Old nuts may be freshened in this manner ; or walnuts, when first picked, may be put into an earthen pan with salt sprinkled amongst them, and with damped hay placed on the top of them, and then covered down with a lid. They must be well wiped before they are put on table. Seasonable.—-Should be stored away in September or October,CHAPTER XXXII. GENBRAI. OBSBRVATIOETS OIT MILK, BUTTER, CHEESIH, AI^D EGGS. MILK. 1608. Milk is obtained only from the class of animals called Mammalia, and is intended by Nature for the nourishment of their young. The milk of €ach animal is distinguished by some peculiarities ; but as that of the cow is by far the most useful to us in this part of the world, our observations will be confined to that variet3^ 1609. Milk, when drawn from the cow, is of a yellowish-white colour, and is the most yellow at the beginning of the period of lactation. Its taste is agree- able, and rather saccharine. The viscidity and specific gravity of milk are some- what greater than that of water ; but these properties vary somewhat in the milk procured from difi'erent individuals. On an average, the specific gravity of milk is 1.035, water being 1. The small cows of the Alderney breed afford the richest milk. 1610. Milk which is carried to a considerable distance, so as to be much agi- tated, and cooled before it is put into pans to settle for cream, never throws up so much, nor such rich cream, as if the same milk had been put into pans directly after it was milked. i6ri. Milk, considered as an aliment, is of such importance in domestic eco- nomy as to render all the improvements in its jjroduction extremelj' valuable. To enlarge upon the antiquity of its use is unnecessary ; it has always been a807 MILK, BUTTEE, CHEESE, A^•D EGGS. favourite food in Britain. Laete et carnc vivunt," says Caesar, in his Com- mentaries ; the English of which is, " the inhabitants subsist upon flesh and milk." The breed of the cow has received great improvement in modern times, as regards the quantity and quality of the milk which she affords ; the fonn of milch-cows, their mode of nourishment, and progress, are also manifest in the management of the dairy. 1612. Although milk in its natural state be a fluid, yet, considered as an ali- ment, it is both solid and fluid : for no sooner does it enter the stomach, than it is coagulated by the gastric juice, and separated into cm^d and whey, the first of these being extremely nutritive. 1613. Milk of the Incman siilject is much thinner than cow's m.ilk; Ass's milk comes the nearest to human milk of any other ; Goafs milk is something thicker and richer than cow's milk ; Eice's milk has the appearance of cow's milk, and affords a larger quantity of cream ; J/are'^ m?7/j contains more sugar than that of the ewe ; Camel's milk is used only in Africa; Buffalo's milk is employed in India. 1614. From no other substance, solid or fluid, can so great a number of distinct kinds of aliment be prepared as from milk ; some forming food, others drink ; some of them delicious, and deserving the name of luxm-ies ; all of them v/hole- some, and some medicinal : indeed, the variety of ahments that seems capable of being produced from milk, appears to be quite endless. In every age this must have been a subject for experiment, and every nation has added to the number by the invention of some peculiarity of its own. B U T T E K. 1615. Becoian, in his ^'History of Inventions," states that butter was not used either by the Greeks or Eomans in cooking, nor was it brought upon their tables at certain meals, as is the custom at present. In England it has been made from time immemorial, though the art of making cheese is said not to have been known to the ancient Britons, and to have been learned from their conquerors. 1616. The taste of butter is peculiar, and very unlike any other fatty sub- stance. It is extremely agreeable when of the best quality ; but its flavour depends much upon the food given to the cows : to be good, it should not adhere to the knife. 1617- Butter, with regard to its dietetic properties, maybe regarded nearly in the light of vegetable oils and animal fats ; but it becomes sooner rancid than most other fat oils. When fresh, it cannot but be considered as very whole-£08 MODEBN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. some ; but it should be quite free from rancidity. If slightly salted when it is fresh, its wholesomeness is probably not at all impaired ; but shguld it begin to turn rancid, salting will not correct its unwholesonieness. When salt butter is put into casks, the upper part next the air is very apt to become rancid, and this rancidity is also liable to affect the whole cask. 1618. Eppmg butter is the kind most esteemed in London. Fresh butter comes to London from Buckinghamshire, Suffolk, Oxfordshire, Yorkshire, Devonshire, &c. Cambridge butter is esteemed next to fresh ; DevoJisJiire butter is nearly similar in quality to the latter ; Irish butter sold in London is all salted, but is generally good. The number of firkins exported annually from Ireland amounts to 420,000, equal to a million of money. Butch butter is in good repute all over Europe, America, and even India ; and no country in the world is so successful in the manufacture of this article, Holland supplying more butter to the rest of the world than any country whatever. 1619. There are two methods pursued in the manufacture of butter. In one, the cream is separated from the milk, and in that state it is converted into but- ter by churning, as is the practice about Epping ; in the other, milk is subjected to the same process, which is the method usually followed in Cheshire. The first method is generally said to give the richest butter, and the latter the largest quantity, though some are of opinion that there is little difference either in quality or quantity. O !Ej S ]Ej • 1620. Cheese is the curd formed from milk by artificial coagulation, pressed and dried for use. Curd, called also casein and caseous matter, or the basis ot cheese, exists in the milk, and not in the cream, and requires only to be sepa- rated by coagulation. The coagulation, hov/ever, supposes some alteration of the curd. By means of the substance employed to coagulate it, it is rendered insoluble in water. When the curd is freed from the whey, kneaded and pressed to expel it entirely, it becomes cheese. This assumes a degree of transparency, and possesses many of the properties of coagulated albumen. If it be well dried, it does not change by exposure to the air; but if it contain moisture, it soon putrefies. It thereibre requires some salt to preserve it, and this acts likewise as a kind oi seasoning. All our cheese is coloured more or less, except that made from skim milk. The colouring substances employed are arnatto, turmeric, or marigold, all perfectly harmless unless they arc adulterated ; and it is said that arnatto sometimes contains red lead. 1621. Cheese varies in quality and richness according to the materials of which it is composed. It is made—1. Of entire milk, as in Cheshire ; 2. of milk and cream, as at Stilton ; 3. of new milk mixed with skimmed milk, as in Glou* cestershire; 4. of skimmed milk only, as in Suffolk, Holland, and Italy.MILK, BUTTER, CHEESE, AND EGGS. m 1622. The principal varieties of cheese used in England are the following : — Cheshire cheese, famed all over Europe for its rich quality and fine piquant flavour. It is made of entire new milk, the cream not being taken off. Gloucester cheese is much milder in its taste than the Cheshire. There are two kinds of Glou- cCvSter cheese,—single and double, Single Gloucester is made of skimmed milk, or of the milk deprived of half the cream ; Double Gloucester is a cheese that pleases almost every palate : it is made of the whole milk and cream. Stilton cheese is made by adding the cream of one day to the enth-e milk of the next: it was first made at Stilton, in Leicestershire. Sage cheese is so called from the practice of colouring some curd with bruised sage, marigold-leaves, and parsley, and mixing this with some uncoloured curd. With the Romans, and during the middle ages, this practice was extensively adopted. Cheddar cheese much resembles Parmesan. It has a very agreeable taste and flavour, and has a spongy appearance. BricJcbat cheese has nothing remarkable except its form. It is made by turning with rennet a mixture of cream and new milk. The curd is put into a wooden vessel the shape of a brick, and is then pressed and dried in the usual way. Dunlop cheese has a peculiarly mild and rich taste : the best is made entirely from new milk. Neio cheese (as it is called in London) is made chiefly in Lincolnshire, and is either made of all cream, or, like Stilton, by adding the cream of one day's milking to the milk that comes immediately from the cow : they are extremely thin, and are compressed gently two or three times, turned for a few days, and then eaten new with radishes, salad, &c. Skimmed Milk cheese is made for sea voyages principally. Parmesan cheese is made in Parma and Piacenza. It is the most celebrated of all cheese : it is made entirely of skimmed cow's milk. The high flavour which it has, is sup- posed to be owing to.the rich herbage of the meadows of the Po, where the eows are pastured. The best Parmesan is kept for three or four years, and none is carried to market till it is at least six months old. Butch cheese derives its peculiar pungent taste from the practice adopted in Holland of coagulating the milk with muriatic acid instead of rennet. Swiss cheeses in their several varieties are all remarkable for their fine flavour. That from Gruyere, a baili- wick in the canton of Fribourg, is best known in England. It is flavoured by the dried herb of Melilotos officinalis in powder. Cheese from milk and potatoes IS manufactured in Thuringia and Saxony. Cream cheese, although so callcrl, is not properly cheese, but is nothing more than cream dried sufficiently to ba ■cut with a knife. EGGS. 1623. There is only one opinion as to the nutritive properties of eggs, al- though the qualities of those belonging to diflferent birds vary somewhat. Those of the common hen are most esteemed as delicate food, particularly when *• new-laid." The quality of eggs depends much upon the food given to the hen. Eggs in general are considered most easily digestible when little subjected ta810 MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. the art of cookery. The lightest way of dressing them is by jioaching, which is effected by putting them for a minute or two into brisk boiUng water: this coagulates the external white, without doing the inner part too much. Eggs are much better when new-laid than a day or two afterwards. The usual time allotted for boiling eggs in the shell is 3 to 3| minutes : less time than that in boiling water will not be sufficient to solidify the white, and more will make the yolk hard and less digestible: it is very difficult to gues.s accurately as to the time. Great care should be employed in putting them into the water^ to prevent cracking the shell, which inevitably causes a portion of the white to exude, and lets water into the egg. Eggs are often beaten up ra\7 in nutritive beverages. 1624. Eggs are employed in a very great many articles of cookery, entries, and entremets, and they form an essential ingredient in pastry, creams, flip, &c. It is particularly necessary that they should be quite fresh, as nothing is Vv^orse than stale eggs. Cobbett justly says, stale, or even preserved eggs, are tilings to be run from, not after. 1625. The Metropolis is supplied with eggs from all parts of the kingdom, and they are likewise largely imported from various places on the continent; as France, Holland, Belgium, Guernsey, and Jersey. It appears from official statements mentioned in McCulloch's "Commercial Dictionary," that the number imported from France alone amounts to about 60,000,000 a year ; and supposing them on an average to cost fourpence a dozen, it follows that we pay our continental neighbours above £83,000 a year for eggs. 1626. The eggs of different birds vary much in size and colour. Those of the ostrich are the largest: one laid in the menagerie in Paris weighed 2 lbs. 14 oz., held a pint, and was six inches deep: this is about the usual size of those brought from Africa. Travellers describe ostrich eggs as of an agreeable taste: they keep longer than hen's eggs, Drinking-cups aro often made of the shell, which is very strong. The eggs of the turkey are almost as mild as those of the hen; the egg of the goose is large, but well-tasted. Duck's eggs have a rich flavour; the albumen is slightly transparent, or bluish, v/hen set or coagulated by boiling, which requires less time than hen's eggs. Guinea-fowl eggs are smaller and more delicate than those of the hen. Eggs of uildfowl are generally coloured, often spotted ; and the taste gene- rally partakes somewhat of the flavour of the bird they belong to. Those of land birds that are eaten, as the plover^ lapimig, ruffy kc, are in general much esteemed ; but those of sea-fowl have, more or less, a strong fishy tastet The eggs of the turtle are very num.erous : they consist of yolk only, without shell, and arc delicious.RE C I CHAPTER xxxiir. SSPAIIATIOW 03? MILK AND CRBALl.. 1627. If it be desired that the milk should be freed entirely from cream, it should be poured into a very shallow broad pan or dish, not more than li inch deep, as cream cannot rise through a great depth of milk. In cold and wet weather, milk is not so rich as it is in summer and warm weather, and the morning's milk is always richer than the evening's. The last-drawn milk of each milking, at all times and seasons, is richer than the lirst-drawa, and on that account should be set apart for cream. Milk should be shaken as little as possible when carried from the cow to the dairy, and should be poured into the pans very gently. Persons not keeping cows, may always have a little cream, provided the milk they purchase be pure and unadulterated. As soon as it comes in, it should be poured into very shallow open pie-dishes, and set by in a very cool place, and in 7 or 8 hours a nice cream should have risen to the surface. Milk is one of the most complete of all articles of food: that is to say, it contains a very large number of the elements which enter into the composition of the human body. It *' disagrees" with fat, heavy, languid people, of slow circulation; and, at first, with many people of sedentary habits, and stomachs weakened by stimulants of different kinds. But, if exercise can be taken and a little patience shown, while the system accommo- dates itself to a new regimen, this bland and soothing article of diet is excellent for the majority of thin, nervous people; especially for those who have suffered much from emo- tional disturbances, or have relaxed their stomachs by too much tea or coffee, taken too hot. Milk is, in fact, a nutrient and a sedative at once. Stomachs, however, have their idiosyncrasies, and it sometimes proves an unwelcome and ill-digested article of food. A3 milk, when good, contains a good deal of respiratory material (fat),—material which must either be burnt off, or derange the liver, and be rejected in other ways, it may disagree because the lungs are not sufficiently used in the open air. But it is very pro- bable that there are really " constitutions " which cannot take to it; and they should not be forced. TO KEEP MILK AND CUBAM IN HOT WEATHEB. 1628. When the weather is very warm, and it is very diiEcult to prevent milk from turning sour and spoiling the cream, it should be scalded, and it will then remain good for a few hours. It must on no account be allowed to boil, or there will be a skin instead of a cream upon the milk ; and the slower the process, the safer will it be. A Very good plan to seald milk, is to put the pan that contains it into a812 MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. saucepan or wide kettle of boiling water. When the surface looks thick, the milk is sufficiently scalded, and it should then be put away in a cool place in the same vessel that it was scalded in. Cream may be kept for 24 hours, if scalded without sugar; and by the addition of the latter ingredient, it will remain good double the time, if kept in a cool place. All pans, jugs, and vessels intended for milk, should be kept beautifully clean, and well scalded before the milk is put in, as uny negligence in this respect may cause large quantities of it to be spoiled ; and milk should never be kept in vessels of zinc or copper. Milk may be preserved good in hot weather, for a few hours, by placing the jug which contains it in ice, or very cold water; or a pinch of bicarbonate of soda may be introduced into the liquid. Milk, when of good quality, is of an opaqub white colour : the cream always comes to the top; the well-known milky odour is strong; it will boil without altering its appearance in these respects; the little bladders which arise on the surface will renew themselves if broken by the spoon. To boil milk is, in fact, the simplest way of testing its quality. The commonest adulterations of milk are not of a hurtful character. It is a good deal thinned with water, and sometimes thickened with a little starch, or coloured with yolk of egg, or even satFron; but these processes have nothing murderous in them, CUBDS AND WHEY. 1629. Ingredients.—A very small piece of rennet', i gallon of milk. ilfoe/^.—Procure from the butcher's a small piece of rennet, which is the stomach of the calf, taken as soon as it is killed, scoured, and well rubbed with salt, and stretched on sticks to dry. Pour some boil- ing water on the rennet, and let it remain for 6 hours ; then use the liquor to turn the milk. The milk should be warm and fresh from the cow : if allowed to cool, it must be heated till it is of a degree quite equal to new milk ; but do not let it be too hot. About a tablespoon- ful, or rather more, would be sufficient to turn the above proportion of milk into curds and whey; and whilst the milk is turning, let it be kept in rather a warm place. Time.—YTom 2 to 3 hours to turn the milk. Seasonable at any time. DEVOT^SHIRE CREAM. 1630. The milk should stand 24 hours in the winter, half that time when the weather is very warm. The milkpan is then set on a stove, and should there remain until the milk is quite hot; but it must not boil, or there will be a thick skin on the surface. When it is suffi- ciently done, the undulations on the surface look thick, and small rings appear. The time required for scalding cream depends on the size of the pan and the heat of the fire; but the slower it is done, th#813 MILK, BUTTER, CHEESE, AND EGGS. better. The pan should be placed in the dairy when the cream is sufficiently scalded, and skimmed the following: day. This cream is so much esteemed that it is sent to the London markets in small square tins, and is exceedingly delicious eaten with fresh fruit. In Devon- shire, butter is made from this cream, and is usually very firm. DEVONSHIRS JUNKET. 3631. Ingeedients.—To every pint of new milk allow 2 dessert- spoonfuls of brandy, 1 dessertspoonful of sugar, and 1^ dessertspoonful of prepared rennet; thick cream, pounded cinnamon, or grated nutmeg. Mode.—Make the milk blood-warm ; put it into a deep dish with the brandy, sugar, and rennet; stir it altogether, and cover it over until it is set. Then spread some thick or clotted cream over the top, grate some nutmeg, and strew some sugar over, and the dish will be ready to serve. Tmie.—About 2 hours to set the milk. Seasonable at any time. TO KEEP AND CHOOSE FBESH BUTTEB. 1633. Fresh butter should be kept in a dark, cool place, and in as large a mass as possible. Mould as much only as is required, as the more surface is exposed, the more liability there will be to spoil; and the outside very soon becomes rancid. Fresh butter should be kept covered with white paper. For small larders, butter-coolers of red brick are now very much used for keeping fresh butter in warm weather. These coolers are made with a large bell-shaped cover, into the top of which a little cold water should be poured, and in summer time very frequently changed ; and the butter must be kept covered. These coolers keep butter remarkably firm in hot weather, and ai'e extremely convenient for those whose larder accommodation is limited. In choosing fresh butter, remember it should smell deliciously, and be of an equal colour all through: if it smells sour, it has not been suffi- ciently washed from the buttermilk; and if veiny and open, it has pro- bably been worked with a staler or an inferior sort. btjttee-dish. TO PRESERVE AND TO CHOOSE SALT BUTTER. 1633. In large families, where salt butter is purchased a tub at a time, the first thing to be done is to turn the whole of the butter out.MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. and, witli a clean knife, to scrape the outside; the tub should then be wiped with a clean cloth, and sprinkled all round with salt, the butter replaced, and the lid kept on to exclude the air. It is necessary to take these precautions, as sometimes a want of proper cleanliness in the dairymaid causes the outside of the butter to become rancid, and if the scraping be neglected, the whole mass would soon become spoiled. To choose salt butter, plunge a knife into it, and if, when drawn out, the blade smells rancid or unpleasant, the butter is bad. The layers in tubs will vary greatly, the butter being made at different times ; so, to try if the whole tub be good, the cask should beunhooped, and the butter tried between the staves. It is not necessary to state that butter is extracted from cream, or from unskimmed milk, by the churn. Of course it partakes of the qualities of the milk, and winter butter is said not to be so good as spring butter. A word of caution is necessary about rancid butter. Nobody eats it on bread, but it is sometimes used in cooking, in forms in which the acidity can be more or less disguised. So much the worse ; it is almost pois^)nous, disguise it as you may. Never, under any exigency v/hatever, be tempted into allowing butter with even a soupgon of •'turning'* to enter into the composition of any dish that appears on your table. And, in general, the more you can do without the em- ployment of butter that has been subjected to the influence of heat, the better. The woman of modern times is not a *'leech;'* but she might often keep the "leech" from the door, if she would give herself the trouble to invent innocent sauces. BUTTEK-MOU3LDS, for Moulding Fresli Butter. 1634. Butter-moulds, or wooden stamps for moulding fresh butter, are much used, and are made in a variety of forms and shapes. In using them, let them be kept scrupu- lously clean, and before the butter is pressed in, the interior should be well wetted with cold water; the butter must sisH or EOLLED BUTiEB. ^^^^^ prcssed iu, the mould opened, and the perfect shape taken out. The butter may be then dished, and garnished with a wreath of parsley, if for a cheese course; if for breakfast, put it into an ornamental butter-dish, with a little water at the bottom, should the weather be very warm. CURIiED BUTTER. 1635. Tie a strong cloth by two of the corners to an iron hook in the wall; make a knot with the other two ends, so that a stick might pasaMILK, BUTTER, CHEESE, AND EGG3. 815 tlirougli. Put the butter into the cloth; twist it tig'htly over a dish, into which the butter will fall through the knot, so forming small and pretty little strings. The butter may then be garnished with parsley, if to serve with a cheese course; or it may be sent to table plain for breakfast, in an ornamental dish. Squirted butter for garnishing hams, salads, eggs, &c., is made by forming a piece of stiff paper in the shape of a cornet, and squeezing the butter in fine strings from the hole at the bottom. Scooped butter is made by dipping a teaspoon or seooper in warm water, and then scooping the butter quickly and thin. In warm weather, it would not be necessary to heat the spoon. Butter may be tept fresh for ten or twelve days by a very simple process. Knead it well in cold water till the buttermilk is exti-acted ; then put it in a glazed jar, which invert in auother, putting into the latter a suiiicient quantity of water to exclude the air. Renew the water every day. FAIRY BUTTER. 1636. IiTGEEDiENTS.—The yolks of 2 hard-boiled eggs, 1 table- spoonful of orange-fiower water, 2 tablespoonfuls of pounded sugar, i lb. of good fresh butter. Mode—Be^it the yolks of the eggs smoothly in a mortar, witli the orange-flower water and the sugar, until the whole is reduced to a fine paste; add the butter, and force all through an old but clean cloth by wringing the cloth and squeezing the butter very ha^d. The butter will then drop on the plate in large and small pieces, according to the holes in the cloth. Plain butter may be done in the same manner, and is very quickly prepared, besides having a very good efiect. Butter.—Yfhite-coloured butter is said not to be so good as the yellow; but the yellow colour is often artificially produced, by the introduction of colouring matter into the churn. ANCHOVT BUTTER. 1637. IxGEEDiENTS.—To cvcry lb. of butter allow 6 anchovies, 1 small bunch of parsley. Jibf^e.—Wash, bone, and pound the anchovies well in a mortar; scald the parsley, chop it, and rub through a sieve ; then pound all the ingredients together, mix well, and make the butter into pats immediately. This makes a pretty dish, if fancifully moulded, for breakfast or supper, and should be garnished with parsley. Average cost, Is. Sd. Sufficiejit to make 2 dishes, with 4 pats each. Seasonable at any time.MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. CHEESE. 1638. In families where much cheese is consumed, and it is bouglit in large quantities, a piece from the whole cheese should be cut, the larger quantity spread with a thickly-buttered sheet of white paper, and the outside occasionally wiped. To keep cheeses moist that are in daily use, when they come from table a damp cloth should be wrapped round them, and the cheese put into a pan with a cover to it, in a cool but not very dry place. To ripen cheeses, and bring them forward, put them into a damp cellar ; and, to check too large a production of mites, spirits may be poured into the parts affected. Pieces of cheese which are too near the rind, or too dry to put on table, may be made into Welsh rare-bits, or grated down and mixed with macaroni. Cheeses inay be preserved in a perfect state for years, by covering them with parchment, made pliable by soaking in water, or by rubbing them over with a coating of melted fat. The cheeses selected should be free from cracks or bruises of any kind. Cheese.—It is well known that some persons lilce cheese in a state of decay, and even " alive." There is no aceonnting for tastes, and it may be hard to show why mould, which is vegetation, should not be eaten as well as salad, or maggots as weU as eels. But, generally speaking, decomposing bodies are not wholesome eating, and the line must be drawn somewhere. STILTON CHEESE. 1639. Stilton cheese, or British Parmesan, as it is sometimes called, is generally preferred to all other cheeses by those whose authority few will dispute. Those made in May or June are usually served at Christmas; or, to be in prime order, should be kept from 10 to 12 months, or even longer. An arti- ficial ripeness in Stilton cheese is sometimes produced by inserting a small piece of de- cayed Cheshire into an aperture at the top. From 3 weeks to a month is sufficient time to ripen the cheese. An additional flavour may also be obtained by scooping out a piece from the top, and pouring therein port, sherry, Madeira, or old ale, and letting the cheese absorb these for 2 or 3 weeks. But that cheese is the finest which is ripened without any artificial aid, is the opinion of those who are judges in these matters. In serving a Stilton cheese, the top of it should be cut off to form a lid, and a napkin or flece of white paper, with a frill at the top, pinned round. When th 3 cheese goes from table, the lid should be replaced.MILK, BUTTER, CHEESE, AND EGGS. 817 MODE OF SERVING CHEESE. 1640. The usual mode of serving cheese at good tables is to cut a small quantity of it into neat square pieces, and to put them into a glass cheese-dish, this dish being handed round. Should the cheese crumble much, of course this method is rather wasteful, and it may then be put on the table in the piece, and the host may cut from it. When served thus, the cheese must always be carefully scraped, and laid on a white d'oyley or napkin, neatly folded. Cream cheese is often served in a cheese course, and, sometimes, grated Parmesan: the latter should be put into a covered glass dish. Eusks, cheese-biscuits, pats or slices of butter, and salad, cucumber, or water-cresses, should always form part of a cheese course. Smoking Cheeses.—The Eomans smoked their cheeses, to give them a sharp taste. They possessed public places expressly for this use, and subject to police regulations which no one could evade. A celebrated gourmand remarked that a dinner without cheese is like a woman with j one eye. CHEESE SANDWICHES. 1641. Ingkedients.—Slices of brown bread-and-butter, thin slices of cheese. 3Iode.—Cut from a nice fat Cheshire, or any good rich cheese, some slices about -2- inch thick, and place them between some slices of brown bread-and-butter, like sandwiches. Place them on a plate in the oven, and, when the bread is toasted, serve on a napkin very hot and very quickly. Tmie.—10 minutes in a brisk oven. Average cost, Hd. each sandwich. Sufficient—kMo\7 a sandwich for each person. Seasonable at any time. Cheese.—One of the most important products of coagulated milk is cheese. Unfer- mented, or cream-cheese, when quite fresh, is good for subjects with whom milk does not disagree; but cheese, in its commonest shape, is only lit for sedentaiy people, as an after-dinner stimulant, and in very small quantity. Bread and cheese, as a meal, is only fit for soldiers on march or labourers in the open air, who like it because it " holds the stomach a long time." CAYEHNE CHEESES. 164*2. Ingredients.—2- lb. of butter, i lb. of flour, I lb. of grated cheese, ^ teaspoonful of cayenne, J teaspoonful of salt; water. 3fode—Uuh the butter in the flour ; add the grated cheese, cayenne and salt; and mix these ingredients well together. Moisten with sufiicient water to make the whole into a paste; roll out, and cut into 3 G818 MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. fingers about 4 inches in length.

Ingeediei^ts.—4 eggs, the weight of 2 in Parmesan or good Cheshire cheese, the weight of 2 in butter; pepper and salt to taste. Mode,—Separate the yolks from the whites of the eggs ; beat the former in a basin, and grate the cheese, or cut it into very thin flakes. Parmesan or Cheshire cheese may be used, whichever is the most con- venient, although the former is considered more suitable for this dish; or an equal quantity of each may be used. Break the butter into small pieces, add it to the other ingredients, with sufficient pepper and salt to season nicely, and beat the mixture thoroughly. Well whisk the whites of the eggs, stir them lightly in, and either bake the fondue in a souffle-dish or small round cake-tin. Fill the dish only half full, as the fondue should rise very much. Pin a napkin round the tin or dish, and serve very hot and very quickly. If allowed to stand after it is withdrawn from the oven, the beauty and lightness of this preparation will be entirely spoiled. Time,—From 15 to 20 minutes. Average cost, 10c/. Sufficient for 4 or 5 persons. Seasonable at any time. BBILLAT SAVABIN'S FONDUE. {An excellent Mecipe.) 1644. Iiq-GEEDIENTS.—Eggs, chcese, butter, pepper and salt. Mode.—Take the same number of eggs as there are guests ; weigh 1 the eggs in the shell, allow a third of their weight in Cruyere cheese, and a piece of butter one-sixth of the weight of the cheese. Break the eggs into a basin, beat them well; add the cheese, which should be grated, and the butter, which should be broken into small pieces. Stir these ingredients together with a wooden spoon; put the mixture into a lined saucepan, place it over the Are, and stir until the sub- stance is thick and soft. Put in a little salt, according to the age of the cheese, and a good sprinkling of pepper, and serve the fondue on a very hot silver or metal plate. Do not allow the fondue to remain on the fire after the mixture is set, as, if it boils, it wiU be entirely spoiled. Brillat Savarin recommends that some choice Burgundy should be handed round with this dish. We have given this recipe exactly as he recommends it to be made; but we have tried it with good Cheshire cheese, and found it answer remarkably well.819 MILK, BUTTER, CHEESE, AND EGGS.

MACABOm, as usuaUy served with the CHEESE COUBSE. I. 1645. Ingkedients.—1 lb. of pipe macaroni, i lb. of butter, 6 oz. of Parmesan or Cheshire cheese, pepper and salt to taste, 1 pint of milk, 2 pints of water, bread crumbs. Ilode—Vvit the milk and water into a saucepan with sufficient salt to flavour it; place it on the fire, and, when it boils quickly, drop in the macaroni. Keep the water boiling until it is quite tender; drain the macaroni, and put it into a deep dish. Have ready the grated cheese, either Parmesan or Cheshire; sprinkle it amongst the macaroni and some of the butter cut into small pieces, reserving some of the cheese for the top layer. Season with a little pepper, and cover the top layer of cheese with some very fine bread crumbs. "Warm, without oiling, the remainder of the butter, and pour it gently over the bread crumbs. Place the dish before a bright fire to brown the crumbs; turn it once or twice, that it may be equally coloured, and serve very hot. The top of the macaroni may be browned with a salamander, which is even better than placing it before the fire, as the process is more expeditious ; but it should never be browned in the oven, as the butter would oil, and so impart a very disagreeable flavour to the dish. In boiling the macaroni, let it be perfectly ten- der but firm, no part beginning to melt, and the form entirely pre- served. It may be boiled in plain water, with a little salt instead of using milk, but should then have a small piece of butter mixed with it. Time.—lh to If hour to boil the macaroni, 5 minutes to brown it before the fire. Average cost, Is. 6d. Sufficient for 6 or 7 persons. Seasonable at any time. Note.—Kiband macaroni may be dressed in the same mamier, but does not require boiling so long a time. II. 1646.

Ilode.—Wash the macaroni, and boil it in salt and water until quite tender; drain it, and put it into rather a deep dish. Have ready a pint of good brown gravy, pour it hot over the macaroni, and send it to table with grated Parmesan served on a separate dish. When the flavour is liked, a little pounded mace may be added to the water in which the macaroni is boiled; but this must always be sparingly added, as it will imijart a very strong flavour. Time.—1^^ to 1| hour to boil the macaroni. Average cost, with the gravy and cheese, \s. 3d. Sufficient for 3 or 4 persons. Seasonable at smj time. POUNDED CHEESE. 1648. Ingeedients.—To every lb. of cheese allow 3 oz. of fresh butter. Mode.—To pound cheese is an economical way of usiog it, if it has become dry; it is exceedingly good spread on bread, and is the best way of eating it for those whose digestion is weak. Cut up the cheese into small pieces, and pound it smoothly in a mortar, adding butter in the above proportion. Press it down into a jar, cover with clarified butter, and it will keep for several days. The flavour may be very much increased by adding mixed mustard (about a teaspoonful to every lb.), or cayenne, or pounded mace. Curry-powder is also not unfrequently mixed with it. BAMAKINS, to serve with the CHEESE COUKSE. 1649. Ingredients.—J lb. of Cheshire cheese, \ lb. of Parmesan cheese, J lb. of fresh butter, 4 eggs, the crumb of a small roll; pepper, salt, and pounded mace to taste.821 Ilode.—Boil the crumb of the roll in milk for 5 minutes; strain, and put it into a mortar; add the cheese, which should be finely scraped, the butter, the yolks of the eggs, and seasoning, and pound these ingre- dients well together. "VYhisk the whites of the eggs, mix them with the paste, and put it into small pans or saucers, which should not be more than half filled. Bake them from 10 to 12 minutes, and serve them very hot and very quickly. This batter answers equally weU for macaroni after it is boiled tender. Time.—10 to 12 minutes. Average costy Is. 46?. Sufficient for 7 or 8 persons. Seasonable at any time. PASTKY RAMAKINS, to serve with the CHEESE COURSE. 1650. Ingkedients.—Any pieces of very good light puflf-paste Cheshire, Parmesan, or Stilton cheese. Mode.—The remains or odd pieces of paste left from large tarts, &c. answer for making these little dishes. Gather up the pieces of paste* roll it out evenly, and sprinkle it with grated cheese of a nice flavour. Fold the paste in three, roll it out again, and sprinkle more cheese over; fold the paste, roll it out, and with a paste-cutter shape it in any way that may be desired. Bake the ramakins in a brisk ovea from 10 to 15 minutes, dish them on a hot napkin, and serve quickly The appearance of this dish may be very much improved by brushing the ramakins over with yolk of egg before they are placed in the oven. Where expense is not objected to, Parmesan is the best kind of cheese to use for making this dish. Time.—10 to 15 minutes. Average cost, with \ lb. of paste, \0d. Sufficient for 6 or 7 persons. Seasonable at any time. TOASTED CHEESE, or SCOTCH BARE-BIT. 1651. Ingkedients.—A few slices of rich cheese, toast, mustard, and pepper. 3Iode.~Q\it some nice rich sound cheese into rather thin slices; melt it in a cheese-toaster on a hot plate, or over steam, and, when melted, add a small quantity of mixed mustard and a seasoning of pepper; stir the cheese until it is completely dissolved, then brown it before the fire, or with a salamander. Fill the bottom of the cheese-toaster with hot water, and serve with dry or buttered toasts, whichever may be pre- ferred. Our engraving illustrates a cheese-toaster with hot-water reservoir: the cheese is melted in the upper tin, which is placed in another vessel of boiling water, so keeping the preparation beautifullyS22 MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY, hot. A small quantity of porter, or port wine, is sometimes mixed ■with the cheese; and, if it be not very rich, a few pieces of butter may he mixed with it to great advantage. Sometimes the melted cheese is spread on the toasts, and then laid in the cheese-dish at the top of the hot water. Whichever way it is served, it is highly necessary that the mixture be very hot, and very quickly sent to table, or it will be worthless. Tiine.—About 5 minutes to melt the cheese. Average cost, lie?, per slice. Sufficient,—Allow a slice to each person. Seasonahle at any time. TOASTED CHESSS, or WELSH KABE-EIT. 1652. IjTGEEDiENTS.—Slices of bread, butter, Cheshire or Gloucester cheese, mustard, and pepper. IIode.—CvLt the bread into slices about iinch in thickness; pare off the crust, toast the bread slightly without hardening or burning it, and spread it with butter. Cut some slices, not quite so large as the bread, from a good rich fat cheese; lay them on the toasted bread in a cheese-toaster; be careful that the cheese does not burn, and let it be equally melted. Spread over the top a little made mustard and a seasoning of pepper, and serve very hot, with very hot plates. To facilitate the melting of the cheese, it may be cut into thin flakes or toasted on one side before it is laid on the bread. As it is so 'essential to send this dish hot to table, it is a good plan to melt the cheese in small round silver or metal pans, and to send these pans to table, allowing one for each guest. Slices of dry or buttered toast should always accompany them, with mustard, pepper, and salt. Ti7ne,—About 5 minutes to melt the cheese. Average cost, Hd each slice. Sufficient.—Allow a slice to each person. Seasonahle at any time. Note,—Should tlie cheese be dry, a little butter mixed with it will be an improvement. "Cow CsEESE."—It was onlyfift]r years after Aristotle—^the fourth century before Christ—that butter began to he noticed as an aliment. The Greeks, in imitation of the Parthians and Scythians, who used to send it to them, had it served upon their tables, and called it at first " oil of milk," and later, louturos, " cow cheese."

For the sauce,—i pint of cream, the yolks of 3 eggs, ^/ot/e.—Separate the yolks from the whites of the eggs ; beat the former, stir to them the cream, and bring the sauce to the boiling-82a HITLK, BUTTEB, CHEESE, AND EGGS. point, but do not allow it to boil, or it will curdle. Have ready some hot buttered toast, spread with anchovies pounded to a paste ; pour a little of the hot sauce on the top, and serve very hot and very quickly. Time.—5 minutes to make the sauce hot. Sufficient.—Allow i slice to each person. Seasonable at any time. TO CHOOSE EGGS. 1654. In choosing eggs,"apply the tongue to the large end of the egg, and, if it feels warm, it is new, and may be relied on as a fresh egg. Another mode of ascertaining their freshness is to hold them before a lighted candle, or to the light, and if the egg looks clear, it will be tolerably good; if thick, it is stale; and if there is a black spot attached to the shell, it is worthless. No egg should be used for culinary purposes with the slightest taint in it, as it will render perfectly useless those with which it has been mixed. Eggs that are purchased, and that cannot be relied on, should always be broken in a cup, and then put into a basin: by this means stale or bad eggs may be easily rejected, without wasting the others. Eggs contain, for their volume, a greater quantity of nutriment than any other article of food. But it does not follow that they are always good for weak stomachs; quite the contrary; for it is often a great object to give the stomach a large surface to work upon, a considerable volume of ingesta, over which the nutritive matter is diffused, and so exposed to the action of the gastric juice at many points. There are many persons who cannot digest eggs, however cooked. It is said, however, that their digestibility decreases ia proportion to the degree in which they are hardened by boiling. TO KEEP EGGS FBESH FOB SEVEBAL "WEEKS. 1655. Have ready a large saucepan, capable of holding 3 or 4 quarts, full of boiling water. Put the eggs into a cabbage-net, say 20 at a time, and hold them in the water (which must be kept boiling) for 20 seconds. Proceed in this manner till you have done as many eggs as you wish to preserve ; then pack them away in sawdust. "We have tried this method of preserving eggs, and can vouch for its excellence: they will be found, at the end of 2 or 3 months, quite good enough for culinary purposes ; and although the white may be a little tougher than that of a new-laid egg, the yolk will be nearly the same. Many persons keep eggs for a long time by smearing the shells with butter or sweet oil: they should then be packed in plenty of bran or sawdust, and the eggs not allowed to touch each other. Eggs for storing should be collected in fine weather, and should not be more than 24 hoiu'S old when they are packed away, or their flavour, when used, cannot be relied on. Another simple way of preserving eggs is to immerse them in lime-water soon after they have been laid, and then to put the vessel containing the lime-water in a cellar or cool outhouse.MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY, 824 Seasonable,—The best time for preserving eggs is from July to September. Eggs.—The quality oi eggs is said to be very much affected by the food of the fowls vrho lay them. Herbs and grain together make a better food than grain only. When the hens eat too many insects, the eggs have a disagreeable tiavour. TO BOIL EGGS FOK BHEAKFAST, SALADS, &c. 1656. Eggs for boiling cannot be too fresh, or boiled too soon after they are laid ; but rather a longer time should be allowed for boiling a new-laid egg than for one that is three or four days old. Have ready a saucepan of boiling water; put the eggs into it gently with a spoon, letting the spoon touch the bottom of the saucepan before it is withdrawn, that the egg may not fall, and consequently crack. For those who like eggs lightly boiled, 3 minutes will be found sufficient; 3| to 4 minutes will be ample time to set the white nicely; and, if liked hard, 6 to 7 minutes will not be found too long. Should the eggs be unusually large, as those of black Spanish fowls sometimes are, allow an EGG-STAND FOB THE EBAKFAST- gxtra ^ miuutc for thcm. Eggs for TABLE. , , salads should be boiled from 10 minutes to i hour, and should be placed in a basin of cold water for a few minutes ; they should then be rolled on the table with the hand, and the shell will peel off easily. Time.—To boil eggs lightly, for invalids or children, 3 minutes; to boil eggs to suit the generality of tastes, 3| to 4 minutes; to boil eggs hard, 6 to 7 minutes; for salads, 10 to 15 minutes. iVo^e.—Sih^er or plated egg-dishes, Hke that shown in our engraving, are now very much used. The price of the one illustrated is £2. 2s., and may be purchased of Messrs. K. & J. Slack, 33G, Strand. Eggs.—"When fresh eggs are dropped into a xesselfull of boiling water, they crack, because the eggs being well filled, the shells give way to the efforts of the interior fluids, dilated by heat. If the volume of hot water be small, the shells do not crack, because its temperature is reduced by the eggs before the interior dilation can take place. Stale eggs, again, do not crack, because the air inside is easily compressed. ji I BUTTEBED EGQS. ^ 1657. Ingredients.—4 new-laid eggs, 2 oz. of butter. M Mode,—Procure the eggs new-laid if possible ; break them into a basin, and beat them well; put the butter into another basin, which place in boiling water, and stir till the butter is melted. Pour that and the eggs into a lined saucepan; hold it over a gentle fire, and, asMILK, BUTTER, CHEESE, AND EGGS. 825 the mixture begins to warm, pour it two or three times into the basin, and back again, that the two ingredients may be well incorporated. Keep stirring the eggs and butter one way until they are hot, ivithout boiling, and serve on hot buttered toast. If the mixture is allowed to boil, it will curdle, and so be entirely spoiled. Time.—About 5 minutes to make the eggs hot. Average cost, 7d. Sufficient—AYLow a slice to each person. Seasonable at any time. DUCKS' EGGS. 1658. Ducks' eggs are usually so strongly flavoured that, plainly boiled, they are not good for eating; they answer, however, very well for various culinary preparations where eggs are required; such as custards, &c. &c. Being so large and highly-flavoured, 1 duck's egg will go as far as 2 small hen's eggs; besides making whatever they are mixed with exceedingly rich. They also are admirable when used in puddings. Primitive Method of Cooking Eggs.—The shepherds of Egypt had a singular manner of cooking eggs without the aid of fire. They placed them in a sling, which they turned so rapidly that the friction of the air heated them to the exact point required for use. FBIED EGGS. 1659. Ingeediei^ts.-—4 eggs, i lb. of lard, butter or clarified dripping. J/ot?e.—Place a delicately-clean frying-pan over a gentle fire ; put in the fat, and allow it to come to the boiling-point.

Veneration for Eggs.—Many of the most learned philosophers held eggs in a kind of respect, approaching to veneration, because they caw in them the emblem ot the world and the four elements. The sheU, they said, represented the earth ; the white, water j the yolk, fire j and air was found under the sheU at one end of the egg. EGGS A LA MAITRE D'HOTEL. 1660.

Mode.—Put the flour and half the butter into a stewpan; stir them over the fire until the mixture thickens; pour in the milk, which should be boiling; add a seasoning: of pepper and salt, and simmer the whole for 5 minutes. Put the remainder of the butter into the sauce, and add the minced parsley; then boil the eggs hard, strip off the shells, cut the eggs into quarters, and put them on a dish.

Mode.—Butter a dish rather thickly with good fresh butter ; melt it, break the eggs into it the same as for poaching, sprinkle them with white pepper and fine salt, and put the remainder of the butter, cut into very small pieces, on the top of them. Put the dish on a hot plate, or in the oven, or before the fire, and let it remain until the whites become set, but not hard, when serve immediately, placing the dish they were cooked in on another. To hasten the cooking of the eggs, a salamander may be held over them for a minute ; but great care must be taken that they are not too much done. This is an exceedingly nice dish, and one very easily prepared for breakfast. jTme.—S minutes. Average cost, 5d. Sufficient for 2 persons. Seasonable at any time. PliOVSES' EGGS. 1662. Plovers' eggs are usually served boiled hard, and sent to table in a napkin, either hot or cold. They may also be shelled, and served the same as eggs a la Tripe, with a good Bechamel sauce, or brown gravy, poured over them. They are also used for decorating salads, the beautiful colour of the white being generally so much admired. POACHED EGGS. 1663. Ingkedients.—Eggs, water.

Strain some boiling water into a deep clean frying-pan; break the egg into a cup without damaging the yolk, and, when the water boils, remove the pan to the side of the fire, and gently slip the egg into it. Place the pan over a gentle fire, and keep the water simmering until the white looks nicely set, when the egg is ready. Take it up gently with a slice, cut away the ragged edges of the white, and serve either on toasted bread or on slices of ham or bacon, or on spinach, &c. A poached egg should not be overdone, as its appearance and taste will be quite spoiled if the yolk be allowed to harden. Y/hen the egg is slipped into the water, the , white should be gathered together, to keep it a little in form, or the cup should be turned over it for i minute. To poach an egg to perfection is rather a difficult operation; so, for inexpe- rienced cooks, a tin egg-poacher may be purchased, which greatly facilitates this manner of dressing eggs. Our illustration clearly shows what it is; it consists of a tin plate with a handle, with a space for three perforated cups. An egg should be broken into each cup, and the machine then placed in a stev/pan of boiling water, which has been previously strained. When the whites of the eggs appear set, they are done, and should then be carefully slipped on to the toast or spinach, or with whatever they are served. In poaching eggs in a frying-pan, never do more than four at a time ; and, when a little vinegar is liked mixed with the water in which the eggs are done, use the above proportion. Time.—2-h to H minutes, according to the size of the egg. Sufficient.—Allow 2 eggs to each person. Seasonable at any time, but less plentiful in winter. POACHED EGGS, WITH CKEAM. 1664.

Mode.—Vvit the water, vinegar, and salt into a frying-pan, and break each egg into a separate cup ; bring the waiter, &o. to boil, and slip the eggs gently into it without breaking the yolks. Simmer them from 3 to 4 minutes, but not longer, and, with a slice, lift them out onMODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. 828 to a hot dish, and trim the edges. Empty the pan of its contents, put in the cream, add a seasoning to taste of pepper, salt, and pounded sugar; bring the whole to the boiling-point; then add the butter, broken into small pieces ; toss the pan round and round till the butter is melted; pour it over the eggs, and serve. To insure the eggs not being spoiled whilst the cream, &c., is preparing, it is a good plan to warm the cream with the butter, &c., before the eggs are poached, so^ that it may be poured over them immediately after they are dished. Time~Z to 4 minutes to poach the eggs, 5 minutes to warm the cream. Average cost for the above quantity, 9c7. Sufficient for 2 persons. Seasonable at any time. 1665. COMPABATIVE SIZES OF EGGS.

Among the numerous vegetable products yielding articles of food for man, the Cereals hold the first place. By means of skilful cultivation, mankind have transformed the original forms of these growths, poor and ill-flavoured as they perhaps were, into various fruitful and agreeable species, which yield an abundant and pleasant supply. Classified according to their respective richness in alimentary elements, the Cereals stand thus :—Wheat, and its varieties. Rye, Barley, Oats, Rice, Indian Corn. Everybody knows it is wheat flour which yields the best bread. Rye-bread is viscous, hard, less easily soluble by the gastric juice, and not so rich in nutritive power. Flour produced from barley, Indian corn, or rice, is not so readily made into bread ; and the article, when made, is heavy and indigestible. 1669. On examining a grain oi corn from any of the numerous cereals* used in the preparation of flour, such as wheat, maize, rye, barley, &c., it will be found to consist of two parts,—the husk, or exterior covering, which is gene- rally of a dark colour, and the inner, or albuminous part, which is more or less * Cereal, a corn-producing plant; from Ceres, the goddess of agriculture.831 BREAD, BISCUITS, AND CAKES. white. In grinding, these two portions are separated, and the husk being blown away in the process of winnowing, the flour remains in the form of a light brown powder, consisting principally of starch and gluten. In order to render it white, it undergoes a process called bolting." It is passed through a series of fine sieves, which separate the coarser parts, leaving behind fine white flour,—the "fine firsts " of the corn-dealer. The process of bolting, as just described, tends to deprive flour of its gluten, the coarser and darker portion containing much of that substance; while the lighter part is peculiarly rich in starch. Bran contains a large proportion of gluten ; hence it will be seen why brown bread is so much more nutritious than white ; in fact, wo may lay it down as a general rule, that the whiter the bread the less nourish- ment it contains. Majendie proved this by feeding a dog for forty days with white wheaten bread, at the end of which time he died ; while another dog, fed. on brown bread made with flour mixed with bran, Uved without any diS" turbance of his health. The "bolting" process, then, is rather injurious than beneficial in its result; and is one of the numerous instances where fashion has chosen a wrong standard to go by. In ancient times, down to tha Emperors, no bolted flour was known. In many parts of Germany the entire meal is used ; and in no part of the world are the digestive organs of the people in a better condition. In years of famine, when corn is scarce, the use of bolted flour is most culpable, for from 18 to 20 per cent, is lost in bran. Brown bread has, of late years, become very popular ; and many physicians have recommended it to invalids with weak digestions with great success. This rage for white bread has introduced adulterations of a very serious character, affecting the health of the whole community. Potatoes are added for this purpose; but this is a comparatively harmless cheat, only reducing the nutritive property of the bread ; but bone-dust and alum are also put in, which are far from harmless. 1670. Bread-making is a very ancient art indeed. The Assyrians, Egyptians, and Greeks, used to make bread, in which oil, with aniseed and other spices, was an element; but this was unleavened. Every family used to prepare the bread for its own consumption, the trade of baking not having yet taken shape. It is said, that somewhere about the beginning of the thirtieth Olympiad, the slave of an archon, at Athens, made leavened bread by accident. He had left some wheaten dough in an earthen pan, and forgotten it; some days after- wards, he lighted upon it again, and found it turning sour. His first thought was to throw it away; but, his master coming up, he mixed this now acescent dough with some fresh dough, which he was working at. The bread thus produced, by the introduction of dough in which alcoholic fermentation had begun, was found delicious by the archon and his friends ; and the slave, being summoned and catechised, told the secret. It spread all over Athens ; and everybody wanting leavened bread at once, certain persons set up as bread- makers, or bakers. In a short time bread-baking became quite an art, and ''Athenian bread" was quoted all over Greece as the best bread, just as the honey of Hymettus was celebrated as the best honey.832 lIOLEr.N HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. 1671. In our own times, and among civilized peoples, bread has become an article of food of the first necessity; and properly so, for it constitutes of itself a complete life-sustainer, the gluten, starch, and sugar, which it con- tains, representing azotized and hydro-carbonated nutrients, and combining the sustaining powers of the animal and vegetable kingdoms in one product. T672. Wheaten Bread.—The finest, wholesomest, and most savoury bread is made from wheaten flour. There are, of wheat, three leading qualities,— the soft, the medium, and the hard wheat; the last of which yields a kind of bread that is not so white as that made from soft wheat, but is richer in gluten, and, consequently, more nutritive. 1673. Rye Bread.—This comes next to wheaten bread : it is not so rich in gluten, but is said to keep fresh longer, and to have some laxative qualities. 1674. Barley Bread, Indian-Corn Bread, &c.—Bread made from barley, maize^ oats, rice, potatoes, &c. "rises" badly, because the grains in question contain but little gluten, which makes the bread heavy, close in texture, and difficult of digestion ; in fact, corn-flour has to be added before panification can take place. In countries where wheat is scarce and maize abundant, the people make the latter a chief article of sustenance, when prepared in different forms. BKBAD-MAKING. 1675. Panification, or bread-making, consists of the following processes, in the case of Wheaten Flour. Fifty or sixty per cent, of water is added to the flour, with the addition of some leavening matter, and, preferably, of yeast from malt and hops. All kinds of leavening matter have, however, been, and are still used in different parts of the world : in the East Indies, toddy," which is a liquor that flows from the wounded cocoa-nut tree ; and, in the West Indies, "dunder," or the refuse of the distillation of rum. The dough then undergoes the well-known process called hieacUng. The yeast produces fermentation, a process which may be thus described :—The dough reacting upon the leavening matter introduced, the starch of the flour is transformed into saccharine matter, the saccharine matter being afterwards changed into alcohol and carbonic acid. The dough must be well " bound," and yet allow the escape of the little bubbles of carbonic acid which accompany the fermen- tation, and which, in their passage, cause the numerous little holes which are seen in light bread. 1676. The yeast must be good and fresh, if the bread is to be digestible and nice. Stale yeast produces, instead of vinous fermentation, an acetous fer- mentation, which flavours the bread and makes it disagreeable. A poor thin833 BREAD, BISCUITS, AND CAKES. yeast produces an imperfect fermentation, the result being a heavy unwhole- some loaf. 1677. When the dough is well kneaded, it is left to stand for some time, and then, as soon as it begins to swell, it is divided into loaves ; after which it is again left to stand, when it once more swells up, and manifests, for the last time, the symptoms of fermentation. It is then put into the oven, where the water contained in the dough is partly evaporated, and the loaves swell up again, while a yellow crust begins to form upon the surface. When the bread is sufficiently baked, the bottom crust is hard and resonant if struck with the finger, while the crumb is elastic, and rises again after being pressed down with the finger. The bread is, in all probability, baked sufficiently if, on opening the door of the oven, you are met by a cloud of steam which quickly passes away. 167S. One word as to the unwholesomeness of now bread and hot rolls. When bread is taken out of the oven, it is full of moisture ; the starch is held together in masses, and the bread, instead of being crusted so as to expose each grain of starch to the saliva, actually prevents their digestion by being formed by the teeth into leathery poreless masses, which lie on the stomach like so many bullets. Bread should always be at least a day old before it is eaten ; and, if properly made, and kept in a cool dry place, ought to be per- fectly soft and palatable at the end of three or four days. Hot rolls, swim- ming in melted butter, and new bread, ought to be carefully shunned by everybody who has the slightest respect for that much-injured individual— the Stomach. 1679. Aerated Bread.—It is not unknown to some of our readers that Dr. Dauglish, of Malvern, has recently patented a process for making bread ''light" without the use of leaven. The ordinary process of bread-making by fer- mentation is tedious, and much labour of human hands is requisite in the kneading, in order that the dough may be thoroughly interpenetrated with the leaven. The new process impregnates the bread, by the application of machinery, with carbonic acid gas, or fixed air. Different opinions are expressed about the bread ; but it is curious to note, that, as corn is now reajDcd by machiner}'', and dough is baked by machinery, the whole process of bread-making is probably in coui^se of undergoing changes which will eman- cipate both the housewife and the professional baker from a large amount of labour. 1680. In the production of Aerated Bread, wheaten flour, water, salt, and carbonic acid gas (generated by proper machinery), are the only materials employed. We need not inform our readers that carbonic acid gas is the source of the effervescence, whether in common water coming from a depth, or in lemonade, or any aerated drink. Its-actioU; in the new bread, takes the place of fermentation in the old. 3 HMODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERr. 834 1681. In the patent process, the dough is mixed in a great iron ball, inside which is a system of paddles, perpetually turning, and doing the kneading part of the business. Into this globe the flour is dropped till it is full, and then the common atmospheric air is pumped out, and the pure gas turned on. The gas is followed by the water, which has been aerated for the pur- pose, and then begins the churning or kneading part of the business. 1682. Of course, it is not long before we have the dough, and very " light '* and nice it looks. This is caught in tins, and passed on to the floor of the oven, which is an endless floor, moving slovfly through the fire. Done to a turn, the loaves emerge at the other end of the apartment,—and the Aerated Bread is made. 1683. It may be added, that it-is a good plan to change one's baker from time to time, and so secure a change in the quality of the bread that is eaten. 1684. Mixed Breads.—Eye bread is hard of digestion, and requires longer and slower baking than wheaten bread. It is better when made with leaven of wheaten flour rather than yeast, and turns out lighter. It should not be eaten till two days old. It will keep a long time. 1685. A good bread may be made by mixing rye-flour, wheat-flour, and rice-paste in equal proportions ; also by mixing rye, wheat, and barley. lu Norwaj'-, it is said that they only bake their barley bread once a year, such is its keeping" quality. 1686. Indian-corn flour mixed with wheat-flour (half with half) makes a nice bread ; but it is not considered very digestible, though it keeps well. 1687. Rice cannot be made into bread, nor can potatoes; but one-third potato-flour to three-fourths wheaten flour makes a tolerably good loaf. 16S8. A very good bread, better than the ordinary sort, and of a delicious flavour, is said to be produced by adopting the following recipe :—Take ten parts of wheat-flour, five parts of potato-flour, one part of rice-]3aste ; knead together, add the yeast, and bake as usual. This is, of course, cheaper than wheaten bread. 1689. Flour, when freshly ground, is too glutinous to make good bread, and should therefore not be used immediately, but should be kept dry for a few weeks, and stirred occasionally, until it becomes dry, and crumbles easily between the fingers. 1690. Flour should be perfectly dry before being used for bread or cakes ; if at all damp, the preparation is sure to be heavy. Before mixing it with the other ingredients, it is a good plan to place it for an hour or two before the fire, until it feels warm and dry.BREAD, BISCUITS, AND CAKES. 835 1691. Yeast from home-brewed beer is generally i)referrecl to any other: it is very bitter, and, on that account, should be well washed, and put away until the thick mass settles. If it still continues bitter, the process should be repeated ; and, before being* used, all the water floating at the top must be poured off. German yeast is now very much used, and should be moistened, and thoroughly mixed with the mUk or water with which the bread is to be made. 1692. The following observations are extracted from a valuable work oa Bread-making,* and will be found very useful to our readers :— l693« The first thing required for making wholesome bread is the utmost cleanliness; the next is the soundness and sweetness of all the ingredients used for it; and, in addition to these, there must be attention and care through the whole process. 1694. An almost certain v/ay of spoiling dough is to leave it half-made, and to allow it to become cold before it is finished. The other most common causes of failure are using yeast which is no longer svv-eet, or which has beea frozen, or has had hot liquid poured over it. 1695. Too small a proportion of yeast, or insufficient time allowed for the dough to rise, will cause the bread to be heavy. 1696. Heavy bread will also most likely be the result of making the dough very hr^rd, and letting it become quite cold, particularly in winter. 1697. If either the sponge or the dough be permitted to overwork itself, that is to say, if the mixing and kneading be neglected when it has reached the proper point for either, sour bread will jprobably be the consequence in wai-m weather, and bad bread in any. The goodness will also be endangered by placing it so near a fire as to make any part of it hot, instead of main- taining the gentle and equal degree of heat required for its due fermentation, 1698. Milk or Butter.—Milk which is not perfectly sweet will not only injure the flavour of the bread, but, in sultry weather, will often cause it to be 'quite uneatable; yet either of them, if fresh and good, will materially improve its quality. 1699. To keep bread sweet and fresh, as soon as it is cold it should be put into a clean earthen pan, with a cover to it: this pan should be placed at a little distance from the ground, to allow a current of air to pass underneath. Some persons prefer keeping bread on clean wooden shelves, without being covered, that the crust may not soften. Stale bread may be fi'eshened by v/arming it through in a gentle oven. Stale pastry, cakes, &c., may also be improved by this method. * " The English Bread-Book." By Eliza Acton. Loudon: Longmau, 3 H 283a MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. 1700. The utensils required for making bread, on a moderate scale, are a kneading-trough or pan, sufficiently large that the dough may be kneaded freely without throwing the flour over the edges, and also to allow for its rising ; a hair sieve for straining yeast, and one or two strong spoons. 1701. Yeast must always be good of its kind, and in a fitting state to pro- duce ready and proper fermentation. Yeast of strong beer or ale produces more effect than that of milder kinds; and the fresher the yeast, the smaller the quantity will be required to raise the dough. 1702. As a general rule, the oven for baking bread should be rather quick, and the heat so regulated as to penetrate the dough without hardening the outside. The oven door should not be opened after the bread is put in until the dough is set, or has become firm, as the cool air admitted will have an unfavourable effect on it. 1703. Brick ovens are generally considered the best adapted for baking bread: these should be heated with wood faggots, and then swept and mopjoed out, to cleanse them for the reception of the bread. Iron ovens are more diffi- cult to manage, being apt to burn the surface of the bread before the middle is baked. To remedy this, a few clean bricks should be set at the bottom of the oven, close together, to receive the tins of bread. In many modern stoves the ovens are so much improved that they bake admirably; and they can always be brought to the required temperature, when it is higher than is needed, by leaving the door open for a time. A FEW HINTS respecting the Making and Baking of CAKES. 1704. Eggs should always be broken into a cup, the whites and yolks sepa- rated, and they should always be strained. Breaking the eggs thus, the bad ones may be easily rejected without spoiling the others, and so cause no waste. As eggs are used instead of j^east, they should be very thoroughly whisked; they are generally sufficiently beaten when thick enough to carry the drop that falls from the whisk. 1705. Loof Sugar should be well pounded, and then sifted through a fine sieve. 1706. Currants should be nicely washed, picked, dried in a cloth, and then ■carefully examined, that no pieces of grit or stone may be left amongst them. They should then be laid on a dish before the fire, to become thoroughly dry; as, if added damp to the other ingredients, cakes will be liable to be heavy. 1707. Good Butter should alwaj^s be used in the manufacture of cakes ; and if beaten to a cream, it saves much time and labour to warm, but not melt, it before beating.BREAD, BISCUITS, AKD CAKES. 837 1708. Less butter and eggs are required for cakes when yeast is mixed with, the other ingredients. 1709. The heat of the oven is of gi-eat importance, especially for largo cakes. If the heat be not tolerably fierce, the batter will not rise. If the oven is too quick, and there is any danger of the cake burning or catching, put a sheet of clean paper over the top. Newspaper, or paper that has been printed on, should never be used for this purpose. 1710. To know when a cake is sufficiently baked, plunge a clean knife into the middle of it; draw it quickly out, and if it looks in the least sticky, put the cake back, and close the oven door until the cake is done. 1711. Cakes should be kept in closed tin canisters or jars, and in a dry place. Those made with yeast do not keep so long as those made without it. BISCUITS. 1712. Since the establishment of the large modern biscuit manufactories, biscuits have been j)roduced both cheap and wholesome, in, comparatively speaking, endless variety. Their actual component parts are, perhaps, known only to the various makers; but there are several kinds of biscuits which have long been in use, that may here be advantageously described. 1713. Biscuits belong tD the class of unfermented bread, and are, perhaps, the most wholesome of that class. In cases where fermented bread does not agree with the human stomach, they may be recommended: in many instances they are considered lighter, and less liable to create acidity and flatulence. The name is derived from the French his cuit, ^' twice-baked," because, originally, that was the mode of entirely depriving them of all moisture, to insure their lieeping; but, although that process is no longer employed, the name is ret ained. The use of this kind of bread on land is pretty general, and some varieties are luxuries ; but, at sea, biscuits are articles of the first necessity. 1714. Sea, or Ship Biscuits, are made of wheat-flour from which only tho coarsest bran has been sei)arated. The dough is made up as stiff as it can be worked, and is then formed into shapes, and baked in an oven ; after which, the biscuits are exposed in lofts over the oven until perfectly dry, to prevent them from becoming mouldy when stored. 1715. Captains' Biscuits are made in a similar manner, only of fino flour.RECIPES. CHAPTER XXXV. TO MAKE YEAST FOB EBBAD. 1716. IiTGEEDiENTS.— if oz. of liops, 3 quarts of water, 1 lb. of bruised malt, i pint of yeast. Ilode.—Boil the hops in the water for 20 minutes ; let it stand for about 5 minutes, then add it to 1 lb. of bruised malt prepared as for brewing. Let the mixture stand covered till about lukewarm ; then put in not quite 4 pint of yeast; keep it warm, and let it work 3 or 4 hours; then put it into small i-pint bottles (ginger-beer bottles are the best for the purpose), cork them well, and tie them down. The yeast is now ready for use ; it will keep good for a few weeks, and 1 bottle will be found sufficient for 18 lbs. of flour. When required for use, boil 3 lbs. of potatoes without salt, mash them in the same water in which they were boiled, and rub them through a colander. Stir in about | lb. of flour; then put in the yeast, pour it in the middle of the flour, and let it stand warm on the hearth all night, and in the morning let it be quite warm when it is kneaded. The bottles of yeast require very careful opening, as it is generally ex- ceedingly ripe. Time.—20 minutes to boil the hops and water, the yeast to work 3 or 4 hours. Sufficient,—^ pint sufficient for 18 lbs. of flour. . KIBKIiBATHAM YEAST. 1717. Ii^GEEDiENTS.—2 OZ. of hops, 4 quarts of water, i lb. of flour, I pint of yeast.

When wanted for use, boil potatoes \ according to the quantity of bread to be made (about 3 lbs. are suffi- cient for about a peck of flour); mash them, add to them 4 lb, of flour,BREAD, BISCUITS, AND CAKES. 839 and mix about i pint of the yeast with them ; let this mixture stand all day, and lay the bread to rise the night before it is wanted. Time.—20 minutes to boil the hops and water. Siffficient.—i pint of this yeast sufficient for a peck of flour, or rather more. 1718. Inghedients.—1 quartern of flour, 1 large taolespoonful of solid brewer's yeast, or nearly 1 oz. of fresh German yeast, 1^ to li pint of warm milk-and-water. Idode.—-'But the flour into a large earthenware bowl or deep pan; then, with a strong metal or wooden spoon, hollow out the middle; but do not clear it entirely away from the bottom of the pan, as, in that case, the sponge (or leaven, as it was formerly termed) would stick to it, which it ought not to do. Next take either a large table- spoonful of brewer's yeast which has been rendered solid by mixing it with plenty of cold water, and letting it afterwards stand to settle for a day and night; or nearly an ounce of German yeast; put it into a large basin, and proceed to mix it, so that it shall be as smooth as cream, with | pint of warm milk-and-water, or with water only; though even a very little milk will much improve the bread. Pour the yeast into the hole made in the fiour, and stir into it as much of that which lies round it as will make a thick batter, in which there must be no lumps. Strew plenty of flour on the top ; throw a thick clean cloth over, and set it where the air is warm ; but do not place it upon the kitchen fender, for it will become too much heated there. Look at it from time to time : when it has been laid for nearly an hour, and when the yeast has risen and broken through the flour, so that bubbles appear in it, you will know that it is ready to be made up into dough. Then place the pan on a strong chair, or dresser, or table, of convenient height; pour into the sponge the remainder of the warm milk-and-water; stir into it as much of the flour as you can with the spoon; then wipe it out clean with your fingers, and lay it aside. Next take plenty of the remaining flour, throw it on the TO MAKE GOOD HOME-MADE EBEAD. (Miss Acton's Reci2^e.) COTTAGE LOAF, TIN- BEEAD.MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY, 8i0 top of the leaven, and begin, with the knuckles of both hands, to knead it well. When the flour is nearly all kneaded in, begin to draw the edges of the dough towards the middle, in order to mix the whole thoroughly; and when it is free from flour and lumps and crumbs, and does not stick to the hands when touched, it will be done, and may again be covered with the cloth, and left to rise a second time. In f hour look at it, and should it have swollen very much, and begin to crack, it will be light enough to bake. Turn it then on to a paste-board or very clean dresser, and with a large sharp knife ■ divide it in tv/o; make it up quickly into loaves, and dispatch it to the oven: make one or two incisions across the tops of the loaves, as they will rise more easily if this be done. If baked in tins or pans, rub them with a tiny piece of butter laid on a piece of clean paper, to prevent the dough from sticking to them. All bread should be turned upside down, or on its side, as soon as it is drawn from the oven: if this be neglected, the under part of the loaves will become wet and blistered from the steam, which cannot then escape from them. To mahe the dough without setting a sponge^ merely mix the yeast with the greater part of the warm milk-and-water, and wet up the whole of the flour at once after a little salt has been stirred in, proceeding exactly, in every other respect, as in the direc- tions just given. As the dough will soften in the rising, it should be made quite firm at first, or it will be too lithe by the time it is ready for the oven. Time.—To be left to rise an hour the first time, | hour the second time ; to be baked from 1 to l\ hour, or baked i in one loaf from l a- to 2 hours. Italian Millet, or Great Indian Millet, is cultivated in Egypt and . Nubia, where it is called dhourra, and is used as human food, as -vvell as i for the fermentation of beer. It will grow on poor soils, and is extremely < productive. It has been introduced into Italy, where they make a coai^se bread from it; and it is also employed in pastry and puddings: they also use it for feeding horses and domestic fowls. It is the largest variety, growing to the height of six feet; but it requires a warm climate, and will not ripen in this country. A yellow variety, called Golden Millet, is ITALIAIT sold in the grocers' shops, for maldng puddings, and is very delicate and MiLLEi, wholesome. TO MAKE A PECK OF GOOD BKEAD. ! 1719.

Ingeedients.—To every lb. of rice allow 4 lbs. of wheat flour, nearly 3 tablespoonfuls of yeast, 5 oz. of salt. 3Iode,—Boil the rice in water until it is quite tender; pour off the water, and put the rice, before it is cold, to the flour. Mix these well together with the yeast, salt, and sufficient warm water to make the whole into a smooth dough ; let it rise by the side of the fire, then form it into loaves, and bake them from 1^ to 2 hours, according to their size. If the rice is boiled in milk instead of water, it makes very delicious bread or cakes. When boiled in this manner, it may be mixed with the flour without straining the liquid from it.

If made into 2 loaves, they will require from I5 to 2 hours* baking. Time.—li to 2 hours. Maize.—IText to wlieat and rice, maize is the grain most used in the nourishraent of man. In Asia, Africa, and America, it is the principal daily food of a large portion of the population, espe- cially of the colonists. In some of the provinces of France, too, it is consumed in large quantities. There are eight varieties of the maize; the most productive is the maize of Cusco. The flour of maize is yellow, and it contains an oily matter, which, when fresh, gives it an agreeable flavour and odour; but the action of the air on it soon develops rancidity. If carried any distance, it should be stored away in air-tight vessels. An excellent soup is prepared with meat and maize-flour. The inhabitants of some countries, where wheat is scarce, make, with maize and water, or milk and salt, a kind of biscuit, which is pleasant in taste, but indigestible. Some of the prepa- rations of maize-flour are very good, and, when partaken in moderation, MAIZE PLAMT. suitable food for almost everybody. eae of maize. SODA BBS AD. 1722. Ikgeedients.—To every 2 lbs. of flour allow 1 teaspoonfu] h of tartaric acid, 1 teaspoonful of salt, 1 teaspoonful of car- J bonate of soda, 2 breakfast-cupfuls of cold milk. Mode,~Let the tartaric acid and salt be reduced to the finest possible powder ; then mix them well with the flour. Dissolve the soda in the milk, and pour it several times from one basin to another, before adding it to the flour. Work the whole quickly into a light dough, divide it into ' 2 loaves, and put them into a well-heated oven immedi- ately, and bake for an hour. Sour milk or buttermilk may be used, but then a little less acid will be needed. \\ Tifne,—1 hour. Polish and Pomeeaniatt Wheat are accounted by authorities most excellent. Large raft-like barges convey this grain down the rivers, from the interior of the country to the seaports. This corn is described as being white, hard, and thin-skinned; and it yields a large quantity of flour, having a small proportion of bran. EXCELLESTT BOLIiS. 1723.

Ifode.—Warm the butter in the milk, add to it the yeast and salt, and mix these ingredients well together. Put the flour into a pan, stir in the above ingredients, and let the dough rise, covered in a warm place. Knead it well, make it into rolls, let them rise again for a few minutes, and bake in a quick oven. Kicher rolls may be made by adding 1 or 2 eggs and a larger pro- portion of butter, and their appearance improved by brushing the tops over with yolk of egg or a little milk. Time.—I lb. of flour, divided into 6 rolls, from 15 to 20 minutes. HOT ROLLS. 1724. This dish, although very unwholesome and indigestible, is nevertheless a great favourite, and eaten by many persons. As soon as the rolls come from the baker's, they should be put into the oven, which, in the early part of the morning, is sure not to be very hot; and the rolls must not be buttered until wanted, "When they are quite hot, divide them lengthwise into three; put some thin flakes of good butter between the slices, press the rolls together, and put them in the oven for a minute or tv/o, but not longer, or the butter would oil; take them out of the oven, spread the butter equally over, divide the rolls in half, and put them on to a very hot clean dish, and send them instantly to table. TO MAKE DBY TOAST. 1725. To make dry toast properly, a great deal of attention is re- quired; much more, indeed, than people generally suppose. Never use new bread for making any kind of toast, as it eats heavy, and, besides, is very extravagant. Procure a loaf of household bread about two days old; cut ofl" as many slices as may be required, not quite i inch in thickness; trim ofF the crusts and ragged edges, put the bread on a toasting-fork, and hold it before a very clear fire. Move it backwards and forwards until the bread is nicely coloured; then turn it and toast the other side, and do not place it so near the fire that it blackens. Dry toast should be more gradually made than buttered toast, as its great beauty consists in its crispness, and this cannot be attained unless the process is slow and the bread is allowed gradually to colour. It should never be made long before it is wanted, as it soon becomes tough, unless placed on the fender in front of the fire. As soon as each piece is ready, it should be put into a rack, or stood upon its edges, and sent quickly to table.844 MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKETIY. TO MAKE HOT BUTTEBED TOAST. 1726. A loaf of household bread about two days old answers for making toast better than cottage bread, the latter not being a good shape, and too crusty for the purpose. Cut as many nice even slices as may be required, rather more than 1 inch in thickness, and toast them before a very bright fire, without allowing the bread to blacken, which spoils the appearance and flavour of all toast. When of a nice colour on both sides, put it on a hot plate ; divide some good butter into small pieces, place them on the toast, set this before the fire, and when the butter is just beginning to melt, spread it lightly over the toast. Trim off the crust and ragged edges, divide each round into 4 pieces, and send the toast quickly to table. Some persons cut the slices of toast across from corner to corner, so making the pieces of a three-cornered shape. Soyer recommends that each slice should be cut into pieces as soon as it is buttered, and when all are ready, that they should be piled lightly on the dish they are intended to be served on. He says that by cutting through 4 or 5 slices at a time, all the butter is squeezed out of the upper ones, while the bottom one is swimming in fat liquid. It is highly essential to use good butter for making this dish. MUFFINS. 1727. Ingeedients.—To every quart of milk allow 1^ oz. of German yeast, a little salt; flour. Ilode,—Warm the milk, add to it the yeast, and mix these well together; put them into a pan, and stir in sufficient flour to make the whole into a dough of rather a soft con- sistence ; cover it over with a cloth, and place it in a warm place to rise, and, when light and nicely risen, divide the dough into pieces, and round them to the proper shape with the hands; place them, in a layer of flour about two inches thick, on wooden trays, and let them rise again; when this is effected, they each will exhibit a semi-globular shape. Then place them carefully on a hot-plate or stove, and bake them until they are slightly browned, turning them when they are done on one side. Muffins are not easily made, and are more generally purchased than manufactured at home. To toast thejn, divide the edge of the muffin all round, by pulling it open, to the depth of about an inch, with the fingers. Put it on a toasting-fork, and hold it before a very clear fire until one side is nicely browned, but not burnt; turn, and toast it on the other. Do not toast them too quickly, as, if this is done, the middle of theBREAD, BrSCUITS, AND CAKES. 845 muffin will not be warmed through.

Time.—From 20 minutes to ^ hour to bake them. Sufficient.—Alhvi 1 muffin to each person. CRUMPETS. 1728. These are made in the same manner as muffins; only, in making the mixture, let it be more like batter than dough. Let it rise for about ^ hour; pour it into iron rings, which should be ready on a hot-plate; bake them, and when one side appears done, turn them quickly on the other. To toast them^ have ready a very cto^ fire; put the crumpet on a toasting-fork, and hold it before the fire, not too close, until it is nicely brown on one side, but do not allow it to blacken. Turn it, and brown the other side; then spread it with good butter, cut it in half, and, when all are done, pile them on a hot dish, and send them quickly to table. Muffins and crumpets should always be served on separate dishes, and both toasted and served as expeditiously as possible. Ti7ne.—From 10 to 15 minutes to bake them. tSufficient,—Allow 2 crumpets to each person. PLAIN BUNS. 1729. Ingredients.—To every 2 lbs. of flour allow 6 oz. of moist sugar, i gill of yeast, i pint of milk, i lb. of butter, warm milk. Mode.—FxLt the flour into a basin, mix the sugar well with it, make a hole in the centre, and stir in the yeast a,nd milk (which should be lukewarm), with enough of the flour to make it the thickness of cream. Cover the basin over with a cloth, and let the sponge rise in a warm place, which will be accomplished in about H hour. Melt the butter, but do not allow it to oil; stir it into the other ingredients, with enough warm milk to make the whole into a soft dough; then mould it into buns about the size of an egg; lay them in rows quite 3 inches apart; set them again in a warm place, until they have risen to double their size; then put them into a good brisk oven, and just before they are done, wash them over with a little milk.

Cut the cake into 1 slices, divide each slice in two ; put them on a baking- i sheet, in a slow oven, and when they are of a nice ! brown and quite hard, they are done. They should be kept in a closed tin canister in a dry place, to preserve their crispness. Pannicled Millet.—This is the smallest-seeded of the eorn- plants, being a true grass: but the number of the seeds in each ear makes up for their size. It grows in sandy soils that will not do for I the eultivatiou of many other kinds of grain, and forms the chief I sustenance in the arid districts of Arabia, Syria, N"ubia, and parts of India. It is not cultivated in England, being principally confined to the East. The nations who make use of it grind it, in the primi- tive manner*, between two stones, and make it into a diet which cannot be properly called bread, but rather a kind of soft thin cake half-baked. When we take into account that the Arabians are fond of lizards and locusts as articles of food, their cuisine, altogether, is scarcely a tempting one. PANNICLED MILLET. TO MAKE HUSKS. (Suffolk Recipe.) 1734. Ingbedieitts.—To every lb. of flour allow 2 oz. of butter, J pint of milk, 2 oz. of loaf sugar, 3 eggs, 1 tablespoonful of yeast. Mode.—Put the milk and butter into a saucepan, and keep shaking it round until the latter is melted. Put the flour into a basin with the sugar, mix these well together, and beat the eggs. Stir them with the yeast to the milk and butter, and with this liquid work the flour into a smooth dough. Cover a cloth over the848 MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. basin, and leave the dough to rise by the side of the fire; then knead it, and divide it into 12 pieces; place them in a brisk oven, and bake for about 20 minutes. Take the rusks out, break them in half, and then set them in the oven to get crisp on the other side. When cold, they should be put into tin canisters to keep them dry ; and, if intended for the cheese course, the sifted sugar should be omitted. Time,—20 minutes to bake the rusks; 5 minutes to render them crisp after being divided. Average cost, %d, Sufficient to make 2 dozen rusks. Seasonable at any time. ALMOND ICING FOR CAKES 1735. Ingeedients.—To every lb. of finely-pounded loaf sugaJ allow 1 lb. of sweet almonds^ the whites of 4 eggs, a little rose! water. I Mode.—Blanch the almonds, and pound them (a few at a time) im a mortar to a paste, adding a little rose-water to facilitate the operatioJ Whisk the whites of the eggs to a strong froth; mix them with thJl pounded almonds, stir in the sugar, and beat altogether. When the cake is sufficiently baked, lay on the almond icing, and put it into the oven to dry. Before laying this preparation on the cake, great care must be taken that it is nice and smooth, which is easily accomplished by well beating the mixture. SUGAR ICING FOR CAKES. 1736. INGKEDIEITTS.--T0 every lb. of loaf sugar allow the whites of 4 eggs, 1 oz. of fine starch. Mode.—BQ2it the eggs to a strong froth, and gradually sift in thd sugar, which should be reduced to the finest possible powder, ani gradually add the starch, also finely powdered. Beat the mixturei well until the sugar is smooth; then with a spoon or broad knife lay the icing equally over the cakes. These should then be placed in ^ very cool oven, and the icing allowed to dry and harden, but not to colour. The icing may be coloured with strawberry or cuiTant- juice, or with prepared cochineal. If it be put on the cakes as soon as they are withdrawn from the oven, it will become firm and hard by the time the cakes are cold. On very rich cakes, such as wedding,' christening cakes, &c., a layer of almond icing, No. 1735, is usually spread over the top, and over that the white icing as described. AU-i iced cakes should be kept in a very dry place. IBREAD, BlttUUITS, AND CAKES. 849 BISCUIT POWDER, generaUy used for Infants' Food. 1737.

Carbonate op Soda.—Soda was called the mineral alkali, because it was originally dug up out of the ground in Africa and other countries : this state of carbonate of soda is called natron. But carbonate of soda is likewise procured from the combustion of marine plants, or such as grow on the sea-shore. Pure carbonate of soda is employed for making effervescing draughts, with lemon-juice, citric acid, or tartaric acid. The chief constituent of soda, the alkali, has been used in France from time immemorial in the manufacture of soap and glass, two chemical productions which employ and keep in circulation an immense amount of capital. A small pinch of carbonate of soda will give an extraordinary lightness to puff pastes ; and, inti'oduced into the teapot, will extract the full strength of the tea. But its qualities have a powerful effect upon delicate con- stitutions, and it is not to be used incautiously in any preparation. A UICS PLAIN CAKE. 1766.

Beat the cake well for 20 minutes, and put it into a round tin, lined at the bottom and sides with a strip of white buttered paper. Bake it from Ij to 2 hours, and let the oven be well heated when the cake is first put in, as, if this is not the case, the currants will all sink to the bottom of it. To make this preparation light, the yolks and whites of the eggs should be beaten separately, and added separately to the other ingredients. A glass of wine is sometimes added to the mixture; but this is scarcely necessary, as the cake will be found quite rich enough without it. Time.—1^ to 2 hours.

Bkead-making US' Spaix.—The bread in the south of Spain is delicious : it is white as snow, close as cake, and yet very lie;ht; the flavour is most admirable, for the wheat is good and pure, and the bread well kneaded. The way they make this bread is as follows :—From large round panniers filled with wheat they take out a handful at a time, sorting it most carefully and expeditiously, and throwing every defective grain into another basket. This done, the wheat is ground between two circular stones, as it was ground in Egypt 2,000 years ago (see ISTo. 117), the requisite rotary motionbeing given by a blindfolded mule, which paces round and round with untiring patience, a bell being attached to his neck, which, as long as he is in movement, tinkles on; and when it stops, he is urged to his duty by the shout of'' Arre, miila," from some one within heai'iug. When ground, the wheat is sifted through three sieves, the last of these being so fina that only the pure flour can pass through it: this is of a pale apricot-colour. The bread is made in the evening. It is mixed with only sufficient water, with a little salt in it, to make it into dough : a very small quantity of leaven, or fermenting mixture, is added. The Scripture says," A little leaven leaveneththe whole lumpbut in England, to avoid the trouble of kneading, many put as much leaven or yeast in one batch of household bread as in Spain would last them a week for the six or eight donkey-loads of bread they send every night from their oven. The dough made, it is put iuto sacks, and carried on the donkeys' backs to the oven in the centre of the village, so as to bake it immediately it is kneaded. On arriving there, the dough is divided into portions weighing 3 lbs. each. Two long narrow wooden tables on trestles are then placed down the room; and now a curious sight may be seen. About twenty men (bakers) come in and range themselves on one side of the tables. A lump of dough is handed to the nearest, which he commences kneading and knocking about with all his might for about 3 or 4 minutes, and then passes it on to his neighbour, who does the same; and so on successively until all have kneaded it, when it becomes as soft as new putty, and ready for the oven. Of course, as soon as the first baker has handed the first lump to his neighbour, another is given to him, and so on till the whole quantity of dough is successively kneaded by them all. The bakers' wives and daughters shape the loaves for the oven, and some of them are very small, and they are baked immediately. The ovens are very large, and not heated by tires U7ider them; but a quantity of twigs of the herbs of sweet marjoram and thyme, which cover the hills in great profusion, are put in the oven and ignited. They heat the oven to any extent required; and, as the bread gets baked, the oven gets gradually colder; ?o the bread is never burned. They knead the bread in Spain with such force, that the palm of the hand and the second joints of the fingers of the bakers are covered with corns; and it so affects the chest, that they cannot work more than two hours at a time. SNOW-CAKE. 1777. Ingeedients.—5 lb. of tous-les-mots, I lb. of white pounded sugar, I lb. of fresh or washed salt butter, 1 egg, the juice of 1 lemon.

Line a flat tin, with raised edges, with a sheet of buttered paper; pour in the cake, and put it into the oven. It must be rather slow, and the cake not allowed to brown at all. If the oven is properly heated, 1 to 1^ hour will be found long enough to bake it.

Ingredients.—2 lbs. of leaf, or the inside fat of a pig; Ulb. of hour, ^ lb. of moist sugar, ^ lb. of currants, 1 oz. of candied lemon- peel, ground allspice to taste. llocle.—Cut the leaf, or Head, as it is sometimes called, into small pieces; put it into a large dish, which place in a quick oven; be careful that it does not burn, and in a short time it will be reduced to oil, with the small pieces of leaf floating on the surface; and it is of these that the cakes should be made. Gather all the scraps together, put them into a basin wdth the hour, and rub them well together. Add the currants, sugar, candied peel, cut into thin slices, and the ground allspice. When ail these ingredients are w^ell mixed, moisten with sufficient cold water to make the whole into a nice paste; roll it out thin, cut it into shapes, and bake the cakes in a quick oven from 15 to 20 minutes. These are very economical and wholesome cakes for children, and the lard, melted at home, produced from the dead, is generally better than that you purchase. To prevent the lard from burning, and to insure its being a good colour, it is better to melt it in u jar placed in a saucepan of boiling water; by doing it in this manner, there will be no chance of its discolouring. Ti7ne.—15 to 20 minutes. Sufficient to make 3 or 4 dozen cakes. Seasonable from ^rieptember to March. 3 K866 MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY.. WheA-T is liable to several diseases, which affect the flour made from it, and render it uufit for good bread. The principal of these are the Wight, mildew, and smut, which are occasioned by microscopic fungi, which sow themselves and grow upon the stems and ears, destroying the nutritive principles, and intro- ducing matter of a deleterious kind. The farmer is at the utmost pains to keep away these intruders. Wheat, as well as all kinds of corn, is also ver^ liable to be injured by being stacked before it is quite dry ; in which ease it will heat, and become musty in the ricks. In wet harvests it is sometimes impossible to get it sufficiently dried, and a great deal of corn is thus often spoiled. It is generally reckoned that the sweetest bread is made from wheat threshed out before it is stacked; which shows the importance of studying tha best modes of preserving it. The erudite are not agreed as to the aboriginal country of corn: some say it is Egypt, others Tartary; and the learned Bailly, as well as the traveller Pallas, affirms that it grows spontaneously in Siberia. Be that as it may, the Phociaus brought it to Marseilles before the Komans had penetrated into Gaul. The Gauls ate the corn cooked or bruised in a mortar : they did not know, for a long time, how to make fermented bread. SCOTCH SHOBTBBEAD. 1780.

Beverages are innumerable in their variety ; but the ordinary bever- ages drunk in the British isles^ may be divided into three classes:—1. Beverages of the simplest kind not fermented. 2. Beverages, consisting of water, contain- ing a considerable quantity of carbonic acid. 3. Beverages composed partly of fermented liquors. Of the first class may be mentioned,—water, toast-and- water, barley-water, eau sucr^, lait sucr€, cheese and milk whey, milk-and- water, lemonade, orangeade, sherbet, apple and pear juice, capillaire, vinegar- and-water, raspberry vinegar and water. 1790. Of the common class of beverages, consisting of water impregnated with carbonic acid gas, we may name soda-water, single and double, ordinary effervescing draughts, and ginger-beer. 1791. The beverages composed partly of fermented liquors, are hot spiced wines, bishop, egg-flip, egg-hot, ale posset, sack posset, punch, and spirits-and- water. 1792. We will, however, forthwith treat on the most popular of our beverages, beginning with the one which makes *' the cup that cheers but not inebriates." 1793. The beverage called tea has now become aknost a necessary of life. Previous to the middle of the 17th century it was not used in England, and it was wholly unknown to the Greeks and Romans. Pepys says, in his Diary,— September 25th, 1661.—I sent for a cup of tea (a China drink), of which I had never drunk before." Two years later it was so rare a commodity in872 MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. England, that the English East-India Company bought 2 lbs. 2 oz. of it, as a present for his majesty. In 1666 it was sold in London for sixty shillings a pound. From that date the consumption has gone on increasing from 5,000 lbs. to 50,000,000 lbs. 1794. Linnceus was induced to think that there were two species of tea-plant, one of which produced the black, and the other the green teas; but later observa- tions do not confirm this. When the leaves of black and green tea are expanded by hot water, and,,examined by the botanist, though a difference of character is perceived, yet this is not sufficient to authorize considering them as distinct species. The tea-tree flourishes best in temperate regions ; in China it is in- digenous. The part of China where the best tea is cultivated, is called by us the " tea country." The cultivation of the plant requires great care. It is raised chiefly on the sides of hills ; and, in order to increase the quantity and improve the quality of the leaves, the shrub is pruned, so as not to exceed the height of from two to three feet, much in the same manner as the vine is treated. in France. They pluck the leaves, one selecting them according to the kinds of tea required ; and, notwithstanding the tediousness of the operation, each labourer is able to gather from four to ten or fifteen pounds a day. When the trees attain to six or seven years of age, the produce becomes so inferior that they are removed to make room for a fresh succession, or they are cut down to allow of numerous young shoots. Teas of the finest flavour consist of the youngest leaves; and as these are gathered at four different periods of the year, the younger the leaves the higher flavoured the tea, and the scarcer, and consequently the dearer, the article. 1795. The various names by which teas are sold in the British market are corruptions of Chinese words. There are about a dozen different kinds ; but the principal are Bohea, Congou, and Souchong, and signify, respectively, in- ferior, middling, and superior. Teas are often perfumed and flavoured with the leaves of different kinds of plants grown on purpose. Different tea-farms in China produce teas of various qualities, raised by skilful cultivation on various soils. 1796. Tea, when chemically analyzed, is found to contain woody fibre, mucilage, a considerable quantity of the astringeiit principle, or tannin, a narcotic principle, which is, perhaps, connected with a peculiar aroma. The tannin is shown by its striking a black colour with sulphate of iron, and is the cause of the dark stain which is always formed when tea is spilt upon buff-coloured cottons dyed with iron. A constituent called Theine has also been discovered in tea, supposed to be identical with Caffei lie, one of the constituents of coffee. Liebig says, " Theine yields, in certain processes of decomposition, a series of most remarkable products, which have much analogy with those derived from^ uric acid in similar circumstances. . . The infusion of tea differs from that of coffee, by containing iron and manganese. . . Wo have in tea, of many kinds, a beverage which contains the active constituents of the most powerful mineral springs, and, however small the amount of ironBEVERAGES. 8/3 may be which we daily take in this form, it cannot he destitute of influence on the vital processes." 1797. Chinese tea has frequently been adulterated in this country, by tho admixture of the dried leaves of certain plants. The leaves of the sloe, white thorn, ash, elder, and some others, have been employed for this purpose ; Euch as the leaves of the speedwell, wild germander, black currants, syringa, purple-spiked willow-herb, sweet-brier, and cherry-tree. Some of these are harmless, others are to a certain degree poisonous; as, for example, are the leaves of all the varieties of the plum and cherry tribe, to which the sloe belongs. Adulteration by means of these leaves is by no means a new species of fraud ; and several acts of parHament, from the time of George II., have been passed, specifying severe penalties against those guilty of the offence, ■which, notwithstanding numerous convictions, continues to the present time. 179S. In the purchase of tea, that should be chosen which possesses an agreeable odour and is as whole as possible, in order that the leaf may be easily examined. The greatest care should be taken that it has not been exposed to the air, which destroys its flavour, 1799. It w^ould be impossible, in the space at our command, to enumerate the various modes adopted in different countries for making coffee ;" that is, the phrase commonly tmderstood to mean the complete preparation of this delicious beverage for drinking. For performing this operation, such recipes or methods as we have found most i^ractical will be inserted in their proper place; but the following facts connected with coffee will be found highly interesting. 1800. The introduction of coffee into this country is comparatively of recent date. We are assured by Bruce that the coffee-tree is a native of Abj^ssinia, and it is said to have*been cultivated in that country from time immemorial. 1801. It appears that coffee was first introduced into England by Daniel Edwards, a Turkey merchant, whose servant, Pasqua, a Greek, understood the manner of roasting it. This servant, under the patronage of Edwards, estab- lished the first coffee-house in London, in George Yard, Lombard Street. Coffee v/as then sold at four or five guineas a pound, and a duty was soon afterwards laid upon it of fourpence a gallon, when made into a beverage. In the course of two centuries, however, this berry, unknown originally as au article of food, except to some savage tribes on the confines of Abyssinia, has made its way through the whole of the civilized world. Mahommedans of all ranks drink coffee twice a day ; it is in universal request in France ; and tho demand for it throughout the British isles is daily increasing, the more espe- cially since so much attention has been given to mechanical contrivances for roasting and grinding the berry and preparing the beverage. 1802. Of the various kinds of coffee the Arabian is considered the best. It IS gro wn chiefly in the districts of Aden and Mocha; whence the name of onr874 MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. Mocha coffee. Mocha coffee has a smaller and rounder bean than any other, and likewise a more agreeable smell and taste. The next in reputation and quality is the Java and Ceylon coffee, and then the coffees of Bourbon and Martinique, and that of Berbice, a district of the colony of British Guiana. The Jamaica and St. Domingo coffees are less esteemed. 1803. A considerable change takes place in the arrangement of the constituents of coffee by the application of heat in roasting it. Independently of one of the objects of roasting, namely, that of destroying its toughness and rendering it easily ground, its tannin and other principles are rendered partly soluble in water ; and it is to the tannin that the brown colour of the decoction of coffee is owing. An aromatic flavour is likewise developed during torrefaction, which is not perceived in the raw berry, and which is not produced in the greatest perfection until the heat has arrived at a certain degree of temperature ; but, if the heat be increased beyond this, the flavour is again dissipated, and little remains but a bitter and astringent matter with carbon. 1804. The roasting of coffee in the best manner requires great nicety, and much of the qualities of the beverage depends upon the operation. The roasting of coffee for the dealers in London and Paris has now become a separate branch of business, and some of the roasters perform the operation on a great scale, with considerable skill. Roasted coffee loses from 20 to 30 per cent, by sufficient roasting, and the powder suffers much by exposure to the air; but, while raw, it not only does not lose its flavour for a year or two, but improves by keeping. If a cup of the best coffee be placed upon a table boiling hot, it will fill the room with its fragrance ; but the coffee, when warmed again after being cold, will be found to have lost most of its flavour. 1805. To have coffee in perfection, it should be roasted and ground just before it is used, and more should not be ground at a time than is wanted for immediate use, or, if it be necessary to grind more, it should be kept closed from the air. Coffee readily imbibes exhalations from other substances, and thus often acquires a bad flavour : brown sugar placed near it will communicate a disagreeable flavour. It is stated that the coffee in the West Indies has often been injured by being laid in rooms near the sugar-w^orks, or where rum is distilled ; and the same effect has been produced by bringing over coffee in the same ships with rum and sugar. Dr. Moseley mentions that a few bags of pepper, on board a ship from India, spoiled a whole cargo of coffee. 1806. With respect to the quantity of coffee used in making the decoction, much depends upon the taste of the consumer. The greatest and most common fault in English coffee is the too small quantity of the ingredient. Count Rumford says that to make good coffeee for drinking after dinner, a pound of good Mocha coffee, which, when roasted and ground, v/eighs only thirteen ounces, serves to make fifty-six fall cups, or a little less than a quarter of an ounce to a coffee-cup of moderate size.RECIPES. CHAPTER XXXYII. TO MAKE CHOCOLATE. 1807. Ingredients.—Allow ^ oz. of chocolate to each person; to every oz. allow J pint of water, i pint of milk. 3fode.—Make the milk-and-water hot; scrape the chocolate into it, and stir the mixture constantly and quickly until the chocolate is dissolved; bring it to the boiling-point, stir it well, and serve directly with white sugar. Chocolate prepared with in a mill, as shown in the engraving, is made by putting in the scraped chocolate, pouring over it the boiling milk-and-water, and milling it over the hre until hot and frothy. Sufficient.—Allow i oz. of cake chocolate to each person, MILL. Chocolate and Cocoa.—Botli tliese preparations are made from the seeds or beans of tlie cacao-tree, which grows in the West Indies and South America. The Spanish, and the proper name, is cacao, not cocoa, as it is generally spelt. From this mistake, the tree from which the beverage is procured has been often confounded with the palm that produces the edible cocoa-nuts, which are the produce of the cocoa-tree (Cocos nucifera), whereas the tree from which chocolate is procured is very different (the Theohroma cacao), The cocoa-tree was cultivated by the aboriginal inhabitants of South America, particularly in Mexico, where, according to Humboldt, it was reared by Montezuma. It was traus- Elanted thence into other dependencies of the Spanish monarchy in 1520 ; and it was so ighly esteemed by Linnasus as to receive from him the name now conferred upon it, of Theobroma, a term derived from the Greek, and signifying food for gods." Chocolate has always been a favourite beverage among the Spaniards and Creoles, and was considered here as a great luxury when first introduced, after the discovery of America; but the high duties laid upon it, confined it long almost entirely to the wealthier classes. Before it was subjected to duty, Mr. Bryan Edwards stated that cocoa plantations were numerous in Jamaica, but that the duty caused their almost entire ruin. The removal of this duty has increased their cultivation. (For engraving of cocoa-bean, see No. 1816.) TO MAKE ESSENCE OF COFFEE. 1808. Ingredients.—To every \ lb. of ground coffee allow 1 small teaspoonful of powdered chicory, 3 small teacupfuls, or 1 pint, of water. 3fode.—Let the coffee be freshly ground, and, if possible, freshly roasted; put it into a percolator, or filter, with the chicory, and pour slowly over it the above proportion of boiling water. When it has all filtered through, warm the coffee sufficiently to bring it to the87S MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKICRT. simmering-point, but do not allow it to boil; then filter it a second time, put it into a clean and dry bottle, cork it well, and it will remain good for several days. Two tablespoonfuls of this essence are quite sufficient for a breakfast-cupful of hot milk. This essence will be found particularly useful to those persons who have to rise extremely early ; and having only the milk to make boiling, is very easily and quickly prepared. When the essence is bottled, pour another 3 tea- cupfuls of hoiling water slowly on the grounds, which, when filtered through, will be a very weak coffee. The next time there is essence to be prepared, make this weak coffee boiling, and pour it on the ground coffee instead of plain water: by this means a better coffee will be obtained. Never throw away the grounds without having made use of them in this manner ; and always cork the bottle well that contains this preparation, until the day that it is wanted for making the fresh essence. Time.—To be filtered once, then brought to the boiling-point, and filtered again. Average cost, with coffee at Is. ^d, per lb., Q>d. Sufficient,—Allow 2 tablespoonfuls for a breakfast-cupful of hot milk. TO BOAST COFFEE. {A French Hecij^e.) 1809. It being an acknowledged fact that Frcnck coffee is clocideclly superior to that made in England, and as tlie roasting of the berry is of great impor- tance to the flavour of the preparation, it will be useful and interesting to know how they manage these things in France. In Paris, there are two houses justly celebrated for the flavour of their coffee,—La liaison Corcellet and La Maison Royer de Charires; and to obtain this flavour, before roasting they add to every 3 lbs. of coffee a piece of butter the size oi a nut, and a dessert- spoonful of powdered sugar: it is then roasted in the usual manner. Tho addition of the butter and sugar develops the flavour and aroma of the berry; but it must be borne in mind, that tho quality oi the butter must be o.. tho very best description. TO MAKE COFFEE. 1810. Ingeedients.—Allow 4 oz., or 1 tablespoonful, of ground coffee to each person; to every oz. of coffee allow i pint of water. 3fode.—To make coffee good, it should never he hoiled, but the boil- ing water merely poured on it, the same as for tea. The coffee should always be purchased in the berry,—if possible, freshly roasted; and it should never be ground long before it is wanted for use. There are very many new kinds of coffee-pots, but the method of making theBEVERAGES. 877 LOYSEL S HYDKOSTATIC UEIT. coffee is nearly always the same ; namely, pouring the boiling water on the powder, and allowing it to filter through. Our illustration shows one of LoyseFs Hydrostatic Urns, which are admirably adapted for making good and clear cofiee,which should be made in the following, manner :—Warm the urn with boiling water, remove the lid and movable filter, and place the ground coffee at the bottom of the urn. Put the movable filter over this, and screw the lid, inverted, tightly on the end of the centre pipe. Pour into the inverted lid the above proportion of boiling water, and when all the water so poured has , disappeared from the funnel, and made its way down the centre pipe \ and up again through the ground cofiee by hydrostatic x)ressure^ un- screw the lid and cover the urn. Pour back direct into the urn, not through the fimnel^ one, tv/o, or three cups, according to the size of the percolator, in order to make the infusion of uniform strength; the contents will then be ready for use, and should run from tlie tap strong, hot, and clear. The coffee made in these urns generally turns out very good, and there is but one objection to them,—the coffee runs rather slowly from the tap. This is of no consequence where there is a small party, but tedious where there are many persons to provide for. A remedy for this objection may be suggested; namely, to make the coffee very strong, so that not more than J of a cup would be required, as the rest would be filled up with milk. Making coffee in filters or percolaters does away with the necessity of using isinglass, white of egg, and various other preparations to clear it. Coffee should always be served very hot, and, if possible, in the same vessel in which it is made, as pouring it from one pot to another cools, and conse- quently spoils it. Many persons may think that the proportion of water we have given for each oz. of cofiee is rather small; it is so, and the coffee produced from it will be very strong ; ^ of a cup will be found quite sufficient, which should be filled with nice hot milk, or milk and cream mixed. This is the cafe au lait for which our neighbours over the Channel are so justly celebrated. Should the ordinary method of making coffee be preferred, use double the quan- tity of water, and, in pouring it into the cups, put in more coffee and less milk. Sufficient.—Fqv very good coffee, allow I oz., or 1 table-spoonful, to each person.878 MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY, A VERY SIMPLE METHOD OF MAKING COFFEE. 1811. Ingredients.—Allow i oz., or 1 tablespoonful, of coffee to eacli person; to every oz. allow J pint of water. Mode.—ILBYe a small iron ring made to fit the top of the coffee-pot inside, and to this ring sew a small muslin bag (the muslin for the purpose must not be too thin). Fit the bag into the pot, pour some boiling water in it, and, when the pot is well warmed, put the ground coffee into the bag ; pour over as much boiling water as is required, close the lid, and, when all the water has filtered through, remove the bag, and send the coffee to table. Making it in this manner pre- vents the necessity of pouring the coffee from one vessel to another, which cools and spoils it. The water should be poured on the coffee gradually, so that the infusion may be stronger; and the bag must be well made, that none of the grounds may escape through the seams, and so make the coffee thick and muddy. Sttfficient,—'Allow 1 tablespoonful, or i oz., to each person. The Copfei: Plant grows to tlie height of about twelve or fifteen feet, with leaves not unlike those of the common laurel, although more pointed, and not so dry and thick. The blossoms are white, much like those of jasmine, and issue from the angles of the leaf- stalks. AYhen the flowers fade, they are succeeded by the coflFee- bean, or seed, which is inclosed in a berry of a red colour, when ripe resembling a cherry. The coffee-beans are prepared by ex- posing them to the sun for a few days, that the pulp may ferment and throw off a strong acidulous moisture. They are then gradually dried for about three weeks, and put into a miU to separate the husk COFFEE. from the seed. CAFE AU LAIT. 1812. This is merely very strong coffee added to a large pro- portion of good hot milk; about 6 tablespoonfuis of strong coffee being quite sufficient for a breakfast-cupful of milk. Of the essence No. 1808, which answers admirably for cafe au lait, so much would not be required. This preparation is infinitely superior to the weak watery coffee so often served at English tables. A little cream mixed with the milk, if the latter cannot be depended on for richness, im- proves the taste of the coffee, as also the richness of the beverage. Sufficient.—6 tablespoonfuis of strong coffee, or 2 tablespoonfuis of the essence, to a breakfast-cupful of milk. Tea and Cofpee.—It is true, says Liebig, that thousands have lived without a know- ledge of tea and coffee; and daily experience teaches us that, under certain circum- stances, they may be dispensed with without disadvantage to the merely animal functions ; but it is an error, certainly, to conclude from this that they may be altogether dispensed with in reference to their effects; and it is a question whether, if we had no tea and no coffee, the popular instinct would not seek for and discover the means of replacing them. Science, which accuses us of so much in these respects, will have, in the firstBEVERAGES. 879 place, to ascertain whether it depends on sensual and sinful inclinations merel}^ that every people of the globe have appropriated some such means of acting on the nervous life, from the shore of the Pacific, where the Indian retires from hfe for days in order to enjoy the bliss of intoxication with koko, to the Arctic regions, where Kamtsehnt- dales and Koriakes prepare an intoxicating beverage from a poisonous mushroom. We think it, on the contrary, highly probable, not to say certain, that the instinct of man, feehng certain blanks, certain wants of the intensified life of our times, which cannot bo satisfied or filled up by mere quantity, has discovered, in these products of vegetable life the true means of giving to his food the desired and necessary quality. CAFE NOIB. 1813. This is usually handed round after dinner, and should be drunk well sweetened, with the addition of a little brandy or liqueurs, which may be added or not at pleasure. The coffee should be made very strong, and served in very small cups, but never mixed with milk or cream. Cafe noir may be made of the essence of coffee No. 1808, by pouring a tablespoonful into each cup, and filling it up with boiling water. This is a very simple and expeditious manner of preparing coffee for a large party, but the essence for it must be made very good, and kept well corked until required for use. TO MAKE TEA. 1814. There is very little art in making good tea; if the water is boiling, and there is no sparing of the fragrant leaf, the beverage will almost invariably be good. The old-fashioned plan of allowing a teaspoonful to each person, and one over, is still practised. Warm the teapot with boiling water ; let it remain for two or three minutes for the vessel to become thoroughly hot, then pour it away. Put in the tea, pour in from i to f pint of boiling water, close the lid, and let it stand for the tea to draw from 5 to 10 minutes ; then fill up the pot with water. The tea vv ill be quite spoiled unless made v/itli water that is actually boiling, as the leaves will not open, and the flavour not be extracted from them ; the beverage will consequently be colourless and tasteless,—in fact, nothing but tepid water. •Where there is a very large party to make tea for, it is a good plan to have two teapots instead of putting a large quantity of tea into one pot; the tea, besides, will go farther. When the infusion has been once completed, the addition of fresh tea adds very little to the strength ; so, when more is required, have the pot emptied of the old leaves, scalded, and fresh tea made in the usual manner. Economists say that a few grains of carbonate of soda, added before the boiling water is poured on the tea, assist to draw out the goodness: if the water is very hard, perhaps it is a good plan, as the soda softens it; but care must be taken to use this ingredient sparingly, as it is liable to give the tea a soapy taste if added in too large a quantity. For880 MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. TEA. mixed tea, the usual proportion is four spoonfuls of black to one of green; more of the latter when the llavour is very much liked; but strong green tea is highly pernicious, and should never be partaken of too freely. Time.—2 minutes to warm the teapot, 5 to 10 minutes to draw the strength from the tea. Sufficient,—Allow 1 teaspoonful to each person, and one over. Tea.—The tea-tree or slirub belonf^s to the class and order of JMonadelphia polyandria in the Linu£ean system, and to the natural order of Aurmifiacece in the system of J ussieu. Lately it has been made into a new order, the Theasia, which includes the Camellia and some other plants. It commonly grows to the height of from three to six feet; but it is said, that, in its wild or native state, it reaches twenty feet or more. In Ctiina it is cultivated in numerous small plantations. In its general appearance, and the form of its leaf, it resembles the myrtle. The blossoms are white and fragrant, not unlike those ot the wild rose, but smaller; and they are succeeded by soft green capsules, containing each from one to three white seeds. These capsules are crusnea for oil, which is in general use in China. A3Sr EXOBLIiBHT SUBSTITUTli FOB MILik Oii CUE AM IN TEA OS, COFFEE. 1815.

Ingeedients.—To every gallon of water allow 6 lbs. of green gooseberries, 3 lbs. of lump sugar. 3Iode.—This wine should be prepared from unripe gooseberries, in order to avoid the flavour which the fruit would give to the wine when in a mature state. Its briskness depends more upon the time i of bottling than upon the unripe state of the fruit, for effervescing I wine can be made from fruit that is ripe as well as that which is unripe. The fruit should be selected when it has nearly attained its ■ full growth, and consequently before it shows any tendency to ripen. I Any bruised or decayed berries, and those that are very small, should be rejected. The blossom and stalk ends should be removed, and the fruit well bruised in a tub or pan, in such quantities as to insure each berry being broken without crushing the seeds. Pour the water (which should be warm) on the fruit, squeeze and stir it with the hand until all the pulp is removed from the skin and seeds, and cover the whole closely for 24 hours; after which, strain it through a coarse bag, and press it with as much force as can be conveniently applied, to extract the whole of the juice and liquor the fruit may : contain. To every 40 or 50 lbs. of fruit one gallon more of hot water may be passed through the marc, or husks, in order to obtain any i soluble matter that may remain, and be again pressed. The juice i should be put into a tub or pan of sufficient size to contain all of it, and the sugar added to it. Let it be well stirred until the sugar is dissolved, and place the pan in a warm situation; keep it closely covered, and let it ferment for a day or two. It must then be drawn off into clean casks, placed a little on one side for the scum that 3 L 2MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. 8S4 arises to be tlirown out, and the casks kept filled with the remaining " must,'* that should be reserved for that purpose. When the active fermentation has ceased, the casks should be plugged upright, again filled, if necessary, the bungs be put in loosely, and, after a few days, when the fermentation is a little more languid (which may be known by the hissing noise ceasing), the bungs should be driven in tight, and a spile-hole made, to give vent if necessary. About November or December, on a clear fine day, the wine should be racked from its lees into clean casks, which may be rinsed with brandy. After a month, it should be examined to see if it is sufiiciently clear for bottling; if not, it must be fined with isinglass, which may be dis- solved in some of the wine: 1 oz. will be sufiicient for 9 gallons. In March or April, or when the gooseberry bushes begin to blossom, the wine must be bottled, in order to insure its being efiervescing. Seasonable,—Koke this the end of May or beginning of June, before the berries ripen. IiEMOIsr SYRUP, .'i 1822. Ingeedients.—2 lbs. of loaf sugar, 2 pints of water, 1 oz. of citric acid, i drachm of essence of lemon. 3fode.—Boil the sugar and water together for J hour, and put it into a basin, where let it remain till cold. Beat the citric acid to a : powder, mix the essence of lemon with it, then add these two ingre- dients to the syrup ; mix well, and bottle for use. Two tablespoonfuls of the syrup are sufficient for a tumbler of cold water, and will be found a very refreshing summer drink.

Ingredients.—5 gallons of water, 28 lbs. of swgciYy 6 quarts of sweet-wort, 6 quarts of tun, 3 lbs. of raisins, 5 lb. of candy, 1 pint of brandy. Mode.—Boil tlie sugar and water together for 10 minutes; skim it well, and put the liquor into a convenient-sized pan or tub. Allow it to cool; then mix it with the sweet-wort and tun. Let it stand for 3 days, then put it into a barrel; here it will work or ferment for another three days or more; then bung up the cask, and keep it undisturbed for 2 or 3 months. After this, add the raisins (whole), the candy, and brandy, and, in 6 months' time, bottle the wine off. Those who do not brew, may procure the sweet-wort and tun from any brewer. Sweet-wort is the liquor that leaves the mash of malt before it is boiled with the hops; tun is the new beer after the whole of the brewing operation has been completed. Ti7ne.—To be boiled 10 minutes; to stand 3 days after mixing ; to ferment 3 days ; to remain in the cask 2 months before the raisins are added ; bottle 6 months after. Seasonable.—Make this in March or October. HOME-MADE ITOYEAU. 1825. Ingredients.—2 oz. of bitter almonds, 1 oz. of sweet ditto, 1 lb. of loaf sugar, the rinds of 8 lemons, 1 quart of Irish whiskey or gin, 1 tablespoonful of clarified honey, i pint of new milk. JibfZe.—Blanch and pound the almonds, and mix with them the sugar, which should also be pounded. Boil the milk; let it stand till quite cold ; then mix all the ingredients together, and let them remain for 10 days, shaking them every day. Filter the mixture through blotting-paper, bottle of£ for use in small bottles, and seal the corks down. This will be found useful for flavouring many sweet dishes. Average cost^ 2s. 9c?.

Mix the brandy with the orange-juice, strained, the rinds of 6 of the oranges pared very thin, and the sugar. Let all stand in a closely-covered jar for about 3 days, stirring it 3 or 4 times a day. "When clear, it should be bottled and closely corked for a year; it will then be ready for use, but will keep any length of time. This is a most excellent stomachic when taken pure in small quantities; or, as the strength of the brandy is very little deteriorated by the other ingredients, it may be diluted with water. | Time.—To be stirred every day for 3 days.

Ikgeedients.—90 Seville oranges, 32 lbs. of lump sugar, water. Mode.—Break up the sugar into small pieces, and put it into a dry, sweet 9-gallon cask, placed in a cellar or other storehouse, where it is intended to be kept. Have ready close to the cask two large pans or wooden keelers, into one of which put the peel of the oranges pared quite thin, and into the other the pulp after the juice has been squeezed from it. Strain the juice through a piece of double muslin, and put it into the cask with the sugar. Then pour about 14 gallon of cold spring water on both the peels and pulp ; let it stand for 24 hours, and then strain it into the cask ; add more water to the peels and pulp when this is done, and repeat the same process every day for a week : it should take about a week to fill up the cask. Be careful to apportion the quantity as nearly as possible to the seven days, and to stir the contents of the cask each day. On the third day after the cask is full, — that is, the tenth day after the commencement of making,—the cask may be securely bunged down. This is a very simple and easy method, and the wine made according to it will be pronounced to be most excellent. There is no troublesome boiling, and all fermentation takes place in the cask. When the above direc- tions are attended to, the wine cannot fail to be good. It should be bottled in 8 or 9 months, and will be fit for use in a twelvemonth after the time of making. Ginger wine may be made in precisely the same manner, only, with the 9-gallon cask for ginger wine, 2 lbs. of the best whole ginger, hruised, must be put with the sugar. It will be found convenient to tie the ginger loosely in a muslin bag. Time.—-Altogether, 10 days to make it.BEVERAGES. 857 Average cost, 2s. 6d, per gallon. Sufficient for 9 gallons.

Ingeedients.—To every 3 pints of the best vinegar allov/ 4j pints of freshly-gathered raspberries; to each pint of liquor allow 1 lb. of pounded loaf sugar, 1 wineglassful of brandy. Mode.—Let the raspberries be freshly gathered; pick them from the stalks, and put ij pint of them into a stone jar ; pour 3 pints of the best vinegar over them, and let them remain for 24 hours; then strain the liquor over another li pint of fresh raspberries. Let them remain another 24 hours, and the following day repeat the process for the third time; then drain off the liquor without pressing, and pass it through a jelly-bag (previously wetted with plain vinegar), into a stone jar. Add to every pint of the liquor 1 lb. of pounded loaf sugar ; stir them together, and, when the sugar is dissolved, cover the jar; set it upon the fire in a saucepan of boiling water, and let it boil for an hour, removing the scum as fast as it rises ; add to each pint a glass of brandy, bottle it, and seal the corks. This is an excellent drink in cases of fevers and colds : it should be diluted with cold water, according to the taste or requirement of the patient. lime.—To be boiled 1 hour.

Ingeedients.—To every 5 lbs= of rhubarb pulp allow 1 gallon of cold spring water; to every gallon of liquor allov/ 3 lbs. of loaf sugar, i oz. of isinglass, the rind of 1 lemon. Jifo<^e.—Gather the rhubarb about the middle of May; wipe it with a wet cloth, and, with a mallet, bruise it in a large wooden tub or other convenient means. When reduced to a pulp, v\^eigh it, and to every 5 lbs. add 1 gallon of cold spring water ; let these remain for 3 days, stirring 3 or 4 times a day ; and, on the fourth day, press the pulp through a hair sieve; put the liquor into a tub, and to every gallon put 3 lbs. of loaf sugar; stir in the sugar until it is quite dissolved, and add the lemon-rind; let the liquor remain, and, in 4, 5, or 6 days, the fermentation will begin to subside, and a crust or head will be formed, which should be skimmed off, or the liquor drawn from it, when the crust begins to crack or separate. Put the wine into a cask, and if, after that, it ferments, rack it off intoMODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY, 888 another cask, and in a fortnight stop it down. If the wine should have lost any of its original sweetness, add a little more loaf sugar, taking care that the cask is full. Bottle it oli in February or March, and in the summer it should be fit to drink. It will improve greatly by keeping ; and, should a very brilliant colour be desired, add a little currant-juice. Seasonable,—Make this about the middle of May. WELSH HECTAB. 1830. In-geedients.—1 lb. of raisins, 3 lemons, 2 lbs. of loaf sugar, 2 gallons of boiling water. Mode,—Cut the peel of the lemons very thin, pour upon it the boiling water, and, when cool, add the strained juice of the lemons, the sugar, and the raisins, stoned and chopped very fine. Let it stand 4 or 5 days, stirring it every day ; then strain it through a jelly-bag, and bottle it for present use. Tz7ne.—4i or 5 days. Average cost. Is. 9d.

Ixgeediekts.—1 bottle of claret, 1 bottle of soda-water, about i lb. of pounded ice, 4 tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar, I teaspoon- ful of grated nutmeg, 1 liqueur-glass of Maraschino, a sprig of green borage. Ilode.—Vxit all the ingredients into a silver cup, regulating the proportion of ice by the state of the weather : if very warm, a larger quantity would be necessary. Hand the cup round with a clean napkin passed through one of the handles, that the edge of the cup may be wiped after each guest has partaken of the contents thereof. Seasonable in summer. Claeets.—All those wines called in England clarets are tlie produce of the country round Bordeaux, or the Bordelais; but it is remarkable that there is no pure wine in Prance known by the name of claret, Nvhich is a corruption of clairct, a term that is applied there to any red or rose-coloured wine. Kound Bordeaux are produced a number of wines of the first quality, which pass under the name simply of vim de Bor- deauxy or have the designation of the particular district where they are made; a| Lafitte, Latour, &c. The clarets brought to the English market are frequently prepared for it by the wine-growers by mixing together several Bordeaux wines, or by adding to them a portion of some other wines; but in France the pure wines are carefully pre- served distinct. The genuine wines of Bordeaux are of great variety, that part being one of the most distinguished in France; and the principal vineyards are those of Medoe, Palus, Graves, and Blanche, the product of each having characters considerably different.8S9 BEVERAGES. 4 small ones, -I lb. of loaf sugar, 1 quart of boiling water.

Should the above pro- portion of sugar not be found sufiicient to suit some tastes, increase the quantity. When borage is not easily obtainable, substitute for it a few slices of cucumber-rind. Seasonable,—Suitable for pic-nics, balls, weddings, and other festive occasions. ChampAGifE.—This, the most celebrated of French wines, is the produce chiefly of the province of that name, and is generally understood in England to be a brisk, eS'er- vesciug, or sparkling ^Yhite wine, of a very fine flavour; but this is only one of the varieties of this class. There is both red and white champagne, and each of these may be either still or brisk. There are the sparkling wines (7?ioz(5se«>r), and the still wines {non-moasseux). The brisk are in general t!ie most highly esteemed, or, at least, are the most popular in this country, on account of their delicate flavour and the agreeable pungency which they derive from the carbonic acid they contain, and to which they owe their briskness. GINGER BEER. 1833. Ingeelieis-ts.—2| lbs. of loaf sugar, li oz. of bruised ginger, 1 oz. of cream of tartar, the rind and juice of 2 lemons, 3 gallons of boiling water, 2 large tablespoonfuls of thick and fresh brewer's j^east. Mode.—Peel the lemons, squeeze the juice, strain it, and put the peel and juice into a large earthen pan, with the bruised ginger, cream of tartar, and loaf sugar. Pour over these ingredients 3 gallons of loiling water; let it stand until just vv^arm, when add the j-cast, which should be thick and perfectly fresh. Stir the contents of the pan well, and let them remain near the fire all night, coveriag the pan over with a cloth. The next day skim off the yeast, and pour the liquor carefully into another vessel, leaving the sediment; then bottle immediately, and tie the corks down, and in 3 days the ginger beer will be fit for use. For some tastes, the above proportion of sugar may be found rather too large, when it may be diminished ; but the beer will not keep so long good.

When the sugar is dissolved, strain the lemonade through a fine sieve or piece of muslin, and, v/hen cool, it will be ready for use. The lemonade will be much improved by having the white of an egg beaten up in it; a little sherry mixed with it, also, makes this beverage much nicer. Average cost, Qd. per quart. Lemonade.—*' There is a current opinion among women," says Brillat Savarin, "which every year causes the death of many young women,—that acids, especially vinegar, are preventives of obesity. Beyoud all doubt, acids have the effect of destroying obesity; but they also destroy health and freshness. Lemonade is, of all acids, the most harmless; but few stomachs can resist it long, i knew, in 1776, at Dijon, a young lady of great beauty, to whom I was attached by bonds of friendship, great, almost, as those of love. One day, when she had for some time gradually grown pale and thin (previously she had a slight embonpoint), she told me in confidence, that, as her young friends had ridiculed her for being fat, she had, to counteract the tendency, been in the habit every day of drinliing a large glass of vinaitjre. She died at eighteen years of age, from the efiect of these potions." TO MAKE I^-EGUS. 1835. Ingeedients.—To every pint of port wine allow 1 quart of boiling water, i lb. of sugar, 1 lemon, grated nutmeg to taste. 3Iode,—As this beverage is more usually drunk at children's parties than at any other, the wine need not be very old or expensive for the purpose, a new fruity wine answering very well for it. Put the wine into a jug, rub some lumps of sugar (equal to I lb.) on the lemon-rind until all the yellow part of the skin is absorbed, then squeeze the juice, and strain it. Add the sugar and lemon-juice to the port wine, with the grated nutmeg; pour over it the boiling water, cover the jug, and, when the beverage has cooled a little, it wdll be fit for use. Negus may also be made of sherry, or any other sweet white wine, but is more usually made of port than of any other beverage. Sufficient.—Allow 1 pint of wine, with the other ingredients in proportion, for a party of 9 or 10 children. A PLEASANT DBIK^K FOB WAEM WEATHEK. 1836.

It does not deteriorate by standing a little, but, of course, is better when taken fresh.BEVERAGES, 891 FOR A SUMMER DRAUGHT. 1837. Ingredients.—The juice of 1 lemon, a tumbler-ful of cold water, pounded sugar to taste, i small teaspoonful of carbonate of soda. 3fode.—Squeeze the juice from the lemon; strain, and add it to the water, with sufScient pounded sugar to sweeten the whole nicely. When well mixed, put in the soda, stir well, and drink while the mixture is in an effervescing state. TO MULL WINE. 1838. Ingeedients.—To every pint of wine allow 1 large cupful of water, sugar and spice to taste. Mode.—In making preparations like the above, it is very dilficult to give the exact proportions of ingredients like sugar and spice, as what quantity might suit one person would be to another quite distasteful. Boil the spice in the water until the flavour is extracted, then add the wine and sugar, and bring the whole to the boiling-point, when serve with strips of crisp dry toast, or with biscuits. The spices usually used for mulled wine are cloves, grated nutmeg, and cin- namon or mace. Any kind of wine may be mulled, but port and claret are those usually selected for the purpose; and the latter requires a very large proportion of sugar. The vessel that the wine is boiled in must be delicately clean, and should be kept exclusively for the purpose. Small tin warmers may be purchased for a trifle, which are more suitable than saucepans, as, if the latter are not scrupulously clean, they will spoil the wine, by imparting to it a very disagreeable flavour. These warmers should be used for no other purposes. TO MAKE HOT PUHCH, 1839. Ingeedients.—i pint of rum, I pint of brandy, ^ib. of sugar, 1 large lemon, 4 teaspoonful of nutmeg, 1 pint of boiling water. Mode,—Rub the sugar over the lemon until it has absorbed all the yellow part of the skin, then put the sugar into a punchbowl; add the lemon-juice (free from pips), and mix these two ingredients well together. Pour over them the boiling water, stir well together, add the rum, brandy, and nutmeg ; mix thoroughly, and the punch will be ready to serve. It is very im- puiccn-Bowti and ladle. portant in making good punch that all the ingredients are thoroughly892 MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKEIIY. incorporated; and, to insnre success, the processes of mixing: must be diligently attended to. Sufficient,—Allow a quart for 4 persons; but this information must be taken cum grano salts; for the capacities of persons for this kind of beverage are generally supposed to vary considerably. Punch is a beverage made of yarious spirituous liquors or wine, liot water, the acid juice of fruits, and sugar. It is considered to be very iptoxicating; but this is probably because the spirit, being partly sheathed by the mucilaginous juice and the sugar, its strength does not appear to the taste so great as it really is. Punch, which was almost universally drunk among the middle classes about iifty or sixty years ago, has almost disappeared from our domestic tables, being superseded by wine. There are many « diiFerent varieties of punch. It is sometimes kept cold in bottles, and makes a most • agreeable summer drink. In Scotland, instead of the Madeira or sherry generally used ; in its manufacture, whiskey is substituted, and then its insidious properties are more than usually felt. Where fresh lemons cannot be had for punch or similar beverages, : crystallized citric acid and a few drops of the essence of lemon will be very nearly the .' same thing. In the composition of " Eegent's punch," champagne, brandy, and veritable ; 2Iartinique 2iVQ required; " Norfolk punchrequires Seville oranges; "Milk punch" : may be extemporized by adding a little hot milk to lemonade, and then straining it through . a jelly-bag. Then there are " Wine punch," " Tea punch," and " French punch," made \ with lemons, spirits, and wine, in fantastic proportions. But of all the compounds of i these materials, perhaps, for a summer drink, the Korth-Americau " mint julep" is the most inviting. Captain Mariyat gives the following recipe for its preparation :—" Put into a tumbler about a dozen sprigs of the tender shoots of mint; upon them put a spoonful of white sugar, and equal proportions of peach and common brandy, so as to fill up one third, or, perhaps, a little less; then take rasped or pounded ice, and fill up the tumbler. Epicures rub the lips of the tumbler with a piece of fresh pineapple; and the tnmbler itself is very often encrusted outside with stalactites of ice. As the ice melts, you drink." The Virginians, says Captain Marryat, claim the merit of having invented this superb compound; but, from a passage in the *' Comus " of Milton, he claims it for his own country. 1840. Ingeedisnts.—1 lb. of ripe white currants, the rind of 2 lemons, I oz. of grated ginger, 1 quart of whiskey, 1 lb. of lump sugar. Jibf/f?.—Strip the currants from the stalks ; put them into a large jug; add the lemon-rind, ginger, and whiskey; cover the jug closely, and let it remain covered for 24 hours. Strain through a hair sieve, add the lump sugar, and let it stand 12 hours longer; then bottle, and cork well. Tiyne,—To stand 24 hours before being strained; 12 hours after the sugar is added.

Let all tlie kitclien utensils used in the preparation of invalids* cookery be delicately and scncpulousl^ clean; if this is not the case, a disagreeable llavour may be imparted to the preparation, which flavour may disgust, and prevent the patient from partaking of the refreshment when brought to him or her. 1842. For invalids, never make a large quantity of one thing, as they seldom require m.uch at a time ; and it is desirable that variety be provided for them. 1843. Alv/ays have something in readiness; a little beef tea, nicely made and nicely skimmed, a few spoonfuls of jelly, &c. &c., that it may be admi- nistered as soon almost as the invalid wishes for it. If obliged to wait a long time, the patient loses the desire to eat, and often turns against the food when brought to him or her. 1844. In sending dishes or preparations up to invalids, let everything look as tempting as possible. Have a clean tray-cloth laid smoothly over the tray ; let the spoons, tumblers, cups and saucers, &c., be very clean and bright. Gruel served in a tumbler is more appetizing than when served in a basin or cup and saucer, 1845. milk is an important article of food for the sick, in warm weather let it be kept on ice, to prevent its turning sour. Many other delicacies may also be preserved good in the same manner for some little time. 1846. If the patient be allowed to eat vegetables, never send them up undercooked, or half raw ; and let a small quantity only be temptingly arranged on a dish. This rule will apply to every preparation, as an invalid is much more likely to enjoy his food if small delicate pieces are served to him. 1847. ^^ever leave food about a sick room; if the patient cannot eat it when brought to him, take it away, and bring it to him in an hour or two's time. Miss Nightingale says, "To leave the patient's untasted food by his side, from meal to meal, in hopes that he will eat it in the interval; is simplyMODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY^ 894 to prevent liim from taking any food at all. She says, ^* I have known patients literally incapacitated from taking one article of food after another by this piece of ignorance. Let the food come at the right time, and be taken away, eaten or "uneaten, at the right time, but never let a patient have ' something always standing' by him, if you don't wish to disgust him of everything." 1848. Never serve beef tea or broth with the smallest loarticle of fat or grease on the surface. It is better, after making either of these, to allow them to get perfectly cold, when all the fat may be easily removed ; then warm up as much 5is may be required. Two or three pieces of clean whity-brown paper laid on the broth will absorb any greasy particles that may be floating at the top, as the grease will cling to the paper. 1849. I^o^st mutton, chickens, rabbits, calves' feet or head, game, fish (simply dressed), and simple puddings, are all hght food, and easily digested. Of course, these things are only partaken of, supposing the patient is recovering. 1850. A mutton chop, nicely cut, trimmed, and broiled to a turn, is a dish to be recommended for invalids ; but it must not be served tvith all the fat at the end, nor must it be too thickly cut. Let it be cooked over a fire free from smoke, and sent up with the gravy in it, between two very hot plates. Nothing is more disagreeable to an invalid than smohed food. .1851. In making toast-and-water, never blacken ihe bread, but toast it only a nice brown. Never leave toast-and-water to m?ike until the moment it is required, as it cannot^then be properly prepared,—at least, the patient will be obliged to drink it warm, which is anything but agreeable. 1852. In boiling eggs for invalids, let the white be just set; if boiled hard, they will be likely to disagree with the patient. 1853. In Miss Nightingale's admirable " Notes on Nursing," a book that no mother or nurse should be without, she says,—You cannot be too careful as to quality in sick diet. A nurse should never put before a patient milk that is sour, meat or soup that is turned, an egg that is bad, or vegetables under- done." Yet often, she says, she has seen these things brought in. to the sick, in a state perfectly perceptible to every nose or eye except the nurse's. It is here that the clever nurse appears,—she will not bring in the peccant article ; but, not to disappoint the patient, she will whip up something else in a few minutes. Eemember, that sick cookery should half do the work of your poor patient's weak digestion. 1854. She goes on to caution nurses, by saying,—"Take care not to spill into your patient's saucer; in other words, take care that the outside bottom rim of his cup shall be quite dry and clean. If, every time he lifts his cup to his lips, he has to carry the saucer with it, or else to drop the liquid upon and to soil his sheet, or bedgown, or pillow, or, if he is sitting up, his dress, you have no idea what a difference this minute want of care on your part makes to his comfort, and even to his willingness for food."RECIPE So CHAPTER XXXIX. TO MAKE ARROWKOOT. 1855. Ingeedients.—Two teaspoonfuls of arrowroot, 3 ta'blespoon- fuls of cold water, i pint of boiling water. Mode.—Mix the arrowroot smoothly in a basin with the cold water, then pour on it the boiling water, stirring all the time. The water must be hoiling at the time it is poured on the mixture, or it will not thicken; if mixed with hot water only, it must be put into a clean saucepan, and boiled until it thickens ; but this is more trouble, and quite unnecessary if the water is boiling at first. Put the arrowroot into a tumbler, sweeten it with lump sugar, and flavour it with grated nutmeg or cinnamon, or a piece of lemon-peel, or, when allowed, 3 tablespoonfuls of port or sherry. As arrowroot is in itself flavour- less and insipid, it is almost necessary to add the wine to make it palatable. Arrowroot made with milk instead of water is far nicer, but is not so easily digested. It should be mixed in the same manner, with 3 tablespoonfuls of cold water, the boiling milk then poured on it, and well stirred. When made in this manner, no wine should be added, but merely sugar, and a little grated nutmeg or lemon-peel. Time.—If obliged to be boiled, 2 minutes. Average cost, 2d. per pint. Sufficient to make i pint of arrowroot. Miss N'iGHTiNaALE says, in her "I^otes on Nursing," that arrowroot is a gi*and dependence of the nurse. As a vehicle for wine, and as a restorative quickly prepared, it is all very well, but it is nothing but starch and water; flour is both more nutritiv3 and less liable to ferment, and is preferable wherever it can be used.

Wash the barley in cold water ; put it into a saucepan with the above proportion of cold water, and when it has boiled for about I hour, strain off the water, and add the 2 quarts of fresh boiling J water. Boil it until the liquid is reduced one half; strain it, and it^ will be ready for use. It may be flavoured with lemon-peel, after being sweetened, or a small piece may be simmered with the barley. Yv^hen the invalid may take it, a little lemon-juice gives this pleasant drink in illness a very nice flavour. ' Time.—To boil until the liquid is reduced one half. i Sufficient to make 1 quart of barley-water. j TO MAKE BEEF TEA. 1858. Ikgeedients.—1 lb. of lean gravy-beef, 1 quart of water, 1 saltspoonful of salt. 3fode.—Have the meat cut without fat and bone, and choose a nice fleshy piece. Cut it into small pieces about the size of dice, and put it into a clean saucepan: Add the water cold to it; put it on the fire,, and bring it to the boiling-point; then skim well. Put in the salt 1 when the water boils, and simyner the h^idindigently from i to f hour» 1 removing any more scum should it appear on the surface. Strain the j tea through a hair sieve, and set it by in a cool place. When wanted i for use, remove every particle of fat from the top ; warm up as much : as may be required, adding, if necessary, a little more salt. This pre- paration is simple beef tea, and is to be administered to those invalids, to whom flavourings and seasonings are not allowed. "When thel patient is very low, use double the quantity of meat to the same pro- portion of water. Should the invalid be able to take the tea prepared in a more palatable manner, it is easy to make it so by following the j directions in the next recipe, which is an admirable one for making | savoury beef tea. Beef tea is always better when made the day before | it is wanted, and then warmed up. It is a good plan to put the tea into a small cup or basin, and to place this basin in a saucepan of; boiling water. When the tea is warm, it is ready to serve.897 INVALID COOKERY. Tvne.—i to f hour. Average cost, 6cl. per pint. Sufficient.—'Mlovi 1 lb. of meat for a pint of good beef tea. Miss Nightingale says, one of the most common errors among nurses, with respect to sick diet, is the belief that beef tea is the most nutritive of all articles. She says, " Just try and boil down a lb. of beef into beef tea; evaporate your beef tea, and see what is left of your beef; you will find that there is barely a teaspoonful of solid nouinshment to ^ pint of water in beef tea. Nevertheless, there is a certain reparative quality in it,—we do not know what,—as there is in tea; but it may be safely given in almost any inflam- matory disease, and is as little to Ise depended upon with the healthy or convalescent, where much nourishment is required." SAVOUBir BEEF TEA. {Soyer's Reci]}c.) 1859. Ingredients.—1 lb. of solid beef, 1 oz. of butter, 1 clove, 2 button onions or ^ a large one, 1 saltspoonful of salt, 1 quart of water. Mode,—Qwi the beef into very small dice; put it into a stewpan with the butter, clove, onion, and salt; stir the meat round over the fire for a few minutes, until it produces a thin gravy; then add the water, and let it simmer gently from 4 to | hour, skimming off every particle of fat. "When done, strain it through a sieve, and put it by in a cool place until required. The same, if wanted quite plain, is done by merely omitting the vegetables, salt, and clove; the butter cannot be objectionable, as it is taken out in skimming. Time.—\ to % hour. Average cost, ScL per pint. Sufficient.—Allow 1 lb. of beef to make 1 pint of good beef tea. Note.—The meat left from beef tea may bo boiled a little longer, and pounded, with spices, kc, for potting. It makes a very nice breakfast dish. Dk. Christison says that " every one will be struck with the readiness with which certain classes of patients will often take diluted meat juice, or beef tea repeatedly, when they refuse all other kinds of food." This is particularly remarkable in cases of gastric fever, in which, he says, little or nothing else besides beef tea, or diluted meat juice, has been taken for weeks, or even months; and yet a pint of beef tea contains scarcely i oz. of anything but water. The result is so striking, that he asks, *' What is its mode of action ? Not simple nutriment; I oz. of the most nutritive material cannot nearly replace the daily wear and tear of the tissue in any circumstances." Possibly, he says, it belongs to a new denomination of remedies. BAKED BEEF TEA. 1860. Ingredients.—1 lb. of fleshy beef, ll pint of water, j salt- spoonful of salt. 3Iode.—Cut the beef into small square pieces, after trimming ofi all the fat, and put it into a baking-jar, with the above proportion of water and salt; cover the jar well, place it in a warm, but not hot oven, and bake for 3 or 4 hours. When the oven is very fierce in the daytime, it is a good plan to put the jar in at night, and let it remain till the next morning, when the tea will be done. It should be strained, 3 MMODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. 898 and put by in a cool place until wanted. It may also be fiaYoared with an onion, a clove, and a few sweet berbs, &c., when the stomach is sufficiently strong to take these. Time.—3 or 4 hours, or to be left in the oven all night. Average cost, 6d. per pint. Sufficient.—Ailovr 1 lb. of meat for 1 pint of good beef tea, BAKED OR STEWED CALF'S FOOT. iB6i. Ii^GBEDiENTS.—1 calf's foot, 1 pint of milk, 1 pint of water, 1 blade of mace, the rind of i lemon, pepper and salt to taste. Mode.—"Well clean the foot, and either stew or bake it in the milk- and-water with the other ingredients from 3 to 4 hours. To enhance the flavour, an onion and a small quantity of celery may be added, if approved; i a teacupful of cream, stirred in just before serving, is also a great improvement to this dish. Time.—Z to 4 hours. Average cost, in full season, 9d. each. Stiffi.cient for 1 person. Seasonable from March to October. CAIiF'S-FOOT BROTH. 1862. Ikgeebients.—1 calf's foot, 3 pints of water, 1 small lump of sugar, nutmeg to taste, the yolk of 1 egg, a piece of butter the size of a nut. Mode.—Stew the foot in the water, with the lemon-peel, veiy gentli/y until the liquid is half wasted, removing any scum, should it rise to the surface. Set it by in a basin until quite cold, then take off every particle of fat. Warm up about \ pint of the broth, adding the butter, sugar, and a very small quantity of grated nutmeg; take it. off the fire for a minute or two, then add the beaten yolk of the egg; keep stirring over the fire until the mixture thickens, but do not allow it to boil again after the egg is added, or it will curdle, and the broth will be spoiled. Time.—-To be boiled until the liquid is reduced one half. Average cost, in full season, 9d. each. Sufficient to make li pint of broth. Seasonable from March to October. CHICKEN BROTH, 1863. Ingeedients.—^ fowl, or the inferior joints of a whole one; 1 quart of water, 1 blade of mace, ^ onion, a small bunch of sweet herbs, salt to taste, 10 peppercorns. 3Iode.—An old fowl not suitable for eating may be converted into Tery good broth, or, if a young one be used, the inferior joints may beINVALID COOKERY. 899 put in the brotli, and the best pieces reserved for dressing in some other manner. Put the fowl into a saucepan, with all the ingre- dients, and simmer gently for H hour, carefully skimming the broth well. When done, strain, and put by in a cool place until wanted ; then take all the fat off the top, warm up as much as may be re- quired, and serve. This broth is, of course, only for those invalids whose stomachs are strong enough to digest it, with a flavouring of herbs, &c. It may be made in the same manner as beef tea, with water and salt only ; but the preparation will be but tasteless and insipid. "When the invalid cannot digest this chicken broth with the flavour- ing, we would recommend plain beef tea in preference to plain chicken tea, which it would be without the addition of herbs, onions, &c. Tvne.—li hour. Sufficient to make rather more than 1 pint of broth. ]SrUTRITIOUS COFFEE. 1864. IkgeedieisTTS.—2 oz. of ground coflee, 1 pint of milk. 3fode.—Let the coffee be freshly ground; put it into a saucepan, with the milk, which should be made nearly boiling before the coffee is put in, and boil both together for 3 minutes; clear it by pouring some of it into a cup, and then back again, and leave it on the hob for a few minutes to settle thoroughly. This coffee may be made still more nutritious by the addition of an egg well beaten, and put into the coffee-cup. Tmie.—5 minutes to boil, 5 minutes to settle. Sufficient to make 1 large breakfast-cupful of coffee. Our great nurse Miss Nightingale remarks, that " a great deal too much against tea is said by wise people, and a great deal too much of tea is given to the sick by foolish people. When you see the natural and almost universal craving in English sick for their •tea,' you cannot but feel that Nature knows what she is about. But a little tea or coffee restores them quite as much as a great deal; and a great deal of tea, and espe- cially of coffee, impairs the little power of digestion they have. Yet a nurse, because she sees how one or two cups of tea or cofi'ee restore her patient, thinks that three or four cups will do twice as much. This is not the case at all; it is, however, certain that there is nothing yet discovered which is a substitute to the English patient for his cup of tea; he can take it when he can take nothing else, and he often can't take anything else, if he has it not. Colfee is a better restorative than tea, but a greater impairer of the digestion. In making coffee, it is absolutely necessary to buy it in the berry, and grind it at home; otherwise, you may reckon upon its containing a certain amount of chicory, at least. This is not a question of the taste, or of the wholesomeness of chicory; it is, that chicory has nothing at all of the properties for which you give coffee, and, therefore, you may as well not give it." THE INVALID'S CUTLET. 1865. Ingeedients.—1 nice cutlet from a loin or neck of mutton, 2 teacupfuls of water, i very small stick of celery, pepper and salt to taste. JfoJe.—Have the cutlet cut from a very nice loin or neck of 3 M 2MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY, 900 mutton; take off all the fat; put it into a stewpan, with the other ingredients; stew very gently indeed for nearly 2 hours, and skim off every particle of fat that may rise to the surface from time to time. The celery should be cut into thin slices before it is added to the meat, and care must be taken not to put in too much of this in- gredient, or the dish will not be good. If the water is allowed to boil fast, the cutlet will be hard. Time—2 hours* very gentle stewing. Average cost, 6d, Siijjieient for 1 person. Seasonable at any time. oa| 1 EEL BROTH. 1 1866. In'GEEDIENTs.—h lb. of eels, a small bunch of sweet herbs, including parsley; i onion, 10 peppercorns, 3 pints of water, 2 cloves, salt and pepper to taste. Mode,—After having cleaned and skinned the eel, cut it into small pieces, and put it into a stewpan, with the other ingredients; simmer gently until the liquid is reduced nearly half, carefully removing the scum as it rises. Strain it through a hair sieve ; put it by in a cool place, and, when wanted, take off all the fat from the top, warm up as much as is required, and serve with sippets of toasted bread. This is a very nutritious broth, and easy of digestion. Time.—To be simmered until the liquor is reduced to half. Average cost, 6c7. Si(i[Jicient to make pint of broth. Seasonable from June to March. EGa WINE. 1867. Ik-geedients.—1 egg, 1 tablespoonful and i glass of cold water, 1 glass of sherry, sugar and grated nutmeg to taste. Mode.—Beat the egg, mixing with it a tablespoonful of cold water; make the wine-and-water hot, but not boiling ; pour it on the egg, stir- rii] g all the time. Add sufficient lump sugar to sweeten the mixture, and a little grated nutmeg; put all into a very clean saucepan, set it on a gentle fire, and stir the contents one way until they thicken, but do not alloiv them to boil. Serve in a glass with sippets of toasted bread or plain crisp biscuits. When the egg is not warmed, the mixture will be found easier of digestion, but it is not so pleasant a drink. Siifjicient for 1 person. TO MAKE GilUEIi. 1868. Ingredients.—1 tablespoonful of Hobinson*s patent groats, 2 tablespoonfuls of cold water, 1 pint of boiling water.001 INVALID COOKERY. 1 3Iode.—M.ix the prepared groats smoothly with the cold water in a basin ; pour over them the boiling water, stirring it all the time. Put it into a very clean saucepan ; boil the gruel for 10 minutes, keeping it well stirred; sweeten to taste, and serve. It may be flavoured with a small piece of lemon-peel, by boiling it in the gruel, or a little grated nutmeg may be put in; but in these matters the taste of the patient should be consulted. Pour the gruel in a tumbler and serve. When wine is allowed to the invalid, 2 tablespoonfuls of sherry or port make this preparation very nice. In cases of colds, the same quantity of spirits is sometimes added instead of wine. Time—10 minutes. Sufficient to make a pint of gruel. INVALID'S JELIiT. 1B69. Iiq-GEEDiENTS.—12 shanks of mutton, 3 quarts of water, a bunch of sweet herbs, pepper and salt to taste, 3 blades of mace, 1 onion, 1 lb. of lean beef, a crust of bread toasted brown. Mode,—Soak the shanks in plenty of water for some hours, and scrub them well; put them, with the beef and other ingredients, into a saucepan with the water, and let them simmer very gently for 5 hours. Strain the broth, and, when cold, take off all the fat. It may be eaten either warmed up or cold as a jelly. Time.—5 hours. Average cost, Is. Svfficient to make from I-2- to 2 pints of jelly. Seasonable at any time. LEMOISTADB FOR INVALIDS. 1870. Ingeedients.—^ lemon, lump sugar to taste, 1 pint of boiling water. 3Iode.—Pare off the rind of the lemon thinly ; cut the lemon into 2 or 3 thick slices, and remove as much as possible of the white out- side pith, and all the pips. Put the slices of lemon, the peel, and lump sugar into a jug; pour over the boiling water ; cover it closely, and in 2 hours it will be fit to drink. It should either be strained or poured off from the sediment. Time.—2 hours. Average costf 2d, Sufficient to make 1 pint of lemonade. Seasonable at any time. NOUBISHING LEMONADE, 1871. Ijtgeedients.—-li pint of boiling water, the juice of 4 lemons, the rinds of 2, J pint of sherry, 4 eggs, 6 oz. of loaf sugar. 3Iode,—Pare off the lemon-rind thinly, put it into a jug with theMODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. 902 sugar, and pour over the boiling water. Let it cool, then strain it j add the wine, lemon-juice, and eggs, previously well beaten, and also strained, and the beverage will be ready for use. If thought desirable, the quantity of sherry and water could be lessened, and milk substi- tuted for them. To obtain the flavour of the lemon-rind properly, a few lumps of the sugar should be rubbed over it, until some of the yellow is absorbed. Tme.—Altogether 1 hour to make it. Average cost, Is. 8d, Sufficient to make 2^ pints of lemonade. Seasonable at any time. TO MAKE MUTTOIT BROTH. 1872. Ijtgredients.—1 lb. of the scrag end of the neck of mutton, 1 onion, a bunch of sweet herbs, i turnip, 3 pints of water, pepper and salt to taste. Mode,—Put the mutton into a stewpan ; pour over the water cold and add the other ingredients. When it boils, skim it very carefully, cover the pan closely, and let it simmer very gently for an hour; strain it, let it cool, take off all the fat from the surface, and warm up as much as may be required, adding, if the patient be allowed to take it, a teaspoonful of minced parsley which has been previously scalded. Pearl barley or rice are very nice additions to mutton broth, and should be boiled as long as the other ingredients. When either of these is added, the broth must not be strained, but merely tho- roughly skimmed. Plain mutton broth v/ithout seasoning is made by merely boiling the mutton, water, and salt together, straining it, letting the broth cool, skimming all the fat off, and warming up as much as is required. This preparation would be very tasteless and insipid, but likely to agree with very delicate stomachs, whereas the least addition of other ingredients would have the contrary effect. Time.—1 hour. Average cost, 7d. Sufficient to make from l| to 2 pints of broth. Seasonable at any time. IVote.—Veal broth may be made in the same manner ; the knuckle of a leg or shoulder is the part usually used for this purpose. It is very good with tho addition of the inferior joints of a fowl, or a few shank-bones. MUTTOIsT BROTH, QUICKLY MADE. 1873, IiMGREDiENTS.—1 or 2 chops from a neck of mutton, 1 pint of water, a small bunch of sweet herbs, J of an onion, pepper and salt to taste. Mode. —Cut the meat into small pieces , put it into a saucepan with the bones, but no skin or fat; add the other ingredients ; cover them INVALID COOKERY. saucepan, and bring the water quickly to boil. Take the lid ofF, and continue the rapid boiling for 20 minutes, skimming it well during the procees; strain the broth into a basin; if there should be any fat left on the surface, remove it by laying a piece of thin paper on the top: the greasy particles will adhere to the paper, and so free the prepara- tion from them. To an invalid nothing is more disagreeable than broth served with a quantity of fat floating on the top ; to avoid this, it is always better to allo',v it to get thoroughly cool, the fat can then be so easily removed. Tijne.—20 minutes after the water boils. Average cost, 5cL Sujjicient to make -| pint of broth. Seasonable at any time. STEWED BABBITS IH MILK. 1874. Iiv^GKEDiEHTS.—2 very young rabbits, not nearly half grown; 1^ pint of milk, 1 blade of mace, 1 dessertspoonful of flour, a little salt and cayenne. 3Iode.~MiK the flour very smoothly with 4 tablespoonfuls of the milk, and when this is well mixed, add the remainder. Cat up the rabbits into joints, put them into a stewpan, Vvdth the milk and other ingredients, and simmer them verif genthj until quite tender. Stir the contents from time to time, to keep the milk smooth and prevent it from burning, i hour will be sufficient for the cooking of this dish. Time,—J hour. Average cost, from Is. to Is. Qch each. Saficient for 3 or 4 meals. Seasojiahle ivom September to February^ BICE-MIIiK. 1875. IitgeedieinTS.—3 tablespoonfuls of rice, 1 quart of milk, gar to taste ; when liked, a little grated nutmeg. Mode.—Well wash the rice, put it into a saucepan vv'ith the milk, and simmer gently until the rice is tender, stirring it from time to time to prevent the milk from burning ; sweeten it, add a little grated nutmeg, and serve. This dish is also very suitable and wholesome for children; it maybe flavoured with a little lemon-peel, and a little finely-minced suet may be boiled with it, which renders it more strengthening and more wholesome. Tapioca, semolina, vermicelli, and macaroni, may all be dressed in the same manner. Time.—From f to 1 hour. Seasonable at any time. TO MAKE TOAST-AISTD-WATEB. 1876. IiTGEEDiENTS.—A slico of bread, 1 quart of boiling water. Mode,—Qui a slice from a stale loaf (a piece of hard crust is better than anything else for the purpose), toast it of a nice brown on every004 MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY, side, but do not alloiv it to hum or hlachen. Put it into a jug, pour the boiling water over it, cover it closely, and let it remain until cold. When strained, it will be ready for use. Toast-and-water should always be made a short time before it is required, to enable it to get cold: if drunk in a tepid or lukewarm state, it is an exceedingly disagreeable beverage. If, as is sometimes the case, this drink is wanted in a hurr}^ put the toasted bread into a jug, and only just cover it with the boiling water ; when this is cool, cold water may be added in the proportion required,—the toast-and-water strained ; it will then be ready for use, and is more expeditiously prepared than by the above method. TOAST SAISTDWICHES. 1877. iNaREDiENTS.—Thin cold toast, thin slices of bread-and- butter, pepper and salt to taste. 3fode.—Place a very thin piece of cold toast between 2 slices of thin bread-and-butter in the form of a sandwich, adding a seasoning of pepper and salt. This sandwich may be varied by adding a little pulled meat, or very fine slices of cold meat, to the toast, and in any of these forms will be found very tempting to the appetite of an invalid. 1878. Besides the recipes contained in this chapter, there are, in the previous chapters on cookery, many others suitable for invalids, which it would be useless to repeat here. Kecipes for fish simply dressed, light soups, plain roast meat, well-dressed vegetables, poultry, simple puddings, jelly, stewed fruits, &c. &c., all of which dishes may be partaken of by invalids and convalescents, yAU be found in preceding chai)ters.DINNERS AND DINING. CHAPTER XL. 1879. Man, it has been said, is a dining animal. Creatures of the inferior races eat and drink ; man only dines. It has also been said that he is a cook- ing animal; but some races eat food without cooking it. A Croat captain said to M. Brillat Savarin, ''When, in campaign, we feel hungry, we knock over the first animal we find, cut off a steak, powder it with salt, put it under the saddle, gallop over it for half a mile, and then eat it." Hunti^men in Dauphiny, when out shooting, have been known to kill a bird^ pluck it, salt and pepper it, and cook it by carrying it some time in their caps. It is equally true that some races of men do not dine any more than the tiger or the vulture. It is not a dinner at which sits the aboriginal Australian, who gnaws his bone half bare and then flings it behind to his squaw. And the native of Terra-del-Fuego does not dine when he gets his morsel of red clay. Dining is the privilege of civilization. The rank which a people occupy in tho grand scale may be measured by their way of taking their meals, as well as by their way of treating their women. The nation vchicli knows hov/ to dine has learnt the leading lesson of progress. It implies both the will and the skill to reduce to order, and surround with idealisms and graces, the nioro material conditions of human existence ; and wherever that will and that skill exist, life cannot be wholly ignoble. 18S0. Dinner, being the grand solid meal of the day, is a matter of con- siderable importance ; and a well-served table is a striking index of human ingenuity and resource. "Their table," says Lord B3-ron, in describing a dinner-party given by Lord and Lady Am.undeville at Norman Abbey,— " Their table was a hoard to tempt even gliosis To pass the Styx for more substantial leasts, I ^Yill not dwell upon ragouts or roasts, Albeit all human history attests That happiness for man—the hungry sinner !— Since Eve ate apples, much depends on dinner.'* And then he goes on to observe upon the curious complexity of the results produced by human cleverness and application catering for the modifications vv'hich occur in civilized life, one of the simplest of the primal instincts:— The mind is lost in mighty contemplatiou Of intellect expended on two courses; And indigestion's grand multiplication Eequires arithmetic beyond my forces. Who v.'ould suppose, from Adam's simple ration, That cookery could have cali'd forth such resources, A s form a science and a nomenclature From guIj the commonest demands of nature ? "I 00^" MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. And we may well say. Who, indeed, would suppose it ? The gulf between the Croat, with a steak under his saddle, and Alexis Soyer getting up a great dinner at the Eeform Club, or even Thackeray's Mrs. Raymond Gray giving " a little dinner " to Mr. Snob (with one of those famous roly-poly puddings'* of hers),—what a gulf it is ! 1881. That Adcim's ^'ration," however, was '^simple," is a matter on which we have contrary judgments given by the poets. When Raphael paid that memorable visit to Paradise,—which we are expressly told by Milton he did exactly at dinner-time,—Eve seems to have prepared a little dinner" not wholly destitute of complexity, and to have added ice-creams and perfumes* Nothing can be clearer than the testimony of the poet on these point'k ;— *' And Eve witliin, due at her home prepared Por dinner savoury fruits, of taste to please True appetite, and not disrelish thirst Of nectarous draughts between . . , With dispatebful looks in haste She turns, on hospitable thoughts iutent, What choice to choose for delicacy best, What order so contrived as not to mix Tastes not well join'd, inelegant, but bring Taste after taste, upheld v/ith kindliest change— * * * ^ * ^ / She tempers dulcet creams then stretvs ilie grGund With rose and odours." It may be observed, in passing, that the poets, though they have more to say about wine than solid food, because the former more directly stimulates the 4 intellect and the feelings, do not flinch from t?ie subject of eating and drinking, J| There is infinite zest in the above passage from Milton, and even more in the " famous description of a dainty supper, given by Keats in his ^^Eve of Saint Agnes." Could Queen M?ib herself desire to sit down to anything nicer, both as to its appointments and serving, and as to its quality, than the collation seiwed by Porphyro in the la'iy's bedroom v/liile she slept ?— " There by the bedside, where the faded moon Made a dim silver twilight, soft he set A table, and, half-anguish'd, threw thereor A cloth of woven crimson, gold, and jet. ***** While he, from forth the closet, brought a heap Of candied apple, quince, and plum, and gourd j With jellies smoother than the creamy curd, And lucent syrups tinct with cinnamon ; Manna and dates, in argosy transferred From Fez ; and spiced dainties, every one, Prom silken Samarcand to cedar'd Lebanon.** But Tennyson has ventured beyond dates, p.nd quinces, and syrups, which may be thought easy to be brought in by a poet. In his idyl of ^' Audley Court" he gives a most appetizing description of a pasty at a pic-nic :— *' There, on a slope of orchard, Francis laid A damask napkin wrought with horse and hound; Brought out a dusky loaf that smelt of home, And, half cut down, a pasty costly made, Where quail and pigeon, lark and leveret, lay Like fossils of the rock, with golden yolks Imbedded and injellied."907 DINNERS AND DINING. We gladly quote passages like these, to show how eatmg and drinking may be surrounded with poetical associations, and how man, using his privilege to turn any and every repast into a feast of reason," with a warm and plentiful flow of soul," may really count it as not the least of his legitimate prides, that he is a dining animal." 1882. It has been said, indeed, that great men, in general, are great diners. This, however, can scarcely be true of any great men but men of action ; and, in that case, it would simply imply that persons of vigorous constitution, who •work hard, eat heartily; for, of course, a Hfe of action requires a vigorous constitution, even though there may be much ilhiess, as in such cases as William III. and our brave General Napier. Of men of thought, it can scarcely be true that they eat so much, in a general way, though even they eat more than they are apt to suppose they do ; for, as Mr. Lewes observes, ^' nerve- tissue is very expensive." Leaving great men of all kinds, however, to get their own dinners, let us, who are not great, look after ours. Dine we must, and we may as well dine elegantly as well as wholesomely. 1883. There are plenty of elegant dinners in modern days, and they were not wanting in ancient times. It is well known that the dinner-party, or symposium, was a not unimportant, and not unpoetical, feature in the life of the sociable, talkative, tasteful Greek. Douglas Jerrold said that such is the British humour for dining and giving of dinners, that if London were to be destroyed by an earthquake, the Londoners would meet at a public dinner to consider the subject. The Greeks, too, were great diners : their social and religious polity gave them many chances of being merry and making others merry on good eating and drinking. Any public or even domestic sacrifice to one of the gods, was sure to be followed by a dinner-party, the remains of the slaughtered offering " being served up on the occasion as a -pious 2nece de resistance ; and as the different gods, goddesses, and demigods, worshipped by the community in general, or by individuals, were very numerous indeed, and some very rehgious people never let a day pass without offering up something or other, the dinner-parties were countless. A birthday, too, was an excuse for d dinner; a birthday, that is, of any person long dead and buried, as well as of a living person, being a member of the family, or otherwise esteemed. Dinners were, of course, eaten on all occasions of public rejoicing. Then, -among the young people, subscription dinners, very much after the manner ^f modern times, were always being got up ; only that they would be eaten not at an hotel, but probably at the house of one of the heterce. A Greek dinner-party was a handsome, well-regulated affair. The guests came in elegantly dressed and crowned with flowers. A slave, approaching each person as he entered, took off his sandals and washed his feet. During the repast, the guests reclined on couches with pillows, among and along which were set small tables. After the solid meal came the *^ symposium " proper, a scene of music, merriment, and dancing, the two latter being supplied chiefly by young girls. There was a chairman, or sjTnposiarch, appointed by the903 MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. company to regulato the drinking ; and it was his duty to mix tlie wine in the mighty bowl." From this bowl the attendants ladled the liquor into goblets, and, with the goblets, went round and round the tables, filling the cups of the guests. 1884. The elegance with which a dinner is served is a matter which depends, of course, partly upon the means, but still more upon the taste of the master and mistress of the house. It may be observed, in general, that there should always be flowers on the table, and as they form no item of expense, there is no reason why they should not be employed every day. 1885. The variety in the dishes which furnish forth a modern dinner-table, does not necessarily imjoly anything unwholesome, or anything capricious. Food that is not well relished cannot be well digested ; and the appetite of tte over-worked man of business, or statesman, or of any dweller in tov/ns, whose occupations are exciting and exhausting, is jaded, and requires stimulation. I^Ien and women who are in rude health, and who have plenty of air and exer- cise, eat the simplest food with relish, and consequently digest it well; but those conditions are out of the reach of many men. They must suit their mode of dining to their mode of living, if they cannot choose the latter. It is in serving up food that is at once appetizing and wholesome that the skill of the modern housewife is severely tasked; and she has scarcely a more important duty to fulfil. It is, in fact, her particular vocation, in virtue of which she may be said to hold the health of the family, and of the friends of the family, in her hands from day to day. It has been said that '^the destiny of nations depends on the manner in which they are fed and a great gastronomist exclaims, *'Tell me what kind of food you eat, and I will tell you what kind of man you are." The same writer has some sentences of the same kind, which are rather hyper- bolical, but worth quoting :—" The pleasures of the table belong to all ages, to all conditions, to all countries, and to all eras; they mingle with all other pleasures, and remain, at last, to console us for their departure. The dis- covery of a new dish confers more happiness upon humanity than the discovery of a new star." 1886. The gastronomist from whom we have already quoted, has some apho- risms and short directions in relation to dinner-parties, which are well deserving of notice :—''Let the number of your guests never exceed twelve, so that tho conversation may be general.* Let the temperature of the dining-room b© about 68°. Let the dishes be few in number in the first course, but propor- tionally good. The order of food is from the most substantial to the lightest. The order of drinking wine is from the mildest to tho most foamy and most perfumed. To invite a person to your house is to take charge of his happiness so long as he is beneath your roof. The mistress of the house should always be certain that the coffee be excellent; whilst the master should be answerable for the quality of his wines and liqueurs." * We have seen this varied by saying tliat the number should never exceed that of tli© Muses or fall below that of the Graces.BILLS OF FARE.

Where, however, a service a la Russe is practicable, there is, perhaps, no mode of serving a dinner so enjoyable as this.MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. 956 SUPPERS. 2139. Much may be done in the arrangement of a supper-table, at a very small expense, provided taste and ingenuity are exercised. The colours and flavours of the various dishes should contrast nicely; there should be plenty of fruit and flowers on the table, and the room should be well lighted. We have endeavoured to show how the various dishes may be placed ; but of course these little matters entirely depend on the length and width of the table used, on individual taste, whether the tables are arranged round the room, whether down the centre, with a cross one at the top, or whether the supper is laid in two separate rooms, c:c. &c. The garnishing of the dishes has also much to do with the appearance of a supper-table. Hams and tongues should be ornamented with cut vegetable flowers, raised pies with aspic jelly cut in dice, and all the dishes garnished sufficiently to be in good taste without looking absurd. The eye, in fact, should be as much gratified as the i3alate. Hot soup is now often served at suppers, but is not placed on the table. The servants fill the plates from a tureen on the buffet, and then hand thom to the guests: when these plates are removed, the business of supper com- mences. -2140. Where small rooms and large parties necessitate having a standing supper, many things enumerated in the following bill of fare may be placed on the buffet. Dishes for these suppers should be selected which may be eaten standing without any trouble. The following list may, perhaps, assist our readers in the arrangement of a buffet for a standing supper, -2141. Beef, ham, andtong-ue sandwicljes, lobster and oyster patties, sausage rolls, meat rolls, lobster salad, dishes of fowls, the latter all cut up ; dishes of sliced ham, sliced tongue, sliced beef, and galantine of veal; various jellies, blancmanges, and creams; custards in glasses, compotes of fruit, tartlets of jam, and several dishes of small fancy pastry ; dishes of fresh fruit, bonbons, sweetmeats, two or three sponge cakes, a few plates of biscuits, and the buffet ornamented with vases of fresh or artificial flowers. The above dishes are quite sufficient for a standing supper ; where more are desired, a supper must then be laid and arranged in the usual manner.BILLS OF FARE. 2142.-BILIi OF FABE FOB A BALL SUPPEB FOB 60 PEBSONS (for Winter).

This bill of fare may be made to answer three or four purposes, placing a wedding cake or christening cake in the centre on a high stand, if required for either of these occasions. A few dishes of fowls, lobster salads, &c. &c., should be kept in reserve to replenish those that are most likely to be eaten first. A joint of cold roast and boiled beef ihould be placed on the buffet, as being something substantial for the gentlemen of the party to partake of. Besides the articles enumerated in the bill of fare, biscuits and wafers will be required, cream-and-water ices, tea, coffee, wines, liqueurs, soda- water, ginger-beer, and lemonade.959 BILLS OP FARE. BBEAKFASTS. 2144. It will not bo necessary to give here a long bill of fare of cold joints, &c., which may be placed on the side-board, and do duty at the breakfast- table. Suffice it to say, that any cold meat the larder may furnish, should be nicely garnished, and be placed on the buffet. Collared and potted meats or fish, cold game or poultry, veal-and-ham pies, game-and-rumpsteak pies, are all suitable dishes for the breakfast-table ; a» also cold ham, tongue, &c. &c. 2145. The following list of hot dishes may perhaps assist our readers in knowing what to provide for the comfortable meal called breakfast. Broiled fish, such as mackerel, whiting, herrings, dried haddocks, &c. ; mutton chops and rump-steaks, broiled sheep's kidneys, kidneys h la maitre d'hdtel, sau- sages, plain rashers of bacon, bacon and poached eggs, ham and poached eggs, omelets, plain boiled eggs, ceufs-au-plat, poached eggs on toast, muffins, toast, marmalade, butter, &c. kc. 1146. In the summer, and when they are obtainable, always have a vase of freshly-gathered flowers on the breakfast-table, and, when convenient, a nicely-arranged dish of fruit : when strawberries are in season, these are particularly refreshing; as also grapes, or even currants. LTJNCHEOKS AIMD SUPPEBS. 2147. The remains of cold joints, nicely garnished, a few sweets, or a little hashed meat, poultry or game, are the usual articles placed on the-table for luncheon, with bread and cheese, biscuits, butter, &c. If a substantial meal is desired, rump-steaks or mutton chops may be served, as also veal cut- lets, kidneys, or any dish of that kind. In families where there is a nursery, the mistress of the house often partakes of the meal with the children, and makes it her luncheon. In the summer, a few dishes of fresh fruit should be added to the luncheon, or, instead of this, a comp6te of fruit or fruit tart, or pudding. 2148. Of suppers we have little to say, as we have already given two bills of fare for a large party, which will answer very well for a smaller number, by reducing the quantity of dishes and by omitting a few. Hot suppers are now very little in request, as people now generally dine at an hour which precludes the possibility of requiring supper; at all events, not one of a substantial kind. Should, however, a bill of fare be required, one of those under the head of Dinners, with slight alterations, will be found to answer for a hot supper.MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY.

It is the custom of ''Society" to abuse its servants,—a fagon de purler, such as leads their lords and masters to talk of the weather, and, when rurally inclined, of the crops,—leads matronly ladies, and ladies just entering on their probation in that honoured and honourable state, to talk of servants, and, as we are told, wax eloquent over the greatest plague in. Jife while taking a quiet cup of tea. Young men at their clubs, also, we aro told, like to abuse their "fellows," perhaps not without a certain pride and pleasure at the opportunity of intimating that they enjoy such appendages to their state. It is another conviction of Society " that the race of good servants has died out, at least in England, although they do order these things better in France; that there is neither honesty, conscientiousness, nor the careful and industrious habits which distinguished the servants of our grandmothers and great-grandmothers ; that domestics no longer know their place; that the introduction of cheap silks and cottons, and, still more recently, those ambiguous ''materials" and tweeds, have removed the land- marks between the mistress and her maid, between the master and his man. 2154. When the distinction really depends on things so insignificant, this is very probably the case ; when the lady of fashion chooses her footman without any other consideration than his height, shape, and tourmire of his calf, it is not surprising that she should find a domestic who has no attach- ment for the family, who considers the figure he cuts behind her carriage, and the late hours he is compelled to keej^, a full compensation for the wages he exacts, for the food he wastes, and for the perquisites he can lay his hands on. Nor should the fast young man, who chooses his groom for his knowingness in the ways of the turf and in the tricks of low horse-dealers, be surprised if he is sometimes the victim of these learned ways. But these are the exceptional cases, which prove the existence of a better state of things. The great masses of society among us are not thus deserted ; there are few families of respectability, from the shopkeeper in the next street to the nobleman whose mansion dignifies the next square, which do not contain am.ong their dependents attached and useful servants ; and where these aro absent altogether, there are good reasons for it. The sensible master and the kind mistress know, that if servants depend on them for their means of962 HOUSEHOLD MANAGET^rEKT. living, in their turn they are dependent on their servants for very many of the comforts of life; and that, with a proper amount of care in choosing servants, and treating them like reasonable beings, and making slight excuses for the shortcomings of human nature, they will, save in some exceptional case, be tolerably well served, and, in most instances, surround themselves with attached dopaestics. 2155. This remark, which is applicable to all domestics, is especially so to men-servants. Families accustomed to such attendants have always about them humble dependents, whose children have no other prospect than domestic service to look forward to ; to them it presents no degradation, but the reverse, to be so employed; they are initiated step by step into the mysteries of the household, with the prospect of rising in the service, if it is a house admitting of promotion,—to the respectable position of butler or house- steward. In families of humbler pr.etensions, where they must look for pro- motion elsewhere, they know that can only be attained by acquiring the good- will of their employers. Can there be any stronger security for their good conduct,—any doubt that, in the mass of domestic servants, good conduct is the rule, the reverse the exception ? 2156. The number of the male domestics in a family varies according to the wealth and position of the master, from the owner of the ducal mansion, with a retinue of attendants, at the head of which is the chamberlain and house- steward, to the occupier of the humbler house, where a single footman, or even the odd man-of-all-work, is the only male retainer. The majority of gentlemen's establishments probably comprise a servant out of livery, or butler, a footman, and coachman, or coachman and groom, where the horses exceed two or three. DUTIES OF THE BUTLEB. 2157. The domestic duties of the butler are to bring in the eatables at breakfast, and wait upon the family at that meal, assisted by the footman, and see to the cleanliness of everything at table. On taking away, he removes the tray with the china and plate, for which he is responsible. At luncheon, he arranges the meal, and waits unassisted, the footman being now engaged in other duties. At dinner, he places the silver and plated articles on the table, sees that everything is in its place, and rectifies what is wrong. He carries in the first dish, and announces in the drawing-room that dinner is on the table, and respectfully stands by the door until the company are seated, when ho takes his place behind his master's chair on the left, to remove the covers, handing them to the other attendants to carry out. After the first course of plates is supplied, his place is at the sideboard to serve the wines, but only when called on. •2x58. The first course ended, he rings the cook*s bell, and hands the dishes ?rom the table to the other servants to carry away, receiving from them the963 DUTIES or THE EUTLER. second course, which he places on the table, removing the covers as before, ond again taking his place at the sideboard. 2159. At dessert, the slips being removed, the butler receives the dessert from the other servants, and arranges it on the table, with plates and glasses, and then takes his place behind his master's chair to hand the wines and ices, while the footman stands behind his mistress for the same purpose, the other attendants leaving the room. Where the old-fashioned practice of having the dessert on the polished table, without any cloth, is still adhered to, the butler should rub off any marks made by the hot dishes before arranging the dessert. 2160. Before dinner, he has satisfied himself that the lamps, candles, or gas-burners are in perfect order, if not lighted, which will usually be the case. Having seiwed every one with their share of the dessert, put the fires in order (when these are used), and seen the lights are all right, at a signal from hig master, he and the footman leave the room. 2i6t. He now proceeds to the drawing-room, arranges the fireplace, and sees to the lights ; he then returns to his pantry, prepared to answer the bell, and attend to the company, while the footman is clearing away and cleaning the plate and glasses. 2162. At tea he again attends. At bedtime he appears with the candles; he locks up the plate, secures doors and windows, and sees that all the fires are safe. 2163. In addition to these duties, the butler, where only one footman is kept, will be required to perform some of the duties of the valet, to pay bills, and superintend the other servants. But the real duties of the butler are in the wine-cellar; there he should be competent to advise his master as to the price and quality of the wine to be laid in ; **fine," bottle, cork, and seal it, and place it in the binns. Brewing, racking, and bottling malt liquors, belong to his oSice, as well as their distribution. These and other drinkables are brought from the cellar every day by his own hands, except where an under- i)utler is kept; and a careful entry-of every bottle used, entered in the cellar- book ; so that the book should alwaj^s show the contents of the cellar. 216-1. The office of butler is thus one of very great trust in a household. Hero, as -elsewhere, honesty is the best policy : the butler should make it his business to under- stand the proper treatment of the diffei'ent wines under his charj^e, vrhich he can easily do from the wine-merchant, and faithfully attend to it; his ov. n reputation will soon compensate for the absence of bribes from unprincipled wine-merchants, if he serves a fjenerous and hospitable master. ^Nothing spreads more rapidly in society than the reputation of a good wine-cellar, and all that is required is wines well chosen and well cared for j and this a Uttle knowledge, carefully applied, will soon supply. 2165. ^^'^^ butler, wo have said, has charge of the contents of the cellars, and it is his duty to keep them in a proper condition, to fine down wine in wood, bottle it off, and store it away in places suited to the sorts. Where Sq29C1 HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT. wine comes into the cellar ready bottled, it is usual to return the same number of empty bottles; the butler has not, in this case, the same inducements to keep the bottles of the different sorts separated; but where the wine is bottled in the house, he will find his account, not only in keeping them separate, but in rinsing them well, and even washing them with clean water as soon as they are empty. 21G6. Tliere are various modes of fining wine: isinglass, gelatine, and gum Arabic are all used for the purpose. Whichever of these articles is used, the process is alwaj's the same. Supposing eggs (the cheapest) to be used,—Draw a gallon or so of the wine, and mix one quart of it with the whites of four eggs, by stirring it with a whisk; after- wards, when thoroughly mixed, pour it back iuto the cask through the bunghole, and stir up the wliole cask, in a rotatory direction, with a clean split stick inserted through the bunghole. Having stirred it sufficiently, pour in the remainder of the wine drawn off, until the cask is full; then stir again, skimming off the bubbles that rise to the surface. When thoroughly mixed by stirring, close the bunghole, and leave it to stand for three or four days. This quantity of clarified wine will fine thirteen dozen of port or sherry. The other clearing ingredients are applied in the same manner, the material being cut into small pieces, and dissolved in the quart of wine, and the cask stirred in the same manner. 2167. To Bottle Wine.—Having thoroughly washed and dried the bottles, supposing they have been before used for the same kind of wine, provide corks, which will be improved by being slightly boiled, or at least steeped in hot water,—a wooden hammer.or mallet, a bottling-boot, and a squeezer for tlie corks. Bore a hole in the lower part of the cask with a gimlet, receiving the liquid stream which follows in the bottle and filterer, ■which is placed in a tub or basin. This operation is best performed by two persons, one to draw the wine, the other to cork the bottles. The drawer is to see that the bottles are up to the mark, but not too full, the bottle being placed in a clean tub to prevent waste. The corking-boot is buckled by a strap to the knee, the bottle placed in it, and the cork, after being squeezed in the press, driven in by a flat wooden mallet. 2168. As the wine draws near to the bottom of the cask, a thick piece of muslin is placed in the strainer, to prevent the viscous grounds from passing into the bottle. 2169. Having carefully counted the bottles, they are stored away in their respective binns, a h'yer of sand or sawdust being placed under the first tier, and another over it; a second tier is laid over this, protected by a lath, the head of the second being laid to the bottom of the first; over this another bed of sawdust is laid, not too thick, another lath ; and so on till the binn is filled. 2170. Wine so laid in will be ready for use according to its quality and age. Port •wine, old in the wood, will be ready to drink in five or six months ; but if it is a fruity •wine, it will improve every year. Sherry, if of good quality, will be fit to drink as soon as the " sickness " (as its first condition after bottling is called) ceases, and will also improve ; but the cellar must be kept at a perfectly steady temperature, neither too hot nor too cold, but about 55° or 60°, and absolutely free from draughts of cold air. DUTIES OF THE FOOTMAIT. M li^z. Where a single footman, or odd man, is the only male servant, then, whatever his ostensible position, he is required to make himself generally useful. He has to clean the knives and shoes, the furniture, the plate; answer the visitors who call, the drawing-room and parlour bells ; and do all the errands. His life is no sinecure ; and a methodical arrangement of his time Thrill be necessary, in order to perform his many duties with any satisfaction to himself or his master. 2172. The footman only finds himself in stockings, shoes, and washing. Where irilk Btockings, or ether extra articles of linen are worn, they are found by the family, af weUDUTIES OF THE FOOT-MAN. 9G5 as liis livery, a working dress, consisting of a pair of overalls, a waistcoat, a fustian jacket, with a wbite or jean ouc for times when lie is liable to be called to answer the door or wait at breakfast; and, oa quitting his service, he is expected to leave behind him any livery had within six mouths. 2173. The footman is expected to rise early, in order to get through all his dirty work before the family are stirring. Boots and shoes, and knives and forks, should be cleaned, lamps in use trimmed, his master's clothes brushed, the furniture rubbed over; so that he may put aside his working dress, tidy himself, and appear in a clean jean jacket to lay the cloth and prepare breakfast for the family. 217-i. We need hardly dwell on the boot-cleaning process: three good brushes and good blacking must be provided; one of the brushes hard, to brush oil'the mud; the other soft, to lay on the blacking ; the third of a medium hardness, for polishing ; and each should be kept for its particular use. The blacking should be kept corked up, except when in use, and applied to the brush with a sponge tied to a stick, which, when put away, rests in a notch cut in the cork. When boots come in very muddy, it is a good practice to wash off the mud, and wijpe them dry with a sponge ; then leave them to dry very gradually on their sides, taking care they are not placed near the lire, or scorched. Much delicacy of treatment is required in cleaning ladies' boots, so as to make the leather look well-polished, and the upper part retain a fresh appearance, with the hning free from hand-marks, which are very offensive to a lady of reliued tastes. 2175. Patent leather boots require to be wiped with a wet sponge, and afterwards with a soft dry cloth, and occasionally with a soft cloth and sweet oil, blacking and polishing the edge of the soles in the usual way, but so as not to cover the patent polish with ^blacking. A little milk may also be used with ver}' good effect for pater.tleather boots. 2176. Top boots are stiU occasionally worn by gentlemen. While cleaning the lower part in the usual manner, protect the tops, by inserting a cloth or brown paper under the edges and bringing it over them. In cleaning the tops, lot the covering fall down over the boot; wash the tops clean with soap and flannel, and rub out any spots with pumice-stone. If the tops are to be whiter, dissolve an ounce of oxalic acid and half an ounce of pumice-stone in a pint of soft water; if a bi'own colour is intended, mix an ounce of muriatic acid, half an ounce of alum, half an ounce of gum Arabic, and half an ounce of spirit of lavender, in a pint and a half of skimmed milk " turned." These mix- tures apply by means of & sponge, and polish, when dry, with a rubber made of soft flannel. 2177. Knives are now generally cleaned by means of Kent's or Mastcrs's machine, which gives very little trouble, and is very eflective ; before, however, putting the knives into the machine, it is highly necessary that they be first washed in a little warm (not hot) water, and then thoroughly wiped : if put into the machine with any grease on them, it adheres to the brushes, and consequently renders them unfit to use for the next knives that may be put in. When this precaution is not taken, the machine must come to pieces, so causing an immense amount of trouble, which may all be avoided by having the knives thoroughly free from grease before using the machine. Brushes are -also used for cleaning forks, which facilitate the operation. AVhen knives are so cleaned, see that they are carefully polished, wiped, and with a good edge, the ferules and prougs free from dirt, and place them in the basket with the handles all one way. 2178. Lamp-trimming requires a thorough acquaintance with the mechanism; after that, constant attention to cleanliness, and an occasional entire clearing out with hot water : when this is done, all the i:)arts should be carefully dried before filling again with oil. When lacquered, wipe the lacquered parts with a soft brush and cloth, and wash occasionally with weak soapsuds, wiping carefully afterwards. Ei'ass lamps may bo ■cleaned with oil and rottenstone every day when trimmed. With bronze,'^and other •ornamental lamps, more care will be required, and soft flannel and oil only used, to prevent the removal of the bronze or enamel. Brass-work, or any metal-work not; lacquered, is cleaned by a little oil and rottenstone made into a paste, or with fine emery-powder and oil mixed in the same manner. A small portion of sal ammoMiae, beat into a fine powder and moistened with soft water, rubbed over brass ornameuts, and heated over a charcoal fire, and rubbed dry with bran or whitening, will give to brass-work the brilliancy of gold. In trimming moderator lamps, let the wick be cut evenly all round ; as, if left higher in one place than it is in another, it will cause it to smoke and burn badly. The lamp should tiieu be liiled with oil from a feeder, andEOVSEEOLD MAXAGEME^'T. afterwards well wiped with a cloth or rag kept fon; the purpose. If it can be avoided, never wash the chimneys of a larap, as it causes them to crack when they become hot. Small sticks, covered with wash-leather pads, are the best things to use for cleauing the glasses inside, and a clean duster for polishing the outside. The globe of a moderator lamp should be occasionally washed in warm soap-and-water, then well rimed i:i cold water, and either wiped di*y or left to drain. Where candle-lamps are used, take out the springs occasionally, and free them well from the grease that adheres to them. 2179. French polish, so universally applied to furniture, is easily kept in condition by dusting and rubbing with a soft cloth, or a rubber of old silk; but dining-tables can only be kept in order by hard rubbing, or rather by quick rubbing, which warms the wood and removes all spots. 2180. Brushing clothes is a very simple but very necessary operation. Fine cloths require to be brushed lightly, and with rather a soft brush, except where mud is to be removed, when a hard one is necessary, being previously beaten lightly to dislodge the dirt. Lay the garment on a table, and brush it in the direction of the nap. Having brushed it properly, turn the sleeves back to the collar, so that the folds may come at the elbow-joints; next tuim the lappels or sides back over the folded sleeves; then lay the skirts over level with the collar, so that the crease may fall about the centre, and double one half over the other, so as the fold comes in the centre of the back. 2 i8i. Ilavinjr got through his dirty work, the single footman has now to clean himself and prepare the breakfast. He lays the cloth on the table ; over it the breakfast-cloth, and sets the breakfast things in order, and then proceeds to wait upon his master, if he has any of the duties of a valet to perform. -2182. Where a valet is not kept, a portion of his duties falls to the footman's share,—^brushing the clothes among others. \Vlicn the hat is silk, it requires brushing every day with a soft brush ; after rain, it requires wiping the way of the nap before drying, and, when nearly dry, brushing with the soft brush and with the hat-stick in it. If the footman is required to perform any part of a valet's duties, he v^ill have to see that the housemaid lights a fire in the dressing-room in due time ; that the room is dusted and cleaned ; that the washhand-ewer is filled with soft water; and that the bath, whether hot or cold, is ready when required ; that tow^els are at hand ; that hair- brushes and combs are properly cleansed, and in their places ; that hot vrater is ready at the hour ordered ; the dressing-gown and slippers in their place, the clean linen aired, and the clothes to be worn for the day in their proper places. After the master has dressed, it will be the footman's duty to restore everything to its place properly cleansed and dry, and the whole restored to order. 2183. At breakfast, when there is no butler, the footman carries up the tea- urn, and, assisted by the housemaid, he waits during breakfast. Breakfast over, he removes the tray and other things off the table, folds up the breakfast- cloth, and sets the room in order, by sv/eeping up all crumbs, shaking the cloth, and laying it on the table again, making up the fire, and sweeping up the hearth. 2184. At luncheon-time nearly the same routine is observed, except v/hero the footman is either out v/ith the carriage or av.^ay on other bushiess, when, in the absence of any butler, the housemaid must assist.DUTIES OF TIIi: FOOT'IAN. 2185. For dinner, the footrntyi lays the cloth, taking care that the table is not too near the fire, if there is one, and that passage-room is left. A table- cloth should be laid without a wrinkle ; and this requires two persons : over this the slips are laid, which are usually removed preparatory to placing dessert on the table. He prepares knives, forks, and glasses, with five or six plates for each person. This done, he places chairs enough for the party, distributing them equally on each side of the table, and opposite to each a napkin neatly folded, vrithin it a piece of bread or small roll, and a knife on the right side of each plate, a fork on the loft, and a carving-knife and fork at the top and bottom of the table, outside the others, with the rests opposite to them, and a gravy-spoon beside the knife. The fish-slice should be at the top, where the lady of the house, with the assistance of the gentle- man next to her, divides the fish, and the soup-ladle at the bottom : it is some- times usual to add a dessert-knife and fork ; at the same time, on the right side also of each plate, put a wine-glass for as many kinds of wine as it is in- tended to hand round, and a finger-glass or glass-cooler about four inches from the edge. The latter are frequently put on the table with the dessert. 2186. About half an hour before dinner, he rings the dinner-bell, where that is the practice, and occuj:>ies himself with carrying up everything he is likely to require. At the exjDiration of the time, having communicated with the cook, he rings the real dinner-bell, and proceeds to take it up with such assist- ance as he can obtain. Having ascertained that all is in order, that his own dress is clean and presentable, and his white cotton gloves are without a stain, he announces in the dravving-room that dinner is served, and stands respect- fully by the door until the company are seated : he places himself on the left, behind his master, w^ho is to distribute the soup; where soup and fish are served together, his place will be at his mistress's left hand ; but he must be on the alert to see that whoever is assisting him, whether male or female, are at their posts. If any of the guests has brought his own servant with him, his place is behind his master's chair, rendering such assistance to others as he can, while attending to his master's v/ants throughout the dinner, so that every guest has what he requires. This necessitates both activity and intelligence, and should be done without bustle, without asking any questions, except where it is the custom of the house to hand round dishes or wine, when it will be necessary to mention, in a quiet and unobtrusive manner, the dish or wine you present. 2187. Salfc-cellars should be placed on the table in number sufficient, for the guests, SO that each may help themselves, or, at least, their immediate neighbours. DiNITEBS A Li. IlussE. 31S8. In some houses the table is laid out with plate and glass, and ornamented with liowers, the dessert only being placed on the table, the dinner itself being placed on the sideboard, and handed round in succession, in courses of soup, lish, entrees, meat, game, and sweets. This is not only elegant but economical, as fewer dishes are required, the S3anmetry of the table being made up with the ornaments and dessert. The various dishes are olso handed round when hot; but it involves additional and superior attendance, as the wines are also hf.nded round; and unless the servants are very active and intelligent, many blunders are likely to be made. {See p. 954-.)HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT. GENERAL OBSERVATIONS. 5,189, While attentive to all, the footman should be obtrusive to none; he should give nothing but on a waiter, and always hand it with the left hand and on the left side of the person he serves, and hold it so that the guest may take it with case. In lifting dishes from the table, he should use both hands, and remove them with care, so that nothing is spilt on the table-cloth or on the dresses of the guests. 2190. Masters as well as servants sometimes make mistakes ; but it is not expected that a servant will correct any omissions, even if he should have time to notice them, although with the best intentions : thus it would not be correct, for instance, if he observed that his master took wine with the ladies all round, as some gentlemen still continue to do, but stopped at some one :—to nudge him on the shoulder and say, as was done by the servant of a Scottish gentle- man, "What ails you at her in the green gown ?" It will be better to leavo^ the lady unnoticed than for the servant thus to turn his master into ridicule. 2191. During dinner each person's knife, fork, plate, and spoon should bo changed as soon as he has done with it; the vegetables and sauces belonging to the different dishes presented vv'ithout remark to the guests ; and the foot- man should tread lightly in moving round, and, if possible, should bear in mind, if there is a wit or humorist of the party, whose good things keep the table in a roar, that they are not expected to reach his ears. 2192. In opening wine, lot it be done quietly, and without slialdng the bottle; if crusted, let it be inclined to the crusted side, and decanted while in that position. la opening champagne, it is not necessary to discbarge it with a pop; properly cooled, tho cork is easily extracted without an explosion ; when the cork is out, the mouth of the bottle should be wiped with the napkin over the footman's arm. 2193. At the end of the first course, notice is conveyed to the cook, who is waiting to send up the second, which is introduced in the same way as before ; the attendants who remove the fragments, carrying the dishes from the kitchen, and handing them to the footman or butler, whoso duty it is to arrange them on the table. After dinner, the dessert-glasses and wines are placed on tho table by the footman, who places himself behind his master's chair, to supply wine and hand round the ices and other refreshments, all other servants leaving the room. 1194. As soon as the drav/ing-room bell rings for tea, the footman enters with the tray, which has been previously prepared ; hands the tray round to-tho company, with cream and sugar, the tea and coffee being generally poured out, while another attendant hands cakes, toast, or biscuits. If it is an ordinary family party, where this social meal is prepared by the mistress, he carries tho urn or kettle, as the case may be ; hands round the toast, or such other eatablo as may be required, removing the whole in the same manner when tea is over.DUTIES or THE FOOT if AN. 969 21^5, After each meal, the footman's place is in his pantry: here perfect order should prevail—a place for everything and everything in its place. A sink, with hot and cold water laid on, is very desirable,—cold absolutely neceesary. AVooden bowls or tubs of BufHcient capacity are required, one for hot and another for cold water. Have the bowl three parts full of clean hot water; in this wash all plate and plated articles which are greasy, wiping them before cleaning with the brush. 2196. The footman in small families, where only one man is kept, has many of the duties of the upper servants to perform as well as his own, and more constant occu- pation ; he will also have the arrangement of his time more immediately under his own control, and he will do well to I'educe it. to a methodical division. All his rough work should be done before breakfast is ready, when he must appear clean, and in a presentable state. After breakfast, when everything belonging to his pantry is cleaned and put in its place, the furniture in the dining and drawing rooms requires rubbing. Towards noon, the parlour luncheon is to be prepared; and he must be at his mistress's disposal to go out with the carriage, or follow her if she walks out. 2197. Glass is a beautiful and most fragile article: hence it requires great care in washing. A perfectly clean wooden bowl is best for this operation, one for moderately hot and another for cold water. Wash the glasses well in the first and rinse them in the second, and turn them down on a linen cloth folded two or three times, to drain for a few minutes. When sufficiently drained, wipe them with a cloth and polish with a finer one, doing so tenderly and carefully. Accidents will happen; but nothing dis- credits a servant in the drawing-room more than continual reports of breakages, which, of course, must reach that region. 2198. Decanters and water-jugs require still more tender treatment in cleaning, inas- much as they are more costly to replace. Fill them about two-thirds with hot but not boiling water, and put in a few pieces of well-soaped brown paper ; leave them thus for two or three hours ; then shake the water u-p and down in the decanters; empty this out, rinse them well with clean cold water, and put tliem in a rack to drain. When dry, polish them outside and inside, as far as possible, with a fine cloth. To remove the crust of port or other wines, add a little muriatic acid to the water, and let it remain for some time. 2199. When required to go out with the carriage, it is the footman's duty to see that it has come to the door perfectly clean, and that the glasses, and sashes, and linings, are free from dust. In receiving messages at the carriage door, he should turn his ear to the speaker, so as to comprehend what is said, in order that he may give his directions to the coachman clearly. When the house he is to call at is reached, he should knock, and return to the carriage for orders. In closing the door upon the family, he should see that the handle is securely turned, and that no part of the ladies' dress is shut in. 2200. It is the footman's duty to carry messages or letters for his master or mistress to their friends, to the post, or to the tradespeople ; and nothing is more important than dispatch and exactness in doing so, although writing even the simplest message is now the ordinary and very proper prac- tice. Dean Swift, among his other quaint directions, all of which are to be read by contraries, recommends a perusal of all such epistles, in order that you may be the more able to fulfil j-our duty to your master. An old lady of Forfarshire had one of those odd old Caleb Balderston sort of servants, who construed the Dean of St. Patrick more literally. On one occasion, Avhen dispatch was of some importance, knowing his inquiring nature, she called her Scotch Paul Pry to her, opened the note, and read it to him herself. Baying, ''jSTow, Andrew, you ken a'aboot it, and ncedna'stop to open and read it, but just take it at once." Probably most of the notes you arc expected to carry might, with equal harmlessness, be communicated to you; but it will be better not to ta.ke so lively an interest in your mistress's afiairs.070 HOUSEHOLD 2201. Politeness and civility to visitors is one of the things mastei*s and mistresses have a right to expect^ and should exact rigorously. When visitors present themselves, the servant charged with the duty of opening the door will open it promptly, and answer, without hesitation, if the family are ^^not at home," or " engaged ;" which generally means the same thing, and might be oftener used with advantage to morals. On the contrary, if he has no such orders, he will answer affirmatively, open the door wide to admit them, and precede them to open the door of the drawing-room. If the family are not there, ho will place chairs for them, open the blinds (if the room is too dark), and intimate civilly that he goes to inform his mistress. If the lady is in her drawing-room, he announces the name of the visitors, having previously acquainted himself with it. In this part of his duty it is necessary to be very careful to repeat the names correctly ; mispronouncing names is very apt to give offence, and leads sometimes to other disagreeables. The writer was once initiated into some of the secrets on the ''other side " of a legal affair in which he took an interest, before he could correct a mistake made by the servant in announcing him. When the visitor is departing, the servant should be at hand, ready, when rung for, to open the door; he should open it with a respectful manner, and close it gently when the visitors are fairly beyond the threshold. When several visitors arrive together, he should take care not to mix up the different names together, where they belong to the same family, as Mr., Mrs., and Miss; if they are strangers, he should announce each as distinctly as possible. 2202. Receptions and Evening Parties.—The drawing-rooms being prepared, the card-tables laid out with cards and counters, and such other arrangements as are necessary made for the reception of the company, the rooms should be lighted up as the hour appointed approaches. Attendants in the drawing- room, even more than in the dining-room, should move about actively but noiselessly ; no creaking of shoes, which is an abomination ; watching the lights from time to time, so as to keep up their brilliancy. But even if the attendant likes a game of cribbago or whist himself, he must not inter- fere in his master or mistress's game, nor even seem to take an interest in it. We once knew a lady who had a footman, and both were fond of a game of cribbage,—John in the kitchen, the lady in her drawing-room. The lady was a giver of evening parties, v/here she frequently enjoyed her favourite amuse- ment. AVhile handing about the tea and toast, John could not always sup- press his disgust at her mistakes. '' There is more in that hand, ma'am," he has been known to say ; or, ''Ma'am, you forgot to count his nob ; " in fact, he identified himself with his mistress's game, and would have lost twenty places rather than witness a m.iscount. It is not necessary to adopt his example on this point, although John had many qualities a good servant might copy with advantage.THE COACHHOUSS AND STAELZS. 2203. The Hoese is the noblest of quadrupeds, whether we view him in his f=!tren;iih, hia sagacity, or his beauty. He is also the most useful to man of all the auimal creatiou ; but his delicacy is equal to his power and usefulness. No other animal, probably, is so de- pendent on man in the state of domestication to which he has been reduced, or detei io- rates so rapidly under exposure, bad feeding, or bad grooming. It is, therefore, a point of humanity, not to speak of its obvious impolicy, for the owner of horses to overlook any neglect in their feeding or gx'ooming. His interest dictates that so valuable an animal should be well housed, well led, and well groomed; and he will do well to acquire so much of stable lore as will enable him to judge of these points himself. In a general wa}^ where a horse's coat is habitually rough and untidy, there is a sad want of elbow-grease in the stable. "When a horse of tolerable breeding is dull and spiritless, he is getting ill or badly fed; and where he is observed to perspire much in the stables, is overfed, and probably eats his litter in addition to his regular supply of food. 2201. Stables.—The architectural foi*m of the stables will be subject to other influences thauours; we confine ourselves, therefore, to their internal arrangements. They should be roomy in proportion to the number of stalls; warm, Avith good ventilation, and perfectly free from cold draughts; the stalls roomy, without excess, with good and well-trappecl drainage, so as to exclude bad smells ; a sound ceiling to prevent the entrance of dust frum the hayloft, which is usually above them ; and there should be pleutj^ of light, coming, however, either from above or behind, so as not to glare in the horse's eye. 2205. Heat.—The first of these objects is attained, if the stables are kept within a degree or two of 50° in v/inter, and 60° in summer; although some "^'rooms insist on a much higher temperature, in the interests of their own labour. 2206. Ventilation is usually attained by the insertion of one or more tubes or boxes of, wood or iron through the ceiling and the roof, with a sloping covering over the opening, to keep out rain, and valves or ventilators below to regulate (he atmosphere, with openings in the walls for the admission of fresh air : this is stiii a difliculty, however; for the etUu- vium of the stable is difficult to dispel, and draughts must be avoided. This is sometimes accomplished by means of hollow walls with gratings at the bottom outside, for the exit of bad air, which is carried down through the hollow wails and discharged at the bottom, while, for the admission of fresh air, the reverse takes place : the fresh by this means gets diffused and heated before it is discharged into the stable. 2207. Tlie Stalls should be divided by partitions of wood-work eight or nine feet high at the head and six at the heels, and nine feet deep, so as to separate each horse from its neighbour. A hay-rack placed within easy reach of the horse, of wood or iron, occu- pies either a corner or the whole breadth of the stall, which should be about six feet for an ordinary-sized horse. A manger, formerly of wood, but of late years niore generally of iron lined with enamel, occupies a corner of the stall. The pavement of the stall should be nearly level, with a slight incline towards the gutter, to keep the bed dry, paved with hard Dutch brick laid on edge, or asphalte, or smithy clinkers, or rubble- stones, laid in strong cement. In the centre, about five feet from the wall, a grating should be firmly fixed in the pavement, and in communication with a well-trapped drain to carry off the water ; the gutter outside the stall should also communicate with the drains by trapped openings. The passage between the stall and the hall should be from five to six feet broad at least; on the wall, opposite to each stall, pegs should be placed for receiving the harness and other things in daily use. 2208. A Harness-room is indispensable to every stable. It should be dry and airy, and furnished with a fireplace and boiler, both for the protection of the harness and to prepare mashes for the horses when required. The partition-wall sliould be boarded where the harness goes, with pegs to hang the various pieces of harness on, with saddle- trees to rest the saddles on, a cupboard for the brushes, sponges, and leathers, and a lock- up c:>ru-bin. 2209. The furniture of a stable with coachhouse, consists of coach-mops, jacks for raising the wheels, horse-brushes, spoke-brushes, water-bx-ushes, crest and bit-brushes, dandy-brushes, currycombs, birch and heath brooms, trimming-combs, scissors and pickers, oil-cans and brushes, harness-brushes of three sorts, leathers, sponges for horse and carriage, stable-forks, dung-baskets or wheelbarrow, corn-sieves and measures, horse-cloths and stable pails, horn or glass lanterns. Over the stables there should be accommodation for the coachman or groom to sleep. Accidents sometimes occur, a:id he should be at hand to interfere.972 HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT. DUTIES OP THE COACHMAT^", GBOOM, AISTD STABLE-BOY. 2210. The Estallishment we have in view will consist of coachman, groom, and stable-boy, who are capable of keeping in perfect order four horses, and perhaps the pony. Of this establishment the coachman is chief. Besides skill in driving', he should possess a good general knowledge of horses ; he has usually to purchase provender, to see that the horses are regularly fed and properly groomed, watch over their condition, apply simple remedies to trifling ailments in the animals under his charge, and report where he observes symptoms of more serious ones which he does not understand. He has either to clean the carriage himself, or see that the stable-boy does it properly. -2211. The Groom's first duties are to keep his horses in condition; but he is sometimes expected to perform the duties of a valet, to ride out with his master, on occasions, to wait at table, and otherwise assist in the house: in these cases, he should have the means of dressing himself, and keeping his - clothes entirely away from the stables. In the morning, about six o'clock, or rather before, the stables should be opened and cleaned out, and the horses fed, first by cleaning the rack and throwing in fresh hay, putting it lightly in .the rack, that the horses may get it out easily ; a short time afterwards their usual morning feed of oats should be put into the manger. While this is going on, the stable-boj' has been removing the stable-dung, and sweeping and wash- ing out the stables, both of which should be done every day, and every corner carefully swept, in order to keep the stable sweet and clean. The real duties of the groom follow : where the horses arc not taken out for early exercise, tho work of grooming immediately commences. Having tied up the head," to use the excellent description of the process given by old Barrett, ^'take a currycomb and curry him all over the body, to raise the dust, beginning first at the neck, holding the left cheek of the headstall in the left hand, and curry him from the setting-on of his head all over the body to the buttocks, down to the point of the hock; then change your hands, and curry him before, on his breast, and, laying your right arm over his back, join your right side to his left, and curry him all under the belly near the fore-bowels, and so all over from the knees and back upwards ; after that, go to the far side and do that likewise. Then take a dead horse's tail, or, failing that, a cotton dusting- cloth, and strike that away which the currycomb hath raised. Then take a round brush made of bristles, with a leathern handle, and dress him all over, both head, body, and legs, to the very fetlocks, always cleansing the brush from the dust by rubbing it with the currycomb. In the curry-combing process, as well as brushing, it must be apj)lied with mildness, especially with fine-skinned horses ; otherwise the tickling irritates them much. The brushing is succeeded by a hair-cloth, with which rub him all over again very hard, both to take away loose hairs and lay his coat; then wash your hands in fair water, and rub him all over while they are wet, as well over the head as the body. Lastly, take a clean cloth, and rub him all over again till he be dry;DUTIES OF THE COACHMAN, ETC. 973 thoji take another hair-clotli, and rub all his legs exceeding well from the knees and hocks downwards to his hoofs, picking and dressing them very carefully about the fetlocks, so as to remove all gravel and dust which will sometimes lie in the bending of the joints." In addition to the practice of this old writer, modern grooms add wisping, which usually follows brushing. The best wisp is made from a hayband, untwisted, and again doubled up after being mois- tened with water: this is applied to every part of the body, as the brushing had been, by changing the hands, taking care in all these operations to carry the hand in the direction of the coat. Stains on the hair are removed, by sponging, or, when the coat is very dirty, by the water-brush; the whole being finished off by a linen or flannel cloth. The horsecloth should now be put on by taking the cloth in both hands, with the outside next you, and, with your right hand to the off side, throw it over his back, placing it no farther back than will leave it straight and level, which will be about a foot from the tail. Put the roller round, and the pad-piece under it, about six or eight inches from the fore legs. The horse's head is now loosened ; he is turned about in his stall to have his head and ears rubbed and brushed over every part, including throat, with the dusting-cloth, finishing by pulling his ears," which all horses seem to enjoy very much. This done, the mane and foretop should be combed out, passing a wet sponge over them, sponging the mane on both sides, by throwing it back to the midriff, to make it lie smooth. The horse is now returned to his headstall, his tail combed out, cleaning it of stains with a v/et brush or sponge, trimming both tail and mane, and forelock when'necessary, smoothing them down with a brush on which a little oil has been dropped. 2213. "Watering usually follows dressing; but some horses refuse their food imtil they have drunk : the groom should not, therefore, hiy down exclusive rules on this subject, but study the temper and habits of his horse. 2213. jExercise.—All horses not in work require at least two hours* exercise daily; and in exercising them a good groom will put them through the paces to which they have been trained. In the case of saddle-horses he will walk, trot, canter, and gallop them, in order to keep them up to their work. With draught horses they ought to be kept up to a smart walk and trot. 2214. Feeding must depend on their work, but they require feeding three thnes a day, with more or less corn each time, according to their work. In the fast coaching days it was a saying among proprietors, that " his belly was the measure of his food ;" but the horse's appetite is not to be taken as a criterion of the quantity of food under any circum- stances. Horses have been known to consume 40 lbs. of hay in twenty-four hours, whereas 16lbs. to 18 lbs. is the utmost which should have been given. Mr. Croall, an extensive coach proprietor in Scotland, limited his horses to 4-o-lbs. cut straw, 8 lbs. bruised oats, and 24lbs. bruised beans, in the morning and noon, giving them at night 23 lbs. of the following; viz., 560lbs. steamed potatoes,36lbs. barley-dust, 4/)lbs. cut straw, and 6lbs. salt, mixed up together : under this the horses did their work well. The ordinary measure given to a horse is a peck of oats, about 40 lbs. to the bushel, twice a day, a third feed and a rack-ful of hay, which may be about 15 lbs. or 18 lbs., when he is in full work. 2215. You cannot take up a paper without having the question put, *' Do you bruise your oats Well, that depends on circumstances: a fresh young horse can bruise its own oats when it can get them; but aged horses, after a time, lose the power of masti- cating and bruising them, and bolt them whole ; thus much impeding the work of diges- tion. For an old horse, then, bruise the oats ; for a young one it does no harm and little good. Oats should be bright and dry, and not too new. Where they are new, sprinkle them with salt and water ; otherwise, they overload the horse's stomach. Chopped straw mixed with oats, in the proportion of a third of straw or hay, is a good food for horses in full work; and carrots, of which horses are remarkably fond, have a perceptible effect in a short time on the gloss of the coat.HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT. 971 2216. The Trater given to ahorse merits some attention ; it sbonld not be too cold; hard water is not to he recommended ; stagnant or muddy water is positively injurious; river water is the best for all purposes ; and anything is preferable to spring water, which should be exposed to the sun in summer for an hour or two, and stirred up before using it: a handful of oatmeal thrown into the pail will much improve its quality. 2217. Shoeing.—A horse should not be sent on a journey or any other hard work imme- diately after new shoeir.gr;—the stiffness incidental to new shoes is not unlikely to bring him down. A day's rest, with reasonable exercise, will not be thrown away after this operation. On reaching home very hot, the groom should walk him about for a few minutes ; this done, he should take off the moisture with the scraper, and afterwards wisp him over with a handful of straw and a flannel cloth : if the cloth is dipped in some spirit, all the better. He should wash, pick, and wipe dry the legs and feet, take off the bridle and crupper, and fasten it to the rack, then the girths, and put a wisp of strawunder the saddle. When sufficiently cool, the horse should have some hay given him, and then a feed of oats: if he refuse the latter, offer him a little wet bran, or a handful of oatmeal in tepid water. When he has been fed, he should be thoroughly cleaned, and his body- clothes put on, and, if veiy much harassed with fatigue, a little good ale or wine will be well bestowed on a valuable horse, adding plenty of iresh litter under the belly. 2218. Bridles.—Every time ahorae is unbridled, the bit should be carefully washed and dried, and the leather wiped, to keep them sweet, as well as the girths and saddle, the latter being carefully dried and beaten with a switch before it is again put on. In wash- ing a horse's feet after a day's work, the master should insist upon the legs and feet being washed thoroughly with a sponge until the water flows over them, and then rubbed with a brush till quite dry. 2219. Harness, if not carefully preserved, very soon gets a shabby tarnished appearance. Where the coachman has a proper hai'ness-room and sufficient assistance, this is in- excusable and easily prevented. The harness-room should have a wooden lining all round, and be perfectly dry and well ventilated. Around the walls, hooks and pegs should be placed, for the several pieces of harness, at such a height as topi'event their touching the ground ; and every part of the harness should have its pe^ or hook,—one for the halters, another for the reins, and others for snafiles and other bits and metal-work; and either a wooden horse or saddle-trees for the saddles and pads. All these parts should be dry, clean, and shining. This is only to be done by careful cleaning and polishing, and the use of several requisite pastes. The metallic parts, when white, should be cleaned by a soft brush and plate-powder ; the copper and brass parts burnished with rottenstone- powder and oil,—steel with emery-powder; both made into a paste with a little oil. 2220. An excellent paste for polishing harness and the leather-work of carriages, is made by melting 8 lbs. of yellow wax, stirring it till completely' dissolved. Into this pour 1 lb. of litharge of the shops, which has been pounded up with water, and dried and sifted through a sieve, leaving the two, when mixed, to simmer on the fire, stirring them con- tinually till all ismelted. When it is a little cool, mix this with l^lb. of good ivory-black j place this again on the lire, and stir till it boils anew, and suffer it to cool. When cooled a little, add distilled turpentine till it has the consistence of a thiekish paste, scenting it vrith any essence at hand, thinning it when necessary from time to time, by adding dis- tilled turpentine. 2221. When the leather is old and greasy, it should be cleaned before applying thia polish, with a brush wetted in a weak solution of potass and water, washing afterwards with soft river water, and drying thoroughly. If the leather is not black, one or two coats of black ink may be given before applying the polish. When quite dry, the varnish should be laid on with a soft shoe-brush, using also a soft brush to polish the leather. 2222. When the leather is very old, it may be softened with fish-oil, and, after putting on the ink, a sponge charged wjith distilled turpentine passed over, to scour the surfaM of the leather, which should be polished as above. 2223. For foii-n or yelJow-coloiired leailier,W&e a quart of skimmed milk, pour into it 1 oz. of sulphuric acid, and, when cold, add to it 4oz. of hydrochloric acid, shaking the bottle gently until it ceases to emit white vapours; separate the coagulated from the liquid part, by straining through a sieve, and store it away tiU required. In applying it, clean the leather by a weak solution of oxalic acid, washing it off immediately, and apply the composition when dry with a sponge. 222i. Wheel-grease is usually purchased at the shops; but a good paste is made as follows :—jMelt 80 parts of grease, and stir into it, mixing it thoroughly and smoothly, 20 parts of line black-lead in powder, and store away in a tin box for use. Th'S grease is used in the mint at Paris, and is highly approved.975 DUTIES OP THE COACHMAN, ETC, 2225. Carriages in an endless variety of sliapes and names are continually making their Ttppeurance; but the hacliney cab or clarence seems most in request for light carriages; the family carriage of the day being a modified form of the clarence adapted for family use. The carriage is a valuable piece of furniture, requiring all the care of the most delicate upholstery, with the additional disadvantage of continual exposure to the weather and to the muddy streets. 2226. It requires, therefore, to be carefully cleaned before putting away, and a coach-house perfectly dr}^ and well ventilated, for the wood-work swells with moisture ; it shrinks also with heat, unless the timber has undergone a long course of seasoning : it should also have a. dry floor, a boarded one being recommended. It must be removed from the ammoniacal influence of the stables, from open drains and cesspools, and other gaseous influences likely to afi'ect the paint and varnish. When the carriage returns home, it should bo carefully washed and dried, and that, if possible, before the mud has time to dry on it. This is done by first well slushing it with clean water, so as to v^-asli away all particles of sand, having first closed the sashes to avoid wetting the linings. The body is then gone carefully over with a soft mop, using plenty of clean water, and penetrating into every corner of the carved work, so that not an atom of dirt remains ; the body of the carriage is then raised by placing the jack under the axletree and raising it so that the wheel turns freely ; this is now thoroughly washed with the mop until the dirt is removed, using a water-brush for corners where the mop does not penetrate. Every particle of mud and sand removed by the mop, and afterwards with a wet sponge, the carriage is wiped dry, and, as soon after as possible, the varnish is carefully polished with soft leather, using a little sweet oil for the leather parts, and even for the panels, so as to check any tendency of the varnish to crack. Stauis are removed by rubbing them with the leather and sweet oil; if that fails, a little Tripoli powder mixed with the oil will be more successful. 2227. In preparing the carriage for use, the whole body should be rubbed over with a clean leather and carefully polished, the iron-work and joints oiled, the plated and brass-work occasionally cleaned,—the one with plate-powder, or with well-washed whiting mixed with sweet oil, and leather kept for the pur- pose,—the other with rottenstone mixed with a little oil, and applied without too much rubbing, until the paste is removed ; but, if rubbed every day with the leather, little more will be required to keep it untarnished. The linings require careful brushing every day, the cushions being taken out and beaten, and the glass sashes should always be bright and clean. The wheel-tires and axletree are carefully seen to, and greased when required, the bolts and nuts tightened, and all the parts likely to get out of order overhauled. 2228. These duties, however, are only incidental to the coachman's office, which is to drive; and much of the enjoyment of those in the carriage depends on his proficiency in his art,—much also of the wear of the carriage and horses. He should have sufficient knowledge of the construction of the carriage to know when it is out of order,—to know, also, the pace at which he can go over the road he has under him, without risking the springs, and without shaking those he is driving too much.HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT. 076 2229. Having, with or without the help of the groom or stable-boy, put his horses to the carriage, and satisfied himself, by walking round them, that everything is properly arranged, the coachman proceeds to the off-side of the carriage, takes the reins from the back of the horses, where they were thrown, buckles them together, and, placing his foot on the step, ascends to his box, having his horses now entirely under control. In ordinary circumstances, he is not expected to descend, for where no footman accompanies the carriage, the doors are usually so arranged that even a lady may let herself out, if she wishes it, from the inside. The coachman's duties are to avoid everything approaching an accident, and all his attention is required to guide his horses. 2230. The pace at which he drives will depend upon his orders,—in all probability a moderate pace of seven or eight miles an hour; less speed is injurious to the horses, getting them into lazy and sluggish habits; for it h wonderful how soon these are acquired by some horses. The writer was once employea to piircbai^e a horse for a country friend, and he picked a very handsome gelding out of Collins's stables, which seemed to answer to his friend's wants. It was duly committed to the coachman who was to drive it, after some very successful trials in harness and out of it, and seemed likely to give great satisfaction. After a time, the friend got tired of his carriage, and gave it up j as the easiest mode of getting rid of the horse, it was sent up to the writer's stables,—a present. Only twelve months had elapsed; the horse was as handsome aa ever, with plenty of flesh, and a sleek glossy coat, and he was thankfully enough received ; but, on trial, it was found that a stupid coachman, who was imbued with one of their old maxims, that "it's the pace that kills," had driven the horse, capable of doing his nine miles an hour with ease, at a jog-trot of four miles, or four and a half; and now, no gersuasion of the whip could get more out of him. After many unsuccessful efforts to ring him back to his pace, in one of which a break-down occurred, under the hands of a professional trainer, he was sent to the hammer, and sold for a sum that did not pay for the attempt to break him in. This maxim, therefore, *' that it's the pace that kills," is altogether fallacious in the moderate sense in which we are viewing it. In the old coaching days, indeed, when the Shrewsbury Wonder" drove into the inn yard while the clock was striking, week after week and month after month, with unerring regularity, twenty- seven hours to a hundred and sixty-two miles ; when the " Quicksilver " mail was timed to eleven miles an hour between London and Plymouth, with a fine of £0 to the driver if behind time; when the Brighton "Age," "tool'd" and horsed by the late Mr. Stevenson, nsed to dash round the square as the fifth hour was striking, having stopped at the half-v/ay house while his servant handed a sandwich and a glass of sherry to his passengers,—then the pace was indeed "killing." But the truth is, horses that are driven at a jog-trot pace lose that elan with which a good driver can inspire them, and they are left to do their work by mere weight and muscle; therefore, unless he has contrary orders, a good driver will choose a smart pace, but not enough to make his horses perspire : on level roads this should never be seen. 2231. In choosing his horses, every master will see that they are properly paired,—that their paces are about equal. When their habits differ, it is the coachman's duty to discover how he can, with least annoyance to the horses, get that pace out of them. Some horses have been accustomed to be driven on the check, and the curb irritates them; others, with harder mouths, cannot be controlled with the slight leverage this affords; he must, therefore, accommodate the horses as he best can. The reins should always be held so that the horses are " in hand ;" but he is a very bad driver who always drives with a tight rein; the pain to the horse is intolerable, and causes him to rear and plunge, and finally break away, if he can. He is also a bad driver when the reins are always slack; the horse then feels abandoned to himself; he is neither directednoF supported, and if no accident occurs, it is great good luck. 2232. The true coachman's hands are so delicate and gentle, that the mere weight of the reins is felt on the bit, and the directions are indicated by a turn of the wrist rather than by a pull ; the horses are guided and encouraged, and only pulled up when they exceed their intended pace, or in the event of a stumble; for there is a strong though gentle hand on the reins.977 DUTIES OF THE VALET. '2233. Tlie Whip, in the hands of a good driver, and with well-bred cattle, is there, more as a precaution than a ''tool" for frequent use ; if ho uses it, it is to encourage, by stroking the flanks ; excej^t, indeed, he has to punish somo waywardness of temper, and then he does it effectually, taking care, however, that it is done on the flank, where there is no very tender part, never on the crup25cr. In driving, the coachman should never give way to temper. How often do we see horses stumble from being conducted, or at least ''allowed," to go over bad ground by some careless driver, who immediately wreaks that vengeance on the poor horse which might, with much more justice, be applied to his own brutal shoulders. The whip is of course useful, and even necessary, but should be rarely used, except to encourage and excite the horses. DUTIES OF THE VALET. 2234. Attendants on the Person.—'•' No man is a hero to his valet," saiththe proverb; and the corollary may run, "No lady is a heroine to her maid." The infirmities of humanity are, perhaps, too numerous and too equally distributed to stand the severe microscopic tests which attendants on the person have opportunities of applying. The valet and waiting-maid are placed near the persons of the master and mistress, receiving orders only from them, dressing them, accompanying them in all their journeys, the confidants and agents of their most unguarded moments, of their most secret habits, and of course subject to their commands,—even to their caprices; they themselves being- subject to erring judgment, aggravated by an imperfect education. All that can be expected from such servants is polite manners, modest demeanour, and a respectful reserve, which are indispensable. To these, good sense, good temper, some self-denial, and consideration for the feelings of others, v/liether above or below them in the social scale, will be useful qualifications. Their duty leads them to wait on those who are, from sheer wealth, station, and education, more polished, and consequently more susceptible of annoy- ance ; and any vulgar familiarity of manner is opposed to all their notions of self-respect. Quiet unobtrusive manners, therefore, and a delicate reserve in speaking of their employers, either in praise or blame, is as essential in their absence, as good manners and respectful conduct in their presence. ' -2235. Some of the duties of the valet we have just hinted at in treating of the duties of the footman in a small family. His day commences by seeing that his master's dressing-room is in order ; that the housemaid has swept and dusted it properly; that the fire is lighted and burns cheerfully; and some time before his master is expected, he will do well to throw up the sash to admit fresh air, closing it, however, in time to recover the temperature which he knows his master prefers. It is now his duty to place the body-linen on the horse before the fire, to be aired properly ; to lay the trousers intended to be worn, carefully brushed and cleaned, on the back of his master's chair ; while 3 RHOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT. 978 the coat and waistcoat^ carefully brushed and folded, and the collar cleanedj are laid in their place ready to put on when required. All the articles of the toilet should be in their places, the razors properly set and stropped, and hot water ready for use. 2236. Gentlemen generally prefer performing the operation of shaving them- selves, but a valet should be prepared to do it if required; and he should, besides, be a good hairdresser. Shaving over, he has to brush the hair, beard, and moustache, where that appendage is encouraged, arranging the whole simply and gracefully, according to the age and style of countenance. Every fortnight, or three v/eeks at the utmost, the hair should be cut, and the points of the whiskers trimmed as often as required. A good valet will now present the various articles of the toilet as they are wanted ; afterwards, the body-linen, neck-tie, which he will put on, if required, and, afterwards, waist- coat, coat, and boots, in suitable order, and carefully brushed and polished. 2237. Having thus seen his master dressed, if he is about to go out, the valet will hand him his cane, gloves, and hat, the latter well brushed on the outside with a soft brush, and wiped inside with a clean handkerchief, respect- fully attend him to the door, and open it for him, and receive his last orders for the day. 2238. He now proceeds to put everything in order in the dressing-room, cleans the combs and brushes, and brushes and folds up any clothes that may be left about the room, and puts them away in the drawers. 2239. Gentlemen are sometimes indifferent as to their clothes and appear- ance ; it is the valet's duty, in this case, where his master permits it, to select from the wardrobe such things as are suitable for the occasion, eo that he may appear with scrupulous neatness and cleanliness; that his linen and neck-tie, where that is white or coloured, are unsoiled; and where he is not accustomed to change them every day, that the cravat is turned, and even ironed, to remove the crease of the previous fold. The coat collar,—which where the hair is oily and worn long, is apt to get greasy^—should also be ex£imined ; a careful valet will correct this by removing the spots day by day as they appear, first by moistening the grease-spots with a little rectified spirits of wine or spirits of hartshorn, which has a renovating effect, and the smell of which soon disappears. The grease is dissolved and removed by gentle scraping. The grease removed, add a little more of the spirit, and rub with a piece of clean cloth; finish by adding a few drops more ; rub it with the pftlm of the hand, in the direction of the. grain of the cloth, and it will be clean and glossy as the rest of the garment. 2240. Polish for the boots is an important matter to the valet, and not always to be obtained good by purchase; never so good, perhaps, as he can make for himself after the following recipes :—Take of ivory-black and treacle each 4 oz., sulphuric acid 1 oz., best olive-oil 2 spoonfuls, best white-wine vinegar 3 half-pints : mix the ivory-black and treacle well in an earthen jar ; then add the sulphuric acid, continuing to stir the mixture ; next pour in the oil; and, lastly, add the vinegar, stirring it in by degrees, until thoroughly incorporated.079 DUTIES OF THE LADY'S-MAID. 2211. Another polish 19 made l)y mixing 1 oz. each of pounded piiUs and logwood-chips, and 3 lbs. of red French wine (ordinaire). Boil tof^ctber till the liquid is reduced to half the quantity, and pour it oil* through a strainer. Kow take ^Ib. each of pounded gum-arabic and lump-sugar, 1 oz. of green copperas, and 3 lbs. of brandy. Dissolve the gum-arabic in the preceding decoction, and add the sugar and copperas : \Yhen all is dis- solved and mixed together, stir in the brandy, mixing it smoothly. This mixture will yield 5 or 6 lbs. of a very superior polishing paste for boots and shoes, -2242. It is, perhaps,, unnecessary to add, tliat Laving discharged all the commissions intrusted to him by his master, sucli as conveying notes or messages to friends, or the tradesmen, all of which he should punctually and promptly attend to, it is his duty to be in waiting when his master returns home to dress for dinner, or for any other occasion, and to have all things prepared for this second dressing. Previous to this, lie brings under his notice the cards of visitors who may have called, delivers the messages ho may have received for him, and othervnse acquits himself of the morning's commissions, and receives his orders for the remainder of the day. The routine of his evening duty is to have the dressing-room and study, where there is a separate one, arranged comfortably for his master, the fires lighted, candles prepared, dressing-gown and slippers in their place, and aired, and everything in order that is required for his master's comforts. FEMALE DOMESTICS. DUTIES OP THE LADY'S-MAID. 2243. The duties of a lady's-maid are more numerous, and perhaps more onerous, than those of the valet; for while the latter is aided by the tailor, tho hatter, the linen-draper, and the perfumer, the lady's-maid has to originate many parts of the mistress's dress herself: she should, indeed, be a tolerably expert milliner and dressmaker, a good hairdresser, and possess some chemical knowledge of the cosmetics with which the toilet-table is supplied, in order to use them -with safety and effect. Her first duty in the morning, after having performed her own toilet, is to examine the clothes put off by her mistress the evening before, either to put them awa}'-, or to see that they are all in order to put on again. During the winter, and in wet weather, the dresses should be carefully examined., and the mud removed. Dresses of tweed, and other woollen materials, may bo laid out on a table and brushed all over; but in general, even in woollen fabrics, the lightness of the tissues renders brushing unsuitable to dresses, and it is better to remove the dust from the folds by beating them lightly with, a handkerchief or thin cloth. Silk dresses should never be brushed, but rubbed wuth a piece of merino, or other soft material, of a similar colour, kept for the pmpose. Summer dresses of barege, muslin, mohair, and other light materials, simply require shaking ; but if the muslin be tumbled, it must bo ironed afterwards. If the dresses require slight repair, it should be done at once : a stitch in time saves nine." 3 R 29S0 HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT. 2244. The bonnet slioiild be dusted with a light featber plume, in order to remove every particle of dust; but this has probably been done, as it ought to have been, the night before. Velvet bonnets, and other velvet articles of dress, should be cleaned with a soft brush. If the flowers with which the bonnet is decorated have been crushed or displaced, or the leaves tumbled, they should be raised and readjusted by means of flower-pliers. If feathers have sufl'ered from damp, they should be held near the fire for a few minutes, and restored to their natural state by the hand or a soft brush. 2215. The Chatisserie, or foot-gear of a lady, is one of the few things left to mark her station, and requires special care. Satin boots or shoes should be dusted witli a soft brush, or wiped with a cloth. Kid or varnished leather should have the mud wiped ofi" with a sponge charged with milk, which preserves its softness and polish. The follow- ing is also an excellent polish for applying to ladies' boots, instead of blacking them :— Mix equal proportions of sweet-oil, vinegar, and treacle, with 1 oz, of lamp-black. When all the ingredients are thoroughly incorporated, rub the mixture on the boots with the palm of th.e hand, and put them in a cool place to dry. Ladies' blacking, which may be purchased in Gd. and Is. bottles, is also veiy much used for patent leather and kid boots, particularly when they are a little worn. This blacking is merely applied with a piece of sponge, and the boots should not be put on until the blacking is dry and hardened. 2246. These various preliminary offices performed, the lady's-maid should prepare for dressing her mistress, arranging her dressing-room, toilet-table, and linen, according to her mistress's wishes and habits. The details of dressing we need not touch upon,—every lady has her own mode of doing so ; but the maid should move about quietly, perform any offices ahout her mis- tress's person, as lacing stays, gently, and adjust her linen smoothly. 2247. Having prepared the dressing-room by lighting the fire, sweeping the hearth, and made everything ready for dressing ber mistress, placed her linen before the fire to air, and laid out the various articles of dress she is to wear, which will probably have been arranged the previous evening, tho lady's-maid is prepared for the morning's duties. 2248. Hairdresshig is the most important part of the lady's-maid's office. If ringlets are worn, remove the curl-papers, and, after thoroughly brushing the back hair both above and below, dress it according to the prevailing fashion. If bandeaux are worn, the hair is thoroughly brushed and frizzed outside and inside, folding the hair back round the head, brushing it perfectly smooth, giving it a glossy api^earance by tho use of pomades, or oil, applied by the palm of the hand, smoothing it down with a small brush dipped in bandoline. Double bandeaux are formed by bringing most of the hair forward, and rolling it over frizettes made of hair the same colour as that of the wearer : it is finished behind by plaiting the hair, and arranging it in such a manner as to look well with the head-dress. 2249. Lessons in hairdressing may be obtained, and at not an unreasonable charge. If a lady's-maid can afford it, we would advise her to initiate herself in the mysteries of hairdressing before entering on her duties. If a mistress finds her maid hand}^ and willing to learn, she will not mind the expense of a few lessons, which are almost necessary, as the fashion and mode of dressing the hair is so continually changing. Brushes and combs sliould be kept scrupulously clean, by washing them about twice a week : to do this oftener spoils tho brushes, as very frequent washing makes them so very soft.981 DUTIES OF THE LADY'S-MAID. To washL Brushes. -2250. Dissolve a piece of soda in some hot water, allv wing a piece the size of a wahmt to a quart of water. Put the water into a basin, and, after comb- iPig out the hair from the brushes, dip them, bristles downwards, into the water and out again, keeping the backs and handles as free from the water as possible. Repeat this until the bristles look clean ; then rinse the brushes in a little cold water ; shake them well, and wipe the handles and backs with a towel, hut not the Iristles, and set the brushes to dry in the sun, or near the fire ; but take care not to put them too close to it. Wiping the bristles of a brush makes them soft, as does also the use of soa^). To clean Combs. 2251. If it can be avoided, never wash combs, as the water often makes the teeth split, and the tortoiseshcll or horn of which they are made, rough. Small brushes, manufactured purposely for cleaning combs, may bo purchased at a trifling cost: with this the comb should be well brushed, and afterwards wiped with a cloth or towel. A good Wash, for the Hair. 2252. Ingredie^'TS.—1 pennyworth of borax, ^ pint of olive-oil, 1 pint of boiling water. 31 ode.—Pour the boiling Vv'ater over the borax and oil; let it cool; then put the mixture into a bottle. Shake it before using, and apply it with a flanne]. Camphor and borax, dissolved in boiling water and left to cool, make a very good wash for the hair ; as also does rosemary-water mixed with a little borax. After using any of these washes, when the hair becomes thoroughly dry, a little pomatum or oil should be rubbed in, to make it smooth and glossy. To make Pomade for the Hair. 2253. Ingredients.—^ lb. of lard, 2 pennyworth of castor-oil; scent. Mode.—Let the lard be unsalted; beat it up well; then add the castor-oil, and mix thoroughly together with a knife, adding a few drops of any scent that may be preferred. Put the pomatum into pots, which keep) well covered to prevent' it turning rancid. Another Recipe for Pomatum. 2254. Ingredients.—8 oz. of olive-oil, 1 oz. of spermaceti, 3 pennyworth of essential oil of almonds, 3 pennyworth of essence of lemon. Mode.—Mix these ingredients together, and store away in jars for use. To make Bandoline. 2255. Ingredients.—1 oz. of gum tragacanth, pint of cold water, 8 pennyworth of essence of almonds, 2 teaspoonfuls of old rum. Mode.—Put the gum-tragacanth into a wide-mouthed bottle with the cold water; let it stand till dissolved, then stir into it the essence of almonds ; let it remain for an hour or two, when pour the rum on the top. This should982 HOUSEHOLD MA!<rAGEMEIsT. make the stock bottle^ and when any is required for use, it is merely necessary to dihite it with a little cold water until the desired consistency is obtained, and to keep it in a small bottle, well corked, for use. This bandoline, instead of injuring the hair, as many other kinds often do, improves it, by increasing its growth, and making it always smooth and glossy. An excellent Pomatum. ■2256. Ingredients.—1^ lb. of lard, I pint of olive-oil, g pint of caste r-oil, 4 oz. of spermaceti, bergamot, or any other scent; elder-flov/er water. Mode.—¥/ash the lard well in the elder-flower water ; drain, and beat it to a cream. Mix the two oils together, and heat them sufficiently to dissolve the spermaceti, which should be beaten fine in a mortar. Mix all these ingredients together with the brandy and whatever kind of scent may be preferred ; and whilst warm pour into glass bottles for use, keeping them well corked. The best way to liquefy the pomatum is to set the bottle in a saucepan of warm water. It v/ill remain good for many months. To promote tlie Growth, of Hair. 2257. Inghei^ients.—Equal quantities of olive-oil and spirit of rosemary; a few drops of oil of nutmeg. Mode.—Mix the ingredients together, rub the roots of the hair every night with a little of this liniment, and the growth of it will very soon sensibly increase. 2258. Our farther remarks on dressing must be confined to some general advice. In putting on a band, see that it is laid quite flat, and is drawn tightly round the waist before it is pinned in front; that the pin is a strong one, and that it is secured to the stays, so as not to slip up or down, or crease in the folds. Arrange the folds of the dress over the crinoline petticoats; if the dress fastens behind, put a small pin in the slit to prevent it from opening. See that the sleeves fall well over the arms. If it is finished with a jacket, or other upper dress, see that it fits smoothly under the arms; pull out the flounces, and spread out the petticoat at the bottom with the hands, so that it falls in graceful folds. In arranging the petticoat itself, a careful lady's-maid will see that this is firmly fastened round the waist. 2259. Where sashes are worn, pin the hows securely on the inside with a pin, so as not to be visible; then raise the bow v/ith the fingers. The collar is arranged and carefully adjusted with brooch or bow in the centre. 2260. Having dressed her mistress for brea,kfast, and breakfasted herself, the further duties of the lady's-maid will depend altogether upon the habits of the family, in which hardly two will probably agree. Where the duties are entirely connned to attendance on her mistress, it is probable that the bed- room and dressing-room will be committed to her care; that, the housemaid will rarely enter, except for the weekly or other peiiodlcal cleaning ; she will, therefore, have to make her mistress's bed, and keep it in order ; and as her duties are light and easy, there can be no allowance made for the slightest approach to uncleanliness or want of order. Every morning, immediately after her mistress has left it, and while breakfast is on, she should throw the bed open, by taking off the clothes ; open the windows (except in rainy weather), and leave the room to air for half an hour. After breakfast, except her attendanceDUTIES OF THE LADY'S-MAID. on her mistress prevents it, if tho rooms are carpeted, she should sweep thcni carefully, having previously strewed tho room with moist tea-leaves, dusting every table and chair, taking care to penetrate to every corner, and moving every article of furniture that is portable. This done satisfactorily, and having cleaned the dressing-glass, polished up the furniture and the orna- ments, and made the glass jug and basin clean and bright, emptied all slops, emptied the water-jugs and filled them with fresh water, and arranged the rooms, the dressing-room is ready for tho mistress when she thinks proper to appear. 2261. The dressing-room thoroughly in order, the same thing is to be done in the bedroom, in which she will probably be assisted by the housemaid to make the bed and empty the slops. In making tho bed, she will study her lady's wishes, whether it is to be hard or soft, sloping or straight, and see that it is done 5CCordingl3^ 2262. Having swept the bedroom with equal care, dusted the tables and chairs, chimney-ornaments, and put away all articles of dress left from yesterday, and cleaned and put away any articles of jewellery, her next care is to see, before her mistress goes out, what requires replacing in her department, and furnish her with a list of them, that she may use her dis- cretion about ordering them. All this done, she may settle herself down to any work on which she is engaged. This will consist chiefly in mending ; which is first to be seen to; everything, except stockings, being mended before washing. Plain work will probably be one of the lady's-maid's chief employments. 2263. A waiting-maid, who wishes to make herself useful, will study the fashion-books with attention, so as to be able to aid her mistress's judgment in dressing, according to the prevailing fashion, with such modifications as her style of countenance requires. She will also, if she Las her mistress's interest at heart, employ her s^are time in repairing and making up dresses which have served one purpose, to serve another also ; or turning many-things, unfitted for her mistress to use, for the younger branches of the family. The lady's-maid may thus render herself invaluable to her mistress, and increase her own happiness in so doing. The exigencies of fashion and luxury are such, that all ladies, except those of the very highest rank, will consider themselves fortunate in having about them a thoughtful person, capable of diverting their finery to a useful purpose. 2264. Among other duties, tho lady's-maid should understand thoA^arious processes for washing, and cleaning, and repairing laces ; edging of collars ; removing stains and gTease-spots from dresses, and similar processes, for which the following recipes will be found very useful. In washing— 2265. Blonde, fine toilet-soap is used; the blonde is soaped over very shghtly, and washed in water in which a little fig-blue is dissolved, rul;bing it very gently; when clean, dry it. Dip it afterwards in very thin gum-water, dry it again in linen, spread it out as fl-at as it will lie, and iron it. Where the blonde is of better quality, and wider, it^may be stretched on a hoop to dry after washing in the blue-water, applying the gum with a sponge ; or it may be washed finally in water in which a lump of sugar has Leen dissolved, which gives it more the appearance of new blonde. 2266. Lace collars soil very quickly when in contact with the neck; they are cleaned by beating the edge of the collar between the folds of a fine linen cloth, then washing the edges as directed above, and spreading it out on an ironing-board, pinning it at each corner with fine pins ; then going carefully over it with a sponge charged with water in<JSi HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT. wLich some gum-dragon and f5{?-blue have been dissolved, to pive it a proper con- sistence. To give the collar the same tint throughout, the ^vhole collar should be sponged with the same water, taking care not to touch the flowers. 2267. A multiplicity of accidents occur to soil and spot dresses, which should be removed at once. To remove— 2268. Grease-spots from cotton or woollen materials of fast colours, absorbent pastes, purilled buUock's-blood, and even common soap, are used, applied to the spot when dry. When the colours are not fast, use fuller's-earth or pulverized potter's-clay, laid in a layer over the sx?ot, and press it with a very hot iron. 22G9, For Silks, Moires, and x'llain or brocaded Satins, begin by pouring over the spot two drops of rectilied spirits of wine ; cover it over with a linen cloth, and press it with a hot iron, changing the linen instantly. The spot will look tarnished, for a portion of the grease still remains : this will be removed entirely by a little sulphuric ether dropped on the spot, and a very little rubbing. If neatly done, no perceptible mark or circle will remain; nor will the lustre of the richest silk be changed, the union of the two liquids ©iterating with no injurious effects from rubbing. 2270. Fruit-spots are removed from white and fast-coloured cottons by the use of chloride of soda. Commence by cold-soaping the article, then touch the spot with a hair-pencil or feather dipped in the chloride, dipping it immediately into cold water, to prevent the texture of the article being injured. 2271. TnJc-spofs are removed, when fresh applied to the spot, by a few drops of hofc water being poured on immediately afterwards. By the same process, iron-mould in linen or calico may be removed, dipping immediately in cold water to prevent injury ti> the fabric. 2272. Wax dropped on a shawl, table-cover, or cloth dress, is easily discharged by applying spirits of wine. 2273. Sirups or Preserved Fruits, by washing in lukewarm water with a dry cloth, and pressing the spot between two folds of clean linen. 2274. Essence of Lemon will remove grease, but will make a spot itself in a few days. To clean Silk or Hibbons. 2275. Ingredients.—\ pint of gin, § lb. of honey, | lb. of soft soap, J pint of water. Mode.—Mix the above ingredients together; then lay each breadth of silk upon a clean kitchen table or dresser, and scrub it well on the soiled side with the mixture. Have ready three vessels of cold water; take each piece of silk at two corners, and dip it up and down in each vessel, but do not wring- it ; and take care that each breadth has one vessel of quite clean water for the last dip. Hang it up dripping for a minute or two^ then dab it in a cloth, and iron it quickly with a very hot iron. To remove Paint-spots from Silk Cloth. 227v5. If the fabric will bear it, sharp rubbing will frequently entirely discharge a newly-made paint-stain ; but, if this is not successful, apply spirit of tui'pentine with a quill till the stains disappear. To make old Crape look nearly equal to new. 2277. Place a little water in a teakettle, and let it boil until there is plenty of steam from the spout; then, holding the crape in both hands, pass it to and fro several times through the steam, and it will bo clean and look nearly equal to new.085 DUTIES OF THE LADY'S-MAID. 2278. Linen. —Before sending- linen to wash, the lady's-maid should see that ever3'thing under her charge is properly mended ; for her own sake she should take care that it is sent out in an orderly manner, each class of garments by themselves, with a proper list, of which she retains a copy. On its return, it is still more necessary to examine every piece separately, so that all missing buttons be supplied, and only the articles properly washed and in perfect repair passed into the wardrobe. 2279. Ladies who keep a waiting-maid for their own persons are in the habit of paying visits to their friends, in which it is not unusual for the maid to accom- pany them; at all events, it is her duty to pack the trunks ; and this requires not onl}'- knowledge but some practice, although the improved trunks and port- manteaus now made, in which there is a place for nearly everything, render this more simple than formerly. Before packing, let the trunks be thoroughly well cleaned, and, if necessary, lined with paper, and everything intended for packing laid out on the bed or chairs, so that it may be seen what is to be stowed away; the nicer articles of dress neatly folded in clean calico wrappci-s. Having satisfied herself that ever3'thing wanted is laid out, and that it is in perfect order, the packing is commenced by disposing of the most bulky articles, the dressing-case and work-box, skirts, and other articles requiring room, leaving the smaller articles to fill up ; finally, having satisfied herself that all is included, she should lock and cover up the trunk in its canvas case, and then pack her own box, if she is to accompany her mistress. 2280. On reaching the house, the lady's-maid w^illbe shown her lady's apart- ment ; and her duties here are what they were at home ; she wall arrange her mistress's things, and learn which is her bell, in order to go to her when she rings. Her meals will be taken in the housekeeper's room ; and here she must be discreet and guarded in her talk to any one of her mistress or her concerns. Her only occupation here will be attending in her lady's room, keeping her things in order, and making her rooms comfortable for her. 2281. The evening duties of a lady's-maid are pretty nearly a repetition of those of the morning. She is in attendance when her mistress retires; she assists her to undress if required, brushes her hair, and renders such other assistance as is demanded ; removes all slops ; takes care that the fire, if any, is safe, before she retires to rest herself. 2282. Ironing is a part of the duties of a lady's-maid, and she should bo able to do it in the most perfect manner when it becomes necessary. Ironing is often badly done from inattention to a few very simple requirements. Cleanliness is the first essential: the ironing-board, the fire, the iron, and the ironing-blanket should all be perfectly clean. It wnll not be necessary here to enter into details on ironing, as full directions are given in the Duties of the Laundry-maid." A lady's-maid will have a great deal of ironing-out" to do; such as light evening dresses, muslin dresses, &c., whichHOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT. 988 are not dirty enougli to be washed, but merely require smoothing out to remove the creases. In summer, particularly, an iron will be constantly required, as also a skirt-board, which should be covered'with a nice clean piece of flannel. To keep muslin dresses in order, they almost require smoothing out every time they are worn, particularly if made with many flounces. The lady's-maid may often have to iDcrform little services for her mistress which require care; such as restoring the colour, to scorched linen, &c. &c. The following recipe is, we believe, a very good one. To restore "Whiteness to scorched Linen. 2283. Ingredients.—2 pint of vinegar, 2 oz. of fuller's-earth, 1 oz. of dried fowls' dung, ^ oz. of soap, the juice of 2 large onions. Mode.—Boil all these ingredients together to the consistency of paste; spread the composition thickly over the damaged part, and if the threads be not actually consumed, after it has been a'Uowed to dry on, and the place has subsequently been washed once or twice, every trace of scorching will disappear. 228i. Furs, Feathers, and Woollens require the constant care of the walting-maid. Furs and feathers not in constant use should be wrapped up in linen washed in lye. From May to September they are subject to being made the depositary of the moth-eggs. They should bo looked too, and shaken and beaten, from time to time, in case some of the eggs should have been lodged in them, in spite of every precaution; laying them up again, or rather folding them up as before, wrapping them in brown paper, which is itself a preservative. Shawls and cloaks, which would be damaged by such close folds, must be looked to, and aired and beaten, putting them away dry before the evening. Preservatives against the Bavages of Motlis. 2285. Place pieces of camphor, cedar-wood, Kussia leather, tobacco-leaves, bog-myrtle, or anything else strongly aromatic, in the drawers or boxes where furs or other things to be preserved from moths are kept, and they will never take harm. 2283. Jewels are generally wrapped up in cotton, and kept in their cases; but they are subject to tarnish from exposure to the air, and require cleaning. This is done by preparing clean soap-suds, using fine toilet-soap. Dip any article of gold, silver, gilt, or precious stones into this lye, and dry them by brushing with a brush of soft badgers' hair, or a fine sponge; afterwards with a piece of fine cloth, and, lastly, with a soft leather. 2287. Fpaulettes of gold or silver, and, in general, all articles of jewellery, may be dressed by dipping them in spirits of wine warmed in a hain marie, or shallow kettle, placed over a slow fire or hot-plate. 228S. The valet and lady's-maid, from their supposed influence with their master and mistress, are exposed to some temptations to which other servants are less subjected. They are probably in communication with the trades- people who supply articles for the toilet; such as hatters, tailors, dressmakers, and perfumers. The conduct of waiting-maid and valet to these people should be civil but independent, making reasonable allowance for want of exact punctuality, if any such can be made : they should represent any incon- venience respectfully, and if an excuse seems unreasonable, put the matter fairly to master or mistress, leaving it to them to notice it further, if they thinkDUTIES OF THE HOUSEMAID. 987 it necessary. No expectations of a personal character should influence them one way or the other. It would be acting unreasonably to any domestic to make them refuse such presents as tradespeople choose to give them ; the utmost that can be expected is that they should not influence their judgment in the articles supplied—that they should represent them truly to master or mistress, without fear and without favour. Civility to all, servility to none, is a good maxim for every one. Deference to a master and mistress, and to their friends and visitors, is one of the implied terms of their engage- ment ; and this deference must apply even to what may be considered their whims. A servant is not to be seated, or wear a hat in the house, in his master's or mistress's presence; nor offer any opinion, unless asked for it; nor even to say ''good night," or ''good morning," except in reply to that salutation. To preserve cut Flowers. 2289. A bouquet of freshly-cut flowers may be preserved alive for a long time by placing them in a glass or vase with fresh water, in which a little charcoal has been steeped, or a small piece of camphor dissolved. The vase should be set upon a plate or dish, and covered with a bell-glass, around the edges of which, when it comes in contact with the plate, a little water should be poured to exclude the au% To revive cut Flowers after packing. 2290. Plunge the stems into boiling v/ater, and by the time the water is cold, the flowers will have revived. Then cut afresh the ends of the stems, and keep them in fresh cold water. TJPPEB ANB UNDEB HOUSEMAIDS. 2291. Housemaids, in large establishments, have usually one or more assistants ; in this case they are upper and under housemaids. Dividing the work between them, the upper housemaid will probably reserve lor herself the task of dusting the ornaments and cleaning the furniture of the principal apartments, but it is her duty to see that every depart- ment is properly attended to. The number of assistants depends on the n\imber in the family, as well as on the style in which the establishment is kept up. In wealthy families it is not unusual for every grown-up daughter to have her waiting-maid, whose duty it is to keep her mistress's apart- ments in order, thus abridging the housemaid's duties. In others, perhaps, one waiting-maid attends on two or three, when the housemaid's assistance will be more requisite. In fact, every establishment has some customs peculiar to itself, on which v\^o need not dwell; the general duties are the s :.7n$ in all, perfect cleanhness and order being the object.9S3 HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT. DUTIES OF THE HOUSEMAID. 2292. "Cleanliness is next to godliness," saitli the proverb, and order " is in tliG next degree ; the housemaid, then, may be said to be the handmaiden to two of the most prominent virtues. Her duties are very numerous, and many of the comforts of the family depend on their performance ; but they are simple and easy to a person naturally clean and orderly, and desirous of giving satisfaction. In all families, vv^hatever the habits of the master and mistress, servants will find it advantageous to rise early ; their daily work will thus come easy to them. If they rise late, there is a struggle to overtake it, which throws an air of haste and hurry over the whole establishment. Where the master's time is regulated by early business or professional engage- ments, this will, of course, regulate the hours of the servants ; but even where that is not the case, servants will find great personal convenience in rising early and getting through their work in an orderly and methodical manner. The housemaid who studies her own ease will certainly be at her work by six o'clock in the summer, and, probably, half-past six or seven in the winter months, having spent a reasonable time in her own chamber in dressing. Earlier than this would, probably, be an mmecessary waste of coals and candle in winter. 2293. The first duty of the housemaid in winter is to open the shutters of all the lower rooms in the house, and take up the hearth-rugs of those rooms which she is going to do " before breakfast. In some families, where there is only a cook and housemaid kept, and where the drawing-rooms are large, the cook has the care of the dining- room, and the housemaid that of the break- fast-room, library, and drawing-rooms. After the shutters are all opened, she sweeps tlio breakfast-room, sweeping the dust towards the fire-place, of course previously removing the fender. She should then lay a cloth (generally made of coarse wrappering) over the carpet in front of the stove, and on this should place her CAEPET-BKOOilS. . ' . ^ housemaid's box, containing black-lead brushes, leathers, emery-paper, cloth, black lead, and all utensils necessary for cleaning a grate, with the cinder-pail on the other side. 2294. She now sweeps-up the ashes, and deposits them in her cindor-pail, which is a japanned tin pail, with a wire-sifter inside, and a closely-fitting top. In this pail the cinders are sifted, and reserved for use in the kitchen or under the copper, the ashes only being thrown away. The cinders disposed of, she proceeds to black-lead the grate, producing the black lead, the soft brush for laying it on, her blacking and polishing brashes, from the box which containsDUTIES OF THE HOUSEMAID. 989 her tools. This housemaid's box should he kept well stcckcd. Having blackened, brushed, and polished every part, and made all clean and bright, she now proceeds to lay the firo. Sometimes it is very difficult to get a proper polish to black grates, particularly if they have been neglected, and allowed to rust at all. Brunsvv-ick black, which is an excellent varnish for grates, may be prepared in the following manner:— 2295. Ingredients.—1 lb. of common asphaltum, | pint ot linseed oil, 1 quart of oil of turpentine. Mode.—Melt the asphaltum, and add gradually to it the other two ingredients. Apply this with a small painter's brush, and leave it to become perfectly dry. The grate will need no other cleaning, but will merely require dusting every day, and occasionally brushing with a dry black-lead brush. This is, of com*se, when no fires are used. When they are required, the bars, cheeks, and back of the grate will need black-leading in the usual manner. 2296. Fire-lighting, however simple, is an operation reqnirinf^ some skill; a fire is readily made by laying a few cinders at the bottom in open order; over this a few pieces of paper, and over that again eight or ten pieces of dry wood; over the wood, a course of moderate-sized pieces of coal, taking care to leave hollow spaces between for air at the centre; and taking care to lay the whole well back in the grate, so that the smoke may go up the chimney, and not into the I'oom. This done, fire the paper with a match from below, and, if propei'ly laid, it will soon burn up; the stream of flame from the wood and paper soon communicating to the coals and cinders, provided there ia plenty of air at the centre. ^ 2297. A new method of lighting a fire is sometimes practised with advantage, the fire lighting from the top and burning down, in place of being lighted and burning up from below. This is arranged by laying the coals v.t the bottom, mixed with a few good-sized cinders, and the wood at the top, with another layer of coals and some paper over it; the paper is lighted in the usual way, and soon burns down to a good fire, with some economy of fuel, as is said. 2298. Bright grates require unceasing attention to keep them in perfect order. A day should never pass without the housemaid rubbing with a dry leather the polished parts of a grate, as also the fender and fire-irons. A careful and attentive housemaid should have no occasion ever to use emery- paper for any part but the bars, which, of course, become blackened by the fire. (Some mistresses, to save labour, have a double set of bars, one set bright for the summer, and another black set to use when fires are in requi- STOVE-BEUSHES, housemaid's box.HOUSEHOLD MANAGEME^^T. 990 sition.) When briglit grates are once neglected,, small rust-spots begin to show themselves, which a plain leather will not remove ; the following method of cleaning them must then be resorted to:—First, thoroughly clean with emery-paper ; then take a large smooth pebble from the road, sufficiently large to hold comfortably in the hand, with which rub the steel backwards and forwards one way, until the desired polish is obtained. It may appear at first to scratch, but continue rubbing, and the result will be success. The following is also an excellent i)olish for bright stoves and steel articles :— 2299. I^TGREDiENTS.—1 tablcspoonful of turpentine, 1 ditto of sweet oil, emery powder. Mode.—Mix the turpentine and sweet oil together, stirring in sufficient emery powder to make the mixture of the thickness of cream. Put it on the article with a piece of soft flannel, rub off quickly with another piece, then polish with a little dry emery powder and clean leather, 2300. The several fires lighted, the housemaid proceeds with her dusting, and polishing the several pieces of furniture in the breakfast-parlour, leaving no corner unvisited. Before sweeping the carpet, it is a good practice to sprinkle it all over with tea-leaves, which not only lay all dust, but give a slightly fragrant smell to the room. It is now in order for the reception of the family; and where there is neither footman nor parlour-maid, she now proceeds to the dressing-room, and lights her mistress's fire, if she is in the habit of having one to dress by. Her miistress is called, hot water placed in the dressing-room for her use, her clothes—as far as they are under the house- maid's charge—put beiore the fire to air, hanging a fire-guard on the bars vrhere there is one, while she proceeds to prepare the breakfast. ^301. In summer the housemaid's work is considerably abridged : she throws open the windows oi the several rooms not occupied as bedrooms, that they may receive the fresh morning air before they are. occupied; she prepares the breakfast-room by sweeping the carpet, rubbing tables and chairs, dusting mantel-shelf and picture-frames with a light brush, dusting the larniture, and beating and sweeping the rug; she cleans the grate when necessary, and replaces the white paper or arranges the shavings with which it is filled, leaving eveiything clean and tidy lor breakfast. It is not enough, however, in cleaning furniture, just to pass lightly over the surface ; the rims and legs of tables, and the backs and legs of chairs and sofas, should be rubbed vigorously daily ; if there is a book-case, every corner of every pane and ledge reqirlres to be carefully wiped, so that not a speck of dust can be found in the room. 2302. After the breakfast-room is finished, the housemaid should proceed to sweep down the stairs, comm.encing at the top, whilst the cook has the charge of the hall, door-step, and passages. After this she should go into the drawing-room, cover up every article of lurniture that is likely to spoil, withDUTIESOP THE HOUSEMAID. 991 large dusting-sheets, and put the chairs together, by turning them seat to seat, and, in fact, make as much room as pa^isible, by placing all the loose furniture in the middle of the room, whilst she sweeps the corners and sides. When this is accomplished, the furniture can then be put back in its place, and the middle of the room swept, sweeping the dirt, as before said, towards the fireplace. The same rules should be observed in cleaning the drawing- room grates as we have just stated, putting down the cloth, before commencing, to prevent the carpet from getting soiled. In the country, a room would not require sweeping thoroughly like this more than twice a week; but the house- maid should go over it every morning with a dust-pan and broom, taking up every crumb and piece she may see. After the sweeping she should leave the room, shut the door, and proceed to lay the breakfast. AVhere there is neither footman nor parlour-maid kept, the duty of laying the breakfast- cloth rests on the housemaid. 2303. Before laying the cloth for breakfast, the heater of the tea-urn is to be placed in the hottest part of the kitchen fire; or, where the kettle is used, boiled on the kitchen fire, and then removed to the parlour, where it is kept hot. Having washed herself free from the dust arising from the morning's work, the housemaid collects the breakfast-things on her tray, takes the breakfast-cloth from the napkin press, and carries them all on the tray into the parlour ; arranges them on the table, placing a sufficiency of knives, forks, and salt-cellars for the family, and takes the tray back to the pantry; gets a supply of milk, cream, and bread ; fills the butter-dish, taking care that the salt is plentiful, and soft and dry, and that hot plates and egg-cups are ready where warm meat or eggs are served, and that butter-knife and bread-knife are in their places. And now she should give the signal for breakfast, holding herself ready to fill the urn with hot water, or hand the kett'e, and take in the rolls, toast, and other eatables, with which the cook supplies her, v,^hen the breakfast-room bell rings ; bearing in mind that she is never to enter the parlour with dirty hands or with a dirty apron, and that everything is to be handed on a tray ; that she is to hand everything she may be required to supply, on the left hand of the person she is serving, and that all is done quietly and without bustle or hurry. In some families, where there is a large number to attend on, the cook waits at breakfast whilst the housemaid is busy upstairs in the bedrooms, or sweeping, dusting, and putti5ig the drawing- room in order. 2304. Breakfast seiT-ed, the housemaid proceeds to the bed-chambers, throws up the sashes, if not already done, pulls up the blinds, throwing back curtains at the same time, and opens the beds, by removing the clothes. BA^'ISTER-EK00lr. BTAIECASE-BEOOII.992 HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT. placing them over a horsC; or, failing that, over the backs of chairs. Sho now proceeds to empty the sloj^s. In doing this, everything is emptied into the slop-pail, leaving a little scalding-hot water for a minute in such vessels as require it; adding a drop of turpentine to the water, when that is not sufficient to cleanse them. The basin is emptied, well rinsed with clean water, and carefully wiped ; the ewers emptied and washed; finally, the water-jngs themselves emptied out and rinsed, and wiped dry. As soon as this is done, she should remove and empty the pails, taking care that they also are well washed, scalded, and wiped as soon as they are empty. 2305. Next follows bedmaking, at which the cook or kitchen-maid, where one is kept, usually assists ; but, before beginning, velvet chairs, or other things injured by dust, should bo removed to another room. In bedmaking, the fancy of its occupant should be consulted; some like beds sloping from the top towards the feet, swelling slightly in the middle ; others, perfectly flat: a good housemaid will accommodate each bed to the taste of the sleeper, taking care to shake, beat, and turn it well in the process. Some persons prefer sleeping on the mattress; in which case a feather bed is usually beneath, resting on a second mattress, and a straw paillasse at the bottom. In this case, the mattresses should change places daily ; the feather bed placed on tho mattress shaken, beaten, taken up and opened several times, so as thoroughly to separate the feathers : if too large to be thus handled, the maid should shake and beat one end first, and then the other, smoothing it afterwards equally all over into the required shape, and place the mattress gently over it. Any feathers which escape in this process a tidy servant will put back through the seam of the tick; she will also be careful to sew up any stitch that gives way the moment it is discovered. The bedclothes are laid on, beginning with an under blanket and sheet, which are tucked under the mattress at the bottom. The bolster is then beaten and shaken, and put on, the top of the sheet rolled round it, and the sheet tucked in all round. The pillows and other bedclothes follow, and the counterpane over all, which should fall in grace- ful folds, and at equal distance from the ground all round. The curtains are drawn to the head and folded neatly across the bed, and the whole finished in a smooth and graceful manner. Where sjDring-mattresses are used, care should be taken that the top one is turned every day. The housemaid should now take up in a dustpan any pieces that may bo on the carpet; she should dust the room, shut the door, and proceed to another room. When all the bedrooms are finished, she should dust the stairs, and polish the handrail of the banisters, and see that all ledges, window-sills, &c., are quite free from dust. It will be necessary for tlje housemaid to divide her work, so that she may not have too much to do on certain days, and not sufficient to fill up her time on other days. In the country, bedrooms should be swept and thoroughly cleaned once a week ; and to be methodical and regular in her work, the house- maid should have certain days for doing certain rooms thoroughly. For instance, the drawing-room on Monday, two bedrooms on Tuesday, two oil Wednesday, and so on, reserving a daj; for thoroughly cleaning tlie plate.903 DUTII'S OF THE IIOUSErixVlD. bedroom candlesticks, kc. &c., wliieli she will have to do where there is no parlonr-maid or footman kept. By this moans the -vYork will be divided, and there will be no unnecessary bustling and hurrying, as is the case where the work is done any time, without rule or regulation. 2306. Once a week, w^hen a bedroom is to be thoroughly cleaned, the house- maid should commence by brushing the mattresses of the bed before it is made; she should then make it, shake the curtains, lay them smoothly on the bed, and pin or tuck up the bottom valance, so that she may be able to sweep under the bed. She should then unloop the window-curtains, shako them, and pin them high up out of the way. After clear- ing the dressing-table, and the room altogether of httlo articles of china, &c. &c., she should shako the toilet- covers, fold them up, and lay them on the bod, over which a large dusting-sheet should be thrown. She should then sweep the room ; first of all si^rinkling the /^^^^^■■■■■■mmm'i^^ carpet with well-squeezed tea- SWFWi'ffl^^^ leaves, or a little freshly-pulled EcrvTTBBiNG-BiirsH. grass, when this is obtainable. After the carpet is swept, and the grate cleaned, she should wash with soap and water, with a little soda in it, the washing-table apparatus, removing all marks or fur round the jugs, caused by the water. The water- bottles and tumblers must also have hor attention, as well as the top of the washing-stand, which should be cleaned with soap and flannel if it be marble: if of ^^^^^ „ polished mahogany, no soap must be used. When these are all clean and arranged in their places, the housemaid should scrub the floor where it is not covered with carpet, under the beds, and round the wainscot. She should use as little soap and soda as possible, as too free a use of these articles is liable to give the boards a black appearance. In the country, cold soft water, a clean scrubbing-brush, and a willing arm, are all that are required to make bedroom floors look white. In winter it is not advisable to scrub rooms too often, as it is difficult to dry them thoroughly at that season of the year, and nothing is more dangerous than to allow persons to sleep in a damp room. The housemaid should now dust the furni- ture, blinds, ornaments, &c.; polish the looking-glass; arrange the toilet-cover and muslin ; remove the cover from the bed, and straighten and arrange the curtains and counterpane. A bedroom should be cleaned like this every week. There are times, however, when it is necessary to have the carpet up ; this should be done once a year in the country, and twice a year in large cities. The best tim.e for these arrangem.ents is spring and autumn, when the bed-furniture requires changing to suit the seasons of the year. After arranging the furniture, it should all be well rubbed and polished ; and for this purpose the housemaid should provide herself with an old silk pocket-hand- kerchief, to finish the i:)olisliing. o S994 HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT, •2307. As modern furniture is now, nearly always Frencli-polished, it should often be rubbed with an old silk rubber, or a fine cloth or duster, to keep it free from smears. Three or four times a year any of the following polishes may be applied with very great success, as any of them make French-polished furniture look very well. One precaution must be taken,—not to put too much of the polish on at one time, and to rub, not smear it over the articles. Furniture Polish.. 2308. Ingredients. — 5 pint of linseed - oil, 5 pint of vinegar, 1 oz. of spirits of salts, I oz. of muriatic antimony. Mode.—Mix all well together, and shake before using. Furniture Polish. 2309. Ingredients.—Equal proportions of linseed-oil, turpentine, vinegar, and spirits of wine. Mode.—When used, shake the mixture well, and rub on the furniture with a piece of linen rag, and polish with a clean duster. Vinegar and oil, rubbed in with flannel, and the furniture rubbed with a clean duster, produce a very good polish. Furniture Paste. 2310. Ingredients.—3 oz. of common beeswax, 1 oz. of white wax, 1 oz. of curd soap, 1 pint of turpentine, 1 pint of boiled water. Mode.—Mix the ingredients together, adding the water when cold ; shake ^^^^^^ the mixture frequently in the bottle, and do not use it for tff^ ^z!^^^ hours after it is made. It should be applied with a ^MHliBii*^ piece of flannel, the furniture polished with a duster, and FUBNiTUKE-BEusH. then with an old silk rubber. 2311. The chambers are finished, the chamber candlesticks brought down and cleaned, the parlour lamps trimmed ;—and here the housemaid's utmost care is required. In cleaning candlesticks, as in every other cleaning, she should have cloths and brushes kept for that purpose alone ; the knife used to scrape them should be applied to no other purpose ; the tallow-grease should be thrown into a box kept for the purpose ; the same with everything connected with the lamp-trimming ; the best mode of doing which she will do well to learn from the tradesman who supplies the oil; always bearing in mind, how- ever, that without perfect cleanhness, which involves occasional scalding, no lamp can be kept in order. 2312. The drawing and dining-room, inasmuch as everything there is more costly and valuable, require even more care. When the carpets are of the kind known as velvet-pile, they require to be swept firmly by a hard whisk brush, made of cocoanut fibre. 2313. The furniture must be carefully gone over in every corner with a soft cloth, that it may be left perfectly free from dust; or where that is beyond reach, with a brush made of long feathers, or a goose's wing. The sofas are995 DUTILS OF THE HOUSEMAID. swept in the same manner, slightly beaten, the cushions shaken and smoothed, the picture-frames swept, and everything arranged in its proper place. This, of course, applies to dining as well as drawing-room and morning-room. And now the housemaid may dress herself for the day, and prepare for the family dinner, at which she must attend. 2314. We need not repeat the long instructions already given for laying the dinner-table. At the family dinner, even where no footman waits, the routine will be the same. In most families the cloth is laid with the slips on each side, with napkins, knives, forks, spoons, and wine and finger glasses on all occasions. "2315. She should ascertain that her plate is in order, glasses free from smears, water-bottles and decanters the same, and everything ready on her tray, that she may be able to lay her cloth properly. Few things add more to the neat and com- fortable appearance of a dinner-table than well- polished plate; indeed, the state of the plate is a certain indication of a well-managed or ill- managed household. Nothing is easier than to keep plate in good order, and yet many servants, from stupidity and ignorance, make it the greatest trouble of all things under butler's trat and stand. their care. It should be remembered, that it is utterly impossible to make greasy silver take a polish; and that as spoons and forks in daily use are continually in contact with grease, they must require good washing in soap- and-water to remove it. Silver should be washed with a soapy flannel in one water, rinsed in another, and then wiped dry with a dry cloth. The plate so washed may be polished with the plate-rags, as in the following directions:—Once a week all the plate should receive a thorough cleaning with the hartshorn powder, as directed in the first recipe for cleaning plate ; and where the housemaid can find time, rubbed every day with the plate-rags. 2316. Hartshorn, we may observe, is one of the best possible ingredients for plate- owder in daily use. It leaves on the silver a deep, dark polish, and at the same time oes less injury than anything else. It has also the advantage of being very cheap ; almost all the ordinary powders sold in boxes containing more or less of quicksilver, in some form or another; and this in process of time is sure to make the plate brittle. If any one wishes to be convinced of the effect of quicksilver on plate, he has only to rub a little of it on one place for some time,—on the handle of a silver teaspoon for instance, and he will find it break in that spot with very little pressure. To Clean Plate. A very excellent method. 2317, Wash the plate well to remove all grease, in a strong lather of com- mon yellow soap and boiling water, and wipe it yL^,,.,,,,^,,,^^^,^,,,.. --— ir^ quite dry ; then mix as much hartshorn powder as ^irairlnl fWfmlll will be required, into a thick paste,with cold water plate-brush. or spirits of wine ; smear this lightly over the plate with a piece of soft rag, 3 s 2HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT. and leave it for somo little time to'dry. "When pcrfectlj^ dry, brush it off qrdte clean with a soft plate-brush, and polish the plate with a dry leather. If the jolate be very dirty, or much tarnished, spirits of wine will bo found to answer better than the vrater for mixing the paste. Plate-ra,gs for daily use. 2318. Boil soft rag-s (nothing is better for the purpose than the tops of old cotton stockings) in a mixture of new milk and hartshorn powder, in the pro- jDortion of 1 oz. of powder to a pint of milk ; boil them for 5 minutes; wring them as soon as they are taken out, for a moment, in cold water, and dry them before the fire. AVith these rags rub the plate briskly as soon as it has been well washed and dried after daily use. A most beautiful deep polish will be produced, and the plate will require nothing more than merely to be dusted with a leather or a dry soft cloth, before it is again put on the table. 2319. For waiting at table, the housemaid should be neatly and cleanly dressed, and, if possible, her dress made with closed sleeves, the large open ones dipping and falling into everything on the table, and being very much in the way. She should not wear creaking boots, and should move about the room as noiselessly as possible, anticipating people's wants by handing thorn things without being asked for them, and altogether be as quiet as possible. It will be needless here to repeat what we have already said respecting waiting at table, in the duties of the butler and footman : rules that are good to be observed by them, are equally good for the parlour-maid or housemaid. 2320. The housemfiid having announced that dinner is on the table, will hand the soup, fish, meat, or side-dishes to the different members of the family; but in families who do not spend much of the day together, they will probably prefer being alone at dinner and breakfast: the housemaid will be required, after all are helped, if her master does not wish her to stay in the room, to go on with her work of cleaning up in the pantry, and answer the bell when rung. In this case she will jDlace a pile of plates on the table or a dumb- waiter, within reach of her master and mistress, and leave the room. 2321. Dinner over, the housemaid removes the plates and dishes on the tray, places the dirty knives and forks in the basket prepared for them, folds up the napkins in the ring which indicates by which member of the family it has been used, brushes off the crumbs on the hand- tray kept for the purpose, folds up the table- cloth in the folds already made, and places it in the linen-press to be sm.oothed out. After every meal the table should be rubbed, all marks from hot plates removed, and the table-cover thrown over, and the room restored to its usual order. If the family retire to the drawing- room, or any other room, it is a good x^ractice to throw up the sash to admiii fresh air and ventilate the room, ;DUTIES OF THE HOUSEMAID. ^322. The housemaid's evening service consists in washing up the dinner- things, the plate, plated articles, and glasses, restoring everything to its place ; cleaning up her pantry, and putting away everything for use when next required; lastly, preparing for tea, as the time approaches, by setting the things out on the tray, getting the urn or kettle ready, with cream and other things usually partaken of at that meal. 2323. In summer-time the windows of all the bedrcoms, which have been closed during the heat of the day, should be thrown open for an hour or so after sunset, in order to air them. Before dark they should be closed, the bedclothes turned down, and the night-clothes laid in order for use when required. During winter, where fires are required in the dressing-rooms, they should be lighted an hour before the usual time of retiring, placing a fire-guard before each fire. At the same time, the night-things on the horse should bo placed before it to be aired, with a tin can of hot water, if the mistress is in the habit of washing before going to bed. We may add, that there is no greater preservative of beauty than washing the face every night in hot water. The housemaid will probably be required to assist her mistress to undress and put her dress in order for the morrow ; in which case her duties are veiy much those of the lady's-maid. 2324. And now the fire is made up for the night, the fireguard replaced, and everything in the room in order for the night, the housemaid taking care to leave the night-candle and matches together in a convenient place, should they be required. It is usual in summer to remove all highly fragrant flowers from sleeping-rooms, the impression being that their scent is injurious in a close chamber. 2325. On leisure days_, the housemaid should be able to do some needlework for her mistress,—such as turning and mending sheets and darning the house linen, or assist her in anything she may think fit to give her to do. For this reason it is almost essential that a housemaid, in a small family, should be an expert needlewoman ; as, if she be a good manager and an active girl, she will have time on her hands to get through plenty of work. 2326. Periodical Cleanings. —Besides the daily routine which we have described, there are portions of every house which can only be thoroughly cleaned occasionally ; at which time the whole house usually undergoes a more thorough cleaning than is permitted in the general way. On these occasions it is usual to begin at the top of the house and clean downwards; moving everything out of the room ; washing the wainscoting or paint with soft soap and water; pulling down the beds and thoroughly cleansing all the joints; '•'scrubbing" the floor; beating feather beds, mattress, and paillasse, and thoroughly purifying every article of furniture before it is put back in its place.HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT. 998 2327. This general cleaning usually takes place in the springer early summer, when the warm curtains of winter are replaced by the light and cheerful muslin curtains. Carpets are at the same time taken up and beaten, except where the mistress of the house has been worried into an experiment by the often-reiterated question, Why beat your carpets ? " In this case she will probably have made up her mind to try the cleaning process, and arranged with the company to send for them on the morning when cleaning commenced. It is hardly necessary to repeat, that on this occasion every article is to be gone over, the French-polished furniture well rubbed and HOTJSE-PAIL. DUSTING-BRUSH. polished. The same thorough system of cleaning should be done throughout the house; the walls cleaned where painted, and swept down with a soft broom or feather brush where papered; the window and bed curtains, which have been replaced with musHn ones, carefully brushed, or, if they require it, cleaned ; lamps not likely to be required, washed out with hot water, dried, and cleaned. The several grates are now to be furnished with their summer ornaments; and we know none prettier than the following, which the housemaid may provide at a small expense to her mistress :—Purchase two yards and a half of crinoline muslin, and tear it into small strips, the selvage way of the material, about an inch wide ; strip this thread by thread on each side, leaving the four centre threads; this gives about six-and-thirty pieces, fringed on each side, which are tied together at one end, and fastened to the trap of the register, while the threads, unravelled, are spread gracefully about the grate, the lower part of which is filled with paper shavings. This makes a very elegant and very cheap ornament, which is much stronger, besides, than those usually purchased. 2328. As winter approaches, this house-cleaning will have to be repeated, and the warm bed and window curtains replaced. The process of scouring and cleaning is again necessary, and must be gone through, beginning at the top, and going through the house, down to the kitchens. 2329. Independently of these daily and periodical cleanings, other occupations will present themselves from time to time, which the housemaid will have to perform. When spots show on polished furniture, they can generally be restored by soap-and-water and a sponge, the polish being brought out by999 DUTIES OP THE HOUSEMAID. nsing a little polish, and then well rubbing it. Again, drawers which draw out stiffly may be made to move more easily if the spot where they press is rubbed over with a little soap. 2330. Chips broken off any of the furniture should be collected and re- placed, by m^eans of a little glue applied to it. Liquid glue, which is sold prepared in bottles, is very useful to have in the house, as it requires no melting; and anything broken can be so quickly repaired. 2331. Breaking glass and china is about the most disagreeable thing that can happen in a family, and it is, probably, a greater annoyance to a right- minded servant than to the mistress. A neat-handed housemaid may some- times repair these breakages, where they are not broken in very conspicuous places, by joining the pieces very neatly together with a cement made as follows :—Dissolve an ounce of gum mastic in a quantity of highly-rectified spirits of w'.ne ; then soften an ounce of isinglass in warm water, and, finally, dissolve it in rum or brandy, till it forms a thick jelly. Mix the isinglass and gum mastic together, adding a quarter of an ounce of finely-powdered gum ammoniac ; put the whole into an earthen pipkin, and in a warm place, till they are thoroughly incorporated together; pour it into a small phial, and cork it down for use. 2332. In using it, dissolve a small piece of the cement in a silver teaspoon ovel" a lighted candle. The broken pieces of glass or china being warmed, and touched with the now liquid cement, join the parts neatly together, and hold in their places till the cement has set; then wipe away the cement adhering to the edge of the joint, and leave it for twelve hours without touching it: the joint will be as strong as the china itself, and if neatly done^ it will show no joining. It is essential that neither of the pieces be wetted either with hot or cold water. USEFUL EECIPES FOR HOUSEMAIDS. To clean Marble. 2333. Mix with I pint of soap lees, 5 gill of turpentine, sufficient pipe-clay and bullock's gall to make the whole into rather a thick paste. Apply it to the marble with a soft brush, and after a day or two, when quite dry, rub it off with a soft rag. Apply this a second or third time till the marble is quite clean. Another method. 2334. Take two parts of soda, one of pumice-stone, and one of finely- powdered chalk. Sift these through a fine sieve, and mix them into a paste with water. Rub this well all over the marble, and the stains will be removed; then wash it with soap-and-water, and a beautiful bright polish will be produced.,HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT, 1000 To clean Floorclotli. 2335. After having waslied tliG floorcloth in the usual manner with a damp flannel, wet it all over with milk and rub it well with a dry cloth, when a most beautiful polish will be brought out. Some persons use for rubbing a well-waxed flannel; but this in general produces an unpleasant slipperiness, which is not the case with the milk. To clean Decanters. 2336. Boll up in small pieces some soft brown or blotting paper ; wet them, and soap them well. Put them into the decanters about one quarter full of v/arm water ; shake them well for a few minutes, then rinse vvith clear cold water ; wipe the outsides with a nice dry cloth, put the decanters to drain, and when dry they v/ill be almost as bright as new ones. To brigliten Gilt Frames. 2337. Take sufficient flour of sulphur to give a golden tinge to about 1^ pint of water, and in this boil 4 or 5 bruised onions, or garlic, which will answer the same purpose. Strain off the liquid, and with it, when cold, ^vash, wuth a soft brush, any gilding which requires restoring, and when dry it will come out as bright as new work. To preserve bright Grates or Fire-irons from Bust. 2338. Jlake a strong paste of fresh lime and water, and with a fine brush smear it as thickly as possible over all the polished surface requiring preserva- tion. By this simple means, all the grates and fire-irons in an empty house may be kept for months free from harm, without further care or attention. German Furniture-Gloss. 2339. Ingredients.—^ lb. yellow wax, 1 oz. black rosin, 2 oz. of oil of turpentine. Mode.—Cut the wax into small pieces, and melt it in a pipkin, with the rosin pounded very fine. Stir in gradually, while these two ingredients are quite warm, the oil of turpentine. Keep this composition well covered for use in a tin or earthen pot. A little of this gloss should be spread on a piece of coarse woollen cloth, and the furniture well rubbed with it; afterwards it should be polished with a fine cloth.1001 DUTIES OF THS MAID-OF-ALL-WOBK. 2340. The general servant, or maid-of-all-work, is perhaps the only one of her class deserving* of commiserat ion: hor life is a solitary one, and in, some places, her work is never done. She is also subj ect to rougher treatment than either the house or kitchen-maid, especially in her earher career: she starts in life, probably a girl of thirteen, with some small tradesman's wife as her mistress, just a stey above her in the social scale; and although the class contains among them many excellent, kind-hearted women, it also contains some very rough speci- mens of the feminine gender, and to some of these it occasionally falls to give our maid-of-all-work her first lessons in her multifarious occupations : the mistress's commands are the measure of the maid-of-all-work's duties. By the time she has become a tolerable servant, she is probably engaged in some respectable tradesman's house, where she has to rise with the lark, for she has to do in her own person all the w^ork which in larger establishments is performed by cook, kitchen-maid, and housemaid, and occasionally the part of a footman's duty, which consists in carrying messages. 2341. The general servant's duties commence by opening the shutters (and windows, if the weather permits) of all the lower apartments in the house; she should then brush up her kitchen-range, light the fire, clear away the ashes, clean the hearth, and polish with a leather the bright parts of the range, doing all as rapidly and as vigorously as possible, that no more time be wasted than is necessary. After putting on the kettle, she should then proceed to the dining-room or parlour to get it in order for breakfast. She should first roll up the rug, take up the fender, shake and fold up the table- cloth, then sweep the room, carrying the dirt towards the fireplace ; a coarse cloth should then be laid down over the carpet, and she should proceed to clean the grate, having all her utensils close to her. When the grate is finished, the ashes cleared away, the hearth cleaned, and the fender put back in its place, she must dust the furniture, not omitting the legs of the tables and chairs; and if there are any ornaments or things on the sideboard, she must not dust round them, but lift them up on to another place, dust well where they have been standing, and then replace the things. Nothing annoj^s a particular mistress so much as to find, when she comes down stairs, different articles of furniture looking as if they had never been dusted. If the servant is at all methodical, and gets into a habit of doing a room in a certain Vv'ay, she will scarcely ever leave her duties neglected. After the rug is put down, the table-cloth arranged, and everything in order, she should lay the cloth for breakfast, and then shut the dining-room door. 2342. The hall must now be swept, the mats shaken, the door-step cleaned, and any brass knockers or handles polished up with the leather. If the family breakfast very early, the tidying of the hall must then be deferred till1002 HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT. after tliat meal. After cleaning the boots that are absolutely required, the servant should now wash her hands and face^ put on a clean white apron, and be ready for her mistress when she comes down stairs. In families where there is much work to do before breakfast, the master of the house frequently has two pairs of boots in wear, so that they may be properly cleaned when the servant has more time to do them, BLACKiNG-BRusH BOX. in the daytime. This arrangement is, per- iiaps, scarcely necessary in the summer-time, when there are no grates to clean every morning; but in the dark days of winter it is only kind and thoughtful to lighten a servant-of-all-work's duties as much as possible. 2343. She will now carry the urn into the dining-room, where her mistress will make the tea or coffee, and sometimes will boil the eggs, to insure them being done to her liking. In the mean time the servant cooks, if required, the bacon, kidneys, fish, &c. ;—if cold meat is to be served, she must always send it to table on a clean dish, and nicely garnished with tufts of parsley, if this is obtainable. 2344. After she has had her own breakfast, and whilst the family are finish- ing theirs, she should go upstairs into the bedrooms, open all the windows, strip the clothes off the beds, and leave them to air whilst she is clearing away the breakfast things. She should then take up the crumbs in a dustpan from unJer the table, put the chairs in their places, and sweep up the hearth. 2345. The breakfast things washed up, the kitchen should be tidied, so that it may be neat when her mistress comes in to give the orders for the day: after receiving these orders, the servant should go upstairs again, with a jug of boiling water, the slop-pail, and two cloths. After emptying the slops, and scalding the vessels with the boiling water, and wiping them thoroughly dry, she should wipe the top of the wash-table and arrange it all in order. She then proceeds to make the beds, in which occupation she is generally assisted by the mistress, or, if she have any daughters, by one of them. Before commencing to make the bed, the servant should put on a large bed-apron, kept for this purpose only, which should be made very wide, to button round the waist and meet behind, while it should be made as long as the dress. By adopting this plan, the blacks and dirt on servants' dresses (which at all times it is impossible to help) will not rub off on to the bed-clothes, mattresses, and bed furniture. "When the beds are made, the rooms should bo dusted, the stairs lightly swept down, hall furniture, closets, &c., dusted. The lady of the house, where there is but one servant kept, frequently takes charge of the drawing-room herself, that is to say, dusting it; the servant sweeping, cleaning windows, looking- glasses, grates, and rough work of that sort. If there are many ornaments and knick-knacks about the room, it is certainly better for the mistress to1003 DUTIES OF THE MAID-OF-ALL-WOP.K. dust these herself, as a maid-of-all-work's bands are not always in a condition to handle delicate ornaments. 2346. Now she has gone the rounds of the house and seen that all is in order, the servant goes to her kitchen to see about the cooking of the dinner, in which very often her mistress will assist her. She should put on a coarse apron with a bib to do her dirty work in, which may be easily replaced by a white one if required. 2347. Half an hour before dinner is ready, she should lay the cloth, that everything may be in readiness when she is dishing up the dinner, and take all into the dining-room that is likely to be required, in the way of knives, forks, spoons, bread, salt, water, &c. &c. By exercising a little forethought, much confusion and trouble may be saved both to mistress and servant, by getting everything ready for the dinner in good time. -2348. After taking in the dinner, when every one is seated, she removes the covers, hands the plates round, and pours out the beer ; and should be careful to hand everything on the left side of the person she is waiting on. 2349. We need scarcely say that a maid-of-all-work cannot stay in the dining-room during the whole of dinner-time, as she must dish up her pudding, or whatever is served after the first course. When she sees every one helped, she should leave the room to make her preparations for the next course ; and anything that is required, such as bread, &c., people may assist themselves to in the absence of the servant. 2350. When the dinner things are cleared away, the servant should sweep up the crumbs in the dining-room, sweep the hearth, and lightly dust the furniture, then sit down to her own dinner. 2351. After this, she washes up and puts away the dinner things, sweeps the kitchen, dusts and tidies it, and puts on the kettle for tea. She should now, before dressing herself for the afternoon, clean her knives, boots, and shoes, and do any other dirty work in the scullery that may be neces- sary. Knife-cleaning machines are rapidly taking the place, in most households, of the old knife-board. The saving of labour by the knife-cleaner is very great, and its performance of the work is very satisfactory. Small and large machines are manufactured, some cleaning only four knives, whilst others clean as many as knife-cleaning machine. twelve at once. Nothing can be more simple than the process of machine knife-cleaning ; and although, in a very limited household, the substitution of the machine for the board may not be necessary.1004 HOUSSnOTJ) MxVITAGEMENT. yet we sliould advise all housekeepers, to whom the outlay is not a difficultj-, to avail themselves of the services of a machine. We have already spoken of its management in the ^'Duties of the Footman," No. 2177. 2352. When the servant is dressed, she takes in the tea, and after tea turns Aown the beds, sees that the water-jugs and bottles are full, closes the windows, ftnd draws down the blinds. If the weather is very warm, these are usually left open until the last thing at night, to cool the rooms. 2353. The routine of a general servant's duties depends upon the khid of situation she occupies ; but a systematic maid-of-all-work should so contrive to divide her work, that every day in the week may have its proper share. By this means she is able to keep the house clean with less fatigue to herself than if she left all the cleaning to do at the end of the week. Sui:)posing there are five bedrooms in the house, two sitting-rooms, kitchen, scullery, and the usual domestic offices :—on Monday she should thoroughly clean the drawing- room ; on Tuesday, two of the bedrooms; on Wednesday, two more; on Thursday, the other bedroom and stairs; on Friday morning she should sweep the dining-room very thoroughly, clean the hall, and in the afternoon her kitchen tins and bright utensils. By arranging her work in this manner, no undue proportion will fall to Saturday's share, and she will then have this day for cleaning plate, cleaning her kitchen, and arranging everything in nice order. The regular work must, of course, be performed in the usual manner, as we have endeavoured to describe. 2354. Before retiring to bed, she will do well to clean up glasses, plates, &c. which have been used for the evening meal, and prepare for her morning's work by placing her wood near the fire, on the hob, to dr}', taking care there is no danger of it igniting, before she leaves the kitchen for the night. Before retiring, she will have to lock and bolt the doors, unless the master undertakes this office himself. 2355. If the washing, or even a portion of it, is done at home, it will be im- X^ossible for the m.aid-of-all-work to do her household duties thoroughly, daring the time it is about, unless she have some assistance. Usually, if all the washing is done at home, the mistress hires some one to assist at the wash-tub, and sees to little matters herself, in the way of dusting, clearing uv/ay breakfast things, folding, starching, and ironing the fine things. With a little management much can be accomplished, provided the mistress be in- dustrious, energetic, and willing to lend a helping hand. Let washing-week be not the excuse for having everything in a muddle ; and although '^things'* cannot be cleaned so thoroughly, and so much time spent upon them, as ordinarily, yet the house may be kept tidy and clear from litter without a great deal of exertion either on the part of the mistress or servant. We will conclude our remarks with an extract from an admirably-written book, called ** Home Truths for Home Peace." The authoress says, with respect to theDUTIES OP THE DAIRY-MAID. 1005 great wash—''Amongst all tlie occasions in which it is most .difficult and glorious to kcop muddle out of a family, ' the great wash' stands pre-eminent; and as very little money is now saved by having everything done at home, many ladies, with the option of taking another servant or putting out the chief part of the washing, have thankfully adopted the latter course." She goes on to say—"When a gentleman who dines at homo can't bear washing in the house, but gladly pays for its being done elsewhere, the lady should gratefully submit to his wishes, and put out anything in her whole estab- lishment rather than put out a good and generous husband." 2356. A bustling and active girl will always find time to do a little needle- work for herself, if she lives with consistent and reasonable people. In the summer evenings she should manage to sit down for two or three hours, and for a short time in the afternoon in leisure days. A general servant's duties are so multifarious, that unless she be quick and active, she will not be able to accomplish this. To discbarge these various duties properly is a difficult task, and sometimes a thankless office ; but it must be remembered that a good maid-of-all-work will make a good servant in any capacity, and may be safely taken not only without fear of failure, but with every probability of giving satisfaction to her emploj^er. DUTIES Q-W THS DAIBY-MAID. 2357. The duties of the dairy-maid differ considerably in different districts. In Scotland, Wales, and some of the northern counties, women milk the cows. On some of the large dairy farms in other parts of England, she takes her share in the milking, but in private families the milking is generally performed by the covv^keeper, and the dairy-maid only receives the milkpails from him morning and night, and empties and cleans them preparatory to the next milking; her duty being to supply the family with milk, cream, and butter, and other luxuries depending on the ''milky mothers" of the herd.' 235S. The Dairy.—The object with which gentlemen keep cows is to procure milk un- adulterated, and sweet butter, for themselves and families : in order to obtain tliis, however, great cleanliness is required, and as visitora, as well as the mistress of the house, sometimes visit the dairy, some efforts are usually made to render it ornamental and picturesque. The locality is usually fixed near to the house ; it should neither be exposed to the fierce heat of the summer's sun nor to the equally unfavourable frosts of winter—it must be both sheltered and shaded. If it is a building apart from the house and other offices, the walls should be tolerably thick, and if hollow, the temperature will be more equable. The walls inside are usually covered with Dutch glazed tiles; the flooring also of glazed tiles set in asphalte, to resist water; and the ceiling, lath ancl jplaster, or closely-jointed woodwork, painted. Its architecture will be a matter ot. fancy : it should have a northern aspect, and a thatched roof is considered most suitable, from the shade and shelter it affords; and it should contain at least two apartments, besides a cool place for storing away butter. One of the apartments, in which the milk is placed to deposit cream, or to ripen for churning, is usually surrounded by shelves of marble or slate, on which the milk-dishes rest; but it will be found a better plan to have a large square or round table of stone in the centre, with a water-tight ledge all round it, in which water may remain in hot weather, or, if some attempt at the picturesque100(J HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT. is desired, a small fountain might occupy the centre, which would keep the apartment cool and fresh. Eound this table the miik-dishes should be ranged ; one shelf, or dresser, of slate or marble, being kept for the various occupations of the dairy-maid : it will be found abetter plan than putting them on shelves and corners against the wall. There shoxild be a funnel or ventilator in the ceiling, communicating with the open air, made to open and shut as required. Double windows are recommended, but of the lattice kind, so that they may open, and with wire-gauze blinds fitted into the opening, and calico blinds, which may be wetted when additional coolness is required. The other .ipartment will be used for churning, washing, and scrubbing—in fact, the scullery of the dauy, with a boiler for hot water, and a sink with cold water laid on, which should be plentiful and good. In some dairies a third apartment, or, at least, a cool airy pantry, Is required for storing away butter, with shelves of marble or slate, to hold the cream-jars while it is ripening; and where cheeses are made, a fourth becomes necessary. The dairy utensils are not numerous,—churns, milk-pails for each cow, hair-sieves, slices of tin, milk-pans, marble dishes for cream for family use, scales and weights, a portable rack for drying the utensils, wooden howls, butter-moulds and butter-patters, and vjooden tubs for washing the utensils, comprising pretty nearly everything. 2359. Pails are made of maple-wood or elm, and hooped, or of tin, more or less or- namented. One is required for each cow. 2360. The Hair-Sieve is made of closely-twisted horse-hair, with a rim, through which the milk is strained to remove any hairs which may have dropped from the cow in milking. 2361. Milk-Dishes are shallow basins of glass, of glazed earthenware, or tin, about 16 inches in diameter at top, and 12 at the bottom, and 5 or 6 inches deep, holding about 8 to 10 quarts each when full. 2362. Churns are of all sorts and sizes, from that which chums 70 or 80 gallons by means of a strap from the engine, to the square box in which a pound of butter is made. The churn used for families is a square box, 18 inches by 12 or 13, and 17 deep, bevelled below to the plane of the dashers, with a loose lid or cover. The dasher consists of an axis of wood, to which the four beaters or fanners are attached; these fans are • simply four pieces of elm strongly dovetailed together, forming an oblong J. square, with a space left open, two of the openings being left broader than the y others ; attached to an axle, they form an axis with four projecting blades ; the ' axle fits into supports at the centre of the box; a handle is fitted to it, and the a«t of churning is done by turning the handle. 2363. Such is the temple in which the dairy-maid presides: it should be removed both from stable and cowhouse, and larder j no animal smells should come near it, and the drainage should be perfect. 2364. The dairy-maid receives the milk from the cowkeeper, each pail being strained through the hair sieve into one of the milk-basins. This is left in the basins from twenty-four to thirty-six hours in the summer, according to the weather ; after which it is skimmed off by means of the slicer, and poured into glazed earthenware jars to "turn" for churning. Some persons prefer making up a separate churning for the milk of each cow ; in which there is some advantage. In this case the basins of each cow, for two days, would either be kept together or labelled. As soon as emptied, the pails should be scalded and every particle of milk washed out, and placed away in a dry place till next required ; and all milk spilt on the floor, or on the table or dresser, cleaned up with a cloth and hot water. "Where very great attention is paid to the dairy, the milk-coolers are used larger in winter, when it is desirable to retard the cooling down and increase the creamy deposit, and smaller in summer, to hasten it; the temperature required being from 55° to 50°. In summer it is sometimes expedient, in very sultry weather, to keep the dairy fresh and cool by suspending cloths dipped in chloride of lime across the room.1007 DUTIES OP THE DAIRY-MAID. -2365. In some dairies it is usual to churn twice, and in others three times a week : the former produces the best butter, the other the greatest quantity. With three cows, the produce should be 27 to 30 quarts a day. The dairy-maid should churn every day when very hot, if they are in full milk, and every second day in more temperate weather; besides supplying the milk and cream required for a large establishment. The churning should always be done in the morning : the dairy-maid will find it advantageous in being at work on churning mornings by five o'clock. The operation occupies from 20 minutes to half an hour in summer, and considerably longer in winter. A steady uniform motion is necessary to produce sweet butter; neither too quick nor too slow. Rapid motion causes the cream to heave and swell, from too much air being forced into it: the result is a tedious churning, and soft, bad-coloured butter. 2366. In spring and summer, when the cow has her natural food, no artificial colour is requii^ed ; but in winter, under stall-feeding, the colour is white and tallowy, and some persons prefer a higher colour. This is communi- cated by mixing a little finely-powdered arnotto with the cream before putting it into the churn ; a still more natural and delicate colour is communicated by scraping a red carrot into a clean piece of linen cloth, dipping it into water, and squeezing it into the cream. 2367. As soon as the butter comes, the milk is poured off, and the butter put into a shallow wooden tub or bowl, full of pure spring water, in which it is washed and kneaded, pouring off" the water, and renewing it until it comes away perfectly free from milk. Imperfect washing is the frequent cause of bad butter, and in nothing is the skill of the dairy-maid tested more than in this process ; moreover, it is one in which cleanliness of habits and person are most necessary. In this operation we want the aid of Phyllis's neat, soft, and perfectly clean hand ; for no mechanical operation can so well squeeze out the sour particles of milk or curd. 2368. The operations of churning and butter-making over, the butter-milk is disposed of: usually, in England, it goes to the pigs; but it is a very wholesome beverage when fresh, and some persons like it; the disposal, therefore, will rest with the mistress : the dairy-maid's duty is to get rid of it. She must then scald with boiling water and scrub out every utensil she has used; brush out the churn, clean out the cream-jars, which will probably require the use of a little common soda to purify; wipe all dry, and place them in a position where the sun can reach them for a short time, to sweete» them. 2369. In Devonshire, celebrated for its dairy system, the milk is always scalded. The milk-pans, which are of tin, and contain from 10 to 13 quarts, after standing 10 or 13 hours, are placed on a hot plate of iron, over a stove, until the cream has formed on the_ surface, which is indicated by the air-bubbles rising through the milk, and producing blisters on the surface-coating of cream. This indicates its approach to the boiling point: and the vessel is now removed to cool. When sufficiently, that is, quiteHOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT. 1003 cool, the cream is skimmed off with the slice : it is now the clouted cream for which Devonshire is so famous. It is now placed in the churn, and churned until the butter comes, which it generally does in a much shorter time than by the other process. The butter so made contains more caseine than butter made in the usual way, but does not keep so long. 0370. It is a question frequently discussed, how far it is economical for families to keep cows and make their own butter. It is calculated that a good C0V7 costs from May 1 to October 1, when well but economically kept, £0. IC5. Qd.; and from October 1 to April 30, £10. 2^. Qd. During that timo she should produce 227 lbs. of butter, besides the skimmed milk. Of course, if new milk and cream are required, that will diminish the quantity of butter. 2371. Besides churning and keeping her dairy in order, the dairy-maid has charge of the whole produce, handing it over to the cook, butler, or house- maid as required ; and she will do well to keep an exact account both of what she receives and how and when she disposes of it. DTTTIES OF THE IiAU]SrDBY--MAID. 2372. The laundry-maid is charged with the duty of washing and getting-up the family linen,—a situation of great importance where the washing is all done at home ; but in large towns, where there is little convenience for bleaching and drying, it is chiefly done by professional laundresses and companies, who apply mechanical and chemical processes to the purpose. These processes, however, are supposed to injure the fabric of the linen ; and in many families the fine linen, cottons, and muslins, are washed and got-up at home, even where the bulk of the washing is given out. In country and suburban houses, where greater conveniences exist, washing at home is more common,—in country places universal. 2373. The laundry establishment consists of a washing-house, an ironing and drying-room, and sometimes a drying-closet heated by furnaces. The washing-house will probably be attached to the kitchen ; but it is better that it should be completely detached from it, and of one story, with a funnel or shaft to carry off the steam. It will be of a size proportioned to the extent of the washing to be done. A range of tubs, either round or oblong, opposite to, and sloping towards, the light, narrower at the bottom than the top, for convenience in stooiDing over, and fixed at a height suited to the convenienco of the women using them ; each tub having a tap for hot and cold water, and another in the bottom, communicating with the drains, for drawing off foul water. A boiler and furnace, proportioned in size to the wants of the family, should also be fixed. The flooring should be York stone, laid on brick piers, with good drainage, or asx)halte^ sloping gently towards a gutter connected with the drain.1009 DUTIES or THE LAUNDRT-MAID. 2374. Adjoining the bleaching-house, a second room, about the same size, is required for ironing, drying, and mangling. The contents of this room should comprise an ironing-board, opposite to the light; a strong "white deal table, about twelve or fourteen feet long, and about three and a half feet broad, \yith drawers for ironing-blankets ; a mangle in one corner, and clothes-horses for drying and airing ; cupboards for holding the various irons, starch, and other arfcicles used in ironing ; a hot-plate built in the chimney, with furnace be- neath it for heating the irons; sometimes arranged with a flue for carrying the hot air round the room for drying. Where this is the case, however, thero should be a funnel in the ceiling for ventilation and carrying off steam ; but a better arrangement Is to have a hot-air closet adjoining, heated by hot-air pipes, and lined with iron, with proper arrangements for carrying off steam, and clothes-horses on castors running in grooves, to run into it jfor drying purposes. This leaves the laundry free from unwholesome vapour. 2375. The laundry-maid should commence her labours on Monday morning by a careful examination of the articles committed to her care, and enter them in the washing-book ; separating the white linen and collars, sheets and body- linen, into one heap, fine muslins into another, coloured cotton and linen fabrics into a third, woollens into a fourth, and the coarser kitchen and other greasy cloths into a fifth. Every article should be examined for ink- or grease-spots, or for fruit- or wine-stains. Ink-spots are removed by dipping the part into hot water, and then spreading it smoothly on the hand or on the back of a spoon, pouring a few drops of oxalic acid or salts of sorel over the ink-spot, rubbing and rinsing it in co^d water- till removed ; grease-spots, by rubbing over with' yellow soap, and rinsing in hot water ; fruit- and wine-spots, by dipping in a solution of sal ammonia or spirits of wine, and rinsing. 2376. Every article having been examined and assorted, the sheets and fine linen should be placed in one of the tubs and just covered with lukewarm water, in which a little soda has been dissolved and mixed, and left there to soak till the morning. The greasy cloths and dirtier things should be laid to soak in another tub, in a liquor composed of | lb. of unslaked lime to every 6 quarts of water which has been boiled for two hours, then left to settle, and strained off when clear. Each article should be rinsed in this liquor to wet it tho- roughly, and left to soak till the morning, just covered by it when the things are pressed together. Coppers and boilers should now be filled, and the fires laid ready to light. 2377. Early on the following morning the fires should be lighted, and as soon as hot water can be procured, washing commenced; the sheets and body-hnen being wanted to whiten in the morning, should be taken first; each article being removed in succession from the lye in w^hich it has been soaking, rinsed, rubbed, and wrung,, and laid aside until the tub is empty, when the foul water is drawn off. The tub should be again filled with luke- warm water, about 80% in which the articles should again be plunged, and 3 T1010 HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT, each gone over carefully with soap, and rubbed. Novices in the art sometimes rub the hnen against the skin ; more experienced washerwomen rub one linen surface against the other, which saves th^ir hands, and enables them to con- ' tinue their labour much, longer, besides economizing time, two parts being thus cleaned at once. 2378. After this first washing, the linen should be put into a second -water as hot as the hand can bear^ and again rubbed over in every part, examining every part for spots not yet moved, which require to be again soaped over and rubbed till thoroughly clean; then rinsed and wrung, the larger and stronger articles by two of the women; the smaller and more delicate articles requiring gentler treatment. 2379. In order to remove every particle of soap, and produce a goo4 colour, they should now bo placed, and boiled for about an hour and a half in the copper, in which soda, in the proportion of a teaspoonful to every two gallons 4)f water, has been dissolved. Some very careful laundresses put the linen into a canvas bag to i3rotect it from the scum and the sides of the copper.. When taken out, it should again be rinsed, first in clean hot water, and then in abuu- danco of cold water slightly; tinged with fig-blue, and again wrung dry. It should now be remoYed from the washing-house and hung up to dry or spread out to bleach, if there are conveniences for it; and the earlier in the-day this is done, the clearer and whiter-wdll be the linen. 2380. Colom-ed muslins, cottons; and linens, require a milder treatment; . any application of soda wall discharge the colour, and soaking all night, even in pure "vvater, deteriorates the more delicate tints. When ready for • washing, if not too dirty, they should be put into cold water and washed very speedily, using- the common yellow soap, w^hich should be rinsed off imme* diately. One article should be washed at a time, and rinsed out immediately before any others are wetted. When washed thoroughly, they should be rinsed in succession^ in soft water, in which common salt has been dissolved, in the proportion of a handful to three or four gallons, 'and afterwards wrung gently, as soon as rinsed, with as little twisting as possible, and then hung out to clr3^ Delicate-coloured articles should not be exposed to tho sun, but dried in the shade, using clean lines and wooden pegs. 2381. Woollen articles are liable to shrink, unless the flannel has been well shrunk before making up. This liability is increased where very hot water is used : cold water would thus be the best to wash woollens in ; but, as ithis would not remove the dirt, lukewarm water, about 85", and yellow soap, are recommended. When thoroughly washed in this, they requhe a good-deal of rinsing in cold water, to remove the soap. • .. 2382.

When taken out, they should be rinsed in cold water, and laid out or hung up to dry. 2383. Silk handkerchiefs require to be washed alone. When they contain snuff; they should be soaked by themselves in lukewarm water two or three hours; they should be rinsed out and put to soak with the others in cold crater for an hour or two; then washed in lukewarm water, being soaped as they are washed. If this does not remove all stains, they should be washed a SGCond time in similar water, and, when finished, rinsed in soft water in which a handful of cdmmon salt has been dissolved. In washing stuff or woollen dresses, the band at the waist and the lining at the bottom should be removed, and.wherever it is gathered into folds; and, in furniture, the hems and gatherings. A black silk dress, if very dirty, must "be washed; but, if only soiled, soaking for four-and-twenty hours will do ; if old and rustj, a pint of common spirits should be mixed with each gallon of water, which is an i'.npx'ovement under a^iy circumstances. AVhether soaked or washed, it should be hung up to drain, and dried without wringing. 2384. Satin and silk ribbons, both white and coloured, may* be cleaned in the same manner. 2385. Silks, when washed, should be dried in the shade, on a linen-horse, taking care that they are kept smooth and unwrinkled. If black or blue, they will be improved if laid again on the table, when dry, and sponged with gin, , or v/hiskey, or other white spirit. 2386. The operations should be concluded by rinsing the tubs, cleaning the coppers, scrubbing the floors of the washing-house, and restoring everything to order and cleanliness. 23S7. Thursday and . Friday, in a laundry in full employ, are usually devoted to mangling, starching, and ironing. 2388. Linen, cotton, and other fabrics, after being washed and dried, are made smooth and glossy by mangling and by ironing. The mangling process, which is simply passing them between rollers subjected to a very considerable pressure, produced by weight, is confined to sheets, towels, table-linen, and similar articles, which are without folds or plaits. Ironing is necessary to smooth body-linen, and made-up articles of delicate texture or gathered into folds. The mangle is too well known to need descr.'ption. 2389. Jro»%.—The irons cor.sist of the common flat-iron, which is of cUfferent sizes, Tarj.ing from 4 to 10 inches in length, triangular in form, and from 2^ to 4^ inches iu'svidth at the broad end; the oval iron, vihich is used for more delicate articleg j and the box-iron, which is hollow, and heated by.a red-hot iron inserted into the box. The ItaUan iron is a hollow tube, smooth on the outside, and raised on a slender pedestiil with a.footstalk. Into the hollow cylinder a red-hot iron is pushed, which heats it; and 3 T 2HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT. 1012 the smooth outside of the latter is used, on which articles such as frills, and plaited articles, are drawn. Crimping- and gauffering-machines are used for a kind of plaiting \vhere much regularity is recjuired, the articles bein^ passed through two iron rollers fluted so as to represent the kind of plait or fold required. 2390. Starching is a process by which stiffness is communicated to certain parts of linen, as the collar and front of shirts, by dipping them in a paste. made of starch boiled in water, mixed with a little gum Arabic, where extra stiffness is required. To make Starcli. 2391. Ingredients.—Allow J pint of cold water and 1 quart of boiling- water to every 2 tablespoonfuls of starch. Mode,—Put the starch into a tolerably large basin; pour over it the cold water, and stir the mixture well with a wooden spoon until it is perfectly free from lumps, and quite smooth. Then take the basin to the fire, and whilst the water is actually loiling in the kettle or boiler, pour it over the starch, stirring it the whole time. If made properly in this manner, the starch will require no further boiling ; but should the water not be boiling when added to the starch, it will not thicken, and must be put into a clean saucepan, and stirred over the fire until it boils. Take it off the fire, strain it into a clean basin, cover it up to prevent a skin forming on the top, and, when sufficiently cool that the hand may be borne in it, starch the things. Many persons, to give a shiny and smooth appearance to the linen when ironed, stir round two or three times in the starch a piece of wax candle, which also prevents the iron from sticking. 2392. When the "things to be starched" are washed, dried, and taken oft" the lines, they should be dipped into the hot starch made as directed, squeezed out of it, and then just dipped into cold water, and immediately squeezed dry. If fine things be wrung, or roughly used, they are very liable to tear ; so too much care cannot be exercised in this respect. If the article is lace, clap it between the hands a few times, which will assist to clear it; then have ready laid out on the table a large clean towel or cloth ; shake out the starched things, lay them on the cloth, and roll it up tightly, and let it remain for three or fours, when the things will be ready to iron. 7393. To be able to iron properly requires much practice and experience. Strict cleanliness with all the ironing utensils must be observed, as, if this is not the case, not the most expert ironer will be able to make her things look clear and free from smears^ &c. After wiping down her ironing-table, the laimdry-maid should place a coarse cloth on it, and over that the ironing- blanket, with her stand and iron-rubber; and having ascertained that her irons are quite clean and of the right heat, she proceeds with her work. -2394. It is a good plan to try the heat of the iron on a coarse cloth or apron before ironing anything fine: there is then no danger of scorching. For ironing fine things, such as collars^ cuffs, muslins, and laces, there is nothingDUTIES OF THE KURSIiMAID. 1013 SO clean and nice to use as the box-iron ; the bottom being bright, and never placed near the fire, it is always perfectly clean ; it should, however, bo kept in a dry place, for fear of its rusting. Gauffcring-tongs or irons must bo placed in a clear fire for a minute, then withdrawn, wiped with a coarse rubber, and the heat of them tried on a piece of paper, as, unless great caro is taken, these will very soon scorch. 2395. The skirts of muslin dresses should be ironed on a skirt-board covered •with flannel, and the fronts of shirts on a smaller board, also covered with flannel; this board being placed between the back and front. 2396. After things are mangled, they should also be ironed in the folds and gathers ; dinner-napkins smoothed over, as also table-cloths, pillow-cases, and sometimes sheets. The bands of flannel petticoats, and shoulder-straps to flannel waistcoats, must also undergo the same x^rocess. UPPER AND TJNDER NUBSEMAIDS. 2397. The nursery is of great importance in every family, and in families of distinction, where there are several young children, it is an establishment kept apart from the rest of the family, under the charge of an upper nurse, assisted by under nursery-maids proportioned to the work to be done. The responsible duties of npper nursemaid commence with the weaning of the child : it must now be separated from the mother or wet-nurse, at least for a time, and the cares of the nursemaid, -which have hitherto been only occasionally put in requisition, are now to be entirely devoted to the infant, "She washes, dresses, and feeds it; walks out with it, and regulates all its little wants ; and, even at this early age, many good qualities are required to do so in a satisfactory manner. Patience and good temper are indispensable qualities; truthfulness, purity of manners, minute cleanliness, and docility and obedience, almost equally so. She ought also to be acquainted with the art of ironing and trimming little caps, and be handy with her needle. 2398. There is a considerable art in carrying an infant comfortably for itself and for the nursemaid. If she carry it always seated upright on her arm, and presses it too closely against her chest, the stomach of the child is apt to get compressed, and the back fatigued. For her own comfort, a good nurse will frequently vary this position, by changing from one arm to the other, and sometimes by laying it across both, raising the head a little. When teaching it to walk, and guiding it by the hand, she should change the hand from time to time, so as to avoid raising one shoulder higher than the other. This is the only way in which a child should be taught to walk; leading-strings and other foolish inventions, which force an infant to make efforts, ^vith its shoulders and head forward, before it knows how to use its hmbs, will only render it feeble, and retard its progress. 2399. Most children have some bad habit, of which they must be broken; but this 13 never accomplished by harshness without developing worse evils: kindness, perseverance, and patience m the nurse, are here of the utmost importance. When fmger-sucldcg is one of these habits, the fingers are sometimes rubbed with bitter aloes, or some equally dis- agreeable substance. Others have dirty habits, which are only to be changed by patience.1014 HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT. perseverance, and, above all, by regularity in tbe nurse. She should never be permitted to inflict punishment on these occasions, or, indeed, on any occasion. But, if punish- ment is to be avoided, it is still moi-e necessary that all kinds of indulgences and flattery be equally forbidden. Yielding to all the whims of a child,—picking up its toys when thrown away in mere wantonness, would be intolerable. A child should never be led to think others inferior to it, to beat a dog, or even the stone against which it falls, as some children are taught to do by silly nurses. I-Teither should the nurse affect or show alarm at any of the little accidents Avhich must inevitably happen : if it falls, treat it as a trifle; otherwise she encourages a spirit of cowardice and timidity. But she will take care that such accidents are not of frequent occurrence, or the result of neglect. 2400. The nurse should keep the child as clean as possible, and particularly she should train it to habits of cleanliness, so that it should feel uncomfortable when otherwise; watching especially that it does not soil itself in eating. At the same time, vanity in its personal appearance is not to be encouraged by over-care in this respect, or by too tight lacing or buttoning of dresses, nor a small foot cultivated by the use of tight shoes. 2101. N'ursemaids would do well to repeat to the parents faithfully and truly the defects they observe in the dispositions of very young children. If properly checked in time, evil propensities may be eradicated; but this should not extend to anything but serious defects; otherwise, the intuitive perceptions which all children possess will con- strue the act into " spying " and " informing," which should never be resorted to in the case of children, nor, indeed, in any case. 2402. Such are the cares which devolve upon the nursemaid, and it is her duty to fulfil them personally. In large establishments she will have assistants proportioned to the number of children of which she has the care. The under nursemaid lights the fires, sweeps, scours, and dusts the rooms, and makes the beds; empties slops, and carries up water; brings up and removes the nursery meals; washes and dresses all the children, except the infant, and assists in mending. Where there is a nursery girl to assist, she does the rougher part of the cleaning; and all take their meals in the nursery together, after the children of the family have done. 2403. In smaller families, where there is only one nursemaid kept, she is assisted by the housemaid, or servant-of-all-work, who will do the rougher part of the work, and carry up the nursery meals. In such circumstances she will be more immediately under the eye of her mistress, who will probably relieve her from some of the cares of the infant. In higher families, the upper nurse is usually permitted to sup or dine occasionally at the housekeeper's table by way of relaxation, when the children are all well, and her subordinates trustworthy, 2404. Where the nurse has the entire charge of the nursery, and the mother is too much occupied to do more than pay a daily visit to it, it is desirable that she be a person of observation, and possess some acquaintance with the diseases incident to childhood, as also with such simple remedies as may be useful before a medical attendant can be procured, or where such attendance is not considered necessary. All these little ailments are preceded by symp- toms so minute as to be only perceptible to close observation; such as twitching of the brows, restless sleep, grinding the gums, and, in some inflammatory diseases, even to the child abstaining from crying, from fear of the increased pain produced by the movement. Dentition, or cutting the teeth, is attended1015 DUTIES OF THE NURSEMAID. with many of tliese symptoms. Measles, thrush, scarlatina, cronp, hooi^ing- congh, and other childish complaints, are all preceded by well-known symp- toms, which m.ay be alleviated and rendered less virulent by simple remedies instantaneously aiDplied. 2405. Dentition is usually the first serious trouble, bringing many other disorders in its train. The symptoms are most perceptible to the mother : the child sucks feebly, and with gums hot, inflamed, and swollen. In this case, relief is yielded by rubbing them from time to time with a little of Mrs. Johnson's soothing syrup, a valuable and perfectly safe medicine. Selfish and thought- less nurses, and mothers too, sometimes give cordials and sleeping-draughts, whose effects are too well known. 2406. Conviilsion Fits sometimes follow the feverish restlessness produced by these causes ; in which case a hot bath should be administered without delay, and the lower parts of the body rubbed, the bath being as hot as it can be without scalding the tender skin ; at the same time, the doctor should be sent for immediately, for no nurse should administer medicine in this case, unless the fits have been repeated and the doctor has left directions with her how to act. 2407. Croup is one of the most alarming diseases of childhood ; it is acconi- panied with a hoarse, croaking, ringing cough, and comes on very suddenly, and most so in strong, robust children. A yeicj hot bath should be instantly administered, followed by an emetic, either in the form of tartar-emetic, croup- powder, or a teaspoonful of ipecacuhana, wrapping the body warmly up in flannel after the bath. The slightest delay in administeriDg the bath, or the emetic, may be fatal; hence, the importance of nurses about very young children being acquainted with the symptoms. 2408. Hooping-Cough is generally preceded by the moaning noise during sleep, which even adults threatened with the disorder cannot avoid : it is fol- lowed by violent fits of coughing, which little can be done to relieve. A child attacked by this disorder should be kept as much as possible in the fresh, pui'e air, but out of draughts, and kept warm, and supplied with plenty of nourishing food. Many fatal diseases flow from this scourge of childhood, and a change to purer air, if possible, should follow convalescence. 2409. Worms are the torment of some children: the symptoms are, an unnatural craving for food, even after a full m^eal; costiveness, suddenly fol- lowed by the reverse ; fetid breath, a livid circle under the ej^es, enlarged abdomen, and picking the nose; for which the remedies must be prescribed by the doctor. 2410. Measles and Scarlatina much resemble each other in their early stages: headache, restlessness, and fretfulness are the symptoms of both.1016 HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT. Shivering fits, succeeded by a hot skin ; pains in the back and limbs, accom- panied by sickness, and, in severe cases, sore throat; pain about the jaws, difficulty in swallowing, running at the eyes, which become red and inflamed, while the face is hot and flushed, often distinguish scarlatina and scarlet fever, of which it is only a mild form. 2411. While the case is doubtful, a dessert-spoonful of spirit of nitre diluted in water, given at bedtime, will throw the child into a gentle perspiration, and will bring out the rash in either case. In measles, this appears first on the face ; in scarlatina, on the chest; and in both cases a doctor should be^ called in. In scarlatina, tartar-emetic powder or ipecacuhana may be admi- nistered in the mean time. 2412. In all cases, cleanliness, fresh air, clean utensils, and frequent washing of the person, both of nurse and children, are even more necessary in the- nursery than in either drawing-room or sick-room, inasmuch as the delicate organs of childhood are more susceptible of injury from smells and vapours- than adults. 2413. It may not be out of place if we conclude this brief notice of the duties of a nursemaid, by an extract from Florence Nightingale's admirable ''Notes on Nursing." Referring to children, she says :— 2114. "They are much more susceptible than grown people to all noxious influences. They are affected by the same things, but much more quickly and seriously; by want of fresh air, of proper warmth; want of cleanliness in house, clothes, bedding, or body ; by improper food, want of punctuality, by dulness, by want of light, by too much or too little covering in bed or when up." And all this in health; and then she quotes a passage from a lecture on sudden deaths in infancy, to show the importance of careful nursing of children:—'* In the great majority of instances, when death suddenly befalls the infant or young child, it is an accident; it is not a necessary, inevitable result of any disease. That which is known to injure children most seriously is foul air; keeping tha rooms where they sleep closely shut up is destruction to them; and, if the child's breathing be disordered by disease, a few hours only of such foul air may endanger its life, even where no inconvenience is felt by grown-up persons in the room." 2415. Persons moving in the best society will see, after perusing Miss Nightingale's book, that this "foul air," **want of light," "too much or too little clothing," and improper food, is not confined to Crown Street or St. Giles's; that Belgravia and the squares have their north room, where the rays of the sun never reach. " A wooden bedstead, two or three mattresses piled up to above the height of the table, a vallanc© attached to the frame,—nothing but a miracle could ever thoroughly dry or air such a bed and bedding,"—is the ordinary bed of a private house, than which nothing can be more unwholesome. "Don't treat your children like sick," she sums up ; " don't dose them with tea. Let them eat meat and drink milk, or half a glass of light beer. Give them fresh, light, sunny, and open rooms, cool bedrooms, plenty of outdoor exercise, facing even the cold, and wind, and weather, in sufficiently warm clothes, and with sufficient exercise, plenty of amusements and play; more liberty, and less schooling, and cramming, and training; more attention to food and less to physic."1017 DUTIES OF THE SICK-NURSE. 2416. All women are likely, at some period of their lives, to be called on to perform the duties of a sick-nurse, and should prepare themselves as much as possible, by observation and reading-, for the occasion when they may bo required to perform the office. The main requirements are good temper, compassion for suffering, sympath}^ with sufferers, which most women worthy of the name possess, neat-handedness, quiet manners, love of order, and clean- liness. With these qualifications there will be very little to be wished for ; the desire to relieve suffering will inspire a thousand little attentions, and surmount the disgusts which some of the offices attending the sick-room are apt to create. Where serious illness visits a household, and protracted nursing is likely to become necessary, a professional nurse will probably bo engaged,, who has been trained to its duties ; but in some families, and those not a few let us hope, the ladies of the family would oppose such an arrangement as a failure of duty on their part. There is, besides, even when a professional nurse is ultimately called in, a i)eriod of doubt and hesitation, while disease has not yet developed itself, when the patient must be attended to ; and, in these cases, some of the female servants of the establishment must give their attendance in the sick-room. There are, also, slight attacks of cold, influenza, and accidents in a thousand forms, to which all are subject, where domestic nursing becomes a necessity ; where disease, though unattended with danger,, is nevertheless accompanied by the nervous irritation incident to illness, and when all the attention of the domestic nurse becomes necessary. 2417. In the first stage of sickness, while doubt and a little perplexity hang over the household as to the nature of the sickness, there are some things about which no doubt can exist: the patient's room must be kept in a perfectly pure state, and arrangements made for proper attendance ; for the first canon of nursing, according to Florence Nightingale, its apostle, is to 'Hceep the air the patient breathes as pure as the external air, without chilling him." This can be done without any preparation v/hich might alarm the patient; with proper windows, open fireplaces, and a supjjly of fuel, the room may be a& fresh as it is outside, and kept at a temperature suitable for the patient's, state. 241S. Windows, however, must be opened from above, and not from below, and draughts avoided; cool air admitted beneath the patient's head chillsf the lower strata and the floor. The careful nurse will keep the door shut when the window is open; she will also take care that the patient is not placed between the door and the open window, nor between the open fireplace and the window. If confined to bed, she will see that the bed is placed in a thoroughly ventilated part of the room, but out of the current of air which is produced by the momentary opening of doors^ as well as out of the line ofHOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT. 1018 draught between the window and the open chimney, and that the temperature of the room is kept about 61°. Where it is necessary to admit air by the door, the windows should be closed ; but there are few circumstances in which good air can be obtained through the chamber-door; through it, on the contrary, the gases generated in the lower parts of the house are likely to be drawn into the invalid chamber. 2419. These precautions taken, and plain nourishing diet, such as the patient desires, furnished, probably little more can be done, unless more seriou* sj^mptoms present themselves; in which case medical advice will be sought. 2420. Under no circumstances is ventilation of the sick-room so essential as in cases of febrile diseases, usually considered infectious ; such as typhus and puerperal fevers, influenza, hooping-cough, small- and chicken-pox, scarlet fever, measles, and erysipelas : all these are considered communicable through the air ; but there is little danger of infection being thus communicated, pro- vided the room is kept thoroughly ventilated. On the contrary, if this essen- tial be neglected, the power of infection is greatly increased and concentrated in the confined and impure air ; it settles upon the clothes of the attendants and visitors, especially where they are of wool, and is frequently commu- nicated to other families in this manner. 2421. Under all circumstances, therefore, the sick-room should be kept as fresh and sweet as the open air, while the temperature is kept up by artificial heat, taking care that the fire burns clear, and gives out no smoke into the room ; that the room is perfectly clean, wiped over with a damp cloth every day, if boarded; and swept, after sprinkling with damp tea-leaves, or other aromatic leaves, if carpeted; that all utensils are emptied and cleaned as soon as used, and not once in four-and-twenty hours, as is some- times done. ''A slop-pail," Miss Nightingale says, should never enter a sick-room; ever\^thing should be carried direct to the water-closet, emptied there, and brought up clean ; in the best hospitals the slop-pail is unknown." " I do not approve," says Miss Nightingale, " of making housemaids of nurses, —that would be waste of means; but I have seen surgical sisters, women whose hands were worth to them two or three guineas a week, down on their knees, scouring a room or hut, because they thought it was not fit for their patients : these women had the true nurse spirit." 2422. Bad smells are sometimes met by sprinkling a little liquid chloride of limo on the floor; fumigation by burning pastiles is also a common expedient for the purification of the sick-room. They are useful, but only in the sense hinted at by the medical lecturer, who commenced his lecture thus :—Fumi- gations, gentlemen, are of essential importance ; they make so abominable a smell, that they compel you to open the windows and admit fresh air." In this sense they are useful, but ineffectual unless the cause be removed, and fresh air admitted.1010 DUTIES OF THE SICK-^•UI^SE. 2423. The sick-room should le quiet; no talking, no gossiping, and, above all, no whispering,—this is absolute cruelty to the patient; he thinks his complaint the subject, and strains his ear painfully to catch the sound. Xo rustling of dresses, nor creaking shoes either; where the carpets are taken up, the nurse should wear list shoes, or some other noiseless material, and her dress should be of soft material that does not rustle. Miss Nightingale denounces crinoline, and quotes Lord Melbourne on the subject of women in the sick-room, who said, "I would rather have men about me, when ill, than women ; it requires very strong health to put up with women." Un- grateful man ! but absolute quiet is necessary in the sick-room. 2424. Never let the patient be waked out of his first sleep b}^ noise, never roused by anything like a surprise. Always sit in the apartment, so that the patient has you in view, and that it is not necessary for him to turn in speak- ing to you. Never keep a patient standing ; never speak to one while moving. Never lean on the sick-bed. Above all, be calm and decisive with the patient, and prevent all noises over-head. 2425. A careful nurse, when a patient leaves his bed, will open the sheets wide, and throw the clothes back so as thoroughly to air the bed. She will avoid drying or airing anything damp in the sick-room. 2426. "It is another fallacy," says Florence Nightingale, "to suppose that night air is injurious ; a great authority told me that, in London, the air is never so good as after ten o'clock, when smoke has diminished; but then it must be air from without, not within, and not air vitiated by gaseous airs." ^* A great fallacy prevails also," she says, in another section, "about flowers poisoning the air of the sick-room: no one ever saw them over-crowding the sick-room; but, if they did, they actually absorb carbonic acid and give off oxygen." Cut flowers also decompose water, and produce oxygen gas. Lilies, and some other very odorous plants, may perhaps give cfut smells unsuited to a close room, while the atmosphere of the sick-room should always be fresh and natural. 2427. "Patients," says Miss Nighting-ale, "are sometimes starved in the midst of plenty, from want of attention to the ways which alone make it possible for them to take food. A spoonful of beef-tea, or arrowroot and wine, or some other light nourishing diet, should be given every hour, for the patient's stomach will reject large supplies. In very weak patients there is often a nervous difficulty in swallowing, which is much increased if food is not ready and presented at the moment w^hen it is wanted : the nurse should be able to discriminate, and know when this moment is approaching." 2428. Diet suitable for patients will depend, in some degree, on their natural likes and dislikes, which the nurse will do well to acquaint herself with. Beef-tea is useful and relishing, but possesses little nourishment; when evaporated, it presents a teaspoonful of solid meat to a pint of water. EggsHOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT. 1020 are not equivalent to the same weight of meat. Arrowroot is less nourishing than flour. Butter is the lightest and most digestible kind of fat. Cream, in >some diseases, cannot be replaced. But, to sum up with some of Miss Nightingale's useful maxims :—Observation is the nurse's best guide, and the patient's appetite the rule. Half a pint of milk is equal to a quarter of a pound of meat. Beef-tea is the least nourishing food administered to the sick; and tea and coffee, she thinks, are both too much excluded from tlio sick-room. THE MONTHLY NUBSE. -2429. The choice of a monthly nurse is of the utmost importance; and in the case of a young mother with her first child, it would be well for her to seek advice and counsel from her more experienced relatives in this matter. In the first.place, the engaging a monthly nurse in good time is of the utmost importance, as, if she be competent and clever, her services will be sought months beforehand ; a good nurse having seldom much of her time disengaged. There are some qualifications which it is evident the nurse should possess: she should be scrupulously clean and tidy in her person; honest, sober, and noiseless in her movements; should iDossess a natural love for children, and have a strong nerve in case of emergencies. Snuff-taking and spirit- drinking must not be included in her habits; but these are happily mucli less frequent than they were in former days. 2430. Receiving, as she often will, instructions from the doctor, she should bear these in mind, and carefully carry them out. In those instances where she does not feel herself sufficiently informed, she should ask advice from the medical man, and not take upon herself to administer medicines, &c., without his knowledge. 2431. A monthly nurse should be between 30 and 50 years of age, sufficiently t3ld to have had a little experience, and yet not too old or infirm to be able to perform various duties requiring strength and bodily vigour. She should be able to wake the moment she is called,—at any hour of the night, that the mother or child may have their wants immediately attended to. Good tem- per, united to a kind and gentle disposition, is indispensable ; and, although the nurse will frequently have much to endure from the whims and caprices of the invalid, she should make allowances for these, and command her temper, at the same time exerting her authority when it is necessary. 2432. What the nurse has to do in the way of cleaning and dusting her lady's room, depends entirely on the establishment that is kept. Where there are plenty of servants, the nurse, of course, has nothing whatever to do but attend on lier patient, and ring the bell for anything she may require. Where the number of domestics is hmited, she should not mind keeping her room in order; that is to say, sweeping and dusting it every morning. IfDUTIES OP THE MONTHLY KURSE. 1021 fires be necessary, tlie housemaid should always clean the grate, and do all that is wanted in that way, as this, being rather dirty work, would soil tlio nurse's dress, and unfit her to approach the bed, or take the infant without soiling its clothes. In small establishments, too, the nurse should herself fetch things she may require, and not ring every time she wants anything ; and she must, of course, not leave her invalid unless she sees everything is comfortable ; and then only for a few minutes. When down stairs, and in company with the other servants, the nurse should not repeat what she may have heard in her lady's room, as much mischief may be done by a gossiping nurse. As in most houses the monthly nurse is usually sent for a few days before her services may be required, she should see that all is in readiness ; that there be no bustle and hurry at the time the confinement takes place. She should keep two pairs of sheets thoroughly aired, as well as night-dresses, flannels, &c. kc. All the things which will be required to dress the baby the first time should be laid in the basket in readiness, in the order in which they are to be put on ; as well as scissors, thread, a few pieces of soft linen rag, and two or three flannel squares. If a berceaunette is to be used immediately, the nurse should ascertain that the mattresses, pillow, &c. arc all well aired ; and if not already done before she arrives, she should assist in covering and trimming it, ready for the little occupant. A monthly nurse should be handy at her needle, as, if she is in the house some time before the baby is born, she will require some work of this sort to occupy her time. She should also understand the making-up of little caps, although we can scarcely say this is one of the nurse^s duties. As most children wear no caps, except out of doors, her powers in this way will not be much taxed. 2433. A nurse should endeavour to make her room as cheerful as possible, and always keej) it clean and tidy. She should empty the chamber utensils as soon as used, and on no account put things under the bed. Soiled baby's napkins should be rolled up and put into a pan, when they should be washed out every morning, and hung out to dry : they are then in a fit state to send to the laundress ; and should, on no account, be left dirty, but done every morning in this way. The bedroom should be kept rather dark, particularly for the first week or ten days; of a regular temperature, and as free as possible from draughts, at the same time well ventilated and free from unpleasant smells. •2434. The infant during the month must not be exposed to strong light, or much air ; and in carrying it about the passages, stairs, &c., the nurse should always have its head-flannel on, to protect the eyes and ears from the currents of air. For the management of children, we must refer our readers to the following chapters ; and we need only say, in conclusion, that a good nurse should understand the symptoms of various ills incident to this period, as, in all cases, prevention is better than cure. As young mothers with their first baby arc very often much troubled at first with their breasts, the nurse should understand the art of emptying them by suction, or some other contrivance. If the breasts are kept well drawn, there will be but little danger of inflam-HOUSEHOLD MAITAGEMENT. 1022 mation; and as the infant at first cannot take all that is necessary, something must be done to keep the inflammation down. This is one of the greatest difficulties a nurse has to contend with, and we can only advise her to be very persevering, to rub the breasts well, and to let the infant suck as soon and as often as possible, until they get in proper order. THE V/ET-]SrtJIlSE. 2435. We are aware that, according to the opinion ot some ladies, there is no domestic theme, during a certain period of their married lives, more fraught with vexation and disquietude than that ever-fruitful source of annoy- ance, ''the Nurse;" but, as we believe, there are thousands of excellent wives and mothers who pass through life without even a temporary embroglio in the kitchen, or suffering a state of moral hectic the whole time of a nurse's empire in the nursery or bedroom. Our own experience goes to prove, that although many unqualified persons palm themselves off on ladies as fully competent for the duties they so rashly and dishonestly undertake to perform, and thus expose themselves to ill-will and merited censure, there are still very many fully equal to the legitimate exercise of what they undertake ; and if they do not in every case give entire satisfaction, some of the fault,—and sometimes a great deal of it,—may be honestly placed to the account of the ladies them- selves, who, in many instances, are so impressed vrith the propriety of their own method of performing everything, as to insist upon the adoption of their system in preference to that of the nurse, whose plan is probably based on a comprehensive forethought, and rendered perfect in all its details by an ample experience. 2436. In all our remarks on this subject, we should remember with gentle- ness the order of society from which our nurses are drawn; and that those who make their duty a study, and are termed professional nurses, have much to endure from the caprice and egotism of their employers ; while others are driven to the occupation from the laudable motive of feeding their own chil- dren, and who, in fulfilling that object, are too often both selfish and sensual, performing, without further interest than is consistent with their own advan- tage, the routine of customary duties. 2437. Properly speaking, there are two nurses,—the nurse for the mother and the nurse for the child, or, the monthly and the wet nurse. Of the former v^-e have already spoken, and will now proceed to describe the duties of the latter, and add some suggestions as to her age, physical health, and moral conduct, subjects of the utmost importance as far as the charge intrusted to her is concerned, and therefore demanding some special remarks. 243S. When from illness, suppression of the milk, accident, or some natural process, the mother is deprived of the pleasure of rearing her infant, itDUTIES OF THE WET-NURSE. 1023 becomes necessary at once to look around for a fitting substitute, so that the child may not suffer, by any needless delay, a physical loss by the deprivation of its natural food. The first consideration should be as regards age, state of health, and temper. 2439. The age, if possible, should not be less than twenty nor exceed thirty years, with the health sound in every respect, and the body free from all eruptive disease or local blemish. The best evidence of a sound state of health will be found in the woman's clear open countenance, the ruddy tone of the skin, the full, round, and elastic state of the breasts, and especially in the erectile, firm condition of the nipple, which, in all unhealthy states of the body, is pendulous, flabby, and relaxed ; in which case, the milk is sure to be imperfect in its organization, and, consequently, deficient in its nutrient qualities. Appetite is another indication of health in the suckling nurse or mother ; for it is impossible a woman can feed her child without having a corresponding appetite; and though mordinate craving for food is neither desirable nor necessary, a natural vigour should be experienced at meal-times, and the food taken should be anticipated and enjoyed. 2440. Besides her health, the moral state of the.nurse is to be taken into account, or that mental discipline or principle of conduct which would deter the nurse from at any time gratifying her own pleasures and appetites at the cost or suffering of her infant charge. 2441. The conscientiousness and good faith that would prevent a nurse so acting are, unfortunately, very rare ; and many nurses, rather than forego the enjoyment of a favourite dish, though morally certain of the effect it will have on the child, will, on the first opportunity, feed with avidity on fried meats, cabbage, cucumbers, pickles, or other crude and injurious aliments, in defiance of all orders given, or confidence reposed in their word, good sense, and humanity. And when the infant is afterwards racked with pain, and a night of disquiet alarms the mother, the doctor is sent for, and the nurse, covering her dereUction by a falsehood, the consequence of her gluttony is treated as a disease, and the poor infant is dosed for some days with medicines, that can do it but little if any good, and, in all probability, materially retard its physical development. The selfish nurse, in her ignorance, believes, too, that as long as she experiences no admonitory symptoms herself, the child cannot suffer; and satisfied that, whatever is the cause of its screams and plunges, neither she, nor what she had eaten, had anything to do with it, with this flattering assurance at her heart, she watches her opportunity, and has another luxurious feast off the proscribed dainties, till the increasing disturbance in the child's health, or treachery from the kitchen, opens the eyes of mother and doctor to the nurse's unprincipled conduct. In all such cases the infant should be spared the infliction of medicine, and, as a wholesome corrective to herself, and relief to her charge, a good sound dose administered to the nurs*^.HOUSEHOLD MANAGED-ENT. 1024 2442. Eespectlng" tlic diet of the wet-nurse, the first pomt of importance is to fix early and definite hours for every meal; and the mother should see that no cause is ever allowed to interfere with their i)unctuality. The food itself should be light, easy of digestion, and simple. Boiled or roast meat, with bread and potatoes, with occasionall}^ a piece of sago, rice, or tapioca pudding, should constitute the dinner, the only meal that requires special comment; broths, green vegetables, and all acid or salt foods, must be avoided. Fresh fish, once or twice a week, may be taken ; but it is hardly sufficiently nutri- tious to be often used as a meal. If the dinner is taken early,—at one o'clock, —there will be no occasion for luncheon, which too often, to the injury of the child, is made the cover for a first dinner. Half a pint of stout, with a Reading biscuit, at eleven o'clock, will be abundantly sufficient between breakfast at eight and a good dinner, with a pint of porter at one o'clock. About eight o'clock in the evening, half a pint of stout, with another biscuit, may be taken ; and for supper, at ten or half-past, a pint of porter, with a slice of toast or a small amount of bread and cheese, may conclude the feeding for the day. 2443. Animal food once in twenty-four hours is quite sufficient. All spirits, unless in extreme cases, should be avoided; and wine is still more seldom needed. With a due quantity of plain digestible food, and the proportion of stout and porter ordered, with early hours and regularity, the nurse will not only be strong and healthy herself, but fully capable of rearing a child in health and strength. There are two points all mothers, who are obliged to employ wet-nurses, should remember, and be on their guard against. The fjrst is, never to allow a nurse to give medicine to the infant on her own authority: many have such an infatuated idea of the healing excellence of castor-oil, that they would administer a dose of this disgusting grease twice a week, and think they had done a meritorious service to the child. The next point is, to watch carefully, lest, to insure a night's sleep for herself, she does not dose the infant with Godfrey's cordial, syrup of poppies, or some narcotic potion, to insure tranquillity to the one and give the opportunity of sleep to the other. The fact that scores of nurses keep secret bottles of these deadly syrups, for the purpose of stilling their charges, is notorious ; and that many use them to a fearful extent, is sufficiently patent to all. -2444. It therefore behoves the mother, while obliged to trust to a nurse, to use her best discretion to guard her child from the unprincipled treatment of the person she must, to a certain extent, depend upon and trust; and to remember, in all cases, rather than resort to castor-oil or sedatives, to con- sult a medical man for her infant in preference to following the counsel of her nurse.10!i5 THE KEAEING, MANAGEMENT, AND DISEASES OF INFANCY AND CHILDHOOD. CHAPTER XLII. Physiology of Life, as illustrated by Respiration, Ciroiilation, and Digestion. ^445. The infantine management of children, like the mother's love for her offspring, seems to be bora with the child, and to be a direct intelligence oi Nature. It may thus, at first sight, appear as inconsistent and presumptuous to tell a woman how to rear her infant as to instruct her in the manner of loving it. Yet, though Nature is unquestionably the best nurse. Art makes so admirable a foster-mother, that no sensible woman, in her novitiate of parent, would refuse the admonitions of art, or the teachings of experience, to con- summate her duties of nurse. It is true that, in a civilized state of society, few young wives reach the epoch that makes them mothers without some insight, traditional or practical, into the management of infants : consequent!}^, the cases wherein a woman is left to her own unaided intelligence, or what, in such a case, may be called instinct, and obliged to trust to the promptings of nature alone for the well-being of her child, are very rare indeed. Again, every woman is not gifted with the same physical ability for the harassing duties of a mother ; and though Nature, as a general rule, has endowed all female creation with the attributes necessary to that most beautiful and, at the same time, holiest function,—the healthy rearing of their offspring,—the cases are sufficiently numerous to establish the exception, where the mother is either physically or socially incapacitated from undertaking these most pleasing duties herself, and where, consequently, she is compelled to trust to adventitious aid for those natural benefits which are at onco the mother's pride and delight to render to her child. 2446. In these cases, when obliged to call in the services of hired assistance, she must trust the dearest obligation of her life to one who, from her social sphere, has probably notions of rearing children diametrically opposed to the preconceived ideas of the mother, and at enmity with all her sentiments of right and prejudices of position. 2447. It has justly been said—we think by Hood—that the children of tho poor are not brought up, but dragged up. However facetious this remark may seem, there is much truth in it; and that cMldren, reared m the reeking 3 uHOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT. 1026 dens of squalor and poverty, live at all, is an apparent anomaly in the course of things, that, at first sight, would seem to set the laws of sanitary provision at defiance, and make it appear a perfect waste of time to insist on pure air and exercise as indispensable necessaries of life, and especially so as regards infantine existence. 2448. We see elaborate care bestowed on a family of children, everything studied that can tend to their personal comfort,—pure air, pure water, regular ablution, a dietary prescribed by art, and every precaution adopted that medical judgment and maternal love can dictate, for the well-being of the parents' hope; and find, in despite of all this care and vigilance, disease and death invading the guarded treasure. We turn to the fostor and darkness that, in some obscure court, attend the robust brood who, coated in dirt, and with mud and refuse for playthings, live and thrive, and grow into manhood, and, in contrast to the pale face and flabby flesh of the aristocratic child, exhibit strength, vigour, and well-developed frames, and our belief in the potency of the life-giving elements of air, light, and cleanliness receives a shock that, at first sight, would appear fatal to the implied benefits of these, in reality, all-sufficient attributes of health and life. 2449. ^® must enter more largely on this subject hereafter, we shall leave its consideration for the present, and return to what we were about to say respecting trusting to others' aid in the rearing of children. Here it is that the young and probably inexperienced mother may find our remarks not only an assistance but a comfort to her, in as far as, knowing the simplest and best system to adopt, she may be able to instruct another, and see that her directions are fully carried out. 2450. The human body, materially considered, is a beautiful piece of mechan- ism, consisting of many parts, each one being the centre of a system, and per- forming its own vital function irrespectively of the others, and yet dependent for its vitality upon the harmony and health of the whole. It is, in fact, to a certain extent, like a watch, which, when once wound up and set in motion, will continue its function of recording true time only so long as every wheel, spring, and lever performs its allotted duty, and at its allotted time ; or till the limit that man's ingenuity has placed to its existence as a moving automaton has been reached, or, in other words, till it has run down. 2451. What the key is to the mechanical watch, air is to the physical man. Once admit air into the mouth and nostrils, and the lungs expand, the heart beats, the blood rushes to the remotest part of the body, the mouth secretes saliva, to soften and macerate the food; the liver forms its bile, to separate th^ nutriment from the digested aliment; the kidneys perform their ofiice; the eye elaborates its tears, to facilitate motion and impart that glistening to the orb on which depends so much of its beauty ; and a dewy moisture exudes from the skin, protecting the body from the extremes of heat and cold, and1027 IlEARI^"G, ETC., OF CHILDREN. sharpening the perception of touch and feeling. At the same instant, and in overy part, the arteries, like innumerable bees, are everywhere laying down layers of muscle, bones, teeth, and, in fact, like the coral zoophyte, building up a continent of life and matter ; while the veins, equally busy, are carrying away the debris and refuse collected from where the zoophyte arteries are building,—this refuse, in its turn, being conveyed to the liver, there to be con- verted into bile. 2452. All these—and they are but a few of the vital actions constantly taking place—are the instant result of one gasp of life-giving air. No subject can bo fraught with greater interest than watching the first spark of life, as it courses with electric speed " through all the gates and alleys " of the soft, insensate body of the infant. The effect of air on the new-born child is as remarkable in its results as it is wonderful in its consequence; but to understand this more intelligibly, it must first be remembered that life consists of the per- formance of three vital functions—Eespiration, Circulation, and Digestion. The lungs digest the air, taking from it its most nutritious element, the oxygen, to give to the impoverished blood that circulates through them. The stomach digests the food, and separates the nutriment—cAj/^e—from the aliment, which it gives to the blood for the development of the frame ; and the blood, which is understood by the term circulation, digests in its passage through the lungs the nutriment—chyle—to give it quantity and quality, and the oxygen from the air to give it vitality. Hence it will be seen, that, speak- ing generally, the three vital functions resolve themselves into one,—Digestion ; and that the lungs are the primary and the most important of the vital organs ; and respiration, the first in fact, as we all know it is the last in deed, of all the functions performed by the living body. The Lungs.—Bespiration. 2453. ^^'^^ effect of air on the infant is a slight tremor about the Hps and angles of the mouth, increasing to twitchings, and finally to a convulsive contraction of the lips and cheeks, the consequence of sudden cold to the nerves of the face. This spasmodic action produces a gasp, causing the air to rjish through the mouth and nostrils, and enter the wdndiDipe and upper portion of the flat and contracted lungs, which, like a sponge partly immersed in water, immediately expand. This is succeeded by a few faint sobs or pants, by which larger volumes of air are drawn into the chest, till, after a few seconds, and when a greater bulk of the lungs has become inflated, the breast-bone and ribs rise, the chest expands, and, with a sudden start, the infant gives utterance to a succession of loud, sharp cries, w^hich have the effect of filling every cell of the entire organ with air and life. To the anxious mother, the first voice of her child is, doubtless, the sweetest music she ever heard ; and the more loudly it peals, the greater should be her joy, as it is an indication of health and strength, and not only shows the perfect expansion of the lungs, but that the process of life has set in with vigour. Having 3 u 2]023 HOUSEHOLD MANAGEM^ENT. welcomed in its ovv^n existence, like the morning bird, with a shrill note of gladness, the infant ceases its cry, and, after a few short sobs, usually subsides into sleep or quietude. 2454. At the same instant that the air rushes into the lungs, the valve, or door between the two sides of the heart—and through which the blood had previously passed—is closed and hermetically sealed, and the blood taking a nev/ course, bounds into the lungs, now expanded with air, and which we have likened to a wetted sponge, to which they bear a not unapt affinit}^, air being substituted for water. It here receives the oxygen from the atmosphere, and the chyle, or white blood, from the digested food, and becomes, in an instant, arterial blood, a vital principle, from which every solid and fluid of the body is constructed. Besides the lungs. Nature has pi'ovided another respiratory organ, a sort of supplemental lung, that, as well as being a covering to the body, i?ispires air and e^'pires moisture;—this is the cuticle, or skin ; and so intimate is the connection between the skin and lungs, that whatever injures the first, is certain to affect the latter. 2455. Hence the difficulty of Ircathing experienced after scalds or hums on the cuticle, the cough that follous the alsor];)tion of cold or damp hy the slin^ the oppressed and laborious breathing experienced by children in all eruptive diseases, v:hile the rash is coming to the surface, and the hot, dry shin that alv:ays attends congestion of the lungs, and fever. 2456. The great practical advantage derivable from this fact is, the know- ledge that whatever relieves the one benefits the other. Hence, too, the great utility of hot baths in all affections of the lungs or diseases of the skin ; and the reason why exposure to cold or wet is, in nearly all cases, followed by tightness of the chest, sore throat, difficulty of breathing, and cough. These symptoms are the consequence of a larger quantity of blood than is natural remaining in the lungs, and the cough is a mere effort of Nature to throw ofi the obstruction caused by the presence of too much'blood in the organ of respiration. The hot bath, by causing a larger amount of blood to rush suddenly to the skin, has the effect of relieving the lungs of their excess of blood, and by equalizing the circulation, aud promoting perspiration from the cuticle, affords immediate and direct benefit, both to the lungs and the system at largo. The Stomach.—Digestion. 2457. The organs that cither directly or indirectly contribute to the process of digestion are, the mouth, teeth, tongue, and gullet, tlie stomach, small in- testines, the pancreas, the salivary glands, and the liver. Next to respiration, digestion is the chief function in the economy of life, as, without the nutri- tious fiuid digested from the aliment, there would be nothing to supply the immense and constantly recurring waste of the system, caused by the activity with which the arteries at all periods, but especially during infancy and youth, are building up the frame and developing the body. In infancy (the period ofREARING, ETC., OF CHILDREN. 1029 which our present subject treats), the series of parts engaged in the process of digestion may be reduced simply to the stomach and liver, or ratlier its secretion,—the bile. The stomach is a thick muscular bag, connected above with the gullet, and, at its lower extremity, with the commencement of the small intestines. The duty or function of the stomach is to secrete from the arteries spread over its inner surfixce, a sharp acid liquid called the gastric juice ; this, with a due mixture of saliva, softens, dissolves, and gradually digests the food or contents of the stomach, reducing the whole into a soft pulpy mass, which then passes into the first part of the small intestines, where it comes in contact with the bile from the gall-bladder, which immediately separates the digested food into two i:>arts ; one is a white creamy fluid called chyle, and the absolute concentration of all nourishment, which is taken up by proper vessels, and, as we have before said, carrie^l directly to the heart, to be made blood of, and vitalized in the lungs, and thus provide for the wear and tear of the system. It must be here observed that the stomach can only digest solids, for fluids, being incapable of that process, can only hGalsorhed; and without the result of digestion, animal, at least human life, could not exist. Now, as Nature has ordained that infantine life shall be supported on liquid aliment, and as, without a digestion the body would perish, some pro- vision was necessary to meet this difficulty, and that provision was found in the nature of the liquid itself, or in other ^vords, THE MILK. The process of making cheese, or fresh curds and whey, is familiar to most persons ; but as it is necessary to the elucidation of our subject, we will briefly repeat it. The internal membrane, or the lining coat of a calf's stomach, having been removed from the organ, is hung up, like a bladder, to dry ; when required, a piece is cut off, put in a jug, a little warm water poured upon it, and after a few hours it is fit for use ; the liquid so made being called rennet. A little of this rennet, poured into a basin of warm milk, at once coagulates the greater part, and separates from it a quantity of thin liquor, called 2vhei/. This is precisely the action that takes place in the infant's stomach after every supply from the breast. The cause is the same in both cases, the acid of the gastric juice in the infant's stomach immediately converting the milk into a soft cheese. It is gastric juice, adhering to the calf's stomach, and drawTi out by the water, forming rennet, that makes the curds in the basin. The cheesy substance being a solid, at once undergoes the process of digestion, is separated into cJiyle by the bile, and, in a few hours, finds its w^ay to the infant's heart, to become blood, and commence the architecture of its little frame. This is the simple process of a baby's digestion :—milk converted into cheese, cheese into chyle, chyle into blood, and blood into flesh, bone, and tegument—how simple is the cause, but how sublime and wonderful are the effects ! 2458. We have described the most important of the three functions that take place in the infant's body—respiration and digestion ; the third, namely, circulation, we hardly think it necessary to enter on, not being called for by the requirements of the nurse and mother ; so we shall omit its notice, and proceed from theoretical to more practical considerations. Children of weakly1039 HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT, constitutions are just as likely to be born of robust parents, and those who earn their bread by toil, as the offspring of luxury and affluence ; and, indeed, it is against the ordinary providence of Nature to suppose the children of the hardworking and necessitous to be hardier and more vigorous than those of parents blessed with ease and competence. 2459. -^^^ children come into the world in the same imploring helplessness, with the same general organization and wants, and demanding either from the newly-awakened mother's love, or from the memory of motherly feeling in the nm'se, or the common appeals of humanity in those who undertake the earliest duties of an infant, the same assistance and protection, and the same fostering care. THE INFAITT. 2460. We have already described the phenomena produced on the new-born child by the contact of air, which, after a succession of muscular twitchings, becomes endowed with voice, and heralds its advent by a loud but brief suc- cession of cries. But though this is the general rule, it sometimes happens (from causes it is unnecessary here to explain) that the infant does not cry, or give iitterance to any audible sounds, or if it does, they are so faint as scarcely to be distinguished as human accents, plainly indicating that life, as yet, to the new visitor, is neither a boon nor a blessing ; the infant being, in fact, in a state of suspended or imperfect vitality,—a state of quasi existence, closely approximating the condition of a still-hirth. 2461. As soon as this state of things is discovered, the child should be turned on its right side, and the whole length of the spine, from the head downwards, rubbed with all the fingers of the right hand, sharpl}^ and quickly, without intermission, till the quick action has not only evoked heat, but electricity in the part, and till the loud and sharp cries of the child have thoroughly expanded the lungs, and satisfactorily established its life. The operation will seldom require above a minute to effect, and less frequently demands a repetition. If there is brandy at hand, the fingers before rubbing may be dipped into that, or any other spirit. 2462. There is another condition of what we may call ''mute births," where the child only makes short ineffectual gasps, and those at intervals of a minute or two apart, when the lips, eyelids, and fingers become of a deep purple or slate colour, sometimes half the body remaining white, while the other half, which was at first swarthy, deepens to a livid hue. This condition of the infant is owing to the valve between the two sides of the heart remaining open, and allowing the unvitalized venous blood to enter the arteries and get into the circulation.1031 REAEING, ETC., OF CUILDREN. 2463. The object in this case, as in the previous one, is to dilate the lungs as quickly as possible, so that, by the sudden effect of a vigorous inspiration, the valve may be firmly closed, and the impure blood, losing this means of egress, be sent directly to the lungs. The same treatment is therefore necessary as in the previous case, with the addition, if the friction along the spine has failed, of a warm bath at a temperature of about 80°, in which the child is to be plunged up to the neck, first cleansing the mouth and nostrils of the mucus that might interfere with the free passage of air. 2464. While in the bath, the friction along the spine is to be continued, and if the lungs still remain unexpanded, while one person retains the child in an inclined position in the water, another should insert the pi^^e of a small pair of bellows into one nostril, and while the mouth is closed and the other nostril compressed on the pipe with the hand of the assistant, the lungs are to be slowly inflated by steady puffs of air from the bellows, the hand being removed from the mouth and nose after each inflation, and placed on the pit of the stomach, and by a steady pressure expelling it out again by the mouth. This process is to be continued, steadily inflating and expelling the air from the lungs, till, with a sort of tremulous leap, Nature takes up the process, and the infant begins to gasp, and finally to cry, at first low and faint, but with every engulp of air increasing in length and strength of volume, when it is to be removed from the water, and instantly wrapped (all but the face and mouth) in a flannel. Sometimes, however, all these means will fail in efl'ecting an utterance from the child, which will lie, with livid lips and a flaccid body, every few minutes opening its mouth with a short gasping pant, and then subsiding into a state of pulseless inaction, lingering probably some hours, till the spasmodic pantings growing further apart, it ceases to exist. 2465. The time that this state of negative vitality will linger in the frame of an infant is remarkable ; and even when all the previous ox)erations, though long-continued, have proved ineff'ectual, the child will often rally from the simplest of means—the application of dry heat. When removed from the bath, place three or four hot bricks or tiles on the hearth, and lay the child, loosely folded in a flannel, on its back along them, taking care that there is but one fold of flannel between the spine and heated bricks or tiles. When neither of these articles can be procured, put a few clear pieces of red cinder in a warming-pan, and extend the child in the same manner along the closed lid. As the heat gradually diffuses itself over the spinal marrow, the child that was dying, or seemingly dead, will frequently give a sudden and energetic cry, succeeded in another minute by a long and vigorous peal, making up, in volume and force, for the previous delay, and instantly confirming its existence by every effort in its nature. 2466. With these two exceptions,—restored by the means we have pointed out to the functions of life,—we will proceed to the consideration of the child HEALTHILY BORN. Here the first thing that meets us on the threshold 01HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT. 1032 inquirj', and what is often between mother and nurse not only a vexed ques- tion, but one of vexatious import, is tlie cvying of the child ; the mother, in her natural anxiety, maintaining that her infant must he ill to cause it to cry so much or so often, and the nurse insisting that all children cry, and thai nothing is the matter with it, and that crying does good, and is, indeed, an especial benefit to infancy. The anxious and unfamiliar mother, though no-t convinced by these abstract sayings of the truth or wisdom of the explanation, takes both for granted ; and, giving the nurse credit for more knowledge and experience on this head than she can have, contentedly resigns herself to the infliction, as a thing necessary to be endured for the good of the baby, but thinking it, at the same time, an extraordinary instance of the imperfectibilitj of Nature as regards the human infant; for her mind wanders to what she has observed in her childhood with puppies and kittens, who, except when rudely torn from their nurse, seldom give utterance to any complaining. 2467. We, undoubtedly, believe that crying, to a certain extent, is not only conducive to health, but positively necessary to the full development and physical economy of the infant's being. But though holding this opinion, we are far from believing that a child does not very often cry from pain, thirst, want of food, and attention to its personal comfort; but there is as mucb difference in the tone and expression of a child's cry as in the notes of an adult's voice ; and the mother's ear will not be long in discriminating between the sharp peevish whine of irritation and fever, and the louder intermitting cry that characterizes the want of warmth and sleep. All these shades of expression in the child's inarticulate voice every nurse should understand, and every mother will soon teach herself to interpret them with an accuracy equal to language. 2468. There is no part of a woman's duty to her child that a young mother should so soon make it her business to study, as the voice of her infant, and the language conveyed in its cry. The study is neither hard nor difficult; a. close attention to its tone, and the expression of the baby's features, are the two most important points demanding attention. The key to both the mother will find in her own heart, and the knowledge of her success in the comfort and smile of her infant. We have two reasons—both strong ones—for urging on mothers the imperative necessity of early making themselves acquainted with the nature and wants of their child : the first, that when left to the entire responsibility of the baby, after the departure of the nurse, she may be able to undertake her new duties with more confidence than if left to her own resources and mother's instinct, without a clue to guide her through tho mysteries of those calls that vibrate through every nerve of her nature ; and, secondly, that she may be able to guard her child from the nefarious prac- tices of unprincipled nurses, who, while calming the mother's mind with false statements as to the character of the baby's cries, rather than lose their rest, or devote that time which would remove the cause of suffering, administer, behind the curtains, those deadly narcotics which, while stupefying Nature intoREARING, ETC., OF CHILDREN. 1033 sleep, insure for herself a niglit of many unbroken hours. Such nurses as have not the hardihood to dose their infant charges, are often full of other schemes to still that constant and reproachful cr}'. The most frequent means employed for this purpose is giving it something to suck,—something easily hid from the mother,—or, when that is impossible, under the plea of keej^ing it v/arm, the nurse covers it in her lap with a shawl, and, under this blind, surreptitiously inserts a finger between the parched lips, which possibly moan for drink ; and, under this inhuman cheat and delusion, the infant is pacified, till Nature, balked of its desires, drops into a troubled sleep. These are two of our reasons for impressing upon mothers the early, the immediate necessity of putting themselves sympathetically in communication with their child, by at once learning its hidden language as a delightful task. 2469. We must strenuously warn all mothers on no account to allow tho nurse to sleep with the baby, never herself to lay down with it by her side for a night's rest, never to let it sleep in the parents' bed, and on no account keep it, longer than absolutely necessary, confined in an atmosphere loaded T^ith the breath of many adults. 2470. The amount of oxygen required by an infant is so large, and the quantity consumed by mid-life and age, and the proportion of carbonic acid throv;n off from both, so considerable, that an infant breathing the same air cannot possibly carry on its healthy existence while deriving its vitality from so corrupted a medium. This objection, always in force, is still more objec- tionable at night-time, when doors and windows are closed, and amounts to a condition of poison, when placed between two adults in sleep, and shut in by bed-curtains ; and when, in addition to the impurities expired from the lungs, we remember, in quiescence and sleep, how large a portion of mephitic gas is given off from the skin. 2471. Mothers, in the fulness of their affection, believe there is no harbour, sleeping or awake, where their infants can be so secure from all possible or probable danger as in their own arms ; yet we should astound our readers if we told them the statistical number of infants who, in despite of their motherly solicitude and love, are annually killed, unwittingly, by such parents themselves, and this from the persistency in the practice we are so strenuously condemning. The mother frequently, on awaking, discovers the baby's face closely imj^acted between her bosom and her arm, and its body rigid and lifeless; or else so enveloped in the ^'head-blanket" and superin- cumbent bedclothes, as to render breathing a matter of physical impossibility. In such cases the jury in general returns a verdict of Accidentally overlaid/* but one of " Careless sufFocatioli" would be more in accordance with truth and justice. The only possible excuse that can be urged,, either by nurse or mother, for this culpable practice, is the jDlea of imparting warmth to the infant. But this can always be effected by an extra blanket in the child's crib, or, if the weather is particularly cold, by a bottle of hot water enveloped1031- nOUSEHOLB MANAGEMSK-r. in flannel and placed at the child's feet; while all the objections already urged—as derivable from animal heat imparted by actual contact—are entirely- obviated. There is another evil attending the sleeping together of the mother and infant, which, as far as regards the latter, we consider quite as formidable, though not so immediate as the others, and is always followed by more or less of mischief to the mother. The evil we now allude to is that most injurious practice of letting the child suck after the mother has fallen asleep, a custom that naturally results from the former, and which, as we have already said, is injurious to both mother and child. It is injurious to the infant by allowing it, vrithout control, to imbibe to distension a fluid sluggishly secreted and deficient in those vital principles which the want of mental energy, and of the sympa- thetic appeals of the child on the mother, so powerfully produce on the secreted nutriment, while the mother wakes in a state of clammy exhaustion, with giddiness, dimness of sight, nausea, loss of appetite, and a dull siching pain through the back and between the shoulders. In fact, she wakes languid and unrefreshed from her sleep, with febrile symptoms and hectic flushes, caused by her baby vampire, who, while dragging from her her health and strength, has excited in itself a set of symptoms directly opposite, but fraught with tho same injurious consequences—'Afunctional derangement." THE MILK. '2472. As Nature has placed in the bosom of the mother the natural food of her offspring, it must be self-evident to every reflecting woman, that it becomes her duty to study, as far as lies in her power, to keep that reservoir of nourishment in as pure and invigorating a condition as possible ; for she must remember that the qiiantity is no proof of the quality 01 this aliment. 2473. The mother, while suckling, as a general rule, should avoid all sedentary occupations, take regular exercise, keep her mind as lively and pleasingly occupied as possible, especially by music and singing. Her diet should be light and nutritious, with a proper sufiiciency of animal food, and of that kind which yields the largest amount of nourishment; and, unless the digestion is naturally strong, vegetables and fruit should form a very small proportion of the general dietary, and such preparations as broths, gruels, arrowroot, &c., still less. Tapioca, or ground-rice pudding, made with several eggs, may be taken freely; but all slops and thin potations, such as that delusion called chicken-broth, should be avoided, as yielding a very small amount of nutriment, and a large proportion of flatulence. All purely stimu- lants should be avoided as much as possible, especially spirits, unless taken for some special object, and that medicinally ; but as a part of the dietary they should be carefully shunned. Lactation is always an exhausting process, and as the child increases in size and strength, the drain upon the mother becomes great and depressing. Then something more even than an abundant diet la1035 reahi^^g, etc., of children. required to keep the mind and body up to a standard sufficiently healthy to admit of a constant and nutritious secretion being performed without detri- ment to the physical integrity of the mother, or injury to the child who im- bibes it; and as stimulants are inadmissible, if not positively injurious, the substitute required is to be found in malt liquor. To the lady accustomed to her Madeira and sherry, this may appear a very vulgar potation for a delicate young mother to take instead of the more subtle and condensed elegance of wine ; but as we are writing from experience, and with the avowed object of imparting useful facts and beneficial remedies to 'our readers, we allow no social distinctions to interfere with our legitimate object. 2474. We have already said that the suckling mother should avoid stimu- lants, especially spirituous ones ; and though something of this sort is ab- solutely necessary to sui)port her strength during the exhausting process, it should be rather of a tonic than of a stimulating character ; and as all wines contain a large percentage of brandy, they are on that account less bene- ficial than the pure juice of the fermented grape might be. But there is another consideration to be taken into account on this subject; the mother has not only to think of herself, but also of her infant. Now wines, especially port wine, very often—indeed, most frequently—afiect the baby's bowels, and what might have been grateful to the mother becomes thus a source of pain and irritation to the child afterwards. Sherry is less open to this objection than other wines, yet still it very frequently does influence the second parti- cipator, or the child whose mother has taken it. 2475. The nine or twelve months a woman usually suckles must be, to some extent, to most mothers, a period of privation and penance, and unless she is deaf to the cries of her baby, and insensible to its kicks and plunges, and v/ill not see in such muscular evidences the griping pains that rack her child, she will avoid every article that can remotely afifect the little being who draws its sustenance from her. She will see that the babe is acutely afiected by all that in any way influences her, and willingly curtail her own enjoyments, rather than see her infant rendered feverish, irritable, and uncomfortable. As the best tonic, then, and the most efficacious indirect stimulant that a mother can take at such times, there is no potation equal to 'porter and stout, or, what is better still, an equal part of porter and stout. Ale, except for a few constitutions, is too subtle and too sweet, generally causing acidity or heartburn, and stout alone is too potent to admit of a full draught, from its proneness to affect the head; and quantity, as well as moderate streng-th, is required to make the draught effectual; the equal mixture, therefore, of stout and porter yields all the properties deshed or desirable as a medicinal agent for this purpose. 2476. Independently of its invigorating influence on the constitution, porter exerts a raarlced and specific effect on tie secretion of mill-, more powerful in exciting an abundant sup)ply of that fluid than any other article within Hie103(5 HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT, range of the];)liysician^s art; and, in cases of deficient quantity, is the most certain, speedy, and the healthiest means that can be employed to insure a quick and abundant flow. In cases where malt liquor produces flatulency, a few grains of the "carbonate of soda" may advantageously be added to each glass immediately before drinking, which will have the efl'ect of neutralizing any acidity that may be in the porter at the time, and will also prevent its after-disagreement with the stomach. The quantity to be taken must depend upon the natural strength of the mother, the age and demand made by tlio infant on the parent, and other causes ; but the amount should vary from one to two pints a day, never taking less than half a pint at a time, which should be repeated three or four times a day. 2477. "We have said that the period of suckling is a season of penance to the mother, bub this is not invariably the case ; and, as so much must depend upon the natural strength of the stomach, and its power of assimilating all kinds of food into healthy chyle, it is impossible to define exceptions. Where a woman feels she can cat any kind of food, without inconvenience or detri- ment, she should live during her suckling as she did before ; but, as a general rule, wo are bound to advise all mothers to abstain from such articles as pickles, fruits, cucumbers, and all acid and slowly digestible foods, unless they wish for restless nights and crying infants. 2478. As regards exercise and amusement, we would certainly neither prohibit a mother's dancing, going* to a theatre, nor even from attending an assembly. The first, however, is the best indoor recreation she can take,, and a young mother will do well to often amuse herself in the nursery with this most excellent means of healthful circulation. The only precaution necessary is to avoid letting the child suck the milk that has lain long in the breast, or is heated by excessive action. 2479. Every mother who can, should be i^rovided with a breast-pump, or glass tube, to draw off the superabundance that has been accumulating in her absence from the child, or the first gush excited by undue exertion: the subsequent supplj'- of milk will be secreted under the invigorating influence oi a iDrevious healthy stimulus. 2480. As the first milk that is secreted contains a large amount of the saline elements, and is thin and innutritions, it is most admirably adapted for the purpose Nature designed it to fulfil,—that of an aperient; but which, un- fortunately, it is seldom permitted, in our artificial mode of Hving, to perlbrm. 2481. So opposed are we to the objectionable plan of physicking new-born children, that, unless for positive illness, we would much rather advise that medicine should be administered through the mother for the first eight or ten weeks of its existence. This practice, which few mothers will object to, is1037 LEAr,I>-G, LTC, OF CHILDREN. easily eficcted by the parent, when such a course is necessary for the child, taking either a dose of castor-oil, half an ounce of tasteless salts (the phos- phate of soda), one or two teaspoonfuls of magnesia, a dose of lenitive electuary, manna, or any mild and simple aperient, which, almost before it can have taken effect on herself, will exhibit its action on her child. 2482. One of the most common errors that mothers fall into while suckling; their children, is that of fancying they are always hungry, and consequently overfeeding them ; and with this, the great mistake of applying the child to the breast on every occasion of its crying, without investigating the cause of its complaint, and, under the belief that it wants food, putting the nipj)lG into its crying mouth, until the infant turns in revulsion and petulance from, what it should accept with eagerness and joy. At such times, a few teaspoon- fuls of w^ater, slightly chilled, will often instantly pacify a crying and restless child, who has turned in loathing from the offered breast; or, after imbibing a few drops, and finding it not what nature craved, throws back its head in disgust, and cries more petulantly than before. In such a case as this, tho young mother, grieved at her baby's rejection of the tempting present, and distressed at its cries, and in terror of some injury, over and over ransacks its clothes, believing some insecure pin can alone be the cause of such sharp com- plaining, an accident that, from her own care in dressing, however, is seldom or ever the case. C483. These abrupt cries of the child, if they do not proceed from thirst, which a little water will relieve, not unfrequently occur from some unequal pressure, a fold or tv/ist in the ''roller," or some constriction round the tender body. If this is suspected, the mother must not be content with merely slackening the strings; the child should be undressed, and the creases and folds of the hot skin, especially those about the thighs and groins, examined, to see that no powder has caked, and, becoming hard, irritated the parts. The violet powder should be dusted freely over all, to cool the skin, and every- thing put on fresh and smooth. If such precautions have not afforded relief, and, in addition to the crying, the child plunges or draws up its legs, the mother may be assured some cause of irritation exists in the stomach or bow^els,—either acidity in the latter or distension from overfeeding in the former ; but, from wdiichever cause, the child should be opened" before the fire, and a heated napkin applied all over the abdomen, the infant being occasionally elevated to a sitting position, and while gently jolted on tho knee, the back should be lightly patted with the hand. 2484. Should the mother have any reason to apprehend that the cause of inconvenience proceeds from the bladder—a not unfrequent source of pain,— the napkin is to be dipped in_hot water, squeezed out, and immediately applied over the part, and repeated every eight or ten minutes, for several times in succession, either till the natural relief is afforded, pr a cessation of pain allows of its discontinuance. The pain that young infants often suner, and theHOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT, 1033 crying that results from it, is, as we have already said, frequently caused by the mother inconsiderately overfeeding her child, and is produced by the pain of distension, and the mechanical pressure of a larger quantity of fluid in the stomach than the gastric juice can convert into cheese and digest. 2485. Some children are stronger in the enduring power of the stomach than others, and get rid of the excess by vomiting, concluding every process of suckling by an emission of milk and curd. Such children are called by nurses ^ thriving children;" and generally they are so, simply because their digestion is good, and they have the power of expelling with impunity that superabundance of aliment which in others is a som'ce of distension, flatulence, and pain, 2486. The length of time an infant should be suckled must depend much on the health and strength of the child, and the health of the mother, and the quantity and quality of her milk; though, when all circumstances are favourable, it should never be less than nine, nor exceed fifteen months ; but perhaps the true time will be found in the medium between both. But of this v/e may be sure, that Nature never ordained a child to live on suction after having endowed it with teeth to bite and to grind; and nothing is more out of place and unseemly than to hear a child, with a set of twenty teeth, ask for the breast." 2487. The practice of protracted wet-nursing is hurtful to the mother, by keeping uj) an uncalled-for, and, after the proper time, an unhealthy drain on her system, while the child either derives no benefit from what it no longer requires, or it produces a positive injury on its constitution. After the period when Nature has ordained the child shall live by other means, the secretion of milk becomes thin and deteriorated, showing in the flabby flesh and puny features of the child both its loss of nutritious properties and the want of more stimulating aliment, 24S8. Though we have said that twelve months is about the medium time a baby should be suckled, we by no means wish to imply that a child should be fed exclusively on milk for its first year ; quite the reverse ; the infant can hardly be too soon made independent of the mother. Thus, should illness assail her, her milk fail, or any domestic cause abruptly cut ofi" the natural supply, the child having been annealed to an artificial diet, its life might be safely carried on v/ithout seeking for a wet-nurse, and without the slightest danger to its system. 2489. The advantage to the mother of early accustoming the child to arti- ficial food is as considerable to herself as beneficial to her infant; the demand on her physical strength in the first instance will be less severe and exhausting, the child will sleep longer on a less rapidly digestible aliment, and yield to both more quiet nights, and the mother will be more at liberty to go out for1039 REABIKa, ETC., OP CHILDREN. business or pleasure, another means of sustenance being at hand till her return. Besides these advantages, by a judicious blending of the two systems of feeding, the infant will acquire greater constitutional strength, so that, if attacked by sickness or disease, it will have a much greater chance of re- sisting its virulence than if dependent alone on the mother, whose milk, affected by fatigue and the natural anxiety of the parent for her offspring, is at such a time neither good in its properties nor likely to be beneficial to the patient. 2490. All that we have further to say on suckling is an advice to mothers, that if they wish to keep a sound and unchapped nipple, and possibly avoid what is called a "broken breast," never to put it up with a wet nipple, but always to have a soft handkerchief in readiness, and the moment that delicate part is drawn from the child's mouth, to dry it carefully of the milk and saliva that moisten it; and, further, to make a practice of suckling from each breast alternately. Dress and Dressing, WasMngj &c, 2491. As respects the dress and dressing of a new-born infant, or of a child in arms, during any stage of its nursing, there are few women who will require us to give them guidance or directions for their instruction ; and though a few hints on the subject may not be out of place here, yet most women intuitively 'Hake to a baby," and, with a small amount of experience, are able to perform all the little offices necessary to its comfort and cleanliness with ease and completeness. We shall, therefore, on this delicate subject hold our peace; and only, from afar, liint ''at what we would," leaving our sugges- tions to be approved or rejected, according as they chime with the judgment and the apprehension of our motherly readers. 2492. In these days of intelligence, there are few ladies who have not, in all probability, seen the manner in which the Indian squaw, the aborigines of Polynesia, and even the Lapp and Esquimaux, strap down their baby on a board, and by means of a loop suspend it to the bough of a tree, hang it up to the rafters of the hut, or on travel, dangle it on their backs, outside the domestic implements, which, as the slave of her master, man, the wronged but uncomplaining woman carries, in order that her lord may march in unhampered freedom. Cruel and confining as this system of '' backboard " dressing may seem to our modern notions of freedom and exercise, it is positively less irksome, less confining, and infinitely less prejudicial to health, than the mummying of children by our grandmothers a hundred, ay, fifty years ago : for what with chin-stays, back-stays, body-staj^s, forehead-cloths, rollers, bandages, &c., an infant had as many girths and strings, to keep head, limbs, and body in one exact position, as a ship has halyards. 2493. Much of this—indeed we may say all—has been abolished ; but still the1010 H0TJ3EH0TJ) MANAGEMENT. cliild is fiir from being* dressed loosely enough ; and we sliall never be satisfied till the abominable use of the ];)in is avoided in toto in an infant's dressing, and a texture made for all the under garments of a child of a cool and elastic material. 2494. The,inanner in which an infant is encircled in a bandage called the roller/' as if it had fractured ribs, compressing those organs—that, living on suction, must be, for the health of the child, to a certain degree distended, to obtain sufficient aliment from the fluid imbibed—is perfectly preposterous. Our humanity, as well as our duty, calls upon us at once to abrogate and dis- countenance by every means in our power. Instead of the process of washing and dressing being made, as with the adult, a refreshment and comfort, it is, by the dawdling manner in which it is performed, the multiplicity of things used, and the perpetual change of position of the infant to adjust its com- plicated clothing', rendered an operation of positive irritation and annoyance. We, therefore, entreat all mothers to regard this subject in its true light, and study to the utmost, simplicity in dress, and dispatch in the proces s. 2495. Children do not so much cry from the washing as from the irritation caused by the frequent change of position in which they are placed, the number of times they are turned on their face, on their back, and on their side, by the manipulations demanded by the multiplicity of articles to be fitted, taclied, and carefully adjusted on their bodies. What mother ever found her girl of six or seven stand quiet while she was curling her hair ? How many times nightly has she not to reprove her for not standing still during the process ! It is the same with the unconscious infant, who cannot bear to be moved about, and who has no sooner grown reconciled to one position than it is forced reluctantly into another. It is true, in one instance the child has intelligence to guide it, and in the other not; but the motitory nerves, in both instances, resent coercion, and a child cannot be too little handled. 2496. On this account alone, and, for the moment, setting health and comfort out of the question, v/e beg mothers to simplify their baby's dress as much as possible ; and not only to put on as little as is absolutely necessary, but to make that as simple in its contrivance and adjustment as it will admit of; to avoid belly-bands, rollers, girths, and everything that can impede or confine the natural expansion of the digestive organs, on the due performance of whose functions the child lives, thrives, and develops its physical being. BEABIISrG- BY HAlMD. Articles necessary, and how to nse them.—Preparation of Foods.— Baths.—Advantages of Bearing by Hand. 2497. As we do not for a moment wish to be thought an advocate for an artificial, in preference to the natural course of rearing children, we bog carEEAP.ING, ETC.^ OF CHILDREN. 1041 readers to understand us perfectly ou this head ; all we desire to prove is the fact that a child can be brought up as well on a spoon dietary as the best examiDle to be found of those reared on the breast; having more strength, in- deed, from the more nutritious food on which it lives. It will be thus less liable to infectious diseases, and more capable of resisting the virulence of any danger that may attack it; and without in any way depreciating the nutriment of its natural food, we wish to impress on the mother's mind that there are many cases of infantine debility which might eventuate in rickets, curvature of the spine, or mesenteric disease, where the addition to, or total substitution ol", an artificial and more stimulating aliment, would not only give tone and strength to the constitution, but at the same time render the employment of mechanical means totally unnecessary. And, finally, though we would never —where the mother had the strength to suckle her child—supersede the breast, we would insist on making it a rule to accustom the child as early as possible to the use of an artificial diet, not only that it may acquire more vigour to help it over the ills of childhood, but that, in the absence of the mother, it might not miss the maternal sustenance ; and also for the parent's sake, that, should the milk, from any cause, become vitiated, or suddenly cease, the child can be made over to the bottle and the spoon without the slightest appre- hension of hurtful consequences. 2498. To those persons unacquainted with the system, or who may have been erroneously informed on the matter, the rearing of a child by hand may seem surrounded by innumerable difficulties, and a large amount of personal trouble and anxiety to the nurse or mother who undertakes the duty. This, iiowever, is a fallacy in every respect, except as regards the fact of preparing the food ; but even this extra amount of work, by adopting the course we shall lay down, may be reduced to a very small sum of inconvenience ; and as respects anxiety, the only thing calling for care is the display of judgment in the preparation of the food. The articles required for the purpose of feeding an mfant are a night-lamp, with its pan and lid, to keep the food warm ; a nursing-bottle, with a prepared teat; and a small pai3 saucepan, for use by day. Of the lamp we need hardly speak, most mothers being acquainted with its operation : but to those to whom it is unknown we may observe, that the ilame from the floating rushlight heats the v/ater in the reservoir above, in which the covered pan that contains the food floats, keeping it at such a heat that, when thinned by milk, it will be of a temperature suitable for immediate use. Though many kinds of nursing-bottles have been lately invented, and some mounted with India-rubber nij^ples, the common glass bottle, with the calf's teat, is equal in cleanliness and utility to any; besides, the nipple put into the child's mouth is so white and natural in appearance, that no child taken from the breast will refuse it. The black artificial ones of caoutchouc or gutta-percha are unnatural. The prepared teats can be obtained at any chemist's, and as they are kept in spirits, they will require a little soaking in warm water, and gentle washing, before being tied securely, by means of fin<> twine, round the neck of the bottle, just sufficient being left projecting for 3 XHOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT. 1042 the child to grasp freely in its lips ; for if left the full length, or over long, it will be drawn too far into the mouth, and possibly make the infant heave. When once properly adjusted, the nipple need never be removed till replaced by a new one, which will hardly be necessary oftener than once a fortnight, though with care one will last for several weeks. The nursing-bottle should be thoroughly washed and cleaned every day, and always rinsed out before and after using it, the warm water being squeezed through the nipple, to wash out any particles of food that might lodge in the aperture, and become sour. The teat can always be kept white and soft by turning the end of the bottle, when not in use, into a narrow jug containing water, taking care to dry it first, and then to warm it by drawing the food through before putting it into the child's mouth. Food, and its Preparation. 2499. The articles generally employed as food for infants consist of arrow- root, bread, flour, baked flour, prepared groats, farinaceous food, biscuit- powder, biscuits, tops-and-bottoms, and semolina, or manna croup, as it is otherwise called, which, like tapioca, is the prepared pith of certain vegetable substances. Of this list the least efiicacious, though, perhaps, the most believed in, is arrowroot, which only as a mere agent, for change, and then only for a very short time, should ever be employed as a means of diet to 1 infancy or childhood. It is a thin, flatulent, and innutritious food, and in- capable of supporting infantine life with energy. Bread, though the universal regime with the labouring poor, where the infant's stomach and digestive powers are a reflex, in miniature, of the father's, should never be given to an infant under three months, and, even then, however finely beaten up and smoothly made, is a very questionable diet. Flour, when well boiled, though ' infinitely better than arrowroot, is still only a kind of fermentative paste, that counteracts its own good by after-acidity and flatulence. 2500. Baked flour, when cooked into a pale brown mass, and finely powdered, makes a far superior food to the others, and may be considered as a very useful diet, especially for a change. Prepared groats may be classed with arrowroot and raw flour, as being innutritious. The articles that now follow in our list are all good, and such as we could, with conscience and safety, trust to for the health and development of any child whatever. f ] 2501. We may observe in this place, that an occasional change in the 1 character of the food is highly desirable, both as regards the health and benefit .j of the child; and though the interruption should only last for a day, thp J change will be advantageous. ,1 2502. The packets sold as farinaceous food are unquestionably the best aliment that can be given from the first to a baby, and may be continued, with the exception of an occasional change, without alteration of the mate- rial, till the child is able to take its regular meals of animal and vegetable 1BEARING, ETC., OF CHILDREN. 1043 food. Some infants are so constituted as to require a frequent and total change in their system of living, seeming to thrive for a certain time on any food given to them, but if persevered in too long, declining in bulk and appearance as rapidly as they had previously progressed. In such cases tho food shoiild be immediately changed, and when that which appeared to agree best with the child is resumed, it should be altered in its quality, and per- haps in its consistency. 2503. For the farinaceous food there are directions with each packet, con- taining instructions for the making; but, whatever the food employed is, enough should be made at once to last the day "and night; at first, about a pint basinful, but, as the child advances, a quart will hardly be too much. In all cases, let the food boil a sufiScient time, constantly stirring, and taking every precaution that it does not get burnt, in which case it is on no account to be used. 2504. The food should always be made with water, the whole sweetened at once, and of such a consistency that, when poured out, and it has had time to cool, it will cut with the firmness of a pudding or custard. One or two spoonfuls are to be put into the pap saucepan and stood on the hob till the heat has softened it, when enough milk is to be added, and carefully mixed with the food, till the whole has the consistency of ordinary cream ; it is then to be poured into the nursing-bottle, and the food having been drawn through to warm the nipple, it is to be placed in the child's mouth. For the first month or more, half a bottleful will be quite enough to give the infant at one time; but, as the child grows, it will be necessary not only to increase the quantity given at each time, but also gradually to make its food more con- sisteht, and, after the third month, to add an egg to every pint basin of food made. At night the mother puts the food into the covered pan of her lamp, instead of the saucepan—that is, enough for one supply, and, having hghted the rush, she will find, on the waking of her child, the food sufficiently hot to bear the cooling addition of the milk. But, whether night or da}'-, the same food should never be heated twice, and what the child leaves shQuld be thrown away. 2505. The biscuit powder is used in the same manner as the farinaceous food, and both prepared much after the fashion of making starch. But when tops-and-bottoms, or the whole biscuit, are employed, they require soaking in cold water for some time previous to boiling. The biscuit or biscuits are then to be slowly boiled in as much water as will, when thoroughly soft, allow of their being beaten by a three-pronged fork into a fine, smooth, and even pulp, and which, when poured into a basin and become cold, will cut out like a custard. If two large biscuits have been so treated, and the child is six or seven months old, beat up two eggs, sufficient sugar to properly sweeten it, and about a pint of skim milk. Pour this on the beaten biscuit in the saucepan, stirring con- stantly ; boil for about five minutes, pour into a basin, and use, when cold, in the same manner as the other. 3x2EOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT. 1014 2506. This makes an admirable food, at once nutritious and strengthening. Wlien tops-and-bottoms or rusks are used, the quantity of the egg may be reduced, or altogether omitted. 2507. Semolina, or manna croup, being in little hard grains, like a fine millet-seed, must be boiled for some time, and the milk, sugar, and egg added to it on the fire, and boiled for a few minutes longer, and, when cold, used aa the other preparations. 2508. Many persons entertain a belief that cow's milk is hurtful to infants, and, consequently, refrain from giving it; but this is a very great mistake, for both sugar and milk should form a large portion of every meal an infant takes. TEETHINa AND CONVULSIONS. Fits, &c., the consequence of Dentition, and how to be treated.— The number and order of the Teeth, and manner in which they are cut.—First and Second Set. 2509. About three months after birth, the infant's troubles may be said to begin ; teeth commence forming in the gums, causing pain and irritation in the mouth, and which, but for the saliva it causes to flow so abundantl}?-, would be attended with very serious consequences. At the same time the mother frequently relaxes in the punctuality of the regimen imposed on her,, and, taking some unusual or different food, excites diarrhoja or irritation in her child's stomach, which not unfrequently results in a rash on the skiu, or slight febrile symptoms, which, if not subdued in their outset, superinduce some more serious form of infantine disease. But, as a general rule, the teeth are the primary cause of much of the child's sufferings, in consequence of the state of nervous and functional irritation into which the system is thrown by their formation and progress out of the jaw and through the gums. We propose beginning this branch of our subject with that most fertile source of an infant's suffering— Teething. 2510. That this subject may be better understood by the nurse and mother, and the reason of the constitutional disturbance that, to a greater or less degree, is experienced by all infants, may be made intelligible to those who have the care of children, we shall commence by giving a brief account of the formation, of the teeth, the age at which they appear in the mouth, and the order in which they pierce the gums. The organs of mastication in the adult consist of 32 distinct teeth, 16 in either jaw ; being, in fact, a double set. The teeth are divided into 4 incisors, 2 canine, 4 first and second grinders, and 6 molars ; but in childhood the complement or first set consists of only twenty, and these only make their appearance as the development of the frame indicates the1C45 KEARINO, ETC., OF CHILDREN. requirement of a different kind of food for the support of the system. At birth some of the first-cut teeth are found in the cavities of the jaw, in a very small and rudimentary form; but this is by no means universal. About the third month, the jaws, which arc hollow and divided into separate cells, begin to expand, making room for the slowly developing teeth, which, arranged for beauty and economy of space lengthwise, gradually turn their tops upwards, piercing the gum by their edges, which, being sharp, assist in cutting a passage through the soft parts. There is no particular period at which children cut their teeth, some being remarkably early, and others equally late. The earliest age that we have ever ourselves known as a reliable fact was, six %veelcs. Such peculiari- ties are generally hereditary, and, as in this case, common to a whole family. The two extremes are probably reiDresented by six and sixteen months. Pain and drivelling are the usual, but by no means the general, indications of teething. 2511. About the sixth month the gums become tense and swollen, presenting a red, shiny appearance, while the salivary glands pour out an unusual quantity of saliva. After a time, a white line or round spot is observed on the top of one part of the gums, and the sharp edge of the tooth may be felt beneath if the finger is gently pressed on the part. Through these white spots the teeth burst their way in the following order :— 2512. Two incisors in the lower jaw are first cut, though, in general, some weeks elapse between the appearance of the first and the advent of the second. The next teeth cut are the four incisors of the upper jaw. The next in order are the remaining two incisors of the bottom, one on each side, then two top and two bottom on each side, but not joining the incisors ; and lastly, about the eighteenth or twentieth month, the four eye teeth, filling up the space left between the side teeth and the incisors ; thus completing the infant's set of sixteen. Sometimes at the same period, but more frequently some months later, four more double teeth slowly make their appearance, one on each side of each jaw, completing the entire series of the child's first sot of twenty teeth. It is asserted that a child, while cutting its teeth, should either dribble exces- sivel}'-, vomit after every meal, or be greatly relaxed. Though one or other, or all of these at once, may attend a case of teething, it by no means follows that any one of them should accompany this process of nature, though there can be no doubt that where the pain consequent on the unyielding state of the gums, and the firmness of the skin that covers the tooth, is severe, a copious discharge of saliva acts beneficially in saving the head, and also in guarding the child from those dangerous attacks of fits to which many children in their teething are liable. 2513. The Symptoms that generally indicate the cutting of teeth, in addition to the inflamed and swollen state of the gums, and increased flow of saliva, are the restless and peevish state of the child, the hands being thrust into the mouth, and the evident pleasure imparted by rubbing the finger or nail gently1046 HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT. along the gum ; the lips are often excoriated, and the functions of the stomach or bowels are out of order. In severe cases, occurring in unhealthy or scro- fulous children, there are, from the first, considerable fever, disturbed sleep, fretfulness, diarrhoea, rolling of the eyes, convulsive startings, laborious breathing, coma, or unnatural sleep, ending, unless the head is quickly re- lieved, in death. 2514. The Treatment in all cases of painful teething is remarkably simple, and consists in keeping the body cool by mild aperient medicines, allaying the irritation in the gums by friction with a rough ivory ring or a stale crust of bread, and when the head, lungs, or any organ is overloaded or unduly excited, to use the hot bath, and by throwing the body into a perspiration, equalize the circulation, and relieve the system from the danger of a fatal termination. 2515. Besides these, there is another means, but that must be employed by a medical man; namely, scarifying the gums—an operation always safe, and which, when judiciously performed, and at a critical opportunity, will often snatch the child from the grasp of death. 2516. There are few subjects on which mothers have often formed such strong and mistaken opinions as on that of lancing an infant's gums, some rather seeing their child go into fits—and by the unrelieved irritation en- dangering inflammation of the brain, water on the head, rickets, and other lingering affections—than permit the surgeon to afford instant relief by cutting through the hard skin, which, like a bladder over the stopper of a bottle, effectually confines the tooth to the socket, and prevents it piercing the soft, spongy substance of the gum. This prejudice is a great error, as we shall pre- sently show; for, so far from hurting the child, there is nothing that will so soon convert an infant's tears into smiles as scarifying the gums in painful teething ; that is, if effectually done, and the skin of the tooth be divided. 2517. Though teething is a natural function, and to an infant in perfect health should be unproductive of pain, yet in general it is not only a fertile cause of suffering, but often a source of alarm and danger; the former, from irritation in the stomach and bowels, deranging the whole economy of the system, and the latter, from coma and fits, that may excite alarm in severe cases ; and the danger, that eventuates in some instances, from organic disease of the head or spinal marrow. j 2518. We shall say nothing in this place of "rickets,^' or "water on the head," which are frequent results of dental irritation, but proceed to finish our remarks on the treatment of teething. Though strongly advocating the lancing of the gums in teething, and when there are any severe head-symptoms, yet it should never be needlessly done, or before being satisfied that the tooth is fully formed, and is out of the socket, and under the gum. When assured on these1017 EEABING, ETC., OF CHILDREN. points, the gum should be cut lengthwise, and from the top of the gum down- wards to the tooth, in an horizontal direction, thus , and for about half an inch in length. The operation is then to be repeated in a transverse direction, cutting across the gum, in the centre of the first incision, and forming a cross, thus +. The object of this double incision is to insure a retraction of the cut parts, and leave an open way for the tooth to start from—an advantage not to be obtained when only one incision is made ; for unless the tooth immediately follows the lancing, the opening reunites, and the operation has to be repeated. That this operation is very little or not at all painful, is evidenced by the sud- denness with which the infant falls asleep after the lancing, and awakes in apparently perfect health, though immediately before the use of the gum- lancet, the child may have been shrieking or in convulsions. Convulsions, or Infantine Fits. 2519. From their birth till after teething, infants are more or less subject or liable to sudden fits, which often, without any assignable cause, will attack the child in a moment, and while in the mother's arms ; and which, according to their frequency, and the age and strength of the infant, are either slight or dangerous. 2520. Whatever may have been the remote cause, the immediate one is some irritation of the nervous system, causing convulsions, or an effusion to the head, inducing coma. In the first instance, the infant cries out with a quick, short scream, rolls up its eyes, arches its body backwards, its arms become bent and fixed, and the fingers parted ; the lips and eyelids assume a dusky leaden colour, while the face remains pale, and the eyes open, glassy, or staring. This condition may or may not be attended with muscular twitchings of the mouth, and convulsive plunges of the arms. The fit generally lasts from one to three minutes, when the child recovers with a sigh, and the relaxation of the body. In the other case, the infant is attacked at once with total insensi- bility and relaxation of the limbs, coldness of the body and suppressed breath- ing ; the eyes, when open, being dilated, and presenting a dim glistening appearance ; the infant appearing, for the moment, to be dead. 2521. Treatment.—The first step in either case is, to immerse the child in a hot bath up to the chin ; or if sufficient hot water cannot be procured to cover the body, make a hip-bath of what can be obtained; and, while the left hand supports the child in a sitting or recumbent position, with the right scoop up the water, and run it over the chest of the patient. When sufficient water can be obtained, the spine should be briskly rubbed while in the bath ; when this cannot be done, lay the child on the knees, and with the fingers dipped in brandy, rub the whole length of the spine vigorously for two or three minutes, and when restored to consciousness, give occasionally a tea- spoonful of weak brandy and water or wine and water. 2522. An hour after the bath, it may be necessary to give an aperientHOUSEHOLD MANAGEMEKT. 1018 powder, possibly also to repeat the dose for once or twice every three hours ; in which case the following prescription is to be employed. Take or Powdered scammony . . , 6 grains. Grey powder . , « . , 6 grains. Antimonial powder , • . , 4 grains. Lump sugar , , , . , 20 grains. Mix thoroughly, and divide into three powders, which are to be taken as ad- vised for an infant one year old ; for younger or weakly infants, divide into four powders, and give as the other. For thirst and febrile symptoms, give drinks of barley-water, or cold water, and every three hours put ten to fifl eea drops of spirits of sweet nitre in a dessert-spoonful of either beverage. THBUSH, AlvTD ITS TREATMENT. 2523. This is a disease to which infants are peculiarly subject, and in whom alone it may be said to be a disease ; for when thrush shows itself in adult or advanced life, it is not as a disease proper, but only as a symptom, or accessory, of some other ailment, generally of a chronic character, and should no more be classed as a separate affection than the petechsg, or dark-coloured spots that appear in malignant measles, may be considered a distinct affection. 2524. Thrush is a disease of the follicles of the mucous membrane of the alimentary canal, whereby there are formed small vesicles, or bladders, filled with a thick mucous secretion, which, bursting, discharge their contents, and form minute ulcers in the centre of each vessel. To make this formal but unavoidable description intelligible, we must beg the reader's patience while v/e briefly explain terms that may appear to many so unmeaning, and make the pathology of thrush fully familiar. -2525. The whole digestive canal, of which the stomach and bowels are only a ipart, is covered, from the lips, eyes, and ears downwards, with a thin glairy tissue, like the skin that lines the inside of an egg, called the mucous membrane ; this membrane is dotted all over, in a state of health, by im- perceptible points, called follicles, through which the saliva, or mucus secreted by the membrane, is poured out. 2526. These follicles, or little glands, then, becoming enlarged, and filled with a congealed fluid, constitute thrush in its first stage; and when the child's lips and mouth appear a mass of small pearls, then, as these break and discharge, the second stage, or that of ulceration, sets in. 2527. Symptoms.—Thrush is generally preceded by considerable irritation, by the child crying and fretting, showing more than ordinary redness of the1019 IlEAPJ^'G, ETC., OF CHILDREN. lips imd nostrils, hot fetid breath, with relaxed bowels, and dark feculent evacuations; the water is scanty and high-coloured ; whilst considerable diflSculty in swallowing, and much thirst, are the other symptoms, which a careful observation of the little patient makes manifest. 2528. The situation and character of thrush show at once that the cause is some irritation of the mucous membrane, and can proceed only from the nature and quality of the food. Before weaning, this must be looked for in the mother, and the condition of the milk ; after that time, in the crude and indigestible nature of the food given. In either case, this exciting cause of the disease must be at once stopped. When it proceeds from the mother, it is always best to begin by physicking the infant through the parent; that is to say, let the parent first take the medicine, which will sufficiently affect the child through the milk : this plan has the double object of benefiting the patient and, at the same time, correcting the state of the mother, and ini- l^roving the condition of her milk. In the other case, when the child is being- fed by hand, then proceed by totally altering the style of aliment given, and substituting faiinaceous food, custards, blanc-mange, and ground-rico puddings. 2529. As an aperient medicine for the mother, the best thing she can tako is a dessert-spoonful of carbonate of magnesia once or twice a day, in a cup of cold water; and every second day, for two or three times, an aperient pill. 2530. As the thrush extends all over the mouth, throat, stomach, and bowels, the irritation to the child from such an extent of diseased surface is proportionately great, and before attempting to act on such a tender surface by opening medicine, the better plan is to soothe by an emollient mixture ; and^ for that purpose, let the following be prepared. Take of Castor oil , 2 drachms. Sugar ... . , . . 1 drachm. Mucilage, or pov\rdered gum Arabic . half a drachm. Triturate till the oil is incorporated, then add slowly— Mint-water One ounce and a half. Laudanum Ten drops. Half a teaspoonful three times a day, to an infant from one to two years old ; a teaspoonful from two to three years old ; and a dessert-spoonful at any ago over that time. After two days' use of the mixture, one of the following powders should be given twice a day, accompanied with one dose daily of the mixture :— Grey powder ...... 20 grains. Powdered rhubarb 15 grains. Scammony 10 grains. Mir. Divide irxto twelve j)owders, for one year ; eight powders, from one to two ;HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT. 1050 nnd six powders, from two to six years old. After that age, double tho strength, by giving the quantity of two powders at once. 2531. It is sometimes customary to apply borax and honey to the mouth for thrush; but it is always better to treat the disease constitutionally rather than locally. The first steps, therefore, to be adopted are, to remove or correct the exciting cause—the mother's milk or food; allay irritation by a warm bath and the castor-oil mixture, tbllowed by and conjoined with the powders. 2532. To those, however, who wish to try the honey process, the best pre- paration to use is the following :—Rub down one ounce of honey with two drachms of tincture of myrrh, and apply it to the lips and mouth every four or six hours. 2533. It is a popular belief, and one most devoutly cherished by many mirses and elderly persons, that everybody must, at some time of their life, between birth and death, have an attack of thrush, and if not in infancy, or prime of life, it will surely attack them on their death-bed, in a form more malignant than if the patient had been affected with the malady earlier ; the black thrush with which they are then reported to be affected being, in all probability, the petechse, or purple spots that characterize the worst form, and often the last stage, of typhoid fever. 2534. In general, very little medicine is needed in this disease of the thrush —an alterative powder, or a little magnesia, given once or twice, being all, with the warm bath, that, in the great majority of cases, is needed to restore the mucous membrane to health. As thrush is caused by an excess of heat, or over-action in the lining membrane of the stomach and bowels, whatever will counteract this state, by throvdng the heat on the surface, must ma- terially benefit, if not cure, the disease: and that means every mother has at hand, in the form of a imrm lath. After the application of this, a little magnesia to correct the acidity existing along the surface of the mucous membrane, is often all that is needed to throw the system into such a state as will effect its own cure. This favourable state is indicated by an excessive flow of saliva, or what is called " dribbling," and by a considerable amount of relaxation of the bowels—a condition that must not be mistaken for diarrhoea, and checked as if a disease, but rather, for the day or two it continues, encouraged as a critical evacuant. 2535. Should there be much debility in the convalescence, half a tea- spoonful of stee wine, given twice a day in a little barley-water, will be found sufficient for all the purposes of a tonic. This, with the precaution of changing the child's food, or, when it lives on the mother, of correcting the quality of the milk by changing her own diet, and, by means of an antacid or aperient, improving the state of the secretion. Such is all the treatment that this disease in general requires.REARING, ETC., OF CniLDREN. 1051 2536. The class of diseases we are now approacliing are the most important, Doth in their pathological features and in then- consequences on the consti- tution, of any group or individual disease that assails the human body; and though more frequently attacking the undeveloped frame of childhood, are yet by no means confined to that period. These are called Eruptive Fevers, and embrace chicken-pox, cow-pox, small-pox, scarlet fever, measles, milary fever, and erysipelas, or St. Anthony's fire. 2537. The general character of all these is, that they are contagious, and, aa a general rule, attack a person only once in his lifetime ; that their chain of diseased actions always begins with fever, and that, after an interval of from one to four days, the fever is followed by an eruption of the skin. CHICKEN-POX, OB GLASS-POX; AISTD COW-POX, OR VACCUnTATIOI^'. 2538. CniCKEN-rox, or Glass-pox, may, in strict propriety, be classed as a mild variety of small-pox, presenting all the mitigated symptoms of that formidable disease. Among many physicians it is, indeed, classed as small- pox, and not a separate disease; but as this is not the place to discuss such questions, and as we profess to give only facts, the result of our own practical experience, we shall treat this affection of glass-pox or chicken-pox, as we ourselves have found it, as a distinct and separate disease. 2539. Chicken-pox is marked by all the febrile symptoms presented by small- pox, with this difference, that, in the case of chicken-pox, each symptom is particularly slight. The heat of body is much less acute, and the principal symptoms are difficulty of breathing, headache, coated tongue, and nausea, which sometimes amounts to vomiting. After a term of general irritability, heat, and restlessness, about the fourth day, or between the third and fourth, an eruption makes its appearance over the face, neck, and body, in its first two stages closely resembling small-pox, with this especial difference, that whereas the pustules in small-pox havG flat and depressed centres—aninfaUible characteristic of small-pox—the pustules in chicken-pox remain glolular, while the fluid in them changes from a transparent white to a straw-coloured liquid, which begins to exude and disappear about the eighth or ninth day, and, in mild cases, by the twelfth desquamates, or peels off entirely. 2540. There can be no doubt that chicken-pox, hke small-pox, is contagious, and under certain states of the atmosphere becomes endemic. Parents should, therefore, avoid exposing young children to the danger of infection by taking them where it is known to exist, as chicken-pox, in weakly constitutions, or in very young children, may superinduce small-pox, the one disease either running concurrently with the other, or discovering itself as the other declines. This,HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT. 1052 of course, is a condition tliat renders the case very bazardous, as the child lias to struggle against two diseases at once, or before it has recruited strength from the attack of the first. 2541. Treatment.—In all ordinary cases of chicken-pox—and it is very seldom it assumes any complexity—the whole treatment resolves itself into the use of the warm bath, and a course of gentle aperients. The bath should be used when the oppression of the lungs renders the breathing difficult, or the heat and dryness of the skin, with the undeveloped rash beneath the esurface, shows the necessity for its use. 2542. As the pustules in chicken-pox very rarely run to the state of suppura- tion, as in the other disease, there is no fear of intling or disfigurement, except in very severe forms, which, however, happen so seldom as not to merit apprc- Jiension. When the eruption subsides, however, the face may be washed with elder-flower water, and the routine followed which is prescribed in the con- valescent state of small-pox. 2543. Cow-pox, properly speaking, is an artificial disease, established in a healthy body as a prophylactic, or preventive agent, against the more serious attack of small-pox, and is merely that chain of slight febrile symptoms and local irritation, consequent on the specific action of the lymph of the vaccina- tion, in its action on the circulating system of the bodj^ This is not the place to speak of the benefits conferred on mankind by the discovery of vaccination, not only as the preserver of the human features from a most loathsome dis- figurement, but as a sanitary agent in the prolongation of life. 2544. Fortunately the State has now made it imperative on all parents to have their children vaccinated before, or by the end of, the twelfth week; thus doing away, as far as possible, with the danger to public health proceeding from the ignorance or prejudice of those parents whose want of information on the subject makes them object to the employment of this specific preventive ; for though vaccination has been proved not to be ahvays an infallible guard against small-pox, the attack is always much lighter, should it occur, and is seldom, if indeed ever, fatal after the precaution of vaccination. The best time to vac- cinate a child is after the sixth and before the twelfth week, if it is in perfect health, but still earlier if small-pox is prevalent, and any danger exists of tho infant taking the disease. It is custom.ary, and always advisable, to give the child a mild aperient powder one or two days before inserting the lymph in tho arm ; and should measles, scarlet fever, or any other disease arise during tho progress of the pustule, the child, when recovered, should be re-vaccinated, and the lymph taken from its arm on no account used for vaccinating purposes. 2545. The disease of cow-pox generally takes twenty days to complete its course; in other words, the maturity and declension of the pustule takes thatREARING, ETC., OF CHILDREN. 1053 time to fulfil its several changes. The mode of vaccination is either to insert the matter, or lymph, taken from a healthy child, under the cuticle in several places on both arms, or, which is still better, to make three slight scratches, or abrasions, with a lancet on one arm in this manner, ^/'^^ and work into tlio Irritated parts the lymph, allowing the arm to dry thoroughly before putting- down the infant's sleeve ; by this means absorption is insured, and the unne- cessary pain of several pustules on both arms avoided. No apparent change is observable by the eye for several days; indeed, not till the fourth, in many cases, is there any evidence of a vesicle ; about the fifth day, however, a pink areola, or circle, is observed round one or all of the places, surrounding a small pearly vesicle or bladder. This goes on deepening in hue till the seventh or eighth day, when the vesicle is about an inch in diameter, with a depressed centre ; on the ninth the edges are elevated, and the surrounding part hard and inflamed. The disease is now at its height, and the pustule should be opened, if not for the purpose of vaccinating other children, to allow the escape of the lymph, and subdue the inflammatory action. After the twelfth day the centro is covered by a brown scab, and the colour of the swelling becomes darker, gradually declining in hardness and colour till the twentieth, when the scab falls off, leaving a small pit, or cicatrix, to mark the seat of the disease, and for life prove a certificate of successful vaccination. 2546. In some children the inflammation and swelling of the arm is excessive,, and extremely painful, and the fever, about the ninth or tenth day, very high ; the pustule, therefore, at that time, should sometimes be opened, the arm fomented every two hours wdth a warm bread poultice, and an aperient powder given to the infant. MEASLES AND SCAKLET FEVEK, WITH THE TBEATMENT OF BOTH. Measles. 2547. This much-dreaded disease, which forms the next subject in our series^ of infantine diseases, and which entails more evils on the health of childhood, than any other description of physical suffering to which that age of life is subject, may be considered more an affection of the venous circulation, tending to general and local congestion, attended with a diseased condition of; the blood, than either as a fever or an inflammation ; and though generally classed before or after scarlet fever, is, in its pathology and treatment, irre- spective of its .after-consequences, as distinct and opposite as one disease can well be from another. 2548. As we have already observed, measles are always characterized by tho running at the nose and eyes, and great oppression of breathing ; so, in the mode of treataient, two objects are to be held especially in view; first, to1051 HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT. unload the congested state of the lungs,—the cause of the oppressed breathing; and, secondly, to act vigorously, both during the disease and afterwards, on the bowels. At the same time it cannot be too strongly borne in mind, that though the patient in measles should on no account be kept unduly hot, more care than in most infantine complaints should be taken to guard the body from cold, or any abrupt changes of temperature. With these special observations, we shall proceed to give a description of the disease, as recog- nized by its usual— 2549. Spnptoms, which commence with cold chills and flushes, lassitude, heaviness, pain in the head, and drowsiness, cough, hoarseness, and extreme difficulty of breathing, frequent sneezing, defluction or running at the eyes and nose, nausea, sometimes vomiting, thirst, a furred tongue; the imhe throughout is quick, and sometimes full and soft, at others hard and small, with other indications of an inflammatory nature. 2550. On the third day, small red points make their appearance, first on the face and neck, gradually extending over the upper and lower part of the body. On the fifth day, the vivid red of the eruption changes into a brownish hue ; and, in two or three days more, the rash entirely disappears, leaving a loose powdery desquamation on the skin, which rubs ofl* like dandrifi". At this stage of the disease a diarrhoea frequently comes on, which, being what is called critical," should never be checked, unless seriously severe. Measles some- times assume a typhoid or malignant character, in which form the symptoms are all greatly exaggerated, and the case from the first becomes both doubtful and dangerous. In this condition the eruption comes out sooner, and only in patches; and often, after showing for a few hours, suddenly recedes, pre- senting, instead of the usual florid red, a dark purple or blackish hue ; a dark brown fur forms on the gums and mouth, tne breathing becomes laborious, delirium supervenes, and, if unrelieved, is followed by coma ; a fetid diarrhoea takes place, and the patient sinks under the congested state of the lungs and the oppressed functions of the brain. 2551. The unfavourable symptoms in measles are a high degree of fever, the excessive heat and dryness of the skin, hurried and short breathing, and a X^articularly hard pulse. The sequelae, or after-consequences, of measles are, croup, bronchitis, mesenteric disease, abscesses behind the ear, ophthalmia, and glandular swellings in other parts of the body. 2552. Treatment.—In the first place, the patient should be kept in a cool room, the temperature of which must be regulated to suit the child's feelings of comfort, and the diet adapted to the strictest principles of abstinence. When the inflammatory symptoms are severe, bleeding, in some form, is often necessary, though, when adopted, it must be in the/r^i ^to^^e of the disease ; and, if the lungs are the apprehended seat of the inflammation, two or more leeches, according to the age and strength oi the patient, must be applied toREARING, ETC., OP CniLDREN. 1055 the upper part of the chest, followed by a small blister ; or the blister may be substituted for the leeches, the attendant bearing in mind, that the benefit effected by the blister can always be considerably augmented by plunging the feet into very hot water about a couple of hours after applying the blister, and kept in the water for about two minutes. And let it further be remembered, that this immersion of the feet in hot water may be adopted at any time or stage of the disease : and that, whenever the head or Iwigs are oppressed, relief will always accrue from its sudden and brief employment. When the symptoms commence with much shivering, and the skin early assumes a hot, dry character, the appearance of the rash will be facilitated, and all the other symptoms rendered milder, if the patient is put into a warm bath, and kept in the water for about three minutes. Or, v/here that is not con- venient, the following process, which will answer quite as well, can be substi- tuted :—Stand the child, naked, in a tub, and, having first prepared several jugs of sufficiently warm water, empty them, in quick succession, over the patient's shoulders and body; immediately wrap in a hot blanket, and put the child to bed till it rouses from the sleep that always follows the efFusicn or bath. This agent, by lowering the temperature of the skin, and opening the pores, producing a natural perspiration, and unloading the congested state of the lungs, in most cases does away entirely with the necessity both for leeches and a blister. Whether any of these external means have been employed or not, the first internal remedies should commence with a series of aperient powders and a saline mixture, as prescribed in the following formrdaries ; at the same time, as a beverage to quench the thirst, let a quantity of barley- water be made, slightly acidulated by the juice of an orange, and partially sweetened by some sugar-candy; and of which, when properly made and cold, let the patient drink as often as thirst, or the dryness of the mouth, renders necessary. 2553. A'pevient Powders.—Take of scammony and jalap, each 24 grains ; grey powder and powdered antimony, each 18 grains. Mix and divide into 12 powders, if for a child between two and four years of age ; into 8 powders, if for a child between four and eight years of age; and into 6 powders for between eight and twelve years. One powder to be given, in a little jelly or sugar-and-water, every three or four hours, according to the severity of the symptoms. 2554. Saline Mixture.—Take of mint-water, 6 ounces; powdered nitre, 20 grains ; antimonial wine, 3 drachms ; spirits of nitre, 2 drachms ; syrup of saffron, 2 drachms. Mix. To children under three years, give a teaspoonful every two hours ; from that age to six, a dessertspoonful at the same times; and a tablespoonful every three or four hours to children between six and twelve. 2555. The object of these aperient powders is to keep up a steady but gentle action on the bowels; but, whenever it seems necessary to administer a stronger dose, and effect a brisk action on the digestive organs,—a courseHOUSEHOLD MANAGEJIElsT. particularly imperative towards the close of tlie disease,—two of these powders given at once, according to the age, will be found to produce that effect; that is, two of the twelve for a child under four years, and two of the eight, and two of the six, according to the age of the patient. ^55^- When the difficulty of breathing becomes oppressive, as it generally does towards night, a hot bran poultice, laid on the chest, will be always found highly beneficial. The diet throughout must be light, and consist of farinaceous food, such as rice and sago puddings, beef-tea and toast; and not till convalescence sets in should hard or animal food be given. -557- When measles assume the malignant form, the advice just given must be broken through ; food of a nutritious and stimulating character should bo at once substituted, and administered in conjunction with wine, and even spirits, and the disease regarded and treated as a case of typhus. But, as this form of measles is not frequent, and, if occurring, hardly likely to be treated without assistance, it is unnecessary to enter on the minutice of its practice here. What we have prescribed, in almost all cases, will be found sufficient to meet every emergency, without resorting to a multiplicity of agents. 2558. The great point to remember in measles is, not to give up the treat- ment with the apparent subsidence of the disease, as the after-consequences of measles are too often more serious, and to be more dreaded, than the measles themselves. To guard against this danger, and thoroughly purify the system, after the subsidence of all the symptoms of the disease, a corrective course of medicine, and a regimen of exercise, should be adopted for some weeks after ihe cure of the disease. To effect this, an active aperient powder should be given every three or four days, with a daily dose of the subjoined tonic mix- ture, with as much exercise, by walking, running after a hoop, or other bodily exertion, as the strength of the child and the state of the atmosphere will admit, the patient being, wherever possible, removed to a purer air as soon as convalescence warrants the change. 2559. ^onic Ilixlure.—Take of infusion of rose-leaves, 6 ounces ; quinine, ^ grains; diluted sulphuric acid, 15 drops. Mix. Dose, from half a tea- spoonful up to a dessertspoonful, once a day, according to the age of the patient. Scarlatina, or Scarlet Fever. 2560. Though professional accuracy has divided this disease into several forms, we shall keep to the one disease most generally met with, the common or simple scarlet fever, which, in all cases, is characterized by an excessive heat on the skin, sore throat, and a peculiar speckled appearance of the tongue. 2561. Sym])toms.—Cold chills, shivering, nausea, thirst, hot skin, quick pulse, with difficulty of swallowing; the tongue is coated, presenting through1057 REARING, ETC., OF CniLDREN. Its fur innumerable specks, the elevated papillce of the tongue, which gives it the speckled character, that, if not the invariable sign of scarlet fever, is only met with in cases closely analogous to that disease. Between the second and tldrd day, but most frequently on the third, a bright red efflorescence break; out in patches on the face, neck, and back, from which it extends over the trunk and extremities, always showing thicker and deeper in colour wherever there is any pressure, such as the elbows, back, and hips ; when the eruption is well out, the skin presents the appearance of a boiled lobster-shell. At first, the skin is smooth, but, as the disease advances, perceptible roughness is apparent, from the elevation of the rash, or, more properly, the pores of the skin. On the fftli and sixtli days the eruption begins to decline, and by the eighth has generally entirely disappeared. During the whole of this period, there is, more or less, constant sore throat. •2562. The Treatment 0? sQ^rlQi fever is, in general, very simple. Where tho heat is great, and the eruption comes out with difficulty, or recedes as soon as it appears, the body should be sponged with cold vinegar-and-water, or tepid water, as in measles, poured over the chest and body, the patient being, as in that disease, wrapped in a blanket and put to bed, and the same powders and mixture ordered in measles administered, with the addition of a constant hot bran poultice round the throat, which should be continued from the first symptom till a day or two after the declension of the rash. The same low diet and cooling drink, with the same general instructions, are to be obeyed in this as in the former disease. 2563. When the fever runs high in the first stage, and there is much nausea, before employing the effusions of water, give the patient an emetic, of equal parts of ipecacuanha and antimonial wine, in doses of from a teaspoonful to a tablespoonful, according to age. By these means, nine out of every ten cases of scarlatina may be safely and expeditiously cured, especially if the tem- perature of the patient's room is kept at an even standard of about sixty degrees. HOOPING-COUGH, CBOUP, AND DIARRHCEA, WITH THEIR MODE OP TREATMENT. Hooping-Cough. 2564. This is purely a spasmodic disease, and is only infectious through the faculty of imitation, a habit that all children are remarkably apt to fall into ; and even where adults have contracted hooping-cough, it has been from the same cause, and is as readily accounted for, on the principle of imitation, as that the gaping of one person will excite or predispose a whole party to follow the same spasmodic example. If any one associates for a few days with a person who stammers badly, he will find, when released from his 3 YHOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT. 1058 company, that the sequence of his articulation and the fluency of his speech are, for a time, gone ; and it will be a matter of constant vigilance, and some difficulty, to overcome the evil of so short an association. The manner in which a number of school-girls will, one after another, fall into a fit on beholding one of their number attacked with epilepsy, must be familiar to many. These several facts lead us to a juster notion of how to treat this spasmodic disease. Every effort should, therefore, be directed, mentally and physically, to break the chain of nervous action, on which the continuance of the cough depends. 2565. Symptoms.—Hooping-cough comes on with a slight oppression of breath- ing, thirst, quick pulse, hoarseness, and a hard, dry cough. This state may exist without any change from one to two or three weeks before the peculiar feature of the disease—the /iOOj?—sets in. As the characteristics of this cough are known to all, it is unnecessary to enter here, physiologically, on the subject. We shall, therefore, merely remark that the frequent vomiting and bleeding at the mouth or nose are favourable signs, and proceed to the 2566. TreatTiuntj which should consist in keeping up a state of nausea and vomiting. For this purpose, give the child doses of ipecacuanha and antimo- nial wines, in equal parts, and quantities varying from half to one and a half teaspoonful once a day, or, when the expectoration is hard and difficult of ex- pulsion, giving the following cough mixture every four hours. Take of • Syrup of squills . . ♦ . § ounce. Antimonial wine • • , , 1 ounce. Laudanum . • • , .15 drops. Syrup of Toulou • • • .2 drachms. Water ...... IJ ounce. Mix. The dose is from half a spoonful to a dessertspoonful. When the cough is urgent, the warm bath is to be used, and either one or two leeches applied over the breastbone, or else a small blister laid on the lower part of the throat. 2567. Such is the medical treatment of hooping-cough; but there is a moral regimen, based on the nature of the disease, which should never be omitted. And, on the principle that a sudden start or diversion of the mind will arrest a person in the act of sneezing or gaping, so the like means should be adopted with the hooping-cough patient; and, in the first stage, before the liooping has been added, the parent should endeavour to break the paroxysm of the cough by abruptly attracting the patient's attention, and thus, if possible, preventing the cough from reaching that height when the ingulp of air gives the hoop or crow that marks the disease ; but when once that symptom has set in, it becomes still more necessary to endeavour, by even measures of intimida- tion, to break the spasmodic chain of the cough. Exercise in the open air, "when dry, is also requisite, and charge of scene and air in all cases is of abso- lute necessity, and may be adopted at any stage of the disease.BEARING, ETC., OF CHILDREN. 1059 Croup. 2568. This is by far the most formidable and fatal of all the diseases to which infancy and childhood arc liable, and is purely an inflammatory affection, attacking that portion of the mucous membrane lining the windpipe and bron- chial tubes, and from the effect of which a false or loose membrane is formed along the windpipe, resembling in appearance the finger of a glove suspended in the passage, and, consequently, terminating the life of the patient by suffo- cation ; for, as the lower end grows together and becomes closed, no air can enter the lungs, and the child dies choked. All dull, fat, and heavy children are peculiarly predisposed to this disease, and those with short necks and who make a wheezing noise in their natural breathing. Croup is always sudden in its attack, and rapid in its career, usually proving fatal within three days; most frequently commences in the night, and generally attacking children between the ages of three and ten years. Mothers should, therefore, be on their guard who have children predisposed to this disease, and immediately resort to the means hereafter ad\ised. 2569. Symptoms.—Languor and restlessness, hoarseness, wheezing, and short, dry cough, with occasional rattling in the throat during sleep, the child often plucking at its throat with its fingers ; difficulty of breathing, which quickly becomes hard and laboured, causing great anxiety of the countenance, and the veins of the neck to swell and become knotted; the voice in speaking acquii-es a sharp, crowing, or croupy sound, while the inspirations have a harsh, metallic intonation. After a few hom^s, a quantity of thick, ropy mucus is thrown out, hanging about the mouth, and cavreing suffocating fits of coughing to expel. 2570. Treatment.—Place the child immediately in a hot bath up to the throat; and, on removal from the water, give an emetic of the antimonial or ipecacu- anha wine, and, when the vomiting has subsided, lay a long blister down the front of the throat, and administer one of the following powders every twenty minutes to a child from three to six years of age. 2571. Take of calomel, 12 gTains; tartar emetic, 2 grains; lump sugar, 80 grains. Mix accurately, and divide into 12 powders. For a child from six to twelve years, divide into 6 powders, and give one every half-hom\ 2572. Should the symptoms remain unabated after a few hours, apply one or two leeches to the throat, and put mustard poultices to the feet and thighs, retaining them about eight minutes ; and, in extreme cases, a mustard poultice to the spine between the shoulders, and at the same time rub mercurial oint- ment into the armpits and the angles of the jaws. 2573. S^c^ is a vigorous and reliable system of treatment in severe cases of croup ; but, in the milder and more general form, the following abridgment 3 Y 2lOGO HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT. "will, in all probability, be all that will be required First, the hot bath; second, the emetic ; third, a mustard plaster round the throat for five minutes ; fourth, the powders; fifth, another emetic in six hours, if needed, and the powders continued without intermission while the urgency of the symptoms, continues. When relief has been obtained, these are to be discontinued, and a dose of senna tea given to act on the bowels. Diarrhoea. 2574. The diarrhoea with which children are so frequently affected, especially in infancy, should demand the nurse's immediate attention, and when the secretion, from its clayey colour, indicates an absence of bile, a powder com- posed of 3 grains of grey powder and 1 grain of rhubarb, should be given twice, with an interval of four hours between each dose, to a child from one to two years, and, a day or two afterwards, an aperient powder containing the same ingredients and quantities, with the addition of 2 or 3 grains of scammony. For the relaxation consequent on an overloaded stomach, or acidity in the bowels, a little magnesia dissolved in milk should be employed two or threo times a day. 2575. When much griping and pain attend the diarrhoea, half a teaspoonful of Dalby*s Carminative (the best of all patent medicines) should be given, either with or without a small quantity of castor oil to carry off the exciting cause. 2576. For any form of diarrhoea that, by excessive action, demands a speedy correction, the most efiicacious remedy that can be employed in all ages and conditions of childhood is the tincture of Kino, of which from 10 to 30 drops, mixed with a little sugar and water in a spoon, are to be given every two or three hours till the undue action has been checked. Often the change of diet to rice, milk, eggs, or the substitution of animal for vegetable food, or vice versdi will correct an unpleasant and almost chronic state of diarrhoea. 2577. A very excellent carminative powder for flatulent infants may be kept in the house, and employed with advantage, whenever the child is in pain or griped, by dropping 5 grains of oil of aniseed and 2 of peppermint on hall an ounce of lump sugar, and rubbing it in a mortar, with a drachm of mag- nesia, into a fine powder. A small quantity of this may be given in a littld water at any time, and always with benefit.THE DOCTOE. CHAPTER XLIII. ^578. " Time," according to the old proverb, " is 'money and it may also, in many cases, and with equal truthfulness, be said to be life ; for a few moments, in great emergencies, often turn the balance between recovery and death. This apiDlies more especially to all kinds of poisoning, fits, submer- sion in water, or exposure to noxious gases ; and many accidents. If people linew how to act during the interval that must necessarily elapse from the moment that a medical man is sent for until he arrives, many lives might bo saved, which now, unhappily, are lost. Generally speaking, however, nothing- is done—all is confusion and fright; and the surgeon, on his arrival, finds that death has already seized its victim, who, had his friends but known a few rough rules for their guidance, might have been rescued. We shall, therefore, in a series of papers, give such information as to the means to bo employed in event of accidents, injuries, &c., as, by the aid of a gentleman of large professional experience, we are warranted in recommending. List of Drugs, &c., necessary to carry out all Instructions. 2579. We append at once A List of Drugs, &c., and a few Prescriptions necessary to carry out all the instructions given in this series of articles. It will be seen that they are few—they are not expensive ; and by laying in a little stock of them, our instructions will be of instant value in all cases of accident, &c.—The drugs are—Antimonial Wine. Antimonial Powder. Blister Compound. Blue Pill. Calomel. Carbonate of Potash. Compound Iron Pills. Compound Extract of Colocyntb. Compound Tincture of Cam- phor. Epsom Salts. Goulard's Extract. Jalap in Powder. Linseed Oil. Myrrh and Aloes Pills. Nitre. Oil of Turpentine. Opium, powdered, and Laudanum. Sal Ammoniac. Senna Leaves. Soap Liniment, Opodeldoc. Sweet Spirits of Nitre. Turner's Cerate.—To which should be added : Com- mon Adhesive Plaster. Isinglass Plaster. Lint. A pair of small Scales with Weights. An ounce and a drachm Measure-glass. A Lancet, A Probe. A pair of Forceps, and some curved Needles. 2580. The following Prescriptions may be made up for a few shillings ; and, by keeping them properly labelled, and by referring to the remarks onHOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT. 1062 the treatment of any iDarticular case, much sufifering, and, perhaps, some lives, may be say.^d. 2581* Draught.—Twenty grains of sulphate of zinc in an ounce and a half of water. This draught is to be repeated in a quarter of an hour if vomiting does not take place. 2582. Clyster,—Two tablespoonfuls of oil of turpentine in a pint of warm gruel. 2583. Liniments.—1. Equal parts of lime-water and linseed-oil well mixed together. [Lime-water is made thus: Pour 6 pints of boiling water upon \ lb. of lime; mix well together, and when cool, strain the liquid from off the lime which has fallen to the bottom, taking care to get it as clear as possible.] 2. Compound camphor liniment. 2584. Lotions.—1. Mix a dessert-si30onful of Goulard's extract and 2 tablespoonfuls of vinegar in a pint of water.—2. Mix ^ oz. of sal-ammoniac, 2 tablespoonfuls of vinegar, and the same quantity of gin or whisky, in half a pint of water, 2585. Goulard Lotion.—1 drachm of sugar of lead, 2 pints of rain-w^ater, 2 teaspoonfuls of spirits of wine. For inflammation of the eyes or else- where :—The better way of making Goulard Lotion, if for the eyes, is to add to 6 oz. of distilled water, or water that has been well boiled, 1 drachm of the extract of lead. 2586. Opodeldoc. — This lotion being a valuable application for sprains, lumbago, weakness of joints, &c., and it being difficult to procure either pure or freshly made, wo give a recipe for its preparation. Dissolve 1 oz. of camphor in a pint of rectified spirits of wine; then dissolve 4 oz. of hard white Spanish soap, scraped thin, in 4 oz. of oil of rosemary, and mix them together. 2587. The Common Black Draught.—Infusion of senna 10 drachms; Epsom salts 10 drachms; tincture of senna, compound tincture of cardamums, compound spirit of lavender, of each 1 drachm. Families who make black draught in quantity, and wish to preserve it for some time without spoiling, should add about 2 drachms of spirits of hartshorn to each pint of the strained mixture, the use of this drug being to prevent its becoming mouldy or decom- posed. A simpler and equally efficacious form of black draught is made by infusing ^ oz. of Alexandrian senna, 3 oz. of Epsom salts, and 2 drachms of bruised ginger and coriander-seeds, for several hours in a pint of boiling water, straining the liquor, and adding either 2 drachms of sal-volatile or spirits of hartshorn to the whole, and giving 3 tablespoonfuls for a dose to an adult. 2588. Mixtures—1. Aperient.—Dissolve an ounce of Epsom salts in half a pint of senna tea : take a quarter of the mixture as a dose, and repeat it in three or four hours if necessary.THE DOCTOR. 1063 2589. 2.

Ahernethy's Plan for maJcing a Bread-and-Water Poultice.—First scald out a basin ; then having put in some boiling water, throv/ in coarsely- crumbled bread, and cover it with a plate. When the bread has soaked up as much water as it will imbibe, drain off the remaining water, and there will be left a light pulp. Spread it a third of an inch thick on folded linen, and apply it when of the temperature of a warm bath. To preserve it moist, occasionally drop warm water on it. 2596. Linseed-Meal Poultice.—"Scald your basin, by pouring a little hot water into it; then put a small quantity of finely-ground linseed-meal into the basin, pour a little hot water on it, and stir it round briskly until you have well incorporated them; add a little more meal and a little more water; then stir it again. Do not let any lumps remain in the basin, but stir the poultice well, and do not be sparing of your trouble. What you do next, is to take as much of it out of the basin as you may require, lay it on a piece of soft linen, and let it be about a quarter of an inch thick."—Ahernethy. 2597. Ifiistard Poultice.—Mix equal parts of dry mustard and linseed-meal in warm vinegar. When the poultice is wanted weak, warm water may be used for the vinegar; and when it is required very strong, mustard alone, without any linseed-meal, is to be mixed with warm vinegar, 2598. A 71 ordinary Blister.—Spread a little blister compound on a piece of common adhesive plaster with the right thumb. It should be put on just thickly enough to conceal the appearance of the plaster beneath. The part from which a blister has been taken should be covered till it heals over with soft linen rags smeared with lard.HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT. Baths and Fomentations. 0599. All fluid applications to the body are exhibited either in a hot or cold form ; and the object for which they are administered is to produce a stimu- lating effect over the entire, or a part, of the system ; for the effect, though differently obtained, and varying in degree, is the same in principle, whether procured by hot or cold water. 2600. Heat.—There are three forms in which heat is universally applied to the body,—that of the tepid, warm, and vapour bath; but as the first is too inert to be worth notice, and the last dangerous and inapplicable, except in. public institutions, we shall confine our remarks to the really efiicacious and always attainable one—the 1601, Warm and Hot Bath.—These baths are used whenever there is con- gestion, or accumulation of blood in the internal organs, causing pain, difficulty of breathing, or stupor, and are employed, by their stimulating property, ta cause a rush of blood to the surface, and, by unloading the great organs, pro- duce a temporary inflammation in the skin, and so equalize the circulation. The efl"ect of the hot bath is to increase the fulness of the pulse, accelerate respira- tion, and excite perspiration. In all inflammations of the stomach and bowels, the hot bath is of the utmost consequence ; the temperature of the warm bath varies from 92° to 100°, and may be obtained by those who have no thermo- meter to test the exact heat, by mixing one measure of boiling with two of cold water. 2602. Fomentations are generally used to efiect, in a part, the benefit pro- duced on the whole body by the bath; to which a sedative action is occasion- ally given by the use of roots, herbs, or other ingredients ; the object being to relieve the internal organ, as the throat, or muscles round a joint, by exciting a greater flow of blood to the skin over the affected part. As the real agent of relief is heat, the fomentation should always be as hot as it can comfortably be borne, and, to insure effect, should be repeated every half-hour. Warm fluids are applied in order to render the swelling which accompanies inflamma- tion less painful, by the greater readiness with which the skin yields, than when it is harsh and dry. They are of various kinds; but the most simple, and oftentimes the most useful, that can be employed, is Warm Water.'* Another kind of fomentation is composed of dried poppj^heads, 4 oz. Break them to pieces, empty out the seeds, put them into 4 pints of water, boil for a quarter of an hour, then strain through a cloth or sieve, and keep the water for use. Or, chamomile flowers, hemlock, and many other plants, may be boiled, and the part k>mented with the hot liquor, by means of flannels wetted with the decoction. 2603. Coldf when applied in excess to the body, drives the blood from the^ surface to the centre, reduces the pulse, makes the breathing hard and difficult, produces coma, and, if long continued, death. But when medicinally used, it excites a reaction on the surface equivalent to a stimulating effect; as in somaTHE DOCTOR. 10G5 cases of fever, when the body has been sponged with cold water, it excites, by reaction, increased circulation on the skin. Cold is sometimes used to keep up a repellent action, as, when local inflammation takes place, a remedy is applied, which, by its benumbing and astringent effect, causes the blood, or the excess of it in the part, to recede, and, by contracting the vessels, prevents the return of any undue quantity, till the affected part recovers its tone. Such remedies are called Lotions, and should, when used, be applied with the same persistency as the fomentation ; for, as the latter should be renewed as often as the heat passes off, so the former should be applied as often as the heat from the skin deprives the application of its cold. 2604. Poultices are only another form of fomentation, though chiefly used for abscesses. The ingredient best suited for a poultice is that which retains heat the longest; of these ingredients, the best are hnseed-meal, bran,, and bread. Bran sewed into a bag, as it can bo reheated, will bo found tho cleanest and most useful; especially for sore throats. How to Bleed. 2605. In cases of great emergency, such as the strong kind of apoplexy, and when a surgeon cannot possibly be obtained for some considerable time, the life of the patient depends almost entirely upon the fact of his being bled or not. We therefore give instructions how the operation of bleeding is to be performed, but caution the reader only to attempt it in cases of the greatest emergency. Place a handkerchief or piece of tape rather but not too tightly round the arm, about three or four inches above the elbow. This will cause the veins below to swell and become very evident. If this is not sufficient, the hand should be constantly and quickly opened and shut for the same purpose. There will now be seen, passing up the middle of the fore-arm, a vein w^hich, just below the bend of the elbow, sends a branch inwards and outwards, each branch shortly joining another large vein. It is from the outer branch that the person is to be bled. The right arm is the one mostly operated on. The operator should take the lancet in his right hand, between the thumb and first finger, place the thumb of his left hand on the vein below the part where he is going to bleed from, and then gently thrust the tip of the lancet into the vein, and, taking care not to push it too deeply, cut in a gently curved direction, thus ^ and bring it out, point upwards, at about half an inch from the part of the vein into which he had thrust it. The vem must be cut lengthways, and not across. When sufficient blood has been taken away, remove the bandage from above the elbow, and place the thumb of the left hand firmly over the cut, until all the bleeding ceases. A small pad of lint is then to be put over the cut, with a larger pad over it, and the two kept in their places by means of a handkerchief or huen roller bound pretty tightly over them and round the arm. 2606. When a person is bled, he should always be in the standing, or at any rate in the sitting, position ; for if, as is often the case, he should happen toHOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT. hour, half a wine-glass of water in which 10 or 15 drops of the elixir of fciint, he can, in most cases at least, easily be brought to again by the operator placing him flat on his back, and stopping the bleeding. This is of the greatest importance. It has been recommended, for what supposed advan- tages we don't know, to bleed people when they are lying down. Should a person, under these circumstances, faint, what could be done to bring him to again ? The great treatment of lowering the body of the patient to the flat position cannot be followed here. It is in that position already, and cannot bo placed lower than it at present is—except, as is most likely to be the case, under the ground. 2607. Bleeding from the Nose.—Many children, especially those of a sanguineous temperament, are subject to sudden discharges of blood from some part of the body ; and as all such fluxes are in general the result of an effort of nature to relieve the system from some overload or pressure, such discharges, unless in excess, and when likely to produce debility, should not be rashly or too abruptly checked. In general, these discharges are confined to the summer or spring months of the year, and follow pains in the head, a sense of drowsiness, languor, or oppression; and, as such symptoms are relieved hy the loss of blood, the hemorrhage should, to a certain extent, be encouraged. \Yhen, however, the bleeding is excessive, or returns too fre- quently, it becomes necessary to apply means to subdue or mitigate the amount. For this purpose the sudden and unexpected application of cold is itself sufficient, in most cases, to arrest the most active hemorrhage. A wet towel laid suddenly on the back, between the shoulders, and placing the child in a recumbent posture, is often sufficient to effect the object; where, however, the effusion resists such simple means, napkins wrung out of cold water must be laid across the forehead and nose, the hands dipped in cold water, and a bottle of hot water applied to the feet. If, in spite of these means, the bleeding continues, a little fine wool or a few folds of lint, tied together by a piece of thread, must be pushed up the nostril from which the blood flows, to act as a plug and pressure on the bleeding vessel. When the discharge has entirely ceased, the plug is to be pulled out by means of the thread. To prevent a repetition of the hemorrhage, the body should bo sponged every morning with cold water, and the child put under a course of steel wine, have open-air exercise, and, if possible, salt-water bathing. For children, a key suddenly dropped down the back between the skin and clothes, will often immediately arrest a copious bleeding. 2608. Spitting of Blood, or hemorrhage from the lungs, is generally known from blood from the stomach by its being of a brighter colour, and in less quantities than that, which is always grumous and mixed with the half-digested food. In either case, rest should be immediately enjoined, total abstinence from stimulants, and a low, poor diet, accom- panied with the horizontal position, and bottles of boiling water to the feet. At the same time the patient should suck through a quill, every1067 THE DOCTOR. vitriol has been mixed, and, till further advice has been procured, keep a towel wrung out of cold water on the chest or stomach, according to the scat of the hemorrhage. Bites and Stings. 2(5o9. Bites and Stings may be divided into three kinds!—1. Those of Insects. 2. Those of Snakes. 3. Those of Dogs and other Animals. 2610. 1. The Bites or Stings of Insects, such as gnats, bees, wasps, &c., need cause very little alarm, and are, generally speaking, easily cured. They are very serious, however, when they take place on some delicate part of the body, such as near the eye, or in the throat. The treatment is very simple in most cases; and consists in taking out the sting, if it is left behind, with a needle, and applying to the part a liniment made of finely-scraped chalk and olive-oil, mixed together to about the thickness of cream. 2611. Bathing the part bitten with warm turpentine or warm vinegar is also of great use. If the person feels faint, he should lie quietly on his back, and take a little brandy-and-water, or sal-volatile and water. When the inside of the throat is the part stung, there is great danger of violent inflam- mation taking place. In this case, from eight to twelve leeches should be immediately put to the outside of the throat, and when they drop off, the part to which they had been applied should be well fomented with warm water. The inside of the throat is to be constantly gargled with salt and water. Bits of ice are to be sucked. Rubbing the face and hands well over with plain olive-oil, before going to bed, will often keep gnats and musquitocs from biting during the night. Strong scent, such as eau-de-Cologne, will have the same effect. 2612. 2. Bites of Snales.—These are much more dangerous than the pre- ceding, and require more powerful remedies. The bites of the different kinds of snakes do not all act alike, but affect people in different ways.—Treatment of the part hiiten. The great thing is to prevent the poison getting into the blood; and, if possible, to remove the whole of it at once from the body. A pocket-handkerchief, a piece of tape or cord, or, in fact, of anything that is at hand, should be tied tightly round the part of the body bitten ; if it be the leg or arm, immediately alove the bite, and between it and the heart. The bite should then be sucked several times by any one who is near. There is no danger in this, provided the person who does it has not got the skin taken off any part of his mouth. What has been sucked into the mouth should be immediately spit out again. But if those v/ho are near have suffi- cient nerve for the operation, and a suitable instrument, they should cut out the central part bitten, and then bathe the wound for some time with warm water, to make it bleed freely. The wound should afterwards be rubbed with a stick of lunar caustic, or, what is better, a solution of this—60 grains of lunar caustic dissolved in an ounce of water—should be dropped into it. The band should be kept on the part during the whole of the time that theseHOUSEHOLD MA.NAGEMENT. 1063 means arc being adopted. The wound should afterwards be covered with lint dipped in cold water. The best plan, however, to be adopted, if it can be manaj*:ed, is the following:—take a common wine-glass, and, holding it upside down, put a lighted candle or a spirit-lamp into it for a minute or two. This will take out the air. Then clap the glass suddenly over the bitten part, and it will become attached, and hold on to the flesh. The glass being nearly empty, the blood containing the poison will, in consequence, flow into it from the wound of its own accord. This process should be repeated three or four times, and the wound sucked, or washed with warm water, before each appli- cation of the glass. As a matter of course, when the glass is removed, all the blood should be washed out of it before it is applied again.—Constitutional Treatment There is mostly at first great depression of strength in these cases, and it is therefore requisite to give some stimulant; a glass of hot brandy-and-water, or twenty drops of sal-volatile, is the best that can be given. When the strength has returned, and if the patient has not already "keen sick, a little mustard in hot water should be given, to make him so. If, on the other hand, as is often the case, the vomiting is excessive, a largo mustard poultice should be placed over the stomach, and a grain of solid opium swallowed in the form of a pill, for the purpose of stopping it. Only one of these pills should be given by a non-professional person. In all cases of bites from snakes, send for a surgeon as quickly as possible, and act according to the above directions until he arrives. If he is within any reason- able distance, content yourself by putting on the band, sucking the wound, applying the glass, and, if necessary, giving a little brandy-and-water. '2613. 3. Bites of Dogs.—For obvious reasons, these kinds of bites are more frequently met with than those of snakes. The treatment is the same as that for snake-bites, more especially that of the bitten j^art. The majority of Tv^riters on the subject are in favour of keeping the wound open as long as possible. This may be done by putting a few beans on it, and then by applying a large linseed-meal poultice over them. Injuries and Accidents to Bones. 2614. Dislocation of Bo7ies.—When the end of a bone is pushed out of its natural position, it is said to be dislocated. This may be caused by violence, disease, or natural weakness of the parts about a joint.—Symptoms. De- formity about the joint, with unnatural prominence at one part, and depression at another. The limb may be shorter or longer than usual, and is stiff" and unable to be moved, diff"ering in these last two respects from a broken limb, which is mostly shorter, never longer, than usual, and which is always more movable.—Treatment, So much practical science and tact are requisite in order to bring a dislocated bone into its proper position again, that we strongly advise the reader never to interfere in these cases; unless, indeed, it is a,ltogetlier impossible to obtain the services of a surgeon. But because any one of us may very possibly be placed in that emergency, we give a fuw roughTHE DOCTOR. 1069 rules for tlie reader's guidance. In the first place make the joint, from which the bone has been displaced^ perfectly steady, either by fixing it to some firm object or else by holding it with the hands ; then pull the dislocated bone in a direction towards the place from which it has been thrust, so that, if it moves at all from its unnatural position, it may have the best chance of returning to its proper place. Do not, however, pull or press against the parts too violently, as you may, perhaps, by doing so, rupture blood-vessels, and produce most serious consequences. When you do attempt to reduce a dislocated bone, do it as quickly as possible after the accident has taken place, every hour making the operation more difficult. When the patient is very strong, he may be put into a warm bath until he feels faint, or have sixty drops of antimonial wine given him every ten minutes until he feels sickish. These two means are of great use in relaxing the muscles. If the bone has been brought back again to its proper place, keep it there by means of bandages; and if there is much pain about the joint, apply a cold lotion to it, and keep it perfectly at rest. The lotion should be, a dessert-spoonful of Goulard's extract, and two table- spoonfuls of vinegar, mixed in a pint of water. Leeches are sometimes ne- cessary. Unless the local pain, or general feverish symptoms, are great, the patient's diet should be the same as usual. Dislocations may be reduced a week, or even a fortnight, after they have taken place. As, therefore, although the sooner a bone is reduced the better, there is no very great emergency, and as the most serious consequences may follow improper or too violent treatment, it is always better for people in these cases to do too little than too much ; in- asmuch as the good which has not yet may still be done, whereas the evil that has been done cannot so easily be undone. 2615. Fractures op Bones.—^?/3?ij;fom5. 1. Deformity of the part. 2. Unnatural looseness. 3. A grating sound when the two ends of the broken bone are rubbed together. 4. Loss of natural motion and power. In some cases there is also shortening of the limb.—Fracture takes place from several causes, as a fall, a blow, a squeeze^ and sometimes fi'om the violent action of muscles.—Treatment. In cases where a surgeon cannot be procured im- mediately after the accident, the following general rules are offered for the reader's guidance :—The broken limb should be placed and kept as nearly as possible in its natural position. This is to be done by fii'st pulling the two portions of the bone in opposite directions, until the limb becomes as long as the opposite one, and then by applying a splint, and binding it to the part by means of a roller. When there is no deformity, the pulling is of course un- necessary. If there is much swelling about the broken part, a cold lotion is to be applied. This lotion {icMch we will call Lotion No. 1) may be thus made:—Mix a dessert-spoonful of Goulard's extract and two tablespoonfuls of vinegar in a pint of water. When the leg or arm is broken, always, if possible, get it to the same length and form as the opposite limb. The broken part should be kept perfectly quiet. When a broken limb is deformed, and a particular muscle is on tho stretch, place the limb in such a position as will relax it. This will in most cases cm'e the deformity. Brandy-and-water, or1070 HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT. Seal-volatile and water, are to be given when the patient is faint. Surgical aid chould, of course, be procured as soon as possible. 2616. Joints, Injuries to.—All kinds of injuries to joints, of whatever description, require particular attention, in consequence of the violent in- flammations which are so liable to take place in these parts of the body, and which do so much mischief in a little time. The joint injured should always be kept perfectly at rest; and when it is very painful, and the skin about it red, swollen, hot, and shining, at the same time that the patient has general feverish symptoms, such as great thirst and headache—leeches, and when they drop off, warm poppy fomentations, are to be applied; the No. 1 pills above- mentioned are to be given (two are a dose for a grown person) with a black draught three hours afterwards. Give also two tablespoonfuls of the fever- mixture every four hours, and keep the patient on low diet. When the injury and swelling are not very great, warm applications, with rest, low diet, and a dose of aperient medicine, will be sufficient. When a joint has received a penetrating wound, it will require the most powerful treatment, and can only be properly attended to by a surgeon. The patient's friends will have to use their own judg-ment to a great extent in these and in many other cases, as to when leeches, fever-mixture, &c., are necessary. A universal rule, however, without a single exception, is ahoays to rest a joint well after it has been in- jured in any way whatever, to purge the patient, and to keep him on low diet, without beer, unless he has been a very great drinker indeed, in which case he may still be allowed to take a little ; for if the stimulant that a person has been accustomed to in excess be all taken away at once, he is very likely to have an attack of delirium tremens. The quantity given should not, how- ever, be much—say a pint, or, at the most, a pint and a half a day. Eubbing the joint with opodeldoc, or the application of a blister to it, is of great service in taking away the thickenings, which often remain after all heat, pain, and redness have left an injured joint. Great care should be observed in not using a joint too quickly after it has been injured. When the shoulder-joint is the one injured, the arm should be bound tightly to the body by means of a linen or flannel roller, and the elbow raised; when the elbow, it should be kept raised in the straight position, on a pillow ; when the wrist, it should be raised on the chest, and suspended in a sling ; when the knee, it should be kept in the straight position j and, lastly, when the ankle, it should be a little raised on a pillow. 2617. Bruises, Lacerations, and Cuts.—Wherever the bruise may be, or however swollen or discoloured the skin may become, two or three applica- tions of the extract of lead, kept to the part by means of lint, will, in an hour or little more, remove all pain, swelling, and tenderness. Simple or clean cuts only require the edges of the wound to be placed in their exact situation, drawn close together, and secured there by one or two slips of adhesive plaster. When the wound, however, is jagged, or the flesh or cuticle lacerated, the parts are to be laid as smooth and regular as possible, and a piece of lint, wetted1071 THE DOCTOR. iia the extract of lead, laid upon the wound, and a piece of greased lint placed above it to prevent the dressing sticking ; the whole covered over to protect from injur}'-, and the part dressed in the same manner once a day till the cure is effected. 2618. Bruises and their Treatment.—The best application for a bruise, be it large or small, is moist warmth; therefore, a warm bread-and-water poultice in hot moist flannels should be put on, as they supple the skin. If the bruise be very severe, and in the neighbourhood of a joint, it will be well to apply ten or a dozen leeches over the whole bruised part, and afterwards a poultice. But leeches should not be put on young children. If the bruised part be the knee or the ankle, walking should not be attempted til; it can be performed without pain. Inattention to this point often lays the founda- tion for serious mischief in these joints, especially in the case of scrofulous persons. In all conditions of bruises occurring in children, whether swellings or abrasions, no remedy is so quick or certain of effecting a cure as the pui'e extract of lead applied to the part. Burns and Scalds. 2619. Burns AND Scalds being essentially the same in all particulars, and differing only in the manner of their production, may be spoken of together. As a general rule, scalds are less severe than burns, because the heat of water, by which scalds are mostly produced, is not, even when it is boiling, so in- tense as that of flame ; oil, however, and other liquids, whose boiling-point is high, produce scalds of a very severe nature. Burns and scalds have been divided into three classes. The first class comprises those where the burn is altogether superficial, and merely reddens the skin; the second, where the injury is greater, and we get little bladders containing a fluid (called serum) dotted over the affected part; in the third class we get, in the case of burns, a charring, and in that of scalds, a softening or pulpiness, perhaps a complete and immediate separation of the part. This may occur at once, or in the course of a little time. The pain from the second kind of burns is much more severe than that in the other two, although the danger, as a general rule, is less than it is in the third class. These injuries are much more dangerous when they take place on the trunk than when they happen on the arms or legs. The danger arises more from the extent of surface that is burnt than from the depth to which the burn goes. This rule, of course, has certain ex- ceptions ; because a small burn on the chest or belly penetrating deeply is more dangerous than a more extensive but superficial one on the arm or leg. Y/hen a person's clothes are in flames, the best way of extinguishing them is to wind a rug, or some thick material, tightly round the whole of the body. 2620. Treatment of the First Class of Burns and Scalds. — Of the affected.—Cover it immediately with a good coating of common flour, or cotton-wool with flour dredged well into it. The great thing is to keep the affected surface of the skin from the contact of the air. The part will shortlyHOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT. 1072 get well, and the skin may or may not peel off.—Constitutional Treatment If the burn or scald is not extensive, and there is no prostration of strength, this is very simple, and consists in simply giving a little aperient medicine— pills (No. 2), as follows:—Mix 5 grains of blue pill and the same quan- tity of compound extract of colocynth, and make into two pills—the dose for XI full-grown person. Three hours after the pills give a black draught. If there are general symptoms of fever, such as hot skin, thirst, headache, &c. &c., two tablespoonfuls of fever-mixture are to be given every four hours. The fever-mixture, we remind our readers, is made thus :—Mix a drachm of l^owdered nitre, 2 drachms of carbonate of potash, 2 teaspoonfuls of antimo- nial wine, and a tablespoonful of sweet spirits of nitre, in half a pint of water. 2621. Second Class. Local Treatment.—As the symptoms of these kinds of burns are more severe than those of the first class, so the remedies appropriate to them are more powerful. Having, as carefully as possible, removed the clothes from the burnt surface, and taking care not to break the bladders, spread the following liniment (No. 1) on a piece of linen or lint—not the fliiffy side—and apply it to the part: the liniment should be equal parts of lime- water and linseed-oil, well mixed. If the burn is on the trunk of the body, it is better to use a warm linseed-meal poultice. After a few days dress the wound with Turner's cerate. If the burn is at the bend of the elbow, place the arm in the straight position ; for if it is lent, the skin, when healed, will be contracted, and the arm, in all probability, always remain in the same un. natural position. This, indeed, applies to all parts of the body; therefore, tilways place the part affected in the most stretched position possible. — "Constitutional Treatment. The same kind of treatment is to be used as for the first class, only it must be more powerful. Stimulants are more often necessary, but must be given with great caution. If, as is often the case, there is great irritability and restlessness, a dose of opium (paregoric, in doses of from sixty to a hundred drops, according to age, is best) is of great service. The feverish symptoms will require aperient medicines and the fever-mixture. A drink made of about a tablespoonful of cream of tartar and a little lemon- juice, in a quart of warm water, allowed to cool, is a very nice one in these cases. The diet throughout should not be too low, especially if there is much discharge from the wound. After a few days it is often necessar»y to give wine, ammonia, and strong beef-tea. These should be had recourse to when the tongue gets dry and dark, and the pulse weak and frequent. If there should be, after the lapse of a week or two, pain over one particular part of the belly, a blister should be put on it, and a powder of mercury and chalk- grey powder, and Dover's powder (two grains of the former and five of the latter) given three times a day. Affections of the head and chest also frequently occur as a consequence of these kinds of burns, but no one who is not a medical man can treat them. 2622. Third Class.—These are so severe as to make it impossible for a non- professional person to be of much service in attending to them. When they1073 THE DOCTOR. occur, a surgeon should always be sent for. Until he arrives, however, tho followhig treatment should bo adopted :—Place the patient full-length on his back, and keep him warm. Apply fomentations of flannels wrung out of boiling water and sprinkled with spirits of turpentine to the part, and give v/ine and sal-volatile in such quantities as the prostration of strength requires ; always bearing in mind the great fact that you have to steer between two quicksands—death from present prostration and death from future excite- ment, which will always be increased in proportion to the amount of stimulants given. Give, therefore, only just as much as is absolutely necessary to keep life in tho body. 2623. Concussion of Brain—Stunning.—This may be caused by a blow or a fall.—Symptoms. Cold skin ; weak pulse; almost total insensibility ; slow, vreak breathing; pupil of eye sometimes bigger, sometimes smaller, than natural; inability to move ; unwillingness to answer when spoken to. These symptoms come on directly after the accident.—Treatment. Place the patient quietly on a warm bed, send for a surgeon, and do nothing else for the first four or six Jiours. After this time the skin will become hot, the pulso full, and the patient feverish altogether. If the surgeon has not arrived by the time these symptoms have set in, shave the patient's head, and apply tho following lotion (No. 2): Mix half an ounce of sal-ammoniac, two tablespoon- fuls of vinegar, and the same quantity of gin or whisky, in half a pint of water. Then give this pill (No. 1): Mix five grains of calomel and the same quantity of antimonial powder with a little bread-crumb, and make into two pills. Give a black draught three hours after the pill, and two tablespoonfuls of the above-mentioned fever-mixture every four hours. Keep on low diet. Leeches arc sometimes to be applied to the head. These cases are often fol- lowed by violent inflammation of the brain. They can, therefore, only be attended to properly throughout by a surgeon. The great thing for people to do in these cases is—nothing ; contenting themselves with putting the patient to bed, and waiting the arrival of a surgeon. 2624. The Cholera and Autumnal Complaints.—To oppose cholera, there seems no surer or better means than cleanliness, sobriety, and judicious Tcntilation. Where there is dirt, that is the place for cholera ; where v/indov,'s and doors are kept most jealously shut, there cholera will find easiest entrance ; and people who indulge in intemperate diet during the hot days of autumn are actually courting death. To repeat it, cleanliness, sobriety, and free ventilation almost always defy the pestilence ; but, in case of attack, immediate recourse should be had to a physician. The faculty soy that a large number of lives have been lost, in many seasons, solely from delay in seeking medical assistance. They even assert that, taken early, the cholera is by no means a fatal disorder. The copious use of salt is recommended on very excellent authority. Other autumnal complaints there are, of which diarrhosa is tho worst example. They come on with pain, flatulence, sickness, with or without vomiting, followed by loss of appetite, general lassitude, and weakness. If 3 21074 HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT. attended to at the first aj^pearance, they may soon be conquered ; for which purpose it is necessary to assist nature in throwing off the contents of the bowels, which may be done by means of the following prescription Take of calomel S grains, rhubarb 8 grains ; mix and take it in a little honey or jelly, and repeat the dose three times, at the intervals of four or five hours. The next purpose to be answered is the defence of the hning membrane of the intestines from their acrid contents, which will be best effected by drinking copiously of linseed tea, or of a drink made by pouring boiling water on quince- seeds, which are of a very mucilaginous nature; or, what is still better, full draughts of whey. If the complaint continue after these means have been employed, some astringent or binding medicine will be required, as the sub- joined :—Take of prepared chalk 2 drachms, cinnamon-water 7 oz., syrup of poppies 1 oz.; mix, and take 3 tablespoonfuls every four hours. Should this fail to complete the cure, ^ oz. of tincture of catechu, or of kino, may be added to it, and then it will seldom fail; or a teaspoonful of the tincture of kino alone, with a little water, every three hours, till the diarrhoea is checked. AVhile any symptoms of derangement are present, particular attention must be paid to the diet, which should be of a soothing, lubricating, and light nature, as instanced in veal or chicken broth, which should contain but little salt. Rice, batter, and bread puddings will be generally rehshed, and be eaten with advantage; but the stomach is too much impaired to digest food of a more solid nature. Indeed, we should give that organ, together with the bowels, as little trouble as possible, while they are so incapable of acting in their accustomed manner. Much mischief is frequently produced by the absurd practice of taking tincture of rhubarb, which is almost certain of aggravating that species of disorder of which we have now treated : for it is a spirit as strong as brandy, and cannot fail of producing harm upon a surface which is rendered tender by the formation and contact of vitiated bile. But our last advice is, upon the first appearance of such symptoms as are above detailed, have immediate recourse to a doctor, where possible. 2625. To Cure a Cold.—Put a large teacupful of linseed, with ^ lb. of sun raisins and2oz. of stick Hquorice, into 2 quarts of soft water, and let it simmer over a slow fire till reduced to one quart; add to it | lb. of pounded sugar- candy, a tablespoonful of old rum, and a tablespoonful of the best white-wine vinegar, or lemon-juice. The rum and vinegar should be added as the de- coction is taken; for, if they are put in at first, the whole soon becomes flat and less efficacious. The dose is half a pint, made warm, on going to bed ; and a httle may be taken whenever the cough is troublesome. The worst cold is generally cured by this remedy in two or three days ; and, if taken in time, is considered infallible. 1626. Cold on the Chest.—A flannel dipped in boiling water, and sprinkled with turpentine, laid on the chest as quickly as possible, will relieve the most severe cold or hoarseness. 3027. bUBSTANCES IN THE Eye.—To removG fine particles of gravel, lime.1075 THE DOCTOR. kc, the eye should be syringed with hikcwarm water till free from them. Bo particular not to worry the eye, under the impression that the substance is still there, which the enlargement of some of the minute vessels makes the patient believe is actually the case. 2628. Sore Eyes.—Incorporate thoroughly, in a glass mortar or vessel, one part of strong citron ointment with three parts of spermaceti ointment. Use the mixture night and morning, by placing a piece of the size of a pea in the corner of the eye affected, only to be used in cases of chronic or long-standing inflammation of the organ, or its lids. 2629. Lime in the Eye.—Bathe the eye with a little weak vinegar-and- water, and carefully remove any little piece of lime which may be seen, with a feather. If any lime has got entangled in the eyelashes, carefully clear it away with a bit of soft linen soaked in vinegar-and-water. Violent inflamma- tion is sure to follow ; a smart purge must be therefore administered, and in all probability a blister must be applied on the temple, behind the ear, or nape of the neck. 2630. Stye in the Eye.—Styes are little abscesses which form between the roots of the eyelashes, and are rarely larger than a small pea. The best way to manage them is to bathe them frequently with warm water, or in warm poppy-water, if very painful. When they have burst, use an ointment composed of one part of citron ointment and four of spermaceti, well rubbed together, and smear along the edge of the eyelid. Give a grain or two of calomel with 5 or 8 grains of rhubarb, according to the age of the child, twice a week. The old- fashioned and apparently absurd practice of rubbing the stye with a ring, is as good and speedy a cure as that by any process of medicinal application ; though the number of times it is rubbed, or the quality of the ring and direction of the strokes, has nothing to do with its success. The pressure and the friction excite the vessels of the part, and cause an absorption of the effused matter under the eyelash. The edge of the nail will answer as well as a ring. 2631. Inflammation of the Eyelids.—The following ointment has been found very beneficial in inflammations of the eyeball and edges of the eyelids:—Take of prepared calomel, 1 scruple ; spermaceti ointment, | oz. Mix them well together in a glass mortar; apply a small quantity to each corner of the eye every night and morning, and also to the edges of the lids, if they are afl'ected. If this should not eventually remove the inflamma- tion, elder- flower water may be applied three or four times a day, by means of an eye-cup. The bowels should be kej^t in a laxative state, by taking occasionally a quarter of an ounce of the Cheltenham or Epsom salts. 2632. Fasting.—It is said by many able physicians that fasting is a means of removing incipient disease, and of restoring the body to its customary healthy 3 z 2HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT. 1076 sensations. Howard, tho celebrated pliilantliropist (says a writer), used to fast one day in every week. Napoleon, when he felt his system unstrung, suspended his wonted repast^ and took his exercise on horseback. Fits. -2633. Fits come on so suddenly, often without even the slightest warning, and may prove fatal so quickly, that all people should be acquainted at least with their leading symptoms and treatment, as a few moments, more or less, will often decide the question between life and death. The treatment, in very- many cases at least, to be of the slightest use, should be immediate, as a person in a fit (of apoplexy for instance) may die while a surgeon is being fetched from only the next street. We shall give, as far as the fact of our editing a work for non-professional readers will permit, the peculiar and distinctive symptoms of all kind of fits, and the immediate treatment to be adopted in each case. 2634. Apoplexy.—These fits may be divided into two kinds—the strong and the iveah. 2635. 1. The strong Jcincl.—These cases mostly occur in stout, strong, short- necked, bloated-faced people, who are in the habit of living well.—Symptoms. The patient may or may not have had headache, sparks before his eyeS;, with confusion of ideas and giddiness, for a day or two before the attack. When it takes place, he falls down insensible ; the bod}'' becomes para- lyzed, generally more so on one side than the other; the face and head are hot, and the blood-vessels about them swollen; the pupils of the eyes are larger than natural, and the eyes themselves are fixed ; the mouth is mostlj" drawn down at one corner ; the breathing is like loud snoring ; the pulse full and hard.—Treatment. Place the patient immediately in bed, with his head well raised ; take off everything that he has round his neck, and bleed freely and at once from the arm. If you have not got a lancet, use a pen- knife or anything suitable that may be at hand. Apply warm mustard poultices to the soles of the feet and the insides of the thighs and legs; put two drops of castor oil, mixed up with eight grains of calomel, on the top of the tongue, as far back as possible ; a most important part of the treatment being to open the bowels as quickly and freely as possible. The patient cannot swallow; but these medicines, especially the oil, will be absorbed into the stomach altogether independent of any voluntary action. If possible, throw up a warm turpentine clyster (two table- spoonfuls of oil of turpentine in a pint of warm gruel), or, if this cannot bo obtained, one composed of about a quart of warm salt-and-water and soai>. Cut off the hair, and apply rags dipped in weak vinegar-and-water, or weak gin-and-water, or even simple cold water, to the head. If the blood-vessels about the head and neck are much swollen, put from eight to ten leeches on the temple opposite to the paralyzed side of the body. Always send for a Burgeon immediately, and act according to the above rules, doing more or less,TOE DOCTOR. 1077 according to the means at Land, and the length of time that must necessarily elapse mitil he arrives. A pint, or even a quart of blood in a very strong person, may be taken away. When the patient is able to swallow, give him the No. 1 pills, and the No. 1 mixture directly. [The No. 1 pills are made as follov/s :—Mix 5 grains of calomel and the same quantity of antimonial powder with a little bread-crumb : make into two pills, the dose for a full- grown person. For the No. 1 mixture, dissolve an ounce of Epsom salts in half a pint of senna tea: take a quarter of the mixture as a dose,] Repeat these remedies if the bowels are not well opened. Keep the patient's head well raised, and cool as above. Give very low diet indeed : gruel, arrowroot, and the like. When a person is recovering, he should have blisters applied to the nape of the neck, his bowels should be kept well open, light diet given, and fatigue, worry, and excess of all kinds avoided. 2636. 2. The wealc kind.—S^jmyAoms. These attacks are more frequently pre- ceded by warning symptoms than the first kind. The face is pale, the pulse weak, and the body, especially the hands and legs, cold. After a little while, these symptoms sometimes alter to those of the first class in a mild degree.— Treatment. At first, if the pulse is very feible indeed, a little brandy-and- water or sal-volatile must be given. Mustard poultices are to be put, as before, to the soles of the feet and the insides of the thighs and legs. Warm bricks, or bottles filled with warm water, are also to be placed under the arm- pits. When the strength has returned, the body become warmer, and the pulse fuller and harder, the head should be shaved, and wet rags applied to it, as before described. Leeches should be put, as before, to the temple opposite the side paralyzed ; and the bowels should be opened as freely and as quickly as possible. Bleeding from the arm is often necessary in these cases, but a non-professional person should never have recourse to it. Blisters may be applied to the nape of the neck at once. The diet in these cases should not be so low as in the former—indeed, it is often necessary, in a day or so after one of these attacks, to give wine, strong beef-tea, &c., according to the con- dition of the patient's strength. 2637. Bidinciions hctween A]}02)lexy and Epilepsy.—1. Apoplexy mostly happens in people over thirty, whereas epilepsy generally occurs under that age; at any rate for the first time. A person who has epileptic fits over thirty, has generally suffered from them for some years. 2. Again, in apoplexy, the body is paralyzed; and, therefore, has not the convulsions • -ivhich taJce place in epilepsy. 3. The peculiar snoring will also distinguish J apoplexy from epilepsy. 2638. Distinctions hctiveen A apoplexy and, Drunlcenness.—1. The knovv-n habits of the person. 2. The fact of a person who was perfectly sober and sensible a little time before, being found in a state of insensibility. 3. The absence, in apoplexy, of the smell of driiih on applying the nose to the mouth. 4. A person in a fit of aT)oplexy cannot be roused at all; in drunken- ness he m-ostly can, to a certain extent.1078 HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT. 2639. Distinction heiwecii Apo;plexy and Hysterics. — Hysterics mostly happen in youngs nervous, unmarried women ; and are attended with convul- sions, sobbing, laughter, throwing about of the body, &c. &c. 2640. Distinction hetiveen Apoplexy and, Poisoning hy Opium.—It is exceed- ingly difficult to distinguish between these two cases. In poisoning by opium, however, we find the particular smell of the drug in the patient's breath. We should also, in forming our opinion, take into consideration the person's previous conduct—whether he has been low and desponding for some time before, or has ever talked about committing suicide. 2641. Epilepsy.—Falling JSichiess.—These fits mostly happen, at any rate for the first time, to young people, and are more comm^on in boys than girls. They are produced by numerous causes.—Symptoms. The fit may be pre- ceded by pains in the head, palpitations, &c. &c. ; but it mostly happens that the person falls down insensible suddenly, and without any warning whatever. The eyes are distorted, so that only their whites can be seen; there is mostly foaming from the mouth ; the fingers are clinched; and the bod}', especially on one side, is much agitated ; the tongue is often thrust out of the mouth. When the fit goes ofiF, the patient feels drowsy and faint, and often sleeps soundly for some time.—Treatment. During the fit, keep the patient flat on his back, with his head slightly raised, and prevent him from doing any harm to himself; do.sh cold water into his face, and apply smelling-salts to his nose ; loosen his shirt collar, &c. ; hold a piece of wood about as thick as a finger— the handle of a tooth-brush or knife will do as well—between the two rows of teeth, at the back part of the mouth. This will prevent the tongue from being injured. A teaspoonful of common salt thrust into the patient's mouth, during the fit, is of much service. The after-treatment of these fits is various, and depends entirely upon their causes. A good general rule, however, is always to keep the bowels well open, and the patient quiet, and free from fatigue, worry, and excess of all kinds. 2642. Fainting Fits are sometimes very dangerous, and at others perfectly harmless ; the question of danger depending altogether upon the causes which have produced them, and which are exceedingly various. For instance, fainting produced by disease of the heart is a very serious symptom indeed ; whereas, that arising from some slight cause, such as the sight of blood, &;c., need cause no alarm whatever. The symptoms of simple fainting are so well known that it would be quite superfluous to enumerate them here. The treatment consists in laying the patient at full length upon his back, with his head upon a level with the rest of his body, loosening everything about the neck, dashing cold water into the face, and sprinkling vinegar and water about the mouth; applying smelUng-salts to the nose; and, when the patient is able to swallow, in giving a little warm brandy-and-water, or about 20 drops of Bal-volatile in water. 2643. Hysterics.—These fi.ts take place, for the most part, in young, nervous,1079 THE DOCTOB. unmarried women. They happen much less often in married women : and even (in some rare cases indeed) in men. Young women, who are subject to these fits, are apt to think that they are suffering from " all the ills that flesh is heir toand the false symptoms of disease which they show are so like the true ones, that it is often exceedingly difficult to detect the difference. The fits themselves are mostly preceded by great depression of spirits, shed- ding of tears, sickness, palpitation of the heart, &c. A pain, as if a nail were being driven in, is also often felt at one particular part of the head. In almost all cases, when a fit is coming on, pain is felt on the left side. This pain rises gradually until it reaches the throat, aud then gives the patient a sensation as if she had a pellet there, which prevents her from breathing pro- perly, and, in fact, seems to threaten actual suffocation. The patient now generally becomes insensible, and faints; the body is thrown about in ail directions, froth issues from the mouth, incoherent expressions are uttered, and fits of laughter, crying, or screaming, take place. When the fit is going ofi", the patient mostly cries bitterly, sometimes knowing all, and at others nothing, of what has taken place, and feeling general soreness all over the body. Treatment during the fit. Place the body in the same position as for simple fainting, and treat, in other respects, as directed in the article on Epilepsy. Alivays loell loosen thepatienfs stays; and, when she is recovering, and able to swallow, give 20 drops of sal volatile in a little water. The after-treatment of these cases is very various. If the j)atient is of a strong constitution, she should live on i^lain diet, take plenty of exercise, and take occasional doses of castor oil, or an aperient mixture, such as that described as No. 1," in previous numbers. If, as is mostly the case, the patient is weak and delicate, she will require a different mode of treatment altogether. Good nourishing diet, gentle exercise, cold baths, occasionally a dose of No. 3 myrrh and aloes pills at night, and a dose of compound iron pills twice a day. [As to the myrrh and aloes pills (No. 8), 10 grains made into two pills arc a dose for a full-grown person. Of the compound iron pills (No. 4), the dose for a full grown person is also 10 grains, made into two pills.] In ever}-- case, amusing the mind, and avoiding all causes of over-excitement, are of great service in bringing about a permanent cure. 2644. Liver Complaint and Spasms.—A very obliging correspondent recommends the following, from personal experience :—Take 4 oz. of dried dandelion root, 1 oz. of the best ginger, ^ oz. of Columba root; bruise and boil all together in 3 pints of water till it is reduced to a quart: strain, and take a wine-glassful every four hours. Our correspondent says it is a''safe and simple medicine for both liver complaint and spasms." 2645. Lumbago.—A "new and successful mode" of treating lumbago, advocated by Dr. Day, is a form of counter-irritation, said to have been intro- duced into this country by the late Sir Anthony Carlisle, and which consists in the instantaneous application of a flat iron button, gently heated in a spirit- lamp, to the skin. Dr. Corrigan published, about three years ago, an accountHOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT. 1080 of some cases very successfully treated by nearly similar means. Dr. Corrigan's plan was, however, to touch the surface of the part affected, at intervals of half an inch, as lightly and rapidly as possible. Dr. Day has found greater advantages to result from drawing the flat surface of the heated button lightly over the affected part, so as to act on a greater extent of surface. The doctor speaks so enthusiastically of the benefit to be derived from this practice, that it is evidently highly deserving attention. 2646. Palpitation of the Heart.—Where palpitation occurs as sympto- matic of indigestion, the treatment must be directed to remedy that disorder ; when it is consequent on a plethoric state, purgatives will be effectual. In this case the patient should abstain from every kind of diet likely to produce a plethoric condition of body. Animal food and fermented liquor must be particularly avoided. Too much indulgence in sleep will also prove injurious. When the attacks arise from nervous irritability, the excitement must be allayed by change of air and a tonic diet. Should the palpitation originate from organic derangement, it must be, of course, beyond domestic manage- ment. Luxurious living, indolence, and tight-lacing often produce this affec* lion : such cases are to be conquered with a little resolution. 2517.

The symptoms of poisoning may be known for the most part from those of some diseases, which they are very like, from the fact of their coming- on immediately after eating or drinking something ; whereas those of disease come on, in most cases at least, by degrees, and with warnings. In most cases where poison is known, or suspected, to have been taken, the first thing to be done is to empty the stomach, well and immediatel}^, by means of mustard mixed in warm water, or plain warm salt-and-water, or, better, this draught, which we call No. 1:—Twenty grains of sulphate of zinc in an ounce and a half of water. This draught to be repeated in a quarter of an hour if vomiting does not ensue. The back part of the throat should be v;^ell tickled with a feather, or two of the fingers thrust down it, to induce vomiting. The cases where vomiting must not be used are those where the skin has been taken off, and the parts touched irritated and inflamed by the poison taken, and where the action of vomiting would increase the evil. Full instructions are givQn in the article on each particular poison as to where emetics are or are not to be given. The best and safest way of emptying the stomach is by means of the stomach-pump, as in certain cases the action of vomiting is likely to increase the danger arising from the swollen and congested condition of the blood-vessels of the head, which often takes place. In the hands, how- ever, of any one else than a surgeon, it would be not only useless, but harmful, as a great deal of dexterity, caution, and experience are required to use it properly. After having made these brief introductory remarks, we shall now proceed to particulars. 2649. 'Sulphimc Acid, or Oil of Vitriol (a clear, colourless liquid, of an oily- appearance).—Symptoms in tJiose loho have swallowed it. When much is taken, these come on immediately. There is great burning pain, extending from the mouth to the stomach; vomiting of a liquid of a dcirk coffee-colour, often mixed with shreds of flesh and streaks of blood ; the skin inside the mouth is taken ofl\, and the exposed surface is at first white, and after a time becomes brownish. There are sometimes spots of a brown colour round the lips and on the neck, caused by drops of the acid failing on these parts. There is great difficulty of breathing, owing to the swelling at the back part of the mouth. After a time there is much depression of strength, with a quick, weak pulse.

The face is pale, and has a very anxious look. When the acid swallowed has been greatly diluted in water, the same kind of symptoms occur, only in a milder degree.—Treatment. Give a mixture of magnesia in milk-and-water, or, if this cannot be obtained, of finely powdered chalk, or whiting, or even of the plaster torn down from the w^alls or ceiling, in milk-and-water. The mixture should be nearly as thick as cream, and plenty of it given. As well as this, simple gruel, milk, or thick flour-and- water, are ver}^ useful, and should be given in large quantities. Violent in- flammation of the parts touched by the acid is most likely to take place in the course of a little time, -and can only be properly attended to by a surgeon ; but if one cannot be obtained, leeches, the fever-mixtures (the recipe for which appears repeatedly in previous paragraphs), thick drinks, such as barley-water, gruel, arrowroot, &c., must be had recourse to, according to the symptoms of each particular case and the means at hand. The inflamed condition of the back part of the mouth requires particular attention. When the breathing is very laboured and difficult in consequence, from fifteen to twenty leeches are to be immediately applied to the outside of the throat, and when they drox3 off, warm poppy fomentations constantly kept to the part. When the pain over the stomach is very great, the same local treatment is necessary; but if it is only slight, a good mustard poultice will be sufficient without the leeches. In all these cases, two tablespoonfuls of the fever-mixture should be given every four hours, and only gruel or arrowroot allowed to be eaten for some days. 2650. Nitric Acid, commonly know^n as Aqua Fortis, ox. Red Spirit of Nitre (a straw-coloured fluid, of the consistence of water, and which gives off dense vvhite fumes on exposure to the air).—Symptoms produced in those wlio havs swallowed it. Much the same as in the case of sulphuric acid. In this case, however, the surface touched by the acid becomes yellowish. The tongue is mostly much swollen.—Treatment. The same as for sulphuric acid. 2651. Muriatic Acid, Spirit of Salt (a thin yellow fluid, emitting dense white fumes on exposure to the air).—This is not often taken as a poison. The symptoms and treatment are much the same as those of nitric acid. N.B.—In no case of looisonincj ly thesethree acids should emetics ever he given. 26S'i' Oxalic Acid, commonly called >S(xZi of Lemons.—This poison maybe taken by mistake for Epsom salts, which it is a good deal like. It may be distinguished from them by its very acid taste and its shape, which is that of needle-formed crystals, each of which, if put into a drop of ink, will turn it to a reddish brotm, whereas Epsom salts will not change its colour at all. When a large dose of this poison has been taken, death takes place very quickly indeed.—Symptoms produced in those who have swallowed it. A hot, burning, acid taste is felt in the act of swallowing, and vomiting of a greenish-hrown fluid is produced, sooner or later, according to the quantity and strength of the poison taken. There is great tenderness felt over the stomach, followed by clammy perspirations and convulsions ; the legs are often drawn up, and1083 fHE DOCTOR. there is generally stupor, from which the patient, however, can easily be roused, and always great prostration of strength. The pnlse is small and weak, and the breathing faint.—Treatme7it. Chalk or magnesia, made into a cream v/ith water, should be given in large quantities, and afterwards the emetic draught above prescribed, or some mustard-and-water, if the draught cannot be got. The back part of the throat to be tickled with a feather, to induce vomiting. Arrowroot, gruel, and the like drinks, are to be taken. When the prostration of strength is very great and the body cold, warmth is to be ap- plied to it, and a little brandy-and-water, or sal-volatile and water, given. 2653. P^"^('Ssic Acid (a thin, transparent, and colourless liquid, with a peculiar smell, which greatly resembles that of bitter almonds).—SymiJtoms 'produced in tlwse who have siualloived it. These come on immediately after the poison has been taken, and may be produced by merely smelling it. The patient becomes perfectly insensible, and falls down in convulsions—^his eyes are fixed and staring, the pupils being bigger than natural, the skin is cold and clammy, the pulse scarcely perceptible, and the breathing slow and gasping. —Treatment. Very little can be done in these cases, as death takes place so quickly after the poison has been swallowed, when it takes place at all. The best treatment—which should always be adopted in all cases, even though the patient appears quite dead—is to dash quantities of cold water on the back, from the top of the neck downwards. Placing the patient under a pump, and pumping on him, is the best way of doing this. Smelling-salts are also to be applied to the nose, and the chest well rubbed with a camphor liniment. 2654. Alkalis : Potash, Soda, and Ammoniay or common Smelling-Salts, with their principal preparations —Pearlash, Soap Lees, Liquor Potassce, Nitre, Sal Prunella, Hartshorn, and Sal- Volatile.—Alkalis are seldom taken or given with the view of destroying life. They may, however, be swallowed by mistake. —Symptoms produced in those who have swalloived them. There is at first a burning, acrid taste in, and a sensation of tightness round, the throat, like that of strangling; the skin touched is destroyed; retching mostly followed by actual vomiting, then sets in ; the vomited matters often containing blood of a dark brown colour, with little shreds of flesh here and there, and always changing vegetable blue colours green. There is now great tenderness over the whole of the belly. After a little while, great weakness, with cold, clammy sweats, a quick weak pulse, and purging of bloody matters, takes place. The brain, too, mostly becomes affected.—Treatment. Give two tablespoonfuls of vinegar or lemon-juice in a glassful of water every few minutes until the burning sensation is relieved. Any kind of oil or milk may also be given, and will form soap when mixed with the poison in the stomach. Barley-water, gruel, arrowroot, linseed-tea, &;c., are also very useful, and should be taken constantly, and in large quantities. If inflammation should take place, it is to be treated by applying leeches and warm poppy fomenta- tions to the part v/here the pain is most felt, and giving two tablespoonfiils of the fever-mixture every four hours. The diet in all tliese cases should onlyHOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT. 3081 oonsist of arrowroot, or gruel for the first fpw days^ and then of weak broth or becf-tea for some time after. 2655. When very strong fumes of smelling-salts have in any way been inhaled, there is great difficulty of breathing, and alarming pain in the mouth and nostrils. In this case let the patient inhale the steam of warm vinegar, and treat the feverish symptoms as before. 2656. Arsenic.—Mostly seen under the form of white arsenic, or fly-powder, and yellow arsenic, or king's yellow.—Symptoms produced in those who have siuallotved it. These vary very much, according to the form and dose in which the poison has been taken. There is faintness, depression, and sickness, with ^ an intense burning pain in the region of the stomach, which gets worse and "worse, and is increased by pressure. There is also vomiting of dark brown matter, sometimes mixed with blood; and mostly great thirst, with a feeling of tightness round, and of burning in, the throat. Purging also takes place, the matters brought away being mixed with blood. The pulse is small and irregular, and the skin sometimes cold and clammy, and at others hot. The breathing is painful. Convulsions and spasms often occur.—Treatment. Give a couple of teaspoonfuls of mustard in a glass of water, to bring on or assist vomiting, and also use the other means elsewhere recommended for tho purpose. A solution, half of lime-water and half of linseed-oil, well mixed, may be given, as well as plenty of arrowroot, gruel, or linseed-tea. Simple milk is also useful. A little castor-oil should be given, to cleanse the intes- tines of all the poison, and the after-symptoms treated on general principles. 2657. Corrosive Sullimate.—Mostly seen in the form of little heavy crystal- line masses, which melt in water, and have a metallic taste. It is sometimes seen in powder. This is a most powerful poison.—Sym])toms. These mostly come on immediately after the poison has been taken. There is a coppery taste experienced in the act of swallowing, with a burning heat, extending from the top of the throat down to the stomach ; and also a feeling of great tightness round the throat. In a few minutes great pain is felt over the region of the stomach, and frequent vomiting of long, stringy white masses, mixed with blood, takes place. There is also mostly great purging. The counte- nance is generally pale and anxious ; the pulse always small and frequent; tho skin cold and clammy, and the breathing difficult. Convulsions and insen- sibility often occur, and are very bad symptoms indeed. The inside of tho mouth is more or less swollen.—Treatment. Mix the whites of a dozen eggs in two pints of cold water, and give a glassful of the mixture every three or four minutes, until the stomach can contain no more. If vomiting does not now come on naturall}'-, and supposing the mouth is not very sore or much swollen, an emetic draught. No. 1, may be given, and vomiting induced. (The No. 1 draught, we remind our readers, is thus made :—Twenty gi'ains of sulphate of zinc in an ounce and a half of water; the draught to be repeated if vomiting does not take place in a quarter of an hour.) After the stomach has been well cleaned out, milk, flour-and-water, linseed-tea, or barley-water,THE DOCTOR. 1085 should be taken in large quantities. If eggs cannot be obtained, milk, or flour-and-water, should be given as a substitute for them at once. When the depression of strength is very great indeed, a little warm brandy-and-water must be given. In the course of an hour or two the patient should take two tablespoonfuls of castor-oil, and if inflammation comes on, it is to be treated as directed in the article on acids and alkalis. The diet should also be the same. If the patient recovers, great soreness of the gums is almost certain to take place. The simplest, and at the same time one of the best modes of treatment, is to wash them well three or four times a day with brandy-and- water. 2658. Calomel.—A heavy white powder, without taste, and insoluble in water. It has been occasionally known to destroy life.—Spn2:>ioms. Much the same as in the case of corrosive sublimate.—Treatment. The same as for corrosive sublim-ate. If the gums are sore, wash them, as recommended in the case of corrosive sublimate, with brandy-and-water three or four times a day, and keep the patient on fluids, such as arrowroot, gruel, broth, or beef-tea, according to the other sym^Jtoms. Eating hard substances would make the gums more sore and tender. 2659. (Copper.—The preparations of this metal which are most likely to be the ones producing poisonous symptoms, are hlue-stone and verdigris. People are often taken ill after eating food that has been cooked in cojpper saucepans. When anything has been cooked in one of these vessels, it shoitld never he allowed to cool in it. — Symptoms. Headache, pain in the stomach, and purging; vomiting of green or blue matters, convulsions, and spasms,— Treatment. Give whites of eggs, sugar-and-water, castor-oil, and drinks, such as arrowroot and gruel. 2660. Emetic Tartar.—Seen in the form of a white powder, or crystals, with a slightly metallic taste. It has not often been known to destroy life.—Symp- toms. A strong metallic taste in the act of swallowing, followed by a burning pain in the region of the stomach, vomiting, and great purging. The pulse is small and rapid, the skin cold and clammy, the breathing difficult and pain- ful, and the limbs often much cramped. There is also great prostration of strength.—Treatment. Promote the vomiting by giving plenty of warm water, or warm arrowroot and water. Strong tea, in large quantities, should be drunk ; or, if it can be obtained, a decoction of oak bark. The after-treat- ment is the same as that for acids and alkalis ; the principal object in all these cases being to keep down the inflammation of the parts touched by the poison by means of leeches, warm poppy fomentations, fever-mixtures, and very low diet. 2661. Lead, and its preparations. Sugar of Lead, Goulard*s Extract, White Lead,—Lead is by no means an active poison, although it is popularly con- sidered to bo so. It mostly affects people by being taken into the system slowly, as in the case of painters and glaziers. A newly-painted house, too.108G HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT. often affects those living in it.—Symptoms produced lolien iaJcen in a larr/e dose. There is at first a burning, pricking sensation in the throat, to which thirst, giddiness, and vomiting follow. The belly is tight, swollen, and pain- ful ; the pain being relieved hy pressure. The bowels are mostly bound. There is great depression of strength, and a cold skin.—Treatment. Give an emetic draught (No. 1, see above) at once, and shortly afterwards a solution of Epsom salts in large quantities. A little brandy-and-water must be taken if the depression of strength is very great indeed. Milk, w^hites of eggs, and arrowroot are also useful. After two or three hours, cleanse the stomach and intestines well out with two tablespoonfuls of castor-oil, and treat the symp- toms which follow according to the rules laid down in other parts of these articles.—Symptoms ivlien it is tahen into the hody slowly. Headache, pain about the navel, loss of appetite and flesh, offensive breath, a hlueness of the edges of the gums; the belly is tight, hard, and knotty, and the pulse slow and languid. There is also sometimes a difficulty in swallowing.—Treatment. Give five grains of calomel and half a grain of opium directly, in the form of a pill, and half an ounce of Epsom salts in two hours, and repeat this treatment until the bowels are well opened. Put the patient into a warm bath, and throw up a clyster of warmish water when he is in it. Fomentations of warm oil of turpentine, if they can be obtained, should be put over the whole of the belly. The great object is to open the bowels as freely and as quickly as possible. When this has been done, a grain of pure opium may be given. Arrowroot or gruel should be taken in good large quantities. The after-treatment must depend altogether upon the symptoms of each particular case. 2662. Opium, and its preparations. Laudanum, d^c.—Solid oj^ium is mostly seen in the form of rich brown flattish cakes, with little pieces of leaves sticking on them here and there, and a bitter and slightly warm taste. The most common form in which it is taken as a poison, is that of laudanum.— Symptoms. These consist at first in giddiness and stupor, followed by insensi- bility, the patient, however, b€ing roused to consciousness by a great noise, so as to be able to answer a question, but becoming insensible again almost immediately. The pulse is now quick and small, the breathing hurried, and the skin warm and covered with perspiration. After a little time, these symptoms change; the person becomes perfectly insensible, the breathing slow and snoring, as in apoplexy, the skin cold, and the pulse slow and full. The pupil of the eye is mostly smaller than natural. On applying his nose to the patient's mouth, a person may smell the poison very distinctly.—Treatment. Give an emetic draught (No. 1, see above) directly, with large quantities of warm mustard-and-water, warm salt-and-water, or simple warm water. Tickle the top of the throat with a feather, or put two fingers down it to bring on vomiting, which rarely takes place of itself. Dash cold water on the head, chest, and spine, and flap these parts well with the ends of wet towels. Give strong coffee or tea. Walk the patient up and down in the open air for two or three hours ; the great thing being to keep him from sleeping. Electricity is of much service. When the patient is recovering, mustard poultices shouldTHE DOCTOR. 1087 be applied to the soles of the feet and the insides of the thighs and legs. The head should be kept cool and raised. 2663. The following preparations, which are constantly given to children by their nurses and mothers, for the purpose of making them sleep, often prove fatal:—Syrup of Poppies, and Godfrey's Cordial. The author would most earnestly urge all people caring for their children's lives, never to allow any of these preparations to be given, unless ordered by a surgeon. 2664. The treatment in the case of poisoning by Ilenhane, Hemloch, Nigld- sJiade, and Foxglove, is much the same as that for opium. Vomiting should be brought on in all of them. 2665. Poisonous Food.—It sometimes happens that things which are in daily use, and mostly perfectly harmless, give rise, under certain un- known circumstances, and in certain individuals, to the symptoms of poison- ing. The most common articles of food of this description are Mussels, Salmon, and certain kinds of Cheese and Bacon. The general symptoms are thirst, weight about the stomach, difficulty of breathing, vomiting, purging, spasms, prostration of strength, and, in the case of mussels more particularly, an eruption on the body, like that of nettle-rash.—Treatment. Empty the stomach well with No. 1 draught and warm water, and give two tablespoon- fuls of castor-oil immediately after. Let the patient take plenty of arrow- root, gruel, and the like drinks, and if there is much depression of strength, give a little warm brandy-and-water. Should symptoms of fever or inflamma- tion follow, they must be treated as directed in the articles on other kinds of poisoning. 2666. Mushrooms, and similar kinds of vegetables, often produce poisonous effects. The symptoms are various, sometimes giddiness and stupor, and at others pain in and swelling of the belly, with vomiting and purging, being the leading ones. When the symptoms come on quickly after taking the poison, it is generally the head that is affected.—The treatment consists in bringing on vomiting in the usual manner, as quickly and as freely as possible. The other symptoms are to be treated on general principles ; if they are those of depression, by brandy-and-water or sal-volatile; if those of inflammation, by leeches, fomentations, fever-mixtures, &c. &c. 2667. For Cure op Eingworm.—Take of subcarbonate of soda 1 drachm, which dissolve in ^ pint of vinegar. Wash the head every morning with soft Boap, and apply the lotion night and morning. One teaspoonful of sulphur and treacle should also be given occasionally night and morning. The hair should be cut close, and round the spot it should be shaved off, and the part, night and morning, bathed with a lotion made by dissolving a drachm of white vitriol in 6 oz. of water. A small piece of either of the two subjoined ointments rubbed into the part when the lotion has dried in. No. 1.—Take ofHOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT. 1083 citron ointment 1 drachm; sulphur and tar ointment, of eacli | oz.: mix thoroughly, and apply twice a day. No. 2.—Take of simple cerate 1 oz. ; creosote 1 drachm ; calomel 30 grains : mix and use in the same manner as the first. Concurrent with these external remedies, the child should take an alterative powder every morning, or, if they act too much on the bowels, only every second day. The following will be found to answer all the intentions desired, 2668. Alterative Pomlersfor Ringworm.—Take of Sulphuret of antimony, precipitated , 24 grains* Grey powder 12 grains. Calomel •••••• 6 grains. Jalap powder 36 grains. Mix carefully, and divide into 12 powders for a child from 1 to 2 years old ; into 9 powders for a child from 2 to 4 years ; and into 6 powders for a child from 4 to 6 years. Where the patient is older, the strength may be increased by enlarging the quantities of the drugs ordered, or by giving one and a half or two powders for one dose. The ointment is to be well washed off every morning wuth soap-and-water, and the part bathed with the lotion before re-applying the ointment. An imperative fact must be remembered by mother or nurse,—^never to use the same comb employed for the child with ringworm, for the healthy children, or let the affected little one sleep with those free from the disease; and, for fear of any contact by hands or other- wise, to keep the child's head enveloped in a nightcap, till the eruption 13 completely cured. 2669. Scratches.—Trifling as scratches often seem, they ought never to be neglected, but should be covered and protected, and kept clean and dry until they have completely healed. If there is the least appearance of inflamma- tion, no time should be lost in applying a large bread-and-water poultice, or hot flannels repeatedly ajDplied, or even leeches in good numbers may be put on at some distance from each other. 2670. For Shortness of Breath, or Difficult Breathing.—Vitriolated spirits of ether 1 oz., camphor 12 grains: make a solution, of which take a tcaspoonful during the paroxysm. This is found to afford instantaneous relief in difficulty of breathing, depending on internal diseases and other causes, where the patient, from a very quick and laborious breathing, is obliged to bo in an erect posture. 2671. Sprains.—A sprain is a stretching of the leaders or ligaments of a part through some violence, such as slipping, falling on the hands, pulling a limb, &c. &c. The most common are those of the ankle and wrist. The.so accidents are more serious than people generally suppose, and often more difficult to cure than a broken leg or arm. The first thing to be done is toTHE DOCTOR. 1089 place the sprained part in the straight position, and to raise it a little as well. Some recommend the application of cold lotions at first. The editress, how- ever, is quite convinced that warm applications are, in most cases, the best for for the first three or four days. These fomentations are to be applied in the following manner :—Dip a good-sized piece of flannel into a pail or basin full of hot water or hot poppy fomentation,—six poppy heads boiled in one quart of water for about a quarter of an hour ; wring it almost dry, and apply it, as hot as the patient can bear, right round the sprained part. Then place another piece of flannel, quite dry, over it, in order that the steam and warmth may riot escape. This process should be repeated as often as the patient feels that the flannel next to his skin is getting cold—the oftener the better. The bowels should be opened with a black draught, and the patient kept on low diet. If he has been a great drinker, he may be allowed to take a little beer; but it is better not to do so. A little of the cream of tartar drink, ordered in the case of burns, may be taken occasionally if there is much thirst. When the swelling and tenderness about the joint are very great, from eight to twelve leeches may be applied. When the knee is the joint affected, the greatest pain is felt at the inside, and therefore the greater quantity of the leeches should be applied to that part. When the shoulder is sprained, the arm should be kept close to the body by means of a linen roller, which is to be taken four or five times round the whole of the chest. It should also be brought two or three times underneath the elbow, in order to raise the shoulder. This is the best treatment for these accidents during the first three or four days. After that time, supposing that no unfavourable symptoms have taken place, a cold lotion, composed of a tablespoonful of sal-ammoniac to a quart of water, or vinegar-and-water, should be constantly applied. This lotion will strengthen the part, and also help in taking away any thickening that may have formed about the joint. In the course of two or three weeks, according to circumstances, the joint is to be rubbed twice a day with flannel dipped in opodeldoc, a flannel bandage rolled tightly round the joint, the pressure being greatest at the lowest part, and the patient allowed to walk about with the assistance of a crutch or stick. He should also occasionally, when sitting or lying down, quietly bend the joint back- ivards and forwards, to cause its natural motion to return, and to prevent stiff*- ness from taking place. When the swelling is very great immediately after the accident has occurred, from the breaking of the blood-vessels, it is best to apply cold applications at first. If it can be procured, oil silk may be put over the warm-fomentation flannel, instead of the dry piece of flannel. Old flannel is better than new. 2672. Cure for Stammering.—Where there is no malformation of the organs of articulation, stammering may be remedied by reading aloud with the teeth closed. This should be practised for two hours a day, for three or four months. The advocate of this simple remedy says^ " I can speak with certainty of its utility." 4 A -1090 HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT. 2673. Stammering,—At a recent meeting of the Boston Society of Natural History, Dr. Warren stated, " A simple, easy, and effectual cure of stammer- ing." It is, simply, at every syllable pronounced, to tap at the same time with the finger; by so doing, ^Hhe most inveterate stammerer will be surprised to find that he can pronounce quite fluently, and, by long and constant prac- tice, he will pronounce perfectly well." 2674. Suffocation, Apparent.—Suffocation may arise from many different causes. Anything v/hich prevents the air getting into the lungs will produce it. We shall give the principal causes^ and the treatment to be followed in each case. 2675. 1. Carhonic Acid Gas. ChoJce-Damx) of Mines,—This poisonous gas is met with in rooms where charcoal is burnt, and where there is not sufficient draught to allow it to escape; in coalpits, near limekilns, in breweries, and in rooms and houses where a great many people live huddled together in wretchedness and filth, and where the air in consequence becomes poisoned. This gas gives out no smell, so that we cannot know of its presence. A candle will not burn in a room which contains much of it.—Effects. At first there is giddiness, and a great wish to sleep; after a little time, or where there is much of it present, a person feels great weight in the head, and stupid ; gets by degrees quite unable to move, and snores as if in a deep sleep. The limbs may or may not be stiff. The heat of the body remains much the same at first.—Treatment, Remove the person affected into the open air, and, even though it is cold weather, take off his clothes. Then lay him on his back, with his head slightly raised. Having done this, dash vinegar-and-water over the whole of the body, and rub it hard, especially the face and chest, with towels dipped in the same mixture. The hands and feet also should be rubbed with a hard brush. Apply smelling-salts to the nose, which may be tickled with a feather. Dashing cold water down the middle of the back is of great service. If the person can swallow, give him a little lemon-water, or vinegar- and-water to drink. The principal means, however, to be employed in this, as, in fact, in most cases of apparent suffocation, is what is called artijicial hreathing. This operation should be performed by three persons, and in the following manner:—The first person should put the nozzle of a common pair of bellows into one of the patient's nostrils; the second should push down, and then thrust back, that part of the throat called "Adam's apple;" and the third should first raise and then depress the chest, one hand being placed over each side of the ribs. These three actions should be performed in the following order:—First of all, the throat should be drawn down and thrust back ; then the chest should be raised, and the bellows gently blown into the nostril. Directly this is done, the chest should be depressed, so as to imitate common breathing. This process should be repeated about eighteen times a minute. The mouth and the other nostril should be closed while the bellows are being blown. Persevere, if necessary, with this treatment for seven or eight hours—in fact^ till absolute signs of death are visible. Many lives areTHE DOCTOR. 1091 lost by giving it up too quickly. When the patient becomes roused, he is to be put into a warm bed, and a little brandy-and-water, or twenty drops of sal-volatile, given cautiously now and then. This treatment is to be adopted in all cases where people are affected from breathing bad air, smells, &c. &c. 2676. 2. Droioning.—This is one of the most frequent causes of death by suffocation.—Treatment Many methods have been adopted, and as some of them are not only useless, but hurtful, we will mention them here, merely in order that they may be avoided. In the first place, then, never hang a person up by his heels, as it is an error to suppose that water gets into the lungs. Hanging a person up by his heels would be quite as bad as hanging him up by his neck. It is also a mistake to suppose that rubbing the body with salt and water is of service.—Pro2')er Treatment Directly a person has been taken out of the water, he should be wiped dry and wrapped in blankets; but if these cannot be obtained, the clothes of the bystanders must be used for the purpose. His head being slightly raised, and any water, weeds, or froth that may happen to be in his mouth, having been removed, he should be carried as quickly as possible to the nearest house. He should now be put into a warm bath, about as hot as the hand can pleasantly bear, and kept there for about ten minutes, artificial breathing being had recourse to while he is in it. Having been taken out of the bath, he should be placed flat on his back, with his head slightly raised, upon a warm bed in a warm room, wiped perfectly dry, and then rubbed constantly all over the body with warm flannels. At the same time, mustard poultices should be put to the soles of the feet, the palms of the hands, and the inner surface of the thighs and legs. Warm bricks, or bottles filled with warm water, should be placed under the armpits. The nose should be tickled with a feather, and smelling-salts applied to it. This treatment should be adopted while the bath is being got ready, as well as when the body has been taken out of it. The bath is not absolutely neces- sary ; constantly rubbing the body with flannels in a warm room having been found sufficient for resuscitation. Sir B, Brodie says that warm air is quite as good as warm water. When symptoms of returning consciousness begin to show themselves, give a little wine, brandy, or twenty drops of sal-volatile and water. In some cases it is necessary, in about twelve or twenty-four hours after the patient has revived, to bleed him, for peculiar head-symptoms which now and then occur. Bleeding, however, even in the hands of pro- fessional men themselves, should be very cautiously used—non-professional ones should never think of it. The best thing to do in these cases is to keep the head well raised, and cool with a lotion such as that recom.mended above for sprains; to administer an aperient draught, and to abstain from giving anything that stimulates, such as wine, brandy, sal-volatile, &c. &c. As a general rule, a person dies in three minutes and a half after he has been under water. It is difficult, however, to tell how long he has actually been under it, although we may know well exactly how long he has been in it. This being the case, always persevere in your attempts at resuscitation until actual si;ofns of death have shown themselves, even for six, eight, or ten hours. 4 A 21092 HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT. Dr. Douglas, of Glasgow, resuscitated a person who had been under water for fourteen mmutes, by simply rubbing the whole of his body with warm flannels, in a warm room, for eight hours and a half, at the end of which time the person began to show the Jirst symptoms of returning animation. Should the accident occur at a great distance from any house, this treatment should be adopted as closely as the circumstances will permit of. Breathing through any tube, such as a piece of card or paper rolled into the form of a pipe, will do as a substitute for the bellows. To recapitulate : Rub the body dry ; take matters out of mouth; cover with blankets or clothes ; slightly raise the head, and place the body in a warm bath, or on a bed in a warm room; apply smelling-salts to nose ; employ artificial breathing; rub well with warm flannels ; put mustard poultices to feet, hands, and insides of thighs and legs, with warm bricks or bottles to armpits. DonH Heed. Give wine, brandy, or sal-volatile when recovering, and persevere till actual signs of death are seen. 2677. Briefly to conclude what we have to say of suffocation, let us treat of Lightning. When a person has been struck by lightning, there is a general paleness of the whole body, with the exception of the part struck, which is often blackened, or even scorched.—Treatment. Same as for drowning. It is not, however, of much use ; for when death takes place at all, it is generally instantaneous. 2678. CaiiE FOR THE Toothache.—Take a piece of sheet zinc, about the size of a sixpence, and a piece of silver, say a shilling ; place them together, and hold the defective tooth between them or contiguous to them ; in a few minutes the pain will be gone, as if by magic. The zinc and silver, acting as a galvanic battery, will produce on the nerves of the tooth sufficient electri- city to establish a current, and consequently to relieve the pain. Or smoke a pipe of tobacco and caraway-SGcds. Again— 2679. ^ small piece of the peilitory root will, by the flow of saliva it causes, afford relief. Creosote, or a few drops of tincture of myrrh, or friar's balsam, on cotton, put on the tooth, will often subdue the pain. A small piece of camphor, however, retained in the mouth, is the most reliable and likely means of conquering the paroxysms of this dreaded enemy. 2680. Warts.—Eisenberg says, in his ''Advice on the Hand," that the hydroclilorate of lime is the most certain means of destroying warts ; the process, however, is very slow, and demands perseverance, for, if discon- tinued before the proper time, no advantage is gained. The following is a simple cure :—On breaking the stalk of the crowfoot plant in two, a drop of milky juico will be observed to hang on the upper part of the stem ; if this be allowed to drop on a wart, so that it be well saturated with the juice, in about three or four dressings the warts will die, and may be taken off with the fingers. They may be removed by the above means from the teats ofTHE DOCTOR. 10D3 cows, where tliey are sometimes very troublesome, and prevent them stand- ing quiet to be milked. The wart touched lightly every second day with lunar caustic, or rubbed every night with blue-stone, for a few weeks, will destroy the largest wart, wherever situated. 2681. To Cure a Whitlow.—As soon as the whitlow has risen distinctly, a pretty largo piece should be snipped out, so that the watery matter may readily escape, and continue to flow out as fast as produced. A bread-and- water poultice should be put on for a few days, when the wound should be bound up lightly with some mild ointment, when a cure will be speedily com- pleted. Constant poulticing both before and after the opening of the whitlow, is the only practice needed; but as the matter lies deep, when it is necessary to open the abscess, the incision muat be made deep to reach the sup- puration. 2682. Wounds.—There are several kinds of wounds, which are called by different names, according to their appearance, or the manner in which they are produced. As, however, it would be useless, and even hurtful, to bother the reader's head with too many nice professional distinctions, we shall content om'selves with dividing wounds into three classes. 26S3. 1. Incised loounds or cuts—those produced by a knife, or some sharp instrument. 2684. 2. Lacerated, or torn wounds—those produced by the claws of an animal, the bite of a dog, running quickly against some projecting blunt object, such as a nail, &c. 2685. 3. Punctured or penetrating ivoiLnds—ihozQ produced by anything running deeply into the flesh ; such as a sword, a sharp nail, a spike, the point of a bayonet, &c. 2686. Class 1. Incised loounds or cuts.—The danger arising from these acci- dents is owing more to their position than to their extent. Thus, a cut of half an inch long, which goes through an artery, is more serious than a cut of two inches long, which is not near one. Again, a small cut on the head is moro often followed by dangerous symptoms than a much larger one on the legs.— Treatment. If the cut is not a very large one, and no artery or vein is wounded, this is very simple. If there are any foreign substances left in the wound, they must be taken out, and the bleeding must be quite stopped before the wound is strapped up. If the bleeding is not very great, it may easily be stopped by raising the cut pai-t, and applying rags dipped in cold water to it. All clots of blood must be carefully removed ; for, if they are left behind, they prevent the wound from healing. When the bleeding has been stopped, and the wound perfectly cleaned, its two edges are to be brought closely together by thin stiaps of common adhesive plaster, which should remain on, if there IS not great pain or heat about the part, for two or three days, without beingHOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT. 1094 removed. The cut part should be kept raised and cool. When the strips of plaster are to be taken off, they should first be well bathed with lukewarm water. This will cause them to come away easily, and without opening the lips of the wound ; which accident is very likely to take place, if they are pulled off without having been first moistened with the warm water. If the wound is not healed when the strips of plaster are taken off, fresh ones must be applied. Great care is required in treating cuts of the head, as they are often followed by erysipelas taking place round them. They should be strapped with isinglass-plaster, which is much less irritating than the ordinary adhesive plaster. Only use as many strips as are actually requisite to keep the two edges of the wound together ; keep the patient quite quiet, on low diet, for a week or so, according to his symptoms. Purge him well with the No. 2 pills (five grains of blue pill mixed with the same quantity of compound extract of colocynth; make into two pills, the dose for an adult). If the patient is feverish, give him two tablespoonfuls of the fever-mixture three times a day. (The fever^mixture, we remind our readers, is thus made: Mix a drachm of powdered nitre, 2 drachms of carbonate of potash, 2 tea- spoonfuls of antimonial wine, and a tablespoonful of sweet spirits of nitre in half a pmt of water.) A person should be very careful of himself for a month or two after having had a bad cut on the head. His bowels should be kept constantly open, and all excitement and excess avoided. When a vein or artery is wounded, the danger is, of course, much greater. These accidents, therefore, should always be attended to by a surgeon, if he can possibly be procured. Before he arrives, however, or in case his assistance cannot be obtained at all, the following treatment should be adopted :—Eaise the cut part, and press rags dipped in cold water firmly against it. This will often be sufficient to stop the bleeding, if the divided artery or vein is not dangerous. When an artery is divided, the blood is of a bright red colour, and comes away in jets. In this case, and supposing the leg or arm to be the cut part, a handkerchief is to be tied tightly round the limb above the cut; and, if possible, the two bleeding ends of the artery should each be tied with a piece of silk. If the bleeding is from a vein, the blood is much darker, and does not come away in jets. In this case, the handkerchief is to be tied below the cut, and a pad of lint or linen pressed firmly against the divided ends of the vein. Let every bad cut, especially where there is much bleeding, and even although it may to all appearance have been stopped, be attended to by a surgeon, if one can by any means be obtained. 2687. Class 2. Lacerated or torn wounds.—There is not so much bleeding in these cases as in clean cuts, because the blood-vessels are torn across in a zigzag manner, and not divided straight across. In other respects, however, they are more serious than ordinary cuts, being often followed by inflammation, mortification, fever, and in some cases by locked-jaw. Foreign substances are also more likely to remain in them. — Treatment. Stop the bleeding, if there is any, in the manner directed for cuts ; remove all substances that may be in the wound ; keep the patient quite quiet, and on low diet—gruel, arrowroot.1095 THE DOCTOR. and the like ; purge with the No. 1 pills and the No. 1 mixture. (The No. 1 pill: Mix 5 grains of calomel and the same quantity of antimonial powder, with a little bread-crumb, and make into two pills, which is the dose for an adult. The No. 1 mixture : Dissolve an ounce of Epsom salts in half a pint of senna tea. A quarter of the mixture is a dose.) If there are feverish symptoms, give two tables]30onfuls of fever-mixture (see above) every four houi'S. It possible, bring the two edges of the wound together, hut do not strain the parts to do this. If they cannot be brought together, on account of a piece of flesh being taken clean out, or the raggcdness of their edges, put lint dipped in cold water over the wound, and cover it with oiled silk, It will then fill up from the bottom. If the wound, after being well washed, should still contain any sand, or grit of any kind, or if it should get red and hot from inflammation, a large warm bread poultice will be the best thing to apply until it becomes quite clean, or the inflammation goes down. When the wound is a very large one, the application of warm poppy fomentations isbetter than that of the lint dipped in cold water. If the redness and pain about the part, and the general feverish symptoms, are great, from eight to twelve leeches are to be applied round the wound, and a warm poppy fomentation or warm bread poultice applied after they drop off. 2688. Class 3. Punctured or penetrating wounds. —These, for many reasons, are the most serious of all kinds of wounds.—Treatment. The same as that for lacerated wounds. Pus (matter) often forms at the bottom of these wounds, which should, therefore, be kept open at the top, by separating their edges every morning with a bodkin, and applying a warm bread poultice immediately afterwards. They will then, in all probability, heal up from the bottom, and any matter which may forai will find its own way out into the poultice. Some- times, however, in spite of all precautions, collections of matter (abscesses) will form at the bottom or sides of the wound. These are to be opened with a lancet, and the matter thus let out. When matter is forming, the patient has cold shiverings, throbbing pain in the part, and flushes on the face, which come and go. A swelling of the part is also often seen. The matter in the abscesses may be felt to move backwards and forwards, when pressure is made from one side of the swelling to the other with the first and second fingers (the middle and that next the thumb) of each hand. MEDICAL MEMOBA3MDA. 26S9. Advantages of Cleanliness.—Health and strength cannot be long continued unless the skin—the skin—is washed frequently with a sponge or other means. Every morning is best; after which the skin should be rubbed very well with a rough cloth. This is the most certain way of preventing cold, and a little substitute for exercise, as it brings blood to the surface, and causes it to circulate well through the fine capillary vessels. Labour produces thisHOUSEHOLD MANAGEMEKT. 1096 circulation naturally. The insensible perspiration cannot escape well if the skin is not clean^ as the pores get choked up. It is said that in health about half the aliment we take passes out through the skin. 2690. The Tomato Medicinal.—To many persons there is something un- pleasant, not to say offensive, in the flavour of this excellent fruit. It has, however, long been used for culinary purposes in various countries of Europe. Dr. Bennett, a professor of some celebrity, considers it an invaluable article of diet, and ascribes to it very important medicinal properties. He declares :— 1. That the tomato is one of the most powerful deobstruents of the materia mecUca ; and that, in all those affections of the liver and other organs where calomel is indicated, it is probably the most effective and least harmful reme- dial agent known in the profession. 2. That a chemical extract can be ob- tained from it, which will altogether supersede the use of calomel in the cure of diseases. 3. That he has successfully treated diarrhoea with this article alone. 4. That when used as an article of diet, it is almost a sovereign remedy for dyspepsia and indigestion. 2691. Warm Water.—Warm water is preferable to cold water, as a drink, to persons v/ho are subject to dyspeptic and bilious complaints, and it may be taken more freely than cold water, and consequently answers better as a diluent for carrying off bile, and removing obstructions in the urinary secretion, in cases of stone and gravel. When water of a temperature equal to that of the human body is used for drink, it proves considerably stimulant, and is particularly suited to dyspeptic, bilious, gouty, and chlorotic subjects. 2692. Cautions in visiting Sick-Rooms.—Never venture into a sick-room if you are in a violent perspiration (if circumstances require your continuance there), for the moment your body becomes cold, it is in a state likely to absorb the infection, and give you the disease. Nor visit a sick person (especiall}'- if the complaint be of a contagious nature) with an emjoty stomach ; as this dis- poses the system more readily to receive the contagion. In attending a sick person, place yourself where the air passes from the door or window to the bed of the diseased, not betwixt the diseased person and any fire that is in the room, as the heat of the fire will draw the infectious vapour in that direction, and you would run much danger from breathing it. 2693. Necessity of good Ventilation in Rooms lighted with Gas.— In dwelling-houses lighted by gas, the frequent renewal of the air is of great importance. A single gas-burner will consume more oxygen, and produce more carbonic acid to deteriorate the atmosphere of a room, than six or eight candles. If, therefore, when several burners are used, no provision is made for the escape of the corrupted air and for the introduction of pure air from without, the health will necessarily suffer.LEGAL MEMORANDA. CHAPTER XLiy. 2694. Humorists tell us there is no act of our lives wliich can bo per- formed without breaking through some one of the many meshes of the law by which our rights are so carefully guarded ; and tliose learned in the law, when they do give advice without the usual fee, and in the confidence of friendship, generally say, *^Pay, pay anything rather than go to law;" while those having experience in the courts of Themis have a wholesome dread of its pitfalls. There are a few exceptions, however, to this fear of the law's uncertanties; and we hear of those to whom a lawsuit is an agreeabla relaxation, a gentle excitement. One of this class, when remonstrated with, retorted, that while one friend kept dogs, and another horses, he, as he had a right to do, kept a lawyer; and no one had a right to dispute his taste. We cannot pretend, in these few pages, to lay down even the principles of law, not to speak of its contrary exposition in different courts ; but there are a few acts of legal import which all men—and women too—must perform; and to these acts we may be useful in giving a right direction. There is a house to be leased or purchased, servants to be engaged, a will to be made, or property settled, in all families; and much of the welfare of its members depends on these things being done in proper legal form. 2695. Purchasing a House.—Few men will venture to purchase a free- hold, or even a leasehold property, by private contract, without making themselves acquainted with the locality, and employing a solicitor to examine the titles, ; but many do walk into an auction-room, and bid for a property upon the representations of the auctioneer. The conditions, whatever they are, will bind him ; for by one of the legal fictions of which we have still sa many, the auctioneer, who is in reality the agent for the vendor, becomes also the agent for the buyer, and by putting down the names of bidders and the biddings, he binds him to whom the lot is knocked down to the sale and the conditions,—the falling of the auctioneer's hammer is the acceptance of the offer, which completes the agreement to purchase. In any such trans- action you can only look at the written or printed particulars ; any verbal statement of the auctioneer, made at the time of the sale, cannot contradict them, and they are implemented by the agreement^ which the auctioneer calla1098 HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT. on the purchaser to sign after the sale. You should sign no such contract without having a duplicate of it signed by the auctioneer, and delivered to you. It is, perhaps, unnecessary to add, that no trustee or assignee can purchase property for himself included in the trust, even at auction ; nor is it safe to pay the purchase-money to an agent of the vendor, unless he give a written authority to the agent to receive it, besides handing over the requisite deeds and receipts. 2696. The laws of purchase and sale of property are so complicated that Lord St. Leonards devotes five chapters of his book on Property Law to the subject. The only circumstances strong enough to vitiate a purchase, which has been reduced to a written contract, is proof of fraudulent representation as to an encumbrance of which the buyer was ignorant, or a defect in title ; but every circumstance which the purchaser might have learned by careful investigtition, the law presumes that he did know. Thus, in buying a leasehold estate or house, all the covenants of the original lease are presumed to be known. "It is not unusual," says Lord St. Leonards, 'Ho stipulate, in con- ditions of sale of leasehold property, that the production of a receipt for the last year's rent shall be accepted as proof that all the lessor's covenants were performed up to that period. Never bid for one clogged with such a con- dition. There are some acts against which no relief can be obtained ; for example, the tenant's right to insure, or his insuring in an office or in names not authorized in the lease. And you should not rely upon the mere fact of the insurance being correct at the time of sale : there may have been a prior breach of covenant, and the landlord may not have waived his right of entry for the forfeiture." And where any doubt of this kind exists, the landlord [should be appealed to. 2697. Interest on a purchase is due from the day fixed upon for completing: !where it cannot be completed, the loss rests with the party with whom the .delay rests; but it appears, when the delay rests with the seller, and the I money is lying idle, notice of that is to be given to the seller to make him 'liable to the loss of interest. In law, the property belongs to the purchaser from the date of the contract; he is entitled to any benefit, and must bear any loss; the seller may suffer the insurance to drop without giving notice; and should a fire take place, the loss falls on the buyer. In agreeing |to buy a house, therefore, provide at the same time for its insurance. Com- mon fixtures pass with the house, where nothing is said about them. 2698. There are some well-recognized laws, of what may be called good- neighbourhood, which affect all properties. If you purchase a field or house, the seller retaining another field between yours and the highway, he must of necessity grant you a right of way. Where the owner of more than one house sells one of them, the purchaser is entitled to benefit by all drains leading from his house into other drains, and will be subject to all necessary drains for the adjoining houses, although there is no express reservation as to drains.LEGAL MEMORANDA. 1099 Thus, if his nappens to be a leading drain, other necessary drains may be opened into it. In pvirchasing land for building on, you should expressly reserve a right to make an opening into any sewer or watercourse on the vendor's land for drainage purposes. ■2699. Constructions.—Among the cautions which purchasers of houses, land, or leaseholds, should keep in view, is a not inconsiderable array of con- structive notices, which are equally binding with actual ones. Notice to your attorney or agent is notice to you ; and when the same attorney is employed by both parties, and he is aware of an encumbrance of which you are igno- rant, you are bound by it; even where the vendor is guilty of a fraud to which your agent is privy, you are responsible, and cannot be released from the consequences. 2700. The Relations op Landlord and Tenant are most important to both parties, and each should clearly understand his position. The proprietor of a house, or house and land, agrees to let it either to a tenant-at-will, a yearly tenancy, or under lease. A tenancy-at-will may be created by parol or by agreement; and as the tenant may be turned out when his landlord pleases, so he may leave when he himself thinks proper; but this kind of tenancy is extremely inconvenient to both parties. Where an annual rent is attached to the tenancy, in construction of law, a lease or agreement without limitation to any certain period is a lease from year to year, and both landlord and tenant are entitled to notice before the tenancy can be determined by the other. This Qotice must be given at least six months before the expiration of the current year of the tenancy, and it can only terminate at the end of any whole year from the time at which it began ; so that the tenant entering into possession at Midsummer, the notice must be given to or by him, so as to terminate at the same term. When once he is in possession, he has a right to remain for a whole year; and if no notice be given at the end of the first half-year of his tenancy, he will have to remain two years, and so on for any number of years. 2701. Tenancy by Sufferance.—This is a tenancy, not very uncommon, arising out of the unwillingness of either party to take the initiative in a more decided course at the expiry of a lease or agreement. The tenant remains in possession, and continues to pay rent as before, and becomes, from sufferance, a tenant from year to year, which can only be terminated by one party or the other giving the necessary six months' notice to quit at the term correspond- ing with the commencement of the original tenancy. This tenancy at suf- ferance applies also to an under-tenant, who remains in possession and pays rent to the reversioner or head landlord. A six months' notice will be insuf- ficient for this tenancy. A notice was given (in Right v. Darby, I.T.R. 159) to quit a house held by plaintiff fis tenant from year to year, on the 17th June, 1840, requiring him "to quit the premises on the 11th October following, or such other day as his said tenancy might expire." The tenancy had com- menced on the 11th October in a former year, but it was held that this was1100 HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMEMT. not a good notice for tlie year ending October 11, 1841. A tenant from year to year gave his landlord notice to quit, ending the tenancy at a time within the half-year; the landlord acquiesced at first, but afterwards refused to accept the notice. The tenant quitted the premises ; the landlord entered, and even made some repairs, but it was afterwards held that the tenancy was not determined.. A notice to quit must be such as the tenant may safely act on at the time of receiving it; therefore it can only be given by an agent pro- perly authorized at the time, and cannot be made good by the landlord adopting it afterwards. An unqualified notice, given at the proper time, should conclude with " On failure whereof, I shall require you to pay mo double the former rent for so long as you retain possession." 2702. Leases.—A lease is an instrument in writing, by which one person grants to another the occupation and use of lands or tenements for a term of years for a consideration, the lessor granting the lease, and the lessee accepting it with all its conditions. A lessor may grant the lease for any term less than his own interest. A tenant for life in an estate can only grant a lease for his own life. A tenant for life, having power to grant a lease, should grant it only in the terms of the power, otherwise the lease is void, and his estate may 'bo made to pay heavy penalties under the covenant, usually the only one onerous on the lessor, for quiet enjoyment. The proprietor of a freehold— that is, of the possession in perpetuity of lands or tenements—may grant a lease for 999 years, for 99 years, or for 3 years. In the latter case, the lease may be either verbal or in writing, no particular form and no stamps being- necessary, exce]3t the usual stamp on agreements; so long as the intention of the parties is clearly expressed, and the covenants definite, and well under- stood by each party, the agreement is complete, and the law satisfied. In the case of settled estates, the court of Chancery is empowered to authorize leases under the 19 & 20 Vict. c. 120, and 21 & 22 Vict. c. 77, as follows 21 years for agriculture or occupation. 40 years for water-power. 99 years for building-leases. 60 years for repairing-leases. 2703. A lessor may also grant an under-lease for a term less than his own : to grant the whole of his term would be an assignment. Leases are frequently burdened with a covenant not to underlet without the consent of the landlord : this is a covenant sometimes very onerous, and to be avoided, where it is possible, by a prudent lessee. ■2704. A lease for any term beyond three years, whether an actual lease or an agreement for one, must be in the form of a deed ; that is, it must bo ''under sealand all assignments and surrenders of leases must be in the same form, or they are void at laiv. Thus, an agreement made by letter, or by a memorandum of agreem.ent, wdiich would be binding in most cases.LEGAL JIEMORANDA. liOl would be valueless when it v/as for a lease, unless witnessed^ and given under hand and seal. The last statute, 8 & 9 Vict. c. lOG, under which these pre- cautions became necessary, has led to serious difficulties. The judges," saya Lord St. Leonards, " feel the difficulty of holding a lease in writing, but not by deed, to be altogether void, and consequently decided, that although such a lease is void under the statute, yet it so far regulates the holding, that it creates a tenancy from year to year, terminable by half a year's notice ; and if the tenure endure for the term attempted to be created by the void lease, the tenant may be evicted at the end of the term without any notice to quit." An agreement for a lease not by deed has been construed to be a lease for a term of years, and consequently void imder the statute; '^and yet," says Lord St. Leonards, " a court of equity has held that it may be specifically enforced as an agreement upon the terms stated." The law on this point is one of glorious uncertainty; in making any such agreement, therefore, we should be careful to express that it is an agreement, and not a lease ; and that it is witnessed and under seal. 2705. Agreements.—It is usual, where the lease is a repairing one, to agree for a lease to be granted on completion of repairs according to specifica- tion. This agreement should contain the names and designation of the par- ties, a description of the property, and the term of the intended lease, and all the covenants which are to be inserted, as no verbal agreement can be made to a written agreement. It should also declare that the instrument is an agree- ment for a lease, and not the lease itself. The points to be settled in such an agreement are, the rent, term, and especially covenants for insuring and rebuilding in the event of a fire ; and if it is intended that the lessor's consent is to be obtained before assigning or underleasing, a covenant to that effect is required in the agreement. In building-leases, usually granted for 99 years,, the tenant is to insure the property ; and even where the agreement is silent on that point, the law decides it so. It is otherwise with ordinary tenements, when the tenant pays a full, or what the law terms rack-rent; the landlord is^ then to insure, unless it is otherwise arranged by the agreement, 2706. It is important for lessee, and lessor also, that the latter does not exceed his powers. A lease granted by a tenant for life before he is properly in possession, is void in law; for, although a court of equity, according to Lord St. Leonards, will, ^'by force of its own jurisdiction, support a hond fide lease, granted under a power which is merely erroneous inform or ceremonies," and the 12 & 13 Vict. c. 26, and 13 & 14 Vict. c. 19, compel a new lease to be granted with the necessary variations, while the lessor has no power to compel him to accept such a lease, except when the person in remainder is competent and willing to confirm the original lease without variations, yet all these difficulties involve both delay, costs, and anxieties. 2707. In husbandry leases, a covenant to cultivate the land in a husbandlike manner, and according to the custom of the district, is always implied ; butHOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT. 1102 it is more usual to prescribe the course of tillage whicli is to be pursued. In the case of houses for occupation, the tenant would have to keejD the house in a tenantable state of repair during the term, and deliver it up in like condi- tion. This is not the case with the tenant at will, or from year to year, where the landlord has t® keep the house in tenantable repair, and the tenant is only liable for waste beyond reasonable wear and tear. 2708. Insurance.—Every lease, or agreement for a lease, should covenant not only who is to pay insurance, but how the tenement is to be rebuilt in the event of a fire ; for if the house were burnt down, and no provision made for insurance, the tenant, supposing there was the ordinary covenant to repair in the lease, would not only have to rebuild,^ but to paj'- rent while it was being re- built. More than this, supposing, under the same lease, the landlord had taken the precaution of insuring, he is not compelled to lay out the money recovered in rebuilding the premises. Sir John Leach lays it down, that 'Hhe tenant's situation could not be changed by a precaution, on the part of the landlord, with which he had nothing to do." This decision Lord Campbell confirmed in a more recent case, in which an action was brought against a lessee who was not bound to repair, and neither he nor the landlord bound to insure; admitting an equitable defence, the court affirmed Sir John Leach's decision, holding that the tenant was bound to pay the rent, and could not require the landlord to lay out the insurance money in rebuilding. This is opposed to the opinion of Lord St. Leonards, who admits, however, that the decision of the court must overrule his dictum. Such being the state of the law, it is very important that insurance should be provided for, and that the payment of rent should be made to depend upon rebuilding the house in the event of a fire. Care must be taken, however, that this is made a covenant of the lease, as well as in the agreement, otherwise the tenant must rebuild the house. 2709. The law declares that a tenant is not bound to repair damages by tempest, lightning, or other natural casualty, unless there is a special covenant to that effect in the lease ; but if there is a general covenant to repair, the repair will fall upon the tenant. Lord Kenyon lays it down, in the case of a bridge destroyed by a flood, the tenant being under a general covenant to repair, that, ''where a party, by his own contract, creates a duty or charge upon himself, he is bound to make it good, because he might have guarded against it in the contract." The same principle of law has been applied to a house destroyed by lightning. It is, therefore, important to have this settled in the insurance clause. 2710. Lord St. Leonards asserts that ''his policies against fire are not so framed as to render the company liable." Generally the property is inaccurately described with reference to the conditions under which you insure. They are framed by companies who, probably, are not unwilling to have a legal defence against any claim, as they intend to pay what they deem a just claim without taking advantage of anv technical objection, and intend-LEGAL MEMORANDA. 1103 ing io make use of their defence only against what they believe to be a fraud, although they may not be able to proye it. But," says his lordship, " do not rely upon the moral feelings of the directors. Ascertain that your house falls strictly within the conditions. Even having the surveyor of the company to look over your house before the insurance will not save you, unless your policy is correct." This is true; but probably his lordship's legal jealousy overshoots the mark here. Assurance companies only require an honest statement of the facts, and that no concealment is practised with their surveyor; and the case of his own, which he quotes, in which a glass door led into a conservatory, rendering it, according to the view of the company, ''hazardous," and consequently voiding the policy, when a fire did occur, the company paid, rather than try the question; but even after the fire they demurred, when called upon, to make the description correct and in- dorse on the policy the fact that the drawing-room opened through a glass door into conservatories. One of two inferences is obvious here ; either his lordship has overcoloured the statement, or the company could not be the respectable one represented. The practice with all reputable offices is to survey the premises before insurance, and to describe them as they appear; but no concealment of stoves, or other dangerous accessories or inflammable goods, should be practised. This certainly binds the office so long as no change takes place ; but the addition of any stove, opening, or door through a party wall, the introduction of gunpowder, saltpetre, or other inflammable articles into the premises without notice, very properly "voids the policy." The usual course is to give notice of all alterations, and have them indorsed on the policy, as additions to the description of the property : there is little fear, where this is honestly done, that any company would adopt the sharp practice hinted at in Lord St. Leonards' excellent handy book. 2711. Breaks in the Lease.—^Where a lease is for seven, fourteen, or twenty-one years, the option to determine it at the end of the first term is in the tenant, unless it is distinctly agreed that the option shall be mutual, according to Lord St. Leonards. 2712. Noxious Trades.—A clause is usually introduced prohibiting the carrying on of any trade in some houses, and of noxious or particular trades in others. This clause should be jealously inspected, otherwise great annoyance may be produced. It has been held that a general clause of this description prohibited a tenant from keeping a school, for which he had taken it, although a lunatir asylum and publi c-house have been found admissible; the keeping an asylum not being deemed a trade, which is defined as '' conducted by buy- ing and selling." It is better to have the trades, or class of trades objected to, defined in the lease. 2713. Fixtures.—In houses held under lease, it has been the practice with landlords to lease the bare walls of the tenement only, leaving the lessee to put in the stoves, cupboards, and such other conveniences as he requires, at his1101 HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT. own option. These, except under particular circumstances, are the property of the lessee, and may either be sold to an incoming tenant, or removed at tho end of his term. The articles which may not be removed arc subject to considerable doubt, and are a fruitful source of dispute. Mr. Commissioner Fonblanque has defined as tenants' property all goods and chattels; 2ndly, all articles ''slightly connected one with another, and with the freehold, but capable of being separated without materially injuring the freeholdSrdly, articles fixed to the freehold by nails and screws, bolts or pegs, are also tenants* goods and chattels; but when sunk in the soil, or built on it, they are integral parts of the freehold, and cannot be removed. Thus, a green- house or conservatory attached to the house by the tenant is not remov- able ; but the furnace and hot-water pipes by which it is heated, may be removed or sold to the in-coming tenant. A brick flue does not come under the same category, but remains. Window-blinds, grates, stoves, cofiee- mills, and, in a general sense, everything he has placed which can be removed without injury to the freehold, he may remove, if they are separated from the tenement during his term, and the place made good. It is not unusual to leave the fixtures in their place, with an undertaking from the landlord that, when again let, the in-coming tenant shall pay for them, or permit their removal. In a recent case, however, a tenant having held over beyond his term and not removed his fixtures, the landlord let the premises to a new tenant, who entered into possession, and would not allow the fixtures to be removed—it was held by the courts, on trial, that he was justified. A similar case occurred to the writer : he left his fixtures in the house, taking a letter from the landlord, undertaking that the in-coming tenant should pay for them by valuation, or permit their removal. The house was let; tho landlord died. His executors, on being applied to, pleaded ignorance, as did the tenant, and on being furnished with a copy of the letter, the executors told applicant that if he was aggrieved, he knew his remedy; namely, an action at law. He thought the first loss the least, and has not altered his opinion. 2714. Taxes.—Land-tax, sewers-rate, and property-tax, are Iandlord'3 taxes ; but by 30 Geo. II. c. 2, the occupier is required to pay all rates levied, and deduct from the rent such taxes as belong to the landlord. Many landlords now insert a covenant, stipulating that land-tax and sewers-rato are to be paid by the tenants, and not deducted : this does not apply to the property-tax. All other taxes and rates are payable by the occupier. 2715. Water-Rate, of course, is paid by the tenant. The water-compa- nies, as well as gas-companies, have the power of cutting off the supply ; and most of them have also the right of distraining, in the same manner as land- lords have for rent. 2716. Notice to Quit.—In the case of leasing for a term, no notice is necessary; tho tenant quits, as a matter of course, at its termination; or

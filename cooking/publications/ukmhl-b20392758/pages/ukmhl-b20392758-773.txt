CHAPTER XXYIII. GENEBAIi OBSEBVATIOlSrS OIST CBBAMS, JELLIES, SOUFFLES, OMELETS, & SWEET DISHES. 1385. Creams.—The yellowish-white, opaque fluid, smooth and unctuous to the touch, which separates itself from new milk, and forms a layer on its surface, when removed by skimming, is employed in a variety of culinary preparations. The analyses of the contents of cream have been decided to be, in 100 parts—butter, 3*5 ; curd, or matter of cheese, 8*5 ; whey, 92'0. That 3ream contains an oil, is evinced by its staining clothes in the manner of oil; and when boiled for some time, a little oil floats ujDon the surface. The thick animal oil which it contains, the well-known luiter, is seiDarated only by agitation, as in the common process of cTturning, and the cheesy matter remains blended with the whey in the state of luitermiUc. Of the several kinds of cream, the principal are the Devonshire and Dutch clotted creams, the Costorphin cream, and the Scotch sour cream. The Devonshire cream is produced by nearly boihng the milk in shallow tin vessels over a charcoal rive, and kept in that state until the whole of the cream is thrown up. It is used for eating with fruits and tarts. The cream from Costorphin, a village of that name near Edinburgh, is accelerated in its separation from three or four days' old milk, by a certain degree of heat; and the Dutch clotted cream—a coagulated mass in which a spoon will stand upright—is manufactured from fresh-drawn milk, which is put into a pan, and stirred with a spoon two or three times a day, to prevent the cream from separating from the milk. The Scotch " sour cream " is a misnomer ; for it is a material produced without cream. A small tub filled with skimmed milk is put into a larger one, containing hot

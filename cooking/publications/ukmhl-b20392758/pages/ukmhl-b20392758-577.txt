RECIPESo CHAPTER XXIII. BOAST BLACK-COCK. 1019. Ikgeedients.—Black-cock, butter, toast. 3Iode.—Let these birds hang for a few days, or they will be tough and tasteless, if not well kept. Pluck and draw them, and wipe the insides and outsides with a damp cloth, as washing spoils the flavour. Cut off the heads, and truss them, the same as a roast fowl, cutting off the toes, and scalding and peeling the feet. Trus- sing them with the head on, as shown in the engraving, is still practised by many cooks, but the former method is now considered the best. Put them down to a brisk fire, well baste them with butter, and serve v/ith a piece of toast under, and a good gravy and bread sauce. After trussing, some cooks cover the breast with vine-leaves and slices of bacon, and then roast them. They should be served in the same manner and with the same accompani- ments as with the plainly-roasted birds. Time.—45 to 50 minutes. Average costy from 5s. to 6s. the brace; but seldom bought. Sufficient^—2 or 3 for a dish. Seasonahle from the middle of August to the end of December.

It is at present confined to the mora northern parts of Britain, culture and extending population having united in driving it into more desolate regions, except, jperhaps, in a few of the more wild and less-frequented portions of England. It may still be found in the New Forest, in Hampshire, Dartmoor, and Sedgmoor, in Devonshire, and among the hills of Somersetshire, contiguoiis to the latter. It may also be found in Staf- fordshire, in North Wales, and again in j the north of England; but nowhere so I plentiful as in some parts of the Iligh- i lands of Scotland. The males are hardly j distinguishable from the females until tiey are about half-grown, when the black 2 L BLACK-COCK.

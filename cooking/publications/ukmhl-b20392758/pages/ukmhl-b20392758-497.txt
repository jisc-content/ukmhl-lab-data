VEAL. 435 VEAL CAEVING. , BBSAST OF VEAL. 912. The carving of a breast of veal is not dissimilar to tliat of a fore-quarter of lainb, when the shoulder has been taken off. The breast of veal consists of two parts,â€” the rib-bones and the gristly brisket. These two parts should first be sepa- rated by sharply passing the knife in the direction of the lines 1, 2; when they are entirely divided, the rib-bones should be carved in the direction of the lines 5 to 6; and the brisket can be helped by cut- ting pieces in the direction 3 to 4. The carver should ask the guests whether they have a preference for the brisket or ribs ; and if there be a sweetbread served with the dish, as it often is with roast breast of veal, each person should receive a piece. CALF'S HEAD. 913. This is not altogether the most easy-looking dish to cut when it is put before a carver for the first time ; there is not much real difficulty in the operation, however, when the head has been attentively examined, and, after the ma^nner of a phrenologist, you get to knov7 its bumps, good and bad. In the first place^ inserting the knife quite down to the bone, cut slices in the direction of the line 1 to 2; with each of these should be helped a piece of what is called the throat sweetbread, cut in the direction of from 3 to 4. The eye, and the flesh round, are favourite morsels with many, and should be given to those at the table who are known to be the greatest connoisseurs. The jawbone being removed, there will then be found some nice lean; and the palate, which is reckoned by some a tit-bit, lies under the head. On a separate dish there is always served the tongue and brains, and each guest should be asked to take some of these. 2 F 2

iv PREFACE. best authority tliat I could obtain, given an account of tlie natural liistory of the animals and vegetables v^^hicli we use as food. I have followed the animal from his birth to his appearance on the table; have described the manner of feeding him, and of slaying him, the position of his various joints, and, after giving the recipes, have described the modes of carving Meat, Poultry, and Game. Skilful artists have designed the nrmierous drav/ings vfhich appear in this v/orli, and which illustrate, better than any description, many important and interesting items. The coloured plates are a novelty not without value. Besides the great portion of the book which has especial reference to the cook's department, there are chapters devoted to those of the other servants of the household, who have all, I trust, their duties clearly assigned to them. Towards the end of the work will be found valuable chapters on the Management of Children "—" The Doctor," the latter principally referring to accidents and emergencies, some of which are certain to occur in the experience of every one of us; and the last chapter contains " Legal Memoranda," which will be service- able in cases of doubt as to the proper course to be adopted in the relations between Landlord and Tenant, Tax-gatherer and Tax-payer, and Tradesman and Customer. These chapters have been contributed by gentlemen fully en- titled to confidence; those on medical subjects by an experienced surgeon, and the legal matter by a solicitor. I wish hero to acknowledge the kind letters and congratulations I have received during the progress of this work, and have only further to add, that I trust the result of the four years' incessant hiljour Y/hich I have expended will not be altogether unacceptable ,■:') som.e of my countrymen and countrywomen.

MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. 3^2 KOAST HAUITCH OF MUTTOlNr. 726. Ingeedients.—Hauncli of mutton, a little salt, flour. Mode—Let this joint hang as long as possible without becoming tainted, and while hanging dust flour over it, which keeps off" the flies, and prevents the air from getting to it. If not well hung, the joint, when it comes to table, will neither do i^^'^'"' ^^^^^^^^^ credit to the butcher or the cook, as it ^^M^ ^ '^y^^^^L ^^^1 ^® tender. Wash the outside ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ well, lest it should have a bad flavour from keeping; then flour it and put it HAWCH OF MUTTON-. _ , . , . , n I' ^ down to a nice brisk nre, at some distance, so that it may gradually warm through. Keep continually basting, and about i hour before it is served, draw it nearer to the fire to get nicely brown. Sprinkle a little fine salt over the meat, pour ofl" the dripping, add a little boiling water slightly salted, and strain this over the joint. Place a paper ruche on the bone, and send red-currant jelly and gravy in a tureen to table with it. 2Vme.—About 4 hours. Average cost, 10c?. per lb. Sufficient for 8 to 10 persons. Seasonable,—In best season from September to March. How TO But Meat Ecoi^omically.—If the housekeeper is not very particular as to the precise joints to cook for dinner, there is oftentimes an opportunity for her to save as much money in her purchases of meat as will pay for the bread to eat with it. It often occurs, for instance, that the butcher may have a superfluity of certain joints, and these he would be glad to get rid of at a reduction-of sometimes as much as Id. or \\d, per lb., and thus, in a joint of 8 or 9 lbs., will be saved enough to buy 2 quartern loaves. It frequently happens with many butchers, that, in consequence of a demand for legs and loins of mutton, they have only shoulders left, and these they will be glad to sell at a reduction. ROAST LEG OF MUTTOIT. 727. Ingeedients.—Leg of mutton, a little salt. Mode,—K^ mutton, when freshly killed, is never tender, hang it almost as long as it will keep; flour it, and put it in a cool airy place for a few days, if the weather will permit. "Wash off the flour, wipe it very dry, and cut off the shank-bone; put it down to a brisk clear fire, dredge with flour, and keep continually basting the whole time it is cooking. About 20 minutes before serving, draw it near the fire to get nicely brown ; sprinkle over it a little salt, dish the meat, pour off the dripping, add some boiling water slightly salted, strain it over the joint, and serve.

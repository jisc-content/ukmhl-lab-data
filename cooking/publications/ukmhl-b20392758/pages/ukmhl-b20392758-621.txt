Ingredients.—To each i gallon of water, allow 1 heaped tablespoonful of salt, a piece of soda the size of a shilling ; artichoke?. Mode.—Wash the artichokes well in several waters ; see that no insects remain about them, and trim away the leaves at the bottom. Cut off the stems and put them into hoiling water, to which have been added salt and soda in the above proportion. Keep the saucepan uncovered, and let them boil quickly until tender; ascertain when they are done by thrusting a fork in them, or by trying if the leaves can be easily removed. Take them out, let them drain for a minute or two^ aetichokes. and serve in a napkin, or with a little white sauce poured over. A tureen of melted butter should accom- pany them. This vegetable, unlike any other, is considered better for being gathered two or three days ; but they must be well soaked and washed previous to dressing. Time.—20 to 25 minutes, after the water boils. Sufficient^—a dish of 5 or 6 for 4 persons. Seasonable from July to the beginning of Sep- tember.

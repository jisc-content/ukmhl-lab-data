It is necessary to take these precautions, as sometimes a want of proper cleanliness in the dairymaid causes the outside of the butter to become rancid, and if the scraping be neglected, the whole mass would soon become spoiled. To choose salt butter, plunge a knife into it, and if, when drawn out, the blade smells rancid or unpleasant, the butter is bad. The layers in tubs will vary greatly, the butter being made at different times ; so, to try if the whole tub be good, the cask should beunhooped, and the butter tried between the staves.

And, in general, the more you can do without the em- ployment of butter that has been subjected to the influence of heat, the better. The woman of modern times is not a *'leech;'* but she might often keep the "leech" from the door, if she would give herself the trouble to invent innocent sauces. BUTTEK-MOU3LDS, for Moulding Fresli Butter. 1634. Butter-moulds, or wooden stamps for moulding fresh butter, are much used, and are made in a variety of forms and shapes. In using them, let them be kept scrupu- lously clean, and before the butter is pressed in, the interior should be well wetted with cold water; the butter must sisH or EOLLED BUTiEB. ^^^^^ prcssed iu, the mould opened, and the perfect shape taken out. The butter may be then dished, and garnished with a wreath of parsley, if for a cheese course; if for breakfast, put it into an ornamental butter-dish, with a little water at the bottom, should the weather be very warm.

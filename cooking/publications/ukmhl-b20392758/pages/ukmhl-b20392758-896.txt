MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. CHEESE. 1638. In families where much cheese is consumed, and it is bouglit in large quantities, a piece from the whole cheese should be cut, the larger quantity spread with a thickly-buttered sheet of white paper, and the outside occasionally wiped. To keep cheeses moist that are in daily use, when they come from table a damp cloth should be wrapped round them, and the cheese put into a pan with a cover to it, in a cool but not very dry place. To ripen cheeses, and bring them forward, put them into a damp cellar ; and, to check too large a production of mites, spirits may be poured into the parts affected. Pieces of cheese which are too near the rind, or too dry to put on table, may be made into Welsh rare-bits, or grated down and mixed with macaroni. Cheeses inay be preserved in a perfect state for years, by covering them with parchment, made pliable by soaking in water, or by rubbing them over with a coating of melted fat. The cheeses selected should be free from cracks or bruises of any kind. Cheese.â€”It is well known that some persons lilce cheese in a state of decay, and even " alive." There is no aceonnting for tastes, and it may be hard to show why mould, which is vegetation, should not be eaten as well as salad, or maggots as weU as eels. But, generally speaking, decomposing bodies are not wholesome eating, and the line must be drawn somewhere. STILTON CHEESE. 1639. Stilton cheese, or British Parmesan, as it is sometimes called, is generally preferred to all other cheeses by those whose authority few will dispute. Those made in May or June are usually served at Christmas; or, to be in prime order, should be kept from 10 to 12 months, or even longer. An arti- ficial ripeness in Stilton cheese is sometimes produced by inserting a small piece of de- cayed Cheshire into an aperture at the top. From 3 weeks to a month is sufficient time to ripen the cheese. An additional flavour may also be obtained by scooping out a piece from the top, and pouring therein port, sherry, Madeira, or old ale, and letting the cheese absorb these for 2 or 3 weeks. But that cheese is the finest which is ripened without any artificial aid, is the opinion of those who are judges in these matters. In serving a Stilton cheese, the top of it should be cut off to form a lid, and a napkin or flece of white paper, with a frill at the top, pinned round. When th 3 cheese goes from table, the lid should be replaced.

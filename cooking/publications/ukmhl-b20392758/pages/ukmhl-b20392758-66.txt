No caution can be too great to see that it is pure and good, as well as plentiful; for, knowing, as we do, that not a single part of our daily- food is prepared without it, the importance of its influence on the health of the inmates of a house cannot be over-rated. Ventilation is another feature which must not be overlooked. In a general way, enough of air is admitted by the cracks round the doors and windows ; but if this be not the case, the chimney will smoke ; and other plans, such as the placing of a plate of finely-perforated zinc in the upper part of the window, must be used. Cold air should never be admitted under the doors, or at the bottom of a room, unless it be close to the fire or stove ; for it will flow along the floor towards the fireplace, and thus leave the foul air in the upper part of the room, unpurified, cooling, at the same time, unpleasantly and injuriously, the feet and legs of the inmates.

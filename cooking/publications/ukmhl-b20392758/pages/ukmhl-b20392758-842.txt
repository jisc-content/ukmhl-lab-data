Ingeedients.—To every lb. of sugar allow J pint of water and k the white of an egg. 3Iode.—Put the sugar, water, and the wh ite of the egg, which should be well beaten, into a preserving-pan or lined saucepan; and do not put it on the fire till the sugar is dissolved. Then place it on the fire, and when it boils, throw in a teacupful of cold water, and do not stir the sugar after this is added. Bring it to the boiling-point again, and then place the pan by the side of the fire, for the preparation to settle. Eemove all the scum, and the sugar will be ready for use. The scum should be placed on a sieve, so that what syrup runs from it may be boiled up again: this must also be well skimmed. Ti7ne.—20 minutes for the sugar to dissolve ; 5 minutes to boil.

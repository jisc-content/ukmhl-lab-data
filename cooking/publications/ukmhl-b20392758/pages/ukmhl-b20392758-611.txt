GAME. 641 a fowl. The most valued parts are the same as those which are most considered in a fowl. SNIPE. 1060. One of these small hut delicious hirds may he j^iven, whole, to a p:entleman; hut, in helping a lady, it will he hetter to cut them quite through the centre, from 1 to 2, completely dividing them into equal and like portions, and put only one half on the plate. HAUNCH OF VENISON. 1061. Here is a grand dish for a knight of the carving-knife to exercise his skill upon, and, what will be pleasant for many to know, there is hut little difficulty in the 1 performance.

Although some epicures affect to believe that some parts of the haunch are superior to others, yet we doubt if there is any difference between the slices cut above and below the line. It should be borne in mind to serve each guest with a portion of fat; and the most expeditious carver will be the best carver, as, like mutton, venison soon begins to chill, when it loses much of its charm. WOODCOCK. 1062. This bird, like a partridge, may be carved by cutting it exactly into two like portions, or made into three helpings, as de- scribed in carving partridge (No. 1C57). The backbone is considered the tit-bit of a woodcock, and by many the thigh is also thought a great delicacy. This bird is served in the manner advised by Brillat Savarin, in connection with the pheasant, viz., on toast which has received its drippings whilst roasting; and apiece of this toast should inva- riably accompany each plate.

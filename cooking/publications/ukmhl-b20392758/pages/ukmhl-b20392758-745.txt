667 PUDDINGS AND PASTRT. Baisixs.—Eaisins are grapes, prepared by suffering them to remain on the -vine until they are perfectly ripe, and theu drying them in the sun or by the heat of an oven. The sun-dried grapes are sweet, the oven-dried of an acid flavour. The common way of drying grapes for raisins is to tie two or three bunches of them together, wl)ilst yet on the vine, and dip them into a hot lixivium of wood-ashes mixed with a little of the oil of olives : this disposes them to shrink and wrinkle, after which they are left on the vine three or four days, separated, on sticks in a horizontal situation, and then dried in the sun at leisure, after being cut from the tree.

CHSISTMAS PLUM-PUDDI^fG IIT HLOTJLT) When all these dry ingredients are prepared, mix them well together, then moisten the mixture with the - eggs, which should be well beaten, and the brandy; stir well, that every- thing may be very thoroughly blended, and press the pudding into a buttered . mould; tie it down tightly with a floured cloth, and boil for 5 or 6 hours. ^^^^^^ It may be boiled in a cloth without a mould, and will require the same time allowed for cooking. As Christmas puddings are usually made a few days before they are required for table, when the pudding is taken out of the pot, hang it up immediately, and put a plate or saucer underneath to catch the water that may drain from it. The day it is to be eaten, plunge it into boiling water, and keep it boiling for at least 2 hours ; then turn it out of the mould, and serve with brandy-sauce. On Christmas-day a sprig of holly is usually placed in the middle of the pudding, and about a wineglassful of brandy poured round it, which, at the moment of serving, is lighted, and the pudding thus brought to table encircled in Hame. Time.—5 or 6 hours the first time of boiling; 2 hours the day it is to be served. Average costy 4s. Suffvcient for a quart mould for 7 or 8 persons.

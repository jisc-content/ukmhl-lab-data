Alzjond.—The almond-tree is a native of warmer climates than Britain, and is in- digenous to the northern parts of Africa and Asia; but it is now commonly cultivated in Italy. Spain, and the south of France. It is not usually grown in Britain, and the fruit seldom ripens in this country : it is much admired for the beauty of its blossoms. In the form of its leaves and blossoms it strongly resembles the peach-tree, and is included in the same genus by botanists; but the fruit, instead of presenting a delicious pulp like the peach, shrivels up as it ripens, and becomes only a tough coriaceous covering to the stone inclosing the eatable kernel, which is surrounded by a thin bitter skin. It flowers early in the spring, and produces fruit in August. There are two sorts of almonds,— eweet and bitter; but fiiey are considered to be only varieties of the species; and though the qualities of the kernels are very different, they are not distinguishable by their appearance.

175 FISH CARVIJ^'G. SALMON. (For recipe, see No. 801; and for mode of dressing, Coloured Plate B.) First run the knife quite down to tlie bone, along the side of the fish, from a to 6, and also from c to d. Then help the thick part lengthwise, that is, in the direction of the lines from a to 6; and the thin part breadthwise, that is, in the direction of the lines from e to /, as shown in the engraving. A slice of the thick part should always be accompanied by a smaller piece of the thin from the belly, where lies the fat of the fish. Note.â€”Many persons, in carving salmon, make the mistake of slioing the thick part of this fish in the opposite direction to that we have stated; an-d thusj by the breaking of the flakes, the beauty of its appearance is destroyed. BOILED OR FBIBD SOLE. (For recipes, see Nos. 321 and 327.) The usual way of helping this fish is to cut it quite through, bone and all, distributing it in nice and not too large pieces. A moderately- sized sole will be sufiicient for three slices; namely, the head, middle, and tail. The guests should be asked which of these they prefer. A small one will only give two slices. If the sole is very large, the upper side may be raised from the bone, and then divided into pieces; and the under side afterwards served in the same way. In helping Filleted Soles, one fillet is given to each person. (For mode of serving, see Coloured Plate A.) TURBOT. (For recipe, see No. 337 ; and for mode of serving. Coloured Plate E.) First run the fish-slice down the thickest part of the fish, quite through to the bone, from a to and then cut handsome and regular slices in the direction of the lines downwards, from c to e, and upwards from c to c/, as shown in the engraving. When the carver has removed all the meat from the upper side of the fish, the backbone should be raised, put on one side of the dish, and the under side helped as the upper.

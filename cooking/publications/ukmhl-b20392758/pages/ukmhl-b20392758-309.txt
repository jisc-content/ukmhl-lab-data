s . THE LEAMlifGTON STOVE, OE KITCHEIfEB, VARIOUS MODES OF COOmG MEAT. CHAPTER XI. GENERAL REMAEKS. 540. In Our " Introduction to Cookery" (see No. 76) we have describccT tli8 gradual progress of mankind in the art of cookery, the probabiUty being, that the human race, for a long period, lived wholly on fruits. Man's means of attacking animals, even if he had the desire of slaughtering them, were very limited, until he acquired the use of arms. He, however, made weapons for himself, and, impelled by a carnivorous instinct, made prey of the animals that surrounded him. It is natural that man should seek to feed on flesh ; he has too small a stomach to be supported alone by fruit, which has not sufficient nourishment to renovate him. It is possible he might subsist on vegetables; but their preparation needs the knowledge of art, only to be obtained after the lapse of many centuries. Man's first weapons were the branches of trees, v/hich were succeeded by bows and arrows , and it is worthy of remark, that these latter weapons have been found with the natives of all climates and latitudes. It is singular how this idea presented itself to individuals so differently placed.

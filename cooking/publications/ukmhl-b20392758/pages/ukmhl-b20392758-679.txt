CHAPTER XXYL GENEBAIi OBSBBVATIONS OK PUDDINGS AND PASTBY. 1175. Puddings and Pastry, familiar as they may be, and unimportant as they may be held in the estimation of some, are yet intimately connected with the development of agricultm-al resources in reference to the cereal grasses. When they began to be made is uncertain ; but we may safely presume, that a simple form of pudding was amongst the first dishes made after discovering a mode of grinding wheat into flour. Traditional history enables us to trace man back to the time of the Deluge. After that event he seems to have recovered himself in the central parts of Asia, and to have first risen to eminence in the arts of civilization on the banks of the Nile. From this region, Greece, Carthage, and some other parts along the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, were colonized. In process of time, Greece gave to the Romans the arts which she had thus received from Egypt, and these subsequently diffused them over Europe. How these were carried to or developed in India and China, is not so well ascertained ; and in America their ancient existence rests only on I very indistinct traditions. As to who was the real discoverer of the use of corn, we have no authentic knowledge. The traditions of different countries I ascribe it to various fabulous personages, whose names it is here unnecessary i to introduce. In Egypt, however, corn must have grown abundantly; for I Abraham, and after him Jacob, had recourse to that country for supplies during times of famine.

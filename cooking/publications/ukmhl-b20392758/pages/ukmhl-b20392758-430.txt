MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. S72 bone 9 oz. The original cost was l^d. a pound ; but by this deduction, the cost rose to 9d. per pound with the bone, and lOld. without it, 794. Pork, to be Preserved, is cured in several ways,—either by covering it with salt, or immersing it in ready-made brine, where it is kept till required; or it is only partially salted, and then hung up to dry, when the meat is called white bacon ; or, after salting, it is himg in wood smoke till the flesh is impreg- nated with the aroma from the wood. The Wiltshire bacon, which is regarded as the finest in the kingdom, is prepared by laying the sides of a hog in large wooden troughs, and then rubbing into the flesh quantities of powdered bay- salt, made hot in a frying-pan. This process is repeated for four days ; they are then left for three weeks, merely turning the flitches every other day. After that time they are hung up to dry. The hogs usually killed for purposes of bacon in England average from 18 to 20 stone ; on the other hand, the hogs ■ killed in the country for farm-house purposes, seldom weigh less than 26 stone. The legs of boars, hogs, and, in Germany, those of bears, are prepared dif- ferently, and called hams. 795. The Practice in vogue Formerly in this country was to cut out the hams and cure them separately ; then to remove the ribs, which were roasted as spare-ribs," and, curing the remainder of the side, call it a '^gammon of bacon." Small pork to cut for table in joints, is cut up, in most places throughout the kingdom, as represented in the engraving. The side is divided with nine ribs to the fore quarter ; and the following is an enumeration of the joints in the two respective quarters :— r 1. The leg. Hind Quarter i 2. The loin. L 3. The spring, or belly, r 4. The hand. Fore Quarter < 5. The fore-loin. L 6. The cheek. The weight of the several joints of a good pork pig of four stone may be as follows; viz. :— The leg 8 lbs. The loin and spring . . 7 „ The hand 6 The chine 7 » The cheek . . from 2 to 3 „ BIDE OF A PIG, Of a bacon pig, the legs are reserved for curing, and snowiNG TRE ^^i^Q^^ c^^.g^j are called hams : when the meat is sepa- E\ERAL JOINTS. ^^^^^^ ^^^^ ^^^^ shoulder-bladc and bones and cured, it is called bacon.

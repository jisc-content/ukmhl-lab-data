DUTIES OF THE HOUSEMAID. 987 it necessary. No expectations of a personal character should influence them one way or the other. It would be acting unreasonably to any domestic to make them refuse such presents as tradespeople choose to give them ; the utmost that can be expected is that they should not influence their judgment in the articles suppliedâ€”that they should represent them truly to master or mistress, without fear and without favour. Civility to all, servility to none, is a good maxim for every one. Deference to a master and mistress, and to their friends and visitors, is one of the implied terms of their engage- ment ; and this deference must apply even to what may be considered their whims.

The number of assistants depends on the n\imber in the family, as well as on the style in which the establishment is kept up. In wealthy families it is not unusual for every grown-up daughter to have her waiting-maid, whose duty it is to keep her mistress's apart- ments in order, thus abridging the housemaid's duties. In others, perhaps, one waiting-maid attends on two or three, when the housemaid's assistance will be more requisite. In fact, every establishment has some customs peculiar to itself, on which v\^o need not dwell; the general duties are the s :.7n$ in all, perfect cleanhness and order being the object.

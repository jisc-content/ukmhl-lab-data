PEEFACE. I MUST frankly own, that if I liad known, beforeliand, tliat) lliis book wonld have cost me the labour which it has, I should never have been courageous enough to commence it. What moved me, in the first instance, to attempt a work like this, was the discomfort and suffering which I had seen brought upon men and women by household mismanagement. I have always thought that there is no m.ore fruitful source of family discontent tha,n ?u housewife's badly-cooked dinners and untidy ways.

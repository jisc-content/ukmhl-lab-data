In Spain, and some other countries on the continent, it is also usual to deprive oxen of life by the opera- tion of pithing or dividing tho spinal cord in the neck, close to the back part of the head. This is, in effect, the same mode as is practised in the celebrated Spanish bull-fights by the matador, and it is instantaneous in depriving the animal of sensation, if the operator be skilful.

The consequence is, that in London the carcass is there divided so as to obtain the greatest quantity of meat on the most esteemed joints. In many places, T 2 SIDE OP BEEF, SHOWING THE SEVEEAL JOINTS.

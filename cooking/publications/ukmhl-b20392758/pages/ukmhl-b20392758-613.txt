If we had to deal with yellow and blue only, the eyo would easily distinguish the one from the other; but when the two are blended, and form green, we cannot tell where the blue ends and the yellow begins. And so it is in the animal and vegetable kingdoms. If our powers of observation wore limited to the highest orders of animals and plants, if there v/ere only mammals, birds, reptiles, fishes, and insects in the one, and trees, shrubs, and herbs in the other, we should then be able v/ith facility to define the bounds of the two kingdoms ; but as we descend the scale of each, and arrive at the lowest forms of animals and plants, we tliere meet with bodies of the simplest structure, sometimes a mere cell, whose organization, modes of development and reproduction, are so anomalous, and partake so much of

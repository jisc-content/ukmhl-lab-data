733 CREAMS, JELLIES, OMELETS, ETC. TO MAKE A PLAIN OMELET. 1456. Ingeedients.—6 eggs, 1 saltspoonfiil of salt, i saltspoonful of pepper, 5 lb. of butter. 3fode—Break the eggs into a basin, omitting the whites of 3, and beat them up with the salt and pepper until extremely light; then add 2 oz. of the butter broken into small pieces, and stir this into the mixture. Put .^^f^f^^'^^^^^Z:'^ the other 2 oz. of butter into a frying- -^^^^^S^^^^^P pan, make it quite hot, and, as soon as it "^^"^ ■■ 1 begins to bubble, whisk the eggs, &c. very omelet. briskly for a minute or two, and pour them into the pan; stir the omelet with a spoon one way until the mixture thickens and be- comes firm, and when the whole is set, fold the edges over, so that the omelet assumes an oval form; and when it is nicely brown on one side, and quite firm, it is done. To take off the rawness on the upper side, hold the pan before the fire for a minute or two, and brown it with a salamander or hot shovel. Serve very expe- ditiously on a very hot dish, and never cook it until it is just wanted. The flavour of this omelet may be very much enhanced by adding minced parsley, minced onion or eschalot, or grated cheese, allowing 1 tablespoonful of the former, and half the quantity of the latter, to the above proportion of eggs. Shrimps or oysters may also be added : the latter should be scalded in their liquor, and then bearded and cut into small pieces. In making an omelet, be particularly careful that it is not too thin, and, to avoid this, do not make it in too large a frying-pan, as the mixture would then spread too much, and taste of the outside. It should also not be greasy, burnt, or too much done, and should be cooked over a gentle fire, that the whole of the substance may be heated without drying up the outside. Omelets are sometimes served with gravy; but this should never he poured over them^ but served in a tureen, as the liquid causes the omelet to become heavy and fiat, instead of eating light and soft. In making the gravy, the flavour should not overpower that of the omelet, and should be thick- ened with arrowroot or rice flour.

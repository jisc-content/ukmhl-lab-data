HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT. â– which imparts to the gift a value far beyond its actual amouut; and is by far its better part. True Charity, a plant divinely nursed, I'ed by the love from which it rose at first, Thrives against hope, and, in the rudest scene. Storms but enliven its unfading green ; Exub'rant is the shadow it supplies. Its fruit on earth, its growth above the skies. Visiting the houses of the poor is the only practical way really to understand the actnaJ state of each family j and although there may be difficulties in following out this plan in the metropolis and other large cities, yet in country towns and rural districts these objections do not obtain.

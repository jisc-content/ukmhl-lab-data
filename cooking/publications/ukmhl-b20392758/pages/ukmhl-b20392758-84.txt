MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY. 38 purposes, a pudding or a custard should be made, tliat the yolks may be used. All things likely to be wanted should be in readiness : sugars of different sorts ; currants washed, picked, and perfectly dry; spices pounded, and kept in very small bottles closely corked, or in canisters, as we have already directed (72). Not more of these should be purchased at a time than are likely to be used in the course of a month. Much waste is always prevented by keeping every article in the place best suited to it. Vegetables keep best on a stone floor, if the air be excluded; meat, in a cold dry place ; as also salt, sugar, sweet- meats, candles, dried meats, and hams. Rice, and all sorts of seed for puddings, should be closely covered to preserve them from insects ; but even this will not prevent them from being affected by these destroyers, if they are long and carelessly kept.

At length, however, this was effected, and from the Old Romney and Now Leicester a stock was produced that proved, in an eminent degree, the advantage of the cross ; and though the breed was actually smaller than the original, it was found that the new stock did not consume so much food, the stociving was increased, they were ready for the market a year sooner ; that the fat formed more on the exterior of the carcase, where it was of most advantage to the grazier, .rather than as formerly in the interior, v/here it v/ent to the butcher as offal; and though the wool v/as shorter and lighter, it was of a better colour, finer, and possessed of superior felting properties. 692. The Romney Marsh Breed is a large animal, deep, close, and com- pact, with white face and legs, and yields a heavy fleece of a good staple quality. The general structure is, however, considered defective, the chest being narrow and the extremities coarse ; nevertheless its tendency to fatten, and its early maturit}'", are universally admitted. The Romney Marsh, there- fore, though not ranking as a first class in respect of perfection and symmetry of breed, is a highly useful, profitable, and generally advantageous variety of the English domestic sheep. 693. Different Names have been given to sheep by their breeders, according to their age and sex. The male is called a ram, or tup ; after weaning, he is said to be a hog, or hogget, or a lamb-hog, tup-hog, or teg ; later he is a wether, or wether-hog ; after the first shearing, a shearing, or dinmont; and after each succeeding shearing, a two, three, or four-shear " ram, tup, or wether, according to circumstances. The female is called a ewe, or gimmer-lamb, till weaned, when she becomes, according to the shepherd's nomenclature, a gimmer-ewe, hog, or teg ; after shearing, a gimmer or shear- ing-ewe, or theave ; and in future a two, three, or four-shear ewe, or theave.

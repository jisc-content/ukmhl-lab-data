From the nature of vegetable substances, and chiefly from their not passing so rapidly into the putrescent state as animal bodies, the mode of preserving them is somewhat different, although the general principles are the same. All the means of preservation are put in practice occasionally for fruits and the various parts of vegetables, according to the nature of the species, the climate, the uses to which they are applied, &c. Some are dried, as nuts, raisins, sweet herbs, &c. ; others are preserved by means of sugar, such as many fruits whose delicate juices would be lost by drying ; some are preserved by means of vinegar, and chiefly used as condiments or pickles ; a few also by salting, as French beans ; while others are preserved in spirits. Vf e have, however, in this place to treat of the best methods of preserving fruits. Fruit is a most important item in the economy of health ; the epicurean C3. .: scarcely be said to have any luxuries without it; therefore, as it is so in- valuable, when we cannot have it fn.sh, we must have it preserved. It has long been a desideratum to preserve fruits by some cheap method, yet by such as would keep them fit for the various culinary purposes, as making tarts and other similar dishes. The expense of preserving them v.-ith sugar is a serious objection ; for, except the sugar is used in considerable quantities, the success is very uncertain. Sugar also overpov/ers and destroys the sub-acid taste so desirable in many fi-uits: those which are preserved in this manner are chiefly intended

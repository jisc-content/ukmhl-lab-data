CHAPTER XYI. GENERAL OBSEBVATIOHS OIT THE COMMON HOa. 765. The Hog belongs to the order Mammalia, the genus Sns scrofa, and the species Pachydermata, or thick-skinned; and its generic characters are, a small head, with long flexible snout truncated ; 42 teeth, divided into 4 upper incisors, converging, 6 lower incisors, projecting, 2 upper and 2 lower canine, or tusks,â€”the former short, the latter projecting, form-idable, and sharp, and 14 molars in each jaw ; cloven feet furnished with 4 toes, and tail, small, short, and twisted; while, in some varieties, this appendage is altogether wanting. 766. Fko:>i the Number and Position of the Teeth, physiologists are enabled to define the nature and functions of the animal; and from those of the Sus, or hog, it is evident that he is as much a grinder as a hiter, or can live as well on vegetable as on animal food; though a mixture of both is plainly indicated as the character of food most conducive to the integrity and health of its physical system, 767. Thus the Pig Tribe, though not a ruminating mammal, as might be inferred from the number of its molar teeth, is yet a link between the Jierhivorous and the carnivorous tribes, and is consequently what is known as an omnivoroiLS quadruped; or, in other words, capable of converting any kind of aliment into nutriment.

To every two pounds of Malaga raisins put four quarts of spring water, lay a bit of slate on the bung, and set it in the sun till it is fit for use. A large stone bottle will do as well as a cask, if it be kept in the chimney-corner, or near the side of the fire-place a proper flme. 864. Vinegar from Crabs. To one peck of crabs bruised, put nine gallons of cold spring water; let them stand about nine days, covering the tub with a cloth, and stirring them twice every day ; then strain the liquor through a hair-cloth, and put it into a cask iron-booped and painted. To every gallon of liquor, put one pound of sugar, and stir it in the cask several times to dissolve the sugar; set the cask in the sun, and cover it with a bit of slate or tile till ready for use. This makes good strong vinegar that will do for pickles.

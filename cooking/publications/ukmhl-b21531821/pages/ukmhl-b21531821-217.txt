To preserve Ripe Fruit without Sugar. The gooseberries, currants, cherries, raspberries, &c. should not be too ripe; being ready picked, fill bottles with the fruit till they will hold no more, allowing room for the cork ; and in filling, shake the bottles frequently. When filled, cork each bottle lightly, and then proceed to scald the fruit. This operation may be performed over a slow fire, either in a copper, or large kettle, fiist putting a cloth at the bottom to prevent the beat from cracking the bottles. The copper must be filled with cold water so as nearly to cover the bottles, which must be put into the water rather slanting till they reach the bottom, in order to expel the air that might lodge in the cavity at the bot- tom of them. The bottles should not touch the bottom or sides of the copper, and the heat of the fire should be such as gradually to raise the water in the copper to the temperature of 160 or 170 degrees by a brewing ther- mometer, in the course of about three quarters of an hour. For want of an instrument of this kind, the proper tem- perature may be determined by the finger, to which it will feel very hot, but will not scald. If the water should become too hot, a little cold water must be added to it, and when it has acquired the proper degree of heat, it must he kept at it as steadily as possible for about an hour, hut • '■! !(inc( r ns a g“rater In r,{. or !« :■:/• r : - : . » > ; k ;. * t. . i ■.. ,, .

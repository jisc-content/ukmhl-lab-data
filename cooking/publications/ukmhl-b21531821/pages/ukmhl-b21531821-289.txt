Sugar will not ferment, nor be fermented, without yeast, being dissolved in four times its weight of water, that is, four pounds of water to one of sugar: when once the fermentation begins, it continues to the end. 991. A new Method to clarify Sugar. Take ten pounds of fine loaf-sugar, break it in pieces, and put it in a pan with two quarts of water, in which beat up one pound of ivory-black, and two whites of eggs whipped up, melt it in a moderate heat, but take care the sugar does not boil; add a little cold water occasionally, to prevent ebullition; when the whole is dissolved, pass it through a flannel bag; at first it will run quite thick, but by returning it for a time or two into the bag, it will at length become as clear as spring water. This syrup is kept for the most delicate purposes of confectionary. 992. To clarify coarse brown Sugar. Suppose you take fifty pounds, put it in a pan that will hold a third more than the required quantity, and pour in twenty pints of water, but first well mixed with five whites, of eggs; take five pounds of small branch charcoal, finely pounded, mix it in the pan on the fire, and let it boil, it will look as black as ink ; if it rises too fast, add a little cold water; skim, and then strain it through a bag, at first it will be black, but continue to strain it till quite clear; it must repeatedly be returned, till it comes out as clear as the clarified loaf sugar.

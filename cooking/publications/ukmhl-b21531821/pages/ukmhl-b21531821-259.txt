Sweeten some new' milk to the taste, grate in a little nut- meg, add very little salt, and a little rennet, just enough to turn it to a very soft curd. It must be formed in the dish in which it is to be sent to table, after being drained through a thin cloth laid in a hair sieve. 884. To make Cheese to cat New. Take six quarts of new milk, turn if with a little rennet, and let it stand till it is a light curd; do not break it, but take it up in a dish, and lay it in a cloth iu a sieve, then cover it with a cloth and lay a board to fit within the sieve, lay a pound-weight upon it, and turn it into a dry cloth twice a day till all the whey is drained from it, then have boards to turn it upon, and keep wiping it often, till ready for use. 885. To keep Cream. Mix with any quantity of good cream, half the weight of finely powdered lump-sugar, stir it together till the sugar is dissolved, and preserve it in bottles well corked.

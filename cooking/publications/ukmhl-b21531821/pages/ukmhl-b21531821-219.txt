RESERVED FRUIT, JELLIES, &C. 193 strained into the syrup when boiling. The syrup must be boiled two or three times a week for a month, and must be cold before it is poured on the fruit, adding more sugar if requisite. Melons, before they are too ripe, are preserved in the same manner, allowing an ounce of roche alum, finely powdered, to twelve melons. Vine-leaves are preferable to cabbage-leaves, when they can be obtained. 730. Damsons. Wipe and prick the damsons, and put them into a deep stew-pot, adding one pound of sugar to three quarts of fruit; set them in a cool oven till they appear warm through, and be careful they do not burst; when you take them out of the oven drain the syrup carefully from them, and set it on the fire with another pound of sugar; let it boil ten or fifteen minutes, then pour it hot upon the dam- sons ; repeat the boiling of the syrup if necessary once or twice, till you think they will keep well. Cover them with double tissue paper dipped in olive-oil, pouring a tea- spoonful of oil on the paper, then tie bladders over. Plums, cherries, cucumbers, or any kind of fruit pre- served in syrup, may be covered in the same way. 731. To preserve Damsons. Gather the damsons quite dry, and wipe them with a cloth, taking out those that are bruised; put them in jars that will hold about three gills, and to three gills of fruit put quarter of a pound of good moist sugar; tie two blad- ders on separately, then set them in a pan of cold water oa the fire, and simmer them very gently about an hour, let them stand in the water till cold. The bladders should be washed in warm water and wiped dry, allowing plenty of room in tying them on the jars, as they are apt to burst. 732. Another Way. W ipe the damsons, and take a pound of sugar to thr^e pints of fruit, put them in a large jar, and set it in a pan

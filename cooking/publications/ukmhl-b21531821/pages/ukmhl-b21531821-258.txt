232 CHEESE, &C. 879. Cream Cheese. Boil two quarts of cream, put it to four quarts of new milk, the yolks of three eggs, three spoonsful of sugar, and as much rennet as will turn it; mix all together, and run it through a clean hair sieve; when turned to curd, take it into a cheese vat that will hold it all at once, lay a sinker (a board that will fit within the vat) upon it, and a weight upon that; let it stand till the next day; changing the cloth several times, and drawing it tighter each time, till it will go into a smaller vat. Turn it into clean cloths every day till ready for eating. The cloths should be very thin at the first. 880. Another Way.

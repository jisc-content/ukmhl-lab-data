Sweeten them with fine sugar, and add a few bitter almonds pounded fine, or boil a laurel-leaf in them, which will have the same effect; a little orange-flower or rose-water may be put in, according to the flavor prefer- red. Be very careful to stir them all the time they are on the fire, to prevent their curdling. Preserved oranges cut in halves, and the inside taken out and filled with this custard makes a very nice dish. The French often flavor their custards with a veiy small quantity of coffee or cho- colate, or with vanilla, either of which are very pleasant, but the latter particularly. 512. Common Custard. Boil a little cinnamon in a pint of new milk; when taken off the lire, put to it some biest, and sugar to the taste; more milk may be added, but as biest varies in quality, it is better to try a little of the mixture in the oven before you bake it in the crusts. A few bitter almonds, blanched and chopped fine, boiled in the milk, is a pleasant addition. Bake either in raised crusts, or in dishes lined with custard paste. Egg custard may be made in the same way, allowing five or six eggs (according to the size) to a quart of milk. 513. Gooseberry Custard, Scald green gooseberries in water, drain them from the water, and pulp them through a sieve ; to a pint of pulp put four eggs, two spoonsful of orange-flower water, and sugar to the taste. Set it over the fire till it thickens, when cold put it into custard cups. 514. Solid Custard. Boil one ounce of isinglass in a quart of new milk till dis- solved, beat well the yolks of five eggs and mix with the milk, then strain and set it on the fire till it thickens to the consistency of a boiled custard; sweeten to the taste, and pour it into a mould. A little cinnamon, or a few bitter almonds, boiled in the milk, is an improvement.

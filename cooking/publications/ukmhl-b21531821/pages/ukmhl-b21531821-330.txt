USEFUL FAMILY RECEIPTS. 304 1135. Remedies for Poisons. To counteract the effects of arsenic, mercury, antimony, or any of the mineral poisons, taken into the stomach, the liver of sulphur is the most efficacious medicine. Dissolve a large table-spoonful of the liver of sulphur in a pint of water, and give two table-spoonsful of the solution as soon as possible, and repeat it every ten or fifteen minutes for three or four doses, as occasion may require. If this pre- paration cannot easily be procured, a tea-spoonful of sul- phur, with eight or ten grains of salt of wormwood, will afford the best substitute. It will be proper to drink plen- tifully of warm water and to excite vomiting, by giving with the first dose of either the above medicines, or imme- diately after, two scruples of ipecacuanha-powder, and to hasten its operation by titillating the throat with a feather. Oil and milk may likewise be given. If neither liver of sulphur nor salt of wormwood can be readily procured, ten grains of pot-ash, or half a table- spoonful of soap-lees, may be given in a little water, or a strong solution of soap in water. The white of eggs mixed with water and sugar, is an antidote against corrosive sublimate. When mineral poisons, technically called oxide, whe- ther of copper or arsenic, are taken inwardly, one table- spoonful of powdered charcoal mixed either with honey, batter, or treacle, taken immediately, is a complete anti- dote. Within two hours administer either an emetic or cathartic. When any of the preparations of opium, hen-bane, night-shade, hemlock, tobacco, foxglove, or stramonium, or any poisonous fungus, mistaken for mushrooms, or spiritous liquors in excess, or any other deleterious matters have been swallowed, exciting sickness without pain in the stomach, or producing giddiness, drowsiness, and sleep,â€” give instantly one table-spoonful of flour of mustard in water, and repeat it in copious draughts of w arm water

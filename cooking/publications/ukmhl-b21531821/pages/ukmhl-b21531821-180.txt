154 BREAD, BUNS, &C, pose as a wet cloth. Be careful not to dry them, or they frill not be nice. 605. Common Crumpets. Take a pint and half of milk, just warm, mix with it five table spoonsful of good yeast, when it has stood to settle, pour it off by degrees into tfro pounds of Hour and a little salt, stirring it till well mixed, beat it till it become a thick batter. A small portion of salt of tartar dissolved in a little milk (in the proportion of about a tea spoonful to two pounds of flour) and stirred well in, is a great im- provement. When well risen bake them as above. 606. Potato Crumpets. Grate some potatoes of the most mealy kind into some clean water, rub them through a hair sieve adding plenty of water, then pour off the water leaving the starch quite clear at the bottom, mix it with the potatoes, and to about three pounds of potatoes mix half a pound of flour, an egg, and a little salt; bake them in the same manner as crum- pets, and butter them hot. A spoonful of yeast may be added. 607. Muffins. To three pounds of the finest flour, take a pint and a half of warm indk and water, with some good yeast well purified, and a little salt, strain the liquor into the flour, and beat it quarter of an hour ; set it an hour to rise, pull it into pieces the size of an egg, roll them in the hand like balls, put them on a cloth dredged well with flour a*nd laid on the hearth, lay a clean flannel over them as you roll them up, also keep the dough closely covered the whole of tve time. Ail the dough being rolled into halls, those first done will he ready for baking, and will spread out into the light form for muffins, lay them on the heated plate or stone, and as the bottom begins to change colour, turn them on the other side, but be cartful they do not burn.

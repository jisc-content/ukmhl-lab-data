203 PRESERVED FRUIT, JELLIES, &C. cloves, cover and let them stew gently till the pears look red and are tender. The common baking pears are the sort generally used for this purpose, but swan-egg pears done this way are extremely delicate. They will keep several months. Any of the common baking pears are very good, when pared and stewed in]a cool oven, with as much water as will cover them, in which the peels of the pears, some apple parings and cores have been boiled, allowing two pounds and w half pf sugar to a peck of fruit; cover with a plate that will fit inside the stew-pot, and tie a paper over. 809. To stew Pears purple. Peel some large pears, put them in a stew-pot and boil the parings in water just sufficient to cover them, then strain the liquor and add sugar to make it a syrup, pour it over the pears, and lay a pewter plate close upon them, then put on the cover quite close, and set them in a pan of water in a boiler over a slow fire, let them stew till quite tender, and they will be a fine colour. 810. To bottle Black Currants. Cut the currants from the stalks, when dry and fresh ga- thered, put them in clean bottles, with eight ounces of powdered loaf sugar to a quart of fruit; cork them loosely, and set them in a pan of cold water, with some hay between and under the bottles, set them on a slow fire till the fruit begins to shrink a little in the bottles, then take the pan off the fire, and let them stand till quite cold, rosin or cement the corks, and set the bottles in a cool place free from damp. 811. To bottle Damsons. Gather the damsons carefully before they are ripe, put them into wide-mouthed bottles, cork them loosely, and let them stand a fortnight, then look them over, and if anv be spoiled or mouldy, take them out, wipe, and cork the rest close; set the bottles in sand, the necks downward, and they will keep till spring, and be as good as fresh ones.

210 PRESERVED FRUIT, JELLIES, &C. 812. To bottle Damsons. Gather the damsons quite dry and sound before they are too ripe, put them in wide-mouthed bottles, cork them loosely, and set them in a moderate oven for three or four hours. All kinds of fruit that are bottled may be done in the same way, and if properly done, will keep good for two years. When cold, rosin the corks, and set them in a cool dry place, with the necks downward, to prevent them from fermenting. Be very careful the oven is not too hot or the bottles will fly. Cork them tight before they are quite cold. 813. To bottle Green Currants. Gather the currants when the sun is hot upon them, cut them from the stalks, and put them in clean dry bottles ; set them in a dry cool place, or keep them in dry sand, with the necks downward. Black Currants, before they are quite ripe may be done the same way. 814. To bo(tle Cranberries. Pick them quite clean and put them in clean bottles, fill them up with cold spring water that has been previously boiled; rosin the corks, and keep them in a cool place. American cranberries and clusterberries are kept in the same way. When to be used (or tarts, stew them a little with a few spoonsful of the water they have been kept in, and sugar. 815. To bottle Gooseberries. Pick gooseberries of the small round kind, put them in clean dry bottles, cork them, but not tight, put them in a pan of cold water and set them on a moderate fire, when the gooseberries change colour and begin to shrink a little in the bottles, take them off the fire and let them stand till cold, then cork them tight and rosin the corks. Keep them in dry saud in a cool place, with the necks downward.

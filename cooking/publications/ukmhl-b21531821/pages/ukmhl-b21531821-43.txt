SOUPS, &C. 17 onions, carrots, parsnips, sweet leeks, and celery, of each in proportion to its strength, adding half a pint of pease. While the soup is preparing put half a pint of lentils into a small pan, and stew them in a little water or vegetable broth; When soft, pulp them through a sieve. Wash quarter of a pound of rice very clean, and stew it with a piece of butter and some of the vegetable broth strained quite clear; when it is ready, add to it the lentil cullis or pulp, and season it well. If too thick put in some more of the broth. Add seasoning to the taste. 51 * Another Soup. Melt quarter of a pound of butter in a pan that will hold three quarts* fill it about half full with carrots and tur- nips cut into pieces rather larger than dice; set them mi the fire for a quarter of an hour, shaking them well frequently; tnen add as much water as will nearly fill the saucepan, and after letting it stew for an hour slice in three large onions, and put in a little rice ; Â»tew it together two hours longer; about quarter of an hour be- fore served up, stir in a tea-cupful of the raspings of bread, some salt, and Cayenne pepper. These preparations are best done over a small charcoal fire, taking particular care that they stew very gently, 52. iSavoy Soup. Take four good-sized Savoy cabbages, cut them in quar- ters and about half boil them, strain the water off, and when they are cool squeeze them as dry as possible, then put them into a pan with as much vegetable broth as will cover them, set them covered close on a moderate fire and let them stew two hours , melt quarter of a pound of butter in a frying-pan, with a little flour, stirring it till it is a fine brown, then put in two onions sliced, aud when they are fried a nice brown., pour in two quarts of vegetable broth, let it stew a few minutes, then pour it into the soup-pan, lay some crusts of French roll in the dish or tureen, and pour the soup noon them.

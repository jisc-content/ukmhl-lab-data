This complaint generally comes on with shiverings, pain in the head and back, sickness, and the ordinary symp- toms of fever : the eruption appears about the fourth day of the fever, and the pustules come to maturity about the tenth or eleventh day. On the first appearance' of the complaint, to keep down the feverish symptoms, and to prevent as much as possible the eruption from being great, a little opening medicine will be proper; also from fifteen to twenty drops of antimonial wine in a dose of saline mix- ture, every six or eight hours, till the feverish symptoms are abated; observing a low and cool diet, and drinking plentifully of lemonade, toast and water, cowslip-tea, or barley water, rather warm; the almond emulsion may also be taken freely. The patient should be kept cool. Cleanliness in this, as in all cases of fever, should be particularly attended to.

14 SOUPS, &c. all into a stew-pot with a little butter the size of a walnut, and a pint of vegetable broth, stew till the vegetables are quite tender; work them through a sieve with a wooden spoon, return the soup into the stew-pot or a pan, and add a quart of water, pepper and salt; boil all together and it will be ready for use. The green part of asparagus boiled a little, and cut about the size of pease, is a great improvement. 41. Soup made at Iver, in Bucks. Take two gallons and a half of water, a quart of split pease, previously soaked for twenty-four hours, two pounds of potatoes which have been well boiled, skinned and mashed the day before, herbs, salt, pepper, and two onions; boil them very gently together for five hours, covering it closely up, and allowing as little evaporation or steam from it as possible; then set it by to cool. It will produce rather better than two gallons of soup, and, if properly made, there will be no sediment, but the whole will be blended and mixed together, when it is warmed for use. 42. Kidney Bean Soup. Take a handful of sorrel, chervil, and a lettuce; wash and drain them in a sieve, chop them very fine, and put them in a saucepan. Boil quarter of a peck of white kid- ney beans, and with the broth moisten the herbs ; rub one half of the beans through a sieve and mix w ith the soup ; when it has boiled a few minutes add the yolks of four eggs and qnarter of a pound of fresh butter; season to the taste, and pour it on bread cut small. 43. Potato Soup. Peel and slice six large onions, six potatoes, six carrots, and four turuips ; stew them in quarter of a pound of but- ter, and pour on them four quarts of boiling water, adding some celery, sweet herbs, white pepper, and salt; stew it all gently four hours, then strain it through a coarse cloth ; have ready some onions, celery, and sage, to your laste; mix a little flour into a tea-cupful of water, boil it

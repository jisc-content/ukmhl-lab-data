OMELETS, FRITTERS, &c. Omelet should be fried in a small frying-pan made for that purpose, with a small quantity of butter. One of the great errors in cooking an omelet, is, that it is too tnin ; consequently, instead of being moist, the substance is little better than a piece of fried leather, therefore only use half the whites that you do yolks of eggs ; every care must betaken in trying, not to have too hot a fire, that it be not over-done, as much care should be taken as in poaching an egg. The objection to an omelet is that it is too rich: an addition of some finely mashed potatoes, about two table- spoonfuls to an omelet of six eggs, will much lighten it. Omelets are often served with gravy; but, as a general principle, no substance which has been fried, should be served in gravy, but accompanied by it; or what ought to eat crisp, becomes soddened and flat. In compounding the gravy, great care should be taken that the flavour does not overcome that of the omelet, a thing too little attended to ; a fine grai y with a flavour- ing of sweet herbs and onions, is perhaps the best; gra- vies to omelets are in general thickened; this should be done with potato flour or arrow-root.

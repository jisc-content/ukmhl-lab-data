Boil and mash some good mealy potatoes with a little but- ter and salt, add a little good yeast and a few spoonsful of milk, with as much flour as will make it the consistence of dough, roll it into cakes, let them rise two hours, then bake in a moderate oven.

When leaven is to be first produced, a lump of yeast dough muse be put into an earthen vessel, and set in a cool damp place. In about ten or fourteen days it will be in a proper state to use as a ferment for bread. At every making of bread, a sufficient quantity of the leavened dough should be laid by for leaven against the next baking. The makers of bread with leaven have learnt from experience, that it is best to use the same pan for keeping the leaven, and the same tub for making the bread, without ever washing them. They are kept clean by scraping. It is usual io borrow a piece of leaven to begin with; if this can be done, it is better than to make it for immediate

PICKLES, &C. 2*25 $57. Gooseberry Vinegar. Take three gallons of water, and four quarts of gooseber- ries bruised; place the whole in a tub, in which it must remain three days, being stirred often; then strain it off, and add to every gallon of liquor one pound of coarse sugar; pour the whole into a barrel with a toast and yeast. (The strength can be increased almost to any re- quired degree, by adding more fruit and sugar.) It must then be placed in the sun, and the bung-hole covered as before mentioned. 858. Gooseberry Vinegar. The gooseberries should be full ripe and bruised till all are broken; to every quart of pulp put five pints of cold water ; let it stand two days, stirring it three times a day, then strain it through a sieve, and afterwards through a flannel bag ; to every gallon put a pound and half of good moist sugar; when the sugar is dissolved, put it in a cask and stop it: if made of white or green gooseberries, the color will be finer. 859. Gooseberry Vinegar. Take the gooseberries when full ripe, stamp them small ; to every quart put three quarts of water ; stir them well together; let it stand twenty-four hours, then strain it through a canvas bag; to every gallon of liquor add one pound of brown sugar, and stir it well together before you barrel your liquor. The old bright yellow English gooseberries are the best. 860. Cowslip Vinegar.

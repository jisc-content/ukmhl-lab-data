no PIES, TARTS, &C. 470. Light Puff Crust. Mjs a pound and a half of flour with just water enough to make it into a paste, and a little salt, mould it lightly toge~ ther, and let it lie two hours ; then roll out the paste and put a pound of butter into the middle pfit, fold the ends of the paste over and roll it out, then fold it over again and roll it, repeat this six times in winter, and five in summer ; it should not be more than half an inch thick each time it is rolled, and a little flour dusted lightly over and undep it to prevent it slicking: this is a very light anil delicate crust. 471. Rice Paste for Sweets. BÂ» il quarter of a pound of ground rice in the smallest quantity of water, strain from it all the moisture as well as you can, beat it in a mortar with half an ounce of butter, and one egg vyell beaten, and it will make excellent paste for tarts. 472. Rich Puff Paste. To one pound of flour take three quarters of a pound of butter, break a little butter into the flour, and mix it with as little water as will make it in a stiff paste, roll it out, and lay the butter on ip thin slices, clredge i{ well with flour, double it up, and rqll it out thin twice, handle it as little as possible. It is better to roll the but- ter in at twice. Bake it in a qpick oven, or it will not be light? A paste less rich may be made with two pounds of flour and half a popnd of butter, rub them together, and mix into a paste with a little water, two well-beaten eggs and a little salt; fold it up and roll it four times. 473. Another Way. Beat, the white of an egg to a froth, add as much water as w ill make tweh e ounces of flour into a stiff paste, roll it very thin, and lay five ounces of butter on in small slices, dredge it, fold it up, and roll it out three times.

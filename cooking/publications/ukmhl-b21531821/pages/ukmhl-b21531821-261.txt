235 LEMONADE, FRUIT SHERBETS, &c. 890. Ginger Beer. To five gallons of water, take three pounds of brown sugar, one pound and a half of treacle, two ounces of ginger, and one ounce and a half of hops; bruise the ginger, and boil it with the hops half an hour in about three quarts of water, adding a table-spoonful of salt, then strain it upon the sugar and treacle, adding cold water to make up the five gallons ; stir in it two table-spoonsful of yeast, and let it stand till the next day, then put it in the barrel, leaving the cork rather loosely in; and after two days, close it up, adding a little isinglass, dissolved in a little of the beer, and in two or three days it will be quite ready for use. It will keep fresher, if bottled off, when clear, into clean stone bottles, that will hold two or three quarts each, put- ting in each bottle a tea-spoonful of brown sugar, and half a tea-spoonful of rice, and keeping the bottles well corked. 891.

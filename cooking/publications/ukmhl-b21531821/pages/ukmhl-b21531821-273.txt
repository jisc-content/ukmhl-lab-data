LEMONADE, &C. 247 of olive-oil into each, or a little more, if for larger bot- tles. Cork the bottles, and set them upright in a cool place. When you want lemon-juice, open such a sized bot- tle as you will use in two or three days ; wind some clean cotton round a skewer, and dipping it in, the oil will be attracted, and when that is removed, the juice will be as fine as when first bottled. This will keep good for several years. 934. Toast and Water. Take a piece of the upper crust of bread, about twice the thickness toast is usually cut; toast it carefully till it be well browned all over, but not at all blackened or burnt; put this into a jug, and immediately pour on it as much boiling water as you wish, cover the jug, and let it stand till cold ; the fresher made the better. A bit of fresh- pared lemon-peel, or dried orange-peel, infused with the water is a giateful addition, and makes a very pleasant summer drink; it may be drank freely without danger; but cold wrater, just taken from the pump, cannot. This is decidedly the best way of making it, but if wanted im- mediately :â€”Toast a small piece of white bread till very dry and brown, but do not burn it, put it immediately into a jug of cold spring water, or distilled water, cover it w ith a plate, and let it stand one hour before you use it. 935. Milk and Water. Put one-third of new milk to two-thirds of spring or dis- tilled water. It is best to drink it cold, but if warmed, it should be by putting warm water to cold milk, and not warmer than new milk. Butter-milk alone, or mixed with milk and water, is exceedingly wholesome, both for children and adults, and may be made quite delicious, by adding a little sugar and grated nutmeg. A table-spoonful of oatmeal, mixed in half a pint of water, is very grateful, and highly useful in allaying thirst.

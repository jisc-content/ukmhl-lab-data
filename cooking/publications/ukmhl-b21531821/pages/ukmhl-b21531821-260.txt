234 CHEESE, &C. The butter thus preserved is the better for keeping, and should not be used till it has been kept a month. This article should be kept from the air, in the best glazed earthen pots, that will hold from ten to fourteen pounds each. 887. To prevent Milk and Butter from tasting of Turnips. Pour a quart of boiling water to two ounces of saltpetre, when dissolved and cold put it in a bottle, or jug with a cover, and keep it for use ; put in two large spoonsful to every four gallons of milk immediately when brought in, stirring it well. This method, if constantly and regularly attended to, will effectually prevent both milk and butter from tasting either of turnip, cabbage, or any strong herb the cows may accidentally crop at any time. A little saltpetre, about the size of a walnut, may also be put in the cream-pot, stirring it well twice a day. 888. To purify rancid or tainted Butter. Melt and skim the butter as if for clarifying, then put in a piece of well-toasted bread. In a very few minutes the butter will lose its offensive taste and smell, but the bread will become quite foetid. 889. To make Salt Butter fresh. To every pound of butter allow a quart of new milk, put them in a churn with a little arnatto; churn them well to- gether, and in about an hour take out the butter, and treat it exactly as fresh butter, by washing it in water and add- ing the usual quantity of salt. By this process the but- ter gains about three ounces in the pound, and is equal to fresh butter. A common earthen churn will answer the purpose.

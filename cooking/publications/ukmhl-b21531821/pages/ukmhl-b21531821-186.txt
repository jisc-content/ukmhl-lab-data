ICO BREAD, BUNS, &C. 626. To make and preserve Yeast. (As praotised in America.) To make it:—Boil a handful of hops in three pints of water three or four minutes: the water must boil when the hops are put in: strain the liquor, and then thicken it with flour to the consistence of starch. Let it stand till it is about milk-warm, and put it into a jar large enough to allow room for it to rise; then add a tea-cupful of yeast, and let it work. To preserve it:—After the yeast has risen sufficiently, add as much meal made from Indian corn (or coarse flour) as will make it stiff enough to be rolled thin ; then, imme- diately, and before it rises a second time, roll it, and with a tea-cup or tin cutter, cut it into cakes, and dry them in the shade, in an airy room, or any other suitable place. Turn them three or four times a day. After they are quite dry, put them into a basket or bag, and keep them aired, and free from moisture. One of these cakes, soaked about fifteen minutes in cold w ater, will be suffi- cient for two good-sized loaves. 627. Flour, or Perpetual Yeast. Take a pound of fine flour, and mix it up with boiling water about the thickness of moderately thick w ater-gruel; add half a pound of coarse moist sugar, and when it is luke-warm pour it upon three large spoonsful of well puri- fied yeast in a pan large enough to ghe room for the fer- mentation. As it ferments take off the yeast, and put it into a stone bottle with a small neck, cork it, and keep it in a dry warm place. When half used, replenish it with flour and water prepared as at first, but no addition of yeast will be required. This is to be the regular process to keep up the stock. 628 Flour Yeast. Boil one pound of good flour, quarter of a pound of brown sugar, and a little salt, in two gallons of water for an hour.

326 USEFUL FAMILY RECEIPTS. 1219, To take out Fruit, or Acid Stains. Wet the linen, and lay on it some salt of tartar; then rub it without adding more water. Or—wet the spots without dipping, put two or three bits of common matches lighted into a small jar, and in- stantly hold the stained part over it. 1220. Another Way. Tie up in the stained part a little pot-ash, then scrape some soap into cold soft water to make a lather; boil the linen till the stain disappears. Or—pour boiling milk on the stained linen, and fet it lie live or six hours; then lay in the air till the stain comes out. Many stains may be removed by dipping the linen in sour buttermilk, and drying it in the sun. It should be wet as often as it dries, till the stains disappear. * 1221. To remove Grease-Spots from printed Books. Moisten the grease-spots with a camel-hair pencil dipped in rectified spirit of turpentine ; when dry, moisten it with a little spirit of wine, and it will remove any stain the tur- pentine may have left. 1222. To clean Oil-Cloths. Sweep off the dust; then wipe the oil-cloth with a clean tlanneJ; wet it over with milk, and rub with a dry cloth till bright. This method is preferable to cleaning them with wax. 1223. To clean Paint. Brush and wipe off all the dust quite clean; then scour the paint with soft water, with a little soda in it, using a little powdered whiting, and mottled or white soap; then wash it with a sponge and clean soft water with a little soda in it; then, immediately wipe it with linen cloths till quite dry.

To six gallons of water, take nine pounds of brown sugar, the whites of four eggs well-beaten, put in while the water is cold; when near boiling, skim it well, and boil it quarter of an hour; put it in a cask when about new-milk warm, with a little yeast spread on a toast; keep it in rather a warm place, stirring it frequently, the oftener the sooner it will be ready for use. 855. Sugar Vinegar. To one gallon of water, put one pound and half of sugar, dissolve the sugar in part of the water over the fire till it will make the whole just warm, then put it in a cask with a little alum and a little yeast, bung it up very lightly, and let it stand in a warm place till sour, then bottle it.

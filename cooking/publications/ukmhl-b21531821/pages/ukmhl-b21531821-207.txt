BISCUITS, CAKES, &C. 131 699. Italian Macaroons. Take a pound of Valencia almonds blanched, pound them quite fine with 1 be whites of four eggs, add two pounds and a half of finely sifted sugar, and rub them well together, put in by degrees ten or eleven more whites, working them well as you put them in; to try their lightness, it is best to bake one or two, and if heavy, add one or two more well-beaten whites; put the mixture into a biscuit funnel, and lay them on wafer paper, about the size of a small walnut for each macaroon; have ready about two ounces blanched and cut info slips, put three or four pieces on each, iav the n on three or four folds of paper on tins, or on baking wires, and bake in a moderate oven.

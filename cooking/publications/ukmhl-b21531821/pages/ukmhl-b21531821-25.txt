XlX. INTRODUCTION. Spirit from his birth; and it is said the Lord blessed him. It is also said of John the Baptist, “He shall be great in the sight of the Lord, and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink; and he shall be filled with the Holy Spirit, even from his mother’s womb.”—Now these things, no doubt, are recorded for our use and instruction. Tak ing, then, into consideration,what has been advanced, any rational person must be convinced that the drinking of intoxicating liquor is injurious to both body and mind; that its effects in families are seen to be destructive of all social comfort; and its pernicious influence on the morals of the community is beyond what either the tongue can express or the pen describe. If, then, we value our health; if we wish to enjoy domestic comfort and see our children sober; if we have any regard even for the tem- poral prosperity and happiness of society in general, we shall never again suffer another drop of that baneful liquor to touch our lips. But when we consider that our own eternal happiness, and the eternal happiness of millions is at stake, it being declared in Holy Writ that not only drunkards cannot inherit the kingdom of heaven, but that without holiness no man can see the Lord, we must allow that abstinence from those things which are calculated to grieve or quench the Holy Spirit, becomes an important religious duty. Let us, therefore, humbly desire to live continually under the influence of the glorified Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, and attend to this apostolic exhortation: “Whe- ther ye eat or drink, or whatever ye do, do all to the glory of God.” Salford, Augutl 22nd. 1829.

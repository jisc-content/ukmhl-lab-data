INTRODUCTION. dreadful and enlarging scenes ofwickedness and misery P “Common humanity would prevent a single murder, and restrain the uplifted arm, that would administer one deadly potion, or that aimed a deadly weapon at one innocent at the breast. But what is a single murder compared to the many thousands that are annually sent out of the world, by a slowhut sure poison ?

So that it is impossible to draw the line, or to say in what moderation consists : but if the teachers of religion will shew by their exam- ple as well as by precept, that it is not necessary, in

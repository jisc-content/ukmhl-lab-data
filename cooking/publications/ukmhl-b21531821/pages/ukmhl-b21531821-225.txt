PRESERVED FRUIT, JELLIES, &C. 1 99 749. An excellent Receipt for Red Currant Jelly. Take two-thirds of red currants to one of white, squeeze them, (without picking) strain, and press the juice through a hair sieve, and immediately make it quite hot, hut do not let it boil; to every pint of juice allow a pound of sugar, powdered fine and also made quite hot, have it ready to put to the hot juice, add it by degrees, stirring it all the time till the sugar is melted, then put it into pots imme- diately. This is both an economical and expeditious way, and has verv much the flavour of the fruit. Black currant jelly made the same way with a mixture of white currants is very superior to that made by boiling, only put the currants in the oven to stew with a little water, the juice being much thicker and more difficult to strain. 750. Cranberry Jelly. Make a very strong isinglass jelly, wheu cold mix it with double the quantity of cranberry juice, which must be pressed and strained from the fruit after having been stewed in a jar with a little sugar; sweeten with fine loaf- sugar, boil it up, and then strain it info a mould, 751. Barberry Jelly, Pick the fruit and put it into an earthen jar, with water enough to cover it: set the jar in a pan of cold water on the fire till the fruit is all burst, and the water is well in- corporated with the juice; then run the liquor through a jelly bag, and to every pint allow three quarters of a pound of fine sugar, and boil it till it will jelly. Black currant jelly may be made in the same way, but the jar must be only half-full of currants and filled up with water. 752. Orange Jelly. Grate the rinds of two Seville oranges, two China oranges and two lemons, squeeze the juice of six Seville and two China oranges and three lemons upon the grated rinds.

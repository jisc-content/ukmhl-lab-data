IV. INTRODUCTION. The same effect of aliment is discernible among the different nations of men. “ The Tartars,” says Sir John Sinclair, “who live principally on animal food, possess a degree of ferocity of mind and fierceness of character which forms the leading features of all car- nivorous animals. On the other hand, a vegetable diet gives to the disposition, as it appears in the Brahmin and Gentoo, a mildness of feeling directly the reverse of the former.” There can be no doubt, therefore, that the practice of slaughtering and devouring animals, has a tendency to strengthen in us a murderous disposition and brutal nature, rendering us insensible to pity and inducing us more easily to sanction the murdering of our fellow men. On the contrary, vegetable food clears the intel- lect, preserves innocency, increases compassion and love. We shall now proceed to shew that a vegetable diet ought to be preferred from a principle of humanity. It cannot be doubted, that there exists within us by nature a repugnance to the spilling of blood, and we cannot even see an animal tortured, much less, killed, without feelings of compassion: this feeling of the heart, implanted by the Deity, should be considered as a guide to human conduct. Had the Creator intended man to be an animal of prey, would He have implanted in his breast an instinct so adverse to His purpose ? Could He mean that the human race should eat their food with compunction and regret; that every morsel should be purchased with a pang, and every meal of man empoisoned with remorse?

Then ought we to induce others to commit what we cannot freely commit ourselves? Wild beasts of the field will

Restorative Means, if apparently drowned. Send quickly for Medical assistance, but do not delay the following means: Convey the body carefully, with the head and shoulders supported in a raised position, to the nearest house. Strip the body, and rub it dry; then wrap it in hot blankets, and place it in a warm bed in a warm chamber. Wipe and cleanse the mouth and nostrils. In order to restore the natural warmth of the body, move a heated covered warming-pan over the back and spine. Put bladders or bottles of hot water, or heated bricks, to the pit of the stomach, the arm-pits, between the thighs, and the soles of the feet. Foment the body with hot flannels; but, if possible, immerse the body in a warm hath as hot as the hand can bear without pain, as this is preferable to the other means for restoring warmth. Rub the body briskly with the hand ; do not, however, suspend the use of the other means at the same time.

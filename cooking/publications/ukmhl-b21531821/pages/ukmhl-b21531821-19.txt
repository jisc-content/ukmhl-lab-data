INTRODUCTION* Xtll. Ezekiel speaks of an abundance of fishers who should fish on its borders. We should recollect also, that when the net brake, while the disciples were fishing, the fish did not escape! Taking these circumstances into con- sideration, and viewing the subject impartially and uninfluenced by prejudice or appetite, we shall perhaps be justified in maintaining that the scriptures, properly understood, do not sanction the eating of either fish or animal flesh; at all events, there is reasonable ground for our entertaining such an opinion, and the Apostle says “He that doubteth is condemned if he eat; for what- soever is not of faith is sin ” Thus we have endeavoured, as far as our limits will allow, to state the grounds on which the members of the Society of Bible-Christians abstain from animal food, which is done not only in obedience to the j)ivine command, but because it is an observance which, if more generally adopted, would prevent much cruelty, luxury, and disease, besides many other evils which cause misery in society.

The practice of abstaining cannot be wrong; it must therefore be some consolation to be on the side of duty. If we err, we err on the sure side;—- itisinnocent;—itis infinitely better authorized, and more nearly associated with religion, virtue, and humanity, than the contrary practice: And w'e have the sanction of the wisest and the best of men—of the whole Christian world for several hundred years after the commencement of the Christian era. It is in opposition to a practice manifestly brutal and savage; a practice which cannot answer any ends but those of luxury, disease, cruelty and oppression—ends of all others the most opposed to the true principles of Christianity, b

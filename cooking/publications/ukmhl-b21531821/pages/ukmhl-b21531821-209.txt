biscuits, cakes, &c. 183 about half an inch thick in a tin warmed and well buttered ; bake in a moderately brisk oven.

Travellerâ€™s Gingerbread. Rub half a pound of butter in a pound and a half of flour, add a pound ot sugar, some grated lemon-peel, ginger to the taste, two eggs well beaten, and half a tea-spoonful of carbonate of soda dissolved in a little rose-water; mix all together in a stiff paste, roll it in balls, and bake in rather a moderate oven. 708. Transparent or Snap Gingerbread. Melt half a pound of butter, and mix it well with a pound of treacle and a pound of sugar, then put in ten ounces of flour, and quarter of an ounce of prepared ginger, a wine- glass of rose-water, and some grated lemon-peel; beat it a few minutes, and drop it on hot tins buttered ; bake it in a moderately quick oven. 709. Transparent or Snap Gingerbread. To three quarters of a pound of flour take one pound of sugar, melt quarter of a pound of butter in half a pound of treacle, and a glass of rose-water, with half a tea-spoon- ful of carbonate of soda dissolved in it, add mace and ginger, and a little grated lemon-peel, mix all well toge- ther, adding an egg well beaten ; let it stand two or three hours in a cool place, then drop it on warm tins well but- tered, and bake in rather a quick oven, and, while warm, after it has stood a short time, roll up the snaps lightly, the upper side outwards. As a crisp state adds much to the quality of this gingerbread, it will be found to answer best to make only a small quantity at once; and the paste keeps well in ajar covered close. 710. Parkin.

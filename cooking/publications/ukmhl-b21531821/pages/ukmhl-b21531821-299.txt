To make Vegetables tender. When pease, French beans, &c. do not boil easily, it has usually been imputed to the coolness of the season, or to the rains. This popular notion is erroneous. The diffi- culty of boiling them soft arises from an excess of gypsum imbibed during their growth. To correct this, throw a small quantity of carbonate of soda into the boiling water with the vegetables. 1028. German Cabbage Soup. Take a firm white cabbage, wash it well, and mince it, let it sweat on a slow fire in a little butter ; when it begins to be tender and to be a little reduced, moisten it with veget- able bioth, adding pepper and salt to the taste, and if required a little more butter may be stirred in ; w hen the soup gets a good colour, put in bits of bread cut the size of a penny, and it is ready for the table. 1029. Caleeannon. Is an Irish dish, and is made by boiling and mashing greens, young cabbage, or spinage, and then mixing them with good mealy mashed potatoes, butter, pepper, and salt, and pressing it into a basin or mould well buttered ; set it in a hot oven five or six minutes; then turn it out on a dish. In this dish two-thirds should be potato. Plain Caleeannon is made in cottages with infinitely less ceremony, and it is quite as good. Boil the greens or cabbage till nearly done; put the peeled raw potatoes to them; when done, drain the water very well from them ; dry them a little, and with pepper, salt, or shred onion, and a good piece of butter, beat them up together.

CREAMS, FLUMMERY, &C. 134 â€¢337. Quince Cream. Take quinces when quite ripe, pare and cut them in quar- ters, scald them till they are soft, pulp them through a hair sieve ; mix an equal weight of quince and Hue pow- dered sugar, and the whites of eggs beaten till as white as snow ; it is then ready to serve. Apple cream may be made in the same way. 538. Raspberry Cream. Mash the fruit gently, and let it drain through a sieve, sprinkling a little sugar on the fruit, which will pro- duce more juice, then put the juice to some cieam and sweeten it, then a little milk may be added, but the cream must be pu* in first or the milk will curdle. It may be made from jam or jelly when the fresh fruit cannot be ob- tained. If made with jam, put six ounces to a pr:t of cream, pulp it through asie^e, and add the juice of a lemon, whisk it in a shallow' dish ; lay the froth on a sieve adding a little mere lemon-juice; when no more froth will rise, put the ertam in a dish or glasses, and heap on the froth. Strawberry cream may be made the same way, 539. Raspberry Cream. Rub the pulp from a quart of raspberries through a hair sieve, mix it well with cream and fine sugar to the taste, put it in a stone jug and mill it with a chocolate mill of small whisk, taking off the froth as it rises, and laying it on a hair sieve, as mpeh as will be wanted, put the remainder in a glass dish, and heap the froth upon it. A mixture of strawberry and red currant cream, the fruit to be strained through a cloth strainer, may be made the same way. 540. Blanc-.mange.

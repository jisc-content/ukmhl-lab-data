PRESERVED FRUIT, JELLIES, &LC. 190 724. Black Currant Jam. Gather your currants when quite dry, pick them from the stalks, and bruise them in a bowl; to every two pounds of fruit, add a pound and half of loaf-sugar finely beaten, boil them an hour stirring them all the time, then put them into pots.

Fruit for desserts should be preserved with the stalks on. Let them remain in the water till cold, and keep them free from damp. 726. To preserve Wine-sours.

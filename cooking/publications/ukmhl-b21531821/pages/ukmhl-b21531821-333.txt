307 USEFUL FAMILY RECEIPTS.' pint of barley-water, an ounce of rose-water, two ounces of honey of roses, and half an ounce of nitre. 1142. Emollient or softening Gargles. Take an ounce of marshmallow-root, and two or three figs; boil them in a quart of water till one half be con- sumed ; then strain the liquor. By adding an ounce of honey, and half an ounce of water of ammonia, it will make an excellent diluting gargle. It is peculiarly bene- ficial in fevers, where the tongue and throat are rough and parched. It is also very superior to common acid gargles, in quinseys and inflammatory sore throats;â€”or, use a decoction of figs in milk and water, adding a little sal- ammoniac. A pint of boilifig water poured on a table-spoonful of the best green tea, kept covered close and used lukewarm, as a gargle, is highly useful in bilious fevers ; adding sugar and milk, if agreeable. A solution of two drachms of borax in seven ounces of rose-water, is also used as a gargle in bilious fevers, and thrush ; for the latter, add one ounce of honey of roses. 1143. Tooth Powder. Take four ounces of charcoal, beat and sift it fine, and mix if with two ounces of powder of bark. This forms an excellent tooth powder. The charcoal of the Areca (commonly called betel nut$, affords a superior powder to the prepared charcoal as a tooth powder. The tincture of rhatany root mixed with a little water, forms an excellent astringent lotion for the teeth, and should always accompany the use of the pre- pared charcoal; this tincture, by repeated use, has often succeeded in fastening loose teeth; but a little common salt, placed under the tongue regularly every morning, and held in the mouth till it dissolves, then rubbing the teeth with it, is probably a better cleanser and preserver of the teeth, than any application ^et known.

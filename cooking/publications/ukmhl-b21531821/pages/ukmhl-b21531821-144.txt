Pits, TARTS, &C. 118 sugar, add tins to the tart, and return it into the overt for five or six minutes. 467. Orange Tart. Line a tart pan with puff paste, put into it orange marma- lade chat is made with apple-jelly, lay small shreds of paste on crosswise. 468. Tarts made after the French manner. Having made a crust as directed for this purpose* roll it out, and cut it round by a plate, according to the size required for the tart. Lay the paste on a sheet of tin, then spread the sweetmeat upon it, which must be a jam or marmalade, not a sweetmeat made with syrup, but do not spread it too thick, leaving a border round the edge an inch, or an inch and a half wide, according to the size of the tart. Wet the border with a feather dipt in water, and then lay over it another border of the crust rolled toler- ably thick, so as to rise just above the sweetmeat. Orna- ment this border according to the fancy, and lay over the sweetmeat little ornaments of paste cut with the jagging iroh, or otherwise according to the taste; about an hour will bake it. Sift a little fine sugar over it before it is sent to table* If preferred, the border may be made of the light puff crust; it renders the tart rather more delicate. 469. A Crust for making the French Tarts. To a pound and half of flour allow three quarters of a pound of butter, and half an ounce of salt; put the flour in a bowl, make a hole in the middle, and put in the salt and butter cut in small pieces; pour in the water with great care, as there should only be water enough just to make it hold together and roll it smooth, work the butter and water up well together with the hands, and then by degrees mix in the flour; when the flour is all mixed in, mould the paste till it is smooth and free from lumps; let it lie two hours before it be used. It is also a very nice crust for putting round a dish for baked fruit pudding.

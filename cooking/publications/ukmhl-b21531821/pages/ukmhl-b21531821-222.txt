Let them lie three days; then make a syrup of three pounds 4 | of sugar to five of fruit, with no more water than hangs to large lumps of the sugar dipped quickly, and instantly brought out. Boil the plums in this fresh syrup, after draining the first from them. Boil them very gently till clear, and the syrup adheres to them. Put them singly into small pots, and pour the syrup over. These plums are apt to ferment, if not boiled in two syrups ; the first will make a pleasant liquor mixed with a little water, but will have too much acid to keep. Do not break them ; one parcel may be done after another, and thereby save much sugar. 740. Gooseberry Jam.

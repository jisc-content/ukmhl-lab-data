198 PRESERVED FRUIT, JELLIES, &C. half an ounce of bitter almonds mixed with a little pow- dered sugar to every pound of jam. Apricot Jam may be made the same way. 745. Strawberry Jam. Take ripe scarlet strawberries, bruise them, and add a little juice of red currants, put eleven ounces of sifted loaf sugar to every pound of fruit, set them over a clear fire, and boil forty minutes. When done put it in pots ; and when cold, paper them. 746. Apple Jelly. Fare and core some apples, put them in a stew-pan with as much water as will cover them, boil lery fast, when the fruit is all mashed add a quart of water, boil half an hour more, and run it through a jelly bag. Or, prepare apples as above, and add half an ounce of isinglass, boiled in half a pint of water to a jelly, put it to the apple water as strained through a coarse sieve, add sugar, a little lemon- juice and peel boiled all together, take out the peel and pour it into a dish. In summer, codlins are the best; in winter, golden rennets or pippins. 747. Another way to make Apple felly. Pare and core twenty golden pippins, boil them in a pint and half of spring water till quite tender, then strain the liquor through a colander: to every pint of liquor put a pound of fine sugar; add the grated rind of orange or lemon and boil to a jelly. Serve it up in jelly glasses. 748. Blackberry Jelly. Take blackberries when quite ripe, pick, and put them in a stew-pot covered close, set them in a pan of water, and let them stand over the fire till reduced to a pulp ; then strain and put to a pint of the juice, a pound of powdered loaf-sugar, and the juice of a lemon strained; boil it to a jelly, and pour it into pots for use. The rind of a lemon pared very thin may be boiled in it.

PIES, TAR 13, &C. 115 and cores in a little water, strain it, and when the pie is baked, pour it into the pie through a small funnel. If the apples are good, seasoning is unnecessary;â€”if they are insipid, a little grated lemon-peel and juice, quince marmalade, or a little grated nutmeg, is an agreeable ad- dition. Bake in a moderately hot oven. The dish should be quite tilled with apples, as they shrink very much in baking. 456. Pear Pie. Pare and slice the fruit, boil the parings a little with some apple parings and a bit of lemon-peel, in w ater, then strain ihe liquor, and put it in a broad pan with the sliced pears, stew them about quarter of an hour, adding sugar to the taste; pour them into a dish, and, when cool, proceed in the same way as for an apple pie, leaving out a part of the syrup to put in after the pie is baked. Pears that are not good for eating raw, being rather hard, are generally the best baking pears, and make ex- cellent pies when prepared as above. They are also very good mixed with apples. If of the softer kind, they do not, of course, require stew ing. 457. Gooseberry, and other Fruit Pies. Gooseberries, cherries, and currants, should be fresh gathered, picked, and washed; lay any of these fruits in a deep dish heaped to the centre, cover the edge of the dish with a shred of paste, allow about quarter of a pound of sugar to a quart of fruit, cover it with paste, and bake it in a moderately hot oven. Plums, damsons, a mixture of currants and raspberries, or any other kind of fruit, may be used for pies in the same way. Black currants, though not in general use for fruit pies, make a very good pie, of which many persons are ex- tremely fond, but if not quite ripe, they should be stewed in a little water, with the requisite portion of sugar, about quarter of an hour, and remain till cold before made' into a pie.

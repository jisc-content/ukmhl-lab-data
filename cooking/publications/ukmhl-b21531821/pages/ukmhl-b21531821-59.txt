33 EGGS, &C. 108. Eggs with Cucumbers. Peel some cucumbers, cut them in halves, take out the seeds, slice them and some onions, steep them in salt and vinegar an hour; dry and fry them; when a little brown, flour them; put iu a little water and let them stew. The sauce must not be thin ; if not tart enough* add a little lemon- juice, with a little pepper aud salt; lay poached or fried eggs on the cucumbers* 109. Asparagus and Eggs. Cut some asparagus (that has been previously boiled) the same as for pease, break six eggs into a basin, beat them up, put them with a little pepper and salt, and the aspara- gus, into a stew-pan, with two ounces of butter, and keep stirring it all the time it is on the fire; when it becomes thick it is done; then put a toast on the dish, aud pour the eggs and asparagriB on the toast. N. B. This should be served up immediately when done, for if permitted to stand it will not be good. 110. A Ragout of Eggs. Boil eight eggs hard, then shell and cut them in quarters. Have ready a pint of good herb gravy, well seasoned and thickened over the fire with two ounces of butter roiled in flour. When quite smooth and hot, pour it over the eggs, and serve them up. By using cream instead of gravy, putting an ounce more of butter and omitting the flour, this will make a fricassee. 111. Ragout of Eggs and Mushrooms. Take some large mushrooms, peel and scrape them clean, put them into a saucepan with a little salt, cover them* and let them boil a little, then put in a gill of milk, an ounce of butter rolled in flour, seasoned with mace and nutmeg: boil it till it be of a good consistency. Have ready six hard-boiled eggs, take out the yolks whole. Put some toasted sippets in a dish, and the yolks upon them, then pour over them the whole of your ragout.

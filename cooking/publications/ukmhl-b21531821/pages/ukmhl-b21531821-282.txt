Set a pan of water on the fire, then mix as much oatmeal in a basin with cold water, as will make it a proper con- sistence; when the water is hot (but not boiling), pour it upon the meal and water, and stir it well; take out the spoon, and leave it to settle about two minutes, then pom it carefully into the pan, leaving the coarse part of the meal at the bottom of the basin ; set it on the fire, stirring it till it boils, and in five minutes you will have excellent smooth gruel. Do not put any salt in, unless intended to be eaten with pepper and butter. It is very good without anything ; a little sugar and nutmeg may, however, be added, if preferred. A mistaken idea almost generally prevails, that water gruel is not nourishing ; it is, mi the contrary, a light, cleansing, nourishing food, either in sickness or in health, both for young and old.

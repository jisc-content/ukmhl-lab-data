Put five quarts of strippings, or afterings, as it is some- times called, that is, the last of the milk, into a pan with a large spoonful of rennet ;* when it is become curd, cut it through with a saucer or skimming-dish, just to break it; let it stand two hours, then spread a thin cloth in a sieve, put the curd in it and let the whey drain from it; break the curd a little with your hand, and put it into a vat with a two-pound weight upon it; when it has stood twelve hours, bind a fillet round, and turn it every day till dry, from one board to another. It may either be used in that state, or ripened, with dock-leaves or nettles, under and over, between two plates. If the weather be tolerably warm, it will be ready- in three weeks. 878. Cream Cheese. To four quarts of new milk put two of cream, mix them to- gether when cold, add as much boiling Avater as will make it new-milk Avarm ; when sufficiently curdled, lay a thin Avet cloth in a vat, then put in the curd with a dish, lay a board on that Avill go within the vat, lay on it a ten pound Aveight, and let it drain fourteen hours ; then take it out, and if too thick to dry soon, cut it in two with a string of packthread, and dry the parts separately. Do not put in any salt. * In Bavbary, instead of rennet, especiallyin the summer-season, they turn the milk with the flowers of the great-headed thistle, or wild artichoke.

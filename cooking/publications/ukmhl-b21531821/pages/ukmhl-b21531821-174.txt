148 BREAD, BUNS, ScC. wheat-flour in making bread, as directed in the following receipt. The potato-flour keeps well in tin cannisters or bottles, and may be very usefully applied to a variety of purposes. 586. Potato Flour. Twelve pounds of wheat-flour kneaded with six pounds of the fibre of potatoes, will nroduce, when well baked, twenty-one pounds of excellent bread. The mode of pre- paring the fibre is as follows: •‘“••After washing it in two waters, place it about an hour upon a sieve to drain, and add to it in its raw state the usual quantity of yeast mixed with a little Warm water and salt; let it stand about an hour, then work well in the twelve pounds of flour. It requires very little addition of water, but rather a longer time to rise. A wholesome bread may be made with the potato fibre and either harley flour or oatmeal. The addition of some of the potato flour which has been separated from the fibre (by washing and afterwards dried), would make it more nourishing. 1 n a time of scarcity and bad harvest the corn is gene- rally unsound, and often very difficult and troublesome to make the flour into bread at all; in such a case, the com- mon soda will be found one of the most simple and best means to remedy that defect, in the proportion of quarter of a pound to every fifteen pounds of flour; in some in- stances more might be required, and others less, accord- ing to the state of the flour. The flour should be made as dry as possible, and the soda either powdered fine and mixed with it, or dissolved in the water you make up the bread with. It is a much more wholesome ingredient to mix in bread than alum, and many other things which are used for that purpose, and has been repeatedly tried. When a loaf is hard baked, it answers exceedingly well to wash it very well with a clean cloth and cold watei, a short tim ? after it is taken out of the oven, or while it con- tinues hot; fold it jn a cloth, and lay it in the cellar a day or two before you cut it.

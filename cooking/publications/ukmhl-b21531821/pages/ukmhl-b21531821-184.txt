DREAD, BUNS, &C. 158 and three spoonsful of new yeast, make it into a light paste with half a pint of warm cream, let it stand an hour to rise ; then make it up into wigs. Bake them on tins in a quick oven. Caraway-seeds may be added if approved. They may also be made into large round cakes, crossed so as to be easily divided in quarters, and stand before the fire to rise on the tins, before they are baked. 620. Yorkshire Cakes. Dry a pound and a half of flour before the fire ; beat up an egg with a spoonful of good yeast, add three quarters of a pint of new milk luke-warm ; strain the whole through a hair sieve into the flour, mix it lightly into dough, and lot it rise by the fire an hour, then make it up into ^akes. rub the tins with very little butter, and let them be warm w hen you lay the cakes on them, cover with a thin cloth and let them rise on the hearth about twenty or thirty minut-s; bake them in a brisk oven. This makes very good buns, with a little good moist sugar and a few caraway-seeds. 621. Oatcake. Mix some good oatmeal with a little salt and warm water, and a spoonful or two of yeast, beat till it is quite smooth and rather a thick batter, cover and let it stand to rise, then bake on a hot bake-stone, in the same manner as crumpets, but notqnite so quick. Those who like them soured should “ lay the leaven” as it is called, over-night. 622. Clap Bread. Mix some oatmeal and water well together, about the same consistence as common dough, then roll it out into cakes as thin as possible; bake them on a stone or iron plate of a moderate heat over the fire ; when baked on both sides set them on an edge before the fire till perfectly dry. This bread will continue good many weeks if kept in a dry place. It is very gor/d with cheese or butter, and may be toasted if preferred.

Put two table-spoonsful of treacle into a pint of milk when near boiling, stirring it briskly over the fire till it curdles ; take it off the fire, and after standing a few minutes strain it, and take it warm immediately on going to bed. It pro- motes perspiration, and is readily taken by children. It may also be made the same way with buttermilk instead of milk. 1042. Refreshing Drinks in a Fever. Put a little tea-sage, two sprigs of balm, and a little wood- sorrel, into a stone jug, or tea-pot, having first washed and dried them ; peel thin a small lemon slice it, and put it in and a bit of the rind; then pour in three pints of boiling water, sweeten, and cover it close. Apple-tea is also excellent in fevers. 1043. Another most pleasant Drink. Put a tea-cupful of cranberries into a cup of water, and mash them : in the mean time boil two quarts of water with one large spoonful of oatmeal and a bit of lemon-peel; then add the cranberries, and as much fine sugar as will leave a sharp flavour of the fruit, boil all for half an hour, and strain it off. 1044. Another Fever Drink.

266 MISCELLANEOUS. 996. Devonshire White Pot Pudding. To a pint of cream put four eggs, beaten with a little halt, some grated nutmeg, or a little cinnamon, and some sugar, then slice very thin the crumb of a penny-loaf, put it into a dish, pour the cream and eggs to it, a handful of jar- raisins boiled, and a little fresh butter: bake it lightly. 997. Currant, Cherry, Strawberry, and Raspbary Waters. Mash any of the above fruits, straining the juice through a sieve, and afterwards through a flannel bag; water must then be added, with syrup (No. 924) to the taste; strain it again through the bag, and serve it up quite fresh. But the liquor is never so transparent or clear, as when the fruit is boiled in the water. 998. Lemon Essence. Rasp the lemons very thin ; to quarter of a pound of raspings allow one pound of sugar, powdered as fine as possible; mix it well till it is all of a colour and well in- corporated, press it down into small jars, tie white paper over it, and then leather or bladder; and in one month it will be ready for use. 999. Quintessence of Lcmoiupccl Take best oil of lemon one drachm, strongest rectified spirit of wine two ounces, introduced by degrees, till the spirit kills and completely mixes with the oil. This elegant and useful preparation possesses all the fragrance and flavour of the freshest lemon-peel. A few drops on sugar will in- stantly impregnate with the flavour anything you may wish to use it for. 1000. Cocoa Nut. Grate some cocoa nut on a dish, sift fine powdered sugar over it, then another layer of grated nut, witfi sugar, till the dish is filled. This is a very nice dessert dish.

189 PRESERVED FRUIT, JELLIES, kc. berries with the currant-juice half an hour before the sugai is added, and half an hour afterwards. For white raspberries use white currant juice. Another Wayâ€”Is to weigh an equal quantity of fruit and powdered sugar, boil the frnit on a slow fire an hour, then add the sugar, and boil it three quarters of an hour more. 721. Gooseberry Jam. Put twelve pounds of the red hairy gooseberries, when ripe, and gathered diy, into a preserving-pan, with a pint of raspberry-juice, strained as for jelly, boil rather quick, and mix them with a wooden spoon; when they have boiled about an hour, put to them six pounds of white Lisbon sugar, and simmer them slowly to a jam. It re- quires long boiling, or it will not keep; it is excellent for tarts or pulls. Look at it in two or three days, and if the syritp and fruit separate, it must be boiled longer. Cover with tissue paper dipped in olive oil. 722. To prepare Fruit for Children, a far more wholesome Way than in Pies and Puddings. Put apples sliced, or plnms, currants, gooseberries, &c, into a stone jar, and sprinkle as much sugar .as necessary among them; set the jar on a hot stove, or in a saucepan of water, [and let it remain till the fruit is perfectly done. Slices of bread, or rice, may be eaten with the fruit, the rice being plain boiled. 723. Currant Jam. Put any quantity of currants into a preserving-pan, with two pounds of sugar to every three pounds of currants, and a little raspberry-juice to dissolve the sugar; put in your currants, and boil them till, they are very clear. Put them into jars, and when cold, strew sugar over, cover with tissye paper, and keep them in a dry place.

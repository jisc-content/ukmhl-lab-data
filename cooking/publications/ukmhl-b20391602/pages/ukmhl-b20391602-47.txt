EXPLANATORY LESSONS 33 at which it should be cooked for food, and the thick- ening which then takes place should not be con- founded, as often happens, with the true cooking of starch. In order to understand the difference be- tween the proper cooking of starch and the simple bursting of the grains, let us consider the changes which take place in starch when it is subjected to different degrees of heat, and also those which are produced in it during the process of digestion. All starch in food is changed into dextrine and then into sugar (glucose, C6H12O0) in the process of digestion. Glucose is a kind of sugar, resembling cane-sugar, but it is not so sweet. Dextrine. Dextrine is a substance having the same chemical nature as starch, but differing in many of its properties. It may be described as a condition which starch assumes in the progress of its change into glucsoe. Exp. to show Dextrine. Carefully dry and then heat a little starch to about 400° Fahr. Keep it at this temperature until it turns brown, or for ten minutes. Then mix it with water, when it will dissolve, forming a gummy solution. Starch will not do this. Test it with iodine; bo blue color will appear. The re- markable thing about the relation of dextrine to starch is that although they differ so much in properties they have the same elementary composition. The change of starch into dextrine is an important point in cooking, because starch cannot be assimilated until the conversion has taken place, either before or after it is eaten. Now it will be seen that unless this change is either produced or approached in the cook- ing of starch-containing foods, they are not prepared as well as it is possible to prepare them; also, that it is not possible to cause this change at a low tempera- ture; therefore 140° (the temperature at which the grains burst) should not be regarded as the cooking

lGi RECIPES under a stream of water with a vegetable brush. Pare carefully so as not to waste the potato, and evenly, that they may look smooth and shapely. Cook them in a granite-ware kettle or covered saucepan, in enough salted boiling water to just cover them. If cold water is used, there is a greater loss of potash salts by solution, because of the longer time of exposure to the action of the liquid. The proportion of salt should be one teaspoon to a quart of water. Potatoes being already hydrated, it makes no great difference whether they are put into hot or cold water, except in the time which will be required to boil them and the slight loss of salts. For medium-sized pota- toes from thirty to forty minutes will be necessary after they begin to boil. The moment they feel soft when pierced with a fork they are done. Take them at once from the fire, drain off all the water, and dry them by gently moving the pan back and forth over the top of the stove for a minute. Serve as quickly as possible. Unless they are to be eaten at once, it is better to mash them, and keep them in the oven until needed. MASHED POTATOES For mashed potatoes the uneven sizes may be used; the large ones should be cut into small pieces. Pre- pare according to the foregoing rule, and when they are cooked and dried, add salt, butter, pepper, and cream, in the following proportions: 1 Pint of potatoes. 1 Teaspoon of butter. Â£ Teaspoon of salt. 1 Saltspoon of pepper (white). 2 Tablespoons of sweet cream or of milk.

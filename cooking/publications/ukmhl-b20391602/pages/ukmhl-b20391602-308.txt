294 THE FEEDING OF CHILDREN which extend into the bottle are to be avoided, on ac- count of the difficulty of making them perfectly clean inside. Cultures from these tubes always give large numbers of bacteria, as do also those made from the nipples, unless they are boiled. The intervals of feeding will vary somewhat with the age of the child. Once in two or two and a half hours during the day for the first six months, and evei-y three hours from the sixth to the twelfth month, is the general rule. The temperature of the meal should be 100Â° Fahr. A babe needs less variety in its food than older children, and they in turn require less than grown persons; but both must have a certain proportion of the five essential food principles. There is an impression in the minds of many that children should not have fat. This has perhaps sprung from the fact that mother's milk has a watery, thin appearance. It seems not rich; nevertheless it has a due proportion of fat, and it is extremely im- portant that this be maintained when cow's milk is diluted, for this cream is the best addition. Fat is needed not only for the growth of brain and nerves, which is very rapid in children, but also for the perfect formation of other tissues. The following table is that given by Dr. Louis Starr as a guide for feeding: General Rules for Feeding. , Intervals of AOe- Feeding.

61 EXPLANATORY LESSONS liquefied at the temperature of the body. When eateu in the form of adipose tissue, as the fat of beef and mutton, the vesicles or cells in which the fat is held are dissociated or dissolved, the fat is set free, and mingles with the digesting mass. This is done in the stomach, and is a preparation for its further change in the intestines. Fats are not dissolved—that is, in the sense in which meats and other foods are dissolved—in the process of digestion; the chief change which they undergo is a minute subdivision caused principally by the action of the pancreatic juice. In this condition of fine emulsion they are taken up by the lacteals; they may also be absorbed by the blood-vessels. It has been found that fat emulsions pass more easily through membranes which have been moistened with bile, and it is probable that the function of bile is partly to facilitate the absorption of fat. That the pancreatic juice is the chief agent in forming fats into emulsion was discovered in 1848. Bile is, however, essential to their perfect digestion, and we may there- fore say that they are digested by the united action of the pancreatic juice and the bile.1 Fat forms in the body fatty tissues, and serves for muscular force and heat; it is also necessary to nour- ish nerves and other tissues,— in fact, without it healthy tissues cannot be formed. A proper amount of fat is also a sort of albumen sparer. It is probable that the fat which is used in the body either to be stored away or for energy, is de- rived from other sources than directly from the fat eaten. From experiments made by Lawes and Gil- bert on pigs, it is evident that the excess of fat stored in their bodies must be derived from some other source than the fat contained in their food, and must 1 Flint's "Physiology."

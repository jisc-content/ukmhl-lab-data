THE FEEDING OF CHILDREN 297 2 Tablespoons of milk. 2 Tablespoons of water. 1 Tablespoon of cream. 1 Small measure of peptogenic milk powder. Put all into a bottle, shake it well, place it in a bath or kettle of hot water of a temperature of 115° Fahr. (so hot that the hand cannot be borne in it long without discomfort), and keep it at that tem- perature for exactly thirty minutes; then pour it into a saucepan, and heat quickly to the boiling point. By this method a very thorough predigestion takes place. The process should be stopped before the bit- ter taste is developed. From the Sixth to the Tenth Month Increase the proportion of milk and of Mellin's food, or other attenuant used.1 4 Tablespoons of cow's milk. 3 Tablespoons of water. 1£ Teaspoons of cream. 1 Tablespoon of Mellin's food. £ Teaspoon of milk-sugar. Boil the water, then add the milk, Mellin's food, cream, and sugar, or put all together in a feeding-bot- tle, place in a kettle of water heated to 190° Fahr., and keep it at that temperature for one hour.2 This amount is only a general rule, and may, of course, be varied according to the age and individual need of the child. The proportion of the ingredients should, however, not be changed. 1 Malted milk, Nestl6's food, Ridge's food, Imperial Granum, or bar- ley-flour, may be used as attenuants. 2 Enough for tbe whole day may bo made by multiplying the rule by eight, dividing tbe quantity into eight bottles, and sterilizing aJl at once. Keep in a cool place until needed.

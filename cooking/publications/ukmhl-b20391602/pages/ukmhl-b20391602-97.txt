The largest constituent of grains is starch, which is not easily digested unless well cooked; therefore the time for boiling gruels should be conscientiously kept by the clock. Should the water evaporate, re- store to the original quantity before putting in the milk, which should be hot, though not boiling. It may, however, come just to the boiling-point without any special injury. Gruels served with a cream- or a banquet-cracker or a square of toasted bread are excellent for a con- valescent's lunch.

267 SERVING If cooking be a science, then serving is an art. It perhaps more closely resembles painting than any- other, for a well-spread table shonld be a picture, and each separate dish a choice bit in the landscape. The invalid's tray should be a dainty Dresden water-color of delicate hues and harmonious tints. It is not easy to give definite directions in regard to serving, for it involves so much of good taste in so many directions, and depends so largely upon the in- dividual and the circumstances. It requires intelli- gent study, a cultivated habit of thought, and the appreciation of symmetry, and the harmony of colors; to do it well one must ever judge anew and arrange again, for no two meals are exactly alike in all their details. Of course, the most important thing in serving is the thing to be served. A badly prepared or un- wholesome dish, no matter how beautifully it may be presented, is worthlessâ€”perhaps even worse, for it may prove a positive source of evil. An indifferently done steak, served on a silver platter, is less accepta- ble than one perfectly cooked on plain china, or a bit of burned toast on Dresden ware than a daintily browned piece on a common white plate. Put the force, therefore, of your efforts on securing that which is wholesome in itself, adapted to the needs of the patient, and perfectly cooked; then serve it in the most attractive manner at your command.

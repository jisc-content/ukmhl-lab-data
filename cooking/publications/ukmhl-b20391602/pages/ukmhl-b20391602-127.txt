RECIPES 113 to health. It dissolves easily when tea is either steeped for a length of time, or boiled. The important point, therefore, is not to make tea more than a few minutes before it is to be drunk, and not to boil it. The principal kinds of tea in common use are Oolong, Japan, English Breakfast, Imperial, Gun- powder, and Young Hyson. Gunpowder, Japan, Young Hyson, and Imperial are green teas; the others are black. To Prepare Tea. I Teaspoon of tea. 1 Cup of boiling water. Fill a cup with boiling water, and let it stand a minute, or until the cup is heated through. Then empty it, put the quantity of tea into a tea-ball, place it in the hot cup, and pour on the boiling water slowly until it is full, leaving the tea-ball in for three minutes. This will give you a delicious and fragrant drink. If there is not a tea-ball at hand, use a small strainer, holding it so that the tea is under water for the required time. The same principle is to be followed in making a pot of tea, except that the time of steeping should be somewhat longer. Scald the pot, which should be either of silver, granite-ware, or earthenware, not tin. Put into it the tea, in the proportions indicated for a cup of water (one half pint), and let it infuse for five minutes, but by no means allow it to boil, for boil- ing dissipates the aroma, and extracts the tannin, which is the injurious principle. Serve it in hot tea- cups with loaf-sugar and cold cream or milk. The amount of tea required for a cup of water varies with the quality of the tea, the finer kinds requiring less than the cheaper grades.

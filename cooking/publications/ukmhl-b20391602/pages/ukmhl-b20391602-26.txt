EXPLANATORY LE3SONS 12 to a gas, but chemically there is no difference between the one and the other. Steam, water, and ice are forms of the same sub- stance, the difference being physical, not chemical, and caused by a difference in temperature. Lead melted so that it will run, and the solid lead of a bullet, are the same thing. These illustrate physical changes. Definition, When substances are brought together in such a way that their characteristic qualities re- main the same, the change is called physical. It is less close and intimate than a chemical change. The trans- ition from one state into another is also frequently only a physical change, as is seen in the transforma- tion of water into steam, water into ice, etc. ELEMENTS One feature of the work of the chemist is to sepa- rate compound bodies into their simple constituents. These constituents he also endeavors to dissociate; and if this cannot be done by any means known to him, then the thing must be regarded as a simple substance. Such simple bodies are called elements. Definition. An element then may be defined as a simple substance, which cannot by any known pro- cess be transformed into anything else; that is, no matter how it is treated, it still remains chemically what it was before. Gold, silver, copper, iron, plati- num, carbon, phosphorus, calcium, oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, and chlorin are examples of elements. Once it was believed that there were but four elements in the world â€” earth, air, fire, and water. Then it was learned that these were not elements at all in the chemical sense in which we use the term to-day. At present sixty-eight bodies are admitted to be simple primary substances. Some of these may in the future

RECIPES 247 in which the cake is to be baked, so that the outside shall not taste of fat. Many an otherwise nice cake has been spoiled by oiling the pan in which it was baked with dirty or rancid grease. Use a very little sweet butter or olive-oil.

First the butter and sugar are creamed together, then the yolks of the eggs are beaten and added, with the milk, to the butter and sugar; then the flour, into which the cream of tartar and soda have been well mixed by sifting them together several times, is put in; and last, the beaten whites of the eggs. Care in Baking.

For sponge cake made without raising material, such as the old-fashioned kind, in which only eggs, sugar, and flour are used, a slow oven is necessary. For butter cakes a temperature somewhere between 350° and 380° will not fail.

One is obliged to exercise a new judgment every time cake is made. Even thermome- ters are only a partial help, for if an oven has a tem- perature of 300° Fahr. at a certain time, there is no means of being sure what the temperature will be half

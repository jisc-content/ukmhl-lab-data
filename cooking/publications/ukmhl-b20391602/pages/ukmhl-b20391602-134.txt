120 JELLIES (prom gelatine) Gelatin is always of animal origin. The gelatinous substance obtained from apples, grapes, cranberries, aud other fruits is not gelatin; it is a different ma- terial, derived by the action of heat from pectose, a substance which occurs in plants and is closely asso- ciated with cellulose. Unprepared gelatin is some- times distinguished in writing from the gelatine of commerce by the difference of an e in spelling. Gelatin enters into the composition of all, or nearly all, the tissues of the body. The- walls of the micro- scopic cells of flesh are composed of it. It is found also in cartilage, tendons, connective tissue, bone, and in the larynx and joints. Spiders' webs and the thread of silkworms are gelatin in a liquid state, which so- lidifies upon exposure to the air. Another kind of gelatin forms the framework of insects, such as the locusts on which John the Baptist fed. It also forms the true skeleton of lobsters, crabs, and shrimps. The edible birds' nests of the Chinese are a delicate kind of gelatin more digestible than some other kinds, for it is made from the saliva of a swallow, and prob- ably contains pepsin. (M. Williams.) The part which gelatin plays as a food is not well understood. Many experiments have recently been made by scientists on dogs and other animals, to test the value of gelatin in this respect. From these ex- periments the following conclusions have been drawn:

EXPLANATORY LESSONS 49 190 may be relied upon. Milk treated by the last or "fractional" method of sterilization, as it is called, should keep indefinitely, provided of course the cot- ton is not disturbed. Cotton-wool or cotton batting in thick masses acts as a strainer for bacteria, and although air will enter, organisms will not. All persons who buy milk, or in any way control milk-supplies, should consider themselves in duty bound to (1) ascertain by personal investigation the condition in which the cows are kept. If there is any suspicion that they are diseased, a veterinary surgeon should be consulted to decide the case. If they are healthy and well fed, they cannot fail to give good milk, and nothing more is to be done except to see that it is transported in perfectly cleansed and scalded vessels. (2) If it is impossible to obtain milk directly from the producer, and one is obliged to buy that from unknown sources, it should be sterilized the mo- ment it enters the house. There is no other means of being sure that it will not be a bearer of disease. Not all such milk contains disease-producing organisms, but it all may contain them, and is therefore not above suspicion until they have been deprived of life. DIGESTION Definition. Digestion is the breaking up, changing, and liquefying of the food in the various chambers of the alimentary caual designed for that purpose. The mechanical breaking up is done principally by the teeth in the mouth, the chemical changes and liquefy- ing by the various digestive fluids.1 i It is supposed, but I think not yet demonstrated, that bacteria are among the transforming agents of our food, in the alimentary canal. Organisms iu the saliva have been isolated and i'ouud to produce sub- stauces which will partially digest starch.

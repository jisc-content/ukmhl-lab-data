The actual practical knowledge of how a certain number of dishes should be made has, of course, its value; but it is not the only consideration which should enter into the teaching of cookery. One of the most important points in all such work is the rec- ognition in certain cases of the necessity for particu- lar dishes, and the reasons for, and the value of, their ingredients.

It requires the greatest wisdom and good judgment on the part of physician and nurse to restore a patient to health without a lingering con- valescence. There is no doubt that the period of convalescence may be much shortened by the wise ad- ministration of food, and that the subsequent health of the patient may be either made or marred by the action of the nurse in this respect.

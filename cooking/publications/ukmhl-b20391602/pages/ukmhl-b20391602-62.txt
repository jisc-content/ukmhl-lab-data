EXPLANATORY LESSONS 48 for a longer time to a lower temperature than that of boiling. To Sterilize Milk for Immediate Use. (1) Pour the milk into a granite-ware saucepan or a double boiler, raise the temperature to 190° Fahr., and keep it at that point for one hour. (2) As soon as done put it immediately into a pitcher, or other vessel, which has been thoroughly washed, and boiled in a bath of water, and cool quickly by placing in a pan of cold or iced water. A chemist's thermometer, for testing the tem- perature, may be bought at any pharmacy for a small sum, but if there *is not one at hand, heat the milk until a scum forms over the top, and then keep it as nearly as possible at that temperature for one hour. Do not let it boil. To Sterilize Milk which is not for Immediate Use. Put the milk into flasks or bottles with narrow mouths; plug them with a long stopper of cotton-wooL place the flasks in a wire frame to support them, in a kettle of cold water, heat gradually to 190° Fahr., and keep it at that temperature for one hour. Repeat this the second day, for although all organisms were prob- ably destroyed during the first process, spores which may have escaped will have developed into bacteria. These will be killed by the second heating. Repeat again on the third day to destroy any life that may have escaped the first two. Spores or resting-cells are the germinal cells from which new bacteria develop, and are capable of surviv- ing a much higher temperature than the bacteria themselves, as well as desiccation and severe cold.1 Some writers give a lower temperature than 190° Fahr. as safe for sterilization with one hour's exposure, but l Spores may be further described as resistant forms vrhich some organisms assume in times of danger, or lnclt of nourishment for the purposo of preserving their lives. Not all organisms form spores.

RECIPES 240 STICKS 1 Cup of scalded milk. Â£ Teaspoon of salt. 1 Tablespoon of sugar. 2 Tablespoons of butter. \ Cake of compressed yeast, or \ Cup of liquid yeast. White of one egg. Flour enough to make a slightly soft dough. Dissolve the salt and sugar, and soften the butter in the hot milk, which must be measured after heating. When it is cooled to lukewai-mness, put in the yeast (which, if compressed, should be softened in a little cold water), the beaten white of the egg, and flour enough to make a dough slightly softer than that for ordinary bread. Let it rise overnight, or until light. Then cut it into small pieces, shape the pieces into balls, and roll and stretch them into tiny slender sticks, from ten to twelve inches long, about hah0 an inch thick in the middle, and tapering toward each end. Place them, two inches apart, in shallow, buttered pans, and put them in a warm place for an hour to rise; then bake them in a moderate oven fifteen or twenty minutes, or until they are a golden brown. Sticks are good at any time; they are especially nice served with soup, or for lunch, with cocoa or tea. This dough may also be made into tiny loaves for tea-rolls. RUSK 1 Tablespoon of sugar. \ Teaspoon of salt.

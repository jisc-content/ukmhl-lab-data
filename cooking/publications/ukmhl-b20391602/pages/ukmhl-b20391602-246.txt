232 BREAD The two most practicable methods of making bread are with yeast, and with cream of tartar and bicar- bonate of soda. Yeast is a micro-organism—an exceedingly mi- nute form of plant life—which by its growth pro- duces carbonic acid and alcohol. When this growth takes place in a mass of flour dough, the carbonic acid generated, in its effort to escape, puffs it up, but, owing to the viscous nature of the gluten, it is en- tangled and held within. Each little bubble of gas occupies a certain space. When the bread is baked, the walls around these spaces harden in the heat, and thus we get the porous loaf. Barley, rye, and some other grains would be very useful for bread if it were not that they lack suffi- cient gluten to entangle enough carbonic acid to render bread made from them light. Good bread cannot be made without good flour. There are two kinds usually to be found in market, namely bread flour, and pastry flour. The former is prepared in such a w&y that it contains more gluten than the latter. In making Pastry, or St. Louis flour, as it is sometimes called, the grain is crushed in such a manner that the starch, being most easily broken, becomes finer than the gluten, and in the pi*ocess of bolting some of the latter is lost. For pastry and cake this kind is best. Lacking gluten, bread made

EXPLANATORY LESSONS 24 be entirely gotten rid of by allowing them to develop and then destroying by a second boiling; but for all practical purposes, and under ordinary circum- stances, water is rendered safe for use by boiling it once.1 Should the water be very bad, boil it in a jar plugged with cotton for half an hour three days in succession, keeping it meanwhile in a temperature of 70° or 80° Fahr., so that any spores of organisms which may be in it will have an opportunity to get into such a state of existence that they will be capa- ble of being killed by the next boiling. The third treatment is for the purpose of making sure of any that may have escaped the first and second. PROTEIN The second of the food principles, protein, is a complex and very important constituent of our food. The protein compounds differ from all others as to chemical composition by the presence of nitrogen ; they contain carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, and nitrogen, while the fats and carbohydrates are composed prin- cipally of carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen, but no ni- trogen. The so-called extractives or flavoring proper- ties of meats are nitrogenous, and are consequently classed with the protein compounds.2 The body of an average person contains about eighteen per cent, of protein. The proteins of va- rious kinds furnish nutriment for blood and muscle, hence the term " muscle-formers," which is sometimes given them. They also furnish material for tendons and other nitrogenous tissues. When these are worn out by use, it is protein which repairs the waste. lAs a general thing water does not contain organisms that form spores. 2 Atwater.

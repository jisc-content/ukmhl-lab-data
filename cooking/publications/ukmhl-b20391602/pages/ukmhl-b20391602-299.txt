THE FEEDING OF CHILDREN 285 it. That alone is sufficient reason why cow's milk should be freed from them.1 Again, most bottle-fed children do well during the cold weather of autumn and winter; in summer the mortality is very great among them, especially in the poorer districts of large cities. It is well known that the chances for life with children nourished by mother's milk are greater than with those artificially fed. Why should this be 1 There is no doubt that it is owing to the presence in cow's milk of extraneous substances, the products of bacterial growth—prod- ucts which are often absolute poisons; and it is highly probable that cholera infantum, in a vast ma- jority of cases, may be traced to the action of such poisons. Under favorable conditions of temperature, such as prevail in the warm months of summer and early autumn, micro-organisms grow with almost incom- prehensible rapidity in any substance which is suita- ble food for them. Milk is such a substance; and, as bacteria multiply with wonderful rapidity, millions forming in a few hours in every thimbleful,2 it is perfectly evident that they must produce something. This something may or may not be of a harmful na- ture, depending upon what species of organism pro- duces it. I have no evidence at hand to show what is the nature of the product of any one organism which finds a home in milk; but there are instances on record where the nature of the product of certain bac- teria is known: for example, the diphtheria bacillus. This little rod, growing upon the outside of the ton- 1 It is worthy of notice, in this connection, that children have been known to be made ill by drinking water which has stood for a length of time—such water containing great numbers of bacteria, but none of the so-called disease-producing organisms. The same water, when boiled, produced no ill effects. 2 Stated by Sedgwick.

THE FEEDING OF CHILDREN 298 From the Tenth to the Twelfth Month 6 Tablespoons of cow's milk. 3 Tablespoons of water. 1Â£ Tablespoons of cream. 1 or 2 Tablespoons of Mellin's food. 1 Teaspoon of milk-sugar.1 Melliris Food with Condensed Milk. Although, as has been previously stated, condensed milk is not a proper food for children, there are times when it may be necessary to use it: for instance, in traveling, or when the daily supply of milk for any reason fails. The usual mixture of condensed milk given to ba- bies is one part of milk to twelve parts of water, the analysis2 of which shows the fat and casein to be in too small proportions. If more condensed milk be added, the sugar will be increased too much; but by increasing the water, and using Mellin's food and cream, a very good mixture may be obtained. The following is recommended: 1 Teaspoon condensed milk. 1 Tablespoon of Mellin's food. 8 Tablespoons of water (1 cup). 1 Teaspoon of cream. Boil the water, then add the condensed milk, Mel- lin's food, and cream in the order in which they are mentioned, stirring until all is dissolved. 1 Milk-sugar may be obtained without difficulty, and always, at a pharmacy. It is better for infants than cane-sugar, because it is a little easier of digestion. 2 Water 92.C096 Fat 1.00% Casein 8496 Sugar 5.4096 Ash 10% Dr. Meigs.

THE FEEDING OF CHILDREN 284 a condition that it can be assimilated by the infant; barley-water is valuable for its potash salts, in which cow's milk is deficient, and which the growing babe needs; veal broth is rich in lime; and lime-water neutralizes the acid of the gastric juice, so that milk is not acted upon so strongly, and consequently forms into a lighter curd. The second method is that of partial predigestion, and is accomplished by the use of peptonizing agents, among which Fairchild's peptogenic milk-po'wder is good (directions for its use will be given later). On account of the expense of these preparations it is not probable that they will come into general use, except in cases of sickness. It is therefore evident that dependence must be placed almost entirely upon attenuants to render the casein of cow's milk more easily digestible. Probably for this Mellin's food is as good, if not better, than auy other of the recommended preparations. It is not injurious, is nutritious in itself, and is a good diluting agent, causing milk to form into looser curds thau it would otherwise do, and it contains sufficient sugar to require no further addition of this substance. Now arises the question whether milk shall be sterilized for infants' feeding. The weight of evi- dence seems to be as follows: if it is possible to see the conditions under which the cows live, and to know that they are unquestionably good, that the animals are in perfect health, that the milk is drawn from cleansed udders into cleansed vessels by clean hands, kept in a cool place, and used fresh, then it is prob- ably wise not to sterilize it. All milk otherwise obtained should be made sterile before using, and as soon as possible after milking. Looking to the standard—human milk—there are no organisms in

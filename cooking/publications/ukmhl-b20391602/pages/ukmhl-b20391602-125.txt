From Prof. Mott's Chart on the Composition, Digestibility, and Nutritive Value of Food. Two of the most important points suggested by a study of tea are the few adulterations and the great dif- ference between different varieties, comparing weight and bulk. Some kinds of very cheap tea are adulter- ated with sage and raspberry leaves, and leaves of other plants dried to simulate tea, and often flavored with essences to give an agreeable taste, but a vast amount of the tea which is sold is pure. Adulterations with chemicals are now rare, on account of the exten- sive cultivation of tea and the large quantities sold. Teas vary greatly in weight,— that is, a given bulk of one tea weighs very differently from the same bulk of another. This is especially marked in the com- parison of Oolong and Gunpowder. Below are given the weights of a moderate-sized caddy-spoon of each of these teas. ™«o™.

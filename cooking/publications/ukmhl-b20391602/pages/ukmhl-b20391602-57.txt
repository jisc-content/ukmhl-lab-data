EXPLANATORY LESSONS 43 and micro-organisms. In a climate where artificial warmth is necessary a part of the year, it is difficult to warm and ventilate a room at the same time, with- out causing unpleasant drafts ; but with some know- ledge of the necessity of ventilation, and of the prop- erties of ah', one may in some measure work out a scheme of ventilation adapted to the circumstances in which he finds himself. There are always the doors and windows, which may be thrown wide open at intervals, and in many houses there are fireplaces. If a window be opened at the bottom at one side of a room, and another be opened at the top on an opposite side, a current of air will be established from the first window, passing through the room and out at the second. This plan will do very well in warm weather when the tempera- ture outside is about the same as that of the room, but it would be impracticable in cold weather. Then we may resort to the very simple plan of placing a board about eight or ten inches wide across the win- dow at the bottom and inside of the sash. Then when the lower half of the window is raised, a space is left between the upper and lower sashes, through which the air passes freely as it enters, and, being sent into the room in an upward direction, causes no draft. The board is for the purpose of closing the window below, and should fit quite close to the sash. Fireplaces are good, though not perfect, ventila- tors. Then there are the preventive measures, such as burning the gas or lamp low at night, avoiding oil- and gas-stoves, etc.; the latter are the worst possible means of heating rooms, for not only do they draw oxygen for burning from the air, but they give out the pollut- ing carbonic acid and other products of combustion, which in a coal- or wood-stove go up the chimney. A well-ventilated room should have an inflow of

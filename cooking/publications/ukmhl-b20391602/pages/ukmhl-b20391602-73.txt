59 EXPLANATORY LESSONS The Extractives, usually classed with the protein compounds, such as meat extract, beef tea, etc., are not generally regarded as direct nutrients, but, like tea and coffee, are valuable as accessory foods, lend- ing savor to other foods and aiding their digestion by pleasantly exciting the flow of the digestive fluids. They also act as brain and nerve stimulants, and per- haps also in some slight degree as nutrients. The principal proteins or nitrogenous substances are albumen in various forms, casein both animal and vegetable, Hood fibrin, muscle fibrin, and globulin. All are very much alike, and probably can replace one another in nutrition. Modern chemists agree that nitrogen is a necessary element in the various chemical and physiological actions which take place in the body to produce heat, muscular energy, and the other powers. Every structure in the body in which any form of energy is manifested is nitrogenous. The nerves, muscles, glands, and the floating cells1 in the various liquids are nitrogenous. That nitrogen is necessary to the different processes of the system, is shown by the fact that if it be cut off, these processes languish. This may not occur immediately, for the body always has a store of nitrogen laid by for emergencies which will be consumed first, but it will occur as soon as these have been consumed. The energy of the body is measured by its consumption of oxygen. Motion and heat may be owing to the oxidation of fat, or of starch, or of nitrogenous substances; but whatever the source, the direction is given by the nitrogenous structureâ€”in other words, nitrogen is necessary to all energy generated in the body. Protein matter nourishes the organic framework, takes part in the generation of energy, and may be i Hemoglobin, the red coloring matter of the blood, contains albumen.

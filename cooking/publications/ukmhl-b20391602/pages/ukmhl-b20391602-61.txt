EXPLANATORY LESSONS 47 certain amount of which causes what is known as " souring." Milk from perfectly healthy and perfectly kept cows is neutral, leaving' both red and blue litmus- paper unchanged; but as a general thing milk is slightly acid, even when transported directly from the producer to the consumer and handled by fairly clean workmen in fairly clean vessels. Such milk t two or three hours old when examined microscopic- ally is found to contain millions of organisms. Milk is one of the best of foods for bacteria, many of the ordinary forms growing in it with exceeding rapidity under favorable conditions of temperature. Now it has been found that such milk, although it may not contain the germs of any certain disease, sometimes causes in young children, and the sick, very serious digestive disturbances, and may thus become indi- rectly the cause of fatal maladies.1 All milk, unless it is positively known to be given by healthy, well-nourished animals, and kept in thor- oughly cleaned vessels free from contamination, should be sterilized before using. Often the organisms found in milk are of disease-giving nature. In Europe and America many cases of typhoid fever, scarlatina, and diphtheria have been traced to the milk-supply. In fact milk and water are two of the most fruitful food sources of disease. It therefore immediately becomes apparent that, unless these two liquids are above sus- picion, they should be sterilized before using. Boiling water for half an hour will render it sterile, but milk would be injured by evaporation and other changes produced in its constituents by such long exposure to so high a degree of heat. A better method, and one which should be adopted by all who understand some- thing of the nature of bacteria, is to expose the milk i See article on the Feeding of CMLdren.

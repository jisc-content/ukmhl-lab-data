RECIPES 104 To Use. Pour one third of a cup into a tumbler, add two tablespoons of cream, and fill the tumbler with soda-water from a siphon. This makes a de- licious and cooling drink. Oranges, raspberries, currants, or any other juicy fruit may be used for syrup, which is very palatable when made from fresh uncooked fruits. These syrups are useful not only for drinks, but for flavoring ice- creams and pudding sauces. COFFEE SYRUP Make some strong coffee with two tablespopns of the ground berry (Mocha and Java mixed), a little white of egg, and one cup of boiling water. Simmer together one cup of sugar and one third of a cup of water for five minutes, then add to it one half of a cup of the coffee. Strain and bottle it for use. This is delicious with soda-water and cream. VANILLA SYRUP Make a sugar syrup by boiling together one cup of sugar and one half of a cup of water for five minutes. Add to it two or three tablespoons of vanilla extract. It is to be used, like coffee syrup, with soda-water and sweet cream. OTHER SYRUPS A variety of syrups may be made, besides those men- tioned, by using a sugar syrup like that in the above recipe, and flavoring it with cinnamon, lemon, al- mond, rose-water, chocolate, etc. All of the cooked syrups will keep indefinitely.

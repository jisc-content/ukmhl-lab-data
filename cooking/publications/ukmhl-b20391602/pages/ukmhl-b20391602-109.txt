95 DRINKS EGG-NOG Break into a bowl one egg, add to it a saltspoon of salt and two teaspoons of sugar; beat it until it is light; then add one cup of cool milk — that is, milk which has not been excessively chilled (for it is not well to use that which is ice-cold)—and one or two tablespoons of French brandy; mix and strain it into a tall slender glass, and serve at once. Egg-nog ought to be used very soon after it is made, for both the egg and the milk lose some of their freshness by exposure to the air. MILK-PUNCH 1 Cup of milk. 2 Tablespoons of brandy. 1 Teaspoon of sugar. A little grated nutmeg. Sweeten the milk with the sugar, stir into it the brandy, and mix thoroughly by pouring from one glass to another. Then grate a bit of nutmeg over the top. Milk-punch is conveniently made with two tin cups; the mouth of one should be smaller than the mouth of the other, so that the one will fit into the other.

279 SERVING ridge in a hot saucer, and the coffee, together. When the fruit and porridge are finished, offer the potato, wrapped in a doily to keep it warm, the steak in a hot covered silver dish, and the toast on an individ- ual bread-plate. Or all may be served together when for any reason it seems best to do so: for instance, if the tray has to be carried a long distance, or up many flights of stairs. The above arrangement is simply beginning with the things which require the longest time, and then taking each in such order that all shall be finished at the same moment. By understanding the length of time required for each dish, there need be no hurrying, nor will any- thing be cooked too soon. Dinner should be planned in the same way, and also supper. Even when there is not much cooking to be done the same idea prevailsâ€”that is, to begin with whatever requires the longest time, and to do last those dishes which spoil by standing; in other words, to be systematic, (1) because your meal is in better condition when so done, and (2) because it is easier for yourself. There then will be neither hurry nor worry, and work which ends with a satisfactory result is always a pleasure.

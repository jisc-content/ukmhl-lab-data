51 EXPLANATORY LESSONS digestive fluids when food is taken is different from what it is when the organs are at rest. For instance, the gastric juice which flows in abundance under the stimulus of food, is not like the fluid secreted when the stomach is collapsed and empty. Pancreatic Juice. Pancreatic juice is the digestive juice of the pancreas, and is poured into the small in- testine a short distance below the pyloric opening. Its reaction is alkaline. Its flow is entirely suspended during the intervals of digestion. Bile. Bile, the fourth in order of the digestive liquids, is the secretion of the largest gland of the bodyâ€”the liver. It is poured into the small intestine by a duct which empties side by side with the duct from the pancreas. The flow of bile is constant, but is greatest dui'ing digestion. Intestinal Juice. Intestinal juice has been to physi- ologists a difficult subject of study. It is mingled with the salivary and gastric juices at the times of di- gestion, when it is most desirable to notice its action. Nearly all authorities agree that it is alkaline, and that its function is to complete the digestion of sub- stances which may reach it in an undigested condition. Mucus of Large Intestine. The mucus secreted by the large intestine is for lubricating only. Digestion in Different Parts of the Alimentary Tract. Different substances in food are digested in different portions of the alimentary canal, and by different means. Let us begin in the mouth. Taking the classes of foods, starch, one of the carbohydrates, is the one most affected by the ptyalin, or animal dias- tase, of the saliva. So energetic is the action of ptyalin on starch that 1 part is sufficient to change 1000 parts. Starch is not acted upon by the gastric juice of the stomach at all; however, the continued action of the saliva is not entirely interrupted in the

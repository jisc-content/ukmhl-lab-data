RECIPES 105 GRAPE JUICE Grape juice mixed with cold water or with soda-water makes a pleasant and invigorating drink for a sick per- son. The best grapes for the purpose are the blue varie- ties, such as Isabellas, Concords, or Black Hamburgs. To Make a Bottle of Juice. Pick over (and wash if they need it) one quart of grapes. Remove them from the stems, and put them into a double boiler with just enough cold water to cover them. Heat them slowly until the juice oozes out and the fruit becomes soft, which will take two or three hours. Then turn the fruit into a jelly-bag made like a long pointed pocket, draw the string at the top and hang it to drain. Do not squeeze or press the bag, and use only the juice which drips out, which will practically be all that the grapes contain. To this add one fourth of the quantity of sugar—that is, if there is a quart of juice, put in one cup of sugar—and heat it until it is quite hot, or to a temperature of 210° Fahr., and keep it at that temperature for one hour, but do not let it boil. Then pour it into thoroughly cleaned and scalded hot bottles,—in other words, those which are sterile. Seal the bottles with wax, and set them away in a cool place. To Use. Mix equal quantities of juice and cold water, and serve at once. FLAXSEED TEA WITH LEMON 1 Tablespoon of flaxseed. 1 Pint of water. 1 Tablespoon of sugar. 1 Tablespoon of lemon-juice.

RECIPES 201 Cook the sugar, chocolate, and cream (sweet cream or, if that cannot be had, rich milk) together in a doable boiler until the chocolate is perfectly dis- solved. It will require occasional stirring, and should be, when done, entirely free from specks or flakes of chocolate. Then stir in, pouring slowly, the well- beaten whites of the eggs while the cream is still on the stove. Cook for three minutes, or until the albu- men is coagulated, but not hardened. It should look creamy and smooth, not curdled. Turn into a pud- ding-dish and cool. TAPIOCA CREAM Â£ Cup of granulated tapioca. J Cup of cold water. 1 Pint of milk. 3 Tablespoons of sugar. 1 Saltspoon of salt. 2 Eggs. After the tapioca is picked over and washed, put it into a double boiler with the cold water, and let it stand until the water is absorbed. Then pour in the pint of milk, and cook until each grain is transparent and soft. It will take an hour. At this point, beat the eggs, sugar, and salt together until very light, and pour them slowly into the hot pudding, at the same time stirring rapidly, so that the two will be perfectly mixed. After the egg is in, continue to stir for about three minutes, or long enough to cook the egg as it is done in soft custard. The pudding should have the appearance of cream, as the name indicates, with flecks of tapioca all through it. Turn it into a china dish. Serve either hot or cold.

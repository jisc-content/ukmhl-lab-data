RECIPES [14 Water for tea should be fresh, and soft water — that is, water which is free from lime—is preferable; by- taking one-hal f teaspoon of tea and a cup of water as the unit, any amount may be made; for instance, for a pot of tea for five or six persons, three teaspoons of tea and a quart and a half (6 cups) of water will be required. The time of exposure to the heat is, of course, not multiphed, the same number of minutes being enough for a greater or a lesser amount. In connection with the study of tea, it is a very interesting fact that most authorities agree as to the time of steeping. There seems to be the unanimous opinion that it should not exceed fifteen minutes. Five minutes is the usual time given for the average kinds of tea, but for the fine, pure teas from eight to ten is a wise rule to follow. COFFEE Coffee is a product of the East, where it has been used since very ancient times. It grows on trees, the fruit in clusters which singly look somewhat like cherries, each containing two beans. Unroasted coffee- beans are tough, and a drink made from them is bit- ter, acrid, and very unpleasant. Coffee was brought, to western Europe in the seventeenth century, where it seems to have immediately become a popular drink. When coffee-houses were first opened in England, they were opposed by the liquor-dealers, who claimed that their trade would be spoiled. Its introduction was also bitterly opposed by others, and even denounced from the pulpit. It was regarded somewhat in the light of a dangerous Eastern drug. From western Europe it was brought to America, and at the present time is the most extensively used food beverage in the world.

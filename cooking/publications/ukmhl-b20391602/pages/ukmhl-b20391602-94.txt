80 KECEPES SCOTCH BEEF BROTH Put into a granite stew-pan a pint of prepared beef broth,â€”that is, broth which has been strained, cleared of fat, and seasoned. Add to it one table- spoon of rolled oats, or of ordinary oatmeal, and sim- mer it gently until the oatmeal is soft and jelly-like. The time required will be about two hours. Then strain it, and serve very hot. This makes a good dish for an invalid for whom oatmeal has not been forbid- den. If the broth is reduced by the boiling, add enough water to restore the pint. CHICKEN BROTH Chicken broth should be made with fowl, not with young chicken ; a good one weighing three pounds will make three pints of broth. To Prepare. Singe the chicken with a piece of blaz- ing newspaper to burn off the long hairs; remove all refuse or that which is not clear flesh, viz., pin-fea- thers, oil-bag, crop, lungs, kidneys, and, of course, the entrails if the fowl is not already drawn. If the pipes in the neck are not all drawn out with the crop, they may be easily taken away when the fowl is cut up. Scrub it well in cold water, and then disjoint and cut it into small pieces ; wash each piece thoroughly, re- taining the skin if it is clear and free from pin-fea- thers, otherwise removing it. Put the chicken into cold water and simmer it for two hours, then boil it for two hours. Finally strain it and remove the fat. season it with salt and a bit of white pepper, and serve very hot in pretty china cups, with or without a lunch-cracker or a bit of dry toast.

EXPLANATORY LESSONS 65 true reserves is shown by the fact that they disappear during deprivation of food. The glycogen, or liver- supply, disappears first; then the fat (Martin). The heat of the body can be maintained on these sub- stances, and a certain amount of work done, although no food except water be taken. The principal function of the liver is to form gly- cogen to be stored away. It constantly manufactures it, and as constantly loses it to the circulation. Gly- cogen is allied to starch, having the same elementary composition (C0H10O5), but diffei-ing in other ways. Its quantity is greatest about two hours after a full meal; then it gradually falls, but increases again when food is again taken. Its amount also varies with the hind of food eaten: fats and proteids by themselves give little, but starch and sugars give much, for it is found in greatest quantity when these form a part of the diet. Inorganic Matter and Vegetable Acids. "Water and other inorganic matter, as the salts of different kinds, and vegetable acids, as vinegar and lemon-juice, can scarcely be said to be digested. Water is absorbed, and salts are generally in solution in liquids and are absorbed with them. Water is found in all parts of the body, even in the very solid portions, as the bones and the enamel of the teeth; it also constitutes a large proportion of its semisolids and fluids, some of which are nearly all water, as the perspiration and the tears. Water usually is found combined with some of the salts, which seem to act as regulators of the amount which shall be incorporated into a tissue. Water is a necessary constituent of all tissues, giving them a proper consistency and elasticity. The power of re- sistance of the bones could not be maintained without it. It is also valuable as a food solvent, assisting in

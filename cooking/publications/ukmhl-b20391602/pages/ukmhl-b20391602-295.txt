THE FEEDING OF CHILDREN 281 Many kinds of food preparations have been made and tested. The result has been that, almost without ex- ception, authorities agree that milk from healthy, well-fed cows, properly prepared, is the most valuable substitute for human milk that is at present known.1 The following analyses give the comparison be- tween cow's mdk and human milk: Human Milk. Cow's Milk. Nitrogenous substances 2.35% 4.30%" Fat 3.40% 3.80% Sugar 4.85% 3.70% Salts 20% 60% Water 89.20% 87.60% 2 Cow's milk varies considerably in nutritive proper- ties, and for the growing infant who receives no other food it is extremely important that it be of the first quality. It should be tested in every possible way to enable one to form a correct estimate of its value, and unless unquestionably good should be rejected.3 When fresh from the cow, not more than two hours old, and of superior quality, it need not be sterilized, but should be put into perfectly cleansed and sterile vessels,4 and kept in an ice-box, or refrigerator, at a temperature of 50° to 60° Fahr.5 When obliged to buy the ordinary milk of com- merce, select if possible that which is put up in glass ■whereas it will hurt it seriously and perhaps induce life-long dyspepsia if food is introduced into the stomach while there yet remains in it that previously taken in an undigested, or partly digested, condition. The cry which a young mother thinks indicates hunger, and hopes to allay by feeding, is often only a dyspeptic pain, which is increased by the very means she takes to lessen it. 1 The milk of goats and asses is said to be more easily digested than cow's milk, but is procurable only in exceptional cases. 2 From TJffelmann's " Hygiene of the Child." 3 See chapter on Milk. * Vessels for holding milk may be made sterile by boiling them in water for fifteen minutes. Glass is best. 5 A low temperature retards the growth of micro-organisms.

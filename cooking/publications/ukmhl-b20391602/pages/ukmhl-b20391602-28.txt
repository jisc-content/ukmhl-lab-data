EXPLANATORY LESSONS 14 muscular strength for work (Prof. Atwater). The carbonic acid formed in the body is given out by the lungs and skin. Other Elements. There are many other elements about which it would be interesting to note some- thing, such as calcium and phosphorus (found abun- dantly in the bones), magnesium, sulphur, sodium, iron, etc. Samples of these may be obtained to show to pupils, and descriptions given and experiments made, at the discretion of the teacher. Of the four most abundant elements of the body and of food,— oxygen, carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen,— it is extremely im- portant that some study be made, and if the apparatus can be procured, that it be of an experimental nature rather than simply descriptive.1 AIR Air is made up principally of two elements, nitro- gen and oxygen. It also always contains vapor of water, carbonic acid, and argon. Its average com- position is as follows: Nitrogen 78.49% Oxygen 20.63% Aqueous Vapor 84% CarboDic Acid 04% Argon unestimated These are mixed together, not chemically united. Oxygen and nitrogen do unite chemically, but not in the proportions in which they exist in the air. Nitrous Oxid (N20), sometimes called "Laughing Gas," is one of the compounds of nitrogen and oxygen. EIRE Exp. with a Candle. Take a tallow candle, and by means of a lighted match raise its temperature sufficiently high to start an action between the carbon in the candle and the oxygen i Rrc Eliot, and Ptorer's " Chemistry," the revised edition, edited hy Nichols, :md the " Elementary Text-hook of Chemistry," by Mixter.

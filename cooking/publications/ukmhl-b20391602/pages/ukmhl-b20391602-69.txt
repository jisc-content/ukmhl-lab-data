EXPLANATORY LESSONS 55 force or power. Food, drink, and air are the materials furnished to it,â€” the things consumed; heat, muscular and intellectual energy, and other forms of power are the products. Food, during the various digestive processes, be- comes reduced to a liquid, and is then absorbed and conveyed, by different channels constructed for the purpose, into the blood, which contains, after being acted upon by the oxygen of the air in the lungs, all those substances which are required to maintain the various tissues, secretions, and, in fact, the life of the system. Some of the ways in which the different kinds of food nourish the body have been found out by chem- ists and physiologists from actual experiments on living animals, such as rabbits, dogs, pigs, sheep, goats, and horses, and also on man. Often a scien- tist becomes so enthusiastic in his search for know- ledge about a certain food that he gives his own. body for trial. Much valuable work has been done in this direction duriug the last decade by Voit, Pettenkofer, Moleschott, Ranke, Payen, and in this country by Atwater. No one can explain all the different intricate changes which a particle of food undergoes from the moment it enters the mouth until its final transfor- mation into tissue or some form of energy; but by comparing the income with the outgo, ideas may be gained of what goes on in the economy of the body, and of the proportion of nutrients used, and some of the intricate and complex chemical changes which the different food principles undergo in the various pro- cesses of digestion, assimilation, and use.1 Probably iThe body loses each day, in the performance of its ordinary and nsnal functions, about nine-pounds of matter (Martin); therefore, that amount of income of food, water, and air wiU be needed in every twi'iity-four hours.

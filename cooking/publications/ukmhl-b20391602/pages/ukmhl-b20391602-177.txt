RECIPES 163 Usually the first vegetable prescribed by the physi- cian for a sick person who is beginning to use solids, is a baked potato. A baked potato, however, may be no better than a boiled potato unless it is cooked in so high a temperature that the starch is affected. Boiled potatoes cannot be subjected to a higher temperature than 212° Fahr. Baked potatoes may be done in such a way that they are but little better than boiled—for instance, done in a slow oven. On the other hand, if they are put into a temperature of 380° or 400° Fahr., or a hot oven, they will be done in such a man- ner that the conversion of starch will in a degree take place, and they will be consequently both palatable and easily digested. Potatoes roasted in hot ashes or embers are deli- cious, and for the same reason. But it must not be understood that by cooking potatoes in a high tem- perature the starch which they contain is all changed into dextrine. This does not usually take place ex- cept in slight degree, but by the high temperature it is better prepared for this change in the processes of digestion. Probably what does take place is a sort of hydration of the starch, resulting in the complete swelling and final bursting of the granules, with pos- sibly an intermediate change between this and dex- trine. Just at the moment when potatoes are done they should be immediately taken from the fire and served at once. The potato is capable of being made into a variety of dishes, and when properly prepared has a delicate flavor which is very acceptable to most people. It is one of the most easily digested forms of starch-containing food. BOILED POTATOES For boiled potatoes, if they are to be served whole, select those of the same shape and size. Wash them

RECIPES 115 The kinds in common use in this country are Java and Mocha from the East, and the South American coffees Rio, Santos, and Maracaibo. The soil and method of cultivation influence the quality of coffee, as does also the age of the beans. The longer the beans are kept (uncrowned)- the finer the flavor. Coffee is adulterated with grains of different kinds, chicory, caramel, carrots and some other roots, and with pastes made to resemble the coffee-bean. The use of chicory is prohibited by law, unless the mixture be labeled "Mixture of coffee and chicory." Never- theless, its use is common, and in nearly all hotels and restaurants coffee is flavored with it. "The detection of the presence of chicory, caramel, and some sweet roots, as turnips, carrots, and parsnips, is quite easy. If a few grains of the suspected sam- ple are placed on the surface of water in a glass ves- sel, beaker, or tumbler, each particle of chicory, etc., will become surrounded by a yellow-broWn cloud which rapidly diffuses through the water until the whole becomes colored. Pure coffee under the same conditions gives no sensible color until after the lapse of about fifteen minutes. Caramel (burnt sugar) of course colors the water very deeply. Dandelion root gives a deeper color than coffee, but not as deep as chicory. The same is true of bread raspings. Beans and pease give much less color to the water than pure coffee. They can be readily detected by the microscope, as can roasted figs and dates or date- stones." (Mrs. Richards, in "Food Materials and Their Adulterations.") Coffee is said to owe its refreshing properties to (a) caffeine, (b) a volatile oil developed by heat, not con- tained in the unroasted bean, and to (c) astringent acids. Coffee diminishes the sensation of hunger, exhilar-

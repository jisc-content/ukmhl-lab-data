185 STEWS CHICKEN STEW 1 Cup of chicken meat. 1 Teaspoon of chopped onion. 2 Tablespoons of white turnip. 1 Saltspoon of curry-powder. J Teaspoon of salt. A little white pepper. 1 Tablespoon of rice. Left-over broiled chicken or the cuttings from a cold roast will do for this dish. Divide the meat into small pieces, excluding all skin, gristle, tendons, and bone. Boil the bones and scraps, in water enough to cover them, for an hour. Then strain the liquor, skim off the fat, and put into it the chicken, onion, turnip (which should be cut in small cubes), curry-powder, salt, pepper, and rice. Simmer all together for an hour. Serve. The vegetables and curry flavor the meat, and a most easily digested and palatable dish is the result. Potatoes may be substituted for the rice, and celery- salt, bay-leaves, or sweet marjoram for the curry. If herbs be used, tie them in a bag and drop it into the stew, of course removing it before carrying the dish to the table. The above rule will make enough stew for two persons. By multiplying each item in it, any amount may be made.

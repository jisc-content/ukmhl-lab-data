EXPLANATOEY LESSONS 25 Most of the valuable work upon the analysis of food has been done in Germany. From estimates made by chemists of that country it has been decided that the amount of protein in a diet should not fall below four ounces daily. This is to represent an allowance for a man of average weight doing an average amount of work, below which he cannot go without loss in health, in work, or in both. Although protein is the most ex- pensive of all food materials, one should endeavor to use at least four ounces each day. Meat, milk, eggs, cheese, fish of all kinds, but especially dried cod, wheat, beans, and oatmeal are all rich in this sub- stance. The protein compounds are divided into three classes: ALBUMINOIDS, GELATINOIDS, EXTRACTIVES. Albuminoids. The most perfect type of an albumi- noid is the white of egg. It is a viscous, glairy, thick fluid which occurs also in the flesh of meat as one of its juices, in fish, in milk, as well as in various other foods. It is soluble in cold water. Exp. Mix some white of egg in a tumbler with half a cup of cold water. As soon as the viscousness is destroyed it will be found to be completely dissolved. The few white flakes which appear are a globulin. It is insoluble in alcohol. Exp. Pour upon some white of egg double its bulb of alco- hol. It will coagulate into a somewhat hard opaque mass. Heat also has the power of coagulating albumen. Coagulation of Albumen by Heat. Put into a test-tube some white of egg, and place the tube in a dish of warm water. Heat the water gradually over a gas-flame or an alcohol-lamp. When the temperature reaches 134Â° Fahr. it will be seen that

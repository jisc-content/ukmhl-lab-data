161 POTATOES Next to wheat flour, potatoes are our most common form of starch food. The potato is a tuber, a native of America, and may be said to have been discovered to the civilized world by the Spaniards, who found it growing in Chili and Peru. Thence it was carried to Spain, and from there to other parts of Europe, some time in the sixteenth century. Potatoes were at first used as luxuries, but are now almost ranked among the necessities of life. The composition of potatoes (Letherby) is as follows: Water 75.00% Starch 18.80%" Nitrogenous matter 2.00% Sugar 3.00% Fat 20% Salts 1.00% i From this we see that starch is the principal nutri- ent, therefore potatoes in use for food should be associ- ated with nitrogenous substances, such as eggs, meat, fish, and milk. The potash salts which potatoes con- tain are very valuable. According to Letherby, an 1 Another analysis is that of Payen, the distinguished French chemist.

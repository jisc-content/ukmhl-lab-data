RECIPES 251 CARMINE FOR COLORING The following rule for making liquid carmine for coloring cake, ice-cream, blanc-mange, etc., will be found useful: 1 Ounce of No. 40 carmine. 3 Ounces of boiling water. 1 Ounce of ammonia. Bottle for use. It will keep indefinitely. WHITE CAKE 1 Tablespoon of butter. 1 Cup of sugar (powdered). J Cup of milk. 1£ Cups of pastry flour. £ Teaspoon of soda. 1 Teaspoon of cream of tartar. Whites of four eggs. ^ Teaspoon of almond extract, or 1 Teaspoon of rose-water. Proceed, as with all cake mixtures, by getting every- thing ready before beginning to mix any of the in- gredients, not forgetting the fire. Then cream the butter with the sugar, and add the milk to it slowly, so that the cream shall not break. Beat the whites of the eggs very stiff. Then to the butter, sugar, etc., add the flour, with which the cream of tartar and soda have been sifted at least four times, and the flavoring; last, fold in the whites of the eggs, and bake in a round loaf for an hour and a quarter or an hour and a half in a slow oven.

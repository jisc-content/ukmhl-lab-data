Bake it in shallow pans in a moderate oven forty minutes, or about that time. When the cake begins to shrink a little from the sides of the pan, there is no doubt that it is cooked enough. This recipe may be used for a variety of plain cakes. For Chocolate Cake. Melt and stir into the above mixture two ounces of Baker's chocolate, or two tea- spoons of cocoa wet in a little warm water. For Rose Cake. Color the feather cake mixture with six drops of carmine. LAYER CAKE Oil three layer cake pans, or pie-plates. Make the feather cake mixture, and divide it into three por- tions. Bake one white, color another pink with three or four drops of carmine, and the third brown with an ounce of melted chocolate. Bake in a hot oven for fifteen minutes. When cool, join the layers with White Mountain frosting, and frost the top of the last layer. Any of the fillings given under the head of "Cake Filling" may also be used. When chocolate is used in cake, it is not necessary to grate it or even to break it into small pieces. It contains a large proportion of fat which liquefies at a low temperature, consequently it is necessary only to heat it slowly to reduce it to the liquid state.

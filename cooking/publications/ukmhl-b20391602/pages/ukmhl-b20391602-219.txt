RECIPES 205 Put the milk on the stove to heat. Mix in a sauce- pan the corn-starch, sugar, and salt with the cold water, and when the milk has just begun to boil pour it in, slowly at first, stirring all the while. The corn- starch should become thick at once, when it may be poured into a clean double boiler and cooked thirty minutes. The time should be faithfully kept, as corn- starch is an unpalatable and indigestible substance un- less thoroughly cooked. See to it that the water in the under boiler actually boils during the thirty minutes. At the end of that time beat one egg very light, and stir it in, pouring slowly, so that it may be mixed all through the hot pudding and piiff it up. Then cook for one minute, turn it into a china pudding- dish, or into individual molds, and cool. Serve with cream. Corn-starch pudding should have a tender consis- tency and a sweet and wholesome taste. The diffi- culty with many is that they are not thoroughly cooked, and are too stiff and hard when cool. When you find this to be the case, lessen the amount of corn-starch used. The proportion in this recipe may always be relied upon, if the starch be good. Other similar puddings ma}'- be made by substitut- ing in the above recipe arrowroot, flour, or farina for the corn-starch.

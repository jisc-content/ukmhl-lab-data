63 EXPLANATORY LESSONS essentially the same in both cases, but in favor of the slightly coagulated. When the albumen is rendered hard, fine, and close in consistency by over-cooking, then it is less easy of digestion than when raw. Absorption. It is probable that the greater portion of the process of digestion of albumen takes place in the stomach. Fibrin. Fibrin is also digested in the stomach, and made into fibrin peptone. Casein. Liquid casein is immediately coagulated by gastric juice, the active agent being one of its fer- ments, rennin. Gelatin. Gelatin is quickly dissolved by gastric juice, and afterward no longer has the property of forming jelly on cooling. Gelatin is more rapidly disposed of than the tissue from which it is produced. Vegetable Protein. The digestion of the vegetable protein compounds, such as the gluten of wheat and the protein of the various grains, such as corn, oat- meal, etc., is undoubtedly carried on in the stomach, but they must be well softened and prepared by the action of heat and water, or they will not be digested anywhere; and often corn, beans, and grains of oat- meal are rejected entirely unchanged. Partially or imperfectly digested proteins are affected by pan- creatic juice. The function of the pancreatic juice is the most important of all of the digestive fluids since it emulsifies fats and digests both proteids and carbo- hydrates. To summarize : The digestion and absorption of nitrogenous compounds take place in both the stom- ach and the intestines. NUTRITION One of the important points to bring to the notice of pupils in the study of cookery is the phenomenon

38 EXPLANATORY LESSONS Sugar is a valuable nutrient, being very easily di- gested and absorbed. Cane-sugar is converted into glucose in the process of digestion, and after absorp- tion it is completely utilized in the body, furnishing heat and probably energy. Effects of Heat on Sugar. Sugar undergoes vari- ous changes, with different degrees of heat, by loss of the elements of water and dissociation. One of the most remarkable of these is seen in caramel sauce, which is a rich crimson-brown syrup generally sup- posed to contain foreign coloi-ing matter, but which does not. It is made by melting sugar without water, and heating it until the desired hue and thickness are reached. Nothing is added, but something is taken away; that is, oxygen and hydrogen are driven out, with the result of change in both color and taste. In an article in ''The Century Magazine" (No- vember, 1891) Prof. Atwater touches upon the sub- ject of the production of artificial foods from the crude materials of the earth, and states, among other things, that a sugar resembling fruit-sugar has been made artificially by synthesis, by Prof. Fischer of Wiirzburg, Germany. AIR Air is a gaseous elastic body which envelops the earth on every side, extending possibly two hundred miles from its surface, and becoming less and less dense as the distance from the earth increases. When pure it is tasteless and odorless. We really live at the bottom of an atmospheric ocean, and are pressed upon by its weight. At the sea-level the pressure upon every square inch of surface is equal to fifteen pounds. Atmospheric Pressure Variable. Atmospheric pres-

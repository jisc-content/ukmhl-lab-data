EXPLANATORY LESSONS 16 up by plants and used by them for food. In the course of ages these plants may become coal, be con- sumed in combustion, and, passing into the air, thus complete the cycle of change. Fuel and Kindlings. The common fuels are coal, coke, wood, gas, coal-oil, and peat. For kindling, newspaper is good because, being made of straw and wood-pulp, it burns easily, and also because printers' ink contains turpentine, which is highly inflammable. COMPOSITION OF THE BODY Before entering upon the study of foods it is well to consider the composition of the human body, that some idea of its chemical nature may be gained. In the United States National Museum at Washington may be found some interesting information on this subject. From there much that is contained in the next two pages is taken. A complete analysis of the human body has never been made, but different organs have been examined, and chemists have weighed and analyzed portions of them, and from such data of this nature as could be obtained, estimates of the probable composition of the body have been calculated. Thirteen elements united into their compounds, of which there are more than one hundred, form it. The following table gives the average composition of a man weighing 148 pounds.

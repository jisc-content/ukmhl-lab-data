239 RECIPES Eight hours at 70째 Fahr. is a good rule to keep in mind. During the time of raising the dough should double itself in bulk. If this does not happen, or it does not appear to have risen at all, either the yeast was not good, or the temperature was too low. When the bread has risen sufficiently, cut it down, and knead it for five minutes on a bread-board, to distribute the gas and break the large bubbles, so that the bread may have an even grain; then shape it into a loaf, put it into an oiled baking-pan, and let it rise quickly in a warm place, until it again doubles itself. The amount of dough indicated in the rule will make one large loaf, or a medium-sized loaf and some bis- cuit. Multiply the ride by two if you want two loaves. Bake the bread in an oven which is hot at first, but gradually decreases in temperature, for an hour and a quarter. If you have an oven thermometer use it.1 MILK BEEAD 1 Pint of scalded milk. 1 Tablespoon of sugar. 1 Teaspoon of salt. i Cup of liquid yeast, or \ Cake of compressed yeast. Measure the milk after scalding, but otherwise pro- ceed exactly as in the making of water bread. 1 Oven thermometers may be obtained of Joseph Davis & Co., Fitz- roy Works, London, 8. E., England. 400째 Fahr. is a good temperature for the first fifteen minutes. Some writers give 380째, but the higher temperature is better, provided it can be gradually decreased; it should uot fall below 250째 until the loaf is done. Stoves with ther- mometers set in the oven doors, the index of which may be read from the outside, are in the market.

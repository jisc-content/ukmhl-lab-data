DISTRICT NURSING 304 Dusting should be done with a damp cloth, wiping up the dust, not brushing it into the air, from which it will settle upon some other object. When you have finished, wash the duster and hang it to dry. Never use a feather duster. With it one simply brushes the dust from one place only to have it settle in another. BILLS OF FARE Mrs. Abel says, in her chapter headed " Bills of Fare ": " The following bills of fare are made out for a family of six persons, consisting of a workingman, two women, and three children between the ages of sis and fifteen. "The amount of food, and the proportion in which the great food principles are represented, approximate to that which is demanded by standard dietaries for such a family. . . . " To keep us in health and in working order, we ought to have a certain amount of what is best fur- nished by meat, eggs, milk, and other animal products, and we must also have fats, as well as what is given us in grains and vegetables." The following bills of fare are made up with this object in view: For a family of six; average price, seventy-eight cents per day, or thirteen cents per person. SATURDAY, MAY Breakfast. Dinner.

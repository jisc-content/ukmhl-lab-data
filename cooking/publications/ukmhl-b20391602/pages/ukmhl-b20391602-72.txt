58 EXPLANATORY LESSONS poses in the body, and are all necessary for perfect nutrition. Some of them closely resemble each other in composition, but are quite different in their physio- logical properties, and in the ends which they serve. For instance, starch (CoH1005) has almost the same chemical formula as sugar (C^H^On), and yet the one cannot replace the other to its entire exclusion. The Protein Compounds. In general it may be said that the carbohydrates are changed into fats, and are used for the production of force, and that the fats are stored in the body as fat and used as fuel. The protein compounds do all that can be done by the fats and carbohydrates, and in addition something more; that is, they form the basis of blood, muscle, sinew, skin, and bone. They are, therefore, the most important of all the food compounds. The terms " power-givers " and " energy-formers " are sometimes applied to them, because wherever power and energy are developed they are present, though not by any means the only substances involved in the evolution of energy. Probably the fats and carbohydrates give most of the material for heat and the various other forces of the body. In case of emergency, where these are deficient, the proteins are used; but protein alone forms the basis of muscle, tendons, skin, and other tissues. This the fats and carbohydrates can- not do (Atwater). The different tissues are known from chemical analysis to contain complex nitrogenous compounds. Now, since the body cannot construct these substances out of the simpler chemical com- pounds which come to it, it becomes perfectly evident that the diet must have a due proportion of them in order to maintain the strength of the body. We get most of our protein from the flesh of animals, and they in turn get it from plants, which construct it from the crude materials of earth and air.

EXPLANATORY LESSONS 02 be produced partly from nitrogenous matter and partly from carbohydrates, or, at least, that the lat- ter play a part in its formation. It would appear from this that life might be maintained on starch, water, salts, and meat free from fat; but although the theory seems a good one, practically it is found in actual experiment1 that nutrition is impaired by a lack of fat in the diet. The ill effects were soon seen, and immediate relief was given when fat was added to the food. Besides, in the food of all natious starch is constantly associated with some form of fat; bread with butter; potatoes with butter, cream, or gravy; macaroni and polenta with oil, and so forth. A man may live for a time and be healthy with a diet of al- buminoids, fats, salts, and water, but it has not yet been proved that a similar result will be produced by a diet of albuminoids, carbohydrates, salts, and water without fat. Fat is necessary to perfect nutrition. Health cannot be maintained on albuminoids, salts, and water alone; but, on the other hand, cannot be maintained without them. Probably the value of fats, as such, is dependent upon the ease with which they are digested. The fats eaten are not stored in the body directly, but the body constructs its fats from those eaten, and from other substances in food,â€”according to some author- ities from the carbohydrates and proteids, and accord- ing to others from proteids alone. Fats are stored away as fat, furnish heat, and are used for energy ; at least, it is probable that at times they are put to the latter use. The fats laid by in the body for future use last in cases of starvation quite a loug time, depending, of course, upon the amount. At such times a fat animal will live longer than a lean one. i Parkes.

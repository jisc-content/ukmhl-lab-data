52 EXPLANATORY LESSONS stomach. The digestion of starch is completed by the action of the pancreatic juice, possibly aided by intestinal juice, and consists in its being changed into glucose, which is absorbed in solution. Sugar. Cane-sugar, or common sugar (also called sucrose), passes through the mouth, unchanged, to the stomach, where it is converted into glucose by the slow action of the acid (hydrochloric) of the gastric juice. Dilute hydrochloric acid has the same action on sugar outside of the stomach. The action of pancreatic juice on sugar is very marked; it immediately changes cane-sugar into glu- cose. The effect of intestinal fluid is not well under- stood, but there is the general agreement that it does not change cane-sugar, neither is cane-sugar, as such, absorbed in the intestine. Bile does not affect it, therefore cane-sugar is digested or converted into glucose either by the stomach or pancreas, or both. It will now be seen that ultimately the same sub- stance, glucose, is obtained from both starch and sugar. Protein. We now come to the consideration of the digestion of the protein compounds, of which albu- men may be taken as a type. Possibly no action ex- cept breaking up and moistening takes place in the mouth.1 Its digestion begins in the stomach, where its structure is broken up and a separation and dis- solution of the little sacs which hold it take place. The same thing is partially accomplished outside of the stomach when white of egg is slightly beaten and strained through a cloth. Gastric juice further acts on the albumen itself, forming it into what is called albumen peptone. The digestion of raw and care- fully cooked albumen has been found to be carried on very rapidly in the stomach, and the change is i It is possible that albumen aud fibrin are actod upoii by some of the juices secreted in the moutli.

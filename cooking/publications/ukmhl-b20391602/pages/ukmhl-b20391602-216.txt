202 RECIPES RICE CREAM 2 Tablespoons of rice. 2 Cups of milk. 1 Saltspoon of salt. 2 Tablespoons of sugar. 2 Eggs. Cleanse the rice by washing it several times in cold water ; cook it in a double boiler with the milk until the grains will mash. Three hours will generally be required to do this. Should the milk evaporate, restore the amount lost. "When the rice is perfectly soft, press it through a coarse soup-strainer or col- ander into a saucepan, return it to the fire, and while it is heating beat the eggs, sugar, and salt together until very light. "When the rice boils, pour the egg in rather slowly, stirring lightly with a spoon for three or four minutes, or until it coagulates and the whole is like a thick, soft pudding; then remove from the fire, and pour it into a pretty dish. By omitting the yolks and using the whites of the eggs only, a delicate white cream is obtained. PEACH FOAM (delicious) Peel and cut into small pieces three or four choice and very ripe peaches (White Heaths are good), so that when done there will be a cupful. Put them into a bowl, with half a cup of powdered sugar, and the white of one egg. Beat with a fork for half an hour, when it will be a thick, perfectly smooth, vel- vety cream, with a delightful peach flavor, and may be eaten ad libitum by an invalid.

203 RECIPES SNOW PUDDING % Box of gelatine. £ Cup of cold water. 1 Cup of boiling water. 1 Cup of sugar. £ Cup of lemon-juice. Whites of three eggs.1 For the sauce: Yolks of two eggs. 2 Tablespoons of sugar. £ Saltspoon of salt. 1 Pint of milk. £ Teaspoon of vanilla. Divide a box of gelatine into fourths by notching one of the upright edges. Cut off one fourth of the box for a measure, which can afterward be used as a cover. "When taking out a fourth, be sure to pack the mea- sure as closely as it was packed in the box. Soak the gelatine in the cold water for half an hour. Then pour on the boiling water, add the sugar and lemon- juice, stir for a minute, and strain through a fine wire strainer into a granite pan; place the pau in iced water to cool. Meanwhile beat the eggs as light as possible, and as soon as the gelatine mixture begins to thicken, or is about as thick as honey, turn in the eggs, and stir slowly and regularly, with the back of the bowl of the spoon against the bottom of the pan, until the egg is mixed completely with the gelatine and the whole nearly stiff. Just before it becomes firm turn it into a melon-mold, and return it to the iced water to harden. It should be perfectly white, literally, like snow. 1 From Mrs. Lincoln's " Boston Cook Book."

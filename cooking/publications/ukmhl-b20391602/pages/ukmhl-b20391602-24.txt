EXPLANATORY LESSONS 10 pleasant. But when it is subjected to a certain de- gree of heat, for a certain time, it loses its toughness, becomes brittle, changes color, and there is developed in it a most agreeable flavor. This flavoring property is an actual product of the heat, which causes chem- ical changes in an essential oil, and without any doubt other substances, contained in the bean. Heat changes the odor and taste as well as the digestibility of food. Effects of Cold. Some foods are better for being cold; for example, butter, honey, salads, and some fruits. Sweet dishes as a rule are improved by a low tempera- ture. The flavor of butter is very different and very much'finer when cold than when warm. It is abso- lutely necessary to keep it cool in order to preserve the flavor. CHEMICAL AND PHYSICAL CHANGES Chemical Changes. Since many of the changes which cooking produces in the different food materials are of a chemical nature, it is well to consider what con- stitutes a chemical process. This idea may perhaps be best conveyed by a few experiments and illustra- tions, the materials for which may be easily obtained. Exp. with Cream of Tartar and Bicarbonate of Soda. Mix two teaspoons of cream of tartar with one of bicarbon- ate of soda, in a little warm water. A union of the two sub- stances follows and they neutralize each other; then the cream of tartar is no longer acid, and the soda is no longer alka- line. Owing to the power of chemical affinities a separation or breaking up of these compounds takes place, and new sub- stances, carbonic acid and rochelle salts, are formed out of their constituents. The effervescence which is seen is caused by the escape of the carbonic acid. Exp. with Hydrochloric Acid and Soda. Put a few drops of chemically pure hydrochloric acid into a little water; then add soda. A violent effervescence will follow. Continue putting

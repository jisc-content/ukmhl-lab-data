299 THE FEEDING OF CHILDREN Nothing should be used during the first twelve mouths except liquid food, and that must not be of too great density. Avoid any food which contains cellulose, or starch as such.1 Cellulose is but imperfectly if at all digested by grown persons; and starch, not being a natural kind of nourishment for an infant, is extremely liable to ferment and cause serious digestive disturbances. It should be remembered that, although the chief function of a babe is to eat, sleep, and grow, its stomach cannot work all the time, and, consequently, the wise plan is to feed it only at regular intervals. The best proof that a child is doing well is increase of weight, a healthy appearance, and lack of fretful- ness.

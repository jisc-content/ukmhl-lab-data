28 EXPLANATORY LESSONS Gelatinoids. The second class of protein compounds comprises the gelatinoids, gelatin being their lead- ing constituent. It is found in flesh, tendons, carti- lage and bone; in fact, it exists in all the tissues of the body, for the walls of most of the microscopic cells of which the tissues are composed contain gelatin. Exp. Boil a pound of lean meat freed from tendons, fat, and bone, in a pint of water for three hours; then set the liquid away to cool. Jelly resembling calf's-foot jelly will be the result. The cell-walls of the flesh have been dissolved by the long-continued action of heat and liquid. This is common- ly called stock or glaze. Exp. Put a piece of clean bone into a dilute solution of hy- drochloric acid. In two or three days the acid will have acted upon the earthy matters in the bone to remove them, and gela- tin will remain. The average amount in bone is about thirty per cent. Calves' feet were formerly used for jelly because of the excess of gelatin which they contain. They were cooked in water for a long time and the liquid reduced by further boiling; it was then clarified, flavored, and cooled; the result was a transparent, trembling jelly. The prepared gelatin of commerce, or gelatine, has now largely displaced this, for it is much more convenient to use, and less expensive. Extractives. The extractives or flavoring proper- ties of meats and other substances are usually classed with the protein compounds. Their chemical nature is not well understood. FATS Fixed and Volatile Oils. There are two classes of fats, called fixed oils and volatile oils. All kinds of fats good for food belong to the class of fixed oils. A volatile oil is one which evaporates away, like alco-

EXPLANATORY LESSONS 68 cannot take up what is not there, neither can the digestive organs supply what the food lacks; therefore, the food must contain in suitable proportions all sub- stances needed by the body. Also, food which contains a large proportion of waste, or is difficult of digestion from over or under cooking, or is unattractive by in- sipidity or unsavoriness, or is unwholesome in itself, interferes with normal and proper assimilation, over- works the digestive powers, and causes the whole sys- tem to suffer. Mal-nutrition, with the long line of evils which it entails, is the cause, direct or indirect, of most of the sickness in the world, for it reduces the powers of the system, and thus enfeebles its resist- ance to disease. Ideal Diet. " The ideal diet is that combination of food which, while imposing the least burden upon the body, supplies it with exactly sufficient material to meet its wants" (Schuster). In general the digestibility of foods may be sum- marized as follows: 1. The protein of ordinary animal foods is very readily and completely digestible. 2. The protein of vegetable foods is much less easily digested than that of animal foods. 3. The fat of animal foods may at times fail of digestion. 4. Sugar and starch are easy of digestion. 5. Animal foods have the advantage of vegetable foods in that they contain more protein, and that their protein is more easily digested. (Atwater.) A diet largely of animal food leaves very little un- digested matter. The albuminoids in all cases are completely transformed into nutriment. Fat enters the blood as a fine emulsion. Absorption. The general rule of absorption is that i'ood is taken into the circulation through the porous

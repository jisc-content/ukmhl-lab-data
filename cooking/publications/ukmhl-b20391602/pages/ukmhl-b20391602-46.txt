32 EXPLANATORY LESSONS than appearance, as the little ridges are true folds, and not overlapping edges. Size of Starch Grains. Starch grains vary in size ac- cording to the source from which the starch is ob- tained. Those of ground rice are very small, being about 30V0 of an inch in diameter; those of wheat are 10\0 of an inch, and those of potato 3-^ oi an inch. Starch is a carbohydrate, being composed of six parts of carbon, ten of hydrogen, and five of oxygen. Its symbol is C6H10O5. It is insoluble in water, but when the water is heated, the grains seem to absorb it; they increase in size, the ridges or folds disappear, and when the temperature reaches 140° Fahr. or a little over, they burst, and the contents mingle with the liquid forming the well-known paste. Test for Starch. Mix a teaspoon of starch with a cup of cold water and boil them together for a few minutes until a paste is formed; then set it aside to cool. Meanwhile make a solution of iodine by puttiug a few flakes into alcohol, or use that which is already prepared, and which may be obtained at any pharmacy. Add a drop of this solution to the paste mix- ture; it will immediately color the whole a rich dark blue. This is known as the "iodine test," and is a very valuable one to the chemist, for by means of it the slightest trace of starch can be detected. Exp. with Arrowroot. Make a thin paste by boiling a little arrowroot and water together. When cool test it with a drop of the iodine solution. The characteristic blue color will be very strong, showing that arrowroot is rich in starch. Similar tests may be made with grated potato, wheat-flour, rice-flour, tapioca, and other starch-con- taining substances. Also powdered sugar, cream of tartar, and other substances may be tested, when it is suspected that they have been adulterated with starch. Although starch grains burst and form a paste with water at 140° Fahr., that is not the temperature

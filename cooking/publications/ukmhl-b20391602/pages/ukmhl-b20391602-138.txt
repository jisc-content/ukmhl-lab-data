The point most to be observed in making this jelly is getting the juice from the oranges. The most natural way for one to do would be to cat the oranges in halves, and squeeze them in a lemon-squeezer, but that will not do, for the orange- oil of the rind is extracted in such large quantities as to destroy the delicate flavor of the jelly. The proper way to do is to peel the fruit, cut it in pieces, put them in a jelly-bag, and squeeze out the juice with the hand. COFFEE JELLY \ Box of gelatine. \ Cup of cold water. 1 Cup of boiling water. £ Cup of strong coffee. £ Teaspoon of vanilla. £ Cup of sugar. Soak the gelatine in the cold water for half an hour; then pour on the boiling water, and put in the sugar, coffee, and vanilla. Strain it through a napkin into a glass dish in which it may be served, and cool it as jellies are usually cooled, either in a refrigerator or in cold water,unless of course it is winter, when the jelly quickly becomes firm in any cool place, or it may be molded. Serve it with sweet cream and sugar, or, if it be molded, with whipped cream arranged around the form. The coffee should be strong, made with the propor- tion of two tablespoons of coffee to a cup of water. This delicious jelly is acceptable to most invalids. >

198 RECIPES to dissolve the sugar, cover it and place it on the stove-hearth, or any warm place, to heat sufficiently for the rennet to act upon the casein of the milk— that is, to about 98° Fahr. As soon as it is " set," or becomes solid, remove to a cool place, so that the sep- aration of the casein shall not go too far and whey appear. When it is cool, serve it in glass dishes. Ren- net custard may be flavored with nutmeg grated over the surface, or by stirring in with the rennet a tea- spoon of vanilla, or of rose-water, or a tablespoon of wine. When brandy is added, it is called junket. Liquid rennet is an extract of the inner lining of the stomach of the calf. It has the power of freeing the albuminous part of milk from its solution,—in other words, of coagulating it. Rennet custard is not of course strictly a custard; it is also called slip, and in Cape Cod it bears the graphic name of " Gap-and- swallow." EGG CREAM 2 Eggs. 2 Tablespoons of sugar. Juice and grated rind of half a lemon. Separate the yolks of the eggs from the whites, and beat them with the sugar in a bowl until both are well mixed. Then put in the lemon-juice and rind, and place the bowl in a dish of boiling water on the fire. Stir slowly until the mixture begins to thicken ; then add the beaten whites of the eggs and stir for two minutes, or until the whole resembles very thick cream; then remove it from the fire, pour into a small pudding-dish, and set it away to cool. Serve in small pretty china cups, or small glass dishes, for a mid-afternoon lunch or for tea.

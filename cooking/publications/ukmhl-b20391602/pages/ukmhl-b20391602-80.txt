Most of the water of the body is taken into it from without, but it is also formed in the body by the union of hydrogen and oxygen.1 Sodium chlorid, or common salt, is found in the blood and other fluids, and in the solids of the body, except the enamel of the teeth 5 it occurs in greatest proportion in the fluids. The part that this salt plays in nutrition is not altogether understood. "Common salt is intermediate in cei'tain general pro- cesses, and does not participate by its elements in the formation of organs" (Liebig). Salt is intimately associated with water, which plays an intermediate part also in nutrition, being a bearer or carrier of nutritious matters through the body. Salt seems to regulate the absorption and use of nutrients. It is found in the greatest quantity in the blood and chyle. It doubtless facilitates digestion by rendering foods more savory, and thus causing the digestive juices to flow more freely. Sodium chlorid is contained in most if not all kinds of food, but not in sufficient quantity to supply the wants of the body; it therefore becomes a necessary part of a diet. Potassium chlorid has similar uses to sodium chlo- rid, although not so generally distributed through the body. It is found in muscle, liver, milk, chyle, blood, mucus, saliva, bile, gastric juice, and one or two other fluids. Calcium phosphate is found in all the fluids and solids of the body, held in solution in them by the presence of C02; both it and calcium carbonate enter largely into the structure of the bones. Sodium carbonate, magnesium phosphate, and other salts play important parts in nutrition.

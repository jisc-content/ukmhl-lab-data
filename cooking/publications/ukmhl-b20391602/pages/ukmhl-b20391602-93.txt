If not needed at once, it may be set away to cool, when the fat will rise to the top, and form into a cake which may be lifted off. With Herbs. Make a broth according to the above rule, and flavor it with bay-leaves, mint, or with a bouquet of sweet herbs in the proportion of one tea- spoon to a quart of liquid. With Grains. One tablespoon of any of the follow- ing grains—rice, barley, oatmeal, or wheat—to one quart of liquid, gives a pleasant consistency and fla- vor to beef broth. Tapioca, sago, cold dry toast, or cuttings of bread may also be used. They should be put in when the broth is first set on the fire to cook, that they may be completely dissolved in the liquid. With Vegetables. Celery, onion, carrot, turnip, or shredded cabbage may be used in broth in the pro- portion of one tablespoon to a quart. Cabbage is better in combination with onion than alone. BROTH MADE FROM BEEFSTEAK (a quick method) Scrape the pulp from a pound of round or of sirloin steak, or mince the meat in a chopping-tray until it is fine; put it into a saucepan with just enough cold water to cover it, and let it come to the boiling-point slowly; then simmer it for fifteen minutes (better half an hour if there is time). Strain it, take off the fat with a sheet of paper, and season it with salt. This is a somewhat expensive but savory broth, and may easily be made on a gas or alcohol stove. A beef panada may be made by leaving the pulp in the broth and adding a little rolled cracker-crumbs or some bread softened and squeezed through a strainer.

157 RECIPES the eggs, but upon the ingredients which are added. Spanish omelet is ordinary omelet with onion. Truf- fles, mushrooms, chopped oysters, rum, and tomato make other varieties. Flour should never be used in them, as it cannot be properly cooked in the short time that should be given to the eggs. If it should happen that an omelet is to be made, and there is no milk at hand, water may be substituted, but an ome- let should never be made without one or the other. CREAMY OMELET Beat four eggs slightly with a fork until you can take up a spoonful; add two saltspoons of salt, half a saltspoon of pepper, four tablespoons of milk or cream, and mix well. Butter an omelet-pan, and be- fore the butter browns turn in the mixture. Then with the point of a fork pick or lift up the cooked egg from the center, and let the uncooked egg run under. This leaves the butter on the pan, and is bet- ter than stirring. Continue the lifting until the whole is of a soft creamy consistency, then place it over a hotter part of the fire and brown slightly, fold and turn out as usual. (Adapted from Mrs. D. A. Lincoln's "Boston Cook Book.") For an invalid's use take half the quantities men- tioned aboveâ€”that is, use two eggs, two tablespoons of milk or cream, a saltspoon of salt, and a bit of pep- per; and instead of having the omelet-pan hot, have it just warm enough to melt the butter; other- wise the first layer of egg which is cooked may be overdone and hardened.

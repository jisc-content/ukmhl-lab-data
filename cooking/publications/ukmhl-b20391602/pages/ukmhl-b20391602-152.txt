RECIPES 138 Cook the onion in the milk, and with it make a white sauce with the butter and flour; add this to the celery, and strain it through a soup-strainer, pressing and mashing with the back of a spoon until all but a few tough fibers of the celery are squeezed through. Re- turn the soup, in a double boiler, to the fire, and heat it until it is steaming, when it is ready to serve. By substituting chicken broth for water, and using celery-salt instead of fresh celery when it is not in sea- son, a very acceptable variation of this soup may be *nade. CKEAM-OF-RICE SOUP £ Cup of rice. 1 Pint of chicken broth or stock. 1 Pint of sweet cream. 1 Teaspoon of chopped onion. 1 Stalk of celery. 3 Saltspoons of salt. A little white pepper. £ Saltspoon of curry-powder. Pick over and wash the rice, and put it into the chicken broth in a saucepan to cook. 1 Simmer it slowly until the rice is very soft. It will require two hours' cooking to accomplish this. Half an hour before the rice is done put the cream into a saucepan with the onion, celery, pepper, and curry, and let them simmer slowly for twenty minutes; then pour the mixture into the rice; press all through a soup-strainer; add the salt, and set it back on the stove to heat to the boiling-point It should be a rather thin soup, not a puree. Should the broth boil away while the rice is cooking, or should the soup be too thick, add more broth, or some water.

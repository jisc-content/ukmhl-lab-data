EECIPES 94 INDIAN-MEAL MUSH 1 Cup of corn-meal. 1 Teaspoon of salt. 1 Quart of boiling water. No. 1. Make the corn-meal and salt into a paste with a little cold water, then pour in the boiling water and cook it in a double boiler for five hours. No. 2. Put the salt into the water, and when the water reaches the boiling-point stir in the dry meal by taking a handful and sprinkling it slowly through the fingers. Use a wooden spoon for stirring. Boil an hour and a half. Or, wet the meal in a little cold water, and pour over it the boiling water. The most important point is thoroughness in the cooking, which should be done carefully so that the pudding may not burn on the bottom of the dish. If the temperature be regulated so that it just simmers, there will be lit- tle danger of this. Serve with maple syrup, or with cream. RICE £ Cup of rice. 1 Teaspoon of salt. 2 Cups of boiling water. Prepare the rice by removing from it all visible foreign substances,— bits of metal, chips, black ker- nels, etc.; then wash it four times in cold water to take out dust, possible hairs, and bits of lint. Put the rice and salt in the upper vessel of a double boiler, pour in the boiling water and cook it one hour without stirring. During this time the water in the under ves- sel should boil continuously, otherwise more than one hour will be necessary. Rice thus cooked is excellent.

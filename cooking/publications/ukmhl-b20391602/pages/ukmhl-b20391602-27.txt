EXPLANATORY LESSONS 13 be proved to be compounds. Sulphur is at present in the doubtful list. Oxygen. Oxygen is an element. It is an invisible gas, without taste or smell. It is the most abundant substance in the world, and an exceedingly active agent, entering into nearly all chemical chauges and forming compounds with all known elements except oneâ€”fluorin. It is a necessity of life and of combus- tion.1 It constitutes about two thirds of the weight of our bodies and one fifth of the weight of the air. Hydrogen. Hydrogen is a gas. It is the lightest substance known. It unites with oxygen to form water, and, as will be seen later, enters into the com- position of the human body.2 Nitrogen. Nitrogen is also a gas, but, unlike oxygen, is an inactive element. It supports neither fire nor life. It is not poisonous, however, for we breathe it constantly in the atmosphere, where its office is to dilute the too active oxygen. A person breathing it in a pure state dies simply from lack of oxygen. Carbon. Carbon is a solid and an important and abundant element. It is known under three forms: diamond, graphite, and charcoal. The diamond is nearly pui*e carbon. Graphite (the " black-lead" of lead-pencils), coal, coke, and charcoal are impure forms of it. Carbon is combustible; that is, it burns or combines with oxygen. In this union carbonic acid is formed, and there is an evolution of heat, and usually, if the union be rapid and intense enough, of light. It is the valuable element in fuels, and in the body of man it unites with the oxygen of the air, yielding heat, to keep the body warm, and energy or 1 Oxygen is often called the supporter of combustion, but it is no more so than the carbon and hydrogen of fuels, since they are neces- sary for a Are,. 2 Hydrogen is 14.44 times lighter than air.

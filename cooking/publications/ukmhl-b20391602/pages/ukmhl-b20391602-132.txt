RECIPES 118 This is said to be the most economical method of mak- ing, as more is obtained from the coffee by this treat- ment. The flavor is certainly fine. Long boiling dissipates the delicious aromatic oils, and as probably these are the most valuable properties of the coffee, the necessity of preserving them is easily seen. Care should be taken not to boil coffee for more than from three to five minutes, and simmer rather than boil, so as to preserve as much as possible the fine flavors which are so quickly dissipated by boiling; yet the high temperature seems to be necessary to extract the desirable properties of the bean. One must there- fore ever bear in mind the seeming paradox that coffee should reach the boiling-point, and yet not boil. We do not estimate highly enough the value of flavors. It is a well-demonstrated fact among a few persons that many dishes containing actual nutri- tious principles are but partially or imperfectly di- gested, because of their lack of good flavor, either from want of proper preparation, lack of seasoning, or poor cooking. There is no doubt that many peo- ple suffer from indigestion after eating such food. Use in coffee-making either silver, granite-ware, or earthenware urns or pots, never tin. They should be made perfectly clean before using, especial atten- tion being necessary for the spout.

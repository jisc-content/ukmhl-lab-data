EECIPES 252 DREAM CAKE Make a white cake mixture. Bake it in shallow layer-cake pans, in a moderate, not slow, oven. Join them with a caramel filling, and frost the top with the same, or use White Mountain frosting instead of the caramel, flavored with rose-water, and left either white, or colored a delicate shell pink with carmine. CAKE FILLING AND FROSTING WHITE MOUNTAIN FROSTING Boil together, without stirring, one cup of granu- lated sugar with one third of a cup of boiling water, for eight or ten minutes. When the sugar has been boiling five minutes, beat the white of one egg until it is very light. Then test the sugar mixture by let- ting a little run off the side of a spoon. If in falling it forms a delicate thread, it is just at the point to stop the boiling. When it has reached this point, pour it at once into the beaten egg in a small stream, stirring the egg constantly to keep it smooth. Con- tinue stirring for two or three minutes until it begins to thicken, then spread it either between layer cakes for filling, or use it for frosting. CARAMEL FILLING 1 Cup of brown sugar. \ Cup of sweet cream. 1 Teaspoon of butter.

Meanwhile, with sickness always in our midst, we should keep the ideal ever before us, and endeavor by all means to restore suffering hu- man beings to a perfect state of health. A sound body is a material thing, prosaically nourished by material substauces, which produce just as exact re- sults in its chemical physiology as if those substances entered into combination in the laboratory of the chemist. The cooking of food should be governed by exact laws which for the most part as yet re- main undemonstrated. It is a foregone conclusion that many young women fail in their first attempts at cooking; that they do so is not surprising, for not only are their friends unable to teach them, but the majority of books on the subject furnish no intelligible aid.1 The science of cookery is still in the empirical stage.

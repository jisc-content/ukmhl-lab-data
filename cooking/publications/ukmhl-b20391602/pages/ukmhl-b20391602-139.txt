RECIPES 125 FRENCH JELLY WITH FRESH FRUITS Make a wine jelly according to the recipe on page 122. When it has lost some of its heat, but before it begins to thicken, pour into it a pint of carefully picked and cleaned raspberries, distributing them evenly through the liquid; then set it away in a cool place, or in a refrigerator, to harden. This makes a nice dessert when served with sugar and cream. Other fruits and other jellies may be combined at the dis- cretion of the maker. Orange jelly with oranges and bananas is very good. RESTORATIVE JELLY £ Box of gelatine. 1 Cup of port wine. 1 Tablespoon of powdered gum arabic. 2 Tablespoons of lemon-juice. 3 Tablespoons of sugar. 2 Cloves. £ Square inch of cinnamon. Put the gelatine, wine, and spice into a double boiler, or if one is not at hand, improvise one by placing a bowl in a pan of water. Set the boiler on the fire, and when the gelatine is dissolved, put in the gum arabic, lemon, and sugar. Stir thoroughly; strain it quickly through a fine napkin, and cool it in a shallow dish, so that the layer of jelly shall be an inch thick. It is to be cut into cubes, which may be served two or three at a time, to be held in the mouth until melted. The gum arabic may be omitted.

Then add the flavoring and the remaining pint of milk or cream, and freeze. LEMON SHERBET WITH GELATINE 1 Tablespoon of gelatine. 1 Pint of boiling water. 1 Cup of sugar. | Cup of lemon-juice. 1 Tablespoon of brandy. Soak the gelatine (phosphated or any good kind) in a little cold water for half an hour. Then pour over it the boiling water, stirring until the gelatine is dis- solved ; add the sugar, lemon-juice, and brandy, and strain all through a fine wire strainer. Freeze. There are various kinds of gelatine in market, not differing much from each other except, perhaps, in the degree of refining. For sherbets and water-ices select that having a delicate taste with no suspicion of "fishy" flavor. The phosphated gelatine should not be used except when a slight acidity will do no harm. Avoid it for all dishes made with cream or milk, as it will curdle them. The directions on the packages advise neutralizing the acid with soda; but, as there is no means of determiniug the amount of acid in a given quantity, it is not a process that rec- ommends itself to an intelligent person. Phosphated gelatine may, however, be used in sherbets even when milk or cream forms a part of them, for when it is added to a slightly acid mixture which has a low temperature, or is partially frozen, curdling does not take place.

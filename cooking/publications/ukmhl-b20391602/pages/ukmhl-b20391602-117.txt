RECIPES 103 taut, as it is a process of sterilization which takes place, and the temperature must be maintained for a given time or the desired result will not be accom- plished. The condition of the bottle also must be carefully considered, as the thorough cleaning and scalding is for the purpose of rendering it sterile. This is most easily and thoroughly done by filling the bottle with hot water and placing it in a kettle of boiling water for half an hour. To Use. Dilute the juice with cool water (not iced water) or soda-water in the proportion of one half juice to one half water. From Oranges. The oranges should be peeled and the seeds removed, and then treated in the same way as the strawberries in the preceding rule, except that to every quart of fruit the juice of two lemons should be added. From Raspberries. Employ the same method as for strawberries. From Currants. The same as for strawberries, ex- cept that three fourths of the bulk of the fruit of sugar should be used instead of one half. With Other Fruits. Other fruits, such as apricots, peaches, cranberries, apples, etc., may be used for syrups, varying the water and sugar according to the kind of fruit used. Apples, apricots, and peaches will require half their bulk of water. FRUIT JUICE FOR USE WITH SODA-WATER. No. 2 Sprinkle two cups of sugar over one box of ripe strawberries, which, of course, have been hulled and washed, and set them away for three hours, or until the juice has oozed out of the fruit and made a thick syrup with the sugar. Strain the juice, bottle it, and put it in a cool place. It will keep for three days.

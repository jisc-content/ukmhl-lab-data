When there is any variation from this, it will be men- tioned under the rule for each. SQUABS Squabs are young domestic pigeons. The Philadel- phia market supplies nearly all of those used in the eastern part of the United States. Remove the feathers, and all pin-feathers; cut off the head and legs, and split the bird down the back carefullj'- with a sharp knife. Lift out carefully the contents of the body, which are contained in a little sac or delicate membrane; they should be taken out without breaking. Do not forget the windpipe, crop, lungs, and kidneys. "Wash, and prepare the squab in the same manner that chicken is done, except 'the dip- ping in butter and dredgiug with flour; this may be omitted, as squabs are generally fat and do not require it. Broil from twelve to fifteen minutes, according to the size of the bird and the intensity of the fire. It should be well done. Serve on hot but- tered toast. PARTRIDGE The partridge is a white-fleshed bird. It may be broiled or roasted.

EXPLANATORY LESSONS 70 suggesting dishes, may do much toward restoring the person to health and strength. As a very large percentage of diseases arise from imperfect nutrition (as large as eighty per cent, being given by some writers), the sense of taste is usually very much disturbed and dulled in illness; therefore those kinds of food which are savory, and at the same time easy of digestion and nutritious, should be se- lected. The savory quality is very important. A person in health may endure badly cooked food and monotony in diet; a person recovering from an ill- ness cannot but suffer by it.

The decision of No. 1 (food suited to the digestive powers) is the most difficult, and here again the doc- tor will advise for particular or peculiar diseases.

A baked potato done in a hot oven, just to the point, and served immediately, is a delicious dish ; overdone, or done in an oven of low temperature, and served lukewarm, it is very far from appetizing.

231 RECIPES use of paraffin, as, for instance, with paper soaked in alcohol, or coated with oil ,â€¢ but paraffin, if properly- used, is a sure, easy, and economical means. A wad of sterilized cotton batting, packed into the mouth of the jar or tumbler, like a stopper, is some- times employed, but it is not as effectual as the paraffin; for that, being poured in hot, sterilizes the sm'face of the jelly, thus killing any organisms that may have lodged upon it during the cooling. Organ- isms cannot go through batting; but, though it may be properly sterilized, it cannot be packed over the jelly until it has become firm, and during the time ferments may have settled upon it. Paraffin is a most satisfactory means of preserving jelly, and the only precaution necessary in using it is to put on two lay- ers, the second one two or three hours after the first, or when all contraction has ceased.

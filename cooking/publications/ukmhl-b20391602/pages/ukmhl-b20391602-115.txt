101 RECIPES MILK AND SODA-WATER Into a glass half full of fresh milk put an equal quantity of soda-water. Use at once. This is an agreeable way to take milk, and is a nutritious and refreshing drink. TOAST-WATER Cut three slices of bread each a third of an inch thick, and toast them slowly until very brown and dry throughout; break them into small pieces, put them into a bowl with a pint of cold water, and set aside to soak for an hour; at the end of that time turn it into a strainer or napkin, and squeeze out the liquid with the back of a spoon. To the water thus obtained add a little cream and sugar, and serve it cold in a tumbler. It may also be served without the cream. BARLEY-WATER 1 Tablespoon of barley flour. 1 Teaspoon of sugar. 1 Saltspoon of salt. 1 Quart of water. Boil the flour, water, sugar and salt together fifteen minutes, and strain. Barley-water may also be made by boiling two tablespoons of barley (the grain) in a quart of water for one hour. A teaspoonful of lemon-juice or tama- rind-juice may be used as flavoring. 8

44 EXPLANATORY LESSONS warm, pure air, and a means for the removal of the same after it has been used, the current being so con- trolled that, although the air is kept in motion, there is no perceptible draft. The plan for the heating and ventilation of the Johns Hopkins Hospital, Baltimore, Maryland, is a most admirable one. Air from out of doors is con- veyed by a flue into a chamber in the wall, in which are coils of pipe filled with hot water. The air in passing over these becomes warm, and, rising, passes into the room to be heated through a register. On the oppo- site side of the room is a chimney-like flue, run- ning to the top of the building and containing two registers, by the opening and closing of which the movements of the air in the room can be con- trolled. The temperature is maintained by the tem- perature of the water in the pipes, and the rapidity of the flow.1 The ventilation by this method of heating is the most perfect known to the author, who has lived for two years in a building thus supplied with warmth and fresh air. The rooms were invariably comfortable as to temperature, and the air as invariably sweet and pure. MILK Milk is one of our most perfect types of food, con- taining water and solids in such proportions as are known to be needful for the nourishment of the body. A proof of this is seen in the fact that it is the only food of the young of the Mammalia during the time of their greatest growth. It contains those food prin- ciples in such amounts as to contribute to the rapid 1 For a detailed description of this method of heating and ventila. tion, see the report of tho Johns Hopluns Hospital for the year 1891.

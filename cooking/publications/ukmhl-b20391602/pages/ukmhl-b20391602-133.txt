RECIPES 119 Put the water and spice together in a saucepan, and boil for ten minutes; then add the wine, and let the liquid just reach the boiling-point; meanwhile beat the egg and sugar in a bowl, and just at the moment when the wine begins to boil, pour it slowly into the egg, stirring constantly to distribute the heat through- out the whole. Unless the weather is very cold, there is usually enough heat in the boiling liquid to coagu- late the albumen of the egg slightly, but should this not be accomplished, set it on the fire for a minute to finish. When done it should be of the consistency of cream. Do not let the wine and water boil for any appreciable time, for boiling dissipates some of the pleasant flavor of the wine. Beer, ale, and porter are excellent, mulled in the same way. COCOA CORDIAL \ Teaspoon of Dutch cocoa. Some boiling water. 2 Blocks of loaf-sugar. 2 Tablespoons of port wine. Put the cocoa and sugar into a china cup, and pour directly upon them some boiling water, then add the wine, making in all the usual amount served in a cup. Use immediately. This is an excellent drink for those who are chilled or exhausted, or to take after a bath.

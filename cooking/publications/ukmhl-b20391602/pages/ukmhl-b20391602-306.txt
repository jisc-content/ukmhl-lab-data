292 THE FEEDING OF CHILDREN wheat by this process. Nestles food contains dried milk. These foods are all valuable when made into gruel or porridge, but should be used very sparingly under the age of twelve months, and then only as attenuants for milk, not as substitutes for it. Dr. Mary Putnam Jacobi, editor of " Domestic Hy- giene of the Child," by Uffelmann (a translation), in speaking of the value of the various preparations of infants' food on the market, says: " There is not the slightest reason to prefer them to milk or its prepara- tions, except that the latter requires more care; and for any intelligent and affectionate mother this rea- son is quite insufficient. . . . During the first year the baby is building up tissues and organs that are to last him throughout life; and these will work well or ill according to the degree of perfection and pre- cision of structure which they attain at the begin- ning. And this depends to an immense extent upon the suitability of the food, not only to be digested, but to be absorbed, and then to be assimilated and organized. " So mysterious are the properties of the molecules of albumen and fat, when once they have been thrown into the whirl of the living organism, that we must strive to deviate as little as possible from the exact forms given to us in nature, if only because we do not know what remote effects might result from the deviations. If nature provides the albumen of milk and a living fluid, we cannot expect the same results from any other albumen, or from long dead organic matter, as condensed milk." The farinaceous foods have value, but they cannot .replace good milk, which should be almost the sole food of the child to at least the age of ten months, and the principal nutrient to the age of two yeai*s.

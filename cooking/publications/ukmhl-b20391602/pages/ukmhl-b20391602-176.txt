1G2 EECIPES average of thirty-one analyses of the ash of potatoes gave 59.8 per cent, of potash, 19.1 per cent, of phos- phoric acid, the other ingredients being in exceedingly small proportions. These salts are necessary to a healthy condition of the blood. Potatoes are a valu- able antiscorbutic. According to Mattieu Williams, scurvy prevailed in Norway to a very serious extent until the intro- duction of the potato; and Lang, with other good authorities, testifies that its disappearance is due to the use of potatoes by a people who formerly were in- sufficiently supplied with salts-giving vegetable food. The salts of the potato are most abundant in or near the skin, and the decision of the question as to whether potatoes shall be pared or not before cook- ing is somewhat aided by this fact. For persons who eat but few other fresh vegetables by all means leave the skins on, but for those who have access to a good kitchen garden and have plenty of other vegetables and fruits from which to get their salts, it makes no important difference whether the skins are removed. The potato is eminently a starch food, and this knowledge indicates the method of treatment in cook- ing. Since starch is its principal ingredient (the amount of nitrogenous matter being very small), if it is cooked with reference to that alone, it will be done in the best possible manner. Starch, in order to be rendered most digestible and acceptable to the human system, must be subjected to a high temperature in the presence of some liquid. At 401Â° Fahr. (see pages 33 and 34) it is converted into dextrine. This change, if not performed outside the body, will be done in the ordinary processes of diges- tion after the starch is eaten; therefore the nearer we approach to it in cooking, the more perfectly is the food prepared which contains it.

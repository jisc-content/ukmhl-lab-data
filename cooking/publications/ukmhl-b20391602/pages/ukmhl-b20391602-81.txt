EXPLANATORY LESSONS 67 i Martin. The various salts influence chemical change as well as act in rendering food soluble. For example, serum albumen, the chief proteid of the blood, is insoluble in pure water, but dissolves easily in water which has a little neutral salts in it.1 Salts also help to give firmness to the teeth and bones. To recapitulate, food is eaten, digested, assimilated, and consumed or transformed in the body by a series of highly intricate and complex processes. It is for the most part used for the different powers and ac- tivities of the system; there is, however, always a small portion which is rejected as waste. The first change is in the mouth, where the food is broken up and moistened and the digestion of starch begins; these changes continue in the stomach until the whole - is reduced to a more or less liquid mass. As the con- tents of the stomach pass little by little into the duo- denum, the mass becomes more fluid by the admixture of bile, and pancreatic juice, and, as it passes aloug, digestion and absorption takes place; the mass grows darker in color and less fluid, until all good material is taken up and only waste left, which is rejected from the body. That portion of the food which is not affected by the single or united action of the digestive fluids is chiefly of vegetable origin. Hard seeds, such as corn, and the outer coverings of grains, such as the husk of oatmeal and those parts which are composed largely of cellulose, pass through the intestinal canal without change. It may be remarked here that since the digestive mechanism is so perfect a structure, and will try to dissolve anything given it, aud select only that which is good, why should there be the necessity of giving any special attention to preparing food before it is eaten? The answer is that the absorptive vessels

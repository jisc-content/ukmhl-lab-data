234 RECIPES pare. It simply requires a mixture of water and some material in which the plant cells will rapidly grow. Grated raw potato, cooked by pouring on boiling water, flour, and sugar form an excellent food for their propagation. A recipe for yeast will be given later. Now we have come to the consideration of what will take place when the two, flour and yeast, are made into dough. According to some accounts of the sub- ject, the yeast begins to act first upon the starch, con- verting it into sugar (glucose C0Hi2O0). "While this is taking place there is no apparent change, for no- thing else is formed except the glucose, or sugar. Then this sugar is changed into alcohol and car- bonic acid; the latter, owing to its diffusive nature, endeavors to escape, but becomes entangled in the viscous mass and swells it to several times its orig- inal bulk. This has been the accepted explanation; it is now, however, believed not to be correct. It is thought, and I believe demonstrated, that the yeast plant lives upon sugar; that it has not the power to act di- rectly upon starch, but that it is capable of producing a substance which acts upon starch to convert it into sugar. The production of the carbonic acid is the end of desirable chemical change, and when it has been carried to a sufficient degree to fill the dough with bubbles, it should be stopped. Kneading bread is for the purpose of distributing the gas and breaking up the large bubbles into small ones, to give the loaf a fine grain. One will imme- diately see that kneading before the bread is raised is a more or less useless task. Kneading is a process which should be done gently, by handling the dough with great tenderness; for if it is pressed hard against

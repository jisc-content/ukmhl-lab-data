Adaptation of Foods to Particular Needs and Conditions. The demands of different individuals for nutrients in the daily food vary with age, occupation, and other conditions of life, including especially the peculiar characteristics of people. No two persons are ex- actly alike in their expenditure of muscular and ner- vous energy, so no two will need the same amount or kind of nutriment to repair the waste. A man who digs in a field day after day expends a certain amount of muscidar energy. A lawyer, states- man, or author who works with his brain instead of his hands uses nervous force, but very little muscular. Brain and muscle are not nourished exactly by the same materials; therefore, the demand in the way of nutriment of these two classes will not be the same. The lawyer might find a feast in a box of sardines and some biscuit, while the field laborer would look with contempt upon such food, and turn from it to fat pork and cabbage. This is no mere difference in refinement of taste, but a real and instinctive differ- ence in the demands of the two constitutions. Sar- dines supply to the brain-worker the material he needs, and the pork and cabbage to the laborer the heat and energy he expends. In health the sense of taste is the best guide to what is demanded by the system, and may as a gen- eral rule be followed; but in sickness that will not do, as the sense of taste in particular is disturbed by most forms of disease. When a patient is very ill only the simplest foods will be used, and those will be prescribed by the physician ; but when a patient is out of danger, and the necessity for variety comes, then the nurse, by preparing or

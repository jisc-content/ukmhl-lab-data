107 RECIPES To Make Sweet Kumiss. Ferment the kumiss mix- ture for twelve hours in a temperature of 70° Fahr.,— that is, the same degree of heat that is required for raising bread. Do not attempt to open a bottle of kumiss without a champagne-tap, for the carbonic acid generated in the fermenting liquid has enormous expansive force, and will throw the contents all over the room if the bottle be opened in the ordinary way. In an emergency, however, the cork may be punc- tured with a stout needle to let the gas escape. The mouth of the bottle may then be held in a large bowl or dish and the cords cut, when the kumiss will rush out, usually, however, without so much force but that it may nearly all be caught. It should look like thick, foamy cream. Kumiss is highly recommended as an article of sick diet, being especially valuable for many forms of in- digestion and for nausea. Often it will be retained in the stomach when almost anything else would be rejected. It is partially predigested milk, containing carbonic acid and a little alcohol, both of which have a tonic effect. True kumiss is an Eastern product made from mare's milk, but in this country cow's milk is always em- ployed. Sometimes the term Jcefer is given to it, when kefer grains are used for the fermentation. It may be obtained in nearly all pharmacies, but a better quality can be made at home at slight expense. Sometimes patients will objectto taking kumiss, on account ofHhe odor, which is not pleasant to every one, but it leaves a peculiarly agreeable after-taste in the mouth, and one who has once taken a glass of it will seldom refuse a second offer. Kumiss has consider- able dietetic value, beiug useful in various forms of indigestion.

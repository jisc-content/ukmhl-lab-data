RECIPES 140 1 Pint of milk. 1 Stalk of celery, or some celery-salt. 1 Tablespoon of chopped onion. \ Square inch of mace. 1 Scant teaspoon of salt. £ Saltspoon of white pepper. £ Teaspoon of butter. The broth for this dish may be made by boiling the bones of a roast with the left-over pieces of meat, and then reducing the liquor until it is strong enough. Put the tapioca to soak in the cold water, overnight if it be the common, coarse kind, but if pearl or gran- ulated tapioca is used, twenty minutes will do. Then add the chicken stock, and simmer it until the tapioca is completely softened. It will require two or three hours. About half an hour before the tapioca will be done, put the milk, celery, onion, and mace into a saucepan to cook, and as soon as the tapioca becomes soft pour it in; remove from the fire, and strain the whole through a wire strainer, forcing through with a spoon all the grains of tapioca. Then add the salt, pepper, and butter j set it back on the stove, and heat it just to the boiling-point, when it is ready to serve.

280 THE FEEDING OF CHILDEEN There are three ways in which a child may be sup plied with food during its infancy: by its mother; by a substitute for its mother—a wet nurse; and by artificial feeding. This chapter will treat only of the latter method. The child is fortunate whose mother can supply it with a sufficient quantity of wholesome milk. There is nothing more to be desired for it during the first ten or twelve months of its life. But often a mother, for one reason or another, is not able to nurse her child, and other means of feeding must be sought. In such cases, among the wealthier classes, a wet nurse is sometimes employed; but with the majority of people there is no alternative except artificial feed- ing. When this has been decided upon, the question naturally arises as to what shall be the best substi- tute for the natural nourishment of the child—moth- er's milk, which must always be taken as the perfect type of infants' food.1 To this subject doctors and hygienists have given much attention for a long time. 1 It should not be inferred from this that mother's milk is the best under all circumstances. It not infrequently happens that a mother, disregarding all indications to the contrary, will continue to nurse her baby after it has become disastrous both to herself and the infant to do so. If a baby remains puny, and the mother is exhausted and languid without any known cause, it is the part of wisdom to call in the aid of a physician, and have the milk analyzed. Good and careful feeding is infinitely better than nursing a baby upon impoverished milk, even if the quantity seems sufficient. A mother, in nursing her cliild, should do so at stated regular intervals. If it is injurious for a grown person to cat at odd times all day long, it is far more injurious for an infant. It will not hurt a child to bo occasionally hungry, or even to cry,

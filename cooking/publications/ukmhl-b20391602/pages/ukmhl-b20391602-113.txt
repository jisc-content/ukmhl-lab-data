99 RECIPES sufficiently high to insure their destruction. Some micro-organisms are killed at 136° Fahr., but this temperature cannot "be said to destroy, or to inhibit the growth of all bacteria commonly found in milk. We must endeavor then to use such a degree of heat as shall accomplish this without seriously injuring the natural properties and flavors of the liquid. Authori- ties vary on this point, some putting the temperature as high as 212° Fahr., and others as low as 167° Fahr. The author has found, in an • experience of two years in sterilizing milk every day, that 190° Fahr. is, under ordinary circumstances, a safe and easily practicable temperature to employ. With this degree of heat the flavor of the milk is excellent. The process is as follows: The milk is put into clean glass flasks or bottles with small mouths which are stoppered with plugs of cotton batting, or, as it is sometimes called, " cotton-wool." These are placed in a wire basket, and the basket immersed in a kettle of warm water, the temperature of which is not allowed to exceed 190° Fahr. As soon as the heat is at or near that point the time is marked, and the milk is kept at that temperature for one hour. Then the bottles are removed, cooled quickly, and placed in the re- frigerator. If it is desirable to keep the milk an in- definite time, the process should be repeated the second day, and again the third day, a third sterilization be- ing necessary to insure success, since spores of organ- isms may escape the first and even the second heating. For all ordinary household purposes, however, and as a safe food for the sick, heating once is all that is necessary. Milk thus treated will keep in the tempera- ture of an ordinary room, even in warm weather, from twenty to thirty hours. By using the small-mouthed flasks very little scum is formed, and thus most of the nitrogenous portion is preserved in the milk.

THE FEEDING OP CHILDREN 289 Owing to the additional sugar it is impossible to dilute it so that the protein and sugar shall approach the standard of human milk. Children fed with it are plump, but have soft flesh; they are large, but not strong, and lack the power of endurance and resistance to disease. Their teeth come late, and they are very likely to have rickets.1 This is enough to indicate that it is not a proper food upon which to feed a child exclusively. Condensed milk is valuable in emergencies or in traveling, aud may also be used occasionally when for any reason the milk supply fails. It has the advan- tage of being free from ferments and easily kept. There are physicians who recommend the use of condensed milk, and no doubt, compared with the germ-laden, watery fluid called milk, obtainable in the poorer sections of large cities, it is infinitely bet- ter. It should always be diluted with at least ten times its bulk of water. Preserved Milk. Preserved milk is milk which has been condensed and canned without the addition of sugar. It would be a valuable food for children were it not that it is expensive, and will keep but a few hours after the can is opened. By sterilizing it in flasks with narrow necks, plugged with cotton, it may be kept as other milk is for an indefinite time. As soon as the can is opened, the contents should be poured into a glass or earthen vessel, for, on expos- ure of the milk to the air, chemical action takes place with the tin.2 Farinaceous Foods. There are many farinaceous forms of food prepared for the use of infants and children. Probably the most valuable of them are 1 See the works of Drs. Louis Starr, TJffelmann, and Jacobi. 2 The amount of condensation in preserved milk may be easily ascer- tained by noting the amount of water which it Is necessary to add in order to make its specific gravity equal to that of ordinary milk.

57 EXPLANATORY LESSONS amount of energy of the body depends upon two things—the amount in the food eaten, and the ability of the body to use it, or free it for use. With every motion, and every thought and feeling, material is consumed, hence the more rapid wearing out of persons who do severe work, and of the nervous — those who are keenly susceptible to evei-y change in their surroundings, to change of weather, even to the thoughts and feelings of those about them.

He cannot lift the same weight, cannot walk as far, cannot work as hard. We do not as easily comprehend the nervous organism, and generally have less sympathy with worn-out or ill-nourished nerves than muscles, but the sensibilities and the intellectual faculties, of which the nerves and brain are but the instruments, depend upon the right nutrition of the whole system for their proper and healthful exercise. So many factors enter into the make-up of a thought that it cannot be said that any particular kind of food will ultimately produce a poem; but of this we may be sure, that the best work, the noblest thoughts, the most original ideas, will not come from a dyspeptic, underfed, or in any way ill-nourished individual.

These different classes seem to serve different pur-

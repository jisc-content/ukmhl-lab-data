iv PREFACE multiplying or dividing the formula any quantity may be made, with uniform results. Detailed descriptions have been given in order that those who know nothing of cooking may be able, by in- telligently following the instructions, to make acceptable dishes. Repetition and similarity of arrangement will, it is hoped, serve to impress upon the mind certain points and principles. In some instances the recipes are original, but for the most part the ideas have been gathered from lessons and lectures on cooking, and from standard books, among them Mrs. IAncoMs "Boston Cook Book." Generally the order in which each recipe has been written is the order in which the different ingredients should be put together. The proportions have been placed first, and separately from the description of the process, for greater conve- nience in using. Valuable information for the chapter on the feeding of children was found in Uffelmann's "Hygiene of the Child." I gratefully acknowledge the assistance of Drs. Simon Flexner and William D. Booker of the Johns Hopkins Hospital in reviewing, respectively, the explanatory les- sons and the chapter on the feeding of children. Baltimore, Jan. 18,1893. ^" ^'

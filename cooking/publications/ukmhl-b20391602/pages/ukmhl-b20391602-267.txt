EECIPES 253 Boil all together until it threads, stirring it slowly as it boils. It will take about eight minutes. Use either for frosting or filling. CHOCOLATE ICING Â£ Cup of sugar. 4 Tablespoons of water. 2 Eggs. 1 Ounce of chocolate, or 1 Tablespoon of Dutch cocoa. 1 Teaspoon of vanilla. Boil the sugar, water, and chocolate together, two minutes, to render the chocolate smooth. Then add the beaten eggs. Cook two minutes more, stirring slowly and gently. Add the vanilla just as it is taken from the fire, and use at once, as it becomes firm quickly. It is good either for icing cakes or for filling. CREAM FILLING Make a cream sauce with one cup of milk, a table- spoon of butter, and a tablespoon of flour. Beat one egg with half a cup of sugar, and stir it into the sauce slowly. Cook for two minutes, or until the egg is done. It should look like a thick smooth cream. Flavor it with a piece of cinnamon bark boiled in the milk, or with vanilla or almond. Use this cream for filling, for layer cakes, or split a thin sponge cake in two, and spread it between the halves. In compiling the foregoing recipes valuable information was found in the Boston Cook Book, permission to the use of which was kindly given by its author, Mrs. D. A. Lincoln.

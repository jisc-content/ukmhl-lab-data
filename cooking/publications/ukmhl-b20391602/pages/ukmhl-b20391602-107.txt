GRANULA Granula is a breakfast grain which has been par- tially prepared by dry heat, and is almost cooked enough to use. It is sometimes recommended that it be prepared by simply boiling a minute in milk.

CRACKED OR ROLLED WHEAT 1 Cup of cracked wheat. 1 Teaspoon of salt. 3 Cups of water. Pick over the wheat, to remove any foreign sub- stance that may be in it. Put it with the salt and the water (boiling) into a double boiler, and cook for two hours. Serve with cream and sugar, either hot or cold. If it is desirable to have it cold, it may be molded in cups or small round jelly-molds.

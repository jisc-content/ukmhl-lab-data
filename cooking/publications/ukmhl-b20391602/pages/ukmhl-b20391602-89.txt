PART II 75 RECIPES BEEF-JUICE, BEEF-TEA, AND BROTHS Beef-Juice. The clear juice of beef, slightly diluted with water, is always excellent, being especially use- ful for its strong flavors. It is like concentrated beef-tea, and is often valuable in pleasantly exciting the action of the mouth and stomach after a long ill- ness in which milk has been the chief article of diet. Beef-juice is best made by broiling the beef. Pre- pared in this way, the flavor is superior, and it is a quick and easy method; but when a proper broiling fire cannot be had, then it may be made in a glass jar like beef-tea, except without the water. Beef-Tea is valuable for its stimulating properties and for the warmth that it gives; it is also somewhat nutritious, containing as it does the nitrogenous juices of the meat, some salts, and the very important flavors. Beef-tea should be prepared in such a man- ner that the juices are held in solution in the water, not coagulated, to secure which the cooking tempera- ture should never be allowed to exceed that of 1G0Â° Fahr.

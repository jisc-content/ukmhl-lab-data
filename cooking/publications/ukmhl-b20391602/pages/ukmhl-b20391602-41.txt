EXPLANATORY LESSONS 27 penetrate it; sometimes it is not digested at all; while that which is properly done—cooked in such a way that it is tender and falls apart easily—is one of the most valuable forms of food for the sick. Albumen should always be prepared in such man- ner as to require the least possible expenditure of force in digestion. Those who are ill cannot afford to waste energy. Whether they are forced to do so in the digestion of their food depends very much upon the person who prepares it. Advantage is often taken, in cooking, of the fact that albumen hardens on exposure to certain degrees of heat, to form protecting layers over pieces of broil- ing steak, roast meats, etc. If a piece of meat is placed in cold water to cook, it is evident, since albu- men is soluble in cold water, that some of it will be wasted. If the same piece is plunged into boiling water the albumen in its outer layers will be immedi- ately hardened, and form a sheath over the whole which will keep in the juices and the very important flavors. When broth or soup is made, we put the meat (cut into small pieces to expose a large extent of surface) into cold water, because we wish to draw out as much as possible the soluble matter and the flavors. If, on the other hand, the meat is to be served boiled, and broth or soup is not the object, then this ' order should be reversed, and every effort made to pre- vent the escape of any of the ingredients of the meat into the liquid. In broiling steak, we sacrifice a thin layer of the outside to form a protecting covering over the whole by plunging it into the hottest part of the fire, so that the albumen will become suddenly hard and firm, and plug up the pores, thus preventing the savory juices from oozing out. More will be said on this subject in the recipes for cooking these kinds of foods.

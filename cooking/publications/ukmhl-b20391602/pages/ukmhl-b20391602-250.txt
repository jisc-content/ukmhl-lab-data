The advantage of using these over everything else yet tried is, that they do not unite when brought in con- tact except in the presence of water and a certain degree of heat. Rochelle salts, taken in such minute quantities as it occurs in bread made in this way, is not harmful. Cream of tartar bread, if perfectly made, is a whole- some and nutritious bread; none of the constituents of the flour are lost, as when yeast is used.1 The difficulty of obtaining good cream of tartar is very great. It is said to be more extensively adulter- ated than any other substance used for food. More- over, in the practice of bread-making the cream of tartar and soda are generally mixed in the propor- tion of two to one—that is, two teaspoons of cream of tartar to every teaspoon of soda; but this is not the exact proportion in which they neutralize each other, so that under ordinary circumstances there is an ex- cess of soda in the bread. To be exact they should always be combined by weight, as is done in making baking-powders, the pro- portion being 84 parts of soda to 188 of cream of tartar, or, reducing to lower terms, as 21 to 47—a little less than half as much soda as cream of tartar. For practical use in cooking scales are seldom or very rarely employed for the purpose of weighing these materials, but the proportions are roughly approxi- mated with teaspoons, and a fairly accurate result for bread-making may be obtained most easily by mea- suring a teaspoon of each in exactly the same manner, and then taking off a little from the soda. 1 A portion of tlic starch and sugar is consumed to feed the growing yeast. It has been estimated tbat about J of a barrel of flour is lost in raising bread — that is, that amount is consumed by the yeast used.

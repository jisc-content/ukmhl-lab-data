EXPLANATORY LESSONS 50 Digestive Fluids. The digestive fluids are true secre- tions. Each is formed from the blood by a special gland for the purpose whose function it is to make them; they do not exist in the blood as such. Their flow is intermittent, taking place only when they are needed. The liver, however, is an exception to all the others. It is both secretory and excretory, and bile is formed all the time, but is most abundant during digestion.1 Saliva. The fluid which is mixed with the food in the mouth is secreted by a considerable number and variety of glands, the principal of which are the pa- rotid, submaxillary, and sublingual. Smaller glands in the roof and sides of the mouth, in the tongue, and in the mucous membrane of the pharynx contribute to the production of saliva, the digestive fluid of the mouth. The flow from the parotid gland is great- est. The flow from all the glands is greatly increased when food is taken, especially if it be of good flavor. Sometimes the amount is increased by smell alone, as when a nice steak is cooking, or a savory soup, and sometimes the saliva is made copious by thought, as when we remember the taste of dishes eaten in the past, and we say, " It makes the mouth water just to think of them." Amount of Saliva. According to Dalton the amount of saliva secreted every twenty-four hours is 42Â£ oz. Its reaction is almost constantly alkaline. It is com- posed of water, organic matter, and various mineral salts. Ptyalin is its active principle, and is called by some authors animal diastase, or starch converter. Gastric Juice. Gastric juice is the digestive fluid of the stomach. It is acid. Its flow is intermittent, oc- curring only at times of digestion. Its active prin- ciples are pepsin and rennin. It is worthy of notice here that the character of the 1 The liver produces bile and elaborates and stores glycogen.

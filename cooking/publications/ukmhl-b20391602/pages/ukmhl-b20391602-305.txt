Later it is doubtless a valuable addition to the regu- lar daily food of the child. Malted milk is made from selected grain and des- iccated or dried milk. To prepare it for the infant it needs only the addition of water. It is probably one of the best substitutes for milk, but should not be used for any length of time when it is possible to get good milk. The starch of grains may be converted into dex- trine and glucose by the action of heat as well as by the action of diastase, so that when flour is subjected to a certain temperature, and for a certain time, this change is produced. Nestle's food, Imperial Granum, Ridge's food, and some others are made very carefully from selected

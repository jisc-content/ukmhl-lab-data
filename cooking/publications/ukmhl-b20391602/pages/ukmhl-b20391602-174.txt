RECIPES 160 Lay them on that part of the omelet which is to be the lower half, and fold; or the tomato may be tucked into the omelet after folding. OMELET WITH PARSLEY Wash some parsley. Break off the stems and roll the rest into a little ball; then, holding it firmly in the left hand, cut slices from it, or chop it on a board. Stir it into the omelet mixture before it is cooked, in the proportion of one teaspoon for each egg. SPANISH OMELET To an omelet mixture add two drops of onion-juice for each egg, or half a teaspoon of very finely minced onion. ORANGE OMELET "The thinly grated rind of one orange and three tablespoons of the juice, three eggs, and three tea- spoons of powdered sugar. Beat the yolks, add the sugar, rind, and juice, fold in the beaten whites, and cook. Fold, turn out, sprinkle thickly with powdered sugar, and score in diagonal lines with a clean red- hot poker. The burnt sugar gives to the omelet a delicious flavor. " This is a convenient dessert for an emergency, and may be prepared in ten minutes if one has the oranges." (From Mrs. D. A. Lincoln's "Boston Cook Book.")

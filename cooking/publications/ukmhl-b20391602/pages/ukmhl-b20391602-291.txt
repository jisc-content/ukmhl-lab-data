SERVING 277 roauve or green. Water-ices, which usually have color of their own, may be served in dishes to match it. Raspberry or strawberry ice is lovely in dull rich red; apricot ice in yellow—that is, a certain shade of ecru which harmonises with the color of the fruit — and pineapple and lemon ice in Dresden ware are very pretty. Eggs should be opened into a hot, though not very hot, egg-glass. It is the proper thing to do so even when a patient is well enough to open them for him- self, for, although the supply may have been obtained from the very best sources, there is always the risk that some of the eggs may be old, too old to be good.1 Oysters in the half-shell are served simply with salt, pepper, and lemon-juice, or horse-radish. A quarter or a half of a lemon is placed on the oyster-plate with the oysters, and after the salt and pepper are sprinkled on a few drops of lemon-juice are squeezed over each oyster, or a bit of horse-radish is placed on each. Broiled oysters may be served with a sauce of melted butter, seasoned with salt, pepper, and lemon- juice or vinegar. Toast is particularly acceptable with nearly all kinds of cooked oysters, and fancy shapes, such as tiny rounds, squares, and points, are excellent with stews, soups, and roasts, instead of crackers. Dry toast ought to be eaten directly off the toaster, and, except in serious illness, butter may be given with it. Orange, gooseberry, raspberry, and other marmalades, currant, apple, and grape jellies, and baked sweet apples or apple-sauce, are excellent with either dry or water toast. Cooked apples in any form are delicious with milk and cream toasts. i In England it is the custom to servo eggs in the shell, and it is considered bad form to open them, hut in America the latter way is geuoral; for an invalid there is no question but that it is the most convenient way to do. 19

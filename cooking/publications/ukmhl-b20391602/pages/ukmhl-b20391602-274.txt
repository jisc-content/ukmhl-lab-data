DIET LISTS OR MENUS FOE THE SICK CONVALESCENT'S DIET Convalescent's diet includes the liquid and light diets, and, in addition, all easily digested and nutri- tious food. For meats, game, especially venison and birds, beef, mutton, and chicken may be given, but never either pork or veal. They are difficult of di- gestion. Eggs in all ways, soft-cooked, scrambled, poached, and as omelets, well-baked potatoes, creamed potatoes, celery, snow pudding, cream of rice pudding, and tapioca cream, jellies, both those made from gela- tine and fruits, Graham bread, Graham gems, rusk, and, in fact, any well-made bread, and good cake. A convalescent may use for drinks plenty of good milk, cocoa, carefully made tea and coffee, occasion- ally good wine, and the different mineral and drink- ing waters. Some foods to be avoided are pastry, dark or badly made cakes, pork, veal, any highly sea- soned meat dish made with gravy, all kinds of fried food, sausages, heavy puddings, badly made bread, lobsters and crabs.

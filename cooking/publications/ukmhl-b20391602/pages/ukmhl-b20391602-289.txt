275 SERVING little is often a challenge, especially to one of delicate appetite; a large quantity is always vulgar. It is much better to carry a second, portion to one who needs it than to offer too much at first. No exact and definite directions can be given for the serving of special dishes, for a nurse's resources in the way of china, etc., are so uncertain; but a few hints in regard to some principles that, no matter what the circumstances are, never change may be found of service. For instance, water, lemonade, milk, milk-punch, and all other cold drinks are most healthful when cool, not ice-cold. Ice-cold water, ice-cold milk, and all chilled drinks are always forbidden for both sick and well, except in fevers, in extremely hot weather, and in unusual cases, when only a few spoons of liquid are taken. Even in these cases it is a question whether cool liquids would not do as well. We all know the danger of taking a large quantity of ice- cold drink when overheated. Even death has re- sulted from it. Serve tea, coffee, cocoa, bouillon, broth, gruel, and all hot drinks in cups which are liot, not lukewarm. Soup as a part of a meal should be served in a cov- ered silver dish when practicable, for silver may be made very hot, and no other is so pretty/ In lieu of silver use a covered china dish, or a bouillon-cup made hot in an oven beforehand. Remember that the warmth of all these foods is one of their valuable qualities. Beef-juice and beef-tea may be offered in a red wine-glass, to conceal the color, which is sometimes at first unpleasant to those unaccustomed to the use of rare beef; but the taste of these is so acceptable and savory that, after taking a few spoons, the objec- tion vanishes.

288 THE FEEDING OP CHILDEEN washed immediately after using, it is easy to make them perfectly clean; but when this is impracticable they should be put to soak in cold water, then washed with hot soap-suds, and last boiled for ten minutes in clear water. If flecks dry on the inside, put a tea- spoon of rice, or coarse salt, into the bottle with a lit- tle water, and shake well until all is removed. Never use shot: it might cause lead poisoning. Plain rubber nipples alone should be used, never the tube attachment. The nipples should be washed clean and dried after each nursing. Before again using the nipple it should be put into boiling water for ten minutes, and only the rim of it should be touched in handling. The nipple should never be put into the mouth of another person to test the milk. Condensed Milk. "When a large percentage of the water of milk is evaporated, and sugar added, a thick syrup is formed, known as condensed milk. It is made extensively in Switzerland and America. When sealed air-tight in cans it will keep indefinitely. Its average composition—a mean of 41 analyses by Prof. Leeds—is as follows: Water 30.34%" Pat 12.10% Milk-sugar 16.62% Cane-sugar 22.26% Albuminoids 16.07% Ash 2.61% Total, 100.00 porature gives the best results for milk to be used within twenty-four hours. If the milk has to be kept a longer time, a higher temperature is necessary, as only the bacteria and not the spores are destroyed by 175° Fahr. Machines are infuse in France which will heat great quantities of milk to about 155° Fahr. and then rapidly cool it. Not all, but nearly all, forme of bacteria likely to be found in milk are destroyed at the tem- perature of 155°, and the good flavor of the milk is not injured. Such milk is known as Pasteurized milk.

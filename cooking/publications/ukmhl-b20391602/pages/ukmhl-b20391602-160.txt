Oysters are found in greatest perfection in the Eastern States, and in the cooler waters of the west- ern Atlantic. The choicest varieties in the world come from the shores of Long Island, and from the Providence River. Chesapeake Bay is noted for the abundance of its oysters. Oysters are in season from September to May; dur- ing the rest of the year they are insipid and unfit for food, although they are sometimes used. Convalescents often begin with fresh, sound oys- ters, before they venture to try other kinds of solid animal food. Oysters may be used in a variety of ways, but served raw and broiled slightly in the shells are per- haps the two most desirable ways with which to begin. Afterward stews and soups are recommended on account of their liquid form and warmth, warm foods being, always so much more desirable than cold. There are some points to be carefully observed in preparing oysters for the sick. (1) Make every effort to have the oysters alive when used. If this is im- possible, buy salt-water oysters as fresh as they can be obtained of a reliable dealer. Many serious cases of illness, and even death, have been caused by eating oysters so long dead that poisonous substances had formed in them. (2) Remember that oysters contain an albuminous juice which increases in hardness with an increase of temperature, just as the albumen of an egg does. When oysters are cooked with reference to this juice alone, they are also cooked in the best possible manner with reference to their other ingre- dients; therefore subject them to a low temperature, and for a short time, bearing in mind that 100Â° Fahr. is the cooking temperature of albumen.

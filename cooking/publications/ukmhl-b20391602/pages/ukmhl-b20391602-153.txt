139 RECIPES QUEEN VICTORIA'S FAVORITE SOUP 1 Cup of chopped chicken meat. 1 Pint of strong chicken broth. 1 Pint of sweet cream. \ Cup of cracker- or bread-crumbs. 3 Yolks of eggs. 1 Teaspoon of salt. \ Saltspoon of pepper. The chicken may be obtained from what remains of a roast, in which case the bones, skin, tendons, and all the scraps left should be boiled for the broth. It is better, however, to use a fowl which has been cooked on purpose, as the broth from such a one is of finer flavor. Soak the cracker-crumbs in a little of the cream. Break three eggs, separate the whites from the yolks, and carefully drop the yolks into hot water; boil them until they are hard. Chop the chicken in a choppiog-tray until it is as fine as meal, previously having removed everything except the clear meat; mix the soaked cracker with it; press the hard egg- yolks through a coarse wire strainer and put them in, and also the salt, pepper, and broth. Then strain the whole through a colander, adding the cream a little at a time, and pressing through all of the meat. Boil it for five minutes in a saucepan, or cook it in a double boiler for half an hour. This makes a deli- cious soup. CHICKEN-TAPIOCA SOUP 2 Tablespoons of tapioca.

282 THE FEEDING OF CHILDREN jars. There are farmers who do this. Each jar is sealed, marked with the owner's name and address, and the date of sending. Such milk does not become contaminated with bad air in transit, cannot be tam- pered with by middlemen, and must be free from dirt, as it would show through the glass; each cus- tomer gets exactly a quart, with all the cream that belongs to it; moreover, the owner, having attached his name, has thus put his reputation at stake, and is not likely to sell inferior milk. When this is not practicable, search for the best and cleanest dairy, and see that the milk is delivered as soon as possible after being received at the dairy. Milk should not be bought from small stores. The best milk comes from cows that have good pasturage, with clean running water, and that are fed in winter on dry fodder and grain, and not on en- silage and brewery waste. According to the reports of the American Public Health Association, one fifth of all the deaths among infants may be traced to the milk supply, and there is no doubt that most of the sickness of bottle-fed children, during the summer months, is directly due to the unhealthy condition of their food. It then becomes the imperative duty of every mother, nurse, or other person who has the care of children, to learn, if she does not already know, the simpler tests for milk, and something of the philosophy of the feed- ing of her charge.1 When such knowledge is more general, and women are able to determine intelligently the quality of the milk which is offered them, then will milk-dealers be forced to cease mixing, adulter- ating, and otherwise tampering with the milk, which, as a general thing, is sold at the farms in excellent condition. i Test for reaction, fat, and specific gravity.

30 EXPLANATORY LESSONS sure diminishes aad is constantly variable, according to the height above the sea-level. If we ascend into the air at 5000 feet, it is perfectly evident that the pressure from above has been greatly reduced from that at the point from which we started. This dimi- nution of pressure is often measured by the temper- ature at which water boils at different heights. Composition. An average composition of the at- mosphere has been previously stated. Besides nitro- gen and oxygen, it always contains water in the form of vapor, and carbonic acid. The amount of aqueous vapor in the air changes according to the tempera- ture ; the amount of carbonic acid is also constantly variable. Air usually contains, in addition to these, traces of ammonia, organic matter which includes micro-organisms, ozone, salts of sodium, and other mineral matters in minute and variable quantities. Air in Motion. The atmosphere is almost always in motion. We feel it in the gentle breeze and the more forcible wind. If it moves at a slower rate than two and one half feet a second this motion is not notice- able. Motion in the air is caused by the unequal heat- ing of portions of it. If from any cause the atmosphere over a certain region becomes warm, it will expand (all bodies expand with heat), become lighter, and its tendency will be to move in the direction of least re- sistance,â€”that is, upward; so we say heated air rises. Currents of cooler air will immediately flow in to take its place, and thus we have a breeze, a wind, or a gale, according to the velocity and force with which the currents move. It is upon a knowledge of these movements that the theory of ventilation is based. It is because of the constant motion of air-currents that out of doors, except in densely populated cities, air remains constantly pure. When poisonous gases and other impurities accumulate, winds scatter them

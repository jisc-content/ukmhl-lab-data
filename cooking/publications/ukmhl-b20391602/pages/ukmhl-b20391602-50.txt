30 EXPLANATORY LESSONS Sugar. There are many kinds of sugar, the most familiar of which is cane-sugar, or sucrose (C^H^On). It is obtained from the juices of various plants, for instance, sugar-cane, beet-root, the sugar-maple, and certain kinds of palms. By far the greatest amount comes from the sugar-cane. It is made by crushing the stalks of the plant (which somewhat resembles Indian corn) and extracting the sweet juice, which is then clarified and evaporated until, on cooling, crys- tals appear in a thick liquid; this liquid is molasses, and the grains or crystals are brown sugar. "White sugar is obtained by melting this brown sugar in water, removing the impurities, and again evapo- rating in vacuum-pans, which are used for the pur- pose of boiling the liquid at a lower temperature than it could be boiled in the open air, thus avoiding the danger of burning, and otherwise preserving certain qualities of the sugar. Loaf-sugar is made by sepa- rating the crystals from the liquid by draining in molds; and granulated sugar by forcing out the syrup in a centrifugal machine. The process of mak- ing beet-root sugar is similar. Sugar from maple sap is obtained by simply evaporating away the excess of water. In the East a considerable quantity of sugar is made from the juices of certain varieties of palm, especially the date-palm. Maple-sugar and palm- sugar are generally not purified. Sucrose dissolves readily in water. By allowing such a solution to stand undisturbed for a time until the water has disappeared, transparent crystals are obtained, known as rock candy. Again, sucrose melted at a temperature of 320° Fahr. forms, on cooling, a clear mass, called barley-sugar. Heated to 420° Fahr. dissociation of the carbon from the water of crystalli- zation takes place, the carbon appearing in its charac- teristic black color. This dark brown, sweetish-bitter

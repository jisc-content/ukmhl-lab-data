64 EXPLANATORY LESSONS proved that it is from proteids, and not from fats. Carnivorous animals, living upon flesh alone, are found to have glycogen in their bodies.) It is impossible to assign any especial office to the different food principles; that is, it cannot be said that the carbohydrates perform a certain kind of work in the body and nothing else, or that the pro- teids or fats do. The human body is a highly com- plex and intricate organism, and its maintenance is carried on by complex and mysterious processes that cannot be followed, except imperfectly; consequently, we must regard the uses of foods in the body as more or less involved in obscurity. It is, however, generally understood that the proteids, fats, and car- bohydrates each do an individual work of their own better than either of the others can do it. They are all necessary in due amount to the nutiition of the body, and doubtless work together as well as in their separate functions. They are, however, sometimes in- terchangeable, as, for instance, in the absence of the carbohydrates, proteids will do their work. The car- bohydrates are eminently heat and energy formers, and they also act as albumen sparers. The body always has a store of material laid by for future use. If it were not for this a person deprived of food would die immediately, as is the case when he is deprived of oxygen. (Air being ever about us, and obtainable without effort or price, there is no need for the body to lay by an amount of oxygen; consequently only a very little is stored, and that in the blood.) The great reserve forces of the body are in the form of fatty tissues, and glycogen, or the stored-away car- bohydrates of the liver; the latter is given out to the body as it is needed during the intervals of eating to supply material for the heat and energy of daily con- sumption, and in case of starvation. That they are

SERVING 274 vegetables, fish, beef, and mutton should be used, as well as milk, eggs, chicken, and toast. Ease in serving the sick is an accomplishment in a nurse, and a certain amount of seeming indifference is an advisable quality to cultivate. It is a good plan to take every possible care in preparing a meal for a sick person, and then to appear not to notice whether he eats; for sometimes sensitive people, in their desire not to disappoint, or in their endeavors to please, will eat when they do not care for food. Endeavor to remember individual tastes, and try to gratify them; always do so when it is in your power, for these individual preferences are often true instincts of the individual nature striving to secure that which is best for it.

If a patient is very ill, the rule is to administer nourish- ment in small quantities and often. Sometimes a patient is too feeble to help himself to food, and then he must be fed by the nurse. When such is the case, she should be extremely careful, no matter what the pressure of other work may be, not to hurry him.

The quantity of food given will always depend upon the condition of the person, and will conse- quently vary for each individual. Give rather too little than too much, with, of course, the understand- ing that there is always an abundance to be had. A

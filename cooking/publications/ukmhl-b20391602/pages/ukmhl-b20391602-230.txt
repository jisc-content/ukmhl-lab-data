POTATO SALAD WITH OLIVES Make a potato salad according to the foregoing rule, except substitute chopped olives for the beets, in the proportion of one eighth olives by measure to seven eighths potato. CELERY SALAD " One of the finest salads to be eaten, either alone or with game, especially partridges or wild duck, is a mixture of celery, beet-root, and corn-salad. "Water- cresses will make a poor substitute when broken into small tufts. " The beets are cut into slices one sixteenth of an inch thick; the celery, which must be young and tender and thoroughly white, should be cut into pieces an inch long, and then sliced lengthwise into two or three pieces. (N. B.â€” Select only the tender inside branches of celery.) This salad will require plenty of oil, and more acid than a lettuce salad, because of the sweetness and absorbent nature of the beet-root. The general seasoning, too, must be rather high, because the flavors of the celery and the beet are pronounced." (" Delicate Feasting," by Theo- dore Child.) There are many kinds of salads, but they are all based upon the principles stated in these rules. Green herbs or vegetables treated with French or mayon- naise dressing, either by themselves or with meats, form the foundations of all salads.

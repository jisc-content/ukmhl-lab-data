30 EXPLANATORY LESSONS as sour acids do, that is, they unite with them. The glycerin of commerce is obtained by decomposing fats. Fat in Milk. The white color of milk is given to it by minute globules of fat suspended in it. To prove this: Put a little milk into a bottle with a ground-glass stopper; pour upon it three times its hulk of ether and shake gently; let it stand for two or three days, when it will be found that the ether has dissolved the fat and left a semi-transparent yellowish white liquid resem- bling blood serum. By pipetting or carefully pouring off the ether, and evaporating it by placing the vessel containing it in a dish of warm water, clear oil will be obtained. Care must be taken not to put the ether near a flame or the fire, as it is highly inflammable, and an explosion might occur. Ether boils at 94.82Â° Fahr. The proportion of fat in milk is from 2.8 to 8 per cent. It varies in milk from different species of cows, and from the same species at different times, according to age, feeding, and other circumstances. Cream. When milk is allowed to stand without disturbance for a time the globules of fat, being lighter than water, rise to the surface and form cream. Cream is one of the most wholesome, palatable, and easily digested of fats. Butter is obtained by beating milk or cream in a churn until the little globules of fat break and stick together in a mass. Olive-Oil. Olive-oil is one of the most easily di- gested and palatable of fats. A genuine oil of the first quality is, in this country unfortunately, expen- sive, much of that sold under the name being adul- terated with cotton-seed oil, poppy-oil, and essence of lard.1 i The decline in the sardine trade during the last few years is accomi tod for by the fact that cotton-seed oil has so largely replaced olive-oil in the packing of these fish. People who onco regarded them as a great delicacy no longer find thorn satisfying.

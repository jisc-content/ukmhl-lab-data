56 EXPLANATORY LESSONS hundreds of changes take place in the body, in its va- rious nutritive functions, of which nothing is known, or they are entirely iinsuspected, so that if we do our utmost with the present lights which we possess for guidance to health, we shall still fall far short of completeness. The subject of food and nutrition, viewed in the light of bacteriology and chemistry, is one of the most inviting subjects of study of the day, and is worthy of the wisest thought of the nation. The body creates nothing of itself, either of ma- terial or of energy; all must come to it from without. Every atom of carbon, hydrogen, phosphorus, or other elements, every molecule of protein, carbo- hydrate, or other compounds of these elements, is brought to the body with the food and drink it con- sumes, and the air it breathes. Like the steam- engine, it uses the material supplied to it. Its chemical compounds and energy are the compounds and energy of the food transformed (Atwater). A proof of this is seen in the fact that when the supply from without is cut off, the body dies. The raw material which the body uses is the air and food which it consumes, the greater portion of which is digested and distributed, through the medium of the blood, to all parts of the body, to renew and nourish the various tissues and to supply the material for the different activities of life. Ways in which Food Supplies the Wants of the Body. Food supplies the wants of the body in several ways— (1) it is used to form the tissues of the body — bones, flesh, tendons, skin, and nerves; (2) it is used to re- pair the waste of the tissues; (3) it is stored in the body for future use; (4) it is consumed as fuel to maintain the constant temperature which the body must always possess to be in a state of health; (5) it produces muscular and nervous energy.1 The 1 Prof. Atwater, in " The Century Magazine," 1887-88.

199 RECIPES VELVET CREAM ^ Box of gelatine. \ Cup of cold water. \ Cup of sherry wine. 1 Teaspoon of lemon-juice. £ Cup of sugar. 1£ Cups of sweet cream, or \\ Cups of creamy milk. Soak the gelatine in the cold water in a bowl for half an hour; then pour in the wine, and set the bowl in a dish of boiling water on the fire. When the gelatine is dissolved, put in the lemon-juice and sugar, stir for a minute to dissolve the sugar, and then strain it through a fine wire strainer into a gran- ite or other metal pan. Set the pan in a dish of ice and water to cool. As soon as it begins to thicken, or is about the consistency of molasses on a warm day, turn in the cream and stir regularly and con- stantly until it begins to thicken. Before it is quite as hard as it will become, turn it into a glass or pretty china dish, in which it may be served, and set it away in the refrigerator or back in the dish of ice and water until perfectly firm. Serve it in small glass or china dishes, with sweet cream poured over. This cream should be of a perfectly smooth, even consis- tency, hence the name " velvet cream."

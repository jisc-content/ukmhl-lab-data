WATER BREAD 1 Pint of boiling water. 1 Tablespoon of sugar. 1 Teaspoon of salt. 1 Tablespoon of butter. Cup of liquid yeast, or \ of a two-cent cake of compressed yeast. Enough sifted flour to make a stiff dough. Put the sugar, salt, and butter with the boiling water into a mixing-bowl or bread-pan. Stir until the sugar is dissolved and the water lukewarm, then add the yeast (if compressed, it should be softened in a little water). Last, stir in the flour until a dough stiff enough to mold easily is made. Mold it for a minute or two to give it shape and to more thoroughly mix the ingredients, and then set it to rise in a room warm enough to be comfortable to live in—that is, having a temperature of 70° Fahr. It should remain in this temperature for eight hours. Cover it closely, that the top may not dry. It is often convenient to let bread rise over night. There is no objection to this, pi'ovided the bread is mixed late in the evening, and baked early the next morning. Care must be taken, however, that the room in which it is left is warm enough to insure ris- ing in the time given. On the other haud, if allowed to rise too long, or at too high a temperature, the fer- mentation is carried so far that an acid is produced, and the dough becomes sour.

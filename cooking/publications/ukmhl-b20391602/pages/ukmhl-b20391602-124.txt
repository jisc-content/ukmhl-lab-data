TEA Tea has refreshing and invigorating properties very comforting to one spent with toil. Its active prin- ciple is theine, a crystalline alkaloid found in both tea and coffee. Theine and caffeine were once sup- posed to be different substances, but have recently been found to be identical. Tea is a valuable article of diet, though not a direct mttrient. It is classed with the so-called "ac- cessory" foods, and, although not itself nutritious, aids, by its good flavor and stimulating properties, the digestion of other things. It is a nerve tonic, and is quite valuable as a curative agent for headache and some forms of indigestion. The slight stimulation resulting from its use is unattended by any after ill effects, unless it be taken in excessive quantities. It is good for soldiers, hard-working people, travel- ers, and others who are much exposed to the rigors of climate.1 i George Kennan, in his accounts of liis perilous journeyings through Siberia, bears ample testimony to the comforting effects of hot tea. Often when he anil his companion were chilled through, and almost dead with cold and fatigue, after mnny hours' travel over the frozen snows, they were revived by draughts of hot tea provided at the stations.

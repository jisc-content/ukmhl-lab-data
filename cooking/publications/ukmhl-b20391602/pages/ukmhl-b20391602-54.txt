40 EXPLANATORY LESSONS far and wide until they are so diluted as to be harm- less; or under some conditions they unite with other things and form new and simple substances of a harmless nature, while under others, if they are com- pounds, they may be decomposed or washed down to the surface of the earth again. Impurities. The chief chemical product of fires and of that slower combustion breathing is carbonic acid. Plants during the day, and under the influence of sunlight, take it up from the air for food, use the car- bon for their growth, thus freeing oxygen which man and the lower animals need. Thus is the balance most beautifully maintained. Plants use some oxygen. Air is purest over the sea and over wind-swept heights of land. It, however, always contains some foreign substances, and always inicro-organisms ex- cept over mid-ocean. Even quite high strata of atmosphere are not free from microscopic forms of life, as has been shown in experiments made with hail at the Johns Hopkins Hospital in 1890 by Dr. Abbott. Large hailstones were washed in distilled and steril- ized water, and then melted, and cultures made from different layers; in all of these organisms were found, showing that they extend into the air a long dis- tance from the earth.1 Impurities of various kinds are constantly passing into the air, but so vast is the expanse of the atmo- sphere as compared with the impurities daily thrown into it from the lungs of man and the lower animals, from fires, manufactories, and decomposing matter, that they quickly disappear. Air is the greatest or, as one writer says, the most immediate necessity of Hfe. We could live without i This is not the first instance of tlio discovery of organisms in hail; but Dr. Abbott, if not the first, is one of the first bacteriologists to dem- onstrate the fact in this country.

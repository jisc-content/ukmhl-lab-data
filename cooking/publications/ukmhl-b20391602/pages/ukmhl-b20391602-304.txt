290 THE FEEDING OF CHILDREN those made according to the Liebig process. The starch of the grain from which such foods are pre- pared is, in the process of manufacture, changed into soluble dextrine, or sugar (glucose), by the action of the diastase of malt: the very thing which an infant cannot do. When we consider that the digestion of starch in the alimentary canal consists of this change into glucose, and that it is effected principally by the saliva and the pancreatic juice, the significance of the value of such foods will be seen. It is also well to bear in mind that neither of these functions (the secretion of saliva and pancreatic juice) is developed in an infant until it enters the third month of its life, and then but verj^ imperfectly. That alone shows the necessity of excluding all starch from its food up to that age. Mellin's food and malted milk are prepared accord- ing to the Liebig process. In them the starch has been converted into soluble matter by the action of the ferment of malt. It is really a partial prediges- tion. Mellin's food does not contain milk. The following analysis of Mellin's food is one made by Professor Fresenius, of Wiesbaden, Germany: Non-nitrogenous substances soluble in water 69.38% Non-nitrogenous substances insoluble in water . ... 3.18% Total carbohydrates 72.56% Nitrogenous substances soluble in water 4.69%" Nitrogenous substances insoluble in water 5.06% Total albuminoids. 9.75% Total salts, mostly phosphoric acid, car- bonic acid, and potassa 4.37% Total moisture 13.32% Cane sugar, none. Reaction, alkaline.

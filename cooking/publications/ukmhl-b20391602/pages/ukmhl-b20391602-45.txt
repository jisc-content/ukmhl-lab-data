31 EXPLANATORY LESSONS Cotton-seed oil has no especially bad flavor, but it is unpleasant and indigestible when used raw as in sardines and salads. Its indigestible qualities are doubtless due to the presence of an aldehyde. Olive-oil of the best quality is almost absolutely without flavor. It is prepared in several grades: the first pressing from the fruit is the best, the second is fair, the third inferior, and there is sometimes a fourth known as refuse oil. For deep fat frying nothing is so good as olive-oil, but its costliness in this country excludes it from common use. The fat of the sheep and ox, after it has been ren- dered, and deprived of all membrane and fibers, is called tallow. The term is also applied to the fat of other animals, and to that of some plants, as bayberry- tallow, piny tallow, and others. The uncooked fat of any animal is called suet, but the name has come to be applied to the less easily melted kinds, which sur- round the kidneys or are in other parts of the loin. The fat which falls in drops from meat in roasting is called dripping. THE CARBOHYDRATES Starch. Starch is a substance found in wheat, corn, oats, and in fact in all grains, in potatoes, in the roots and stems of many plants, and in some fruits. In a pure state it is a white powder such as is seen in arrowroot and corn-starch. Examined by a micro- scope this powder is found to be made up of tiny grains of different shapes and sizes, some rounded or oval, others irregular. Those of potato-starch are ovoid, with an outside covering which appears to be folded or ridged, and looks somewhat like the outside of an oyster-shell, although its similarity extends no further

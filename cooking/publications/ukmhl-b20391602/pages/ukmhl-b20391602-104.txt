00 MUSH AND PORRIDGE Mush is meal or grain cooked in water to the con- sistency of rather thin pudding. Porridge is like mush, only thinner. The most important point con- nected with the preparation of these is thoroughness â–  in the cooking. Made as they generally are of coarsely ground or of rolled grains, they need long boiling to soften the cellulose and to cook the starch properly. Oatmeal. Oatmeal should be cooked for at least three hours in a double boiler. It is at its best pre- pared the day before it is needed, and then reheated as it is wanted. If it is done in this way, the flavor is fine, and there is no danger that the grains will be hard. When taken from the kettle, the oatmeal should be of the consistency to pour, and on cooling it ought to form into a tender, jelly-like pudding. Sometimes oatmeal is cooked so that the grains are whole and separate, but it is not easily digested so, and lacks the delicious flavor which long cooking gives. Oatmeal for those for whom there is no objection to its use is a valuable nutrient, furnishing more for the money than almost any other food.1 i Composition of oatmeal: Nitrogenous matter 12.6% Carbohydrates, starch, etc 63.8% Fatty matter 5.6% Mineral matter 8.0% Water 16-0% Total 100.00% Letherbt.

276 SERVING Cups and tumblers ought not to be filled to more than within a half inch of the top. The best argu- ment for this custom is, that it is considered good form ; but there is a good reason back of it, as is the case in most other established customs. If a cup be filled to the brim it cannot be moved without spilling the liquid over the outside; this occasions wiping, which it is especially difficult to do, and waste of a certain portion of the contents; then it is not easy to drink from a cup so filled. Fruits, such as oranges, grapes, peaches, and toma- toes, should be served cool, but not cold or chilled. The ideal way to eat fruits is without artificial cool- ing. A peach is never so delicious as at the moment it is gathered from the tree, just ripe, and tomatoes have the finest flavor eaten directly off the vines; but it is seldom that these fruits or others can be so ob- tained, and we, knowing that fruits do not keep well except in cool places, are apt to associate a certain degree of coolness with them. The objection to serv- ing fruits very cold is that, besides the fact that they are not as readily digested so, their delicate flavor is lost, for the cold contracts the sensitive papillae of the tongue, and thus the power of tasting is tempo- rarily deadened. Oranges, peaches, and plums may be used uncooked, as they are extremely easy of digestion so, and also grapes, unless there is objection to the seeds, iu which case they should be cooked, and the seeds strained out. Apples and pears are safer cooked; to- matoes may be eaten either way. Transparent jellies are pretty served in glass dishes, and ice-cream, sherbets, and ices in china saucers, or ice-cream dishes of pink, or other deli- cately warm colors. Ice-cream, uncolored, in shell pink, is much more attractive than it is in cold

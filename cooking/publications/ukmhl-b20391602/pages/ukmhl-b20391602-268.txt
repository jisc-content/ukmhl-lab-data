254 DIET LISTS OR MENUS FOR THE SICK Diet for the sick may be divided into three kinds: Liquid, Light, and Convalescent's or Invalid's Diet. Liquid diet consists entirely of liquids, of which milk is the most valuable. The meat broths (those made with beef, chicken, and mutton), oyster and clam broth, albumen water, eggs in the form of egg- nog, egg cream, and mulled wine, and tea and coffee are excellent. To this list may be added, as the pa- tient shows signs of recovery, soft custards, and jel- lies made with wine, lemon, coffee, or orange-juice, which quickly become liquid when eaten. A patient is given liquid diet during times of severe and dangerous illness. Usually the amount of food and intervals at which it is to be given are prescribed by the physician. The following table may be of assistance to those who are without such aid: LIQUID DIET No. 1 8 A. M. Hot milk f of a cup 10 a. M. Hot coffee with cream and a little sugar i of a cup 12 m.

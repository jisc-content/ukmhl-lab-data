EXPLANATORY LESSONS 37 syrup is called caramel. On cooling it forms a solid, which may be dissolved in water, and is used to color gravies, soups, beer, and so forth. Exp. with Sulphuric Acid. A very pretty experiment to show the separation of the water from the carbon may be made by treating a little sugar in sulphuric acid. Put a tablespoon of sugar in any vessel that will bear heat, a thin glass or stout cup. Pour over enough concentrated sulphuric acid to thorough- ly moisten it, let it stand for a few minutes, when it will be seen that the mass has changed color from white to a yellow- ish brown. The color increases in intensity until it is perfectly black, when the whole puffs and swells up, fumes are driven off, and a mass like a cinder remains. This is charcoal, or nearly pure carbon. The explanation is as follows: So strong is the affinity of the acid for the water that it breaks up the chemical combination between it and the carbon, unites with the water, and leaves the carbon free. So intense is the chemical change that an enormous amount of heat is evolved,â€”so much, in fact, that a considerable part of the water is vaporized, leaving the more or less solid charcoal. The light color no- ticed during the first part of the union indicates that the chemical dissociation is just beginning, and that only a small amount of carbon has been set free. Glucose. Glucose or grape-sugar (C6H12O0) is one of the kinds of sugar found in grapes, peaches, and other fruits. It is about two and one half times less sweet than cane-sugar. It is manufactured on a large scale from the starch of corn. Lactose. Lactose or milk-sugar is the sugar found in the milk of the Mammalia. That of commei-ce comes chiefly from Switzerland, where it is made by evaporating the whey of cow's milk. For sweetening drinks for infants and for the sick, milk-sugar is said to be less liable to produce acid fermentation than cane-sugar, and also to be more easily digested. 4,

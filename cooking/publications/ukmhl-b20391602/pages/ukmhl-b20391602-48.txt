34 EXPLANATORY LESSONS temperature of starch. It should be such a tempera- ture as shall actually couvert it into dextrine, or at least change it to such an extent that it will be more easily converted into dextrine, and ultimately into sugar, by the digestive fluids. This should be as near 401° Fahr. as practicable,— not that a potato, or a loaf of bread, or a pudding will have all the starch in it changed when it is put into an oven of that temperature. It would not be possible, on ac- count of the water contained in each; but that in the outside may be, and the preparation of the remainder will be better than at a lower temperature. There are other means of changing starch into dex- trine than by heat, one of the most remarkable of which is diastase, a substance found in sprouting grains, which has the power to transform the starch stored in the grain by nature into soluble dexti'ine, in which form it can be taken up by the young plant for food. The crude starch could not thus be absorbed. The starch which we use as food is of no more value to us than it is to the young plant until it has been changed into dextrine or sugar. Now, if art outside of the body can accomplish what nature is otherwise forced to do in the alimentary canal, the body will be saved a certain amount of force,—a point of great im- portance, especially in the case of the sick or invalid, who can ill afford to waste energy. Starch constitutes half of bread, our "staff of life"; nearly all of rice, the staff of life in the East; and the greater part of corn-starch, sago, arrowroot, tapioca, peas, beans, turnips, carrots, and potatoes. Arrowroot is the purest form of starch food known. Bice is richest in starch of all the grains. Tapioca is prepared from the root of a tropical plant; it is first crushed and the gi*ains washed out with water, then the whole is heated and stirred, thus cooking and

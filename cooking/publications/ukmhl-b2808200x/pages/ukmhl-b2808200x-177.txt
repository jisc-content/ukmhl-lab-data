CHAPTER VIII. EGGS AND OMELETTES. These are specially useful for luncheon, and for dinner when maigre dishes are required. Some of them are suitable for savouries. At luncheon they are usually served first, as at a foreign dejeuner, but they are sometimes introduced as second-course dishes. This does not, of course, apply to the sweet omelettes. Poached eggs, or (Eufs poches, may be served au jus, with brown gravy, garnished with fillets of anchovy placed crosswise on each egg; or an jambon, on oval slices of fried ham, with Poivrade sauce. So-called “ buttered ” eggs—cooked with butter, etc.—are served as (Eufs brouilles. (Eufs brouilles aux pointes d'aspergcs, aux cham- pignons, aux truffes, or au jambon, are dressed in the same way, with the addition of asparagus cut up, chopped mushrooms, truffles, or ham. brouilles a VIndienne are cooked with butter, chopped onion, curry powder, etc. M

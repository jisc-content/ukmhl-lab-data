Cookery for the Poor. i3S grated cheese in a greased dish, and let cheese be the uppermost layer; put little pieces of dripping here and there upon the top, and brown in the oven. Sen e hot. Lentils or "haricot beans may be soaked and boiled till soft, then eaten either as a vegetable or as a substitute for meat. They are excellent prepared as follows : Haricot Seans.—Boil the haricots till tender, and drain them. Mince a small onion finely, toss it over the fire, and mix the beans with it. Serve hot. Lentils.—Boil the lentils till tendir, and drain them. Melt a slice of dripping in a saucepan, and throw in an onion finely chopped. Stir in a teaspoonful of flour, and add a little of the water in which the lentils were boiled to make a thick sauce, with half a teaspoonful of vinegar if liked. Put in the lentils, and let them simmer softly for a few minutes. Serve hot. I have thus named a few out of the many dishes which might be mentioned, which cost little, and yet are whole- some and nourishing. We must not forget, however, that the poor have frequently to contend with an insurmount- able difficulty in their cookery, and that is scarcity of fuel. How can those who have very little coal, and perhaps no oven into the bargain, prepare their food properly ? It is very easy for us who have every needful appliance and utensil to say what others should do ; yet very likely if we were in the place of these poor creatures we should not do nearly so well as they do. Let us, therefore, while trying to help our poorer brothers and sisters, be very charitable in our judgment of them, and remember who it was who said, “Judge not, that ye be not judged.”

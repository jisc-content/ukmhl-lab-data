136 XXI. HOW TO MAKE TEA AND COFFEE. fEA can be made rightly nowhere but in the British Islands. Perfectly—it can be made in no house but mine, and by no person but myself. This is the opinion held by a great many modern British housewives. They do not express it in so many words, but they hold it most tenaciously. You may tell them that the Chinese and the Russians imagine that they also can make the beverage in question, but the ladies will regard this as a sign of ignorance in the poor deluded foreigners which has been foolishly pandered to by travellers. You may deal out a side stroke, and inform them that though they make tea, they cannot make coffee. This point they will yield, and admit that if those who profess to know speak truly, the French can make coffee better than they; but what is coffee? It is on tea that they stake their reputation ; and they judge of the intel- lectual and moral qualities of every visitor who comes to the house by the extent of his or her appreciation of their children and their tea. If these ladies are made happy—and, above all, if they are led to maintain their present high standard of excellence by this inner consciousness of skill—I cannot say that I see any harm in it. They can make a good cup of tea. There is no doubt of that. I make fun of them here, but I assure you I should not do so if 1 were in their presence. I should accept their tea with gratitude ; and I should be most effusive in my expression of appreciation of it. I should also inquire with profound humility by what process this wondrous result had been attained. As the process was described, I should note carefully whether it differed from my own in any particular. If it did, I should remark to myself, with deep satisfaction, that my friend did not know everything : she had to learn one or two things yet.

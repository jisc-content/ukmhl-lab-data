AUTHOR’S PREFACE. i This book is not simply a collection of cookery recipes, although a number of recipes are to be found in it. It is intended rather to fill the place of a guide or key to Cookery. The object which I have had before me in writing it is to inform those girls who wish to acquire skill in the art of preparing food, concerning the methods to be employed, with the why and the wherefore thereof. I have confined my attention strictly and exclusively to Economical Cookery, for I believe that it is in this direction that improvement is chiefly needed. Those who have accustomed themselves to “fare sumptuously every dayu would perhaps find it to their advantage to think rather less of luxurious living than they now do. It is the every-day food of ordinary people which needs to be chosen more judiciously, cooked more skilfully, and served more invitingly than it now is. If this end could be accomplished the community would doubtless reap the benefit in the improved health, and also, perhaps, in the morale of its members. Phillis Browne.

H 97 FATIGUING THE SALAD herbs, just a few carefully chosen leaves, and her onions are finely minced and put at the bottom of the bowl first of all, and it is gradually filled with the green stuff. Salt and pepper are sprinkled over, then she holds the bottle of oil in one hand, and with a fork lightly turns over the greens, using her judgment as to the precise amount of oil to put in. I trust no one will ever ask me exactly how much oil Charlotte has put into a particular salad, for I could never say. Her salads are never greasy, but each leaf has its due, and shines com- placently. Then, last of all, a spoonful of vinegar is lightly sprinkled on, and the gentle process of “ fatiguing ” the salad commences. This is a pro- cess she enjoys; she will even wax poetical at this time. Her movements with her salad are steady, methodical, gentle to caressing, and when she has done it is a thing that would indeed “ tempt the dying anchorite to eat.”

THE GARDENER AND THE COOK 108 To our thinking, beets are far nieer baked than boiled, and there is less likelihood of their losing their colour by the breaking of the skin when they are cooked in the oven. When quite tender the skin is peeled off and the beets, if large, are cut into quarters and tossed in the saute pan with a little butter and a few drops of vinegar. This is the plainest way of dressing them. For Beetroot d la Creme small globe beets lend themselves better than do larger roots ; after they have been washed they should be baked entire and then skinned, and, still keeping them whole, be left simmering for awhile with a little butter. When they are ready to serve a white sauce is poured round them, and chopped parsley is sprinkled over them. The mild flavour of beets makes a little acidity in the sauce seem desir- able, and a dash of vinegar added at the last improves it.

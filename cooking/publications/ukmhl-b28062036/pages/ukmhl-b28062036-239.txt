223 PLUM CONSERVES For plum jelly the fruit should be taken when only half ripe, and be put into a deep stone jar, or lined pan, just covered with water, and cooked until very soft yet not to make a pulpy mass. Strain the juice twice and allow equal weights of sugar. Another method of making an excellent plum preserve, or I should rather say a conserve, is to place the picked and wiped plums into a stone jar, alternating each layer with one of sugar, and leaving the jar in a corner of the stove all night. Pour off all the liquor and boil it, then pour it over the fruit again, and repeat the process each day four or five days consecutively. The last time both fruit and syrup should be boiled to- gether for a few minutes only, then at once put into jars. We think a spoonful of vinegar added an improvement. Date plums, which come late in the season, make a delicious preserve treated

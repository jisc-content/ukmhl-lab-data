THE GARDENER AND THE COOK 168 snips, and celery are shredded very fine, as if intended for Julienne soup, and are spread out on trays and placed first in the coolest place in the oven, then brought a little nearer to the fire to finish, but never near enough to discolour. They dry quickly and do not lose colour, and an hourâ€™s soaking in cold water previous to using restores both flavour and character. If soaked for any length of time we cook them in the same water, as some of the goodness will have been taken up by it. The secret of keeping the colour of herbs, when drying them, is to dry quickly enough. We spread them out on sheets of paper and put them in a warm oven, leaving the door partly open, and subject them to a fair heat. They should dry in less than an hour and be ready to sift and bottle. Parsley dried in this way keeps a beautiful bright green, but it takes a little longer than most other herbs.

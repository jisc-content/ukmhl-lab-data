THE GARDENER AND THE COOK 182 Sometimes it pleases Charlotte to take a portion of this light dough and to make it softer still with one or two more eggs and to add a little ehopped candied fruit and a glassful of Maderia wine to it, and to beat until she has obtained what is more like a light batter than a paste. This she pours into oiled moulds the size of a cup and bakes rather quickly. The moulds are never more than half filled, but the mixture rises in a crest above the top and does not fall again. These become what French confectioners designate as hahas; the correct mode of serving is to soak them in a syrup flavoured with sweet wine or liquor. We take great pride in having this uncommon con- fection when friends are to be entertained. A Gateau du Riz, wherein eggs and milk are added to boiled rice with sugar and salt, and grated lemon peel for flavouring, is made handsome by decorating the bottom and sides of the mould

THE GARDENER AND THE COOK 86 except a few roots of sprouts, Ave do not often have them on our table. Nevertheless, there are a few occasions when a little cabbage comes in appropri- ately, and the first young earlies are certainly delicious, therefore I tell you Avhat are our modes of treating them. After washing, the half cabbages are thrown into a panful of boiling salted water and left for five minutes. When drained from this, fresh boiling water is poured over them, more salt and a little sugar. They cook, with the lid off the pan, until quite tender, then are drained and pressed and chopped finely and returned to the pan Avith butter, pepper and a sprinkling of salt and a dash of vinegar, to steam throAigh for half an hour. By being pressed into a mould before turning out into a dish the shape is improved, and it is possible to pour a nicely-flavoured broAvn or tomato sauce round the base.

THE GARDENER AND THE COOK 54 brew for every ailment that human flesh is heir to. In winter time, when there is little that I can do outside, and when Charlemagne is busy “ under glass,” Charlotte and I have been happy in the closet where is the porcelain stove and the enam- elled pans. But what we achieve there I must give in another chapter. Harking back to the thought which started me on this digression, if digression it is, I will here describe the cooking utensils which are in use in our own kitchen. As I met with Charlotte on one of our many journeys abroad, fell in love with her and secured her attachment to myself, and her promise that if ever we again set up housekeeping in England she would come to live with us, I knew that it would be but fair to give her such surroundings as might in some measure make up to her for the familiar things she would leave behind.

THE GARDENER AND THE COOK 130 that it seems diffieult to ehoose out of the number. What delieious erusts for vegetable or meat pies can be made with mashed potato properly manipu- lated with egg, what delicate rissoles and cro- quettes wherein mashed potato is used in place of bread-crumbs, and what savoury pies wherein every other layer is one of sliced potato ! Then from remainders of mashed or whipped potato we make such elegant trifles as pommes de terre d la Duchesse. The whip of potato has butter and the yolk of an egg added to it, seasoning and some flavouring, preferably a pinch of sifted herbs. The paste is shaped into small round cakes and coated with more egg and crumbs, or with a batter, and fried to a golden colour in boiling fat. Varia- tions are made by making the flavour that of cheese, and sometimes the tiny cakes have a Proven9al taste because onion has been added to them and they have been fried in oil.

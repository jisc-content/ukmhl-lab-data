201 PINES AND BANANAS Quantities of small pineapples are likely to find their way to us from the Cape, when their worth becomes better known. The South African pine makes little show beside the ordinary hot-house pine, it is true, but the cheap little brown things have a delicious flavour, are very juicy and whole- some, and can be brought over here and sold for a few pence each, or even less. The best way of eating these is to cut a morsel off the bottom to make the fruit stand level on the plate, then to take a piece from the stalk end, and to scoop out the centre with a spoon, precisely as one would eat a cooked egg. Bananas for the table are more tempting to the fastidious appetite when offered ready peeled, and cut into finger-lengths or cubes ; they should have a little sugar and the juice of a fresh lemon or lime squeezed over them. This is the true West Indian method of serving this fruit.

THE GARDENER AND THE COOK 40 few people grow them in England. They keep moist for a long time when hanging in the store- room, and this golden puree, garnished with crisp morsels of fried bread, is a welcome sight on a cold winterâ€™s day. I am as proud of finding all these things in orderly array in the storeroom or cellar as Charlotte is of her shelves filled with conserves and pickles, her wines and cordials, and her bottles of dried and sifted herbs ready for the assaisonnement of her soups and dishes.

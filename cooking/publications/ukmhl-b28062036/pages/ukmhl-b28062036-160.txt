THE GARDENER AND THE COOK 144 onions for a dish, parboil them if you would re- move an excess of pungency. I think I have before stated that we sow a pinch of seed every fortnight during the summer to keep ourselves supplied with tender young “ lilies,” and in winter an occasional new sowing takes place in a frame. A similar sulphurous oil as that which gives such value to the onion is possessed in a smaller degree by horseradish, while the ordinary radish possesses some of the same in still more minute quantity. Both the horseradish and radish are condiments, however, and never in any way come up to the onion in general usefulness, nor yet in health value.

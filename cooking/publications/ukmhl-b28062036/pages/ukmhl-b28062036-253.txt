237 AND SPICED CONDIMENTS VVe are not great eonsumers of piekles, and jjrefer to possess a few ehoiee kinds, sueh as nastur- tium-seed, walnut, mushroom, cherry, and plum, rather than the commoner mixtures and brands. A favourite tomato pickle or chutney I have mentioned before when speaking of tomatoes in another connection. Of all pickles the walnut is perhaps .the one best liked, as it is also the one which gives the most trouble in its preparation; nevertheless, it seems always well worth its cost. The walnuts must be gathered while soft enough to be easily pierced with a darning needle. They should be freely pricked, and then laid in a strong brine for several days, changing the brine once in the interval. Then drain and wipe each one, lay in fresh cold water for half a day, and afterwards spread them out on trays to set in the sunshine, turning frequently until they have become a deep black all over alike.

107 PUMPKIN PIES until by probing with a fork the marrow is found to be tender. From pumpkins, whieh our American relations persist in calling squashes, we make sweet pureeâ€” that is, the pumpkin or marrow stew^ed until tender, and mixed with butter and sugar, and spiced, flavoured with lemon and ginger, and enriched with the yolk of an egg. This makes an excellent filling for tartlets and pastry, the latter having been previously baked and cooled, and after the filling has been put in we pile the whisked white of the egg and more sugar on the top, and return the tart to the oven for a few moments. This is a very favourite sweet. In this connection I might speak of the dishes of beetroot which Charlotte prepares for eating hot. Plain beetroot has its place among our salad vegetables, of course, but there are other modes of utilising this most useful vegetable.

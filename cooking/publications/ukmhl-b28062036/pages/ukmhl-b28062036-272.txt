THE GARDENER AND THE COOK 256 they are maturing a crop, and the advisability of limiting that crop. Our critical friend and neighbour, mentioned at the beginning of this book as the one to whom I am indebted for the transference of Charlemagne, will have it that we are more careful for our trees than we are for the fruit they produce or should produce. But this is a libellous imputation which both Charlemagne and I resent! I must confess, however, that these precious trees, and the appear- ance of this beautiful fruit-house of ours, have kindled within me an affection beyond anything I should ever have thought possible, and I am positive that the Better Half, who has travelled, by degrees, from the position of grudging concessionnaire to that of pfoud proprietor, is every whit as fond ! And as for Charlemagne, this regiment of precise trees is his immaculate body-guard, his crack corps, dear to his heart as delightful to his eyes !

191 BURGLARIOUS BIRDS fruit from the garden, and, in a good season, a moderate supply of ordinary apples and pears from the orchard, and a few choice specimens from the espaliers when the season has been exception- ally fair. Later on, when we came to the point of acquiring a noble fruit house, of which more hereafter, the position of things was, of course, vastly improved. Still, even in the beginning, we had enough, after all, enough for ourselves and for the birdsâ€”and the birds invariably exacted full toll! When currants were ripening, indeed, we found it expedient to net over the bushes with coarse gauze, and we even thought, Charlemagne and I, of making an enclosure by stretching wire netting between poles placed all round the plot, as it is said that birds will not fly down into an enclosed space. So far, however, it has not been done ; every year we threaten them, and there the matter ends.

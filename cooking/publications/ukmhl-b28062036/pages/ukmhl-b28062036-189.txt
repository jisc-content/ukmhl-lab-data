173 MUSHROOM MODES the peelings and stalks of mushrooms (stewing them in butter, not water) we bottle and keep for adding to other stews and sauces. It is most useful. Served independently mushrooms never seem nicer than when cooked in a shallow dish of fire- proof china, with fitting lid. This must be buttered and sprinkled with pepper and salt; just suffi- cient clear bouillon to float them is put in, and sometimes a tiny onion or two, and the dish is covered down and set in the oven to stew gently for half an hour. It is then ready to serve, gar- nished with fried croutons or within a ring of mashed potato. When the mushrooms themselves are the gar- nish to another dish they are invariably browned in butter in the pan over a brisk fire, or the cavities have bits of butter put within them and each is set on the baking tin and baked in the oven.

69 AND THE ^^ALLONGEMENT^^ the sad face of Charlotte when an unexpected guest arrived to dinner one evening, and the nicety of her calculation was upset by the necessity of making sufficient for four what had only been prepared for three. “ Quel dommage,” she mur- mured, “ quel dommage de Tallonger ! —but she proceeded to do it all the same, and to add yet one more egg. The puree that is to be eaten as such must, after being passed and rubbed, be returned to the casserole and receive butter, seasoning herbs, and perchance the yolks of eggs, or a little cream. It is stirred carefully and then is served. If it be served in cases of fried bread or shapes of rice you may make it reasonably rich and soft, if it is to accompany meat then keep it stiff.

Q 225 QUINCES AND APPLES and cooked in a boiling syrup, and the kernels are chopped and thrown in. Quinces, like apjDles, should be quartered and put into the pan with peelings, cores and all, and a pint of water may be added to every five pounds of fruit. When fully cooked, and all the goodness extracted, strain, and treat the liquor as before explained. In the case of apples alone, and when more flavour seems needful, a piece of stick cinnamon and a few cloves should be tied in muslin and boiled with the liquor, but removed before the sugar is added. Highly coloured and tart apples, like the Siberian crab, make the finest jelly. Set the jars in a sunny window for some days if the jelly seems loth to set. It grows firmer in course of time. Wild cherries and currant juice (red) make a delicious preserve, which is good for any weakness of the digestive organs.

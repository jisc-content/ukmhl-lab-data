THE GARDENER AND THE COOK 192 I say it surely would be inconsistent to talk of our enjoyment of the fruits and deny the birds, who, after all, are our fellow-toilers, the right to conjugate the verb with us. To people like Charlotte, who delight in making experiments in the fine art of preserving, good bush-fruit is very valuable, and, moreover, currants and raspberries are so useful for mixing with other and larger fruits. Also we love much in summer- time to have a plate of picked ripe currants set upon the breakfast table. When the bunches are cleansed by dipping in clean water and dried they are beautiful to roll lightly in powdered sugar and eat with bread and butter. We have a few bushes of white currants, a comparatively rare thing to find in an English garden, but one of our nicest dessert fruits. By netting the bush we have managed to keep the currants hanging right on into September, except in a very dry season.

THE GARDENER AND THE COOK 98 There is no sediment left at the bottom of this bowl, no grit, no lurking atoms, no sourness of vinegar, nor does any moisture collect. It is a good salad. A vegetable salad, when mayonnaise is used, is dressed only just before it comes to table, as if left long the mayonnaise is apt to separate and the vegetable to get sodden. After the mayonnaise sauce has been poured over it the garnishing is done, but this takes but a few seconds. Such a salad, of cold potatoes, arranged in circles with rings of tomato, cucumber, and onion, decorated with a sprinkling of finely-minced parsley, looks most appetising. If any difficulty is found in removing the skin of tomatoes, it is helped by dipping them into boiling water for a moment first. Very pretty is a salad of potatoes or other white vegetable garnished with a macedoine of other vegetables nicely varied in colour.

37 AND FINE AROMAS the Better Half be ever offended by an over-dose of the pungent elove. It is but rarely that she proves indisereet. We, on the other hand, are very partial to the delieate aroma of chives, and con- stantly desire her to use the herb ; also we praise her warmly whenever leeks are introduced, and, indeed, we think there are few things nicer than a dish of fine white leeks with a creamy sauce. Charlemagne is an expert in the production of good leeks ; he loves nothing better than to sit on an old stool snipping and cutting young leeks for planting out, and takes great unction to himself when he has set out a row, regimentally precise, in a trench. Another delight of his is to bring me a perfectly- shaped lettuce, Roman or Cos, when it is well- blanched and firm of heart. Such are not so easily cultivated as one might imagine, for they call for patience and exactitude, but Charlemagne con- siders himself an example of both these virtues.

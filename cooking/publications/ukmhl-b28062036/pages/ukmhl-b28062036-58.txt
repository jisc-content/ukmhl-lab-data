THE GARDENER AND THE COOK 42 expensive item, espeeially in Italy and France, and I have judged this to be one cause why stoves are invariably constructed so as to consume as little fuel as possible and to afford as much facility for utilising the heat produced as can be contrived. Where wood and charcoal are often substituted for coal, the processes of cooking are naturally slow, and this again has given rise to the use of earthen- ware pans for braising and stewing. The necessity for economy has fostered, so it seems to me, the invention of many ways and means, while climate has done its part in encouraging a preference for light, succulent and refreshing foods. When I go into an English kitchen, note its array of pots and pans and its ponderous range and elaborate gas stoves, and see the lavish use of fuel, I think it is surely somewhat shameful that with all this equipment our cooks can produce so little variety, so little that is original.

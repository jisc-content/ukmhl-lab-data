121 CELERIAC AND ARTICHOKES in salted water), and serve it with the gravy of meat, or with any sauee we like, or with butter and grated eheese. Sometimes we cut it in slices and lay it in the gratin dish, with a cheese sauce and crumbs, and thus it makes a more substantial dish. A few slices of celeriac are a great improve- ment to any stew, and a small root goes admirably with the other ingredients of bouillon or stock. So, I repeat it, if cooked celery be your aim and intent, try celeriac instead. And now let us study artichokes ; the Globe artichoke first, but afterwards the Jerusalem, or, to give it its proper and correct name, the Topi- nambour. The one gives us only enough to eat to make us wish for more, the other satisfies abundantly. In globe artichokes only the base of the leaves and the root are eaten, but these roots are con- sidered a prize among cooks. Charlotte, fcr

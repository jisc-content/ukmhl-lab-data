THE GARDENER AND THE COOK 74 I have found it most true when making a study of Charlotte. I have never found her spoiling that best of all sauees, the gravy of meat, nor does she mingle together many different flavours in her made sauees, and very rarely does she allow the sauee flavour to dominate that of the dish it aceompanies. A white sauce, she tells me, is expected to be bland ; it should not be disturbed by bitter or pronounced ingredients. It carries well the mild flavour imparted by small white mushrooms, by shrimps, crayflsh, oysters, mild cheese, herbs of quiet flavour, and a little lemon is permissible where some acidity is desired. It should be enriched with eggs or cream, and with butter. The brown sauces require stronger flavours: onions, the stronger herbs (like chervil), horse- radish, tomatoes, red wine, the darker mushrooms, and truffles, pickles and chutnies. All may be used

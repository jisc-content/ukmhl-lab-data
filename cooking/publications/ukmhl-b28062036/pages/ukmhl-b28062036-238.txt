THE GARDENER AND THE COOK 222 sugar, heating that to reduce the after boiling as much as possible. By this means we consider the flavour of the fruit is retained, and the sugar never turns to syrup. The principle is that it is the fruit which requires cooking and not the sugar, and it remains the same in all cases except where it is desired to preserve whole fruit in syrup. Acid fruits only will make jelly, but even in some acid fruits the quantity of jelly-making pectin is small, and some other fruit must be added. Strawberries will not make jelly without the help of red currant juice, and the raspberry also needs the same combination. Peaches, insufficiently acid alone, combine well with a yellow plum. Rhu- barb will not make, jelly, nor will cherries, but the juice of gooseberries will help to set both. The best fruits for jelly-making are (in the order named) the currant, gooseberry, crab-apple, apple, quince, blackberry, raspberry, plum, and peach.

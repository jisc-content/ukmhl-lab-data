It is better to put the yeast on to a piece of toast, and it must not be added until the liquor has cooled. At the end of that time the yeast is taken off, the liquor strained and poured into a cask, leaving the vent-peg loose, and when fermentation has ceased the cask is tightly closed up and kept for three months before opening. For orange wine the Seville oranges are necessary, and therefore we make this about the time when marmalade is in progress, in February or March. It is best to pare off the yellow peel very thinly, and to boil this with water and strain, then to add the pulp and juice, when the liquid is put on to boil with sugar ; it is again strained clear before pouring into the cask, where it must ferment for some weeks before corking down.

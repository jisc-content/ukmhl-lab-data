E 49 INDIAN CURRY curries, rice, cakes, puddings, pulse, porridge, and fruit, and several kinds of sweetmeats. Wherever European tastes and the luxurious demands of the wealthier natives have made them- selves felt, the cultivation of crops and the art of cookery are both brought to a high pitch of per- fection, but away from such centres the native palate will content itself with unripe fruits, indi- gestible roots, and the strong-flavoured vegetables which are indigenous to the soil. In this respect the influence of the Anglo-Indian has been bene- ficial, for the native chef, when he can be induced to exert himself, develops a surprising talent for turning out entrees and appetisers. Four courses is a modest menu indeed, and the variety of pillau, ketcheries, and curries that he can evolve wherewith to please a jaded appetite seems endless. And there is nothing in all the realm of culinary art to surpass a really fine curry.

THE GARDENER AND THE COOK 82 soup we call Poiage d la Bonne Femme. For this the marmite is half filled with water or with onion stock, and we put into it when boiling a slice of fine white bread, absolutely without crust, and cut into dice. In the meantime in another pan several fresh spring onions have been added to some two or three ounces of butter, then a couple of handfuls of sorrel leaves, a heart of cabbage lettuce, some chives and small herbs, all minced together, are put into the same pan, and covered down to simmer for half an hour. After cooking through, these are crushed and a little salt and pepper added, then the whole is put into the marmite and allowed to cook a little longer. Be- fore it is served the pot is drawn aside to cool slightly, and the beaten yolks of two eggs and a little milk or cream are gently stirred in. This slightly thickens the soup, and it is ready to pour into the tureen and serve out with fried bread.

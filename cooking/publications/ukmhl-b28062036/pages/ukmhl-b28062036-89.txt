73 SAUCES AS LUBRICATORS with water, and in the corner of the stove the liquor comes to a boil slowly, is skimmed and boiled again, and so on for some hours; it is then strained through muslin and kept in a jar to use for stock as required. It can be thickened with rotix or potato-flour, coloured and flavoured for a brown sauce, or it can receive yolks of egg and butter with flour and cream for a white sauce, or be enriched with wine and mushrooms for one of special quality. Any one with a moderate amount of the cooking instinct can with such a foundation evolve a variety of sauces. A sauce we say in this house is not an accident but a necessity. It is a “ felt want.” Condiments may be appetisers, but sauces are lubricators. But a sauce must be appropriate. It must act upon the taste in one of two ways, that is by con- trast or by a harmonious blend. You find the truth of this when studying a book of good recipes.

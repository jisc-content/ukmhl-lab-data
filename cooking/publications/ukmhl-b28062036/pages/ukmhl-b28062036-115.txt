99 THE SALAD-MAKER Occasionally we get what might be described â€¢ as a tour de force from Charlotte in the matter of salad-making, but only occasionally. As a rule we are content, as she is, with the plainer sort, satisfied to know that she can do great things and rise to the opportunity when it arrives. When it does arrive, let the season be what it will, she is never dismayed or put out where her salad bowl is concerned.

THE GARDENER AND THE COOK 200 the beaten yolks of two eggs, and serving in eups with morsels of joreserved ginger floating in them is also very nice. Almost better than fruit soups, however, de- licious though they are, is the practice of serving fresh fruit, such as melons, shaddocks, and grape- fruit, or even oranges, as an introduction to a meal. Melons are served thus in slices, and are eaten with pepper and salt instead of with sugar; shaddocks require a little sweetening perhaps, as also does the grape-fruit for some palates. The proper way to serve the latter is to cut them across in half, scoop out the cores and pips, fill up the centre with sugar, and serve with a spoon. In eating them one should take out the juice, leaving nothing but pulp and rind. Large oranges, particularly jaffas and the navel or seedless variety, are admirable when served after this manner.

THE GARDENER AND THE COOK shown you Charlemagne and Charlotte working together usefully, if not always peacefully, and now, at the garden gate, I must bid you farewell, for whatever this Gardener and this Cook of mine may or may not do, they at least assure me that the place for all would-be inheritors of the earth is among the Meek !

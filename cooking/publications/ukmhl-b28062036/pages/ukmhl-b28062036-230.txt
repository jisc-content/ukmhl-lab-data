THE GARDENER AND THE COOK 214 It has shelves all round, and deep eupboards where we store superfluous jars and bottles. Down in the larder we keep a sufficient selection of all that is found here for immediate use, as Charlotte and I do not care to mount stairs oftener than we cg,n help, and this storeroom is our bank of reserve. Very proud are we when we carry up hither a fresh trayful of jars or bottles, all neatly labelled and sealed. Should we ever be beseiged we are sure to have something wherewith to keep star- vation away, Charlotte says, with a reminiscent smile. She has vivid recollections of that memor- able siege time of the early seventies, and such experiences, she says, make one frugal. I must frankly own that my own satisfaction in our storeroom arises out of quite another feeling. I value this well-filled place because, as a Scotch- man would bluntly say, “ there’s money in it.” It is a mundane reason, perhaps, but it’s a true one.

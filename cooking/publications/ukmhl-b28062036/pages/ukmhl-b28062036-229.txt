213 IN STOREROOM AND CLOSET: PRESERVES, JELLIES, BOTTLED FRUITS, PICKLES, WINES, AND CORDIALS. SHOULD I entitle this storeroom of ours by that quaint appellation used long ago—“ A Gentlewoman’s Closet of Rich Rarities ” ? I should dearly like tOj for in truth it is a goodly place ! It is a room at the top of the house, airy and dry, and not subject to great variations of tempera- ture ; in fact there is a small oil stove kept in it for use in extreme cold weather. There are permanent ventilating panes in the window ; and reed blinds keep out the sun and too much light, as a darkened room is best for keeping purposes.

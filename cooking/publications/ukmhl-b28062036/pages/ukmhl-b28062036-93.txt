77 THE DRESSING OF A SALAD this way alone can one feel really sure of having the pure article. The prejudice which so many have for oil, arises from the fact of its being so constantly adulterated with cotton-seed and other oils. Our pure olive or Florence oil is clear and bright and almost as thin as water. The chemist is bound to sell the pure element, as he buys it only for medical purposes. It is dearer to buy it in this way, but it is worth the extra cost. There is one dressing which we make in winter and prepare in a good quantity at a time. It is made by putting into a bowl the raw yolks of two eggs, adding to them a teaspoonful of salt, beating well and by slow degrees adding a pint of Florence oil until it is thoroughly blended. Then we add a spoonful of made mustard, one of tarragon vinegar, and two of ordinary vinegar, and a small spoonful of castor sugar. It is well mixed and bottled, and positively improves by keeping for some time.

THE GARDENER AND THE COOK 114 may think it witchcraft; but then he does not garden with his soul. There you have it! (This is not a digression, it has something to do with everything we produce, from the humble potato upwards.) Charlemagne is vexed and put out every year because that, with his most assiduous and correct care, he fails to get the fine asparagus which he would like to cut. The asparagus which we take most pleasure in every spring comes to us from a little seaside cottage garden, where lives an old sailor, whose acquaintance I made years ago. He and I made those beds of his on some raised banks, close to the sea, and he and I now enjoy their fruiting. As the asparagus of our gardens is a cultivated form of what was originally a wild shore plant it is quite possible to over-improve it. It wants salt, and it loves a soil of mixed sand and mud.

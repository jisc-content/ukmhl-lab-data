239 MARMALADES brought slowly to the boil, and allowed to boil for ten minutes. The fruit is then lifted out with the strainer and set in dishes to eool. The vinegar is boiled again until slightly thick, and when the fruit has been packed into jars it is poured over, and they are covered at once. Small cherry tomatoes put up after this manner are delicious. Large vegetable marrows make a nice marma- lade when flavoured with the thinly peeled rinds of fresh lemons and with bruised ginger root. Three quarters of a pound of sugar to each pound of fruit pulp is quite sufficient, and the mass should boil until it looks clear. If insufficiently boiled it makes a dull and cloudy preserve. For marrow chutney, a very nice preparation, the slices of raw marrow are laid in the preserving pan with sufficient vinegar to cover, alternating each layer of marrow with one of brown sugar.

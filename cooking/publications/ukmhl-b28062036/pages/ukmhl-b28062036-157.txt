141 “ KITCHEN LILIES with a mince of meat and herbs or a vegetable minee flavoured with onion, sprinkle eheese over them, and bake in the oven until a light brown. And now to speak of onions, or, to give them their most worthy title, “ kitehen lilies.” This is no fancy nickname. The onion belongs to the lily tribe ; it is an Allium, of which we eat the bulb. The eschallot is the Allium ascaloni- cum; the leek is the Allium 'porrum; chives, garlic and rocambole, another variety of garlic, though much milder, are all of the same family.

83 THE SUCCULENT LETTUCE With sorrel we make also a fluid puree, or rather sauee, for eating with veal or fowl, and when cold this same sauce goes most agreeably with cold fish. Lettuce, cos or cabbage, cooked.^â€”One of the nicest dishes we can have in summer is that of lettuces stewed in broth and served hot with a garnish of green peas or young beans. After being washed and cut into half, the lettuces are thrown into boiling water with salt to blanch them, then lifted out and drained. They are then laid in a stewpan with sufficient vegetable or bone stock to cover them, with a spoonful of minced onion, of parsley and mint or tarragon, also minced, some pepper and salt and a little butter. They simmer under cover for an hour or more, and are then laid in a hot dish. Cooked peas or beans are used to fill the hollow centres, and a little of the liquor, being thickened and re-boiled, is then poured over.

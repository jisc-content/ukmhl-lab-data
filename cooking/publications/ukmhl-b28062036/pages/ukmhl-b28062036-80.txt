THE GARDENER AND THE COOK 64 breast of veal or lamb cut into finger lengths, all previously fried. Over these is a sprinkling of seasoning and dried herbs. If the meat be one of the two mentioned all the vegetables chosen are white, if it be beef then carrots and tomatoes may also be used. The layers continue until the casserole is nearly filled, then another plate covers the whole, a cupful of warm water is poured in at the side and the proper cover of the casse- role is replaced. This is simmered on the top of the stove for at least three hours, and when the covers have been removed it is brought to table wrapped round with a cloth. If an old fowl or rabbit comes our way it is not used for a ragout, but is cut into pieces and packed close into the terrine, with certain small onions and herbs and seasoning, and a little fat of bacon, and after slow cooking is pressed down without removing, to be turned out when cold.

203 A USE FOR FALLINGS count upon a more liberal supply of blenheims and pippins and mellow russets, yet of sueh as re- mained to be gathered we were thankful. There was one noble tree of early yellow transparents, whieh more than made up for any other lack— such a beautiful “ before-breakfast ” apple it is. We had a good many fallings to make use of, as eommonly happens in an old orehard. Of these the finer ones only were kept for roasting, and the others went to make jelly, and those whieh were not sound enough for this purpose made us apple butter. You cannot make good jelly out of ill- formed and inferior apples, but for butter it suffices to sliee, pare, eore, boil down to a pulp and sweeten, and every available apple can be utilised, even crabs. You merely have to go on boiling the brown pulp until a smooth, buttery mass results, and it can be stored away and used in winter time in plaee of ordinary butter.

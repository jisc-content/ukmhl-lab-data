THE GARDENER AND THE COOK 254 all the small fibrous roots that annually make their appearance and would, if left to themselves, soon fill up the pots. A great point about growing good fruit on trees in pots is to limit the number which each tree may carrry, although to do so seems to demand a sacrifice. Of peach, nectarine, and fine apples we leave only six or eight to ripen, but are re- warded by seeing every one come to perfection and attain a fine size. The bush trees can carry more, and plums are allowed to ripen a fair number, while cherry trees seem to have their own method of regulating their crop, and may safely be left to do their own thinning out. Of course we could easily have grown more fruits, but it was also a question of growing good trees, and of making them last, as well, and we felt it wise to exercise discretion. But, dear me! what debates all these points involved.

207 COOKED APPLES not hard, but a little sharp. Pare and sliee moderately thin, and arrange in your dish, sprink- ling with finely-ground nuts. Add a spoonful of eastor sugar to the ordinary French salad dressing, and use a touch of cayenne instead of ordinary pepper. Or, instead of oil and vinegar, take the juice of limes or lemons, and add some good cream. An apple salad, as an accompaniment to ripe cheese, Stilton or Gloucester, is excellent. Apple Beignets are another joy. The apples are pared and the cores removed without dividing, so that when sliced the rounds are perfect. Dip each ring into the true beignet batter, which is compounded of whites of eggs, a little flour, a little sugar and salt, some olive oil, and sufficient Avater to dilute into a sort of thick cream. Drop each ring into a depth of absolutely boiling fat. When puffed out, and crisp and brown, drain them on paper, roll in powdered sugar, and serve hot.

113 I OF TIMES AND SEASONS it is always “ A^ow is the accepted time ”—and no other. “ But think,” I say to him, “ only think how the seasons have become mixed up of late, especially in England ! Really, you can grow pretty well anything at any time of the year, if you only make up your mind to it.” We have a week of cool spring weather at the end of July that rushes a lot of new seeds into life, and we have May days in November that bring out a new m enthusiasm for rebudding and blooming. For my part, when I put in a plant or a seed, I make up my mind that if there is any grain of health in that plant or seed it is bound to grow, and it won’t be comfortable or happy until it has grown ! That thing of rigid rules and dates which men call a calendar I abominate. I will not consult it nor follow it. For my plants behave handsomely to me, and, as a rule, they answer the expecta- tions I have formed of them. Charlemagne

o 193 FRUIT SALADS One reason why they keep well is perhaps because Charlemagne follows a very old practice and breaks the tops of the branches at the tip, not right off, but leaving them to wither. It sends the sap into the fruit and prevents inordinate growth of leaves. Well-ripened raspberries and red currants mixed with a few tart cherries, what a delicious summer salad do they not make, especially if a suspicion of liquor lurks within the bowl ! The only dressing they need, if you mix them early enough in the day, and set the bowl in a cool place for a few hours, is plenty of sugar and sufficient wine to moisten it, with that goutte of kiimmel or more delicate noyau. A salad of fresh strawberries we dress in Italian fashionâ€”that is, with sugar and the juice of lemons. To our thinking this is nicer and certainly more refreshing than thick cream can be, and it gives more value to the flavour of the fruit.

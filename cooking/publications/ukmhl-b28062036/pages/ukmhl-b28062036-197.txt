181 CURRANT BREAD in the fruit. Moreover, the fruit must have been dried after washing, A cut across the top of the loaf to let out the steam when baking makes the loaf much lighter, and yet the baker will persist in “ varnishing ” the surface, with the result that his loaf is tough and moist. Our own currant bread partakes more of the nature of the true French brioche, and is really nicer to eat when several days old than when just fresh. For the “ sponge ” we use fresh barm, not German yeast, and the dough, when it is mixed, is soft enough to beat with a wooden spoon. Butter, fruit, and a little sugar with the beaten eggs, and a little milk and water, are worked in after the sponge has risen, and the whole is left to rise in a warm place for several hours, much longer than is usual for ordinary bread. It is then lightly rolled on a floured board, and is baked in round cakes in the oven.

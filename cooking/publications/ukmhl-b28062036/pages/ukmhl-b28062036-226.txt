THE GARDENER AND THE COOK 210 If I owned to having some conscienee-priekings in respect to birds when I began this chapter I must, ere its conclusion, add that I am more than ever inclined to award them their full rights to a partnership, since I have met with some words by Phil Robinson on that score. If any one doubt my assertion that birds are our fellow-toilers, and maintains that they are unprincipled marau- ders and no more, let him read the following lines ; â€œFor bull-finches and chaffinches and bud- eating birds it is often said that they injure a tree for its own good, destroying insects which would eventually have done more harm than they. This may be as it may be, but I never heard any one suggest that blackbirds and thrushes have any ulterior beneficence in mind when they visit an orchard. Nor do I think, if frankly asked the question, that those birds would hesitate to give a straightforward answer. There is nothing in their demeanour to lead you to suppose that they affect any more virtuous intention than the satisfaction of their own appetites. . . .

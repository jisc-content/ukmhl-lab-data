p 209 COMPOTES AGAIN former, which keeps in the full flavour of the fruit without losing its form or spoiling its appear- ance, is a method to be infinitely preferred. For this you must make your syrup first by boiling together sugar and waterâ€”not too much of either ; the fruit to be cooked is wiped and put in, not too much at a time, and cooked until quite tender, but not long enough to break it, and after it is done the syrup is reduced by further boiling and poured over. For a compote of strawberries it suffices to pour boiling syrup over the fruit, repeating the process three or four times, and not to cook the fruit at all. A compote of apricots or peaches should have the blanched and split kernels added to the syrup. Rhubarb is much nicer cooked after this manner than stewed, and plums are vastly better, but gooseberries and raspberries and currants need stewing and are often better for straining too.

115 ANTHONY’S ASPARAGUS-BEDS . The best result has come from those banks where no manuring has been done, but only a thorough weeding and clearing every year and a fresh salting. In our own garden we have introduced a good deal of sand and grit into the beds from time to time, with distinct advantage, and although here we get stalks that are plump and white, they never attain the flavour of those which old Anthony sends us from time to time. Our beds, in the autumn, are aglow with berries and thick with fine feathery foliage. It is a bad sign : even Charle- magne knows that. But as there is a whole literature of asparagus—for it forms one of the most fascinating chapters in horticultural science— I venture not to lay down any directions about it. For me it is enough to know that if our own beds yield badly, those by Anthony’s cottage are safe to do well, and we are sure of having aspara- gus in plenty, so I will begin about its cooking.

Entrecote.—Take a suitably-sized piece and turn it about in a frying or saucepan containing a little cut fat; add salt and pepper to taste, cover and leave it over the fire till tender, then put it aside in a warm place ; in the meantime remove the fat from the liquor which was left in the pan, and add to this equal quantities of white wine and water (according to the amount of sauce you require). Put it over the fire in a small saucepan and let it slightly reduce ; thicken with a little brown sauce, add some chopped mushroom, and let it boil; finally stir in an eggspoonf ul of Maggi essence, pour it over the meat, and serve very hot. This can be varied by using olives instead of mushrooms and different kinds of brown sauces, which in every case almost are more suitable to beef than white ones. Ox Tongue.—Scald it and remove the skin; put it into a suitable utensil with some fat, small onions, and a few slices of bacon; set it over the fire until the tongue has become slightly coloured ; remove the fat, season to taste, sprinkle the tongue with flour, cover it up again, and after half an hour add equal quantities of ordinary red wine and water; let this simmer quite slowly, well covered up, and over a slack fire for from two to three hours according to the size of the tongue. Remember that the fire, though slack, must he kept absolutely even, or every time it goes down the contents of the saucepan will run the risk of becoming tough. Take the onions, etc., out of the gravy, and send the latter in either in the dish or in a sauce-boat.

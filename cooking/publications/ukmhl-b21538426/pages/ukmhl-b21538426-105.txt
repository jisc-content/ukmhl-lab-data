105 PUDDINGS AND SWEETS. Bread and Butter Pudding.—Fill a well-butterecl pie- clish with alternate layers of slices of bread and buttei and currants ; pour over this a good custard and bake tiLl set. Chestnut Mould.—Boil some large chestnuts after splitting the skins with a knife; when quite tender skin and peel them, pound and press them through a moderately-fine sieve, mix with them some strawberry jelly or fresh cream, the latter very slightly flavoured with vanilla, and press it all into a buttered mould. Turn it out and serve cold with fresh ciearn or any kind of jelly or custard. Caramel Apples.—Peel, core, boil, and press through a sieve the necessary quantity of apples ; then sweeten and flavour them and return them to the saucepan. lien quite hot and rather reduced in quantity, put them into a shallow hot dish ; sprinkle them thickly with sugar and burn this by passing a red hot iron over it. Serve with or without fresh cream or with a junket. Bemon Cream (without Cream).—Squeeze the juice out of three lemons, and pour it on their rind, which must previously have been very thinly pared off; cover it up closely, and allow it to stand three or four hours. Add to this the yolks of two and the whites of four eggs, well beaten ; mix all this well with two teaspoonfuls of orange flour water, then add a pint of clear water. Strain and sweeten to taste, stir it carefully over a slow fire till it becomes as thick as cream, pour it into glasses, and stand on ice till wanted. h

COOKERY. 62 Staffed Omelet.—Mix a little Hour with the eggs and seasoning, as this should be rather more like a pan- cake than an omelet pure and simple. Have ready, thoroughly minced, the cold remains of any fish, fowl, or meat, together with finely-chopped herbs and onions, rather hot seasoning moistened with the yolk of an egg, and, if necessary, a spoonful or so of stock. Fry the eggs, etc., in a small pan, spread the mixture over it, fold it, and dish it up ; or if more than one is required, send them in one by one as soon as they are ready, as they should be eaten very hot. Cheese Omelet.—Allow one egg, and one table- spoonful of flour to each person. Beat this together with plenty of seasoning, add a handful of grated Gruyere or parmesan cheese, and fry a good colour. Fold and serve. Ihuneijitim (Plain).—Stir together in a basin throe or four eggs, a quarter of a pound of grated cheese, salt, a pinch of cayenne, and either a gill of cream or a cupful of sour milk. Have ready some hot butter in a gratin dish, put into this a few slices of bread let them slightly brown; then pour over each one a layer of the above mixture; bake in a brisk hot oven till just set, and serve very hot. Scrambled Etjtjs.—Beat up three or four eggs with a teacupful of milk, add salt and pepper to taste ; have ready some hot butter in a small saucepan, pour in the mixture and stir over the fire till it is just beginning to set, and has attained the consistency of cream. Serve on fried or plain toast.

10 COOKERY. or the desire to travel, and to become accustomed in some measure to a different cuisine. Authors and compilers of recipes, dainty dinners, etc., have already amply catered for the public, and it would seem that yet another cookery book would hardly be more necessary than the traditional “ carrying of coals to Newcastle”; but there really is a great deal more to be said in order to show our housewives many ways and means of preparing appetising fare on economical principles, with very little more trouble and certainly at no greater expense than is devoted to the plain roast and boiled of which, whatever we may say, we occasionally get so tired. To help the English housewife to provide dainty dinners, to make the most of all good remains, and to cater economically in a varied and commonsense way, is the main object of this little book. Most of the recipes given here represent dishes usually found on Continental tables; many of them I have adapted after many trials, to suit a small party, and all will prove successful if the instructions are carefully followed.

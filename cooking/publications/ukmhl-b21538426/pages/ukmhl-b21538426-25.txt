STOCKS AND SAUCES. 25 be added to the broth for the soup. This is an excellent plan by which the driest goods can be put to profitable use. Fowl Slock.—This is a useful preparation, especially for children and invalids, and one in which people living in the country can often indulge. Take an old fowl, pluck and clean it, cut it in half, and boil it for two hours with some salt and pepper, a couple of carrots, two leeks, and half a bay-leaf. The result is very light coloured broth, but it is delicate and very nourishing. Before serving add an eggspoonful of Maggi’s essence (see p. 42). This stock does not keep so long as that made from meat. I eal Stock.—This is more nourishing than the former, and also very good for invalids. Take a quarter of a pound of the shin of veal, or a piece of the lean without any fat, cut it into small pieces, and put it over the fire in three pints of water ; let it simmer, skimming carefully the while. Add the necessary amount of salt and pepper, a handful of sorrel, a small lettuce, some chervil, one small onion, and the least pinch of pounded mace. Let the whole boil slowly for two hours, strain and keep for use. Invalid Iieej I'ea.—Cat into small pieces about two pounds of steak, put them into a stone pot, close it up tightly, and boil it an bain-marie ; that is, in a larger vessel containing enough water to cover the jar. Let it boil for six hours ; in this way the very strongest extract of meat is obtained, and is most -beneficial to those suffering from great weakness. _am Jen P.L

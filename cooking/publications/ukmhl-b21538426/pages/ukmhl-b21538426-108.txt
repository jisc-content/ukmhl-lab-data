COOKERY. 108 Fruit Blancmauger.—Have ready about half a pound of almonds blanched and pounded, also a few pistachios sliced, and some preserved stoned cherries or any other small fruit; put the almond paste into a copper pan over the fire with half a pint of cream, a little sugar, and the slightest quantity of any desired flavouring essence. Dissolve in a little water about one ounce of gelatine (Marshall’s leaf gelatine is far preferable to most others), add it to the cream, etc., and go on stirring this always in the same direction until it is quite hot, then draw the pan aside, and go on stirring till the mixture is nearly cold. Pour it into a cold basin, still stirring; add the pistachios and the fruit. Dip the mould into which it is to be put into some cold water so that every part of the inside is moistened, then put in the mixture and set it on ice or in a place cold enough for the contents to set. Turn it out and serve with a garnish of preserved fruits or not, as convenient.

Let this simmer gently with the cover on for nearly an hour over a slack fire or over the gas (turned rather low). After this lapse of time, turn the fowl and baste it; add two or three carrots sliced, and previously parboiled, a dozen or so of small onions, two large ones sliced, a few small thin slices of streaky bacon, an eggspoonful of Maggi essence, and a tablespoonful of brandy ; put on the lid and let the whole cook till quite tender over a rather brisk fire. When done, remove the fat and send in the marmite on a clean napkin. If desired, morels, olives, or mushrooms may be added with advantage. The poulet en casserole is prepared in almost the same way, only the fowl must be a nice young one. This also can be served in the marmite in which it has been cooked, or it can be done in any kind of securely closing utensil that will fit into the oven ; for this, put the fat, the bacon, and the onions, etc., all into the saucepan; first let them heat in the fat over the fire, then put in the chicken, and let it slightly colour on both sides; pour into the utensil a teacupful of stock, or part stock and water, cover, and let it braise in the oven until quite tender. If sent to table in the marmite, tie a clean napkin around it.

17 KITCHEN UTENSILS. CHAPTER II. KITCHEN UTENSILS. This is a formidable subject, especially in England, where the general reform in culinary matters has not as yet extended very far towards improving the tools used by the ordinary cook. On the contrary, the latter seems to take a positive delight in her old- fashioned black saucepans, and very often cannot be induced to give any others a trial. On an emergency of course all kinds of things may be attempted, and fairly well carried out even with poor utensils. For instance, very tolerable coffee may be made in an ordinary jug if one knows how to do it, but in the natural course of things it is absolutely necessary in order to do justice to good material, and to properly carry out really good recipes, that the best possible utensils be provided. The question that arises, therefore, is this: By what kind of saucepans, etc., can the hideous black pots now in use be replaced ? Either by copper, seamless steel, block tin, or aluminium, or better still by some of eachâ€”at any rate, not by one sort to the exclusion of all the others. The labour of cleaning these utensils can be reduced to a minimum by rubbing them over every time they are used, and rinsing them out with proper care.

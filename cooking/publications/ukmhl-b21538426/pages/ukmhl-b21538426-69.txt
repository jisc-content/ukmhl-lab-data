G9 VEGETABLES. Dandelion.—This common field plant makes a delightful dish before it has grown too large. It is prepared like the last-named vegetable, and is much improved by the addition of a couple of table- spoonfuls of good gravy flavoured with two or three drops of Maggi’s essence. Sorrel is cooked in the same manner. Red Cabbage.—Boil the cabbage for one hour in slightly salted water ; drain off the water, and put it into a stewpan with salt, pepper, a piece of bacon rind, and a little pork dripping or lard. Cover, set it over a moderate fire, and simmer gently for three hours. Serve with boiled pork, sausages, boiled beef, etc. Or cut the cabbage in fine slices, boil them in water and stock, let them cook till quite tender and till the liquor has been quite absorbed. Boil some peeled and well-skinned chestnuts, and when ab- solutely tender serve them with the cabbage. Brussels Sprouts.—Trim them and boil them in salted water for about twenty minutes ; drain off the water; put them into a stewpan with a piece of butter, a tablespoonful of flour, two tablespoonfuls of good stock or sour milk, salt and pepper to taste, and let them stew till quite tender. Or after having boiled them as above (this should always be the first part of the operation whatever the recipe adopted), let them simmer till tender in a brown roux, and add at the last moment some good beef or veal gravv. Cooked in this way they are specially good with .partridges.

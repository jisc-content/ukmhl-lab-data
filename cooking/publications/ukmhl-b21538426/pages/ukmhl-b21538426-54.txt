Pike (to Stew).—Choose a moderate-sized fish, or a small one according to requirements, and so as to be able to use it whole, scale and clean it thoroughly, rub it well inside with salt and pepper, sprinkle it with a very little flour and some lemon-juice, and stew it in a covered pan with a little butter; when it is partly done add a small tumblerful of French cooking wine and a lump of butter the size of a large walnut well kneaded with flour, set the pan over a moderate fire or in the oven, and let it cook till quite tender, basting it occasionally; meantime have ready four or five filleted sardines, the same number of chopped eschalots, and brown them in a pan with some butter ; when the fish is done dish it up, stir the sardines, etc., into the liquor in which the fish has stewed, thicken it (if desired), and serve it round the fish. Pike (with Parmesan).— Take the remains of cold pike, or fillet a fresh fish, cut in pieces, trim them tidily, sprinkle them with salt and let them stand ; meanwhile brown a large chopped onion in a little butter, put the fish in the same pan, cover it, and let it steam till tender; put the fish on a board, remove any hones that may be left, and sprinkle the fish with parmesan ; add to the butter in which the fish was cooked one tablespoonful of flour and a couple of tablespoonfuls of sour milk or cream, and stir over the fire without letting it boil ; put the fish in a gratin dish previously spread with butter, pour the thick sauce over it, cover with breadcrumbs and grated choese, and bake in the oven till brown.

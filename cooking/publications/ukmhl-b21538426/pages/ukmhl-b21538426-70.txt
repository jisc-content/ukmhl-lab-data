70 COOKERY. Sauerkraut.—Those who like this may be glad to know the best way to prepare it. It may be obtained in many foreign shops in London—for instance, at M. Paul Schiller’s, 29, New Oxford Street, London, W. Wash it well in lukewarm water, until the water remains clear; then drain it; put it into a large saucepan with a bath chap or a smoked sausage, or a piece of pork, a little piece of butter, and a few tablespoonfuls of plain stock ; let it boil gently for an hour or two, drain off the liquor, put it over the fire again with a small piece of butter, and serve very hot. Carrots.—Boil some young well-scraped carrots in some stock; when they are nearly tender, cut them in slices, then saatez (toss) them in hot butter till they assume a deeper colour, sprinkle them with finely- chopped parsley, and serve very hot. When this vegetable becomes rather old, cut the carrots in small pieces, slightly brown them in good hot fat or butter, then sprinkle them plentifully with flour, and draw the saucepan aside, put in a small teacupful of stock, add salt and pepper to taste, cover and let this simmer over a slow fire for fully half an hour ; just before serving add a couple of tablespoonfuls of cream, or some milk, or the yolk of an egg to thicken the sauce. Serve quickly and very hot. Or when carrots have been used for making the regular provision of stock, cut them into slices, prepare a sauce with a little butter, some flour and stock, add a pinch of salt, one of sngar, and pepper to taste; put this over the fire with the carrots, and let them gently boil for a quarter of an hour.

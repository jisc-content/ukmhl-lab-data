COOKERY. 20 utensils for washing up and scrubbing ought to be plentiful, and they should be large enough to allow of quantities of hot water being used. It is a bad, but very common habit, on the part of young girls especially, to attempt to wash up in a vessel too small for the purpose, with the inevitable result that the plates and dishes remain greasy and smeared. The thrifty housewife will avoid all this by occasional personal supervision, and by providing for her servants articles with which to fulfil theii duties as promptly and as thoroughly as possible.

59 FISH* sauce has boiled and slightly thickened pour it over the tish through a strainer. Trout (Grilled).—Large fish are the best for this recipe. Make two or three slits with a knife cross- wise on both sides of the body of the trout, rub them over with a little salt, dip them in good salad oil and partly grill them ; dip them again in the oil and grill them a good colour. Serve with fried parsley. Trout (Fried).—Small fish are most suitable for this process. Wash and dry them thoroughly ; dip them in flour and fry them a golden brown. Serve plain, or with a sauce tartare. Cod (with Cream Sauce).—After the fish has been boiled put it on a board, remove the skin and large bones, and keep it very hot. Brown in a saucepan a piece of butter, into which stir two tablespoonfuls of flour ; stir in sufficient seasoning, one sardine skinned and pounded, and a tablespoonful of mustard, and when these ingredients are thoroughly smooth add a cupful of thick sour milk (or a little cream) and pour it boiling over the fish. Sole au Gratin.—Put into a well-buttered fireproof dish of suitable size a thick layer of breadcrumbs, mix together a small tumbler of French white cook- ing wine and stock respectively, season with salt and pepper, and pour half of it over the breadcrumbs ; lay the sole on this, moisten with the remainder of the wine, etc., add two tablespoonfuls of good meat gravy, a slight sprinkling of breadcrumbs, and lay two or three tiny pieces of butter on the top.

STOCKS AND SAUCES. 33 ltulienne,—Pat over the tire about half a table- spoonful of chopped eschalots, one of chopped mushrooms, truffles, and parsley respectively, and about one ounce or a little more of butter; add to this a small tumblerful of white wine, and let it simmer. When nearly boiling add about half a pint of esparjnole sauce or some strong brown coulis (see below). At the first boil the sauce will be ready. It will be seen from this that even these foundation sauces are dependent one upon the other, and that they are constantly intermingled in the manufacture of various dishes. The little I have been able to say on the subject in this short space will, I hope, make the matter, which has often been deemed a mysterious one by inexperienced persons, rather clearer than it has hitherto appeared. Sauce Blonde, or Veloute.—Make a roux as before with equal quantities of butter and flour. When well coloured add a pint to a pint and a half of good veal stock, stir over the fire till it boils, and add a carrot thinly sliced, one moderate-sized onion, half a dozen cloves, and a bouquet of parsley. Let this simmer over a slack fire very slowly till the contents have been reduced to one-third of the original quantity; skim it, and remove the fat whenever it is necessary, strain it, and put it aside. This is very useful for certain kinds of vegetables, and when it is wanted for the purpose it should be thickened before use with the yolks of one or two eggs. For hashed meats, etc., it is also desirable to flavour it with a small tumblerful of white cooking wine or Madeira.

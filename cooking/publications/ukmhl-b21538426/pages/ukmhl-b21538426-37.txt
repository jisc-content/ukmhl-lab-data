Sauce Robert.—Melt over the fire some butter or good marrow fat (lard will do as well), put in a couple of good-sized onions sliced, and toss them till they are fairly well coloured and tender. Moisten with the necessary quantity of good stock, add salt and pepper to taste, a pinch of nutmeg, the same quantity of mustard powder, and a few drops of vinegar.

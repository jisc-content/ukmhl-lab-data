61 OGS AND POTATOES. CHAPTER VI. EGGS AND 1> O T ATOE S. Omelet (Plain).â€”Break some eggs into a basin, season with salt and pepper, put in two or three little pieces of butter, and beat with a fork. Meantime have some butter heating in a clean frying pan over the tire, and as soon as it begins to smoke throw in the contents of the basin, which will immediately spread all over the pan. Hold the handle all the time with the left hand, shaking the pan a little, so that there is no risk of burning, and with the right, b\ means of a fork or palette knife, lift the eggs gently from the pan, working steadily all round the utensil. hen the underneath part is just set, and before the centre becomes stiff, slip the omelet to the edge of the pan to turn it, and quickly reverse it on to the hot dish in which it should at once be sent to table. Ihe great mistake generally made in the manufacture of omelets is that the operator is apt to forget that the eggs really go on setting after they have left the pan, and should therefore be put into the dish whilst they are still almost liquid in the middle of the omelet. This omelet can be varied ad infinitum with the addition of fines herhen, chopped bacon, mushrooms, kidney, sardines, anchovies, etc., etc.

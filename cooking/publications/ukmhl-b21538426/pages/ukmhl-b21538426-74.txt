COOKERY, 74 maocaroni, stir, and season plentifully; then serve quickly on a very hot dish, and send in grated cheese as an accompaniment. Broad beans, dried beans, peas, lentils, and such things are delicious in the winter when other veget- ables are scarce, but unless they are carefully cooked are heavy and unwholesome. The secret of making them tender and enjoyable lies in cooking them very slowly and for two or three hours ; moreover, as they are rather lacking in flavour, it is advisable to stir in some sliced or chopped onions and parsley slightly browned in hot butter, and if it is convenient to boil some bacon or some smoked sausage with them, it will greatly improve them.

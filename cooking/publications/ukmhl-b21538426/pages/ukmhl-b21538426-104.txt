When properly thickened over the fire, pour it into a glass dish or china punch- bowl, and let it set. When firm, whip the whites of two eggs to a stiff froth with two ounces of vanilla chocolate, and pile it over the custard. Danish Pudding.—Pick over and wash one teacupful of pearl tapioca, and put it into a saucepan with a pint and a half of boiling water. Cook for one hour, or until the tapioca is transparent, stirring frequently. Add one saltspoonful of salt, four ounces of sugar, and half a tumbler of currant or any other jelly. Stir till this is dissolved, then pour it into a glass dish, and stand it on ice. Serve very cold with cream and sugar.

Fill up the mould with apples, cover with a final layer of bread and butter, and bake in the oven to a golden brown colour. Turn out and serve.

MUTTON. 81 away with the surplus length. Nothing is so objection- able as a badly “ dressed” chop or cutlet, whatever it may be called. Cut off the meat, etc., leaving only the really edible part; beat gently, press into shape so that they may all be of about the same size, and prepare them according to taste, either plainly grilled, or fried in breadcrumbs served with tomato sauce, or with a sauce piquante. Any kind of vegetable puree is eminently suitable as an accompaniment. Tongues.—These make a good breakfast or supper dish. Soak them for two or three hours in cold water, changing it in the interval if necessary, then scald them in boiling water, until the skin can be removed ; after this has been done split them length- wise without cutting them in two; serve them thus hot, with a sauce piquante. Or keep them hot and make the following gravy: Put into a saucepan a -mall piece of butter with two tablespoonfuls of flour ; when well coloured add a little stock, two onions, two small carrots, salt, pepper, mace, and a little white wine. Put the tongues into this sauce, cover the saucepan, and let them simmer for at least two hours and a half, gradually adding a little stock to keep the sauce to the right consistency; serve very hot, with a sprinkling of finely-chopped parsley. Curry.—Put into a saucepan some onions sliced, in fairly large quantity, two or three apples, also sliced, with some fat, carrots, turnips, salt, pepper, etc.; fry till quite brown; if the meat has not already been cookrd, put it into the saucepan cut in suitable pieces;

36 COOKERY. Sauce Brune (Brown Sauce for Hashes, etc.)—Heat a little butter in a saucepan with some flour. When this is quite brown without being at all burnt, add the necessary quantity of stock, a small tumblerful of red wine, some chopped onions, half an eschalot, a very little garlic, half a bay-leaf, a blade or two of mace, and salt and pepper to taste. Let this boil freely for about twenty minutes, and thicken it a little if necessary. Sauce Paulette.—Stir a piece of butter in a saucepan over the fire, and as soon as it is hot put in a table- spoonful of flour, stirring all the time. Add a cupful of stock, salt and pepper to taste, and a blade of mace. Let it boil over a brisk fire for about twenty minutes. After this, thicken it with a tiny lump of butter, add the yolk of one egg, and finish off with a few drops of lemon juice or white wine vinegar. Sauce Maitre iVHotel.—This is very useful for all sorts of fish and some kinds of meat warmed up, hashed or otherwise. Take a quarter of a pound of butter, a pinch of salt, some pepper, and the juice of half a lemon. Put them over the fire in a saucepan; when the butter is partly melted draw the saucepan aside, stirring all the while until it is entirely dissolved and amalgamated with the other ingredients. With this, if necessary, mix some sauce blanche, which will produce a well-thickened maitre d'hotel sauce according to the approved style. Sauce Blanche (White Sauce).—Put into a small saucepan a tablespoonful of flour with a little water.

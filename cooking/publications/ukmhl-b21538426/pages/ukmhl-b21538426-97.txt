97 POULTRY AND GAME. Poulet Fricasse.—Remove the skin and principal bones of the remains of cold chicken ; stew the hones, skin, trimmings, etc., with a whole onion, some cloves, and a small piece of mace, and mix the stock produced with an equal quantity of melted butter; add a squeeze of lemon and put in the chicken ; when the latter is quite hot dish it up, and leave the sauce in the pan; thicken it with the yolks of one or two eggs, according to quantity, stirring all the time over the fire, but without allowing it to boil. Pour over the chicken and serve. With the cold remains of chicken, good supper dishes and cold lunch entrees can easily he prepared with the help of a mayonnaise sauce, a little fresh lettuce, etc. The turkey is prepared very much after the fashion of chicken, only more time must be allowed for cook- ing, as the bird is so much larger—one hour and a half and upwards should be reckoned for the roasting of a small turkey. This, too, is stuffed with every possible kind of ingredient, and anyone with culinary taste and imagination can safely experiment on this subject with a fair chance of success. Sausage meat, chest- nuts, etc., are available, and, of course, the most extravagant but delicious French custom of using truffles galore for special occasions is not to be despised by lovers of this tuber. Another delicious stuffing for a change is a chopped mixture of calves’ liver, bacon, mushrooms, parsley, chives, and, if desired, some crumb of two or three stale French rolls

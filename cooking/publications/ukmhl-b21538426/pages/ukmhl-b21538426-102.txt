102 COOKERY. CHAPTER XIII. PUDDINGS AND SWEETS. Plum Pudding.â€” Mix together in a very large earthenware pan one pound of suet, half a pound of flour, half a pound of breadcrumbs, one pound of raisins, currants, and sultanas respectively, two ounces of orange, lemon, and citron peel and sweet almonds respectively, twelve bitter almonds sliced, one ounce of mixed spice, one teaspoonful of ginger, ten eggs, the juice and chopped rind of one lemon, one teacup- ful of sugar, two full wineglasses of brandy, and a little salt. The suet must of course be chosen as dry as possible, and when carefully skinned be thoroughly chopped, raisins, etc., washed and stoned, peel chopped fine, and the almonds cut up, but not too small; mix all these ingredients, which naturally need not be prepared all on the same day, most thoroughly, and at the last add a little milk to moisten the whole. This is a recipe which should serve for special occasions, as it is by no means a very economical one. The above quantity will make about three good- sized puddings; they should all be boiled for six or seven hours before being stored away, and should hang in a dry place. Before serving, let them boil for eight or ten hours more, they can scarcely ever be overdone.

BEEF. 75 CHAPTER VIII. BEEF. The flesh of this meat should be neither too red nor too pale, and it is a sign of good quality if the fat is slightly tinted with yellow. The most useful pieces for stock are the buttock and the shin; the sirloin is generally reserved for roasting, though it can also be prepared according to various recipes. It is a mistaken notion that fresh beef when merely boiled is considered unfit for the table ; if it is properly cooked with a view to serving it thus, it can be perfectly tender and wholesome. The great mistake in boiling meats of all kinds, and also in stewing them, is that the process is carried on too rapidly, so that the meat hardens before it has had time to properly expand and become soft. With fresh boiled beef serve carrots, onions, turnips, and small dumplings. In using the sirloin it is a good plan to remove the undercut, so as to serve it in different ways. For instance, it can be cooked whole, either roasted, baked, or slowly stewed in a covered saucepan and in the oven, the time to depend on the size of the joint. Or it may be cut into slices, dipped in oil and fried or grilled, not too long; it may be accompanied with any kind of desirable garnish according to the time of year

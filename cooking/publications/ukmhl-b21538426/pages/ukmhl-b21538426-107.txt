107 PUDDINGS AND SWEETS. and very wholesome; they are always acceptable, especially when served with a little fresh cream, or some good boiled custard; for emergencies the canned goods or bottled fruits are invaluable. In summer, or for an occasional supper dish, a macedoine fruit salad is most delicious and refresh- ing ; it is very easily made. Cut into slices, or simply stone as the case may require, any kind of fruit that can be obtainedâ€”for instance, currants, gooseberries, cherries, grapes, bananas, oranges, apples, plums, etc. Put them all into a large bowl, sprinkle them with sugar, cover, and let them stand for an hour or so ; add some light white wine with or without a little water in sufficient quantity to produce the necessary juice, and serve. To make plain orange salad, peel the fruit, remove all the pith, and cut the orange broadwise, removing the pips carefully, and sprinkling with sugar as the fruit is put into the dish. This is the best way to extract all the juice, and to avoid an unpleasant amount of pith, which is sure to be objectionable if the fruit is cut in quarters or in pieces, instead of slices. A good way to utilise very stale bread is to cut it into even slices, fairly thick ; dip them in either fresh or sour cream, or in plain milk, then dip them in a good egg batter and fry a good colour. Sprinkle with sugar flavoured with vanilla, and serve very hot. Or cut the slices thinner, and make into jam sandwiches with a very thin layer of jam ; dip them as before very carefully so as to keep them well together, and proceed as above.

PREFACE 71 N apology is almost necessary for offering yet j* another cookery book to the public, when there are already so many manuals on the subject; but as very few have appeared in this condensed form, I may be forgiven for offering a few remarks on such an ordinary subject. Moreover, as it is impossible to attempt anything exhaustive in such a small space, my readers will soon understand that my intentjon has been merely to provide a little handbook of reference for those who already know something about cookery, and yet would be glad of recipes which, though slightly out of the common, arc nevertheless practical and simple.

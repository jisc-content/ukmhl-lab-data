FISH. SI thinly sliced, take them out and stir into the fat that remains two tablespoonfuls of Hour ; to this add two cupfuls of red wine and one of stock, let this slowly boil for about half an hour. This will not require any egg thickening. Pike, eels, barbel, in short almost any except such flat fish as sole, turbot, etc., or such rich fish as salmon, can with advantage be cooked and served with the matelotes. Salmon.—This should be carefully scaled, and emptied and washed by the openings made near the gills. The time required varies according to size. A small fish prepared whole should gently simmer for about two hours, but it is perhaps safest to reckon about half an hour’s slow simmering to every pound of this fish. It may be served plain with cucumber, with an accompanying white sauce of almost anv description, or cold with a mayonnaise. Salman (with Mushrooms).—Put the piece of fish into a saucepan with about a dozen, small onions, the same quantity of mushrooms and some butter, sprinkle it with flour, and let it brown on both sides. Add equal quantities of white wine and light stock (enough to cover), season to taste, put on the lid and let it simmer from one to two hours, moistening occasionally with more stock if absolutely necessary. When the fish is done put it on a hot dish, take out the onions, thicken the liquor with the yolk of an egg, throw in a dessertspoonful of very finely-chopped chives and tarragon, and serve very hot.

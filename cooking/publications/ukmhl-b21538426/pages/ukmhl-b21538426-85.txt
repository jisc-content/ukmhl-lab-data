Prepare onions as vegetables sliced as before, put them into the pan with some pork dripping ; when the onions begin to colour pour off the fat, sprinkle thickly with flour, put in the meat, add water to two-thirds of the thickness of the joint, put in a bouquet, salt, pepper, a blade or two of mace, the grated peel of half a small lemon, and one bay-leaf ; put on the lid and let all simmer gently for about two and a half hours, so that the liquor will be reduced to a semi-glaze. Remove the bouquet, dish up the meat with all the vegetables around, strain the sauce, and serve very hot. The bones, which are well covered with gristle, make a most delicious soup, which can be thickened with barley, rice, etc. It must not be forgotten that calvesâ€™ liver makes a delicious and useful dish ; the ordinary way of pre- paring it in this country with slices of bacon is too well known to need repeating here, but as a small joint it has a much more important appearance and an excellent flavour.

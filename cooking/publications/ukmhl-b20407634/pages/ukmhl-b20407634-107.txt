99 VEGETABLES. TO PREPARE VEGETABLES. Wash and scrub potatoes well, and peel thinly in clean water. New potatoes only need scraping. Green vege- tables, cabbage, cauliflower, lettuce, and spinach should be soaked in cold water with a little salt, to remove the grit and draw out any insects. Cabbage should have the coarse outer leaves trimmed away and the stalk split in four. Cauliflower also should have the leaves cut off. Lettuce should have the root cut away, and any damaged leaves removed. Spinach should be well rinsed, and have the stalks torn off. French beans should have the strings at the sides drawn off, and be cut into thin strips or diamonds. Turnip greens and Brussels sprouts should be well picked over and trimmed. Celery and seakale must be well washed, all mud brushed from the roots, and trimmed. Celery should have the top green stalk cut away. Carrots should be well scraped, and turnips thickly peeled, on account of their thick coarse rind, which must be cut away. They should then be cut into quarters. Vegetable marrow should be peeled, quartered, and cut across. Vegetables when prepared should be kept in cold water until cooked. H 2

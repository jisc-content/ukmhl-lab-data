SICKROOM COOKERY. 208 7, pint of stock. 1 bunch of herbs. 1 glass of claret. 1 oz. of meat glaze. Cut the game, whether cooked or uncooked, into nice- sized joints. Fry the chopped shallot lightly in the butter, then stir in the pieces of game, and fry without browning. Add the stock, herbs, and claret, and simmer until tender. Then add the meat glaze, and dissolve. Place the joints of game on a hot dish and strain the gravy over. If at all acid, dissolve a tabloid of saccharine, and add to the salmi sauce before dishing. SWEETBREADS. (diabetic.) Sweetbreads can be prepared as in the recipe for braised sweetbread (page 97). They should be dished on a bed of cooked spinach or French beans, and have any good diabetic sauce liked poured round. Sweetbreads can be served fried (page 96), using pounded gluten cx'umbs instead of bread crumbs. STUFFED VEGETABLE MARROW. (diabetic.) 1 small vegetable marrow. Sausage-meat (diabetic). Peel the vegetable marrow. Cut off one end and care- fully scoop out all the seeds and core. Mix one egg with the sausage-meat, season well, and fill the marrow. Replace the end and tie together with tape or strips of muslin. Place in a baking tin with half a pint of stock and bake in the oven until tender. Serve on a hot dish with a little good gravy round.

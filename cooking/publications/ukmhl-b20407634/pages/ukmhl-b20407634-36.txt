28 SICKROOM COOKERY. brown paper pierced with holes, or muslin, should be fastened across, to prevent risk of cold. The trap of the chimney must be kept open. A fire, too, considerably facilitates ventilation, as the air is drawn to the chimney. The temperature of the sickroom should generally be from 60° Fah. to 65° (occasionally a higher temperature is needed, in which case it will be specified by the doctor). Extra or unnecessary furniture should always be un- obtrusively removed from the room, if the illness promises to be long, as in this way it is easier to keep the room thoroughly clean. Neatness and order should reign. A few flowers always brighten a room, and convey to the patients the impression that they are thought of and cared for. All cups and glasses should be immediately removed. In cases of serious illness the noise caused by the replen- ishing of the fire often much distresses the patient. In this case, it is an excellent plan to take half a sheet of a newspaper, place some coal in the centre, draw the corners together and screw into a bundle. These packets may be placed on a tray and taken into the sickroom. When the fire needs making up put a packet on top ; the paper quickly burns, and the coal settles quietly into its place. Sometimes a few bakers' paper bags are utilised in this way.

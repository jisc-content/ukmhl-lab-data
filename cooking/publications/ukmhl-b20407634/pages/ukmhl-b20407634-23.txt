15 SICKROOM COOKERY. Stimulants, given under medical direction, must be looked on as an important item in the diet. For Convalescents very light and easily digested foods, tempting jellies to stimulate the appetite, milk in various light puddings, and eggs, should be given. Milk jelly, egg jelly, beef tea, boiled fish, and, later on, a little chicken, sponge cake, or a light pudding, are all suitable in a gradually ascending scale. Potatoes, pastry, steak, and solid meat must be care- fully avoided, as they are very indigestible. In most cases of convalescence the patient should have small quantities of light nourishing food administered often. As" convalescence progresses, an increase as to quantity may be made, but, as the digestion is weak and little exercise is taken, in no case should a meal approaching that taken in ordinary health be given. A little light wine, or other form of alcohols with meals is usually beneficial during convalescence. DIABETES. In Diabetes a special diet is needed. One of the func- tions of the liver is to convert the sugar into glycogen, which is stored up in the liver cells. In diabetes the liver cannot do its work properly, and the sugar passes in large quantities into the circulation. Therefore all food tending to supply sugar must be carefully cut out of the diet, and its place filled by others supplying the same needs under a different form. For this reason sugar and starch (which is turned into sugar during the process of digestion) must be carefully excluded from the dietary. The following foods are forbidden: Milk, sugar, flour, cornflour, oatmeal, rice, sago, macaroni and pulse. Fruits and certain vegetables, too, are forbidden

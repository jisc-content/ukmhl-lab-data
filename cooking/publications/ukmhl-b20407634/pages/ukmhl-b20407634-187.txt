SICKROOM COOKERY. 179 sugar to taste. Let it cool in the basin, until becoming slightly thick and creamy. Set at once in small moulds, rinsed with cold water. Turn out when firm. N.B.—The peptonised milk must boil, to stop the process of peptonisation, before adding the gelatine, or else the gelatine will not set into a jelly. PEPTONISED BEEF-TEA JELLY. 1 pint of peptonised beef tea. ■| oz. of sheet gelatine. Make the peptonised beef tea as in the preceding recipe, bring to the boil, and strain into a basin. Put in the gelatine while still very hot, and stir for a few minutes until dissolved. Set in a small mould or dariole mould rinsed with cold water. When firm dip for one moment into warm water and turn out. KB.—The peptonising process must be absolutely complete, even to the boiling of the beef tea, before putting in the gelatine, or else the liquor pancreaticus acts on the gelatine and takes away its power of setting into a jelly. PEPTONISED SOUPS. There are two ways of preparing peptonised soups. The first is to add half a pint of strong soup or stock to an equal quantity of peptonised gruel or milk gruel. The second, and most recommended, is to use peptonised gruel, which is quite thin and watery, instead of ordinary water, and then proceed to make the soup from shin of beef or any other material desired, in the ordinary way.

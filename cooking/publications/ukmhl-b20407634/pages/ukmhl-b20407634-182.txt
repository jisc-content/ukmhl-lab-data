SICKROOM COOKERY. 174 eight hours ; then squeeze all water out of it (lactic acid and other peccant matters are thus removed). Place the pulp in a pint of fresh water, and boil gently for an hour and a half, so as to break up the granules of starch and promote its conversion into dextrine and glucose. " Rub this semi-fluid gruel through a fine hair sieve; when cold it forms a smooth jelly. " For children who can digest no milk, this jelly may be simply mixed with enough warm water (one tablespoon- ful to eight ounces of water) so as to have the consistence of thin cream, and a little refined sugar added. " To make it, however, a suitable food for more than merely temporary purposes, it would need the addition of some albuminate and some fat. Its percentage compo- sition, mixed in the proportion stated, isâ€”proteids, 074 ; fat, 013 ; carbohydrates, 4-15. " If the addition of milk can be tolerated, then a mixture of three ounces of bread jelly to four ounces of milk (or peptonised milk) and four ounces of water will make a fairly good food, or the necessary amount of proteids and fat may be obtained by the addition of raw-meat juice and cream."

151 EGG DISHES. Eggs are extremely nutritious, containing all the nourishment necessary for life in a most concentrated form. They are very quickly digested when raw. If lightly poached or boiled they are also easily digested, but if over-cooked or hard-boiled the albumen coagulates, and they immediately become very difficult of digestion. Both yolk and white of egg are rich in albumen, the yolk being richer than the white. Special directions for preparing tempting and nourishing egg mixtures will be found in the section devoted to sickroom beverages. TO BOIL AN EGG. Put the egg into boiling water and boil gently for three minutes. If the egg is absolutely fresh it will take four minutes. Be careful in putting it into the saucepan not to crack the shell. If liked, the egg may be put into cold water, and brought gently to the boil. It will then be sufficiently cooked. A light digestible way of cooking an egg is to put it into a saucepan of boiling water. Draw it off the fire and let it stand where it will keep very hot, but not even simmer, for ten minutes. The egg will be lightly set, and more easily digested than when boiled,

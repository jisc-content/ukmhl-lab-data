34 SICKROOM COOKERY. It is usually made in one large cauldron or stockpot- shaped vessel, placed over a gas ring or stove, or else subjected to a powerful stream of steam. In tins way it becomes overheatedâ€”that is, heated beyond the point at which albumen coagulates. Therefore the beef tea is strained off minus much of the nutriment which it should contain. This could be obviated by the introduction of a beet- tea cauldron made on the principle of a double saucepan. Appended is a sketch, drawn by a practical engineer. It is one large cauldron within another. The beef and water for the beef tea to be placed in the inner cauldron. The outer cauldron to be filled with boiling water. The water in this outer vessel must be kept simmering all day, say, for ten hours, on a gas ring or stove, and filled up as it evaporates. The beef tea in the inner cauldron will not boil or become unduly heated, and will at the end of the time be ready to strain off. There should be a tap at the bottom of the inner cauldron, and piercing through both to draw off the beef tea. The inner portion of the tap should be elongated and finely pierced with holes, to act as a strainer. As fat always rises to the top, the beef tea drawn off at the tap will be comparatively free from grease. A second tap should pierce the outer vessel, to draw off the water when not in use. ' The fat should be cut away before making the beef tea, and the meat passed through a mincing machine. This is usually done in hospitals. Owing to the difficulty o removing all the fat from large quantities of meat if tae \Z tea could be allowed to go cold when cooked the fat would rise to the top of the cauldron and set. It could Then easily be removed, the beef tea heated to the pomt required, and strained off.

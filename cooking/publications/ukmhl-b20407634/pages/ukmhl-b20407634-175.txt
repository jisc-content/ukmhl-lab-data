SICKROOM COOKERY. 107 BUM AND MILK. \ pint of new milk. 1 tablespoonful of rum. Mix the rum well with the milk. Taken before break- fast TEA. Allow one teaspoonful of tea for each person and one over for the teapot. Make the teapot hot. Put in the tea and immediately pour sufficient boiling water on to it. Cover with a cosy, let it infuse for three minutes, pour off and serve. The water for tea must be absolutely boiling and freshly boiled. Tea which is allowed to stand too long is injurious to the nerves, and is neither wholesome nor palatable. TOAST WATER. 1 crust of bread, toasted. 1 pint of cold water. Toast a piece of crust of bread very brown and hard, but do not burn it. Put it into a jug with the fresh cold water, and let it soak for an hour. Strain, and it is ready. It should be a clear brown colour. Crust of bread is preferable for this, as if made from the crumb it more quickly turns sour. TREACLE POSSET. \ pint of milk. 2 tablespoonfuls of treacle. ^ juice of a lemon. Put the milk into a saucepan. When boiling pour in the treacle and lemon juice. It will curdle. Strain through muslin. This is given as a hot drink in cases of cold.

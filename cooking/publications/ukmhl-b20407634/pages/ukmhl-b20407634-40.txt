SICKROOM COOKERY. 32 contains a large amount of bone and gelatinous substance. It is the soluble albumen from the meat which is valuable in beef tea. Gelatine is an albumen-saving food and very easily digested, but cannot in any way take the place of albumen. If bones are boiled gelatine is obtained, whereas, by boiling, the albumen is coagulated and the beef tea spoiled. If beef tea sets when cold into a jelly, it may at once be assumed it has been made from the wrong kind of meat and in an incorrect manner. If beef tea is required in large quantities—as in hospi- tals—it is impossible to shred the meat by hand. It may then be passed through a mincing machine. See that the mincing machine is kept scrupulously clean, and allow good weight of meat on account of any loss of juice that may occur in passing through. In making beef tea in a saucepan, soak the meat m the cold water for a few moments, then commence to cook gently over a low fire or gas jet, stirring slowly with a spoon Soon the water will become a bright red and the meat will look pale and white, showing that the juices have leaked from the meat into the water. This is the object desired in beef tea, i.e., to get the nourishment from the meat into the liquid. Go on cooking gently, as no invalid will take it so undercooked. In a minute or two the liquid will begin to look a rich red brown. Take off the fire and strain. This explanation refers to " quick beef tea as given in the recipe. The other way of making beef tea is in a stone jar or double saucepan. The meat and water are put into a jar, covered and placed in a saucepan of boiling water, or a double saucepan can be used if liked. The water m the saucepan is kept at simmering point for three hours. 1 he beef tea inside the jar never boils. It must then be carefully strained.

100 SICKROOM COOKERY. TO BOIL GREEN VEGETABLES. Saucepan of boiling water. 1 large teaspoonfnl of salt. Soda to cover a threepenny piece. All green vegetables should be put into boiling water with the salt and soda, and boiled with the lid off. The lime in solution in hard water discolours green vegetables. By the addition of soda the lime is destroyed, the water softened, and the colour of the vegetables preserved. The time vegetables take to boil depends on their age and size. Young vegetables take about twenty minutes, older vegetables about thirty-five or forty minutes. As soon as tender strain, as, if left soaking in the water when cooked, they lose flavour and become discoloured. Cabbage.—Boil for thirty minutes, or until tender. Drain well, cut across, dish in a hot vegetable dish, and put some tiny pieces of butter on top. Cauliflower.—Boil from twenty to thirty minutes, according to size. Brain well.

Liason.—A mixture, generally of two yolks of egg and half a gill of cream beaten together, used to thicken white soups. Panada.—A very thick sauce of butter, flour, and water. It will bind together any ingredients added to it. Usually made in the proportion of one ounce of butter, two ounces of flour, and one gill of stock or water. To Pry in Deep Fat.—By a pan of fat for frying is meant clarified fat or lard. (See " To Fry Fish," page 61.) Buy fresh pieces of fat from the butcher. Cut up, removing all scraps of meat, put into an iron saucepan, and to every five pounds allow one quart of cold water. Boil until all the water has evaporated and the dripping comes out from the fat. Let it cool slightly, strain, and it is ready for use. It will keep well. Clarified Butter.—Put the butter into a small saucepan and boil for a few moments, then let it stand aside. Skim well, and pour off the clear butter. This is useful for greasing tins and prevents them from sticking. Spoons.—Wooden spoons will be found the most useful for blending, sieving, stirring or beating mixtures. Dariole Moulds.—These little moulds can be bought, made in tin, for about twopence each. They are most useful for setting jellies, creams, or cornflour mixtures. Jellies set in these small moulds will be found much more convenient for invalids, as they can be served one at a time Once a large mould has been cut into it ceases to look fresh or tempting.

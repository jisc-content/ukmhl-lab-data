SICKROOM COOKERY. 12 II.—METHODS OF COOKING. The different methods of cooking must be briefly con- sidered Here : Roasting is one of the most excellent and wholesome methods of cooking meat, and develops aromatic flavours which cannot otherwise be produced. At the same time there is little loss. The meat is placed close to the fire for a few minutes at first, in order to seal up the outside and cover it with a coagulated coating of albumen. This keeps in the juices of the meat, and lets little escape but the dripping (fat). It is then removed a little from the fire and cooked at a lower degree of heat, being well basted all the time. This prevents waste by shrinkage, and keeps the meat mellow and tender. Any meat juice which escapes coagulates and forms the basis of the gravy. Baking.—Meat can be well cooked in the oven, although it can never lay claim to the aromatic flavour of meat roasted before an open fire. There is also rather less shrinkage, and less fuel is required. It is necessary, however, to see that the oven is properly ventilated, and that a proper baking tin is used. This consists of a double tin, water being placed in the lower part which prevents the dripping from burning and giving off un- wholesome odours. The tin is further provided with a grid on which the meat rests, thus preventing unnecessary contact with the dripping. Boiling.—This is a most convenient and simple method of cooking. The principle is the same as applied to roast- ing. The meat must be put into boiling water and cooked for five minutes, to coagulate the albumen and form a coating to keep in the juices of the meat. It should then be simmered below boiling point until tender. In this way a light digestible food is secured. At the same time,

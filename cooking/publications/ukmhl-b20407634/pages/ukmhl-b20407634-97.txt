89 SICKROOM COOKERY. â–  Serve with any liquid that may have come from the chop. By this method nothing is lost, and it will be found both a light and digestible way of cooking a chop. STEWED CHOP. 1 mutton or lamb chop. \ pint of stock or water. 1 slice of onion. 1 tablespoonful of rice or barley. Trim all fat from the chop or cutlet, place it in a sauce- pan, and cover with the stock or water. Season with pepper and salt and bring to the boil. Skin and add a small slice of onion chopped (if vegetable flavouring is allowed) and a tablespoonful of rice or pearl barley. Stew gently for about one hour and a half, until tender. Serve with a little of the gravy and rice round. If barley is used, it should be blanched first. GAME. Pheasant, partridge, or grouse, may be roasted by the same rules as for roast chicken. Or they may be stewed by the recipe for stewed chicken. Brown game is not so easily digested as chicken or pheasant, and for this reason is not so suitable for an invalid. LAMB OR MUTTON CUTLETS. Best end of neck of mutton. 1 egg. Breadcrumbs. 1 oz. of butter or lard to fry in. Chine the mutton, and saw the bones across about three inches in length. Trim away all fat, and remove the skin from the front of the bone. Beat up the egg, and season it with pepper and salt.

Take two quarts or more of strong second stock (p. 42) made from, bones; strain, and let it become cold. Remove all fat from the top. Put this stock into a saucepan with half a pint of cold water. Boil as rapidly as possible, skimming frequently to remove all scum. As the stock reduces it will become a clear brown glaze. When thick and clear strain into a jar. Useful for adding to diabetic soups, stews, or sauces. It sets when cold, and if covered with clarified butter will keep for some time. Meat glaze can be bought ready prepared. P

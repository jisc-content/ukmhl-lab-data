130 SICKEOOM COOKERY. Whisk all together until quite stiff. Pile up -in rocky- heaps on a dish, and, if liked, add one drop of cochineal to the last portion, and put it on top. Or the sponge may be set in a mould rinsed with cold water, and turned out when firm. JUNKET. 1 pint of milk. 1 teaspoonful of sugar. Junket powder, or 1 tablespoonful of essence of rennet. Heat the milk to the natural heat, 98Â° Fah. Put it into a glass bowl, add the sugar, and then put in the junket powder or essence of rennet. Allow it to stand perfectly still until set. It will take about an hour and a half. If junket powder is used, a measure is given with it, indi- cating the quantity of powder to be used. Junket is very nutritious, refreshing and digestible, useful for conva- lescents, and, in some cases, for fever patients. (Junket powder is generally preferable to the liquid essence, being more certain in its results.) MACARONI PUDDING. 2 oz. of macaroni. \ pint of milk. 1 oz. of sugar. 1 egg. Flavouring.

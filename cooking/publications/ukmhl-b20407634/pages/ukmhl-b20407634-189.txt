"HOW TO MAKE MALT INFUSION. " (Sir William Roberts Method.) " Mix three ounces of crushed malt thoroughly well with half a pint of cold water in a jug. Let the mixture stand over night. The supernatant liquid is then care- fully decanted off from the sediment, and strained through two or three folds of muslin, until it comes through fairly clear and bright. Malt infusion thus prepared has a light brown colour like sherry, a faint maltish taste, and the odour of beer-wort. It is prone to fermentation, and should be prepared fresh every day. " This method of preparing malt infusion is so simple, and the product so efficacious in aiding the digestion of gruel and farinaceous foods, that it should be regarded as a household remedy. It costs three farthings a pint. "MALTED GRUEL. " The gruel should be well boiled, and strained to separate the lumps. When cool enough to swallow, the malt infusion is added. One tablespoonful will digest half a pint of gruel. The action is very rapid ; in a few minutes the gruel becomes thin, from the conversion of the starch into maltose (Roberts). Other farinaceous foods, such as arrowroot, can be malted in the same way."

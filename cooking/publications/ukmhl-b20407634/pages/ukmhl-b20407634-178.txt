170 SOME POINTS ON THE PREPARATION OP POOD POR THE BOTTLE-PED 1 INPANT. By FRANK 0. MADDEN, F.R.C.S. (Medical Superintendent of the Hospital for Sick Children, Great Ormond Street). ! A perfectly plain, boat-shaped, glass bottle, fitted with a small indiarubber " teat " should be used. This must be kept scrupulously clean, washed and rinsed out in warm water, to which a little (baking) soda has been added, before and after using, while the teat must be similarly treated, turned inside out, and left in water (to which soda has been added) till required for use. Several teats should be at hand. If possible the infant should be fed at the breast, if only for a short time; but during the eighth month of life, or earlier if the weak state of the mother's health or other circumstances render it necessary, the child should be gradually weaned; at first, one meal a day of cow's milk, being substituted, till, by the end of the month, the breast is entirely withheld. If the mother's milk is insufficient for the needs of the growing child, a bottle, prepared as follows, should be given once or twice a day.

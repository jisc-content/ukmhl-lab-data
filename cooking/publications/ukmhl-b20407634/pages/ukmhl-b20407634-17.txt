9 SICKROOM COOKERY. it induces a feeling of fatigue and a distaste for exer- tion of any kind. When taken in small quantities at meals, it often stimulates tlie appetite and helps digestion. Water is the great carrier of nutrition to the body. It is a most important food, and without it none of the functions of the body could be carried on. It is of the first importance that water should be whole- some and pure. Unfortunately water is most liable to contamination from sewage matter. Decaying animal matter, leaky wells and imperfect drainage are all fruitful sources of contamination, and in this way the germs of typhoid, cholera and other diseases are disseminated. Every precaution should be taken to render the water harmless. Small reliance can be placed on filters, as even the best filtering material quickly becomes contaminated, and requires constant cleansing. In times of epidemic, in towns or countries where the drainage and sanitary arrangements are defective, there is but one course open—the water must be boiled. This destroys the germs and renders the water harmless. At the same time, by boiling, the water becomes flat and insipid. This may be remedied by the addition of a little lemon juice or lemonade made with the boiled water, or it can be used as tea, coffee, or cocoa. Gelatine.—If bones or other gelatinous matters are subjected to long boiling, gelatine is obtained. The exact value of gelatine is not known. It is very easily digested in the body. Gelatine cannot replace the albuminous foods in the repair of the tissues, but is an "albumen-sparing" food. "By the administration of gelatine very large quantities of albtimen can be spared in the body or devoted to increase of bulk." (Bauer.) Gelatine is most useful in sickroom cookery, as jellies

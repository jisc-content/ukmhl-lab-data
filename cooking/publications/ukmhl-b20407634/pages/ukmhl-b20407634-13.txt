5 SICKROOM COOKERY. those leading sedentary lives and unable to take much exercise. There is a popular fallacy that fish feeds the brain. This is quite erroneous. There is no particular constituent supplied by fish to the brain; at the same time, it is particularly suitable to brain workers and all those debarred from much exercise, being free from excess of fat, light, nourishing, and easy of digestion. Eggs are a very valuable food, containing all that is necessary for life in a most concentrated form. They contain much albumen, and a certain proportion of mineral matter and fat. The yolk of an egg is richer than the white. Eggs are easily digested when raw, but become insoluble when overcooked or hard-boiled. Both yolk and white of egg are most useful as sickroom bever- ages, combined with brandy, cream, or milk, and given as a stimulant between the times for more solid food. Milk is a perfect food, containing in itself all that is needed for the support of life. It supplies all that is necessary for children, or for people during periods of illness or inactivity. When hard work has to be done generally something supplying more solid bulk is needed. Milk contains a considerable proportion of casein (the albuminate in milk), milk fat, milk sugar, mineral salts, and water. Unfortunately, milk is extremely susceptible to con- tamination, thus conveying the germs of typhoid, scarlet fever, and other diseases. The fact that the milk cans have to be washed with water is quite sufficient, provided the water has been contaminated with sewage. All water for scouring milk cans should be boiled, thus materially lessening the risk. Milk, too, in times of epidemic should be boiled. This destroys any germs, renders the milk harmless, and at the same time more digestible.

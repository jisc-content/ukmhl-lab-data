SICKROOM COOKERY. 188 ALKALINE FOMENTATION OR STUPE. Put a handful of soda into the boiling water and proceed as in hot fomentations. This is useful in cases of rheumatism. Occasionally the part affected is steeped in strong soda and hot water. This has been found useful when the hand, foot, or any joint is stiff or crippled with rheumatism. Care must be taken to wrap it up well afterwards with cotton wool and flannel for fear of cold. COLD COMPRESS. J pint of iced water. 1 tablespoonful of vinegar, eau de Cologne, or spirit. Band of muslin or cambricj. Generally iced water is used. Occasionally a little vinegar or eau de Cologne is added. Fold the cambric in a band and dip in the lotion. Lay on the part affected. Use a piece of oilskin or mackintosh to prevent the pillow becoming wet. Renew as the band becomes warm. Use- ful to allay inflammation. Occasionally used in cases of severe headache. ICE BAG APPLICATION. Ice. An indiarubber bag or new sponge bag. Break the ice into small pieces and half fill an india- rubber bag with it. The bag should be gently placed on the affected part, and is often suspended by string from the head of the bed or nails in the wall to prevent the patient suffering from the weight. The water must be poured away and the ice renewed from time to time as it melts. To keep ice, wrap in a piece of coarse blanket or flannel and keep in a cool place.

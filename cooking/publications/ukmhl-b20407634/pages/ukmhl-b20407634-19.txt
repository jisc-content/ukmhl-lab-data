SICKROOM COOKERY. 11 CHAPTER II. (I) EFFECTS OF COOKING. (II) METHODS OF COOKING. (I.)â€”Effects of cooking on the foodstuffs (adapted from Halliburton). The object aimed at in cooking is to render food more digestible, and, what is most important, more palatable. (1.) Cooking destroys all germs and parasites, so preventing risk of infection from disease. (2.) With vegetable foods it breaks up the starch grains, bursting the thick outer coating of cellulose, and so allowing the digestive juices to come in contact with the granulose within; it also to some extent converts starch into dextrose, in which form carbohydrates are absorbed. (3.) With animal foods, it converts the insoluble connective tissue (collagen) into soluble gelatine, thus also allowing the fibres of the meat to be more accessible to the digestive juices. (4.) Produces various aromatic substances which more or less tend to aid digestion. (5.) On fats, the effect is to dissolve the fatty envelopes and set the fat free, when it can be more easily acted on by the digestive juices. Thus it will be seen the general effect of cooking is to render the food stuffs more wholesome and digestible, and at the same time more pleasant to the sight and taste.

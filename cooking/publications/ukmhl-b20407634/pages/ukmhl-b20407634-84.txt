SICKROOM COOKERY. 7G Place close to the fire for the first ten minutes to coagulate the albumen and seal up the outside of the meat, thus keeping the gravy in. Then draw the meat further from the fire, and allow it to cook at a lower degree of heat until done. Put two tablespoonfuls of dripping in the tin under- neath, and baste constantly. This will keep the meat mellow and prevent it from shrinking. When done, place on a hot dish, put this to keep warm, and make the gravy. As to time, allow quarter of an hour to each pound of meat and quarter of an hour over on the joint. This rule applies to beef and mutton. For a large thick piece of meat, without bone, allow twenty minutes to the pound and twenty minutes over on the joint. For pork or veal allow twenty minutes to each pound and twenty minutes over on the joint. Chicken or pheasant will take from three-quarters of an hour to one hour to roast. For very small pieces of meat a Dutch oven will be found convenient. RULES FOR MAKING GRAVY. Place the roast joint on a hot dish and put it to keep warm. Pour off all the dripping from the dripping tin into a small basin, draining it well, but carefully keeping back all the brown particles and sediment in the tin. Add a teacupful of boiling water and a little salt, and place over the fire. Stir this with an iron spoon until it boils up, crushing the brown scraps with the spoon. Strain carefully round the joint or serve in a sauceboat.

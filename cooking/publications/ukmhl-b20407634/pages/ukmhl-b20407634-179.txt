SICKROOM COOKERY. 171 The milk must be fresh, and must always be boiled, and to it, to start with, at least twice as much boiled water must be added, with a little white sugar to each bottle to take the " rawness " off the food. As the child grows, the proportion of water mast be diminished until eventu- ally pure boiled cow's milk is used, slightly sweetened as before. " One cow's " milk is rather to be avoided than not. No so-called "infant's food," or starchy food in any form, should be given, except under special circumstances by medical advice, before the child is seven months old. It is frequently necessary, especially in hot weather, or -when cow's milk disagrees, or curds are passed in the motions, to add to each bottle lime water or barley water in varying proportions; the lime water tending to prevent acid fermentation in the stomach, and the barley water the formation of large curds. A tablespoonful of cream may be added to each bottle for weakly infants, if it can be procured fresh. [Barley water is prepared by taking two teaspoonfuls of pearl barley to a pint of cold water, boiled down to two-thirds of a pint and then strained through muslin. This must be prepared at least twice a day.] The food must be prepared fresh for each bottle, and no food must be " warmed up " and used again. If, after a good trial, cow's milk does not agree, con- densed milk may be temporarily substituted. It must be diluted with water, the best proportion being one heaped- up teaspoonful to five tablespoonfuls of water, and a little cream may be added with benefit. This is only a tempo- rary expedient, and a return must be made to cow's milk as soon as practicable. Various special preparations are used by different authorities, directions for which will be included among

COOKING FOR INVALIDS. 86 is so intense that there is no fear of it discolouring unless it is cooked too long. Cook until it is quite tender, from 20 to 30 minutes, stirring frequently with a spoon. When ready, drain it well on a fine wire sieve, with a basin below it, and press out as much water as possible with the back of a wooden spoon. Then remove the basin, put a clean dry plate underneath the sieve, rub the spinach through the sieve on to this, and scrape the sieve well underneath. Return the spinach to a saucepan, with a small piece of butter, pepper, and salt if necessary. Stir over the fire until thoroughly hot, add a squeeze of lemon juice, and, if liked, a little cream; but do not make the spinach too moist. Arrange it in a neat pyramid on a hot dish, marking it up the sides with the back of a fork, and garnish round the base with small sippets of toast or fried bread. Spinach is a particularly wholesome vegetable, and very easy of digestion. A poached egg served on the top of it will make a nice dinner for an invalid. 89.â€”CELERY. Choose this fresh and crisp. If the outside leaves are coarse, do not use them for an invalid; they can be kept for flavouring other dishes. Cut away the root, separate the stalks, and choose some of the young ones from the centre. Wash and brush these well in cold water, and scrape off" any brown or discoloured parts with a knife.

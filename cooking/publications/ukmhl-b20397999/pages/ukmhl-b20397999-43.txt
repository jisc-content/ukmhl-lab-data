33 FISH. Uetliodâ€” Wipe the fish with a shghtly damp cloth, and cut it into neat sized pieces. Put the flour on a plate, and mix with it a little salt. Dip the pieces of fish in this, coating them very thinly and shaking all the loose flour ofi". This dries the fish, and makes it fi-y more easily. Have ready the egg, well beaten up on a plate, the yolk and white together; and also have ready a good supply of finely made bread crumbs on a sheet of paper. Take one piece of fish at a time; first put it into the beaten egg, brushing the egg all over it with a small brush, seeing that every part is well covered, other- wise it will look patchy. Then put it on the top of the bread crumbs, lifting it on a knife; toss the crumbs well over it, and press them on with the hands, shaking loose crumbs off. Put the piece of fish down on a board, and with a flat knife press the crumbs well on again, and make the sides of the fish tidy. When ready, place the piece of fish on a plate or tin with a piece of double kitchen paper on it, and proceed with each piece of fish in the same way. Have ready on the fire a saucepan half full of boiling fat (lard or clarified fat is the best). The fat is boiling when it is perfectly still, and a slight blue smoke is seen rising from it. Put the pieces of fish into this slowly one after the other; if too much is put in at one time, the fat gets cooled down so much that it soaks into the pieces of fish instead of making them crisp. c

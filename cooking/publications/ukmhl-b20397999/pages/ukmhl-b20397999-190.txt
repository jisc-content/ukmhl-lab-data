i8o COOKING FOR INVALIDS. 230.—TO CLEAN A TURNIP. Wash in cold water, and brush well with a vege- table brush. Then with a knife cut off the top, and peel rather thickly, as far as a yellow line which will be seen a little way in from the skin. The outside of the turnip is hard, indigestible, and bitter in flavour. Throw into clean cold water until wanted. 231.—TO CLEAN AN ONION. Cut off the root and top, and remove all the brown outside skin. Put the onion into a small basin with a pinch of salt or small piece of washing soda. Cover it with boiling water, and let it stand for, at least, five minutes. This draws out the unwholesome properties of the onion, and helps to make it more digestible. The water in which it soaks turns quite green in colour. 232.—TO BLANCH, AND TO SCALD. TO BLANCH. To put on in cold water, bring to the boil, and pour the water away. This is to whiten, or to facilitate the cleaning of anything. TO SCALD. Put into boiling water for a few minutes. To scald milk is to bring it almost to the boil.

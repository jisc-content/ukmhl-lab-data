Keep back any pieces of soft fat, but use the skin. Wash the neck well, and let it soak in cold water and salt for some time, to draw the blood from it. Open the gizzard, and remove the bag of stones from the inside, then wash it well, pulling off all the fat skin from the outside. Remove the gall bag very carefully from the liver, cutting it away with a pair of scissors, and wash the liver well. Also wash the heart, and scald the feet by letting them soak in boiling water for a short time, and then scrape them well. Take a clean lined saucepan—a deep one is best— and put into it the meat, bones, skin, neck, liver, gizzard, heart, and feet. Add the salt and enough cold water to well cover all. The quantity of water depends upon the size of the fowl used. Put the lid on the pan, and bring this slowly to the boil, then skim several times until the broth looks quite clear. Allow the broth to simmer slowly from 4 to 5 hours, until all the goodness is extracted from the meat, bones, etc.; skimming when necessary. Then strain through a fine strainer or hair sieve, and let it stand till cold. Then remove all the fat from the top, return the broth to a saucepan, and thicken according to taste.

97 PUDDINGS 6r» SWEETS. 103.—RICE STEWED WITH MILK. Ingredleuts- I oz. whole rice, r teaspoonful sugar. % pint of milk. Method- Well wash the rice, and cook it in exactly the same way as in last recipe; allowing it to simmer until it has absorbed all the milk, and is of a thick pulpy consistency. Sweeten to taste, and serve with stewed fruit. Another way of stewing rice is to cook it in a jar. Wash the rice thoroughly, and put it into a clean jar with the milk and sugar, but with no water. Cover the jar with a lid or greased paper, and place it in a saucepan with boiling water to come half way up the sides. Allow it to steam at least one hour. This plan is a very convenient one, as the rice requires no attention; there is no fear of it burning, and it is kept clean. Other grains, such as sago, tapioca, and semolina, can be cooked in the same way. If fruit is being stewed to serve with it, it may be put into another jar, and steamed in the same sauce- pan. (See recipes Nos. 121-127.) Time—\ hour in a pan, 1 hour in a jar. Probable cost, l^d. G

INTRODUCTORY. vi variety should be studied as far as possible. Even when only a restricted diet is permissible, a little difference in the manner of serving may help to tempt the invalid's appetite. No food should be cooked or prepared in the invalid's presence when avoidable. In all cookery the main object is to present food in its most digestible form, and this is especially necessary in invalid cookery. A secondary and important object is to present it in its most tempting form. Untouched food should never be left in an invalid's room, but put aside in a cool place. If serving the same portion a second time, let it be in a different form. Patients should not as a rule be consulted about their meals, but a nurse should tactfully try to discover their likes and dislikes, and exercise some forethought to see that these are provided for. All dishes, spoons, &c., for an invalid's use, should be scrupulously clean and bright, and arranged neatly on a tray with a spotless tray- cloth, and when obtainable, a few flowers. Every such little attention helps to brighten an invalid's life, and often tempts a feeble appetite.

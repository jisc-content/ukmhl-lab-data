CHAPTER VI.—JELLIES—SWEET AND SAVOURY. INTRODUCTORY REMARKS. Jellies are often very acceptable to invalids, being cooling and easily taken. They should never be hard and stiff, but should melt easily in the mouth and require no mastication. Many people think they must always go to the trouble of making jelly from a calf s foot for an invalid. In reality, this is no better than jelly made from gelatine, provided the gelatine is pure. Whether the jelly is made from stock, made from a foot, or from gelatine, these in themselves are of little or no value, but rather a vehicle for conveying other forms of nourishment. The French sheet of gelatine is to be recommended for making jellies. It dissolves easily, has little taste, and is very moderate in price. Isinglass, which is also used for stiffening jellies, is the purest form of gelatine. It is made from the bladder of the sturgeon, and is more expensive than gelatine. It is frequently given to invalids, a little being dissolved in any of their warm drinks. Great care and cleanliness are required in the making of jellies; but, if the following directions are closely followed, the jellies cannot fail to be clear, and it should not be found such a difficult process. ti9

COOKING FOR INVALIDS. 90 94.â€”MACARONI. Break the macaroni into short lengths, and throw it into a saucepan of freshly boiling water, with salt in it. Boil quickly with the lid off the pan, until it has thoroughly swelled and is quite tender. Stir it occasionally with a spoon, to prevent it stick- ing. The time will depend upon the kind of macaroni used. The large pipe will take about hour, the smaller twisted kind very much longer. Keep plenty of water over it, and, if it boils down, add more boiling water. When ready, drain, and this may either be served plain, along with meat, or it may be put back into the saucepan with enough stock to cover, and allowed to stew for half-an-hour longer. The pulp of a fresh tomato, rubbed through a sieve, may also be added to this.

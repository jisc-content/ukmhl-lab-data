PUDDINGS &' SWEETS. loi 109.—PEAKL BARLEY PUDDING, Ingredients— I oz. pearl barley. '/2 pint milk. I teaspoonful sugar. Flavouring (if wished). Method— Wash the barley, put it into a saucepan, and cover well with cold water. Bring this to the boil, pour the water off, and then rinse the barley thoroughly. This blanching makes the barley a better colour. Put it into a basin with the milic, cover it, and let it stand over night if possible. Rinse out a small lined saucepan with cold water, and put the barley and milk into it. Simmer over the fire until the barley is quite soft —from 5i to I hour. If not previously soaked, it will take very much longer. If it becomes too thick, add milk, and stir frequently. V/hen ready, remove from the fire, and sweeten and flavour to taste. When slightly cooled, add the yolk of the egg, and lastly the white beaten to a stiff froth, mixing it lightly but thoroughly in. Pour the mixture into a small greased pie dish, wipe round the edges of the dish, and bake in a moderate oven until nicely browned. Sprinkle with sugar, and serve hot. Time—1 to 1^ hours after soaking. Probable cost, 3d. 110.—GROUND BARLEY PUDDING. Make according to recipe No. 99 (Semolina Pud- ding), using ground barley instead of semolina.

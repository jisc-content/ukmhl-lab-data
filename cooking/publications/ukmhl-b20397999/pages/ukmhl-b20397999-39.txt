FISH. -BOILED HADDOCK. KeoLtiired— I haddock (small). I teaspoonfiil of vinegar or a squeeze of lemon juice. ]^ teaspoonful salt. 2 pints water. MetlLOd— Buy the fish with the skin on it, as the skin protects the fish.* As a rule, the inside of the fish is removed by the fishmonger; but, if not, open it, and take out the gills and all the inside parts. Wash the fish well, scraping the skin with a knife from the tail upwards to remove all the scales. Wash the part where the inside has been taken out, removing any of the thin black skin which may be left, and which would impart a very bitter flavour to the fish. Cut off the fins, using a pair of scissors, and cutting from the tail upwards ; take out the eyes, and wash the sockets well. Then truss the fish in the shape of the letter S, using a skewer or a needle and fine string to do so. Have on the fire a small fish kettle or a stewpan, with about 2 pints of water freshly boiled in it. Do not use the water from a hot-water pipe for cooking purposes, but always boil it fresh. Add the salt and vinegar or lemon juice to the water, and let it simmer slowly. The acid in the water helps to keep the fish white and firm. * A filleted fish would be quite tasteless if boiled. Haddock is the most suitable fish for boiling for an invalid; the flat fish are too flivour- less, and cod is not so digestible, although sometimes it might laake a nice change.

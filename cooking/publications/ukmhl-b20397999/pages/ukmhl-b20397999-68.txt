58 COOKING FOR INVALIDS. Then add the bread crumbs, and stir over the fire for a few minutes until the bread crumbs swell, and the mixture thickens. Lift out the mace, and put the panada into a mortar, with the minced meat; pound well together, and rub through a fine wire sieve. Scrape under the sieve. Put the mixture into a basin, and add the seasoning. Whisk the cream in a small basin with a fork until thick, and beat up the white of egg stiffly on a plate. Add both these to the meat mixture, and stir them lightly in with an iron spoon. Pour into a well greased basin or mould, not filling it more than three parts full (as the mixture rises), and cover over the top with a piece of greased white paper. Place this in a saucepan, with a plate or saucer at the foot of it, and enough boiling water to come half way up the sides of the basin or mould. Put the lid on the pan, and steam very slowly from 20 to 30 minutes, until the cream is well risen and firm to the touch. The plate or saucer at the foot of the pan is to raise the cream above the great heat of the foot of the saucepan. The water round it must only be allowed to simmer very gently, and if it boils away more must be added. On lifting out, allow the cream to stand for a minute or two, to let some of the steam escape, or it is apt to crack. Loosen round the edges, and turn carefully out on to a hot dish. White sauce (see page 31) may be served over or round it if wished. Time—20 to 30 minutes. Probable cost—veal, 7d. or Sd. ; ohioken, Is. to Is. 3d.

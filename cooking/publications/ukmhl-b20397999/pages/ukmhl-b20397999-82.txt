72 COOKING FOR INVALIDS. Time—1 to 2 hours. Probable cost. Is. to la. 4d. 70.—BROILED PIGEON OB PARTRIDGE. See Broiled Chicken, page 69. They will require rather a shorter time to cook. 71.—STEWED PIGEON. Required— I pigeon. J!^ oz. butter. Yz pint stock. Yz teaspoonful flour. Pepper and salt. Yz slice toast. Method— Prepare and truss the pigeon as for roasting, and coat it over with the flour. Melt the butter in a small stewpan. When smoking hot, put in the pigeon, and brown it on all sides. Keep turning it over with a spoon, so that it may get a uniform brown colour all over. Then lift it on to a plate, and pour away all the grease that is left in the pan. Pour in the stock, and let it become warm over the fire, and then return the pigeon. Put the lid on the pan, and allow the bird to stew very gently from i to 2 hours, according to age and size. Sometimes a much longer time will be required. When about half cooked, turn the pigeon over on to its other side. When quite tender, lift it out on to a neat square of toast, and remove the trussing string from it. Reduce the gravy in the pan by allowing it to boil quickly without the lid, until there is just enough left for serving. Keep it well skimmed, that it may be quite free from grease, and then pour it round the pigeon. Garnish with a sprig of parsley or a little watercress.

COOKING FOR INVALIDS. 66 Draw the fowl according to directions given on page 60. TO TRUSS A FOWL FOR BOILING. The legs must be cut off at the knee joint. To do this, cut the skin round the leg at that part, crack the joint, and pull the piece of leg off, bringing the sinews with it. Put the first finger through the hole made for draw- ing the fowl, and loosen all the outside skin from the flesh of the thighs, and push the leg joints inside. Push the rump also inside, and draw the skin over, to close up the opening. Then commence trussing as for a roast fowl, except that, instead of tying the string round the rump, the string is put twice round the narrow end of the fowl, and tied very tightly, to prevent the legs slipping upwards and breaking through the skin. 64.â€”TO BOIL A FOWL. First rub the fowl over with a piece of cut lemon, and wrap it up in greased paper to keep it a good colour. Have ready on the fire a saucepan of freshly boiling water, or, better still, some white stock or meat boilings. Put the fowl into this with a little salt, and allow it to simmer slowly from i to i| hours, according to its age and size. Only half the fowl need be boiled at one time, but the same length of time will be required. The fowl must be cooked very slowly, or it will become hard and tasteless.

COOKING FOR INVALIDS. 210.—TO SKIN AND FILLET A SOLE OR PLAICE. TO SKIN. First wash the fish, and cut off all the fins. Lay the fish on a board with the tail-end nearest to you. Make a cut across the skin just above the tail, slip a knife under it, and commence raising the skin from the flesh. Then with the right thumb loosen the skin all the way up the right-hand side. Loosen up the other side in the same way, this time using the thumb of the left hand. Hold the tail of the fish firmly down on the board ; take hold of the loosened skin with a cloth, and pull it off quickly, drawing it upwards towards the head. The white skin may be removed in the same way, but this is frequently left on. TO FILLET. To fillet the fish, make a cut straight down the middle of the back to the back bone. Then remove the flesh first from one side, and then from the other. Two fillets are taken from each side. It will be found easiest to raise the first fillet from the left-hand side of the fish, working from the head towards the tail; and then turn the fish round, and to raise the second fillet, working from the tail towards the head. Turn the fish right over, and do the other side in the same way. Uoie.—Filleting is really best learnt by watching a fishmonger or other competent person at work.

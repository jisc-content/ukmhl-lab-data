123 COOKING FOR INVALIDS. Then roll the lemons on the table to soften them, cut them in halves, and squeeze out the juice. Strain this, and measure i gill, which will take from three to four lemons. Wash the eggs before breaking them, separate the yolks very carefully from the whites, and crush up the shells. Add the lemon rind and juice, and the whites and shells of eggs, to the other ingredients in the sauce- pan, and put the pan on the fire. The pan should not be more than half full, as the jelly is very apt to boil over. Take a wire whisk, and whisk the jelly over the fire until a good froth rises on it, and it is just beginning to boil. If it is whisked after it comes to the boil, the scum is driven down through it again. Watch the jelly carefully, and let it boil up as high as it will without boiling over. Then draw the pan gently to one side of the fire, where it will keep warm without simmering, and cover it over with a lid or plate. Let it stand for lo minutes, and then strain. Any kind of cloth will do for straining it through, so long as it is not too close in texture and is kept for the purpose. Cheese cloth is what is generally bought for jelly cloths. Tie the cloth to a jelly stand, or the four legs of a kitchen chair turned upside down, and let it sink in the middle so as to form a bag. Have ready two basins and some boiling water. Pour the water through the cloth into one of the basins, so as to heat it thoroughly, and then put the dry basin underneath, and pour away the water.

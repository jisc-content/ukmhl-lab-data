51 MEAT. Place the chop on it, and grill over or in front of the fire, turning it every minute or two until the chop is cooked sufficiently. The time for cooking depends very much upon individual taste, and also upon the thickness of the chop. It is more digestible underdone than over- done. The outside should be well browned, and the inside red and juicy. When turning the chop use a pair of steak tongs or two knives, or a fork stuck into the fat of the meat. Never stick a fork into the meat itself, or it will let out the juices. If the chop appears to be cooking too quickly, raise the gridiron, or remove it a little distance from the fire. In lifting the chop from the gridiron, place it on a very hot plate. A chop, to taste well, must be served up at once. A small pat of maitre d'hotel butter (see recipe No. 196) may be placed on the top, or a little ketchup may be served with it, if allowed. Note. —Never warm up a chop for an invalid.

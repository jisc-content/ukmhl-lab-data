MEAT. Time—1 to 1^ hoars. Probable cost, la. to Is. 6d. 72.—BOILED RABBIT. Reanlred— I rabbit. I % teaspoonful salt. About I pint warm water. | }i pint white sauce. Blethod— First wash the rabbit thoroughly in tepid water; then dry it, and cut it into neat joints. Put these on in a saucepan, with cold water to cover them; bring to the boil, and then throw the water away. Rinse the joints of rabbit in cold water, to remove any scum that may have settled on them. This process blanches the rabbit, and takes away any unpleasantly strong flavour from it. Rinse out the saucepan; put the pieces of rabbit back into it, with the salt, and pint of warm water, or enough to cover the rabbit. Bring to the boil, and then simmer slowly from i to hours, or until tender. Remove any scum that may rise on the surface. Have some white sauce made in readiness, either entirely of milk, or partly with some of the water in which the rabbit was cooked (see page 31). Lift the joints of rabbit out on to a hot dish, and pour the sauce over them. Note.—Part only of the rabbit need be cooked at one time. The other half might be stewed or made into rabbit soup. In the latter case, choose the best joints for stewing, and use the inferior ones for the soup. A small piece of celery or onion may be cooked with the rabbit. Small rolls of bacon (see page 65) may be served round the dish.

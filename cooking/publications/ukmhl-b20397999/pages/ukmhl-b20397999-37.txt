FISH. 27 Sprinkle with a little salt and white pepper, if it is allowed, and squeeze over some lemon juice, which helps to keep the fish firm and white, and also aids digestion. Be careful to let none of the lemon seeds drop. Cover the fish with a piece of greased white paper, and then with a lid or basin. Place this over a pan half full of boiling water, seeing that the plate fits well on the pan. Let the water underneath boil quickly, so that there may be plenty of steam, and cook from 20 to 30 minutes, until the fish loses its clear, transparent appearance, and looks quite white. If the pieces are thick, it will be better to turn them once during cooking. The liquid that is on the plate when the fish is cooked is the juice from the fish, and should be served with it. If a nice dish is chosen to cook the fish on, it may be served up on the same. Dry the plate or dish underneath, remove the paper, and wipe round the edges. This is the lightest and simplest mode of cooking fish for an invalid. Sometimes a white sauce is made (see recipe No. 29), and poured over it. The liquid in this case should be added to the sauce. With sauce it is richer, and not so digestible. If no sauce is used, serve the fish v.-ith a little plain cold butter and a piece of plain bread. Time—20 to 30 minutes. Protoatole cost—whiting or haddock, 3d. or 4d.; sole, 9d. to Is. 6d.

APPENDIX. 183 and there is a soft piece left in the middle, the un- toasted part is less digestible than plain bread. Put the toast on a toasting fork, and hold it at a little distance from a clear, bright fire. Let it slowly dry, and become a nice uniform brown colour, without being at all black. Then turn, and toast the second side in the same way. Stand it on end until cold, and serve at once. If kept for any length of time, it becomes tough. 239.â€”TO SKIN AND FILLET A HADDOCK. TO SKIN. First wash it in cold water, and cut off all the fins. Make a slit in the skin up both sides, so that it can easily be removed. Make a cut across the skin just below the head, and commence at the flap part. Loosen the skin there, keeping down the flesh with a knife, and beginning very carefully; then pull down- wards towards the tail. Turn, and do the other side in the same way. TO FILLET. To fillet it, remove the flesh cleanly from the bones on both sides of the fish. Commence at the open side of the fish, slipping the knife along close to the bone and laying the flesh backwards, but do not separate it from the other side. Turn, and do the other side in the same way. A filleted haddock should be in one piece.

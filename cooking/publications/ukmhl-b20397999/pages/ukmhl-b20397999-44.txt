34 COOKING FOR INVALIDS. Time—10 to 12 minutes. Probable cost, 3d. or 4d. Allow the fish to fry until the pieces are a nice brown colour, then lift them out with a spoon—a perforated one is best—and let the fat drain well from them. Put them back on the piece of double paper, so that any grease about them may be absorbed. Serve the fish up on a dish with a d'oyley or dish paper under it, decorating it with a sprig of parsley; or send up two or three pieces on the invalid's plate. One or two thin slices of lemon may be served with it. Notes.—Fried fish, when well done, should look quite dry, crisp, and of a pretty brown colour. Although it is not by any means the most digestible way of cooking fish, still it may be given to patients who do not suffer from a weak digestion. Fish that is greasy and badly fried is one of the most unwholesome of dishes. There should be sufficient fat in the pan to completely cover the fish. The fat should be strained after using, and if care is taken it may be used many times and will keep for weeks. Biscuit or rusk crumbs may be used instead of bread crumbs for coating the fish. Time—5 to 7 minutes. Probable cost—sole, 9d. to Is. 6d. ; haddock, or plaice, 4d. to 6d. 33.—FRIED WHITING. Whiting are best skinned and fried whole. Prepare them in the same way as the filleted fish, and, after egging and bread-crumbing them, pull the tail through the eye. They will take rather a longer time to cook than the small pieces of fish.

i8 19.—CREAM OF BAKLEY. Ingredients— 1 Yz lb. knuckle of veal. 2 oz. pearl barley. 3 pints cold water. Method— Wash the barley well, and, if possible, soak it over- night in cold water. Then blanch—i.e., put it into a saucepan with enough cold water to well cover it, bring to the boil, pour the water away, and rinse the barley. This malces the barley a very much better colour. Wipe the meat with a damp cloth, cut it down into very small pieces away from the bone, and put it into a saucepan with the water, salt, and blanched barley. Bring slowly to the boil, and skim well. Simmer slowly 5 to 6 hours until the barley is perfectly soft. Then strain through a hair or fine wire sieve. Put the meat and barley into a mortar, pound it well, and then rub a good deal of it through a wire sieve, using some of the liquid to moisten it while rubbing through. Return the liquid and the sieved mixture to the saucepan, and re-heat over the fire. Beat up the yolk of egg and cream together ; draw the pan to the side of the fire, so that the soup may be off the boil, and strain this thickening into it, stirring all the time. Do not boil again. Time—5 to 6 bours. Probable cost. Is. 3d. I teaspooniul salt. I yolk of egg. gill cream.

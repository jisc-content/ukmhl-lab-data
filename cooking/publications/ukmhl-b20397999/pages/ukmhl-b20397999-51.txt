IHCetliod— Weigh the fish free from skin and bone, and shred it down finely with a knife. Put it into a mortar, and pound it well. Rinse out a small saucepan with cold water to prevent the mixture sticking to it. Put into it the butter and the milk, and let the butter melt over the fire. Then add the bread crumbs, and stir with a wooden spoon over the fire until the bread crumbs swell and the mixture thickens. Add this mixture to the fish in the mortar, pound well together, and rub through a wire sieve, scraping the sieve well underneath. Put the mixture into a basin, and season to taste. Put the white of egg on to a plate, and beat it up to a stiff froth with a knife. Put the cream into a smaller basin, and whisk it with a fork until thick. Add both these to the fish mixture, and stir them in as light as possible with an iron spoon. Mix them lightly, and, at the same time, thoroughly. Pour the mixture into a small basin, greased out with clarified butter (see recipe No. 236). The basin must not be more than three parts filled. Twist over the top of it a piece of greased kitchen paper.

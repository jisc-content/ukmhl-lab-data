CHAPTER II.â€”FISH. INTRODUCTORY REMARKS. Fish is a very valuable article of diet; it is the lightest form of solid food. It is less satisfying and less stimulating than meat, and for these reasons is often ordered for invalids before they are strong enough to take butcher meat. Fish contains valuable minerals, such as phosphate of lime, potash, and soda, which are all very necessary in our diet, as helping to form and solidify bone. In buying fishj choose those which are really in season and most plentiful, as they are then in best condition. Be most particular to choose perfectly fresh fish. The eyes should be bright and prominent, the gills red, the flesh firm and well covered with scales. There should be little or no smell, and that not disagreeable. The whiting is perhaps the most suitable for an invalid. It is very delicate in flavour and in fibre, and is sometimes called "the chicken of the sea." Haddock, plaice, and sole are also suitable. The haddock has more flavour, but is coarser grained than the whiting. Soles are not always easily got, and are a more expensive fish. Halibut and turbot are also good fish, and easy of digestion, but the fibre of them is firmer, and they are better cooked in larger pieces.

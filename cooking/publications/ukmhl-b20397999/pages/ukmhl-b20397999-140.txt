I30 COOKING FOR INVALIDS. MEAT JELLIES. 112.—CHICKEN JELLY. A few parsley stalks. A pinch of salt. Required— I chicken, or part of one. Cold water. I bay leaf. Method— If the chicken is not drawn, see directions on page 60. The inferior joints will do very well for chicken jelly; the breast can be used for some other purpose. Cut the chicken into joints, and cut all the flesh from the bones. Wash any part that does not look perfectly clean, and keep back any fat. Cut the flesh into small pieces, and chop up the bones. The neck and gizzard may also be v/ashed, and used in the jelly, but not the liver, as it is too dark in colour. Put all into a lined saucepan with a little salt, and cover with cold water; bring to the boil, and skim well. Add the bay leaf and parsley stalks, and simmer slowly for from 3 to 4 hours. Keep it well skimmed, and add more water if it boils down too much. When ready, strain through a hair sieve, and stand till cold. Remove all fat from the top, first with a spoon dipped in hot water, and then with a cloth dipped in boiling water. This may now be served as it is, or it may be cleared.

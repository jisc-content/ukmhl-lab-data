30 COOKING FOR INVALIDS. Time—10 to 16 minutes. Probable cost, 2d. to 4d. If there is a drainer belonging to the fish kettie, place the fish on that with the back uppermost, and lower it into the water. If using a stewpan, put a saucer or plate at the foot of the pan, or tie the fish in a piece of muslin so that it can be easily lifted out. Put the lid on the pan, and let the fish cook slowly until ready—from lo to 15 minutes for a small haddock. When ready, the skin will begin to crack, and the flesh slip from the bones. Lift the fish out of the water, and let it drain for a few minutes. Never let fish remain in water after it is ready, as it makes it very insipid. If it has to be kept warm for a short time, keep it on the drainer placed across the fish kettle, with a cloth or lid over it, or on a plate over a pan of hot water. Serve this fish plain, with a little cold butter, served separately, or with white sauce. (See page 31.) Draw out the skewer or thread before serving. If sent up to the invalid whole, dish it on a small assiette, with a folded serviette or fringed doyly under it, and decorate with a sprig of fresh parsley. Or cut the fish into two or three neat pieces, keeping back the head, and sending up just what the invaUd is Ukely to take, dishing on a dinner- plate, and putting on a cover.

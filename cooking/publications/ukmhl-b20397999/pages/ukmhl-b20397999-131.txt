JELLIES. 121 Stock to stand until it is quite cold, when it should be a stiff jelly. The pieces of foot may be put on again with cold water to cover them, and a second stock taken off as before. TO MAKE AND CLEAR THE JELLY. Proportions— I pint stock. I gill lemon juice. I gill sherry wine. 6 oz. loaf sugar. 3 cloves. 1%, inches stick of cinnamon. %. gill brandy. Rind of 2 lemons. 2 whites and shells of eggs. Method— First remove every particle of grease from the top of the stock. To do this, have a basin of boiling water and two metal spoons. Heat the spoons in the water, and use first one and then the other to skim off the fat. When as much as possible has been removed with the spoons, dip a cloth into boiling water, and wipe over the surface of the stock. Then make up the jelly in the above proportions. This will not use all the stock; but, unless a large quantity of jelly is wanted, it is better not to make too much at one time. The stock will keep for a few days in cool weather, and can be made up as required. Take a clean Uned saucepan, rinse it out with cold water, and put into it the stock, sugar, sherry wine, cloves, and cinnamon stick. Wipe the lemons with a damp cloth, and peel the rind very thinly off two of them. Do not peel off any of the white part, as this would give the jelly a bitter taste.

CHAPTER III.â€”MEAT. INTBODTTCTOBY REMARKS. As a general rule, fowl comes first in order of digestibility, and then game, but they rank very closely together. Game has much more flavour, and for that very reason it may suit some invalids better than chicken, which is a favourite article of diet. Game is more of a stimulant to the appetite. The flesh from the breast and wing of a chicken is considered the best part of a fowl. Game which has the least fat about it, such as pheasant, partridge, grouse, or woodcock, is the best. Pigeons may form a nice variety. Ducks and geese must not be given; they are too rich on account of their fat. Rabbit is not quite so digestible as chicken, and is not considered of very much value. Of the other meats the most digestible is first mutton, and then beef. Veal and lamb are less stimulating; but, as the fibre of them is very gelatinous, it eludes thorough mastication, and they are therefore not so digestible. Pork is quite unsuitable, although bacon is some- times allowed. Sweetbreads (both heart and throat), if plainly cooked, form a very suitable diet. Tripe is very easy of digestion, but requires careful preparation and long cooking. D

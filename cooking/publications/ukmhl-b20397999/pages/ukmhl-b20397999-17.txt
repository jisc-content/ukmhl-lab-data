MEAT TEAS, BROTHS, SOUPS. 5 In some cases clear beef tea is ordered, the small particles of beef being too heavy for the patient's digestion. In this case strain through a hair sieve or piece of muslin. Salt is sometimes not allowed. Time—3 hours. Probable cost. Is. 2d. 2—QUICKLY-MADE BEEF TEA. Proportions— I lb. lean, juicy beef. I i small teaspoonful salt. I pint cold water. | Method— Prepare the meat in the same way as in previous recipe. Put it into a basin with the salt and water, stir it well up, cover the basin with a plate, and, if time permits, let it stand for half-an-hour. In this way the juice is well drawn from the meat before the beef tea is put on to cook. Then pour all the contents of the basin into a clean lined saucepan, place the pan over rather a slow fire, and, with two forks placed back to back, whisk it well until it almost reaches boiling point. Then draw the pan to the side of the fire, put on the lid, and allow the beef tea to simmer as slowly as possible from ten to twelve minutes. Strain and remove the fat from the top in the same way as for ordinary beef tea. This method of making beef tea does not extract so much goodness from the meat as that cooked in a jar for a longer time, but some people prefer it made in this way, and when it is required hurriedly this plan must be adopted. The greatest care must be taken that it does not boil. Time—about f hour. Probable cost. Is. 2d.

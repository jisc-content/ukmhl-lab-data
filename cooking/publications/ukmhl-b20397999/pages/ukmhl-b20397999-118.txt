io8 COOKING FOR INVALIDS. Then pour on the milk, and stir over the fire until the mixture boils and thickens. This is called a panada, and it is very important that it should be thoroughly cooked, otherwise it will not bind the souffle together. When ready, it should draw away from the sides of the pan. Remove the pan from the fire, add the sugar, lemon rind and juice, and the yolks, one at a time, beating each one well into the mixture. Beat up the whites to a stiff froth, and stir them lightly in at the end. Pour the mixture into a basin or plain mould, that has been well greased with clarified butter, and do not more than half fill it. Lay a piece of greased paper over the top, and steam very gently for about 20 minutes. The souffld should be well risen, and firm to the touch. Let it stand for a minute or two, then turn it out, sprinkle with sugar, and serve immediately. Time—4 hour. Probable cost, 5d. 119.—PLAIN SUET PUDDING. I teaspoonful sugar. About I gill cold water.

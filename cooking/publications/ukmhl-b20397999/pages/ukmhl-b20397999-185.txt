CHAPTER X.—POULTICES AND FOMENTATIONS. INTRODUCTORY REMARKS. The making of poultices requires neatness, practice, and speed. All fomentations and poultices should be removed, or renewed before they become cold. When poultices or fomentations are no longer required, the part treated should be wiped dry with a soft cloth, and a piece of flannel or cotton wool should be applied, to prevent poultice rash. RECIPES. 219.—LINSEED MEAL POULTICE. Required— Linseed meal. Boiling water. A piece of flannel. Some thin muslin. A small basin and spatula. Method— Heat the basin thoroughly by pouring boiling water into it, and also heat the spatula. Empty the basin, and then pour into it the quantity of boiling water required for making the poultice. Sift in the meal through the fingers, stirring all the time with the spatula. '75

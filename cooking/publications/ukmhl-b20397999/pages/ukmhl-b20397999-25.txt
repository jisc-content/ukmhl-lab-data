MEAT TEAS, BROTHS, SOUPS. 15 Place the jar in a saucepan, with cold water to come fully half way up; put the lid on the pan, and simmer slowly from 6 to 7 hours. If the water boils down, add more. When cooked sufficiently, remove the jar from the saucepan, and strain all the liquid away from the chicken through a fine strainer or hair sieve. This is just the pure juice or essence of chicken, and, like essence of beef, should only be given in small quantities in extreme cases. When cold, it will be a jelly. Time—6 to 7 hours. Probable cost, 2s. ed. 15.—CHICKEN SOUP. Ingredients— I dessertspoonful salt. I gill of cream. 1 chicken. 2 to 3 pints cold water. Method— Draw and clean the chicken thoroughly (see page 60), then cut it into joints, and, if wished, keep back the breast for serving in some other way. Cut up the flesh into small pieces, and break the bones. Wash any pieces which do not look perfectly clean, and keep back any soft fat. Remove the gall bag from the liver, and the bag of stones from the gizzard, and wash these well; also the neck and heart. Put all together into a clean lined pan, with enough cold water to well cover—from 2 to 3 pints; add a little salt, and bring slowly to the boil. Then skim well, and simmer slowly about 5 or 6 hours.

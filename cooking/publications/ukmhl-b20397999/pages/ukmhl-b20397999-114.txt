I04 COOKING FOR INVALIDS. The water in the tin tempers the heat, and prevents the custard from curdh'ng. When cooking a larger custard, it is a good plan to keep adding a little cold water occasionally, so that the water in the tin may never get too hot. Do not shake the custard when it is put into the oven, or it will become perforated. A perfect custard should be the same throughout. When ready, lift out, sprinkle with sugar, and serve hot or cold. Stewed fruit is nice served along with it. The custard can be made richer by using yolks of eggs alone. Three yolks to i|- gills of milk. A thin slice of sponge cake, or a water biscuit, may be placed on the top of the custard before baking. This makes the pudding a little more substantial, and soaks up the watery part of the egg.

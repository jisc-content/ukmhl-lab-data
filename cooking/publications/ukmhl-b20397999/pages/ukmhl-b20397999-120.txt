COOKING FOR INVALIDS. Plunge the pudding into the saucepan of boiling water, having enough to cover it, and boil quickly for two hours at least. The pudding must never be allowed to go off the boil, or it will be heavy. When ready, Uft it out, let it stand for a minute or two, then turn out, and serve on a hot dry plate. Notes.—Milk may be used instead of water for mixing. Sometimes an egg is added; then less water is required. Beef suet is richer than mutton, but not so digestible. A suet pudding, when well made and thoroughly cooked, is considered very wholesome. Time—2 hours. Probable cost, 3d. 120.-SWEET OMELET. Ingredients— 2 eggs. % oz. sugar. A little flavouring. I tablespoonful raspberry or strawberry jam. Method— Take a small frying or omelet pan, grease it out well with clarified butter, and let the butter set on it. Put the yolks of eggs, sugar, and flavouring into a medium sized basin, and work them well together with a wooden spoon, until of a creamy consistency and pale in the colour. Put the white on to a fiat dinner plate, add a pinch of salt to them, and, with a broad-bladed knife or spatula, beat them to a stiff froth. They should be so stiff that you can turn the plate upside down with- out their falling off. Then with an iron spoon stir them lightly in among the yolks and sugar.

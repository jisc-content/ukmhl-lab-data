COOKING FOR INVALIDS. i6 Take off any scum that may rise, and boil down to about half the quantity. When cooked sufficiently, strain through a fine strainer or hair sieve, and let it stand till cold. Remove all the fat from the top of the stock. Take some of the pieces of meat from the chicken, pound them well in a mortar, and then rub through a wire sieve, using some of the liquid to moisten it while rubbing through. Add this meat puree to the soup as a thickening. Warm up as much as will be required at one time, and add one tablespoonful of cream to each cupful of soup. A yolk of egg may also be used if liked. Beat up the yolk in the cup or basin, and pour the hot soiip on to it, stirring all the time. The addition of a little celery seed and a small ham bone will improve the flavour of this soup, should the condition of the invalid allow of it. The breast of the chicken may be cooked in the soup, and then lifted out, cut into small neat pieces, and served in the soup when ready. Time—5 to 6 bours. Probable cost, 3s. 16.—BICE SOUP.

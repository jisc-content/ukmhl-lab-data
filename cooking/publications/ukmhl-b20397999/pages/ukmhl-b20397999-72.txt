62 COOKING FOR INVALIDS. Wash these with the neck, remove any fat skin from them, and let them soak in salt and water for some time, after which they can be used for making stock for gravy, or to help with chicken or giblet soup. Wipe the fowl with a damp cloth, first outside and then inside. If not clean with this, the water from the pipe may be run through it; but when the fowl has to be roasted, it is better not to be wet too much, as it takes away the flavour and prevents it browning so well. Remove any soft fat that may be left in the inside, especially at the vent and near the neck, and also cut away the oil bag which lies at the back of the rump or "parson's nose." (This contains the oil with which the fowl oils its feathers, and it frequently becomes rancid, and if left on will give the fowl a bad taste.) 59.â€”TO TRUSS A FOWL FOR ROASTING. The legs, for roasting, are cut off just a little above the feet. Cut carefully through the skin of the leg first, and then draw out the sinews. If this is left undone, it tends to make the legs tough. Chop through the bone, and scald the piece of leg that is left on in boiling water, and peel ofif the out- side skin. Then place the fowl on its breast, pull the piece of skin from the neck over the back, and cross the ends of the wings over this.

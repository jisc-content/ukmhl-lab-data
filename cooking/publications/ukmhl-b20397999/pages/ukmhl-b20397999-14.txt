COOKING FOR INVALIDS. In the following recipes very little, if any, vege- table flavouring is used. In the invalid state vege- tables are often prohibited, and even salt has some- times to be withheld. If allowed, they can, of course, easily be added. Those soups without thickening of any kind, such as flour, tapioca, or yolks of eggs, are always con- sidered the most digestible. Most soups, except beef tea, are better made the day before they are wanted, as they have then time to cool, and the fat can more easily be removed from the top of them. Never allow soup to cool in the saucepan in which it has been made, but always pom- it into a basin. Soups for invalids must always be made from fresh meat. The bones and meat may be put on a second time with cold water to cover them, boiled for several hours, and then strained. This second stock will do very well for any ordinary household purposes, but is not good for an invalid. In serving soup to an invalid do not fill the cup or basin too full, and on no account let any be spilt in the saucer. After pouring the soup into the cup or basin, be careful to wipe off any drops that may have fallen down the sides, and see that the handle, if it is a cup, is not sticky. Also be most particular to see that there is no grease on the top of the soup. If the first mouthful of soup an invalid takes is greasy, it is quite sufficient to prevent more being taken. A neat piece of plain bread, a piece of well made toast cut into thin strips, or a rusk, as preferred, may be served with it.

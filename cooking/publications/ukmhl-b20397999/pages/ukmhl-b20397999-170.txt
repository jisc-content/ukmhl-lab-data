i6o COOKING FOR INVALIDS. 192.—OATMEAL PORRIDGE (2). Use the same proportions as above. Soak the oatmeal in the cold water over night. Next day turn it into a saucepan, and stir over tlie fire until boiling. Finish as in last recipe. U'otes.—Oatmeal porridge is exceedingly wholesome and nour- ishing to those who can take it; but a great deal depends upon the way in which it is made: it must always be thoroughly well cooked. There are three kinds of oatmeal—" coarse," " medium," and "fine" ; and which kind to use is a question of taste. "Medium" is the one most frequently used for porridge. The oatmeal must be good, and it should be kept in a dry place ; if allowed to become damp, it will have a bitter taste. For an invalid, it is perhaps better to soak the oatmeal over night, as it makes it more digestible. But this somewhat alters the taste, and is not always so much liked. Crushed or rolled oats can now be had, and form a nice variety to the ordinary oatmeal. 193.—WHEATEN MEAIi PORRIDGE. Make according to either of the recipes given for oatmeal porridge. It will take rather a longer time to cook. Wheaten meal porridge is not so heating as oatmeal, and it makes a nice variety. 191.—HOMINY PORRIDGE. Ingredients— I oz. hominy. I Sugar (if liked). ]A pint milk or water. | A pinch of salt. Method- Put the hominy into a basin with the milk or water; cover it over, and let it stand all night.

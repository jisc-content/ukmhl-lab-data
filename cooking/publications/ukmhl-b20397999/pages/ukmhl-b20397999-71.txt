MEAT. 61 Cut off the head and some of the skin of the neck, leaving 3 or 4 inches on. Draw out the windpipe, and loosen the crop from the skin of the neck. (The crop is the bag of skin which lies close to the neck. It is the digestive canal of the fowl, and contmues right down into the gizzard, which is the bag of little stones found inside the fowl. These stones the fowl picks up and swallows, and they serve the purpose of teeth, helping to grind down the food.) . ^ ,' Then turn the fowl on its breast, still with the neck towards you. Insert the first finger inside, and loosen all the inside, but draw nothing out at this end. Be careful not to break the gall bag, which lies in the liver, because if this were done the gall would give a bitter taste to the whole fowl; but keep the finger going round as close to the bones as possible, and just breaking the little ligaments that attach the internal organs to the carcase. When all seems loose, turfi to the other end of the fowl, and slighdy enlarge the opening already there with a pair of scissors. Insert the first finger again, and loosen everything the same as at the other end, being careful not to make the hole too large. Then draw everything out, and, if it has been properly loosened, all should come out together. Keep the gizzard, cutting it open and removing the bag of stones from the inside, and the liver if it is good, removing the gall bag and any green parts from it.

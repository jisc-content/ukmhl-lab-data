Ingredients— 2 lemons. | i pint boiling water. 2 or 3 lumps of sugar. | Metbod— Wipe the lemons with a damp cloth, and peel the rind off one of them as thinly as possible. Then roll them on the table to soften them, cut them in two, and squeeze out the juice. (A wooden spoon pressed into the fruit is a capital lemon squeezer.) Strain the juice into a jug, and put the rind and sugar in along with it. Have the water freshly boiling, and pour it on. Cover the jug closely, that none of the strength may escape, and let stand till cold. Then strain. Notes.—This may be made with less water, and may then have soda or potash water added to it just before serving. The quantity of sugar used must depend upon taste. Lemonade is a beverage which is more popular with invalids than almost any other. Sometimes a small slice from the middle of a lemon is served on the top of the lemonade. It must hot be forgotten that the minutest portion of white pith, and also the pips, if allowed to remain, will make the lemonade bitter. Lemonade may be made with barley or rice water, instead of plain water.

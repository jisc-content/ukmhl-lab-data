MEAT. 8i 82.—GRATED GAME SANDWICHES. These are made of game finely grated, and served between thin slices of bread and butter. Cut a slice of bread JS^^ of an inch thick, and toast it carefully on both sides (see recipe No. 238). Then cut off the crust, and split it open. Toast both pieces again on the inner sides. Spread one piece with potted meat, put the other on the top, press together, and cut into neat pieces. A little butter may be spread on the toast first, if wished. 83.—TOAST SANDWICHES.

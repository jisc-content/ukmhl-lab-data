84 COOKING FOR INVALIDS. 85.—POTATO SNOW FLAKES. Pass well cooked floury potatoes through a wire sieve or potato masher, on to a hot dish, and serve as quickly as possible. If they have become in the least cold, heat in the oven, or in front of the fire for a minute or two. 86.—BOILED CAULIFLOWER. Select a young fresh cauliflower, with a firm close head. Trim ofi" the thick part of the stalk and nearly all the leaves, leaving on a few of the smaller ones to protect the flower. Split the stalk across in opposite directions, that the water may get in to cook it well. Wash it in cold water, and then let it lie in fresh cold water, with a teaspoonful of vinegar in it to draw out any insects. Have ready on the fire a deep saucepan, three- quarters full of freshly boiling water, add salt to it in the proportion of a teaspoonful to a quart of water, and plunge the cauliflower into this with the flower downwards. Let it boil quickly, with the lid off the saucepan, from 15 minutes to Yz hour, until the flower feels tender, but not broken up. While it boils, remove any scum that rises. If this were allowed to remain it would settle down on the flower and discolour it; also it is not clean. When ready, lift it out, drain it for a minute or two on a sieve or colander, and serve with or without a white sauce poured over it.

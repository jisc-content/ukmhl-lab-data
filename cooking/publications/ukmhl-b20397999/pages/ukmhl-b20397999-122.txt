COOKING FOR INVALIDS. 112 Bring them to the boil, and let them boil for 5 minutes, skimming if necessary. Wipe the apples, cut them in quarters, peel them, and remove the cores. Put them into the syrup of sugar and water, and let them cook slowly, until the pieces turn clear— from 10 to 15 minutes. Then lift them out, reduce the syrup by letting it boil down quickly with the lid off the pan, and, when there is a sufficient quantity for use, strain it over the apples. Time—15 to 20 minutes. Probable cost, 3d. 122.—STEWED APPLES (2). Ingredients— ^ lb. apples. I Yz gill of water. 2 oz. sugar. | Grated rind of yi. lemon. Method- Wipe the apples, and cut them into quarters. Then peel them, and remove the cores. Slice them down thinly into a small lined saucepan. Sprinkle over them the grated lemon rind, and add the sugar and water. Put the lid on the pan, and stew slowly, until soft— from 15 to 20 minutes—stirring them occasionally with a wooden spoon. Serve hot or cold. Notes.—This method of stewing apples reduces them to a pulp ; the pieces are not preserved whole, as in the preceding recipe. Less sugar may be used if the apples are found too sweet, and one or two cloves used for flavouring instead of the lemon jrind. Time—15 to 20 minutes. Probable cost, 3d.

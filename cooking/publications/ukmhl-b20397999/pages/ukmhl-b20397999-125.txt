Method— Wash the prunes well, and put them into a basin with the sugar, and enough cold water to cover them. Cover the basin, and, if possible, let the prunes soak over night. If this cannot be done, let them soak as long as possible. They swell much better, and cook more quickly, when thoroughly soaked. Then put them into a lined saucepan with the water and sugar in which they have been soaked, and add the thinly peeled rind of half a lemon. Put the lid on the pan, and stew slowly for about 20 minutes, or until the prunes are quite soft. When cooked sufficiently, the stones should slip out quite easily. Lift the prunes out on to a dish, and strain the juice over them to keep back the lemon rind. Sometimes a little port wine is added.

PUDDINGS Sr' SWEETS. 109 Sieve the flour, salt, and sugar into a clean dry basin. Take a piece of dry suet, remove the skin, dip it in the flour, and, with a sharp knife, flake off it 2 oz., and put the rest aside. (Do not cut the suet into thick pieces and then chop, as that would never make a Ught pudding. The flakes should be so thin that they curl up just like shavings of wood.) Sprinkle some flour from the basin over the flaked suet, and with a sharp knife chop it lightly, until it is as fine as bread crumbs. Hold the point of the knife steady while chopping, working the handle up and down. Use as much of the measured flour as is required to prevent the suet sticking to the board and knife. When ready, put it into the basin, and with the fingers rub it lightly into the remaining flour. Then add enough cold water to form it into a ball, mixing with the hand, which will be found lighter than a spoon. If made too wet, it will not be light. As a rule, flour will take up half its weight in water; the better the flour the more water it will take up. Roll the ball of paste round the sides of the basin till it leaves them quite clean. Dip the centre of the pudding cloth into the pan of boiling water on the fire, press the lid down on it, and draw it through. Dredge the centre of the cloth with a little flour, shaking off what does not adhere; put the dumpling in the centre of it, and, gathering up the edges evenly all round, tie with string in a bow knot, that it may be easily undone, leaving room for the pudding to swell.

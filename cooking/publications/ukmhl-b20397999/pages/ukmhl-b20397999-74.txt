A chicken will take from hour to hour, a fowl hour longer. If the fowl is to be kept for the invalid only, it will be better to roast but half of it at one time. This can be done by cutting the fowl right through the middle lengthways, from head to tail. In this case no trussing would be required. The other half could the second day be either roasted, or boiled, or stewed. This is a much better plan than having to re-heat any of it. Twice cooked meats are not good for invalids. When the fowl is ready, lift it on to a hot dish, remove any string or paper, and pour away any grease there may be. If gravy is wished to serve with it, pour away all the fat from the roasting tin, and pour into it a little good stock or beef tea. Stir over the fire until it boils, rubbing down into it any browning from the tin, season nicely, and pour round the fowl. If liked thick, the gravy may be thickened by browning a little flour in the tin, before pouring in the stock; but for an invalid it is more wholesome left clear. Bread sauce may also be served with roast fowl and rolls of bacon (see recipe No. 6i). Timeâ€”\ hour to f for a chiclien ; | hour to 1.^ hours for a fowl. Probable cost, 23. 6d. to 3s. 6d.

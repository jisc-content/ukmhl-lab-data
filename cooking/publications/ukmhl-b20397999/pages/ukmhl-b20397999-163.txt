DRINKS—TEA, COFFEE, 153 The coffeepot is then placed upon a spirit lamp or a stove, and as the water boils it forces its way up through the tube, and plays down upon the coffee like a fountain. It is allowed to boil up several times, and when the coffee has filtered through, it is ready. 182.—COFFEE MADE IN A JUG. Coffee may be made in a jug, although it will be decidedly inferior in quality. Heat the jug thoroughly with boiling water, and pour the water away. Put the coffee into the jug, pour the proper quantity of boiling water over it, and stir with a spoon. Cover the jug with a lid or a thickly folded cloth, and let stand by the side of the stove for 15 minutes. Have the jug or pot in which the coffee has to be served made very hot, stretch a piece of muslin over it, and strain the coffee through. 183.—TO SERVE COFFEE. When milk is served with coffee, it should be scalded, but not quite boiled. The proportions for strong coffee are equal quantities of strong coffee and scalded milk. This is Cafe au Lait. A little cream may be added. Cafe Noir is very strong coffee served without milk. Note.—If any coffee is left, it should be drained from the cafetiere, put into a bottle, and corked. Use this next day for making the coffee with a smaller quantity of water. Rather less coffee will be required.

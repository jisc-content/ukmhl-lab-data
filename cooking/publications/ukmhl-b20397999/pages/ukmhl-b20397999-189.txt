179 APPENDIX. 223.—TO CHOP PARSLEY. Wash the parsley well to get rid of all the earth. Pick it from the stalks, and put the heads into a cloth, and squeeze them quite dry. Then put them on a chopping board; and, with a sharp dry knife, cut them across, and chop as finely as possible. In chopping, hold the point of the knife steady on the table, and keep working the handle quickly up and down. Unless the parsley is very finely chopped, it is most irritating to the throat. 229.—TO CLEAN A CARROT. Wash in cold water, and brush well with a vegetable brush. Then cut off the top, and any green part, and with a knife scrape the outside lightly until the carrot is quite clean. Scrape from the thick end downwards, and do not take off more than is necessary, as the best part of the carrot lies on the outside. Throw into clean cold water until required.

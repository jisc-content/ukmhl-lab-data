MEAT. 59 57.—BEEF CREAM. Ingredients— X lb. lean, juicy beef. gill of stock, or beef tea. oz. butter. 2 tablespoonfuls of cream. >| oz. flour. Pepper and salt. Method— Wipe the beef with a damp cloth, and shred it down very finely with a sharp knife, as you would for beef tea. Make a panada with the butter, flour, and stock. Melt the butter in a small saucepan, add to it the flour, and mix with a wooden spoon until smooth. Then pour on the stock, and stir until boiling and thoroughly cooked. Put this panada into a mortar with the shred beef, and pound well together. Add the whole egg and seasoning, and pound again until as smooth as possible. Then rub the mixture through a fine wire sieve into a basin, and scrape the sieve well underneath. Add to the mixture the cream, and taste it to see that it is sufficiently seasoned. Have ready a small basin well greased, put the mixture into it, and shake it well down. Cover the basin with a piece of greased paper, and steam the cream very gently for 15 minutes, or until it is firm to the touch. Lift from the pan, and let it stand a minute or two before turning it out. Dish on a hot plate, with a piece of paper, remove any grease which may be on the top of it, and serve plain, or with a little beef tea heated and poured round it as a gravy. Time—15 minutes. Probable cost, 8d.

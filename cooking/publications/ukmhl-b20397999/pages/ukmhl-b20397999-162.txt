152 COOKING FOR INVALIDS. There is an oily substance in coffee which not only adheres to the sides of the pot and clogs up the holes of a percolator, and so prevents the coffee running through, but if not removed will give the next coffee made in the pot a bad flavour. The coffeepot must be taken to pieces, and each piece well washed wiih boiling water, then rinsed and dried separately. There are many different kinds of cafetieres, and some of them are much more complicated than others. Whatever kind is chosen, it must be one in which the straining is perfect, or the coffee will not be clear. First fill the cafetibre with boiling water; let it stand till thoroughly heated, and pour the water away. Then put in the required amount of coffee on the perforated plate of the upper compartment. The usual allowance is i tablespoonful of coffee to pint of boiling water, but ideas differ very much as to the degree of strength desirable. Pour the boiling water gently and gradually over the coffee, and let it stand in a warm place until it has all filtered through. If it has to be poured into a different pot for serving, be sure to have it well heated first. Picard's circulating coffeepot is one to be much recommended. It can be had in various sizes, is moderate in price, and simple in construction. In this coffeepot the water is put in the lower com- partment first, and not poured over the coffee. The upper compartment is usually made with glass sides, and has a tube through it which passes down into the water. The coffee is put upon the perforated plate of this upper compartment, and the lid put on.

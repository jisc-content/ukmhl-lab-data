COOKING FOR INVALIDS. io6 116.—STEAMED MILK PUDDINGS. Many of these milk puddings can be steamed instead of baked. The most suitable for steaming are—rice, semolina, tapioca, sago, custard, and bread and butter. For steaming, use rather less milk, keeping the mixture somewhat thicker, as steaming is a moist heat, and does not dry up the puddings like baking. An extra egg may also be used to help to bind the ingredients, but it is not necessary in a small pudding for one person. The basin or mould used for steaming must be greased out very thoroughly with clarified butter, which must be allowed to cool. The mixture being light, any carele'-,sness in this matter will cause the pudding to stick to the basin. Also see that the basin is quite dry before beginning to grease it. Steam very slowly, or the eggs will curdle. Let the pudding stand for a minute or two before turning out. 117. —BOILED BATTER PUDDING. Ingredients— 2 oz. flour. I A pinch of salt. J gill of milk.

40 COOKING FOR INVALIDS. Time—10 minutes. Probable cost, 3d. or 4d. rub the mixture through with, and the other for scraping underneath, as the sieve gets clogged with the mixture, and requires clearing from time to time. When all is through, shape the mixture into quenelles. To do this you will require a basin of warm water, two dessert spoons, and a knife. Dip the spoons into the warm water. Take up a spoonful of the mixture in one of them; then with the knife, also wet, smooth the mixture over, making it high in the centre, and pointed at the ends, like an egg- With the second spoon, scoop the mixture out, and then lay it carefully in a small greased frying or omelet pan. Shape the rest of the mixture in the same wa}', keeping them all as much the same size and shape as possible, and placing them a little distance apart in the pan. Place the pan on the stove, and pour gently round the quenelles enough boiling water to nearly cover them. Cover over with a round of greased paper, and poach slowly for lo minutes. Have ready a neat piece of toast (see recipe No. 238) on a hot plate. Lift the quenelles with a spoon—a perforated one is best—letting the water drain well from them, and dish them neatly on the toast. Decorate with a small sprig of parsley, and, if liked, pour over a little white sauce.

VEGETABLES. 83 With a potato knife peel them as thinly as possible, and with the point of the knife remove all the " eyes " or black specks, and keep the potatoes in water until they are wanted. Have them all of one size. If some are larger than others, cut them in two or three, to make them equal. Put them into a saucepan, just large enough to hold them, sprinkle with salt, and cover them with cold water. Potatoes should neither have too much room while boiling, nor too much water to toss them about. Put the lid on the pan, and bring them quickly to the boil, and then draw the pan to the side of the fire, and allow the water just to simmer gently until the potatoes are ready. The time will vary from 20 to 30 minutes, accord- ing to the age and kind of potatoes used. Let them cook until they can be pierced pretty easily with a fork or skewer. Then pour off every drop of water, holding the lid against the top of the saucepan, to keep the potatoes from falling out. Cover the potatoes over with a clean cloth or piece of crumpled kitchen paper. Put the lid half on the pan, and let them stand by the side of the fire for from 5 to 10 minutes longer, until they are quite dry and mealy. It is better not to boil the potatoes too soft to begin with; they will finish cooking afterwards in their own steam. When cooking potatoes for invalids, it is always safer to peel them; then any tainted or diseased pare can be seen and removed.

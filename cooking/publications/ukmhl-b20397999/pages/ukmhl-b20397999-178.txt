COOKING FOR INVALIDS. process is carried far enough, it need not undergo any final boiling. In fact, it is better to use it without boiling, because then the half finished process of digestion will go on for a time in the stomach. Note.—The practical rule for guidance in peptonising milk, or any milk food, is to allow the process to go on until a perceptible bitterness is developed, and not until it is unpleasantly pro- nounced. In peptonising these, it is important not to carry the process so far as to render them unpalatable. The extent of the peptonising process can be regulated either by increasing or diminishing the quantity of the Liquor pancreaticus, or by increasing or diminishing the time during which it is allowed to act upon the food. 206.—PEPTONISED GRUEL, ARROWROOT, &C. Proportions— I pint gruel. I 2 teaspoonfwl Benger's Liquor I pancreaticus. Method— The gruel should be very well boiled, and made thick and strong (see recipe No. 147, et seq.) Pour it into a jug, and let it cool down to a luke- warm temperature, not exceeding 140° Fahrenheit (60° centigrade). ' ' . Add to it tlie Liquor pancreaticus, and mix it well in ; cover the jug, and keep it warm as before. Stand from % hour to i hour, then bring to the boiling point, and strain. The action of the Liquor pancreaticus on gruel is two-fold: the starch of the meal is converted into sugar, and the albuminoid matters are peptonised.

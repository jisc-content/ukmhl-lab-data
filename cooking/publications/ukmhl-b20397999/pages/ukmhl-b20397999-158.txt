148 COOKING FOR INVALIDS. Fill the bottles nearly full, and put into each the small piece of yeast and the lump of sugar. Cork them tightly with new corks, and fasten them down very securely with wire. The corks should be soaked for some time before being used. Keep the bottles lying on their sides in a warm place, such as a dining-room cupboard, and shake them two or three times a day, for from four to six days. In cold weather koumiss will take longer to make than in warm. Note.—Be careful in opening the bottle, or half the contents may be lost. It is very effervescent. Koumiss is a very refreshing drink, and more easily digested than ordinary milk. Time—4 to 6 days. Probable cost, 3d. a bottle. 177.—TKA.. The first thing is to choose good tea. It is im- possible to make good tea from an inferior material. Good tea at a fair price will be found the cheapest in the end. It should be free from dust and stalks, and the leaves should be of about the same size, and well twisted. One of the most conspicuous tests of its goodness is its fragrance. The water used for making tea must be freshly boiled. It must never be drawn from a hot-water pipe or kitchen boiler. Water that has boiled for any length of time gets flat and insipid from the loss of its gases, and never makes good tea. Be sure that the water really is boiling; it should be bubbling all over, and steam coming out of the spout and from under the lid.

I gill of milk, or }4 oz. butter. i yolk of egg, and ^ gill cream. Y oz. flour. I teaspoonful finely chopped 3 gills or I pint cold water. parsley. Method— Wash and scrape the fish very clean, and see that there is no black skin lining the inside part. Do not remove the skin nor fins, but take out the eyes. Cut the fish across into five or six pieces, and put them into a nice lined saucepan. Cover them with the cold water, and add the salt; bring to the boil, and skim. After the soup has boiled for a few minutes, lift out a few nice little pieces of fish, free from skin and bone, and reserve them for serving in the soup at the end. Do not let them cook until all the flavour has been extracted from them. Allow the rest to simmer slowly for ^ to i hour longer. Then strain through a wire sieve, and rub some of the white pieces of fish through. Rinse out the pan the soup was cooked in ; melt in it the butter, add the flour, and mix these two smoothly together, being careful they do not brown.

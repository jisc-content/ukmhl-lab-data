MEAT. 75 Time—IJ to 2 bours. ProtoaWe cost, Is. to Is. 6d. 75.—STEWED SWEETBREAD Ingredients— I heart sweetbread. I gill of white stock. I tablespoonful cream. White pepper and salt. I teaspoonful arrowroot. Metbod— Soak the sweetbread in cold water from i to 2 hours. Then put it into a saucepan with cold water to cover it. Bring to the boil, and let it boil for 5 minutes. Then lift it out into a basin of clean cold water to cool it. This preserves the colour of the sweetbread. Then remove from it all fat and skin, pulling them off with the fingers, and break the sweetbread into small pieces of an equal size. Put these pieces into a small lined stewpan with the stock, put the lid on the pan, and simmer very slowly until tender. When sufficiently cooked, lift the pieces of sweet- bread out, and place them on a neat square of toast on a hot dish, and keep them warm. Break the arrowroot in a small basin with a Uttle cold water, and add it to the stock in the pan. Stir over the fire until boiling, and boil for five minutes, so as to thoroughly cook the arrowroot. Add the cream, and season to taste. A yolk of egg may be used instead of the cream, or the sauce may be left without either. Pour the sauce over the sweetbread, and serve very hot. Notes—ys:-CiSfi may be used instead of stock for stewing the sweetbread. A sweetbread must be cooked when very fresh. None of the internal meats, such as liver, kidneys, sweetbreads, &c., should be kept for any length of time. Lambs' sweetbreads are the most delicate, and can be cooked in the same way.

FISH. 35 31.—BROILED FISH. Required— I small haddock, or I whiting. Method— Have the fish skinned, but not filleted; wipe it with a damp cloth, and then dry it well. If the fish is thick, split it open, season with pepper, salt, and, if liked, a httle lemon juice. Have the gridiron very clean, heat it, and grease with a little butter. Lay the fish on it, and broil over or before a very clear fire, so that it may not taste smoky. Do not place it too near the fire, or it will be scorched. If broiling on the top of the fire, turn the fish once or twice during the cooking. For broiling in front of the fire, the grid is generally made double, and in that case the fish would be put between the two sets of ribs so that it can easily be turned. The time for broiling depends upon the thickness of the fish. The thicker the fish, the more slowly it must be cooked. For a small haddock or whiting, from lo to 12 minutes will be sufficient. Serve very hot, with a little cold butter. Broiling is more wholesome than frying. Time—10 to 12 minutes. Probatolo cost, 3d. to 4d. A httle butter. Pepper and salt.

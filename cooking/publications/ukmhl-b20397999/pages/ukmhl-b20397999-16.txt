A few drops of hydrochloric acid are sometimes added to assist the process, but it must be used with the greatest care. Occasionally a little claret, port wine, or lemon juice is used. After the beef tea has stood for the required time, stir it again, and place the jar or basin containing it in a saucepan, with sufficient cold water to reach half or three-quarters way up the basin. Put the lid in the pan, and boil slowly for three hours. During this time see that the water does not boil down too low in the pan, but, if it should, add more cold water. If making a larger quantity than the above, more time must be allowed in proportion, and it will be a good plan to lift out the jar once or twice during the time, remove the cover, and stir the beef tea well, as the meat is apt to get hardened into a cake, and it is then difficult for the juice to be drawn from it. When cooked sufficiently, remove the jar from the saucepan, stir up the beef tea, strain through a coarse strainer, and press the meat as dry as possible with a wooden spoon. Remove all grease from the top of the beef tea by passing over the top of it pieces of soft white paper.

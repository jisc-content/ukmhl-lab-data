JELLIES. To clear the stock, put it into a clean lined sauce- pan, with the white of egg, and the shell washed and crushed up. Put the pan on the fire, and finish in exactly the same way as Calfs Foot Jelly, page 122. Notes.—Vlote. vegetable flavourings can be used in the making of the jelly if wished. Clearing the jelly with white of egg, while making it more attractive looking, rather impoverishes it. Instead of white of egg, % lb. lean, juicy beef may be shred down and used in its place, in exactly the same way. Ttie beef contains albumen, which clears on the same prin- ciple as white of egg. It will, of course, make the jelly a little stronger in flavour. Time—3 to 4 hours. Probable cost, 8d. per glU. 143.—BEEF TEA JELLY. Ingredients— % pint beef tea. | % oz. isinglass.

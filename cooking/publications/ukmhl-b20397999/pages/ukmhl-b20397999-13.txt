THE ART OF COOKING FOR INVALIDS. CHAPTER I.â€”MEAT TEAS, BROTHS, AND SOUPS. INTRODUCTORY REMARKS. The beef used for beef tea must be freshly killed, lean, and juicy. Beef from the buttock, rump, or thick flank may be used Shin of beef is not suitable, as it contains too much bone and gristle, which produce gelatine, a substance of little value to an invalid. There are many different recipes given for the making of beef tea, but, whatever plan is adopted the object must be to extract as much goodness frorn the meat as possible, and to present this in its most digestible form. Beef tea must never boil, but only simmer very slowly. The reason of this is, that the albumen of meat, which is like the white of egg, if cooked at too high a temperature, becomes hard and in- digestible. Beef tea is not a nourishing food, but rather a stimulant, so, whenever possible, it should be given with, or alternately with, other food.

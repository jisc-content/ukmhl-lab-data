Ill PUDDINGS SWEETS. Keep turning the mixture over and over until all is thoroughly mixed. Set the omelet pan on the stove, and pour the mixture into it, scraping out the basin well. Hold the pan over the fire for a few seconds, then place it in a rather quick oven from 7 to lo minutes, until well risen, brown, and firm to the touch. When the omelet is cooking, have the jam put into a saucepan to heat, and a piece of paper laid out, and sprinkled with sugar. Turn the omelet out on to the sugared paper, put the jam in the centre, and fold over. Lift the omelet on to a hot plate with a folded paper or dish paper, and serve at once. Notes.—The jam is heated, because cold jam would make the omelet heavy. The paper is sugared to prevent the omelet sticking to it. If the omelet is allowed to stand after it is ready, it will get heavy. The jam may be omitted, and the omelet served plain, or some stewed fruit may be used instead of the jam. Always remember that the handle of the omelet pan is hot, and must be held with a cloth. Hands have sometimes been badly burned through forgetfulness of this. Time—10 minutes.

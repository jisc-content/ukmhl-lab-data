DRINKS—TEA, COFFEE, &-c. 151 179.—TEA MADE WITH MILK. Make in the same way, using boiling milk in place of tlie water. Perhaps the most convenient way for making this kind of tea will be to use a tea infuser. 180.—TEA WITH AN EGG. Break the egg into a breakfast cup, removing the speck from it. Add a little sugar, if liked, and beat up with a fork. Pour in the hot tea gradually, stirring all the time. If the whole egg is found to be too much, the yolk only may be used. 181.—TO MAKE COFFEE. Coffee, to be good, should be freshly roasted and freshly ground. When this cannot be done at home, it should be bought in very small quantities, and kept in a tin box with a tight fitting lid. When coffee is kept, it very quickly loses its flavour. If pure coffee is wanted, chicory must not be used. Chicory gives colour to the coffee, and some prefer coffee with it. The usual proportions are 2 oz. of chicory to i lb. of coffee. The water, as for tea, must be freshly boiled. It is also very important to have the coffeepot clean. This is an article which will very soon get out of order if it is neglected. It will not be sufficient to rinse out the coffeepot with hot water, and then to put it away.

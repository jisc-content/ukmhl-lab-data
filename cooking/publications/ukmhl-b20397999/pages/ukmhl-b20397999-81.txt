71 MEAT. Put the sieved mixture into a pan, add the cream, and heat through. This may be served on a piece of toast, or even cold. If considered too rich, use a little more water in the cooking, and omit the cream. Time—1 to \\ hours. Probable cost, veal 6d.; cbicken. Is. to Is. 6d. 69.—ROAST PIGEON OR PARTRIDGE. In choosing these birds for roasting, be careful to select those which are young. Older birds are better stewed. When young, the legs should be smooth and pliable, and the beaks easily broken. Pigeons may be hung for a day or two before being used, but must not be allowed to acquire any taint. Partridges should be hung until they are in good condition. The time depends very much upon the weather. In cold weather they may hang for a week or two, but in warmer weather four or five days may be found sufficient. Truss these birds in the same way as you would a chicken. A piece of bacon tied over the breast before roast- ing will impart a good flavour. Roast from 15 to 25 minutes, according to the age and size of the bird. Serve in the same way as Roast Chicken, page 63. Time—15 to 25 minutes. Probable cost, pigeon 9d. to Is. 3d.; partridge, 3s.

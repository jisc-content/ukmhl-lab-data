60 COOKING FOR INVALIDS. 58.—TO CHOOSE AND DRAW A FOWL. In choosing a fowl, one of the best tests of age is to feel the breast bone. When the bird is young, this is gristle, and should bend quite easily ; when eld, it is firm and hard. The legs of young fowls are smooth and the feet supple. Fowls with black legs are best for roasting, those with white legs for boiling. The method of drawing and trussing fowls for roasting and boiling is not easily taught by a book, a practical lesson on the subject being of much more value. As a rule, a poulterer will draw and truss a fowl for you, but in country places, and where this cannot be done, it is necessary to know personally how to do it. The method is the following:— TO DRAW A FOWL. Have in readiness a plate, pair of scissors, some scraps of paper, a basin of warm water, and a board to place the fowl on. The fowl should first be carefully plucked, and any ends of feathers removed. Then with a lighted taper singe off all hairs, holding the fowl in the left hand and the taper in the right, being careful not to blacken the skin. Then turn the fowl on its breast, with the head lying towards you on the board. With a pair of scissors make a slit down the skin o*" the back of the neck, about 3 or 4 inches long. With a piece of paper take hold of the inside neck, and draw it out away from the skin, and with a sharp knife cut it off close to the body, and throw it into the basin of water.

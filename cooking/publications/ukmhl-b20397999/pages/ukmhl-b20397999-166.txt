156 CHAPTER VIII.—MISCELLANEOUS DISHES. 186.—TO BOII. AN EGG. The excellence of an egg depends upon its being perfectly fresh and properly cooked. If cooked too long it becomes indigestible. Next to milk, an egg is one of the most valuable articles of an invalid's diet. Unfortunately some people cannot take one in any form. Raw or lightly cooked, it is very digestible; but overcooked, it becomes the reverse. If an egg is soaked in cold water for some time before cooking, it is said to be made more digestible. Put enough water into a small saucepan to entirely cover the egg. If only half the egg is immersed in the water, it will not cook equally. Allow the water to boil, and lower the egg gently into it. Draw the pan to the side of the fire, and allow the water to simmer slowly. Cook the egg for 3 minutes, unless it is quite new laid, when it will cake from 3^ to 4 minutes. Then lift it out, and serve at once. If it is allowed to stand, it becomes hard. Another very good method of cooking an egg is to put it into quite boiUng water, then to put the lid on the pan, and place it on the hearth or well back on the stove, where the water will cease to boil and at the same time keep its heat.

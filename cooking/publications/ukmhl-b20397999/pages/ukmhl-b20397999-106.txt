96 COOKING FOR INVALIDS. Time—30 mlnntes. Probable cost, 3d. 102.—BICE PUDDING. Ingredients— 1 oz. whole rice. Yz pint milk. I teaspoonful sugar. Method— Well wash the rice (Carolina is the best) in several waters. Put it into a lined saucepan, with cold water to cover it, bring it to the boil, and pour the water off. This helps to burst the rice more quickly ; the oily matter in the milk retards the process if it is poured on first. Then pour on the milk, and let the rice simmer by the side of the fire until it is thoroughly cooked, stirring it occasionally with a wooden spoon. When ready, it should be perfectly soft, and of a thick consistency. Remove the pan from the fire, add the sugar and any flavouring, and, when slightly cooled, the yolk of egg, mixing all well together. Put the white on a flat dinner plate, add a pinch of salt to it, and, with a knife, beat it up to a stiff froth. Stir this lightly, but thoroughly, into the mixture, and pour all into a greased pie dish. Wipe round the edges of the dish, and bake in a moderate oven, until nicely browned. When ready, lift out, and sprinkle with sugar. I egg. Flavouring (if wished).

50 COOKING FOR INVALIDS. Liver and kidneys must never be given to any one with a weak digestion. Broiling, steaming, and roasting are the most suit- able ways of cooking meat for invalids. Boiling comes next. Baking, stewing, and frying are not so suitable. AH white meats must be thoroughly cooked. Some meats, such as beef and mutton, are more digestible if underdone. Warmed up meats have next to no nourishment in them, besides being much less digestible. They should never be given to an invalid. RECIPES. 43.—GRILLED OR BROILED CHOP. Required— I loin chop. I Maltre d'hStel butter. Uetliod— A chop from the loin is considered the best. They are also cut from the best end of the neck and the fillet of the leg. The chop should be cut at least half-an-inch thick, and the meat must not have the slightest taint. Wipe the chop with a damp cloth, then trim it neatly, removing nearly all the fat. Have a clear fire, and, if there is any smoke or a blaze, sprinkle a handful of salt over it. See that the grill or gridiron is perfectly clean, make it thoroughly hot, and grease it with a piece of mutton fat or a little butter.

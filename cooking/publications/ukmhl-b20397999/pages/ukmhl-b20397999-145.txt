DRINKS—TEA, COFFEE, &-c. 135 Take a small lined saucepan, rinse it out with cold water, and pour the barley and milk into it. Stir constantly over the fire until boiling, and boil from 5 to 7 minutes. Season to taste with salt or sugar, and stir in a small piece of butter at the end. Serve very hot. Notes.—T^i^ gruel may be .made thicker or thinner according to taste, and a little cream may be served with it. Water may be used instead of milk, and wine or brandy added as required. A very good drink can be made by making the gruel with water, rather thick ; then thinning it down with port wine. Heat thoroughly, but do not boil again. Barley gruel makes a change from the ordinary oatmeal gruel, and is very nourishing. Time—10 minutes. Probable, cost 2d. 161.—THICK BARLEY WATER. Ingredients— 2 oz. pearl barley. I Rind and juice of % lemon. 2 pints cold water. | Sugar to taste. Method— Wash the barley well, and put it into a saucepan with cold water to cover it. Bring this water to the boil, and then pour it away. Rinse the barley with cold water, and rinse out the saucepan. (This is to blanch the barley, and if it were not done, the barley water would have a dark- coloured, unpleasant appearance.) Return the barley to the saucepan with the 2 pints of cold water, and the thinly peeled rind of half a lemon.

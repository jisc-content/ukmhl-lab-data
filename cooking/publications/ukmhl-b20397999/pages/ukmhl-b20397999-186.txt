176 COOKING FOR INVALIDS. Mix to a good consistency, but avoid heaviness, and beat quickly and lightly. Turn boiling hot out of the basin on to a piece of flannel, and spread smoothly over with a knife, leaving a margin all round. Turn the edges neatly over, and cover with the piece of muslin. Apply as hot as possible, and cover with a piece of absorbent cotton wool to keep in the heat. The poultice may be kept in position by a bandage if necessary. Note.—The linseed meal must be fresh, and the best should always be used. If the poultice has to be carried from one room to another, place it between two hot plates, to prevent its cooling. 220.—BKEAD FOULTICE. Required— Some crumbs of bread. 1 A piece of muslin or soft linen. Boiling water. | A small basin. Method— Heat the basin thoroughly with boiling water, empty it, and put into it some broken crumbs of bread. Pour boiling water over this, cover over, and let it stand for 2 minutes. Then pour off the superfluous water, and spread on the piece of muslin or fine linen. Apply as hot as possible without anything between it and the affected part. A piece of oil-silk may be placed over it, to keep in the moisture. A bread poultice is very cleansing and soothing, but it does not retain its heat so long as linseed meal.

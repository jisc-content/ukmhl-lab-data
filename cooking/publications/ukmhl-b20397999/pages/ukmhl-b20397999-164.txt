154 COOKING FOR INVALIDS. 181.—A CUP OF CHOCOLATE. Required— I cupful of milk. i egg. I oz. good chocolate. Method— Shred down the chocolate with a knife, and put it into a saucepan with the milk. Stir over the fire until the chocolate is dissolved, but do not boil longer than is necessary. Break the egg, and remove the speck from it; put it into a jug, and beat it up with a wire whisk or a fork. Strain the chocolate over it, stirring all the time, and whisk for a few minutes longer until frothy. Notes.—The amount of chocolate required may vary slightly according to the different kinds, but after one trial of a particular kind any fault can easily be remedied. Avoid cheap chocolate, as it is quite unsuitable. If this way of making it is found too rich, half milk and half water may be used, or the egg may be omitted. If too sweet, use the unsweetened chocolate, which is more expensive, but of which less is required. Time—10 minutes. Probable cost, 4d. 185.—COCOA FROM THE NIBS.

82 CHAPTER IV.—VEGETABLES. INTRODUCTORY REMARKS. As a class, vegetables require rather vigorous digestive powers. Only a few recipes for cooking the most suitable for an invalid diet are given. All root vegetables, such as carrots, turnips, par- snips, Jerusalem artichokes, &c., are indigestible. The most digestible of the green vegetables are cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, spinach, boiled lettuce, sea-kale, celery, and tomatoes; and these are con- sidered wholesome if well cooked. Potatoes can only be allowed if they are well cooked, dry, and mealy, and this is rather a rarity. When vegetables are given, it must always be in moderation. They must always be fresh, and, to be in perfection, they should be cooked very soon after they are taken from the ground. They must always be well cooked, but not allowed to remain in the water after they are ready. Boiled rice and boiled macaroni are very good substitutes when other vegetables are not allowed. RECIPES. 81.—BOILED POTATOES. First wash and brush the potatoes well in cold water, to get rid of all the dirt, and throw them into a basin of clean cold water, ready for peeling.

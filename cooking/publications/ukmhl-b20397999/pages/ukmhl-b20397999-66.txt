COOKING FOR INVALIDS. 56 Dip the spoons into the warm water, take up a spoonful of the mixture in one of them, with the knife (also dipped in warm water), smooth the mixture over the top, raising it high in the centre and pointed at the ends, Hke an egg. Then with the second wet spoon scoop the que- nelle carefully out, and lay it in the greased pan. Proceed with the rest of the mixture in the same way. This quantity will make four of five quenelles. Do not place them too near each other in the pan ; and, when all are in, put the pan on the stove, and pour in very gently enough boiling water to come half way up the quenelles, covering over with a round of greased paper. Poach slowly from lo to 12 minutes, or until they have lost their raw appearance and are firm to the touch. Lift out, and drain for a minute on a clean cloth. Then serve, either plain, with a piece of dry toast, or dish on a neat square of toast, and pour some hot beef tea round them. Time—10 to 12 minutes. Probable cost, 6d. 55.—VEAL OB CHICKEN aUENELLES.

88 COOKING FOR INVALIDS. 91.—VKGETABLE MARROW. Peel the marrow thinly, cut it into quarters, and remove the seeds. If large, the pieces may be cut smaller, or half only need be cooked at one time. Throw the pieces into cold water as they are prepared. Cook in a saucepan of freshly boiling water, with salt, and a squeeze of lemon juice. Boil gently, with the lid off the pan, until tender. The time depends very much upon the age of the marrow, and will vary from 20 minutes to 5^ of an hour. The pieces when ready should look quite trans- parent. Lift them out, and drain well. Serve on a hot dish, and, if sauce is not allowed, put a small piece of cold butter on the pieces, and sprinkle with pepper, salt, and a squeeze of lemon juice. 92.—PLAINLY BOILED RICE. Use Patna rice for the purpose. This is a long and slender grain, with pointed ends. Well wash it in several waters, until the last water that is poured off looks quite clean. Have ready on the fire a saucepan, three parts full of freshly boiling water; add salt to it in the pro- portion of one teaspoonful to the quart, and throw the rice into this. Boil quickly with the lid off, stirring it frequently

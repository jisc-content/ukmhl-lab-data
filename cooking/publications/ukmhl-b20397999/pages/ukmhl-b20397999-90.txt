COOKING FOR INVALIDS. 8o Mince the meat very finely, either with a sharp knife, or by putting it twice through a mincing machine. Put it into a mortar, with the butter (previously melted), and season to taste. Pound well together, and rub through a fine wire sieve. Pack this into little pots, and, if it has to be kept for any time, run a little melted butter over the top of it. Notes.—Almost any meat can be potted in the same way. Chicken by itself is rather tasteless, and, when ham and tongue are allowed, a little piece of either used along with the chicken is a great improvement. And the same with the other meats— two different meats used together are always more tasty than one. If a little ham fat is used, less butter will be required. The seasonings given in above recipe are very simple, but of course more can be added to suit different tastes. As a rule, invalids object to anything that is too highly seasoned. This potted meat makes nice sandwiches for an invalid's luncheon or supper. A little of this spread on bread will often tempt them to eat. Spread between thin slices of brown or white bread and butter, or on toast or water biscuits. 81.—RAW BEEF SANDWICHES. Take 2 oz. of lean, juicy beef. Wipe it with a cloth, and with a sharp knife shred it down as finely as you would for beef tea. Pound this in a mortar, with any seasoning that may be allowed, and rub through a fine wire sieve. Spread between thin slices of bread, with a little butter on it, if it is allowed, and cut it into neat strips. These sandwiches are generally ordered for special cases.

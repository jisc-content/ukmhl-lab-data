FISH. 58 manage. Lift out and serve with a spoonful or so of the milk round it. (N.B.—The milk left over is an excellent foundation for fish sauce, souffle, or fish toasts.) This is a Highland fisherman’s recipe. Steamed SmoTced Haddoclc.—Skin the fish and lay it in a hot pan, add enough boiling water not quite to cover it, cover down the pan and cook on a hot corner of the stove for ten or fifteen minutes; then di-aiu, spread a little butter over it, and serve with a dust of cayenne and a sprinkling of lemon juice, or, if liked, Worcester sauce over it. These form pleasant variations from the ordinary method of skinning the fish, buttering, and broiling it over a clear fire. “ Crapjnt Heids.”—This is an old-fashioned Scotch dish still very popular in some parts of Scotland. Cleanse three good haddocks’ heads (or a cod’s head), wipe them quite dry, and remove the eyes from the outside so as not to make a hole through it. Have ready toasted before the fire or in the oven 4oz. of medium oatmeal (be careful this has been kept stirred so as only to dry and lightly brown it, for if the least “ caught” it is spoiled), and make a stuffing with this and two haddock roes and two livers (or use 2oz. clarified drqiping), a dessertspoonful of minced parsley, two parboiled and minced onions, a teaspoonful of salt, and a quarter as much jicpper, mixing it all to a stiff paste with about a gill of milk or water; then stuff the heads with this, sewing them up carefully to prevent the farce escaping. Brush them over with ^oz. of dissolved dripping, roll them in breadcrumbs, let them stand for a minute or two

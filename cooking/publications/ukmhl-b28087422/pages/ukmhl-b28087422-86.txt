74 BREAKFAST AND LUNCH DISHES. ChicJcen Fritters.—Cut tlie remains of any cold cooked chicken, &c., into neat pieces as large and as even as you can get them, season with salt and freshly ground black pepper; dip each piece into frying batter, and fry in plenty of hot fat till of a golden brown. Drain well, sprinkle with coralline pepper, and serve piled up on a napkin, with Irliudaise, Bcarnaise, or Tartare sauce handed round. If preferred the meat may be egged and crumbed instead of using batter, but in this case serve with little rolls of fried bacon and a rich, ice- cold tomato mayonnaise. Chicken Viennoise.—Si^lit a spiung chicken as for broiling, remove the breastbone, quarter it, and marinade these quarters for an hour or two in oil, vinegar, salt, and pepper; then roll each piece in fine flour and fry in plenty of boiling fat, cooking each piece separately. When nicely coloured drain the pieces on kitchen paper near the fire, and when all are ready serve on a napkin garnished with quartered lettuce, and hand round mayonnaise sauce. Needless, presumably, to say that all and any of these recipes are equally appropriate to turkey, pigeons, quail, game, rabbits, &c. Poulet a la Jeune Fille.—Rub a nice fowl with butter and season with pepper and salt, fill it with seasoned oysters, and put it into a casserole, closing it down hermetically; stand it in the bain-marie and allow it to cook gently till perfectly tender. Now lift out the fowl and keep it hot; pour the liquor into a pan, with 2oz. of butter, a gill of milk, a spoonful of arrowroot, and a little minced parsley;

Melt some glaze and pour a spoonful or so into each mould, turning the moulds on the ice to coat them with the glaze, just as you would when coating a mould with jelly; strew this glaze generously with a little minced ham or tongue, truffles and fines herbes, then break into each mould a new-laid egg, being very careful not to break the yolk.

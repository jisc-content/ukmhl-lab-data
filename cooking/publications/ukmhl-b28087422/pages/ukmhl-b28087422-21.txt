BREAKFAST. 9 If properly made tliis keeps tlie aroma and flavour of tlie eofl'ee most wonderfully. For use stir a spoonful of tills into a cup of absolutely boiling milk or water as you choose. The size of the spoon must be in proportion to the cup. Chocolate.—For this scrape or grate down any good chocolate to taste into a pan containing gills of water for each bib. of chocolate; then set it on the fire and keep it constantly beaten till it is quite thick, when you add in gradually, beating it all the time, about a pint of new milk. If you do not possess a proper “ chocolate mill,” or moussoir (which, if you use chocolate much, is well worth the few jDence it costs), take either a delicately clean whisk, or a wooden spoon, and twirl it between the palms of your hands, beating and frothing the chocolate at the same time. The quantity of milk is a question of taste, as is also the consistency. The above is for breakfast chocolate d VAncjlaise. In Spain and Austria the milk is omitted and the chocolate made so stiff that the spoon will almost stand upright in it, a strong flavouring of cinnamon, vanilla, &c., being added in the first, and a spoonful of liqueur-flavom’ed, stiffly whiskdd cream in the latter country. Cocoa.—Any of the patent cocoas on the market can be made by the directions sent out with them, but from personal experience I should advise the mixture being always just brought to the boil before use, as this seems to give far more flavour than when the powder is simply mixed with boiling water.

38 BBEAKFAST AND LUNCH DISHES. yet in reality few things are simpler to make. Take a new frying-j^an (and keep it only for omelets), put a small piece of butter, lard, or dripping into this, and fry it till it smokes strongly and begins to turn brown; then pour it away, and carefully wipe out the pan with a piece of soft paper. (Please re- member an omelet pan should never he washed, on i:»ain of burning the omelet, but it should be kept delicately clean by wiping it out most carefully with soft clean paper every time it is used.) Now beat lightly together two or three whole eggs, according to the size of your omelet, till the whites and yolks are well mixed, but nothing more; then season this egg yolk to taste with pepper, salt, minced parsley, &c. Now melt some butter in the frying-pan, using -g-oz. of butter for each egg, and when this has ceased to smoko, pour into it the egg mixture; let it rest quietly on the fire for a minute or so till a thin layer of cooked egg has formed on the bottom of the pan. You can soon see if the egg has properly set by tilting up the pan a little, which will be shown by the puffs of steam that will rise. Now lift the edge of this set part with a broad-bladed knife (a palette knife is best) and allow as much of the uncooked egg to run under as you can, repeating this till no fluid is left and the top of the egg is as much set as for scrambled eggs. Slip the knife right under the omelet and fold over one half on to the other and draw it on to the hot dish ready for it, or, if preferred, lay the dish on the pan, reversing the latter so that the omelet falls gently over into the dish, and serve at once—for an omelet will not wait 1

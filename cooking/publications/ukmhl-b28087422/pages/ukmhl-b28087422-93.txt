The tin can then be dipped for a moment into hot water, and turned out like a jelly. Remember when choosing your brawn tin that it is better to have it rather narrow, as it is much easier to carve than when the brawn is too wide. It is impossible to say exactly how long the brawn will take to finish, as it must be very slowly simmered, and the ears and feet (which add largely to the jelly) take a considerable time to cook. Potted Head.—A homely dish, somewhat similar to brawn, and very popular in Scotland, is made from an ox’s or sheep’s head. For this take a whole or half a head, according to size, removing the brains; wash the head thoroughly and soak both it and the foot for an hour or two in warm water ; then break up both and lay them in a pan with just enough water to cover them well. Bring to the boil, skim well, then draw to the side and simmer steadily, closely covered, till the bones will slip from the flesh. This, for a moderate head, takes about four hours. Now lift the meat out, remove the bones, cut it into dice, seasoning it as you do so with the following mixture: Two teaspoonfuls of salt, one of freshly ground black pepper, one of powdered allspice, and, if liked, a saltspoonful of cayenne.

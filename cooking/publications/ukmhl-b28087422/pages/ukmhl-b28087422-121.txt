LUNCHEON. 109 no more need be said on the subject. Curries, again, are useful for all kinds of lunches, so are sandwiches and fancy salads, but these are gi\en seijarately. Sweets, again, are very favourite dishes for luncheon use, the more solid English puddings being’ especially accept ible, though, naturally, not in quite so plain a form as Avhen served at the nursery- dinner-lunch. Omelets also, sweet or savoury, plain ov fourrees, or soujfAes, are all approved, and so also are eggs in various ways, whilst, where the cook is to be trusted, dainty vegetable entremets should always have a place on the lunch table. Macaroni and rice in various forms, either as pilaff, a VItalienne, aux tomates, &c , are also to be commended, and give a note of novelty to the ordinary lunch table ; recipes for these are given in another chajjter. Lastly, a word must be said with regard to the actual table itself, which on festive occasions should be as carefullv decorated as ever it is for late dinner. «/ In this matter all sorts of whims a,nd fads may be given a free rein with advantage, and colours which lose more than half their value under artificial light are most effective by daylight. As example is better than precept, the following menus for dainty little lunches of the dejeuner type may be found useful: WINTER. ConBomm4 a Tlndienne en tasscs. Merluche en Orlie. Faisan en Casserole. Filets de Boeuf a la Maitro d’Hotel. Eclairs an Caf^, Fromage, &c.

23 EGGS. dish, with a garnish of tiny rolls of fried bacon or ham, and the buttered eggs poured over all. In short, this dish may be varied almost indefinitely. If served on hot buttered toast the latter may be spread with any hind of savoury butter, such as anchovy, bourguignotte (a rich, thick brown sauce, flavoured with onion, herbs, mushroom, spice, and red wine, and thickened with butter), cayenne or curry,*ham, lobster, muitre d’hotel, truffle, shrimp, or ravigotte butter. A pretty dish of this kind, which may serve as an example, is the Spanish tomafe y Imevos (buttered eggs and tomatoes) : For this parboil three or more ripe tomatoes, rub them through a sieve, put the pulp into a pan with an an ounce or so of butter or good dripping, and a seasoning of pepper and salt; break two or three eggs, according to the size you wish your dish to be (one egg and two tomatoes a head is the usual reckoning), into the mixture, stir it over the fire till the eggs are thoroughly “ scrambled,” and serve very hot. Pieces of cold cooked potato cut into cubes, dice of cold bacon, sliced sausage, minced parsley, chives, finely-sliced shallot, &c., are all added to this disb, which is a special blessing for thrifty housewives, as it produces a dainty dish out of the merest scraps. It is manifestly impossible in a book of this size to attempt anything exhaustive in the matter of egg cookery, so that only a few recipes will be given as specimens, and the intelli- crent cook must use them as stepping stones to further variety.

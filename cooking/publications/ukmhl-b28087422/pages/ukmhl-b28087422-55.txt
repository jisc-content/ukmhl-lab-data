CHAPTER III. FISH. Fish is a great stand-by for breakfast, and can be served in a variety of ways, though the simpler and less higbly-flavoured methods are generally preferred, especially for fresh fish; very constantly, however, the breakfast fish is prepared from the fish left over from the previous day’s dinner. For these rechaufiies the following recif>es are of general application. Fish a la Creme.—Flake any nice white fish with two silver forks into neat pieces, dusting them as you do so with white pepper, salt, and a few droj)s of lemon juice (this can be done overnight, and in any case should be done whilst the fish is hot, as the skin and bones never come away so neatly if the fish is left till cold) ; have ready for each |lb. of flaked fish half a pint of good melted butter, bechamel, or white sauce, flavouring these with a dash of cayenne and lemon juice and some delicately minced chives or parsley; heat the fish in this, and when thoroughly hot, dish on a hot dish with a garnish of fried croutons spread with maitre d’hotel or anchovy butter. Or: Prepare the fish and sauce as before, put the fish into a well-buttered pie or other fireproof

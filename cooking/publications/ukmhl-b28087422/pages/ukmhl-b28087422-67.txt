55 FISH. Trout a la Hussarde.—Skin and clean five or six small trout, stuff each with a lump of maitre d’hotel butter, lay them in a marinade of oil, seasoned with salt and freshly ground black pepper, for an hour ; then grill or broil, and serve very hot. Broihd Maclcerel.—Cleanse and trim the fish, .siditting it lengthwise down the back to the bone; marinade the split fish for an hour, as in the pre- ceding recipe, then grill or broil it for six minutes on each side and serve very hot with a pat of maitre d’hotel butter. In old days mackerel intended for broiling was wrapped first in southernwood, which was held to improve its flavour. If this be true I know not, but to* this day many gourmets advise wrapping the fish, before laying it on the grill, in fennel. KentiicJcy Cod.—Cut the fish up into 2in. pieces, season each with salt and pepper, and roll in Indian corn meal, or failing this, in oatmeal. Fry some thin rolls of bacon and put them when done in a hot dish, then fry the fish in the same pan in the bacon fat, adding, if the latter be not sufficient, a little lard or some more bacon fat saved on a previous occasion. When delicately browned, drain the fish, pile it on a hot dish, and serve garnished with the bacon. Corned Cod. — Split and cleanse carefully a medium sized cod, remove the backbone, and rub in a good handful of salt (this manifestly depends on the size of the fish, a 71b. or 81b. fish taking a woman’s large handful), lay it flat on a dish skin down- wards, leave it thus for exactly twenty-four hours.

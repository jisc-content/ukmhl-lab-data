The above can evidently be increased by having cold dislies of various kinds on the sideboard ; or if less is required, a dish of meat or the savoury may be suppressed. But the above may serve as types. Lastly there are shooting lunches and what, for want of a better word, may be known as basket lunches. Concerning the former a few words have already been said, but it may not be out of place to enter a protest against the tendency to turn the shooting lunch into a kind of picnic, of more or less ornate character, which, with due submission, it may be observed is a mistake. A rich, heavy lunch, differing only by the fact of its being eaten in the open from the same meal at home, is seldom, if ever, a good preparation for a successful afternoon shoot.

INTRODUCTION, Owing to the success which has* attended the 'piihlication of this cookery hook, and the great demand for copies, the publishers have been induced to issue a further edition. This is not surprising, seeing that their aim has been to offer the public one that is far superior to those that are so often given away indiscriminately. The recipes have all been prepared and tested by a teacher of the highest standing in the cookery world, and great care has been taken to see that they are all simple and practical.

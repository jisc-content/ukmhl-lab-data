It is impossible to say exactly how much time cakes, etc., require to be baked. Where mentioned the ordinary conditions of the oven must be taken into consideration. Some kinds of flour absorb more moisture than others, therefore it is an advantage, if the cakes or bread seem rather dry, to add a small quantit}/ of milk just before finishing beating, and it should be constantly remembered that all cakes, puddings, etc., to which BORWICK'S BAKING POWDER has been added should be put to cook as quickly as possible, and also that all cakes except sponges should be briskly beaten for three minutes just before putting them into the tins ; and that bread should be left rather moist, and put into a very warm oven, the heat being reduced later on. Many people spoil cakes in the cooking by having the oven too hot. The cake fails to rise as it should if cooked more gradually, especially if a gas oven is used. The baking powder is best mixed with the flour, by putting them together through a sieve. CAROLINE WINDSOR, G.C.A.

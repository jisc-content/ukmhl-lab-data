CONFECTIONARY 8 much steam, will not be so light as otherwise. Tarta or puffs that are iced, should be baked in a cooler oven than those that are not iced; or if the oven is too hot, the door should be left open, else the iceing will become brown before they are baked. Small articles of pastry, require to be baked in a hotter oven than large ones. All pastry requires to be baked in clean tins or patty pans, without being buttered. Pastry, when baked sufficiently, may be easily slid about on the tin, or pan, while hot: and puffs, patties, or small pies, may be lifted from the tin, without breaking, by putting your fingers round the edges, and carefully lifting them; which cannot be done unless they are baked enough to be taken from the oven. COVENTRY PUFF. Roll out your paste in a sheet about half an inch thick, and cut it in square pieces, according to the size you intend your puffs to be, roll it out rather thin: put some raspberry jam in the centre; fold up the sides so as to form a three-cornered puff; turn it over, notch the edges with a knife; and ice them, by first washing them over with white of egg that has been whisked to a froth; then dust them wrell with finely-powdered loaf sugar, and with a brush sprinkle them with clean w'ater, just sufficient to moisten the sugar. If you sprinkle them too much, they will appear as if they were not iced at all, as it washes the sugar off again. BANBURY PUFFS. Cut. the paste, as directed for Coventrys, without rolling it thin; lay some of your Banbury-meat (see page 9,) in the middle, and fold up the edges of your paste, so as to form an oval puffâ€™, thus o; this is done by pressing more of your paste together at the ends tlian in the centre. Turn them, and dust the tops well with loaf sugar dust, and bake them in a moderate oven.

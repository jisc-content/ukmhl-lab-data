12 CONFECTIONARY SWISS PASTE. FRENCH PASTE. Roll out a piece of puff paste about an inch and a half thick, and three inches wide; cut it into slices about a quarter of an inch thick; lay them, with their flat sides on a baking-plate, three or four inches distant from each other. Bake in a moderately quick oven. When done, spread a thin layer of raspberry jam oa the flat side of one of the pieces, and lay on another piece to cover it. APPLE, GOOSEBERRY, AND OTHER FRUIT PUFFS. Roll out your pastry as directed for Coventry puffs; put some of your fruit, with a little sugar, in the cen- tre; sprinkle them with water, fold your paste over, so as to form a semi-circle, and ice them as before directed. Apples should be peeled, cored, and cut in small pieces; rhubarb should have the strings on the outside taken off, and then cut in pieces. MINCE PIES. Take some patty pans, roll out the cuttings of puff paste, or some tart paste, rather thin, to line them with. Nearly fill them with mince-meat, making it rather high in the middle and leaving it half an inch from the edge; make a good light piece of paste, by using a pound of butter to a pound of flour, add an egg, with the juice of a lemon, to the water, when you mix it; put on some moderately stout pieces of paste for covers; trim it off round the edges with a knife, make a small hole in the middle with a stick or piece of the whisk. And bake them in a moderate oven. MINCE MEAT. Four pounds of the best beef suet, chopped fine; five pounds of apples, peeled, cored, and chopped fine; four pounds of mixed lemon, orange, and citron peel, cut small; two pounds of sugar. Grate three nutmegs,

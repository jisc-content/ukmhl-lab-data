CONFECTIONARY 74 CRACKLED. Boil as much clarified sugar as you will want to use, longer than in either of the preceding degrees, over a clear fire, as before described; have a pan of cold water in readiness, placed so that no heat can get to it, and yet so that it shall be handy. To prove whether the sugar is boiled enough, dip a clean stick into it, and immediately after you take it out, put it into the cold water; draw off the sugar that hangs to the stick into the water, as quickly as you can, and if it becomes hard, and snaps when you break it, it has acquired the proper degree; but if otherwise, you must boil it again till it answers that trial. Be particularly careful that the water you use for this purpose is perfectly cold, or you will be greatly deceived. CARAMEL. To obtain the caramel degree, boil clarified sugar longer than for either of the former degrees, over a clear fire. You must prove it as directed in the crackled degree, by dipping a stick first into the sugar, and im- mediately after you take it out putting it into a pan of cold water; but there ought to be this difference, that when it comes to a caramel height, it will, the moment it touches the water, snap like glass; this is the highest and last degree of boiling sugar. You must, in doing this, take great care that the fire which you use be not too fierce, for the sugar must boil s-lowly; and that it be clear, and does not flame up the sides of your pan, which would cause the sugar to burn, and get discoloured, and thereby destroy all your labour. These directions will be of great service, and should be attended to in boiling every sort of sugar.

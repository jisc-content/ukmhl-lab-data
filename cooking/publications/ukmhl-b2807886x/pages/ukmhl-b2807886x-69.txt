MADE EASY. 65 pots or jars, and set it by to cool. Next day, cat pieces of clean writing paper to the size ot the insides ot the pots, dip them in brandy, and put one piece upon the jam in each pot, so that it is covered all over, put ano- ther dry piece upon each, tie paper over the tops, and keep them in a dry, cool place.

Strawberry Jam is made the same as raspberry jam: the scarlet pines make the best jam. RED CURRANT JAM. Take the stalks off ripe red currants, till you have eight pounds weight; put them into a cane sieve, with the holes just small enough to prevent them going through whole, place it over a preserving pan, and rub all the fruit through with your hands into the pan. Add seven pounds of loaf sugar, broken very small, or in the proportion of fourteen ounces of sugar to each pound of currants. Set it over a clear brisk fire, and let it boil for about a quarter of an hour or twenty mi- nutes. Try whether it is done, by dropping a little on a cold plate; if it sets in a minute or two, it is done; if not, boil it slowly till it will. Put it into pots or jars, and when cool, cover it over as directed for Raspberry Jam. A common jam may be made with moist sugar, in- stead of loaf. BLACK CURRANT JAM. Put your black currants, stalks and all, into an earthen jar or preserving pan; place them in a slow oven until soft, then rub them through a cane sieve, the same as used for red currants, to separate the stalks. Put as many pounds of loaf sugar, broken small, as you have

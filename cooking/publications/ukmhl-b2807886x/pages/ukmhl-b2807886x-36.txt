32 CONFECTIONARY not all blanched, pick out those that are not; rub them again, and fan them; continue this until they are finished. Let them dry in a stove or proving oven before using, and keep them dry, or they will turn sour. Use them for the following mixtures: if the heat em- ployed in drying them is too great, it will oil them, when they will be almost useless. ALMOND CAKES. One pound of sweet almonds, two pounds and a half of loaf sugar. Pound the almonds in a mortar with the sugar, and pass it through a Hour sieve. Put it in a clean pan, with the whites of ten or twelve eggs, the number will greatly depend on the dryness of the almonds and sugar, and also on the heat of the oven, beat the whole well toge- ther with a spaddle, drop two or three on a piece of wafer paper, and try them by baking; see if they are too light when baked, (that is, if they spread too much, or open too freely) then add a little more almond and sugar, beat and sifted. Try them again, and if they are too stiff, add a small portion of white (half or quarter the white of an egg is often too much) and beat it well up. Drop them on wafer paper that is put on clean iron plates, about the size of a walnut, an inch apart, with a pipe and bag; have a few almonds cut in thin slices, put a few pieces on the top of each, give them a slight dust with fine powdered loaf sugar and bake them in a slow oven. If you find they do not crack sufficiently in baking, when you put more in the oven sprinkle them lightly with a brush and clean water. When they are cold, break the wafer paper off round the edges. ALMOND CAKES. (No. 2.) Pound your almonds quite fine in a mortar, with the white of an egg or two, to prevent them from oiling;

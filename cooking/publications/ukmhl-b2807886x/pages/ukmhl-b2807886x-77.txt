MADE EASY. 73 see if it is fine and clear underneath; if it does not appear so, give it another boil up, and then look again, proceed in this manner till it is quite clear, and then pass it through a straining bag, or fine lawn sieve- . u may now proceed to clarify it to any ol the following degrees. SMOOTH, OR CANDY, OR THREAD, SMALL AND LARGE. Take what quantity of the above you have occasion for, and put it over the fire, let it boil gently till it is smooth: this you may know by dipping your skimmer into the sugar, and then drawing it through your finger and thumb ; immediately on opening them, you will observe a small thread drawn between, which will quickly break, and remain in a drop on your thumb. This shows that it has acquired a degree of smooth- ness, or the small thread ; let it boil a little more, and it will draw into a larger string, when it will have ac- quired the second degree, of candy, or large thread. If it is likely to boil over into the fire, add a bit of butter, which will prevent it. Then proceed to BLOWN. In this degree, you must boil clarified sugar for a longer time than for smooth, or candy; then dip your skimmer in, shaking off what sugar you can into the pan ; then blow with your mouth strongly through the holes, and if bladders or bubbles go through, then it has acquired the third degree. FEATHERED. To prove this degree, dip the skimmer into the sugar, when it has boiled longer than in the former degrees; after you have done so, first give it a shake over the pan, and then a sudden flirt behind you, and if it is boiled enough, it will fly off like feathers or mo us properly in fine strings.

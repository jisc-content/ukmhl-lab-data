7 MADE EASY. Take a quarter or a sixth of the butter, rub it in with the flour; then mix it into a paste with cold water, it should be of the same consistence as the butter, in sum- mer, a little weaker; lightly dust the board or marble slab with flour, and roll out the paste, or work it with vour hands, as for tart paste, until it is smooth and evenly mixed, then roll it into a sheet about an inch thick. Take the remainder of the butter, and cover the sheet of paste with small pieces, either by cut- ting it in thin slices with a knife, or by breaking it into small pieces with your fingers. Then give the sheet two or three folds, and roll it out thin; this is called one turn; the half turn is merely folding it in two, or doubling the sheet again; let it lay in a cool place, covered with a damp cloth for half an hour; or place some ice in a deep dish, with another on this, on which put the paste, over this put a third, covered with ice pounded small and let it lay as before, then roll it out again. Do this three or four separate times, and your paste is fit for use. The number of turns which you give the paste, will depend on the thickness it is rolled out, it may require five or six turns. In winter, those precautions of letting the paste lay, before rolling out a third or fourth time, may be dis- pensed with, if it is required in a hurry, as the butter being firm aud the weather cold, it will admit of its being done so. BAKING OF PASTRY. In the baking of pastry, the heat of the oven should be regulated according to the article intended to be baked, or those things should be made first which will suit the heat of the oven. Light paste requires a moderately quick oven: for if the oven is too hot, the paste will be coloured before it is properly baked; and if it is then taken out of the oven, it will fall, and become flat: also, a cool oven will not cause it to rise sufficiently; and puff paste baked in an oven, with any thing that causes

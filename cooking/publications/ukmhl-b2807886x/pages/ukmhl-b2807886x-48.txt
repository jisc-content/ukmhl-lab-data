44 CONFECTIONARY a hot oven. If you wish to have currants or carraway seeds and spice in them, mix in either of these when you add the butter and milk. The spice to be used is equal quantities of ground ginger, allspice, coriander, and carraways, mixed together; put as much of this as you think sufficient. When they are baked enough, brush them over with egg and water, mixed together, to give them a gloss. SAFFRON BUNS. Make the dough for them the same as for plain buns. Put a little of the best saffron in a tea-cup, and pour over it a little boiling water; let it stand on the top of the oven, to extract the flavour; and when you put in the butter, mix in as much of the saffron water as will make the dough of a bright yellow colour. Bake them as before directed. You may put in a few cur- rants, but saffron buns are seldom spiced. BATH BUNS. Make a hole in the middle of a pound of flour, and put m half a tablespoonful of good thick yeast; warm half a tea-cupful of milk about blood-wann, and pour it upon the yeast; mix them up with about one third of the Hour, and let it stand for about three quarters of an hour, or an hour, to rise. When it has risen, put in six ounces of cold butter, and break in four eggs, add a few carraway seeds, and mix all together, along with the rest of the flour. Set it in a warm place to rise, for a short time, then put it on your paste board, and flatten it with your hand. Sift six ounces of loaf sugar, about the size of peas, and sprinkle it over the dough: roll or chop it together, a little, to mix the sugar; then put it in a warm place, in the pan, to rise, for about a quarter of an hour; make it into buns, by laying them on a buttered iron plate with a spoon or knife as rough as you can; sift some sugar on the tops, put half a dozen comtits on each, and just sprinkle

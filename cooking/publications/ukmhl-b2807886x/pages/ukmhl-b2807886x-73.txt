Your black currants must be quite ripe, and as large as you can get them. You need not pick them ofl the stalks, but put them as they are into a glazed earthen- ware pan; put them into the oven, with a cloth tied over the top, and let them remain there till they get soft, then rub them through a cane sieve, that will not let them pass through whole, and strain the juice fioni them with a fine hair or lawn sieve. Make some red currants nearly boiling hot, and strain the juice from them, as directed in making of Red Currant Jelly. Mix equal quantities of both sorts of juice, and to each pint of the mixture put a pound of good loaf-sugar. Then boil it in a preserving-pan that will hold at least double the quantity, for a quarter of an hour; try it a drop on a cold plate will set in about a minute, and when it will, put it in pots and glasses, and cover it over, when cold, as directed for Red Currant Jelly. BARBERRY JELLY. Get your barberries large and quite ripe, pick them from the stalks into a preserving pan, and to every pound of fruit put a pound of good loaf sugar, pow- dered. Put them over a clear fire to simmer, so as to get out the juice: stir them frequently, but do not let them boil, as that only wastes them. When reduced to a soft pulp, strain the juice from them through a fine hair or lawn sieve. Put the juice into the preserving pan, over a brisk fire, and as the scum rises, take it off; let it boil for about a quarter of an hour, then drop a little on a cold plate, and see in a minute or two if it has set; if it has, your jelly is done; if not, boil it a little more, and then try it again, till a drop on a cold plate will set in a minute or two.

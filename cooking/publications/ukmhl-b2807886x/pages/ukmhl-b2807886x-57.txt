53 MADE EASY. ORANGE PUDDING. Pare the rind very thin from two China oranges, so as not to get more of the white than you are obliged, and put it into a mortar. Break two penny sponge cakes into a basin: scoop out the insides of the oranges into a sieve which you have placed over the basin: rub the juice, and as much of the pulp as you possibly can through the sieve, upon the cakes, and let them soak. Pound the rinds of the oranges very fine in a mortar, mix them with four more sponge cakes crumbled, and soak them in two thirds of a pint of milk. Beat up the cakes that are along with the juice and pulp, and then mix all well together. Whisk up two eggs, and three yolks of eggs to a froth, and put them to the cake, with an ounce and a half of candied orange peel cut in small pieces, and sugar sufficient to sweeten it: mix all lightly together, and put it into a dish. Bake it in a moderate oven. You may garnish the top with candied orange peel cut in thin slices. BAKED APPLE PUDDING. Slice into a stewpan six large apples, which you have pared and cored, put to them a tea-cupful of water, and stew them till tender: pour the water from them; then beat them quite smooth in a basin; add about three parts of a tea-cupful of stale bread crumbs, and sweeten the whole with powdered loaf sugar. Whisk up two eggs and the yolks of two more, and add them, with some grated lemon peel and nutmeg, a little candied lemon peel cut in small pieces; and an ounce of butter. Line a dish with puff paste, and put an edging of puff paste round it; put the apples in the middle, with candied lemon peel or citron, cut in thin slices on the top, and bake it in a warm oven.

PUITS D* AMOUR. Roll out some puff paste as for patty cases, cut out as many pieces as you will require, with an oval scolloped cutter of any size you think proper, but those which are two or three inches long, are the neatest; cut the top of the paste with a sharp pointed knife, half through at each end of the oval, brush the tops over with egg, and strew some coarse grains of loaf sugar over the edge, place them on a tin, and bake in a moderate oven; roll out a piece of tart paste into a small long roll, twist it, and make it into a semicircle, to form a handle, place these on a tin and bake them. Take out the paste from the centre where you have marked it with the knife, and fill it with any sort of preserve or cream, a fine strawberry, cherry, grape, or gooseberry may be put on each, fix the handle over the centre with a little melted barley sugar, or with iceing, these form a very pretty dish for a second course. They may be made round instead of oval, and the edges of each may be strewed with blanched and chopped sweet almonds or pistachios, and the sides piped with any sort of jam or jelly. TURN-OVER PUFFS. Roll out some puff paste into a sheet a quarter of an inch thick, cut it out into pieces with a round scolloped cutter, or into square pieces with a knife; put a little jam in the centre of each, and fold or double them over, press down the thumbs a little on each side of the jam to close them, ice them as directed for Coventry^ and bake them in a moderate oven, on a clean tin.

CONNECTION ARY 42 LORD MAYORS CAKES. Break four eggs into a pan, and add eight ounces of powdered sugar to them, whisk them together well, as for Savoy Cakes, then mix in lightly half a pound of the best Hour, and a few carraway seeds; this is best done with a spoon. Make it into round drop cakes about two inches across, upon sheets of paper, on your iron plate, sift sugar over the tops, and bake them in a brisk oven. When done, cut them off the paper; and put two together with their tops outwards. Some peo- ple sprinkle carraway seeds on them, instead of sugar, before baking. DIET BREAD CAKE. But six eggs, and the yolks of six more, into a deep earthen pan or pipkin, just whisk them a little, so as to break the yolks, and make it one colour all over. In another pipkin, or clean saucepan, put one pound of loaf sugar and a quarter of a pint of water; put it on the fire, and keep stirring it till it nearly boils, then pour it gradually upon the eggs, whisking them well all the while, and keep whisking all together till quite cold; then mix in very lightly, but thoroughly, one pound of fine dry cold fiour. Put clean paper so as to cover the inside of your tins, and rise an inch above them all round; put in your paste, sift loaf sugar on the tops, and bake in a warm oven, till they are firm at top. Or, in preference, fill the tin half or three parts full of the mixture for Savoy Biscuits, and bake as before. SWEET, OR DIET BREAD RUSKS. Cut a diet bread cake into slices half an inch thick, place them upon iron plates and put them m a very hot oven, so that they may brown quickly; as soon as they are coloured on one side, turn them, and brown on the other, when they art done.

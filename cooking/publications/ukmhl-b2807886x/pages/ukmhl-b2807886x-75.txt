MADE EASY. ' 1 tie-rack to drain, and bj the next day they will be dry and tit for use. , . r You should use the long corks, and not bungs: for the bungs are cut the wrong way of the cork, and wi admit air. Choose them of a good colour and close texture. Scald them, and let the water get almost cold, then drain off the water, and scald them again with clean water, and let them stand for an hour, take them out of the water, and put them in a sieve to dry; they will be dry in about two days. This will take away any unpleasant taste, which might otherwise taint the fruit. It is a common and very good practice, to pour melted fat upon the fruit in the bottles, to the thick- ness of a penny piece, just before they are corked down; this getting cold, forms a coat over them which materi- ally assists to keep out the air. When you open them for use, first remove this coat with a spoon. When you put in the cork, squeeze it as small as you possibly can, with whatever you have that will best answer the purpose, and it should then fit so tight that you cannot get it m more than an inch; then with a small bat knock it in as far as possible. Cut the cork off even with the mouth of the bottle. When you have put all the corks in, as directed, melt some bottle-wax in a small pipkin, and with a spoon completely cover the tops of both the corks and mouths of the bottles. The place where bottled fruits are kept should be cool and dry, otherwise they are apt either to get mouldy, or ferment: If you have not a store-room on purpose, a dry cupboard in that part of the house upon which the sun shines least, and a room where you do not have a fire, should be selected. TO BOTTLE ANY KIND OF FRUIT. Whatever fruit you intend to bottle, let it be ga- thered on a dry day, and before it is perfectly ripe. Prepare your bottles as before directed, and fill them to

CONFECTIONARY 08 FRUIT JELLIES. RED CURRANT JELLY. Rub through a cane or mat sieve, with holes just small enough to prevent any of them going through whole, the same quantity of each, of red and white currants, as you intend to make into jelly; they must be as large and fine as you can get them, and quite ripe. Put them into a preserving pan over a brisk clear fire, and stir them from the bottom frequently with a wooden spoon. Let them get nearly boil- ing hot, and then strain the juice from them through a flannel bag. Measure the juice into the preserving pan, and to every pint put a pound of good loaf sugar; set it again on the fire, and as the scum rises, take it off. When it boils, it is apt to rise over, to prevent this, keep continually stirring it, and lifting some up with the spoon. Let it boil for a quarter of an hour, then try if it be done, by dropping a little in a cold plate; if it sets in a minute or two, it is done. Should it not set, it must be boiled longer; try again every mi- nute or so, till it sets; then take it off the fire, and if any scum should remain on the top, skim it carefully off. Put it into pots or glasses, and let it stand till next day to cool; fill your glasses last, and just hold them in the steam for a minute, before you pour the jelly into them, which will prevent them from cracking. Next day, cut pieces of paper to the size of the insides of the pots and glasses, dip them in brandy, and put a piece on the jelly in each, so as to cover it all over;

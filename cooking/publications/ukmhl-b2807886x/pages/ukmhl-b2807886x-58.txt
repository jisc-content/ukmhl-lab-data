CONFECTIONARY 54 then add two ounces of vermicelli; pare the rind of half a lemon very thin, and tie it up in a piece of clean cloth, with a small piece of cinnamon, and put them into the milk; let all simmer or boil gently over a slow tire, until the vermicelli has soaked up at least half the milk. Whisk up three eggs to a froth, and add them, with a little nutmeg grated, and an ounce of butter, a wine glassful of brandy, and sugar enough to sweeten it. Take out the spice-bag; and you can either boil it tor half an hour in a mould, as directed for Ratafia Pudding, or bake it in a dish. If boiled, it will re- quire wine sauce. CARROT PUDDING. Boil some carrots till tender, taking care that they are all good ones, rub six ounces of them through a hair sieve. Put three penny sponge cakes into a basin, and pour upon them a teacupful and a half of boiling milk. Whisk up six eggs to a froth; and then beat the milk and cake smooth. Mix the carrots, eggs, and cake together, with six ounces of butter, a wine-glassful and a half of brandy, and enough loaf sugar to sweeten it. Put it into a dish, garnish the top with candied orange or lemon peel cut in thin slices, and bake it in a warm oven. If you think fit, you may put a rim of puff paste round the edge of the dish; or ornament it with leaves of puff paste, or with slices of candied peel. TAPIOCA PUDDING. Put two ounces of tapioca into a mortar, and pound it quite fine; put it in a stewpan writh a pint of milk, and simmer it gently, which will soften it to a pulp. Whisk to a froth three eggs and two yolks of eggs; add to them an ounce of butter, half a glass of brandy, sugar enough to sweeten your pudding, and a little grated nutmeg. Mix this with the tapioca while hot, put it into a dish, and bake in a warm oven.

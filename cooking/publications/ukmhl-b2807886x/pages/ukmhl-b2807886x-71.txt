MADE EASY. 67 fire; when it has boiled for a quarter of an hour, try it as directed for Raspberry Jam; and when done, put it into pots, and cover it with paper dipped into brandy, and tie them over, as before directed. Red hairy gooseberries, when ripe, may be preserved in the same manner. ORANGE MARMALADE. Take Seville oranges according to the quantity you intend to make, halve them, and squeeze the juice from them; then cut out the pulp, leaving the rmd very thin; and shred it in very fine slices, boil them till ten- der, and throw them into cold water; if the oranges are not quite ripe, boil the pulp with a little water until very soft, keep stirring it to prevent its burning, squeeze it through a fine hair sieve; then mix the juice, water from the pulp, and chips together; to every pound add one pint of clarified sugar; boiled to the crackled or caramel degree, (see Sugar Boiling); then add the other ingredients, let them boil ten minutes over a brisk fire to retain the colour, or until suffi- ciently jellied; try as for Raspberry Jam. Put it into pots, and cover it over. APPLE MARMALADE. Scald apples till they will pulp from the core; then take an equal weight of sugar in large lumps, put in a little water, boil it to the ball or crack and take off all the scum: then throw in the pulp, and let it sim- mer fifteen minutes over a quick fire, as for Orange Marmalade. a very little grated lemon peel will improve it.

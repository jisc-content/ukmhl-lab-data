51 MADE EASY. water that is boiling in the stewpan. It will take rather more than an hour to boil, turn it out on a dish, pour wine once over it, and send some in a boat with it. It must be sent to table as hot as possible and is eaten with wine sauce. TO MAKE WINE SAUCE. Into a clean saucepan put two ounces of butter, put it on the fire, and when melted rub half a tablespoonlul of flour into it until it is quite smooth; mix in by de- grees a wine glassful of water, half a wine glassful of brandy, and two wine-glassfuls of white wine, with enough moist sugar to sweeten it; mix these together, put them on the fire, and keep stirring in till thick, (it ought not to boil) pour it into a sauceboat, and send to table hot. A SOUFFLE PUDDING. Prepare a quart mould with butter and raisins, as for Ratafia Pudding. Cut nine penny sponge cakes m pieces, and put them into the mould. Then whisk together six eggs, so as to break the yolks, pour upon them a pint of boiling milk, and enough sugar to sweeten it; strain it through a sieve into the mould. Cover the mould, and boil, and send it hot to table with wine sauce, as directed for Ratafia Pudding. MUFFIN, FRENCH ROLL, OR CABINET PUDDINGS, Are made the same as a Ratafia pudding, garnish- ing the mould with dried cherries and raisins, but instead of using sponge cakes and ratafias, put muffins pulled to pieces, or the crumb of Prench rolls; put in some sweetmeats, as currants, raisins, or dried cherries mixed among them, in the mould. When you boil the milk, put in a bay leaf, a stick of cinnamon, and sugar enough to sweeten it, adding rather more than for the ratafia pudding, as the sponge cakes and ratifias being sweet, do not require so much.

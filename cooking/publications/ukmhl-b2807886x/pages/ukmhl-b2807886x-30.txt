CONFECTIONARY 26 TO PREPAHlS APPLES OR PEARS FOR TARTLETS. If apples or pears are used to fill the tartlets, let them be peeled, cored, and cut in quarters; then boil them in water, till tender. Drain off nearly the whole of the water in which they were boiled, and reduce the fruit to a pulp, either by squeezing, or by passing it through a sieve or colander. Rub off the yellow rind of a lemon with some loaf sugar; scrape this off and mix with the pulp; add more sugar, if necessary, and a little lemon juice, to your palate. Put it on the fire in a well-tinned saucepan, let it simmer a few minutes, stirring it occasionally. When cold, it is ready for use. Apricots may be served in the same manner, leaving out the lemon juice. TO MAKE TARTLETS WITH FRUITS WHICH HAVE BEEN PRESERVED WITHOUT SUGAR, OR WITH FRESH RIPE FRUITS. If bottled, or ripe fruits without being preserved, are used, add sugar with the fruit; and dust them with finely powdered loaf sugar, before baking. SANDWICH PASTRY. Roll out some puff paste into a thin sheet, spread some raspberry or any other jam over it. Roll out another piece the same size and thickness as the former, and put over it; cut it out with cutters into rings, crescents, or other forms, or with a knife into diamonds, squares, triangles, or fingers; ice the tops as directed forCoven- trys, or sift loaf sugar over them, bake them in a moderately warm oven,on a clean tin, keep the door shut, that the sugar may melt on the top and appsar shin- ing, which is called French glazing; they are not to be done in this manner, or glazed, when iced as Coventrys.

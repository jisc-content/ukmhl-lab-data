14 CONFECTIONARY PATTY CASES. These should be made from the best paste, as for mince pies. Get three cutters, of different sizes, roll out the caste about three quarters of inch thick; cut out as many pieces as you want, with the large cutter; cut out the same quantity of pieces with your second- sized cutter; and with the third size, cut out some small thm pieces to put on the top of these; then with your second-sized cutter, cut the paste partly through, which you had from the large cutter, leaving, as near as you can, an equal edge round it; wash the top with egg, and bake them on an iron plate: dip each of the cutters into boiling water before using, which prevents the edge being drawn down, and they rise more evenly. When baked, take out the centre of the large pieces with a knife, as far as the mark of the cutter, and about three parts of the depth of the paste; fill these vacancies or holes with some prepared patty meat, put the other pieces on the top, and send them to table quite hot. VOL-AU-VENT. Take some paste as for patty cases, give it an extra half turn, make it about one inch and a half in thick- ness, cut it out with a large oval or round cutter, or in any other shape with a knife to suit the form and size of the dish, heat the knife or cutter in hot water, mark it round about an inch from the edge, ornament ths centre part by cutting any design with a knife, egg the top and bake it in a moderate heat; when it is rather more than three parts done, take it out, and remove the centre piece, which you reserve for a cover, scoop out the remaining part of the paste from the centre, leaving it half an inch thick at the bottom, put it in the oven again to dry or finish baking, it should be four or five inches high, and quite straight, fill it with any sort of ragout or fricasee as for patties; these are occa- sionally filled wdth a compote, or a made dish of fish, or served as a sweet entree, filled with a cream or fruit.

CONFECTIONARY 78 COMMON BULLS EYES Are made the same as common twist, except that it is pulled on the staple; and must be cut and coloured in the same manner as the best bulls eyes. COLOURED ROCK SUGAR. Boil a pint of clarified sugar in a copper or earthen- ware pan, over a clear fire, to the degree of crackled, (see Sugar Boiling;) use no acid in the boiling of this; remove it from the fire, and well mix into it a table- spoonful of iceing, by stirring it in briskly with your skimmer. As soon as the sugar and iceing is well mixed and rises up like froth, put it into a papered sieve, or into an oiled tin or mould, and when quite cold, break it in pieces. If you have not any iceing ready made, mix some sifted loaf sugar with the white of an egg, until it is quite thick, put in a tablespoon- ful, and it will answer the purpose of iceing. If you want it coloured, mix in with the iceing any of the colourings hereafter described, (see Colourings for Con- fectionary) before you put it to the sugar. SNOWY ROCK, OR SNOAV. Clarify a pound of loaf sugar, and boil it to the degree of crackled; (see Sugar Boiling,) add a table- spoonful of vinegar. You may mix in a few drops of either essence of lemon, or of the oil of peppermint. When well mixed, pour it out upon a slightly oiled marble slab; and while cooling, put it on the staple and pull it until it is quite white, when you may twist, roll, mould, or make it up into any shape you please. PEPPERMINT CAKE. Boil two pounds of raw sugar in about a teacupful of water, over a slow fire, until you perceive it begins to candy round the sides of the pan, or has reached the degree of blown, (see Sugar Boiling;) then take it off,

85 MADE EASY. sifted loaf sugar, as lightly as possible. Flavor them with any essence you please. Lay them off on white paper the shape of half an egg: sift line powdered loaf sugar on them, and blow off all that does not stick. Bake them on a board, in a very slow oven; when of a pale brown, they are done. Take them off the paper, and beat in the under or soft part with a spoon, to form a hollow and dry them; fill them with cream or any preserved fruit, and stick two together, which will form an egg. COMFITS. Get a comfit-pan of any convenient size; have a cross-bar with a hook and swivel in the centre, and two chains with hooks at the end to fasten the pan, fix one of these chains at each end of your cross-bar; let the whole be suspended from the ceiling by the hook in the centre of your cross-bar, at a convenient height to be worked with ease over a charcoal fire, or hot stove, so as to keep the pan warm, but not too hot. Prepare some mucilage of gum arabic: and clarify loaf sugar; boil it to the degree of a thread or smooth; keep the latter warm by the side of your stove or fire. Have ready some carraway seeds, almonds, &c. sifted free from all dust, put some in your comfit-pan, and give them a coating of gum arabic and flour or fine starch powder. When this is sufficiently dry, give them a coating of sugar, by throwing in the pan a ladleful of syrup, and shake the comfits, about the pan, by swinging it to and fro until the sugar is perfectly dry, when each almond or seed will have a coating of suear.

If they are for common or cheap comfits, give them occasionally a dust of flour, as you coat them. nonpariels. Nonpariels are made in the same manner as com-

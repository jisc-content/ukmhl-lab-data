PUDDINGS. liz PUDDINGS. V)|^E need not here mention, that the cloth in which you boil puddings fliould be perfe£Hy clean ; but it may not be amifs to tell the cook, that the cloth Ihould be dipped in boiling water, and dredged with flour. A bread pudding may be tied loole; but a batter pudding mufl: be tied clofe, and no pudding muA be put into the pot Dll the water boils. Puddings may be boiled in a balcn ; in which cafe, butter the bafon, and let it have plenty of wafer, and turn it frequently. As Toon as you think it is enough, take it out of the pot. and Jet it ftand a fhort time to cool. 1 hen take off the firing, wrap the cloth round the bafon, and laying the difh over it, turn the pudding into it, in doing which •you niuft take care that you do not break the pudding, as every light pudding is very liable to that accident. In making a batter pudiling, begin with mixing the flour well with a little milk, after which gradually put in the ingre- dients, and thus your pudding will be perfeitly fmooth, and without lumps. In making all forts of puddings, drain the eggs when you beat them, fo that they may have neither tread- les nor lumps in them. Bread and cuftard pud- dings that are to be baked require time, and a moderate oven to raife them ; but batter and rice puddings require a quick oven. Before you put in the pudding, remember to butter Xhe difh or pan. Veal

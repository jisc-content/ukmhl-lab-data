BOILING. I warm to the heart before the outfide gets-harJ^ To boil a leg of lamb of four pounds weight, you muft allow an hour and half. Mutton oi? beef, which you muft always be careful to dredge well with flour before you put them into the pot, do not require fo much boiling as lamb, pork, and veal, which, if they are not well boiled, will be unvvholefome ; but it is not fo much thought of, if mutton and beef be not quite fo well done. A leg of pork will take an hourâ€™s boiling iTkore than a. joint of veal of the fame lize; but never forget to,fcum the pot, let the meat be what fort it may. To hoil a.Rump of Beef. Boil a rump of beef half an hour, and then take it up. Lay it into a. large pewter difli or ftew-pan, and cut three or four gaflies all along the fide of it. Rub the gaflies with pepper and downwards, and cover it clofe. Let it flew for two hours and a half over a charcoal fire, or a very flow coal fire. When you do it in a pew- ter di(h, it is beft done over a chaffing-difli.of hot coals, with a bit or two of charcoal to keep it alive. You muft take care that the bone be chopped fo clofe, that the meat may lie perfectly fait, and pour into the difli a pint of red wine, as much hot water, two or three onions cut fmall, the hearts of eight or ten lettuces cut final 1, and a large piece of butter rolled in a little flour. Lay the flcfliy part of the meat fiat in the difli.-When the beef is enough, take it up, lay it in the difli, and pour the fauceover it. This is a difli cooked in the French manner. Builllt

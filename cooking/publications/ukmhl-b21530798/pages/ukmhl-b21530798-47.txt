The firft and moft im- portant of all thefe is clcanlinefs, not only in their own perfons, but alfo in every article ufed in the kitchen. To the wantof a due attention to copper velTels badly tinned or decayed, and foups or broths that have been fuffered to remain in them all night, many people have unhappily loft their lives,^of which the melaricholv affair at Salt-hill IS a fatal proof. To prevent any thing of this kind, the cook ftiould be particu- larly careful, in families where copper utenfils are ufed, frequently to infpedl tliem, and fee that no part of the copper be uncovered with tin ; and be careful likewife to wipe them per- feaiv dry after they have been ufed, as the leaft moifture left injhem may produce vcrdigreafe, which may aftea the health, if not endange^ the lives, of fome part of the family.

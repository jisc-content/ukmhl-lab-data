When it is full of fpawn, in March and April, it may be fo eafily miftaken for Tench, if the barbs or wattels, under the head, are carefully cut off ; and (if the fame art is taken to difguife it) its fine cafe and handfome fliape, during the reft of the year, give it fo near a refemblance to Grayling, that it is very common to ialpofe it upon the public, for the one or the other, as the different feafons give'the proper opportu- nities. The public, therefore, cannot be too much warn- ed of the danger attending fuch deceit; and the prudent matron, houfekeeper, or cook, cannot examine with too much care, whether the (kin, under the chaps of fuch fifh as are purchafed for Tench or Grayling, be perfectly whole ; fince, if they are Barbel, there will be four flight wounds under the head or chaps of each fdfh, by the barbs or wattels being cut off.

CARP-—T his fifli is faid to breed two or three times m a year, but the chief time of fpawning is ip May. It is, indeed, rather a pond, than a river fifli ; and a well fed fifli is at all times a delicate difli. CHUB.—Spawns in March, but is beff in feafon about Chriftmas. The fpawn is excellent, and very wholeforpe.

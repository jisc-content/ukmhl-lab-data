GENERAL NOTES ON MENUS, 8o Jams and pickles are nicer made at home, but good they can now be bought so cheaply that unless one grows one's own fruit and vegetables, and can be sure that they are picked dry, they are scarcely worth making. If supplies can only be bought by the week, it is well to get all the unperishable things at one marketing; but with a very limited purse it is absolutely necessary to make a sort of list or plan of what will carry us through the week, as far as fresh provisions are concerned, as there will be a risk that the money will not hold out. Fortunately for the housekeeper of the present day, provisions are far cheaper than they were a generation or so ago. Necessary groceries, such as tea and sugar, are not more than half the price they were, while tinned articles form in themselves a cheap living. Perhaps, however, in meat we realise the great difference in price most, it having been such a costly item in our daily food; and we cannot be too thankful that the foreign meat has not only put good animal food within the reach of all, but has lowered the price of the home-grown. With a few observations upon the choosing of provisions, we may close our short notes on " Marketing.^' To choose Fish, See thatat is stiff; the longer it has been kept, the more flabby it becomes. Thoroughly fresh fish will be covered with scales, the eyes will be bright, and the gills red. Do not buy fish out of season ; it is then never good, and may be very unwholesome. To choose Meat. See that it is not sticky, that blood does not run from it freely, and that the lean be a bright red, and the fat smooth and not skinny. Good meat is firm and elastic to the touch, and on looking at the lean closely, it can be seen that it has a marbled appearance from the small veins of fat among the muscles. To choose Poiiliry. See that the beak and claws of a fowl are soft, not stiff and horny ; the bones of all young birds are soft and easily broken.

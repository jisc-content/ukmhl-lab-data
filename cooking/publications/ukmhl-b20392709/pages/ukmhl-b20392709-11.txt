PREFACE. In the hope of helping^ those housewives whose difficult duty it is to provide good " daily fare " out of small weekly housekeeping allowances, this little work is put before the public. Providing for the daily needs, an easy matter where the re- sources are ample, is an extremely difficult task when there is only just sufficient to buy food for the household. The necessity of providing for those who work with their brain rather than with their hands, makes housekeeping on a limited scale more difficult for the lower middle class than for the wives of artisans. A man tired bodily with work that has rendered him hungry, can be more easily satisfied with simple plain food than another who has gone through some mental strain ; and for the wives of the latter we think and beHeve these menus will be useful. Another section, namely the very small household of perhaps but two persons, are often puzzled how to provide some variety in everyday meals, without the waste so often occurring when only a small quantity of food is needed. For these we have compiled as many menus as space would allow. In all we give thirty-two menus for town and country, for the four seasons of the year, each to be provided at an expenditure ranging from 4s. to 7s. per head ; and we offer these to perplexed housewives in the sincere hope that the information we give may lighten their labours in providing their " Daily Fare."

54 THE EXPERIENCED your dripping-pan, bafte your meat a little with it, let it dry, then duft it well with flour, bafte it with frefh butter, it will make your meat a better colour; obferve always to have a brifk clear fire, it will prevent your meat from dazing and the froth from falling, keep it a good dis- tance from the fire, if the meat is Scorched the outfide is hard, and prevents the heat from pe- netrating into the meat, and will appear enough before it be little more than half done* Time, diftance, bailing often and a clear fire, is the beft method I can prefer!be for roafling meat to perfection ; when the fleam draws near the fire, it is a Sign of its being enough, but -you will be the bed judge of that from the time you put it down, be careful when you roaffc any kind of wild fowl to keep a clear brifk fire, roaft them a light brown, but not too much : it is a great fault to roaft them till the gravy runs out of them, it takes off the fine flavour.—-Tame fowls require more roafling, they are a long time before they are hot through, and mu ft be often bailed to keep up a ftrong froth, it makes them rife better, and a finer colour.—-Pigs and geefe Should be roafted before a good fire, and turned quick. Hares and rabbits re- quire time and care, to fee the ends are roafted enough, when they are half roafted, cut the neck fkin, and let out the blood, or when they are cut up they often appear bloody at the neck.

CHAP. VII* Obfervations on making Decorations for a Table. WHEN you fpin a filver web for a defert, always take particular care your fire is clear, and a pan of water upon the fire to keep the heat from your face and fto- mach, for fear the heat (hould make you faint; you muft not fpin it before a kitchen fire, for ithefmaller the grate ir, fo that the fire be clear and hot, the better able you will be to fit a long time before it, for if you fpin a whole defert, you will be feveral hours in fpinningit; be fure to have a tin box to put every bafket in as you 4pin them, and cover them from the air, and keep them warm, until you have done the whole as your receipt diredls you. If you fpin a gold web, take care your chafing difh is burnt clear ; before you let it upon the table where your mould is, fet your ladle on the fire and keepftirring it with a wooden fkewertill it juft boils, then let it cool a little for it will not fpin when it is boiling hot, and if it grows cold it is equally as bad, but as it cools on the lides of your ladle, dip the pint of your knife in and begin to fpin round your mould as long as it will draw, then heat it again ; the only art is to keep it of a proper heat, and it will draw out like a fine thread, and of a good colour; it is a great fault to put in too much fugar at a time.

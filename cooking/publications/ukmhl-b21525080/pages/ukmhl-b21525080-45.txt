ENGLISH COOKERY BOOKS . 33 have I sent forth This book, to testifie to the scandalous W'orld that I do not altogether spend my Time idlely.’ 1664 THE COURT & KITCHIN of Elizabeth, Commonly called Joan Cromwel, The Wife of the late Usurper, Truly Described and Represented, And now made Publick for General Satisfaction. London, printed by Tho, Milbourn, for Randal Taylor in St. Martins Le Grand, 1664. A manuscript note in the B. M. copy says there should be a print as frontispiece. The paging and the lettering of the sheets are both irregular. A long and learned introduction, quoting Epictetus and Plato, is an attack on the family of Cromwell, but its object must have been to act as an advertisement of the book, which is nothing but an ordinary cookery book. The recipes are introduced by this preface, ‘ Here followes the most usual Meat and Diet observed at her Table, most of them ordinary and vulgar, except some few Rarities, but such as arrided her Palate and Expense, of which it will be no unpleasing Labour to the Reader, to peruse the Cookery, and manner of Dressing, as also her Preserves, &c.’ Two recipes have a definite personal reference attached, ‘ How to make Scotch Collops of Veal (this was almost her constant Dish) ‘ How to make Marrow Puddings (which she usually had to her Breakfast) ’.

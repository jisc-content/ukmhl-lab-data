Roberts for Edward White, 1595. There were editions of 1631 and 1639; the former is in the Bodleian. In a preface signed M. R. the book is said to have been written ‘ at the earnest request and sute of a Gentlewoman in the Country for her private use, which by these singular practices hath obtained such fame, that her name shall bee remembered for ever to the Posterity ’. In spite of the preface it is difficult to believe that a gentlewoman could have treated or even described so plainly some of the diseases mentioned. The book has no arrangement of sub- jects. Thus five consecutive recipes are, ‘ To keepe Venison from rotting ’, ‘ To keepe Peares ’, ‘ To kill Lice ’, ‘ Against drunkennesse’, ‘To make Linnen Cloth, or Yarne white’. A recipe for ‘ Diatrion Piperion ’, made of pepper, time, ginger, aniseeds, &c., moves the author or authoress to poetry.

PREFATORY NOTE In a book called ‘ Notes from a Collector’s Catalogue’ ^ I gave a list of English cookery books to the year 1700, with the name of the library in which each could be found and a collation of the various editions. The present list contains the title-pages of English books on cookery and domestic economy to the year 1850. I may repeat what was said in the former book, that my real interest is not in cookery but in the combination of cookery with medicine, which is found in most of the early books, and which, continuing through the first quarter of the nineteenth century, was gradually destroyed by the growth of railways.

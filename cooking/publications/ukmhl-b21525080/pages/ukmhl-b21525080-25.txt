ENGUSH COOKERY BOOKS 13 Non nobis solum nati sumus, sed ortus nostri sibi vendicant. Printed in London by Tho. Creede, for Y'illiam ^^ood, and are to be sold at the West end of Powles, at the signe of Tyme, 1599. This is not a cookery book, but a description of different articles of food on one side of the page and a ‘ story for table-talke ’ about each on the other. Some of the stories could certainly not be told at modern dinner-tables. There is an account of the author in Robert Masters’s History of Corpus Christi College. Buttes was elected master of the college in 1626 and vice-chancellor in 1629. ‘ He being to preach before the university as vice-chancellor on Easter-day, April i. 1632, was found hanging in his garters in his own chamber.’ There is a portrait of him in the master’s lodge. Lowndes states that there is a portrait of him in Harding’s Bio- graphical Mirror, but this seems to be a mistake. 1600 NATURALL AND ARTIFICIAL DIRECTIONS for health, derived from the best Philosophers, as well moderne, as auncient. By William Vaughan, Master of Artes, and Student in the Civill Law. London, printed by Richard Bradocke, 1600. Part of this book is on the use of foods. The author, who lived from 1577 to 1641, helped to colonize Newfoundland. 1602 {2), 1607 (3), 1617 (5), 1626 (6), 1633 (7). 1600 (?)

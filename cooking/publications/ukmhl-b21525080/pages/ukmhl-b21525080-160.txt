The ‘ advertise- ment ’ to the fourth edition gives the date. The head-line is ‘ Nourse’s Cookery ’. It is a small octavo of 336 pages, and seems a good book. ‘ Chopin ’ is used for quart and ‘ mutchkin ’ for pint. Black- woods published an edition in 1838, but can trace no earlier edition as published by them. 1820 TABELLA CIBARIA. The Bill of Fare : a Latin poem, implicitly translated and fully explained in copious and interesting Notes, relating to the Pleasures of Gastronomy, and the mysterious Art of Cookery. Ipsa memor praecepta canam ; celabitur auctor.—Hor. London, published by Sherwood, Neely, and Jones, Pater- noster Row; J. Robins and Co. Ivy Lane, Paternoster Row; and sold by all booksellers. 1820. A poem ‘ written several years ago in an idle hour and at the solicitation of a few friends mostly foreigners, who challenged the author upon the apparent impossibility of expressing, in decent Latin verses, the curious and pleasingly tangible variety of dishes which French eating-houses and hotels lavishly display upon their long and hardly intelligible Bills of Fare ’. The notes are very interesting. The author was the Abbe Ange-Denis Macquin.

There is a frontispiece representing a farm. The third edition is 1728. ‘ A sixth edition with additions ’ was published in 1732. It contains a second part, in which there is more cookery than in the first. This same ‘ sixth edition with additions ’ was reprinted in 1736, the 1732 edition of the second part being bound with it. The first part is arranged according to the months of the year. The second part has no order whatever, cures for lap-dogs being placed between recipes for making damson wine and Lisbon cakes. There is a recipe for a Hackin which Cumberland people have for breakfast on Christmas morning. ‘ And if this dish is not dressed by that time it is Day-light, the Maid is led through the Town, between two Men, as fast as they can run with her, up Hill and dowm Hill, which she accounts a great shame.’ There are two dishes which are not likely to be imitated in the present day ; one is a gammon of a badger roasted, the other is viper soup.

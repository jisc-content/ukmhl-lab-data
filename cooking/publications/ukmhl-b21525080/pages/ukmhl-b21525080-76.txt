64 ENGLISH COOKERY BOOKS Month of the Year, that no Person need be at a Loss to provide an agreeable Variety of Dishes. By Mrs. Sarah Harrison of Devonshire. London, printed for T. Worrall, at Judge Coke’s Head, over against St. Dunstan’s Church, Fleetstreet. 1733. Other editions are 1739 {2), 1748 (4), 1751 (5), 1755 (6), 1757 (also 6), 1760 (7), 1764 (8), 1777 (9). A book with the same title was published in 1783, but is an entirely different work. This book is neither original nor well arranged. Later editions are much enlarged and contain arithmetical tables and other addi- tions. The medical receipts are expanded into a supplement called ‘ Every one their own Physician : or, Charity made pleasant, by relieving their own Family, or poor neighbouring People, by cheap, easy, and safe Remedies ’. A preface to this supplement is signed ‘ Mary Morris ’. The third recipe, one for ague, prejudices one at the start against Mary Morris. ‘ Take a Spider alive, cover it with new soft crummy Bread without bruising it ; let the Patient swallow it fasting. This is an effectual Cure, but many are set against it.’ and the several Branches of these Arts necessary to be known by all good Housewives. By John Middleton, Cook to his Grace the late Duke of Bolton. Revised and Recommended by Mr. Henry Howard. London, printed for Tho. Astley, at the Rose against the North Door of St. Paul’s.

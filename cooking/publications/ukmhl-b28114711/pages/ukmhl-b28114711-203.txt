187 SALADS. SALADS. “ The dressing of the salad should be saturated with oil, and seasoned with pepper and salt before the vinegar is added. It results from this process that there never can be too much vinegar; for, from the specific gravity of the vinegar compared with oil, what is more than useful will fall to the bottom of the bowl. The salt should not be dissolved in the vinegar, but in the oil, by which means it is more equally distributed throughout the salad.”— Chaptal, a French chemist. The Spanish proverb says, that to make a perfect salad, there should be a miser for oil, a spendthrift for vinegar, a wise man for salt, and a madcap to stir the ingredients up and mix them well together.” Sydney Smith’s Receipt for Salad Dressing. Two boiled potatoes, strained through a kitchen sieve, Softness and smoothness to the salad give ; Of mordant mustard take a single spoon— Distrust the condiment that bites too soon ; Yet deem it not, thou man of taste, a fault, To add a double quantity of salt. Four times the spoon with oil of Lucca crown, And twice with vinegar procured from town ; True taste requires it, and your poet begs The pounded yellow of two well-boiled eggs. Let onions’ atoms lurk within the bowl, And, scarce suspected, animate the whole ; And lastly, in the flavored compound toss A magic spoonful of anchovy sauce. Oh, great and glorious ! oh, herbaceous meat! ’Twould tempt the dying anchorite to eat. Back to the world he’d turn his weary soul, And plunge his fingers in the salad bowl.

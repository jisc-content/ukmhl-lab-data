COMMON SENSE. 372 Baked Puddings. Beat your eggs very light—and, if you put in only one or two, whip white and yolk separately, beating the latter into the sugar before adding the whites. Fruit, riee, corn-starch, and bread puddings require a steady, moderate oven in baking. Custard and batter puddings should be put into the dish, and this into the oven, the instant they are mixed, and baked quickly. No pudding, unless it be raised with yeast, should be allowed to stand out of the oven after the ingredients are put to- gether. Give one final hard stir just before it goes in, and be sure the mould is well greased. Appee Meringue Pudding. 1 pint stewed apples. 3 eggs—whites and yolks separate. 1 cup white sugar, and one teaspoonful butter. 1 teaspoonful nutmeg and cinnamon mixed. 1 “ essence bitter almond (for the merin- gue.) Sweeten and spice, and, while the apple is still very hot, stir in the butter, and, a little at a time, the yolks. Beat all light, pour into a buttered dish, and bake ten minutes. Cover, without drawing from the oven, with a meringue made of the beaten whites, two tablespoonfuls white sugar, and the bitter almond seasoning. Spread smoothly and quickly, close the oven again, and brown very slightly. Eat cold, with white sugar sifted over the top, and send around cream to pour over it instead of sauce.

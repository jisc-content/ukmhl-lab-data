PICKLES. 473 thickly with salt. Spread out in the sun to dry; then shake off the salt, and cover with cold vinegar in which has been steeped enough turmeric to color it well. Leave it in this two weeks, to draw out the stilt and to plump the cabbage. They are then ready to pack down in the sea* soned vinegar. Do not use under six weeks or two months. Pickled Cabbage (Purple.) Quarter the cabbage. Lay in a wooden tray, sprinklfl thickly with salt, and set in the cellar until next day. Drain off the brine, wipe dry, lay in the sun two hours, and cover with cold vinegar for twelve hours. Prepare the pickle by seasoning enough vinegar to cover the cab- bage with equal quantities of mace, cloves, whole white peppers; a cup of sugar to every gallon of vinegar, and a teaspoonful of celery seed for every pint. Pack the cab- bage in a stone jar ; boil the vinegar and spices five min- utes and pour on hot. Cover and set away in a cool, dry place. This will be ripe in six weeks. Pickled Onions. Peel the onions, which should be fine white onesâ€”not too large. Let them stand in strong brine for four days, changing it twice. Heat more brine to a boil, throw in the onions, and boil three minutes. Throw them at once into cold water, and leave them there four hours. Pack in jars, interspersing with whole mace, white pepper-corns, and cloves. Fill up with scalding vinegar in which you have put a cupful of sugar for every gallon. Cork while hot. They will be ready for use in a month, but will be better at the end of three months.

COMMON SENSE. 506 double muslin bag; season to taste, and set by for use, as you need it. Warm by the small quantity, allowing to each cupful a beaten egg and two tablespoonfuls of milk. Give a good boil up to cook these, and serve with thin, crisp toast. If the patient can take it, a dash of lemon- juice improves the broth. Toast Water. >P Slices of toast, nicely browned, without a symptom of burn- ing. Enough boiling water to cover them. Cover closely, and let them steep until cold. Strain the water, sweeten to taste, and put a piece of ice in each glass- ful. If the physician thinks it safe, add a little lemon- juice. Apple Water. >p 1 large juicy pippin, the most finely-flavored you can get. 3 cups of cold waterâ€”l quart if the apple is very large. Pare and quarter the apple, but do not core it. Put it on the fire in a tin or porcelain saucepan with the water, and boil, closely covered, until the apple stews to pieces. Strain the liquor at once, pressing the apple hard in the cloth. Strain this again through a finer bag, and set away to cool. Sweeten with white sugar, and ice for drinking. It is a refreshing and palatable drink. Jelly Water. >P 1 large teaspoonful currant or cranberry jelly. 1 goblet ice-water.

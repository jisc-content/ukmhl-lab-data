497 THE SICK ROOM. knows the peculiar loathing attendant upon the idea that all food is tainted with the atmosphere of the chamber in which it is served, and if eaten in bed, tastes of the mat- tress and pillows. The room and all in it may be clean, fresh, and gweet, but the fancy cannot be dismissed. And it is wiser to humor than to reason with most sick fancies. A hired nurse is a useful, often a necessary thing, but while you are upon your feet, and mistress of your own house, delegate to no one the precious task of catering for the dear sufferer. It is an art in itself. I hope a practical knowledge of it will be taught in Women’s Medical Col- leges, when they are an established “institution” with us. I wish it were proper to record here the name of one of the kindest and best family physicians I ever knew, who had charge of my not very firm health during my girlhood. He owed much—I suppose no one ever knew really how much—of his success iu his practice to his tact and skill in devising palatable and suitable nourishment for his patients. I well remember the childish pleasure with which I would hear him say when the violence of the attack had passed—“ Now, my dear child, we must begin with kitchen physic! ” and the glow of amused expectation with which I used to watch him, as, with an arch show of mystery, he would beckon my mother from the room to receive his “ prescription; ” the impatience with which I awaited the result of the conference, and the zest with which I ate whatever he ordered. If I could have persuaded him to manage this depart- ment of my work, it would win for me the degree of M.D. with a new meaning—Mistress of Dietetics.

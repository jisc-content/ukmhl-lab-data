POTATOES. 205 Sweet, as well as Irish potatoes, are very good for pic- nic luncheon, roasted iu hot ashes. This, it will be remem- bered, was the dinner General Marion set before the Brit- ish officer as “ quite a feast, I assure you, sir. We don’t often fare so well as to have sweet potatoes and salt.” The feast was cleansed from ashes by the negro orderly’s shirt-sleeve, and served upon a natural trencher of pine- bark. Boiled Sweet Potatoes. Have them all as nearly the same size as possible; put into cold water, without any salt, and boil until a fork will easily pierce the largest. Turn off the water, and lay them in the oven to dry for five minutes. Peel before sending to table. Or, >p Parboil, and then roast until done. This is a wise plan when they are old and watery. Boiling is apt to render them tasteless. Another way still is to boil until they are almost done, when peel and bake brown, basting them with butter several times, but draining them dry before they go to the table. Phi ed Sweet Potatoes >P Parboil them, skin, and cut lengthwise into slices a quarter of an inch thick. Fry in sweet dripping or butter. Cold boiled potatoes may be cooked in this way. Or you can chop then! up with an equal quantity of cold Irish potatoes, put them into ft frying-pan with a good lump of butter, and stir until they are hot and slightly brown.

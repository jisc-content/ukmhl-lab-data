PIES. 343 in a cool place. Keep in stone jars, tied over with double covers. Add a little more liquor (if it should dry out), when you make up a batch of pies. Let the mixture stand at least twenty-four hours after it is made before it is used. Lay strips of pastry, notched with a jaggiug-iron, in a cross-bar pattern, upon the pie, instead of a top-crust. I take this opportunity of warning the innocent reader against placing any confidence whatever in dried currants. I years ago gave over trying to guess who put the dirt in them. It is always there! Gravel-stones lurking under a specious coating of curranty-looking paste, to crucify growm people’s nerves and children’s teeth; mould that changes to mud in the mouth; twigs that prick the throat, not to mention the legs, wings, and bodies of tropi- cal insects—a curious study to one interested in the ento- mology of Zante. It is all dirt / although sold to us at currant prices. Wash your currants, therefore, first in warm water, rolling up your sleeves, and rubbing the conglomerate masses apart, as you would scrub a muddy garment. Drain them in a cullender, and pass them through three more waters—cold now, but cleansing. Then spread them upon a large dish, and enter seriously upon your geologi- cal and entomological researches. “ Sultanas ”—sweet and seedless—are nearly as troublesome, but their specialty is more harmless, being stickiness and stems. Nevertheless, since John has a weakness for mince-pies (1 never saw an un-dyspeptic man who had not), it is worth your while to make them, having this consolation, that if you are wise you need not engage in the manufac- ture oftener than once, or at most, twice a winter. But let the children taste them sparingly, and never at night, if you value their health and your own sound slumbers.

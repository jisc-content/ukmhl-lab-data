290 COMMON 8ENSE. The same rules apply to waffles. Always lay hot cakes aud waffles upon a hot plate as soon as baked. Buckwheat Cakes. 1 quart buckwheat flour. 4 tablespoonfuls yeast. 1 teaspoonful salt. 1 handful Indian meal. 2 tablespoonfuls molasses—not syrup. Warm water enough to make a thin batter. Beat very well and set to rise in a warm place. If the batter is in the least sour in the morning, stir in a very little soda dissolved in hot water. Mix in an earthen crock, and leave some in the bot- tom each morning—a cupful or so—to serve as sponge for the next night, instead of getting fresh yeast. In cold weather this plan can be successfully pursued for a week or ten days without setting a new supply. Of course you add the usual quantity of flour, &c., every night, and beat up well. Do not make your cakes too small. Buckwheats should be of generous size. Some put two-thirds buck- wheat, one-third oat-meal, omitting the Indian.

Mix this up very soft with the risen sponge, adding warm water, if needed, and working in gradually Half a teacupful of molasses. Knead well, and let it rise from six to seven hours. Then work over again, and divide into loaves, putting these in well-greased, round, deep pans. The second rising should last an hour, at the end of which time bake in a moderate oven about four hours, Rapid baking will ruin it. If put in late in the day, let it stay in the oven all night.

SALADS. 189 meat. Some mix chopped lettuce with the salad ; but unless it is to be eaten within a few minutes, the vinegar will wither the tender leaves, The better plan is to heap a ^lass dish with the inner leaves of several lettuce-heads, laying pounded ice among them, and pass with the lob- ster, that the guests may add the green salad to their taste. When lettuce is out of season, the following dressing, the receipt for which was given me by a French gour- mand, may be used. Prepare the egg and coral as above, with the condiments there mentioned, but mix with the lobster-meat four table- spoonfuls of fine white cabbage, chopped small, with two small onions, also minced into almost invisible bits, a teaspoonful of anchovy or other sauce, and a tablespoouful of celery vinegar. All lobster salad should be eaten as soon as possible after the dressing is added, else it becomes unwholesome. If you use canned lobster, open and turn out the contents of the can into a china dish several hours before you mix the dressing, that the close, airless smell may pass away. Garnish the edges of the dish with cool white leaves of curled lettuce, or with a chain of rings made of the whites of the boiled eggs.

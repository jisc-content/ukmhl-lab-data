70 COMMON SENSE. I know nothing about the poisonous nature of the en- trails and crops. I do assert that the custom is unclean and unjust. And this I do without the remotest hope of arousing my fellow-housekeepers to remonstrance against established usage. Only it relieves my mind somewhat to grumble at what I cannot help. The best remedy I can propose for the grievance is to buy live fowls, and, before sending them home, ask your butcher to decapitate them ; the probabilities being greatly in favor of the supposition that your cook is too “ tinder-hearted ” to attempt the job.

I shall not soon forget my perplex- ity when, an inexperienced housekeeper and a firm believer in all “ that was writ” by older and wiser people, I stood before my neat Mott’s “ Defiance,” a fine sirloin of beef ready to be cooked on the table behind me, and read from my Instruction-book that my “fire should extend at least eight inches beyond the roaster on either side! ” I am not denying the virtues of spits and tin kitchens—only regretting that they are not within the reach of every one.

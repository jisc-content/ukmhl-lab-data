CHARLES SCRIBNER’S SONS’ HOUSEHOLD BOOKS. *A New Common Sense Hook, by Marion Harland. One Vol., 12mo, Linen. Binding. - - Brioe, $1.00. THE papers which make up the first half of Common Sense in the Nursery are not medical the- ses, but familiar talks and sug- gestions such as mothers will appreciate. At a glance then will be seen to be eminently practical, as are the recipes and miscellany which follow. The purpose of this little work is to fill the place in the nursery which the other volumes of the Common Sense series have been permitted to occupy in their appropriate departments of the household. The author states, for the comfort of those whose quiet of mind is assured only upon au- thority, that so many of these chapters as arc here reprinted have passed the scrutiny of com- petent medical authority, and have been endorsed “Approved.” Familiar Talks with Mothers.

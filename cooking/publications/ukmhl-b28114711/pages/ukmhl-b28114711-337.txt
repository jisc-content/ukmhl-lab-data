CAKE. 321 powdered sugar thickly upon each, and bake in a quick oven to a delicate brown. Try the mixture first, to make sure it is of the right consistency, and if the macaroons run into irregular shapes, beat in more sugar. This will hardly happen, however, if the mixture is already well beaten. Huckleberry Cake. 1 cup butter. 2 cups sugar. 3 cups flour. 5 eggs. 1 cup sweet milk. 1 teaspoonful soda dissolved in hot water. 1 “ nutmeg, and the same of cinnamon. 1 qt. ripe, fresh huckleberries, thickly dredged with flour. Stir the butter and sugar to a cream, add the beaten yolks; then the milk, the flour, and spice, the whites whipped stiff, and the soda.

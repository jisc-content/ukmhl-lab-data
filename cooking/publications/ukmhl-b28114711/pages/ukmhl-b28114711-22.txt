At the height—or depth—of my despondency a friend, one with a great heart and steady brain, came to my rescue. Her cheerful laugh over my dilemma rings down to me now', through all these years, refreshingly as it then saluted my ears. “Bless your innocent little heart!” she cried, in her fresh, gay voice, “ Ninety-nine out of a hundred cook- books are written by people who never kept house, and the hundredth by a good cook who yet doesn’t know how to express herself to the enlightenment of others. Com- pile a receipt book for yourself. Make haste slowly. Learn one thing at a time, and when you have mastered it, ‘ make a note on it,’ as Captain Cuttle says—never los- ing sight of the principle that you must do it in order to learn how.” Then she opened to me her own neatly-written “ Man- ual ”—the work of years, recommending, as I seized it, that I should commence my novitiate with simple dishes.

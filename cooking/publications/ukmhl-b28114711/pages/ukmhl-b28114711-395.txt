379 BAKEI) PUDDINGS. 2 tablespoonfuls melted butter. Nutmeg to taste. i teaspoonful soda dissolved in hot water. Beat the yolks very light, and having soaked the bread- crumbs well in the milk, stir these together ; then the but- ter and seasoning, with the soda ; lastly the whites. Bake to a fine brown, and eat hot with pudding-sauce. This, if well mixed and baked, is quite a different dish from the traditional and much-despised bread-pudding of stingy housekeepers and boarding-house landladies. “ Which,” says an English Josh. Billings, “ nothing can be more promiskus than a boarding-house bread-pudding.” Try mine instead, putting all the sugar into the sauce, and enough there, and you will cease to sneer. You may boil this pudding, if you like, in a floured cloth or buttered mould. Fruit Bread Pudding. 1 quart milk. 5 eggs. 2 tablespoonfuls melted butter. 2 “ (heaping) sugar. £ lb. raisins, seeded and chopped. f “ currants, well washed and picked over. Handful of shred citron, and 1 teaspoonful soda, dis- solved in hot water. 2 scant cups fine bread-crumbs, from a stale loaf. Beat the yolks light with the sugar, add the bread- crumbs when they have been well soaked in the milk, and stir until smooth. Next put in the fruit, well dredged with flour, the soda, and finally the whites, whipped to a stiff froth.

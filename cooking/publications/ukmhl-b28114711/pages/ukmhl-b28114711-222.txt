206 COMMON SENSE. CABBAGE. Boiled Cabbage. Pick off the outer green leaves, quarter, examine care- fully to be sure there are no insects in it, and lay for an hour in cold water. Then put into a pot with plenty of boiling water, and cook fifteen minutes. Throw away the water, and fill up the pot from the boiling tea-kettle. Cook until tender all through. Three-quarters of an hour will do for a good-sized cabbage when young. Late in the season you must be guided by the tenderness of the stalk. Drain well, chop, and stir in a tablespoonful of butter, pepper, and salt. Serve very hot. If you boil corned beef or pork to eat with cabbage, let the second water be taken from the pot in which this is cooking. It will flavor it nicely. Always boil cabbage in two waters. Bacon and Cabbage. This, I need hardly say, is a favorite country dish at the South. The old-fashioned way of preparing it was to boil meat and cabbage together, and serve, reeking with fat, the cabbage in quarters, soaking yet more of the es- sence from the ham or middling about which it lay. In this shape it justly earned a reputation for grossness and indigestibility that banished it, in time, from many tables. Yet it is a savory and not unwholesome article of food in winter, if the cabbage be boiled in two waters, the second being the “ pot liquor ” from the boiling meat. Drain thoroughly in a cullender, pressing out every drop of water that will flow, without breaking the tender leaves ; and when the meat is dished, lay the cabbage neatly about it, and upon each quarter a slice of hard-boiled egg. When you eat, season with pepper, salt, and vinegar.

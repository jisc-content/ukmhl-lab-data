COMMON SENSE. 456 Boil the juice of the currants with the strawberries half an hour, stirring all the time. Add the sugar when you have dipped out nearly all the juice, leaving the fruit quite dry, and boil up rapidly for about twenty minutes, skimming carefully. Put in small jars, with brandied tis- sue-paper over the top. You can omit the currant juice, but the flavor will not be so fine. Raspberry Jam. >p if lb. of sugar to every lb. fruit. Put the fruit on alone, or with the addition of a pint of currant juice to every four pounds of fruit. Boil half an hour, mashing and stirring well. Dip out most of the boiling juice before adding sugar, and cook twenty minutes more. Blackberry jam is very nice made as above, leaving out the currant juice. Gooseberry Jam Is made in the same manner as raspberry, only the cur- rant juice is omitted, and the gooseberries boiled one hour without the fruit, and another after it is put in. The fruit must be ripe. Ripe Tomato Preserves. >P 7 lbs. round yellow, or egg tomatoesâ€”-peeled. 7 lbs. sugar, and juice of three lemons. Let them stand together over night. Drain off the syrup and boil it, skimming well. Put in the tomatoes and boil gently twenty minutes. Take out the fruit with a perfo- rated skimmer, and spread upon dishes. Boil the syrup down until it thickens, adding, just before you take it up, the juice of three lemons. Put the fruit into the jars and fill up with hot syrup. When cold, seal or tie up.

COMMON SENSE. 434 satisfaction to ray guests and family, that I eagerly em- brace ihe opportunity of circulating the good news. Self-freezing Ice-Cream. 1 quart rich milk. 8 eggs—whites and yolks beaten separately and very light. 4 cups sugar. 3 pints rich sweet cream. 5 teaspoonluls vanilla or other seasoning, or 1 vanilla bean, broken in two, boiled in the custard, and left in until it is cold. Heat the milk almost to boiling, beat the eggs light, add the sugar, and stir up well. Pour the hot milk to this, little by little, beating all the while, and return to the fire —boiling in a pail or saucepan set within one of hot water. Stir the mixture steadily about fifteen minutes, or until it is thick as boiled custard. Pour into a bowl and set aside to cool. Wheu quite cold, beat in the cream, and the flavoring, unless you have used the bean. Have ready a quantity of ice, cracked in pieces not larger than a pigeon egg—the smaller the better. You can manage this easily by laying a great lump of ice be- tween two folds of coarse sacking or an old carpet, tucking it in snugly, and battering it, through the cloth, with a sledge-hammer or mallet until fine enough. There is no waste of ice, nor need you take it in your hands at all— only gather up the corners of the carpet or cloth, and slide as much as you want into the outer vessel. Use an ordi- nary old-fashioned upright freezer, set in a deep pail; pack around it closely, first, a layer of pounded ice, then one of rock salt—common salt will not do so well. In this order fill the pail ; but before covering the freezer-lid, remove it

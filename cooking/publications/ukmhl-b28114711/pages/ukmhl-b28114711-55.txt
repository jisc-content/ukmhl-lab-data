39 FISH Have ready a sauce prepared thus:— To one gill boiling water add as much milk, and when it is scalding-hot, stir in—leaving the sauce-pan on the fire—two tablespoonfuls of butter, rolled thickly in flour ; as this thickens, two beaten eggs. Season with salt and chopped parsley, and when, after one good boil, you with- draw it from the fire, add a dozen capers, or pickled nas- turtium seeds, or, if you prefer, a spoonful of vinegar in which celery-seeds liave.been steeped. Put the fish into a hot dish, and pour the sauce over it. Some serve in a butter-boat; but I fancy that the boiling sauce applied to the. steaming fish imparts a richness it cannot gain later. Garnish with sprigs of parsley and circles of hard-boiled eggs, laid around the edge of the dish. Rock-Fish. Rock-fish and river-bass are very nice, cooked as above, but do not need to be boiled so long as codfish. Boiled Codfish. (Salt.) Put the fish to soak over night in lukewarm water—as early as eight o’clock in the evening. Change this for more warm water at bed-time and cover closely. Change again in the morning and wash off' the salt. Two hours before dinner plunge into very cold water. This makes it firm. Finally, set over the fire with enough lukewarm water to cover it, and boil for half an hour. Drain well; lay it on a hot dish, and pour over it egg-sauce prepared as in the foregoing receipt, only substituting the yolks of ktwo hard-boiled eggs, rubbed to a paste with butter, for the beaten raw egg. This is a useful receipt for country housekeepers who can seldom procure fresh cod. Salt mackerel, prepared in the 8ame way, will repay the care and time required, so supe- rior is it to the Friday’s dish of salt fish, as usually served.

112 COMMON SENSE. Roasted l:ver is very good cold, cut iuto slices like tougue. Calf’s Liver (Fried). Slice the liver smoothly, and lay in salt and water to draw out the blood. Lard each slice, when you have wiped it dry, with slices of fat salt pork, drawn through at regu- lar distances, and projecting slightly on each side. Lay in a cleau frying-pan and fry brown. When done, take out the slices, arrange them neatly on a hot dish, and set aside to keep warm. Add to the gravy in the frying-pan a chopped onion, a half-cup of hot water, pepper, the juice of a lemon, and thicken with brown flour. Boil up well, run through a cullender to remove the onion and the bits of crisped pork that may have been broken off in cooking, pour over the liver, and serve hot. Pigs’ livers can be cooked in the same way. Calf’s Liver (Slewed). Slice the liver and lay in salt and water an hour. Then cut into dice and put over the fire, with enough cold water to cover it well. Cover and stew steadily for an hour, when add salt, pepper, a little mace, sweet marjoram, parsley, and a teaspoonful Worcestershire sauce. Stew again steadily, not fast, for half an hour longer, when put in a tablespoonful of butter, two of browned flour—wet with cold water, a teaspoonful of lemon-juice and one of currant jelly. Boil five minutes longer, and dish. A little wine is an improvement. Or, Tut in with the liver-dice some of salt pork—say a hand- ful—and when you season, a chopped onion, and omit the jelly at the last, substituting some tomato catsup.

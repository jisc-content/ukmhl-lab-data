CATSUPS AND FLAVORED VINEGARS. 181 Mushroom Catsup. 2 quarts of mushrooms. 1 lb. of salt. Lay in an earthenware pan, in alternate layers of mush- rooms and salt; let them lie six hours, then break into bits. Bet in a cool place, three days, stirring thoroughly every morning. Measure the juice when you have strained it, and to every quart allow half an ounce of allspice, the same quantity of ginger, half a teaspoonful of powdered mace, a teaspoonful of cayenne. Put into a stone jar, cover closely, set in a saucepan of boiling water over the fire, and boil five hours hard. Take it off, empty into a porcelain ket- tle, and boil slowly half an hour longer. Let it stand all night in a cool place, until settled and clear. Pour off carefully from the sediment, and bottle, filling the flasks to the mouth. Dip the corks in melted rosin, and tie up with bladders. The bottles should be very small, as it soon spoils when exposed to the air. Imitation Worcestershire Sauce. 3 teaspoonfuls cayenne pepper. 2 tablespoonfuls walnut or tomato catsup (strained through muslin). 3 shallots minced fine. 3 anchovies chopped into bits. 1 quart of vinegar. Half-teaspoonful powdered cloves. Mix and rub through a sieve. Put in a stone jar, set in a pot of boiling water, and heat until the liquid is so hot you can not bear your finger in it. Strain, and let it stand in the jar, closely covered, two days, then bottle for use.

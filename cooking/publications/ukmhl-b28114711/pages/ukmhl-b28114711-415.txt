399 BOILED BUDDINGS. Boiled Fruit Pudding. Prepare a paste iu accordance with either of the fore- going receipts, but roll into one sheet. Lay apples, peaches, or berries in the centre, paring and slicing the fruit; sprinkle with sugar, and close the paste over them as you would a dumpling. Dip a stout cloth in hot water, flour the inside, put in' the pudding, tie tightly, and boil two hours and a half. Eat hot with sauce. Rice Dumplings. 1 lb. rice boiled without stirring, until soft, and at the top dry. 12 pippins, pared and cored. Strawberry marmalade or crab-apple jelly. Let the rice cool upon a sieve or coarse cloth, that it may dry at the same time. Dip your dumpling cloths in hot water ; wring them out and Hour well inside. Put a handful of the cold rice upon each, spreading it out into a smooth sheet. Lay iu the centre an apple; fill the hole left by the core with marmalade or jelly ; draw up the cloth carefully to enclose the apple with a coating of rice ; tie, and boil one hour. Turn over with care; pour sweet sauce or rich sweet- ened cream over them, and send around more in a boat with them.

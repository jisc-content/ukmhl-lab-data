Yolks of two eggs, beaten light. Boil the veal and water in a covered saucepan very slowly until reduced to one quart of liquid ; strain, skim, season with salt, and stir in the soaked sago (having pre- viously warmed it by setting for half an hour in a sauce- pan of boiling water, and stirring from time to time.) Simmer half an hour, taking care it does not burn ; beat in the cream and eggs; give one good boil up, and turn out. This is excellent for consumptives.

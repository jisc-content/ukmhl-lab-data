THE SICK-ROOM. 507 Beat up well for a fever-patient. Wild cherry or blackberry jelly is excellent, prepared in like manner for those suffering with summer complaint. Flax-seed Lemonade. >p 4 tablespoonfuls flax-seed (whole.) 1 quart boiliug water poured upon the flax-seed. Juice of two lemons, leaving out the peel. Sweeten to taste. Steep three hours in a covered pitcher. If too thick, put in cold water with the lemon-juice and sugar. Ice for drinking. It is admirable for colds. Slippery-elm Bark Tea. Break the bark into bits, pour boiling water over it, cover and let it infuse until cold. Sweeten, ice, and take for summer disorders, or add lemon-juice and drink for a bad cold. Apple Toddy. Boil a large juicy pippin in a quart of water, and when it has broken to pieces strain off the water. While it is still boiling-hot, add a glass of fine old whiskey, a little lemon-juice, and sweeten to taste. Take hot at bed-time for influenza. Milk Punch. >B 1 tumbler of milk, well sweetened. 2 tablespoonfuls best brandy, well stirred in. I have known very sick patients to be kept alive for days at a time by this mixture, and nothing else, until Nature could rally her forces. Give very cold with ice.

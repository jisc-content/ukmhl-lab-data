469 PICKLES. Boil fast without stirring, an hour, or until it crisps in cold water. Pull white with the tips of your fingers. Since children must eat candy, this is the best you can give them. It is very nice. Flavor to taste. PICKLES. Use none but the best cider vinegar ; especially avoid the sharp colorless liquid sold under that name. It is weak sulphuric acid, warranted to riddle the coat of any stomach, even that of an ostrich, if that bird were so bereft of the instinct of self-preservation as to make a lunch of bright-green cucumber-pickle seven times a week. If you boil pickles in bell-metal, do not let them stand in it one moment when it is off the fire; and see for your- self that it is perfectly clean and newly scoured before the vinegar is put in. Keep pickles in glass or hard stoneware; look them over every month ; remove the soft ones, and if there are several of these, drain off and scald the vinegar, adding a cup of sugar for each gallon, and pour hot over the pickles. If they are keeping well, throw in a liberal handful of sugar for every gallon, and tie them up again. This tends to preserve them, and mellows the sharpness of the vine- gar. This does not apply to sweet pickle. Pickle, well made, is better when a year old than at the end of six months. I have eaten walnut pickle ten years old that was very fine. Keep your pickles well covered with vinegar. If you use ground spices, tie them up in thin muslin bags.

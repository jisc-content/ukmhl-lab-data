429 CUSTARDS, RLANC-M ANGUS, ETC. jollies made from the modern gelatine are not comparable in beauty and flavor to those prepared from the genuine feet. Seeing means taste as well as belief with them, and when they handle and behold the beloved feet, they know what they are about. Gelatine, they will darkly and dis- gustfully assert, is made of horn-shavings and hoofs and the like, and no more fit to be used for cooking purposes than so much glue. Nevertheless, while gelatine is so clean, bright, and con- venient, housewives who find the days now but half as long as did their mothers, despite labor-saving machines, will turn a deaf ear to these alarmists, and escape the tedious process above-described by using the valuable sub- stitute. Wine Jelly. >J< 3 cups of sugar. 1 pint of wine—pale Sherry or White. 1 cup of cold water. 1 package Coxe’s gelatine. Juice of two lemons and grated peel of one. 1 quart of boiling water. 1 good pinch of cinnamon. Soak the gelatine in the cold water one hour. Add to this the sugar, lemons, and cinnamon; pour over all a quart of boiling water, and stir until the gelatine is thoroughly dissolved.

20 COMMON SENSE. ftud add, before takiug up, a cup of sweet milk (cream is better) in which has been stirred a tablespoonful of rice- flour, arrow-root, or corn-starch. When it has fairly boiled up, serve without further straining, with small squares of toast in the tureen. Season with salt and pepper. Asparagus (Green soup.) 3 lbs. veal—cut into small pieces. £ ib. salt pork. 3 bunches asparagus. 1 gallon water. Cut the entire stalk of the asparagus into pieces an inch long, and when the meat has boiled one hour, add half of the vegetable to the liquor in the pot. Boil two hours longer and strain, pressing the asparagus pulp very hard to extract all the green coloring. Add the other half of the asparagus—(the heads only, which should be kept in cold water until you are ready for them), and boil twenty minutes more. Then proceed as with the asparagus white soup, omitting the milk, thickening, aud salt. The pork will supply the latter seasoning. Tomato ( Winter soup.) 3 lbs. beef. 1 qt. canned tomatoes. 1 gallon water. A little onion. Pepper and salt. Let the meat and water boil for two hours, until the liquid is reduced to little more than two quarts. Then stir in the tomatoes, and stew all slowly for three-quarters of an hour longer. Season to taste, strain, and serve.

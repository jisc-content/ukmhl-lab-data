150 COMMON SENSE. Remove the tapes with care; dish, and when you have strained the gravy, pour over the meat. This is a most savory dish. Venison Steaks. >J< These are taken from the neck or haunch. Have your gridiron well buttered, and fire clear and hot. Lay the steaks on the bars and broil rapidly, turning often, not to lose a drop of juice. They will take three or four minutes longer to broil than beef-steaks. Have readv in a hot chafing-dish a piece of butter the size of an egg for each pound of venison, a pinch of salt, a little pepper, a tablespoouful currant-jelly for each pound, and a glass of wine for every four pounds. This should be liquid, and warmed by the boiling water under the dish by the time the steaks are done to a turn. If you have no chafing-dish, heat in a saucepan. Lay each steak in the mixture singly, and turn over twice. Cover closely and let all heat to- gether, with fresh hot water beneath—unless your lamp is burning—for five minutes before serving. If you serve in an ordinary dish, cover and set in the oven for the same time. Or, If you wish a plainer dish, omit the wine and jelly ; pepper and salt the steaks when broiled, and lay butter upon them in the proportion I have stated, letting them stand between hot dishes five minutes before they go to table, turning them three times in the gravy that runs from them to mingle with the melted butter. Delicious steaks cor- responding to the shape of mutton chops arc cut from the loin and rack. Venison Cutlets. >£< Trim the cutlets nicely, and make gravy of the refuse bits in the proportion of a cup of cold water to half a pound

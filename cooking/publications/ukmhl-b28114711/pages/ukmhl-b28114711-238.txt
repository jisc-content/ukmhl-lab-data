COMMON SENSE. 222 Green Corn Pudding. >J< 1 quart milk. 5 eggs. 2 tablespoonfuls melted butter. 1 “ white sugar. 1 dozen ears of corn—large ones. Grate the corn from the cob; beat the whites and yolks of the eggs separately. Put the corn aud yolks together, stir hard, and add the butter; then the milk gradually, beating all the while; next the sugar and a little salt; lastly the whites. Bake slowly at first, covering the dish, for an hour. Remove the cover, and brown finely. This is a most delicious accompaniment to a meat course, when properly mixed and baked. Warm up what is left from dinner for breakfast, by moistening it with a little warm milk, and stirring in a saucepan until smoking hot. You can make this pudding from canned corn in winter, chopping the corn fine. Green Corn Fritters or Cakes. >J< Grate the corn, and allow an egg and a half for every cupful, with a tablespoonful of milk or cream. Beat the eggs well, add the corn by degrees, beating very hard; salt to taste; put a tablespoonful of melted butter to every pint of corn; stir in the milk, and thicken with just enough flour to hold them together —say a tablespoonful for every two eggs. You may fry in hot lard, as you would fritters, but a better plan is to cook upon a griddle, like batter cakes. Test a little first, to see that it is of the right consistency. Eaten at dinner or breakfast, these always meet with a cordial welcome.

BREAD. 283 yeast, and set aside in an open vessel and warm place to ferment. When it ceases to effervesce, bottle and set in ice-house. This yeast is very nice and white, and is preferred by many who dislike the bitter taste of hops. It is also con- venient to make when hops cannot be obtained. Yeast Cakes. 2 quarts water (cold.) 1 quart pared and sliced potatoes. Double-handful hops, tied in coarse muslin bag. Flour to make stiff batter. 1 cup Indian meal. Boil the potatoes and hop-bag in two quarts of water for three-quarters of an hour. Remove the hops, and while boiling hot, strain the potatoes and water through a cul- lender into a bowl. Stir into the scalding liquor enough flour to make a stiff batter. Beat all up well; add two tablespoonfuls lively yeast and set in a warm place to rise. When light, stir in a cup of Indian meal, roll into a sheet a quarter of an inch thick, and cut into round cakes. Dry these in the hot sun, or in a very moderate oven, taking care they do not heat to baking. It is best to put them in after the fire has gone down for the night, and leave them in until morning. When entirely dry and cold, hang them up in a bag in a cool, dry place. < Use one cake three inches in diameter for a loaf of fair size; soak in tepid water until soft, and add a pinch of soda or saleratus, then mix. These cakes will remain good a month in summer, two in winter.

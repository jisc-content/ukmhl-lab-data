Stew the gooseberries ten minutes—very slowly, not to break them. Cut your slices of bread to fit your pudding- dish, and toast to a light brown on both sides. (Cut off all the crust before toasting.) Dip each slice, while hot, in milk, and spread with the melted butter. Cover the bottom of the dish with them ; put next a layer of the gooseberries, sprinkled thickly with sugar ; more toast, more berries, and so on, until the dish is full. Cover closely and steam in a moderate oven twenty or twenty- five minutes. Turn out upon a hot dish and pour over it a good pudding-sauce.

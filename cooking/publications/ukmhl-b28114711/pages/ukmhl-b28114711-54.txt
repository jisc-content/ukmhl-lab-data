Some cooks add the finer meat before straining, boiling all together five hours; then strain, thicken, and put in the green fat, cut into lumps an inch long. This makes a handsomer soup than if the meat is left in. For the mock eggs, take the yolks of three hard-boiled eggs, and one raw egg well beaten. Rub the boiled eggs into a paste with a teaspoonful of butter, bind with the raw egg, roll into pellets the size and shape of turtle-eggs, and lay in boiling water for two minutes before dropping into the soup. Force-meat balk for the above- Six tablespoonfuls turtle-meat chopped very fine. Rub to a paste with the yolks of two hard-boiled eggs; table- spoonful of butter, and, if convenient, a little oyster- liquor. Season with cayenne, mace, and half a teaspoon- ful of white sugar. Bind with a well-beaten egg ; shape into balls; dip in egg, then powdered cracker, fry in but- ter, and drop into the soup when it is served.

Boiled Codfish. {Fresh.) >P Lav the fish in cold water, slightly salted, for half an hour before it is time to cook it.

Sew up the edges in such a manner as to envelop the fish entirely, yet have but one thickness of the cloth over any part. The wrapping should be fitted neatly to the shape of the piece to be cooked. Put into the fish-kettle, pour on jdenty of hot water, and boil brisklyâ€”fifteen minutes for each pound.

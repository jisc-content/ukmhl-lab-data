404 COMMON SENSE. done, with a skimmer, shaking it to dislodge any drops of lard that may adhere; pile in a hot dish, sift sugar over them, and send instantly to the table. Fry as many at a time as the kettle will hold, and send in hot fresh ones while the batter lasts. A round-bottomed saucepan or kettle, rather wide at top, is best for frying them. Use a frying-pan for pancakes; heat it; put in a tea- spoonful or two of lard and run it quickly over the bottom; then pour in a large ladleful of batter—enough to cover the bottom of the pan with a thin sheet. Turn with a tin spatula, very carefully, to avoid tearing it. The frying- pan should be a small one. Have ready a hot dish ; turn out the pancake upon it, cover with powdered sugar, and roll up dexterously like a sheet of paper. Send half a dozen to table at once, keeping them hot by setting the dish in the oven until enough are baked. I am thus explicit in these general instructions to save myself the trouble, and the reader the tedium, of a repeti- tion under each receipt. In olden times it was a boast of notable cooks that they -lould toss a pancake from the pan out of the top of the chimney with such accuracy of calculation, that it would *nrn itself on the way back, and settle in its place, ready, ike St. Lawrence, to have the other side fried. I never vAw a pancake tossed, although in my childish days I saw hundreds fried by the honorable tribe—now so fast pass- ing away—of Old Virginia cooks. I do not advise this acrobatic system of culinary exploit, especially for be- ginners. Indeed, I doubt if the pancakes would be found equal to the journey in these days of tight chimney-throats and cooking stoves. They roust be out of practice as veil as their manufacturers. Be careful not to have too much grease in the pan.

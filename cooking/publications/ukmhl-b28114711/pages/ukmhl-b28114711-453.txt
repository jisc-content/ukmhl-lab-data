437 ICE-CREAM AND OTHER ICES. 2 tablespoonfuls of rose-water to prevent oiling. 3 pints cream—fresh and sweet. Nearly 2 cups of sugar. 1 tablespoonful of arrowroot, wet up with cold water.

Strain the cream, pressing the bag hard to get the full flavor of the almonds, return to the inner saucepan and stir in the arrowroot until the cream thickens—say five minutes.

If you wish to mould your cream in fancy shapes, open your freezer two hours after the second stirring and trans- fer the cream to a tight mould, having given it a third vigorous beating. Pack this down in ice and salt, and let it stand two hours longer than you would have done had it remained in the freezer.

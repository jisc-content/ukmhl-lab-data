GRIDDLE-CAKES, WAFFLES, ETC. 289 Mould with the hands into thin oblong cakes, lay in a well-greased pan, and bake very quickly. The common way is to mould into oval mounds, higher in the middle than at the ends, shaping those rapidly and lightly with the hands, by tossii.g the dough over and over. This is doue with great dexterity by the Virginia cooks, and this corn-meal pone forms a part of every dinner. It is broken, not cut, and eaten very hot. Ash Cake is mixed as above. A clean spot is swept upon the hot hearth, the bread put down and covered with hot wood ashes. It must be washed and wiped dry before it is eaten. A neater way is to lay a cabbage-leaf above and below the pone. The bread is thus steamed before it is baked, and is made ready for eating by stripping off the leaves. Fried Pone. Instead of moulding the dough with the hands, cut into slices with a knife. Try out some fat pork in a frying- pan, and fry the slices in the gravy thus obtained to a light-brown. Griddle-Cakes, Waffles, etc. If you have not used your griddle or waffle-iron for some time, wash it off hard with hot soap and water wipe and rub well with dry salt. Heat it and grease with a bit of fat salt pork on a fork. It is a mistake, besides being slovenly and wasteful, to put on more grease than is absolutely necessary to prevent the cake from sticking. A piece of pork an inch square should last for several days. Put on a great spoonful of butter for each cake, and before filling the griddle test it with a single cake, to be sure that all is right with it as well as the batter. 18

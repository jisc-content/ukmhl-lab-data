FISH. 49 Serve upon a hot dish, and lay a good piece of butter upon the fish. Broiled Shad. (Salt.) Soak over night in lukewarm water. Take out in the morning and transfer to ice-cold for half an hour. Wipe very dry, and broil as you do fresh shad. Fried Shad. This is a popular dish upon Southern tables, and is good anywhere. Clean, wash, and wipe a fine roe-shad ; split and cut each side into four pieces, leaving out the head, and removing fins and tail. Sprinkle with salt and pep- per, and dredge with flour. Have ready a frying pan of boiling hot lard or drippings; put in the fish and fry brown, turning at the end of five minutes to cook the other side. Fry the roe in the same way; lay the fish in the middle of the dish, and the roe outside of it; garnish with water-cresses and sprigs of pickled cauliflower, and eat with catsup. Baked Shad. >J< Clean, wash, and wipe the fish, which should be a largo one. Make a stuffing of grated bread-crumbs, butter, salt, pepper, and sweet herbs. Stuff* the shad and sew it up. Lay it in the baking-pan, with a cupful of water to keep it from burning, and bake an hour, basting with but- ter and water, until it is tender throughout and well browned. Take it up, put in a hot dish and cover tightly, while you boil up the gravy with a great spoonful of cat- sup, a tablespoonful of browned flour which has been wet with cold water, the juice of a lemon, and, if you want to have it very fine, a glass of Sherry or Madeira. Garnish with sliced lemon and water-cresses. You may pour the gravy around the fish, or serve in a sauce-boat. Of 3

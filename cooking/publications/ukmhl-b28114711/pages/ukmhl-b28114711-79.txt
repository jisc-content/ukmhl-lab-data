SHELL-FISH. 63 Chop the oysters very fme. Beat the yolks and whites of the eggs separately as for nice cake—the white until it stands in a heap. Put three tablespoonfuls of butter in a frying-pan, and heat while you arc mixing the omelet. Stir the milk into a deep dish with the yolk, and season. Next put in the chopped oysters, beating vigorously as you add them gradually. When they are thoroughly in- corporated, pour in the spoonful of melted butter; finally, whip in the whites lightly and with as few strokes as pos- sible. If the butter is hot, and it ought to be, that the omelet may not stand uncooked, put the mixture into the pan. Do not stir it, but when it begins to stiffen—“ to set,” in culinary phrase, slip a broad-bladed, round-point- ed dinner-knife around the sides, and cautiously under the omelet, that the butter may reach every part. As soon as the centre is fairly “ set,” turn out into a hot dish. Lay the latter bottom upward over the frying-pan, which must he turned upside-down dexterously. This brings the browned side of the omelet uppermost. This omelet is delicious and easily made. Oyster Pie. >£< Make a rich puff-paste; roll out twice as thick as for a fruit-pie for the top crust—about the ordinary thickness for the lower. Line a pudding-dish with the thinner, and fill with crusts of dry bread or light crackers. Some use a folded towel to fill the interior of the pie, but the above expedient is preferable. Butter the edges of the dish, that you may be able to lift the upper crust without breaking. Cover the mock-pie with the thick crust, orna- mented heavily at the edge, that it may lie the more qui- etly, and bake. Cook the oysters as for a stew, only beating into them at the last two eggs, and thickening with a spoonful of fine cracker-crumbs or rice-flour. They should

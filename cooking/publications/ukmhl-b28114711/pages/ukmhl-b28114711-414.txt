COMMON SENSE. 398 a bag, the same size and shape as the “ valise.” Flour the bag well before putting iu the pudding, having pre- viously dipped it—the cloth—into hot water, and wring it out. Boil an hour and a half. Serve hot with sauce, and cut crosswise in slices half an inch thick. Boiled Apple Dumplings. (No. 1.) >B Make a paste according to the above receipt; cut in squares, and put in the centre of each an apple, pared and cored. Bring the corners together; enclose each dump- ling in a small square cloth, tied up bag-wise, leaving room to swell. Each cloth should be dipped in hot water, wrung out aud floured on the inside before the apple is put in. Boil one hour. Apple Dumplings. (No. 2.) 1 quart flour. i lb. suet. 1 teaspoouful salt. £ teaspoonful soda dissolved in hot water. 1 “ cream-tartar sifted in the flour. Cold water enough to make into a tolerably stiff paste. Boll out, cut into squares, put in the middle of each a fine, juicy apple, pared and cored. Fill the hole left by the core with marmalade, or with sugar wet with lemon- juice. Stick a clove in the sugar. Close the paste, tie up in the cloths, when you have wet them with hot water and floured them, and boil one hour. A pleasing idea for dumpling cloths is to crochet them in a close stitch with stout tidy cotton. They are easily dono, wash and wear well, and leave a very pretty pattern upon the paste when they are opened. Crochet them round, with a cord for drawing run into the outer edge.

Have ready some clean, very cold water, in a deep wooden tray, and into this plunge the dasher when you draw it from the churn. The butter will float off, leaving the dasher free. Having collected every par- ticle, gather behind a wooden butter-shovel and drain off the water, squeezing and pressing the butter with the shovel. Set in a cool place for an hour to harden—a necessary meas- ure in summer—then work and knead it with a wooden ladle until not another drop of water exudes, and the but- ter is like yellow marble in polish and closeness of pores.

If you admit the air every day, it is apt to grow strong. A pretty plate of but-

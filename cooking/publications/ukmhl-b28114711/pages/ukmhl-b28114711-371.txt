Allow three peach-kernels, chopped fine, to each pie; pour in a very little water, and bake with an upper crust, or with cross- bars of paste across the top. Some simply pare the peaches and put in whole, pack- ing them well, and sweetening freely- In this case they should be covered entirely with crust.

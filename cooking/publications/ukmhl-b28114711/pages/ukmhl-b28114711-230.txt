COMMON SENSE. 214 ful morning dish, and hereby return thanks to the unknown friend to whom I am indebted for the receipt. Asparagus (boiled.') Cut your stalks of equal length, rejecting the woody or lower portions, and scraping the white part which re- mains. Throw into cold water as you scrape them. Tie in a bunch with soft strings—muslin or tape—and put into boiling water slightly salted. If very young and fresh, it is well to tie in a piece of coarse net to protect the tops. Boil from twenty to forty minutes, according to the age. Just before it is done, toast two or three slices of bread, cutting off the crust; dip in the asparagus liquor, butter, and lay in a hot dish. When you take up the asparagus, drain, unbind the bundle, and heap it upon the toast, with bits of butter between the stalks. Asparagus and Eggs. Cut twenty-five or thirty heads of asparagus into bits half an inch long, and boil fifteen minutes. Have a cup- ful of rich drawn butter in a saucepan, and put in the asparagus when you have drained it dry. Ileat together to a boil, seasoning with pepper and salt, and pour into a buttered bake-dish. Break five or six eggs carefully over the surface; put a bit of butter upon each ; sprinkle with salt, and pepper, and put in the oven until the eggs are set. Or, >$< You may beat the eggs—yolks and whites separately—to a froth; season with butter, pepper, and salt; stir them together, with the addition of three tablespoonfuls of milk or cream, and pour evenly over the asparagus mixture in the dish. This is decidedly the better way of the two, although somewhat more troublesome.

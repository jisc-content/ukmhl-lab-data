COMMON SENSE. 416 constantly until it thickens. Stir up well when almost cold and pour into cups. Make a meringue of the whites of two eggs and two tablespoonfuls powdered sugar, fla- vored with bitter almond, and heap upon each cup. Quaking Custard. >J« 3 cups milk. Yolks of four eggs—reserving the whites for me- ringue. 2 package Cooper’s or Coxe’s gelatine. 6 tablespoonfuls sugar. Vanilla or lemon flavoring. Juice of a lemon in meringue. Soak the gelatine in a cup of the cold milk two hours. Then heat the rest of the milk to boiling, add that in which the gelatine is, and stir over the fire until the latter is quite dissolved. Take from the fire, and let it stand five minutes before putting in the beaten yolks and sugar. Heat slowly until it begins to thicken perceptibly, not boil—say seven or eight minutes, stirring constantly. When nearly cold, having stirred it every few minutes during the time, flavor it, wash out your mould in cold water, and without wiping it, pour in the custard and set on the ice or in a cold place to harden. When quite firm, turn into a cold dish, loosening it by wrapping about the mould a cloth wrung out in hot water, or dipping the mould for an instant in warm, not boiling water. Have ready the whites whipped to a froth with three tablespoon- fuls powdered sugar and juice of a lemon. Heap neatly about the base of the moulded custard, like snow-drifts. If you like, you may dot this with minute bits of currant jelly. This is a pleasing dish to the eye and taste,

POULTRY. 81 pieces of duck, and warm up quickly, stirriug in at the last a teaspoonful of Worcestershire sauce and a table- spoonful of jelly. Serve in a hot chafing-dish. (For wild ducks, see Game.) Stewed Duck. This is a good way to treat an old tough fowl. Clean and divide, as you would a chicken for fricassee. Put in a saucepan, with several (minced) slices of cold ham or salt pork which is not too fat, and stew slowly for at least an hourâ€”keeping the lid on all the while. Then stir in a chopped onion, a half-spoonful of powdered sage, or of the green leaves cut fine, half as much parsley, a table- spoonful catsup, and black pepper. Stew, another half- hour, or until the duck is tender, and add a teaspoonlul brown sugar, and a tablespoonful of browned flour, pre- viously wet with cold water. Boil up once, and serve in a deep covered dish, with green peas as an accompaniment. Guinea Fowls. Many are not aware what an excellent article of food these speckled Arabs of the poultry yard are. They are kept chiefly for the beauty of their plumage, and their de- licious eggs, which are far richer than those of chickens. Unless young they are apt to be tough, and the dark color of the meat is objected to by those who are not fond of, or used to eating game. Cooked according to the fore- going receipt they are very savory, no matter how old they may be. Put them on early, and stew s'owly, and good management will bring the desired end to pass. There is nothing in the shape of game or poultry that is not ame- nable to this process, providing the salt be omitted until the meat is tender. 4*

CAKE. 307 Mould the mixture with your hands into small cones, and set these far enough apart not to touch one another upon buttered paper in a baking-pan. Bake in a very moderate oven. Beat whites and yolks separately; add to all the yolks and the whites of seven eggs the sugar, the rind of two lemons, and juice of one. Bake as for jelly-cake. To the whites of three eggs allow a pound and a quarter of powdered sugar ; beat stiff as for icing, take out enough to cover the top of the cake and set aside. Add to the rest the juice and half the grated rind of a large orange. When the cake is nearly cold, spread this between the layers. Beat into the icing reserved for the top a little lemon-juice, and, if needed, more sugar. It should be thicker than that spread between the cakes. You can make a very delightful variation of this elegant cake, by spreading the orange icing between layers made according to the receipt given for “ Martha’s Jelly-Cake ” several pages back, and frosting with lemon meringue, as above.

61 SHELL-PISH. Oyster Fritters. >P Drain the liquor from the oysters, and to a cupful of this add the same quantity of milk, three eggs, a little salt, and flour enough for a thin batter. Chop the oysters and stir into the batter. Have ready in the frying-pan a few spoonfuls of lard, or half lard, half butter ; heat very hot, and drop the oyster batter in by the tablespoonful. Try a spoonful first, to satisfy yourself that the lard is hot enough, and that the fritter is of the right size and consis- tency. Take rapidly from the pan as soon as they are done to a pleasing yellow brown, and send to table very hot. Some fry the oyster whole, enveloped in batter, one in each fritter. In this case, the batter should be thicker than if the chopped oysters were to be added. Scalloped Oysters. Crush and roll several handfuls of Boston or other fri- able crackers. Put a layer in the bottom of a buttered pudding-dish. Wet this with a mixture of the oyster liquor and milk, slightly warmed. Next, have a layer of oysters. Sprinkle with salt and pepper, and lay small bits of butter upon them. Then another layer of moistened crumbs, and so on until the dish is full. Let the top layer be of crumbs, thicker than the rest, and beat an egg into the milk you pour over them. Stick bits of butter thickly over it, cover the dish, set it in the oven, bake half an hour ; if the dish be large, remove the cover, and brown by setting it upon the upper grating of oven, or by holding a hot shovel over it. Broiled Oysters. >P Choose large, fat oysters; wipe them very dry ; sprinkle salt a; 1 cayenne pepper upon them, and broil upon one of th small gridirons sold for that purpose. You can

Vi INTRODUCTORY OF REVISED EDITION. I am grateful, also, to the courtesy of my publishers for the privilege of thanking those to whom this book was, and is dedicated “ My fellow-housekeepers—North, East, South and West”—for their substantial endorsement of the work I have done in their behalf. A collection of the private letters I have received from those who have used the “ General Receipts ” would make a volume very nearly as large as this. If I have, as the writers of these testimonials assure me—“ done them good,”—they have done me more in letting me know that I have not spent my strength for naught. I acknowledge with pleasure sundry pertinent suggestions and inquiries which have led me, in this revision, to examine warily the phraseolo- gy of some receipts and to modify these, I believe, for the bet- ter. But, by far, the best “ good ” done me through this work has been the conscious sisterhood into which I have come with the great body of American housewives. This is a benefit not to be rated by dollars and cents, or measured by time. I hope my fellow-workers will find their old kitchen-companion, in fresh dress, yet more serviceable than before, and that their daughters may, at the close of a second decade, demand new stereotype plates for still another, and, like this, a progressive edition. October 1, 1880. Marion Harland.

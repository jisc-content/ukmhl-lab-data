21 VEGETABLE SOUPS. Tomato (Summer soup). >J< 2! lbs. veal, or lamb. 1 gallon water. 2 qts. fresh tomatoes, peeled and cut up fine. 1 tablespoonful butter. 1 teaspoonful white sugar. Pepper and salt. Chopped parsley. Boil the meat to shreds and the water down to two quarts. Strain the liquor, put in the tomatoes, stirring them very hard that they may dissolve thoroughly; boil half an hour. Season with parsley or any other green herb you may prefer, pepper, and salt. Strain again, and stir in a tablespoonful of butter, with a teaspoonful of white sugar, before pouring into the tureen. This soup is more palatable still if made with the broth in which chickens were boiled for yesterday’s dinner. Turnip. Knuckle of veal, well cracked. 5 qts. water. Cover closely and stew gently for four hours, the day before the soup is wanted. On the morrow, skim off’ the fat and warm the stock gradually to a boil. Have ready an onion and six large winter or a dozen small summer turnips, sweet marjoram or thyme minced very finely. Put these into the soup and let them simmer together for an hour. Strain : return to the fire and add a cup of milk—in which has been stirred a tablespoonful of rice- flour or other thickening—and a tablespoonful of butter. Season with salt and pepper, let it boil up once, stirring all the time, as is necessary in all soup3 where milk is added at last, and remove instantly, or it will scorch.

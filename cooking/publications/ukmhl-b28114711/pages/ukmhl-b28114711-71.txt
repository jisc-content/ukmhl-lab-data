V FISH. // Cat-fish Chowder. 55 Skin, clean, and cut off the heads. Cut the fish into pieces two inches long, and put into a pot with some l’at pork cut into shreds—a pound to a dozen medium-sized fish, two chopped onions, or half a dozen shallots, a bunch of sweet herbs, and pepper. The pork will salt it suffi- ciently. Stew slowly for three-quarters of an hour. Then stir in a cup of milk, thickened with a tablespoonful of flour ; take up a cupful of the hot liquor, and stir, a little at a time, into two well-beaten eggs. Return this to the pot, throw in half a dozen Boston or butter crackers, split in half; let all boil up once, and turn into a tureen. Pass sliced lemon or cucumber pickles, also sliced, with it. Take out the backbones of the fish before serving. Stewed Eels. >J< Inquire, before buying, where they were caught, and give so decided a preference to country cels as to refuse those fattened upon the offal of city wharves. Nor are the largest cels the best for eating. One weighing a pound is better for your purpose than a bulky fellow that weighs three. Skin and clean, carefully extracting all the fat from the inside. Cut into lengths of an inch and a half; put into a saucepan, with enough cold water to cover them ; throw in a little salt and chopped parsley, and stew slowly, closely covered, for at least an hour. Add, at the last, a great spoonful of butter, and a little flour wet with cold water, also pepper. Serve in a deep dish. The appear- ance and odor of this stew are so pleasing as often to over- come the prejudices of those who “Wouldn’t touch an eel for the world! They look like snakes !” And those who have tasted them rarely enter a second demurrer.

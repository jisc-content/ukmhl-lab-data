FRUIT JELLIES. 459 of sugar for every quart of pears, and stew all together ten minutes; take out the pears, lay in a covered bowl to keep warm; add to the syrup a little ginger or a few cloves, boil fifteen minutes longer, and pour over the fruit hot. Or, If the pears are not quite ripe, but hard and disposed to be tough, peel them, cut out the blossom-end, leaving on the stems, and stew until tender in enough water to cover them. Take them out, set by in a covered dish to keep warm; add to the liquor in the saucepan an equal quan- tity of the best molasses and a little ginger; boil half an hour, skim, and return the pears to the saucepan. Stew all together twenty minutes, and pour out. These are very good, and will keep a week or more, even in warm weather. I have canned them while boil- ing hot, and kept them sweet a whole year. Baked Quinces. Pare and quarter; extract the seeds and stew the fruit in clear water until a straw will pierce them ; put into a baking-dish with a half cupful of sugar to every eight quinces; pour over them the liquor in which they were boiled; cover closely, and steam in the oven one hour; take out the quinces, lay them in a covered bowl to keep warm ; return the syrup to the saucepan, and boil twenty minutes; pour over the quinces, and set away covered, to cool. Eat cold. FRUIT JELLIES. Currant, Blackberry, Strawberry, etc. >P Put the fruit into a stone jar; set this in a kettle of tepid water, and put it upon the fire. Let it boil, closely

BREAD. 261 and prevents “ sweating.” A tin bread-box is best, with a cloth at bottom and enwrapping the loaves. Yeast (Hop.) >J< 4 large potatoes, or six small. 2 quarts cold water. Double handful hops, tied in a coarse muslin bag. 4 tablespoonfuls Hour. 2 white sugar. Peel the potatoes, and put them with the hop-bag into a saucepan containing two quarts cold water. Cover and boil until the potatoes break and fall apart. Take these out with a perforated skimmer, leaving the water still boiling, mash them fine with a potato-beetle, and work in the flour and sugar. Moisten this gradually with the boiling hop tea, stirring it to a smooth paste. When all the tea has been mixed in, set it aside to cool. While still slightly warm, add four tablespoonfuls of lively yeast, and turn all into a large open vessel to “ work.” Keep this in a warm place until it ceases to bubble up, or until next day. In summer it will work well in a few hours. When quite light, put in earthen jars with small mouths, in which fit corks, or bottle it, and remove to ice-house or cellar. It will keep good for a fortnight—• longer in winter. When you wish to use it for baking, send a small ves- sel to the cellar for the desired quantity, and re-cork at once. A half-hour in a hot kitchen may spoil it. Yeast (Self-working). 8 potatoes. 2 ounces hops.

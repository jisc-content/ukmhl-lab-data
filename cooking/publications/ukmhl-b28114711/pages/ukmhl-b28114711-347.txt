GINGERBREAD. 331 About five cups of flour—enough to make it thick as cup cake batter, perhaps a trifle thicker. Work in four cups first, and add very cautiously. Stir butter, sugar, molasses, and spice together to a light cream, set them on the range until slightly warm ; beat the eggs light; add the milk to the warmed mixture, then the eggs, the soda, and lastly the flour. Beat very hard ten minutes, and bake at once in a loaf, or in small tins. Haifa pound raisins, seeded and cut in half, will improve this excellent gingerbread. Dredge them well before putting them in. Add them at the last. Sponge Gingerbread (eyy/ess.) >B 5 cups flour. 1 heaping tablespoQnful butter. 1 cup molasses. 1 “ sugar. 1 “ milk (sour is best). 2 teaspoonfuls saleratus, not soda, dissolved in hot water. 2 teaspoonfuls ginger. 1 “ cinnamon. Mix the molasses, sugar, butter, and spice together; warm them slightly, and beat until they are lighter in color by many degrees than when you began. Add the milk, then the soda, and having mixed all well, put in the flour. Beat very hard five minutes, and bake in a broad, shallow pan, or in pate-tins. Half a pound of seeded raisins cut in pieces will be a pleasant addition. Try this gingerbread warm for tea or luncheon, with a cup of hot chocolate to accompany it, and you will soon repeat the experiment.

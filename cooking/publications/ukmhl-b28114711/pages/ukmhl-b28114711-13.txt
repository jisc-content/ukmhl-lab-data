v INTRODUCTORY OF REVISED EDITION. It is not yet quite ten years since the publication of “ Com- von Sense in the Household. General Receipts.” In offering the work to the publishers, under whose able manage- ment it has prospered so wonderfully, I said: “ I have written this because I felt that such a Manual of Practical Housewifery is needed.” That I judged aright, taking my own experience as a housekeeper as the criterion of the wants and perplexities of others, is abundantly proved by the circumstance which calls for this new and revised edition of the book. Through much and constant use—nearly 100,000 copies having been printed from them—the stereotype plates have become so worn that the impressions are faint and sometimes illegible I gladly avail myself of the opportunity thus offered to re-read and so far to alter the original volume as may, in the light of later improvements in the culinary art and in my understanding of it, make the collection of family receipts more intelligible and available. Nor have I been able to resist the temptation to interpolate a few excellent receipts that have come into my hands at a later period than that of the publication of the last, and in my estimation, perhaps the most valuable of the “Com- mon Sense Series,” viz.: “The Dinner Year-Book.”

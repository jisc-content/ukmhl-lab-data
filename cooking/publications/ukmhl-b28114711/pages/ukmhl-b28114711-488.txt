472 COMMON SENSE. Pepper Mangoes. >p A.re put up in the same way, using green peppers that are full grown, but not tinged with red. They are very good, but your fingers will smart after thrusting them into the peppers to pullout the seeds. For this purpose I have used, first, a small penkuife, to cut the core from its attachment to the stem-end of the pepper, then a smooth bit of stick, to pry open the slit in the side and work out the loose core or bunch of seed.

Should your fingers burn bad- ly, anoint them with sweet-oil and wear gloves that night Cream will also allay the smart. 2 1 4 3 1 2 1 1 2 1 1 4 2 3 Pickled Cabbage {Yellow.) gallons vinegar, pint white mustard seed, oz. ginger, oz. pepper-corns, oz. allspice, oz. cloves, oz. mace, oz. nutmeg, oz. turmeric. large handful of garlic, chopped, handful scraped horseradish, lbs. sugar, oz. celery seed, lemons, sliced thin. pounded fine.

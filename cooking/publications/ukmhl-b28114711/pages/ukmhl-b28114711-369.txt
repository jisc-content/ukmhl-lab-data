Boil the milk, take it from the fire, and whip in grad- ually the beaten eggs. When nearly cold, season; add the cocoa-nut, and pour into paste-shells. Do not boil the egg and milk together. Bake twenty minutes. Some put the custard quite raw into the pie-dishes, but the cocoa-nut is apt, in that case, to settle at the bottom. You may, however, pour the raw mixture into cups, and bake by setting in a pan of boiling water, stirring well once, as they begin to warm. This is cocoa-nut cup- custard, and is much liked.

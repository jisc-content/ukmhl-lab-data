257 BREAD. fortable homes, good bread is an unknown phenomenon. I say phenomenon, because it would indeed bo a marvellous estrangement of cause and effect were indifferent flour, unskillfully mixed with flat yeast, badly risen and negli- gently baked, to result in that pride of the notable house- keeper—light, sweet, wholesome bread. I know a house- hold where sour, stiff bread is the rule, varied several times during the week by muffins scented and colored with soda, clammy biscuit, and leathery griddle-cakes ; another where the bread is invariably over-risen, and consequently tasteless, sometimes slightly acid; yet another in which home-made bread is not used at all because it is “ so troublesome and uncertain,” the mistress preferring to feed her family, growing children and all, upon the vari-eolored sponges bought at the bakers— sponges inflated with sal volatile, flavorless, and dry as chips when a day old, and too often betraying, in the dark streaks running through the interior of the loaf, want of cleanliness in the kneader. Yet these are all well-to-do people, who submit to these abominations partly because they do not know how badly off" they are—chiefly because it is their way of doing, and they see no reason for changing. “ I have been a housekeeper for thirty years, and have always mixed my bread just so,” retorted a mistress once, when I mildly set forth the advantages of “setting a sponge” over-night. “I put in flour, yeast, and milk if I have it, and give them a good stir ; then set the dough down to rise. Our folks don’t fancy very light bread. There don’t seem to be any substance in it —so to speak. Mine generally turns out pretty nice. It’s all luck, after all, about bread.” “ I’m told you have a receipt for making bread,” laughed another to me; “I never heard of such a thing in my life, and I’ve been keeping house eighteen years.

PANCAKES. 407' get itâ€”in boiling lard to a fine brown. Dip each slice quickly in boiling water to remove the grease. Sprinkle with powdered sugar and pile upon a hot plate.

Jelly-Cake Fritters (very nice). Some stale sponge, or plain cup cake, cut into rounds with a cake-cutter. Hot lard. Strawberry or other jam, or jelly. A. little boiling milk. Cut the cake carefully and fry a nice brown. Dip each slice for a second in a bowl of boiling milk, draining this off on the side of the vessel; lay on a hot dish and spread thickly with strawberry jam, peach jelly, or other delicate conserve.

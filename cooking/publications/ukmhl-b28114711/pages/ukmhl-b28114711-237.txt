GREEN CORN. 223 test with the nail. When the grain is pierce, should escape in a jet, and not be thick. Clean ... ping oft’ the outer leaves, turn back the innermost cov ^ ing carefully, pick off every thread of silk, and recover the ear with the thin husk that grew nearest it. Tic at the top with a bit of thread, put into boiling water salted, and cook fast from twenty minutes to half an hour, in proportion to size and age. Cut off the stalks close to the cob, and send whole to table wTrapped in a napkin. Or, you can cut from the cob while hot, and season with butter, pepper and salt. Send to table in a vege- table dish. Corn and Tomatoes. Take equal quantities of green corn cut from the cob, and tomatoes sliced and peeled. Stew together half an hour; season with pepper, salt, and a very little sugar. Stew fifteen minutes longer, and stir in a great lump of butter. Five minutes later, pour out and serve. Succotash. This is made of green corn and Lima beans, although you can substitute for the latter string or butter beans. Have a third more corn than beans, when the former has been cut from the cob and the beans shelled. Put into boiling water enough to cover them—no more—and stew gently together until tender—perhaps half an hour—stir- ring now and then. Pour off nearly all the water, and add a large cupful of milk. Stew in this, watching to prevent burning, for an hour ; then stir in a great lump of butter, a teaspoonful of flour wet with cold milk, pep- per and salt to taste. Boil up once, and pour into a deep vegetable dish. If you use string-beans, string and cut up into half-inch lengths before cooking.

COMMON SENSE. 108 dish while you add to the dripping half a cup hot water, some chopped parsley, a teaspoonful browned flour, and the juice of half a lemon. Pour over the sweet-breads be- fore sending to table. Jellied Veal. Wash a knuckle of veal, and cut it into three pieces. Boil it slowly until the meat will slip easily from the bones; take out of the liquor; remove all the bones, and chop the meat fine. Season with salt, pepper, two shallots chopped as fine as possible, mace and thyme, or, if you like, sage. Put back into the liquor, and boil until it is almost dry and can be stirred with difficulty. Turn into a mould until next day. Set on the table cold, garnish with parsley, and cut in slices. The juice of a lemon, stirred in just before it is taken from the fire, is an im- provement. Calf’s-IIead in a Mould. Boil a calfs-head until tender, the day before you wish to use it. When perfectly cold, chop—not too small— and season to taste with pepper, salt, mace, and the juice of a lemon. Prepare half as much cold ham, fat and lean—also minced—as you have of the chopped calf’s- liead. Butter a mould well, and lay in the bottom a layer of the calfs-head, then one of ham, and so on until the shape is full, pressing each layer hard, when you have moistened it with veal gravy or the liquor in which the head was boiled. Pour more gravy over the top, and when it has soaked in well, cover with a paste made of flour and water. Bake one hour. Remove the paste when it i3 quite cold, and turn out carefully. Cut per- pendicularly. This is quite as good a relish when made of cold roast or stewed veal and ham. It will keep several days in cool weather.

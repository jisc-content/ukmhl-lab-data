250 COMMON SENSE. Stew the apples, when you have pared and cored them, as for apple-sauce. Beat them very smooth while hot, adding the butter, sugar, and nutmeg. When perfectly cold, put with the eggs, which should be whipped light, yolks and whites separately. Put in the yolks first, then the rosewater, lastly the whites, and pour into a deep bake-dish, which has been warmed and buttered. Bake in a moderate oven until it is delicately browned.

Currant or other tart jelly 5 eggs. 4 tablespoonfuIs cream, or the same of milk, thick- ened with a teaspoonful of rice-flour or arrow-root. 2 tablespoonfuls powdered sugar. 1 teaspoonful bitter almond or vanilla flavoring. Beat whites and yolks separately, adding to the latter the sugar and milk after they are thick and smooth. Next, chop in the seasoning; lastly, stir in the whites with a few swift strokes. Put a large spoonful of butter in the frying-pan, and, when it is hot, pour in the omelette. Spread upon it when done, which will be in a very few minutes, some nice jelly. Take the pan from the fire to do this, spread quickly, slip your knife or tin spatula un- der one-half of the omelette, and double it over. Turn over on a hot platter, sift powdered sugar upon it, and eat at once.

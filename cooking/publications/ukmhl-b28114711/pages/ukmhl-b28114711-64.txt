COMMON SENSE. 48 table, cut into smooth strips as long as the middle finger, and rather wider; arranged neatly upou a garnished dish, and eaten with pepper-sauce or some other pungent condi- ment. Boiled Shad. (Fresh.) >J< Clean, wash, and wipe the fish. A roe shad is best for this purpose. Cleanse the roes thoroughly, and having sprinkled both shad and eggs with salt, wrap in separate cloths and put into a fish-kettle, side by side. Cover with salted water, and boil from half an hour to three-quarters, in proportion to the size. Experience is the best rule as to the time. When you have once cooked fish to a turn, note the weight and time, and you will be at no loss there- after. A good rule is to make a pencilled memorandum in the margin of the receipt-book opposite certain receipts. Serve the shad upon a hot dish, with a boat of drawn butter mingled with chopped eggs and parsley, or egg-sauce. Lay the roes about the body of the fish. Garnish with capers and slices of hard boiled eggs. Boiled Shad. (Salt.) Soak the fish six or seven hours in wrarm water, chang- ing it several times; wipe off all the salt and immerse in ice-cold water. When it has lain in this an hour, put into a fish-kettle with enough fresh water to cover it, and boil from fifteen to twenty minutes, in proportion to the size. Serve in a hot dish, with a large lump of butter spread over the fish. Broiled Shad. (Fresh.) >B Wash, wipe, and split the fish. Sprinkle with salt and pepper, and lay it upon a buttered gridiron, inside down- ward. When the lower side is browned, turn the fish. One of medium size will be done in about twenty minutes.

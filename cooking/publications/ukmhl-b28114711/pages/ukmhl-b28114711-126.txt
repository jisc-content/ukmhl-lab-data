COMMON SENSE. 110 ready put this iu a little at a time. Let it almost boil, when add two tablespoonfuls of cream, or three of milk, stirring all the while. Lastly, squeeze in the juice of a lemon, and a moment later half a glass of Sherry or Ma- deira wine. The mince-meat should be dry enough to heap into a shape in a flat dish or chafing-dish. Lay triangles of but- tered toast about the base of the mound, and on the top a poached egg. The remains of cold roast beef treated in this manner, substituting for the toast balls of mashed potato, will make a neat and palatable dish. Send around spinach or stewed tomatoes with minced veal; scraped horseradish steeped in vinegar with the beef. Veal Cutlets a la Maintenon. The cutlets should be nearly three-quarters of an inch thick, and trim in shape. Dip each in beaten egg, then into pounded cracker which has been seasoned with pow- dered sweet herbs, pepper, and salt. Wrap each cutlet in a half-sheet of note or letter paper, well buttered; lay them upon a buttered gridiron and broil over a clear fire, turn- ing often and dexterously. You can secure the papers by fringing the ends, and twisting these after the cutlets arc put in. This is neater than to pin them together. In trying this dish for the first time, have ready a sufficient number of duplicate papers in a clean, hot dish. If your enve- lopes are much soiled or darkened while the cutlets are broiling, transfer quickly when done to the clean warm ones, twist the ends, and serve. Cutlets prepared in this manner are sent to table in their cloaks, ranged symmet- rically upon a hot chafing-dish. The expedient of the clean papers is a “ trick of the trade,” amateur housewives will observe with satisfaction.

346 COMMON SENSE. Apple Custard Pie. >p 3 cups stewed apple. Nearly a cup white sugar. 6 eggs. 1 quart milk. Make the stewed apple very sweet, and let it cool. Beat the eggs light, and mix the yolks well with the apple, sea- soning with nutmeg only. Then stir in gradually the milk, heating as you go on; lastly add the whites; fill your crust and bake without cover. Apple Meringue Pies. >p Stew and sweeten ripe, juicy apples, when you have pared and sliced them. Mash smooth, and season with nutmeg. If you like the flavor, stew some lemon-peel with the apple, and remove when cold. Fill your crust, and bake until just done. Spread over the apple a thick meringue, made by whipping to a stiff' froth the whites of three eggs for each pie, sweetening with a tablespoonful of powdered sugar for each egg. Flavor this with rose-water or vanilla; beat until it will stand alone, and cover the pie three-quarters of an inch thick. Set back in the oven until the meringue is well “set.” Should it color too darkly, sift powdered sugar over it when cold. Eat cold. They are very fine. Peach pies are even more delicious, made in this man- ner. Pippin Pies. 12 fine ripe pippins, pared and grated. 1 lb. white sugar 4 lb butter 6 eggs—whites and yolks separately beaten. 1 lemon—grated peel and juice, with nutmeg.

COMMON SENSE. 482 and the directions sold with these are so minute, that I need give only a few general rules here. Allow rather more coffee to a given quantity of water than if it were to be boiled, and have it ground very fine. Put the coffee in the uppermost compartment, pour on the water very slowly until the fine coffee is saturated, then more rapidly. The water should be boiling. Shut down the top, and the cof- fee ought to be ready when it has gone through the double or treble set of strainers. Should it not be strong enough, run it through again. Cafe au Lait. 1 pint very strong made coffee—fresh and hot. 1 “ boiling milk. The coffee should be poured off the grounds through a fine strainer (thin muslin is the best material) into tb9 table coffee-pot. Add the milk, and set the pot where if will keep hot for five minutes before pouring it out. Tea. 2 teaspoonfuls of tea to one large cupful of boiling water. Scald the teapot well, put in the tea, and, covering close, set it on the stove or range one minute to warm; pour on enough boiling water to cover it well, and let it stand ten minutes to “draw.” Keep the lid of the pot shut, and set in a warm place, but do not let it boil. Fill up with as much boiling water as you will need, and send hot to the table, after pouring into a heated china or silver pot. The bane of tea in many households is unboiled water. It can never extract the flavor as it should, although it steep for hours. The kettle should not only steam, but bubble and puff in a hard boil before you add water from it to the tea-leaves.

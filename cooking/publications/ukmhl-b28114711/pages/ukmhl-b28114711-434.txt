COMMON SENSE. 418 Soak the gelatine in just enough cold water to cover it, for an hour. Drain, and stir into a pint of the cream made boiling hot. Beat the yolks smooth with the sugar, and add the boiling mixture, beaten in a little at a time. Heat until it begins to thicken, but do not actually boil; remove it from the fire, flavor, and while it is still hot stir in the other pint of cream, whipped or churned in a sylla- bub churn to a stiff froth. Beat in this “whip,” a spoon- ful at a time, into the custard until it is the consistency of sponge-cake batter. Dip a mould in cold water, pour in the mixture, and set on the ice to form. Snow Custard. >B 4 package Coxe’s gelatine. 3 eggs. 1 pint milk. 2 cups of sugar. Juice of one lemon. Soak the gelatine one hour in a teacupful of cold water. To this, at the end of this time, add one pint boiling water. Stir until the gelatine is thoroughly dissolved; add two- thirds of the sugar and the lemou-juice. Beat the whites of the eggs to a stiff froth, and when the gelatine is quite cold, whip it into the whites, a spoonful at a time, for an hour. Whip steadily and evenly, and when all is stiff, pour into a mould, previously wet with cold water, and set in a cold place. In foqr or five hours turn into a glass dish. Make a custard of the milk, eggs, and remainder of the sugar, flavor with vanilla or bitter almond, and when the meringue is turned out of the mould, pour this around the base.

M. L. A. PEEFACE. —*— lEmboldened by the kindly reception given by the dblic to “Breakfast Dishes,” and the flattering iT'tice of the press, I have ventured to bring out SSavouries and Sweets,” trusting that it will be as vvourably received as its predecessor. The Jlrst iH of the book will be found to contain a large L’jnber of receipts for those piquant little dishes aat are now so universally served at dinners be- ■^een “the sweets” and “the dessert,” including ggreat many savoury omelettes and fondus. IThe second pa/rt consists of a varied collection of rceipts, both old and new, for puddings, tarts, fritters, iincakes, jeilies, custards, creams, souffles, syllabubs, nnkets, and sweet omelettes, which I can confldently [•■3ommend as delicious and easy of preparation. II must here express my indebtedness to E. J, B. rp her practical help, which has been of the greatest rrvice to me in the compilation of this little book.

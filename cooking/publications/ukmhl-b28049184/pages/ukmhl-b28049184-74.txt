^ STUFFED AND BAKED PLAICE 74 Method— Wash and clean the fish thoroughly, scraping the skin well from the tail towards the head. Cut off the head and fins, and dry in a cloth. Cut the plaice right through the bone, into three or four pieces, and place these in a stewpan. Pour the milk and water over them, put the lid on the pan, and stew slowly until cooked, about a quarter of an hour. Lift the pieces carefully out on to a hot dish, arranging them in the form of the fish again, and keep hot over a pan of boiling water. Add the bread crumbs and butter to the liquid in the stewpan, and stir over the fire until this boils, and the bread crumbs thicken the sauce. Add parsley, pepper, and salt at the last, and pour over the fish. Garnish with some small sprigs of parsley, and serve hot. 74.—STUFFED AND BAKED PLAICE. (Fr. Plie Farcie au Four.)

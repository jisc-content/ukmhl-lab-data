COD’S ROE 6 out First wash the fish well, see that it is quite clean and free from blood near the bone, and do not let it lie too long in the water. Then dry it, and it is ready for stuffing. To make the stuffing, put the white bread crumbs into a basin with the chopped parsley, a little grated lemon rind, pepper, and salt. Add the suet finely chopped or the melted butter, mix well together, and add enough milk or beaten egg to bind. Do not make it too wet. Put the dripping into a Yorkshire pudding tin, melt it in the oven or over the fire, and place the fish on this. Put the stuffing in near the bone, doubling the flaps round it, and fixing them with a skewer; or if it is a piece of the tail-end of cod, remove the bone and fill up the hole with the stuffing. Brush the fish over with some of the melted dripping, and sprinkle the browned bread crumbs over the top. Place in a moderate oven, and bake from half to three-quarters of an hour. Baste every ten minutes with the dripping to prevent the fish becoming dry. When ready, lift the fish with a fish slice on to a hot dish, and serve with parsley or anchovy sauce round it (see Sauces). Or it may be served on a fish napkin or dish paper without any sauce. Garnish the fish with some nice sprigs of parsley. 6.—COD’S ROE (TO BOIL). (Fr. Laitances Bouillies.) Required— Cod’s Roe. Salt. Boiling Water. Vinegar. White or Parsley Sauce.

136 ^ FISH STOCK 136.—FISH STOCK. Ingredients— 2 lbs. of White Fish or Fish Bones and Trim- mings. 2 quarts Cold Water. 1 small Carrot. 1 small Turnip. 1 Onion. 1 stick of Celery or ^ tea- spoonful Celery Seed. 1 dessert-spoonful Salt. teaspoonful Mixed Herbs or a sprig of Thyme, Marjoram, and Basil. A few Parsley Stalks. 1 dozen Peppercorns. 3 Cloves. 1 blade of Mace. 1 Bay Leaf. Method— Any white fish or trimmings of white fish, such as haddocks, cod, halibut, plaice, flounder, ling, &c., may be used for fish stock. Fish such as mackerel, herring, and salmon are of too oily a nature, and too strong in flavour. By fish trimmings is meant the bones, heads, fins, and skins of fish. If a light- coloured stock is wanted, avoid using too much dark- coloured skin. Wash the fish or trimmings thoroughly in cold water, and cut them into small pieces. Put them into a fish kettle or large goblet with the water and salt. Put the lid on the pan, and bring to the boil; then skim well, and simmer about fifteen minutes before adding the vegetables. As more scum rises, remove it, or the stock will be cloudy in appearance. Prepare the vegetables, cut them rather small, and add them to the stock -with the herbs, celery seed, pepper- corns, &c., tied in a small piece of muslin. Simmer slowly from three to four hours, then strain into a basin.

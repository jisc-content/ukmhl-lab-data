75 -«o4 PLAICE WITH TOMATOES melted, and enough milk to bind all together. Do not make the mixture too damp. If liked, a small quantity of powdered herbs or finely chopped onion may be added, and sometimes oatmeal is used instead of bread crumbs. Make a slit down the centre of the fish on the black skin side, right down to the bone. Slip the knife in close to the bone, and raise up the flesh on both sides, making pockets so to speak. Put the stuffing into this, and pile it rather high in the centre. Melt the dripping in a Yorkshire pudding tin, and lay the fish on to it. Brush over with a little of the melted dripping, and sprinkle with the browned bread crumbs. Bake in a moderate oven for about half an hour, basting occasionally with the dripping. It will be ready when the skin begins to crack. Lift with a fish slice on to a hot dish, and pour brown, tomato, or anchovy sauce round (see Recipes for Sauces). Garnish with parsley, and serve hot. 75.—PLAICE WITH TOMATOES. (Fr. Plie aux Tomates.) Ingredients— i Plaice. 3 or 4 fresh Tomatoes. | Spanish Onion.

io6 ^ WHITING Method- Small whiting are generally fried whole. Skin and clean them thoroughly, but do not cut off the heads. Put a little flour (one teaspoonful for each whiting) on to a plate, and mix with it some pepper and salt. Dip each fish into this, and coat them lightly. This dries the fish, and makes it fry a better colour. Then egg and bread crumb them {see No. 131), and press the crumbs well on with a knife. Fasten the tail through the eye, and fry them to a nice brown colour in hot fat (iw French Frying, page vii.). Drain on kitchen paper, serve on a hot dish with a d’oyley or dish paper under them, and garnish with parsley. Maitre d’hotel butter (Recipe 135) made into small pats may be served separately. Method— Skin the fish, and cut it into neat sized pieces, or fillet it and roll the fillets up. Grease a soup plate or muffin dish, and place the pieces of fish on this. Sprinkle with salt and white pepper, and squeeze over some lemon juice, which helps to keep the fish white and firm. Cover with a piece of greased paper, and then with a lid or basin. Place this over a pan h3.1f full of boiling water, and see that the plate fits 106.—WHITING (TO STEAM). Required— Whiting. Lemon Juice. Pepper and Salt. A littte Butter. Parsley to garnish.

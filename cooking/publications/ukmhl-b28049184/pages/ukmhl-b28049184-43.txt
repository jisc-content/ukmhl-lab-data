30 -*>5 FISH SOUFFLE the quenelle neatly out, and place it in a greased frying or saute' pan. Shape all the mixture in the same way, and keep the quenelles a little distance apart in the pan. Wet the spoons and knife each time before using, and try to make the quenelles all one size and shape. Pour round them very gently enough boiling water to fully half cover them. Place over them a piece of greased paper, cut to the size and shape of the pan, and poach them on a slow fire from ten to fifteen minutes. The water must only be allowed to simmer very gently. When ready, quenelles should be firm to the touch, and should have lost their raw appearance. Lift them out with a draining spoon on to a hair sieve or clean cloth, and drain for a few seconds. Dish the quenelles in a circle, one leaning against the other on a hot dish. (They may, if liked, be raised on a round of toast, or some cooked spinach.) Coat them nicely with white sauce (see Recipe 130), and garnish with a light sprinkling of very finely chopped parsley, lobster coral, or sieved yolk of egg. A little of each may be used, but avoid too much ornamen- tation. 3a—FISH SOUFFLE. (Fr. Souffle de Poisson.) Ingredients— 6 oz. uncooked White Fish. 1 oz. Butter. 1 oz.

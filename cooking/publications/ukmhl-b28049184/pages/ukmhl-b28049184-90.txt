102 WHITEBAIT fish well washed, cleaned, and cut into small neat pieces. Put it into the saucepan, put the lid on the pan, and simmer gently until the fish is cooked, about three-quarters of an hour, but this varies according to the kind of fish used. Lift out on to a hot dish, add the chopped parsley to the liquor in the pan, and pour it over the fish. Serve hot in a deep dish. 102.-WHITEBAIT (TO FRY). (Fr. Blanchailles Frites.) Required- Whitebait. | Flour. Method— These fish must be perfectly fresh, and should be carefully looked over and put into water with a lump of ice in it, and kept there until required. Have ready on the fire a saucepan of boiling fat or oil (see French Frying, page vii.). Put two or three tablespoon- fuls of flour on the centre of a clean cloth, drain some of the whitebait free from water in a colander, and then shake them lightly in the flour. Empty the bait without delay into a frying basket, and shake well to let the loose flour drop out. Plunge it into the hot fat, and fry till brown and crisp. Drain and serve on a hot dish with a fish d’oyley under them. Pile them high, and garnish with cut lemon and parsley. Thin brown bread and butter should be handed separately. Success in frying whitebait depends on little and light handling, quick flouring, and hot fat. When properly done, the whitebait should be crisp, and each fish distinct and separate.

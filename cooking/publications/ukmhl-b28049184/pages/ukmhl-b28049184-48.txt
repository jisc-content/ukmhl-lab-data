Prepare the stuffing in the same way as for last recipe, lay a little on each fillet, and roll them up, commencing at the thick end, and rolling towards the tail. Stand them up on a greased tin, cover with a piece of greased paper, and bake in a moderate oven about fifteen minutes, or until the fish has lost its clear appearance, and looks quite white. When ready, roll the pieces in some fine browned bread-crumbs, coating them well. Place them on a hot ashet, pour some anchovy or parsley sauce round (see Recipe for Sauces), and put a small pat of maitre d’hotel butter (see Recipe 135) on the top of each. Method— Haddocks when small may be fried whole. Wash and clean the fish, then skin and dry them thoroughly. Coat the fish lightly with flour, then egg and bread crumb them (see Recipe 131). Lay them on to a plate or tin with some kitchen paper under them ready for frying. Melt about two tablespoonfuls of clarified fat or dripping in a frying pan, and let it become smoking hot. Fry the fish slowly in this, first on one side and 37.—HADDOCKS (TO FRY). (Fr. Eglefins Frits). Required— Haddocks. A little Flour. Pepper and Salt. Egg and Bread Crumbs. Frying Fat.

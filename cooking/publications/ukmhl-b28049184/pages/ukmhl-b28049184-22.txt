STUFFED AND BAKED COD 5 A thick middle cut or the head and shoulders are the best parts of cod for boiling. The tail-end is too insipid, and is better cut in slices and fried. Wash and cleanse the fish thoroughly, and if time permits, rub it well with salt, and let it lie an hour or two before cooking, as this very much improves the flavour of it. Cook according to directions given for Boiling Fish (page vi.). Dish on a hot folded serviette, with a fish drainer under it, and garnish with cut lemon and parsley or scraped horse-radish. Oyster, parsley, shrimp, anchovy, lobster, or egg sauce should be served with it or plain melted butter (see Recipes for Sauces). A small piece is often served with a thick white sauce poured over u, and garnished ■with the yolk of a hard-boiled egg rubbed through a sieve, a little chopped parsley or lobster coral. 5.—STUFFED AND BAKED COD.

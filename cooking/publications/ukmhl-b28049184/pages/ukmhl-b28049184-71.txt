-05 PERCH 69 Method— Put the oysters into a saucepan with their liquor, bring to the boil and strain. Then remove the gristle, and break them into small pieces with a fork. Scrape the flesh from the whiting, free it from all skin and bone, and pound well in a mortar. Melt the butter in a small pan, add the oyster liquor and bread crumbs, and stir over the fire until the mixture thickens. Add this panada to the whiting in the mortar, pound again for a few minutes, and then rub through a fine wire sieve (see No. 134). Put the sieved mixture into a basin, and add the oysters, yolks of eggs, seasoning, and cream. Mix well. Beat up the whites of eggs to a stiff froth on a plate, and stir them lightly into the mixture with an iron spoon. Pour into small greased souffld cases, china or paper, and bake in a moderate oven for about fifteen minutes, until well risen and firm to the touch. When ready, garnish with sprigs of parsley, and serve quickly. 69.—PERCH (TO STEW WITH WINE). (Fr. Perche au Vin Blanc.) Ingredients— 3 or 4 Perch. White Stock and Sherry. 2 Bay Leaves.

16 STEWED EELS into this, coating them lightly, and shaking off any loose flour. Then egg and bread crumb the fish (see Recipe 131), and fry in boiling fat (see French Frying, page vii.), until a nice brown colour. Drain on kitchen paper, and serve on a hot dish with a d’oyley or dish paper on it. Garnish with parsley, and if liked Tartare or caper sauce may be handed separately. 16.—STEWED EELS. (Fr. Anguilles au Jus.) Ingredients— 1 lb. Eels. £ pint Brown Stock. £ oz. Butter. Pepper and Salt. J oz. Flour. 1 tablespoonful Cream. 1 tablespoonful Ketchup. Method- Wash the eels well, and cut them into pieces about two inches long. Let them lie in strong salt and water for one hour or more. Put the heads, tails, and any trimmings from the eels into a saucepan with the stock, simmer for half an hour, then strain and use this stock for making the sauce. Melt the butter in a saucepan, and let it brown slightly; then add the flour, and mix together until quite smooth. Pour in the strained stock, add the ketchup, and stir until boiling. Lift the pieces of eel out of the salted water, rinse them in fresh cold water, and put them into the saucepan with the sauce. Stew gently for half an hour, or until the eels are cooked; add the cream just before serving, and season to taste. Serve on a hot dish, and garnish with sippets of toast.

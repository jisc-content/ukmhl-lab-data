50 HERRING Method— Wash and scrape the herring, cutting off the fins and the head. Split them open, and remove the bones. Put some oatmeal, pepper, and salt on to a plate, mix them well together, and dip each fish into this. Melt about two ounces of dripping or clarified fat in a frying pan. When it is smoking hot, put in the fish, the open side downwards. Brown on the one side, then turn with a fish slice and brown on the other. When ready, lift out and drain on kitchen paper. Serve on a hot dish with a fish d’oyley or dish paper on it, and garnish with sprigs of parsley. If the herring are small, they may be fried in deep fat {see French Frying, page vii.). 50.—HERRING (TO FRY)-II. (Ft•. Harengs Frits.) Required— Herring. I 2 oz.

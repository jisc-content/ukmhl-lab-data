Always when sieving have two spoons in readiness, one to rub the mixture through with, and the other for scraping the sieve underneath. Stand the sieve with the narrower rim uppermost, and do not put too much of the mixture on at one time. For most mixtures iron spoons are to be preferred to wooden. Keep the fingers on the bowl of spoon, and use the edge for rubbing through with. Sieves should be well washed and brushed after using, and dried in a warm or airy place, and not too near a fire. 135.—MAITRE D’HOTEL BUTTER. Required— 1 oz. Butter. | 1 teasp. chopped Parsley. 1 teaspoonful Lemon Juice. Method— Put all on to a plate, and with a knife work them well together, to form a neat pat. Stand the plate slightly on end, that the lemon juice may run out of the butter again; and set in a cool place or on ice until wanted. The parsley should be very green and very finely chopped to make this butter look well.

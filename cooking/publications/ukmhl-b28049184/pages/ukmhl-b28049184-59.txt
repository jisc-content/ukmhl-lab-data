52 ^ STUFFED AND BAKED HERRING Herring done in this way will keep for several days. More vinegar should be added if required. Do not let the fish get too dry. 52.—STUFFED AND (Fr. Harengs F Ingredients— 4 Herring. 1 des.-spoonful Flour. Pepper and Salt. A little Butter Method— BAKED HERRING, cis au Four.) 2 tablesp. Bread Crumbs. 1 teasp. chopped Parsley. 1 tablespoonful Milk, r Dripping. Wash and clean the fish, cutting off the heads and the fins. Scrape all the scales off with a knife, and then dry the fish in a cloth. Split them open, removing all the bones carefully; and if there are roes, put them on to a greased tin, and bake in the oven about ten minutes. Dip each fish into the flour, coating them lightly, and score the skin across three times with a knife. To make the stuffing, put the bread crumbs, pepper, salt, and parsley into a basin, chop up the roes, add them to it, and moisten with milk. Spread this stuffing on the open side of two of the herring, and cover with the other two, keeping the skin side uppermost this time, and making a sand- wich as it were. Grease a Yorkshire pudding tin with a little dripping, place the fish on this, and put some more dripping or butter in small pieces on the top. Bake in a moderate oven from fifteen to twenty minutes, and serve on a hot ashet with a dish paper under them, and garnish with parsley. Note.—Oatmeal may be used for the stuffing in- stead of bread crumbs.

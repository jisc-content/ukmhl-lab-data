S3 JOHN DORY 53.— JOHN DORY. (Fr. Doret.) Choose this fish of medium size. The large ones are coarse and strong in flavour. Cook it according to any of the Recipes given for Cod or Halibut. 54.—KEDGEREE. Ingredients— ^ lb. cooked Fish. 3 oz. Patna Rice. 2 oz. Butter or Dripping. Pepper and Salt. 1 raw yolk of Egg. 1 teasp. chopped Parsley. Method— Free the fish from all skin and bone, then weigh and chop it finely. Boil the rice according to Recipe 133, and drain it well. Melt the butter or dripping in a saucepan, and put in the fish and rice. Season with pepper and salt, and add the raw yolk of egg. Mix well together, and make thoroughly hot. Pile in the centre of a hot dish, making a neat pyramid, and mark up the sides with a fork. Sprinkle the chopped parsley over and serve very hot. Notes.—Finnan haddock is very nice used in kedgeree. A little curry powder is sometimes added. A hard-boiled egg can also be used, the white chopped and mixed with the other ingredients, and the yolk rubbed through a sieve on to the top of the kedgeree after dishing. The raw yolk of egg may be omitted, but it tends to soften the kedgeree and is an improvement.

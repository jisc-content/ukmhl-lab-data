59 LOBSTER OMELET pieces of shell. Pound some spawn or coral in a mortar with the half ounce of butter, and rub it through a hair sieve. This is called lobster butter. Make a panada by putting the butter and water or stock into a saucepan, and when they boil, stirring in the flour. Mix well with a wooden spoon until per- fectly smooth and well cooked. Then add the lobster, the lobster butter, cream, and seasonings. Mix well together, and turn out on to a plate to cool. When cold and firm, form the mixture into small cutlet- shaped pieces, using a little flour to enable you to shape them more easily. Then egg and bread crumb them (see Recipe 131), and fry in hot fat to a golden brown (see French Frying, p. vii.). Drain well on kitchen paper, and stick a small piece of the feeler or a piece of parsley stalk into the narrow end of each to represent a bone. Dish in a circle on a hot dish with a dish paper under them, and garnish with fried parsley. Curry sauce (see Recipe hi) may be handed separately. 59.—LOBSTER OMELET. (Fr. Omelette au Homard.)

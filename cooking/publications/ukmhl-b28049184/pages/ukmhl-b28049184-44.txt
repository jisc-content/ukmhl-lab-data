31 GURNETS Method— Weigh the fish free from skin and bone, and scrape it down finely with a knife. Make a panada with the butter, flour and milk, or fish stock. Melt the butter in a saucepan, add the flour, and mix until smooth with a wooden spoon. Then pour in the milk or fish stock, and stir until the mixture is thick and begins to draw away from the sides of the saucepan. Put this panada into a mortar with the fish, seasonings, and yolks of eggs. Pound well together, and rub through a fine wire sieve, scraping the sieve well underneath (see No. 134). Beat up the whites of eggs in a basin with a wire whisk until quite stiff, and stir them lightly but thoroughly into the fish mixture with an iron spoon. Pour all into a well-greased mould or souffle tin (the mixture should only half fill the tin), cover with greased paper, and steam slowly for half an hour, or until firm to the touch (see No. 132). Then lift out, and allow the souffle to stand for two minutes. Turn carefully out on to a hot dish, and serve with anchovy or white sauce poured round (see Recipes for Sauces). 31.—GURNETS (TO BAKE).

Dish on a folded napkin and strainer, and serve with appropriate sauce and garnish. Frying. French or Wet Frying. This is cooking in a large quantity of fat, sufficient to cover the article to be fried. Clarified fat, oil or lard may be used for the purpose. The fat must be put into a plain iron stewpan, neither tinned nor enamelled, as the great heat would destroy the lining. Success depends upon getting the fat to the right degree of heat. It must be quite still. If it bubbles it shows that it contains water which must pass off by evaporation before the fat can reach the required heat. A blue, smoky vapour should also be seen rising from it. It should then be used at once, or drawn back from the fire, to prevent its burning and making an unpleasant smell. Fish to be fried must first be coated with flour, egg and bread crumbs, or batter. Small fish, pieces of fish, or made up fish, such as fish cakes, cutlets, &c., may be fried in this fat, but larger pieces which require more cooking must be done by the slower method (see Dry Frying, page viii.). Do not put too many pieces into the pan at one time, as they will cool the fat too much, and always bring it to boiling point again before adding more fish. If the fat is not sufficiently hot, it will soak into the articles fried, and make them greasy in- stead of crisp. Either a frying basket or a perforated

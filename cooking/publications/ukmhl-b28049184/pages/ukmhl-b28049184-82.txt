89 <0$ SOLE Frying Fat. Method— When soles are very small they may be fried whole. Wash and clean them thoroughly, removing the skin, then cut off the heads and fins, and dry well in a cloth. Put a little flour on to a plate, mix with pepper and salt, and dip the fish into this, coating them lightly. Then egg and bread crumb (see No. 131), and fry in boiling fat (see French Frying, page vii.) until well browned. Drain on kitchen paper, and serve on a hot dish with a d’oyley or dish paper under them. Garnish with parsley and cut lemon. Method- Skin and fillet the fish (see page ix.), and wipe the fillets with a damp cloth. Trim neatly, and cut them across in a slanting direction into two or three pieces. Dip each piece into flour, mixed with pepper and salt, shaking them lightly to get rid of all loose flour. Then egg and bread crumb (see No. 131), and fry in boiling fat (see French Frying, page vii.) until of a golden brown colour. Drain well on kitchen paper, and serve on a hot dish with a dish paper under them. Garnish with parsley and cut lemon. Maitre d’hotel butter (see Recipe 135), made up into small pats, may be served separately. 89.—SOLE (TO FRY)—II. (Fr. Sole Frite.) Required— 1 Sole. A little Flour. Pepper and Salt.

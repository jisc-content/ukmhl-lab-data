OYSTERS 66 oyster liquor next into the pan, and when boiling, add one ounce of flour, and mix with a spoon until smooth and the mixture begins to draw away from the sides of the pan. Then add the oysters and cream, season well, and mix thoroughly. Turn the mixture on to a plate, and allow it to cool for at least half an hour. When cold and firm, divide this into eight or ten portions, and shape each one like a cutlet (see Lobster Cutlets, No. 58), using a little flour to prevent the mixture from sticking to the hands and board. Then egg and bread crumb them (see Recipe 131), and fry in boiling fat until of a golden brown colour. Drain well on kitchen paper, and put a small piece of parsley stalk into the end of each to imitate the bone of the cutlet. Put a dish paper or d’oyley on to a hot dish, and dish the cutlets in a circle, one leaning against the other. Garnish with fried parsley (see Recipe 137). Method— Scald the oysters in their own liquor, and drain well. Put them on to a plate, and season with pepper, salt, chopped parsley, and a little grated lemon rind. Make some frying batter (Recipe No. 139), dip each oyster into this, and fry a nice brown colour in boiling 66.-OYSTERS (TO FRY). (Fr. Beignets d’Huitres.) Oysters. Chopped Parsley.

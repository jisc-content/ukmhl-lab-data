GURNETS 32 on both sides with a knife. Grease a pie dish or fire-proof dish, and lay the fish in it. Season well with pepper and salt, sprinkle with finely chopped onion, and squeeze over a little lemon juice. Pour the water or fish stock round, and put the butter in small pieces on the top. Bake in a moderate oven about twenty minutes, or until the fish draws away easily from the bone. Serve in the same dish, wiping round the edges first, and garnish with a few sprigs of parsley or slices of lemon. Note.—The onion may be omitted. A few chopped mushrooms may be added, and brown sauce poured round. Method- Wash and clean the fish thoroughly, removing the head and fins. Skin the fish (see page ix.), and then dip in flour mixed with a little pepper and salt. Next egg and bread crumb the fish (see Recipe 131), and lay them on to a dish or tin with double kitchen paper on it, ready for draining. Melt about two ounces of fat in a frying pan, and let it become smoking hot. Fry the fish slowly in this, first on one side and then on 32.—GURNETS (TO FRY). (Fr. Gournaux Frits.) Required— Gurnets. A little Flour. Pepper and Salt. Egg and Bread Crumbs. Frying Fat. Parsley to garnish. Slices of Lemon.

^ GENERAL RULES FOR COOKING FISH viii. spoon must be used for lifting out the fish. Let them fry a brown colour, and always drain on kitchen paper before serving. Always dish fried things on a d’oyley or dish paper. The fat must not be left on the fire when finished with, but should be strained through a 'piece of muslin into a tin basin, and put aside for further use. If care is taken of it in this way it will keep for a long time, and will not be found an extravagance. Dry Frying. This is suitable for larger pieces of fish, such as cod or salmon steaks, and whole whiting or haddocks, which require a longer time to cook than French fry- ing allows. Dry frying means frying in a saute or frying pan with a small quantity of fat. The fat must be made smoking hot before the fish is placed in it, so that the outside is sealed up, and the juice and flavour retained. Brown the fish first on one side, then turn over with a knife or fish slice, and brown on the other. When cooked, lift out and drain on paper. Serve on a hot dish with a fish paper or d’oyley on it. Steaming. Fish may be cooked by steam instead of boiling it. It is a slower process, but the flavour of the fish is retained better than by boiling. The fish is placed in a steamer which fits on to a saucepan, and success depends upon keeping plenty of water boiling under it. Small pieces of fish may be steamed on a covered plate, placed over a pan of boiling water.

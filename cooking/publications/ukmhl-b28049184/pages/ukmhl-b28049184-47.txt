36 STUFFED FILLETS OF HADDOCK Do not make the stuffing too moist. Put this into the opening of the fish, and sew it up with a needle and strong thread. Melt the dripping in a deep baking tin, and lay the fish into this with its back uppermost, trussed with a skewer in the shape of the letter S. Brush it over with a little of the melted dripping, and then coat it with the browned bread crumbs. Bake in a moderate oven from twenty to thirty minutes, basting every ten minutes with the dripping to pre- vent it becoming dry. When ready, lift with a fish slice on to a hot dish, remove the skewer, and draw the thread carefully out. Serve plain, or with anchovy, parsley, or tomato sauce poured round (see Recipes for Sauces). Garnish with a few sprigs of parsley. 36.—STUFFED FILLETS OF HADDOCK. (Fr. Filets d’Eglefin Farcis.)

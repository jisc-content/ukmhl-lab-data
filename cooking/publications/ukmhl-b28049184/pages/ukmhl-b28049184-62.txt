56 LOBSTER 56.—LOBSTER (TO BOIL). (Fr. Homard Bouilli.) Required— Lobster. | Boiling Water. Salt. Method— Buy lobsters alive, and choose those that are heavy and full of motion. Medium-sized lobsters are best. Have ready on the fire a deep saucepan of boiling water, with salt added to it in the proportion of two tablespoonfuls to one quart. Put in the lobster, and keep it boiling quickly from twenty to forty minutes, according to its size. Skim well when necessary. If boiled too long the meat becomes thready ; and if not long enough, the coral will not be red. Lift out when ready, drain well, and if the shell has to be used in the serving up, rub it over with a little butter or salad oil to polish it. Rub it off again. 57.—LOBSTER, CREAM OF (HOT). (Fr. Creme de Homard Chaud.) Ingredients— 1 small Lobster. 2 oz. Bread Crumbs. 1 oz. Butter. 1 gill of Milk 1 white of Egg. Cardinal Sauce (see Recipe no). 1 gill Double Cream. Pepper and Salt.

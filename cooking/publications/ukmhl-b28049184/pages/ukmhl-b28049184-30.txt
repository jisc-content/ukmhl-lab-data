IS -*>$ EELS Method— Boil the crab according to Recipe 12, and pick all the meat from it, being careful to keep back the part near the head, which is not good. Chop the meat finely, removing any small pieces of shell. Put this into a saucepan with all the other ingredients except the browned bread crumbs and half ounce of butter. Season rather highly with pepper, salt, and cayenne. Make the mixture thoroughly hot over the fire, and return it to the shell, which should previously have been well scrubbed, dried, and greased with a little oil or butter. Sprinkle the browned bread crumbs over the top, and put the butter on in small pieces. Bake in the oven or in front of the fire for about fifteen minutes. Serve on a d’oyley or dish paper, and garnish with parsley and small slices of lemon. Note.—If liked, two tablespoonfuls of tomato purde may be added. Method— Wash the eels, dry and cut them into pieces about three inches long. If the pieces are thick, split them and remove the bone. Put a little flour on to a plate, mix with pepper and salt, and dip each piece of fish 15.-EELS (FRIED). {Fr. Anguilles Frites.) Required- Eels. A little Flour. Pepper and Salt. Frying Fat. 1 Egg.

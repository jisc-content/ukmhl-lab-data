40 ^ RIZZARED HADDOCK fat is cooled down so much that it soaks into the pieces of fish and makes them greasy. Allow the pieces to fry until they are a nice brown colour, then lift out with a spoon—a perforated one is best—and let the fat drain well from them. Put them back on to the piece of kitchen paper to drain. Serve on a hot dish with a fish d’oyley or dish paper on it. Pile high in the centre of the dish, and garnish with parsley. 40.—RIZZARED HADDOCK. (Fr. Eglefin Grille.) Required— Small Haddocks. A little Flour. Salad Oil or Melted Pepper and Salt. Butter. Method— Skin the fish, cut off the heads, and make them thoroughly clean. Brush them all over with salad oil or melted butter, and coat lightly with flour, seasoning with pepper and salt. Score the fish across two or three times, but not very deeply, on both sides. Grease the grill, and make it very hot, either on the top of the fire or by hanging it in front. Broil the fish first on one side and then on the other, allowing from seven to ten minutes, according to size. Serve very hot, with a pat of butter on the top of each. 41.—HALIBUT WITH TOMATOES.

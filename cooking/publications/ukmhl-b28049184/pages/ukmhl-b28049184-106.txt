125 PARSLEY SAUCE Method- Remove the beard and gristle from the oysters. The beard is the part like a fringe that encircles the oyster, and the gristle is hard and white. Cut each oyster in two, and scald them in their own liquor—that is, bring them to the boil and strain. (Keep the liquor for flavouring the sauce.) Put the beards and trimmings of the oysters into a saucepan with the milk, and simmer for a few minutes to extract the flavour. Then strain the milk and oyster liquor through muslin, and keep them for making the sauce. The trimmings of the oysters may now be thrown away. Rinse out the saucepan, and melt in it the butter, add the flour, and mix until smooth with a wooden spoon. Draw the pan to the side of the fire and pour in the strained milk and oyster liquor, then return to the fire, and stir constantly until boiling. Add the cream, and boil again. Season to taste with white pepper, salt, and a pinch of cayenne. Add the oysters and lemon juice last. 125.-PARSLEY SAUCE. {Fr. Sauce k la Maitre d’Hotel.) Ingredients— £ oz. Butter. | oz.

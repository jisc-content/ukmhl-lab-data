<05 DIFFERENT KINDS OF FISH ii. Brill (Fr. Barbue).—Like the turbot in appear- ance, and much cheaper. When fresh, the flesh should be of a yellowish tint; if blue, it is not good. Choose a thick one. Is generally boiled. Carp (Fr. Carpe).—A fresh-water fish. Medium sized is the best. Should be soaked in salt and water an hour or two before being used, and should be very carefully washed, as owing to their habit of burying themselves in mud they often have a disagreeable flavour. They are better to be kept a day or two before being used, and should be served with a good sauce. Cod (Fr. Morue).—Choose one plump and round, of medium size, the head and tail small in proportion, and the sides looking as if there were ribs in the flesh. Crabs (Fr. Crabe). — The medium sized are best. Choose a heavy one, for if light it is watery. The male crab is the best for table, and may be dis- tinguished by its large claws. Cray-fish (Fr. Ecrevisses).—Used principally as a garnish, or for making soup. Like lobsters in appear- ance, but smaller and of more delicate flavour. Eels (Fr. Anguilles).—Different species. Salt water and fresh water. The Conger Eel (Anguille de Mer) is a favourite with many people. Its flesh is firm and hard, and requires long and careful cooking. Flounders (Fr. Carrelets).—A flat fish of rather poor quality. Choose a plump one. They are best broiled or fried, or baked au gratin.

IX. TO SKIN AND FILLET A HADDOCK Broiling. To broil fish is to cook it over, or in front of, the fire on a gridiron. The fire must be bright and with- out smoke. The gridiron should be greased and made thoroughly hot before the fish is put on to it. The fish ought to be placed rather near the fire at first, and then raised or drawn back to cook more slowly. Turn occasionally while cooking. Some fish are wrapped in oiled paper before broiling to prevent the escape of any juice. Anything broiled should be sent to table as quickly as possible. TO SKIN AND FILLET A HADDOCK. First wash the haddock in cold water, and cut off all the fins. Make a slit in the skin up both sides, so that it can easily be removed. Make a cut across the skin just below the head, and commence at the flap part. Loosen the skin there, keeping down the flesh with the knife, and beginning very carefully; then pull downwards towards the tail. Turn, and do the other side in the same way. To fillet it, remove the flesh cleanly from the bones on both sides of the fish. Commence at the open side of the fish, slipping the knife along close to the bone, and laying the flesh backwards, but do not separate it from the other side. Turn, and do the other side in the same way. A filleted haddock should be in one piece.

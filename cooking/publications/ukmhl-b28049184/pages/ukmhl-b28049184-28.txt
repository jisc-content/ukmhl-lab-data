12 CRAB under them. Melt two or three tablespoonfuls of clarified fat or dripping in a frying pan, and when smoking hot, put the pieces of fish into it and fry them slowly, first on one side and then on the other, until nicely browned. About ten minutes will be required to cook the steaks. Lift out, and drain well on kitchen paper. Serve on a hot dish with a dish paper or ser- viette under them, and garnish with some nice sprigs of parsley. Tomato or anchovy sauce may be served separately in a sauce-boat (see Recipes for Sauces). Note.—These steaks can be done in a simpler way by dipping them in milk after flouring them, and then in flour again, instead of egging and bread crumbing. 12.—CRAB (TO BOII4. (An Crabe Bouilli.) Required— A Crab. Boiling Water. Salt Method— Choose a crab of medium size and heavy; the light ones are watery. Preference should be given to those with a rough shell and claws. The joints of the claws should be stiff, the shell a bright red, and the eyes bright. Put enough water into a large saucepan or fish kettle to cover the crab. Add salt in the propor- tion of one tablespoonful to each quart of water, and bring to the boil. Tie the claws of the crab together, and when the water is fast boiling, plunge it in. Boil quickly from twenty to thirty minutes, then lift out and drain.

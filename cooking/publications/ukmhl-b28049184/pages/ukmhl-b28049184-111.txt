I3I ^ TO EGG AND BREAD CRUMB MISCELLANEOUS. i3I.â€”TO EGG AND BREAD CRUMB. The bread crumbs for this purpose should be fine and dry. The simplest way to make them is to rub some rather stale bread through a wire sieve. From one to two breakfast-cupfuls will be required according to the number of articles to be coated, and for the sake of convenience have them on a good-sized sheet of white paper. The egg should be broken on to a plate, yolk and white together, and beaten with a fork until it ceases to be stringy. When eggs are expensive, and one is not sufficient, one or two tablespoonfuls of milk may be added instead of a second egg. Put the things to be egged one by one into the plate, and coat them all over with the egg, using a small brush. See that every part is well covered, or they will look patchy when fried. Do it quickly, otherwise the egg soaks in, and makes the things soft. Then drop the egged thing on to the top of the bread crumbs, lifting it with a knife. Cover it quite over with crumbs by jerking the sides of the paper, then press the crumbs on with the hands and shake the loose ones off. Lay the article down on a board, and with a flat knife press the crumbs well on and make the sides tidy. When ready, place on a plate or tin with double paper on it, and if time permits, allow the things thus prepared to stand a little while to harden before frying.

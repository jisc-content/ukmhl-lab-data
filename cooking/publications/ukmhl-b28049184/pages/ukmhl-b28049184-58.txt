Method- Wash and clean the herring, cutting off the heads and the fins, and scraping the skin well with a knife. Dry them in a cloth, and then split them open, and remove all the bones. Cut each herring in two lengthways. Put the flour, pepper, salt, and mace on to a plate, and mix them well together. Dip each piece of herring into this, and roll them up from the thick end towards the tail. Pack them into a greased pie dish, putting them in two layers if necessary. Pour round them in equal quantities water and brown vinegar, enough to half fill the dish. Put in the cloves and peppercorns. A bay leaf may also be added. Place small pieces of dripping here and there over the top, and bake in a moderate oven for one hour. Set aside till cold. Serve as many pieces of fish as will be required at one time on a clean ashet, pour a little of the liquid round them, and garnish with parsley.

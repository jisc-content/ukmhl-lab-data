II *05 COD STEAKS hair sieve. Reheat this purde with the butter, pepper, salt, and a little cream. Pour it over the fish, and garnish with a little very finely chopped parsley. Note.—First wash the parsnips well, brushing all earth off with a vegetable brush, and cut off the tops. Then take clean cold water, and scrape the parsnips lightly from the thick end downwards, until all black is removed. If large, cut them into pieces. Have ready on the fire a saucepan of boiling water, salted in the proportion of one dessert-spoonful to one quart; drain the parsnips and throw them into this. Boil gently with the lid on the pan, for one hour or until tender. Then drain. Method— Take as many slices of cod as required. These are best cut from the tail-end of the fish, and should be about three-quarters of an inch in thickness. Wash them lightly, scraping the skin with a knife, and then dry with a cloth. Mix a little flour, pepper and salt, on a plate; dip the pieces of fish into this, coating them lightly on both sides. This dries the fish thoroughly, and makes it fry better. Then egg and bread crumb the steak (see Recipe 131), and lay them on a dish or tin with a double layer of paper 11.—COD STEAKS. (Fr. Filets de Morue.) Required— Slices of Cod. A little Flour.

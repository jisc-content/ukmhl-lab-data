Method— Pick the meat from the two crabs, keeping back the unwholesome part near the head. Scrub one of the shells thoroughly to receive the mixture, dry and grease it with a little oil or butter. Chop the meat from the crabs very finely, being very careful to remove any small pieces of shell. Mix all the ingredients together in a basin, and season rather highly with pepper, salt, and cayenne. Return this to the prepared shell, and garnish with sprigs of parsley and thin slices of lemon. Serve on a folded d’oyley or dish paper.

Serve hot garnished with parsley. 63.—MUSSELS A LA POULETTE. (Fr. Moules.) Ingredients— 1 quart Mussels. 1 Onion. A few sprigs of Parsley. Pepper and Salt. £ pint White Wine. Method— Choose small mussels; they are the most delicate. Scrape the shells carefully with a knife, and wash well in cold water, changing the water several times until the mussels are quite free from grit. Put the mussels into a saute pan or shallow stewpan, with the onion thinly sliced, sprigs of parsley, white wine, pepper and salt. Cover the pan, put it on the fire, and toss the mussels occasionally. When the shells open, the mussels are done. Drain them, and strain the liquor into a basin. Remove one shell from the mussels; dip them in plenty of hot water; drain and wipe them. Melt the butter in the pan, add the flour, and mix until smooth with a wooden spoon. Pour in the strained liquor, and stir until boiling. Add the yolk of egg and chopped parsley, and allow the sauce to thicken, but do not boil again. Put the mussels on to a hot dish, and pour the sauce over them. £ oz. isutter. \ oz. Flour. 1 des.-spoonful chopped Parsley. 1 yolk of Egg.

Dish the fish on a hot dish with a fish napkin under it, and garnish with cut lemon and sprigs of parsley. Serve melted butter, parsley, or anchovy sauce separately. If the fish is small, it may be served on a hot dish, and the sauce poured over, coating it well. 35.—STUFFED AND BAKED HADDOCK. (Fr. Eglefin Farci au Four.)

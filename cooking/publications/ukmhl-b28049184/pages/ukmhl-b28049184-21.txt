4 COD little white pepper and salt. Then make the batter. Sieve the flour into a basin, and with a wooden spoon make a well in the centre of it. Break the egg into a cup or small basin; do not beat it, but if it is quite fresh, drop it into the centre of the flour. Mix some of the flour gradually into it with the wooden spoon, and add half the milk by degrees. Beat the batter well until it is perfectly smooth and full of air bubbles, then add to it the rest of the milk, the butter or dripping melted, and the chopped parsley. If time permits, let this batter stand for a short time. It gives the flour time to swell, and makes it lighter. Then pour it over the fish, and wipe round the edges of the pie dish. Bake in a moderate oven from twenty to thirty minutes until the batter is well risen and nicely brown, and the fish feels tender. Serve as soon after it is taken from the oven as possible. Notes.—Any white fish may be used instead of cod, or the remains of cold cooked fish. Half a teaspoonful of finely powdered mixed herbs may be used in addition to or instead of the parsley. The dish may be made richer by adding a few oysters, shrimps, or slices of hard-boiled egg. 4.—COD (TO BOIL). (Fr. Morue Bouillie.) Required— Cod. Vinegar. Boiling Water. Sauce. Salt.

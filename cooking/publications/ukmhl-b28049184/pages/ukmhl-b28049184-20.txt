•■OS COD BAKED IN BATTER 3 Sauce—Brown, Reform, Caper, Anchovy, or Melted Butter. (See Recipes for Sauces.) Method— Wash and clean the fish thoroughly. Remove the head and fins, and scrape off the scales with a knife. To Make the Stuffing.—Put the bread crumbs into a basin with the parsley very finely chopped, the herbs finely powdered, lemon rind, anchovy essence, pepper and salt. Mix well, and add sufficient milk or beaten egg to bind all together. Be careful not to make the stuffing too wet. Stuff the fish with this, and sew up with a needle and thread. Then coat the fish lightly with flour to dry it, brush over with milk or beaten egg, and sprinkle with bread crumbs. Melt the butter or dripping in a deep baking dish or tin, place the fish on it, and bake in a moderate oven from half to three- quarters of an hour, basting frequently with the fat. Serve on a hot dish, drawing out the thread. 3.-COD BAKED IN BATTER. Ingredients— 1 lb. Cod. 2 oz. Flour. gills Milk. 1 Egg.

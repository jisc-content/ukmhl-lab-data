^ COD’S ROE 7 Wash the roe well in cold water, but do not let it soak, then tie it up in a piece of muslin or a pudding cloth, to prevent it breaking. Put it into a saucepan or fish kettle of slowly boiling water, salted in the pro- portion of one tablespoonful to one quart of water, and add a few drops of vinegar. The water should just cover the roe. Simmer slowly from fifteen to twenty minutes according to size. When ready, lift the roe out, and let the water drain well from it. Serve on a hot dish with white or parsley sauce poured over it {see Recipes for Sauces), or on a folded serviette, and hand the sauce separately. 7.—COD’S ROE (FRIED). (Fr. Laitances Frites.) Required— Cooked Cod’s Roe. | Frying Fat. Parsley. Boil the roe according to directions given in Recipe 6, and let it get quite cold. Then cut it into slices about half an inch thick, using a very sharp knife. Melt two ounces of dripping or clarified fat in a frying pan, and let it get smoking hot. Put the pieces of roe into this, fry a nice brown colour first on one side and then on the other, turning them with a knife. When ready, lift out and drain on kitchen paper. Serve on a hot dish with a d’oyley or dish paper on it, and garnish with parsley.

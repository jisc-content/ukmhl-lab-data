DIFFERENT KINDS OF FISH iii. Gurnet (Fr. Gournal).—An excellent fish, with firm white flesh and a pleasant flavour. It has a very large head in proportion to the rest of its body. Haddock (Fr. Eglefin).—Choose one of medium size. When large, their flesh is coarse. On each side of its body, just below the gills, there is a dark mark, which superstition calls the finger and thumb mark of St Peter. The flesh of the haddock is firm and of a delicate flavour. Halibut.—A flat fish, like the turbot in appear- ance, but much cheaper. Its flesh is very wholesome and of good flavour. Herring (Fr. Harengs).—When fresh, has a bright and silvery appearance. If red about the eyes, has been dead some time. Should be well covered with scales, and be plump. John Dory (Fr. Doret).—Its flesh is rather tough, and is better kept a day or two before being cooked. It is an unsightly fish, but of good flavour. Ling (Fr. Lingue).—A cheap fish, not unlike cod. Rather tasteless. Requires a good sauce. Lobsters (Fr. Hojtiard).—Choose medium-sized lobsters, which feel heavy and are lively. It is best to buy them alive. The hen is valuable on account of the spawn, but the flesh of the cock is more delicate. Mullet, Grey (Fr. Mulet).—Inferior to red mullet. Like mackerel, it should be eaten while quite fresh. Mullet, Red (Fr. Rouget).—This fish is best and most plentiful in summer. Should never be boiled. Is best baked or broiled. Are better kept for a short time before using.

Salt in the proportion of to cover \ lb. to each gallon of water. A little Lemon Juice. Method— Choose a thick medium-sized turbot. If too large, the flesh will be tough. Thoroughly clean the fish, and let it lie in salt and water for one hour before cooking it, to take off the slime. Then rinse in clean cold water. Do not cut off the fins, as they are con- sidered a delicacy. Rub the turbot all over with lemon juice to keep the flesh firm and white, and make two or three notches in the skin to prevent it cracking. Put it into a fish or turbot kettle with sufficient warm water to cover it, and salt in the above proportion. Bring it slowly to the boil, and skim well. Simmer very gently for twenty minutes or longer until the flesh comes away easily from the bone. When done, lift it out, and drain well. Serve on a hot dish with a fish d’oyley under it, and garnish with tufts of parsley, cut lemon, and lobster coral. Lobster or shrimp sauce should accompany it

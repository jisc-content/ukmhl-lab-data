i8 ^ FISH CAKES 18.-FISH CAKES—II. (Fr. Gateaux de Poisson.) Make in the same way as last recipe, using well boiled and dried rice instead of potatoes. 19.—FISH CREAM. {Fr. Creme de Poisson.) Ingredients— | lb. uncooked Fish. 1 oz. Butter. 1 oz. Bread Crumbs. 1 gill of Milk. White Sauce. Pepper 1 gill Double Cream. 1 white of Egg. A pinch of Nutmeg. A squeeze of Lemon Juice, and Salt. Method— Weigh the fish, free from skin and bone, and shred it down finely with a knife. Put it into a mortar, and pound it well. Rinse out a small saucepan with cold water, to prevent the mixture sticking to it. Put into it the butter and the milk, and bring them to the boil over the fire. Then add the bread crumbs, and stir with a wooden spoon over the fire until the bread crumbs swell and the mixture thickens. Add this mixture to the fish in the mortar, pound well together, and rub through a wire sieve, scraping the sieve well underneath. Put the mixture into a basin, and season to taste. Beat up the white of egg with a knife on a plate until stiff, and whip the cream in a basin with a wire whisk until thick. Add both these to the fish mixture, and stir them in as lightly as possible with an iron spoon. Pour the mixture into a well-greased mould. The

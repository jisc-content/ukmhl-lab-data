i7 FISH CAKES 17.—FISH CAKES—I. (JFr. Gateaux de Poisson.) Ingredients— \ lb. cooked Fish. b lb. cooked Potatoes. 1 oz. Butter. 1 yolk of Egg. 1 teaspoonful chopped Parsley. x teaspoonful Anchovy Essence. Pepper and Salt. A little Flour, Egg, and Bread Crumbs. Method— The remains of any cold cooked fish may be used for making fish cakes. Free the fish from all skin and bone, then weigh it. Chop it finely, being most careful to remove any small bones, which might be most dangerous if left in. Sieve the potatoes, or put them through a vegetable presser, and chop the parsley very finely. Melt the butter in a saucepan, then add to it the fish, potatoes, parsley, yolk of egg, and seasonings, and mix well together over the fire. Turn out on to a plate, smooth over with a knife, and set aside to cool. When the mixture feels firm, divide it into ten or twelve small pieces. Flour the hands, take one piece at a time, and roll it into a ball, laying them as they are formed on a slightly floured board. Then with a knife, also floured, flatten them slightly, and shape them into neat round cakes. Egg and bread crumb them (see Recipe 131), and fry in boiling fat (see French Frying, page vii.) to a nice brown colour. Drain well, and serve piled high on a hot dish with a dish paper under them, and garnish with parsley.

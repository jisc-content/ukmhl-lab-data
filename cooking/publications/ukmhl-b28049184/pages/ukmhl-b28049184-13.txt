^ HOW TO CLEAN FISH Trout (Fr. Truites.)—The body has a silver and golden appearance when fresh. Those weighing about one pound are best. Turbot (Fr. Turbot).—The best of all flat fish. The flesh is firm, rich, and white. Is better to be kept a day or two before using. The thick part of the fins especially favoured by the epicure. A middle- sized one is best. Whitebait (Fr. Bla?ichailles).—A very small fish of silvery appearance. Highly esteemed. Must be used quite fresh. Best in May, June, and July. Whiting (Fr. Merlan).—A good fish when fresh. Delicate in flavour, and easy of digestion. HOW TO CLEAN FISH. Do not wash fish too much, as by so doing you lose some of the flavour. Some fish are cut open before being emptied; others have the insides drawn out. Be careful not to disfigure the fish. Clean it thoroughly, and see that no blood is left on the bone. If the fish feels slimy, rub it well with a little salt. Scales should be scraped off with a knife, scraping from the tail upwards, and the fish well rinsed after- wards. In cutting off the fins, cut from the tail up- wards. In taking out the eyes, if the skin over them is tough, cut it first with a pair of scissors, and then the eye can easily be pulled out, or pushed out from the inside. Fish that have a strong muddy flavour should be soaked in salt and water before being cooked. Thorough cleansing of fish is essential to its wholesomeness.

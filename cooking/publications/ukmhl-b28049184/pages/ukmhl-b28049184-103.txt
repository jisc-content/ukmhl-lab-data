120 MAYONNAISE SAUCE put them into the basin with the pepper, salt, mustard, and sugar. (The sugar may be omitted if not liked.) Mix these well together with a wooden spoon or small wire whisk. Cut a small wedge from the cork of the salad oil bottle, large enough to allow the oil to come out, drop by drop, when it is held up. Keep stirring the yolks all the time with the right hand and drop- ping the oil in from the bottle with the left until the sauce is so thick that it is stirred with difficulty. One gill is about the usual quantity required for two yolks, but there is no necessity to measure it. Next add the vinegars gradually, and mix well. Notes.â€”If this sauce is not kept cool, or the oil mixed in too quickly, it will curdle. It cannot be made in a hurry. If it should curdle, the fault may be remedied by putting a fresh yolk into another basin and adding the sauce very slowly to it, stirring all the time. A whiter sauce can be made by using lemon juice instead of vinegar. More or less vinegar may be added to the sauce, according to taste, and according to the purpose for which it is to be used. If used for dressing a salad, it should be thinned down considerably with vinegars. If used for coating anything such as salmon, a little liquid aspic is usually added to make it stiffen. If this sauce has to be kept for several hours before using, cover the basin containing it with a cloth wrung out of very cold water. This will prevent a skin forming on the top. If bottled and kept in a cool dark place it will be good for a week or longer, and is useful for salad dressings. Be particular to use good oil. / G

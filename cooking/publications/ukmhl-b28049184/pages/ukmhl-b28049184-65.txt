6o ^ MACKEREL thoroughly in a saucepan with the white sauce, season- ing rather highly with white pepper, salt, and a pinch of cayenne. Keep this warm whilst preparing the omelet. To Make the Omelet.—First separate the yolks from the whites of the eggs, putting them into separate basins. Add to the yolks of the eggs the anchovy essence, chopped parsley, and seasonings. Mix well with a wooden spoon until the mixture is of a creamy consistency. Then add a pinch of salt to the whites, and with a wire whisk beat them up to a very stiff froth. Stir these very lightly into the yolks, &c., using an iron spoon, and keep turning the mixture over and over until of a uniform colour. Melt the butter in a frying or omelet pan, and turn the mix- ture into it. Keep stirring over a good fire until it begins to set and get lumpy. Then free from the edges with a knife, and hold for a minute or two longer over the fire. Put the hot lobster mixture into the centre, and fold the omelet over it, first from one side, and then from the other, making the edges overlap in the middle. Slip carefully on to a very hot dish with a dish paper on it, and serve the omelet as quickly as possible. 60.—MACKEREL (TO BROIL). (Fr. Maquereau Grille.)

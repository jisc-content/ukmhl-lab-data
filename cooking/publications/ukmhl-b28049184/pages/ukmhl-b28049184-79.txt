§2 <«£SCALLOPED SCALLOPS in the proportion of half gill to half pint of sauce. Use the sauce in a setting condition, covering the fish all over, and then set aside until firm. Garnish with any- thing suitable, such as lobster coral, truffle, parsley, lettuce, endive, cucumber, &c. A border of chopped aspic will make a pretty finish to the dish. Notes.—Remains of cold salmon may be used for this dish. The fish ought to be flaked, piled high on a dish, and then coated with sauce. Method— Choose perfectly fresh scallops, open and remove them from the shells. Cut off the beards and black part, and wash them thoroughly. Wash and scrub the deeper shells and dry them. Grease them with butter, and sprinkle a few white bread crumbs over. Lay three scallops into each shell, and season them with pepper, salt, lemon juice, and a little chopped parsley. Cover with more bread crumbs, and put some small pieces of butter on the top. Brown quickly in a hot oven or before the fire. Serve on a hot dish with a dish paper under them, and garnish with cut lemon and parsley. 82.—SCALLOPED SCALLOPS. Required- Scallops. Pepper and Salt. Lemon Juice. White Bread Crumbs.

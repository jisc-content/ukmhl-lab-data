J>9 (34) STEWED VEGETABLE MARROW. Ingredients :—1 small Marrow. 1 small Onion. 1 oz. of Butter or Dripping. 1 teaspoonful of Salt. 5 teaspoonful of Pepper. Method :—Peel the marrow and onion; cut the marrow into small thick squares; take out seeds ; chop the onion finely. Put the butter or dripping, pepper and salt into a saucepan; when the butter is melted add the onion, shake it over the fire for 5 minutes without allowing it to brown; add the marrow, and let it cook slowly until it pulps; stir it sometimes to prevent burning; then turn it nicely into a hot vegetable dish. Serve with toast. Time 1| hour. (35) BOILED POTATOES. Ingredients :—1 pint of Water. 1 teaspoonful of Salt. 1 lb. Potatoes. Method:—Scrub and wash the potatoes; peel very thinly; take out the eyes; wash the potatoes again. Put some cold water into a saucepan, add salt (in the above proportion), and the potatoes; boil very gently from 20 to 30 minutes. Try with a skewer; if tender, strain off the water, keep the lid off, and shake the pan to let the steam escape from the bottom, then put a clean cloth on the top to absorb the remaining steam; put the pan near the fire for 5 minutes, and shake them over the fire until dry. Turn on a hot dish and serve. New potatoes are always scraped and put on in boiling water with salt in. They take about 20 minutes to boil, and are strained, steamed, and dried like old ones. A little mint boiled with them is an improvement. Time varies.

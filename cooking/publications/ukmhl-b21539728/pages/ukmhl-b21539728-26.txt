(24) TO BOIL FISH. Ingredients :—2 quarts of Water. 1 dessert-spoonful of Salt. Fish. Method :—Put the water in a saucepan to get warm. (Warm water should be used for all white fish; boiling water cracks the skin and spoils the appearance, although boiling water prevents the goodness being drawn from the fish. Salmon always goes on in boiling water to set the colour.) See that the fish is fresh ; scrape the skin to remove the scales; take out inside and eyes; cut off the fins. Wash the fish well and dry it; put it on a drainer; add the salt to warm water, and then the fish; boil very gently from 10 to 15 or 20 minutes, according to thickness. When the skin or the bones easily leave the fish it is done; take up, drain water from it, put on a hot dish, serve plain or with melted butter over it. Time varies. (25) BAKED HADDOCK.

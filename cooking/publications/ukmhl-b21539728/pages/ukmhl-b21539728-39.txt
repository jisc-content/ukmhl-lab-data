N.B.—The better the quality of the flour the more water it will require. Method :—Put nearly all the flour in a large basin (the rest on a plate); mix in the salt; put yeast and sugar into another basin, work with a spoon to a paste, add the water (it must be tepid, i.e., one-third boiling, two-thirds cold); pour in middle of flour; make into a light dough, then knead it with the hand until smooth ; cover basin with a cloth; set near the fire ; let dough rise two hours. Put rest of flour with it and knead again. Turn the dough on a floured board, divide it into two or three; divide each piece in two, one smaller than the other, work both into balls ; put small ones on large, press together in the 'middle •; notch round with a knife. Place the loaves on, or in, floured tins; let rise | hour, bake in hot oven for about 1 hour. Smaller loaves take less time to bake. While bread is baking the oven must not be opened many times. When the bread is done it sounds hollow, and must be put aside to get cold.

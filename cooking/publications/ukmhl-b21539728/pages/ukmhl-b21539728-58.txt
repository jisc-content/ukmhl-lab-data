Ingredients :—4 ozs. Flour. 1 Egg. 4 pt. Milk. | teaspoonful Salt. Sugar, Lard, and Lemon. Method :—Mix the Hour and salt in a basin, break the egg into a cup, put it in the middle of the flour and add a little milk at a time, stir from the middle until the flour is mixed smoothly and half the milk used, then beat it well and add the rest of the milk. (Let it stand, if possible, half an hour.) Put a small piece of lard in a small frying pan; when melted, pour in batter to cover the pan; let it set. Shake the pan, to prevent the cake sticking; fry about two minutes, then turn it, either by tossing or with a knife. Then fry it for one minute or until brown, turn it on a piece of paper, sprinkle with sugar and lemon juice, roll up, and continue to fry the batter in the same way. When all the cakes are made arrange them on a hot dish on paper and sprinkle with castor sugar. The cakes may have more eggs if wished richer.

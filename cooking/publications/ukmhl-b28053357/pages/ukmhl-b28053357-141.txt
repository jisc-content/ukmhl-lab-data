HOW TO TEUSS FOWLS. 129 pass a second string on the same principle as the first, but taking the following road: through the small of the back (Fig. 3), and then through one leg just above the heel, then Fig. 4. under the skin, and under the end of the breast bone and out at the other side through the other leg just above the heel; tying the string tightly as the first was tied (Fig. 4).

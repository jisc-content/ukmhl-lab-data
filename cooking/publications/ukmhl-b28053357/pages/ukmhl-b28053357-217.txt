/ DRIED BEANS. 205 DRIED BEANS. It is strange that the only dried legume which is used to any extent in England, should be one of the most indi- gestible of them all. With the rare exception of a few haricot beans, peas are the only dried vegetables ad- mitted into English cookery, of which pea soup and pease pudding are well-known institutions. I have seen it stated as a fact, and no doubt with truth, in a standard work on matters domestic, that lentils were not used as an article of human food in this country. Now, although these do not much differ from dried peas in their compo- sition, yet they contain a certain aromatic principle which, while it renders them easier of digestion, imparts to them a very agreeable taste. One of the best of thick soups, the potage ci la Conti, is naught else but a puree of lentils, and the potage a la Conde, another very good soup, is simply a puree of a particular kind of haricot beans. These, of which there are numerous varieties, are unquestionably the most nutritious of all dried vege- tables. They only contain about eight per cent, less of starch, dextrine, and sugar than wheat, while of azotised substances they contain over four per cent. more. But, apart from any considerations of digestibility and of nutri- tiveness, these dried vegetables are the foundation of many agreeable dishes, besides soups ; and as variety of food is one of the great essentials of good health, many people would gladly use these things if they knew how to pre- pare them, and this is what I will endeavour to explain.

ROUND THE TABLE. 256 above all the flavour of garlic should be properly regu- lated, and should not be too strong. If the proportions of the various ingredients are in the least degree altered from the right point, or if the mixture be allowed to get too hot in the preliminary manipulations, or if the Fondue is baked too little or too much, all hope of success is at an end. In short, to attain even moderate perfec- tion in the preparation of this dish a great amount of care and perseverance are required. Parmesan is the only cheese which can be used for the above dish. With English cheeses, such as Cheshire or Gloucester, and even the American imitations of these, other dishes may be prepared in the nature of a Fondue, but by no means so delicate. These are some of them: 1. Make a thickish paste in a saucepan with milk and flour, taking care that it is quite smooth; add to and thoroughly mix with it as much grated cheese (Cheshire, &c.) as you have used flour and a little over, a small quantity of salt, a little flour of mustard, and some pepper. Beat up, say for evei’y pint of milk used, three eggs. Incoi’porate these with the paste, then fill a dish, or a number of patty pans, with this paste. Bake a nice brown colour, and serve quickly. 2.

Beat up the whites of the eggs to a stiff froth, quickly mix the two together, fill some patty pans or some

126 ROUND THE TABLE. HOW TO TRUSS FOWLS. The ways of putting fowls to death, are various. It might he done by shooting; but, presuming that you have first caught your fowl, it is the common practice to stretch, break, or twist the creature’s neck—in fact, to slay it by strangulation. This is bad. The best way is to cut the fowl’s throat, and to let the animal bleed. It is obvious that by this means it will be better to eat, and if this mode of death be thought cruel, let the fowl be decapitated; and if any one object to this on the ground of cruelty, I will refer him to the account in the Lancet of certain experiments made in Paris on the subject of de- capitation. The operation of plucking hardly requires explanation. This done; the fowl must be singed by exposing it to the flame of a piece of lighted paper, the object of this being to destroy the minute feathers (hairs as they are called) which cannot be pulled out in the plucking. But this must be done with dexterity and care, lest the skin be singed, or blackened. Then comes the trussing; which is of two forms, the one when the fowl is to be roasted, and the other when it is to be boiled or to be braised. I will not discuss the merits of the various ways of conducting these operations, but I will proceed to expound what in my opinion is the proper manner of trussing a fowl. Having loosened the skin round the vent with the point of a knife, lay the fowl on the table back upper- most, and make an incision in the skin of the neck lengthwise, pull out the neck free from the skin and

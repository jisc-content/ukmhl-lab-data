There now remain two vegetables yet to be dealt with, which if they be among the lowest in the classification of naturalists, are the very highest in that of cooks. MrsH- eooms and truffles, without doubt, are of the greatest help to professors by the matchless flavour they impart to the preparations in which they are used. They are, however, often eaten alone, and I will describe some approved ways of preparing them for that purpose, although I think that, especially in the case of truffles—unfortunately expensive things—they are best used in flavouring sauces and ragouts and in stuffing turkeys and pheasants. The primitive or English fashion of cooking mush- rooms consists in broiling them on a gridiron, or frying them with a little butter; but both these methods are

EGGS. 247 been put into the clisli in which they are to be served, and that therefore allowance must be made for this in judging the time that they are to remain in the omelet or saute-pan. This is a point of the greatest importance, particularly in cooking omelets; and cooking scrambled eggs—which are in truth but an omelet with no outside or shape—is very good practice for learning to judge time in the more difficult process of producing an omelet which, while retaining the soft nature of scrambled eggs inside, must have both shape and colour. The production of an omelet may be divided into two operations—the mixing and the cooking. The first can easily be described in words, and is capable of numerous variations. The second is the most difficult to describe and to carry out—although simple enough when once you know it. I must again repeat that the omelet-pan should be perfectly clean ; this is indispensable. The fire should be bright. These conditions being fulfilled, put a piece of butter the size of an egg into the pan, let it melt with- out browning, and as soon as it is melted and hot pour in your omelet mixture, and, holding the handle of the pan with one hand, stir the omelet with the other by means of a flat spoon. The moment it begins to set cease stirring, but keep shaking the pan for a minute or so; then with the ladle or spoon double up your omelet, and keep on shaking the pan until one side of the omelet has become a golden colour, when you dexterously turn it out on a hot dish, the coloured side uppermost. After the omelet is doubled up, the insertion of a little piece of butter under it facilitates operations. Two points to be observed are, that the coloured side of the omelet should be like gold, and that this result should be attained with- out the inside becoming too firmly set. The mode of cooking omelets varies according to their

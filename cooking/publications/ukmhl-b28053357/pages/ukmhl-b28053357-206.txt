194 BOUND THE TABLE. 2. Fill up the interior of each onion with some nicely- flavoured forcemeat; dispose them in a well-buttered saucepan, add a bundle of herbs, &c., as before, and cover the whole with slices of bacon. When the onions are done, remove them into a dish. Make a sauce of what is left in the saucepan by adding some flour to it, and, if necessary, some other condiments, and some stock or broth. Skim off superfluous fat, strain and pour the sauce over the onions, and serve. 3. Another way is, instead of making a sauce of what is left in the saucepan, to use some Spanish or Italian sauce. 4. Tomato sauce goes very well with stewed onions, either stuffed or not. This is the formula which I prefer to most. Make a mixture of bread crumbs, pure tomato sauce, a small quantity of ham finely minced, and one or two raw eggs, with pepper, salt, and powdered spices. Stuff the onions with this, and put them to stew, with a bundle of sweet herbs, in a saucepan well lined with bacon; moisten with some well-flavoured tomato sauce, and when done serve with the sauce over, having previously removed the superfluous fat from it. Bread sippets fried in butter should almost invariably be served with all the above dishes of onions. Vegetable marrows, cucumbers, and tomatoes make very nice dishes if treated by stuffing. It is a very good way of utilising those scraps of meat which are always going begging, so to speak, in most kitchens. Of course all depends upon the making of the stuffing, call it chair a quenelles, farce, forcemeat, or what not. The following will be found a good common form : Remove every particle of fat, skin, and gristle from the scraps of meat to be used; then pound the meat in a mortar and force it through a wire sieve; pound again

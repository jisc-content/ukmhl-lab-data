BOUND THE TABLE. 222 yolks for tke above, or you may use both raw and boiled yolks, half of each. The following are other forms of Mayonnaise. 1. Beat up the yolks raw, strain, and mix with them the pepper, salt, and (gradually) the oil and vinegar, with mustard, &c.; then add equal parts of cream and calves’-foot jelly, about one tablespoonful of each, if four tablespoonfuls of oil have been used. Set on ice till wanted, if in summer. 2. Make a custard with four eggs, half a pint of milk, and a little gelatine. When cold add a gill of cream, and (a little at a time) about one and a half tablespoonfuls of salad oil, and the same quantity of tarragon vinegar in which has been dissolved as much salt as may be neces- sary. 3. Strain the yolks of four eggs into a basin, which you place in a cool place, or, if necessary, in water or on ice; then proceed to pour in—a few drops at a time— some salad oil without ceasing to stir the mixture. When about one tablespoonful of oil is well incorporated with the yolks of egg, put in, in the same manner, a tea- spoonful of French vinegar. Keep on adding oil and vinegar in these proportions until you get a sauce the consistency of very thick cream. You then add salt and white pepper to taste, and mix them well. 4. Add to the above, to give it a green colour, a suffi- cient quantity of the following herbs, very finely minced, tarragon, chervil, and garden cress in about equal propor- tions. Another variety of mayonnaise consists in using lemon juice as well as aromatised vinegar, of course in proper proportion. The great secret of success in a mayonnaise consists in the operation of mixing, and patience and hard work go a good way towards it. Some cookery

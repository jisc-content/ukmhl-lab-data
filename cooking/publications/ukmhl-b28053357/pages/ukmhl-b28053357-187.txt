The inside of a French roll—soaked in milk or broth—added to the vegetables before they are passed through the sieve may be used instead of flour at the next stage of the process. A little sugar may be advan- tageously added to certain purees, such as peas, Jeru- salem artichokes, and onions. Purees can be made with the following vegetables besides those mentioned already, or with any combination of them : Asparagus, artichokes, broad beans, carrots, cabbage, celery, haricot beans, Jerusalem artichokes, mushrooms, onions, parsnips, peas, potatoes, tomatoes, turnips, vegetable marrow; and also with dried peas, beans, broad beans, lentils, and chestnuts. Of possible combinations there is no end, and the skill and taste of the cook must in practice find them out. Likewise taste can best teach which purees will do only for soups, and which for both soup and to serve with meat, or for the latter purpose only. In the case of artichokes, chestnuts, and mushrooms, the common form given above must be modified, as follows: Wheu the artichokes have been boiled, the tender part of the leaves and the bottoms should be separated from the rest, and alone passed through the sieve (in this case a wire sieve would be fatal).

Mushrooms should not be boiled at all, but should be cooked with butter and moistened with stock or broth, flavoured and floured before passing through the sieve. It is very strange that a people like the English, who set so much importance upon the natural flavour of their

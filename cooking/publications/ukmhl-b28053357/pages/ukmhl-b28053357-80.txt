Let the whole boil till the fish is done, not over- done.

Take out the fish and serve with the sauce over it, and sippets of bread fried in butter round it. 2. Matelotte d’Anguilles.—Take a couple or more eels, cut them up into pieces two inches long.

Melt a good-sized piece of butter in a saucepan, stir into it a tablespoonful of flour, then add the sauce ; let it boil, pour it over the fish, and serve with sippets as the above.

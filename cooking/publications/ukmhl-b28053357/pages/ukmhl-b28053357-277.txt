265 SIMPLE SWEETS. ready, it sliould be put, tin and all, into what is called a souffle case, just as flower pots are slipped into elegant vases to be placed on the dining table. Another point to be borne in mind is that the moment a souffle is done, and has attained, so to speak, its bloom or fulness, it must be served; for when once a souffle ceases to go up it begins to go down, either in or out of the oven. In fact, like time and tide, sotiffles wait for no man: to be sure of success the cook must be well acquainted with the habits of her company, so as to be able to judge the time of putting the souffle into the oven. For this reason a souffle is not a safe dish to have for a dinner party. The best of cooks will at times fail in a souffle, for no particular reason or fault of their own. My plan is always to have another dish in readiness to take the place of the souffle, should it prove a failure. Some kinds of souffles, however, can stand a little wait- ing better than others, which must not wait at all. A Fondue—which is nothing else but a savoury souffle—a rice or a potato souffle, may be kept waiting a minute or two ; but to an omelette soufflee or a coffee souffle for example, waiting is fatal. The liability of a souffle to fall can always be lessened by increasing the proportion of flour used in making it; but this is done at the expense of the delicacy of the dish, and indeed some souffles should contain no flour at all. I will now proceed to explain how the different kinds of souffles are compounded, and describe the simplest one, which only differs from a batter pudding in the manipula- tion of the ingredients, and the absence of that eminently British institution, the currants. Mix together in a saucepan one tablespoonful of flour, a small piece of fresh butter, half a pint of milk, and some powdered lump sugar to taste. Stir this on the fire

246 ROUND THE TABLE. Eggs neatly fried as above, and daintily placed on a slice of well-broiled bam or bacon are perhaps an im- provement on the poached eggs usually served in this way, and afe certainly preferable to eggs which have been fried with the bacon. Fried eggs laid on a slice of buttered toast, covered with a little anchovy paste, are an appetizing dish. When more than two eggs are to be served at one time, and especially if they are to be served over a 'puree or sauce, it is best to fry them one by one, and to trim the white round each egg : this adds to the appearance of the dish. All the above can be cooked just as well in a metal dish on the hot plate, and served on it, or they may be cooked in the oven. When you have got your cook to dress and send up fried eggs decently, then you may advance her to the next stage, which is scrambled eggs (CEurs Beouilles). The proceeding is this: Having melted a piece of butter in a saute-pan, or in an omelet-pan, break into it the eggs, and stir them up with a spoon on one side of it until nearly set, then turn them out neatly into a dish and serve. A small quantity of tomato sauce may be scrambled in the pan with them, or some finely minced shallots, ham, sausage (Bologna), remains of fish (Such as salmon), or sardines, anchovies, preserved tunny, mushrooms, truffles, &c., always finely minced; also asparagus points, young peas, &c. One thing to be remembered is not to put in too much of these things, and to put them in at the same time as the eggs, so that they may be set in with them. But the great point to be observed is not to overcook scrambled eggs in any form, and to this end it must be borne in mind that eggs do not cease cooking, and consequently hardening, for some minutes after they have

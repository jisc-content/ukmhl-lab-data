ON SOME ANCIENT AND MODERN SOUPS. 35 carrots, turnips, potatoes, parsnips, leeks, onions, celery, &c. When thoroughly clone, pass the whole through a fine hair sieve. Mix in a saucepan a piece of butter and a little flour, then add a little of the puree, and when this is well mixed add the rest. Finish by stirring in (off the fire) the yolks of a couple of eggs, strained and beaten up with a little milk. This is a very good way of using the trimmings of vegetables, cut with fancy cutters. The vegetables used to make vegetable stock should always be utilised by the thrifty in making this soup. Potage a la Creme d’Orge.—Boil half a pint of pearl barley in a quart of white meat or vegetable stock till it is reduced to a pulp, pass it through a hair sieve, and add to it as much white stock (meat or vegetable) as will bring the soup to the consistency of cream. Put the soup on the fire, and when it has come to boiling point stir into it (off the fire) the yolks of two eggs, beaten up with a gill of cream ; add half a pat of fresh butter, and serve. A homely but no bad soup withal is what is termed Potage au Pauvre Homme.—Put an ounce of butter into a saucepan, -with three large onions, shred fine, and fry them a pale brown colour, add half a table- spoonful of flour, stir for a few minutes, but do not allow the mixture to darken, then add one quart of stock, stir until the soup boils, and season it to taste with powdered pepper and salt. Peel one or two potatoes, cut them into small dice, and put them to boil with the soup. Cut some crust of stale bread in long pieces, the size and half the length of French beans, dry them in the oven, and, at the time of serving, throw them into the soup; then stir into it (off the fire) the yolks of two eggs, beaten up with a little milk and strained.

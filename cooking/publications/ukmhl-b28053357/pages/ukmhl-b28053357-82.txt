ROUND TEE TABLE. 70 percli, &c., the greater the variety the better, say in all about 41b. or 51b. weight, a couple of dozen mussels, three or four onions sliced, the same number of tomatoes peeled, emptied of their seeds, and cut up in quarters (or dried tomatoes), a slice or two of lemon, from which remove the skin, a small bag containing plenty of whole pepper, a few cloves, a laurel leaf, a clove of garlic, a piece of lemon or orange rind, a pinch of saffron, and half a chili or capsicum pod. Put the whole into a saucepan, and add to it some fine salad oil, some light white wine, and some water, in the following proportions : one part oil, one of wine, and three of water, salt to taste, and on the point of serving throw in a handful of minced parsley.

A slice of salmon, or a red mullet, which has lain in the above pickle three or four hours, and is then inclosed in

BOUND THE TABLE. 16 A servant wlio knows tke familiar friends of the master and all their peculiarities and fancies connected with the dinner table, is an invaluable treasure which cannot be too highly appreciated. Those who wish to do their duty by the friends they ask to dinner ought to spare no pains to secure and train up such a servant; and, degenerate as some people may think the present breed of domestics, there are yet as good fish in the sea as ever came out of it. Servants will take an interest in their work, if they see the master and mistress do the same instead of expecting them to do exactly as they wish by mere intuition. Let employers consider the number of good qualities which are requisite to make even a tolerable servant, and let them be very thankful that there are not more bad ones, nay, that there are any good ones at all. As much care is necessary in selecting and assorting guests as is requisite for arranging the dinner they are asked to eat; but, although this is entirely a matter of taste and feeling, I cannot help pointing out that people of an argumentative turn of mind, people who will “ argufy ” a propos de bottes if needs be, until they are black in the face, should never be asked to dinner. Arguing is all very well in its proper place and season, but at dinner it makes the best of sauces lose their taste, and turns the wines sour.

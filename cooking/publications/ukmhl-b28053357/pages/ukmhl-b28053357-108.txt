ROUND THE TABLE. 96 liquor, which presented the appearance of very excellent beef tea, into a saucepan with a couple of carrots, one onion, some celery, parsley, and sweet herbs, adding salt, pepper, and a few cloves. A couple of hoursâ€™ boiling produced, when the liquor was strained, as good a gravy soup in taste, colour, and clearness as any housewife need wish to put upon her table.

240 ROUND THE TABLE. sediment only will be found to remain at the bottom of the dish; keep changing the water and stirring till the sediment is quite free from any fibrous particles, when you may let it dry, to be collected when quite so, passed through a fine hair sieve, and bottled for use. It is best to do this in summer, when the dishes can be exposed to the sun. Heat, however, is only necessary towards the later stages of- the process, and that of the fire will do quite as well. A more expeditious way is to scrub the potatoes clean, and grate them on a sieve, pour plenty of water over them, receive it in a pan at the bottom of which in a short time the starch of the potato will be deposited. This fecule, mixed with cold water (a couple of table- spoonfuls to a pint) and a little sugar, and then stirred on the fire till it thickens, makes a delicious pap for infants, infinitely preferable to tapioca, arrowroot, &c., if I may trust to the recollections of my youthful days. Rice plainly boiled in water is often served on English tables, but not always is it well cooked, even in so simple a form. If properly dressed no two grains should stick together, and each grain should be just sufficiently cooked to assume a corkscrew or spiral appearance.

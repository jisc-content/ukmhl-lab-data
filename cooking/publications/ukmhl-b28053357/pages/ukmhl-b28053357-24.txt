12 BOUND THE TABLE. If game and poultry do not figure in the menu, one of the pieces cle resistance should be a roast, and the entremets cle legumes should be served with it, or they may form part of the second service. In this also, in the demi-Russe fashion, the two principal dishes are put upon the table and the rest handed round. Of entremets sucres there should be at least four, two hot and two cold, and one or both of these latter should be iced. Then comes the cheese question. I cannot but think it a most incongruous proceeding for people, after having eaten sweets of various kinds—may be an ice pudding— to discuss a piece of ripe Stilton or strong double Glouces- ter. Cheese, I hold, should be eaten before the entremets sucres or sweets, and then it should be eaten in the form of rameqwins or a fondue ; or, if you will have cheese au naturel, have some Parmesan, Brie, Gruyere, cream- cheese, &c. I mean no disparagement to Stilton, Gloucester, Cheddar, &c., but they are not after-dinner cheeses, and the mode of serving some of them which certain people affect—viz., putting half a cheese of ever so many pounds weight on the table, is as ridiculous as it is offensive. The cheese should not be put upon the table- at all, but should be handed round, cut in very thin shoes, if it is Parmesan or Gruyere.

Putting a lump of ice in a wine- glass may help to disguise bad sherry, but it is always an objectionable practice. A variety of wines is no doubt desirable in a good

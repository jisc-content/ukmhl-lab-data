SIMPLE SWEETS. 259 serving place the dish in the oven for a few minutes, pass a red-hot salamander over the croutons, and send them up to table. A very pleasant combination of flavours is obtained by using apple-jam to spread over the croutons, and black currant-jelly for the sauce. When apricot-jam is used, a few almonds, finely minced and spread over the jam, are an improvement. Another form of this dish is the following: Use shoes of sponge-cake instead of croutons, but cut thicker, and let the sauce be a well-flavoured custard. This makes a cold dish, and if each piece of sponge-cake is dipped in sherry after the jam is put over it, that operation will add considerably to its merit. In all cases the great thing to be avoided is the using of too much jam, and more particularly with sponge-cake. A sponge-cake, well soaked in sherry, stuck all over with almonds, and covered with cream, sweetened and whipped to a froth, is a common dish enough. There are, however, numerous modifications of this simple dish, which are quite as simple, although possessed of a good deal of merit. In the first place, some of the cream can be coloured with cochineal, spinach greening, caramel, &c., and you can thereby produce a parti-coloured dish, which will be more effective than one entirely white. Then the cream can be both coloured and flavoured with a variety of thingsâ€”viz.: 1. Coffee; this is done by making a very strong infusion of coffee, and adding some of it to the cream after it is whipped. 2. Chocolate ; dissolve a sufficient quantity in hot water, strain it, and when cold add to the whipped cream. 3. The juice of any kind of fruit, such as raspberries, currants, strawberries, &c., can be added to the cream, always after whipping. s 2

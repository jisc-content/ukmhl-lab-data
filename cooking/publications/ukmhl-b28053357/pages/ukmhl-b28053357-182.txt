170 ROUND THE TABLE. The following is an artistic way of dressing cabbages. Parboil them, just enough to make the leaves limp; which you separate and dry lightly with a cloth. Then take either sausage meat, or any forcemeat (farce) made with remains of cold meat, &c., nicely flavoured; place a tablespoonful of this upon a cabbage leaf, roll it up to the shape of a sausage, add three or four more leaves round it, and tie it up with thread. Having made a sufficient number of these rolls, line a saucepan at the bottom with bacon, lay your rolls upon this, and let the whole simmer on the fire a couple of hours, adding a small quantity of broth or stock, condi- ments according to taste, and salt if necessary. At the time of serving remove the threads and dispose the rolls on a dish. Strain the sauce. Remove the excess of fat. Thicken it with some butter and flour, and pour it over the dish. Instead of making a number of rolls, as above, the cabbage can be dressed whole. When parboiled make a crucial incision on the top of it, open the leaves lightly, insert the meat between them, and tie up the cabbage with thread so as to preserve its shape. In this case, however, the parboiling and final cooking will take a longer time. Brussels sprouts can be cooked in the same way as described for cabbages in No. 4; here are various other modes of preparing them : 1.

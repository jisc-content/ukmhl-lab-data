5 TABLE TALK. only, but no other eatables than those under discussion. I question the pleasure of eating salmon with a dish of candied fruit staring you in the face. Then, the cloth is not removed for dessert; and no dessert can look so well as one which is put on a well-kept mahogany table, in which it is reflected almost as a landscape on a calm rivei’—the white tablecloth is too cold looking, and the operation of shaving it with a silver trowel, to re- move stray bits of bread which have not been kept off by the side cloths or slips, is absurd.

Delicate fruit, such as grapes, strawberries, &c., cannot stand being exposed to the heat of the dining-room and the fumes of soups, fish, entrees, and roast meats, without being materially dete- riorated. The temperature of the dining-room is one of the most important things to be attended to.

90 ROUND THE TABLE. BOILING MEAT. This is one of the simplest and most economical modes of preparing food. Meat loses less weight in boding than in any other process of cooking, and the water it boiled in can always be turned to good account; besides which, although it may be an open question whether boiled meat is more nutritious than roast or broded meat, it is beyond dispute more wholesome and easily digested. Without entering upon the theorique of the chemical process which takes place in the operation of boding meat, I propose to dilate upon the practical part of the opera- tion, which naturady divides itself into three heads :â€” (1) When the object is to extract the juices of the meat, which is not itself to be used; (2) when both the broth and the meat are to be eaten; and (3) when the meat alone is to be served. The two first constitute the pro- cess of making stock, broth, or soup. Of this I have treated in another place, so I shall here confine myself to the last head, in which the mode of operation differs from that used in the making of soup iu the very material point that, whereas in the former the meat should be put to cook in cold water, and then heated gradually, in this the meat should not be put in until the water is hot; but yet, in neither case, should the meat ever be adowed to boil fast: what is called simmering is the thing. And here let me observe, once for all, that water cannot be heated beyond a certain temperature; and that therefore, when once the water boils, to increase the fire can only

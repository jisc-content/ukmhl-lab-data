103 MUTTON CUTLETS. 3. Mutton cutlets may also be stewed in a variety of ways, of wliicli the following may be taken as the common form: Put some butter in a stewpan, and place your cutlets in this, turning them over and over until they are well saisies (“ set ”) by the butter; then add a small quantity of well-flavoured stock or gravy, and let them simmer in this till done, when they should be served with the gravy, which you thicken if necessary with a little flour. Vegetables may be cooked with the cutlets, and served with them, or a garniture of vegetables, cooked separately, can be put in the midst. 4. Place your cutlets untrimmed into a saucepan over some slices of bacon, with some onions, carrots, sweet herbs, pepper, salt, and spices to taste, moisten with a very small quantity of stock or even of water, and let the cutlets braise gently till done. Then lay them out flat between two plates, with a weight over them, to remain till cold, when you proceed to trim them neatly without scraping down the bone, but cutting it off short. On the other hand strain the gravy they were braised in, and after removing all the fat, put it on one side. Mince equal quantities of shallots and mushrooms. Pry the shallots a light gold in butter, then add the mushrooms, pepper, salt, spices to taste, and minced parsley; moisten with a little of the gravy, add a squeeze of lemon, and put this mince by to get cold. Cut some paper, and oil it as mentioned above. Cover your cutlets on both sides with a thin coating of the mince, enclose them in their papers, and broil them just long enough to make them quite hot, or if more convenient, they may be made hot in the oven. The above is my version of the well-known dish said to be due to the inspiration of Mme. de Maintenon.

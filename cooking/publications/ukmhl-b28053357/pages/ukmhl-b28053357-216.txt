204 KOOND THE TABLE. Cut some truffles and mushrooms in moderately small slices; put them in a saucepan with a goodly piece of butter, and a little garlic finely minced; or, better still, rub the saucepan freely with garlic. When the butter is melted squeeze in the juice of one or two lemons. Leave your mushrooms and truffles for a little while in this; add pepper and salt in due proportion, and a little grated nutmeg; then put in a sufficient quantity of good Spanish sauce to make a nice ragout, which must simmer for about half an hour. Five minutes before serving add a glass or two of sherry, and you will have produced a noble dish.

Given three or four fowls’ livers, cut from the best pieces as many neat collops as you have cases to fill; mince finely the rest of the liver, add some shallots, parsley, and mushrooms or truffles, or both if you have them, all finely minced, then some sweet herbs, pepper, and salt.

When well reduced, strain the gravy and put it by; cut up the larks’ livers, as also some fowls’ livers, in small dice; do the same with half their quantity of bacon. Fry a few shallots in plenty of butter, theu put

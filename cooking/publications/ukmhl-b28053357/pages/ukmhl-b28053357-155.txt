143 TURKEY. I will describe tliese three modes of dressing a turkey. The first condition of all is, that the animal should be pro- perly trussed, and not impaled on a couple of wooden skewers. Then comes the consideration of the stuffing, the best form of which is without doubt that expensive luxury the truffle, and this is how Truffle Stuffing should be made. Take a pound of fat bacon, mince it fine, and put it into a saucepan with a couple of shallots, also minced fine; when the bacon begins to melt add at least 21b. of truffles, cut up in convenient pieces, pepper, salt, spices, and powdered sweet herbs (thyme and marjoram), to taste. Toss the mixture on the fire for about half an hour, then— before it has time to cool—fill the body of the turkey, sew it well up, and put the bird in the larder to remain a couple of days before it is cooked. Chestnut Stuffing I should prepare in this way: Having removed the outer skin of a number of chestnuts, put them to boil in salted water, with a handful of coriander seeds and some laurel leaves. When cooked (they must be rather underdone) drain them and remove the inner skin, which will come off easily. Sprinkle over them a due allowance of pepper, salt, and spices, and stuff the turkey, inserting while doing so about half a pound of butter cut up into small pieces—the finest beef suet or marrow may be used instead of butter. An onion chopped fine and mixed with the chestnuts, is to my mind, an improvement, but it is not to everybody's taste. Another way of preparing the chestnuts is to bake them just enough to allow the skin to be removed; then they are stewed with a little stock, some onions, carrots, sweet herbs, pepper, a bay leaf, and salt to taste, until they are quite soft. They may then either be put into the turkey alone, or with butter, &c., as above.

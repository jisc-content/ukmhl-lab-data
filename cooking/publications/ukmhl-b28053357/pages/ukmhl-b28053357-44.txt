32 ROUND THE TABLE. a quart or more, according to the quantity of soup you want. When thoroughly done, take out the fowls and let them and the stock get cold. Remove all the white flesh from the fowls, and pound it in a mortar with half its quantity of bread crumbs soaked in the stock (from which all fat has been previously removed) ; then add the rest of the stock, pass the puree through a fine hair sieve or tammy, and put it by till wanted. Just before serving pound-in a mortar a couple of dozen sweet almonds with half a pint of cream. Squeeze this in a cloth, and into the juice thus obtained beat up a couple of yolks of egg, previously strained. Let your puree come to the boil, but mind you do not let it boil; take it off the fire, and stir into it the mixture of almond juice, cream, and eggs, and serve at once over sippets of bread, fried in butter and cut in the shape of small dice. Or, you may instead put into the soup some peas, or some carrots or cucumbers cut into the shape of peas, and previously cooked in stock. Or again, you may put into your soup some very diminutive quenelles of fowls. A less expensive way of making this soup is the following; and, with proper care and judicious flavouring, the result will leave nothing to be desired: Remove the flesh from the remains of a couple of roast or boiled fowls, taking care to exclude all the skin; add half the quantity of bread crumbs, soaked in stock free from grease, and pound thoroughly in a mortar; season â– with pepper, salt, and a little nutmeg; pass through a hair sieve, add as much stock as you want soup, and you have your puree of fowls, which at the time of serving you make warm without letting it boil, and stir into it the yolks of a couple of eggs strained and beaten up with half a glass of cream or milk. Serve with sippets, or peas, Ac., as stated above.

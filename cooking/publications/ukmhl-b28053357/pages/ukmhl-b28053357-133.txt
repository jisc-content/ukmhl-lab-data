STEAKS, AND A PIE, 121 STEAKS, AND A PIE. In private houses, a well-cooked beefsteak is a never- attained luxury; it is only at some chop-houses in the City that such a thing is procurable, but there, not only is it beyond the reach of ladies, but you are compelled to eat it in a crowd and bustle, sufficient of themselves to take away the enjoyment of the choicest efforts of the culinary art. The great secret of cooking a steak consists in making a roaring fire, and then adding some coke to it: when this is red-hot you have a clear smokeless fire on which to cook your steak. You should cook it on the fire, and not in front of it, otherwise it is only a toasted bit of meat, instead of a broiled steak. How long you are to leave a steak on the fire is so entirely a ques- tion of judgment as well as a matter of taste, that it is impossible to give any rule about it. You should turn your steak as soon as it has been on the fire a few minutes, and keep turning it till it is done. This process prevents the formation of a hard rind of overdone meat. For a steak to be well cooked it ought to be equally done throughout its thickness, but not by any means overdone, and consequently dry. There are people, however, who abominate a juicy steak, and will have their meat in any form thoroughly done, or rather overdone, not to say utterly spoilt; but Non ragioniam di lor, ma guarda, o passa. Sprinkle the steak freely with salt when serving, not before; and, being done, shall it be sent up au naturelâ€”

BATTER. 89 them a little butter melted and enough yolks of eggs or whole eggs to form a stiflish paste ; season with salt, pepper and a little nutmeg ; form into the shape of little balls, dip in batter and fry. This may be varied by adding a little cream, or some ham or Bologna sausage finely minced, and some chopped parsley. 2. Put into a saucepan about a pint of boiling water and loz. of butter ; drop into this gradually with the hand some Indian corn flour, stirring all the time until you get a liquid paste. Take care not to put too much flour, and to put it in gradually, else it will form into knots and spoil the dish. Removing the saucepan from the fire, you stir into the paste a good allowance of grated Parmesan cheese, and a little salt and pepper, and then pour out your paste on a marble slab to cool. When cold, cut it out in any shape you like and fry. The addition of ham or sausage can also be made to this. 3. Make the paste as above, only with common corn flour; when half cold stir into it some yolks of eggs, and flavour it with pepper, salt, and nutmeg; add chopped parsley and minced ham; then treat as the others. 4. Put about a pint of water into a saucepan with a piece of butter the size of an egg, the least bit of cayenne and plenty of black pepper. When the water boils throw gradually into it sufficient flour to form a thick paste, then take it off the fire and work into it about |lb. of grated Parmesan cheese, and then the yolks of three or four eggs and the whites of two beaten up to a froth. Let the paste rest for a couple of hours, and proceed to fry by dropping pieces of it the size of a walnut into plenty of hot lard. Serve sprinkled with very fine salt. The first three of these pastes may also be fried with- out being previously dipped in batter, but it is more difficult to so fry them creditably.

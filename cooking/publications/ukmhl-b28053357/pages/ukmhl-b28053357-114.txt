BOUND THE TABLE. 102 turnips, sorrel, lentils, peas, beans, &c. ■ also with com- binations of vegetables (not in the puree form) and some of the above-named sauces • or with the garnitures called a jardiniere, a macedoine, &c. In short, there is no end to the variations of which a dish of mutton cutlets is suscep- tible, and I will now describe some ways of dressing them still more artistically. 1. The cutlets being trimmed sec. art., they are dipped in egg and then turned over in a mixture of ham and truffles very finely minced. After a lapse of a quarter of an hour they are dipped in egg again, and then bread-crumbed with chapelure. After that cut some pieces of white paper into the shape of a heart, and large enough when folded in two to enclose each cutlet. Oil each piece of paper with butter or fine salad oil (the latter is best), place a cutlet in each and bend up the edges securely. Broil them on the gridiron till done, and serve in the paper. The above formula is varied by dipping the cutlets in batter instead of cliapelure, and frying them instead of broiling them in paper. 2. Make a marinade, with equal parts of oil and vinegar, slices of onion, whole pepper, salt, some spices, and sweet herbs, all in due proportions. Lay your cutlets, ready trimmed, in this pickle, which should cover them. When they have lain in it four or five hours, dip them in butter, melted for the purpose, and proceed to broil them in front of the fire, basting plentifully with butter. To be served with a sauce piguante. A few mushroom or truffle trimmings, or both, are an improvement to the pickle. Some cooks pretend to give mutton the taste of venison by putting into a pickle, somewhat similar to the above, a handful of juniper berries.

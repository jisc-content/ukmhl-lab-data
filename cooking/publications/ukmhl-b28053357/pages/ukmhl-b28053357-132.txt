ROUND THE TABLE. 120 and salt. Put a layer of stuffing in each, case, with one fillet of sole, and a few minced mushrooms; fill up with the sauce mentioned above, and bake for fifteen or twenty minutes with a sheet of paper over the cases. Instead of, or in addition to, the minced mushrooms, one or two whole button mushrooms can be put on each case; and for the sake of variety the sauce may be made brown by the addition of a little sue colorant. I may mention that calfâ€™s liver may be used to make the liver stuffing. These paper cases are used also for what are called savoury dishes, being filled with ramequin paste or hard-boiled eggs, chopped up fine with ancho- vies, a little Parmesan cheese, bread crumbs, and butter, or with many other varieties of similar preparations. When so used the cases should be rather smaller than when they are to contain meat, fish, &c. These entrees in cases, if properly composed and dressed, have a very neat appearance; they are very good to eat, and last, but not least, they are anything but expensive.

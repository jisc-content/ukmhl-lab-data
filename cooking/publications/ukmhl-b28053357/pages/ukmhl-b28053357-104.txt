ROOND THE TABLE. 92 you will, a piece of salted beef is never so tender as a piece of fresh beef. The same principles apply to boil- ing all kinds of meats and poultry. In the case of the latter, and of such joints as it is desirable to get quite white when boiled, washing and even soaking in cold or luke- warm water before they are put to boil is resorted to, and the water in which they are put to boil should be boiling hot. The' washing and soaking take away some of the nourishment of the things so treated, but usefulness must sometimes be sacrificed to appearance. In order to pre- serve the whiteness of fowls in the process of boiling, various methods are suggested. Some cookery books recommend a slice of stale bread being put in the water; others that the fowls should be tied up in a floured cloth, or in a cloth without flour, or inclosed in a tin made for the purpose, and this plunged into boiliug water, which latter process I should call steaming, not boiling. To preserve the whiteness of a fowl or turkey that is to be boiled, the one essential point is to wash it well in tepid water with a lemon squeezed in it, to rub it all over with a lemon cut in half, and then to put it to boil. When all the scum that may rise is removed, a round of buttered paper should be placed over the pot, and the lid put on close. Poultry cannot boil too slowly. Onions, sweet herbs, and whole pepper, as well as salt, should always be put in the saucepan with any kind of poultry. An old French way of boiling a fowl is to parboil it first, then to pack it up in slices of fat bacon tied on with a string, and then to put it in boiling water with vege- tables, &c., to finish cooking. To use instead of water either stock or the liquor in which a joint of meat has been boiled, provided it is strained and freed from fat, can but be an improvement to boiled poultry. This is one of the uses to which the liquor meat has been boiled

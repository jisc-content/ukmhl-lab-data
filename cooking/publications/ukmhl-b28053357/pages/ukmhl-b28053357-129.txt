117 ON PAPER CASES. either square or round, of about an inch and a half square, or the same in diameter, and an inch high. The square cases anyone knows how to make. The round, which look decidedly the best, may be bought for Is. a dozen if you go to the proper shop, that is, a stationerâ€™s; for grocers and confectioners will demand Is. 6d., or even 2s. for them. The cheapest way, however, is to make them at home. It will not be easy at first, but with a little practice the art of making these things creditably will soon be acquired. The tools required are a small round tin mould, without bottom, of the size of the case you wish to make, and a round piece of wood, with a handle to it, fitting into the tin. Take some white foolscap paper of moderate thickness, place a piece, sufficiently large to allow for the sides, on the tin, and press it so as to get a round impres- sion on it; then with the back of a table knife, and in alternate ways, mark out folds, at equal distances and radiating from the round impression, on that part of the paper which will form the sides ; then put the paper on the tin, press down the wooden form, and the paper will readily adapt itself to the shape by taking the folds you have marked out. You now trim the top, leaving enough to bend back to form a ridge, whereby the case is pre- vented from coming open. Having done this, withdraw the piece of wood, and push out the case from the other side. An intelligent servant will soon learn how to make these cases, and, indeed, the manufacture of them is not beneath the attention of young ladies. It does not require more talent than many kinds of fancy work, costs less, and is perhaps more useful. Before they are used the cases should be oiled through- out with fine salad oil, and put into the oven for a quarter of an hour. This is an important point, as those who neglect it will find out.

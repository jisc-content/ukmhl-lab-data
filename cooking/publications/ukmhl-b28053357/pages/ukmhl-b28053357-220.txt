208 ROUND THE TABLE. some chervil, parsley, and a few chives finely minced. Pour this over the beans, turn them over quickly, and serve. Of course this formula is only one of many, and the composition of the sauce can be varied ad lib. In this form the beans may be eaten either hot or cold. Haricot beans, as wells as lentils, peas, or broad beans, can be made into pi trees to be used as a garnish for poultry, a dish of cutlets, or a piece of stewed meat. When it is to be so used, the puree should be thicker than when it is intended for a soup; it should be, in fact, of the consistency of the well-known pease pudding. A common formula to make such a puree is the following : Set the pulse to boil, putting into the saucepan with it some whole pepper, a few cloves, an onion, a head of celery, and some parsley; when quite done, add salt, and pass it through a hair sieve; then work into the puree a certain quantity of butter. If intended for soup, the puree should be diluted with either meat stock or vegetable stock, according as it is wished to have a soup au gras or au maigre ; and the puree should be finished by the addi- tion (off the fire) of the yolks of one or more eggs beaten with some milk or cream, or simply a little water. I shall conclude this paper with a few dishes, the foun- dation of which is dried vegetables of various kinds; and, although they are but the bill of fare of Continental peasants, I can assert that—if the great condiment of good appetite be added to them—they can be relished even by ladies and gentlemen. 1. Boil a quantity of haricot beans, lentils, or Spanish peas; when half done strain off the water, and replace it with fresh boiling water, but in lesser quantity ; add one or two onions stuck with cloves, a good-sized piece of bacon, some powdered black pepper, and a little salt to .taste. Let the whole boil till the bacon is cooked.

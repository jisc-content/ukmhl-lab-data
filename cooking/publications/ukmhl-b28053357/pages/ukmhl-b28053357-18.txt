ROUND THE TABLE. 6 fire is out of place : it is a cheerful thing to behold in a sitting-room, but at dinner people have more cheerful things to look at. The best way for those who do not mind the expense, is to have the dining-room warmed with hot-water pipes; and while they are about it, they should have ventilators so placed as to carry away the vitiated air, and keep the room, as much as possible, at the same temperature. At a certain season of the year, it is impossible in this country, not to dine by daylight; unless at the excessively late hour affected by ultra- fashionables. This is a great misfortune, for a dinner- table never looks so well as by candlelight; and it is therefore better, so long as the dinner cannot be con- cluded by daylight, to close the shutters and light np the dining-room beforehand, instead of doing so in the middle of dinner. The very best way of lighting a dining-room is to have the apparatus called a sunlight fitted in the ceiling, and this has also the advantage of being a most efficient ventilator. In any other form—ventilate how you will—gas is very unpleasant in a room. If the sunlight is not practicable, the next best thing is a chandelier, so constructed as to hold three or four moderator lamps ; or a chandelier with wax candles may be used; but on no account should any lamp or candles be put upon the dinner-table itself. If you have hand- some plate, or if the size of the room requires more light, candles or lamps may be placed upon the side- board. Some people object to moderator lamps as being liable to get out of order, and “ come to grief” in various ways at inconvenient times; but these shortcomings are not, in the majority of cases, the fault of the lamp. The management of these lamps—of all things—is one of the most difficult to get servants to attend to carefully.

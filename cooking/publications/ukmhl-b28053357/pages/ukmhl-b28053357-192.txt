180 ROUND THE TABLE. Melt a piece of butter in a saucepan, and in it place your peas raw, with some onioD, lettuce, mint or parsley or both tied up in a bundle, pepper, salt, and the least bit of nutmeg (grated). Keep tossing the peas till quite done, when remove the bundle and add a small pat of butter; then serve. The yolk of one egg or more, accord- ing to the quantity of peas, beaten up with a little water and stirred into them just before serving, is an improve- ment, and so is a small quantity of sugar. Another form, which is adapted for peas of all ages, consists in chopping some fat bacon very fine, with either onion or shallot in a small quantity and a little parsley.

Suppress the bundle and serve. Ham may be used instead of fat bacon, but in that case a little butter should be added. Savory (,sariette) is a good herb to use with peas instead of mint or parsley. The following is the most artistic way of preparing young peas, and what, in England would be called the “ richest.” Put the peas to cook in butter with a bundle as de- scribed above, pepper, salt, &c.; when they are done beat up some cream with a little sugar and the yolk of an egg.

Heads of asparagus cut up in small pieces as if to put into soup, can be dressed in the same way as peas. In its proper season, however, there is but one way of eating asparagus, and that is plainly boiled. The proper way to prepare asparagus is to scrape each head with the back of a knife, then to tie it in small

The following is the recipe: Pass half-a-dozen boiled potatoes through a sieve ; work into them, in a bowl, one gill of cream, and the yolks of three eggs; add pepper, salt and nutmeg to taste, and some parsley chopped fine. When they are well mixed and smooth, take them up by tablespoonfuls, roll each into a ball, flatten it and flour it slightly; lay them all in a saute - pan with plenty of butter melted. Cook them slowly. Turn them over when one side is coloured and serve hot when both sides are done. I also have the following recipe from an English friend : Potatoes a la Paidit : Take a large and rather over- boiled Spanish onion and beat it, hot, with from three to four times its bulk of boiled potato, also hot, a little salt, a little butter, and a good quantity of black pepper â€”through a fine sieve. Roll into balls, and brown them quickly in butter. With some dishes fried potatoes are de rigueur. To fry them well you must attend to the following points : Use plenty of fat: Wait till the fat is very hot before you throw them in: Let them be thoroughly dry, for, if at all damp, they will never be properly crisp. When they have got a fine golden tinge, take them out and lay them on a piece of blotting paper before the fire, giving them a good sprinkling of salt. Do not attempt to fry boiled potatoes; they must be raw, and you can cut them either in slices the thickness of a shilling, or in pieces about the size of a French bean and the length of the potato.

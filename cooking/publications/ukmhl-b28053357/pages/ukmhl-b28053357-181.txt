VEGETABLES. 169 do not soak it in vinegar and water, but in water alone and salt. Take an equal quantity of apples and onions, botli minced fine, say for one cabbage a handful of each. Put them and the parboiled cabbage into a saucepan with a piece of butter, pepper, and salt quantum sufficit, and some parsley and sweet herbs tied up in a bundle, but judiciously proportioned. Let the whole simmer very gently for some hours, the longer the better. Then remove the bundle and throw in—at the time of serving— a gill of claret, in which you have dissolved a tablespoonful of sugar. A small pat of butter is then added, and your dish is ready for table. There is yet another way of dressing very young cabbages, which is not to be despised. 4. Proceed as if you were going to dress your cabbage a VAnc/laise. When it is half-done drain it, and squeeze it dry if you like. Melt a piece of butter in a saucepan, add some flour to it, salt, pepper, some grated nutmeg or powdered mace, and enough cream to make a thick sauce. Place your pieces or quarters of cabbage in this to finish their cooking, and serve with the sauce over. 5. Take some savoys, cut them up small, and parboil them, as in recipe No. 2 ; take an equal quantity of parboiled rice ■, put the two together into a saucepan full of plain broth or stock; set it to simmer till both rice and cabbage are thoroughly done; then serve. There should not be too much broth, for it is a soup to eat not to drink. Grated Parmesan cheese should be handed round with it. This is a very wholesome and nourishing dish, and as the cheese is not imperative it would be a great boon to some of our poor folks if they could be induced to try it. A piece of bacon, an onion, and some parsley would make an economical broth for this dish.

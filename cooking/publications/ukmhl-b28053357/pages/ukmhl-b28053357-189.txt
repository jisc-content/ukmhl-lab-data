Incorporate with a piece of butter some parsley, garden cress, and chervil very finely minced, together with some pepper and a very little grated nutmeg; put the beans on a very hot dish, and the lump of butter thus prepared in their midst; the least bit of chives, chopped very small, may be added to the butter, and the cress or chervil, or both, may be omitted. 2. Make a sauce with butter, flour, water, salt, pepper, and nutmeg. The beans, which ought to have been thrown into a basin of cold water when a little more than half done, are well drained and put into this sauce to finish cooking. At the time of serving, the yolks of one or two eggs, with the juice of a lemon, are added. 3. A small quantity of fat bacon and a little shallot are chopped very fine and put into a saucepan; the beans, treated as in No. 2, are put in when the bacon is melted, and tossed in it till they are quite done. Pepper and other condiments to be added ad lib., and a few drops of vinegar are not amiss. 4. One or two onions are sliced very thin, and put into a saucepan with plenty of butter; when they begin to take colour, put in the beans, first treated as in No. 2 and then proceed as in No. 3. Previous boiling is by no means imperative in the last two formulae, and I am not quite certain that a better dish is not produced if the beans are put raw into the bacon or into the butter and onions. Of course they will require a longer time to cook in this way. Beans and runners are also very good if prepared as in No. 2, only with other sauces, such as tomato sauce or N

BOILING MEAT. 93 in can be put; but the chief use of it—and if it have been used to boil a fowl all the better—should be to make stock proper, by being* boiled with all the odds and ends of meat and poultry which are at hand, and a proper addition of vegetables and spices. Again, there are more elaborate forms of boiling poultry, calves’ head, &c., such as what is called a blanc; but these would come more properly under the head of braising. Although the same principles apply to the boiling of hams as to thatof joints, it is very essential that hams should be soaked in water for from twenty-four to forty-eight hours, and that the water should be changed two or three times; then they should be washed, and scraped, and scrubbed perfectly clean, and, being properly trimmed, they should be laid in a boiler filled with cold water, with the addition of carrots, celery, onions, garlic, parsley, thyme, marjoram, bay leaves, cloves, and mace—the proportions of which things must be regulated by the size of the ham, and the skill or taste of the cook. Many other things are put in by those who like them—coriander seeds, juniper berries, a small wisp of hay, and even leather shavings, which latter, in the words of an ancient autho- rity, are supposed to give the ham a high flavour. Some put in a small handful of saltpetre, to give the flesh a good colour. If the ham is a good one, the colour will be good without the addition of saltpetre, neither is it necessary to tie up a ham in a cloth; but what is un- doubtedly an improvement to a boiled ham is the addition of a bottle of sherry to the water it is boiled in. Great attention must be paid to the removal of the scum, and the temperature of the water should never be allowed to rise above simmering. An ordinary sized ham will take from four to five hours to cook. When it is done, it should be allowed to remain in the liquor until it is nearly

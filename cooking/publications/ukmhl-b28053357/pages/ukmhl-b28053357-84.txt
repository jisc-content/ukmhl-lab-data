ROUND THE TABLE. 72 FRYING. Some twenty years ago, in a street where I lived in an Italian town, was a wine-sliop, at the door of which stood a man who got his living by vending various kinds of vegetables and sundry preparations of flour fried in oil or lard. The operation of frying was conducted on the spot in the open air. The trade was brisk at all times, and this frying man was a great ally of the wine- shop, for his wares, being plentifully sprinkled with salt, helped to draw custom. But it was not to all of his customers that he was so bountiful of that condiment; for if any of the neighbouring gentry sent to him for a dish of frittura, as many often did, he would produce a piatto, of which any cook might have been proud. In Italy ton piatto di frittura—a dish of fried things— seldom fails to appear at most tables. The things are almost too numerous to mention; leaves and sprigs of borage, flowers of vegetable marrow, flowers of acacia, sliced vegetable marrow, potatoes, celery, artichokes, &c., &c.; then some small fish, like whitebait, called fmvaglie, and molluscs of various kinds, purpe (a species of octopus) and several varieties of calamari (a sort of sepia); but the latter are among the best. All these are either floured or dipped in batter before frying, and with the batter itself (pastetta) many oddly-shaped morsels are prepared, with or without the addition of Indian corn flour, semolina, &c.

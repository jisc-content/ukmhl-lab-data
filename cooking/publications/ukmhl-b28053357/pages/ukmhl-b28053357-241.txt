SALADS. 229 the reserved pieces of lobster on the top, and ornament ■with minced white and yolk of eggs, truffles, and aspic jelly, in any design you may fancy. The following is one of my formulae for what is called a Russian salad, susceptible, like similar preparations, of endless variations. Sat,add Russe.—Cut, with a vegetable scoop, some pieces of carrots and of turnips, to the size of an olive; boil them in salted water, with a piece of butter, but do not let them be overdone; lay them out on a sieve to drain and get cold : cut some beetroot in the same way, and like- wise some truffles. Take equal parts—say a cupful—of each of the above, a similar quantity of preserved fresh (not dried) haricot beans ready cooked, and of asparagus points preserved in the same way. Take also two table spoonfuls respectively of capers, of French pickled gherkins (which you cut into the shape of capers), and of anchovies perfectly cleaned and cut into small pieces; a couple of dozen or more of olives (stoned), one table- spoonful of tarragon and chervil minced fine, and half that quantity of chives also minced. Mix all the above in a rich salad sauce. Dress within a plain border of aspic, and ornament with hard boiled eggs, caviar, lobster spawn, olives, pickles, truffles, &c. The Spanish pre- served sweet capsicums (Pimientos dulces) are a great addition to a salad like this, not only for their exquisite taste, but on account of their brilliant colour.

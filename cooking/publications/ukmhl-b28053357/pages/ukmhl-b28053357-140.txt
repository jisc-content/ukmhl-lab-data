Taking the fowl in one hand (Fig. 3), you now proceed to 12S ROUND THE TABLE. in the nature of a packing needle, you pass a piece of white packthread through and through both thighs under the knee; then you carry it along the second joint of one pinion and through the middle of the third joint, then Fig. 2. through the back under the bone, taking a stitch on the way in the flap, which you haye laid flat on the fowl's back (Fig. 2); then you go through the middle of the third joint of the other pinion, and along the second joint. You now tie the two ends of the string tightly, leaving a piece whereby (when the fowl is done) you can, having cut the knot, pull out the whole string. You must now slightly nick with a knife the tendons of the legs, just above the ankle in front and behind; the object of this being to prevent the feet from sticking up when the fowl is roasted. Some cut off the feet alto- gether at the ankle joint, and I am not sure that I do not prefer this mode of treatment, but this is a matter of taste.

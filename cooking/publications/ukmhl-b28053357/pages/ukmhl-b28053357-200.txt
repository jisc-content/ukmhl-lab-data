188 HOUND THE TABLE. gratin, and this has the advantage that it may be applied to the remains of cauliflowers served at the dinner of the day before. This is the simplest form of it: Dispose the pieces of cauliflowers on a dish, pour a good supply of liquefied butter over them, and plenty of grated Parmesan cheese, with a judicious admixture of powdered white pepper, salt, and nutmeg. Put the dish into the oven for a few minutes, or brown with a red-hot salamander, and then serve. Here are other modes of proceeding: Rub the dish very slightly with garlic or shallot, mould your cauli- flowers in a basin, and pour over them—before turning them out—some melted butter, into which you have dissolved a good allowance of Parmesan cheese; turn them out on the dish, strew plentifully with grated Par- mesan, a few baked bread crumbs, pepper and salt quant, sujf., pouring the remainder of the sauce over; brown and serve. Instead of moulding the cauliflowers : dip each piece in the sauce and dispose them flat on the dish, filling up the interstices with bread crumbs and Parmesan cheese in equal parts; add pepper and salt according to taste; brown, and serve. The great thing to be avoided is not to make these preparations too dry, and yet there should not be over much butter. The browning must be carefully done, so as to produce a surface of a uniform golden colour— not in patches, some burnt black, and others not browned at all. To those who may object to cheese, I can recommend the following recipe, which has great merit of its own: Dispose your pieces of boiled cauliflower upon a dish well rubbed with garlic; over them strew a mixture of bread crumbs and anchovies, capers and olives minced fine.

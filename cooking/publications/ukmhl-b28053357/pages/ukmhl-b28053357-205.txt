I have grated Parmesan cheese served with this soup, for those who like it. It is an improvement, if it is possible to improve one of the simplest and most agreeable combinations in the way of soupe maigre that ever was invented. The larger onions, which are called Spanish, I much like to eat simply boiled in water, with a vinaigrette sauce—i. e., oil, vinegar, pepper, and salt. It is not everybody, however, who likes onions as much as I do. I, in common with the ancient Egyptians, have the greatest veneration for these bulbs, without which no cookery worth the name would be possible. The following will be found a more elaborate way of dressing Spanish onions : They should first be parboiled in water and salt for about ten minutes; then the core, or centre, of each onion should be removed with the same instrument as is used in coring apples, to wit, a tin cylinder, half an inch in diameter—care being taken to leave the bottom part intact. This done, 1. Arrange the onions in a saucepan, in which you have previously melted a piece of butter, and mixed with it a tablespoonful of flour. Fill up the cavity of each onion with a mixture of bread crumbs, anchovies (well washed and cut up small), capers, pepper and salt; add a mixture of half stock or broth, and half claret made hot; put in, tied up in a bundle, some parsley, sweet herbs, and a few cloves, and set your saucepan on the fire to simmer gently, until the onions are thoroughly done, when remove the bundle of herbs, and dispose the onions carefully on a dish. Pour the sauce under them and serve. o

ROdND THE TABLE. 4 added. Very beautiful designs and charming patterns can be produced, at little expense, by anyone having a garden, or even a small town conservatory, if the right flowers are cultivated in it. Flowers are not always a necessity, however, for very pretty effects can be produced with leaves alone. I once saw a stand of this sort set out entirely with leaves of vegetables, and very pretty it looked. Where there is neither garden nor conservatory to get flowers from, a few shillings, judiciously expended upon some of the commonest flowers and leaves in Covent- garden, will enable those who choose to take the trouble, to produce a very creditable ornament; but, in any case, do not send to a florist to have your flower-stand decked out: you will spend a great deal more money, and have a thing not half so tasteful as if you had done it yourself, besides losing the pleasure of arranging the flowers, which is at all times a most agreeable occupation. The next thing to be attended to is to give each guest ample space to sit at the table and eat his dinner in com- fort. Everything put on the table should be scrupulously clean, and nothing should be placed upon it which is not wanted. Have no more glasses than will be required placed before each guest. It is now the fashion to have a salt cellar to each person, and a very good fashion it is; for at a well-appointed table every one should have within his reach—or be supplied with—eveiything that may be required, without having to ask or to wait for it. In France they have usually a water bottle, and a bottle or decanter of vin ordinaire, to every guest, or every second guest. In what are called dinners a la Russe the dessert is placed on the table ab initio. This is not a good feature of that system—there should be on the table ornaments

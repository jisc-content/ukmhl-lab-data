If it is not the first in flavour, among our domestic fowls, it is second to none in the delicacy and agreeable texture of its flesh. From the time of their introduction into England, turkeys have been intimately connected with Christmas, and, according to Tusser, in his “Five Hundred Points of Husbandrie,” Christmas cheer in his time con- sisted of Beefe, mutton, and pork, shred pies of the best. Pig, veal, goose, and capon, and turkey well drest; Cheese, apples, and nuts, jolly carols to hear, As then in the country is counted good cheer. And so at the present time is a turkey an indispensable adjunct to, if not the chief dish of, a Christmas dinner; and the first question that presents itself is, how shall it be “ well drest V} If the bird be of the right sort, and of the right age, there can be but one opinion among those who know how to eat. A turkey stuffed with truffles, or even with the humble chestnut, and roasted secundum artem, is a noble roast—indeed, the finest roast of poultry which can be placed upon the table. Still opinions differ; and a Scotchman, to whom I propounded my views upon the preparation of a turkey, met me by quoting a proverb of his country, to the following effect: Turkey boil’d is turkey spoil’d, And turkey roast is turkey lost, But for turkey braised the Lord be praised.

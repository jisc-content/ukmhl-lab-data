ROUND THE TABLE. 166 What are called potato chips are simply potatoes cut in spiral parings, and fried secundum- cur tern. The potato being of coui’se properly peeled before the parings are cut. The remains of boiled potatoes can be dressed in a variety of ways. Cut up into quarters, and with a white sauce, or plain melted butter with minced parsley put over them, they make a very nice dish. Cold mashed potatoes a I’Anglaise may be used in the following way : Stir an egg or two into your potatoes; add a few finely powdered spices, pepper and salt to taste, and some minced parsley; mix well, and roll the mixture into balls, or any shape yon like; cover with fine bread crumbs, fry a nice golden colour, and serve garnished with fried parsley. This dish can be varied ad infinitum, by either inserting in the middle of each ball, or incor- porating with the mixture, any of the following: The flesh of fowls or game, or of any kind of fish, lobsters, crabs, &c., all finely minced. If you have some very rich stock, moisten the minced meat or fish with it, and your dish will be improved; only, in that case, you must put a small portion of the mixture in each ball, and not mix it up with the potatoes. The above combinations can be erected into a more im- posing dish by placing the minced fish or meat in a pie dish, covering it over with potatoes, and then baking the same until the top is of the desired colour; in this case, how- ever, a regular ragout should be made for the animal part of the dish, and the potatoes play only second fiddle. There are numerous other modes of treating potatoes, either alone or in combination with various meats and vegetables, but cookery—even of potatoes—has, like art, no end.

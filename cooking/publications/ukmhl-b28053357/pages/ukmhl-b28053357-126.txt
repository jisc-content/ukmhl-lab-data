ROUND THE TABLE. 114 little heap of meat on each so as to be able to fold up the paste oyer it. Make the edges stick well together with a little white of egg. Trim them a regular shape. Fry in lard, and serve on a napkin with fried parsley. Sticking these things all over with vermicelli, as is done by some, is to me an abomination. The chief element of success of this form of serving mince is the thinness of the paste. To make true Croquettes, the meat should be submitted to a greater degree of triturationâ€”in fact, it should be pounded to a paste in a mortar; and I am not quite certain that the dish just described is not better when pounded meat is used for it instead of minced meat. When your meat is well pounded, a certain quantity of fine bread crumbs and a little flour should be added to it, then various condiments according to taste, and then two or more eggs should be incorporated with the mixture. The next operation consists in fashioning the pounded meat into any shape you like; that of sausages, cut square at the end, is the best. These you egg and bread crumb (baked bread crumbs are preferable), and repeat the process after an interval of half an hour. Then fry a light colour, and serve. This last process of pounding the meat can be applied to the remains of poultry and game, of which there might not be enough to make a hash or a mince, as well as to joints, when not much is left upon them. Of course the flavouring must be regulated according to the kind of meat to be operated upon. Another way is to stew these things a very short time in a rich gravy or sauce, or simply in tomato sauce, serving them with the sauce under. The bread crumb- ing need only be done once in this case, if at all; flour may be used instead of bread crumbs to shape the croquettes with.

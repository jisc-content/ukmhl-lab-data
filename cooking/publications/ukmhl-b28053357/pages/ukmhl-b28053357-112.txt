BOUND THE TABLE. 100 called tlie scrag end of a neck of mutton—a very good disk of Irisk stew or karicot mutton can be made for tke kitcken dinner; or tke said trimmings can be used to make gravy or stock, or even simply mutton brotk or soup. Every particle of gristle and almost all tke fat skould be removed from eack cutlet, tke bone or rib skould not be more tkan two inckes long from tke cutlet itself, or “nut,” and skould be scraped quite clean. Tke said bone ougkt to be neatly sawed off, not chopped off, at tke end. Having prepared your cutlets (wkick skould not be thicker than about one-tkird of an inch), in tke neatest manner, and given them a gentle beating with a cutlet bat, you have your choice of cooking them by various methods, wkick may be classed under two heads—tke plain process and tke bread-crumb process. There are also more elaborate ways of cooking cutlets, of wkick here- after. Tke plain process consists in broiling them on tke gridiron over a clear fire, or they may be done in front of tke fire, and this has tke advantage, that tke bones are less likely to become burnt or charred. Tke fire skould be a brisk one, and tke cutlets skould be turned fre- quently during tke operation. They skould be under- done inside and juicy, instead of having tke appearance and about tke taste of a piece of soaked leather. There is no golden rule for learning to cook cutlets well by this method; practice and love of tke art alone can enable tke cook to approach perfection. Frying in butter, oil, or even dripping, are other modes of cooking coming under this head, but none are better in tke plain form tkan broiling. It is easier, however, to fry a cutlet creditably tkan to bioil it. Tke bread-crumb process is more elaborate. It has

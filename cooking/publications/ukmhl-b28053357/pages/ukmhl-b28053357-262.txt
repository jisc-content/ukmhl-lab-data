Asparagus heads or young peas can be introduced into an omelet as they are introduced into scrambled eggs, or they may be dressed with a plain white sauce, and served round or inside the omelet, and so you will have 12. Omelette aux Pointes d’Asperges, and 13. Omelette au Pois. By using kidneys on the same principle another form of omelet will be produced. The proceeding is this : Parboil some sheep’s kidneys—a process, by the way, which should always precede the dressing of that article of diet in any form whatsoever. Cut them up in mode- rate-sized pieces, and toss them in a saucepan with a little butter. Add some pepper and salt to taste, some minced parsley, and, if you like, some minced truffles and mush- rooms. Then incorporate in a saucepan a small quantity of flour with a piece of butter, add equal parts of white wine and stock in proportionate quantity to that of the kidneys, which you transfer into this second saucepan and toss on the fire until done, when you add to them a squeeze of lemon. Being served alone, kidneys so pre- pared constitute the well-known dish Rognons au Yen de Champagne. You may use champagne if you choose, but this is by no means necessary. If a proper quantity of this ragout of kidneys be served round an omelet, or some of it be inserted in the fold thereof you will have what is called an (14) Omelette aux Bognons. Numerous other vareties of omelets may be produced by introducing into a plain omelet mixture pieces of anchovy, sardines, herrings, or preserved fish of various kinds, all being of course carefully cleaned, and —in the case of some—cooked by broiling or otherwise.

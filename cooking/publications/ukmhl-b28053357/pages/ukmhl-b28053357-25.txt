TABLE TALK. 13 dinner, but before you attempt variety, consider whether your purse can stand the expense of obtaining dry sherry, sound claret, first-rate champagne, clean hock, and good port wine. In the matter of wine no mediocrity is tolerable; small beer or even water is infinitely pre- ferable to bad wine. When people have friends to dinner they will have champagne, and so long as it has the appearance of that sparkling beverage, and can be had cheap enough, they are satisfied. A white wine with soup, fish, and sweets, and a red wine with meats and made dishes, are all that are wanted, if they be good wines, in the best of dinners. Gfood dry sherry and sound claret can be got at no greater expense than the half a dozen deleterious compounds of gooseberry which some give to their friends under the names of champagne, hock, Sauterne, &c., &c. A very big book might be written upon this subject, for drinking is one of the exclusive attributes of man, who alone, it is said, can drink when he is not thirsty,â€”pro- vided, of course, no Act of Parliament makes it penal to do so. The moral of such a book, however, can be stated in very few words. In the choice of your drinks, more than in anything else, avoid shams. The selection and disposition of the dessert is one of the most difficult things in the arrangement of a dinner. As I have said before, unless people are rich enough to have the services of a good mcdtre dl hotel, it is the lady of the house who should undertake all that part of the dinner. Each dish, fruit especially, should, with the help of flowers and leaves, be made into an elegant ornament. Fern leaves are very well adapted for this purpose, but when practicable it is more artistic to use the leaves of the fruit which compose each dish. Artificial leaves should never be employed.

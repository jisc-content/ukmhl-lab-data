HOW TO BONE FOWLS. 133 HOW TO BONE FOWLS. To make a galantine of fowl or turkey, the first tiling to be done is to bone the biped in question. A properly trained cook will, no doubt, be able to perform in the dark this operation, which, like most things, when it is known, is easy enough to do. To bone a fowl is one of the elements; and is best taught by practice and by seeing a good cook at work; nevertheless, it is not impossible, I think, to explain how the operation is carried out, and this I will attempt to do, with the help of the annexed figures, drawn from nature.

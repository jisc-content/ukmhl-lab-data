HOUND THE TABLE. 248 composition. The above hints refer particularly to the simplest form of omelet. In mixing omelets two general rules should never be forgotten. One is not to use more than eight eggs for any one omelet. Some cookery books fix the limit at twelve, but that is too many, especially if the operator be new at her work. To my mind two omelets of six eggs each are far preferable, for many reasons, to one of twelve. Still keeping in view the unschooled British cook referred to at the beginning of this paper, I should let her only use two eggs at first, the number to be increased as she becomes proficient. The other rule is not to beat up the eggs too much; the object of beating them is simply to mix the whites and the yolks well together, and this should be done only just before the mixture is put into the omelet-pan. The simplest form of mixing an omelet consists in beating up two eggs in a basin, with salt and pepper to taste, and a pinch of miuced parsley. There are people who add pieces of bread crumb and a few morsels of butter. To this I see no objection; but the admixture of water or milk with the eggs is much to be deprecated, although mentioned in some cookery books which are accounted authorities.

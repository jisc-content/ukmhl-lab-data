86 ROUND THE TABLE. 3. Remains of poultry and game, or of the two com- bined, make a very good salpicon, and the addition of some tongue or ham to the former is desirable; but the preparation must be somewhat different, and a liaison of yolks of eggs and lemon juice is imperative; in fact, to make a good salpicon of fowls, you should have some good veloute sauce wherewith to bind your minced fowl and tongue, to which the addition of minced truffles, or at least mushrooms, is almost indispensable if you wish to produce a truly artistic dish. 4. With fish, particularly salmon, excellent salpicon for kromeskys is made; and it is for these that the wafer instead of bacon or calf's udder is used.

Lobsters and prawns, minced to the required size, and bound with a good white sauce and a liaison of yolks of eggs, constitute another variety of salpicon; but for these, wafer should be used in preference to bacon. Having your salpicon ready, the mode of proceeding is this : Cut some slices of previously parboiled bacon as thin as you possibly can, and to the size of about an inch and a half by two or two and a half inches; place on each slice a teaspoonful of salpicon, and roll it up in the bacon very neatly : keep the kromeskys in a cool place till the time of frying them, when much dexterity is required to dip them in batter and lay them in the frying pan with- out unrolling them. Some clumsy people tie up their kromeskys with a bit of thin thread before dipping them in batter: this should be avoided. If a cook can-

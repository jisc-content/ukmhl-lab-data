ROUND THE TABLE. 226 Olives should be well washed before using them, and the stone should be neatly removed, so as not to spoil the shape of the fruit. There is a kind of olives, which are sold ready stoned, with a small piece of anchovy inserted in each of them in place of the stone; these are not so good for dessert as the plain olives, but for salad purposes they are capital. Anchovies require even more washing than olives, and if they be not first-rate, and neatly filleted and cleaned, they will assuredly spoil your salad. Sardines, herrings, other fish and Crustacea, should be very carefully picked, and cut up in neat fillets or pieces. Meat should be cut up in fillets, and all “ outside ” parts — i.e., those browned by the operation of roasting — removed. In the case of fowls and game, the most economical way is, of course, to cut them up in small neat “joints”; but the most artistic way is to cut out “ fillets ” of the meat only, so as to have no bones in the salad. Although all kinds of greenmeat are used in these compound salads, lettuce with a few aromatic herbs is preferable to any other. The proper sort of dressing is a mayonnaise, a tartare, or a ravigotte. In cookery books these salads are usually called mayonnaise of fowls or fish, as the case may be, and they include that well-known British institution, the lobster salad of ball suppers aud picnics. To prepare one of these salads in an artistic way, the lettuce and what fines herbes you may wish to use should be dressed with a plain salad sauce without eggs, and the fish, flesh, or fowl fillets should be steeped for an hour or so in a similar sauce. You then dispose your materials neatly on a dish, and cover up the whole with a well- made mayonnaise, tartare, or ravigotte, finishing by ornamenting your dish as will be explained farther on.

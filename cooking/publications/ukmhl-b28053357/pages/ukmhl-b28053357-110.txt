Take equal parts of meat, cut in neat pieces, and of cold boiled potatoes, sliced; beat up together some olive oil and tarragon vinegar, in the proportion of two to one, add powdered pepper and salt to taste, one shallot, with a pinch of chervil and one of tarragon minced very fine; lay the meat and potatoes in the mixture, and ornament with some hard-boiled eggs and some gherkins. I need not add that this kind of salad may be varied ad infinitum.

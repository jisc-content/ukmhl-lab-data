225 SALADS. minutes or so, and then add a good allowance of vinegar, into which you have put pepper, salt, mustard, &c., in due proportion. Pour the mixture, as soon as it boils, over the salad, which must be put into a warmed salad bowl and eaten without delay. This is, of course, a homely dish, but it has merits nevertheless. Another way of dispensing with oil is to heat some butter until it gets a deep brown colour; then to add to it vinegar, pepper, salt, mustard, &c., and, when the mixture boils, to mix the salad, which must be eaten immediately. Hard-boiled eggs, minced more or less small, should be put into this salad. Here is another form : Melt a large piece of butter, and add to it pepper, salt quant, suff., and a very little flour; then pour some boiling water to it, just enough to make a sufficient quantity of dressing; stir the mixture on the fire till it boils, when you take it off, and stir into it the yolks of two eggs beaten up with the juice of a lemon. When your sauce is quite cold, strain it through a colander, and add to it vinegar, mustard, and any other seasonings which taste may suggest. A richer form of the above consists in making what is called a cup-custard, into which you put pepper and salt instead of sugar. When the custard is cold strain it, and use it instead of oil to mix your salad. The accessories of a salad may be described as every- thing which is good to eat cold. All kinds of pickles, olives, capers, anchovies, sardines, herrings, prawns, shrimps, crabs, lobsters, Italian and German sausages, ham, all sorts of cold meat, fowl, fish, and game, can be advantageously introduced in a salad, and it is simply a matter of taste which and how many of these things are to be associated together with the greenmeat in the same salad bowl or dish.

ROUND THE TABLE. 104 EPIGRAMS. The essence of epigram consists in neatness and the faculty of producing an agreeable surprise. The culinary epigram, and occasionally its literary brother also, present to us “ old friends with a new face/’’ and charm the lan- guid palate with a new and startling combination of well- known elements. And this, perhaps, is the reason why such familiar viands as lamb and mutton, dressed in small compass and in a fanciful manner, constitute what in cookery are called Epigrams. The mode of making these is by no means difficult, and is what I now propose to describe. Braise a piece of breast of lamb or mutton in a stew- pan, with some water, onions, carrots, celery, whole pepper, salt, a few cloves, and a bouquet garni, i.e., parsley, thyme, marjoram, in proper proportions, and a bay leaf, all tied up in a little bundle. When sufficiently done to allow it, pull out all the bones, and put the breast, between two dishes, under the heaviest weight you can get, there to remain until perfectly cold. In the meantime, the liquor in which it has been braised should be strained, and freed from fat, either to be used as I shall presently state, or to be kept for other purposes. The breast, being cold and stiff, is now neatly cut up into the shape of cutlets or collops, and these are egged and bi’ead-crumbed ; after an interval of at least one hour they are again egged and bread- crumbed ; but this last time there should be a little salt and white pepper mixed with the egg.

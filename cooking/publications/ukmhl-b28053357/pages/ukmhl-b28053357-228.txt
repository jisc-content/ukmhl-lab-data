A sauce or a ragout you may modify, correct, and alter in many ways as you go on; a salad you cannot, without making a mess of the whole thing, when once you have mixed the greenmeat with the dressing. Practice is the only master of whom to learn salad-making. I do not pretend to teach anyone how to make salads; all I can do is to point out, to those who wish to become adepts in the art, how to set about it.

Heat to boiling point half a gallon of the best French vinegar, pour it into the cask, and roll it about in all directions; after which half fill your cask with some good white wine. Place it by the side of the kitchen fire, or, if in summer, in the open air, in a place

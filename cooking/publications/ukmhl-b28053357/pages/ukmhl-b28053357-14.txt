BOUND THE TABDE. 2 can be crammed on the table. It is also, unhappily, thc- custom to invite at one time as many friends as is possible, and the consequence generally is that—as at a certain entertainment— Oil chacun, malgre soi, l’un sur l’autre porttf, Faisait un tour a gauche, et mangeait de cote— the unfortunate guest, if he eat at all, must do so side- ways, and in such an uncomfortable position that the best of food cannot compensate him for the trouble he endures to get at it. Dr. Johnson used to say, that there were many things worth seeing in the world, but very few worth going to see. So do I believe, that numerous as may be the things good to eat, there are none worth the sacrifice of going" to the conventional dinner party. In a general way, in London, hosts and guests, men and women, old and young, are, I think, agreed that a dinner party is a terrible boi’e. It is a kind of duty imposed upon people, to ask their friends to dinner two or three times a-year, and to attend similar entertain- ments themselves ; but pleasure is a thing totally uncon- nected with a party of this description. This is a great evil, for, as Savarin has it, “ I pray you remember that the pleasures of a well-ordered table are, of all the enjoy- ments of this life, the most durable, for they recur every day, and are, in fact, life itself, for we cannot keep alive without eating.” Admitting that we are capable of the feelings of friend- ship and love to our neighbours, what greater mark can we give our friends of our regard for them than by asking them to come and eat with us; and is it not our duty,, when they do come, to procure for them the greatest amount of enjoyment in our power ? That this is not done is from no other reason than from want of taste.

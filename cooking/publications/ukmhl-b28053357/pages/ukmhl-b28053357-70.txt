ROUND THE TABLE. 58 The following is a somewhat different and more artistic form of Sauce piquante.—Put half a pint of vinegar into a saucepan with one clove of garlic, a couple of shallots minced fine, a sprig of thyme, a bay leaf, pepper and spices to taste, and, if liked, a little cayenne; let the whole boil till reduced to one-half, then add half a pint of stock or broth. Melt a piece of butter the size of an egg in a saucepan, mix a little Hour with it, then add the above liquor, strained. Stir the sauce till it boils, add salt if required, and a little parsley minced fine, and some chopped gherkins and capers. Yet another form of sauce, akin to the above, is Italian sauce, of which the following are two for- mulas :— Sauce a l’Italienne.—Mince a couple of shallots quite fine, and fry them in a little salad oil. When they are a pale straw colour add two or three mushrooms and a little parsley minced in the same manner, then moisten with enough stock and white wine, in equal parts, to make the sauce •, put in, tied up in a small bundle, a clove of garlic, some sweet herbs, and a bay leaf; add pepper and salt to taste, and let the sauce boil for half an hour. Remove the bundle ; melt a piece of butter, add a very little flour, then gradually mix the sauce with it. Stir it well on the fire, and as soon as it is hot it is ready. 2. Fry in butter some onions chopped fine till they are a golden colour, add some ham and mushrooms finely minced, moisten with some good stock; put in a clove of garlic, a few cloves, pepper and salt to taste, a bay leaf, a little thyme, and some parsley. When the sauce has boiled an hour or so, add one glass of white wine and a squeeze of lemon; let it boil five minutes more, then strain it carefully, and finish it as the other.

ROASTING. 147 ROASTING. The national mode of cooking meat in this country is roasting, and such noble joints as a roast sirloin of beef or a roast haunch of mutton can nowhere be found in the same perfection as in England. The quality of the meat has, however, as much to do with it as the skill of the cooks.

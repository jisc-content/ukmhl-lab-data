260 ROUND THE TABLE. 4. Various kinds of jam strained through muslin, with a little cold water added to them if they are too thick. Some cochineal should be added when the juice of fruit or jam is used. 5. A small quantity of liqueur (such as maraschino). 6. The thin rind of lemons or oranges, scraped and added to the whipped cream. 7. Orange flower-water or rose-water, or the least drop of essence of roses or vanilla, will produce other varieties of flavours. 8. The juice of good orange marmalade will give both flavour and colour to the cream. Soaking the sponge- cake in sherry will not do with all and everyone of these flavourings, nor is a sponge-cake de rigueur. What are called Savoy or finger biscuits piled up on a dish will do just as well, and in some cases better. Now, if you line a mould with these biscuits, fill the inside with whipped cream and ice it, you will produce what is called a Charlotte Kusse. The proceeding is this : Line the bottom and sides of a plain mould with finger-biscuits, which you trim for the purpose. Beat up into a froth one pint of double cream, sweetened to taste with pounded lump sugary add one ounce of the finest isinglass dissolved in a gill of milk with a liqueur glass of maraschino. Pour this mixture into the mould, set it on ice for a coujfle of hours, then turn it out and serve. The French form of apple pudding is also called a Charlotte, and is made in this way : Charlotte de pommes.â€”Line a pie dish with thin slices of bread buttered on both sides, fill it with layers of apples cut up very small, placing a little apricot jam between each layer, some grated lemon rind, and plenty of sugar; cover the top with slices of bread buttered in the same way, and bake till the bread is well browned.

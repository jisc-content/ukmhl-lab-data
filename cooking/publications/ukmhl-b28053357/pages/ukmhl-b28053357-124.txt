ROUND THE TABLE. 112 as deep as you can go without coming through at the bottom. Fry these a gold colour in pure lard, and plenty of it. Then, when they are well drained and dried before the fire, remove the inside part with the point of a knife, and you will have a small case of fried bread. Fill each with mince, and serve. These are called Croustades. These cases can also be made with potatoes, and this is the way to proceed :— Cassolettes de Pommes de terre.—Peel 21b. of potatoes, boil them ten minutes in watei’, strain it off, and add a couple of ounces of butter and a little salt; cover them up and leave them to steam till thoroughly done, when you stir into them the yolks of three eggs, add a little grated nutmeg, and keep stirring them on the fire for five minutes.

When the paste is thoroughly cold, cut it into cylinders with a plain round cutter 2in. in diameter, and egg and bread-crumb each cylinder; mark it on the top with a smaller cutter so as to form the cover, and fry them in hot lard till they are of a gold colour: remove the top, take out the best part of the inside with the handle of a teaspoon, taking great care not to damage the outside. Fill up each case with mince, replace the covers, and serve. A wall of plain mashed potatoes or of rice can also be used to enclose a mince upon its dish. The mashed pota- toes should be made rather hard, so as to stand up well. They may be browned or not, according to fancy. Coating the outside of your wall with a beaten-up egg will help the browning. Rice should, for the purpose, be cooked in this way. Put into a saucepan as much rice, picked clean and washed, as you require, with enough

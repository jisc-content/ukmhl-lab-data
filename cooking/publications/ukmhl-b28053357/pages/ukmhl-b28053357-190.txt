ROUND THE TABLE. 178 melted butter made with cream, or nobler sauces, like Veluute, Bechamel, &c. Such beans as have passed the prescribed limit, if suffered to grow, will eventually produce haricots, which make most excellent dishes. It is hard to tell whether they are more delicious, fresh or dried. They are more delicate when they are fresh ; but in this form they are a luxury which must be denied to the dwellers in cities, for, although all corn-chandlers keep some sort of dried haricot beans, and there are in London a few Italian ware- houses where the superior kinds are to be gotâ€”fresh ones, I apprehend, are not procurable anywhere, as being, like many other good things, accounted unfit for human food by British cooks.

The haricots, or beans proper, of scarlet runners, can be treated as those of French beans ; some of them are of a very pretty pink colour, variegated with blue, but they lose their colours by boiling, and turn slate colour. If, however, the juice of a lemon be put in the water in which they are boiled, they will assume a whitish-pink hue.

Broad beans should undergo a similar operation before

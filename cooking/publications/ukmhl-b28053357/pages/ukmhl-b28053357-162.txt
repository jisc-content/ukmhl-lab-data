150 ROUND THE TABLE. water over the joint. I cannot say that I approve of these two last operations. A properly roasted joint should produce its own gravy when it comes to be carved; and as for white meats, they should have a proper gravy pre- pared for them with something better than plain water. It may seem superfluous to mention that the meat screen should always be used to roast anything, from a haunch of mutton to half a dozen quails, but it very often happens that cooks, when about to roast such small fry as the latter, will not take the trouble to place the screen in front of the fire; but the help of it is more necessary in such a case than when a large joint is being roasted. Another point which cannot, however, always be carried out in private houses is that, while the fire is being used for roasting, it should not be employed for anything else. The Gallic mode of roasting joints of meat differs materi- ally from the English. In the first place, when it is in- tended to roast a piece of meat, it is always placed for some hours, and even for a day or two, in a marinade, in the composition of which oil and sometimes wine play an important part. Whether joints are improved by this treatment is a matter of taste useless to enlarge upon; and I shall content myself by giving a few examples of joints roasted d la Franqaise. Fillet oe Beef.—Take a piece of fillet of beef (the undercut of the sirloin), trim off the fat neatly and the thin skin next to it, lard—not too finely—the outside of the fillet with fat bacon, and lay it for a whole day in a pie dish with plenty of olive oil, and some pepper, salt, parsley, slices of oniou, and bay leaves. Turn it occasionally. Cover the larded side with a piece of oiled paper, roast it at a brisk fire, and do not let it be overdone. Baste it fre- quently with butter, or with some of the marinade, and a short time before serving remove the paper, spriukle the

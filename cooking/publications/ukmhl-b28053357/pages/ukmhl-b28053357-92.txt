80 BOUND THE TABLE. incorporate sufficient flour to make the batter; when quite cold, mix thoroughly with it one tablespoonful of orange-flower water, and the whites of two eggs beaten into froth. 8. Add to a tumblerful of French or Rhenish wine a liqueur glass of brandy and the same quantity of oil; then make a thick paste with the yolks of four eggs, a little water, and some flour; it should be so thick that by adding thereto the wine, brandy, and oil, it will become a batter of the proper consistency. One white of egg beaten into a froth should be added before using the batter. 9. Reverting to the first recipe, instead of rum or brandy, use the same quantity of any liqueur you may fancy, putting only half the quantity of oil and no salt. 10. Make a smooth paste with flour and a glass of ale, then add a tablespoonful of dissolved butter and a pinch of salt ; the yolks of two eggs are then worked into the mixture, and then the white of one or two eggs beaten into a froth. Taste and circumstances must determine which of the above forms of batter is to be used. I now proceed to describe the composition of the fritters themselves, the number and varieties of which are many. Apples should be cored, cut in slices a quarter of an inch thick, and laid for at least a couple of hours in a marinade of brandy and sugar,- to which the thin rind of a lemon, or some cinnamon cut in pieces, is added; sherry may be substituted for brandy, but the effect will not be so good. At the time of frying drain each piece of apple, dip it in batter, taking care that it is covered all over, and fry. Another form consists in rolling each piece of apple in finely powdered sugar before dipping into the batter.

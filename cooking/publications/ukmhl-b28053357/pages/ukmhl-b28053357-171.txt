ASPIC JELLY. 159 glass of sherry. You now dip each piece of game into this sauce, and when the coating of sauce on each is cold repeat the operation. Dispose the pieces on a dish, and ornament with hits of aspic jelly. Or you may fill a border mould with aspic jelly, into which you place tiny fillets of truffles and breast of game alternately. When set, you turn out the border, and within it set up the pieces of game treated as above. When the remains of game consist of a salmis, all that need be done is to pick out the best pieces, reduce the sauce of the salmis, and proceed as above. To make an effective Chaud-froid of fowl you must first roast three or four fowls without allowing them to be browned, which is done by covering them over while roasting with a piece of paper well buttered. You then cut the breasts into neat thick fillets, and dispose them on end round a dish—what is called en couronne— placing a slice of truffle between each fillet. You then take some strong white stock, and in this boil down the bones of the fowls with mushroom and truffle trimmings, sweet herbs and spices to taste, and some shallots. When this sauce is well reduced, strain it and add a little white wine. In the mean time the flesh of the legs should be pounded to a pulp in a mortar, and this pulp passed through a sieve. To this you add sufficient sauce to make a thick puree, working into it also a small quantity of well-flavoured aspic jelly in a liquid state. When the puree begins to cool pour it in the middle of the fillets; then cover up the whole—“ masking ” is the technical word—with the sauce, and when quite cold ornament the dish with aspic jelly, truffles, &c. Another form, which needs fewer fowls and less trouble, consists in cutting up the whole of one fowl into neat joints, covering each with the reduced sauce, and dressing

ROUND THE TABLE. 66 The lard in which these cutlets are fried must he very hot, else they will prove failures, especially if made according to the last two recipes. By shaping any of the above into balls you will pro- duce Croquettes de Homard, and by treating remnants of salmon in the same manner you will have, according as you shape the mixture, Croquettes de Saumon, or one form of Salmon Cutlets. The artistic form, however, of salmon cutlet is a different affair, and of this the following recipe is an example : Salmon Cutlets aux Concombres.â€”Take a slice of salmon two inches thick, carefully remove the bones and skin, cut it into slices half an inch thick, and flatten each on the chopping board with a cutlet bat dipped in water. From these slices cut as many cutlets of a uniform shape as you can. Place them quite flat on a well-buttered baking tin, sprinkle pepper and salt over them, and, ten minutes before they are wanted, put them into the oven with a sheet of buttered white paper over them. Put all the trimmings of the salmon into a saucepan with carrots, onions, thyme, parsley, a bay leaf, a few cloves, some whole pepper, salt to taste, and a little more than a pint of good stock. Leave this to boil gently till reduced to one-half, then strain the liquor into a basin, and remove any fat there may be. Melt a piece of butter the size of an egg, add to it a httle flour, and stir it on the fire till it is well coloured; add the liquor to this, and continue stirring until the sauce boils. Cut a large cucumber in rounds an inch long, cut each round into four quarters, remove the seeds and rind, and trim each piece to a uniform shape, then throw them into boiling water with a little salt; let them boil until nearly cooked. Strain them, and throw them into cold water, then strain them again, and put them into a saucepan with a little butter.

ROUND THE TABLE. 268 flour with a gill of milk; stir it over the fire until it thickens; add the yolks of four eggs, and as much apple marmalade as will give you a mixture of the proper con- sistency; work it well so as to get it of a uniform smooth- ness, then add the whites of six eggs in the usual way. A little fresh butter may be added to this form of souffle, but it is by no means necessary. By a somewhat similar process souffles of apricots, strawberries, plums, greengages, &c., may be produced. Another form consists in working into a plain souffle mixture a small quantity of any sort of ready-made jam or marmalade. When some fruit (such as strawberries), is used, a little cochineal should be added, to give the compound a nice colour. To flavour souffles with lemon or oranges when no essence is used, the juice of two lemons or of two oranges, and their thin rind chopped up small or grated, should be added to a plain souffle mixture when cold, and then the eggs should be worked in as explained above. The last kind of souffle I have to describe is that which is flavoured with coffee, tea, or chocolate. Using essence of coffee is not satisfactory for souffles. My notion of a coffee souffle is this : Take a couple of ounces of good coffee newly roasted, grind it and pour over it half a pint of boiling milk, stir it well and let it stand in a covered vessel for at least an hour, then strain it; mix a couple of teaspoonfuls of potato flour with a little drop of the coffee till quite smooth, then add the rest of the coffee, and stir on the fire until it begins to thicken, adding pounded loaf sugar to taste. When the mixture is cold, put in a liqueur glass of pale brandy, the yolks of four and the whites of six eggs in the usual way. Another way is to use water

VEGETABLES. 187 it does with almost everything eatable; but it must be proper tomato sauce, not an infusion of capsicum in vinegar with some tomato pulp floating in it. Lastly, they may be eaten with melted butter made with egg-yolks and lemon juice; and this form more nearly approaches the English fashion of eating vegetables. One of the prettiest dishes of vegetables I know of consists of a cauliflower of ivory whiteness resting upon a bed of well-made tomato sauce. To boil a cauliflower : after it has been trimmed and soaked in salted water for some time, it should be put in plenty of fast boiling water, with a due quantity of salt. Care should be taken not to overboil it. Try the stem with a thin iron skewer, and the moment it is soft remove the saucepan from the fire, and put the cauliflower to drain on a hair sieve. When two or more cauliflowers are used, they should be moulded into one for serving. To do this; when they are boiled cut off the stalk, and dispose the pieces of cauli- flower head downwards in a basin; press them gently together, turn them out dexterously on a dish, and two or three small cauliflowers will by this means present the appearance of one large one. Care must be taken to have the basin quite hot, and to operate quickly. This cannot very well be done with the small purple cauliflower or brocoli ; but all the formulae given for cauliflowers proper may be applied to brocoli likewise. Instead of tomato sauce, the following sauces may be used : Caper sauce, gherkin sauce, sauce jqiquante, sauce blanche, Bechamel, or maitre dâ€™hutel. The sauce should be put into the dish, and the cauliflowers laid upon it; but if the moulding process has not been successful, or if the cauliflowers are not very nice-looking, then pour the sauce over them so as to hide their deformity. The very best way, however, to treat cauliflowers is au

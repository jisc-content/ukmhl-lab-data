They should be gathered young, before the skin of the bean hardens, and then let them be boiled in water with a goodly piece of bacon and a sprig or two of savory. When they are done, put your piece of bacon in a dish, drain the beans, toss them for a minute in a saucepan, with plenty of parsley and melted butter made sec. art., and fortify the bacon with a rampart of beans all round it.

I cut them diagonally, so as to form lozenges the size of a broad bean, and they are not cooked in water at all, but stewed with butter, onions, and condiments to taste. Peas are a more refined vegetable, and to be perfect they require the juices of three other leguminous produc- tions, viz., onions, lettuce, and mint.

Sometimes I use parsley and mint in equal quantities. When the peas are very young, they should not be cooked in water at all, but by the following process :

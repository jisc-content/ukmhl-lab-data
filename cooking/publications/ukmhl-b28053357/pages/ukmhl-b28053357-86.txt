Mutton dripping is an abomination never to be used under any circumstances, except by tallow- chandlers. This wet frying business may be described as boiling things in fat, and what makes it a vei’y attractive mode of dressing food is, that the juices of each morsel are kept in it instead of a large part of them being dissolved, as in the case of boiling in water. The cardinal point of successful frying is to let the fat become sufficiently hot before com- mencing operations. All the merit of a good friture, says Brillat Savarin, depends upon the surprise—i.e., upon the fat being hot enough; and I would refer all those who have any wish to improve in the art to the Professor’s Seventh Meditation, The Theory of the Friture. This Gallic word friture—-frittura in Italian—means in those languages, not only frying or the action of doing so, but the medium used in frying, and also the thing fried, be it what it may. I am not aware of any English words to render these two significations. But, to return to the frying-pan. If the fat is not sufficiently heated, the things to be fried, instead of being “ surprised” by it, will get soaked with it; and you will produce a flabby, greasy mess, instead of a crisp, appe- tising dish. Until practice has been acquired the heat of the fat should be tried with a sippet of bread, and if in a few seconds it assume a light yellow colour, then proceed. The things to be fried should themselves be as free from moisture as possible, as othei’wise they will lower the temperature of the fat suddenly, and prevent their surprise and the success of the cook. In the case of potatoes, they should be dried thoroughly in a cloth after being cut

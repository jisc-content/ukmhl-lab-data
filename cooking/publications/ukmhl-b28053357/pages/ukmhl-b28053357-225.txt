Besides, it is by no means the largest lettuces which make the best salads; the Cos lettuce, Gallice “ Romciine,” is all very well in its way, but the cabbage lettuce, the laitue pommee, when it is well pommee, is by far preferable. This should be cut into quarters like an orange, but when the exigences of ornamentation do not demand shapely pieces, the lettuce should not be outi’aged by the contact of steel. The leaves should be torn asunder by the agency of the fingers alone, the rent fragments can then be perfectly dried by being shaken in several napkins (a dry one being substituted for each as it become saturated) until each individual leaf is perfectly dry. The same remark will apply to endive, but this can better bear cutting up than lettuce, and may be treated accordingly ; but it is a mistake to put endive and lettuce in the same salad bowl. What is called corn salad goes better with endive, although 1 think that it is wrong to put too many herbs into one salad—as a salad; as a condiment it is a different matter. As such, water-cresses, tarragon, burnet, garden-cress, American, and Australian cress, chervil, parsley, basil, mint, balm, marjoram, &c., may be used, but they must be used with discretion. Like- wise beetroot, cucumber, onions, celery, radishes, chives, and garlic, can be put into a salad with success if you know how to use them. That artificial herb, mustard and cress, which is always associated with all salads by the British greengrocer, should never be used if it can be avoided. The American and Australian curled and perennial cresses are much pre- ferable in point of taste and appearance. These, as well as water-cress, tarragon, and burnet, must not be cut up too small, but the leaves only, especially in the case of water-cress, must be used, and not the stalks as well.

167 VEGETABLES. Before I proceed farther, I would wish to impress strongly upon the minds of operators that all vegetables cannot be too carefully cleaned and washed, and that every leaf or speck the least tainted or discoloured must be thrown aside. It is better to steam greens, cabbages, and the like, for in that case the squeezing process is no longer necessary to free them from a superabundance of water, and this is a very great advantage for those who like their food to look nice, and who yet will have their cabbage plainly cooked without any further dressing. A fair sprinkling of salt should be applied to the vegetables before they are put into the steamer. Pepper, sjDices, sweet herbs, onions, &c., can be advantageously added to the water, thereby producing a savoury steam wherewith to cook the vegetables and improve their taste. The form of dressing greens, however, which usually obtains, is that of boiling them in water; but, then those who know how to cook have various cunning ways of pre- paring them for the table after they have been boiled. Here are some of these : 1. Take a young cabbage or savoy, remove the outer leaves, and cut it in four or more “ quarters.” Lay them in cold water, with a good handful of salt, for two or three hours. Then throw them into boiling water to boil from fifteen to twenty minutes, after which put them on a sieve to drain thoroughly. Take a piece of the fat of bacon. Mince it very fine, adding to it the least bit of shallot or onion and sweet herbs, pepper and spices according to taste. Put it all in a saucepan, and as soon as the minced bacon is melted lay your pieces of cabbage in it, and add a sufficient quantity of hot stock or broth, or even plain water, to half cover them. Let the whole simmer till thoroughly done, when you carefully remove the pieces

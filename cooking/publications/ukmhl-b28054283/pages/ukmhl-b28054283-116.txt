[CRO 82 Cress.—A plant much used in salad and in- cluded with others of a similar kind under the general name of small salad. One variety—a small annual generally growing with mustard, well-known under the name of mustard and cress—is remarkable for the small quantity of soil on which it can be grown. Indian cress (nasturtium) is a luxuriously-growing creeping plant, bearing trumpet-shaped flowers ; the leaves are used for salad and the matured seeds are pickled. {^See Nasturtium.) There is also a land-cress which has a similar appearance to water- cress but grows on land and is sometimes cultivated in gardens. Where it once obtains possession of the ground it cannot he easily exterminated. Then again we have the water-cress.—{See Water-cress.) Crimping.—A method of preparing large fish for cooking. This was formerly done in a cruel manner by slashing the fish at certain distances apart with a knife as soon as it was caught, while still alive. This is now avoided, and the flesh is equally good if the crimping is performed while quite fresh, and placed for some time in cold water containing a little vinegar. Croquettes.—These useful little side dishes are made of minced poultry, fish or meat, and are *very handy and economical, as any small pieces of joints or fish left from dinner can be used in making them. The fish or meat which form their foundation must be highly-seasoned, chojiped very small, mixed with a little sauce to give a flavour, dipped in eggs and bread-crumbs, fried until crisp, and served while hot, with or without sauce. Before being brought to table all the fat should be carefully drained from them, and they should be piled symmetrically upon a hot napkin. Though

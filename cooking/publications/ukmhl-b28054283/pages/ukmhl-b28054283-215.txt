mul] [mul 181 inevitably takes a quantity of sand into its mouth, but it is furnished with a kind of self-filtering appar- atus which enables it to sift the food so taken. It is described by naturalists as one of the most daring and ingenious of fish. Its most strongly-marked trait, however, is the intense love of freedom it dis- plaj^s. So powerfully developed is this instinct in the grey mullet that, when caught in the net, it makes violent and persistent efforts to escape, either attempting to leap over the top, to glide through the interstices, or even to beat against the sides, as if to break its prison bars.

It is said that the reason why those amazing sums were paid for the fish was because, when dying, the lovely colours of the fish underwent various changes, and its death agonies thus afforded an exquisite artistic treat to refined Roman senses.

16C) mal] MAN bouquet. Grapes for making malmsey are grown on a rocky soil, where they are most completely exposed to the full light and heat of the sun; they are also allowed to hang upon the vines a month longer than grapes employed for the making of other wines, and until they are partly withered. Malmsey was largely consumed in the Middle Ages, and in 1478, the Duke of Clarence, brother of Edward IV., being condemned to death by the king, and allowed to choose the manner of his execution, was, in accordance with his own wish, drowned in a butt of this wine. In Shakespeare’s “Love’s Labour’s Lost” there is a line which couples together “ Metheglin, wort, and Malmsey.” The name was first applied to the rich wines brought from Southern Greece, principally from a place called Monemvasia. This name was corrupted by the Italians to Malvoisie, and by the English to Malmsey. Our chief sujDi^lies of Malmsey are now imported from Sardinia, Sicily, Madeira, the Canary Islands and the Azores. Malt.—{See Brewing aud Beer.) Mango.—The fruit of the mango tree, which grows in India to the height of thirty or forty feet, is about the size of a large pear. It is eaten just as gathered from the tree, or boiled; or, when sliced, with wine, sugar and nutmeg. Preserves are also made with mangoes, and a spirituous liquor is prepared from the juice. An excellent pickle is made with the unripe fruit. From its tenderness it is impossible to import it in a ripe state into this country. A very quaint Eastern writer, described in the most extravagant manner the sweetness of the fruit, the recollection of which he said made the ink stick to the paper and prevented his sajdng more. Let such be the case in writing this little article.

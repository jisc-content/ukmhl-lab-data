In Bottles, 6d. and 1s. each. In addition to the usual ingredients of a first-class Sauce, tliis one contains pure Pepsine, Nature’s remedy for indigestion—hence it is invaluable to all sufferers from that most distressing complaint, by whom it should be taken freely with ever}’ meal. The delicacy of flavour, and the richness and refined zest, com- bined in this justly-celebrated sauce, universally recommend it to the imlate of the most fastidious epicure ; while its judicious combination of selected aromatics proves a most grateful stimulus to the important functions of the stomach, its affluent piquancy lends a peculiar and exquisite enjoyment to the pleasures of the table. All persons wishing to enjoy good digestion should partake of it freely with their meals. TAKE A HARD-BOILED EGG, separate the white from the yolk, break up the white as if masticated, add to it two table-spoonfuls of LORIMER’S PEPSINE SAUCE diluted with an equal quanity of water, mix well and allow the mixture to stand at a temperature of 130 deg. Fah. for a few hours, when it will be found that most, if not all, of the egg has disappeared —has actually been digested as in the living stomach ; a similar result will occur if shreds of beef finely minced are used instead of white of egg. A sauce which does not answer this test is useless, and the only one in the world which will is From “CHEMIST & DRUGGIST,’’ Nov. 15th, 1873. “Mr. Lorimer lias conceived the hajipy tlionglit of introducing a ‘Pepsine Sauce.' The idea seems to be excellent. There is no doubt that the Pepsine does possess great virtue, and we have satisfied ourselves that LOKIMEE'S SAUCE con- tains a fair proportion of this product Nothing could be easier or more natural than to take I’epsine in this form, and we may add, that the Sauce is also of an agreeable and piquant flavour.'’ Dr. ScilACllT, Pre.sident of the “ Apotbeker Yevein,” in a paper read before that scientific body at Berlin, in 1873, referred to LORIMER'S SAUCE in terms of the highest praise, and recommended it in preference to any other form of Pepsine wines, essences, &c.

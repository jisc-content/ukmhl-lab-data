188 on [oil staple article of food amongst the Scotch peasantry, who also make large, flat cakes of oatmeal. In con- sequence of the tenacity of the starch cells it is difficult to make it into bread, except when baked at a \ ery high temperature. So much has always been thought of it in Scotland, that in the old Bolder warfare the Scotch marauders carried a bag of oatmeal at their saddle-bow as their only reliable food. Quite recently a special preparation has been biought out, called “ Boiled oats.” In making this the giain is subjected to enormous pressure under steel rollers, whereby the cells are so crushed as to set free the starch granules. “Boiled oats,” there- foie, can be perfectly cooked in less than a quarter of the time required for oatmeal, however finely it may have been ground. Oil. The oil used for culinary purposes is ob- tained from the olive tree. For this purpose the olives are gathered before they are quite rijie, and then crushed in a mill; that obtained by the first gentle pressure is called virgin oil. Most of the oil used in this country comes from Italy, France and Spain, in which countries it is much more largely consumed than in England. It is principally used here as a salad dressing; but it is far superior to ^ lard or any other kind of fat for frying fish, omelettes, &c., but is not so well adapted for chops, steaks and meat in general. The Ville de Provence oil has the highest reputation, but that from Lucca is not inferior to it. Cotton-seed oil is now much used, both by itself and as an adulterant, in place of the more delicate produce of the olive, to which, however, it is not very greatly inferior if carefully expressed. In India and Fiji, earth-nut, and other oils, are largely employed for culinary puiqioses.

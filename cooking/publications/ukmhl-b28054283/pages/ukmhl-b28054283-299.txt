This portion, inclusive of the ribs at- tached, is large enough to form a separate joint and is called the spare rib. It is generally roasted, and is very tender and well flavoured, when not too fat.

The leaves are large and the stem hollow, branching out and producing flowers from two to three feet high. There are three varieties—the Flanders, the prickly- seeded and the round-leaved, the latter being the best for summer use. Spinach should be prepared for table in the same way as other green vegetables, except that the wet leaves are put into the saucepan without any water besides that which adheres to them, and they should always be well washed in salt water and carefully picked over, as insects are very apt to be concealed amongst them.

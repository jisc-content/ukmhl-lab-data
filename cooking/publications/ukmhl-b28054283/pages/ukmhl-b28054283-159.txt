[had 125 gur] conHHOU fowl. The (]^Ucility of its flesh is between that of the fowl and the pheasant; it is very easy of digestion, and has the advantage of being in season when game is not. The guinea-fowl has a dark, bluish grey plumage, sprinkled with round, white spots ; it has a very harsh and unpleasant voice. It is kept in English runs wdth turkeys and the common domestic fowl, but never loses the ten- dency to relapse into its wflld habits, by hiding and laying its eggs in retired spots.

There are many varieties of the gurnard: the red, the piper, the streaked, the grey, “ Bloches,” the ‘‘Langthorne,” and the little gurnard. The head of the gurnard is armed with bows, so compactly framed as to re- mind one of a knight in armour. It has also three rays at the base of the pectoral fin, which help it to find food. The red gurnard is caught in trawls on the west coast of England at all seasons of the year. It is usually about a foot long, and feeds principally on small shell-fish.

There is a superstition connected with these spots suggesting that they are marks left by the thumb and forefinger of St. Peter, when taking tribute money out of the mouth of a fish of this species.

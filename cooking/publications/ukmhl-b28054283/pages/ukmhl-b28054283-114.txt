In spite of all that is said by these numerous and weighty authori- ties, it is necessary to notice that there are two varieties of the Crustacea which form the subject of the inquiry. One lives entirely in fresh water and is like a miniature lobster. The other inhabits the sea, and although somewhat like the lobster, it can easily be distinguished from it. It is contended that the former should properly be called the crayfish, and the latter the crawfish. Crayfish.—Not to be confounded with the craw- fish, were much esteemed by the ancient Greeks and Eomans, and are now considered a great delicacy. They bear a resemblance to miniature lobsters, and are found in many British rivers, but only at certain times of the year. They abound in districts where the soil yields an abundance of calcareous matter. They dislike heat and sunshine and are discovered more readily in the cool of the evening. In the winter time they may often be found on the banks of a stream, as they require a large quantity of air. They are very voracious and devour greedily all sorts of refuse. When food is scarce in the water, they often w^ander inland in search of vegetables, but they prefer snails, which they eat shell and all, and they often kill and devour each other. Crayfish are caught in several ways, sometimes in nets baited with frogs, or simply drawn out by the hand from their burrows in the river bank. On the Continent they are eaten in great quantities. Paris alone consumes annually from five to six millions. There are many ways of cooking them. They are made into soups (potage bisque), stewed, potted, or cooked in jelly,

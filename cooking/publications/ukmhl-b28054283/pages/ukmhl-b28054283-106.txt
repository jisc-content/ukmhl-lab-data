COD I [cod 72 of cocoa-nut ice, chips, candy, toffee, biscuits and tablets. Codfish.—A favourite fish, both fresh and salted; sometimes also dried. In the salted form it is largely consumed during Lent. It grows to a large size, weighing from fourteen to forty pounds, and is principally caught off the coast of Newfoundland, which is one of its favourite haunts as it retires to the Arctic Ocean to spawn. It is, however, also to be found off the shores of Ireland, Scotland, the Orkney Islands, Norway, and the West of England. The regular fishing season commences in April, but in consequence of storms, ice and fogs, many con- sider May quite early enough. The crimson bank cod varies in size; the average length being two and a half to three feet, and the weight between twenty and fifty pounds. The tongue of a cod is considered a delicacy, and in Newfoundland is rolled together with the sound or swimming bladder; the roe pickled or smoked is a favourite delicacy. Every part of the cod seems to be of use : the liver produces the well-known medicinal oil; the intestines are converted into a wholesome dish by French fishermen ; and the Norwegians, Icelanders, and Kamschatkans pound up the bones and skin to feed their animals.—{See Cod’s Sounds and Cod’s Eoe.) Codlin.—This apple is largely grown in Kent and Devonshire, and is one of the choicest table or eating apples, especially the Kentish codlin, which is a delicious summer fruit. They grow to their greatest perfection on standard trees, and often attain a large size. They are somewhat of a lemon- shape, but ribbed, and are of a beautiful green colour, tinted with red, generally on one side only.

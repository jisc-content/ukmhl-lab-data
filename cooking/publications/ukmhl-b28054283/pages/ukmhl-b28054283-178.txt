jug] 144 [jUN That the ancients prized it veiy much may he gathered from the fact that they called it Zeus, king of eatable fish. Faber, or blacksmith, was another name which they gave it. The cloudy tints on its back probably earned for it this appellation. It is very voracious, eating all the cuttle-fish it can catch, notwithstanding the strength and power of resistance of the latter; it will also follow pilchards. The fish has good flesh, which, strange to say, im- proves much when about twenty-four hours have elapsed from the time it was caught. It is of a most peculiar shape, and can protrude its mouth to a very great extent. —This form of cooking consists of placing the meat in a jar with just enough water to cover it, then putting the jar into another vessel of water and boiling it. As the water in the jug can never become hotter than that in the saucepan, this method is employed to cook meat, such as hare, which requires a very equal temperature. Julienne.—A soup which owes its distinctive character to its containing vegetables cut into thin strips about an inch long. The stock must neither be too thick, nor too strong; the vegetables may be varied with the season, and ju'eserved kinds can be used in winter. A choice collection of these latter have been sun-dried in France, and can be obtained in England. Junket.—This favourite Devonshire dish consists of milk turned with rennet, to which is added on the top scalded cream, sugar and cinnamon. It can be eaten on cakes with fruit or jam as a dessert dish. The name was originally written Juncate, derived from the Latin Juncus, and the word, as used by Swift, and other English authors of that period.

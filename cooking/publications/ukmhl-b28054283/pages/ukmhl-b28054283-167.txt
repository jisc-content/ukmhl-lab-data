[hog hod] 133 latter of vineyards on the ])anks of the Moselle* JBeing the product of grapes growing at the utmost northern limit of successful vine culture in Europe, -their quality is very much affected hy variations of olimate. In a successful season, when the grapes have thoroughly matured, they equal other v/ines in “bouquet” and flavour, but they are especially liable to be damaged either by a cold or a wet season. The annual produce amounts to about eighty million gallons. The best Khenish and Moselle wines are more acid, more cooling, and more suited to persons of a corpulent tendency, than the heavier, stronger, and more astringent wines from Spain. Hocheim, on the river Main, a tributary of the Rhine, has long been noted for the excellence of the wine produced in its neighbourhood, and it is from this town that hock received its name. The kind of hock produced at Johannisberg is considered “the king of German wines.” A vineyard w^as planted here about 1009, under the direction of an Arch- bishop of Mayence. This vineyard was destroyed during the Thirty Years’ War, in the first half of the seventeenth century, but w^as replanted by the Abbot of Fulda, in 1722. Moselle is a very light wine, with a delicate, aromatic flavour. Latterly Moselle wines have been artificially flavoured with musk, or with elder flowers, to imitate the flavour of the muscat grape, and this is now too often carried to such an excess as to spoil the natural taste of the wine.

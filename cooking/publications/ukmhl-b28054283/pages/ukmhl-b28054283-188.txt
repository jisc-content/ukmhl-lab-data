[leg 154 leg] generally boiled down into stock. In France, leg of beef is converted into the very popular bouillon, which can be obtained at most refreshment rooms for travellers. A most nutritious and palatable soup can be prej^ared from leg of beef with the addition of a few vegetables and a little sauce. Leg of Lamb. The leg of lamb somewhat re- sembles the leg of mutton, but is much more tender. Even when the leg is cut from a tolerably large lamb, it should be served 'with piquant, rather than with lich, or hot, sauces, as these latter would destroy the delicate flavour of the meat. Leg of Mutton. The leg is considered one of the best parts of the shee^^; it is generally roasted or boiled, as a joint, but occasionally what are called mutton steaks are cut from it. It is sometimes salted and smoked, and, under the name of mutton hams, is largely consumed on the Continent and in the north of England. Leg of mutton, when roasted, is sometimes stuffed under the skin of the knuckle with various sj)ices, whose flavours j)ervade the joint Avhen it is cooked. The knuckle is esteemed a delicacy, but it is hard and somewhat indigestible; in former times it was stewed as a sej)arate dish, but that is not often done now. Boiled mutton is rather tasteless, and hence is almost always eaten with sauces, notably caper sauce, with which its name has long been associated. Log of Pork. The leg of pork is one of the best parts for roasting, as it is not too fat. The skin should always be rubbed over with salad oil, which makes it crisp when cooked. This joint is eaten with seasoning of sage and onions, which is some- times stuffed under the skin of the knuckle, but there is hardly room for the quantity required.

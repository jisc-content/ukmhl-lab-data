Wheatear, or Clodhopper.â€”This little bird, also called the Fallowchat, is highly esteemed for the table, especially in London, the Sussex watering places, and on the Continent. Its winter retreat is in the countries bordering on the Mediterranean, chiefly in Africa, and its summer migrations extend to the northernmost parts of Europe, Iceland and Greenland. It is also found migrating from Asia Minor and Persia, to Siberia and Alaska. It arrives in this country about the beginning of March, and takes its leave of us about the end of September. In the southern parts of our island it makes its nest in April, seeking some underground lodging, such as a crevice in a heap of stones or old wall, a rabbit burrow, or underneath a clod of earth. It never excavates a shelter for itself, but merely furnishes such retreats as it can find. It is recorded that one built its nest for several years in an old cannon, where it was not disturbed. The South Down shepherds catch them by means of nooses placed in little excavations made in the ground, and one shepherd and his boy often have from five hundred to seven hundred of these traps to attend to. Pennant records that more than a centurj^ ago eighteen hundred dozen of wheatear were annually snared near Eastbourne, and usually sold at six- pence per dozen. Markwick, the naturalist, was told of a shepherd who once caught eighty-four dozen in one day, but where hundreds of dozens were formerly snared, a few only are taken now.

Watercress.—This, as the name implies, is an aquatic plant, and belongs to the great order Crnci- fcne, so rich in plants celebrated for anti-scorbutic properties. It is useful in rheumatic complaints on account of the potash salts, and the trace of iodine which it contains. It is a popular ingredient in salads, and may be eaten alone with bread and butter. Originally it was found growing wild in our own country, but it has been cultivated for the market since 1808, much care being required be- cause it must be grown in clear running water, and the intrusion of weeds, like it in appearance but of a poisonous nature, must be prevented. Watercress requires a depth of water about three inches, the plant being disposed in rows, to permit of the free ‘ circulation of the water. Twice a year the beds ought to be entirely cleared, the weeds destroyed, the older growth of the plant removed, and the bed replanted with young shoots and roots which are simply laid on the bottom, with a stone placed on them to keep them in position; three months’ growth is required to bring these beds into cutting- condition. There are three varieties of watercress, the green leaved, small brown leaved, and the large brown leaved; each have good qualities, but the last named is most in favour.

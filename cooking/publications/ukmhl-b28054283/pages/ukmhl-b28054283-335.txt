In the winter time this fish is sometimes sold under the peculiar name of ‘‘huckhorn,” which is simply the ordinary whiting caught in Cornwall, salted and dried. Whole Meal Bread. —This bread is made of flour from wdiich none of the exterior husk of the corn has been removed. It is of a brownish grey colour, and is generally made rather moist in order to prevent it becoming hard. It is extremely nu- tritious, as it contains all the natural constituents of the wdieat, and nothing is added to it or taken from it, in order to give the bread an artificially white colour. The use of whole meal bread has largely increased during recent years, but it is not likely to supersede that made from ordinary flour, as it is somewhat heavy, and does not agree with all persons. Widgeon.—This well-known bird belongs to the same family as the wild duck. Its flesh is so much esteemed by many that large quantities are caught in decoys and sent to market. This bird is a native of the northern regions of Europe and Asia, breed- ing in Lapland, Sweden and Norway, wdience, on the approach of winter, vast flocks wing their way southwards, visiting Holland, Germany, France, Spain and Italy. In the British Islands it arrives about the beginning of October, visiting our inland marshes, bays and mouths of rivers. The flocks, while on the wing, utter during their flight a peculiar whistling call-note, by which the fowler easily dis- tinguishes them during the night. Early in March they begin their polar migration, and by the month of April our morasses and shores are deserted.

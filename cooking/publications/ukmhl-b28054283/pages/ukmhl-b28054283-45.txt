Asparagus.—This is a very wholesome and favourite vegetable, but is chiefly consumed by the well-to-do classes, at a rather high price, on account of the great expenditure of time, care, and fertilising materials it requires for a comparatively small return. It is abundant in the temperate regions of both hemispheres, and is found in the tropics of gigantic size. It was a great favourite amongst the ancient Eomans, and is now largely cultivated in England. An island on the coast of Cornwall is called Asparagus Island, which is suggestive of the plant being plentiful there. It is extensively culti- vated in France and Germany, but epicures consider the English thin shoots the finest. Asparagus is cooked in various ways, of which one is to boil it until the white part of the stem is thoroughly tender; the asparagus is then cut into convenient lengths, and fried in a batter made with flour, eggs and cream, whereby a very tasty asparagus omelette is prepared. Asparagus is extremely easy of digestion, and is especially suited to the taste and constitution of aged persons and invalids, since it exerts a gently stimulating action upon the kidneys. Aspic.—This is the name of a savoury kind of jelly or glazing used as an outside moulding for cold poultry, game, or fish.

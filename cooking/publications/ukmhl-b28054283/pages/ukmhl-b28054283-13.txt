COCA, or CUCA, as the Indians call it, must not be confounded with Cocoa, The Coca, or Cuca, Plant (Eiytliroxylon) has been of late extensively used in England, producing marvellous results. Dr. Archibald Smith says that Coca “ increases energy, removes drowsiness, enlivens the spirits, and enables the con- sumer to bear cold, wet, great bodily exertion, and even want of food, to a surprising degree.” Dr. Albert Buck, Dr. Isaac Ott, Prof. Christian, Van Tschudi, Markham, and many other savants, express themselves in terms equally favourable. These Biscuits are a delicious and innocuous form of Con- fectionery, invaluable to Travellers, Cyclists, Cricketers, and Sportsmen. PRICE 1/- PER LB. SAMPLE BOXES SEXT POST FREE FOB TWELVE STAMPS.

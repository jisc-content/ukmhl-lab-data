BENj 231 [RIB These deer are to the Laplanders of great value, supplying them with food, clothing, and transport. Rennet. — Consists of the specially-prepared stomach of a calf, used to coagulate milk for making cheese. If a piece of rennet be placed in hot water, and allowed to soak for some hours, the liquor will then readily curdle milk. A similar result can be obtained from the membrane lining the gizzards of fowls and turkeys, which is called gallino. In India the fruit of a particular plant is called “vegetable rennet,” because of its possessing like properties. Rhubarb.—The rhubarb of our gardens is derived from different species of rheum, the parts used being the hind-ribs of the leaves and the leaf-stalks, which are used for puddings and tarts, and for stewing. Ehubarb requires an open situation and a rich deep soil. A plantation of rhubarb is formed thus :— the old roots are so divided that each contains a crown; these are planted about two inches below the surface, and three or four feet apart each way, when they will afford a supply the following spring. In gathering, the stalks are bent downwards and pulled off sideways, but not cut. The flower-stems are cut off as soon as they appear, in order to strengthen the root. Ehubarb can be grown from seeds, but it will yield nothing suited for use until two years after the sowing of the seed. Ehubarb is also forced in hot-beds. Ribs of Beef.—The joints called ribs of beef are cut from the back of the animal, between the neck and the sirloin; they are divided into the fore rib, by which is meant the neck, containing five ribs ; the middle rib, containing four; and the chuck rib, which contains three, and lies next to the sirloin.

ald] 3 [alm Alderman’s Walk.— The name given to the under cut of a sirloin of beef, in consequence of a supposed especial liking for it by city aldermen. Whether this allegation is true or not, it is certain that considerable quantities of beef are consumed by the city fathers at their various festivities, and perhaps observant guests have had an opportunity of witnessing aldermen “ walking into ” the undercut of the sirloin. Allspice.—Also called Jamaica Pepper, or Pimento. Much used in making curry powder, and in flavouring gravies, potted meats, mulled wine and other drinks. It grows chiefly in Jamaica, and is called allspice because its smell and taste resemble a combination of cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves. It is rather larger than black pepper but less pungent. An essential oil and medicated water are distilled from it, both of which are used as stimulant carmin- atives, and to conceal the flavour of other medicines. Almond.—A fruit much appreciated, and used for a variety of culinary purposes. It is the fruit of a tree somewhat resembling the peach in appear- ance, and will grow in sheltered places even in a temperate climate. It is cultivated in Spain, Italy, and the South of France. There are two kinds of almonds, the sweet and bitter. The best sweet are called Jordan almonds, and come from Malaga, an inferior sort being imported from Valentia. Bitter almonds are mostly from Mogadore ; though they contain the principle of prussic acid, they are harm- less if eaten in moderation, and mixed with the sweet variety are chiefly used in confectionery. Ground with sugar, they form the ingredients for macaroons, the “ Almond Paste ” on wedding cakes, and the celebrated German marzipan. Pounded B

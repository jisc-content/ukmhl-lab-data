Baking.—Baking is distinguished from boiling by the fact that in the former process the food is cooked by a dry heat; while in boiling, simmering, and stewing it is cooked in water. Baking is also distinguished from broiling, frying and roasting, since by these methods the food is cooked whilst fully exposed to the air, baking being conducted in an oven or some other more or less closed structure in which the action of the dry heat is modified by the presence of the steam from the food. Bread has been baked from immemorial antiquity. We read in the Scriptures of Sarah cooking her cakes upon the hearth. Lot did bake unleavened bread more than three thousand six hundred years ago ; Pharaoh had his baker; and in the ceremonial law given by Moses to the ancient Jews, they were distinctly directed to bring cakes “ baken in the oven.” In modern times, bread is baked in a large baker’s oven, built up with bricks, like a deep recess in the walls, fuel being burned in the oven till it attains a certain heat, when the fire is withdrawn, the oven brushed out, and the dough is put in to be baked. Home-made bread is generally baked in a bright metal oven, fitted up permanently at the side of the fire-place : it is also baked in what is called a French oven, that is, an iron pot with a lid, hung by a hook over the fire, and burning coals or logs of wood are heaped over the lid, so that the loaf of bread is cooked both at top and bottom at the same time. Ovens heated by hot air are now much used for baking bread on a large scale, and these are far more cleanly, etc., than the old ovens heated by burning fuel.

wil] 302 [wiL. Wild Boar.—The flesh of the wild boar is finer than that of the pig, and is generally eaten flavoured with truffles and pistachio nuts. The wild boar belongs to the family of hard-skinned, non-ruminat- ing mammals. In size it is equal to the largest of the domestic kind, but it surpasses them in its great strength and ferocity. It is greyish black in colour, having woolly hair interspersed with very stiff bristles, forming a kind of mane along its spine ; its canine teeth are so developed as to prove most formidable tusks. The wild hoar is found in the forests and marsh lands of the temperate regions of Europe and Asia. Professor Vambery also met with it in Turkestan. Sometimes it is found alone, sometimes herding together for defence against the wolves. The wild hoar seeks its food at night, feeding on roots, which it digs up with its snout; also on grain, eggs and even the young of other mammals. Where truffles abound its flesh obtains a peculiarly delicate flavour. Hunting the boar has always been a favourite diversion, and in India, where it is classed with “big game,” it is hunted on horseback with spears. So highly were wild hoars prized in the Middle Ages, that in the reign of William the Conqueror anyone found killing one was liable to have his eyes put out. Wild Duck.—This bird is also called the Mallard, and is highly esteemed for the table. It has a different flavour from the tame duck, with occa- sionally a fishy taste. It is distinguished from the tame duck by the colour of its feet being red, while those of the tame ducks arej^ellow’. The mallard makes its appearance in this country in large flocks about October, when, immediately after its arrival, it is subjected to persecution in every possible way.

Another way is to rub a mixture of various salts, and occasionally sugar, into the meat at intervals until the pickling is completed. The process of pickling varies, not only in different countries but also in different parts of the same country. Pie.—An admixture of meat and potatoes or fruit, covered with a paste and baked. The most familiar are steak and kidney, veal and ham, game, pigeon, and fruit. Of the varieties of pies there is no end, and the celebrated cook, Soyer, could not enumerate them. The most ancient form of pie is the pasty, which is made without a dish, and is still popular in Cornwall. Pig. —The pig is almost indifferent as to the kind or quality of the food it eats. Though it is nothing like an epicure, it will give the preference to a carrot, or other succulent plant, and when this is consumed, it will turn, with equal gusto, to some vile refuse disdained by other animals. This glut- tony, and its slovenly habits, make it particularly liable to disease, hence it has earned the pseudonym of ‘‘ unclean animal,” and hence also probably was the reason that in the Mosaic law the use of pig’s flesh was forbidden. Putting aside these unpleasant characteristics, it proves itself in domestic economy one of the most useful and profitable animals ; every part of its flesh is employed for food, fresh, salted or dried. Even the viscera are useful; the skin, the hair, and the fat also are all made to serve some useful purpose. Though its intellectual quali- ties are disj)uted, we have heard of, and actually seen, performing pigs ; moreover, in France, they become a useful companion to the truffle hunter.

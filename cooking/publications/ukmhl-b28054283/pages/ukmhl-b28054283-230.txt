[pat 19G PARJ Parson’s Nose.—A name by which the extreme end of the tail of poultry is sometimes known, originating in the days when wealthy pluralists grew fat, thus giving an appearance to their noses similar to this part of the fowl; and undoubtedly the name was originally given in derision. Partridge.—Some kind or other of this bird is found nearly all over the world. The English is the best for eating, and is much finer than the French, which latter is known by the redness of its legs. It is a sportsman’s bird, and welcome to the table. The birds pair, after contests of great severity among the males in the presence of the hens, who take the conquerors as their mates. Both birds are devoted parents, the male assisting in ob- taining the ants’ eggs and other articles of food with which the young at first are fed; later on, like the adults, they feed on grubs and slugs till the autumn, when the gleanings in the corn stubble supply their wants. The young remain with the old birds, and these coveys attach themselves to par- ticular fields or places, returning to them even after having been frightened away. Growing corn is a favourite resort for these birds, affording cover for the young; in the open grass and in the stubble it is very difficult to detect them, so closely do they sit, and so well does the colour of their plumage blend with their surroundings. The rising flight, however, of the partridge is accompanied by its characteristic “ whur.” In the winter they resort to upland pastures, water meadows, and coppices. The partridge shares with its relation, the ir v.’ing, the art of simulating injury to deceive intnu.ors as to the location of the brood. Pate de Foie Gras.—This world-renowned deli- 4

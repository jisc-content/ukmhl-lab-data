Sea Bream.—Sometimes called Gilt head, from the occasionally golden hue of its head, more ad- mired for its handsome appearance than as an article of food. The body is reddish, tinged with grey, becoming lighter at the sides, and white below. It is plentiful on the shores of Cornwall, and on the southern coast, where the market, especially in Hastings, is well supplied with it during the sum- mer months.

The roots (called eringo, or eryngo, roots), were formerly candied, and sold as a sweetmeat for per- fuming the breath, under the name of “ kissing comfits.” These roots were first candied about the year 1600 by an apothecary at Colchester, named Buxton. In his “Merry Wives of Windsor,” Shakes- peare represents Falstaff as saying: “ Let the sky . . . hail kissing-comfits and snow eringoes.” Sea Kale.—This is considered a delicacy as a vegetable, because it partakes of the flavour of the cauliflower, as well as of the asparagus, to which family it belongs. Although it was of no great re- pute until the }^ear 1794, it is now much cultivated in this country; it will grow in any kind of soil if there be plenty of manure in it. The plant grows wild on

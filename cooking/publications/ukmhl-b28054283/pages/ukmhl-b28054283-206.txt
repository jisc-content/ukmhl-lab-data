[mea 172 mea] Mead—Is a thin, but luscious fermented liquor made from bonejq with the addition sometimes of a little spice. Among the ancient Celtic races this liquor held a very bigb place, but it is now much less patronised then formerly. It was in general use from very ancient times among the polished nations of southern Europe, as well as among the barbarous tribes of more northern regions. Pliny said it had all the bad qualities of wine without its good ones. When well made and properly kej)t, it is said to equal the celebrated Tokay in strength and flavour; but that panegyric is somewhat doubtful. Sack-mead contains hops, and metheglin or hydro- mel is a kind of mead containing hops, the fermen- tation of the honey and water having been produced by the addition of yeast. Hollinshed, in his ^‘Chronicle of Ancient Britain,” speaks disparagingly of the mead made in Essex as differing “ from the true metheglin as chalk from cheese,” while he states that the Welsh made as much of their metheglin as the ancient Greeks did of their am- brosia or nectar. In the court of the ancient British kings, the meadmaker claimed the eleventh grade in precedence, his land was freehold, and he was entitled to certain royal gifts. Sharon Turner imblishes an ancient “Mead Song” written in Welsh more than 1,300 years ago, by Taliesin. He speaks of mead “ Which the bees provide, but do not enjoy, Mead distilled I praise; its eulogy is everywhere.” And then he pleads fOr the liberation of a captive because he was “the man that gave me wine, ale and mead.” In later days we find Chaucer, in one of his “ Canterbury Tales,” describing spiced ale

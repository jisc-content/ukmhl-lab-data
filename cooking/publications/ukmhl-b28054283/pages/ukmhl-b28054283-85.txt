It is curious that Avhile they are employed in this country for sweets they are in Germany principally used for savoury dishes, and in the production of the favourit(3 Eussian and German liqueur, “Kiimmel.” Although so much like a seed in appearance, they are the dried fruit of the plant on which they grow. The so- called caraw^ay seeds depend for their aromatic qualities upon a volatile oil, which is separated from them by the process of distillation and used in medicine as a carminative.

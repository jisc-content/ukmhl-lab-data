'roa 234 no a] “jack,” or spit, placed before the fire, it being thus possible so to cook joints that every side is finished at the same time, a result which could not be achieved by broiling. Boasting was originally performed by putting the joint on a spit placed horizontally before the fire and turned by hand, the humble functionary who performed this office being a boy called a turn- spit. At one time this task was performed by dogs of a breed similar to the dachshound, also called turnspits, who worked in revolving cages, similar to those in which squirrels are often kept, but this was abolished by an act of Parliament which forbade dogs being employed for any work whatever, except by shepherds and sportsmen. Since then the clock- work jack has been invented, which enables the operation to be performed in a much more regular manner. Boasting is not so economical a method of cooking as boiling, because there is on an average from five to ten per cent, more loss in the weight of meat prepared by this j^rocess ; but the fat which drips from a joint in roasting can be used for many purposes in cookery, and roast meat is more substantial than boiled. A fire for roasting should not be too fierce, as that would scorch the meat, which requires to be frequently basted with the dripping or fat exuding during the process. Roasting-Jack.—An implement made of metal in the shape of a bottle, hence it is sometimes called a bottle-jack. It contains a spring which, when wound up by clockwork, revolves a small fly- wheel to which are attached one or more hooks. On these are hung the meat or poultry to be roasted. The revolving spindle prevents one part being cooked more than another. A similar contrivance has been invented which is placed in the chimney

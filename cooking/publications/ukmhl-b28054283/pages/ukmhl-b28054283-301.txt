Spruce beer is brewed to a small extent in England, but the demand for it is not very great. Steaming.—This method of cooking is not gene- rally employed. It has, however, a right to be recognised as a separate way of preparing food, for, although substances steamed have the aj)pearance of being boiled, they avoid the long soaking in water which boiling necessitates. Steaming is generally used to cook vegetables, for which purpose a cir- cular vessel, having holes in admit the steam, is placed over a saucepan of boiling liquid, in which other food may be cooked at the same time. The vegetables are placed in the upper vessel, and, when meat is boiled in the saucepan beneath, the vege- tables above absorb its flavour through being cooked in the steam. Stewing.—This is the cooking of food in water, or other fluid, raised to a high temperature, but kept below that of boiling point. Food thus cooked remains on the fire for a much longer time than when boiled, and imparts a large j)roportion of its goodness to the liquor that comes from it. Only suflicient fluid is used to cover the meat or fruit and to prevent evaporation; the stewpan is only about half the height of a saucepan of the same diameter. Stirabout.—This is an Irish dish, and, as its name suggests, should be constantly stirred about while it is being made, differing chiefly from Scotch porridge in being of a thinner consistence. Three pints of water should be boiled in a clean saucejDan

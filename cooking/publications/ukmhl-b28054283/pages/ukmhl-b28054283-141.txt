107 [fee fon] Fondue.—A very savoury and tasty dish, origi- nally introduced by the Swiss. It is made by beat- ing up the required number of eggs, and cooking them in a saucepan with butter and cheese (Par- mesan, Gruyere, or Cheshire), and seasoned with pepper and salt. Forbidden Fruit.—{See Shaddock.) Forcemeat.—This consists of fowl, veal, or other meats, or sometimes fish, cho^Dped fine and mixed with bread-crumbs, suet, condiments or panada. {See article under that title.) It is used as balls or stuffing. Fore Quarter of Lamb.—Lamb is differently cut up according to its age. When young it is simply cut into quarters, but when large it is divided into the same joints as mutton. The fore quarter of young lamb is generally considered the best joint, and consists of the shoulder, breast and neck. It is most frequently roasted, and served with mint sauce, peas and new potatoes. Frangipane, or Franchipane.—An excellent substitute for custards. It is made with eggs, well beaten up, to which is added a considerable propor- tion of milk containing a small quantity of flour, sweetened with sugar, and flavoured with grated lemon-peel, rum or brandy, with the addition of vanilla, orange-flower water, or coffee. It is cooked in a saucepan till slightly browned, and turns to a creamy consistence. The French often use it for covering fruit tarts. Freezing.—Ice is of great service in making frozen sweetmeats, in preserving cold dishes and uncooked food at a proper temperature, and in freezing meat and fish, so that it can be transported long distances without becoming tainted.

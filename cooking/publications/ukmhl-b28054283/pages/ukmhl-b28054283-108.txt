74 [col are, curiously enough, many people who object to chicory who will pay a high price for the “ Best French Coffee,” which generally contains it. Coffee was in- troduced into England by a Turkey merchant named Daniel Edwards, whose servant, a Greek named Pasqua, opened the first coffee-house in George Yard, Lombard Street, London. It was then a very expensive drink, as the unroasted berries were from four to five guineas a pound. Coffee has often been erroneously supposed to be injurious, while, on the- contrary, it has been used as a disinfectant. It is related of Voltaire that when a physician told him it was a slow poison, he replied that he had drank it for nearly eighty years, and it had not killed him yet. Colewort, vulgarly called “ Collard,” is a very succulent and nutritious vegetable. It is a cabbage sown in June or July, to be ready for planting out late in autumn or the beginning of winter. The sorts used are the rosette and the hardy green; they are eaten when the leaves are open and before the hearts are formed. The colewort, or collet, is said to have been originally the name of the wild plant from which all the cultivated varieties of cabbage are derived, yet, when asked for in the market it may not be known, as the name is fast getting obsolete. Collaring.—To collar meat it should be put into a pickle of salt and saltpetre, with some sugar, and should be rubbed with the pickle every day for a week at least. A layer of herbs and spice should then be j)laced on it and it should be rolled up, very tightly tied in a cloth, and boiled. When cooked it should be placed under a heavy weight until cold, before the cloth is removed.

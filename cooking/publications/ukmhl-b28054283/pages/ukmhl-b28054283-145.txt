FHO] ^11 used for pancakes, either by dropping a small quan- tity into a pan with boiling butter oi fat, oi by dipping thin slices of ripe fruit into the batter and frying them. Spanish fritters are made from the crumb of the French roll, cut into a shape, soaked in cream, with the addition of egg, nutmeg, sugar and powdered cinnamon.

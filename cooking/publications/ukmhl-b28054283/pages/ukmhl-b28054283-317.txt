If carefully boiled the mixture will soon thicken, and may then be flavoured with essence of almonds, lemon or vanilla, as may be preferred. As soon as it becomes frothy, it must be poured quickly into a flat dish, and, while hot, cut into squares or . any shape desired. A less expensive sweetmeat may be made by boiling over a slow fire equal quantities of brown sugar and good butter; a very little vinegar may be added to give it a nice acid flavour. To know exactly when the toffee is done, drop a little into cold water, and if sufficiently boiled, it will immediately set, while, if it do not, the boiling must be continued. So great has been the consump- tion of this sweetmeat that some people have raised large establishments for its manufacture and sale, and have even attained renown for their goods; the Everton toffee, for instance, being very w^ell known.

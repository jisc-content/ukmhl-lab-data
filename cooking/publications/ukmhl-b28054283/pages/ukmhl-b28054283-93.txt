[CHE 59 che] produces some good cheese, hut a prejudice exists here against Dutch cheese ou account of its low price. °The best Dutch Edam cheese, winch always fetches a high price at home, does not find its way into the English market, possibly owing to the iire- judice that Dutch cheese must be cheap, and for that reason cannot be good. Gouda is prepared in Holland from skimmed milk, curdled with muriatic acid instead of rennet, which prevents its being in- fested with mites. Parmesan (named after Parma, in Italy) owes its fine flavour to the rich herbage on which ^ the cows are fed, and to the saffron with which the cheese is coloured. Parmesan cheese is compared to Stilton, but is inferior to it. Roque- fort cheese is made from ewes’ milk. Gruyere and other Swiss cheeses are flavoured with herbs. Brie cheese is a soft, rich cheese, made in France, having a white or creamy colour, veined wdth blue. The richest milk onl}’’ is used in making it, and care is taken to strain it at once and then to add the rennet immediately, so as to produce the curd before the cream has time to separate from the milk. As soon as the curd is formed, the whey is drawn off, and the curd at once placed in a mould that permits the remaining whey to drain out. When sufficiently firm the cheeses are salted on both sides, and after having been exposed in the drying-room to currents of air, they will become covered, in about a month’s time, with a fungus, white at first, but turning blue with red points, which is a peculiar parasite found upon decaying milk. Camembert, Limburg and Gorgonzola command a high price in this country. The competition in the manufacture of cheese is increasing, and has even reached New Zealand, which now sends us loaf cheese.

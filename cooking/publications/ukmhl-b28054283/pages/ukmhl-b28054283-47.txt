[liAI BAC] 13 have secured the approbation of the best judges in Europe, and there will be good markets in the Old World for the produce of her vintages. The home consumption is very great, and continually increas- ing ; in fact, the colonial wine has largely supplante-d the colonial beer in the harvest field, in cafes, and in private houses.” This prognostication has proved to be true, for in 1887, sixty-eight thousand one hundred and eighty-eight gallons of wine were ex- ported from Australia, of which a great portion has been consumed in England. Bacon.—The side and belly of a pig are called bacon, when salted and cured in a way similar to that which converts the leg of pork into ham. The whole side of a pig salted and smoke-dried is called a flitch of bacon. The streaky bacon comes from the belly of the pig. Boiled bacon is a common food among the poorer classes of our country dis- tricts, and when eaten with beans it is a very nutritious article of diet. When cut into slices, or rashers as they are generally called, and fried, either with or without eggs, it is highly esteemed for breakfast. Being fat and rich, it is, however, apt to disagree with delicate stomachs and bilious constitu- tions. In salting pork for bacon, care must be taken not to let the meat soak in brine ; dry salt must be repeatedly rubbed into the meat, and the liquor must be allowed to drain away. In some districts, saltpetre and sugar are used in addition to salt for preparing the meat to be smoke-dried. In Germany, it is so splendidly cured that the bacon may be eaten without any further cooking, and at Strasburg, bacon is thus prepared in very largo quantities.

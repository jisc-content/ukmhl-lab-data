( SHI she] 255 lobsters and crawfish inhabit a jointed shell, called a carapace, because it resembles a suit of armour rather than a shell; these have long feet, with two powerful claws, and their flesh is firmer than that of the molluscs. Oysters, scallops, mussels and cockles inhabit two shells, and are, therefore, called bivalves, while periwinkles and whelks occupy one shell only. Oysters, scallops and cockles are the most nutritious, and the most easily digested, of all the shell-fish. Oysters, scallops, and occasionally mussels and cockles, are eaten uncooked as well as cooked; other shell-fish are always boiled before being eaten. Oysters are more digestible uncooked, with the addition of a little lemon-juice, which is preferable to the vinegar usually taken with them, but mussels are specially indigestible when eaten raw. Whelks, periwinkles, cockles and mussels are usually boiled before passing into the hands of the retailers, and are then eaten cold; but if bought alive, then boiled and eaten hot, they are more easily digested. The ancient inhabitants of Greece and Italy highly esteemed shell-fish, and served them up at the beginning of the meal, either uncooked, fried, or cooked under ashes, and usually seasoned with cumin and pepper. The razor-fish is a bivalve shaped like the blade of a razor, for- merly considered especially delicious when broiled ; it is still eaten in some parts of England.

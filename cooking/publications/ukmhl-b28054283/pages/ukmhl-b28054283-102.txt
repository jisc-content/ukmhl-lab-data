68 cob] only as they become dry that they possess their powerful and aromatic flavour. Cob Nut.—The largest variety of the filbert or cultivated hazel. It is extensively grown in the county of Kent, and is a favourite addition to a dessert. Cochineal.—It is largely used in culinary operations to provide a bright red colouring for various articles of food, such as jellies, jams, red cabbage and pickle. Cochineal is an insect similar to our common lady-bird, which feeds upon a particular kind of cactus, in the same way as certain insects are commonly found in our country swarming and feeding upon the stems and buds of roses in hot, dry seasons. The cochineal insect is brushed off the cactus, killed by heat in various ways, and dried for export. The female insects alone yield the well-known colour, and in swarms of cochineal insects there are from one hundred and thirty to two hundred females to each male. The insect is so small that one pound of cochineal contains seventy thousand insects. The beautiful colours carmine and lake are both made from cochineal. Cochineal was first introduced into Europe from Mexico about 1523, and the Mexicans had cultivated both the insect and the nopal cactus on which it feeds before the discovery of their country by Europeans, but both are now more largely cultivated in Guatemala. After the failure of the vines in the Canary Islands through disease in 1858, both the cochineal insect and the nopal cactus were intro- duced there, and their cultivation has proved a great success in those islands. They are also successfully cultivated in Algiers, Java and Australia. The old East India Company offered a reward of ^6,000

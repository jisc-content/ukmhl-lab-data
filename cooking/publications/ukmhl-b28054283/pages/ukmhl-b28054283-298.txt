Spanish Wines.â€”The two principal wines of the Iberian Peninsula are Port and Sherry. The former owes its distinctive quality to its richness and sweetness, and received its name from Oporto,, the town whence it was originally exported. It is one of the most nourishing wines, frequently pre- scribed for persons in delicate health.

The vine, bearing small grapes, from which this wine is obtained, is itself not so large as that from which white wines are generally made, but the grapes are allowed to mature, and the sugar to develop, before gathering; therefore, when fermented, a larger quantity of alcohol is produced than is contained in other wines. Sherry possesses about 25 per cent, of natural spirit; but this is increased for the British market by bringing it up to from 32 to 40 per cent, by the addition of brandy. The wine, when new, is of a pale amber colour, harsh and fiery ; after vatting for some years, it mellows, deepens in colour, and improves both in flavour and quality, the improvement increasing every year until it is a quarter of a centuiy old, when it attains maturity.

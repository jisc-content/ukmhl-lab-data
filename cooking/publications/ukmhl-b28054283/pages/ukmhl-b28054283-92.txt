58 cha] [CHE Charlotte.—The name given to sweet dishes made of an outer case of bread, cake, or biscuits containing stewed apples, cream, wine and flavour- ings. Charlottes are generally made in moulds, but this is not alwa3"S necessary. Charlotte Rnsse.—A sweet entremet made by lining a mould with savoy biscuits fastened together with white of egg. The interior is filled with eggs beaten to a stiff froth with gelatine, to which are added liqueurs, wine and vanilla, or other flavourings.

Chaudfroid.—A dish of cold chicken or similar meat, cut into moderate-sized pieces, and dipped into a hot sauce of stock thickened with eggs and flour. Cheese.—Cheese is obtained from milk, and forms when new the principal nitrogenous food of manj^ labouring people. It is then nutritious, hut not very easy of digestion; while, when it is old, it rather promotes digestion. The qualities of the various descriptions of cheese are due in part to the pasturage of the animals that produce the milk, and in part to the varying proportion of butter fat allowed to remain with the caseine in the manufac- ture. Cream cheese and the rich-flavoured cheeses contain a large percentage of fat, while the hard skim-milk cheese has hut little. The caseine of cheese is the chemical equivalent of the white of (;gg, gluten of wheat, and the fibrin of meat, hlnglish cheeses are known as the Stilton, Cheddar, Cheshire, Wiltshire, Gloucester, and Derby. The United States and Canada are now trying to com- pete with our dairy farmers, and several excellent varieties are produced in those countries. Holland

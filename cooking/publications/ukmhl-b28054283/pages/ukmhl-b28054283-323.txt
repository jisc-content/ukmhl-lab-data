It may be either boiled or roasted; when surrounded with sausages it is called “an alderman hung in chains;” it may be boned, larded, stuffed and garnished with chestnuts, devilled, or formed into a great variety of other dishes. Truffled turkeys are consumed to a very large extent in Paris, where as many as three hundred are sold in one day. Though called turkey, after the country of that name, it is really a native of North America. It was introduced into England in the reign of Henry the Eighth, and soon grew in favour, having been a very popular dish in this eountry ever since, especially at Christmas time. Wild turkey are still found in America; their flesh has a deeper colour and a finer flavour than the domesticated bird. The flavour of a moderate-sized turkey is generally preferred to that of a large one, and age also makes a great difference in the quality. The older birds may be known by the roughness and redness of their legs, which in the younger are black and smooth. If fresh the eyes are clear and full, and the feet moist, which will not be the case if the bird has been killed some time. Turkish Delight, or Rabat Lakoum.—This delicious sweetmeat, so much liked by all sweet- toothed individuals, whether children or adults, is of Turkish origin, but is rapidly gaining ground as a favourite article of confectionery in other countries.

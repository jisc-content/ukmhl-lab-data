[nas 184 mut] Mustard is used for a variety of pui’i^oses, the chief being as a relish ; it is also used as a diuretic and as an emetic. Externally it is used in poultices and embrocations, as a counter-irritant. Mutton.—Mutton is the flesh of the sheep, and varies considerably in quality and flavour according to the district in which the sheep are reared and the breed to which they belong. It can be prepared for table in many ways, but is rarely salted, although mutton hams are cured in some countries. The name mutton is derived from the French, and dates back to the Conquest, when the Normans gave their names to the meat as it appeared at table, while the Saxon farmers continued to call the living animal by its accustomed appellation.—{See the different joints.) Mutton Chops.— There are three kinds of mutton chops—the loin, the chump (which are cut from near the tail of the animal), and the neck. The latter are generall}^ stewed or made into cutlets, while the two former are more often broiled and eaten with tomatoes, fried or boiled potatoes, and sauces, which thus form a very favourite dish for break- fasts, luncheons, or hastily-prepared repasts. An invitation to take a chop with anyone is generally understood to mean a simple meal. Nasturtium.—The nasturtium plant, sometimes called Indian cress, is a native of Peru, but has been acclimatised in Great Britain. The seeds have a pungent taste, and are often pickled. The unripe nasturtium seeds, when cut in halves and pickled, are sometimes called “ imitation capers,” and are used for making caper sauce. Nasturtium leaves and flowers are a pleasant addition to a salad, to the appearance of which they arc a great improvement.

[toa 282 toaJ made, dry toast should be, as its name denotes, dry and crisp. Buttered toast need not be so dry unless such be preferred, and if cut again after being buttered, each slice should be cut separately. A variety of toast was made in the last century similar to that which may be occasionally seen in old-fashioned houses. It is called French toast, and obviates the difficulty of handling hot buttered bread. The slices of bread are half the ordinary thickness, and toasted on one side only, the butter being spread on the untoasted side, and two slices are placed together sandwich fashion. In the six- teenth century toasted bread was a favourite addition to such English drinks as sack, and as the practice of drinking healths, particularly the health of the host, had become customary, these healths being drunk in liquor containing toasted bread, they were called “toasts.” It also became the custom to allude to a woman whose health was drunk as “ a toast.” This last use of the word is said to have originated from an incident which occurred at Bath, as recorded in the twenty-fourth number of the “ Bambler ” :—“ One * public day a celebrated beauty of these times (it was then customary for ladies to bathe publicly in elegant dresses) was in the Cross Bath, and one of the crowd of her admirers took a glass of the water in which the fair one stood, and drank her health to the company. There was in the place a gay fellow, half-fuddled, who offered to jump in, and swore that though he liked not the liquor he would have the ‘ toast.’ He was opposed in his resolution, yet this whim gave foundation to the present honour done to the lady we mention with our liquor who has ever since been called a ‘ toast.’ ”

The fruit of the pear is more elongated than the apple, at the end growing next to the tree, and varies greatly in size and quality. Some kinds of pear are no larger than a fresh gathered fig, others are almost as large as a cocoanut; some are mealy, like the kind of banana usually imported into this country ; others are soft and juicy ; while others again are as hard as the hardest apple. Pears will not keep so well as apples, the small, juicy kinds especially begin to decay very speedily after they have fully ripened.

POT j *218 [ por in the early part of the sixteenth century, at Quito, a town in South America, near the equator. They were brought to Spain by a monk named Hierony- mus Cardan, and in 1563 were brought to England by the celebrated navigator, John Hawkins. Ac- cording to Banks, however, this was the sweet potato (which see), an entirely different plant. In 1586, Sir Walter Ealeigh planted potatoes on his estate at Youghal, near Cork, and they have been extensively cultivated in Ireland ever since. It took some time to persuade Europeans to look upon the potato as an article of food; and prejudice was formerly heightened by the fruit above the ground being mistaken for the root, or rather tuber. This occurred in Germany, where it nearly caused a rebellion, even so late as the close of the last cen- tury. When Count Eumford distributed soup to the poor of Munich, he had to conceal from them that it was thickened with potatoes, so strong was their prejudice against this useful vegetable. Pot-au-Feu.—This is one of the most popular household institutions in France, especially amongst the peasantry, and deserves to be better known in other countries. It is a soup made from scraps of all kinds which have been left from the preparation of other dishes. These scraps are put into an earthenware pot placed near the fire, and to them is added gravy, or the water in which meat or veget- ables have been boiled, with seasonings of various kinds. These ingredients provide an excellent soup which can always be ready at a few minutes’ notice. This is the original w*ay of making pot-au-feu, but it may be made with fresh meat, vegetables and herbs, and then it comes to table as a broth, containing an unusually large proportion of meat.

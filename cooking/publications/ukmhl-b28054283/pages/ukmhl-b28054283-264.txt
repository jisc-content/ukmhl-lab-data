Refrigerator.—A kind of store chest or chamber containing ice, employed to maintain provisions at an equable or low temperature. It consists of a large metal box, placed inside another of w^ood; between the two there is a considerable space filled with sawdust or cotton, and lined with felt or other material as a non-conductor of heat. The inner box has a compartment filled with ice, and fitted with a drainer and pipe to carry off all water as the ice melts. The box also contains hooks and movable shelves, on which the provisions can be stored. When the lid of the refrigerator is closed, the temperature of the enclosed air is kept about freezing point, the non-conducting material which surrounds the box preventing the ice from melting quickly. The re- frigerators employed on steamers for bringing fresh meat from abroad to this country are constructed on the same principle, hut on a much larger scale. Reindeer.—The reindeer is an inhabitant of the Arctic regions, • and its venison is highly appre- ciated for its fine flavour; pounded, mixed with fat, and made into pemmican, it will keep for a long time. Reindeer tongues are considered a great delicacy, and as such are imported into this country. The whole structure of the reindeer varies from that of the rest of the deer tribe to suit the special conditions of its life; the cloven foot permits great division be- tween the toes, thus increasing the bearing surface when the weight of the body has to be supported on the snow ; this its broad antlers enable it to lemove, where the mosses on which it feeds are entirely covered thereby, and probably it is for this purpose that the female carries antlers as well as the male.

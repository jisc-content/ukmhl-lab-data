sca] 249 rscR were found to be covered with scallop shells. The custom of children collecting oyster shells in the London streets about the time of St. James’ day, piling them in a heap, and, shell in hand, soliciting a copper from each passer-by, has grown out of the same absurd superstition. Even at the present day a scallop shell is carried by pilgrims in Japan, but there the custom must have had some different origin. Scarlet Runner.—A climbing plant resembling French beans, the pods of which are eaten in the same way; they come, however, a little later in the season, and are a little coarser in flavour. Scarlet runners not being annual plants like the French beans, if the roots are dug up at the end of the season, preserved from frost, buried in sand, and replanted the following year, they will then produce beans rather earlier than those grown from seed. Scones.—These are cakes made with flour, water, and a little egg or baking-powder, cooked on a girdlrO or hot plate. They are a light and pleasant addition to the tea-table, either plain, toasted, buttered, baked with currants in them, or made with buttermilk ; originally they were made with barley- flour. The scones so largely used by the Scotch are thinner and closer in texture than those com- monly sold in our bakers’ shops. Scotch Eggs.—The name given to a dish of hard-boiled eggs (pullets’ eggs being preferred). The shells having been removed, the eggs are fried, after being covered with forcemeat containing scraped ham or anchovies. Scrag End of the Neck of Mutton.—{See Neck of Mutton.)

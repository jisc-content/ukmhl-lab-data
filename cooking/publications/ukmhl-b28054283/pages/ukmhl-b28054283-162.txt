Excellent hams are also produced in the well-known bacon districts of Wiltshire, Hampshire, Suffolk, Sussex, and Cumberland, in which latter county they are dried without smoke. Hand of Pork. This joint is the fore leg, and is generally sold with the foot attached. It is almost always salted, boiled, and eaten with peas- pudding to absorb the excess of salt flavour. It is also cured like bacon, and the part nearest the side of the pig is cut into slices, like rashers of ham. Hare.—This animal, which may be found in most of the Northern regions, is generally esteemed for the flavour of its flesh, although some nations regard it unclean. It has perhaps more enemies than any other animal; bats and weasels are its foes, birds of prey are continually trying to catch it, the sportsman is more dangerous than all, and the poor hare is snared, trapped, hunted, coursed, and shot. Unlike the rabbit, which burrows, it makes its home on the surface of the ground, assuming in some measure the same colour as this to avoid detection. Thus we find that in the Polar regions it becomes nearly white in winter, while in summer it turns to a brownish grey. The hare is frequently mentioned by writers of antiquity. Demosthenes uses the expression ‘‘to lead a hare’s life;” there is also a Greek proverb, “a hare’s sleep,” meaning a feigned sleep; as well as an adjective “ hare-eyed,” meaning unable to close the eyes. The phrase “ hare-lip,” is well known. Timid as the animal is, we find a familiar instance of the possibility of overcoming its aversion to human society, on referring to the gentle poet William Cowper and the history of his hares—Puss, Tiny, and Bess.

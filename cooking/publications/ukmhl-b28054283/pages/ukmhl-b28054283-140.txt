After that, it became customary to bray the grains of corn in a kind of mortar ; in a later age the corn was crushed between two heavy flat stones, the upper one being worked round by hand. In more recent times the corn has been ground in mills turned by water or by wind, but now these corn mills are chiefly worked by steam.

Larks.—These birds being considered a delicac}^ multitudes which separate on the a^iproach of spring are captured by means of nets, and sent to the London market. They belong to the family of finches, which compose a very numerous assemblage of conirostral birds. That delightful songster, the skylark, is spread generally over Europe, several parts of Asia and the north of Africa. Its favourite localities are extensive arable lands and open meadows ; but in Ireland the wild mountain pasture is equally its abode. The lark breeds in April or early in May; two broods are reared annually, the latter in July or August. On the approach of winter, larks begin to collect in immense flocks, increased as the severity of the weather sets in by foreign arrivals. They frequent stubble fields, turnip fields and similar situations. Their food consists of insects, worms, grain, with other seeds, and the leaves of the clover. Laver. (Seaweed.)—The lavers are of great benefit as articles of food for invalids who are able to take them; purple laver (porphyra vulgaris) is the one mostly liked, and is esteemed the best. On account of its gelatinous nature it is highly nutritious, and very palatable if served with lemon-juice. The green laver (ulva latissima), and the sea lettuce (ulva lactuca), are prejiared and eaten in the same way, and are most efficacious in the treatment of scrofulous disease. For the most part the lavers are of a pale- green colour, but the porphyra and bangia are exceptions, both these being of a deep purple. Purple laver is found at all seasons, in all kinds of localities ;

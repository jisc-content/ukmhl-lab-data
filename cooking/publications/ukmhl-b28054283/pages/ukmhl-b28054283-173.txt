As such it is held in high repute on the Continent as a remedy in the first stage of pulmonary complaints. Iceland-moss cocoa, or chocolate, forms a very nutritious beverage, but is not so much used now as formerly. Ices.—Ices derive their present great popularity from America, where they are consumed during the summer in enormous quantities, but they are said to have been originally introduced by Catherine de Medicis in the sixteenth century. They consist either of cream and fruit syrups, or water, mix- tures of cream and eggs, or a thin starch batter flavoured with the juice of fruits, frozen by various means to the consistence of snow. Ices are generally served in glasses, but the water ices known as the Neapolitan are made in blocks about four or five inches long, and one or two inches thick, each containing several different kinds of ice. Ices are also made in moulds of various shapes, generally representing the fruit with which they are flavoured. The materials for these are either thickened into a paste or half frozen before they are placed in the mould, when they are still further frozen until the requisite degree of hardness is obtained. These ices are served on embossed papers and laid in plates. Icing.—A white covering for cakes, made of powdered sugar, mixed with white of eggs, which, being spread over the top of the cake after it is baked, is then put into the oven to dry. Sweet- meats and ornaments may be placed on the icing before it becomes hard. It is frequently placed over a layer of almond icing. {See Almoxd Icing.)

Leveret.—The young hare, so called during its first year. The name is derived from the old French for the adult animal, ‘‘levre,” giving the diminutive ‘‘ levrette.” It is generally preferred roasted, and served with currant jelly, but it may be cooked in any way described for hares. The leveret begins feeding on its owm account three w^eeks after birth, finding its sustenance in herbage, cultivated vegetables, the young grain, plants of the fields, or the budding shoots and bark of nursing plantations. Keeping under cover during the day, it leaves its couch, as it is called, at night to search for food. Lime Fruit.—This closely resembles the lemon, but is smaller. It is even more tart than either the citron or the lemon, but its flavour is generally con- sidered more agreeable. Lime-juice is very largely imported into this country for the manufacture of citric acid, and for a cooling, antiscorbutic beverage. It forms an ingredient in the well-known ‘‘ Glasgow punch.” Lime-juice is generally considered superior to lemon-juice for all purposes. Lime-juice cordial, largely sold in bottles in this country during the summer months, is a very pleasant, wholesome, cooling beverage, made with purified lime-juice, sw^eetened. The tree on which the lime fruit grows is a native of Asia, but it has long been cultivated in the West Indies. It is quite different from the lime, or linden, tree which grow^s in this country and on the continent *of Europe, and which produces no edible fruit.

[MUS 183 MUS] which, like oysters, cockles and whelks, are in reality molluscs, and not fish at all. They inhabit two shells, and should be boiled in them as soon as pos- sible after being caught. When deprived of their beard, as it is called, they may be fried, escalloped, or stewed. Mussels are also pickled, and a sauce is made with them, in the same way as with cockles. Mussel ketchup is made by boiling them with spices in wine or cider. The prejudice against them is caused by many persons having been poisoned through eating them ; but probably this has been caused either by decay having commenced before they were boiled, by the mussels having fed on sewage or other contaminating matter, or by the beard not having been removed before they were eaten. They are very common on all the English coasts, and are especially plentiful at the mouth of the Mersey. They are farmed, in what are called mussel gardens, in some parts of the English coasts, as well as on the coast of France. Pearls of a common kind have been found in some varieties. Mussels are much used as bait for catching such fish as cod, haddock, ling, plaice, skate and w^hiting. Mustard.â€”Two species are in common use for domestic purposes, Siuajyis nigra and S. alba. The seeds of the former are of a dark reddish brown, wherefore it is called black mustard; it is grown in France to a greater extent than in England, and the young herbs are used in salads. The seeds of S. alba are yellowish, and known as white mustard. The flour of mustard in common use is prepared b}^ removing the husks and pulverising the seeds. It is differently prepared for the table according to the country in wdiich it is produced, the principal methods being the English, the French and the German.

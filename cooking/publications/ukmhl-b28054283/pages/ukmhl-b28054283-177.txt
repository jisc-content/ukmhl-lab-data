Jerusalem Artichoke.—This plant is a native of Brazil, and of the same natural order as the common sunflower. It grows from six to eight feet in height, has large, rough leaves, and yellow flowers.

Its name is supposed by some to be derived from the French words “jaune doree ” (golden yellow), as its body is beautifully marked with a gilded yellow.

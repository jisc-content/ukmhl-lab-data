BEC] 20 [bee the ancient philosophers of that country think of the nutritious quality of the beans that Pythagoras cynically forbade his disciples to eat them, calcu- lating on their disobedience, and by that means to increase their desire for them.—{See the Articles on the different .Beans.) Bechamel.—A sauce made of white stock, cream, arrowroot, spices, and herbs. Beef.—From time immemorial beef has been esteemed the most substantial food. Although an infinite variety of dishes can be made from it, it is generally cooked in the simplest manner. In the breeding of oxen upon scientific principles a good deal of money and time have been expended. These cattle vary considerably according to the country in which they are reared, but those fed on the rich low-lying pasturage afford the best beef, and are in their prime for the table when about five years old. —{See Different Joints). Beef, a-la-Mode.—This popular dish is sold in London at houses called a-la-mode beef houses. It is made from pieces of beef stewed, during which process flour is dredged into the water, forming a thick and nutritious gravy. It should be frequently stirred to prevent lumps forming, and various sauces and flavourings are added before it is done. A more elaborate method is to take a large piece of flank of beef, lay on it strips of bacon and seasoning, roll up tightly and stew with vegetables. Veal can be cooked in either of these ways. Beef Olives.—These are a very tasty made dish, and, like many others of the kind, are best made from meat which has already been cooked ; hence they are an excellent medium for serving up joints which have already appeared on the table.

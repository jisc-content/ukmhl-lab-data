It can be cooked according to most of the recipes given for game birds, but it requires to be drawn as soon as it is killed, or it would soon taint, and should be hung as long as possible to make it tender. There are several varieties of this bird, which vary in size from that of a small domestic fowl to that of a turkey. They are known as the red grouse, the black, the ruffled, the white (or ptarmigan), and the w^ood grouse or caper- cailzie, which is the largest variety. All grouse have short bills, but they are principally distinguished by having feathers growing on their legs and toes, and a broad naked red skin over each eye. Grouse are strictly preserved in the United Kingdom, and are reared principally in Scotland, wdiere the shooting, which is one of the principal sports, begins on the 12th of August.—{See the different varieties.)

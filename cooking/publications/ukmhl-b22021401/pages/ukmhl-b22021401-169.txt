ECONOMIST AND EPICURE’S CALENDAR. 159 some soft kinds of woods, especially when they have undergone a kind of fermentation, and become looser, might, by being subject to the action of the mill-stones, be probably used as food in the time of famine. Nor is it impro- bable,” continues our ingenious speculator, “ that hay which has been kept in stacks, so as to undergo the saccharine process, may be so managed, by grinding and by fermentation with yeast, like bread, as to serve, in part, for the sustenance of mankind in times of great scarcity.” Dr. Priestley gave to a cow, for some time, a strong infusion of hay, in large quantities, for drink, and found that she pro- duced, during this treatment, above double the quantity of milk. Hence, if bread cannot be made from ground hay, there is great reason to suspect that a nutritive beverage may be thus prepared, either in its saccharine state, or fermented into a kind of beer. In times of great scarcity, there are other vegetables, which, though not in common use, would most probably afford wholesome nourish- ment, either by boiling them, or drying and grinding them; or by both these processes in succession. Of these, perhaps, are the tops and barks of all those vegetables which are

THE HOUSEKEEPER’S ORACLE. 101 The Shank-bone, with a small portion of meat attached, is called a Spring; it is gene- rally boiled, and considered very good eating. A SPARE-RIB OF PORK. To carve a Spare-rib of Pork, cut out a slice from the fleshy part, in the line 1, 2;— many good cuts may be taken in this direction, with plenty of fat for those who prefer such strong meat. When the fleshy part is removed, it is easy to separate one bone from another, in the line 4, 2, 3, disjointing it at 3. The gravy of Pork being too strong for the gene- lality of people, it is mostly accompanied with Apple sauce.

268 the housekeeper’s oracle. merits, — Empires, Kingdoms, States, and Re- publics, are but Puddings of People differently mixed up. The Celestial and Terrestial Orbs are deci- phered to us by a pair of Globes, or Mathe- matical Puddings. The success of War, and the fate of Mo- narchies, are entirely dependent on Puddings and Dumplings—for what else are Cannon- balls but Military Puddings, or Bullets but Dumplings — only with this difference, they do not sit so well on the stomach as a good Marrow Pudding or Bread Pudding. In short, there is nothing valuable in Nature but what more or less has an allusion to Puddino- or O Dumpling. Some swallow every thing whole and un- mixed, so that it may rather be called a Heap than a Pudding. Others are so squeamish, that the greatest mastership in Cookery is required to make the Pudding palatable:—the Suet, which others gape and swallow by gobs, must for these puny stomachs be minced to atoms, the Plumbs must be picked with the utmost care, and every ingredient proportioned to the greatest nicety, or it will never go down.— From a learned Dissertation on Dumplings. 8vo. 1726, p. 20.

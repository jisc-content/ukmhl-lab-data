ECONOMIST AND EPICURE’S CALENDAR. 219 hour before you barrel it, as it should be bar- relled as clear as possible from the yeast. Take care to fill your barrels up with beer left for that purpose until it has done working, which may be ten days or a fortnight; —fit for drinking, if you like it mild, in six weeks or two months. Mem.—Take 18 Gallons from a Bushel for Table beer, and it is a very pleasing family beer. This Beer should not be worked more than 24 hours.

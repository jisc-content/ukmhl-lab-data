270 the housekeeper’s oracle. salt, which keeps the sea from putrefaction — salt, which is made the image of intellectual excellence, contributes to the formation of a Pudding.”— Boswell’s Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides with Dr. Johnson. 8vo. 1785, p. 440. Omelette. Chop very fine as much Onion as will about half fill a Tea-spoon, and the same of Parsley ; put it into a Basin with a little salt — break six eggs, putting the yolks into the basin, (and the whites into a very cold dish); add a quarter of a pint of Cream, and mix all well together. Now beat the whites of the Eggs with a Knife into a very strong froth, and let it stand an hour, — then take it off the dish lightly, so as to leave the sediment behind; and, putting it into the Basin, beat all together. Put an ounce of Butter into an Omelette Pan : when this is melted, put in the contents of the Basin, and keep well stirring it about till it sets, then form it into an oval or round shape, and fry it of a delicate brown on one side only. Send it up to table with the browned side upwards, and in a little brown Gravy.

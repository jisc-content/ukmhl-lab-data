The Scotch and Staffordshire Coal, which is brought up by the Canals, is inferior both in durability and the heat it gives. Buchanan, in page 82 of his Economy of Fuel, 8vo. 1810, tells us, “ it has been calculated that the Scotch, or Staffordshire Coal, produces only three-fourths of the heat which is given by the Newcastle Coal.” “ Some are of opinion that it requires about double the quantity of Scotch Coal to produce the same heat as that of Newcastle.” P. 252.

252 the housekeeper’s oracle, and Candles should be made in cold weather — and become much Whiter and more dur- able when they have been kept six or nine months, but after twelve months they begin to deteriorate — and if they still burn steady, they burn away very fast. Housekeepers who have a good store-room, are advised to lay in their stock of Candles and Soap about Midsummer — at which time they are generally cheaper than they are later in the year. The price of Candles is in a great measure regulated by the Price of Tallow. The present Ready Money price of the best dipped Candles, is 7s. 6d. per dozen pounds. If six months’ credit are given, 8s. They are made from sixteen to four in the pound. The common sizes for the Kitchen use are Tens and Eights: the latter size give rather most light, but do not burn much longer than the Tens, because the wick is larger in the pro- portion that the Candle is larger; it being the custom to put the same weight of Wick into the same weight of Tallow — and all Candles give Light in proportion that the Wick is large, and burn long in proportion that the Candle is large.

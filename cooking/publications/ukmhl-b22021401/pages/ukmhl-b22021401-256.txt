Let a broad shelf be suspended from the ceiling of the Cellar, for then no mice can get at your Cheese — and on this let it always be kept, and not carried into the Par- lour till the minute it is wanted; and as soon as it is done with, let it be replaced on the shelf in the Cellar. By such attention, Cheese will be long preserved pleasant and fresh — which, by the usual careless way in being left standing about in the Passages and Kitchens, speedily gets dry, and is spoiled. It must be turned, and its Coat well brushed, and rubbed quite dry and clean, once or twice a week.

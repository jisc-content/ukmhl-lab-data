THE HOUSEKEEPER’S ORACLE. 49 Nothing can be more fatal to True Hos- pitality, which, I think, means the frequency with which we give our friends a hearty wel- come, than the multiplicity of Dishes which Luxury has made fashionable at the Tables of the Great, the Wealthy, and the Ostentatious, who are not seldom any thing but great or wealthy. The great evil of the advanced state of society in which we live, is, that moderate enjoyments are too little valued, and things only of the highest relish will please our pam- pered and vitiated appetites. Amusement has changed into dissipation, Convenience into Luxury, Elegance to Splendour; Ideas of opu- lence have passed all bounds of modest compu- tation, and the wealth of a province is scarcely enough for a London Counting-house—• “ Quos non Oriens, non Occidens satiaverit.” Such prodigious preparation, (as Dominie Sampson would say), instead of being a com- pliment to our guests, is really nothing better than a direct offence ; — is it not a tacit insi- nuation that you think it absolutely necessary to bribe the depravity of their palates, when you desire the pleasure of their Company ? n

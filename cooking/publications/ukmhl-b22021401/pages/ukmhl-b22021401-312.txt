Gather about a peck in quantity, and bruise them well in a clean tub ; then take a horse-hair cloth, and press them as much as possible without breaking the seeds. When you have squeezed out all the juice, put to every Gallon three pounds of fine dry powdered Sugar; stir all together till the Sugar is dis- solved, and then put it into a vessel or cask which must be quite filled. If the quantity is ten or twelve Gallons, let it stand a fort- night; but, if it is a twenty Gallon Cask, it must stand three weeks.

If it is a ten Gallon Cask, let it stand three months; if a twenty Gallon Cask, four months; then bottle it off', and it will draw clear and fine.

Those in the parlour should recollect the importance of setting a good example to their friends at the Second Table. If they cut bread, meat, cheese, &c. fairly, it will go twice as far as if hacked and mangled by some sensualists, who appear to have less consideration for their domestics than a good Sportsman for his Dogs.

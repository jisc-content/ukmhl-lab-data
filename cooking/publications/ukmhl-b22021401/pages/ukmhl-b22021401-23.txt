13 THE HOUSEKEEPER’S ORACLE. To make an appearance beyond your Fortune, either in dress, equipage, or entertainment, is a certificate of a much greater weakness in your character than to keep within it. Public Virtue can only be supported by Pri- vate Independence, and private Independence by Economy. Let Prodigals, if they please, report that “ you Have more than you Spend”—Can you think yourself the wiser for pleasing Fools? Such a remark will have a much pleasanter effect upon your credit than if prudent men say that “ you Spend more than you Have.” For the latter, your warmest friends will not be able to furnish an apology; but for the former, every man wdio does not prefer mad- ness to Mirth, will commend and respect you. The Danger of creating Wants. The Maxim that he who has the fewest wants is the richest man, is as true as it is old; most of our wants are of our own creating, and often make us Poor in the midst of Plenty. “ Give no more than nature needs, Man’s Life is cheap as Beast’s.” Shaksfeare. \

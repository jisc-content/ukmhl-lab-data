This done, some small round coals should be put in; and, last of all, a shovel or two of small ones. I say a shovel or two, for if too great a weight of coals is put on at top, when the wood burns freely, and gives way, the small coals, if too heavy, will break down before they are kindled, and put the fire out; but a fire laid as here directed, will burn up freely and well, without the trouble of attending it more than once to see the state of it, and add more Coals, if necessary. Fires so laid are soon lighted. When a Fire is lighted in the common way, if the window is not opened after the Fire is lighted, when you come down you must be content to breathe the Essence of Candle- snuffs, Matches, Brimstone, and a filthy con- gregation of all manner of pestilential vapours. Ten Minutes after you have lighted a fire, look at it to see if it is burning up.

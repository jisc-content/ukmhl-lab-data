24 THE HOUSEKEEPER’S ORACLE. The ’Tis Buts. \ ou ask me the secret by which we contrive, On an income so slender so fairly to thrive ; Why the long and the short of the matter is this, We take things as they come, and thus nought comes amiss: My Sons are no Sluggards, my Daughters no Sluts, And we still keep an eye to the main and 'Tis Buts. 2. Neighbour Squander’s grand treat, 'tis but so much he says. And his Wife’s fine new Gown, 'tis but so much she pays ; 'Tis but so much the Fan, 'tis but so much the Play, His Child’s gewgaws, too, 'tis but that thrown away ; But each ’tis but grows on, till they run on so fast, That he finds ’tis but coming to want at the last. 3. Now something occurs, and he says like a Ninny, I’ll buy it at once, for it is but a Guinea ; And then something else, and he still is more willing, For it is but a Trifle, it is but a Shilling : Then it is but a Penny, it is but a Mite, ’Till the 'Tis Buts at last, sum up ruin outright. 4. But for my part I ever these maxims would take, That a little and little a mickle will make; Take care of the Shillings, those vain wand’ring elves, And the Pounds, my good friend, will take care of themselves ; If you quarter the Road you avoid the great ruts, And you will run on quite smooth if you mind the ’ Tis Buts.

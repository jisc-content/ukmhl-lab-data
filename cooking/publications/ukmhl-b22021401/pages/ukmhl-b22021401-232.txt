222 THE housekeeper’s oracle, and I especially in clamp weather, or they will be in danger of becoming mouldy. One of the surest tokens of a Good House- wife is the state of her Bread Pan. The Whiter bread is, the more it is adulte- rated : the consequence of adulteration is, that bread, which has been called the “ Staff of Life,” becomes “ an arrow in the hand of death.” Constant experience proves that such bread after it is two days old, becomes more dry and husky than good home-made bread is at four or five days old. The difference of consuming New Baker’s bread of the first day, and that which has been baked the day before, is computed to be at least one-fourth more of the New Bread. Persons troubled with Flatulency, Heart- burn, and the various concomitants of Indi- gestion, should never eat nexo Bread — or Pastry. If Bread made in a private family, of the same flour as the Baker uses, is much less white and much more moist, it is a clear proof that the Baker’s bread is whitened, and arti- ficially.

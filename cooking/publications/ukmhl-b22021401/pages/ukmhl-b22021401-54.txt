A prudent Host, who is not in the humour to submit to an attack from “ Staunch Topers,” “ who love to keep it up ” as Eons Vivants, whose favourite song is ever “ Fly not yet,” will engage some sober friends to fight on his side, and at a certain hour to vote for “ no more Wine,” and bravely demand “ Tea/’ and will select his Company with as much care as a Chemist composes a neutral Salt, judiciously providing quite as large a proportion of Alkali (Tea Men) as he has of Acid (Wine Men).

ECONOMIST AND EPICURE’S CALENDAR. 241 There is a great proportion of bad, much good, but very little Excellent Butter, which must be attributed to the immense quantity used — the great distance from which it is often brought — the time it is kept — and the method of manufacturing it. It is also well known that Butter wastes extremely in quan- tity from the various substances on which the Cows feed. Butter is of two kinds. The Fresh and The Salt. The peculiar excellence of each consists in its perfect sweetness and delicate flavour. What is termed the Weekly Dorset is the best Salt Butter. This arrives in Town twice a week. It is generally about 3cl. per pound cheaper than the best Fresh Butter, and will keep good for a fortnight in Summer, and longer in Winter. For Melting, Pastry, and many other purposes, this is quite as proper as Fresh Butter. Fine Carlow Butteri which comes in about Michaelmas, is about 5d. per pound less than Fresh Butter, and will keep good for a couple of months. Salt Butter is sold in Firkins of about 60 pounds weight, and also in what are termed Whole Half Firkins, of about 28 or 30 pounds. M

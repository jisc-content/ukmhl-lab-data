10 THE HOUSEKEEPER’S ORACLE. The price of many Articles is regular and fixed, and by consulting with experienced per- sons, you may easily learn the rate of others — the average consumption of moderate persons in a frugal family, who seldom purchase either Fish or Poultry, is per Mouth per Week of Meat* 6 Pounds weight undressed. Bread 4 Ditto (Quartern Loaf.) Butter 1 Half-pound. Tea 2 Ounces. Sugar 1 Half-pound. Beer (Porter) 1 Pint per day. * Some Housekeepers allow their Cooks a certain Sum instead of the Kitchen Stuff; give those you are obliged to trust every inducement to be' honest, and no temptation to play tricks. A Kitchen-stuff Merchant gave us the following Anecdote of the History of Grease:—“ Do you know that some Cooks will strip your Meat of its Fat—crib your Candles, cabbage your Potatoes, &c. to increase the contents of their Grease Pot—nay, will you believe it? are so naughty as even to cheat me ! Do you know, that after melting 20 pounds of fat, I have found almost half that weight of Potatoes; which, when nicely mashed, and stirred well into the hot Dripping, alas! worse luck, I cannot detect till melted !! !”— Now, I must tell my Reader, in my usual candid manner, that the foregoing observations have not escaped the censure of certain furious Economists, who have exclaimed to the Author “ I would not for the World have your Book read in my Kitchen.”

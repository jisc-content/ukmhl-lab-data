ECONOMIST AND EPICURE’S CALENDAR. 221 Bread is now sold by the Pound:—the Author has had excellent Bread from T. Lis- ter, No. 6, Salcombe Place, York Terrace, Regent’s Park. Fresh-baked Bread is extremely unwhole- some—a Loaf should not be cut till it has been baked at least 24 hours — and should be kept in an Earthen pan with a cover. Cut the Loaf as even as possible; pare off all burned and black parts of the crust, and cut no more Bread at a time than you are pretty sure will be wanted. If any pieces are left, let them be eaten before any more Bread is cut, or at least put them away carefully in the Bread Pan — the Crum will be useful for making Bread Crums for Fried Fish,* &c. (No. 320), the Crust will make a Save-All Pudding. See No. 110 of the Appendix to The Cook’s Oracle. The Pieces should be thus used twice a week, they are now (anno 1740) unanimously agreed, that including Puddings, Pies, and the other Pastry ware, the quantity of Flour consumed in the City and its suburbs amounts to ten ounces per head daily.” — Maitland’s Hist. London, p. 756. * See page 209, Receipt 320, of the Cook’s Oracle, to which book all numbers, as the above, refer.

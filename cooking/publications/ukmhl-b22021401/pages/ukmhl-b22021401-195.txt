picure’s calendar. 185 economist and e Barbel.—This fish spawns at the latter end of April, or in the beginning of May; begins to be in season about a month after, and con- tinues in season till the time of spawning re- turns. It is very bony and coarse, and is not accounted, at any time, the best fish to eat, either for wholesomeness * or taste; but the spawn is of a very poisonous nature. When it is full of spawn, in March and April, it may be easily mistaken for Tench, if the barbs or wattles under the head are carefully cut off; and (if the same art is taken to disguise it) its fine case and handsome shape, during the rest of the year, give it so near a resemblance to Grayling, that it is very common to impose it upon the public for one or the other, as the different seasons give the proper opportunities. * Hawkin3, the Editor of Walton’s Complete Angler, observes, p. 217, — That “ though the spawn of Barbel is known to be of a poisonous nature, yet it is often taken, by country people, medicinally, who find it at once a most pow- erful Emetic and Cathartic. And, notwithstanding what is said of the wholesomeness of the flesh, with some constitutions it produces the same effects as the spawn. About the month of September, in the year 1754, a servant of mine, who had eaten part of a Barbel, though, as I had cautioned him, he abstained from the spawn, was seized with such a violent purging and vomiting as bad like to have cost him his life.”

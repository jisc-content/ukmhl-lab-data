M.P., Eaton Hall, a cucumber of the snake species, which now measures six feet, and is still in a growing state. It is worthy of remark, that in the short period of forty-eight hours, the cucumber grew to the wonderful extent of fourteen inches. The Macclesfield Courier adds, that the growth of the vege- table appears to be nearly complete, as its increase daily becomes less and less!! ! t One is almost induced to imagine that the lower orders of London conceive that “ Tatars," as they commonly call them in their uncooked state, is a gene- rical term; and that they only become entitled to the prefix of “pot," after they have been boiled.

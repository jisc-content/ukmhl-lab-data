Hail- water being produced in the higher regions of the atmosphere, is still purer, from its congelations. Lastly, dew, as it arises from the evaporation of various bodies of the vegetable and animal kingdoms, is more or less impure according to the different regions and seasons.‚Äù On the different kinds and qualities of fermented and spi- rituous liquors, it does not fall within the compass of the present article to treat. They all consist of water as their basis or vehicle, of more or less alcohol or ardent spirit, according to their different degrees of strength, of sugar, and of the particular ingredient by which their nature is deter- mined; such as the grape in wine, the apple and pear in cider and perry, the malt and hop in beer, &c. It is only necessary here to observe, that, with few exceptions, fermented liquors, when immoderately taken, are more detrimental than elementary fluids, in proportion to the quantity that they contain of alcohol, or ardent spirit. With respect to the China tea and the coffee-berry, we believe them to be much less injurious to the animal economy than some theorists have been disposed to conjecture. In excess, however, and when indulged in as substitutes for, and, as is some times the case, almost to the exclusion of, nourish- ing diet, they are highly deleterious, as they tend to the in- duction of a morbidly irritable condition of the nervous system. It deserves to be remarked, that these stimuli do not, like alcohol, produce those formidable and often irremediable dis- orders, affections of the liver, dropsy, and apoplexy.

53 THE HOUSEKEEPER’S ORACLE. But surely, greater than them all, Is he who never dines* at all.” Some foolish Children of the largest growth, who give dinners at seven or eight o’clock, affect to wonder that those who keep rational hours, and “ live a little like other people,” object to their ridiculous hours : — but which is most unreasonable, for you to require * A Wag, on being told it was the Fashion to dine later and later every day, said, “ he supposed it would end at last in not dining till to-morrow !” The folly of Procrastination has even altered the time of Divine Worship, and the ancient hour of humbling ourselves before our God, is made subservient to the caprices of Fashion. We strain at a Gnat and swallow a Camel; and in this in- stance the Publican’s Houses are kept open, while we deny ourselves other necessaries of Life out of a scruple of Con- science. For example: in extreme hot weather, when Meat will not keep from Saturday to Monday, we throw, or cause to be thrown away, vast quantities of tainted Meat, and have generally stinking Dinners, because the Butchers dare not sell a joint of Meat on a Sunday Morning. ' Now, though I would not have the Sabbath so far violated as to have it made a Market-day, yet rather than abuse God’s mercies by throwing away Creatures given for our use, nay, for our health and cleanliness’ sake, I would have the same Indulgence in extreme Hot Weather, as there is for Milk and Mackerel, that is to say, that Meat might be killed in the cool of the Morning, at one or two o’clock, and sold till ten, and no longer.

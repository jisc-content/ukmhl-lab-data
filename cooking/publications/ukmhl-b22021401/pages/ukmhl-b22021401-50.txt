40 THE HOUSEKEEPER’S ORACLE. the System, without which you feel uncom- fortable, then stop.”—See The Art of Invi- gorating Life, 12mo. p. 176, where the Reader will find some wholesome Truths on the subject of Wine ; and see Chapter on Wine. Translation of a Fragment from the Greek of Eubulus: — “ Those friends who to listen to prudence incline, I’d only indulge in three bumpers of Wine ; The first, in due order, our health to improve ; The second be sacred to pleasure and love ; The third having settled our slumbers aright, The Guests truly sober will wish me good night. Far far be the fourth from our peaceable joys, It leads but to insult, the fifth but to noise ; And madness and broils from the sixth will arise. Though small he the Bumper, if often repeated, The stoutest is quickly by Bacchus defeated.”* C. T. S. No healthy Man need habitually take Wine as Food till he is past thirty years of age. Animal food affords the most permanent nourishment; or, as the saying is, “ sticks to your Ribs.” much greater a number would they amount to, if they were reckoned, as they ought tp be, who died of such diseases as Grief brought upon them ? * Let no Man leave your House in a state of Intoxication without some one attending him in a Coach.

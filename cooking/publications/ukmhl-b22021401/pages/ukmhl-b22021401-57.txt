47 THE HOUSEKEEPER’S ORACLE. That maxim of a profligate Poet has piloted thousands to poverty— “ Keep up appearances : there lies the test, The world will give you credit for the rest.” “ To me for ever be that Guest unknown, Who, measuring my Expenses by his own, Remarks the difference with a scornful leer, And slights my humble house and homely cheer.” Gifford’s Translation of the 11 th Satire of Juvenal.

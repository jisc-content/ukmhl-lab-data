300 the housekeeperâ€™s oracle. I omitted the Balm and Isinglass, and put two oz. of Ginger to each Gallon of water. To make Nine Gallons of Orange Wine. First pare fifty-four Seville Oranges very thin, and put the rinds into hot water for a few hours, then throw the water away and put a similar quantity, say enough to cover them ; it being considered that the first water is apt to be too bitter. Let them stand two or three days, then strain it off, and reserve your Liquor to flavour the wine when in the Cask. Squeeze the fifty-four Seville Oranges, with fifty-four China Oranges, into a Receiver of any kind. Then cover the Pulp with two or three gal- lons of hot water for twenty-four hours, and strain the whole through a thick cloth. Put twenty-seven pounds of Lump Sugar into a Tub, and dissolve it with three or four Gallons of hot water, taking care that the juice and water before mentioned shall not exceed nine Gallons. Put the whole into a Cask, the Juice first, stirring it up well, and after it has done work- ing, add one pint of Brandy: it will be fit to bottle in nine months; but if kept longer it is supposed to improve.

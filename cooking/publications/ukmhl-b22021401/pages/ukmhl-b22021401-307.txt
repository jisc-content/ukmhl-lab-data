This fluid, however, is seldom or never taken in a state of entire purity. Even in nature’s laboratory it is invariably im- pregnated with foreign substances ; and it is this admixture of extraneous matter which constitutes its varieties. Thus we have snow-water, rain-water, spring-water, river-water, and water from lakes, wells, and swamps, each possessing their individual characteristics. Spring-water is in general most free from impurities ; it is, however, less suited for drink than the water of rivers, as it almost constantly contains calcareous or saline ingredients. The calcareous earth dissolved in the water of many springs, has been supposed, indeed, by Dr. Darwin, to contribute to our nourishment in the manner that lime proves useful in agriculture. This principle, however, is not perhaps fully established; and we believe that too much stress has, by theorists in general, been laid on the specific qualities of water, as modifying both the bodily and intellectual character of in- dividuals and nations. The cretinism and fatuity of the Alpine valleys were formerly attributed to the waters of these countries, but are now more commonly, and we believe more justly, referred to constitutional propensity, innutritious food, and a humid, unhealthy atmosphere. That water, however, possesses great varieties, according to the nature of the soil and situation of the place in which it is produced or contained, is undeniable ; and we shall here extract part of what is observed on these varieties by an attentive and judicious observer. “ Spring-water’' says Dr. Willich, “ originates partly from o 2

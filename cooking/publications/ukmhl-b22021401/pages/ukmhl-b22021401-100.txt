90 the housekeeper's oracle. son-eaters are, the best-flavoured and fattest slices will be found on the right of the line 3, 4, supposing the end 1, turned towards you. Slices of Venison should not be cut thick, nor too thin, and plenty of gravy should be given with them; but as there is a particular sauce made for this meat, with red wine and currant jelly, your guest should be asked if he pleases to have any. The fat is very apt to get cool soon, and become hard and disagreeable to the palate; it should, therefore, always be served up on a water-dish; and if your company is large, and the joint is a long time on the table, a lamp should be sent for, and a few slices of fat and lean, with some of the gravy, are presently heated over it, either in a silver or pewter plate. This is always done at table, and the sight of the lamp never fails to give pleasure to your company.

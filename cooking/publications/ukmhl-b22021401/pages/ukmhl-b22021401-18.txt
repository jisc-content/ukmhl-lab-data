8 THE HOUSEKEEPER’S ORACLE. Make an exact estimate of your Net Income, after subtracting all the charges thereon, and all the deductions therefrom for repairs, col- lecting, &c. Be assured, that so great is the mutability of Fortune, and so great is the uncertainty of Income, from whatever source it is derived, that if you hope to enjoy tranquillity of Mind, and to be Independent and Respectable — you MUST RESERVE AT LEAST TWO-FIFTHS OF WHAT APPEARS YOUR NET INCOME, One fifth for your family, and the other as a reserve against those casual deficiencies and unforeseen expenses which happen in every station of Society; therefore “ In fair weather, prepare for foul.” “ Experience has proved that charges of all kinds seldom fail to exceed the original com- putation ; and that new demands, not foreseen at first, continually occur. Hence it is the part of prudence in every Master of a family rigidly to adjust his expenditure to such a standard as may not only provide for defici- encies in his Estimate, but also an annual fund for his family, and an annual surplus for unexpected contingencies, heavy losses, bur- thensome repairs, distressed relations. ’—Gis- borne’s Enquiry, vol. ii. p.478.

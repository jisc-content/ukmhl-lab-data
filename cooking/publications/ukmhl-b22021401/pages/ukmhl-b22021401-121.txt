Ill THE HOUSEKEEPER’S ORACLE. the wing, by cutting off a portion of the white fleshy part from the pinion. PARTRIDGE. It is here trussed for the spit, the skewers being withdrawn previous to its being brought to table. It is carved similarly to a Fowl (see next page); the wings taken off in the lines 1, 2, and the merry-thought in the line 3, 4. The prime parts of this bird are the wings, breast, and merry-thought—the wing is thought the best. If a brace of birds only is to be divided amongst many, cut them up and send a servant with them round the table. In this case, he that is last served may obtain the most delicate part; for a guest will take that himself, which if you were to send him, would create offence.

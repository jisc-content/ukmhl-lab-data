THE HOUSEKEEPER’S ORACLE. 119 Green-Grocer —Milkman, &c. with whom you deal—by looking in the daily papers you will find plenty who are in want of Places. “ There are seldom less than Ten Thousand Servants of both sexes, at all times, out of place in the Me- tropolis.”— Colquhoun on Po/zce, 8vo. 1796. The shortest way is to advertise* yourself, describing what sort of Servant you wish for: this will bring you plenty of applications pre- sently ; and it will save you some trouble to direct them to call on one of the above Trades- men, and let him select and send to you only such as he deems most likely to suit you. * The following we took from “ The Mohning Post,” for October 1819. “ Wanted immediately, a SERVANT of ALL-WORK: — so uniting COOK and HOUSEMAID, that the utmost ex- cellence in either capacity would not answer, without corre. sponding perfectionin both; accompanied by absolute sobriety and universal honesty. Her age must be from twenty-five to forty. In regard to character, that of her last service, unless it has been a long one, will not be sufficient. The Advertiser, being of opinion that all the malefactions of mankind originate in practical falsehood, gives warning, that the first lie shall be the last. There is no possibility of any perquisite, nor im- punity for the slightest fraud or waste; but liberal wages and the kindest treatment may be confidently counted on by a really deserving woman.”

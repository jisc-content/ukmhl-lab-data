THE HOUSEKEEPER’S ORACLE. 29 trapped to buy some unchcwable old Poultry— tough Tup-Mutton — stringy Cow-Beef— or stale Fish — at very little less than the price of prime good food : or French Cambric manu- factured at Manchester— Russia Duck from Aberdeen — and Brussels Lace from Not- tingham. However, those desperate Economists, Messrs. Pennywise — Justenough — Makeitdo— Spare- salt—Skinflint, and Saveall, &c. 8tc., may thank us for the following extract: “ Early in the Morning is the best time to have a choice of Meat at Market — but under certain circumstances the Economist will pre- fer the Evening; wholesale and large Butchers having a large stock of Veal or Lamb on their hands, on a Saturday night in Summer, will sell upon almost any terms; as the meat, al- though then perfectly good, and fit for eating on Sunday, would not resist the assaults of Captain Green* until Monday: upon these occasions, a fine joint of Veal or Lamb may often be purchased for 3d. or Ad. per pound, * “A quaint saying among the Butchers, alluding to the discoloration in Veal when kept too long." From the Economist.

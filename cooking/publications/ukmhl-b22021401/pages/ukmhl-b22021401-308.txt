As it is dissolved and purified in a variety of ways before it becomes visible to us, it is lighter and purer than other waters. “ Well-water.—Wells opened in a sandy soil are the purest. The more frequently a well is used the better ; for the longer water stands unmoved the sooner it turns putrid. “ River-water is more pure and wholesome if it flows over a sandy and stony soil, than if it passes over muddy beds, or through towns, villages, and forests : water is rendered foul by fish, amphibious animals, and plants. “ Lake-ivater much resembles river-water, but being less agitated it is more impure. The water which, in cases of necessity, is obtained from swamps and ditches, is the worst of all; because a great variety of impurities are there collected, which, in a stagnated and soft soil, readily putrefy. “ Rain-water is also impure, as it contains many saline and oily particles, soon putrefies, and principally consists of the joint exhalations of animals, vegetables, and minerals, of an immense number and variety of small insects and their eggs, seeds of plants, and the like. Rain-water is particularly im- pure in places filled with many noxious vapours ; such as marshy countries, and large manufacturing towns, where the fumes of metallic and other substances are mixed with rain. In high and elevated situations, at a distance from impure exhalations, if no strong winds blow, and after a gentle shower, rain-water is then purest. In summer, however, on account of the copious exhalations, rain-water is most ob- jectionable. “ Snow-water possesses the same properties as rain-water,

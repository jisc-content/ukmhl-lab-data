331 APPENDIX. celebrated Cosmetics consist of preparations of Lead, Mercury, or Bismuth. Carmine, or harmless rouge, (as the Ladies are pleased to term it,) is a preparation of Cochineal in nitrous acid, with some other ingredient which is kept a profound secret. This favourite composition, which gives the roseate bloom to the countenance, being pre- pared with a strong mineral acid, is, perhaps, not altogether so very innocent as they ima- gine : besides, its excessive dearness renders it an object for adulteration; and Vermilion, (a preparation of Mercury,) though a humble imitation, affords a cheap and inviting ingre- dient to mix with it. To this, in its simple or combined state, they are generally beholden for their Roses; while a calx of Lead, or what is equally per- nicious, the magic power of Bismuth, gives the last polish to the lily whiteness which so dazzles our eyes. This poisonous composition is generally dig- nified by the pompous title of Pearl-Powder> and sold as perfectly innocent : it has, how- ever, proved fatal to some, and ruined the health of many others, without being even suspected.

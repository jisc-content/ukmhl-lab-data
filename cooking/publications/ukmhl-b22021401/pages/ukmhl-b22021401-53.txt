THE HOUSEKEEPER’S ORACLE. 43 of people destroying their own health by drink- ing that of others, has happily declined, and its declension affords one of the few examples in which Fashion is the friend of Virtue. It is easier to induce people to follow than to set an Example—however good it may be both for themselves and others, most men have a silly squeamishness about proposing an ad- journment from the Dinner Table. The Host, fearing that his Guest may take it for a token that he loves his Wine better than his friends, is obliged to feign an unwillingness to leave the Bottle, and, as Sponge says—“ In good truth, ’tis impossible, nay, I say it is impudent, to contradict any Gentleman at his own Table; the President is always the wisest man in the party.” “ Be of your Patron’s mind, whate’er lie says ; Sleep very much, think little, and talk less ; Mind neither good nor bad, nor right nor wrong, But eat your Pudding, Fool, and hold your tongue.” Mat.

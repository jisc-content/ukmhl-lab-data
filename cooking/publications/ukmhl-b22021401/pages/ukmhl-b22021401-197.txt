ECONOMIST AND EPICURE’S CALENDAR. 187 place as Turbots, and are mostly of the same quality as the Turbot, from the different parts. Some Brills are very good, but not equal to Turbot. Carp*—This fish is said to breed twice or thrice in a year, but the chief time of * In the pond at Charlottenburg, a palace belonging to the King of Prussia, I saw more than two or three hundred Carp, between two and three feet long; and I was told by the keeper they were between 50 and 60 years standing. They were tame, and came to the shore in order to be fed; they swallowed with ease a piece of white bread, of the size of half a halfpenny roll. We shall only add the author’s testimony, concerning the possibility of the Carp not only living for a considerable time out of water, but of its growing fat in its new element. The author has seen the experiment successfully tried, and attended to the whole process, in a nobleman’s house where he then resided, in the principality of Anhalt-Dessau. The fish being taken out of the water, is wrapt up in a large quantity of wet moss, spread on a piece of net, which is then gathered into a purse ; in such a manner, however, as to allow him room to breathe. The net is then plunged into water, and hung up to the ceiling of a cellar. At first the dipping must be repeated every three or four hours ; but afterwards, the Carp need only be plunged into the water once in about six or seven hours. Bread soaked in milk is first given him, in small quantities. In a short time the fish will bear more, and grow fat under this seemingly unnatural treatment Forster, on the Management of Carp, in the Phil. Trans. for 1771 ; and Albin on Fish, 4lo. 1794, p. 10.

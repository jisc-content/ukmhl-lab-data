THE HOUSEKEEPER’S ORACLE. 31 “ Sugar is sometimes sold at an under-rate to O get customers for Tea, which article is again sold far more than proportionally too dear ; great bargains are allowed in Ribands and Gauzes, with a view to allure purchasers for Silks and Laces at an exorbitant price. In such cases it is often contrived, that the cheap article shall be one of trifling worth, and one the value of which is well known; while the dear article is of an opposite description. When the bait has taken, the price of the cheaper commodity is commonly raised, or one of in- ferior worth is substituted in its place. Shops of this sort are commonly called Cheap half-crown ? The devil burn myself and the blanket to boot, if I give up my bargain ! A little scuffling followed; but John found Pat rather a rough customer, and therefore called in the aid of a Constable. All would not do; the blanket he would have, and, to put an end to the dispute, all parties adjourned to Bow Street, when, after a patient and pleasant examination before the worthy magistrate—Pat wa3 permitted to retain his purchase, and the blanket-seller warned never more to mark up half-price. This case must be in the recollection of many of our readers ; and we think, that where articles appear marked in windows for less than their value, people would do well to follow Pat’s example. They should ask first to look at the article, and if they think it is worth the price marked, put down the money, and walk away with their purchase.

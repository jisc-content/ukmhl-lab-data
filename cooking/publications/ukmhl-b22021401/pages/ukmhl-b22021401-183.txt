Same as the preceding month. (The March flight of Wild Fowl is generally known). Turkey desiring the servant to boil it longer than the usual time. At the same time, however, that the Court thus gave judg- ment against the defendant, they could not avoid censuring, to a certain extent, the plaintiff, and all those who encouraged persons of the defendant’s description, by dealing with them. Little doubt could exist in the mind of any one, that most of the fowls thus hawked about the streets were stolen, at least by those who sold them to the hawkers ; and whilst the thieves could find so ready a market for their plunder, there was but little chance that the robbing of farm-houses would he put an end to.

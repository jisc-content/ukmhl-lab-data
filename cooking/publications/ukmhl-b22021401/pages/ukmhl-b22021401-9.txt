PREFACE. The Housekeeper’s Oracle was intended by the late Dr. Kitchiner to have been a Companion to the Cook’s Oracle, and to supply that information to young persons of all classes, which the nature of the latter work necessarily precluded. I trust his endeavour has been successful. The object was to guard young housewives against the impositions — of dishonest servants, or the extortions of—extravagant tradespeople; and it is hoped such knowledge will not be too dearly- bought by the purchase of this little Volume. W. B. Kitchiner. Albany, 1829.

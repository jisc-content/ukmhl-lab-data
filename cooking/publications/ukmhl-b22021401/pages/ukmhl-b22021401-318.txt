308 the housekeeper’s oracle. cream of tartar, tamarinds, and various other prepared vegetable acids, as well as that par- ticularly denominated Citric Acid, are occa- sionally employed ; but perhaps, after all, the juices of Limes, Lemons, and Seville oranges,' expressed from the fresh fruits, when attain- able, make the sort of Sherbet which seems most congenial with the nature of good British Punch. Procure a couple of ripe, sound, and fresh Lemons or Limes, and a Seville Orange ; rub oft’ the yellow rind of one of the Lemons with lumps of fine Loaf Sugar, putting each lump into the bowl, as soon as it is saturated or clogged with the Essence or grated rind ; then thinly pare the other Lemon and Seville orange, and put those rinds also into the bowl, to which add plenty of sugar; pour a very small quan- tity of boiling water,* and immediately squeeze the juice of the fruit, followed by a little more hot water. Incorporate the whole well together with a punch ladle ; and, putting a little of the sherbet thus composed, try its richness and flavour by the palate. * The late Count Rumford recommended a table-spoonful of Rice to be boiled in each quart of water; it imparts a soft- ness almost equal to Jelly.

50 the housekeeper’s oracle. that you think so lightly of them, as to sup- pose that the savoury Sauces on your Table, are a more inviting attraction than sensible Society around it! and that an honest man is to be caught by a slice of Mutton, as easily as a hungry Mouse is with a bit of Cheese ? When twice as much cooking is undertaken as there are Servants, or conveniences in the Kitchen to prepare it properly — Dishes must be dressed long before the Dinner hour, and stand by spoiling; your Cook must compro- mise her credit, and your Guests get indi- gestion ! Now is this not the silliest thing imaginable, that awhole family should, for a foolish Fashion, submit to suffer fatigue for several days before, and famine for several days after a Dinner Party, for the strange fancy of contriving a parcel of cloying combustibles which they know will most likely make their Company sick ! for, as Addison says, “ when I behold a Fashionable Table set out in all its magnifi- cence, I fancy that I see Gouts and Dropsies, Fevers and Lethargies, with innumerable other distempers, lying in ambuscade among the Dishes.”—Spectator, No. 195.

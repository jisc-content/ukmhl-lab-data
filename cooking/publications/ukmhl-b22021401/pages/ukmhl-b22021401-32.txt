22 THE HOUSEKEEPER’S ORACLE. penses to exceed three-fifths of your Income, you enter the path of Danger. “ Certainly if a Man would not run out, his ordinary expenses ought not to exceed the half of his Receipts ; and if he thinks to increase his Estate, not the third part of them.”—Lord Bacon’s Essay on Expense. To keep a scrupulously Exact Account of Payments and of Receipts, can alone enable you so to regulate your plan of expen- diture, that it will admit of occasional indul- gence without imprudent extravagance. v Set down the smallest sum—“ Take care of the Pence—the Pounds will take care of them- selves”—“ A Penny a Day, is Half-a-Crown a Month, and thirty shillings a year.” “ Who spends more than he should, Shall not have to spend when he ivould.” Not only limit your expenses to Pounds and Shillings—but ever bear in mind the old favourite and fortune-saving maxim of frugal Housewives— “ One penny saved is two-pesce clear, A Pin a day’s a Groat a year.”

244 the housekeeper’s oracle, and I have no reason for not doing so — for you have a Palate, and would choose the best Cheese if I did not tell you : but, my dear Sir, I should not like to be often asked such a question. People in general have so little taste, that if they choose for themselves, it is an even chance that they choose the worst, and you know that is the best they can choose for me.” ■ 1. A Cheshire man sail’d into Spain, To trade for Merchandise : When he arrived from the Main, A Spaniard he espies — Who said, ‘ You English Rogue, look here, What Fruits and Spices fine Our Land produces twice a year; Thou hast not such in thine.’ 2. The Cheshire man ran to his hold, And fetched a Cheshire Cheese ; And said, ‘ Look here, you dog, behold We have such Fruits as these. Your Fruits are ripe but twice a year, As you yourself do say, But such as I present you here, Our Land brings twice a day.’ The above celebrated Song of The Cheshire Cheese is from Jones’s Popular Cheshire Me- lodies.

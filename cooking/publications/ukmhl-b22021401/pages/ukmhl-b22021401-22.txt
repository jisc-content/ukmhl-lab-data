12 THE HOUSEKEEPER’S ORACLE. 3. Perhaps society cannot shew a more piti- able figure than either a very old man or woman, who, having spent their substance in the flattering gaieties of youth, are reduced, in the most helpless situation, to live upon acci- dental strokes of generosity, and to be at once ridiculed and relieved. 4. If an old person expects to receive the least degree of attention from the world in general, or even from his relations in particular, it must be by the force of happy circumstances in his favour; such, for instance, as arise out of a fortune accumulated by the industry or ingenuity of youth. This will render the veteran respectable among- his domestics, and make even his utmost infirmities supportable. Whereas if an old man has no testimonials of his eco- nomy to produce, he will crawl contemptibly about the world, be upbraided for his former prodigality, even by his own children, who, having no hopes, will consider him as an en- cumbrance; and, wanting the various atten- tions which are necessary to the accommodation of the last scene, his continuance in the family will be irksome, his life must be supported by the contributions of the charitable, and he must die unmourned.—Keep, therefore, the staff in thine own hand.

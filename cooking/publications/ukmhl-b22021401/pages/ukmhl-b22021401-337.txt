327 APPENDIX. Beds shut up in small closets, and Press Bedsteads, are extremely injurious, especially to young people and Invalids. When persons are from necessity obliged to sleep in them, it will be advisable every morning, immediately after rising, to displace all the Bed-clothes, nor should soiled linen be suffered to remain in an apartment where the purity of the air is of the first importance. If the sky be serene, open the door and windows, and let the room be thoroughly ven- tilated. It is a dangerous practice to sleep with open windows, either during the night or the day; nor should the Bedstead be placed near a wall, but stand free on all its sides, and, if possible, in the middle of the chamber, which is of consequence to those who tremble during the prevalence of a tempest or thunder-storm. We know from experience, that a flash of lightning, should it unfortunately strike a building, or enter through any of the windows, uniformly takes its direction along the walls, without injuring the Furniture in the centre of a room. Let the aspect of your Bed-room be towards the East, that it may receive the enlivening rays of the morning Sun.

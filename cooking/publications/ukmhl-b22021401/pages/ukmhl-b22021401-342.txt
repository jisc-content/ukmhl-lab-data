332 the housekeeperâ€™s oracle. I am credibly informed, that those Ladies who are in the habit of enamelling their faces, necks, and bosoms, with this White Paint, generally fall victims to their own indiscretion. It is thus our modern Hebes attempt to preserve a perpetual bloom, and to set Wrinkles and old age at defiance. But, alas! alas ! these pernicious ingredients, although only used externally, are liable to be imbibed at every pore, and thence convey a slow poison into the system, highly injurious to the health, and certainly destructive to Beauty. For, dis- mal to relate, the Cold-Cream, the Pommade- Divine, or whatever specious titles such com- positions may assume, at last betray their trust, and, instead of Beauty, produce real Deformity. The artificial roses soon fade, the angelic whiteness contracts a dingy brown, when the mask falls off, and the Spectre stands confessed. Strange, that British Ladies, to whom Nature has been so bountiful, should distrust their native charms, and have recourse to such wretched substitutes of art! Is it not truly mortifying, that they should thus stoop to adorn, or rather disguise their persons, at the expense of their Health !

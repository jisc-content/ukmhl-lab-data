48 THE HOUSEKEEPER’S ORACLE. MADE DISHES. Excepting those substantial and interesting preparations which are set down in the “ Cook’s Oracle,” and which are intended for an Invi- gorating Meal,— Made Dishes are a useless expense and trouble, for they are not even tasted one time in ten, if your plain Cookery is received with applause. However, I must tell my young Housekeepers that those Dishes are not quite such formidable performances as people in general imagine. One of the- first questions commonly put to a Cook who comes after a place is, “ Do you understand how to make Made Dishes?” Now, a person who can Roast, Fry, and Boil well, cannot fail in making what are called Made Dishes. For what are they ; but Roasts, Fries, and Boils, with sauce poured over them? Nothing is more ridiculous — nothing can be more ruinous to real Comforts, than the vulgar custom of setting out a Table with a parade of profusion, unsuited not only to the circum- stances of the Host, but to the number of the Guests.

154 the housekeeper’s oracle, and OF ANIMAL FOOD. Calculation of London Consumption Numerous Calculations have been made of the annual consumption of food in the Metropolis ; but this is not easily obtained, as, although we may know the number of cattle and sheep, yet we have no means of learning the weight. Of the quantity of cattle sold in Smithfield market, we have the most accurate returns, and find, that in the year 1822 the numbers were, 149,885 beasts; 24,609 calves; 1,507,098 sheep; 20,020 pigs.

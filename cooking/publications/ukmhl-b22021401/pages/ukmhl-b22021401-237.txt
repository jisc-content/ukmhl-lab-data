Some flour was now lightly sprinkled over the top, when it was covered up with two or three sacks to keep in the heat. This operation is called setting quarter sponge. slices, put it into a saucepan-ful of water, set it in a sand bath, or other very warm place, without shaking for twenty- four hours ; the bread will, in this time, soften in all its parts, and the ingredients will separate from it. If any jalap has been used, it will swim on the top in a coarse film ; if any chalk or whiting, it will sink to the bottom; and when the water is poured away, the addition of a little vinegar will occasion a fermentation, like the working of yeast. The water that is poured off is to be filtered, and afterwards evaporated to the consistence of honey ; and. when put by in a cool place, the alum will crystallise, and by weighing it you may deter- mine the exact quantity that a loaf contains. Dr. Darwin thinks, that when much alum is mixed with bread, it may be distinguished by the eye in the place where two loaves have been together in the oven ; they break from each other with a much smoother surface than those loaves which do not contain alum.

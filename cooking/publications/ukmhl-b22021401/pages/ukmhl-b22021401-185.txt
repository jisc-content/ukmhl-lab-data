ECONOMIST AND EPICURE’S CALENDAR. 175 the largest Turkeys and Capons, and almost all other kinds of Poultry, to be had in perfection this month. Fowls and Chickens to be had every day in the year. Cocks’ Combs, Fat Livers, Eggs, &c. are dearest in April and May, cheapest in August. Fowls’ Heads may be bad for tliree a penny,— a dozen will make a very good Pie, or Soup. Turkey Heads, about a penny each. Duck Giblets, about three-halfpence a set; four sets will make a Tureen of pood Soup —for Sixpence. Obs Poultby is in greatest perfection when in greatest plenty. The price of it varies as much as the size and quality of it, the supply at market, and the demand. It is generally dearest from March to July, when the town is fullest, and cheapest about September, when the Game Season commences, and the weather being colder, allows of its being brought from more distant parts, and the town becoming thin, there is less demand for it. The above information will, we trust, be very acceptable to Economical Families, who, from hearing the very high price Poultry sometimes costs, are deterred from ever inquiring about it; in the cheap seasons we have noted, it is sometimes as cheap as Butcher’s Meat.

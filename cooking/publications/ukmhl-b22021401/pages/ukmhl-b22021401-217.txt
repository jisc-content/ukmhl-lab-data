ECONOMIST AND EPICURE’S CALENDAR. 207 FRUITS. The Advice we have given, of letting your Fishmonger choose your Fish for you, applies also with equal propriety to your Fruiterer. The price of Fruit is governed by the supply at Mar- ket; and the quality of Fruit is so likewise — which varies more, and more unexpectedly, than an inexperienced person can imagine, even in the course of two or three days, when the heat is extreme, or rain falls in heavy showers. Strawberries will vary as under : at first, in Thumb-pottles, or by the ounce, 2s. 6cl., pro- gressively declining to 9d. and 6d. previous to commencing regular Pottles ; the very best, of superior quality, seldom sell at less than 10s. per Pottle when first brought to Market; 3s. or 2s. 6d. per Pottle at the cheapest time, when they are gathered in the morning and brought quickly to market on the head. Peaches at first 42s. per dozen, lowering pro- gressively to Is. 6d. and sometimes as low as Is. A Dessert requires even more care in the providing than a Dinner. The latter, Appetite pleads for, the Dessert pleads to Appetite.

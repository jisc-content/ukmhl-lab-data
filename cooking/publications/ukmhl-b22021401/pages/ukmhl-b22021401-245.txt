ECONOMIST AND EPICURE’S CALENDAR. 235 THE PRESENT WAY OF MAKING BREAD, AS PRACTISED BY THE BAKERS. Take six pounds of fruit (Potatoes) well boiled; mash them well in a pail, put a good bowl of cold water to them — more if required, and keeping them as hot as you can, rub them through the Colander: take care to keep room for your yeast, as you can increase the quantity after. It should be a good-sized pailful. After you have got your yeast in, and to a proper heat, which will be regulated by the weather and your own judgment, put in a pound and a half of sifted flour, well stirred together for several minutes; in a short time you will per- ceive it begin to work ; it will require plenty of room, as it must be well down before you take it the second time. This is what we call put- ting in the ferment: when it has been in about two hours, take the same quantity of water and put into your ferment, with a good handful of salt well stirred about. This quantity will require to be kept warm in the sponge; put your strainer over your toes — saw the machinery used for preparing them, and the men kneading the DOUGH WITH THEIR FEET.

Take half a peck of fresh Sprats, do not wash them, only draw them at the gills, and put them into stone Jars, with the following mixture : — Two pounds of common salt, a pound of saltpetre, two ounces of white pepper, and the same quantity of lump Sugar, pound these all well together; put a layer of this at the bottom of the Jar, then a layer of Sprats, and so alter- nately till the Jar is full; tie them down close with a bladder, and keep them in a cold, dry place : they will be ready for use in six months.

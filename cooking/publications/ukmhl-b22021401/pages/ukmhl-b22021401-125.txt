THE HOUSEKEEPER’S ORACLE* 115 white ones—the breast, wings, and neck-bones. It has no merry-thought — the neck must be taken away, and the hollow part under the breast stuffed with forced meat, which is to be cut in thin slices, in the direction from the rump to the neck, and a slice given with each piece of turkey. The breast is the only part usually cut up; if more is wanted, take off one or both wings, a leg, &c. The Gizzard and Rump are favourites with some Epicures. It is called a Devil, when well peppered, salted, and broiled — many people score it with a knife before it is peppered and salted: — when brought up fresh from the Grid- iron, it is divided into parts, and handed round to the Company as a Bonne Bouche, “ just to set You a going, and season your Wine.” these keep it firm on the spit, and prevent the great weight of the stuffing, &c. from making it turn irregular while at the fire. One skewer should be passed through the legs—one in the middle, which confines the wings— and the other under the wings, near the end of the merry-thought.

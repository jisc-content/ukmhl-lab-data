Two men now began- to mould* up the loaves, while a third took his station at the mouth of the oven, who marked each loaf with a large roman W. as it was removed to him, and then placed it on the quartern-peel, and carried it to the upper end of the oven, where it was left, and the peel withdrawn ; the next loaf was placed by the side of the first, and they went on, moulding and delivering, till the whole was set in. The door was now stopped up close till seven o’clock, when it was unclosed, and the drawing- peel being carried under, a part of the batch was obliquely elevated, which separated three or four loaves from their adhesion to the others, when they.were withdrawn, having been in the oven about three hours. The remainder were separated and removed in the same man- ner, and then turned with their bottoms up- wards to prevent them from splitting. * The operation of moulding is peculiar, and can only be learnt by practice: it consists in cutting the mass of dough destined for a loaf into two equal portions; they, are then kneaded either round or long, and one placed in a hollow made in the other, and the union is completed by a turn of the knuckles on the centre of the upper pieje.

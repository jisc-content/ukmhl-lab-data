283 APPENDIX. Soar Crout.* Take a dozen hard white Cabbages, trim, and divide them into quarters, take out all the stalks from the heart of the cabbage, cut it transversely with a knife or chaff-cutter into very small slips. Mix six pounds of salt with four ounces of juniper-berries, and an ounce of caraway seed; put the cabbage into a cask, first strewing the bottom with some of the mixture, then a layer of cabbage; take care that the head of the cask slips down within the staves, and fits closely to the sides; press the cover down, and lay a large stone on it. Set the cask in a shed or out-house for three months, it will then be coming ready for use. When you use it take care of the stone and cover, scrape aside some of the top, take out what you want, and replace what you scraped off the top, and cover down your cask as closely as before. Put the Crout into a stew-pan with a little cold water, simmer it for half an hour, drain in a colander; when done, put the meat you * Appears on the table in Germany as commonly as pota- toes in England, and takes its name from soeur, salt, and kraut, cabbage, which has been corrupted into sour crout.

the housekeeperâ€™s oracle. 87 The shank bone should be wound round with writing paper, as pointed out in the Leg, that the Carver may turn it according to his wish. The hollow part is attacked first, in the direction 1, 2, and the knife should be passed deep to the bone. The Gravy then runs fast into the dish, and the part cut, opens wide enough to take many slices from it readily. The fat which is full of kernels and best flavoured, lies on the outer edge, and is to be cut out in thin slices in the direction 5, 6. If many are at table, and the hollow part, cut in the direction 1, 2, is eaten, some delicate slices may be cut out on each side the ridge of the Blade-bone, in the direction 3, 4. The line between these two dotted lines, is the direction in which the Blade-bone lies.

There are two modes of breaking the curd ; and there will be a difference in the taste of the cheese, according as either is ob->erved ; one is, to gather it witli the hands verj gently towards the side of the tub, letting the whey pass through the lingers till it is cleared, and lading it off as it collects. The other is, to get the whey from it by early breaking the curd ; the last method deprives it of many of its oily particles, and is therefore less proper. Put the vat on a ladder over the tub, and fill it with curd by the skimmer ; press the curd close with your hand, and add more as it sinks ; and it must be finally left two inches above the edge. Before the vat is filled, the cheese-cloth must be laid at the bottom : and when full, drawn smooth over on all sides. There are two modes of salting cheese : one by mix- ing it in the curd while in the tub after the whey is out; and the other by putting it into the vat and crumbling the curd all to pieces with it, after the first .squeezing with the hands has dried it. The first method appears best on some accounts, but not on all; and therefore the custom of the country must direct. Put a board under and over the vat, and place it in the press ; in two hours turn it out and put a fresh cheese- cloth ; press it again for eight or nine hours ; then Balt it all over, and turn it again in the vat, and let it â€¢stand in the press fourteen or sixteen hours, observing to put the cheeses last made undermost. Jiefore put- ting them the last time into the vat, pare the eilges if they do not look smooth. The vat should have holes at the sides and at bottom, to let all the whey pass through.

MISCKLLANEOUS ODSERVATIONS. XXXV dis[ileaseil that a servant leaves their service ; but this is unpardonable, and an absolute robbery, ser- vants having no inheritance, and depending on their name for employment. To refuse countenance to the evil, and to encourage the good servant, aro actions due to society at large ; and such as aro honest, frugal, and attentive to their duties, should be liberally rewarded, which would encourage merit, and inspire servants with zeal to acquit themselves. â€”It may be proper to observe, that a retributive justice usually marks persons in that station, sooner or later, even in this world. The extravagant and idle in servitude are ill prepared for the industry and sobriety on which their own future welfare so essentially depends. Their faults, and the atten- dant punishment, come home when they have chil- dren of their own ; and sometimes much sooner. They will see their own folly and wickedness per- petuated in their offspring, whom they must not expect to be better than the example and instruc- tion given by themselves. It was the observation of a sensible and expe- rienced woman, that she could always read the fate of her servants who married; those who had been faithful and industrious in her service, continued their good habits in their own families, and became respectable members of the community; those who were the contrary, never were successful, and not unfrequently were reduced to the parish. A proper quantity of household articles should be always ready, and more bought in before the others be consumed, to prevent inconvenience, es- pecially in the country. A bill of parcels and recepit should be required, even if the money be paid at the time of purchase}

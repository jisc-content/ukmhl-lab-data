MISCKI.LANEOUS OBSERVATIONS. XXXVli An inventory of furniture, linen, and china, sliould be kept, and the things examined by it twice a-year, or oftener, if there be a change of servants ; into each of whose care the articles used by him or her should be entrusted, with a list, as is done with plate. Tickets of parchment with the family name, numbered, and specifying what bed it belongs to, should be sewed on each feather-bed, bolster, pillow, and blanket. Knives, forks, and house-cloths, are often deficient: these accidents might be obviated, if an article at the head of every list required the former should be produced whole or broken, aud the marked part of the linen, though all the others should be worn out. The inducement to care of glass is in some measure removed, by the increased price given for old flint-glass.—Those who wish for trifle-dishes, butter-stands, &c. at a lower charge than cut-glass, may buy them made in moulds, of which there is great vai’iety, that look extremely well, if not placed near the more beau- tiful articles.—The price of starch depends upon that of flour ; the best will keep good in a dry wann room for some years ; therefore when bread is cheap it may be bought to advantage, and covered close. Sugars being an article of considerable expense in all families, the purchase demands particular attention.

The best sort of brown has a white gravelly look, and it is often to be bought pure as imported. East India sugars are finer for the price, but not so strong, conse- quently unfit for v/ines and sw'eetmeats, but do well

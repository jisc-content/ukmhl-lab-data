Vinegar by its acidity, does the same, the glazing being of lead or arsenic.—To cool liquora in hot weather, dip a cloth in cold water, and wrap it round the bottle two or three times, then place it in the sun ; renew the process once or twice.—The best way of scalding fruits, or boiling vinegar, is in a hot iron hearth ; or by putting the vessel into a sauce- pan of water, called a water-bath.—If chocolate, coffee, jelly, gruel, bark, &c. be suffered to boil over, the strength is lost.—The cook should be encoura- ged to be careful of coals and cinders ; for the lat- ter there is a new contrivanee to sift without disper- sing the dust of the ashes, by means of a covered till bucket.—Small coal, wetted, makes the strong- est fii’e for the back, but must remain untouched until it cake.

See to fry, page 13. _ Soles that have been fried eat good cold with oil, vinegar, salt and mustard. Stewed Soles. Do as Carp, page 12. Soles another icay. Take two or three soles, divide tiiem from the back- bone, and take off the head, fins, and tail. Sprinkle the inside with salt, roll them up tight from the tail end upwards, and fasten with small skewers. If large or middling, put half a fish in each roll: small do not answer. Dip them into yolks of eggs, and cover them with crumbs. Do the egg over them again, and then put more crumbs ; and fry them a beautiful colour in lard, or for fast-day in clarified butter. Soles in the Portuguese way. Take one large, or two small: if large, cut the fish in two ; if small, they need only be split. The bones being taken out, put the fish into a pan with a bit of butter and some lemon juice, give a fry, then lay the fish on a dish, and spread a forcemeat over each piece, and roll it round, fastening the roll with a few small skewers. Lay the rolls into a small earthen pan, beat an egg and wet them, then strew crumbs over ; and put the remainder of the egg, with a little meat gravy, a spoonful of caper-liquor, an anchovy chopped fine, and some parsley chopped into the bottom of the pan ; cover it close, and bake it till the fish are done enough in a slow oven. Then place the rolls in the dish for serving, and cover it to keep them hot till the gravy bilked is skimmed; if not enough, a little fresh, fla- voured as above, must be prepared and added to it.

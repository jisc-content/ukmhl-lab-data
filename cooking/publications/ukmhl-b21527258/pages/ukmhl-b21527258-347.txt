n&iiiY. 2;J5 v.ill be very advantageous for the use of the parlour. Cheese for common family-use will be very well pro- duced by two meals of skim, and one of new milk ; or. in good land, by skim-milk only. Butter likewise should be made, and potted down for winter-use, but not to interfere with the cheese as above, which will not take much time. To prepare Itennet, to turn the Milk, Take out the stomach of a calf as soon as killed, and scour it inside and out with salt, after it is cleared of the curd always found in it. Let it drain a few hours • then sew it up with two good handfuls-of salt in it, or stretch it on a stick welJ salted ; or keep it in the salt wet, and soak a bit, which will do over and over by fresh water. ^ Another icay.—Clean the maw asabove ; next day take two quarts of fresh spring-water, and put into it a liandful of hawthorn-tops, a handful of sweet-briar a handful of rose-leaves, a stick of cinnamon, forty cloves, four blades of mace, a sprig of knotted mar- joram, and two large spoonfuls of salt. Let them boil gently to three pints of water ; strain it off; and when only milk-warm, pour it on the veil (that is, the maw). Slice a lemon into it; let it stand two days ; strain it again, and bottle it for use. It will keep good at least twelve months, and has a very fine flavour. You may add any sweet aromatic herbs to the above. It must be pretty salt, but not brine. A little will do for turn- ing. Salt the veil again for a week or two, and dry it stretched on sticks crossed, and it will be near as strong as ever. Don’t keep it in a hot place when dry. 2'o make Cheese, Put the milk into a large tub, warming a part till it is of a degree of heat quite equal to new ; if too hot the cheese will be tough. Put in as much rennet as wjll turn it, and cover it over. Let it stand till com- pletely turned ; then strike the curd down several times

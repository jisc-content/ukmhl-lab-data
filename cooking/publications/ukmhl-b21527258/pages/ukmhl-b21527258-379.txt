It is a most supporting thing for those whom dis- ease has left very feeble. Caudle for the Sick and Lying-in. Set three quarts of water on the fire ; mix smooth as much oatmeal as will thicken the whole, with a pint of cold water ; when boiling, pour the latter in, and twenty Jamaica-peppers in fine powder ; boil to a good middling thickness ; then add sugar, half a pint of well-fermented table-beer, and a glass of gin. Boil all. This mess twice, and once or twice of broth, will be of incalculable service. There is not a better occasion for charitable com- miseration than when a person is sick.

Wash four dozen of the largest oysters you can get in their own liquor, wipe them dry, strain the liquor off, adding to it, a dessert-spoonful of pepper, two blades of mace, a table-spoonful of salt, if the liquor be not very salt, three of white wine, and four of vinegar.—Simmer the oysters a few minutes in the liquor, then put them in small jars and boil the pickle up, skim it, and when cold, pour over the oysters ; cover close. Another way to pickle Oysteos. Open the number you intend to pickle, put them into a saucepan with their own liquor for ten minntes, simmer them very gently ; then put them into a jar, one by one, that none of the grit may stick to them, and cover them when cold with the pickle thusmade^ Boil the liquor with a bit of mace, lemon-peel, and black peppers, and to every hundred put two spoon- fulRofthe best undistilled vinegar. Tliey should be kept in small jars, and tied close with bladder, for the air will spoil them. Note.—Directions for making Fish Pies will be found under the head Pies.

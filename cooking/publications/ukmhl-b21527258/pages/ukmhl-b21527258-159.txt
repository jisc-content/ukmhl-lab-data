Cover them with butter, then with very thick paper tied down, .and bake them. When cold, put them dry into pots that will hold two or three in each ; and pour butter over them, using that which was baked as part. Observe that the butter should be pretty thick over them, if they are to be kept. If pigeons were boned, and then put in an oval form into the pot, they would lie closer, and require less butter. They may be stuffed with a fine forcemeat made with veal, bacon, &c. and then they will eat excellently. If a high flavour is ap- proved of, add mace, allspice, and a little Cayenne, before baking.

Baste gently with butter, and strew bread-crumbs upon them till lialf-done ; brown and serve with fried crumbs round. GAME, ETC. To keep Game, ^c. Game ought not to be tin-own away even when it has been kept a very long time; for when it seems to be spoiled it may often be made fit for eating, by nicely cleaning it, and washing with vinegar and water. If there is danger of birds not keeping, draw, crop, and pick them ; then wash in two or three waters, and rub them witli salt. Have ready a large sauce-pan of boiling water, and plunge them into it one by one ; drawing them up and down by the legs, that the water may pass through them. Let them stay five or six minutes in ; then hang them up in a cold place. When drained, pepper and salt the insidesf well. Be- fore roasting, wash them well. The most delicate birds, feven grouse), may be pre- served thus. Those that live by suction cannot be done this way, as they are never drawn ; and perhaps 70 11

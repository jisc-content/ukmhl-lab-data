DOMESTIC COOKERY. 2()G perfectly smooth, you may have three gallons and three qii.arts of bran-water clear. With this knead fifty-site pounds of the flour, adding salt and yeast in the same way and proportions as for other bread. When ready to bake, divide it into loaves, and bake them two hours and a half. Thus made, flour will imbibe three quarts more of bran-water than of plain ; so that it not only produces a more nutritious substantial food, but makes an in- crease of one-fifth of the usual quantity of bread, which i i a saving of one day’s consumption out of six ; and if this was adopted throughout the kingdom, it would make a saving of ten million sterling a year, when 'vheat was at the price it stood in the scarcity, reckon- ing the consumption to be two hundred thousand bushels a day. The same quantity of flour which, kneaded with water, produces sixty-nine pounds eight ounces of bread, will, in the above way make eighty- three pounds eight ounces, and gain fourteen pounds. ■\t the ordinary price of flour four millions would be saved.

Simmer a pound of rice in two quarts of water till it becomes perfectly soft; when it is of a proper tvarmth, mix it extremely well with four pounds of flour, and yeast and salt as for other bread ; of yeast about four large spoonfuls ; knead it extremely well ; then set it to rise before the fire.

The whole expense, including baking, will not exceed three rhillinu's, for which eight pounds and a half of exceed- ingly good bread willbe produced. If the rice should require more water, it must be added, as some rice swells more tlian others. French Bread.

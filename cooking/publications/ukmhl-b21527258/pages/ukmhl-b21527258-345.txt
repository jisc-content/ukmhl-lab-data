283 DAIRV. la, &c. A change of pasture will tend to increase it. People who attend properly to the dairy will feed the cows particolai-ly well two or three weeks before they calve, which makes the milk more abundant after. In gentlemen’s dairies more attention is paid to the size and beauty of the cows tlian to their produce, which dairymen look most to. For making cheese the cows should calve from Lady-day to x'lay, that the large (juantity of milk may come into use about the same time ; but in gentle- men’s families one or two should calve in August or September for a supply in winter. In good pastures, the average produce of a dairy is about three gallons a-day each cow, from Lady-day to Michaelmas, and from thence to Christmas one gallon a-day. Cow.s will be profitable milkers to fourteen or fifteen yearn of age, if of a proper breed. ^V'hen a calf is to be reared, it should be taken from the cow in a week at furthest, or it will cause great trouble in rearing, because it will be difficult to make it take milk in a pan. Take it from the cow in the morning, and keep it without food till the ne.xt morning ; and then, being hungry, it will drink without difiiculty. Skimmed milk and fresh whey, just as warm as new milk, should be given twice a-day in such quantity a.s is required. If milk runs short, smooth gruel mixed with milk will do. At fir.st let the calf be out only by day, and feed it at night and morning. When the family is absent, or there is not a great call for cream, a careful dairy-maid seizes the oppor- tunity to provide for the winter-store: she should have a book to keep an account, or get some one to write down for her the produce of every week, and set down what butter she pots. The weight the pot will hold should be marked on each in making at the pottery. In another part of the book should be stated the poultry reared in one leaf, and the weekly cou- EUinption in another part.

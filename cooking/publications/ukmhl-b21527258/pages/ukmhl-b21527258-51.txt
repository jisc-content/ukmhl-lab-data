DIRECTIONS FOR CARVING. o Thr carving-knife for a lady should be light, and of a middling size and fine edge. Strength is less required than address in the maimer of using it; and, to facili- tate this, the cook'lioiildgiveorders to the butcher to divide the joints of the bones of all carcase-joints of mutton, lamb, and veal, (such as neck, breast, and loin ;) which may then be easily cut into thin slices attached to the adjoining bones.

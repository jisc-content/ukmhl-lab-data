200 I50ME3TIC COOKBa?. one half- otirce of black pepper, one half ounce of cloves, one ounce of ginger, one half-ounce of all- spice, and a good handful of saltâ€”pour the whole, boiling hot, upon the w'alnuts, and cover them close ; they will be fit for use in three or four months. You may add two ounces of garlick, or shalots, but not boiled in the vinegar. Of the pickle in which the walnuts stood for the first four months, yon may make excellent ketchup. An excellent way to pi chi e Mushrooms, to preserve the flavour. Buttons must be rubbed with a bit of flannel and salt ; and from the larger, take out the red inside, for when they are black they will not do, being too old. Tlirow a little salt over, and put them into a stew-pan with some mace and pepper ; as the liqnor comes out shake them well, and keep them over a gentle fire till all of it be dried into them again ; then put as much vinegar into the pan as will cover them, give it one warm, and turn all into a glass or stone jar. They will keep two years, and arc delicious. To pickle lied Cabbage. Slice it into a colander, and sprinkle each layer with salt ; let it drain two days, then put it into a jar, and pour boiling vinegar enough to cover, and put a few slices of red beet-root. Observe to choose the purple red cabbage. Those who like the flavour of spice will boil it with the vinegar. Cauliflower cut in branches, and thrown in after being salted, will look of a beautiful red. Mushroom Ketchup. Take the largest broad mushrooms, break them into an earthen pan, strew salt over, and stir tliem now and then for three days. Then let them stand for twelve, till there is a thick scum over ; strain, and boil the liquor with Jamaica and black peppers, mace, ginger, a clove or two, and some mustard-seed.

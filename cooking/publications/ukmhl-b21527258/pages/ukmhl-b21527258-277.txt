Observe, feet tor all jellies are boiled so long by the people who sell them, that they are less nutritious ; they should be only scalded to take off the hair. The liquor will require greater care in removing the fat ; but the jelly will be far stronger, and of course allow more water. Note.—Jelly is equally good made of cow-heels nicely cleaned ; and as they bear a less price than those of calves, and make a stronger jelly, this observation may be useful. Another sort.—Boil four quarts of water with three calf’s feet, or two cow-heels, that have lieen only scjilded. till half wasted ; take the jelly from the fat and sediment ; mix with it the juice of a Seville orange, and twelve lemons, the peels of three ditto, the whites and shells of twelve eggs, brown sugar to taste, near a pint of raisin wine, one ounce of coriander- seeds, a quarter of an ounce of allspice, a bit of cin- namon, tiud six cloves, all bruised, after having pre- viously mixed them cold. The jelly should boil fifteen muiutes without stirring ; then clear it through a flannel hag. While running, take a little jelly, and mix with a tea-cupful of water, in which a bit of beet- root has been boiled, and run it through the bag when all the rest is run out ; and this is to garnish the other jelly, being cooled on a plate; but this is matter of choice. 'Ihis jelly has a very fine high colour and tkivour. Orange Jelly. Grate the rind of two Seville and two China oranges, and two lemons ; squeeze the juice of three of each, ii.:>d strain, and tvdd the juice of a qmirter of a pound

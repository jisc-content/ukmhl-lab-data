DOMESTIC COOKEUf. 290 cleansed from the milk, put one ounce of this com- position ; work it well, and pot down, when becomo firm and cold. The butter thus preserved is the better for keeping, and should not be used under a month. This article should be kept from the air, and is best in pots of the best glazed earth, that will hold from ten to fourteen pounds each. Tojyreserve Butter for Winter, the best tcay. When the butter has been prepared, as above direct- ed, take two parts of the best common salt, one part of good loaf-sugar, and one part of saltpetre, beaten and blended well together.

Press it into the pans after the but- ter is become cool; for friction, though it be not touched by the hands, will soften it. The pans should hold ten or twelve pounds each. On the top put some salt ; and when that is turned into brine, if not enough to cover the butter entirely, add some strong salt and water. It reijuires only then to be covered from the dust.

As the cream rises, skim it till no more comes; then churn it. Where new-milk cheese is made daily, whey-butter for common and present use may be made to advantage. To scald Cream, as in the West of England. In winter iet the milk stand twenty-four hours, in the summer twelve at least; then put the milk-pan on a hot hearth, if you have one ; if not, set it in a wide brass kettle of water, large enough to receive the pan. It must remain on the fire till quite hot, but on no ac- count boil, or there will be a skin instead of a cream upon the milk. You will know when done enouglv-

MEAT. 67 To collar Pig's Head. Scour the head and ears nicely ; take off the hair ind snout, and take out the eyes and the brain ; lay it into water one niffht; then drain, salt it extremely well with common salt and saltpetre, and let it lie live days. Boil it enough to take out the bones ; then lay it on a dresser, turning the thick end of one side of the head towards the thin end of the other, to make the roll of equal size ; sprinkle it well with salt and white pepper, and roll it with the ears; aud if you approve, put the pig’s feet round the outside when boned, or the thin parts of two cow-heels. Put it in a cloth, bind with a broad tape, and boil it till quite tender: then put a good weight upon it, and don’t take off the cover- ing till cold. If you choose it to be more like brawn, salt it longer, and let the proportion of saltpetre be greater ; and put in also some pieces of lean pork; and then cover it with cow-heel, to look like the horn. This may be kept either in or out of pickle of salt aud water boiled with vinegar; and is a very con- venient thing to have in the house. If likely to spoil, slice and fry it either with or without batter. To dry Hog's Cheeks. Cut out the snout, remove the brains, and split the bead, taking off the upper bone, to make the jowl a good shape; rub it well with salt ; next day take away the brine, and salt it again the following day : cover the head with half an ounce of saltpetre, two ounces of bay-salt, a little common salt, and four ounces of coarse sugar. Let the head be often turned ; after ten days smoke it for a week like bacon. To force Hog's Ears. Parboil two pair of ears, or take some that have been soused ; make a forcemeat of an anchovy, some sage, parsley, a quarter of a pound of suet choppeii,

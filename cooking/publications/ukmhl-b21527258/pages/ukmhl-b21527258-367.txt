SIKK COOKiiUY. 30') Etjgs. An egg broken into a cup of tea, or beaten and mixed with a basin of milk, makes a breakfast more sripport- ing than tea solely. An egg divided, and the yolk and white beaten separately, then mixed with a glass of wine, 'will afford two very wholesome draughts, and prove lighter than when taken together. Eggs very little boiled, or poached, taken in small quantity, convey much nourishment ; the yolk, only, when dressed, should be eaten by invalids. A great Restorative. Bake two calves’ feet in two pints of water, and the same quantity of new milk, in a jar close covered, three hours and a half. AVhen cold, remove the fat. Give a large tea-cupful the last and first thin/j. Whatever flavour is approved, give it by baking in it lemon-peel, cinnamon, or mace. Add sugar after. Another.—Simmer six sheep's trotters, two blades of mace, a little cinnamon, lemon-peel, a few hartshorn- shavings, and a little isinglass, in two quarts of water to one ; when cold, take off the fat, and give near half a pint twice a day, warming with it a little new milk. Another.—Boil one ounce of isinglass shavings, forty Jamaica peppers, and a bit of brown crust of bread, in a quart of water to a pint, and strain it. This makes a pleasant jelly to keep in the house ; of which a large spoonful may be taken in wine and water, milk, tea, soup, or any way. Another, a most pleasant Draught.—Boil a quar- ter of an ounce of isinglass-.-havings with a pint of new milk to half ; add a bit of sugar, and, for change, a bitter almond. Give this at bed-time, not too warm. Dutch flummery, blainange, and jellies, as directed in pages 204, 206, and 214, or less rich, accord'iig to jndjraeut. 70 X

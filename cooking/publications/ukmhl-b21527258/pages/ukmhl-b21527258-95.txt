33 MEAT. Hashed Venison Should be wanned with its own gravy, or some with- out seasoning, as before ; and only warmed through, not boiled. If there is no fat left, cut some slices of mutton-fat, set it on the fire with a little port wine and sugar, simmer till dry, then put to the ash, and it will eat as well as the fat of the venison.—For Veni~ son Pasty look umler the head Pastry ; as like- wise an excellent imitation. BEEP. To keep Beef. The butcher should take out the kernels in the neck- pieces where the shoulder-clod is taken off, two from each round of beef ; one in the middle which is called the pope’s-eye ; the other from the flap : there is also one in the thick flank, in the middle of the fat. If these are not taken out, especially in the summer, salt will be of no use for keeping the meat sweet. There is another kernel between the rump and tho edgebone. As the butchers seldom attend to this matter, tho cook should take out the kernels ; and then rub the salt well into such beef as is for boiling, and slightly sprinkle that which is for roasting. The flesh of cattle that are killed when not perfectly cleared of food, soon spoils. They should fast twen- ty-four hours in winter, and double that time in sum- mer, before being killed. To salt Beef or Pork for eating immediately. The piece should not weigh more than five or si.x pounds. Salt it very thoroughly just before you put It into the pot; take a coarse cloth, flour it well, put the meat in, and fold it up close. Put it into a pot of boiling, water, and boil it as long as you would any other salt beef of the same size, and it will be as salt as if done four or five days. 70 D

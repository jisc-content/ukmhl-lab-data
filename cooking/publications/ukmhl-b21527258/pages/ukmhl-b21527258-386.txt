324 DOMESTIC COOKERY. Suffolk clieese does better tlian any other of this conn- try. To take Stains of any Kind out of Linen. Stains caused by Acids.—Wet the part, and lay on it some salt of wormwood. Then rub it without dilut- ing it with more water. Another.—Let the cloth imbibe a little water with- out dipping, and hold the part over a lighted match at a due distance. The spots will be removed by the sulphureous gas. Another icay.—Tie up in the stained part some pearl-ash ; then scrape some soap into cold soft water to make a lather, and boil the linen until the stain dis- appears. Stains of Wine, Fruit, frc. after they have been long in the Linen.—Rub the part on each side with yellow soap. Then lay on a mixture of starch in cold water very thick ; rub it well in, and expose the linen to the sun and air till the stain comes out. If not re- moved in three or four days, rub that off, and renew the process. When dry, it may be sprinkled with a little water. Many other Stains may be taken out by dipping the linen in sour butter-milk, and drying in a hot sun. Then wash it in cold water, and dry it, two or three times a day. Iron-moulds should be wetted ; then laid on a hot water-plate, and a little essential salt of lemons put on the part. If the linen becomes dry, wet it and renew the process; observing that the plate is kept boiling hot. Much of the powder sold under the name of salt of lemons is a spurious preparation ; and therefore it is necessary to dip the linen in a good deal of water, and wash it as soon as the stain is removed, to prevent the part from being worn into holes by the acid. 'To take out Mildew.—Mix soft soap with starch . powdered, half as much salt, and the juice of a lemon j J lay it on the part of both sides with a painter’s brush. J

3 Fisn. Gudgeon.i.—Thcy are cliosen by the same rules as other fish, niey uro taken in running streams ; come in about Midsummer, and are to be liad for five or six months. £els.—There is a greater difference in the goodness of eels than of any other fish. The true silver-eel (sa called from the bright colour of the belly) is caught in the Thames. The Dutch eels sold at Billingsgate are very bad ; those ta'ken in great floods are gener- ally good, but in ponds they have usually a strong rank flavour. Except the middle of summer they are always in season. Lobslerx.— If they have not been long taken, the claws will have a strong motion when you put your finger on the eyes and press them.

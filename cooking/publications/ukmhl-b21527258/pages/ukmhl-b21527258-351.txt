DAIRY. 2R9 V/hen the milk is strained into the pans, put to ever}' fix gallons one gallon of boiling water. Or dissolve one ounce of nitre in a pint of spring-water, and put a quarter of a pint to every fifteen gallons of milk. Or, when you churn, keep back a quarter of a pint of tile sour cream, and put it into a well-scalded pot, into which you are to gather the next cream ; stir that well, and do so with every fresh addition. To make Batter. During summer, skim the milk when the sun has not heated the dairy ; at that season it should stand for butter twenty-four hours without skimming, and forty- eight in winter. Deposit the cream-pot in a very cold cellar, if your dairy is not more so. If yon cannot churn daily, cliange it into scalded fresh pots ; but never omit churning twice a week. If possible, put the churn in a thorough air ; and if not a b.arrel one, set it in a tub of water two feet deep, which will give firmness to the butter. When the butter is come, pour off the butter-milk, and put the butter into a fresh- scalded pan, or tubs which have afterwards been in cold water. Pour water on it, and let it lie to acquire some hardness before you work it; then change the water, and beat it with flat boards so perfectly that not the least taste of tlie butter-milk remain, and that the water, which must be often changed, shall be quite clear in colour. Then work some salt into it, weigli, and make it into forms ; throw them into cold water, in an earthen pan and cover of the queenâ€™s ware. You will then have very nice and cool butter in the hottest weather. It requires more working in hot than in cold weather ; but in neither should be left with a particle of butter-milk, or a sour taste, as is sometimes done. To preserve Butter. Take two parts of the best common salt, one part of good loaf-sugar, and one part of s-altpetre ; beat them ivell together. To sixteen onnces of butter tiioroughly 70 V

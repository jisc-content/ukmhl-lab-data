Dissolve Rii ounce of Glauber’s salts in a quart of water ; mix the meal of potatoes with a little of the liquor, and feed the hens two days, giving them plenty of clean water to drink. The above quantity is suthcient for six or eight hens. They should have plenty of clean w’ater in reach. In a few days they will produce eggs. 2'o fatten JToivls or Chickens in four or five Days.

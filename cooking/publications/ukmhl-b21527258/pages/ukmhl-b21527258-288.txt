DOMESCIC COOKERY. Cheese Toast.—Mix some fine butter, made mu.j- tard, and salt, into a mass ; spread it on fresh-made thin toasts, and grate or scrape Gloucester cheese upon them. Anchovy Toast.—Bone and skin six or eight an- cliovies; pound them to a mass with an ounce of tine butter till the colour is equal, and then spread it on toasts or rusks. Another way.—Cut thin slices of bread into any form, and fry them in clarilied butter. Wash three anchovies split, pound them in a mortar with some fresh butter, rub them through a hair-sieve, and spread on the toast when cold. Then quarter and wash some anchovies, and lay them on the toast. Garnish with parsley or pickles. To poach Eggs.—Set a stew-pan of water on the fire ; when boiling, slip an egg previously broken into a cup, into the water ; when the white looks done enough, slide an egg-slice under the egg, and lay it on toast and butter, or spinach. As soon a-s enough are done, serve hot. If not fresh laid, they will not poach w'ell, and without breaking. Trim the ragged parts v)f the whites, and make them look round. Buttered Eggs. Beat four or five eirgs, yolk and white together, put a quarter of a pound of butter in a basin, and then put that in boihng water, stir it till melted, then pour that butter and the eggs into a sauce-pan ; keep a basin in your liand, just hold the sauce-pan in the t)ther over a slow part of the fire, shaking it one way, as it begins to w’arm ; pour it into a basin, and back, then hold it again over the fire, stirring it constantly in the sauce-pan, and pouring it into the basin, more perfectly to mix the egg and butter, until they shall be hot without boiling. Serve on toasted bread ; or in ft baein, to eat with salt-fish, or red herrings.

DOMESTIC COOKEUT. 83 POULTRY. To boil turliey. Make a stuffing of bread, herbs, salt, pepper, nut- meg, lemon-peel, a few oysters or an anchovy, a bit of butter, some suet, and an egg : put this into the crop, fasten up the skin, and boU the turkey in a floured cloth to make it very white. Have ready oyster-sauce made with butter, a httle cream, and a spoonful of soy, if approved ; and pour it over the bird ; or liver and lemon-sauce. Hen-birds are best for boiling, and should be young. To roast Turkey. The sinews of the legs should be drawn, which-ever way it is dressed. The head should be twisted under the wing ; and in drawing it, take care not to tear the liver, nor let the gall touch it. Put a staffing of sausage-meat; or if sausages are to be served in the dish, a bread stuffing. As this makes a large addition to the size of the bird, observe that the heat of the fire is constantly to that part ; for the breast is often not done enough. A little strip of paper should be put on the boue, to hinder it from scorching while the other parts roast. Baste well and froth it up. Serve with gravy in the dish, and plenty of bread-sauce in a sauce-tureen. Add a few crumbs, and a beaten egg to the stuffing of sausage- meat. Pulled Turkey. Divide the meat of the breast by pulling instead of cutting ; then warm it in a spoonful or two of white gravy, and a little cream, grated nutmeg, salt, and a little flour and butter ; donâ€™t boil it. The leg should be seasoned, scored, and broiled, and put into the dish v/ith the above round it. Cold chicken does as well. To boil Fold. For boiling, choose those that are not black-legged. Pick them nicely, singe, wash, and truss them. Flout

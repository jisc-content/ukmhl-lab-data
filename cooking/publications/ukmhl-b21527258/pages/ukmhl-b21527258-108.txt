DOMESTIC COOKEUY. 46 Slewed Ox-cheeh, plain. Soak and cleanse a fine cheek the day before it is to be eaten ; put it into a stew-pot that mil cover close, with three quarts of water : simmer it after it has boiled up and been well-skimmed. In two hours put plenty of carrots, leeks, two or three turnips, a bunch of sweet herbs, some whole pepper, and four ounces of allspice. Skim it often ; when the meat is tender take it out ; let the soup get cold, take off the cake of fat, and serve the soup separate or with the meat. It should be of a fine brown, which may be done by burnt sugar ; or by frying some onions quite brown with flour, and simmering them with it. Tliis last way improves the flavour of all soups and gravies of the brown kind. If vegetables are not approved in the soup, they may be taken out, and a small roll be toasted or bread fried and added. Celery is a great addition, and should always be served. Where it is not to be got, the seed of it gives quite as good a flavour, boiled in and strained ofl. To dress an Ox-cheek another way. Soak half a head three hours, and clean it with plenty of water. Take the meat off the bones, and put it into a pan with a large onion, a bunch of sweet herbs, some bruised allspice, pepper, and salt. Lay the bones on the top ; pour on two or three quarts of water and cover the pan close with brown j)aper, or a dish that will fit close. Let it stand eight or ten hours in a slow oven ; or simmer it by the side of the fire, or on a hot hearth. When done tender, put the meat into a clean pan, and let it get cold. Take the cake of fat off, and warm the head in pieces in the soup. Put what vegetables you choose. Ma?row-bones. Cover the top with floured cloth ; boil them and serve with dry toast.

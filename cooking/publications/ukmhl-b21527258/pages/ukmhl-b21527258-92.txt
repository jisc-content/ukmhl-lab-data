Tlie meat sliould be put at a good distance from tbs fire, and brought gradually nearer when the inner part becomes hot, which will prevent its being scorched T/hile yet raw* JVleat should be much basted ^ and when nearly done, floured to make it look frothed. Veal and mutton sliould have a little paper put over the fat to preserve it. If not fat enough to allow for basting, a little good dripping answers as well as butter. The cook should be careful not to run the spit through the best parts; and should observe that it be well cleaned before and at tbe time of serving, or a black stain appears on the meat.

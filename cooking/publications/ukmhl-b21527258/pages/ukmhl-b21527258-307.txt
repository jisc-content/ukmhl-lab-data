TO PIlESEnVE FRUITS FOR WI.NTER USE. Observations on Sweetmeats. Sweetmeats should be kept carefully from the air, and m a very dry place. Unless they have a very smal 1 jn-oportion of sug.rr, a warm one does not hurt ; but when not properly boiled, that is, long enough, but not quick, heat makes them ferment ; and damp causes them to grow mouldy. They should be looked at two or three times in the first two months, that they may be gently boiled again, if not likely to keep. It is necessary to observe, that the boiling of sugar more or less, constitutes the chief art of the confec- tioner, and those who are not practised in this know- ledge, and only preserve in a plain way for family use, are not aware that, in two or three minutes, a syrup j 1 will pass from one gradation to another, called by the confectioners degrees of boiling, of which tiiere we six, and Uiose subdivided. But I am not versed in the minutite, and only make the observation to guard against underboiling, which prevents sweet- iiieats from keeping; and quick boiling and long, which brings them to a candy. Attention, without much practice, will enable a per- son to do any of the following sorts of sweetmeats, &c. and they are as much as is wanted in a private family ; the liigher articles of preserved fruits may be bought at less expense tlun made.

DOMESTIC COOKERY. HO aikl some sliced onions, pepper, and salt; pour hoi v.ater or weak broth on them ; stew and skim well. Mutton Steaks Maintenon. Half-fry, stew them, while hot, with herbs, crumbs, and seasoning ; put them in paper immediately, and finish on the gridiron. Be careful the paper does not catch ; rub a bit of butter on it first to prevent that. Mutton Sausages. Take a pound of the rawest part of a leg of mutton that has been either roasted or boiled ; chop it ex- tremely small, and season it with pepper, salt, mace, and nutmeg: add to it six ounces of beef-suet, some sweet herbs, two anchovies, and a pint of oysters, all chopped very small; a quarter of a pound of grated bread, some of the anchovy-liquor, and the yolks and whites of two eggs well beaten. Put it all, when well mixed, into a little pot; and use it by rolling it into balls, or sausage-shape, and frying. If approved, a little shalot may be added, or garhek, which is a great im- j)rovement. I'o dress Mutton Rumps and Kidney. Stew six rumps in some good mutton-gravy half an hour ; then lake them up, and let them stand to cool. Clear the gravy from the fat ; and put into it four ounces of boiled rice, an onion stuck with cloves, and a blade of mace ; boil them till the rice is thick. Wash the rumps with yolks of egg well beaten ; and strew over them crumbs of bread, a little pepper and salt, chopped parsley, and thyme, and grated lemon-peel, l-'ry in butter of a fine brown. While the rumps are stewing, lard the kidneys, and put them to roast in a Dutch oven. When the rumps are fried, the grease must be drained before they are put on the dish, and the pan being cleared likewise from the fat, warm the rice in it. Lay the latter on the dish ; the rumps put ro\ind on the rice, the narrow ends towards the middle, and the kidneys between. Garnish with hard egg?

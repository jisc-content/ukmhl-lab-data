Put the meat into cold water, and flour it well first. Meat boiled quick will be hard ; but care must be taken that in boiling slow it does not stop, or the meat will be underdone. If the steam is kept in, the water will not lessen much ; therefore when you wish it to boil away, Uke ofl' the cover of tlie soup-pot. Vegetables should not be dressed with the meat, except carrots or parsnips with boiled beef. As to the length of time required for roasting and boiling, the size of the joint must direct ; as also the strength of the fire, the nearness of the meat to it, and in boiling, the regular though slow progress it makes ; for if the cook, when told to hinder the cop- per from boiling quick, let it stop from boiling up at all, the usual time will not be suificient, and the meat will be underdone. Weigh the meat, and allow for all solid joints a quarter of an hour for every pound, and some minutes (from ten to twenty) over, according as the family like it done. A ham of twenty pounds will take four hours and a half, and others in proportion. A tongue, if dry, takes four hours slow boiling after soaking ; a tongue out of pickle, from two and a half to three hours, or more if very large ; it must be judgec^ by feeling whether it is very tender. A leg of pork or of lamb, takes the full allowance of twenty minutes, above a quarter of an hour to a pound. In roasting, beef of ten pounds will take above two hours and a half ; twenty pounds will take three hours and three quarters. A neck of mutton will take an hour and a half, if kept at a proper distance. A chine of pork two hours.

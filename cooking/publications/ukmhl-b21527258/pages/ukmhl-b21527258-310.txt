Hold the sieve in the water till the fruit begins to look scalded on the outside ; tlien turn them gently out of the sieve on a cloth ou the dresser, cover them with another cloth, and put some more to be scalded, and so on till all be finished. Observe not to put one quantity on another, or they will become too soft. Tlie next day pick out any bad or broken ones, bottle the rest, and fill up the bottles with the alum-water in which they were scalded, which must be kept in the bottles : for if left in the kettle, or in a glazed pan, it will spoil. Stop them close. The water must boil all the time the process is carry- ing on. Gooseberries done this way make as fine tarts as fresh off the trees. Another way.—In dry weather pick the gooseber- ries that are full grown, but not ripe; top and tail them,and put into open-mouthed bottles ; gently cork them with new velvet corks ; put them in the oven when the bread is drawn, and let them stand till shrunk a quarter part ; take them out of the oven, and ira - mediately beat the corks in tight, cut off the tops, and rosin down close ; set them in a dry place ; and if well secured from air they will keep the year round. If gathered in the damp, or the gooseberries’ skins are the least cut in taking off the stalks and buds, they will mould. The hairy sort only must be used for keep- ing, and do them before the seeds become large. Currants and damsons may be done the same way. To heep Damsons for Winter Pies. Put them in small stone jars, or wide mouthed bot- tles ; set them up to their necks in a boiler of cold water, and lighting a fire under, scald them. Next day, when perfectly cold, fill up with spring water ; cover them. Another tcay,—Boil one-third as much sugar as fruit with it, over a slow fire, till the juice adheres to the fruit, and forms a jam. Keep it in small jars in a dry place. If too sweet, mix with it some of the fruit tliat is done without sugar.

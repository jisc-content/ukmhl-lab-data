The eatable mushrooms first appear very small, and of a round form, on a little stalk. Tliey grow very fast, and the upper part and stalk are white. As the size increases the under part gradually opens, and s-hews a fringy fur of a very tine salmon-colour, which continues more or less till the mushroom has gained some size, and then turns to a dark brown. These marks should be attended to, and likewise whether the skin can be easily parted from the edges aird middle. Those that have white oryellew fur should be carefully avoided, though many of them have the same smell (but not so strong) as the right sort.

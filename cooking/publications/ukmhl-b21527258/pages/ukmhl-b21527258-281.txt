Slices of bread, or rice, may bo either stewed with the fruit, or added, when oaten , Uie rice being plain boiled. To prepare Ice for Iting, Get a few pounds of ice, break it almost to powder, throw a hirge handful and a half of salt among it. You must prepare it in a part of the house where ns little of the warm air comes as you can possibly con- trive. The ice and salt being in a backet, put your cream into an ice-jiot, and cover it; immerse it in fjie ice, and draw that round the pot, so as to touch every po.ssible part. In a few minutes put a spatula or spoon in, and stir it well, removing the parts that ice round the edges to the centre. If the ice-crean) >r water be in a form, shut the bottom close, and move tlie whole in the ice, as you cemuot use a spoon to that without danger of waste. There should be lioles in the bucket, to let off the ice as it thaws.

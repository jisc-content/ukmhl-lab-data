POUl.TilY-YARD. 2P7 place, which would prevent their straggling too far to lay. Places near the water to lay in are advantageous ; and these might be small wooden houses, with a parti- tion in the middle, and a door at each end. They eat liny thing ; and when to be fattened, must have plenty, however coarse, and in three weeks they will be fat. Geese Require little expense; as they chiefly support them- selves on commons, or in lanes, where they can get water, 'fhe largest are esteemed best, as also are the white and grey. The pied and dark coloured are not so good. Tliirty days is generally the time the goose sits, but in warm weather she will sometimes hatch sooner. Olive them plenty of food, such as scalded bran and light oats ; and as soon as the goslings are hatched, keep them housed for eight or ten days, and feed them with barley-meal, bran, curds, &c. For green geese, begin to fatten them at six or seven weeks old, and feed them as above. Stubble geese require no fatten- ing if they have the run of good fields. 2'tirkies Are very tender when young. As soon as hatched, put three pepper-corns down their throat. Great care is necessary to their well-being, because the hen is so careless that she will walk about with one chick, and leave the remainder, or even tread upon and kill them. Turkies are violent eaters ; and must therefore be left to take charge of themselves in general, except one good feed a-day. The hen sits twenty-five or thirty days ; and the young ones must be kept warm, or the least cold or damp kills them. They must be fed often ; and at a distance from the hen which will eat every thing from them. They should have curds, green-cheese jinrings cut small, and bread and milk with chopped wormwood in it ; and their drink milk and water, but not left to be sour. All young fowls are a prey for vermin, therefore they should be kept in a safe place where none can come; weasels, stoats, ferrets, fee. creep in at very small crevices.

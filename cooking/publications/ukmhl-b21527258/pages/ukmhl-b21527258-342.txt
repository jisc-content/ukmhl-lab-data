2B0 DOMESTIC COOKERY. Rub the sugar over the lemons till it has absorbed all the yellow part of the skins. Then put into the bowl these lumps, and as much more as the juice of the lemons may be supposed to require ; for no certain weight can be mentioned, as the acidity of a lemon cannot be known till tried, and tlierefore this must be determined by the taste. Then squeeze the lemon-juice upon the sugar ; and .with a bruiser press the sugar and the juice particularly well together, for a great deal of the richness and tine flavour of the punch de- pends on this rubbing and mixing process being tho- roughly performed. Then mix this up very loell witli boiling water (soft water is best) till the w.ater is rather cool. When this mixture (which is now called the -sherbet) is to your taste, take brandy and rum in eqmd quantities, and put them to it, mixing the whole well together again, 'fhe quantity of liquor must be ac- cording to your taste : two good lemons are generally enough to make four quarts of punch, including a quart of liquor, with half a pound of sugar ; but this depends much on taste, and on the strength of the spirit. As the pulp is disagreeable to some persons, the sherbet may be strained before the liquor is put in. Some strain the lemon before they put it to the sugar, wliich is improper ; as, when the pulp and sugar are well mixed together, it adds much to tlie richness of the punch. When only rum is used, about half a pint of porter will soften the punch ; and even when both rum and brandy are used, the porter gives a richness, and to some a very pleasant fLavour. Tins receipt has never been in print before, but is greatly admired among the writerâ€™s friend.s. It is im- possible to take too much pains in all the processes of and in minding to do them extremely loell, tliat all the different articles may be most thoroughly incorporated together.

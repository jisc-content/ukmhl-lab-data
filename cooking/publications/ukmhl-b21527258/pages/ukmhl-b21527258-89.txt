27 MEAT. hraitm.—The liomy part of young brawn will feel Biuderately tender, and the tlavour will be better ; the rind of old will be hard. Observations on purchasing^ keeping, and dressing Meat. In every sort of provisions, the best of the kind goes farthest; it cuts out with most advantage, and affords most nourishment. Round of beef, fillk of veal, and leg of mutton, are joints that bear a higher price ; but as they have more solid meat, they deserve the preference. It is worth notice, however, that those joints which are inferior may be dressed as palatably; and being cheaper, they ought to be bought in tarn ; for, when they are weighed with the prime pieces, it makes the price of these come lower. In loins of meat, the long pipe that runs by the bone should be taken out, as it is apt to taint ; as also the kernels of beef. Rumps and edgebones of beef are often bruised by the blows the drovers give the beasts, and the part that has been struck always taints ; therefore do not purchase these joints if bruised. Tlie shank-bones of mutton should be saved ; and after soaking and brushing, may be added to give rich- ness to gravies or soups. They are also particularly nourishing for sick persons. \V hen sirloins of beef, or loins of veal or mutton, come in, part of the suet may be cut off for puddings, or to clarify. r o . Dripping will baste every thing as well as butter, except fowls and game ; and for kitchen pies, nothing else should be used. The fat ofiF a neck or loin of mutton makes a far lighter pudding than suet. iMeat and vegetables that the frost has touched, should be soaked in cold water two or three hours before used, or more if they are much iced. Putting them into hot water, or to the fire, till thawed, makes it impossible for any heat to dress them properly aftci'wai'ds.

MISCUILANEOUS OHSEUVATIONS. XXV causes, are not at present favourable to the future conduct of women. It frequently happens, that before impressions of duty are made on the mind- ornamental education commences ; and it ever after takes the lead : thus, what should be only the embellishment, becomes the main business of life. There is no opportunity of attaining a know- ledge of family management at school; and, dur- ing vacation, all subjects that might interfere with amusement are avoided. When a girl, whose family moves in the higher ranks of life, returns to reside at her father’s house after completing her education, her introduction to the gay world, and a continued course of plea- sures, persuade her at once that she was born to be the ornament of fashionable circles rather than to ttoop (as she would conceive it) to undertake tlie arrangement of a family, though by that means she might in various ways augment the satisfaction and comfort of her parents. On the other hand, persons of an inferior sphere, and especially in the lower order of middling life, are almost always- anxious to give their children such advantages ot education as themselves did not possess. Whe- ther their indulgence be productive of the hapj)i- ness so kindly aimed at, must be judged by tho effects, whicli are not very favourable, if what has been taught has not produced humility in herself, and increased gratitude and respect to the authors of her being. Were a young woman brought to relish home society, and the calm delights of agree- able occupation, before she entered into the delu- sive scenes of pleasure, presented by the theatre and other dissipations, it is probable.she would soon make a comparison much in favour of the foi’mcr, especially if restraint did not give to the latter ad- diiiojial relish.

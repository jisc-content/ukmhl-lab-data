MEiT. PART II. JIEATS. To choose Meats. FfWMOJi.—If the fat be clear, bright, and thick, and the cleft part smooth and close, it is young ; but If the cleft IS wide and tough, it is old. To judge of Its sweetness, run a very sharp narrow knife into the Moulder or haunch, and you will know by the scent, h ew people hke it, when it has much of the haiit gout. If the flesh of ox-beef is young, it will have a fine smooth open grain, be of a good red, and look tender. The fat should look white rather than yel- low ; for when that is of a deep colour, the meat is seldom good : beef fed by oil-cakes is in general so, and the flesh is flabby. The grain of cow-beef is closer, and the fat whiter, than that of ox-beef ; but the lean 13 not of so bright a red. The grain of bull-beef is closer still, the fat hard and skinny, the lean of a deep red, and a stronger scent. Ox-beef is the reverse. Ox-beef is the richest and largest, but in small fami- lies, and to some tastes, heifer-beef is better, if finely fed. In old meat there is a streak of horn in the ribs of beef: the harder this is, the older ; and the flesh is not finely flavonred. Veal.— Ihe flesh of a bull-calf is firmest, but not so white.

The other parts should be dry and white ; if

HEAT. 53 put a bit of butter into the pan ; brown it, then pour some boiling water into it, and boil quick: sea> son with pepper, salt, and ketchup, ana pour over them. Other way$.—Prepare as before, and dress the cutlets in a Dutch-oven ; pour over them melted but- ter and mushrooms. Or pepper, salt, and broil them ; especially neck- steaks. They are excellent without herbs. Veal Collops. Cut long thin collops ; beat them well ; and lay on them a bit of thin bacon of the same size, and spread forcemeat on that, seasoned high, and also a little gar- lick and Cayenne. Roll them up tight, about the size of two lingers, but not more than two or three inches long ; put a very small skewer to fasten each firmly ; rub egg over ; fry them of a fine brown, and pour a rich brown gravy over. To dre'si Collops quick. Cut them as thin as paper with a very sharp knife, and in small bits. Throw the skin, and any odd bits of the veal, into a little water, with a dust of pepper and salt ; set them on the fire wliile you beat the col- lops ; and dip them into a seasoning of herbs, bread, pepper, salt, and a scrape of nutmeg, but first wet them in egg. Then put a bit of butter iuto a frying- pan, and give the collops a very quick fry ; for as they are so thin, two minutes will do them on both sides: put them into a hot dish before the fire ; then strain and thicken the gravy, give it a boil in the fr)- ing-pan, and pour it over the collops. A httle ketchup is an improvement. A nother way.—Fry them in butter, only seasoned with salt and pepper ; then simmer them in gravy, either white or brown, with bits of bacon served with them. If white, add lemon-peel and mace, and some cream.

I2S SAUCES. Shrimp Sauce, If the shrimps are not picked at home, pour a lit- tle water over them to wash them : put them to but- ter melted thick and smooth, give them one boil, and add the juice of a lemon. Anchovy Sauce. Chop one or two anchovies without washing, put them to some flour and butter, and a little drop of water ; stir it over the fire till it boils once or twice. When the anchovies are good they will be dissolved ; and the colour will be better than by the usual way. To melt Butter, tchich is rarely xcell done, though a venj essential article. Mix in the proportion of a tea-spoonful of flour to four ounces of the best butter, on a trencher. Put it into a small saucepan, and two or three table-spoon- fuls of hot water, boil quick a minute, shaking it all the time. Milk used instead of water requires rather le.ss butter, and looks whiter. Vingaret, for cold Foxcl, or Meat. Chop mint, parsley, and shalot, mix with salt, oil, and vinegar. Serve in a boat. Shalot Vinegar. Split six or eight shalots ; put them into a quart bottle, and fill it up with vinegar, stop it, and in a month it will be fit for use. Camp Vinegar. Slice a large head of garlick ; and put it into a wide- mouthed bottle, with half an ounce of Cayenne, two tea-spoonsful of real soy, two of walnut ketchup, four anchovies chopped, a pint of vinegar, and enough cochineal to give it the colour of lavender-drops. Let it stand six weeks ; then strain off quite cloar, and keep in small bottles sealed up. 70 K

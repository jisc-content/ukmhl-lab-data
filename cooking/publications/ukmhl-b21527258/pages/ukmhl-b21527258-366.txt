1 31)4 DOMESTIC COOKKRY. Gloucester Jelly. Take rice, sago, pearl barley, hartshorn shanngs, and eriiigo-root, each ah ounce ; simmer with three jhnts of water to one, and strain it. When cold it will be a jelly ; of which give, dissolved in wine, milk, or broth, in change with other nourishment. Panada, made in five Minutes. Set a little water on the fire with a glass of white wine, some sugar, and a scrape of nutmeg and lemon- peel ; meanwhile grate some crumbs of bread. The moment the mixture boils up, keeping it still on the fire, put the crumbs in, and let it boil as fast as it can. When of a proper thickness just to drink, take it off. Another.—Make as above, but instead of a glass of wine, put in a tea-spoonful of rum, and a bit of butter ; sugar as above. This is a most pleasant mess. Another.—Put to the water a bit of lemon-peel, mix the crumbs in, and when nearly boiled enough, put some lemon or orange syrup. Observe to boil all the ingredients ; for if any be added after, the panada will break, and not jelly. Chicken Panada, Boil it till about three parts ready, in a quart of water, take off the skin, cut the white meat off when cold, and put into a marble mortar ; pound it to a paste with a little of the water it was boiled in, season with a little salt, a grate of nutmeg, and the least bit of lemon-peel. Boil gently for a few minutes to the consistency you like ; it should be such as you cun drink, though tolerably thick. This conveys great nourishment in small compass. Sippets, when the Stomach will not receive Meat, On an extremely hot plate put two or three sippets of liread, and pour over them some gravy from beef, mutton, or veal, if there is no butter in the disli. Sprinkle a little salt over.

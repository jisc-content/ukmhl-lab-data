General Directions respecting Gravies. Gravy may be made quite as good of the skirts of beef, and the kidney, as of any other meat, prepared in the same way. An ox-kidney, or milt, makes good gravy, cut all to pieces, and prepared as other meat ; and so will the shank end of mutton that has been dressed, if much be not wanted. t The shank-bones of mutton are a great improvement to the richness of gravy ; but first soak them well, and scour them clean. Parragon gives the flavour of French cookery, and in high gravies is a great improvement ; but it should be added only a short time before serving. To draw Gravy that will keep a week. Cut lean beef thin, put it into a frying-pan without any butter, and set it on a fire covered, but take care it does not bum: let it stay till all the gravy tliat comes out of the meat is dried up into it again ; put as much water as will cover the meat, and let that stew away. Then put to the meat a small quantity of water, herbs, onions, spice, and a bit of lean ham ; simmer till it is rich, and keep it in a cool place. Don’t take cff the fat till going to be used.

SaVOUUV I'lES. 143 soned with hurbs, onion, mace, and white pepper. If it is to be eaten hot, you may add truffles, morels, mushroms, &c., but not if to be eaten cold. If it is made in a dish, put as much gravy as will fill it; but in raised crust the gravy must be nicely strained, and then put in cold as jelly. To make the jelly clear, you may give it a boil with the whites of two eggs, after taking away the meat, and then run it through a fine lawn sieve. Itab'hits, if young and in flesh, do as well: their legs should be cut short, and the breast hones must not go in, but will help to make the gravy. Often-Goose Pie. Bone two young green geese, of a good size, but first take away every plug, and singe them nicely. Wash them clean ; and season them hiirh with salt, pepper, mace, and allspice. Put one inside the other; and press them as close as yon can, drawing the lego inwards. Put a good deal of butter over them, and bake them either with or without crust ; if the latter, a cover to the dish must fit close to keep in the steam. It will keep long. Duck Pie. Bone a full-grown young duck and fowl ; wash them, and season with pepper and salt, and a small proportion of mace and allspice, in the finest powder. Put the fowl within the duck, and in the former a calfs tongue pickled red, boiled very tender and peeled. Press the whole close ; the skins of the legs should be drawn inwards that the body of the fowls may be quite smooth. If approved, the space between the sides of the crust may be filled with a fine forcemeat, made according to the receipt given for making forcemeat in page 134. Bake it in a slow oven, either in raised crust or pie-dish, with a thick crust, ornamented. The large pies in Staffordshire are made as above,

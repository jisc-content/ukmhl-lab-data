8A.V0URY PIES. 14.5 Ilare pie to eat cold. Seaflon the hare after it is cut up ; and bake_ it, witlt eggs and forcemeat, in a raised crust or dish. When it is to be served, cut oS the lid, and cover it with jelly-gravy, as in page 120. A French Pie. Lay a puff paste round on the ledge of the dish ; and put in either veal in slices, rabbits or chickens jointed: with forcemeat balls, sweetbreads cut in pieces, artichoke-bottoms, and a few truffles. Vegetable Pie. Scald and blanch some broad beans: cut young car- rots, turnips, artichoke-bottoms, mushrooms, peas, onions, lettuce, parsley, or any of them you have ; make the whole into a nice stew with some good veal gravy. Bake a crust over a dish, with a little lining round the edge, and a cup turned up to keep it from sinking. When baked, open the lid and pour in the stew. Parsley Pie. Lay a fowl or a few bones of the scrag of veal, seasoned, into a dish ; scald a colander-full of picked parsley,in milk ; season ; and add to it the fowl or meat, with a tea-cupful of any sort of good broth, or weak gravy. When it is baked, pour it into a quarter of a pint of cream scalded, with the size of a walnut of butter, and a little flour. Shake it round to mix with the gravy already in. Lettuces, white mustard leaves, or spinach, may be added to the parsley, and scalded before put in. Turnip Pie. Season mutton chops with salt and pepper, re> serving the ends of the neck bones to lay over the turnips, which must be cut into small dice, and put on the steaks. 7U I.

DOMESTIC COOKERY. 2 Herrings.—If good, their gills are of a fine red sn;j the eyes bright; as is likewise the whole fish, which inust he stiff and firm. Soles.—If good they are thick, and the belly is of a cream colour; if this is,of a bluish cast and flabby they are not fresh. They are in the market almost the whole year, but are in the highest perfection about Midsummer. Whitings.—Tlie firmness of the body and fins is to be looked to, as in herrings ; their high season is dur- ing the first three months of the year, but they may be had a great part of it. Mackerel.—Choose as whitings. Their season is May, June, and July. They are S'j tender a fish that they carry and keep worse than any other. Pike.—For freshness observe the above marks. The best are taken in rivers : they are a very dry fish, and are much indebted to stufifing and sauce. Carp live some time out of water, and may there- fore get wasted ; it is best to kill them as soon as caught, to prevent this. The same signs of freshness attend them as other fish. Tench.—They are a fine-flavoured fresh-water fish, and should be killed and dressed as soon as caught.— When they are to be bought, examine whctlier the gills are red and hard to open, the eyes bright, and the body stiff. The tench has a slimy matter about it, the clearness and brightness of which shew fresh- ness. The season is July, August, and September. Perch.—Take the general rules given to distinguish the fresliness of other fish. They are not so delicate as carp and tench. Smelts, if good, have a fine silvery hue, are very firm, and have a refreshing smell like cucumbers newly cut.—^They are c;inght in the Thames and some other large rivers. Mullets.—The sea are preferred to the river mui- lets, and the red to the grey. Tlrey should be very firm.—Tlieir season is August.

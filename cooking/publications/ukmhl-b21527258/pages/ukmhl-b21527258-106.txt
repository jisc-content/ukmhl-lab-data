Roast it on a hanging spit; and baste it with a glass of port wine, the same quantity of vine- gar, and a tea-spoonful of pounded allspice. _ Larding it improves the look and flavour ; serve with a rich gravy in the dish ; currant-jelly and melted batter, in tureens. To roast Tongue and Udder. After cleaning the tongue well, salt it with common salt and salt-petre three days ; then boil it, and like- wise a fine young udder with some fat to it, till toler- ably tender ; then tie the thick part of one to the thin part of the other, and roast the tongue and udder together. Serve them with good grav7, and currant-jelly sauce. A few cloves should be stuck in the udder. This is an excellent dish. _ Some people like neatsâ€™ tongues cured with the root, in which case they look much larger ; but other- wise the root must be cut off close to the gullet, next to the tongue, but without taking away the fat under the tongue. Tlie root must be soaked in salt and water, and extremely well cleaned before it is dressed; and the tongue should be laid in salt for a day and a night before pickled. To pickle Tongues for boiling. Cut off the root, but leave a little of the kernel and fat. Sprinkle some salt, and let it drain from the slime till next day: then for each tongue mix a large spoonful of common salt, the same of coarse sugar, and about half-as-much of saltpetre ; rub it well in, and do so every day. In a week add another heaped spoonful of salt. If rubbed every day, a tongue will be ready in a fortnight ; but if only turned in the pickle daily, it will keep four or five weeks without being too salt. When you dry tongues write the date on a parch- ment and tie it on. Smoke them, or dry them plain, if YOU like best.

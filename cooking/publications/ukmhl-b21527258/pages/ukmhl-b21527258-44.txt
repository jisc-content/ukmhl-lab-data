XXXvi MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS. ttiid, to avoid mistakes, let the goods be compared with these when brouglit home. Though it is very disagreeable to suspect any one’s honesty, and perhaps mistakes have been un- intentional ; yet it is prudent to weigh meat, sugai’s, &c. when brought in, and compare with the charge. The butcher should be ordered to send the weight with the meat, and the cook to file these checks, to be examined when the weekly bill shall be delivered. Much trouble and irregularity are saved when there is company, if servants are required to pre- pare the table and sideboard in similar order daily. All things likely to be wanted should be in readi- ness ; sugars of different qualities kept broken, currants washed, picked, and perfectly dry; spices pounded, and kept in very small bottles closely corked ; not more than will be used in four or five weeks should be pounded at a time. Much less is necessary than when boiled whole in gravies, &c. Where noonings or suppers are served, (and in every house some preparation is necessary for ac- cidental visitors,) care should be taken to have such things in readiness as are proper for either; a list of several will be subjoined, a change of which may be agreeable, and, if duly managed, will be attended with little expense and much convenience. A ticket should be exchanged by the cook for every loaf of bread, which, when returned, will shew the number to be paid for; as tallies may be altered,, unless one is kept by each party. Those who are served with brewer’s beer, or any other articles not paid for weekly or on delivery, should keep a book for entering the dates; which will not only serve to prevent overcharges, but will. shew the whole year’s consumption at one view.

DOMESTIC COOKERT. 48 four days in hot weather. Take care to cut out the pipe thit runs along the chine of a lorn do of beef, to hinder it from tainting, ^e skirt of the breast of veal is likewise to be taken off, inside of the breast wiped and scraped, and sprinkled with a little salt. Leg of Veal, Let the fillet be cut large or small as best suits the number of your company. Take out the bone, nil the space with a fine stuffing, and let it be skewered quite round ; and send the large side uppermost. tV hen nalf-roasted, if not before, put a paper over the fat; and Uke care to allow a sufficient time, and put it a Eood distance from the fire, as the meat is very solid. Beive with melted butter poured over it.â€”You may pot some of it. Knuckle of Veal. As few people are fond of boiled veal, it may be well to leave the knuckle small, and take off some cutlets or collops before it be dressed ; but as the knuckle will keep longer than the fillet, it is best not to cut on the slices till wanted. Break the bones, to make it take less room: wash it well; and put it into a sauce- pan with three onions, a blade of mace or two, and a few pepper-corns ; cover it Muth water, and simmer till quite ready. In the meantime some macaroni should be boiled with it if approved, or rice, or a little rice- flour, to give it a small degree of thickness ; but don t put too much. Before it is served, add half-a-pint of milk and cream, and let it come up either with or without the meat. Or fry the knuckle with sliced onions and butter to a good brown ; and have ready peas, lettuces, onion, and a cucumber or two, stewed in a small quantity of water an hour; then add these to the veal; and stew it till the meat is tender enough to eat, but not over- done. Throw in pepper, salt, and a bit of shred mint, and serve all together.

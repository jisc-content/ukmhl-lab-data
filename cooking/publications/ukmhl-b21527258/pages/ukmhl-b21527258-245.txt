Take the lemon-peel ont with a ladle, and throw a handful of flour into the preparation while boiling; take care, however, not to put more flour than the liquor can soak up. Stir with a Avooden spoon till the paste can easily be detached from the stew-pan, and then take it off the lire. Ne.Kt break an egg into this paste, and mix it well ; then break a second, which also mix ; do not put more eggs than tlie paste can absorb, but you must be careful not to make this preparation too liquid. It is almost certain, that about five or six eggs will be wanted for tlie above quantity ; then form them en choux, by which is meant, in the shape of a ball an inch in circumference. As this paste swells very much, you must dress it accordingly, putting the choux on a baking sheet, at an inch distant from each other, in order that they may undergo a greater effect in the oven. Brush them over as usual with the dorure or egg wash, to wliich has been added a little milk. Put them into an oven moderately hot, but do not open the oven till they are quite baked, otherwise they would flatten, and all attempts to make them rise again would be useless: next dry them. Somtimes you may glaze them ; at other times you may send them up without being glazed. To detach them from the baking sheet, apply the sharp edge of your knife, and take them off gently. Then make a small opening on the side, into which put, with a tea-spoon such sweetmeats as you think proper, and send them up dished en buisson. N. B.—Be cautious to smell every egg, before you use it, for a bad one would spoil the whole. *„* This elegant receipt is extracted from “The French Cook,” by Mr. Ud»-

domestic COOli-ERY. 2G cUmmy or spotted, the meat is stale and kidney turns first in the loin, and the suet will not Afjt«o«!^Choosc this by the fineness of its pain, good colour, and firm white fat. It is not the better for being young; if of a good brpd and well fed^ is better for age ; but this only holds Ypvtn^e mutton: the flesh of the ewe is paler, and the textpe finer. Eam-inutton is very strong-flavoured ; tne flesh is of a deep red, and the fat is spongy. Observe the neck of a fore-quarter ; if the vein is bluish, it is fresh ; if it has a green or yellov? east, it is stale. In the hind quarter, if there is a faint smell under the kidney, and the knuckle is limp, the meat is stale. If the eyes are sunk, the he^ is not fresh.

Po7-;i._Pinch the lean, and if young, it wll break. I f the rind is tough, thick, and cannot easily be im- pressed by the finger, it is old. A thin rind is a merit in all pork. When fresh, the flesh will be smooth and cool ; if clammy, it is tainted. What w called measley pork is very unwholesome ; and may be known by the fat being full of kernels, which in good pork is never the case. Pork fed at still-houses does not answer for curing any way, the fat being spongy. Dairy-fed pork is the best. Hacon.—If the rind is thin, the fat firm and of a red tinge, the lean tender, of a good colour, and ad- hering to the bone, you may conclude it good and not old. If there are yellow streaks in it, it is going if not already rusty. jf/aTiw.—Stick a sharp knife under the bone ; int comes out with a pleasant smell the ham is good ; but if the knife is daubed and has a bad scent, do not buy it, Ham.s short in the hock are best, and long- legged pigs are not to be clicseu for any preparation ol pork.

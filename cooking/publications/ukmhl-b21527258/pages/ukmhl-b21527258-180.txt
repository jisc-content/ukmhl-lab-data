DOMESTIC COOKERY. 118 Clear Oravy. Slice beef thin ; broil a part of it over a very clear quick fire, just enough to give colour to the gravy, but not to dress it: put that and the raw into a very nicely tinned stew-pan, with two onions, a clove or two, whole black peppers, berries of allspice, and a bunch of sweet herbs: cover it with hot water, give it one boil, and skim it well two or three times ; then cover it, and simmer till quite strong. Cullis, or brown Oravy. Lay over the bottom of a stew-pan as much lean veal as will cover it an inch thick; then cover the vetiJ with thin slices of undressed gammon, two or three onions, two or three bay-leaves, some sweet herbs, two blades of mace, and three cloves. Cover the stew-pan, and set it over a slow fire ; but when the juices come out, let the fire be a little quicker. When the meat is of a fine brown, fill the pan with good beef broth, boil and skim it, then simmer an hour ; add a little water, mixed with as much fiour as will make it properly thick: boil it lialf an hour, and strain it. This will keep a week. Bechamel, or ichite Sauce. Cut lean veal into small shces, and the same quantity of lean bacon or ham ; put them into a stew-pan with a good piece of butter, an onion, a blade of mace, a few mushroom-buttons, a bit of thyme, and a bay-leaf ; fry the whole over a very slow fire, but not to brown it ; thicken it with flour ; then put an equal quantity of good broth, and rich cream ; let it boil half an hour, and stir it all the time ; strain it through a soup- strainer. A Gravy, without Meat. Put a glass of small beer, a glass of water, some pep- per, salt, lemon-peel grated, a bruised clove or two, and a spoonful of walnut-pickle, or mushroom-ket- chup, into a basin. liUce an onion, flour and fry it

Strain cheese curd from the whey, and beat half a pint basin of it fine in a mortar, with a spoonful and a half of flour, three eggs, but only one white, a spoonful of orange-flower water, a quarter of a nutmeg, and sugar to make it pretty sweet.

Take the bones out, then season and beat the meat, lay it into a stone jar in large pieces, pour upon it some plain drawn-beef gravy, but not a strong one, lay the bones on the top, then set the jar in a water- bath, that is a sauce-pan of water over the fire, sim- mer three or four hours—then leave it in a cold place till next day. Remove the cake of fat, lay the meat in handsome pieces on the dish ; if not suCficiently seasoned, add more pepper, salt, or pimento as necessary. Put some of the gravy, and keep the remainder for the time of serving. If the venison be thus prepared, it will not require so much time to b.ake, or such a very thick crust as is usual, and by which the under part is seldom done through.

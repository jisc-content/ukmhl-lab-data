PREFACE. IV In drawing up the recipes, and the introductions to them, the compiler has endeavoured to combine clearness with ful- ness and accuracy. She has relied, in the first place, on her own personal experience; but she has taken care, also, to avail herself of the experience of many competent cooks, for whose valuable aid she begs to express her thanks. She has also to record her indebtedness to authorities on cooking for many suggestions embodied by her in the following pages. In order to facilitate reference to particular dishes, a com- prehensive index has been supplied, and will, it is hoped, be found useful. C. D.

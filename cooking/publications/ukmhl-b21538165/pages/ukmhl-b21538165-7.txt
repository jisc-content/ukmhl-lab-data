PREFACE. This volume has been compiled mainly for housewives of moderate means. Care, therefore, has been taken to include in it few recipes which cannot be carried out at a reasonable cost. An effort has been made, too, to exclude, except in rare instances, recipes which are not of absolute and definite utility. Variety has been aimed at, and, it is hoped, attained, but dishes of a purely fanciful character have seldom been inserted. The object of the compiler has been rather to produce a book which should be constantly of use to the mistresses of ordinary households—a book which, they should be able to consult at all times with advantage. Opening with an introduction in which is embodied much information on such subjects as cooking utensils, the times at which certain food is in season, and so forth, the book goes on to deal in succession with soups, sauces, fish, meat, poultry, game, vegetables, sweets, forcemeats, eggs, cheese, etc. A section is devoted to the modes of ‘ using up 5 meat, and another contains full directions for preparing food for invalids. In the miscellaneous section will be found a large variety of extra recipes, whilst in the Appendix are included a number of hints on household subjects*

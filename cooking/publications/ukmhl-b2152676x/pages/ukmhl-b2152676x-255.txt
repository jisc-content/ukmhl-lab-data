OBESITY. ITS CUBE. 233 Tliere is no doubt a continual use of acids will make a person tbin ; but it destroys their fresh- ness, their health, their life; even lemonade, which is the mildest of them, will gradually do harm. This truth cannot be made too public ; many readers could give me examples to support it. I will only give one case which came under my own personal observation. In 1776 I Hved at Dijon; I was studying lawj chemistry, and medicine. I had a Platonic friendship for one of the most charming persons I have ever met. Louise was a lovely girl, and had that classical embonpoint which charms the eye and is the glory of sculptors. Though only a friend, I was not blind to her attractions, and this is perhaps why I observed her so closely. “ Chère amie,” I said to her one evening, “you are not well; you seem to be thinner.” “ Oh ! no,” she said, with a smile which partook of melancholy, “ I am very well ; and if I am a little thinner I can very well afford it.” “ Afford it !” I said, ■with warmth ; “ you can afford neither to gain nor lose ; remain beautiful as you are,” and other phrases pardonable to a young man of twenty.

140 HANDBOOK OF DINING. CHAP. X. LA GOURMANDISE. We have no equivalent in the English language for the word “ gourmandise ” or “ gourmand.” “ Epicurism” and epicure are perhaps the nearest approach. It is curious that Savarin throughout his work makes use of the expression “ gourmand” to denote a refined eater. The French language possesses another definition, which Eoget would do well to insert into the next edition of his “ Thesaurus,'’’ viz. Gourmet* Our English idea of a ‘‘gourmand” is a man who has a voracious appetite, likes good things, and swallows them wholesale; in fact—a glutton. Savarin’s “gourmand” is the “man of taste” as defined in Aphorism II. : “ Animals feed ; man eats ; it is only the man of intellect who knows hoiv to eat.” * I allude to the sixth edition of this vfiluablc work; perhaps it may be in a later one.

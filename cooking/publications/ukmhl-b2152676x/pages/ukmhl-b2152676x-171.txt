A GOüEilANDE. 149 to me : I began to fear I had compromised myself; during the two first courses the young lady was abstemious to a d'egi’ee. This discretion astonished me, and I feared I had stumbled upon an excep- tional case, for “ nulla régula sine exceptione. But a magnificent dessert was served up, and this revived my hope. I was not deceived : not only did she eat of everything offered to her, but asked for dishes farthest off from her. She tasted everything; my neighbour was astonished where she could put so much. My diagnostic was veri- fied, and once again science triumphed. Two years afterwards, I met the same person ; she had been recently married; she had grown' up into a beautiful woman; slightly coquettish, she displayed all her chai-ms to the best advan- tage. She was ravissante. Her husband was a picture. He looked like that celebrated ventri- loquist, who could laugh on one side of his face and cry on the other. He appeared much pleased hat his wife was so much admired, but as soon as e thought an admirer was too warm in his atten- tions, a cold shiver of jealousy visibly pervaded us frame. The last sentiment prevailed. He hurried off his wife under his arm, and I never saw them again.

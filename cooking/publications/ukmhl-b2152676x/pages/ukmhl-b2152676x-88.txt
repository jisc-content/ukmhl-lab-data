HANDBOOK OP DINING. 66 “ Ye Eoman financiers, who extorted from the whole known universe, never did your famed salons behold those succulent jellies, nor those varied ices, the cold of which equals that of the arctic zone. Oh ! how I pity you ! “ Invincible paladins, celebrated by troubadours, after slaying giants, delivering fair damsels, exterminating armies, never, alas ! never did a black-eyed captive present you with a bottle of Champagne mousseux. Malvoisie, or Madeira, or liqueurs, creations of the ‘ great centuiy.’ You were reduced to cherry- brandy, or a cider-cup. Oh ! how I pity you ! “ Ye croziered and mitred abbots, dispensers of the favours of Heaven ; and ye terrible Templars, who donned ai-mour for the extermination of the Saracen, you knew not of the restoring powers of chocolate, or of the Arabian berry which engenders dreams. Oh ! how I pity you ! “ Ye superb mother abbesses, who, during the void caused by the Crusades, elevated to supreme rank your almoners and your pages, you did not share with them the charms of biscuits, nor the delight of jnacaroons. Oh ! how I pity you ! “And you, finally, gastronomers of 1825, who find already satiety in the midst of abundance and dream of new concoc- tions, ye will not be able to enjoy the discoveries which science is preparing for the year 1900, such as the extractions from minerals, liqueurs resulting from the pressure of a hundred at- mospheres ; you will never behold the importiitions which still unborn future travellers will bring home from that por.ion of the globe still to be discovered or explored. Oh ! how I pity you ! ”]

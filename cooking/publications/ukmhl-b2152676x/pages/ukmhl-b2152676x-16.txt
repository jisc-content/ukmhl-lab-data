PREFACE. XIV studied those various branches in my youth, from a very praiseworthy desire of being able to con- verse with the various men I might meet in society, and not be behind my century. I often entertained a doubt my book might be tedious, and make other men yawn as I often have yawned over other men’s books. I have done all in my power not to deserve’ such a re- proach. I have passed lightly over tedious sub- jects; the anecdotes related are in many instances personal ; I have left untouched a number of ex- traordinary and singular facts which soimd criti- cism rejects ; I have awakened attention by making clear and popular certain facts which savans seemed inclined to reserve to themselves. If, despite these efforts, I have served up an indiges- tible banquet, I shall not sleep the less sound with the conscience of having earned the appro- bation of the majority. I do not, however, wish to be thought a Com- piler ; had I been reduced so low, my pen should not have been taken up, and I should not have lived less happily on that account. I said with Juvenal : “ Semper ego auditor tantum ! nunquamne reponam."

Before eight A.M., when in bed, take a basin of soup (potage au pain or aux pâtes), not too much, or, if you prefer it, a cup of good chocolate. Breakfast at eleven. Fresh eggs, boiled or poached, petits pâtés, cutlets, or anything else ; but eggs are essential. A cup of coffee will not hurt. After breakfast take a little exercise. Gro shop- ping, or call on a friend, sit and chat, and walk home again. At dinner, eat as much soup, meat, and fish as you like, but do not omit to eat the rice with the fowl, macaroni, sweet pastry, creams, &c. At dessert, savoy biscuits, babas, and other fari- naceous preparations which contain eggs and sugar. This diet may seem limited, but it is capable of great variation, and comjDrises the whole animal kingdom. Drink beer by preference ; otherwise Bordeaux, or wine from the South of France.

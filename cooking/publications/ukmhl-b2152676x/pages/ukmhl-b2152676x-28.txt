6 HANDBOOK OF DINING. VI. Grood living is an act of our judgment, by which we give a preference to things agi'eeable to taste, to those which do not possess that quality. VII. The pleasuiâ€™es of the table are for all ages, all conditions, all countries, and of. great variety ; they are the concomitants of all other pleasures, and when all the rest are gone, they remain to console us for their loss. VIII. The dinner-table is the only place where men are not bored during the first hour. IX. The discovery of a new dish does more for the happiness of mankind, than the discovery of a new planet. X. Men who eat hastily or get drunk do not know how to eat or drink.

222 HANDBOOK OF DINING. army often fall asleep, even though they throw sniiflf into their eyes. Pichegru, when tracked by the police of Bonaparte, gave 30,000 francs for a night’s sleep, and that very night he was betrayed and given up. Like all other pleasures, sleep may be carried to an extreme. Men have been known to have slept away three quarters of their life ; the effects in such case are baneful : — idleness, indolence, weakness, stupidity, and death. The school of Salerno allowed seven hours’ sleep to all ages and sexes. That doctrine is too severe; children and women require more ; but more than ten hours in bed is always an excess. And what does the mind do during this lapse ? It lives in itself; it is like a pilot in a calm, as a mirror in the night, a lute, the strings of which vibrate not to a touch ; it awaits fresh excitement. There are, however, some psychologists, amongst others Count de Eedern, who maintain that the mind never ceases to act, and the latter supports his opinion on the ground that every man aroused from his first sleep experiences the sensation of one disturbed in some serious occupation. There is some truth in the observation, which is worth investigation.

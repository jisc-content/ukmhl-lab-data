28 HANDBOOK OF DINING. is the companion and the consoler. All the good cooks were massacred in the kitchens of their nohle masters. Some fled sooner than serve men who could not appreciate their dishes. Some offered their services, but finding that these brutes had no palate for good cheer, died of grief or committed suicide. Huge roasts of beef and venison, buckets of strong drink, were quaffed by the new comers, and as every man bore weapons, blood was often shed at their banquets. However, the very nature of things could not allow this to last. The victors became acquainted with the vanquished and ceased to be cruel ; they gradually became more civilised and learnt to eat like gentlemen. Their dinners became more res- pectable. Men were asked not to stuff themselves but to enjoy their food ; the guests discovered that the host took some pains to entertain them ; they felt a pleasant contentment, and their better feelings expanded. This improvement took place about the fifth century of our era, but a more marked improve- ment took place under Charlemagne : and history informs us that that great monarch took a personal interest that his domains should be well stored with game best suited to the table.

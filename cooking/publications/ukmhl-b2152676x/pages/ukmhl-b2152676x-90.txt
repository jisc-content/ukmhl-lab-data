In the course of the last sixty years, various new sciences have taken a place in the system of our knowledge, as stereotomy, descriptive geome- try, electricity, and the chemistry of gas. All these sciences, cultivated for an infinity of generations, will make still more certain progress, since the art of printing will prevent them from heino- lost. And who knows, for instance, whether the chemistry of gas may not some day succeed in dompting those elements hitherto so rebellious, of mixing them, combining them in proportions hitherto unattempted, of obtaining by such means substances and effects which would extend beyond measure the limits of our powers ?

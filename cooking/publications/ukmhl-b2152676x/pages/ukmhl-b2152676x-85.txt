63 TASTE MOEALLY CONSIDERED. gi-eat gourmand of nature, and not be astonished if Grail, like Homer, sometimes “sleeps.” Hitherto we have examined taste only in the light of its physical constitution, and we have kept to the level of science. But our task does not end here, for it is especially in the moral his- tory of this repairing sense that its importance and its glory ought to be sought. We have therefore arranged, according to ana- lytical order, the theories and facts which consti- tute this history, that instruction may result without fatigue. Thus in the chapters which follow, we shall endeavom- to show how sensations from repetition and reflection have perfected the organ, and extended the sphere of its powers; how the want of eating, at flrst only an instinct, became a passion of influence which has assumed a marked ascendency over everything else connected with society. e will also point out how all branches of science, which have reference to the composition of substances, act in concert to place apart those which are appreciable to taste, and how travellers have worked towards the same end by submitting to our examination substances which nature seem- ingly never meant to bring together.

TRANSLATOR’S PREFACE. There was commotion in Olympus in January, 1859. Venus, Minerva, and Juno whispered together so long that at last the attention of Jupiter was attracted. “ VTiat is the matter ? ” exclaimed the father of gods and men. “ Poor little Grasterea is in a great way,” said Venus eagerly, “ and wishes to he admitted to an audience ; Juno says she has no business here, as in her circle she gives nothing but nectar and ambrosia, and I cannot convince her that Gasterea has no intention of reforming our repasts,” Now, be it known, Venus and Gasterea have a secret treaty between them, — offensive and de- fensive, — in case a third power, called “ Ennui,” should encroach upon the territory of either. Thus, Gasterea has always a voice at the Imperial Court.

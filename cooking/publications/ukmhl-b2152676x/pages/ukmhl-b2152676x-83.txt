61 THE HUMAN TONGUE. thing eatable becomes a prey to his vast appetite : which at once implies digestive powers proportion- ate to the general use he puts them to. In fact, the machinery of taste in man is of rare perfection, and to be convinced of the fact let us see it act. As soon as an esculent substance is introduced into the mouth it is confiscated, gas and juices, irretrievably. The lips prevent its leaving; the teeth seize upon it and crush it ; the saliva absorbs it ; the tongue bruises it and turns it round; the breath forces it towards the gullet; the tongue again rises to make it slip doAvn ; the sense of smell enjoys it as it glides past, and it is precipitated into the stomach to undergo ulterior transformations, with- out, during the whole of this operation, the slightest atom, particle, or drop being lost, which has not been submitted to the appreciatino- power. â€œ And a consequence of this perfection is that gourmandise is the exclusive apanage of man. Tliis gourmandise is even contagious ; and we transmit it promptly to the animals we have in our service, and which become, in a certain measure, our companions, as elephants, dogs, cats, and even parrots.

HANDBOOK OF DINING, 242 compares the life of man to an arch, that is to say, to an imperfect portion of a circle, which is continued throughout the night of the tomb to complete the circle. Now the young moon is such an arch, and the remainder of the circle is not visible.* He places two youths side l)y side, the one with a lighted torch, the other with his torch extinguished ; the former he compares to that portion of the moon which is light, and the latter with that part which is in darkness. “ Da zeigte sich mit umgestiirztem Lichte, An Kastor angelehnt, ein bliihend Pollux-Bild.” Ossian, speaking of a man at death’s door, says : — “ Death stood behind him like the dark side of the moon behind its silver horn.” Dr. Eicherand has described with so much truth and philosophy the last degi-adations of the hu- man body, and the last moments of the individual, that my readers will thank me for the following extract: - ♦ “ Der Schatten in des Mondes Angesichte.” “ The shadow in the Moon’s pale glimmer seen.”

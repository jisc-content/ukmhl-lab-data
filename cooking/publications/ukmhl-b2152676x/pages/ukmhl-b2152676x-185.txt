The peak on the west side was crowned by a forest of fir-trees, of which 37,000 were blown down by one storm. The valley itself consisted of pasture land and fields hedged in in the English style. We reached the monastery at daybreak, and were received by the bursar, a monk with a massive head and a nose like an obelisk. “ G-entlemen,” said the worthy father, “you are welcome; it will gladden the heart of our reve- rend abbot when he knows you have arrived : he is still in bed, being much fatigued from exertion yesterday; but come with me, and you will see that we expected you.” He led the way, and we followed him, guessing lightly he was taking us to the refectory. There all our senses were aroused at the sight of a most seductive breakfast, truly classic. In the centre of the large table rose a pasty as large as a church, flanked on one side by a cold quarter of veal, on the south by an enormous ham, on the east by a huge pile of butter, and on the west by a bushel of artichokes à la poivrade. Fruit of every description, plates, napkins, knives, and silver spoons and forks in baskets

38 HANDBOOK OP DINING. to the natural department of the art and to the customs and social usages connected therewith ; and although these two orders of things continually react upon each other, we think it as well to take each separately. Every trade connected with the sale or pre- paration of food, as cooks, traiteurs, pastry-cooks, confectioners, eating-houses, &c., has increased in an ever increasing ratio. And this proves that the demand is equal to the supply. Physics and chemistry have been called in to the aid of the alimentary art. The most learned men have not thought it beneath them to devote their attention to our primary wants, and have introduced improvements from the simple stew to the most recherche dishes which are only served up in gold or crystal. New branches of trade have arisen — biscuit bakers, for instance, who hold a middle path between pastry-cooks and confectioners. Theii’ domain comprises butter mixed with sugar and eggs, as biscuits, buns, meringues, &c. The art of preserving food has also become a distinct branch, the object of which is to offer us at every time of the year the various delicacies of every season.

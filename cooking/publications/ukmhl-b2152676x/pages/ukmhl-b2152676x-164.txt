142 HANDBOOK OF DINING. In tlie point of view of political economy, Â« gourmandise'' is the common link which unites nations by the reciprocal exchange of articles of daily use. It sends wines from pole to pole ; brandy, sugar, groceries, and provisions of every description, even to eggs and melons, are all at its command. It regulates the price of good and bad articles of food according to their respective merits. It keeps up the emulation of sportsmen, fishermen, and gardeners, whose labours adorn the tables of the rich. Finally, it gives employment to a host of cooks, pastry-cooks, confectioners, and others, beyond calculation. In the present state of society, it would be dif- ficult to imagine a people living exclusively on bread and vegetables. If such a nation existed, it would infallibly be subjugated by a carnivorous army, as the Hindoos have successively fallen a prey to all who attacked them, or else it would be converted by the cuisine* of its neighbours in like manner as the Boeotians became goumiands after the battle of Leuctra. * There is not an equivalent for the word cuisine in the English language.

151 DUKE DECnÈS papers of the memorable pugilistic encounter be- tween the minister and his cook. The battle was long disputed, and his Excellency had not always the best of it. Now, if after such an adventure, the cook was not dismissed (and he was not), I think I may draw the conclusion that the duke was absolutely dominated by the talents of that altiste, and that he despaired of finding another one who could flatter his taste so agreeably, otherwise he never could have overcome the very natural repugnance he must have felt at having so belli- cose a servant. As I was wi-iting the above lines, on «a fine winter s evening, M. Cartier, ex-premier violon of the opera, entered my room, and sat down by the fire. Being full of my subject, I looked at him with attention. “ My dear professor ! ” I exclaimed, “ how comes it you are not a gourmand ? You possess all the features of one.” “ I was once,” he replied, “ but I am obliged to abstain ; ” and he gave a deep sigh, almost a groan, worthy of one of Sir Walter Scott’s heroes. But if there are gourmands by predestination, there are gourmands by profession. I mil point out four great classes : financiers, doctors, literary men, and dévêts.

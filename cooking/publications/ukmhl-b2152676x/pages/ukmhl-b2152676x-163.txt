141 LA GOURMANDISE. Henceforth, then, gentle reader, remember that in these pages “gourmand^' and “gourmandise'^ imply the refinement of the “ Art of Dining.” Social “gourmandise" comhines the elegance of Athens mth the luxmy of Home and the re- finement of Pai-is. It implies intellect, taste, and judgment. It is a passionate preference which grows upon man for objects which flatter his taste. Gourmandise is tlie very reverse of gluttony; it is the enemy of every excess. A man who eats till he gets an indigestion, or who gets drunk, is immediately struck off the list of “ gourmands.” Gourmandise comprises refined taste for the most delicate dishes, even preserves and pastry. It admits women into its ranks. In whatever ight you look upon it, it is deserving of praise and encouragement. In a physical point of view it is the result and proof of a healthy and perfect state of the organs estined for nutrition. In a moral point of view It IS an implicit resignation to the behests of the Creator, who having ordained that we should eat 0 live invites us thereto by appetite, supports us fly taste, and rewards u^ by pleasure.

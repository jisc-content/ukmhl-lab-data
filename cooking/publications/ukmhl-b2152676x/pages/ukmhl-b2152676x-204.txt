182 HANDBOOK OF DINING. The pleasures of the table are peculiar to the human race. It premises preparation beforehand for the repast, the locality, and the selection of guests. The pleasure of eating requires, if not hunger, at least, appetite ; the pleasiH'es of the table are, generally, independent of both. Both states may always he observed at our banquets. At the first course men eat eagerly, vdthout speaking or paying attention to what may be said ; and, whatever may be our rank in society, we forget everything to set to work like the others. But when our cravings begin to feel satisfied, reflection steps in, conversation opens, a new order of things commences, and the man who up to this point was only an eater, becomes a more or less agreeable companion, according to the means given him by the master of all things. The pleasures of the table do not consist in transports of delight or ecstasies ; but they gain in duration what they lose in intensity, and have the peculiar privilege of disposing us to all others, or of consoling us for their loss. And, in sooth, after a good dinner, soul and body feel happy and comfortable.

FASTING. 239 the whole house was in mourning; they wept, they washed and embalmed the body, and it was buried with the honoiu'S due to the rank of the deceased. On these occasions men cared little for eating; they fasted without being aware of it. In like manner, in cases of great public cala- mities, in great droughts or incessant rains, cruel wars or dire pestilences, in a word, in the case of scourges against which toil and industry were of no avail, men gave themselves up to lamentations, and imputed the disasters to the anger of the gods ; they humiliated themselves before them, and mortified the flesh by fasting. The scourges ceased, and this was attributed to the offerings and fasting, and on future occasions they were again had recourse to. Thus men afflicted by public or private ca- lamities, gave themselves up to son-ow, and neg- lected to take food ; ultimately, they looked upon this voluntary abstinence as an act of religion. They thought that by macerating their body, when mind was in sorrow, they would move the pity of the gods, and this idea taken up by all nations, led to mourning, offerings, prayers, sacri- fices, mortifications, and abstinence.

HANDBOOK OP DINING. 46 dinner party, to point out the men who usually dine at a restaurateur’s. We said that the institution of restaurateui-s was of high importance to science. In fact, as soon as experience proved that a single well made ragoût sufficed to make the fortune of an inventor, interest, that powerful agent, fired the imagination, and shai’pened the wits of the pui-veyors. Analysis discovered esculent properties in sub- stances formerly discarded as useless; new articles of food were discovered ; ancient ones were im- proved, and both were combined in a variety of ways. Foreign inventions were imported ; the uni- verse was placed under contribution ; and we have seen dinners which might have provided the mate- rial for a whole course of alimentary geography. There are a few names deserving of historical mention as restaurateurs; Beauvilliers, INIeot, Robert, Rose, Legacque, Vérjq Henneveu, and Baleine. Some of them owe their reputation to peculiar dishes. The Frères Provençaux made a fortune on cod-fish with garlic * ; Véry was strong • This dish would scarcely have pleased Horace.

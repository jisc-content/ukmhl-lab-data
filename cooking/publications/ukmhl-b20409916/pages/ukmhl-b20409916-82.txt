70 DRESSED GAME AND the limbs and meat Let all boil slowly for half an hour, pass all through colander, and put gravy alone back in stewpan on the fire, and just when on the point of boiling put in the pieces of teal and take the stewpan off the fire ; add a little lemon juice, put the lid on, and leave it on the hob for half an hour. Stewed Teal. Truss the birds, putting aside the hearts, livers, and gizzards, and dredge them with flour, then place them in a saucepan with a piece of butter, and let them brown equally, taking care of the gravy w^hich oozes from them. Let them get cold, then carve them in such a way that the wings and legs can be taken off with a piece of breast adhering to it. Break the bodies of the birds into small pieces, and stew them with the livers, &c., in as much stock as will cover them, till the gravy becomes good and strong, then strain it, season with cay- enne, salt, a glassful of claret, and a little Seville orange juice. Directly it begins to boil, put in the fleshy portion of the birds and let simmer till they are thoroughly heated, but do not let the gravy boil. Cut slices of bread large enough for a leg and wing to lie upon, fry till lightly browned, ar- range them neatly, and pour sauce over them. Garnish with sliced lemon. Devilled Turkey Drumsticks. Score the drumsticks down parallel with the bone, and insert in the slices thus made a mixture made with one ounce of butter, a good teaspoonful of French mustard, a little cayenne, and a salt- spoonful of black pepper. Mix all this thoroughly

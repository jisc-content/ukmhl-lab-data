74 DRESSED GAME AND Fillets of Wild Ducks with Olives. Roast a couple of wild ducks and cut off the fillets in the usual way, score the skin, dish the fillets in a circle and put into the centre some stoned olives. Send clear brown gravy in a tureen with them. Wild Fowl with Bigarade Sauce. Roast a couple of wild fowl, cut off flesh from each side of the breast, and from sides under the wings. Score the skin, and dish the fillets in a circle with a little Bigarade sauce poured over them. Woodcock a la Chasseur. Truss a brace of cocks and put them down before a clear fire for fifteen minutes, then take them away and cut them into neat joints. Put the inferior pieces with three minced shalots, a bouquet garni, and half a head of garlic into a saucepan with a wineglassful of good gravy, another of wine, a tablespoonful of mushroom ketchup, and the strained juice of half a lemon, and let all simmer for ten minutes. Remove the gizzards from the trail, and pound them in a mortar with a piece of shalot, a little butter, pepper, and salt, and then rub through a sieve and spread them upon small pieces of fried bread cut into the shape of hearts. Put the joints of the woodcocks into a separate saucepan, strain the gravy on them, and let them heat gently ; they must not boil. Place them on a dish, put the fried bread with the trail round them, pour the gravy over all, and serve hot.

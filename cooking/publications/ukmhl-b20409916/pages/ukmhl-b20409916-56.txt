DRESSED GAME AND 44 the pheasant in the dripping pan ; pound the trail of the woodcock in a mortar with truffles, add anchovy, a Httle scraped bacon, and a lump of fresh butter ; spread a thick layer on the bread, roast the pheasant over it so as to catch all the dripping and dish up on it. Creme of Pheasants a la Moderne. Take two pheasants, remove the skin from the breast, and cut from each the two large fillets and the two under ones ; remove every particle of the white flesh that did not come away with the fillets, leaving the legs and pinions on the carcases. Spread each fillet on a board and with a knife scrape the flesh from the skin of the fillet. When the flesh is removed from the four large fillets and from the four smaller ones, and little remnants gathered from the carcases, place them in a mortar and pour in a gill of cream and pound well for a few minutes, then rub through clean wire sieve, place it back in the mortar and keep adding, a gill at a time, more cream until one pint of cream is used up ; now take two plain cylinder moulds, well buttered and ornamented according to fancy with truffles (or small dariole moulds maybe used), fill carefully and place a piece of buttered paper on the top of the mould or moulds, and place them in a stewpan with about a pint of boiling water and let them simmer very gently for twenty minutes and turn out. Make a sauce to serve with this dish of the carcases, &c., mixed with rich Bechamel sauce, and when dished there should be a garnish of peas, mushrooms, or shred truffles.

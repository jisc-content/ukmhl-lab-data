POULTRY A LA MODE. 49. Salmi of Pheasant. Half roast a pheasant, and when it is nearly cold cut it into neat joints, removing the skin. Put the bones and trimmings into a saucepan with an ounce of fresh butter, a bayleaf, and a bouquet garni, and stir these over a slow fire till lightly brown, then pour over half a pint of Espagnole sauce and a glassful of claret. Let all simmer for a quarter of an hour. Strain the gravy, skim it carefully, add a pinch of cayenne and the juice of half a lemon, then put it back into the saucepan with the pieces of game. Heat these up slowly. When cooked, dish up and pour the hot sauce over them and garnish with fried sippets. A little orange juice and a lump of sugar is an improve- ment to the sauce. Pheasant Stewed with Cabbage. Truss a pheasant for boiling. Divide a large cabbage into quarters, soak them after cutting off the stalks, plunge them into boiling water and boil for about ten minutes. Take them out, drain them and press all the water from them, then put them into the stewpan. Lay the pheasant well in the cab- bage, add six ounces of good bacon, half a pound of Bologna sausage, three pork sausages, some parsley, a bayleaf, a bouquet garni, one carrot, an onion stuck with four cloves, a shalot, and some pepper. Pour in as much stock as will cover the whole, and cover the pan closely and bring to a boil and let it simmer slowly for an hour. Then take out the bird and the meat and keep them warm whilst the cabbage is drained, peppered, E

PREFACE. At this the sporting season of the year, I venture to offer to the pubhc another of my Httle series in the form of Dressed Game and Poultry. No doubt many of the recipes are well known, but it has been my aim to collect from all the culinary pre- serves such recipes that from personal experience I know to be good. All the known and unknown tomes on the gourmet's art have been consulted, and I have to thank the authors for this assistance to my work, as well as those cordons bleus from w^hom I have practically learnt some few of them. I shall be very pleased to correspond with any of my readers who may wish to discourse on matters relative to the dinner table and its adjuncts, floral decorations among the number. H. A. DE SALIS. Hampton Lea, Sutton, Surrey, 1888.

POULTRY A LA MODE. 15 Game Pie. Take ten ounces of veal and the same of veal fat, and chop it very fine, season with pepper, salt, and cayenne. Arrange this as a lining round a china raised pie mould. Fill in with fillets of grouse, pheasant, partridge, and hare, strips of tongue, ham, hard-boiled yolks of eggs, button mushrooms, pis- tachio nuts, truffles, and pate de foie gras ; cover in with more of the mince, then put a paste on the top for cooking it in. Bake from two and a half to three hours. Remove the paste and fill the mould up v/ith clarified meat jelly, partly cold ; let this set. Ornament the top with chopped aspic and alternate slices of lemon and cucumber round. Croutons of red and yellow aspic should be ar- ranged at the base of the mould. Game Rissoles au Poulet a la Careme. Roll out very thin three-quarters of a pound of Brioche paste. Place upon it, two inches from the edge, minced fowl or game, prepared as for croquets, and rolled up between two teaspoons in balls the size of a nutmeg. Place these an inch from each other ; egg the paste all round and fold the edge of it over the balls of mince. Press it firmly down, and with a paste stamp two inches wide cut the rissoles, keeping the mince balls exactly in the centre of each. Lay them on a hot tin that the paste may rise and fry them in lard not too hot, turning them with a skewer. They will become quite round. When of a good golden colour drain them and serve directly, and dish up in a pyramid.

DRESSED GAME AND 20 Pressed Grouse. Boil a brace of grouse till very tender ; season, and then take away all the meat and pull it out very fine, removing all skin. Add to the liquor in which they were boiled a tablespoonful of gelatine for each three pounds of grouse, and keep stirring it in the boiling liquor till it is quite dissolved ; place the grouse in a deep tin basin, and pour the liquor over it whilst hot; stir it well, so that the meat may become thoroughly saturated with the liquor, then turn a plate over it, put on a heavy weight, let it get cold, and turn out. It may be made ornamental by boiling eggs hard, halving them, and putting the flat side on the basin or mould in which the grouse has to be pressed. Grouse Salad. Cut up a brace of cold grouse, and let them marinade in two tablespoonfuls of salad oil and the juice of a lemon, with a little salt and pepper, and let them remain in this for three hours. Pound the yolk of a hard-boiled egg very smooth, and mix it well with the yolk of a raw egg, a teaspoon- ful of salt, a little pepper, a dust of cayenne, and half a teaspoonful of finely-chopped onion, pouring in gradually drop by drop some fine salad oil; stir constantly, and, as it thickens, add a little tarragon vinegar, then add more oil and vinegar till there is enough sauce. Put some shred lettuce on a dish, place some marinaded grouse on it, pour the dress- ing over, and garnish with fillets of anchovies, slices of hard-boiled eggs, and sprigs of chervil. Chop up some savoury jelly, and place round it like a wreath.

22 DRESSED GAME AND Grouse Souffle. Take the breasts of two grouse already cooked, pound them in a mortar with two ounces of fresh butter and a very small piece of onion. Pass them through a sieve, add four eggs, beat the whites to a stiff froth, season with a little salt and dust of cayenne. Place it in a souffle dish, and bake it in a quick oven. Timbale of Grouse a la Vitellius. Simmer a slice of tongue in a stewpan till nearly cooked. Cut it up into fine dice, and put it back into the saucepan with four truffles, four tomatoes, and an ounce of butter ; add a little cornflour to thicken it. Moisten with half a pint of stock and a gill of claret. Reduce this, skim off all the fat; then add some finely-minced grouse, a sprig of parsley, and six anchovies which have been soaked in milk. Warm these over a slow fire, but do not let them boil; when done, pour into a fancy mould lined w^ith light puff paste. Bake, turn out, and serve very hot, garnished with crisped parsley. To Cook Hare. The great object in cooking a hare is to keep it as moist as possible, and therefore the hare must not be put too close to the fire in the first stage of roasting. Prepare a stuffing of quarter of a pound of beef suet, chopped finely, two ounces of un- cooked ham, a teaspoonful of chopped parsley, and two teaspoonfuls of dried mixed savoury herbs ;

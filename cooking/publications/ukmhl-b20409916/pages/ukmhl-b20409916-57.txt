POULTRY A LA MODE. 45 Pheasant Cutlets. Take a well-hung young pheasant, cut it when prepared into neat joints. Take out the bones care- fully and shape the joints into cutlets ; flatten these with the cutlet-bat, season rather highly and cover them thickly with egg and finely-grated bread- crumbs. Put the bones and trimmings into a sauce- pan with a carrot, a turnip, an onion, a handful of parsley, a bouquet garni, a bayleaf, pepper, salt, and as much water as will cover them. Let them stew slowly till the flavour of the herbs is drawn out, then thicken gravy and strain. Fry the cutlets in hot fat till a bright brown. Serve on a hot dish in a circle with one of the small bones stuck into each cutlet ; pour the gravy round. Galantine of Pheasant a la Mode. Bone a pheasant, cut off the legs and press what is left of the leg inside, and cut away any sinews. Take three-quarters of a pound of sau- sage meat, a dozen oysters, three or four truffles, a slice of tongue, and three rashers of fat bacon. Cut the truffles into small dice, also the tongue and bacon. Mix all together with the sausage meat, adding a little cayenne pepper, half a tea- spoonful of herbs mixed, half an ounce of melted gelatine, and two yolks of eggs. Mix well together, and spread over the pheasant evenly. Then roll it up lengthways and tightly in a cloth and place it in saucepan to boil for an hour, then take it out and remove the cloth carefully. To serve this dish, cut it up into thin slices and dish them in a circle, letting one piece overlap the other uniformly

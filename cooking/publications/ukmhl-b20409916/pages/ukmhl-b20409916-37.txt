2.5 POULTRY A LA MODE. GcLteaux de Lievre. Mince the best parts of a hare with a little mutton suet. Season the mince highly with herbs and good stock. Pound it in a mortar with some red currant jelly and make up into small cakes with raw eggs. Flour and fry them and dish them in a pyramid. Hare a la Matanzas. Paunch, skin, and clean a hare marinaded in vinegar for a couple of days with four onions sliced, three shalots, a couple of sprigs of parsley, pepper and salt. After two days take the hare out and drain it. Farce it with a stuffing made of the flesh of a chicken, three whole eggs, the liver, and a slice of bacon, all finely chopped, mixed and seasoned with pepper, salt, and a bou- quet garni. Now put the hare in a stewpan with slices of bacon all over it, some sliced carrots, two onions stuck with cloves, and half a pint of con- somme. Put some live coals on the lid of the saucepan and let it cook for three hours. Hare a la Mode. Skin the hare and cut it up in into joints and lard with fine fillets of bacon ; place in an earthen- ware pot, with some slices of salt pork, chopped bacon, salt, mixed spice, a piece of butter, and half a pint of port wine ; lay two or three sheets of buttered paper over it ; fix on the lid tightly and simmer over a slow fire. When nearly done, stir in the blood, boil up and serve.

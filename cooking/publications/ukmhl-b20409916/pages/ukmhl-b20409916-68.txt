56 DRESSED GAME AND Pigeons a la Soussell. Bone four pigeons, and make a forcemeat of some fillet of veal, some ham fat, some grated bread- crumbs, mushrooms, truffles, a shalot, a bouquet garni, a little cayenne, pepper and salt, mixed with butter cooked over the fire and then pounded in a mortar ; put some of this forcemeat into the pigeons and stew them gently for half an hour. Take the pigeons out and mask them well with more of the forcemeat, brush some beaten egg over each, and put them in the fryingpan and fry them in good dripping. Take the gravy they were stewed in, skim off all fat, thicken well with a liaison of cream and eggs, season with a little pepper and salt, and mix all together. Make a mound of spinach puree in the centre of the dish, and place the pigeons around, standing up against the puree. Take some very small boiled tomatoes, of a good shape, make a wreath round the base, place a few button mushrooms on the top of the spinach, and pour the sauce all round. Grey Plovers Cooked in Brandy. After trussing the plovers, flatten them and warm them in a stewpan with a little melted bacon fat, a bouquet garni, two onions, three mushrooms, and two or three truffles (the latter may be left out). As soon as they begin to colour, add half a pint of brandy and toss over a quick fire till the brandy is in flames ; as soon as the flames go out, moisten with gravy and simmer over a slow fire. When the birds are done, skim off all grease, add the juice of a lemon, and serve hot.

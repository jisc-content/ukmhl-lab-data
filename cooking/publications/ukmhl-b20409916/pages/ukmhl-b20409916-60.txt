DRESSED GAME AND 48 Pheasant des Rois. Have a pound of the best preserved truffles, such as can be obtained at Benoist's, in Wardour Street, stew them in a mixture of a quarter of a pound of butter, a large tablespoonful of finest Lucca oil, and half a pound of bacon fat scraped into shreds. Thoroughly cook the truffles, so that a silver fork can be stuck into them without push- ing hard. Stuff a pheasant with them and sew it up. Cover the breast with a slice of fat bacon, and put two or three slices beneath it. Place round the pheasant pieces of veal and ham cut into small cubes the size of dice, add a few carrots, an onion or two, salt and pepper. Pour on it a claretglassful of Chablis, cover the sauce- pan, place it on a slow fire and use the sala- mander, then let it stew for an hour. When ready to serve, strain the same, removing all grease, and pour over the bird. Pheasant a la Sainte Alliance. An expensive dish. Take a well-hung cock pheasant and truss it for roasting. Farce it with a stuffing made of two woodcocks' flesh and internals (or snipes') finely minced with two ounces of fresh butter, some salt, pepper, and a pinch of cayenne, a bouquet garni finely powdered, and as many chopped truffles as will be required to fill the pheasant. Truss the bird and roast, basting it well with fresh butter. Whilst roasting, lay in the pan a round of toast, upon which a little of the stuffing has been spread, and serve the bird on it. Bread sauce and brown gravy should be handed round with it.

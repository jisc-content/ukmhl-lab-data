POULTRY A LA MODE, rg cloth. Mince an onion ; take about a dozen pep- percorns, twenty juniper berries, three bayleaves, and put these into a gill of vinegar. Let the grouse soak in this for three days, turning them two or three times daily, and pouring the marinade over them. Stuff the birds with turkey forcemeat and lard the breasts. Place them in front of a clear fire, baste constantly, and serve with slices of lemon round the dish. Grouse au Nature!. Grouse should be wiped inside, but never washed. Have a brisk fire, and when the bird is trussed, place it before a brisk fire, and before it is taken down the breast should be basted with a little butter, and frothed and browned before it is sent up. A good sized grouse requires nearly three-quarters of an hour to cook it. Serve fried breadcrumbs and bread sauce with grouse. Grouse Pie. Take two or three grouse, cut off the wings and legs, and tuck the drumsticks in through a slit in the thigh ; singe the birds ; split them in halves ; season them with pepper and salt. Place some pieces of very tender beefsteak at the bottom of a pie dish, add chopped mushrooms, parsley, shalot, and two teaspoonfuls of chutnee sauce, and sprinkle over the steak. Place the halves of the grouse neatly on the top ; add a little more seasoning ; moisten with sufficient gravy made from the necks, legs, and wings. Cover with puff paste, and bake for about an hour and a half C 2

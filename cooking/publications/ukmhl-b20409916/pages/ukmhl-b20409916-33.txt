POULTRY A LA MODE, 21 Scallops of Grouse a la Financiere. Take a brace of grouse, remove the skin, take off all the flesh, and scrape the flesh into very fine shreds. Chop up all the bones and necks, and put them into a saucepan with an onion, five sprigs of thyme, three of parsley, and a small carrot ; cover with water, and let it boil slowly for three hours, skimming when it boils. Make a mixture of about half a pint of stock and two ounces of butter, and let boil. When the stock boils take 3| ounces of fine Vienna flour, and stir it well over the fire for about three minutes; then add the yolks of three eggs, stirring over the fire again. Take it then from the saucepan, and place it on a plate to get cool ; then pound the shredded grouse till quite fine, using a gill of cream; now pass it through a fine sieve. Take a plain round mould, holding a pint and a half, butter it, and ornament with truffles cut in devices. Cut up three or four mushrooms, and mix in with the grouse panada, and fill the mould. Place buttered paper over it, and let it steam for half an hour ; then turn out and let it get cold, and when cold cut it into a number of scallops of the same size. Egg and breadcrumb them, dip them in clarified butter, and fry a pale gold colour, and serve on a border of mashed potatoes. Make a sauce as follows :â€” Boil one glass of Marsala in half a pint of brown sauce for five minutes; place in the centre of them some mushrooms, truffles, and cockscombs, and pour sauce over these, but do not put the sauce over the scallops.

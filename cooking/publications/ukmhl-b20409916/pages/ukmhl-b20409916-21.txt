POULTRY A LA MODE, 9 and when it is nearly set put in the chicken with its breast downwards; the chicken having been masked all over with white sauce, in which aspic has been well mixed, and ornamented with a device of truffles cut in stars and kite shapes. When the chicken is in, fill up the mould gradually with the remainder of the jelly. Let it stand for some hours, or place it on ice before turning it out. Chicken with Spinach. Poach nicely in the gravy five or six eggs. Dress them on flattened balls of spinach round the dish and serve the fowl in the centre, rubbing down the liver to thicken the gravy and liquor in which the fowl has been stewed, which pour over it for sauce, skimming it well. Mushrooms, oysters, and forcemeat balls should be put into the sauce. Chicken Stewed Whole. Fill the inside of a chicken with large oysters and mushrooms and fasten a tape round to keep them in. Put it in a tin pan with a cover, and put this into a large boiling pot with boiling water, which must not quite reach up to the top of the pan the chicken is in. Keep it boiling till the chicken is done, which would be in about an hour's time after it begins to simmer. Remove the scum occasionally, and replenish with water as it boils away ; take all the gravy from it and put it into a small sauce- pan, keeping the chicken warm'. Thicken the gravy with butter, flour, and add two tablespoon- fuls of chopped oysters, the yolks of two eggs boiled hard and minced fine, some seasoning, and a gill of cream. Boil five minutes and dish the fowls.

After stuffing the fowl with this mixture, sew it up, turn the skin of the neck half over the head and cut off part of the comb, which will give it the appearance of a turtle's head. Blanch and singe four chickens' feet, cut off the claws and stick two where the wings ought to be and two in the thighs, so as to look like turtle's feet. Stew the pullet with a little ham, onions, and carrots, tossed previously in butter, moisten with stock, skim occasionally. When done, cut the string where it is sewn, lay it on its back in a dish, garnish the breast with sliced truffles cut in fancy shapes, and place a cray- fish tail to represent the turtle's tail.

Moisten with two spoonfuls of stock, a bouquet garni, two bay- leaves and a clove, pepper and salt to taste. Stew them for twenty minutes over a very slow fire. Drain them well, make a puree of peas in which a tablespoonful of aspic jelly has been mixed. Mask each quail with the puree, dish them in a crown shape with little rolls of bacon in front of each, have a few truffles or mushrooms cooked and placed in the centre, and pour over the quails a rich brown sauce.

At this the sporting season of the year, I venture to offer to the pubhc another of my Httle series in the form of Dressed Game and Poultry. No doubt many of the recipes are well known, but it has been my aim to collect from all the culinary pre- serves such recipes that from personal experience I know to be good. All the known and unknown tomes on the gourmet's art have been consulted, and I have to thank the authors for this assistance to my work, as well as those cordons bleus from w^hom I have practically learnt some few of them. I shall be very pleased to correspond with any of my readers who may wish to discourse on matters relative to the dinner table and its adjuncts, floral decorations among the number. H. A. DE SALIS. Hampton Lea, Sutton, Surrey, 1888.DRESSED GAME AND POULTRY A LA MODE. Blackbird Pie. Stuff the birds with the crumb of a French roll soaked in a little milk, which put in a stewpan with ounces of butter, a chopped shalot, some parsley, pepper, salt, a grate of nutmeg, and the yolks of two small eggs. Stir over the fire till it becomes a thick paste, and fill the insides of the birds with it. Line the bottom of the pie-dish with fried collops of rump steak, and place the birds on them neatly. Add four hard-boiled yolks of eggs, and pour gravy all over, cover with puff paste, and bake for one hour and a quarter. Blanquette of Chicken. Cut the meat from a cold boiled fowl, in small pieces. Stew down the bones in one pint of water, a bouquet garni, add a little salt and white pepper to taste.

Add lemon juice and serve hot. Blanquette of Chicken aux Concombres. Boil a chicken and cut it into neat joints. Cut a cucumber in pieces and fry in butter, put them in a little stock, which reduce ; have reduced half a pint of veloute sauce with a few trimmings of cucumber in it. Pour this through a tammy over the fowls, set it on the fire, and as soon as it bubbles add a liaison of three yolks of eggs, work in a little butter and lemon juice, drain the pieces of cucumber in a cloth, throw them in, and serve them in an open vol au vent, garnished with flowers of puff paste. Capilotade of Fowl or Turkey. Take th© remains of a cold fowl or turkey, and cut it into neat joints. Chop up three or four mush- rooms, some parsley, a shalot, and a piece of butter the size of a walnut, and let all fry together for a short time; then moisten with a little good-flavoured stock, and thicken with flour.

Braised Drumsticks of Chicken. Braise the drumsticks, and arrange them uprightly in tent fashion, and all around and between the drumsticks should be finely chopped salad. Alternate slices of tongue and ham should be placed at the edge of the salad, and the border of the dish ornamented with thin rounds of beetroot. Chickens Chiringrate. Cut off the feet of a chicken, break the breast- bone flat, but be careful not to break the skin. Flour it and fry it in butter, drain all the fat out of the pan, but leave the chicken in. Make a farce from half a pound of fillet of beef, half a pound of veal, ten ounces of cooked ham, a shalot, a bou- quet garni, and a piece of carrot, pepper, and salt; cook in stock, and then pass it through a sieve, and lay this farce over the chicken.

Cut a chicken into fillets and neat joints. Mince finely a Spanish onion and stew it with two ounces of butter, a few drops of lemon, pepper, and salt; when it has been stewed for half an hour, pass it through a tammy, and mix in with it a good tablespoonful of aspic jelly. Mask the chicken with this, and warm up the chicken in the bain-marie. Fillets of Chicken ^ la Cardinal. Cook some fillets of chicken in butter, and when done place them in a circle round an entree dish, with a mushroom between each fillet. Fill the centre with AUemagne sauce, to which has been added some lobster and crayfish butter to make it red. Garnish with crayfish tails if handy. Fried Chicken a la Orly.

Then stew for over an hour, if the fowls are tender; if not they may take from three to four hours. They must be cooked very slozvly. When tender, add a chopped onion, a shalot, parsley, and pepper. Cover closely again, and when it has heated to boiling, stir in a teacupful of milk, to which have been added two beaten eggs and two tablespoon- fuls of flour. Boil up and add an ounce of butter. Arrange the chickens neatly in an entree dish, pour the gravy over and serve. Fritot of Chicken aux Tomates. Take the remains of a boiled fowl and cut into pieces the size of a small cutlet. Shake a little flour over them and put them aside. Prepare a batter made of half a pound of Vienna flour, the yolk of one egg, half a gill of salad oil, and a gill of light coloured ale. Mix all these together lightly till it will mask the tip of your finger, add half a pint of puree of tomato, and mix well to- gether. Dip the chicken cutlets into this batter, masking them well^ and then put them in good lard and fry, and place them on a wire sieve as they arePOULTRY A LA MODE. 7 cooked, keeping them near the fire to keep them hot and crisp. Dish piled in a pyramid with tomatoes whole and tomato sauce round. Chicken Nouilles au Parmesan. Take a large fowl, and when trussed put a lump of butter inside it, and cover the breast with fat bacon. Put it into a stewpan with an onion, a carrot, a piece of celery ; cover with water and boil slowly for fifty minutes. Garnish the dish on which it is served with a pint of Nouilles boiled in a stewpan of boiling water for twenty minutes, drained, and then put into another saucepan with two ounces of butter. Sprinkle in two ounces of Parmesan cheese and warm up for five minutes, then garnish the fowl with them, and pour over it a pint of rich Bechamel sauce, in which two ounces of Parmesan cheese has been mixed. The Nouilles are made by mixing half a pound of butter with three eggs till it becomes a thick smooth paste, roll it out very thin, cut it into strips an inch wide, and place four or five of these on the top of each other, shred them in thin slices like Julienne vege- tables, and drain them. Chicken Pudding a la Reine. Take the meat from a cold fowl and pound it in a mortar, after removing the skin and sinews. Boil in light stock a couple of good tablespoonfuls of rice. When it is done and has soaked up the rice, add the pounded chicken to it, with a gill of cream, pepper, and salt. If not moist enough, add a little more cream. Butter a plain mould, fill it with the rice and chicken, tie a pudding cloth8 DRESSED GAME AND closely over, and put the mould into a stewpan of hot water to boil for an hour. The water should only reach about three-quarters up the mould. When done, turn it out and serve a good white mushroom sauce round it. Chicken and Rice. Polio con Arroz (Spanish Recipe). Cut a fowl into joints, wipe quite dry, and trim neatly. Put a wineglass of the best olive oil in a stewpan, let it get hot. Put in the chicken, stir and turn the joints and sprinkle with salt. When the chicken is a golden brown add some chopped onions, one or two red chillies, and fry all together. Meanwhile have ready four tomatoes cut in quar- ters, and two teacupfuls of rice well washed. Mix these with the chicken and pour in a very small qnantity of broth and stew till the rice is cooked and the broth dried up. Sprinkle a little chopped parsley and serve in a deep dish without a cover, as the steam must not be kept in. Chicken in Savoury Jelly. Take a large chicken and roast it. Boil a calf's foot to a strong jelly, take out the foot and skim off the fat; beat up the whites of two eggs and mix them with a quarter of a pint of white wine vinegar, the juice of one lemon, a little salt, a table- spoonful of tarragon vinegar, and a claret-glassful of sherry. Put these to the jelly, and when it has boiled five or six minutes strain it through a jelly bag till clear. Then put a little into an oblong baking tin (big enough for a half-quartern loaf),POULTRY A LA MODE, 9 and when it is nearly set put in the chicken with its breast downwards; the chicken having been masked all over with white sauce, in which aspic has been well mixed, and ornamented with a device of truffles cut in stars and kite shapes. When the chicken is in, fill up the mould gradually with the remainder of the jelly. Let it stand for some hours, or place it on ice before turning it out. Chicken with Spinach. Poach nicely in the gravy five or six eggs. Dress them on flattened balls of spinach round the dish and serve the fowl in the centre, rubbing down the liver to thicken the gravy and liquor in which the fowl has been stewed, which pour over it for sauce, skimming it well. Mushrooms, oysters, and forcemeat balls should be put into the sauce. Chicken Stewed Whole. Fill the inside of a chicken with large oysters and mushrooms and fasten a tape round to keep them in. Put it in a tin pan with a cover, and put this into a large boiling pot with boiling water, which must not quite reach up to the top of the pan the chicken is in. Keep it boiling till the chicken is done, which would be in about an hour's time after it begins to simmer. Remove the scum occasionally, and replenish with water as it boils away ; take all the gravy from it and put it into a small sauce- pan, keeping the chicken warm'. Thicken the gravy with butter, flour, and add two tablespoon- fuls of chopped oysters, the yolks of two eggs boiled hard and minced fine, some seasoning, and a gill of cream. Boil five minutes and dish the fowls.lo DRESSED GAME AND Cotelettes a TEcarlate. Make a stiff forcemeat from the breast of a fowl or pheasant, or the two breasts of partridge or grouse. Cut some shoes of tongue into cutlet shapes. Take some more tongue, pound and. pass it through a sieve and mix it with the forcemeat. Season with a little cayenne and mushroom flavour. Butter and fill up some cutlet moulds with the forcemeat, and steam them in the oven. Then turn out the cutlets and place them on a baking sheet. Glaze them and replace them in the oven for a few seconds. Dish up alternately a cutlet of tongue with a cutlet of forcemeat; sauce the whole with chaud-froid sauce, and garnish with chopped aspic and very small red tomatoes. Forced Capon. Cut the skin of a capon down the breast, care- fully slip the knife down so as to take out all the meat, and mix it with a pound of beef suet cut small. Beat this together in a marble mortar, and take a pint of large oysters cut small, two ancho- vies, a shalot, a bouquet garni, a little mignonette pepper, and the yolks of four eggs. Mix all these well together, and lay it on the bones ; then draw the skin over it, and sew up. Put the capon into a cloth, and boil it an hour and a quarter. Stew a dozen oysters in good gravy thickened with a piece of butter rolled in flour ; take the capon out of the cloth, lay it in its dish, and pour the sauce over it.POULTRY A LA MODE. II Capon a la Nanterre. Make a stuffing with the Hver of the capon, a dozen roasted chestnuts, a piece of butter, parsley, green onions, very Httle garUc, two yolks of eggs, salt and pepper.

When it is cooked, brush it over with the yolk of an egg diluted in a little lukewarm batter ; sprinkle bread- crumbs over all, and let it brown, and serve with a sharp sauce. Braised Ducks a la St. Michel. Rub some flour and oil over a couple of ducks, and brown them in the oven for a short time. Mix together a cup of Chablis wine and a cup of broth, season with pepper and salt; braise the ducks till they are tender. Chop some mushrooms, chives, and parsley ; mix these in the broth in which the ducks were braised. Put the ducks to keep warm before the fire whilst the sauce ' reduces.' Dredge in a very little flour, and send up the ducks with the sauce round them. Duck a la Mode. Divide two ducks into quarters, and put them in a stewpan, and sprinkle over them flour, pepper, and salt. Put into the stewpan several pieces of butter, and fry the ducks till a nice brown colour. Remove the frying fat, and pour in half a pint of gravy and half a pint of port wine, sprinkle in more flour, add a bouquet garni, three minced shalots, an anchovy, and a dust of cayenne. Let them stew for twenty minutes, then place them on12 DRESSED GAME AND a dish, remove the herbs, clear off the fat, and serve with the sauce over them. Braised Duck la Nivernaise. Line a braisingpan with sHces of bacon, add the duck, cover it with bacon, and season with a bouquet of parsley, carrots, thyme, and bay leaves ; moisten with stock and the same quantity of claret; fix the lid very tightly on the pan, and simmer over a slow fire, with hot coals on the lid of the stewpan. Cut up some turnips into balls, cook them in butter till brown, drain and simmer in brown thickening, moistened with a little stock. When the duck is cooked, dish up, and garnish with the turnips. Devilled Duck or Teal. Indian Recipe. Take a pound of onions, a piece of green ginger, and six chillies. Reduce them to a pulp, then add two teaspoonfuls of mustard, pepper, salt, cayenne, and chutney, two tablespoonfuls of ketchup, and half a bottle of claret.

Take the giblets of a duck and the flesh off the carcase, and the bones, and stew them in equal quantities of claret and stock, salt, pepper, and three shalots. Reduce and simmer till it is thick, then pass through a sieve, and take it off the fire before it boils. Cut up the duck into neat pieces and lay it in the stewpan with the gravy. Squeeze juice of strained orange over it, and serve en pyramide. Stewed Duck and Turnips. Brown the duck in a stewpan with some butter, peel and cut some young turnips into equal sizes, and brown in the same butter ; stir in a little powdered sugar, reduce some stock to a thin brown sauce, season with salt, pepper, a bouquet of parsley, chives, half a head of garlic, and a bayleaf Stew the duck in this sauce, and when half cooked14 DRESSED GAME AND add the turnips, turn the duck from time to time, being careful not to break the turnips, cook slowly, and skim off all grease and serve. Roast Goose Stuffed with Chestnuts. Prepare a goose and stuff it with a mixture of minced bacon, the liver, salt, pepper, grated nut- meg, and chestnuts, which have been previously cooked and peeled. Baste the goose well whilst roasting. When cooked, serve with its own gravy, and sprinkle with salt, pepper, and the juice of a lemon. Goose a la Royale. Having boned the goose, stuff it with the follow- ing forcemeat:—Twelve sage leaves, two onions, and two apples, all shred very fine. Mix with four ounces grated bread, four ounces of beef suet, two glasses of port wine, a grate of nutmeg, pep- per, and salt to taste, the grated peel of a lemon, and the beaten yolks of four eggs ; sew up the goose and fry in butter till a light brown, and put it into two quarts of good stock and let it stew for two hours, and till the liquor is nearly consumed ; then take up the goose, strain the liquor and take off the fat, add a spoonful of lemon pickle, the same of browning and port wine, a teaspoonful of essence of anchovy, a little cayenne and salt, boil it up and pour over the goose.

Bake from two and a half to three hours. Remove the paste and fill the mould up v/ith clarified meat jelly, partly cold ; let this set. Ornament the top with chopped aspic and alternate slices of lemon and cucumber round. Croutons of red and yellow aspic should be ar- ranged at the base of the mould. Game Rissoles au Poulet a la Careme. Roll out very thin three-quarters of a pound of Brioche paste. Place upon it, two inches from the edge, minced fowl or game, prepared as for croquets, and rolled up between two teaspoons in balls the size of a nutmeg. Place these an inch from each other ; egg the paste all round and fold the edge of it over the balls of mince. Press it firmly down, and with a paste stamp two inches wide cut the rissoles, keeping the mince balls exactly in the centre of each. Lay them on a hot tin that the paste may rise and fry them in lard not too hot, turning them with a skewer. They will become quite round. When of a good golden colour drain them and serve directly, and dish up in a pyramid.DRESSED GAME AND i6 Salad of Game a la Francatelli. Boil eight eggs hard ; shell them, and cut a thin slice off the bottom of each, cut each into four lengthwise. Make a very thin flat border of butter about one inch from the edge of the dish the salad is to be served on, fix the pieces of egg upright close to each other, the yolk outside, or alternately the white and yolk, lay in the centre a layer of fresh salad, and, having cut a freshly roasted young grouse into eight or ten pieces, prepare a sauce as follows : Put a spoonful of eschalots finely chopped in a basin, one ditto of castor sugar, the yolk of one egg, a teaspoonful of chopped parsley, tarragon, and chervil, and a little salt. Mix in by degrees four spoonfuls of oil and two of white vinegar. When well mixed put it on ice, and when ready to serve up whip a gill of cream, which lightly mix with it. Then lay the inferior parts of the grouse on the salad, sauce over so as to cover each piece, then lay over the salad and the remainder of the grouse, sauce over, and serve. The eggs can be ornamented with a little dot of radish or beetroot on the point. Anchovy and gherkin, cut into small diamonds, may be placed between. Grouse in Aspic. Roast a brace of grouse, and skin them, and mask them with brown sauce in which aspic has been mixed. Cut some pistachio kernels into pretty shapes and ornament the birds. Take a large square tin mould (a baking tin will do), pour in a layer of pale aspic, and when it is all but cold place the grouse on it breast downward, one turnedPOULTRY A LA MOLJE. one way and one the other, then gradually fill it up with the aspic, and put on ice. Turn out and de- corate the base with chopped aspic, truffles, parsley, and tomatoes. Croustades of Grouse a la Diable. Cut some fillets of grouse into cutlet shapes, also some slices of fried bread ; sprinkle the latter with grated Parmesan cheese. Put the fillets of grouse on the cheesed bread. Mask them with a puree of tomatoes and a tiny dust of cayenne, then add a little more grated Parmesan, a little parsley, some breadcrumbs, and little pieces of butter. Salamander over and serve hot. Grouse a TEcossaise. Take a brace of grouse ; put three ounces of good dripping or butter inside each, but not in the crop. Put them down to roast, and baste till cooked. Have a slice of toast in the pan under them just before they are cooked. Parboil the liver, pound with butter, salt, and cayenne, and spread it on the toast. Grouse a la Financiere. Take a brace of grouse ; boil the livers for a few minutes, and pound them in a mortar with three ounces of butter, a little salt, pepper, a grate of nut- meg, one tablespoonful of breadcrumbs, and three or four mushrooms. Stuff the grouse with this, truss and roast them, and baste plentifully. Take some sauce espagnole, add a few mushrooms and CDRESSED GAME AND a dust of cayenne. Let all boil up together and serve with the grouse. Friantine of Grouse. Cut with two cutters, one larger than the other, twelve thin flat pieces of pastry, put on the centre of the largest a tablespoonful of quenelle meat and spread it out; in the centre of this put a table- spoonful of the breast of a grouse, cut up with two ounces of lean ham. Mix well and put it into a stewpan with three-quarters of a pint of white cream sauce. Warm up and let it get cold. Cover this with the smaller sized pieces of pastry, having wetted the inside of each with yolk of egg to make them adhere to the lowest pastry, press down tightly with the smallest cutters, and cut the bottom pastry to the size of the smaller cutter. Egg and breadcrumb. Arrange them in a frying basket and fry in boiling lard a nice brown. Serve garnished with fried parsley. Grouse Kromesquis. Take the remains of cold grouse and mince it very fine. Mix with it a couple of tablespoonfuls of grated ham or tongue. Divide into small sau- sage shapes, dip each in batter, fry a pale golden colour and serve very hot, garnished with crisped parsley. Grouse Marinaded* German Recipe. Hang the birds as long as possible, then pluck and draw them and wipe their insides with a softPOULTRY A LA MODE, rg cloth. Mince an onion ; take about a dozen pep- percorns, twenty juniper berries, three bayleaves, and put these into a gill of vinegar. Let the grouse soak in this for three days, turning them two or three times daily, and pouring the marinade over them. Stuff the birds with turkey forcemeat and lard the breasts. Place them in front of a clear fire, baste constantly, and serve with slices of lemon round the dish. Grouse au Nature!. Grouse should be wiped inside, but never washed. Have a brisk fire, and when the bird is trussed, place it before a brisk fire, and before it is taken down the breast should be basted with a little butter, and frothed and browned before it is sent up. A good sized grouse requires nearly three-quarters of an hour to cook it. Serve fried breadcrumbs and bread sauce with grouse. Grouse Pie. Take two or three grouse, cut off the wings and legs, and tuck the drumsticks in through a slit in the thigh ; singe the birds ; split them in halves ; season them with pepper and salt. Place some pieces of very tender beefsteak at the bottom of a pie dish, add chopped mushrooms, parsley, shalot, and two teaspoonfuls of chutnee sauce, and sprinkle over the steak. Place the halves of the grouse neatly on the top ; add a little more seasoning ; moisten with sufficient gravy made from the necks, legs, and wings. Cover with puff paste, and bake for about an hour and a half C 2DRESSED GAME AND 20 Pressed Grouse. Boil a brace of grouse till very tender ; season, and then take away all the meat and pull it out very fine, removing all skin. Add to the liquor in which they were boiled a tablespoonful of gelatine for each three pounds of grouse, and keep stirring it in the boiling liquor till it is quite dissolved ; place the grouse in a deep tin basin, and pour the liquor over it whilst hot; stir it well, so that the meat may become thoroughly saturated with the liquor, then turn a plate over it, put on a heavy weight, let it get cold, and turn out. It may be made ornamental by boiling eggs hard, halving them, and putting the flat side on the basin or mould in which the grouse has to be pressed. Grouse Salad. Cut up a brace of cold grouse, and let them marinade in two tablespoonfuls of salad oil and the juice of a lemon, with a little salt and pepper, and let them remain in this for three hours. Pound the yolk of a hard-boiled egg very smooth, and mix it well with the yolk of a raw egg, a teaspoon- ful of salt, a little pepper, a dust of cayenne, and half a teaspoonful of finely-chopped onion, pouring in gradually drop by drop some fine salad oil; stir constantly, and, as it thickens, add a little tarragon vinegar, then add more oil and vinegar till there is enough sauce. Put some shred lettuce on a dish, place some marinaded grouse on it, pour the dress- ing over, and garnish with fillets of anchovies, slices of hard-boiled eggs, and sprigs of chervil. Chop up some savoury jelly, and place round it like a wreath.POULTRY A LA MODE, 21 Scallops of Grouse a la Financiere. Take a brace of grouse, remove the skin, take off all the flesh, and scrape the flesh into very fine shreds. Chop up all the bones and necks, and put them into a saucepan with an onion, five sprigs of thyme, three of parsley, and a small carrot ; cover with water, and let it boil slowly for three hours, skimming when it boils. Make a mixture of about half a pint of stock and two ounces of butter, and let boil. When the stock boils take 3| ounces of fine Vienna flour, and stir it well over the fire for about three minutes; then add the yolks of three eggs, stirring over the fire again. Take it then from the saucepan, and place it on a plate to get cool ; then pound the shredded grouse till quite fine, using a gill of cream; now pass it through a fine sieve. Take a plain round mould, holding a pint and a half, butter it, and ornament with truffles cut in devices. Cut up three or four mushrooms, and mix in with the grouse panada, and fill the mould. Place buttered paper over it, and let it steam for half an hour ; then turn out and let it get cold, and when cold cut it into a number of scallops of the same size. Egg and breadcrumb them, dip them in clarified butter, and fry a pale gold colour, and serve on a border of mashed potatoes. Make a sauce as follows :— Boil one glass of Marsala in half a pint of brown sauce for five minutes; place in the centre of them some mushrooms, truffles, and cockscombs, and pour sauce over these, but do not put the sauce over the scallops.22 DRESSED GAME AND Grouse Souffle. Take the breasts of two grouse already cooked, pound them in a mortar with two ounces of fresh butter and a very small piece of onion. Pass them through a sieve, add four eggs, beat the whites to a stiff froth, season with a little salt and dust of cayenne. Place it in a souffle dish, and bake it in a quick oven. Timbale of Grouse a la Vitellius. Simmer a slice of tongue in a stewpan till nearly cooked. Cut it up into fine dice, and put it back into the saucepan with four truffles, four tomatoes, and an ounce of butter ; add a little cornflour to thicken it. Moisten with half a pint of stock and a gill of claret. Reduce this, skim off all the fat; then add some finely-minced grouse, a sprig of parsley, and six anchovies which have been soaked in milk. Warm these over a slow fire, but do not let them boil; when done, pour into a fancy mould lined w^ith light puff paste. Bake, turn out, and serve very hot, garnished with crisped parsley. To Cook Hare. The great object in cooking a hare is to keep it as moist as possible, and therefore the hare must not be put too close to the fire in the first stage of roasting.

Pass through hair sieve and add the yolks of four eggs whipped to a stiff froth ; put it into a mould and bake in a quick oven. Serve with a good gravy round, made from the bones and trimmings, the juice of half a lemon, and a glass of port wine ; thicken with butter and cornflour. Snipes a la Superlative. Make a forcemeat of three ounces of fat bacon, three ounces of fowl's liver, and cut both into pieces an inch square. Fry the bacon over a sharp fire, move it about constantly, and in three or four minutes add the liver. When it is half done, mince it with the bacon, season, and add half a clove of garlic and pound all smoothly in a mortar. PassPOULTRY A LA MODE. 69 through wire sieve. When quite cold, roll out half of it with a little flour, form it into a thick band, and arrange it in a circle at the bottom of a dish. Take four partially roasted snipes, split them open down the back, and spread the forcemeat a quarter of an inch thick over the inside of each. Place the birds in the middle of the dish, and cover them with some of the forcemeat, smooth with a hot knife and put the dish into a quick oven, wipe away all fat, pour truffle sauce over the snipe, and serve. Teal Pudding. Take three teal, season the birds with salt and cayenne, and divide them into neat pieces. Cut up a pound of rump steak into pieces about an inch in size, season, and dredge them lightly with flour. Line a pudding-basin with good suet paste rolled out to half an inch thickness. Place in a layer of steak and a layer of teal, and repeat till the dish is full, then fill in with three-quarters of a pint of good gravy, and put the cover on in the usual way. Plunge it into boiling water and keep it boiling till done. Serve it in the basin it is cooked in, with a napkin pinned round it. Salmi of Teal. Put in a stewpan three ounces of butter and one good spoonful of flour, let them melt together, stirring till it becomes a nice brown ; add by de- grees a gill of good stock and as much red wine, two whole shalots (taken out after), a full bouquet, pepper, and a little salt; put in the body and bones of the bird, from which you have previously detached70 DRESSED GAME AND the limbs and meat Let all boil slowly for half an hour, pass all through colander, and put gravy alone back in stewpan on the fire, and just when on the point of boiling put in the pieces of teal and take the stewpan off the fire ; add a little lemon juice, put the lid on, and leave it on the hob for half an hour. Stewed Teal. Truss the birds, putting aside the hearts, livers, and gizzards, and dredge them with flour, then place them in a saucepan with a piece of butter, and let them brown equally, taking care of the gravy w^hich oozes from them. Let them get cold, then carve them in such a way that the wings and legs can be taken off with a piece of breast adhering to it. Break the bodies of the birds into small pieces, and stew them with the livers, &c., in as much stock as will cover them, till the gravy becomes good and strong, then strain it, season with cay- enne, salt, a glassful of claret, and a little Seville orange juice. Directly it begins to boil, put in the fleshy portion of the birds and let simmer till they are thoroughly heated, but do not let the gravy boil. Cut slices of bread large enough for a leg and wing to lie upon, fry till lightly browned, ar- range them neatly, and pour sauce over them. Garnish with sliced lemon. Devilled Turkey Drumsticks. Score the drumsticks down parallel with the bone, and insert in the slices thus made a mixture made with one ounce of butter, a good teaspoonful of French mustard, a little cayenne, and a salt- spoonful of black pepper. Mix all this thoroughlyPOULTRY A LA MODE. 71 together and spread the mixture into the cuts, then rub the drumsticks with butter, and grill over a fierce fire. Turkey en Daube. Put slices of bacon in a braising-pan, lard the breast and thighs of a turkey trussed for boiling, and place the turkey on the slices of bacon ; put into the pan a slice of ham and a calf's foot broken into small pieces, with the trimmings of the turkey, two onions stuck with four cloves, three carrots, and a bouquet garni. Put slices of bacon over the turkey, put some melted butter over, and cover with three rounds of buttered paper and let it simmer for five hours ; take it from the fire and leave it for half an hour, strain the gravy and boil it down. Beat an egg into a saucepan, and pour the jellied gravy into this, whip it well, then put it on the fire, bring it to the boil, and then draw it to the side of the fireplace, cover it with the lid with hot coals on it, and let it remain for half an hour ; strain again, and with this jelly cover the turkey. Venison Cutlets. Trim the cutlets the same as you would mutton cutlets, melt a little butter on a plate, dip each cutlet in the butter, and dust them slightly with flour, then in beaten egg, and roll them in bread- crumbs. Fry them in hot lard for ten minutes, take them out of the lard and lay them on a flat dish covered with paper ; put them before the fire for a few minutes to free them from grease. Dish them up, and pour Financiere sauce round the cutlets.DRESSED GAME AND 72 Venison Cutlets a TAmericaine. Cut the cutlets very small, and arrange them en couronne. Make an Espagnole sauce, and flavour it with bayleaves, garlic, half a pound of red currant jelly, and a glass of Madeira. Haricot of Venison. Take a neck or shoulder of venison, and cut the meat of the shoulder in pieces two inches square and the neck in thick cutlets. Fry these pieces with two ounces of butter in a stewpan over a brisk fire until they are browned, then pour off all grease, shake in a little flour, and stir together, moisten with sufficient stock to cover the meat, season with pepper and salt, and stir over fire till it boils. Remove it then to the corner of the stove to allow it to throw up its scum, which remove. Wash and scrape three carrots, and with a vegetable scoop cut out all the pink from the carrots in round balls, and boil them in water for half an hour. Cut out some balls of turnip in the same manner, and boil for fifteen minutes. Strain the vegetables and add them to the stew, with a glass of port wine and two ounces of red currant jelly. When the meat and vegetables are thoroughly cooked, and the stew well skimmed, dish it up very quickly. Venison Pasty. Stew the venison, remove all the bones, sinew, and skin, cutting off the fat and putting it aside. Make the paste in the usual way, and cover the edge and sides of a pasty dish : then put in the73 POULTRY A LA MODE. pieces of venison, packing it closely together, pepper and salt it well. Cover it with the paste and then bake it, which will take about four hours. Pour in at the top three-quarters of a pint of venison gravy which has been made from the bones and trim- mings, two shalots, a gill of port wine, and a table- spoonful of ketchup. Venison Puffs. Cut some cold venison into very thin shavings, mix a tablespoonful of red currant jelly with some rich brown sauce, and put on the venison pieces. Have ready some light puff paste, roll it out thin and divide it in pieces, put some of the meat in each, and form them into puffs. Brush with white of egg, and bake quickly a delicate brown colour. Salmis of Widgeon. Take two widgeon that have been cooked, cut them up into neat pieces, break up the bones and put them into brown stock with some minced shalots, pepper and salt, and let them simmer very slowly for half an hour, then add a glass of port wine, half a teaspoonfulof Clarence's cayenne sauce, and a squeeze of orange. Let it all boil up for about a quarter of an hour, and add an ounce of butter into which a little flour has been rubbed ; let it thicken, then strain, pour the gravy over the cold pieces of bird, and bring slowly to the boil and serve with fried sippets. Some button mushrooms added to the gravy are a great improvement. Widgeon may be cooked in as many ways as teal, using the same recipes, substituting widgeon for teal.74 DRESSED GAME AND Fillets of Wild Ducks with Olives. Roast a couple of wild ducks and cut off the fillets in the usual way, score the skin, dish the fillets in a circle and put into the centre some stoned olives. Send clear brown gravy in a tureen with them. Wild Fowl with Bigarade Sauce. Roast a couple of wild fowl, cut off flesh from each side of the breast, and from sides under the wings. Score the skin, and dish the fillets in a circle with a little Bigarade sauce poured over them. Woodcock a la Chasseur. Truss a brace of cocks and put them down before a clear fire for fifteen minutes, then take them away and cut them into neat joints. Put the inferior pieces with three minced shalots, a bouquet garni, and half a head of garlic into a saucepan with a wineglassful of good gravy, another of wine, a tablespoonful of mushroom ketchup, and the strained juice of half a lemon, and let all simmer for ten minutes. Remove the gizzards from the trail, and pound them in a mortar with a piece of shalot, a little butter, pepper, and salt, and then rub through a sieve and spread them upon small pieces of fried bread cut into the shape of hearts. Put the joints of the woodcocks into a separate saucepan, strain the gravy on them, and let them heat gently ; they must not boil. Place them on a dish, put the fried bread with the trail round them, pour the gravy over all, and serve hot.75 POULTRY A LA MODE. Woodcock a la LucuUus. Roast the woodcocks in the usual way, and catch the trail on a toast. Whilst the birds are still under-dressed, pour over them a little melted butter w^ith which the yolk of an egg and a little cream has been mixed. Sprinkle grated breadcrumbs over, brown with a salamander, and serve with brown gravy. Woodcock a la Perigueux. Truss a brace of woodcocks, cover them with layers of bacon and put them into a stewpan with as much richly flavoured stock as will barely cover them, and add a glassful of Madeira. Let them simmer till done enough, drain, dish them, and pour over some Perigueux sauce. Woodcock a la Proven^ale. Fillet a brace of woodcock, soak them in salad oil seasoned with black pepper, some cloves, and a pounded head of garlic. Place the bones on a stewpan with some salad oil, six shalots, a head of garlic, a bayleaf, and a bouquet garni. When brown, add a dessert-spoonful of flour, a tumblerful of Chablis, and a pint of stock. Reduce to half the quantity, and pass through a tammy. Saute the fillets in warm oil ; when done, place them in a circle on an entree dish with a fried bread sippet between each, stir a little lemon juice into the sauce, and pour over the fillets. Woodcock en Surprise. Take two livers of fowls and the trails of some cold woodcocks. Chop very finely two shalots, a76 DRESSED GAME, sprig of parsley, and eight flap mushrooms, and fry in butter. When nearly cooked, put in the trail and livers to fry with the vegetables. After, pound all together in a mortar, and season with salt and pepper. Cut some neat slices of bread about two inches square, and fry them a pale colour, then spread on them the liver and trail forcemeat. Place them into the oven to colour, then dish them up with the woodcocks made into a salmi over them, with a good rich brown sauce flavoured with claret round. Salmi of Woodcocks a la Lucullus. Take three woodcocks, which must be roasted very under-done. Take out the trail, and add to it either three fowl livers or their equivalent in pate de foie gras. Make a farce with a dozen mush- rooms chopped very fine, a shalot, a sprig of parsley, both chopped fine. Fry these in a little butter, then add the trails and livers or pate de foie gras to fry with them ; when done, pound all in a mortar and season with salt, pepper, and a dust of cayenne. As three woodcocks will give six fillets, cut six bits of bread of the same size and fry them of a nice colour. Then spread the farce equally divided over the six croustades, put them into the oven, and when of a good colour put them between each of the fillets. Make the sauce from the bones and cuttings of the birds, add six spoonfuls of Espagnole sauce and a glass of Marsala. The fillets should be kept in the hot sauce whilst the croustades are cooking, so as to prevent their getting dry, then warm them up without boiling, as boiling would spoil the dish.INDEX.

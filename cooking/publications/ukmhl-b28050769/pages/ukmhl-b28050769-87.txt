DRESSED FISH A LA MODE. 75 Court Bouillon. Sauce Court Bouillon. Fill a fishpan nearly to the brim with white wine, a wineglassful of brandy, the same quantity of sherry, and season with salt, pepper, two heads of cloves, a head of garlic, sliced onions, carrots, turnips, parsnips, celery, chervil, parsley, a bay-leaf, thyme, and a lump of fresh butter. Boil over a quick fire till reduced a third ; if the wine catches fire it will greatly improve the flavour of the sauce. When used for cooking fish, see that the court bouillon is boiling before putting it in, and have sufficient to cover the fish entirely. A more economical way of preparing this sauce is by using equal quantities of vinegar and water instead of white wine, and by omitting some of the vegetables. Dutch Sauce. Sauce Hollandaise. Take two ounces of butter; put it into a stew- pan with four yolks of eggs, and stand the pan in a saucepan of hot water over the fire, and keep stirring it well; season it with salt to taste and a dust of cayenne ; stir till it thickens and is quite smooth, and be careful that it does not boil or it will curdle. When ready to serve, put in one table- spoonful of French vinegar, one of tarragon, and half the juice of a lemon.

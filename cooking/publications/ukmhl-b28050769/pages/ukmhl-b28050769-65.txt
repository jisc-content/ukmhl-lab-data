53 DRESSED FISH A LA MODE. Red Mullet a l’ltalienne. Rougets k l’ltalienne. Wrap the fish in buttered paper, retaining the tail, and bake them in the oven, dishing them up in the buttered paper. Send the following sauce in a tureen. One chopped shalot, one chopped mush- room, some chopped fine herbs mixed in a brown sauce, into which put a glass of chablis or sauterne. Red Mullet in Cases. Rouget en Caisses. Do not clean the inside of the mullet, but take out the livers and replace them with some salted butter and finely-chopped parsley, pepper, salt, and a little garlic; place them on the gridiron with red-hot coals underneath, and hold a sala- mander over them—this prevents having to turn the fish. When cooked squeeze the juice of a lemon over the mullet. Red Mullet a la Mdtropole. Rougets a la Metropole. Make a sauce of three glassfuls of hock and sherry mixed (hock predominating) ; slice thinly a small carrot and turnip and half a lemon ; add a bay-leaf, a grate of nutmeg, a sprig of thyme and parsley. Lay in three red mullets and stewover a slow fire ; strain the gravy, thicken with butter rolled in flour, season with pepper and salt, and serve the fish on a very hot dish with the sauce poured over.

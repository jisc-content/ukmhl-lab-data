Mix smoothly with a table- spoonful of flour, and add one teaspoonful of chopped parsley, half a teaspoonful of powdered thyme, and a little pepper and salt. Stir the mix- ture over the fire for five minutes, add a glassful of Marsala, and put into the sauce the half-fried fillets. Let them simmer gently for ten minutes.

Fillets of Salmon k la Suede. Remove all bone and skin from a piece of salmon—say a pound—and shape it into little cutlets; flatten them with the cutlet bat, and season with pepper and salt. Take some paper and cut it into neat square pieces, butter each paper well, then lay on each a fillet of salmon, on which pour a dessertspoonful of clear melted butter. Put a tablespoonful of tomato sauce with a few drops of mushroom ketchup added to it over the fillets, and fold the fillets neatly with the papers, and put them in a greased tin in the oven for ten minutes ; then dish them up in their paper cases in a circle,’ and garnish with slices of cucumber and sprigs of tarragon and chervil, placed in little bunches at equal distances. A trellis-work of strips of beet- root can be placed as an outer garnish on the border of the dish.

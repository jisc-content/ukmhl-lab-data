22 SOUPS A LA MODE. Mock Turtle Soup. Potage Fausse Tortue a la Metropole. Take half a calfâ€™s-head, wash and bone it. Tie the meat in a cloth, and chop the bones. Place bones, meat, and four quarts of cold water into a stewpan, put it on the fire, add a little salt, and let it boil up, and skim well. Let it boil for three hours, strain into a basin to get cold, when the fat must be very carefully removed. Melt three ounces of butter in a stewpan, and put in one carrot, one turnip, one onion, half a head of celery, one bouquet garni, twenty peppercorns, four cloves cleaned and cut up very small; cut four ounces of lean ham into dice, and put it in with the vegetables and fry for ten minutes ; add three ounces of flour and stir well. The stock must now be poured in and stirred till it boils, when the pan must be moved to the side of the fire and allowed to simmer for ten minutes. Add two glasses of sherry, the juice of half a lemon, a little cayenne and salt, and strain the soup into another stewpan. Cut some of the calfs-head into small neat pieces and serve it in the soup.

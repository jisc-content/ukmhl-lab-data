PREFACE. »o« My former books, Savouries a la mode and Entries a la mode> having met with such a kindly recep- tion from the public and the press, I am en- couraged to offer this little work dealing with Soups and Dressed Fish, hoping that it may meet with the success of its predecessors. I fear that I cannot say, as in my former pre- faces, that ‘ many of the recipes are original ’ ; but, nevertheless, I trust that the result will prove to be such a bouquet garni as will please the palates of the greatest connoisseurs. HARRIET I)E SALTS.

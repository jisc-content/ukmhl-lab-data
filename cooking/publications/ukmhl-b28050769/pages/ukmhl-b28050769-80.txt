DRESSED FISH A LA MODE. 68 gill of cream, then strain it. Arrange the fillets in a circle, mask them well with the sauce, and sprinkle lobster coral, dried parsley, truffles, and grated hard-boiled eggs over alternately. Serve lobster quenelles in the centre. This dish can be made with oysters instead of lobster, or with prawns or mushrooms; also with tomatoes and shalots for the stuffing and mush- rooms in the centre. The panada is made thus. Take half a pound of lobster, six ounces of panada, two ounces of butter, a tiny dust of cayenne, a spoonful of white sauce. Pound the lobster and panada separately, and then work them to a smooth paste together in the mortar ; add seasoning to taste, and two eggs by degrees. When mixed pass through sieve. Panada is made by soaking breadcrumbs in stock with pepper, salt, and a little butter, and boiling it in a saucepan till it is well cooked and leaves the side of the pan. Sole a la Portugaise. Skin a large sole. Make an incision sufficiently large to admit of the stuffing, put an ounce of butter on a plate, add a shalot, half a teaspoonful of finely-chopped parsley, and half a teaspoonful of anchovy sauce ; put this stuffing into the fish, and put it on a buttered dish. Peel and slice a Spanish onion and four tomatoes very fine, and lay the mixture over the sole alternately. Sprinkle over some salt and pepper, about one ounce of butter and about half an ounce of brown breadcrumbs in which some grated Parmesan cheese has been mixed. Pour round the sole three tablcspoonfuls of tomato sauce,

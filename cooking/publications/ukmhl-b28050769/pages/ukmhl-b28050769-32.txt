SOUPS A LA MODE. 20 it to the saucepan with two quarts of stock, two turnips, two carrots, one onion, three sticks of celery all cut small, and a small bunch of savoury herbs. Simmer slowly for an hour and a half; then take out the herbs, add a tablespoonful of mushroom ketchup or Old English sauce, and a very little salt and pepper, and thicken the soup with a lump of butter rolled in flour. Lobster Bisque. Bisque de Homard. Take the pithy part, the coral and the spawn from two hen lobsters. Pound a small quantity of the coral and spawn in a mortar with a piece of butter the size of a walnut and an anchovy, add a very little cayenne, rub through a sieve and keep it in a cool place till wanted ; cut the meat into small pieces and fry it in a little butter with a carrot and a head of celery, cut it into very small pieces ; add to this a sprig of thyme, a quarter of a blade of mace, and a very little pepper and salt. Fry this for five minutes, taking care that it docs not burn, and if necessary mois- tening it with a little Rhenish wine â€”it will take about half a pint. Pour any of the wine that may have been used in the frying into the stewpan, into which the mixture must now be put. Let it boil quickly for twenty minutes, stirring all the time. Then strain the lobster through a sieve after pound- ing it in the mortar; replace it into stewpan with the coral and spawn (which was put aside) with the liquor in which it was boiled, add a pint and a half of good white stock, rub the puree through a tammy into a basin till wanted.

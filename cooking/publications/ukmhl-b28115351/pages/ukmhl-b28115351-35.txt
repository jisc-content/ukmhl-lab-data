QJJegtnnmg unf# ff)e <&qq 19 White pepper. Six slices of buttered toast spread with anchovy paste. Melt the butter in the blazer, stir in the flour, and as soon as it bubbles add the milk. Stir until you have a smooth white sauce, and then turn in the eggs beaten light. Season, and stir constantly until you have a thick yellow sauce that will almost stand alone. Heap this on the anchovy toast and serve at once. If you wish to do all the preparation on the chafing-dish, you can heat one or two tablespoonfuls of butter in the blaz- er, and when it is very hot fry in it thin slices of bread from which the crust has been trimmed. These may be spread with the paste and kept warm between two heated plates, or over hot water while you cook the eggs.

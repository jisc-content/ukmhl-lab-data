CHAPTER X THE CHAFING-DISH MENU A fault into which over-ambitious house- keepers are prone to fall is that of mak- ing the chafing-dish an adjunct instead of the central figure of the meal named in its honor. When one is bidden to an alleged chafing-dish tea, and finds there bouillon, croquettes, pates, or other entrees, salads, cliauds-froids, sweets, ices, wines, etc., he is impressed with the fact that the chafing-dish makes but a poor showing even when it is used to prepare some such delectable dainty as lobster a la Newburg, or sweetbreads and mush- rooms.

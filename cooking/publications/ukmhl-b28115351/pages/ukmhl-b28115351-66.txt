Lay the bacon in the blazer, and let the fat fry out of it. Draw it then to the side of the blazer, lay in the clams, and cook, turning them until brown on both sides. Nearly all the recipes supplied for oys- ters may be used for cooking clams. FRIED SCALLOPS. One pint scallops. Three tablespoonfuls butter. Pour boiling water on the scallops, and leave them in this five minutes. Drain and dry them. Sprinkle with pepper and salt, roll them in flour, and fry them in the blazer in the butter.

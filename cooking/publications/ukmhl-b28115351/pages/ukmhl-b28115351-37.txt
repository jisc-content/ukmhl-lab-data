Three tablespoonfuls of butter. Half teaspoonful vinegar. Salt and pepper to taste. Three or four eggs, according to the size of the chafing-dish. Melt the butter, cook in the blazer un- til it is a dark brown â€” almost black. Break in the eggs then, one at a time, and carefully, that they may not run together. Baste them with the butter until they are done, adding the vinegar just before taking them up, and sprinkle them with the salt and pepper.

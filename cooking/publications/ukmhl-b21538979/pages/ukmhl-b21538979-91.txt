Biscuit Book 79 Set the cake to rise in a warm place. When risen bake in a moderately quick oven. Cover the cake with a piece of brown paper to prevent burning. Brioche 1 lb. flour 1 lb. butter 7 eggs 2 spoonfuls yeast 1 spoonful sugar Salt Set a quarter of a pound of flour, with the yeast dissolved in a very little hot water, to rise for half an hour in a covered basin in a warm place. Rub the butter into the rest of the flour, with which the sugar and a little salt has been mixed. Beat the eggs well. Mix them with the butter and flour and beat until light and creamy. Add this mixture to the flour and yeast and mix lightly but well. Let the whole rise for eight hours. Fill a buttered mould, or form into small loaves and place on a greased tin. Bake in a moderate oven for about an hour.

28 General Directions The tins for these cakes should be about 8 inches in diameter with a very shallow rim. They should be kept perfectly clean, and before being used should be slightly warmed and well greased with butter, lard or good sweet oil. Three layers are sufficient for a cake. They should not be thick. Cool each layer when baked on a perfectly flat surface and spread with the filling when cold.

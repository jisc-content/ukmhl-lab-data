84 General Directions Fried cakes are best cooked in a mixture of lard and clarified beef-dripping which has not been used before. It should be made very hot, and be quite still. Test it by throwing in a small piece of the mixture. If it rises at once, swells, and begins to brown on the under side, the temperature is right for frying. Doughnuts should take from 8 to 10 minutes to fry, and should be a golden brown when finished. Directly they are ready, take them out, allowing all the fat to drip off, and putting them on soft brown paper to drain.

Biscuit Book E 65 Plain Icing Whites of 2 eggs | lb. icing sugar Flavouring, lemon, vanilla, or almond, etc. Break the whites into a good sized dish. Add two heaping table-spoons of sugar and stir it in steadily. Beat for a few minutes. Add the sugar gradually, beating well. The making should take about half-an-hour. When thick enough it should not run together again after being cut with a knife. If flavoured with lemon juice, a little more sugar should be added or the icing will not be stiff enough. Pour the icing on to the cake by large spoon- fuls and allow it to settle itself as much as possible When using a knife, dip it first in cold water. Ice a cake two or three hours before it is to be eaten. It can be set to harden in a moderate oven for five minutes if needed quickly : but it is best to dry it slowly in a warm, sunny place.

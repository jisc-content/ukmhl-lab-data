Meals. 252 This description would be hardly worth quot- ing, if it were not for the source whence it comes, and the names which it presents in common with the “ Form of Cury” and other ancient relics. Chaucer’s Cook was a per- sonage of unusually wide experience, having, in his capacity as the keeper of an eating- house, to cater for so many customers of vary- ing tastes and resources. In the time of Elizabeth, the price at an ordinary for a dinner seems to have been six- pence. It subsequently rose to eightpence; md in the time of George I. the “Vade Mecum for Malt Worms (1720)” speaks of the landlord of The Bell, in Carter Lane, raising his tariff to tenpence. In comparison with the cost of a similar meal at present, all these quotations strike one as high, when the different value of money is considered. But in 1720, at all events, the customer ate at his own discretion. Their vicinity to East Cheap, the great centre of early taverns and cook’s-shops, ob- tained for Pudding Lane and Pie Corner those savoury designations.

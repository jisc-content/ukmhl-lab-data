ROYAL FEASTS AND SAVAGE POMP. IN Rose’s “School of Instructions for the Officers of the Mouth,” 1682, the staff of a great French establishment is de- scribed as a Master of the Household, a Master Carver, a Master Butler, a Master Confectioner, a Master Cook, and a Master Pastryman. The author, who was himself one of the cooks in our royal kitchen, tells Sir Stephen Fox, to whom he dedicates his book, that he had entered on it after he had completed one of a very different nature : “ The Theatre of the World, or a Prospect of Human Misery.”

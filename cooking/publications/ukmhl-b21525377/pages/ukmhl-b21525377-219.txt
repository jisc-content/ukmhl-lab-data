The Kitchen. 211 A manufactory of brass cooking utensils was established at Wandsworth in or be- fore Aubrey’s time by Dutchmen, who kept the art secret. Lysons states that the place where the industry was carried on bore the name of the “ Frying Pan Houses.”* In the North of England, the bake-stoiic, originally of the material to which it owed its name, but at a very early date constructed of iron, with the old appellations retained as usual, was the universal machinery for baking, and was placed on the Branderi, an iron frame which was fixed on the top of the fire- place, and consisted of iron bars, with a sliding or slott bar, to shift according to the circumstances. The tripod which held the cooking-vessel over the wood flame, among the former inhabitants of Britain, has not been en- tirely effaced. It is yet to be seen here and there in out-of-the-way corners and places; and in India they use one constructed of clay,^ and differently contrived.

Etiquette of the Table. 257 admonition, speak also to an advance in politeness and delicacy at table. There must be a beginning somewhere; and the authors of these guides to deportment had imbibed the feeling for something higher and better, before they undertook to communicate their views to the young generation. There is no doubt that the “ Babies’ Book” and its existing congeners are the successors of anterior and still more imperfect attempts to introduce at table some degree of clean- liness and decency. When the “Babies’ Book” made its appearance, the progress in this direction must have been immense. But the observance of such niceties was of course at fiist exceptional j and the ideas which we see here embodied were very sparingly carried into practice outside the verge of the Court itself and the homes of a few of the aristocracy.

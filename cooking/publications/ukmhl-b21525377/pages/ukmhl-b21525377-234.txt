The Kitchen. 226 fine wine glasses, soap, fine salt, and candles. The list is the next best thing to an auc- tioneer’s inventory of an Elizabethan kitchen, to the fittings of Shakespeare’s, or rather of his father’s. A good idea of the character and resources of a nobleman’s or wealthy gentleman’s kitchen at the end of the six- teenth and commencement of the seven- teenth century may be formed from the Fairfax inventories (1594-1624), lately edited by Mr. Peacock. I propose to annex a cata- logue of the utensils which there present themselves:— The furnace pan for beef. The beef kettle. Great and small ket- tles. Brass kettles, hold- ing from sixteen to twenty gallons each,. Little kettles with bowed or carved handles. Copper pans with ears. Great brass pots. Dripping-pans. An iron peel or bak- ing shovel. A brazen mortar and a pestle. Gridirons. Iron ladles. A laten scummer A grater. A pepper mill. A mustard-quem. Boards. A salt-box. An iron range. Iron racks.

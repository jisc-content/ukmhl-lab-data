Introductory. 15 selves as “ Hommes de Bouche.” The twelfth edition lies before me, a thick octavo volume, dated 1805. The title-page is succeeded by an anonymous address to the reader, at the foot of which occurs a peremptory warning to pilferers of dishes or parts thereof; in other words, to piratical invaders of the copyright of Monsieur Barba. There is a preface equally unclaimed by signatures or initials, but as it is in the singular number the two homtnes de bouche can scarcely have written it; perchance it was M. Barba aforesaid, lord- proprietor of these not-to-be-touched trea- sures ; but anyhow the writer had a very solemn feeling of the debt which he had conferred on society by making the contents public for the twelfth time, and he con- cludes with a mixture of sentiments, which it is very difficult to define : “ Dans la paix de ma conscience, non moms que dans Tor- gueil d’avoir si honorablement rempli cette importante mission, je m’ecrierai avec le poete des gourmands et des amoureux : “ Exegi monumentum sere perennius Non omnis moriar.”

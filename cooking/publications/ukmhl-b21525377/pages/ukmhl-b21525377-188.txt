In the preface the author apprises us that a long residence abroad had enabled her to become a mistress of the details of foreign Euro- pean cookery; but she adds : “ The rnulakatanies and curries of India; the sweet pillaus, yahourt, and cold soups of Persia; the cubbubs, sweet yaughs and sherbets of Egypt; the cold soups and mixed meats of Russia, the cuscus- sous and honeyed paste of Africa, have been inserted with the view of intro- ducing a less expensive and more wholesome and a more delicate mode of cookery.” 38.

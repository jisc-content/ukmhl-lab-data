Diet of the Yeoman 182 The kettle which is mentioned, as we ob- serve, in the tale of “ Tom Thumb,” was the universal vessel for boiling purposes,”* and the bacon-house (or larder), so called from the preponderance of that sort of store over the rest, was the warehouse for the winter stock of provisions, f The fondness for condiments, especially garlic and pepper, among the higher orders, possibly served to render the coarser nourishment of the poor more savoury and flavorous. “It is interesting to remark,” says Mr. Wright,| “that the articles just mentioned (bread, butter, and cheese) have preserved their Anglo-Saxon names to the present time, while all kinds of meat—beef, veal, mutton, pork, even bacon—have retained only the names given to them by the Nor- mans ; which seems to imply that flesh-meat was not in general use for food among the lower classes of society.” In Malory’s compilation on the adventures • An inverted kettle was the earliest type of the diving-bell. t What is called in some places the keeping-room also accom- modated flitches on the walls, and hams ranged along the beams overhead; and it served at the same time for a best parlour.

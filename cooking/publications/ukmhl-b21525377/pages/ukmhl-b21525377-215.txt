The Kitchen. 2oy the comparatively limited information which we get upon this subject from the pages of Lacroix, the paucity of material is not con- fined to ourselves. The destruction and disappearance of such humble monuments of the civilisation of the past are easily ex- plained ; and the survival of a slender salvage is to be treated as a circumstance not less remarkable than fortunate. It seems that the practice was to cut up, if not to slaughter, the animals used for food in the kitchen, and to prepare the whole carcase, some parts in one way and some in another. We incidentally collect from an ancient tale that the hearts of swine were much prized as dainties. Besides a general notion of the appoint- ments of the cooking department, we are enabled to form some conception of the aspect of the early kitchen itself from ex- tant representations in the “Archaeological Album," the “Penny Magazine” for 1836, and Lacroix,* The last-named authority • * Moeurs, Usages et Costumes au Moyen Age " l«6, 170, 177. ■’ ® • 1872, pp

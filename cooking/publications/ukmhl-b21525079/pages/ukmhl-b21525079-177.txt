Cookery Books. 169 labours to her countrywomen and the un- worthier Southrons alike. I imagine, however, that of all the latter- day master-cooks, Alexis Soyer is most re- membered. His “Gastronomic Regenera- tor,” a large and handsome octavo volume of between 700 and 800 pages, published in 1846, lies before me. It has portraits of the compiler and his wife, and many other illustrations, and is dedicated to a Royal Duke. It was produced under the most influential patronage and pressure, for Soyer was overwhelmed with engage- ments, and had scruples against appear- ance in print. He tells us that in some library, to which he gained access, he once found among the works of Shakespeare and other chefs in a different department, a volume with the words “ Nineteenth Edition ” upon it, and when he opened it, he saw to his great horror “ A receipt for Ox-tail Soup !” Why this revelation exercised such a terrify- ing effect he proceeds to explain. It was the incongruity of a cookery book m the temple of the Muses. But nevertheless.

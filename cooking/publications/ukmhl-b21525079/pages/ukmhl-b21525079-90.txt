Cookery Books. 82 This completes the list of books, so far as they have fallen in my way, or been pointed out by the kindness of friends, down to the middle of the last century. It was probably Charles, Duke of Bolton (1698-1722), who was at one time Lord- Lieutenant of Ireland, and who in the begin- ning of his ducal career, at all events, re- sided in St. James’s Street, that possessed successively as head-cooks John Nott and John Middleton. To each of these artists we owe a volume of considerable pretensions, and the “ Cook’s and Confectioner’s Diction- ary,” 1723, by the former, is positively a very entertaining and cyclopedic publication. Nott inscribes his book “To all Good House- wives,” and declares that he placed an Intro- duction before it merely because fashion had made it as strange for a book to appear with- out one as for a man to be seen in church without a neckcloth or a lady without a hoop- petticoat. He congratulates himself and his readers on living in a land flowing with milk and honey, quotes the saw about God send- ing meat and somebody else sending cooks.

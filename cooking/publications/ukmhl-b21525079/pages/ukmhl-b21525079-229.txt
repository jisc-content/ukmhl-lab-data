221 The Kitchen. speaking of the passion of people for raising themselves above their extraction, the writer, a little farther on, observes : “For the yeo- man’s son, as I said before, leaving gee haigh! for, Butler, some more fair trenchers to the table ! bringeth these ensuing ulcers amongst the members of the common body.” The employment of trenchers, which origin- ated in the manner which I have shown, intro- duced the custom of the distribution at table of the two sexes, and the fashion of placing a lady and gentleman alternately.

It, was a token of attachment and a tender recollection of unreturnable youth.

Early Receipts. 143 days, shifting them once a day; then make a pickle (but do not boil it at all) of some white-wine, some white-wine vinegar, escha- lot, horse-radish, pepper, salt, cloves, and mace whole, and nutmeg quartered; then put in your seeds and stop them close; they are to be eaten as capers. To keep Quinces in Pickle:—Cut five or six quinces all to pieces, and put them in an earthen pot or pan, with a gallon of water and two pounds of honey; mix all these to- gether well, and then put them in a kettle to boil leisurely half an hour, and then strain your liquor into that earthen pot, and when ’tis cold, wipe your quinces clean, and put them into it: they must be covered very close, and they will keep all the year. To pickle Ashen keys:—Take ashen-keys as young as you can get them, and put them in a pot with salt and water; then take green whey, when ’tis hot, and pour over them ; let them stand till they are cold before you cover them, so let them stand ; when you use them, boil them in fair water; when they are tender take them out, and put them in salt and water.

205 Meats and Drinks. went many vicissitudes, and it was long before our ancestors conquered their dislike to the bitter hop, after having been accus- tomed to a thick, sweet liquor of which the modern Kentish ale is in some measure a survival. Beer was made from a variety of grain; oats were most commonly employed. In France, they resorted even to vetches, lentils, rye, and darnel. But as a rule it was a poor, thin drink which resulted from the operation, and the monks of Glastonbury deemed themselves fortunate in being allowed by their abbot to put a load of oats into the vat to improve the quality of the beverage; which may account for Peter of Blois charac- terising the ale in use at Court in his day (he died about the end of the twelfth century) as potent—it was by contrast so. The first assize of ale seems not to have been enacted till the reign of Henry III. From a glossary of the fourteenth century, inserted in “ Reliquse Antique,” 1841, it ap- pears that whey was then used as a drink ; it occurs there as “cerum, i, quidam liquor, whey.”

Early Receipts. 131 A French Cake to eat hot:—Take a dozen of eggs, and a quart of cream, and as much flour as will make it into a thick batter ; put to it a pound of melted butter, half a pint of sack, one nutmeg grated, mix it well, and let it stand three or four hours ; then bake it in a quick oven, and when you take it out, split it in two, and pour a pound of butter on it melted with rose-water; cover it with the other half, and serve it up hot. To make the thin Dutch Bisket:—Take five pounds of flour, and two ounces of carraway- seeds, half a pound of sugar, and something more than a pint of milk.

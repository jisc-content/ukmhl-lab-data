the new guide for hotels, etc. Olives Farcies en Thuile et Truffles. (Stuffed Olives and Truffles.) Ingredients: Bordeaux anchovies, olives, truffles, oil of the purest, pepper, cayenne, salt, lemon. Take out the olives, wash and dry them. Of course I am alluding to the plain pickled olive. Take six of them, with a vegetable cutter remove the centre—and fill with the fol- lowing forcemeat, pounded in a mortar—3 anchovies, the grated rind of a lemon, a little of the fish oil, cayenne and black pepper. Pack it firmly into the olives, and then with a sharp knife slice. Lay these in alternate layers on an elegant plate, or glass dish, with sliced truffles and pickled eggs—pour over a little oil, season the truffles with salt, and only a little, and you will have one of the C/ie/s d' CEuvres of Paris. Mais Vert. No. i. (Green Maize.) This is one of the dishes I should above all like to see more popular in this country. The black Mexican sugar maize and the red Narragansett sugar maize are easily grown, and the gj^een ears are cooked in boiling water and salt, as we would prepare any other green vegetable. Cut the cobs in half or in four. Prepare a fine thick gravy, rich and brown ; season with pepper, salt, and a dust of cayenne; lay each quarter or half cob on toast. Pour the gravy over, and serve hot. Mais Vert, No. 2. Plain boil the cobs as above; quarter or halve according to size; lay on toast; cover with fine white sauce, and serve.

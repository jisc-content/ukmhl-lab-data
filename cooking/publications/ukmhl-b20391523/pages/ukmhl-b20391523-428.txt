424 THE NEW GUIDE FOR HOTELS, ETC. Italian Potted Birds. Cook the birds either by braising or roasting. Let them get quite cold, and it must be remembered that they are properly dressed and trussed before cooking. Put into a clean saucepan sufficient oil to cover the birds, add salt to it, and spice it with whole spices, nutmeg, cloves, cardamum seeds, long peppers, &c. Let it stew slowly at low tempera- ature for half an hour. Place the birds in the oil and keep at the same heat, from 90° to 100^ F. for an hour. Then put the birds in jars. Boil up the oil, but do not destroy the colour. When it ceases to make a noise lift it off the fire, let it cool down. Pour over the birds and tie down. They keep longer in oil than in butter without growing rank. To Cure Rank Taste in Potted Birds. Put the pot containing the bird in the oven, put a muslin bag containing charcoal in with the bird. Let the butter slowly warm up to boiling point, and then stand 20 minutes at a lower degree of temperature. Lift out the charcoal bag—dish the bird, and serve hot or cold. It will be perfectly sweet. For ragouts, salmi, stews, hashes, pies, &c., of game, charcoal can be employed to render them less highly pro- nounced to the noses or tastes of the household.

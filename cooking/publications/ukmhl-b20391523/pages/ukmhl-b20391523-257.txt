HOTEL AND RESTAURANT COOKERY. ^53 Stock, French roll, stale; tongue, chicken, herbs, truffles, &c., for forcemeat, baked flour, endive, watercress, spices, pepper, red and white, nutmeg, bread crumbs, glaze, cream. 1st. Cut or carve with a penknife a crown with a Maltese cross on the top, using stale French roll, or Vienna bread for the purpose. Cut also 8 or 10 rings of bread the thick- ness of two penny pieces laid one on the other, and about 2 inches in diameter. Cut a square hole in the centre, and a piece off the bottom of each ring that it may stand up—also 6 or 8 strips of bread that will join the two rings when cooked, and make them look like carriage wheels.—• The centre of the rings of bread should be large enough to let the strips pass through. Fry all these in very hot fat till they are quite a chestnut brown—drain and stand up- right, so that they may keep crisp. 2nd. Take of fillet of veal (or beefsteak) sufficient to make 5, 7, or 9 rolls, (like Olives,) according to the number of guests to provide for. Let each roll be 3^ to 4 inches long, and 2J to 3 inches wide. Mix in a mortar the yolks of the 2 hard boiled eggs, with pepper, salt, a little Basil, moisten with raw egg, and spread the paste over the inside of the meat. Then roll it up olive fashion somewhat, one end being narrower however, so as to shape like a cannon, fasten each with tiny little silver skewerlets. See that the yolk is so disposed, that when trimmed the roll shall show the yellow like bright gun metal inside. If you have no small silver skewers use 3 wooden ones to each roll. Stew carefully in rich brown stock with truffles till quite tender. 3rd. Wash and pick i to f lbs. of red Egyptian lentils. Boil them in good veal, chicken, or other white meat stock, for about an hour. See that there are enough to make a band round the dish about IJ inches wide, round the edge— These are to represent sand. The lentils should be dry, not sloppy or mabhed.

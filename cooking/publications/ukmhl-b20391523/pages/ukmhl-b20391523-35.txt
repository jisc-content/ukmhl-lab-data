31 SWEET WHITE WINE. ries, boiled in 3 pints of water, to which is added 3 lbs. of glucose or honey, and about 2 lbs. of apples, grated without peeling. Let this ferment in a cask open at the top with a tap at the bottom. When the fruit is bruised and put into the cask, a few of the cherry stones ought to be broken and the stalks need not be removed. Put them in first, the juni- per berries and liquor after, and 4 gallons of water that has been boiled and allowed to cool. Ferment with 2 oz. of German yeast, mixed with tepid water and sugar, if you are in a hurry and cannot spare more than 24 hours for the fermen- tation, although the self-fermentation is far superior. Draw off the liquor and put it into a cask with 7 lbs. of sugar. Put in 2 ozs. of soaked and dissolved gelatine, after the cask fer- mentation has subsided, which will be in about 10 days. After the finings are in, bung up, and the wine will be ready in about 3 months. Brandy casks are best for this purpose. Also for the following Sweet White Wine. Take 7 lbs. of whiteheart cherries and 7 lbs. of white cur- rants. Prepare as above using angelica in place of juniper berries. The angelica must be sliced of course. A few hints may not be amiss as to the gathering or buying of the fruits. I purchase my fruit wholesale at Covent Garden, attending at the wholesale hours early in the morning and buying of course at current market prices. I am very careful however about the marketings, and would advise others to take my hints. When fresh fruits are re- quired for wine and liqueur manufacture, I never buy it if Thursday and Friday have been wet days. It is best to buy if possible after a week of continuous sunshine without any showers at least, a state of affairs possible in England although my friend Cordon Bleu often asserts to the contrary.

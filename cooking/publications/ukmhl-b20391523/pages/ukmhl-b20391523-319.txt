HOTEL AND RESTAURANT COOKERY. 315 Cut off the pigeons' feet. Pour boiling water on, then remove the skin from the legs and claws; also the nails; dry them and lay on one side. Dress the birds, draw and quarter. Parboil the livers and use them in making the forcemeat, which should contain, mushrooms, cold minced meat, or fowl; a few sweet herbs, as thyme, parsley, marjoram; lemon rind, spices, and an equal quantity of bread crumbs. Mix with an egg. Beat the steak and dip in the flour. This keeps it juicy. Cut into 2 inch squares, lay it in the bottom of the dish. Lay the force- meat over, then the pigeons, with pieces of hard-boiled eggs quartered, between and fairly distributed through the pie. Place 1 bay-leaf about the centre of the pieces, so that it may be amongst the boiling gravy, and so impart a delicate flavour to the whole. Fill up 2 parts with stock; cover, and orna- ment with flaky paste, No. III., and serve hot or cold, with the little claws sticking through the centre of the crust. Add more hot jelly gravy after it comes out of the oven. Pate de Canard. (Duck Pie. No. i.) Ingredients: Roast Ducks, Forcemeat, Stock from the bones. Roast the ducks, or use the cold roast ducks that have been cut at table. Prepare a truffle forcemeat. When the birds are cold, slice off" the flesh in delicate thin slices, as broad and as long as possible; this is capital carving practice. Lay a strip of forcemeat on each, roll it up and lay them on a plate as they are done, till the case is ready. Boil down the bones with a little stock for jelly, to add to the rolls, the longer the better. Make a pie case as for a Melton pie; lay 2. 1 lb.

94 THE New guide for hotels, etc. paterfamilias finds it takes him all his time, in the great tear and bustle of life, to elbow his way in the crowd of money getters, in order to realize one-fourth the income that his fathers before him were able to procure with half the labour, and when his young sons find that society and masherism,'* occupy the whole of their time in admiring themselves, it is no wonder that they cannot manufacture the punch in the style of their grandfathers, but prefer to buy it ready made, from the wine merchant, the hotel-keeper, and the confec- tioner. And who could desire finer drinks than the speci- mens of milk punch, rum punch, and the dozens of other kinds one meets with at our own Brewers' Exhibition. I will endeavour to give a few which may be found useful. Mixing: Stand the punch bowl in rough ice; drop the lemon essence on the sugar; crush the sugar in a mortar; add the lime juice syrup and the maraschino; then the old Tom. Stir it up well from the moment that the lime juice is added. Let it rest on the ice until you are just going to serve, then add 2 bottles of iced lemonade. Gin Punch, Good Old Tom, Maraschino Lime Fruit Syrup, Sugar, Lemonade, Rough Ice, Lemon Essence, 1 Pint. \ Pint. 1 Small Bar Glass. 2 ozs. 2 Bottles. 6 Drops. Gin Punch a la Masher. 1 WINE glassful of Gin Bar Punch; 2 rings of orange or lemon ; a tablespoonful of raspberry syrup. Fill the tumbler with shaved ice, and serve.

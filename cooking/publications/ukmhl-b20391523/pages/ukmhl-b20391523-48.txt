Cork up and rock daily for the first week, then add to it the plain spirit, 2 oz. of strong fluid ammonia for every 3 gallons of plain spirit, also 1 oz. of tincture of chillies for the same quantity, and 1 oz. (to 10 gallons) of spirit essence of bitter almonds. Filter and strain in the valerien, tea,

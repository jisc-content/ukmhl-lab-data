418 THE NEW GUIDE FOR HOTELS, ETC. is for a diet, the principle of which is the administration of those elements which are disposed of in the stomach, and do not require the aid of the intestines in their digestion/* Dried Meat Fibrine. This meat fibrine is constantly used in our kitchens. The meat is cut into long thin strips, dipped in flour and then gradually dried. Some run wires through them. I prefer to attach them to clips fastened to a wire extending between two supports. These clips are cheap enough, they may be had of steel. The stationers use them for hanging up papers and cards in their windows. In the drying pro- cess the only losses are clear water vapour, and a certain amount of the stimulant spirit of beef, which so largely per- vades fresh beef and blood. When the slices of beef are as dry as it is possible to be, they are ground in fine steel mills, roughly at first, and again through a finer mill. The powder thus obtained is then bolted or sifted through muslin. Thin stock for brown soups is much enriched by a tablespoonful of this being stirred, say into 1^- pints. In a minute it is endued with body and flavour. The feeding or nutritive properties of beef-teas and soups so treated are 100 per cent, over that of the ordinary makes, where fibrine is not present. A beast's melt and liver, spiced, dried and ground, makes a splendid nutritive, and unsurpassed adjunct to high class gravies. It is common enough to have this in bulk, but try it in the more refined form of powder, and it will be a great and marvellously good addition to the kitchen stores.

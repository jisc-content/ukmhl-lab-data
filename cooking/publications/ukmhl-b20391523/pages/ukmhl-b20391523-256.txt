Ingredients: Spring chicken, truffles, (or button mush- rooms,) cerealine, marjoram, basil, chervil, brown stock, milk, cream, pepper, salt, primroses, flour, bay leaves. Cut a tender chicken into neat joints; dip into well seasoned flour, and fry a delicate brown. Stew slowly in well flavoured brown stock, with herbs,â€”marjoram, basil, chervil, and a bay leaf. Also a few button mushrooms. The herbs should be formed into a bunch and tied round. Skim the fat off carefully from time to time. Prepare the cerealine (a kind of prepared wliile corn used instead of rice,) say 2 ozs. Put the cerealine into a sauce- pan, pour boiling milk on it, and commence to stir. Do not make it too moist. Three minutes boiling will suffice to cook it. Lift it off the fire, season with pepper (white) and salt, and add a tablespoonful of cream. Put this round the entree dish, smooth with a knife dipped in hot water. Lay the slices of fowl in the centre, pour the rich brown gravy over, arrange mushrooms amongst the pieces on the top. Put a few primroses round the dish, and serve hot. The Lord Wolsely of Cairo Entree. Invented by Corden Bleu. Named after and dedicated to The Brave General by his Lordship's special per- mission.

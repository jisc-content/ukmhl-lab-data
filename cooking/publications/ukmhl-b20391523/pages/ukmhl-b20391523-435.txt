HOTEL AND RESTAURANT COOKERY. 431 Sugar, To taste. Arrowroot and Burnt Brandy. Prepare the quantities as above, but mix the arrowroot with cold water, reserving the brandy till after the arrowroot is made into starch by the addition of the boiling water. Burn the brandy by setting fire to it, and whilst alight, stir or beat it into the arrowroot. This is also used in cases of dysentry, and frequently double the quantity of brandy is ordered if the case is severe. My practical experience is that rice starch, or corn flour, made from rice is better for such cases, as the rice is not so pure a starch as the arrowroot. Moisten the corn flour with 1 tablespoonful of cold milk, add the yolks of the eggs, put the rest of the milk in a clean saucepan, let it come to the boil, sweeten and stir in the egg and corn flour mixture rapidly. It is best to lift the pan off the fire, if it is an amateur who is working. Work it round with the wooden spoon till they are thoroughly mixed, now, —still stirring,—return to the fire for a minute or two just to cook the corn flour. Have a mould wetted and drained, pour in the jelly, and when cold, turn out and serve. If brandy or wine is added, use less milk, and beat it in after the jelly is taken off the fire, otherwise the spirit, or strength evaporates, by reason of the great heat, and may as well be left out alto- gether, if it is suffered to boil with the corn flour mixture. If flavourings are permitted, essence of lemon, or essence of noyeau, may be added, or a couple of peach leaves, a young Corn Fiour and Egg Jelly. Corn Flour, Yolks of Eggs, Milk, 1 Tablespoonful. 2.

Hors d' (Euvres are also called in France, Mels, or little dishes, because they are served directly after the soup, and used in high class French Hotels, and houses, to ornament the table between the first and second service. They are placed in the most elegant and gracefully embellished, hatteaux deporcelaine, called Hors d' CEiwreSy varying in colour and contour according to their contents. In the Parisian kitchens, we divide Hor''s d^ceuvreSy into 2 classes, viz. Animal and Vegetable. At English tables as a general rule, we find only oysters, devilled sardines, anchovies, in about 3 styles. White bait, and a limited selection of little dishes. A French Cy^-?/"includes in his category the following:â€” Broils (as Broiled Bones) Grillades, Devilled Sausage^ Saucisses Chaud, Tongue Broiled, Sanguefoiirrees.

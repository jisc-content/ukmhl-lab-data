HOTEL AND RESTAURANT COOKERY. 453 SO as to cover every portion, decorate with a wall of green peas and with butterflies of lemon, i, e., thin rings of lemon halved and nearly quartered, the apex of the triangles meet- ing and a piece of parsley or watercress put between the two quarter circles to represent the body of the butterfly. Frogs in Brown Sauce. Prepare a brown roux, using baked fawn-coloured flour, brown stock or gravy stock in place of white, adding a glass of red wine. Prepare it exactly as in the above receipt, only making the difference in the flour, stock, and wine, as here noted. Live Frogs to Dress. Put the frogs into a large basin, cover them with a thick towel, take a kettle containing boiling water and inserting the the spout under the towel, pour it as rapidly as you can over them. It is cruel to cut them whilst alive and answers no good purpose, in fact the frogs are more easily dressed and better eating if killed instantaneously by means of boiling water. Leave them for a quarter of an hour, then take them one by one, lay them on the back, make a slight cut down the inner side and crosswise, cutting only the outer skin, you will find practice enable you to become an expert. It is a similar operation to removing the inner skin of a gizzard from a fowl, &c. The sack containing the entrails will be easily lifted out, and the head can then be cut off", leaving the edible portions, viz., hind legs and back free. The cut- ting off" of the head prevents the escape of verdure or digestive juices from the sack. Wash and wipe the hind quarters, dip them in flour and fry in butter, when browned, stew in well ifjavoured stock.

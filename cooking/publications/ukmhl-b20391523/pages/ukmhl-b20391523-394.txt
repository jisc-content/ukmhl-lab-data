Beat the butter to a cream, work in the sugar, then separ- ate the yolks and whites of the eggs and mix the yolks with the sugar and butter. Mix the baking powder with the flour, and gradually work it into the eggs and butter, using water when it becomes necessary. Rub the sultanas in a clean cloth and pick them, have the orange peel minced and mixed into the cake, work it very well, whip the whites of the eggs to a stiff foam, and work gently in the last thing. Paper the tins, put in the cake, only three-parts fill the tins, bake for about 1 hour, turn the cake out of the tins to cool, and stand the cake or cakes on its side. N.B. It is important to notice that all raisins, currants, &c., should be cleaned by whatever process the Chef ox cook uses, the wet or dry, immediately on coming into the stores. The wet process is to wash the currants in sieves, rub them in cloths, pick out the stones, spread them on trays in a cool oven to dry or in front of the fire. The dry is to put the fruit in a sieve, cover with flour and rub them, the dirt and refuse falling through. There are also fruit cleaning machines for large quantities. When these fruits are cleaned a few now and again, it is a waste of time that might be better employed.

264 THE NEW GUIDE FOR HOTELS, ETC. Entree a la Bailey Walker. (Vegetarian Entree.) Ingredients: Potatoes, butter, cream, salsify, salt, white sifted bread crumbs, oil, eggs, parsley, (corn flour and milk, if no cream is obtainable.) Boil salsify root till tender. This can be procured by sending a few stamps to Covent garden, if unobtainable in country towns. Make it into a puree, mix with cream, season, and keep hot. Bake 6 large potatoes, and when done pass the inside through a wire sieve whilst hot into a basin that is standing in hot water. Add butter and seasoning. Whip the potatoes well with a fork to make them white as snow. Add an egg. Then butter little egg cups wel/y line them with the potatoe mixture. Put about a teaspoonful of salsify cream into each cup. Cover with a top of potatoe, brush the top of the cone over with egg—dust it with bread crumbs. Slip the little cone on to a pewter metal fish slice, brush the other part with egg, dust with crumbs, and pop into boiling oil gently so as not to disarrange the shape. Fry a delicate brown—drain on 2 papers. Garnish with parsley fried. Arrange the cones in pyramid fashion, and groups of parsley here and there. The dish and napkin on which the entree is served should both be hot. A very de- licious sauce to accompany this can be made out of Nichols' Food of Health. Directions are given with the food so I need not trespass on other people's preserves. Entree a la Prof. Newman. (The Professor Newman Entree.) Vegetarian Entree.

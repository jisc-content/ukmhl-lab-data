HOTEL AND RESTAURANT COOKERY. 439 Savoury Rusk Pudding. No 3. Put into a basin 2 rusksâ€”tops and bottoms." Pour over them pint of beef-tea, or veal, mutton, or chicken broth, which is just removed from the fire in an actual boiling state. Cover this down with a saucer, and leave it for from 15 to 20 minutes to soak. In the meantime, mince 2 oz. of mutton or veal suet, (beef would be too rich and heavy,) beat it up with the rusks, season, and beat in 2 eggs. Butter a basin, pour in the mixture. Steam for an hour and serve. This nourishing little pudding can be given some five or six days before solid meat food can be attempted in serious cases. If made with milk beef-tea it is of course richer in nutritious matters. Savoury Cerealine Pudding. No i. Stir into boiling beef-tea, or broth, 1 tablespoonful of cerealine, cooked hominy, or shreded maize. (It is known by all these names and more I believe, according to the firm by whom it is issued,) to each i pint of liquor. Let it boil a second, lift it off the fire and beat in an egg, season witli salt, &c., to taste. Bake long enough to set the egg, 7 to 10 minutes, and the pudding is ready. Savoury Cerealine Pudding. No 2. Stir 1 tablespoonful of cerealine into |- pint of boiling milk, add salt and savoury spices, also an egg beaten up. Put into a buttered basin and boil or steam for J to f of an hour. Turn out and serve with beef-tea or gravy, as sauce. N.B. Beef-tea, or milk stock, can be used instead of plain milk, and the addition of cream makes the pudding of course richer for those patients who can take it, but cream is often too rich for very weak digestions.

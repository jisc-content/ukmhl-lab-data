(Gooseberry Gateau,) Ingredients t Green Gooseberries, Spinach Juice, Sugar, Cloves, Coriander Seed, Water, Gelatine, 2 lbs. i Cupful. ^Ib. 6. i Teaspoonful. \ Pint. 1 oz. Pick the gooseberries; put the water, sugar, and spices on to boil, and dissolve the sugar; strain and add the goose- berries, and stew till tender. Keep the fruit as whole as pos- sible ; drain off the liquor; dissolve 1 oz. of soaked gelatine in the liquor, strained off the gooseberries. Add about half a teacupful of spinach juice, spinach leaves well pounded in a mortar and the juice pressed through a sieve, or else pre- pared vegetable green colour. Stir till nearly cold, work in the gooseberries, put into a mould. Let it set on the ice. Turn out as for jelly; serve with cream or custard round. Gateau of Currants^ (red, white, and black,) may be made as above, also, bilberry^ rhubarb, apricotsy &c., may be made as for apple gateau, and served with cream custard, or if for children, thin corn flour and milk sauce, about the consistency of cream. For catering purposes for a large number of young people, the gateau takes the place of more expensive fruit jellies, calves* feet, &c., &c., and milk-cream the place of cream or custard. Freeman*s Custard Powder may be quite safely used for Tarts, &c., and is as cheap and wholesome as corn flour.

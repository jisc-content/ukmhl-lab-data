It is produced from various sources, such as maize, or Indian corn, rice, potatoes, beet root, saw dust, and even cotton rags have been pressed into the service of spirit making. Spirits of wine and methylated spirit are largely used in the manufacture of brandy, whiskey, and gin without distillation. Plain or silent spirit may be manu- factured from any material containing starchy matter or cellulose convertible into saccharine matter. Its great advantage is that it has a stand point, and does not deteri- orate in any great degree by age or by keeping. It has no particular taste, and readily absorbs flavours imparted to it by essential oils. It varies, however, in its sanitary quali- ties. For instance, potato spirit is one of the most fiery compounds known, while the spirits from rice and maize are considered much milder and more healthful. Beet root spirit too, if carefully manufactured is to be trusted. Every spirit merchant and vendor of spirits, knows that true gin, rum, and brandy, have their peculiar and distinct traits when first manufactured, features which are not added after distillation, but acquired during the process. It is to simulate this for cooking purposes, that the artist in spirits has to aim. For instance, he wishes to make SCOTCH AND IRISH MOUNTAIN DEY^S. Silent or Plain Spirit

302 THE NEW GUIDE FOR HOTELS, ETC. on a bed of fried crumbs, and good brown gravy in a separate boat. They should not be over done but well hasted* Roast Turkey. Roast a hundred chestnuts, divest them of the outer husk and inner skin. Pass them through a wire sieve, and whilst hot beat them up with J lb. of butter or suetine, season with pepper and salt, the juice of a lemon and the grated rind. Stuff the bird, lard the breast and thighs with strips of smoked bacon fat, using a medium needle. Truss the bird and roast it carefully, well basting during the process. Serve with sausages or sausage meat balls which are more delicate round as a decoration. To make the balls, roll the sausage meat into balls as large as a horse chestnut of fair size, brush with egg, dip in finely sifted white crumbs, and fry in boiling fat, drain and use with pickled barberries by way of decoration. Pickled cherries or cherry plums make a brilliant variation to the ball garnish. White cream, bechamel, or oyster sauce, and good gravy can be served with this. For Ordinary Joints, Spit as close to the bone as possible, and when done, remember the hints relative to gravy given at the beginning of the chapter, so that your patrons may say Bravo! Long live the cook who rules the Roast!!

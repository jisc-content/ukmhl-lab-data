166 THE NEW GUIDE FOR HOTELS, ETC. By the way, there is one more receipt for spruce beer, which I must not omit, and then I will close my remarks on the Heal of all the nations.*'—Spruce, The present receipt was given to me by an English Brewer, for a long time connected with a celebrated firm of brewers, in the Midland Counties. Boil a wort of water, 9 gallons, sugar 28 lbs. Stir the whole time till the sugar is dissolved, and reduce to 7 gallons. Then put into the mash tub 2 pints of spruce chips, cut from the centre of a spruce block. Pour the hot wort on this, cover it up, and let it infuse till it is cold; remove the chips, which can have been put in a long loose net, like a cabbage net, only much finer; then ferment with yeast, draw off—colour with very strong caramel, put into the cask, and it will be ready for drawing in about a month.

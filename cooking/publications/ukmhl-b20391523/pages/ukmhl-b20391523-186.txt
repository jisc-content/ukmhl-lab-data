1'82 THE NEW GUIDE FOR HOTELS, ETC. The C. E. T. S. Cup. Montserrat Pine Apple Cordial, 1 Bottle. Lemon Verbena, 3 Sprays. Lemonade, 3 Bottles. Serve at once after adding the lemonade. Tonic Bitters. Gentian, 2 ozs. Quassia, 2 ozs. Angostura Bark, 2 ozs. Turkey Rhubarb, J oz. Seville Orange Peel, Dried and Ground, 2 ozs. Cloves, Bruised, 2 ozs. Mixing: Put these into a jar with the cloves. Pour on them 2 quarts of boiling water. Cork tightly, and infuse for 14 days; strain and bottle. This is a capital recipe for bit- ters, and it will be remarked that in these Temperance drinks I have refrained from giving any essences, as I might have done to save labour, (see Belle of the Evening Cup, page 180) for instance; all almond, peach, noyeau, and sim- ilar essences contain more or less spirit and I should not be doing my duty to my temperance patrons were I to recom- mend their use in the composition of teetotal drinks. I shall conclude my little treatise with a few simple recipes for drinks in the sick room, and for invalids.

Ingredients: Marrot, salt, trufiies, sauce piquante, lemon, oysters, oil batter, fennel, thick brown wine, and stock sauce, olives. Mayonnaise sauce, lemon. Dress, skin, and soak the marrot in strong salt and water, for 6 hours; change the water and salt, and let it lie another 6 hours; this takes off the fishy taste that clings to seafowl. The sole or reddish brown substance lining the back, must also be removed. Pour boiling water from the neck to the vent, down the inside, so as to pass over the back of the bird. This can soon be removed by scraping it off the bone and rubbing with salt. Truss as for wild duck. Stew with truffles, and serve with rich brown sauce piquante.

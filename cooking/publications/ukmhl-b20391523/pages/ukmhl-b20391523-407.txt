HOTEL AND RESTAURANT COOKERY. 4O3 Green Nectarine Pickle. Green apples, plums, apricots, nectarines, grapes, &c., all come under this head. The blight often seizes on the green fruit and it is simply wasted, when it would make a most delicious pickle, or mock olives in some cases. The latter do very well for salads and farcee for stews, ragouts, &c., where the olive is mixed with other foods. To Pickle. Lay the fruit after it is carefully wiped, in a strong pickle, thus,—put a thin layer of salt on a dish, put a layer of green nectarines (or other green windfalls or thin- ings) and then salt, and so on till the fruit is all laid in, cover with salt, let it remain 4 days, lift out the fruit, drain, dry in the sun and turn frequently for two or three days, then put in jars. Boil sufficient white wine vinegar in a brass pan to cover the fruit,—iron saucepans will not do,—put into the vinegar for each quart, ^ oz. of white sugar, 1 oz. of white ginger, 1 oz. of long peppers, 1 oz. of allspice, 1 oz. of cloves, 6 chillies, 1 shalot. When the vinegar boils, let it continue for 10 minutes to gently simmer, then let it become cold; add l-8th of an ounce (2 drams) of alum to crisp the fruit, dissolve it in the hot vinegar, and when quite cold pour over the fruit. Mock Olives. Take green plums, with a sharp penknife loosen and work out all the stones from the stalk ends. Lay vine leaves, or tansey, in the bottom of a jar, strew fennel seed in amongst the fruit, and plenty of salt, a little powdered alum, and cover with oil, poured on the fruit hot. If you want olives farcee, put a piece of anchovy and sardine alternately in the aperture left by the stone being ex- tracted. Put into the jars just as above after stuffing.

HOTEL AND RESTAURANT COOKERY. 197 CHAPTER II. Cleaning Stoves. /CLEANLINESS is next to Godliness" is, I believe, one \J of your English maxims. Dirt is nof artistic, and a dirty kitchen is one of the greatest abominations under the sun. I am no advocate for overtaxing my subordinates on the staff, but, I insist on the early rising of the scullery men and maids, and the keeping of my stoves well polished. They clean best when cold, and if, before closing for the night, 1 see they are greasy, or any accident of spilling liquids has occurred, one of the maids washes the part with hot water, it dries before the range or stove cools, and it is then ready for the morning polishing. The brighter the grate the more you economize the heat and fuel. The flues too of coal stoves of whatever make or kind, ought to be most thoroughly cleansed, say on a Thursday or Friday; everything in an Hotel must be done systematically, and by rule, and if this is not the case, there is nothing but con- fusion and disorder. I have the Dome Lead used, with a little turpentine, and allow my helps plenty of brushes, cloths, &c. So that there is no excuse for idleness. Davis's brass and metal polish" is one of the best mediums for keeping taps, copper, brass, or steel, in good order. By the way the American *' Soap Stone," I call it, is a most valuable kitchen adjunct. It makes the interior of pots and pans shine like silver, cleans stockpots of copper thoroughly inside and out. Our purveyor sends us two firms' importations, one is *'Feir& American cleansing soap,"â€”the Other ** Pride Qf the kitchen," The former are rather Soap Stone.

HOTEL AND RESTAURANT COOKERY. 443 small dice and mix with the millet, beat in a couple of eggs. Put into it about 3 drops of essence of lemon. Pour into a buttered basin, steam about hours. Serve with milk boil- ed and thickened with corn flour, 1 teaspoonful of corn flour to the gill (J pint) of milk, and sweeten a little. N.B. Millet can be bought at any seed shop, and is ex- tremely cheap and healthful. Rusk Pudding. Break 2 tops and bottoms into rough lumps, and lay them in a pint pie-dish that has been buttered. Throw over them 1 wineglassful of cowslip or marsala wine, and let them stand 10 minutes. Beat up an egg with J pint of milk, sweeten. Pour this over the rusks. Bake from 15 to 20 minutes, and sift sugar over the top and serve. This pud- ding is also nice steamed and served with syrups. Temper- ance houses can replace the wiiie with cherry^ red currant, or other sweet syrup. Lemon will not do as the acid would curdle the custard. Sweet Cerealine Puddings. Cerealine makes good sv/eet puddings, with milk and eggs, either baked or boiled. Its great advantage is that it does not require creeing, but as soon as the boiling milk is poured over it is ready for the egg, sweetening and flavour- ing, and can be either steamed or baked. Like rice it makes a good pudding with milk only, and also shapes, &c., to eat cold with stewed fruits, jams, syrups, &c. It takes from 10 to 15 minutes to bake, and 20 to 30 to steam. Chops and Steaks. When cooking these see that the fire is clear and bright. No smoke or flame especially if grilled over the fire. A little powdered nitre strewn over the fire quickly clears it, or a handful of common salt.

AERATED WATERS. Operandi in these cases is to take a spoonful of white sugar— put it into a tumbler, draw first \ a tumbler of soda water, dissolve the sugar in this. From bottles, add—either, currant, raspberry, bilberry, lemon, strawberry, or any other syrup, shrub, essence or extract that may be required. Some vendors drop a liquid preparation of "Crimson salts'* or cochineal to colour the drink before serving it out, especially when they are using raw lime juice, or strawberry cordial, which is generally pale in colour. The more correct method is to sweeten and colour the acid water. Now draw sufficient of the acid liquid into the tumbler to cause effer- vescence. An Effervescing Fountain Has been introduced for small bars and restaurants. The makers claim that by its use the manufacturer can produce ginger beers, soda waters and lemonades at Id. a dozen ex- clusive of bottles. I have seen it in operation at one of our Brewery Exhibitions, some few years ago, but had not time then to stop and investigate it. For Making Aerated Waters and Fruit Champagnes Many machines are in the market, varying in price from a few pounds, to several hundreds. In a large catering es- tablishment supplying branch houses, it pays as well if not abetter than beer brewing, to manufacture your own aerated waters ; and many large firms throughout the country are doing this—Trade lists and catalogues can easily be had on application to any of the firms advertising in the British and Foreign Confectioner Magazine of 182, Strand, London.

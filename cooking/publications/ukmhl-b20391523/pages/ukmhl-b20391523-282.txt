But in the autumn the rice-bird flies to the South ; he changes his blue coat and dons brown feathers,—alters from the seranading Adonis to the gourmet; flocks with his brethren to the rice-fields of the sunny south and gorges, becomes fat, is captured, killed, dressed, and eaten, as for instance :— Rice Birds a U Ellen Terry. Take the birds after dressing, and stufl" them with a deli- cate forcemeat. Brush them over with egg, dip or dust in finely sifted bread crumbs ; fry in boiling fat. Drain. Take very large potatoes, 1 to each bird, peel them, cut them in half (Scotch Regents are best for this), scoop out the centre in both halves, so as to lay the birds in, brush the 2 halves over with white of egg, lay in a bird ; close the pota- toe; tie round with tape, put it with the others, on a baking tray; baste well with butter or bacon fat; when done, wipe the potatoe dry; they should be of a bright, golden maize colour. Tie them up with a delicate pink satin ribbon. Where the tape marks are, /. once across and once lengthwise, pile on a hot napkin ; garnish with stellaria, or jonquil, and fern ; and serve with white cream sauce. This is a good breakfast, luncheon, or supper dish. Larks can be used, or h quails in- stead of the rice-birds ; even sparrows are not to be despised, and when treated a la Ellen Terry, are as exquisite a breakfast bonne bouche as ever they are when dressed as:— Rice Birds a Irving. Ingredients: Rice-birds, (larks, sparrows, or quails,) oyster, forcemeat, boiled ham, vineleaf, egg, rich brown gravy sauce, red wine. Dress the birds, by skimming, drawing, and trussing.

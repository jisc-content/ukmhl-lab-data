PEEF ACE. jj N bringing this new work before the Trade, we must not n| omit to thank our many friends, the Butlers, Chefs, and ^ Bar-tenders who have given us help both with home and Z foreign work, which has been sur le tapis during the last I few seasons; the more so as we know how loth the representatives of our two professions are to dispense their knowledge, designs, and styles of working to other members of their craft. All the information we asked for has been openly and honourably given, and worth the quid pro quo we gave for it, especially from the Chefs, Butlers, and Mixers of the highest repute. In offering the book, therefore, we can assure the reader that the recipes, which are not of our own actual design, are from men of known ability and position. The genuineness of the recipes and the novelty in the dressings will at once be apparent to the least initiated in the art. For the novice the work will be invaluable, for the old hand it will be what the fashion book is to the modiste. It will show him the newest styles, the newest materials, and the newest wrinkles in the trade. It is the result of many years of practical work and experience in our professions. One of the contributors to the book says, ''Some of the hints are a fortune in themselves,'* as disclosed by Your Obedient Servants, BACCHUS AND CORDON BLEU. London t Sept embers 1885.

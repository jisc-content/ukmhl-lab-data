HOTEL AND RESTAITRANT COOKERY. 32 1 Gateau des Cerise. (Cherry Gateau.) ingredients:— Red Cherries, White Heart Cherries, Bitter Almonds, Sugar, Angelica, Gelatine, Water, 1 oz. i Pint. lib. ilb. 6 Blanched, ilb. 2 Thin Rings. Draw out the stones of the red cherries, and crack one half. Put the cherries, cracked stones, sugar, and J pint of water into a stewing jar. Set it in a pan of water, and cook the cherries till they will make a puree, and the kernels are soft—than pass through a sieve. Soak the gelatine in the other J pint of water; and when the puree is made put it over the fire, melt it, and use some of it to fix the decora- tions of the mould which may stand in cold water, or on ice, if the weather be hot. Blanch the almonds by pouring boiling water over them, and slipping them out of the brown skin Dip them in the glaze. Lift them out with a skewer, and put them in position at the bottom of the mould; so also with the rings of angelica. Stew the white heart cherries gently that whilst tender they will not burst or break.—Dip them also in the gelatine, and fix in the mould. Then stir the rest of the gelatine to the cherry gateau. Stir till nearly on the point of setting, and then pour into the mould. Serve when cold, with whipped cream, or Devon- shire clotted cream.

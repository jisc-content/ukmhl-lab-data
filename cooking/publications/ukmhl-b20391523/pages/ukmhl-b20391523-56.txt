52 THE NEW GUIDE FOR HOTELS, ETC. in this way. Half fill ^ a gallon jar with tansy leaves. It must be remembered if the leaves are fresh, from one-half to two- thirds of the quantity will be sufficient. If dry, the quantity stated. Fill up with gin. Steep for six days. Filter and bottle. Brown Colouring Is a decoction made from brown sugar or caramel. Put 7 lb. of unrefined sugar into an old iron pot or pan. Stir it until it has become a perfectly dark brown. When all the sugar is thoroughly turned, have ready a gallon kettle filled with boiling water.

The chicory imparts no flavour to the colouring. Raspberry Vinegar. No. I.â€”Pick 3 gallons of red or white raspberries in dry weather, place them in a large pickle jar, and pour over 1 gallon of white wine vinegar. Infuse for 3 or 4 days, keep- ing the jar tied down with brown paper; next turn the contents of the jar into a perfectly clean jelly bag, or into a very fine tammy sieve, and let it drip into a clean basin. Carefully measure the liquid which should be clear and bright. Add 1 lb. of lump sugar, or refined pearl sugar to each pint of liquid. Put it into an enamelled pan, and stir with a wooden spatula or silver ladle till the sugar is dis- solved. I always pursue the ' Bcim Marie principle. Care-

Yet strange to say the next brewing is a failure. It is attacked by putrefactive fermentation, and the liquor be- comes foetid. Practical brewers call this state of matters by a very appropriate name, they say the **fox" is in the wort, and so it is. The whole gist of the matter is this, wood is porous and a good absorber, as far as it will absorb, so far the offensive matter penetrates into its pores. No amount of surface cleaning therefore will remove it, and it requires to be thoroughly disinfected, and nothing does this so effectually as placing a saucer containing burning sulphur in the tub making it air-tight with wood or other cover, thoroughly fumigating it, and then filling it with boiling water highly impregnated with salt and soda. It is the oft- repeated tale of "a stitch in time saves nine." These remarks apply to coppers, casks, coolers, stirrers, shovels, &c., used. It is not necessary to enter into any particulars concerning the process of malting, or to refer to the operations of steeping, couching, flooring, or kiln-drying, but you will know if the malt is good by first, its sweet smell; second, the fulness of the grains; third, the crispness of the husk ; and fourth, the sweet taste of the kernel which should be as friable as the curd of which cheese and cheesecakes are made. The hops too require examination. It is a common practice now to send from America, dressed hops, prepared very much on the same principle as that extended to tea damaged by salt water â€”or the re-dressing in the East End of London of old tea leaves, gathered for charitable purposes. To judge if the hops are natural is a very simple matter to the initiated. The flowers should be avoided if they are too brio^ht a green

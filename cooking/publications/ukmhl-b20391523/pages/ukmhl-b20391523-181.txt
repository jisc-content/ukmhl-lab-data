177 TEMPERANCE DRINKS. mixing: Peel off the skin from the apples, and pass them through a wine sieve. Pour on them 1 pint of boiling water, and cover up tight. Let it stand till it is quite cold, this is best made the night before. Stir it up once or twice so that the water may mix freely with the apples. Then put the apple pulp and liquor into a clean cloth, and wring the juice dry from it. The juice should be quite clear, and a dinner napkin without flaws, is the best thing to strain it through. Put this juice into the punch bowl. Add the raspberry cordial. Then the ice, and the bottle of lemonade. This if properly prepared is equal to a champagne cup. Mixing: Put into the punch bowl the cherry cordial, mix in the lemon, and orange flower water. Stand on the ice till it is wanted. Then at the last moment put in the broken ice, and the bottle of seltzer water. Serve at once with a silver ladle for distributing the cup in wine glasses. This is dedicated and invented, with compliments from " Bacchus," to the worthy Chief Templar of England. The Malin*s Champagne Cup. Cherry Cordial, 1 Bottle. Lemon do. 1 Wineglassful.

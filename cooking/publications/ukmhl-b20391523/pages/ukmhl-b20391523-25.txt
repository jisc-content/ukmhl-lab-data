21 THE WINE COUNTRIES. CHAPTER III. The Wine Countries and their Products, &c., &c, THE general British taste for wine is not in favour of pure wines, they like something with a substantial body and plenty of spirit.

I have decided in future to supply consumers direct. Being the proprietor of the Sabat Estate, Gironde, five miles from Bor- deaux, I can offer you my wines in cases of 1 doz. each delivered free of all charges within the London radius,'*

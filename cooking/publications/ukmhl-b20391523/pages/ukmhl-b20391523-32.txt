From a little vent peg or a wooden tap at the bottom of the mash-tub, draw off the liquor very carefully so as not to break the top crust. If there is no tap or peg, you must skim off the crust, but it will give more trouble in fining and settling the fer- mentation than if it were drawn off. To every gallon of liquid add 3 lbs. of brown cane sugar, thoroughly mix this and then put it into the cask, reserving about a gallon to fill up the cask during the after fermentation, which generally continues for 7 or 8 days. Soak 2 oz. of gelatine in some of the liquor and dissolve in a pint of the wine heated. When this is nearly cold, add to the liquor in the barrel, bung down, and the wine will be fit for use in from 3 to 6 months. To give this wine a bouquet for drinking or sale purposes, add one quart of elderflower water (see page 171) and J pint of cherry essence (see page 56 ). Another Port Very much in vogue amongst cooks, is, to take i gallon of elderflower wine and i gallon of strained elderberry juice, the latter is heated to about 170^^ F. You then dissolve in it 2 oz. citric acid crystals, i oz. alum, and ^ oz. red sanders wood. Mix this in 10 gallons of sweet Hereford or Devon- shire cider. Stir in 3 lbs. of sugar, add i pint of rough un- sweetened gin, and 2 oz. of dissolved and whipped gelatine as directed in the foregoing receipt. Bung down and it will be ready for use in about six weeks. A Common White Wine or Sherry Substitute Is made by taking cider as before, say 10 gallons, add to it 4 lbs. of glucose, and 2 gallons of white elderflower wine. Heat the wine and dissolve i lb, of citric acid crystals in it

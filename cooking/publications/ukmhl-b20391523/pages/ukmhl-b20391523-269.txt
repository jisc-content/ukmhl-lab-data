HOTEL AND RESTAURANT COOKERY. 265 crumbs, sweet herbs, baked flour, vegetable stock, eggs, celery, lemon, oil, salt, butter, pop corns ground. Take some good vegetable stock, and stew yellow French lentils until they are tender. Make a puree of them and beat in a little cream, to give them a smooth nice taste. Add an egg also. Spread the panada on a plate to cool. Make a rich veal stuffing of bread crumbs, sifted lemon thyme, marjoram, lemon peel grated, parsley, butter rubbed into the crumbs—moisten with an egg or cream, form into round balls, and then roll out to form a crescent, thin at either end. Cut the panada into crescents of equal size. Lay the forcemeat on one of the half moons, and cover with another, brush over with egg, dip in ground pop corn flour, and fry in oil. Drain and serve, after draining, surround by a thick brown gravy, made of a roux of butter and flour baked a fawn colour in the oven—vegetable stock, and seasonings, such as a flavouring of tarragon vinegar, to give it a piquante flavour. The white pop corn looks novel, and pretty, on the crescents. The centre on which the half moons are arranged, should be of boiled celery covered with white sauce, or artichokes en Pyramid, covered with cream sauce. Entree Napolitain. (Neapolitan Entree.)

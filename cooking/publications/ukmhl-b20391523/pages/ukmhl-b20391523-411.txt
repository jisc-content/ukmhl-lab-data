HOTEL AND RESTAURANT COOKERY. 407 Salad Vinegar. To a gallon of white wine vinegar, put the following ingredients:â€” Bruised Cloves, 2 ozs. Tarragon Leaves, 1 Gill, (i pint.) Measureful. Shalots Peeled and Minced, 2 ozs. Mint and Basil, 2 ozs. each. Knotted Marjoram, 1 oz. Lemon Thyme, 1 oz. do. Rind, 1 oz. Mustard Seeds, 1 oz. Balm and Syringa, 1 oz. each. Liquid Rennet, 1 Quart, Strong Solution. Sprinkle the salads with this well in the mixing, so that it does not touch the outside vegetables, to make them flabby if the salad has to stand before serving. It is over the meats it should principally go, and shows both a savoir- faire on the part of the cook, whilst it renders the salad both palatable and digestable, by the judicious mixture of flavours, and the introduction of pepsin in the form of calf's rennet, which the medical faculty consider necessary to their many patients suffering from tea or any other dyspepsias. Cayenne Pepper. Put the chillies, say 2 ozs. with 2 ozs. of dried capsicums, into a coffee mill, grind them and bottle for use. If you have a spice mill, so much the better, it is wiser to grind red and black peppers at home, fresh as wanted. There is a large amount of adulteration in peppers, for which the grocers and Italian warehouse men are not responsible.

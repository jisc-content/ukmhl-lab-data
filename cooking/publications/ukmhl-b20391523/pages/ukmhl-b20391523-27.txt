STORAGE OF WINES. 23 wine, the better it is." This is not the case with all wines and is the exception that proves the rule. Hotel Cellars and the Storage of Wines Next demands our attention. If it is difficult to find good ale and beer cellars attached to a house, it is still more difficult to find good wine cellars. I would rather have a house with good cellarage and shabby exterior, than a very palace with cellars where my wines and my credit as a caterer would be ruined. For wine storage there ought really to be two cellars, both dry, airy without being draughty, easily ventilated, and the ventilators readily secured and pro- tected, in cases of severe cold or frost. Cellar, No. 1. should be of moderate temperature never under 50°, never over 56° on the hottest day. This is simply for the storage of wines. Cellar, No. 2, should be for the ripening and bringing for- ward of wines, and should have a temperature from about 65° to 70° regularly maintained. Wines in bulk mature much better, are of richer bouquet, fuller bodied and more delicate in gout, than when matured in bottle. As accidents will happen in the best regulated families it will be as well here to give one or two practical receipts for the manipulation of wines that may have gone wrong, and the preparation of casks for racking. Mustiness in Wine Arises from two causes: fungi in the cask, or the presence of an essential oil generated by damp or decayed fruit used in its preparation. If it is the fault of the cask—prepare another and see that it is chemically sweet. If the least trace of mustiness or disagreeable smell appears, dip some clean white cotton rags in sulphur liquefied, the strips should be about 3 inches wide and J yd. long, fasten them together

402 THE NEW GUIDE FOR HOTELS, ETC. Lemon Pickle. Take say 2 dozen of the fruit, wipe them carefully and examine to see that they are sound, rub them with salt and lay them in a basin and cover them with salt, turn them several times for three or four days, lift the lemons out of the brine and place them on a sieve to dry in the sun for two days, put them into jars after wiping, and as you pack them in, strew the following spices, equally divided, amongst the lemons, viz., bruised white ginger, 2 ozs., white peppers, 2 ozs., chillies, J oz., coriander, J oz., small mustard seeds, J oz., cover with strong white wine vinegar, look at them at the end of each week, for a fortnight or three weeks, and add vinegar for that absorbed by the fruit, and keep closely covered down, ready for use in six weeks, but perfec- tion at the end of six months. To serve with game, cut in half and then"quarter each half. Put a tablespoonful of the liquor in the glass dish. Never return cut lemons to the jar in which the whole fruit is pickled, as it would cloud the white wine vinegar. Orange Pickle. Prepare them exactly as you would the lemons, take 6 St. Michaels and 6 Seville. They must be pickled in separ- ate jars as the colouring from the darker orange would spoil the effect of the bright yellow of the St. Michaels. To serve at table, halve the oranges, and cut each half in four, small oranges with fine skins (like the lemons) are the best for pickling purposes. When lemon and orange pickles are served on the one dish the shading of the colours is very attractive. The juice from the St. Michaels or vinegar from the lemons should be used, as that of the Seville oranges will be found dark and perhaps a trifle clouded. Put no cut fruit into the principal jars. In salads these are most exquisite and recherche.

80 THE NEW GUIDE FOR HOTELS, ETC* Rummage out and fill with clear spring water. Let it stand a few hours, then the barrel is fit for use.) Fine it, and if you like to draw it off at the end of 3 days, supposing you have used ale finings, you will have a splendid sparkling red wine. Temperance champagne if you like to call it such. If you fine in the ordinary way with soaked gelatine, allow it to stand 6 months, and you will have a splendid still wine for blending purposes with port, bordeaux, &c. Parsnip Wine. This is a very favourite wine among country housekeeper's; I cannot say I am partial to it, as it is very sickly in taste, and it is only the ginger and other condiments the house- wives put to it, that make it at all palatable to my mind, but chacun a son gout,^ I will give the receipt: 6 lbs. of par- snips peeled and cut into quarters or one-eighths, according to the size. Boil them in 2 gallons of water, and 4 lbs. of sugar, and 1 oz. of cream of tartar. The latter will take off the sickly taste but it can be omitted at pleasure. Put the whole into the fermenting tub and let it cool; add 1 gallon of boiled water; 2 ozs. of bruised ginger; and 2 ozs. of bruised cloves. Let it steep for 12 hours, then add the yeast for fermenting—stirring it up well, whilst adding the yeast. Draw off the liquor, and put it in a small 3 gallon cask. I believe the orthodox method is to leave the wine in the cask for two years, after fining. Then bottle for use; or if con- signed to the bottles at the end of 6 months, it is put into the cellar for a further period of 2 years ; and if kept for 4 or 6 years, (if not turned to vinegar—in which state, by the way, I prefer it,) it is said to surpass every other wine that ever was made—especially if made only of parsnips, water, and sugar.

312 THE NEW GUIDE FOR HOTELS, ETC. minutes. Strain and use in mixing the dough. Stir the oil into the flour, when it becomes dry rub it till the particles are well mixed throughout the whole. Then proceed as in No. III. viz: Making the flour into paste with water, cutting into five strips, working the lard or butterine into sheets, and finishing as before directed, (page 307) No. VI. Confectioner's Paste. Uses : Art work, such as pieces montees, castles, bulwarks, rocks, &c. Ingredients: Fine Roller High-dried Flour, (say,) 3 lbs. Lawn-sifted White Sugar, If lbs. White of Eggs strained, As required. Sifting the flour when cold, with the sugar through a tammy sieve into a bowl, is the cleanest way. Work it into a smooth paste with a spatula. It must be firm, smooth, and yet not too soft. Dust the board ; lay the paste on it; cover with a cloth and leave it for four hours to assimilate the ingredients. Roll out with a heavy oak pin, in a regular even roll. Get rid of air bladders. Roll the paste to l-8th of an inch thick- ness. Have your cardboard shapes ready; lay them on the paste ; cut round with a sharp knife ; lay on oiled baking tins and bake in a moderately heated oven. Should blisters appear to be rising, oil a paper, put it over the shapes and lay a heavy flat board on the top, when it comes out of the oven. When the pastry is cold it will be found that the blisters have disappeared and the paste quite even and flat. To join the design together, brush the sides or edges with strong solution of dissolved gelatine which is half cold. To frost or crystallize the work; before it is joined, brush it over with white of egg, or gelatine dissolved in water, and dust fine, rough, or centrifugal sugar over. Dry in a cool oven, then join as above.

HOTEL AND RESTAURANT COOKER^. 3OI has been oiled, (or salad oil) tossed in bread crumbs, and then roasted. By some Chefs they are first steeped in ver- juice, (the juice of green grapes) wiped dry, then oiled, crumbed, and roasted* They are served with lemon rings and fried crumbs. Hare is best roasted after plucking, but if skinned, it is exquisite, larded with a moderate sized needle, deep stitches, and using smoked Cumberland^ or Wiltshire bacon fat for the purpose. Some baste the Hare with porter, others with milk, I use only good dripping; and if the game is high, soak it in milk for 6 or 8 hours previous to stuffing. But ahove all keep it well basted. Serve with rich brown gravy sauce, and red currant jelly in the proper course. Port wine is proper to add to the stuffing and sauce. Pheasants should have the head of the male bird wrap- ped in one or two thicknesses of oiled writing paper, and the tail plume put in after the cooking is done. They should have the breast covered with buttered whitey brown tissue paper, till ten minutes before serving. The colour should be that of maize or Indian corn. Bread sauce is the English accompaniment. I had nearly written poultice, but try a good brown gravy, and a wine and jelly sauce in separate tureens, as at the clubhouses, and high class dinners, and leave the bread abomination out of the question, and your patrons will be more than grateful. Pheasants should be served in pairs, i, e. a brace. Partridges are generally sent in to table as a leash, when roast, t. e, in groups of three. They require the legs blanching in boiling water, and the outer skin removing. The toes cut off at the middle joint. The plumage of the red partridge is left on the head, and it is dressed with paper before roasting as for cock-pheasant. They are served

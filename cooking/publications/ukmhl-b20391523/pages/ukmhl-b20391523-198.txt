194 THE NEW GUIDE FOR HOTELS, ETC. be saved, by cooking ducks, fowls, &c., in the frying tanks. It is a more expeditious method, and far superior to close range roasting; as after being fried, the surface is crisp and delicate, the bird palatable, with the gravy and best juices of its flesh preserved. Whereas, in range roasting, if not well and constantly attended to, the surface is moist and the bird either dried up for want of basting, or else half raw, whilst the outside is quite scorched. A small gas coffee roaster too is valuable. Pots and Pans. Copper stewpans, enamelled pots and pans, a digester, turbot kettle, stewpans for range and gas use, all come in the list. I find the ware of the Stourport Anglo-American â€¢Stamping Co., of great use in my kitchens, as far as labour saving, and economic cleanliness is concerned. They save a lot of scrubbing and scouring required by copper and brass vessels. But mind I do not say they supercede the copper pans in some operations; for the slow transmission of heat as produced by copper is often a necessity. Where rapidity is required the Anglo American ware is the thing. Sundries. Baking plates, trays, moulds for boiled, baked, and cold goods; iron shovels for removing dishes, trays, &c., from the ovens; ladles for soups, basting, &c.; spoons of metal, various sizes, ditto of wood; spatulas; paste pins; boards, moulds, cutters for vegetables and pastries; mincing ma- chines, larding needles, cutlet bats, steak pressers and tongs; tart, omelette, and frying pans, various sized; egg poachers; strainers, wire sieves; hair, tammy, and silk ditto; tammy pressers and mashers; whisks of wire, also, revolving and plunger whisks, or egg beaters; fish scissors, and scissors for

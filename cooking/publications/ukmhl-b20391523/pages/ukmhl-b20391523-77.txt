LIQUEURS. 73 Red Currant Gin. Strip 7 lbs. of red currants from the stalks. Put them into a preserving-pan with a pint of water. Let them come to the boil. Strain through a jelly bag that has been dipped in boiling water, and wrung out, or through a lawn strainer. Return the juice to the pan with 7 lbs. of sugar. Stir with a wooden or silver spoon until the sugar is dissolved. Skim carefully and clarify it with the whites and shells of 2 eggs. I like to put the whites and shells of the eggs in when I put the sugar, but care must be taken by novices, that the sugar is all melted before the liquor commences boiling for the clearing. When it has boiled up, turn out the gas, but do not touch the preserving pan. Let it stand for 3 or 4 minutes, and then strain through a clear jelly bag or strainer. When it is quite cold, add to it 1 gallon of rough unsweeten- ed gin. Mix well, and it is ready for use. Add a tinge of cochineal if by any chance your liqueur should not be of a good colour. General Remarks. These simple Fruit Liqueurs and Gins are very good methods of using up large quantities of fruits left over from public breakfasts, luncheons, dinners, &c., which might otherwise be sold to the waste cartSy or appropriated by the small boys of the establishment. They can be made in smaller or larger quantities according to the fruit you have at your disposal, or if you wish to make them into Syrups. Boil the fruit as for red currant gin, and put about 1 pint of any spirit except rum, to the gallon of syrup, just to make it keep. They can then be sent for use*to serve with ice pud' dings, &c.,

15 HINTS ON BREWIN(^. after fermentation has ceased, then bung up and it is ready for immediate use. N.B. A very good table ale may be made by putting the malt and hops (used in the previous receipt) into the copper, covering them with water, and stewing them at about 190Â° for two hours. The contents of the copper are then laded into the mash tub, 12 gallons of water are boiled with 3 lbs. of sugar or treacle. This is poured on the mash and allowed to soak for an hour, when it is drawn off, cooled, fermented and fined. Another delicious beer may be produced by using pure rice malt made from Italian rice instead of barley. A less expen- sive imitation is made by using 1 part rice flour to 5 parts barley malt. It is brewed in a similar manner to ale. Pure rice beer is more expensive than the mixtures of rice and barley malt. The latter makes an ale more suitable to English palates. I have found Bush's French Cream Gum Extract invaluable for producing a permanent head of creamy rich- ness upon all kinds of ale and beer, rendering them brisk and sparkling, and no bottled beer that is wanted to open with a fine sparkling head should be without it. It greatly improves the condition of beer and porter that has become stale or flat during the summer or thunder weather. I have in using found it perfectly harmless, it does not promote acetous fer- mentation, has no deteriorating action whatever on the keep- ing qualities of the beers ; on the contrary its antiseptic pro- perties conduce to their preservation. Use 4 oz. to a barrel of 36 gallons, and add just previous to racking for delivery. The following remarks from the Leeds Mercury,'* fune, 1885, will show what changes have taken place in beer brewing. **Years ago the credit given for duty charged on malt was

igS THE NEW GUIDE FOR HOTELS, ETC. larger squares, but the component parts are just the same quality. For silver spoons, and goods of a like kind the soap is excellent, and I can give it five years' good character. Saucepans and Pots. Saucepans and pots ought to go to the scullery the moment they are done with, and if the men cannot attend to the cleansing at once, fill them with water for half an hour or so, but never leave them longer. Silver sand, cleansing soap, Hudson's soap powder, mason's dust from the stone masons yard, and a little stock of soda, and sound yellow soap—also a small barrel of soft soap and a gallon jar of scouring ammonia, and you will have every- thing to make the pots, pans and dishes, chemically clean. Flannels, pot-brooms, Ticklers," as they are professionally called, pot and dish cloths, small and large brushes, and sail cloth yarn mops, are all wanted. We will take the copper stock-pot as an object to be cleaned. This is done once a week. The stock is run off by the tap, and the bones, meat, &c., placed in a strainer. The pot is rinsed out, and then scoured with mason's dust, the flannel being first dipped in hot water, then in the dust. If any burn adheres to the pot; an almost impossible thing in a properly constructed stockpot, but may occur in braising and stewpans, and the one lesson does for all; use the tickler and a little of Hudson's soap powder to soften it more quickly. When it begins to look like silver then rinse out with plenty of water, using the mop so that every grain of dust may be cleared off. Polish with American soap— dry and proceed to clean the outside. Wash well, wipe dry, and polish with paste. The brighter the better, taps and all. Every day the outside ought to receive a polish up.

Salad a la Milord Salisbury. Ingredients:—Cucumber, lobster, hop vine tops and tendrils, truffles, wood sorrel, capers, tomatoes, celeraic garlic, blanched dandelions, potatoes, mustard, cress, lemons, salad, &:c.

Cut also rings of tomato, truffles, &c. Take 2 lobsters, or 1 hen lobster and a tin of lobster. Mince the meat from the tin, sprinkle it with tarragon vinegar and spiced vinegar. Rub the dish with garlic, squeeze a lemon over. Place a layer of tomatoes to completely cover the bottom of the dish, then potatoes, and celeraic, laying them each a row narrower, so that the three rows are seen round. Next spread a layer of lobster, and season it with pepper and salt. Lay a few rings of truffles on it, strew also a few capers over. Take the head off the lobster, divide the shell down the back, pass the coral through a sieve on to a clean plate, lay the 2 shells at either end of the dish, and the meat un- broken from the 2 halves at each side—the red side up, i, e. the portion that was next the shell.

HOTEL AND RESTAURANT COOKERY. 353 Boil the milk, dissolve the sugar in it, and whilst it is hot throw it over finely sifted white bread crumbs. Let them soak whilst you shred and mince the suet and mix it with the flour. Make it into a dough, handling as little as possible. Divide it into three, use two thirds to line the basin, which should be well greased. Beat up the eggs and the flavouring, and beat them into the milk and crumbs. Pour this into the basin mould, cover with crust. Steam li hours and serve. Decorations : Dried cherries, angelica, minced pistachio nuts, blanched almonds. Well grease or oil a mould, decorate it with the candied fruits, according to taste and fancy. Sift stale white bread crumbs (new is of no use,) into a basin, sweeten and boil the milk, and pour it hot on to the crumbs, mince the suet very finely; also the primrose petals, and mix both with the crumbs, add the eggs one at a time, beating up thoroughly, so that the pudding may be light. Pour into the mould, cover down and steam for 1^ hours. Serve with champagne sauce. A glass of cowslip wine poured gently over the pudding before serving, is a most exquisite addition.

HOTEL AND RESTAURANT COOKERY. 255 baked flour, cock's combs, cochineal, port wine, water-cress, stock. Make a mince of ham, fowl, or game; season with pepper, salt, mixed herbs; put into a saucepan ; moisten with good stock, and a drop of caramel to make it look rich and brown. Drop in a raw egg and stir till the whole becomes a mass; place the mince in an entree dish; pour over a good gravy thickened with brown baked flour. Pass the yolks of 2 hard boiled eggs through a wire sieve on to a plate, and from the point of a broad-bladed knife strew over the top of the dish, so as to look like a shower of gold. Have the cock's combs boiled in a little cochineal to make them nice and red ; lay 7 or 8 artistically round the dish, with water-cress and quar- tered rings of lemon between. N.B. The whites of the hard boiled eggs can be handed over to the salad dresser; do not waste them. Mutton a la Prince de Galle. (Mutton in Mode "Prince of Wales.")

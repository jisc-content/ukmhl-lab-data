HOTEL AND RESTAURANT COOKERY. 33$ **The Erl King's Cup, Sweet maid try your luck." These should never be handed to absent minded people. They might swallow the Erl King's gift, and then he would be angry, and bring dire misfortune on the household. A somewhat similar dish is;— Barbarossa's Treasure Trove, Ingredients:— Sponge Cake Crumbs, iib. White Wine, 2 Glasses. Conserved Peaches, 12 Halves. Pearl Sugar, As required. Cognac. 1 Glass. Blanc Mange, 1 Pint. Candied Spirits and Ratafia Biscuits, As required. Centrifugal Sugar, ilb. Coins and Rings, At will. Lay the cake crumbs on the bottom of the trifle dish, moisten them with white wine. Take canned peaches, put them in a jar, strew pearl sugar over and moisten it with water, or liquor from the tin if clear. Put it into a cool oven, where it will only warm through, and leave it for an hour. Then lay it on the cake so as to completely cover it. Make a corn flour hlanc-mange, sweeten and flavour with cognac. Pour half this over the peaches, lay the gifts, (treasure troves) on the corn flour, cover with more corn- flour, decorate with ratafia biscuits, candied fruits of all kinds, and sprinkle between centrifugal sugar.

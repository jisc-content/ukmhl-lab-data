406 THE NEW GUIDE FOR HOTELS, ETC. Tarragon Vinegar. Half fill a glass pickle jar with tarragon leaves. Country people can always get them from Covent garden, by send- ing up a few pence to one of the many green-grocers there. The leaves are in best perfection for vinegar making, from June to July, and should be gathered during a spell of fine weather, and also, they should be perfectly dry. Pour on them sufficient white wine vinegar to fill the jar. Cork it tight, and in about 3 weeks it will be flavoured for use; the longer it steeps (in moderation J the better the flavour will be extracted. Garlic Vinegar. Take the outer skins from a garlic root. Separate the cloves, cut each in two, and place in the bottles in the pro- portion of 1 oz. to the quart. Cork tightly and seal. Steep for about 3 weeks, strain ofl* and bottle, add another quart and let it steep 3 months. Shalot Vinegar is made as above, J lb. of peeled shalots to the quart of vinegar. Use white wine. Mint Vinegar, as tarragon. See above. Basil Vinegary as tarragon. Syringa Vinegar, as tarragon, used to impart a flavour of cucumber to salads. Burnet Vinegar, as tarragon, see above, and used for the same purposes as syringa leaves. These two vinegars impart such an exact cucumber flavour that they are invaluable to the cook. I find steeping them in spirit gives a fine essence of cucumber for some sweet dishes and cups.

Caramel, J ,, Take two large, tall sponge cakes, cut one into four length- wise, take unequal portions off the bottom so that they may not all be of one height, cut off, and then hollow out the cake at the inside sharp edge of each quarter, so that it may fit close to the other (and centre) cake. Soak the centre cake well with wine, first standing it in the glass dish, crumble the cuttings down, place the four quarters round the tall centre piece, strew the crumbs equally over the bottom of the dish. The wine that runs from the chief cake will soak the crumbs and side pieces. Pour the custard over the crumbs. The custard should be a little thicker than for cup custard. Prepare 1| packets of Goodall's Lemon Blanc-mange Powder with IJ pints of milk, sweeten with sugar. This ought not to be so thick as for hlanc-mange, as it is intended to pour over the sponge cakes, it should drape from the spoon, pour whilst hot over the cakes, which will then look like snow mountains. Pop some Indian corn or maize. If you have no basket

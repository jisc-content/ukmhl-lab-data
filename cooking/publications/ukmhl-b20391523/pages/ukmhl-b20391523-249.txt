HOTEL AND RESTAURANT COOKERY. 245 ELEVES are for the most part boiled or braised, and iV embrace such dishes as chicken, boiled and served with peas, cauliflower, macedoines, &c. York hams and tongues; chevaux de frieze lamb; boned turkey, fowls, &c. It is not my intention to give the receipts which can be culled from any ordinary cookery-book, but to give, as it were, a supple- ment to the Chef and dinner-giver, who may require new and fashionable dishes, and may not be in the way of running round the clubs, to gather in the new styles. One of the latest fashions is :â€” Tete de Veau a la Duchesse d'Albany. Ingredients: Calf's head, lean boiled ham, veal forcemeat, hard boiled eggs, truffles, cowslip wine, sauce jaune, ham and veal forcemeat balls, thirty-two in number, ^ pint mashed potatoe, J pint mashed carrot, i pint mashed green peas, i. e.^ puree of each, egg, white sifted crumbs, button mushrooms. Bone the head, lay the skin next the board, cover it over with delicate slices of boiled ham. If raw ham is used the saltpetre or acetic acid frequently turns the lean of other meats cooked with it a violent red. ** Sugar hams" are best if raw is used, and then they ought to steep in hot water for half an hour before being laid on. When covered by the ham, lay 2 inches of veal and truffle forcemeat over, and then slices of ham again. Roll up, fasten with a silver skewer, wrap in a clean white boiling cloth ; tie with flat tape, so that no ridges appear on it after dishing. Put the bones into some good white stock, let it come quite to the boil, and then CHAPTER VI. Releves. (Calf's Head, Duchess of Albany's Style.) i

444 THE NEW GUIDE FOR HOTELS, ETC. Many medical men object to the foods being grilled over the fire. They say the meat absorbs the sulphurous fumes emitted by the coal or coke used in cooking, and that the food is better and more wholesome when cooked in front. The same law is applicable to gas grillers. If the gas is not purified thoroughly at the gas works, the chop or steak invariably partakes of the flavour, if cooked over gas. That is why I always prefer those ranges that supply roasters and grillers, which cook by a deflection of heat, i.e. the gas jets are over not under the food. The fire being clear, grease the bars of the grid, after warming, and lay on the chop or steak. Turn it every minute till it is cooked, so that none of the gravy may escape. The more it is turned the better. Do not cook one side and then turn the other, or all the fine juices of the meat will be lost. Serve as little fat or grease to an invalid as possible, and but small chops and steaks. Small quantities tempt, and large pieces very frequently disgust and repel the appetite. Greasy gravies should be avoided. Generally the patient has had so many beef-teas and gruels that he relishes the grill au naturel. A speck of Maitre Hotel butter^ or plain butter, may be placed on the top, if the patient would like it. Dust a little castor salt over when it is dished, and serve with plain bread or toast. Salad Dressings. These vary greatly and according to taste. The most popular high class dressing is the Mayonnaise. This can be bought in bottles from the stores; high class Grocers, and at Italian warehouses,â€”but it is best home and freshly made.

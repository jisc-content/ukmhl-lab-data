HOTEL AND RESTAURANT COOKERY. 275 Pigeons a la Due de Cambridge. (The Duke of Cambridge's Pigeon Entree.) Ingredients: Pigeons, brown beef stock, red wine, desic- cated cocoanut, ham or tongue, spices, lemon. Prepare the pigeons over night, dressing and quartering them; blanching the toes in hot water, and removing the skin and nails. Rub in black pepper and ground allspice, and lay them in a bath of rough red wine. Do not over-do the spices. Let the birds steep all night. Add an equal quantity of brown stock to the red wine, and stew the birds in this liquor for 1 hour. When done, bruise the livers in a mortar. Lift out the birds. Reduce the gravy by rapid boiling one half, add the livers and dessicated cocoanut to thicken it. Make a handsome trophy of the birds' wings and claws. Put in each claw a piece of parsley. Surround the trophy with the thick gravy; garnish with semi-quarters of lemon. Roll slices of hot ham, cut very thin, and place round in the gravy. Dindon a la Whitehead. (The Whitehead Duck Entree.) Ingredients: Duck, forcemeat, good stock, white wine, spinach, truffles, brown glaze, apples, quince, sugar. Dress and cut the bird into neat joints, put it in a pan to stew with good stock. Make a fine forcemeat of white meats, well-seasoned and flavoured with truffles. Moisten it with stock. When the duck is nearly ready, add 1 or 2 raw- eggs to the forcemeat; butter a shape, a cone is best; place the forcemeat in, put buttered paper over, and steam for 15 minutes. Have ready also a bed of well-cooked, finely- chopped spinach. Lay this in a silver entree dish, which should be very hot. Place the forcemeat in the centre. Pile

HOTEL AND RESTAURANT COOKERY. 293 and chicken, (or tongue and chicken,) to each 1 lb. allow a couple of little button mushrooms, and 1 oz, of butter, or 2 ozs. of ham fat. Mix it well, pass through the mincer, season with pepper, salt, a dust of cayenne and ground cloves. Then fill the skins. Use bread or rice if the material is short, but it keeps longer and tastes sweeter, at the end of the week without. The rice and bread are apt to ferment if kept long. Steam for 1 hour, oil or dip in melted paraffin wax if required for yatching or keeping purposes. Choose small plump legs of Welsh mutton, trim them as hams. Prepare the following for a 4 to 6 lb. leg. Mix and rub this into the meat, turning it every day for 8 to 10 days. Lift it out and wipe it dry. Hang it up for 24 hours, then brush over with strong acid, and polish the skin by oiling, if for sale. Should it receive three coats of acid thoroughly brushed and soaked in, it will keep for 3 years fresh and good, and have a delicious smoked flavour. To Serve. Soak in cold spring water for 12 hours, next wash in fresh water. Boil or steam as for ham, using cold water, and slow boiling—and if preferred at table grated, it must be put in a heavy press whilst hot, and grated when cold and set—used as Breakfast dish^ Entree gar7iish^ or supper New Hampshire Smoked Hams.

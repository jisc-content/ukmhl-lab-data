58 THE NEW GUIDE FOR HOTELS, ETC, Maraschino. A first class maraschino is prepared from 7 lbs. of morella cherries, bruised in a mortar, and each stone withdrawn and cracked. A little practice will soon enable you to with- draw the stones from the cherries. Work the cherries with he fore finger and thumb of the right hand, holding the jtalk with the left. In rolling try to ease the flesh from the ;op of the stone, then you can draw the stone out from the cherry and you will find it still attached to the stalk. When the stones are cracked and the cherries bruised, put them into a two gallon jar with 3 lbs. of the leaves of the wild cherry, (gean.) or if these are not obtainable use the same quantity of peach leaves, J lb. of red rose leaves, 1 oz. fresh orange flowers, 1 oz. white jessamine flowers. The flowers must all be bruised either in a marble mortar or by a wooden mallet, or masher. Metal unless silver, should not be used. Put into the 2 gallon jar with the cherries, add 6 lbs. of lump sugar, and 5 quarts of p, plain spirit. Macer- ate for one month. Filter and bottle. Curacoa. Take 12 fine skinned Seville oranges, peel them as thinly as possible, and 1 oz. of fresh orange flowers. Put them into a gallon jar. Make a syrup of 2 lbs. of sugar, and pour it while hot over them. When it is cold remove the cork, and add 2 quarts of 0. p. spirit. Let it steep for a fortnight, during which time it should be rocked frequently, then filter and bottle. If the colour is not right, tone up with saffron. Another Method.â€”Is to make a syrup of 3 lbs. of sugar as for noyeau (see previous receipts.) When strained add the contents of a 1 oz. bottle of essence of orange, and 1 oz. of treble distilled orange flower water

Then put them also into the pan, put on the lid, and let them stew slowly till they are tender. Soak for an hour or two 1 oz. of gelatine in red wine. Wlien the apples are done, pass them through a wire sieve. Taste and find if they require more sugar, if so, add it now, return the apples to the pan with the soaked gelatine. Stir it till the gelatine melts. Then pour into a block tin mould. If you prefer the jelly of a deep red hue, add a sufficient quantity of cochineal to make it the colour you wish. GATEUX.

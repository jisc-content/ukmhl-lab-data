A MIXTURE FOR IMPROVING RUM. 35 bucket of boiling water, and is hot and dry inside. Transfer the contents of the pan rapidly; pour on the spice 1 gallon 0. p, spirit. Let it stay in the jar for a fortnight, shaking it well every day; then filter and add to the spirit 2 gallons of syrup—second quality, mixing it with the spirit essence as you require to use it, and keeping it tightly corked so that it may not evaporate. To serve, 1 teaspoonful to a pint of porter, and sweeten to the customer's taste. A Mixture for Improving Rum Is essence of prunes. Prunes 3 lbs., o. p. plain spirit 1 quart, Guiness's extra stout 2 gallons, gelatine \ lb., clarified honey 1 lb. Take a hammer and strike each prune so as to break the kernel. When they are all done put them into a jar with the o. p. plain spirit or rum. Rummage it well and let it stand for a fortnight or 3 weeks, shaking it every day. Next add the clarified strained honey—then the stout. Soak the gelatine in 1 quart of the stout, dissolve it over the fire—add to the contents of the jar, rummage it well whilst adding. Let it stand for an hour or two, then add to any barrels of rum, that have become weak and under excise proof, 1 pint to the gallon and a table spoonful of essence of capsicum will soon brighten, tone it up and give it body. This Prune Mixture may be used for Port Wine that has gone wrong. Another Toning Mixture for Wines and Spirits Is made as follows.

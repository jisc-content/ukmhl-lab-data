HOTEL AND RESTAURANT COOKERY. Tomato Salad. Ingredients: Tomatoes, Spanish onion, oil, vinegar, tarra- gon, and spiced vinegar, cayenne, yolk of raw eggs, water- cress. Slice the tomatoes into fair rings, and the Spanish onion in fine delicate rings, place them in alternate rows. Mix into the yolk of eggs a tablespoonful of oil. Put a teaspoonful of vinegar, 2 drops of tarragon vinegar, and a dash of spiced vinegar, season with salt, a dust of cayenne and pepper. Garnish with water cress. Serve. The St. Petersburg Salad. Take all kinds of root vegetables cooked, cut them into dice or long fancy patterns, sprinkle in the bottom of the bowl a thick layer of grated Hamburg beef, next lay on the vegetables, keeping the brightest colour and prettiest pat- terns for the top, then place an even layer of pickled mush- rooms* and sliced olives. Arrange another deepish layer of grated beef, over this pour a good quantity of salad dressing (see page 446) so as not to touch the outer edge, then group the last of the vegetables with artistic merit. Arrange in pat- terns with red and yellow aspics dispersed in heaps amongst the pyramid of vegetables, also small balls of Russian caviare. The usual dressing is yolks of eggs, olive oil, sugar, sour white wine, a dash of Russian spirit, salt, vinegar, cayenne, and other peppers. * For a Russian preparation both raw and pickled mushrooms are used. Many of them, Frenchmen would consider poisonous from their bright colours.

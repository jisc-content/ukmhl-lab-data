8i HOME MADE WINES. Black Cherry Wines. 2 GALLONS of black cherries, or wild cherries; mash them and put them into a tub ; make a wort of 3 gallons of water; 10 lbs. of sugar; and 2 ozs. of citric acid crystals. Boil and skim, pour the boiling liquor on the cherries; stir in 1 lb. of ground malt and when the liquor is cold ferment it with a little yeast. The malt prevents the wine being flat as wild cherry wine is apt to be. When the liquor has done fer- menting, skim it. Put into the cask, J lb. of cinnamon, and J lb. of allspice, bruised, and 1 oz. of cloves ; but if you pre- fer to save trouble in bruising the spices, use cherry essence, then add the liquor. When the after-fermentation has sub- sided, clear with 1 oz. of dissolved and soaked gelatine. Bung up. It will be ready in from 8 to 12 months. Blackberry and Plum Wine.

To make the wine : Take 3 gallons of blackberries freshly gathered during dry weather. Put them, \ ^ gallon at a time, into a preserving pan with a pint of water, stir them over the fire until they come to a boil; then strain them through a jelly bag, putting the liquor into a clean vessel; repeat this until all the blackberries are done. To every gallon of the liquor, add \\ lbs. of plums, and 3 lbs. of sugar, and to the whole I gallon of boil ed water. Put this into a mash tub, ferment it with yeast, and when it has done working, remove the head and cask it. Many people put all the fruit into the

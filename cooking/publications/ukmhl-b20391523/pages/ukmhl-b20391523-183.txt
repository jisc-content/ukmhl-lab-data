179 TEMPERANCE DRINKS. Eastern Cream Nectar. Extra Strong Coffee, Soda Water, 1 Pint. 2 Bottles. 1 TablespoonfuL 1 Pint. 2 Tablespoonfuls. 2 ozs. Honey, Milk, Cream, Sugar, Mixing: Make an infusion of the coffee, about 2 table- spoonfuls to the pint. Whilst hot, dissolve the honey and sugar after straining. Add the milk and cream, stirring it frequently until it is cold. Stand on the ice, or in the freezer, until it is wanted, then add the soda water, and serve at once. This is a delicious drink for balls and garden parties. Some caterers add a wine glassful of orange flower essence, but that in my opinion destroys the bouquet and aroma of the coffee. This is simply a matter of taste. N. B. The coffee must not be boiled, simply an infused pre- paration. Boiling water poured on freshly roasted and ground coffee berries, and allowed to stand from 10 to 15 minutes, then strained off.

ESSENCE OF CAPSICUM. 55 parts, white wine vinegar, or if such a strong vinegar is not needed, add a pint to the quart of syrup. Essence of Vanilla. Cut up a vanilla stalk, and place in a porcelain funnel filter, such as that used by chemists. Fill the filter with genuine 60^ o. p, spirit. Allow it to filter slowly through into a glass bottle. This operation can be repeated 3 or 4 times with fresh spirit. Cork and seal the bottle. Vanilla Sugar. Put 3 vanilla pods into a quart of spirit, let them stand from 14 to 21 days, then pour the spirit on broken lump sugar, dry the sugar slowly, grind and lawn sift it, seal and bottle for use. The quart will saturate 14 lbs. of sugar. Essence of Ginger. Bruise 1 lb. of fine white Jamaica ginger, put it into a jar with 1 quart of o.p, spirit. Steep for 3 weeks, shaking the bottle every day. Then strain and filter, and you will have a quintessence of ginger. During the time of infusion if the jar is kept at 70Â° F., the process of absorption by the spirit of the essential essence of the ginger will be consider- ably greater than if the maceration takes place in a cooler temperature. Ginger Syrup Can be made from the above receipt, by taking some stock syrup (see page 87) and flavouring it to the strength required with the essence of ginger and a few drops of spirit of capsicum. Essence of Capsicum. Take 1 lb. of chillies, (red peppers) or red capsicum pods.

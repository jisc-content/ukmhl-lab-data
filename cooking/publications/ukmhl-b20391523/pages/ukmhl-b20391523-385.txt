HOTEL AND RESTAURANT COOKERY. 381 work can be done in a cleanly, tidy manner without a spatula. Directions are usually sent with the machines as to the quantity of ice and salt or freezing agent required. And such &c*s as spatulas, spades, freezing tubs, with taps near the bottom for the escape of water dripping from the melting ice are explained, and the method of working. The first thing to do is to prepare the subject to be iced. Belle Vue Ices Are made as follows:â€”The juice of lemons, or lemon zest, 1 pint, sugar 1 lb., arrowroot 1 oz., water 3 pints, lemon essence 10 drops. Boil 2|- pints of the water, dissolve the sugar therein, add the lemon juice, and let it again come to the boil, skim off any scum that rises. Mix the arrowroot with the i pint of cold water. Stir it into the boiling water. Let it boil, stirring the while, till the arrowroot becomes quite clear. Then lift the pan off the fire. Add the lemon essence, and put it away to cool. Put it into the freezer when you are ready, and close the lid. Pack the ice and salt round. Of course it is known that the ice must be pounded very fine and mixed with about J or a little more of its bulk in salt. Commence turning the wheel and continue till it feels hard, as if the inside apparatus were clogged. Then open the freezer, work the ice from the sides and " blend " z. e. with the wooden spatula work it till it becomes smooth, and the rough granular appearance of a common street ice is dispelled, work it again. Then fill your moulds and keep them in ice till wanted. Or cut in blocks and wrap in white paper, lay on the ice till called for. Then take off the paper and serve. Cream Ices Are made from double cream sweetened and flavoured, and worked as above.

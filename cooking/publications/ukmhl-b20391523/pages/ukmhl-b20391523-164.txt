In buying the molasses, be careful where you get it from. The cheapest kinds are from sawdust, beetroot, potato, and other refuse, by the action of sulphuric acid. It is needless to tell the honest dealer that the syrup or molasses from such sources is altogether bad, no matter how often the grocer next door may praise his last consignment of horrid stuff.

When the fermentation is subsiding, skim off the head; strain into a barrel or jar; add the spruce essence or extract. (It is bought under either name.)

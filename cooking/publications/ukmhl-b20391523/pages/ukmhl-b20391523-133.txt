129 COBBLERS. CHAPTER XI. American Drinks, &c. (Continued.) The Cobbler Is not only an American institution, but also is found in Australia and New Zealand. Perhaps it is the most popular of the reed or straw drinks amongst the English people, and the Sherry Cobbler Is the most common of all.

Lemon, 2 Thin rings. Ice. Mixing. Place the lemon on a plate till wanted. Put the sherry and sugar into the glass, half fill the tumbler with ice, shake it round well so as to dissolve the sugar a little. Fill up with the rest of the ice, and fix the rings of lemon upright in the glass so that they look like half moons ap- pearing above the rim of the glass. Stick 2 straws in an upright position down the side of the glass and between the lemon strips. Champagne Cobbler.

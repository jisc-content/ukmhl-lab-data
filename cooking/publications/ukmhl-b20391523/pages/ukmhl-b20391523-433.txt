HOTEL AND RESTAURANT COOKERY. 429 To taste. Lump Sugar, crushed. cles thus mixed with the little sacs or bags of starch are diluted to a certain extent, and with a solid substance. The solidity thus given acts in a twofold manner. It prevents the too rapid absorption of the milk or other liquid foods by the lacteals; or the density of the curd from overweighting or pressing too heavily on the intestines, which in time of sick- ness are naturally sensitive to pressure. A sick man will often be unable to retain milk on the stomach, if given in a pure state, or even in a liquid form, whether diluted or mixed with another fluid. But when mixed and the particles of casine separated by the aid of starch foods, it is at once light, digestable, nutritious." The following are a few of the methods in which starch foods may be employed for the sick. Put the arrowroot into a breakfast cup or small basin, moisten it with three teaspoonfuls of cold milk, put the rest of the half pint of milk over the fire to boil, and sweeten it, using either lump or pearl sugar. Be very careful not to oversweeten it, for that is another common error. Sick peo- ple are doomed to be supplied with sweets, in over abun- dance. It gives them a distaste for their food and in cases of feverishness it is but adding fuel to the fire. When the milk rises in the pan, at once pour it on the moistened arrowroot, stirring the whole time. If wine or brandy is ordered with the arrowroot and milk, it is to be beaten in afler the arrow- root starch has burst its sacs, and become jelly-like, from the action of the boiling milk. To make it into a pudding, beat up an egg, mix in butter in a pie dish and bake, serve plain, or with preserve, fresh fruit stewed, or syrups, &c. Arrowroot and Milk.

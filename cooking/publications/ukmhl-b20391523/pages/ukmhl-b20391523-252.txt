Take a fillet from the leg weighing about 4 to 5 lbs. When boned, fill the place with lean pork, and sprinkle with salt on both sides, and leave it about 2 hours. Trim it, and score in rings very nicely, wipe it dry, and lard with strips of smoked bacon fat, using a large needle for the purpose. Put it to brown in a braising pan, with slices of bacon fat, carrots, onions, bouquet of sweet herbs. When brown, moisten with good brown stock, and a glass of good sour white wine, or a tablespoonful of spiced white wine vinegar. When the meat is sufficiently cooked, drain it. Strain off the liquor from the vegetables. Add gelatine and colouring, if necessary, reduce the stock by rapid boiling till it is thick like honey. Pour over the meat and serve. The vegetables may go into the vegetable, or brown stock pot. Filet de Pore a la Marechale. (The Marshal's Fillet of Pork.) Take half a leg of young pork, not too fat.

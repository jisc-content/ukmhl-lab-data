ESSENCE OF TANSY. 51 Essence of Pine For the manufacture of spruce beers and American drinks is made by steeping. First, (and best) spruce fir tassells or young buds of the spruce; 1 quart to a gallon of spirit. Second, by pine chips or splints, which are simply fine shavings from the core of a section of pine woodâ€”4 square inches of the wood to the quart of spirit. The wood must be freshly cut from the plantation. This is ready in three days. Third, from young spruce fir cones, gathered in the early autumn. The cones should be as young and tender as possible, 1 pint to the gallon. Steep in plain spirit from two to three weeks. Essence of Absinthe. Macerate wormwood leaves or flowers, 1 lb. to a gallon of the strongest 0. p. spirit that can be bought (potato spirit being the most fiery, is usually employed in the manufacture of absinthe); I fluid oz. of tincture of chillies ; 1 fluid oz. of tincture of lemon peel. Steep from 8 to 10 days. Strain and filter. Wash the lees with 1 pint of distilled water; filter twice; add to the spirit, and this most horrible of all drinks is ready for sale. If the colour is not green enough, a little saff'ron and indigo spirit judiciously mixed will give the required tint. It must be remembered in serving absinthe that it never comes in contact with metal spoons. This is possibly because vitriol is largely employed abroad in its manufacture. A small liqueur glass of absinthe is poured into a wine glass, and the water added as one would add oil to a mayonaise sauce, that is, a drop at a time, until as much water is added as the consumer pleases to use. We shall not have occasion to refer to absinthe again, as it is a drink which should be decidedly discouraged. Essence of Tansy Is frequently used in American beer drinks. It is prepared

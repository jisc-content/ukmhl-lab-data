154 THE NEW GUIDE FOR HOTELS, ETC. shake round; pour in the acid syrup and hand to the customer. II. Another and Rougher Method, which I do not at all advocate, is to have the acid syrup prepared as above, and well watered thus—1 gallon we will say of cherry syrup, 1 gallon of boiled water, and \ lb. of acid mixed in to the boiling water. When it is cold, add it to the cherry syrup, and put it into tap jars for use. Have a round bowl on the counter, and a number of clean spoons beside it. You draw the syrup into the bar-glass, 3 parts filling it, you then step up to the counter, take a spoon, half fill it with carbonate of soda. Stir it round in the acid, syrup, and water, in the glass, and hand it to the customer. This is what you would call a semi-lazy way of doing the business, especially when you see the bar-tender pop the wet spoon back into the carbonate of soda. ** It makes you feel a kind 'er riled.'* III. Another and Tidier Method often pursued, but which requires more room for stock—is to boil one gallon of water, and dissolve \ lb. of citric acid crystals in it. Let it get quite cold, and put it into a jar with tap for use. N. B. Let me try to impress on the caterer the superiority of boxwood, or even common wooden taps over brass, or metal for drawing these acids; Glass and porcelain taps have re- cently been introduced, they are very good. I believe verdi- gris forms in less than an hour when acid is in contact with a brass tap. The soda water can be made by dis- solving the soda (i lb. to the gallon) in cold or boiling water, and placing it in another barrel. Sometimes and especially for a quick sale, the citric crystals, or tartaric acid, are dissolved in a pint of boiling water, and added to a gallon, less the pint of cold water, and sometimes powder- ed tartaric acid is dissolved in cold water.

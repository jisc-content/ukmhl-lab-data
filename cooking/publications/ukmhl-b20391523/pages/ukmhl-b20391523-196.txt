In the other case, it would be boiled in a copper and given fresh to the animals. Sour swill produces Swine fever. Gas Stoves. Gas Stoves are essential in the work of large Houses.— They are difficult to select. If a perfect combustion of fuel is necessary in a coal range, it is imperative in a gas cooker. Just a few hints, as to the mode of testing in choos- ing. Light a taper, and hold it a little above the jets if circular, or near one. If in rows, turn on the gas and rapidly pass the taper over the burners, or the apertures. Now, note 1st. If the flame be blue ox yellow.—If the latler there is a

46 THE NEW GUIDE FOR HOTELS, ETC. CHAPTER VII. Infusions and Decoctions: Tinctures, Spirit Essences and Bitters. HERE is a decided difference between an infusion and 1 a decoction. An infusion may be either hot or cold and is prepared thus: The leaves, seeds or roots, are placed in a jar and covered with either water or spirit, sometimes with a mixture of both. Spirit draws out the resinous gums and essential oils; water draws out mucilage, saccharine matter and earthy salts. A decoction is a boiling or stewing, for example, it is a very common error to call a boiled decoc- tion of linseedâ€”tea. Teas are all produced by infusion and not by decoction. An infusion of linseed, or linseed tea would be made by pouring cold or boiling water over lin- seeds, and allowing them to steep in this, so as to extract their proper juices. Having explained this little point, I will proceed to give directions for the preparations of one or two colourings* Take 6 ozs. of cudbear; infuse in 3 pints of o, p. spirit, for from 10 to 14 days, then filter and bottle for use. 1 oz. of saffron infused in 1 pint of o. p. spirit, for 10 to 14 days or longer. Agitate daily. Filter through the proper paper and bottle when sufficiently soaked. Another Yellow Colour Is produced from turmeric, treated in the same way as the saffron. Pink. Yellow.

Add sweet herbs (lemon thyme, basil, parsley, bay-leaf,) and spices, (cloves, white pepper, mace, and a tiny piece, as large as a lentil, of nutmeg) no salt. Stew quite gently for 1 hour. There must not be more than a ripple on the milk. Take out the cutlets. Do not throw away the milk, strain it, for it will be wanted. Dust the meat over on both sides with cornflour, using a dredger. Brush the cutlets over with egg. Toss in bread crumbs. Fry a golden brown ; drain, and place in a hot entree dish. Make the milk into sauce by thickening with cornflour farina; beat in a lump of butter; then add the salt, not before or the milk will curdle. Chop about a tablespoonful of capers or gherkins to every pint of sauce. Surround the cutlets with this and border with green peas, or green lentils in the pod, dress somewhat like French beans.

Do not draw the birds but truss them. Take chervil, lemon thyme, basil, chives, and twice the quantity of button mush- rooms ; mince them all very fine, squeeze lemon juice over and a little salt; mix them well together. Brush each bird over with butter; dip into the mixture the moment it is covered and while the butter is still semi-oiled. Place in the case; cover over with buttered paper; place on a tray on a bed of charcoal or rice, to prevent the paper from being burnt. When cooked draw from the oven; have the yolk of hard boiled eggs passed through a wire sieve; sprinkle it on the top of each bird and lay a quarter of a lemon on each case and serve.

!8 THE NEW GUIDE FOk HOT^:LS, ETC. put on a raised stand in the centre of the cellar, and a chan- nel leading to the drain made to carry off the water. This will considerably lower the temperature of very hot cellars. For the storing of barrels of stock and store ales, i.e.y ales and beers that are unracked, there is nothing to beat the old fashioned oak rest, where the cask may lie in peace for 3, 5, 7, or 20 years if necessary. But in these go-ahead days, we find a barrel of beer consigned to its cask on Satur- day and sold as old ale in less than 19 days, having all the appearance and taste of a well matured 5 years old liquor. The iron self tilting racks, or racks supplied with Fowell's barrel tilter are the most useful furnishings a cellar can have. Ale for quick consumption should be received from the brewery racked, and a great deal depends on the manage- ment. If through the carelessness of the Brewery Co.'s ser- vants, the casks are imperfectly cleansed and putrefactive fermentation has assailed the beer, send it back to the brewery, or better still, drain it thoroughly out and mark the barrel as infected, taking care that none of the liquor touches any other barrel or wooden vessel in the house. It is better to lose the beer when in this state than to lose your custom altogether. If the beer should turn ropy and look oily and viscid when drawn, you may be sure that it requires immediate attention. A good old receipt is \ lb. of mustard seeds put in a bag at the bung hole, and 1 oz. of rock 1 alum, dram sulphate of iron and 2 drams of salt. In a few days it will be fit to drink with a good head on it. To Make Old Ale. Add sulphuric acid 1 oz. to the barrel, rummage well, also salts of steel 2 drams.

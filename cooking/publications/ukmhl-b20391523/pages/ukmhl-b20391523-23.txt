FLAT PORTER. 19 orange powder are all used in making new ale rapidly into old, but they are to be avoided. When beer is flat, a little salts of wormwood or a lump of whitening put into the barrel will quickly restore it. If tart or hard, carbonate of Potash and a few powdered oyster shells will quickly restore it. Beer that has been affected by thunder or atmospheric causes of a like nature, viz.â€”the presence of electricity in the air which affects it by causing a decomposition of the com- ponent parts, may be rectified by mixing with the beer in the barrel 6d. of Boby's Finings. Rummage the beer well and add a pint of caramel. Do not be tempted to use boiled Spanish juice, or black tobacco to restore the colour and strength. The sugar colouring is far more simple, natural and effective. After well rummaging, bung up the barrel for 24 hours, then rack off by means of the lower tap and pour into a clean sweet barrel. Draw off in small quantities, say a gallon at a time ; the moment it appears thick and any sedi- ment or lees appear, stop drawing as you will have come to the bottom of the cask. The more slowly and smaller the stream of liquor that is drawn off, the more gently the top crust produced by the finings will descend, and the less feaf of its being broken or the beer clouding. To produce the celebrated Cauliflower Head on Porter* Take to the barrel, sulphate of iron 2 drams, alum 1 dram, powdered bay salt 1 dram, common salt 2 drams. Put in and rummage, then bung down and in 12 hours it will be fit for use* Flat Porter May be revived by taking 1 lb. of high-dried freshly ground malt. Tie in a muslin bag, and hang in the porter from the

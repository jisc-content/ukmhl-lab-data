HOTEL AND RESTAURANT COOKERY. 405 ginger, J oz. of mustard seeds, and J oz. of turmeric, boil these together, add 1 lb. of tomatoes, and 1 lb. of Spanish onion peeled. When they are tender, lift them out with a ladle, so as not to break them, and make a puree by passing them through a tammy sieve. Return this to the vinegar and spices, and boil for another 10 minutes. To each quart, take the yolks of 3 eggs, and \ pint of oil. Work the oil into the eggs, and when it is cold, add to the vinegar pickle. Fill the jars with this, and if more vinegar is re- quired at the end of the week, add boiled vinegar, with whole peppers, and a little salt in it, and thickened with turmeric, and cork closely and seal.

If you can get the sprays red, yellow and green, do so, they have a good effect in salad, and entree decoration, as well as grouping with other pickles,â€”the green will have to be carefully dressed by themselves. Put them into white wine vinegar, and use white spices, as for lemon pickle. Pickled cherries and mountain ash, are also good adjuncts for cold game, and salad work. Chilli Vinegar. Put 1 quart of white wine vinegar into a jar with 1 oz. of chillies. Steep for a week, and it will be ready for use in 3 months, it will be perfection. Stir the jar now and then, keep it carefully sealed, and as small quantities are with- drawn, fill up with fresh vinegar. Capsicum Vinegar is made in the same way, using the large pods. These can be utilized after in pickling onions, and mixed pickles dressed in clear vinegafs, '

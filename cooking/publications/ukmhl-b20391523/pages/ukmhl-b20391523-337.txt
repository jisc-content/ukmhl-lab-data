Rub 3 tablespoonfuls of greengage jam through a tammy sieve, colour the puree with spinach juice, or vegetable green to make it a bright colour. Whip a pint of double cream, stir in the greengage puree, dissolve the gelatine over the fire and stir into the cream, continue the stirring, till the cream seems to be near setting, then pour over the Queen cakes. Roughly stich together a card-board step pyramid, cover it with slices of sponge cake and Queen cake, brushing the edges of the cake with^white of egg, so as to act as a cement and keep the pieces firmly in place. When it is quite firm, withdraw the cardboard. Dust this over with sugar. If you like to make a good lemon sponge, open a tin, melt and whip, and fill the inside of the pyramid, or set in a pyramid mould and coat with the sponge cake,

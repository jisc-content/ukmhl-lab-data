18 sweet with rosemary and thyme and musk as the manu- scripts; they are as exact in referring every dish to its proper authority, they retain the tone of intimacy, they abound in personal confidences. “ My Lady Middlesex makes Syllabubs for little glasses with spouts, thus,” you read in one collection; in another, “ My Lady Glin useth her Venison Pasties” in such and such a fashion; in a third, that “ this is the way the Countess de Penalva makes Portuguez eggs for the Queen.” The adjectives have the value of a personal recommendation: “ The most kindley way to preserve plums, cherries, and goose- berries ; ” “A most Excellent Sirup of Violets both in taste and tincture; ” “ A singular Manner of making the Sirup of Roses; ” “ another sort of Marmalade very com- fortable for any Lord or Lady Whatsoever; ” “ An ex- cellent conceit upon the kernels of dry Walnuts.” The medicines receive equal tenderness: “An exceeding fine Pill used for the Gout; ” “ a delicate Stove to sweat in;” “ The Gift of God, praise be to Him, for all manners of sores; ” “A Precious W ater to Revive the Spirits.” Who would not swallow a dozen such pills and gifts and wa- ters, or sweat a dozen times in such a stove, without a murmur! But it is the confidential manner that I adore.

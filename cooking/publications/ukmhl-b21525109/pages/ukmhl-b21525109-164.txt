NOTE It will be understood, of course, that I do not aim at an exhaustive Bibliography. I have attempted nothing more ambitious than a list of my own books, and even that within limits. I have thought it better, and more in keeping with the text, to bring it no fur- ther down than to the end of the Eighteenth Century. For this reason, I have omitted Eighteenth Century books that I have only in Nineteenth Century editions, and also modern reprints of early MSS. I have made an exception in favor of Grimod de la Reyniereâ€™s Almanach des Gourmands, simply because it marks the beginning of the new period, and helps to explain the limits I have deliberately set myself. Some day, I may be able to make as worthy a record of my Nineteenth Century books.

9 Forme of Cury and the Liber Cure Cocorum and the Noble Book of Cookery, and the rest, they are to be classed with Charles Lamb’s books that are not books, so difficult are they to all but the expert. Unfortu- nately, I have none of the sixteenth-century English books, of which Hazlitt gives a list of eight. Perhaps they were issued in very small editions; more proba- bly, they were so popular that, like the early romances from Caxton’s and from Wynkyn de Worde’s press, they were “thumbed out of existence.” After 1600 the supply seems to have been larger, no doubt because of the growing demand, and more copies have survived. Most of the cookery books of the seventeenth century went through several editions; not even Cromwell and the Puritans could check their popularity; and I like to think, when I turn over their thin, soiled, torn pages, that many people read them not solely for information, but for pleasure, like Pepys, that fine summer day when, his wife safe in the country, he carried his ladies to the king’s pleasure boat, and then down the river, between the great wharves and the shipping, “ all the way read- ing in a book of Receipts of making fine meats and sweetmeats . . . which made us good sport.”

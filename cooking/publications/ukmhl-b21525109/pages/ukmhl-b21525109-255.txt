171 limp vellum covers; while to the kindness of a friend — kind- ness for which thanks are a poor return — I owe a copy of L'Arte di Ben Cucinare, by Bartolomeo Stefani, Bologna, 1687. Then, I am tempted to add an American section, three or four irresistible little American Cookery Books having come into my possession of late: among them an American edition of Mrs. Glasse, which, I believe, was absolutely unknown until a generous sympathizer in Baltimore found it in his own library and sent it to me — an unprecedented act of generosity on the part of an abso- lute stranger. But to write of all these treasures would be to rewrite my book. By this unworthy reference to them, I hope at least to give a new proof of the fact that a collection of Cookery Books is not made in a day. But if it were, where would be the pleasure ?

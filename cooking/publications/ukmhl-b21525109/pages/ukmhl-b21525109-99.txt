For a simple “ Fricassy,” you begin with half a dozen chick- ens, half a dozen pigeons, half a dozen sweetbreads, and I should need a page to explain what you finish with for garniture. Fowls disappeared into a lamb or other meat pie by the dozen; a simple leg of mutton must have its garniture of cutlets; twelve pounds of good meat, to say nothing of odd partridges, fowls, turkeys, and ham, went into the making of one stew, — it is something stupendous to read. And then the endless number of dishes in a menu, — the insufferably crowded table. A century before, Pepys had discovered the superior merit of serving<£ but a dish at a time ” when he gave his fine dinner to Lord Sandwich. But the eighteenth-century books continue to publish menus that make Gargan- tua’s appetite seem mere child’s play; their plates “ ex- hibiting the order of placing the different dishes, etc., on the table in the most polite way ” would spoil the ap- petite of the bravest. Forty-three dishes are symmetri- cally arranged for a single course in one of Vincent La 1 “ Swol’d Mutton is a sheep roasted in its Wool,” according to Dr. Lister himself.

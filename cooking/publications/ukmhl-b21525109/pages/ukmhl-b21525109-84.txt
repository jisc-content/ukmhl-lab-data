48 edition), William Verral (A Complete System of Cook- ery, 1759), — all I could name have as irreproachable references. A few were not cooks in service, but teach- ers: Edward Kidder, Pastry-Master, for one, who ran two schools: in Queen Street, near St. Thomas Apostle’s, where he held his classes on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays, and at Furnival’s Inn in Holborn, where he presided on Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays ; he also was willing, kind soul, to teach ladies in their own houses. I respect Kidder as a man of originality, for his Receipts of Pastry and Cookery is unlike any book of the same period. From the frontispiece, where he appears in ample wig, with one hand uplifted as if in exhortation to his class, to the amazing plans for setting and decorating a dinner-table, it is neatly engraved and printed on one side of the page only, the receipts written out in the most beautiful copper-plate writing. He was original in his spelling, too : “ Sauceages,” I consider a gem even in the eighteenth century; and he was surely a forerunner of the modern cockney, when he wrote, “ To roast an Hare.” The ladies were as eager to vouch for their qualifications.

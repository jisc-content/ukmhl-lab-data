19 The compiler of the little vellum-bound Delight is for- ever taking you into his confidence. He revels in hints and innuendoes: “There is a Country Gentlewoman whom I could name, which” does so and so; or “ This of a Kinde Gentlewoman whose skill I doe highly commend and whose case I do greatly pity; ” and you divine all sorts of social mysteries. He has sudden outbursts of generosity: “ I have robbed my wives Dairy of this se- cret, who hath hitherto refused all recompenses that have been offered her by gentlewomen for the same, and had I loved a Cheese myself so well as I like the receipt, I think I could not so easily have imparted the same at this time. And yet, I must needs confesse, that for the better gracing of the Title, wherewith I have fronted this pamphlet, I have been wfilling to publish this with some other secrets of worth, for the which I have been many times refused good store both of crowns and angels. And therefore let no Gentlewoman think this Booke too deare, at what price soever it shall be valued upon the sale thereof, neither can I esteem the worke to be of lesse than twenty years gatherings.” And people think the art of self-advertisement was evolved but yesterday ! Sir Ken- elm Digby is the great master of this confidential style.

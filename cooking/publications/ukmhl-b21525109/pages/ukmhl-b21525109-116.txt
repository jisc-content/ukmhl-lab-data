76 Venice. That, anyway, is in order: title-page in place, the spaces, all except one, tilled with decorative capitals by the wood-cutter; the pages untorn and unsoiled, only mellowed by time to a rich yellow; here and there, on the margin, a note, and once some verses, in beautiful old handwriting; the binding of vellum. I have the fur- ther satisfaction of knowing that it is more complete than any that has come in M. Vicaire’s way. On the title-page there are three titles: Apitii Celii de re Co- quinaria libri decern ; Suetonius Traquillus De Claris Gramaticis; Suetonius Traquillus De Claris Rhetoribus. M. Vicaire calls attention to the fact that the two trea- tises under the heading Suetonius, etc., do not appear. But in my copy they do, combined in one essay. And whenever I am discouraged by the condition of some of my rare books into asking myself whether, after all, they are anything more than Mr. Lang’s “ twopenny trea- sures,” a glance at the 1486 Apicius restores my confi- dence in my collection. When I consider what the mere possession of the book Judging the books by their appearance, I should say the 1498 edi- tion was far the earlier. Certainly it is the first with a date, and, I am happy to say, is excessively rare.

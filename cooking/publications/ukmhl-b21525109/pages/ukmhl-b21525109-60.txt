28 of Lord Lovelace, contributed to Sir Kenelm Digby’s collection of recipes. “ The Maecenas’s and Patrons of this Generous Art,” May calls them, in a rhetorical out- burst. Rabisha, on the other hand, pays his tribute to two “ illustrious duchesses,” and three “ renowned, sin- gular good, and vertuous Ladies,” to whose “ boundless unspeakable virtues ” he would do the honor that in him lies. May was the “most humbly devoted servant to their Lordships,” and Rabisha the “ poor, unworthy ser- vant till death ” of their graces and ladyships. But this was mere posing. The real man in May comes out when he addresses as “Most Worthy Artists” the master cooks and young practitioners to whom he hopes his book will be useful; when he explains that he writes because “God and my own Conscience would not permit me to bury these my Experiences with my Silver Hairs in the Grave” No one shall say of him that he “hid his Candle under a Bushel.” It is the real Rabisha who dwells upon the “ Many years study and practice in the Art and Mysterie of Cookery ” that are his qualifications as author, and the duty of “ the ingenious men of all Arts and Sciences to hold forth to Posterity what light or knowledge ” they imderstand to be obscure in their art.

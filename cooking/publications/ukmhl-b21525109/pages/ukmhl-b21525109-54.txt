24 cers of the Mouth receive their instructions, and irre- sistible little cuts of birds of strange shape, and joints of no shape at all, devices for pies and pastry, are intro- duced as a guide to the Carver and Sewer. Nothing is neglected, from the building up of those magnificent — the adjective is May’s — triumphs and trophies, those subtleties, as elaborate as Inigo Jones’s setting of a masque, that were “ the delights of the Nobility,” to the folding of “ all sorts of Table-linen in all sorts of Fig- ures, a neat and gentill Art,” much in vogue. And throughout, the writer never forgets his own impor- tance. He is as serious as Montaigne’s Italian chef, who talked of cooking with the gravity of the theologian and in the language of the statesman. Ilis style is as fan- tastic as that of the cook in Howell’s letter to Lady Cot- tington. He “will tell your Ladyship,” Howell writes, “ that the reverend Matron, the Otta podridci hath Intel- lectuals and Senses; Mutton, Beef, and Bacon are to her as the Will, Understanding, and Memory are to the Soul; Cabbages, Turnips, Artichokes, Potatoes, and Dates are her five Senses, and Pepper the Common-sense; she must have Marrow to keep Life in her, and some Birds to make her light; by all means she must go adorned with Chains of Sausages.”

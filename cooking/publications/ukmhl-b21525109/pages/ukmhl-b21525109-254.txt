170 Nuevo Arte de Cocina by Juan Altimiras: one, the oldest, published at Barcelona in 1758, one published in the same town but without a date, and one issued from a Madrid publishing house, as late as 1817. I have two more editions of the Arte de Cocina by Fran- cisco Martinez Montino: one, vellum-covered, published at Bar- celona in 1763, and one in 1823. I have another and very much earlier Arte de Reposteria by Juan de la Mata, Madrid, 1747. And I can also boast a copy of the curious Arte Cisoria, O Tratado del Arte del Cortar del Cuchillo, by the Marques de Villena, an im- mensely interesting old 15th century treatise, published in 1766, from the original in the Royal Library of the Escorial; and a hardly less interesting Tratado de Los Usos, Abusos, Rropiedes, y Virtudes del Tabaco, Cafe, Te, y Chocolate, edited from various sources by Don Antonio Lavedan, and published at Madrid in 1796 — a book that even M. Yicaire does not seem to know any- thing about. While I am in the way of boasting, I think I shall be found more than justified if I record the most precious, bibliographically, of all my recent acquisitions — a copy of Platina’s Be Honesta Voluptate, the earliest of all printed Cookery Books that I, at least, know anything about. Mine is not the first edition, which is reserved only for the Rothschilds among collectors, but it is fairly early — 1503 — in beautiful condition, with the date given at the end, and spaces left for the capitals almost throughout. I count myself fortunate, too, in a delightful little copy of Baldassare Pisanelli’s Trattato della Natura de Cibi, et del Bere; Yenice, 1601, in old

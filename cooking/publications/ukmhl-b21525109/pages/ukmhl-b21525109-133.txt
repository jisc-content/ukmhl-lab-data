87 rowed, I attribute these signs of care to his despair over the Pope’s hair shirt and all it stood for. He himself shared the ideal of his contemporaries. Not one could sur- pass him in the ceremonial banquet he prepared for the “ Coronation ” of Pius V., or for Cardinals in Conclave; not one could equal him in the more informal feasts he suggested for an August fast day after vespers in a vine- yard, or for a May afternoon in a garden of the Traste- vere,or for the cool of a June evening in Cardinal Carpi’s vineyard on Monte Cavallo. And there is the intimate charm of the u petits soupers ” of the French court a couple of centuries later in his light collations served, one at an early hour of a cold December morning after a performance of Plautus, another at Cardinal Bellaia’s after a diverting comedy played in French, Spanish, Ven- etian, and Bergamesque. Whatever Pope Pius might do, Scappi kept up the best traditions of the Vatican. His book has the further merit of taking one behind the scenes; in an unrivaled series of illustrations,it shows the Vatican kitchen, airy and spacious as he says a kitchen should be, the Vatican scullery, cellar, and dairy, and every pot, pan, and conceivable utensil a Papal or any other cook could ever be in need of.

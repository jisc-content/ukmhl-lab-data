Sounds might have re- mained mere noise but for the musician, colors mere discord but for the painter ; eating woidd never have been more than a gross necessity but for the gourmet. “ 11 font manger avec esprit,” says a French authority, and to do so requires the thought and enthusiasm that the musician or painter gives to his art.

It would be more to the purpose to explain why the historian and the philosopher have hitherto paid so little heed to the subject.

107 monplace. There is a little Arte de Reposteria, by Juan de la Mata, Madrid, 1791, a small quarto in vellum covers that gives a whole chapter to the Aguas Heladas de Frutas, still one of the joys of Spain, and a recipe for Gazpachos, still one of its wonders. There is the Di- sertacion en Recomendacion y Defensa del Famoso Vino Malagueno Pero Ximen, Malaga, 1792, with a wood-en- graved frontispiece that looks like the beginning of the now familiar cigar-box labels. But the other big and little volumes are of too late a date for my present pur- poses. Many are translations of the French books of 1830, and they reproduce even the lithographs and other illustrations published in the original works. Of course, it will be understood that I write solely of the books in my own collection, which I am not foolish enough to represent as exhaustive. Indeed, if I were, M. Yicaireâ€™s Bibliography would betray me at once. But for the collector the evil hour is when, folding his hands, he must admit his task completed. As long as there are gaps on my shelves, life will still hold the pos- sibility of emotion.

153 London: Printed for the Author ; and sold at Mrs. Ashburn's, a China-Shop Corner of Fleet-Ditch. 1747. Folio, modern morocco. Title, List of Subscribers, and Table, 8 leaves + pp. 166. Interleaved with modern paper; on the first four leaves, four newspaper clippings pasted in by G. A. Sala. Written on fly-leaf, “ This is a copy of the First Edition of the famous Cookery Book written by Mrs Hannah Glasse (the authorship of which was erroneously ascribed by Dr. Johnson — see Boswell’s Life — to Dr. Hill) Mrs Glasse, however, was a real personage ‘ Habit Maker to the Royal Family ’ and lived in Southampton Row, Bloomsbury — Observe in the list of Subscribers the name of Mr Glasse, attorney at law, and Mrs Glasse, Carey St. These were probably of close kin- dred to Hannah. Subsequent editions bear on tbe title page a fac-simile of H. G.’s autograph. There are (July 1876) only Four Copies of this First Edition (a ‘ pot ’ folio) known to be in existence, viz: One in the Library of the British Museum — One in the Bodleian Library, Oxford. One in the possession of the Rev. Richard Hooper of Upton Rectory, Didcot — and One (hie inventus adest) belonging to George Augustus Sala. 46 Mecklenburgh Square. W. C. London.” Since the book has been mine, I have seen two additional copies advertised in booksellers’ catalogues. I am afraid Sala had not read his “ Boswell ” very carefully. His reference to Dr. Johnson is not quite accurate.

It is cut very much the same in England as it is abroad ; the saddle and the loin are frequently used together as one large joint, though they can be taken separately as with beef, &c. Many parts practically untouched in this country can be successfully treated as entrees. Mutton is also considered more digestible than beef, veal, or pork, hence it is often in greater request. The leg, one of the staple joints, should be the subject of greater efforts at variety ; even the plain roasting and boiling can be effected with little differences, and made more succulent, if not absolutely uncommon. The modes to which the Continental cook resorts to achieve this purpose are very cleverly varied, and the results are delicious.

The fact that the leg can be halved at home, or that either end can be purchased from the butcher when

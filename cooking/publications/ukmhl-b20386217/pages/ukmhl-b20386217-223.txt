207 Salads boiled till tender, duly strained, and, when cold, seasoned in the accepted manner. Salade de Campagne (Country Salad).—This is essen- tially a winter dish. Finely slice a small fresh red cabbage with a very sharp knife, parboil it for about twenty minutes, let it drain thoroughly, sprinkle it when cold thickly with salt, and stand it aside for four or five hours. Finely slice some cold but freshly-boiled potatoes, strain the cabbage again, mix it with the potatoes, add some chopped onions, chopped tarragon and chives, and season rather freely. This may be eaten hot or cold according to taste. If hot, the potatoes must be used as soon as they are boiled, and the cabbage can be quickly heated au bain-marie. Cucumbers are, as we all know, well suited for dressing in the same fashion, and are excellent whether used alone or mixed with other things; they are considered unwholesome, or at any rate difficult of digestion, by a number of people. There is, however, a secret in preparing the same; they must, of course, be sliced very fine—in fact, much more so than is usual. This operation should take place at least two hours before the cucumber is to be served ; during this time it should be placed in a colander, thickly sprinkled with salt, and weighted with a plate or saucer small enough to " give" as the cucumber sinks lower. In this way the vegetable loses a great deal of the moisture which makes it unwholesome, and also takes the dressing much more easily. Potatoes and celery go well together and make a delicious warm salad. When ready sliced in a hot bowl, moisten with a little good hot stock, and have ready the dressing so that the dish can be sent in whilst still warm. Mix the dressing thus : Pound a small hot potato in the mortar with the yolks of two hard-boiled eggs, salt this to taste, add a pinch of black pepper and one of cayenne pepper, stir into this three tablespoonfuls

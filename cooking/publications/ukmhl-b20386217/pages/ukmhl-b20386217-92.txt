j6 Dainty Meals for Small Households the larger part of the year, it is excellent from October to March, and hardly obtainable in June ; whitebait, March to August; whiting, from September to March at its best, but to be had nearly all the year round. Oysters, as everyone knows by the popular saying, are not to be eaten during the months in which there is no ur" ; in buying them it is well not to be anxious for great economy, especially since certain diseases have been said to result from the poor condition of this shellfish. When tinned, they should be avoided, by invalids above all. This remark as to the season for oysters is applicable to most shellfish, which is at its best from October to April. Crabs are good from May to August. Lobster is in season from February to October, and mussels from September to March. This list, as I observed above, is by no means a complete enumeration of edible fish, but touches principally on those for the preparation of which recipes shall follow in these pages. For the benefit of those who are fortunate enough to be owners of good streams or fish-ponds, or are otherwise in the way of obtaining fish as soon as it is caught, a few remarks as to the best ways of treating it may not be amiss here. After scaling the fish (which should be done quickly with a sharp knife), it must be split open carefully to be cleaned out, and in doing this be careful to remove all the gall; then rinse it out thoroughly, and rub it over with salt to remove all superfluous moisture that may adhere to it, but never lay it or let it stand in plain water. If it is only required to keep for a day or twenty- four hours, for instance, wrap it in a clean cloth previously wrung out in strong salt and water ; the cloth for this purpose should not be too large, but should merely wrap round the fish; abroad, in the neighbourhood of good fishing places especially, the kitchen linen cupboard contains cloths of various sizes kept for this one purpose.

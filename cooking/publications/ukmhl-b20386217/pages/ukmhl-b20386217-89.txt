Sauces 73 faire generally keeps in stock. It is easily made :—Peel a garlic root, chop it and pound it, soak it in water for half an hour, then press it through a sieve; bottle this essence, and use it very sparingly. Essence of Anchovies is also a very useful preparation^ and can be made at home very satisfactorily. Bone twelve anchovies, and put aside the liquor that drains from them. Boil them in a tumblerful of water, until they are quite dissolved; strain and put into a small bottle. Cork and keep in a cool place ; this will last a long time, and a very few drops will flavour any sauce or stew. Another excellent reserve flavouring for all kinds of dishes can be made thus :—Put into a stone pot about one pint of white wine, two tablespoonfuls of wine vinegar, nearly a quarter of a pound of salt, a teaspoonful of white and black peppercorns respectively, half a dozen cloves, a pinch of nutmeg, half a dozen morels, four bay- leaves, ten crushed shallots, a handful of parsley, garlic according to taste, a teaspoonful of coriander seed, one sliced carrot, one large sliced onion, two sprigs of thyme, six of chervil, the tops of a head of celery, and two or three sprigs of tarragon; let this boil over the fire, then let it simmer gently without boiling on some hot embers for at least six or seven hours. Strain it through a cloth, and store in small bottles. A few drops will make delicious and very effective flavouring at any time when it is not easy to obtain the usual necessary ingredients. Note the difference between gravy and sauce; the former (French jus) is the juice or extract running from the meat under treatment. Gravy, as the word is applied to a mixture compounded from several ingre- dients, especially flour or other thickening, colourings, &c, is no longer the French jus.

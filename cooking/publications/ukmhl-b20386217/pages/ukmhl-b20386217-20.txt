4 Dainty Meals for Small Households restaurant, or on festive occasions, hors d'ceuvre are introduced; this constitutes the daily fare of the middle classes, and therefore of numbers of clerks' families, Government officials, and others, whose incomes in this country would be considered very moderate. This state- ment of mine is not the result of hearsay, but of actual knowledge of the facts of the case. Since many articles of food are both better and cheaper in England than abroad, it should be by no means impossible to bring about such an improvement in average English fare as should raise it to the level of the dainty meals over which our foreign neighbours daily rejoice. It is in the hope of doing something to advance this desirable consummation that I am offering here some practical suggestions which can be carried out by any housewife (however small her establishment) in the following series of recipes. It is often urged by those who have never made any serious attempt to bring a desirable change and variety in their daily dishes, that the cuisine bourgeoise only consists of a collection of small dishes generally made from cold remains, not very nourishing, and that " at any rate people who only keep two servants for instance, could never expect two or three courses exclusive of sweets, to be placed before them every day." The only answer to make to such remarks is a gentle reminder that in most moderate households in France and on the Continent, there is only a bonne a toutfaire) and certainly rarely more than two maids. The former, unlike her English sister (the general servant), is an early riser, a good cook, presentable at almost any time of the day, and the sole producer of the modest, perhaps, but varied and delicious little menus which I should like to see put into practice among those who realize that variety in food is as necessary to the body as change of air and scene to the over-worked mind.

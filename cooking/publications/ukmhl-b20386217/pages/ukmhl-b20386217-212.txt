Pare them straight to make them stand, without actually cutting into the edible part; remove all the central bluish leaves, and through the opening thus provided cut out all the " choke " with a cutter or a sharp iron spoon. When the inside is per- fectly free from everything except the leaves, fill the opening with a duxelle (see below), put a trimmed slice of bacon over each artichoke, tie them down so that they cannot fall to pieces or become disarranged, and put them into a saucepan lined with slices of bacon, sliced onions and carrots previously heated in some fat. Stand the sauce- pan over the fire, cover, let them simmer a few minutes, then pour in equal quantities of white wine and stock to one-third of the height of the artichokes. Let the con- tents of the saucepan simmer gently for some time with the lid on until the liquor has been greatly reduced (by about two-thirds). Remove the artichokes, take off the string, dish them up, strain the liquor, skim off the fat, put it back over the fire (meantime keeping the artichokes hot) ; add a little roux brun and half an eggspoonful of Liebig's extract of meat; finally stir in a piece of butter, some chopped parsley, and a few drops of lemon juice. Pour over the artichokes and serve. Make the duxelle as follows, but, if more convenient, use any other kind of stuffing for the artichokes, such as chopped remains of cold chicken, onions, parsley, mushrooms, olives, &c.

Sardines au Gratin.—Split up the sardines underneath the body from head to tail, remove the head and the backbone, but do not break the fish, fill them with a fish quenelle mixture, sprinkled with finely-chopped herbs, season well, and press them again into their original shape. Have ready a fireproof china dish, and in it brown two large tablespoonfuls of chopped mushrooms and onions in oil, arrange the sardines over the latter mixture, cover them with chopped parsley and mush- rooms ; sprinkle them thickly with breadcrumbs, cover with a little oil, and add three or four tablespoonfuls of white cooking wine, set it over the fire till the liquor boils, and bake in a moderate oven about fifteen or twenty minutes. Just before serving in the same dish, pour some tomato sauce over the top. Cro&tes Marguerite.—Boil some eggs hard, throw them into cold water so that the white may not be discoloured, shell them and cut them into slices. Chop up some parsley, chives, and a sprig of tarragon leaves ; pound them in a mortar previously rubbed with a little garlic, with sufficient butter to form a smooth paste. Make sandwiches with two slices of the hard-boiled eggs, spread these with the paste ; have ready some fancifully shaped pieces of crisp thin fried toast, butter them, put a sandwich on each piece, sprinkle with cayenne and salt ; bake or fry them quickly to make them very hot, and serve. Champignons Farcis (Stuffed Mushrooms).—Take a few average-sized mushrooms, peel and trim them ; chop up the trimmings and a couple of the mushrooms whole with a small onion, and a sprig of parsley and tarragon.

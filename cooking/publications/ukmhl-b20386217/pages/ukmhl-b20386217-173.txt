Pork 157 while still immersed ; this also helps to keep the meat tender. Jambon Roti (Roast Ham).â€”Choose a moderate-sized ham, not too large, remove as much of the bone as possible without spoiling the shape of the joint ; peel off the rind and some of the fat, so that only a layer of less than a quarter of an inch remains ; trim the joint, giving it a nicely rounded shape, and soak it for two days in a good pickling mixture ; this should consist of equal parts of red wine and water, of coarse common salt (in the propor- tion of lib. to every three and a half pints of wine and water), a small pinch of saltpetre, and an infusion of sage, rosemary, and lavender. After two days take out the ham, wash it freely in plenty of cold fresh water, dry it, tie it round with large strips of bacon rind, and roast or rather bake it in an oven till tender, basting frequently with old white wine. Set it aside so that the outside may cool sufficiently to be covered with mayonnaise sauce. The inside will, of course, still remain hot. Or the sauce may be sent in separately. Small fresh hams make excellent roast joints. Remove the skin, but leave the fat ; soak it for two or three days in oil, with salt, pepper, a sprig or two of sage, an onion, and a bottle of good white wine. Roast it before the fire if possible, or in a gas oven, basting very frequently with the liquor in which it was pickled. Serve it with a sauce made from equal parts of good gravy and of the basting mixture, with a sprinkling of chopped shallots.

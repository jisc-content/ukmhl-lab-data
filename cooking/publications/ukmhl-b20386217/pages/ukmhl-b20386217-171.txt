Cover with bacon rind, bake in the oven for at least three hours ; stand it aside till cold, then turn it out and garnish it suitably with hard-boiled eggs, olives, aspic jelly, parsley, &c. It will keep some time in cold weather, and makes excel- lent sandwiches.

When the ham has been put into this preparation, weight down the lid of the tub, and leave it to soak for fifteen days if small, for twenty if large. Then lay it in fresh water for two hours, brush it with a moderately stiff brush, and hang it in a well- aired room for a fortnight. This drying is essential to the good flavour and proper colouring of the meat. Hams can be kept in a salted state without being smoked at all; in this case, however, it is preferable not to wash them before hanging them up to dry. Naturally, the meat loses some of its good qualities with prolonged immersion, so that it is well to know how far the process is inevitable. As a rule, unless the ham is old, long personal experience has taught me that it is decidedly better to abstain from soaking altogether, but of course it is a matter which every housewife must decide for herself; in any case the ham (or any other

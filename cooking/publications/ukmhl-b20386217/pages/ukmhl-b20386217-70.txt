54 Dainty Meals for Small Households Chervil has the same properties as the above herb, except that it is much more delicate in taste, and milder in flavour. Garlic, onions, leeks, shalots, chives, celery, and bay-leaves all claim some part in the seasoning of sauces as the case may be, and variety is a thing which should never be despised. Other plants, such as thyme, mint, marjoram, basil, rosemary, and sage are useful in many cases. The best plan is to obtain them from some country garden or gardener, and to dry, pound, and store them oneself in well-stoppered glass bottles ; in this manner it is possible to ensure perfection, especially if the provision be renewed every autumn, as it should be in well-regulated households. Finally, mushrooms, either dried or in powder (preferably both), should be found in every store-room ; they are available at very moderate cost, and absolutely necessary to many ordinary dishes. More than any other branch of cookery, sauces require careful and common-sense treatment, great attention to detail, and no mechanical work. First, the needful moisture must be produced to make some firm substance more palatable, then the sauce must refine and increase the flavour of the dish to which it is destined, and it must also, if possible, make the latter more nourishing and more digestible. No art is complete without its definite purpose, to which rule cookery is no exception ; and one of the secrets of success is to keep one main object in view. We have already stated that the sauce must harmonize with the dish for which it is intended, and that can only take place if the sauce partakes, in some measure, of the nature of the thing it is to accom- pany ; though in some cases decided contrasts (such as cranberry sauce with game, or strawberry sauce with fowl) are advisable, and as much sought after by the good cook as they would be by the artist.

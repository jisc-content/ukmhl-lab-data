55 Sauces Always guard against burning ; one moment's inat- tention will ruin the best ingredients ; for this reason the side-stove for charcoal, or embers, has its obvious advantages over the ordinary fire, which is often very fierce ; let the stirring always be even (especially where flour has been used), and always in the same direction ; gas, of course, is safe to use. Before giving the actual recipes, a word must be said about various liaisons—viz. approved thickening for sauces, the object of which is to bring the sauce to a proper consistency ; on this the success of the whole dish often depends, and although in actually operating it is usually the last thing added, it is advisable to put it first on our list. Without attempting to soar to the mysteries of high- class cookery, it will be sufficient for our purpose to mention the four principal liaisons :— Liaison a Tallemande.—This is made separately over the fire, with flour dissolved either in water, milk, or stock, as the case may be, and in varying proportions. It should be strained through a hair sieve, and is added to the sauce under treatment by being steadily and slowly poured into the latter, stirring briskly all the time, and for five or six minutes in all, with a wooden ladle. Liaison au Roux.—Consists of flour and butter, cooked over a very slack fire, in order to obtain the required dark colour without any risk of burning, or otherwise impairing the taste. Contrary to the above- mentioned sauce, this is usually made beforehand, and kept for use as required. When the above ingredients have attained the right colour, moisten with stock, stirring briskly until the mixture boils ; stand it aside to simmer for an hour, remove the fat, and strain into a gallipot to store it till wanted. It is best to make a little at a time, and to store it in a cool place. It can be mixed

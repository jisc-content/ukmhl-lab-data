Fish 107 for about an hour. Strain them again. Have ready in a small saucepan some sliced onions browned in butter, put in the snails, cover them with equal quantities of white wine and water, let this boil up once, thicken with a little roux blond, and boil gently for five minutes. Just before serving stir in one or two yolks of egg, a sprinkling of lemon, and a tablespoonful of finely chopped parsley and chervil mixed. a la Bordelaise.â€”Prepare as above, straining the snails twice ; wash the shells thoroughly, and stand them in a warm place to dry; work into a lump of fresh butter some parsley, shallot, and garlic (all well chopped), seasoned with salt and pepper and a little cayenne. Put into each shell a little of this butter mixture, then the snail, and cover it with a layer of butter. Put the shells into a fireproof dish, sprinkle them with breadcrumb, a little white wine, and some butter. Bake in the oven for ten minutes, and serve very hot in the same dish. Kedgeree is such a useful breakfast dish that I must give it here, though it is by no means uncommon. It is generally made either from fresh fish, cold remains, or smoked fish, and the latter is far more tasty, though less often used. The process is the same in any case, though the smoked material requires rather less seasoning. Flake the fish (dried haddock for instance), remove the skin and bones, if it is uncooked, turn it over, on the fire, in a little butter, with salt and pepper to taste. Have ready, in a suitable saucepan, some rice, boiled and strained (in the proportion of one teacupful to two breakfast-cupfuls of flaked fish), and into this mix three or four hard-boiled eggs, well chopped, a pinch of chopped parsley, and enough anchovy sauce to taste. Stir in the fish, add a little butter, stir over a brisk fire, and serve very hot.1 1 For the Indian recipe, see p. 121.

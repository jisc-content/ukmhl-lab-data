Fish 103 delicious. Here are a few ways of preparing them. It should be remembered that in every case the fish should be put to boil while it is still living, unless the fishmonger is absolutely to be depended upon. It is most important that this should be perfectly fresh ; they are at their best from June till the autumn, and the favourite kind have a reddish tinge under the claws; this depends on the water in which they have lived, since the faster the stream the better the fish. To keep them alive till wanted, they should be put into a bucket deep enough to obviate the possibility of their crawling up the sides, and on a bed of thick grass and nettles. Water may be put in to about the depth of an inch, but this is not really necessary, and, if it is used, must be very frequently changed ; the bucket must be left without a cover, and in a cool place. To clean crayfish, remove a small fin from the middle of the tail, which holds the black and bitter part, and rinse it in two or three waters. Ecrevisses a la Provencale.—Boil the necessary number of crayfish in a good white wine court-bouillon, with plenty of aromatic herbs, a clove of garlic, and a slice of ham. Strain off the liquor into a saucepan, put it over the fire, add some consomme, and reduce to a half glaze ; add six tablespoonfuls of tomato sauce. Draw the saucepan a little aside, and let the contents boil gently for a few minutes ; then put in a pinch of cayenne and nearly a Jib. of fresh butter, in small pieces the size of a nut. Arrange the crayfish en buisson on a dish, and serve the sauce separately. There are special stands for serving up crayfish. To make the buisson, they are piled up in the shape of a pyramid, showing the backs, the tails extended, and, of course, heads uppermost. a la Polonaise.—Put two or three dozen crayfish into a saucepan with some vinegar, salt, pepper, an onion, and a bouquet of parsley and fennel: boil for eight minutes

Entries 119 Foie de Veau en Sauce (Calves' Liver).—Cut into slices about a pound of liver, sprinkling these with flour. Put two large chopped-up onions into a pan and slightly brown them in butter, then put in the liver, let it become thoroughly heated; now add some stock (enough to thoroughly moisten the meat), pepper and salt, and some chopped mushrooms or morels, and let this cook fairly slowly for half an hour; the meat should then be quite tender. Stir the yolks of two eggs in a little stock, add a small handful of chopped parsley and chives (or the green part of some spring onions), a small piece of butter, and a squeeze of lemon. Pour this slowly into the saucepan containing the liver, stirring the gravy steadily all the time, and until it has boiled up once; then serve in an entree dish with potatoes sautees. Grille (Grilled).—This makes an excellent entree and a convenient breakfast dish. Cut in slices as above, rub in some pepper and salt, put them on the gridiron ; fry a few slices of bacon rather crisp. Serve the liver, always putting two pieces together with a slice of bacon, sprinkled with butter and chopped parsley, in between, forming a sort of bacon sandwich. A garniture of vege- table marrow, or stewed cucumber, or pickled gherkins all make a pleasant accompaniment to this simple but delicious dish. Cotelettes de Veau (Veal Chops) a la Bordelaise.—These must not be confused with what English cooks call veal cutlets. These, in the French cuisine, consist of slices of the fillet prepared in various ways. The French cotelette is a chop pure and simple, and is both good and useful for entrees. Choose them not too large, trim them to look dainty, chopping off part of the bone if necessary ; rub them well over with salt, pepper, and a pinch of grated nutmeg; chop up a slice of bacon, one shallot, a sprig or two of parsley and tarragon, stir into this one

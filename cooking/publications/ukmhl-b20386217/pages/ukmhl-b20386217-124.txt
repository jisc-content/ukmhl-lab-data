io8 Dainty Meals for Small Households One subject more, and the chapter on fish will be done with. Having mentioned such an essentially Continental article as the preceding, a recipe or two must be added for preparing frogs, for which there are as enthusiastic amateurs as for the more aristocratic oyster. Grenouilles Frites (Fried Frogs).—This is a very Parisian dish, in which the well-known Duval and other restaurants excel. Truss, clean, and strain the frogs ; put them into a pie dish, with salt, pepper, vinegar, parsley, thyme, and bay-leaves, for a couple of hours. Cut them in half, or not, as desired, dip them in a good batter, and fry in boiling lard or butter. a la Poulette.—Prepare them as above as far as the cleaning goes, but do not soak them in pickling mixture. After cutting them in half, place them in a small saucepan with a piece of butter. When it is hot add a tablespoonful of flour, salt and pepper to taste, a pinch of cayenne, a pinch of grated nutmeg, and some chopped shallots, and moisten with white wine. Let this mixture boil slowly until the frogs are tender ; thicken the sauce at the last moment with the yolks of two eggs, stir in a little piece of butter and some finely- chopped parsley, and serve very hot.

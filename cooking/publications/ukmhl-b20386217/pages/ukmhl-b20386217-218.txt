202 Dainty Meals for Small Households size, sprinkle them with salt, and sautez them in some hot fat till the moisture has been absorbed ; stir into these three or four whole eggs well beaten, and add the potatoes, previously boiled and cut in slices (they should not be allowed to cool after the boiling). With this mixture fill a buttered fireproof dish or shape, and let it cook au bain-marie for at least twenty-five minutes ; turn it out and serve at once. For one breakfast-cupful of mushrooms and potatoes respectively two eggs would be required, and so on. a la Lyonnaise.—Slightly brown, in hot fat, one or two finely sliced onions ; when they are of a good colour, add the potatoes, previously boiled in salted water, and cut in small pieces ; sautez them till they are brown. Serve very hot, with crushed fried parsley. a la Savoyarde.—Finely slice three large potatoes, put them into a basin with plenty of salt and pepper, a pinch of grated nutmeg, and a whole egg well beaten. Add 2oz. of grated cheese and nearly half a pint of boiled milk, and well mix these ingredients. Pour them into a fireproof dish of suitable size and shape (previously rubbed with garlic), sprinkle with more grated cheese, lay some tiny pieces of butter over the top, and bake in a moderate oven for at least forty minutes. This is (in England at any rate) a most uncommon dish, but it is a delicious one. The quantities can, of course, be in- creased proportionately. The above suffice for three or four persons. au Gratin.—Peel and boil the potatoes, crush them in a mortar, stir in one or two whole eggs pre- viously beaten, and a small piece of butter, and moisten with a little milk. Butter a fireproof or gratin dish, pour in the above puree, sprinkle with breadcrumbs and a few tiny pieces of butter, and gratinez it in the oven till a good colour. It must be sent to table very hot.

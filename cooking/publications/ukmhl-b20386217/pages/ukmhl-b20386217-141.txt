125 Beef flavour ; also some carrots, a turnip, three or four leeks, a couple of pieces of celery, one onion studded with six cloves, and a few sprigs of parsley. The whole secret of making good pot au feu to advantage—i.e. so as to be able to utilize the meat afterwards without finding it hard and tasteless—lies in letting the simmering proceed very slowly, and as long as possible. After the first " boil," which should on no account be hastened, skim- ming must be continued regularly as often as necessary. The proportion of meat and water is generally reckoned thus : about lib. of meat to every pint and a half of water. Two other points should be well observed—the lid of the pot must not be put down tightly until the contents have boiled and most of the necessary skimming has taken place, and it is advisable to add the vegetables above mentioned at this particular moment also, after which cover the pot, and uncover it only to see whether any scum has risen to the surface. According to the size of the joint, the time allowed must vary from three hours upwards, and the fire should be kept as evenly slack as possible, so that only gentle simmering takes place. The meat, being cooked and quite tender, should be served on a very hot dish with a garniture of potatoes mashed with milk or a little cream, young carrots sliced and boiled, with a sprinkling of parsley (or chervil), together with a few small spring onions, green stalks and all, chopped extremely fine ; a sauce piquante should be the accompaniment to this homely but decidedly excel- lent change in the menu. The Continental "boeuf a la mode " brings in the convenient use of the less favoured part of the animal, which, however, can be served as daintily as primer u cuts." The meat of the upper part of the shin, or some of the rump are generally used ; beat it, rub a little salad oil, salt, and pepper all over it, and lard it well.

Send it to table with a cherry sauce, made as follows:â€”Soak two handfuls of black dried cherries, pound them, stones and all, and mix them with a tumblerful of red wine ; put this over a fire in a pipkin, with a little cinnamon, salt, two or three cloves, and the grated rind of a quarter of a small lemon ; let it boil for two minutes, thicken it with some fecula dissolved in a little water, cover it up, draw it aside, and let it simmer for a quarter of an hour, then strain and serve. The boar's leg can also be done in this way, without remov- ing the bone, except by cutting it off at the knuckle, or it can be removed and replaced by suitable stuffing. Finally, it must be remembered that all kinds of delicious entrees can be made with fillets and cutlets of roebuck, the former being taken from the loin, the latter from the neck ; trim them neatly, put them into a saute pan, cover them with strips of bacon, add some truffles or mushrooms chopped, lay some buttered paper over them, and let them stew till tender. They can be served with a variety of garnishes, olives, chestnut puree, spinach, Madeira wine, mushroom cream sauce, straw- berry, cranberry, or red currant sauce. N

Portuguese Apples.—Peel some good sharp apples, core them carefully without making a hole right through, and retaining a small piece with which to cover the aperture after it has been filled as shown below ; fill them either with some kind of thick jam, or with a mixture of pounded sweet almonds, beaten up with a little sugar and lemon juice.

Plain Devonshire cream is the best accompaniment to apples done in this way.

When the mould is turned out, serve with a sauce made with some of the syrup to which two or three tablespoonfuls of rum have been added. Apple Pancakes.—Mix two large spoonfuls of flour quite smooth in a cup of milk or wine, to this add six or seven eggs, some pounded cinnamon, grated lemon peel, a small handful of well-washed currants, and eight apples peeled, cored, and finely chopped.

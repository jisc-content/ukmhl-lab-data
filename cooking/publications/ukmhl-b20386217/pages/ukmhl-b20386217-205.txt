Vegetables cover, and let them stew until they show signs of colouring. Cover them either with good gravy or with an eggspoon- ful of Liebig's extract of meat dissolved in very little water, and an equal quantity of red wine (in either case it is advisable to add a couple of tablespoonfuls of the latter) ; put in a bouquet garni, season, cover, and let the contents simmer slowly over a slack fire until quite tender ; take the onions out carefully, put them into a hot vegetable dish, remove the bouquet, add a pinch of cayenne, and thicken the sauce with a small lump of butter worked with some flour. When quite smooth, pour over the onions and garnish with fried bread.

The mixture should not be too moist. Of course there is no need to give instructions for baking this vegetable ; the operation is simple, but the result is delicious, provided plenty of time be allowed for the operation.

Thus prepared, they can either be sent in well baked and browned, or au gratin, with a sprinkling of breadcrumbs, Parmesan cheese, and butter. Garottes (Garrots).—The small kind so extensively used abroad make delicious dishes; scrape and cut them into small dice (for larger ones use a tiny scoop), and then toss them in hot butter, or good

The flannel will absorb the moisture and considerably lower the tem- perature. To ripen a Camembert cheese, which may be in- sufficiently creamy, put it in a warm place for an hour or so. To harden smoked cod's roe, which may be too soft to grate (this is often useful to vary a savoury), put it in a muslin bag and hang it up in the kitchen for a day or two.

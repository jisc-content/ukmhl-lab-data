The former fault makes the food un- wholesome, and the latter not only wastes the dressing, but makes the material very unpalatable. Another important matter in the question is the oil and vinegar ; if either of these be stale, or otherwise of poor quality, the best material will be spoilt. Excellent oil is by no means an unobtainable luxury. Many good firms keep it, and, as the price is not prohibitive, there is no reason why it should not be used; yet at many well- kept tables one meets with salads dressed with oil which is, to say the least, objectionable, merely through care- lessness.

The same firm also make a speciality of a wonderfully pure vinegar, more particularly suited to persons of delicate digestion, viz. the Lacrima Cristi.

Rub the bowl slightly with a garlic clove, and proceed in either of the following ways :—

Sauces 53 one often mentioned in recipes, is anchovy butter. This is easily prepared; the desired number of anchovies (having been scalded for a minute or two, well cleaned and filleted) are pounded to a paste and mixed with the same quantity of fresh butter; when thoroughly worked together, use according to instructions. The " quatre-epices" so frequently quoted in sauce seasonings are white and black pepper, nutmeg, and cinnamon, the proportions being \ oz. of the two kinds of pepper and cinnamon respectively, to one-third of the quantity of pounded cloves. Pound all these ingredients together, sift them till they are all of the same coarseness, shake them up well, and keep them for use in an air- tight tin box. Ginger, mace, and pimento, used in addition to the above, according to taste or to some given recipe, emphasize the flavour, and are suitable to dishes that are required to be much hotter than the general run of food. As regards herbs, the common fault lies in using too many, or in using a few kinds in too large proportions, hence a rough taste which often mars an otherwise good sauce, and the same remark applies to all kinds of stews, poulettes, ragouts, &c. Parsley especially, possibly be- cause it is generally at hand, goes in indiscriminately, with fatal results, though the cause of the failure, as a rule, remains a mystery to the inexperienced operator. If it is put in as a bouquet it should be taken out some time before serving, or even some moments before strain- ing ; if chopped fine, the quantity should in all cases be very small. By way of a perpetual winter provision, it is a good plan to dry some parsley roots, pound them, and keep them in a tin ; the very smallest quantity of this substance will suffice, and the best way in which to ascertain the exact proportion is to try it and fix it according to the prevailing taste of the establishment.

56 Dainty Meals for Small Households in quantities varying according to necessity, in the pro- portions of a j lb. of fresh butter to f lb. of flour. If the stock is cold, stir it over the fire as above, but if it is hot, take the pan off the fire for a minute or so, and then only stir in the liquid very slowly. Liaison a l'ceuf (or egg thickening).â€”The great secret concerning this particular thickening, which so often fails or causes the sauce to curdle, lies in allowing the mixture to which it is to be added to cool for three or four minutes before it is added. When the eggs have been well beaten up, a little of the sauce should be stirred in, and then only should the egg mixture be poured into the bulk of the sauce ; this should be standing ready over the fire, and must be stirred with a wooden ladle until the liquid just boils. The fourth kind is the butter (or butter and cream thickening) of which I have already spoken whilst treat- ing of soups. Here again there is a fault to be avoided ; this lies in adding the butter too soon ; it should only be put in at the last moment. The last addition of fresh butter for thickening purposes is also intended to impart a certain taste to the sauce or soup concerned, and this would be entirely lost unless it were added just before taking the pan off the fire, to serve its contents. The same remark applies either to butter alone, or to a mixture of butter or cream ; in either case the two must be added just before the pan is removed from the fire. Now for the Sauces-Meres ; first, however, it must be noticed that the allemande thickening recommended above is not the real allemande, one of the chief " sauces-meres." This is the least economical, perhaps, of all the great foundations, and can easily be dispensed with in small households. At the same time, this thickening will, in many cases, be found a valuable substitute for the more elaborate and bona fide substance.

Salads 209 potatoes, one large sour apple, some beetroot, cucumber, and a small pickled gherkin ; to this add some well- washed fresh corn-salad and a sliced onion ; sprinkle with finely-chopped herbs, as shown before, and mix all these ingredients with a good dressing made from the usual materials, adding to the same a few drops of anchovy sauce and a little sour cream. Garnish with stoned olives and hard-boiled eggs. Salade Excentrique.—For this use a mixture of the most dainty or extravagant ingredients that can be pro- cured—artichoke bottoms, asparagus tops, olives, sliced mushrooms, preserved (bottled) salmon with its jelly, or some cold game (either of the latter in very small quantity), capers, one filleted anchovy cut small, chopped herbs, &c. Rub the dish with a little garlic, and mix with a good dressing, to which add a few drops of catsup. aux Harengs (Herring Salad).—Use the ordinary smoked red herring ; warm it so that the skin may come off easily ; lift the flesh carefully off the bones, and soak it in some lukewarm milk, so as to lessen the salt taste. Drain, and cut in small pieces. Finely slice some freshly- boiled potatoes, a couple of good sharp apples, an onion, some beetroot, hard-boiled eggs, and a little chopped endive. Mix this with a strong dressing, arrange nicely in a dish, and garnish with slices of hard-boiled egg and beetroot. P

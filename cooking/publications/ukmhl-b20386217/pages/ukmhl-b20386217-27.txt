Theoretical 11 to use; the quantity of the latter must depend on the size of the articles to be fried ; the more fat there is the more heat will it retain, and it is obvious that the heat must have attained to such a degree as to resist the cool- ing effects of the substance which is to be immersed in the same. That is an apparent trifle which very few people take into consideration, because they do not realize its importance; and yet when one is reminded of the fact and looks at it from a common-sense point of view, it seems a wonder that it is not instinctively carried out. Unless the article under treatment is put into fat which will be hot enough to immediately form the crisp covering required, the result will be poor and unsatisfac- tory ; that is the secret of il sodden " fried fish, of dull and tough fritters, &c. If the material to be fried be put into the fat without allowing for the fact that the sudden addition of a cold substance will arrest the action of the heat, there will naturally be delay, during which the fat will soak into the article under treatment, instead of quickly and crisply enclosing it in a light and dainty manner; and lightness and crispness are the characteristics of a good " friture." It follows from this that vegetables or other substances which are merely to be fried without concentration, will need a lesser quantity of fat, and also of heat ; in fact, only the necessary amount of the former in which to " toss " the contents and to prevent them from adhering to the pan. Court bouillon.—The court bouillon is the liquid used on the Continent for boiling fish, which is rarely prepared in plain water as in this country. Stewing.—This term, alas, is supposed to cover that operation which comprises the French ragoilt; yet the difference which exists between the two is nothing less than appalling to the hungry being who expecting a ragout is presented with an English plain cook's 11 stew "

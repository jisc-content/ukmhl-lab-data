201 Vegetables and moderate the fire (gas is far the best for this opera- tion) ; let them fry for about eight minutes, when the degree of 140 should have been reached. The fat at this point will no longer emit the bubbles caused at first by the evaporation of the moisture, and the potatoes will float, having become slightly inflated. Of course they should be done in the ordinary frying-basket ; remove this, heat the fat to 2000 and plunge the basket in again quickly for a few seconds, when the right swelling will be reached. When they are all ready, leave them in the basket over a strainer, and, one minute before dishing them up, put them once more into boiling fat, drain them quickly, and send them to table immediately. a la Creme Aigre (with Sour Cream).—Cut some cold boiled potatoes into slices, fry them in hot fat, with salt, pepper, and a handful of finely-chopped onions ; when they just begin to colour, drain off some of the fat, pour a half pint or so of sour cream over them, and when this is quite hot, serve with fried sippets. an Jus (in Gravy).—Peel some raw potatoes, and cut them into fairly even dice ; heat some fat in a stew- pan, throw in a few chopped onions, a pinch of chopped parsley, salt, and pepper, and cover with good stock. Put on the lid, let them stew till tender without stirring them at all; most of the stock will now be absorbed. Add a teacupful of good meat gravy and a pinch of grated nut- meg, and serve. en Panade.—Choose potatoes of an even size, wash them well, and boil them without peeling them. When done, remove the skin, cut them in even slices, and dip them in the beaten yolk of egg ; roll them in some fine rusk raspings, and fry a good colour in boiling fat. aux Champignons (with Mushrooms).—Equal quantities of both these vegetables should be reckoned for this dish. Peel and cut the mushrooms to a suitable

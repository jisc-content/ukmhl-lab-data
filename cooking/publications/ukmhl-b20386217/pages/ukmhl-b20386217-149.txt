Besides which, it is possibly from ignorance that they have not been attempted by the ordinary English cook, and they may find favour with many of our readers if the latter care to give these parts of the ox a fair trial. These are the heart, liver, tail, and last, though by no means least, the " gras-double," commonly known as tripe (see Entrees). Now, for such things very careful cooking is required, and if the recipes (suggested by those who have had much experience in the preparation of dishes that are not so well known in this country as in others) are not strictly followed, the result must obviously be unsatisfactory, although the material is not necessarily to be despised. That is what some people who attempt foreign dishes are rather apt to forget ; they lessen the time prescribed for soaking, for instance, or think that the hours required for the proper simmering of a certain item must be exaggerated, or attempt various

Boil them in water with a handful of coarse salt ; when they are a good colour put them into a colander to drain, break off the tails, and remove their shells so that they remain whole ; put them into a bowl with cold water, free the trunks of the crayfish from all impurities, and pound them in a mortar, shells and all, till a soft paste is obtained.

Pound the crayfish paste remaining in the strainer thoroughly once more, after the moisture has completely disappeared, and repeat the whole process, using the strained liquor instead of fresh broth, but adding a little of the latter if necessary to retain the same quantity of soup. Cut some thin slices of bread, steam them in a little butter, and put them into the tureen, with (or without) the beaten yolks of two eggs ; add the tails, some seasoning, and grated nutmeg.

If desired, rice or pearl barley can be used instead of bread,

Fish 83 into the frying-pan, let it melt over the fire till it colours, add a few sprigs of parsley and two tablespoonfuls of vinegar, garnish the fish with the sardines, eggs, &c, and serve very hot with the sauce. Carpe Rotie (Baked Carp).—Clean the fish thoroughly, rub it with salt, and lay it in a baking tin on some sticks of wood, so that it does not touch the bottom ; sprinkle it with the required seasoning of salt, pepper, and a pinch of flour, rub a little butter over it on both sides, add one claret glassful of red wine, and let it bake a good colour, basting it frequently and turning it occasionally. Chop up the roe of the fish, with two or three sardines and one or two anchovies, well boned and filleted; add to these a chopped onion; brown these ingredients over the fire in a little cooking butter, with a sprinkling of flour; stir into this two teacupfuls of boiling stock, the grating of half a lemon, the juice of the same, and a tea- spoonful of capers. When this is ready and smooth serve it with the fish, with part of the sauce in a boat, and the rest on the dish itself. Carpe a la Diable (Cold Carp).—Choose a moderate- sized fish (if it is too large it lasts too long, unless it is intended for many guests); wash and clean it thoroughly, rub it all over with salt; lay it in a large dish, sprinkle more salt over it, and let it stand in a cool place for at least one hour. Lay it in a baking tin as before, only the tin should be rather deep ; pour over the fish a pint of cooking wine, or light ale ; add 3 ozs. or 4 ozs. of lard or cooking butter, a small piece of ginger, the juice of half a lemon, and some sprigs of parsley and tarragon; baste it carefully, turn it over occasionally, and let it bake till tender. Stand it aside till cold; meantime make a sauce as follows:—Boil four eggs hard, pound the yolks, add to this the yolk of one raw egg, stir these in a mortar with china pestle (if possible), and add one after the other

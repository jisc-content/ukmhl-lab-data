140 Dainty Meals for Small Households nearly as possible to what is called in English the chump end, whereas if it is cut crosswise it is termed rouelle. These two are mostly used for the well-known fricandeau, veau a la bourgeoise, &c. The carre corresponds to the longe, viz. to the best end of the loin with the kidney, but that expression is not very often used nowadays in ordinary menus. As I have already suggested elsewhere, it is very useful for the interested housewife to have some idea of the way in which butcher's meat can be divided. The Continental manner of disposing of the same is on the whole more economical and more advan- tageous than the English, and consequently the choice of medium joints more suited to small householders is much more varied. Obviously as long as the majority of people rest content with the large traditional pieces, no change can be expected on the part of the town butchers. But in the country, where the larger part of a small animal would possibly be taken by one house- hold, and where the " killing" is chiefly done for the u big house " of the neighbourhood, it is an easy matter to suggest a little variety in the dividing of the joints, and so put oneself in a position to experiment on un- accustomed recipes. The parts most suited for roasting are the longe and the quasi, but really there is no hard- and-fast rule about it, and almost any style may be attempted as fancy dictates with any available " cut." At the " Boucherie franchise" (Mme. Ursch, 46, Dean Street, Soho, W.) the meat is all cut in the French fashion. To those who are engaged (or merely interested) in cookery, veal, more than any other meat perhaps, fur- nishes an example of the striking difference resulting from careful or indifferent treatment. Almost every joint, as I have tried to show, requires some preliminary seasoning, pickling, or flavouring, as the case may be.

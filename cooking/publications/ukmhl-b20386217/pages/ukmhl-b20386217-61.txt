Soups 45 also plentifully added to ordinary soups and purees, and these are obtainable from all greengrocers in London at the proper time and season, although they are, as a rule, tougher and more stringy than those sold abroad. Other substantial soups in which the commoner vegetables have no part, can be made very successfully on a more economical scale than that indicated in larger and more fashionable cookery books. Soupe aux Champignons (Morel or Mushroom Soup).â€” Have some fresh morels or mushrooms (not too large) and soak them in hot water for half an hour or so ; if they are dried, they will require longer soaking. Mean- time boil an egg hard, chop it up small with some chives, chervil, parsley, marjoram, and a suspicion of mint. Mix these ingredients well together in a small basin, previously slightly rubbed with a garlic root. Take the mushrooms, &c, from the water, squeeze the moisture from them, and cut off the stalks ; make a little opening in the body of the mushroom at the root of the stalk with a sharp scoop or small spoon, and fill the same with the egg stuffing. Arrange them carefully in a stewpan, pour over them some boiling broth, and let them simmer slowly for an hour and a half. Always prepare a little over the real quantity of liquor wanted for the soup to allow for the necessary decrease after long simmering. It is usual to reckon three or four morels or mushrooms to each person, and the number of eggs for stuffing is naturally determined according to the mushrooms, &c. Take the morels out with a strainer, put them into the tureen, pour the liquor over them, and serve with fried bread.

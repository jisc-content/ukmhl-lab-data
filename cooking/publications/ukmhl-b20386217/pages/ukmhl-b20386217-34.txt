i8 Dainty Meals for Small Households potatoes in their jackets, roasting chestnuts, coffee, &c. Earthenware cannot be excelled for the serving of gratins for boiling- milk, chocolate, &c, whilst the miniature pans we may here call " pattikins " provide the correct receptacles for breakfast eggs which are neither fried, poached, nor boiled, but delicious nevertheless. Pie dishes, too, are excellent in this ware. Of the frying-pan I have as yet said nothing, keeping it till the last on account of its importance. Whether it be of common iron, bright steel, daintier aluminium, or plain earthenware, the rules remain the same. First, a separate pan must be reserved for eggs and omelets, another for fish, and a third for bacon and general frying. Secondly, it must never he washed as are other utensils, with soda, boiling water, &c, or it will infallibly burn the substance which it contains. After use it must merely be scoured with a crushed handful of clean paper, the operation being repeated until the paper remains perfectly stainless. If fat has been allowed to stand or settle, put the pan over the fire, pour away the melted fat, and proceed as above. The choice of a refrigerator, which is a certainly neces- sary article where circumstances allow, is an important matter. The "box" shape is the less costly of the two, but the " Cabinet" style is much more advantageous : firstly, because the placing of the ice block is easier, and therefore does not quickly wear out the lining of the space it occupies ; secondly, because it is provided with a tank supplying drinking water. A varied stock of refrigerators is always on view at the Household Supply Company. In conclusion, it is needless to say that every utensil must be subjected to scrupulous and conscientious clean- ing, and that every pan must be partly filled with water as soon as it is put aside after use.

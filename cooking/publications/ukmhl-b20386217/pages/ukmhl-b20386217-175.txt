Poultry 159 without the help of butcher's meat as the case may require. And now to make a passing but sweeping statement. It is a lazy and extravagant plan to order chickens, &c, to be sent home ready trussed. By doing this the full price is paid to the tradesman, but he forthwith retains practically the most useful parts, viz. the giblets. The most ordinary cook can truss any bird ; if not, she should learn to do so. Only where turkeys and geese are concerned, the tendons of the legs should be removed by the poulterer, as the operation sometimes requires a great deal of strength and some knack which only much experience can impart. Roast chicken is too well known to need describing; it can be done in front of the fire or in the oven, with slices of bacon tied around it, or merely wrapped in a very thin sheet of buttered paper; in either case, however, the covering should be removed about twenty minutes before the chicken is to be dished up, so that this may become a better colour. It may be stuffed or not, according to taste, with sausage meat alone or (when they are in season) with equal quantities of sausage meat and chest- nuts. This mixture should be well seasoned. The most delicious way of preparing chicken whole is undoubtedly to cook it in the casserole, either to be served in the same, or on a dish, as preferred. The bird seems to have much more flavour, and is, of course, more juicy than when roasted ; it is also much more tender and has a better flavour when served up a second time. Put into a suitable utensil a piece of butter about the size of a small egg, then the chicken ; let it slightly colour over the fire, then add salt and pepper, cover, and let the contents cook very slowly for an hour and a half, turning the bird over at half-time. Remove it on to a very hot dish, take off some of the fat from the gravy

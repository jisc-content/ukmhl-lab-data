165 Poultry without strips of bacon tied around. These can be served hot or cold. The recipe for ponlets frits answers well with pigeons. They can also be grilled after having been sprinkled with salt, pepper, and dipped in good olive oil. The same recipes apply equally well to ducks. Special vegetables, however, are more particularly adapted to this bird. Olives are a favourite garnish when it is plainly roasted ; potatoes and parsnips en puree are most fre- quently served with it, and, of course, green peas. When used as an entree the puree is generally placed on the same dish around the duck. All dark-fleshed birds and every kind of game are served as a salmis, just as the white-fleshed ones are usually fricassed.

Let this boil rather freely ; after about twenty minutes add a large tumblerful of good red wine, and draw the saucepan a little aside, letting the contents simmer for another three-quarters of an hour. To this add the remains that have to be served, let them simmer for an hour or so, and serve with fried bread. If it is hare that is being prepared, a little of the blood should have been put aside to thicken the sauce j if it is game, the liver should have been retained, and pounded and stirred into the sauce ten minutes before serving.

Mushrooms or their parings, morel, olives, &c., are very acceptable in such dishes. Or, prepare as above, but add to it all the trimmings you can spare from the bird, &c, under treatment, when

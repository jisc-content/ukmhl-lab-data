301 PRESERVES. fill up the bottles with the alum-water in which they were scalded, which must be kept in the bottles; for if left in the kettle, or in a glazed pan, it will spoil. Stop them close. The water must boil all the time the process is carry- ing on. Gooseberries done this way make as fine tarts as when fresh off the trees. Another way. In dry weather, pick the gooseberries that are full grown but not ripe; top and tail them, and put into open-mouthed bottles; gently cork them with new velvet corks; put them in the oven when the bread is drawn, and let them stand till shrunk a quarter part; take them out of the oven, and immediately beat the corks in tight, cut off the tops, and rosin down close ; set them in a dry place; and, if well secured from air, they will keep the year round. if gathered in the damp, or the gooseberriesâ€™ skins are the least cut in taking off the stalks and buds, they will mould. The hairy sort only must be used for keeping, and do them before the seeds become large. Currants and damsons may be done the same. To keep Damsons for Winter Pies. Put them in small stone jars or wide-mouthed bottles; set them up to their necks in a boiler of cold water, and, lighting a fire under, scald them. Next day, when per- fectly cold, fill up with spring water: cover them. Another way. Boil one-third as much sugar as fruit.with it, over a slow fire, till the juice adheres to the fruit, and forms a jam. Keep it in small jars in a dry place. If too sweet, mix with it some of the fruit that is done without sugar. A nothcr way. Choose steen-pots, if you can get them, which are of equal size top and bottom (they should hold eight or nine pounds), put the fruit in, about a quarter up, then

DOMESTIC COOKERY. 6 well, and wrap it in a floured cloth. Season with salt and pepper: flour, and put on a gridiron that is very clean, the bars of which, when hot, should be rubbed with a bit of suet, to prevent the fish from sticking. It must he broiled on a very clear fire, that it may not taste smoky; and not too near, that it may not be scorched. Fish being universally liked, the dressing and ap- pearance of it, and the goodness of the sauces, demand great attention. The proper garnish is sliced lemon, pickled barberries, horse-radish, a fringe of crusted parsley, or crimped parsley. To crimp Parsley.â€”When washed and cleared of the large stalks, throw it again into clean water ; make the dripping which fried the fish boil up, and throw the parsley out of the water into the pan, and it will in- stantly crisp without losing its colour. Take it out with a slice,' and let it stand before the fire a minute or two, while the fish is being dished. Those who know how to purchase fish may, by taking more at a time than they want for one day, often get it cheap; and such kinds as will pot or pickle, or keep by being sprinkled with salt and hung up, or by being- fried will serve for stewing the next day, may then be bought with advantage. Fresh-water fish has often a muddy smell and taste ; to take off which, soak it in strong salt and water after it is nicely cleaned ; or if of a size to bear it, scald it in the same ; then dry and dress it. To dress a Turtle. The night before dressing a turtle, hang it up by the hinder legs, and without giving time for it to draw in its neck, cut off its head. Early next morning have ready a boiler of hot water. With a sharp knife take off the fins next the head at the joint, which, if properly hit, will allow them to separate from the body without cut- ting. The hinder fins, when cut at the joint, will, by a little twist, come off immediately.

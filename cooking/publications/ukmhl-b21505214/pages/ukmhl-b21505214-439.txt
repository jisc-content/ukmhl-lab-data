361 DAIRY. from becoming sour, and spoiling- the cream, it may be kept perfectly sweet by scalding the new milk very gently without boiling, and setting it by in the earthen dish or pan that it is done in. This method is pursued in Devonshire; and for butter and eating, would equally answer in small quantities for coffee, tea, &c. Cream already skimmed may be kept twenty-four hours if scalded without sugar; and by adding to it as much powdered lump sugar as shall make it pretty sweet, will be good two days, keeping it in a cool place.; Syrup of Cream May be preserved, as above, in the proportion of a pound and a quarter of sugar to a pint of perfectly fresh cream ; keep it in a cool place for two or three hours; then put it into one or two ounce phials, and cork it close. It will keep good thus for several weeks, and will be found very useful in voyages. Gallino Curds and Whey, as in Italy. Take a number of the rough coats that line the giz- zards of turkeys and fowls; clean them from the pebbles they contain ; rub them well with salt, and hang them to dry. This makes a more tender and delicate curd than common rennet. When to be used, break off some bits of the skin, and put on it some boiling water; in eight or nine hours use the liquor as you do other rennet. To choose Butter at Market. Put a knife into the butter, if salt, and smell it when drawn out; if there is anything rancid or unpleasant, it is bad. Being made at different times, the layers in casks will vary greatly; and you will not easily come at the goodness but by unhooping the cask, and trying it between the staves. Fresh butter ought to smell like a nosegay, and be of an equal colour all through: if sour in smell, it has not been sufficiently washed; if veiny and open, it is probably mixed with staler or an inferior sort.

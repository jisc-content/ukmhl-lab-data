DOMESTIC COOKERY. 400 To clean Floor-cloths. Sweep, then wipe them with a flannel; and when all dust and spots are removed, rub with a waxed flannel, and then with a dry plain one ; but use little wax, and rub only enough with the latter to give a little smooth- ness, or it may endanger falling. Washing now and then with milk after the above sweeping and dry-rubbing them, gives as beautiful a look, and they are less slippery. To dust Carpets ancl Floors. Sprinkle tea-leaves on them, then sweep carefully. The former should not be swept frequently with a whisk brush, as it wears them fast: only once a week, and the other times with the leaves and a hair-brush. Fine carpets should be gently done with a hair hand- brush, such as for clothes, on the knees. * To clean Carpets. Take up the carpet, let it be well beaten, then laid down, and brush on both sides with a hand-brush : turn it the right side upwards, and scour it with ox-gall and soap and water, very clean, and dry it with linen cloths. , Then lay it on grass, or hang it up to dry. To give to boards a beautiful Appearance. After washing them very nicely clean with soda and warm water, and a brush, wash them with a very large sponge and clean water. Both times observe to leave no spot untouched ; and clean straight up and down, not crossing from board to board ; then dry with clean cloths, rubbed hard up aud down in the same way. The floors should not be often wetted, but very thoroughly when done; and once a week dry-rubbed with hot-sand, and a heavy brush, the right way of the boards. The sides of stairs or passages on which are carpets or floor-cloth, should be washed with sponge instead of linen or flannel, and the edges will not he soiled. Dif- ferent sponges should be kept for the above two uses;.

Another way to pickle Oysters. Open the number you intend to pickle, put them into a saucepan with their own liquor for ten minutes, sim- mer them very gently ; then put them into a jar, one by one, that none of the grit may stick to them, and cover them, when cold, with the pickle thus made.—Boil the liquor with a bit of mace, lemon-peel, and black peppers, and to every hundred put two spoonsful of the best undistilled vinegar.

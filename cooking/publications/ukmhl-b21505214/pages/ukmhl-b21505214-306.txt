DOMESTIC COOKERY. 228 to your taste ; and add some grated nutmeg, and a little salt. Put to this the chesnut paste, and stir over the fire till it is thick. Line a dish with puff paste, and pour the mixture into it, and hake it. If cream cannot be obtained, thicken three pints of new milk with the beaten yolks of two or three eggs, and a tea-spoonful of rice-flour. Quince Pudding. Scald some quinces till they are very tender; pare them, and scrape off all the pulp. Strew over them ginger, cinnamon, and as much sugar as will make them very sweet. To a pint of cream put the yolks of three or four eggs, and stir into it as much of the pulp as will make it of a proper thickness. Line a dish, and bake. White pears, plums, apricots, or other fruit, may be done in the same way. An excellent Apricot Pudding. Halve twelve large apricots, give them a scald till they are soft; meantime pour on the grated crumbs of a penny-loaf a pint of boiling cream ; when half cold, four ounces of sugar, the yolks of four beaten eggs, and a glass of white wine. Pound the apricots in a mortar, with some or all of the kernels ; mix then the fruit and other ingredients together; put a paste round a dish, and bake the pudding half an hour. Baked Gooseberry Pudding. Stew gooseberries in a jar over a hot hearth, or in a saucepan of water, till they will pulp. Take a pint of the juice pressed through a coarse sieve, and beat it with three yolks and whites of eggs beaten and strained, one ounce and a half of butter; sweeten it well, and put a crust round the dish. A few crumbs of roll should be mixed with the above to give a little consistence, or four ounces of Naples biscuit. Raspberries or currants may be used instead of g-oose- berries, and are equally good.

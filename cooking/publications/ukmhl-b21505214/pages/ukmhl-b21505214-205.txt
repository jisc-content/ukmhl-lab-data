127 SOUPS. soup, or brown or white gravy; if for brown gravy, put some of the above colouring, and boil a few minutes. Mock Turtle. Bespeak a calf’s bead with the skin on, cut it in half, and clean it well; then half boil it, take all the meat oft* in square bits, break the bones of the head, and boil them in some veal and beef broth to add to the richness. Fry some shalot in butter, and dredge in flour enough to thicken the gravy; stir this into the browning, and give it one or two boils; skim it carefully, and then put in the head ; put in also a pint of Madeira wine, and sim- mer till the meat is quite tender. About ten minutes before you serve, put in some basil, tarragon, chives, parsley, Cayenne pepper, and salt to your taste; also two spoonsful of mushroom ketchup, and one of soy. Squeeze the juice of a lemon into the tureen, and pour the soup upon it. Forcemeat balls and small eggs. A cheaper way to prepare Mock Turtle. Prepare half a calf’s bead, without the skin, as above; when the meat is cut off1, break the bones and put them into a saucepan with some gravy made of beef and veal bones, and seasoned with fried onions, herbs, mace, and pepper. Have ready two or three ox-palates boiled so tender as to blanch, and cut into small pieces; to which a cow-heel, likewise cut into pieces, is a great improve- ment. Brown some butter, flour, and onion, and pour the gravy to it; then add the meats as above, and stew. Half a pint of sherry, an anchovy, two spoonsful of walnut-ketchup, the same of mushroom-ketchup, and some chopped herbs as before. Balls, &c. Another ivay.

When cold, take off the fat very nicely ; cut the meat and feet into bits an inch and a half

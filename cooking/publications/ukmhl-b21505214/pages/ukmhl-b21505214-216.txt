DOMESTIC COOKERY. 138 meat-balls fried of a good brown, or small suet dump- lings, should be served in the tureen. Ox Tail Soup. Two or three ox-tails will make it stronger than a large quantity of meat without these, and form a very- nourishing soup. Make it like gravy-soup, and give it what flavour or thickening you like. Hessian Soup and Ragout. Clean the root of a neat’s tongue very nicely, and half an ox’s head, with salt and water, and soak them afterwards in water only. Then stew them in five or six quarts of water, till tolerably tender. Let the soup stand to be cold ; take off the fat, which will make good paste for hot meat-pies, or will do to baste. Put to the soup a pint of split peas, or a quart of whole ones, twelve carrots, six turnips, six potatoes, six large onions, a bunch of sweet herbs, and two heads of ce- lery. Simmer them without the meat, till the vegeta- bles are done enough to pulp with the peas through a sieve; and the soup will then be about the thickness of cream. Season it with pepper, salt, mace, allspice, a clove or two, and a little cayenne, all in fine powder. If the peas are bad, the soup may not be thick enough; then boil it in a slice of roll, and put it through a co- lander; or add a little rice flour, mixing it by degrees. For the Ragout, cut the nicest part of the head, the kernels, and part of the fat of the root of the tongue, into small thick pieces. Rub these with some of the above seasoning, and put them into a quart of the liquor, kept out for that purpose before the vegetables were added; flour well, and simmer them till nicely tender. Then put a little mushroom and walnut-ketchup, a little soy, a glass of port wine, and a' tea-spoonful of made mustard; and boil all up together before served. If for company, serve with small eggs and forcemeat- balls. This way furnishes an excellent soup and a ragout at

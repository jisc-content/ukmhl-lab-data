DOMESTIC COOKERY. 24 Fried Eels. If small, they should be curled round and fried, being first, dipped into egg and crumbs of bread. Boiled Eels. The small ones are best this way : simmer them in a small quantity of water, with a good deal of parsley, which should be served up with them and the liquor. Serve chopped parsley and butter for sauce. Eel Broth, very nourishing for the Sick. Do as above; but stew two hours, and add an onion and peppercorns; salt to taste. Collared Eel. Bone a large eel, but do not skin it: mix pepper, salt, mace, allspice, and a clove or two, in the finest powder, and rub over the whole inside; roll it tight, and bind with a coarse tape. Boil it in salt and water, and two bay-leaves, till enough, then add vinegar, and when cold keep the collar in pickle. Serve it either whole or in slices. Chopped sage, parsley, and a little thyme, knotted marjoram, and savory, mixed with the spices, greatly improve the taste. Eels stewed as carp are a very fine dish. To stew Lamprey, as at Worcester. After cleaning the fish carefully, remove the cartilage which runs down the back, and season with a small quantity of cloves, mace, nutmeg, pepper, and allspice ; put it into a small stew-pot, with as much strong beef g-ravy and Madeira, or sherry, in equal quantities, as will cover it. Cover close; stew till tender, then take out the lamprey and keep hot, while you boil up the liquor with two or three anchovies chopped, and some flour and butter; strain the gravy through a sieve, and add lemon-juice and some made mustard. Serve with sippets of bread and horse-radish. When there is spawn, it must be fried and put round. Note. Cider will do in common instead of white wine.

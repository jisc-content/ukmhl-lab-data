BREAD. 335 Thus made, flour will imbibe three-quarters more of bran-water than of plain ; so that it not only produces a more nutritious, substantial food, but makes an increase of one-fifth of the usual quantity of bread, which is a saving of one day’s consumption out of six ; and if this was adopted throug’hout the kingdom, it would make a saving of ten millions sterling a year, when wheat was at the price it stood in the scarcity, reckoning the con- sumption to be two hundred thousand bushels a day. The same quantity of flour, which, kneaded with water, produces sixty-nine pounds eight ounces of bread, will in the above way make eighty-three pounds eight ounces, and gain fourteen pounds. At the ordinary price of flour, four millions would be saved. When ten days old, if put into the oven for twenty minutes, this bread will appear quite new again. Rice-and-Wheat Bread. Simmer a pound of rice in two quarts of water till it becomes perfectly soft; when it is of a proper warmth, mix it extremely well with four pounds of flour, and vest and salt as for other bread ; of yest about four large spoonsful; knead it extremely well ; then set it to rise before the fire. Some of the flour should be reserved to make up the loaves. The whole expense, including baking, will not exceed three shillings, for which eight pounds and a half of exceeding good bread will be pro- duced. If the rice should require more water, it must be added, as some rice swells more than other. French Bread. With a quarter of a peck of fine flour mix the yolks of three and whites of two eggs, beaten and strained, a little salt, half a pint of good yest that is not bitter, and as much milk, made a little warm, as will work into a thin light dough. Stir it about, but do not knead it. Have ready three quart wooden dishes, divide the dough among them, set to rise, then turn them out into the oven, which must be quick, ltasp when done.

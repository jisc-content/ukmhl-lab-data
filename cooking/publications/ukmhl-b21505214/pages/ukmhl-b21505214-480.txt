Melt fresh mutton-suet, smear over the iron with it while hot; then dust it well with unslaked lime pounded, and tied up in a muslin. Irons so prepared will keep many months. Use no oil for them at any time, except salad oil, there being- water in all other. Fire-irons should be kept wrapt in baize, in a dry place, when not used. Another way. Beat into three pounds of unsalted hog’s lard, two drams of camphor, sliced thin, till it is dissolved : then take as much black-lead as will make it of the colour of broken steel. Dip a rag into it, and rub it thick on the stove, &c., and the steel will never rust, even if wet. When it is to be used, the grease must be washed off with hot water, and the steel be dried before polishing. To take Rust out of Steel. Cover the steel with sweet oil well rubbed on it, and in forty-eight hours use unslaked lime finely powdered, to rub until all the rust disappears.

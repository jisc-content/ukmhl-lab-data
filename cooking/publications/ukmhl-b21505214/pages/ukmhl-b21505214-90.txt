DOMESTIC COOKERY. 22 Steived Carp. Scale and clean, take care of the roe, &c. Lay the fish in a stew-pan, with a rich beef-gravy, an onion, eight cloves, a dessert-spoonful of Jamaica pepper, the same of black, a fourth part of the quantity of gravy of port (cider may do) ; simmer close covered; when nearly done, add two anchovies chopped fine, a dessert- spoonful of made mustard, some fine walnut ketchup, and a bit of butter rolled in flour : shake it, and let the gravy boil a few minutes, then add a spoonful of soy.

Cover over the pan, and bake it an hour. Let it be done before it is wanted. Pour the liquor from it, and keep the fish hot while you heat up the liquor with a good piece of butter rolled in flour, a tea-spoonful of made mustard, a little Cayenne, and a spoonful of soy.

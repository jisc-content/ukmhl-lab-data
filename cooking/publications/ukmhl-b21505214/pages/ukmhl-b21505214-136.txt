DOMESTIC COOKERY. G2 ham and a little suet, parsley, and shalot (or, instead of the parsley and shalot, some fresh mushrooms stewed and minced), pepper, salt, and a small piece of pounded mace. This stuffing may either fill up the roll like a sausage, or be rolled with the meat. In either case tie it up very tight, and stew very slowly in a gravy and a glass of sherry. Serve it when tender, after skimming it nicely. Harrico of Veal. Take the best end of a small neck ; cut the bones short, but leave it whole; then put it into a stewpan just covered with brown gravy; and when it is nearly done, have ready a pint of boiled peas, six cucumbers pared and sliced, and two cabbage-lettuces cut into quarters, all stewed in a little good broth ; put them to the veal and let them simmer ten minutes. When the veal is in the dish, pour the sauce and vegetables over it, and lay the lettuce with forcemeat balls round it. A Dunelm of cold Veal or Fowl. Stew a few small mushrooms in their own liquor and a bit of butter, a quarter of an hour; mince them very small, and add them (with their liquor) to minced veal, with also a little pepper and salt, some cream and a bit of butter rubbed in less than half a tea-spoonful of flour. Simmer three or four minutes, and serve on thin sippets of bread. Minced Veal. Cut cold veal as fine as possible, but do not chop it; put to it a very little lemon-peel shred, two grates of nutmeg, some salt, and four or five spoonsful of either a little weak broth, milk, or water ; simmer these gently with the meat, but take care not to let it boil; and add a bit of butter rubbed in flour. Put sippets of thin toasted bread, cut into a three-cornered shape, round the dish. Fried crumbs of bread lightly strewed over, or served in little heaps on the meat, are an improve- ment to the look and flavour: a little shred of shalot may occasionally be added.

MEATS. 33 winter, and double that time in summer, before they are killed. In every sort of provisions, the best of the kind goes farthest, cuts out to greatest advantage, and affords most nourishment. Round of beef, fillet of veal, and leg of mutton, are joints that bear a higher price; but as they have more solid meat, they deserve the preference. It is / worth notice, however, that those joints which are infe- rior may be dressed as palatably; and being cheaper they ought to be bought in turn ; for when they are weighed with the prime pieces, the price of these is lower. In loins of meat, the long pipe that runs by the bone should be taken out, as it is apt to taint; as also the kernels of beef.

In the country, where meat is often carried a great distance, it should be well covered with a cloth, over which fresh cabbage-leaves would keep it cool.

Pieces of charcoal laid about meat preserve it from putrefaction, and recover what is spoiling. All legs and shoulders of meat should hang with the knuckle downwards, which will cause the gravy to be retained.

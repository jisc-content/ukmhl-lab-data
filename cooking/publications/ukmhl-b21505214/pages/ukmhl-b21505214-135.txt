6'1 VEAL. Collared Veal to eat Hot. Bone a piece of the breast, and lay a forcemeat over it of herbs, bread, an anchovy, a spoonful or two of scraped hain, a very little mace, white pepper, and chop- ped chives; then roll, bind it up tight, and stew it in water or weak broth. Let the colour be preserved, and serve it in veal gravy, or fricassee sauce, with mush- rooms and artichoke bottoms. To malte a Currie. Cut part of a breast of veal into pieces about three inches long, and two wide; fry them in butter of a light brown, with an onion chopped fine. While hot rub them well over with two table-spoonsful of currie-pow- der. Put into a stewpan, and add some good veal-broth, pepper, salt, and an ounce of butter, and stew very slowly till the meat is quite tender. A fresh chillie (when it can be had) eaten with the currie, is a great improvement to the flavour; or capsi- cum, fresh or pickled, may be substituted; or put lemon- juice, or the liquor of Indian pickle, to make it rather acid. Fish, fowl, and all kinds of flesh, are occasionally made into curries. Chump of Veal a-la-daube. Cut off the chump end of the loin ; take out the edge- bone ; stuff the hollow with good forcemeat, tie it up tight, and lay it in a stewpan with the bone you took out, a small faggot of herbs and anchovy, two blades of mace, a few white peppers, and a pint of good veal- broth. Cover the veal with slices of fat bacon, and lay a sheet of white paper over it, cover the pan close, simmer it two hours, then take out the bacon and glaze the veal. Serve it on mushrooms, or with sorrel sauce, or what else you please. Veal-rolls of either cold Meat or fresh. Cut thin slices ; and spread on them a fine seasoning of a very few crumbs, a little chopped bacon or scraped

SICK COOKERY. 3S1 stone raisins, till near a third he consumed. Strain it on a bit of lemon-peel, which remove in an hour, as it gives a bitter taste if left long. A most pleasant Drink. Put a tea-cupful of cranberries into a cup of water, and mash them. In the mean time boil two quarts of water with one large spoonful ot oatmeal and a bit of lemon-peel; then add the cranberries, and as much fine Lisbon sugar as shall leave a smart flavour of the fruit; and a quarter of a pint of sherry, or less, as may be proper : Tooil all for half an hour, and strain off. Soft and fine Draught for those who are weak and have a Cough. Beat a fresh-laid egg, and mix it with a quarter of a pint of new milk warmed, a large spoonful of capillaire, the same of rose-water, and a little nutmeg scraped. Do not warm it after the egg is put in. Take it the first and last thing. Toast and Water. Toast slowly a thin piece of bread till extremely brown and hard, but not the least black; then plunge it into a jug of cold water, and cover it over an hour before used. This is of particular use in weak bowels. It should be of a fine brown colour before drinking it. Barley Water. Wash a handful of common barley, then simmer it gently in three pints of water with a bit of lemon-peel. This is less apt to nauseate than pearl-barley; but the other is a very pleasant drink. Another way. Boil an ounce of pearl-barley a few minutes to cleanse, then put on it a quart of water ; simmer an hour : when half done, put into it a bit of fresh lemon- peel, and one bit of sugar. If likely to be too thick, I you may put another quarter of a pint of w ater. Lemon- juice may be added, if chosen.

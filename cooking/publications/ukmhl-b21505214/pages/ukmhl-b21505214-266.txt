DOMESTIC COOKERY. 18S Note.—All pies made of white meats or fowls are improved by a layer of fine sausage-meat, if that flavour be approved. Pigeon Pie. Rub the pigeons with pepper and salt, inside and out; in the latter put a bit of butter, and if approved, some parsley chopped with the livers, and a little of the same seasoning. Lay a beef-steak at the bottom of the dish, and the birds on it; between every two a hard egg. Put a cup of water in the dish ; and if you have any ham in the house, lay a bit on each pigeon : it is a great improvement to the flavour. Observe, when ham is cut for gravy or pies, to take the under part rather than the prime. Season the gizzards, and two joints of the wings, and put them in the centre of the pie ; and over them, in a hole made in the crust, three feet nicely cleaned, to show what pie it is. Partridge Pie. Pick and singe four partridges; cut off the legs at the knee ; season with pepper, salt, chopped parsley, thyme, and mushrooms. Lay a veal steak, and a slice of ham, at the bottom of the dish ; put the partridges in, and half a pint of good broth. Put puff paste on the ledge of the dish, and cover with the same; brush it over with egg, and bake an hour. Hare Pie, to eat cold. Season the hare after it is cut up ; and bake it, with eg’gs and forcemeat, in a raised crust, or dish. When it is to be served, cut ofl'the lid, and cover it with jelly- gravy, as in page 148. A French Pie. Lay a puff paste round the ledge of the dish, and put in either veal in slices, rabbits or chickens jointed ; with forcemeat-balls, sweetbreads cut in pieces, artichoke bottom, and a tew truffles.

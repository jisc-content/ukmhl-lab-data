DOMESTIC COOKERY. 144 may be made by a skilful cook to answer the same purpose. All the shank-bones of legs and shoulders of mutton should be thrown into water, and, after good soaking and brushing, be long boiled ; the water in which they are done will add greatly to the richness of gravy, as does the jelly of cow-heels. The latter must lie all night in water, which causes the jelly to be of a good colour. When boiled three hours, and become cold, let the fat be carefully taken off; and when apparently quite clear, lay some white paper upon it, rubbing it close with a spoon, which will remove every particle of grease, and it will be as pure as the jelly of a calfâ€™s foot. Tarragon and knotted marjoram, by some called Lon- don thyme, give the flavour of French cookery, and are a great improvement to gravies; but should be added only a short time before serving. Truffles and morels thicken and improve the flavour of gravies and soups: half an ounce being carefully washed of each, simmer them in a pint of water, and add the whole. To make Gravy that ivill keep a week. Cut lean beef thin, put it into a frying-pan without any butter or fat, and set it on a fire covered, but take care it does not burn: let it stay till all the gravy that comes out of the meat is dried up into it again, often shaking it: put as much water as will cover the meat, and let that stew away. Then put to the meat a small quantity of water, herbs, onions, spice, and a bit of lean ham : simmer till it is rich, and keep it in a cool place. Do not take off the fat till going to lie used. Another xoay. Lay meat at the bottom of a stewpan with two or three ounces of butter, and herbs and roots strewed over it: cover close, and set it on a slow part of the stove. When the gravy is drawn out, shake it into the meat, and let it remain till nearly dried up again; then add as much water as required.

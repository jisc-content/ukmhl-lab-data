AS the following directions were intended for the con- duct of the families of the authoress''s own daughters, and for the arrangement of their table, so as to unite a good figure with proper economy, she lias avoided all excessive luxury, such as essence of ham, and that wasteful expenditure of large quantities of meat for gravy, which so greatly contributes to keep up the price, and is no less injurious to those who eat than to those whose penury obliges them to abstain. Many receipts are given for things which, being in daily use, the mode of preparing them may be supposed too well- known to require a place in a cookery-book, yet we rarely meet with butter properly melted, good toast-and- water, or well-made coffee.

47 BEEF. Rolled Beef-steaks. Beat some well-hung- rump-steaks, till tender, with a cleaver; make a forcemeat of the breast of a fowl, half a pound of veal, half the same of ham or gammon, fat and lean, the kidney of a loin of veal, and a sweetbread, all cut very small; a few truffles and morels stewed and cut, a shalot or two, some parsley, a little thyme, some grated lemon-peel, the yolks of two eg-gs, half a nut meg, and a quarter of a pint of cream; mix these well to- gether, and stir over the fire for ten minutes; lay the forcemeat on the steaks, roll them up, and skewer them tight: fry them a fine brown; take them from the fat, and stew them a quarter of an hour with a pint of beef- gravy, a spoonful of port, two ditto of ketchup, and a few fresh or pickled mushrooms. Take up the steaks, cut them in two, serve them with the cut side upper- most, and the gravy round, having carefully skimmed it. Garnish with lemon. Becf-stcaks of underdone Meat. Cut them an inch and a half thick, with a good deal of fat; lay them on the gridiron over a quick fire, turn often, and as soon as brown lay them on a very hot dish that has been rubbed with shalot, and put in some of the gravy of the meat, and a spoonful of ketchup. When taken olf the fire, put salt and pepper. If seasoned while broiling, the meat will be hardened, and the juices wasted. The steaks may be served on chopped cabbage, warmed with butter, pepper, and salt. Or the steaks as before, and the cabbage in a separate dish, with sliced fried potatoes. Beef-collops. Cut thin slices of beef from the rump, or any other tender part, and divide them into pieces three inches long; beat them with the blade of a knife, and flour them. Fry the collops quick in butter two minutes; then lay them into a small stewpan, and cover them with a pint of gravy; add a bit of butter rubbed in

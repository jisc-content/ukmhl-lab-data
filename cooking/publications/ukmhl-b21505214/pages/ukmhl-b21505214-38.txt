MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS. xxxiv will answer as wrell, for others of the same kind, but which are more costly. A false notion of economy leads many to purchase, as bargains, what is not wanted, and sometimes never is used. Were this error avoided, more money would remain for other purposes. It is not unusual among lower dealers to put off a large quantity of goods, by assurances that they are advancing in price; and many who supply fancy articles are so successful in persuasion, that purchasers not unfrequently go far be- yond their original intention, even to their own future disquiet. Some things are better for keeping, and being in constant consumption, should be laid in accordingly; such as paper, soap, and candles. Of these, more here- after. To give unvarying rules cannot be attempted, for people ought to form their conduct on their circum- stances ; hut it is presumed that a judicious arrange- ment, according to them, will be found equally advan- tageous to all. The minutiae of management must be regulated by every oneâ€™s fortune and rank. Some ladies, not deficient in either, charge themselves with giving out, once in a month, to a superintending servant, such quantities of household articles as by observation and calculation they know to be sufficient, reserving for their own key the large stock of things usually laid in for very large families in the country. Should there be several more visitors than usual, they can easily account for in- crease of consumption, and vice versa. Such a degree of judgment will be respectable even in the eye of do- mestics, if they are not interested in the ignorance of their employers ; and if they are, their services will not compensate for want of honesty.

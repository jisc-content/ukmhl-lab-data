PUDDINGS. 211 Small Almond Puddings. Pound eight ounces of almonds, and a few bitter, with a spoonful of water; mix with four ounces of butter warmed, four yolks and two whites of eggs, sugar to taste, two spoonfuls of cream, and one of brandy : mix well, and bake in little cups buttered. Serve with pud- ding-sauce. Lemonade Pudding, to be eaten cold. With two ounces of white sugar, and the juice of two Seville oranges and two lemons, make a pint of lemonade with cold water. Pour it upon a French roll rasped : when it has soaked up all the liquor, stick it over with half an ounce of blanched almonds. Beat half a pound of currant jelly to a liquid, and pour over the whole. Sago Pudding. Boil a pint and a half of new milk, with four spoons- ful of sago nicely washed and picked, lemon-peel, cinna- mon and nutmeg: sweeten to taste ; then mix four eggs, put a paste round the dish, and bake slowly. A very good Pudding. Mix one pound and a half of suet, cut small, and free . from skin, with two pounds of flour, a pound of currants picked and dried, six eggs, a table-spoonful of infusion of saffron, a glass of brandy, a little pounded ginger, and a pint of milk. Put it into a basin that will just hold it : tie a floured cloth tight over, and put it into a pot of water that is boiling very fast. Boil it four hours. Bread and Butter Pudding. Slice bread spread with butter, and lay it in a dish with currants between each layer; and sliced citron, orange or lemon, if to be very nice. Pour over an unboiled custard of milk, two or three eggs, a few pimentos, and a very little ratafia, two hours at least before it is to be baked ; and lade it over to soak the bread. r 2 -

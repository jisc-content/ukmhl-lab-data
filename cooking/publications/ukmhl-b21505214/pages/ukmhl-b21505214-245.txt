VINEGARS. 167 When sufficiently sour it may be bottled, or may be used from the cask with a wooden spigot and faucet; but the former will be most advantageous. Vinegar made of Malt. Pour ten gallons of boiling watei on a bushel of malt; stir it well; let it infuse the usual time, and draw the wort off as in brewing ; but neither boil nor put hops. Work it with yest; and in two days tun it, and put the barrel in the sun, with a bit of glass over the bung-hole. Observe, that as there must be enough to fill the cask, some little quantity of water must be al- lowed for waste. It must be brewed in February, and will be excellent in July, and fit for pickles. Camp Vinegar. Slice a large head of garlic, and put it into a wide- mouthed bottle, with half an ounce of cayenne, two tea-spoonsful of real soy, two of walnut ketchup, four anchovies chopped, a pint of vinegar, and enough co- chineal to give it the colour of lavender drops. Let it stand six weeks; then strain off quite clear, and keep in small bottles sealed up. Another Camp Vinegar. Infuse in a quart of the best white-wine vinegar a quarter of a pint of walnut ketchup, the same quantity of mushroom ketchup, and also the same quantity of soy, half an ounce of cayenne, four heads of garlic, ten shalots, two ounces of black and two ounces of white pepper, the same quantity of pimento and ginger, one ounce of nutmeg, and three blades of mace, with ten cloves, in a wide-mouthed two-quart bottle; and cover very closely with cork, leather, and bladder. Let it remain near the fire a month, shaking- it frequently. When any is taken out, put in as much fresh vinegar. This is not only a very fine sauce, but a great preserva- tive against infectious diseases, if taken freely.

DOMESTIC COOKERY. 284 Orange Butter. Boil six hard eggs, beat them in a mortar with two ounces of fine sugar, three ounces of butter, and two ounces of blanched almonds beaten to a paste. Moisten with orange-flower water, and when all is mixed, rub it through a colander on a dish, and serve sweet biscuits between. Orange Posset. Boil the grated crumb of a penny-loaf in a pint of water, with the grated peel of a Seville orange, till the mixture be clear and thick : then add three ounces of sweet and one bitter almond, beaten with half a glass of brandy, half the juice of an orange, four ounces of sugar, and a pint of mountain wine. Serve in a China bowl. Wine Roll. Soak a penny French roll in raisin wine till it will hold no more; put it in the dish, and pour round it a custard, or cream, sugar, and lemon juice. Just before it is served, sprinkle over it some nonpareil comfits; or stick a few blanched slit almonds into it. Sponge biscuits may be used instead of the roll. To prepare Ice for Iceing. Get a few pounds of ice, break it almost to powder, throw a large handful and a half of rock salt among it. You must prepare it in a part of the house where as little of the warm air comes as you can possibly contrive. The ice and salt being in a bucket, put your cream into an ice-pot, and cover it; immerse it in the ice, and draw that round the pot, so as to touch every possible part. In a few minutes put a spatula or spoon in, and stir it well, removing the parts that ice round the edges to the centre. If the ice cream or water be in a form, shut the bottom close, and move the whole in the ice, as you cannot use a spoon to that without danger

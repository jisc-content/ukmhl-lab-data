CAKES. 325 dough with the above. Make it into twelve cakes, and bake on a flour tin half an hour. Little Plum Cakes to keep long. Dry one pound of flour, and mix with six ounces of finely-pounded sugar ; heat six ounces of butter to a cream, and add to three eggs well beaten half a pound of currants washed and nicely dried, and the flour and sugar ; beat all for some time, then dredge flour on tin plates, and drop the batter on them the size of a wal- nut.

Have ready warm by the fire, a pound of flour, and the same of sifted sugar; mix them and a few cloves, a little nut- meg and cinnamon, in fine powder together; then by degrees work the dry ingredients into the butter and eggs.

The above proportions, leaving out four ounces of the butter, and the same of sugar, make a less luscious cake, and to most tastes a more pleasant one. A cheap Seed Cake. Mix a quarter of a peck of flour with half a pound of sugar, a quarter of an ounce of allspice, and a little ginger ; melt three-quarters of a pound of butter with half a pint of milk; when just warm, put to it a quarter of a pint of yest, and work up to a good dough.

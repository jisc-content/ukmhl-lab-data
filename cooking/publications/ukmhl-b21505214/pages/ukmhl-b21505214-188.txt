DOMESTIC COOKERY. 112 To pull Chickens. Take off the skin, and pull the flesh off the bone of a cold fowl, in as large pieces as you can : dredge it with flour, and fry it of a nice brown in butter. Drain the butter from it; and then simmer the flesh in a good gravy, well seasoned, and thickened with a little flour and butter. Add the juice of half a lemon. Another way. Cut off the legs, and the whole back of a dressed chicken; if under-done the better. Pull all the white part into little flakes free from skin ; toss it up with a little cream thickened with a piece of butter mixed with flour, half a blade of mace in powder, white pepper, salt, and a squeeze of lemon. Cut off the neck end of the chicken ; and broil the back and sidesmen in one piece, and the two legs seasoned. Put the hash in the middle, with the back on it; and the two legs at the end. Chicken Currie. Cut up the chickens raw, slice onions, and fry both in butter with great care, of a fine light brown; or if you use chickens that have been dressed, fry only the onions. Day the joints, cut into two or three pieces each, into a stewpan, with a veal or mutton gravy, and a clove or two of garlic. Simmer till the chicken is quite tender. Half an hour before you serve it, rub smooth a spoonful or two of currie-powder, a spoonful of flour, and an ounce of butter ; and add this, with four large spoons- ful of cream, to the stew. Salt to your taste. When serving, squeeze in a little lemon. Slices of under-done veal or rabbit, turkey, &c., make excellent currie. A dish of rice, broiled dry, must be served. For directions to do this, see the article Rice. Another, more easily made. Cut up a chicken or young rabbit; if chicken, take off the skin. Roll each piece in a mixture of a large spoonful of flour, and half an ounce of currie-powder.

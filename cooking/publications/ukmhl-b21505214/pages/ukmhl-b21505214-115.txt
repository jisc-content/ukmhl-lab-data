BEEF. 41 weight; hang' to dry in wood smoke, but turn it upside down every day. Boil it in pump-water, and press it: it will grate or cut into shivers, like Dutch beef. To twelve pounds of beef, the proportion of common salt is one pound. Beef Escarlot, to eat cold. Rub eight or ten pounds of a brisket with a pound of common salt, eight ounces of coarse sugar, two ounces of bay-salt, and one ditto of saltpetre, all in tine powder.

A tea-cupful of vinegar should be stewed with the beef. Beef d-la-royale. Take all the bones out of eight pounds of brisket of beef: make holes in it about an inch asunder; and fill

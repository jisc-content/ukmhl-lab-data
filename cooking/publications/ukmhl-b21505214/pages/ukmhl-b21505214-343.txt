It is seldom liked at first, but people become extremely fond of it by habit. Note.—As the air spoils it, the best mode of keeping it is to put it into jars covered with bladders, each con- taining a sufficient quantity for one week’s consumption. To preserve several Vegetables to eat in the Winter. For French beans, pick them young, and throw into a little wooden keg, a layer of them three inches deep; then sprinkle them with salt, put another layer of beans, and do the same as high as you think proper, alternately with salt, but not too much of this. Lay over them a plate or cover of wood, that will go into the keg, and put a heavy stone on it. A pickle will rise from the beans and salt. If they are too salt, the soaking and boiling will not be sufficient to make them pleasant to the taste. When they are to be eaten, cut, soak, and boil them as if fresh. Carrots, Parsnips, and Beet-roots should be kept in layers of dry sand for winter use ; and neither they nor potatoes should be cleared from the earth. Potatoes should be carefully kept from frost. Store-onions keep best hung up in a dry cold room. Parsley should be cut close to the stalks; and dried in a warm room, or on tins in a very cool oven : it pre- serves its flavour and colour, and is very useful in winter. Artichoke-bottoms, slowly dried, should be kept in paperbags ; and Truffles, Morels, Lemon-peel, fyc., in a dry place, ticketed. Cauliflowers, cut when quite dry, with their leaves on, hung up by the stalk, will keep long in a cellar. They must lie in water two or three hours, and be boiled with a great deal of salt. Small close Cabbages, laid on a stone floor, before the frost sets in, will blanch and be very fine, after many weeks’ keeping, although the outer leaves be quite spoiled.

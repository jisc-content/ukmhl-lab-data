397 DIRECTIONS TO SERVANTS. served from the sun and air as much as possible, which injure delicate colours ; and the dust may be blown off with bellows. By the above mode curtains may be kept clean, even to use with the linings newly dipped. To clean Plate. Boil an ounce of prepared hartshorn-powder in a quart of water : while on the fire, put into it as much plate as the vessel will hold ; let it boil a little, then take it out, drain it over the saucepan, and dry it before the tire. Put in more, and serve the same, till you have done. Then put into the water some clean linen rags till all be soaked up. When dry, they will serve to clean the plate, and are the very best tilings to clean the brass locks and finger-plates of doors. When the plate is quite dry, it must be rubbed bright with leather. This is a very nice mode. In many plate powders there is a mixture of quicksilver, which is very injurious; and, among other disadvantages, it makes silver so brittle, that from a fall it will break. To clean Looking-glasses. Piemove the fly-stains, and other soil, by a damp rag; then polish with woollen cloth and powder blue. To preserve Gilding, and clean it. It is not possible to prevent flies from staining the gilding without covering it; before which, blow off the light dust, and pass a feather or clean brush over it: then with strips of paper cover the frames of your glasses and do not remove till the flies are gone. Linen takes off the gilding, and deadens its bri ght- ness; it should therefore never be used for wiping it. Some means should be used to destroy the flies, as they injure furniture of every kind, and the paper like- wise. Bottles hung about with sugar and vinegar, or beer, will attract them : or fly-water, put into little shells placed about the room, but out of the reach of children.

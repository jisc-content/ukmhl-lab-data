TIES. 1S9 Vegetable Pie. Scald and blanch some broad beans : cut young- car- rots, turnips, artichoke-bottoms, mushrooms, onions, lettuces, parsley, celery, and add peas ; or use any of them you may have. Make them into a nice stew, with a little good veal gravy ; season with pepper and salt; bake a crust over a dish, with a little lining round the edge, and a cup turned bottom upwards to prevent it sinking. When baked, pour the stew into the dish, and lay the crust over it. Winter vegetables may be used, at that season, in the same way. A cup of cream is a great improvement. Macaroni Pie. Swell four ounces of pipe macaroni in milk, with a large onion. Put a layer at the bottom of a pie-dish, with some bits of butter and scraped Gloucester cheese sprinkled lightly over. Cover the whole with a well- seasoned beef-steak, then some more macaroni, then a fowl, cut in joints and seasoned ; and then another beef- steak ; cover the whole with macaroni, pieces of butter, and grated cheese, instead of crust. Bake in a slow oven. Parsley Pie. Lay a fowl, or a few bones of the scrag of veal, sea- soned, into a dish; scald a colander full of pickled parsley in milk ; season it; and add it to the fowl or meat, with a tea-cupful of any sort of good broth, or weak gravy. When it is baked, pour into it a quarter of a pint of cream scalded, with the size of a walnut of butter, and a bit of flour. Shake it round, to mix with the gravy already in. Lettuces, white mustard leaves, or spinach, may be added'to the parsley, and scalded before put in. Turnip Pie. Season mutton-chops with salt and pepper, reserving the ends of the neck-bones to lay over the turnips, which must be cut into small dice, and put on the steaks.

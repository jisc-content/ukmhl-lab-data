Cut a cold duck into joints; and warm it, without boiling, in gâ€™ravy, a glass of port wine, a tea-spoonful of made mustard, and a little butter and flour. To roast Goose. After it is prepared (see Directions for Poultry), let it be well washed and dried, and a seasoning- put in of onion, sage, and pepper and salt. Fasten it tight at the neck and rump, and then roast. Put it first at a dis- tance from the fire, and by degrees draw it nearer. A slip of paper should be skewered on the breast-bone. Baste it very well. When the breast is rising, take off the paper ; and be careful to serve it before the breast falls, or it will be spoiled by coming flatted to table. Let a good gravy be sent in the dish. Apple sauce for a stubble goose, gooseberry sauce for a green one. A glass of port, a ladle of mustard, and some salt, put into the goose when the apron is cut off, give an additional flavour to the old goose. To stew Giblets. Do them as will be directed for giblet pie, until the gizzards are perfectly tender ; season them with salt and pepper, and a very small piece of mace. Before serving, give them one boil and a cup of cream, and a piece of butter rubbed in a tea-spoonful of flour. Each gizzard and liver divided into four, the neck into three, and the wings into two. Pigeons May be dressed in such a variety of ways, that they are most useful birds. See Directions for Poultry, for cleaning, &c.

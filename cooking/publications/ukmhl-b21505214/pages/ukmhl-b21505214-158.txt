DOMESTIC COOKERY. 84 flour and butter, and then add to it a slice of lemon, a large spoonful of mushroom ketchup, a tea-spoonful of lemon-pickle, a grate of nutmeg, and the yolk of an egg beaten well in two large spoonsful of thick cream. Put this over the fire, and stir it well till it is hot, and looks white ; but do not let it boil, or it will curdle. Then put it in the fry, and shake it about near the fire for a minute or two. Serve in a very hot dish and cover. Fricassee of Lamb-stones and Sweetbreads, another way. Have ready some lamb-stones blanched, parboiled, and sliced. Flour two or three sweetbreads : if very thick, cut them in two. Fry all together, with a few large oysters, of a fine yellow brown. Pour the butter off; and add a pint of good gravy, some asparagus-tops about an inch long, a little nutmeg, pepper and salt, two slialots shred fine, and a glass of white wine. Simmer ten mi- nutes ; then put a little of the gravy to the yolks of three eggs well beaten, and by degrees mix the whole. Turn the gravy back into the pan, and stir it till of a fine thickness without boiling. Garnish with lemon. A very nice dish. Take the best end of a neck of lamb, cut it into steaks, and chop each bone so short as to make the steaks almost round. Egg, and stew with crumbs, herbs, and seasoning; fry them of the finest brown; mash some potatoes with a little butter and cream, and put them into the middle of the dish raised high. Then place the edge of one steak on another with the small bone upward, all round the potatoes. An Indian Burdwan Stew. Cut up in slices ready-dressed lamb or veal, or in joints a fowl; put it into a stewpan with two spoonsful of anchovy essence, three ditto of white wine, an ounce of butter rubbed in flour, an onion sliced thin, and a little cayenne. Cover very close, stew- till perfectly tender ; squeeze a lime, or lemon, over it in the dish. Rice may be served as with currie.

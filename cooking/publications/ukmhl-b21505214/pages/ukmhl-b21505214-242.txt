Shred a little ham or gammon, some cold veal or fowl, some beef-suet, a small quantity of onion, some parsley, very little lemon-peel, salt, nutmeg, or pounded mace, and either white pepper or cayenne, and bread- crumbs. Pound it in a mortar, and bind it with one or two eggs, beaten or strained. For forcemeat patties, the mixture as above. Forcemeat for Hare, or any tlunr/ in imitation of it. The scalded liver, an anchovy, some fat bacon, a little suet, some parsley, thyme, knotted marjoram, a little shalot, and either onion or chives, all chopped fine, crumbs of bread, pepper, and nutmeg, beat in a mortar with an egg. Forcemeats for mackerel, pike, haddock, and soles, will be found by reference to those articles. For cold savoury Pies. Substitute the fat of bacon for suet, and make as for fowls, adding the livers if the pie be of chicken or rab- bit.

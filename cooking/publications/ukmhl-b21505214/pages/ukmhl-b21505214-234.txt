DOMESTIC COOKERY. 156 butter, with a dessert-spoonful of vinegar, and a tea- spoonful of salt. Boil, and serve. Capers, when their liquor is exhausted, may he kept by adding fresh vinegar that has been scalded and be- come cold. Keep them always from the air, which makes them soft. Nasturtiums for Capers. Keep them a few days after they are gathered ; then pour boiling vinegar over them, and, when cold, cover. They will not be fit to eat for some months ; but are then finely flavoured, and by many preferred to capers. Sauce Piquante. Put an ounce or two of butter, with two shred onions, a carrot, a parsnip, a little thyme, laurel, basil, two cloves, two shalots, a clove of garlic, and some parsley, into a stewpan ; turn the whole over the fire till it be- comes brown; then shake in some flour, and moisten it with some broth and a spoonful of vinegar. Let it boil over a slow fire; skim and strain it; then add pepper and salt ; and serve with any dish you would wish to be heightened. Sauce Piquante, to serve cold. With salad, cut very fine, mince half a clove of garlic and two shalots; add mustard, sweet oil, a little vine- gar, salt, and pepper. A very fine Fish Sauce. Put into a very fine tin saucepan a pint of fine port wine, a gill of mountain, half a pint of fine walnut- ketchup, twelve anchovies, and the liquor that belongs to them, a gill of walnut-pickle, the rind and juice of a large lemon, four or five shalots, some cayenne to taste, three ounces of scraped horseradish, three blades of mace, and two tea-spoonsful of made mustard : boil it all gently, till the rawness goes off; then put it into small bottles for use. Cork them very close, and seal the top.

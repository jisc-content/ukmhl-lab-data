Of the largest green walnut kind, take and cut the bud end in four quarters, leaving the stalk end whole; pick out the seeds, and with a strong needle and thread fasten five or six together, by running the thread through the bottoms, till they are of the size of a hop.

If the first syrup be found too sour, a little sugar may be added and boiled in it, before the hops that are for drying have their last boil.

Weigh equal quantities of fruit and sugar; put the former in a preserving-pan, boil and break it, stir con- stantly, and let it boil very quickly.

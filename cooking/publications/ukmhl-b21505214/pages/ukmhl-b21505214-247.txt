At the end of three months, strain the liquor, and boil with fresh spice, which put into the bottles; and in a cool place it will keep two or three years. Mushroom Ketchup, another way.

Cockle Ketchup. Open the cockles, scald them in their own liquor; add a little water, when the liquor settles, if you have

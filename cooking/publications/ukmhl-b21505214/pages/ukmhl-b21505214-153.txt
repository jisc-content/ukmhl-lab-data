79 MUTTON. be broiled on a clear fire, seasoned when half-done, and often turned; take them up into a very hot dish, rub a bit of butter on each, and serve hot and hot the mo- ment they are done. Steaks of Mutton or Lamb, and Cucumbers. Quarter cucumbers, and lay them into a deep dish, sprinkle them with salt; and pour vinegar over them. Fry the chops of a fine brown, and put them into a stevvpan ; drain the cucumbers and put over the steaks; add some sliced onions, pepper and salt; pour hot water or weak broth on them; stew and skim well. If the gravy be not thick enough, put in a bit of butter rolled in a little fiour. Mutton Steaks Maintenon. Half-fry; stew them while hot, with herbs, crumbs, and seasoning; put them in paper immediately, and finish on the gridiron. Be careful the paper does not catch: rub a bit of butter on it first, to prevent that. Serve in the paper, and send up plain butter in a boat. To dress Mutton Rumps and Kidneys. Stew six rumps in some good mutton-gravy half an hour; then take them up, and let them stand to cool. Clear the gravy from the fat; and put into it four ounces of boiled rice, an onion stuck with cloves, and a blade of mace; boil them till the rice is thick. Wash the rumps with yolks of eggs well beaten; and strew over them crumbs of bread, a little pepper and salt, chopped parsley and thyme, and grated lemon-peel. Fry in butter of a fine brown. While the rumps are stewing, lard the kidneys, and put them to roast in a Dutch oven. W hen the rumps are fried, the grease must be drained before they are put on the dish, and the pan being cleared likewise from the fat, warm the rice in it. Lay the latter on the dish; the rumps put round on the rice, the narrow ends towards the middle, and the kidneys between. Garnish with hard eggs cut in half, the white being left on; or with different coloured pickles.

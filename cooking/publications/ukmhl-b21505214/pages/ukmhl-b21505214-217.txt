SOUPS. 139 a small expense, and they are not common. The other part will warm for the family. Soup-a-la Sap. Boil half a pound of grated raw potatoes, a pound of beef sliced thin, a pint of grey peas, an onion, and three ounces of rice, in six pints of water, to five ; strain it through a colander; then pulp the peas to it, and turn it into a saucepan again with two heads of celery sliced. Stew it tender, and add pepper and salt; and when you sene, add also fried bread. Portable Soup. Boil one or two knuckles of veal, one or two shins of beef, and three pounds of beef, in as much water only as will cover them. Take the marrow out of the bones: put any sort of spice you like, and three large onions. When the meat is done to rags, strain it oft’, and put it into a very cold place. When cold, take off the cake of fat (which will make crusts for servants’ pies), put the soup into a double-bottomed tin saucepan, and set it on a pretty quick fire, but do not let it burn. It must boil fast and uncovered, and be stirred constantly, for eight hours. Put it into a pan, and let it stand in a cold place a day; then pour it into a round soup china- dish, and set the dish into a stewpan of boiling water on a stove, and let it boil, and be now and then stirred, till the soup is thick and ropy ; then it is done enough. Pour it into the little round part at the bottom of cups or basins turned upside down to form cakes ; and when cold, turn them out on flannel to dry. Keep them in tin canisters. When they are to be used, melt them in boiling water ; and if you wish the flavour of herbs, or anything else, boil it first, strain oft’the water, and melt the soup in it. This is very convenient in the country, or at sea, where fresh meat is not always at hand; as by this means a basin of soup may be made in five minutes.

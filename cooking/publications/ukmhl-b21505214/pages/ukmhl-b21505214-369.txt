SWEET DISHES AND SWEETMEATS. 291 in being- put in the dish with them, but not enough to make the vegetables swim. To prepare Barberries for Tartlets. Pick barberries, that have no stones, from the stalks, and to every pound weigh three quarters of a pound of lump sugar; put the fruit into a stone jar, and either set it on a hot hearth, or in a saucepan of water, and let them simmer very slowly till soft: put them and the sugar into a preserving-pan, and boil them gently fifteen minutes. Use no metal but silver. Barberries in bunches. Have ready bits of flat white wood, three inches long and a quarter of an inch wide. Tie the stalks of the fruits on the sticks from within an inch of one end to beyond the other, so as to make them look handsome. Simmer them in some syrup two successive days, cover- ing them each time with it when cold. When they look clear they are simmered enough. The third day, do them like other candied fruit. Apricot Cheese. Weigh an equal quantity of pared fruit and sugar, wet the latter a very little, and let it boil quickly, or the colour will be spoiled; blanch the kernels, and add to it. Twenty or thirty minutes will boil it. Put it in small pots or cups half-filled. Orange Marmalade. Rasp the oranges, cut out the pulp, then boil the rinds very tender, and beat fine in a marble mortar. Boil three pounds of loaf-sugar in a pint of water, skim it, and add a pound of the rind; boil fast till the syrup is very thick, but stir it carefully; then put a pint of the pulp and juice, the seeds having been removed, and a pint of apple liquor; boil all gently until well jellied, which it will be in about half an hour. Put it into small pots. v 2

171 PICKLES. India Pickles. Lav a pound of white ginger in water one night; then scrape, slice, and lay it in salt in a pan till the other ingredients shall be ready. Peel, slice, and salt a pound of garlic three days; then put it in the sun to dry. Salt, and dry long pepper in the same way. Prepare various vegetables thus:— Quarter small white cabbages, salt three days,squeeze, and set them in the sun to dry. Cauliflowers cut in their branches ; take off the green from radishes: cut celery in three-inch lengths; ditto young French beans whole, after being stringed ; like- wise shoots of elder, which will look like bamboo. Ap- ples and cucumbers, choose of the least seedy sort; cut them in slices, or quarters if not too large. All must be salted, drained, and dried in the sun, except the latter; over which you must pour boiling vinegar, and in twelve hours drain them, but no salt must be used.

When they are ready, observe the fol- lowing directions:—Put some of them into a two-quart stone jar, and pour over them one quart of boiling vine- gar. Next day take out those vegetables; and when drained, put them into a large stock jar, and boiling the vinegar, pour it over some more of the vegetables : let them lie a night, and do as above. Thus proceed till you have cleansed each set from the dust which must inevitably fall on them by being so long in doing ; then, to every gallon of vinegar put two ounces of flour of mustard, mixing, by degrees, with a little of it boiling- hot. The whole of the vinegar should have been pre- viously scalded, but set to be cool before it was put to the spice. Stop the jar tight. This pickle will not be ready for a year; but you may

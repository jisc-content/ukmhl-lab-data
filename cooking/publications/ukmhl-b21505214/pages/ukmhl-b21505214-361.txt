283 SWEET DISHES AND SWEETMEATS. Black Caps. Halve and core some fine large apples, put them in a shallow pan, strew white sugar over, and bake them. Boil a glass of wine, the same of water, and sweeten it for sauce. Another ivay. Take off a slice from the stalk end of some apples, and core without paring them. Make ready as much sugar as may be sufficient to sweeten them, and mix it with some grated lemon, and a few cloves in fine powder. Stuff the holes as close as possible with this, and turn the flat end down on the stewpan ; set them on a very slow fire, with half of raisin wine, and the same of water; cover them close, and now and then baste them with the liquor ; when done enough, black the tops with a salamander. Stewed Pears. Pare and halve, or quarter large pears, according to their size; throw them into water, as the skin is taken off, before they are divided, to prevent their turning black. Pack them round a block-tin stewpan, and sprinkle as much sugar over as will make them pretty sweet, and add lemon-peel, a clove or two, and some allspice cracked; just cover them with water, and put some of the red liquor, as directed in page 286. Cover them close, and stew three or four hours; when tender, take them out, and pour the liquor from them. Baked Pears. These need not be of a fine sort; but some taste bet- ter than others, and often those that are least fit to eat raw. Wipe, but do not pare, and lay them on tin plates, and bake them in a slow oven. When enough to bear it, flatten them with a silver spoon. When done through, put them on a dish. They should be baked three or four times, and very gently.

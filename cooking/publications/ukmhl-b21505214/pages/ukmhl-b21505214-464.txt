It very rarely happens that servants object to second- ing the kindness of their superiors to the poor ; but should the. cook in any family think the adoption of this plan too troublesome, a gratuity at the end of the winter might repay her, if the love of her fellow-creatures failed of doing it a hundred-fold.

When the fish is served, let the cook put by some of the water, and stew in it the above; as likewise add the gravy that is in the dish, until she obtain all the goodness.

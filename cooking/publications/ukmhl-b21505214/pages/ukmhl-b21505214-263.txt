VIES. 185 Mutton Pie. Cut steaks from a neck or loin of mutton that has hung ; beat them, and remove some of the fat. Season with salt, pepper, and a little onion ; put a little water at the bottom of the dish, and a little paste on the edge ; then cover with a moderately thick paste. Or raise small pies, and breaking each bone in two to shorten it, season, and cover it over, pinching the edge. When they come out, pour into each a spoonful of gravy made of a bit of mutton. Squab Pie. Cut apples as for other pies, and lay them in rows with mutton chops ; shred onion, and sprinkle it among them, and also some sugar. Lamb Pie. Make it of the loin, neck, or breast; the breast of house-lamb is one of the most delicate things that can be eaten. It should be very lightly seasoned with pep- per and salt, the bone taken out, but not the gristles: and a small quantity of jelly gravy be put in hot; but the pie should not be cut till cold. Put two spoonsful of water before baking. Grass-Lamb makes an excellent pie, and may either be boned or not, but not to bone is perhaps the best. Season with only pepper and salt; put two spoonsful of water before baking, and as much gravy when it comes from the oven. Note.â€”Meat pies being fat, it is best to let out the gravy on one side, and put it in again by a funnel, at the centre, and a little may be added. Chicken Pie. Cut up two young fowls, season with white pepper, salt, a little mace, and nutmeg, all in the finest powder; likewise a little cayenne. Put the chicken, slices of ham, or fresh gammon of bacon, forcemeat-balls, and hard eggs, by turns, in layers. If it is to be baked in a dish, put a little water ; but none if in a raised crust.

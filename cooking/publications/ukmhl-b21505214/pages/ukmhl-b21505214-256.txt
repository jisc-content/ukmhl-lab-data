178 DOMESTIC COOKERY. Raised pies must be put into a quick oven, or the crust will fall. The cook should accurately know the proper heat for each article, as opening- the door, to observe their progress, lets in the air, and often spoils them. Cakes or tarts which are returned into the oven, after icing, require heat enough to harden only. Raised Crust for Meat Pies, or Fowls, fyc.

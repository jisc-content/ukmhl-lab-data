POULTRY, GAME, &C. 105 General Directions for Poultry and Game. All poultry should be very carefully picked, every plug be removed, and the hair nicely singed off with white paper. Contrary to the usual custom, all poultry should be drawn as soon as killed, or at least as soon as bought, which prevents the disagreeable flavour so often per- ceived in chickens. The cook must, in doing this, be careful not to crack the gall-bladder, for then no washing will remove the bitterness. Ignorant cooks sometimes draw fowls by cutting a hole in their side, but it should be done through the vent, and that being cut off, a string should fasten the rump close to the front part. Fo%vls for boiling should soak an hour or two in skim- milk. When trussed and singed, flour them well, tie them in a cloth; put them in cold water, and set them over a slow fire ; cover the saucepan close and let them simmer; as soon as the scum rises, remove it carefully, cover them close up again, and boil them gently twenty minutes ; take them off the fire, and the steam will suffi- ciently finish them, if kept in. All poultry requires thorough washing, but above all pigeons, lest the corn on which they feed should remain in the crop: they should not be picked till going to be dressed. Pigeons and ducks may be dressed as soon as killed. In dressing wild-fowl, be careful to keep a clear, brisk fire. Let them be done of a bright brown, but not much roasted, or the fine flavour will be destroyed. They, as well as tame birds, require to be continually basted, and to be sent up beautifully frothed. Tame fowls require more roasting, being longer in heating through. A large fowl will take three-quarters of an hour, a middling one half an hour; and a very small one, or a chicken, twenty minutes. The fire must be quick and clear before any fowls are put down. A capon will require from half an hour to thirty-five minutes ; a goose an hour; wild ducks a quarter of an

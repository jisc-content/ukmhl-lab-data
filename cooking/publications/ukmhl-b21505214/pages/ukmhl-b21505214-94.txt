Serve with anchovy sauce, and a squeeze of lemon. LOBSTERS, SHRIMPS, AND CRAY-FISH. To pot Lobsters. Half boil them, pick out the meat, cut it into small bits, season with mace, white pepper, nutmeg, and salt, press close into a pot, and cover with butter ; bake half an hour; put the spawn in. When cold, take the lobster out, and put it into the pots, with a little of the butter. Beat the other butter in a mortar with some of the spawn : then mix that coloured butter with as much as will be sufficient to cover the pots, and strain it. Cay- enne may be added, if approved. Another way to pot Lobsters as at Woodâ€™s Hotel. Half boil; take out the meat as whole as you can : split the tail and remove the gut ; if the inside be not watery, add it. Season with mace, nutmeg, white pep- per, salt, and a clove or two, in the finest powder. Lay a little fine butter at the bottom of the pan, and the lobster smooth over it. with bay-leaves between ; cover it with butter, and bake gently. When done, pour the whole on the bottom of a sieve, and with a fork lay the pieces into potting-pots, some of each sort, with the seasoning about it. When cold, pour clarified butter over, but not hot. It will be ready for eating next day; and if highly seasoned, and thick-covered with butter, will keep some time. Potted lobster may be eaten cold, or as a fricassee, with cream sauce : it then looks very nicely, and eats excellently, especially if there is spawn. Mackerel, Herrings, and Trout, are good potted as above.

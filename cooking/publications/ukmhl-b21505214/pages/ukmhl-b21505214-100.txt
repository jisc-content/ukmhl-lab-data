DOMESTIC COOKERY. 32 Lamb.—Observe the neck of a fore-quarter: if the vein is bluish, it is fresh ; if it has a green or yellow east, it is stale. In the hind quarter, if there is a faint smell under the kidney, and the knuckle is limp, the meat is stale. If the eyes be sunk, the head is not fresh. Grass lamb comes into season in April or May, and continues till August. House-lamb may be had in great towns almost all the year, but is in highest perfection in December and January. Pork.—Pinch the lean, and if young it will break. If the rind is tough, thick, and cannot easily be impressed by the finger, it is old. A thin rind is a merit in all pork ; and pigs that are short in the legs and bodies, and have thickness in the neck, and not long heads and ears, are always to be preferred. When fresh, the flesh will be smooth and dry ; if clammy, it is tainted. What is called measly pork is very unwholesome, and may be known by the fat being full of kernels, which in good pork is never the case. Pork fed at still-houses does not answer for curing in anyway, the fat being spongy. Dairy-fed pork is the best. Bacon.—If the rind be thin, the fat firm, and of a red tinge, the lean tender, of a good colour, and adher- ing to the bone, you may conclude it good, and not old. If there are yellow streaks in it, it is becoming, if not already, rusty. Hams. —Stick a sharp knife under the bone; if it comes out with a pleasant smell, the ham is good ; but if the knife is daubed and has a bad scent, do not buy it. Hams short in the hock are best, and long-legged pigs are not to be chosen for any preparation of pork. Brawn.—The horny part of the young brawn will feel moderately tender, and the flavour will be better than the old, the rind of which will be hard.

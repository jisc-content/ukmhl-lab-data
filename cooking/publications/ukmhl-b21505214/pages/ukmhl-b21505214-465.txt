Put a tea-cupful of sago into a quart of water, and a bit of lemon-peel; when thickened, grate some ginger, and add half a pint of raisin-wine, brown sugar, and two spoonsful of Geneva; boil all up together. It is a most supporting thing for those whom disease has left very feeble. Caudle for the Sick and Lying-in. Set three quarts of water on the fire ; mix smooth as much oatmeal as will thicken the whole, with a pint of cold water; when boiling, pour the latter in, and twenty Jamaica peppers in fine powder; boil to a good middling thickness; then add sugar, half a pint of well fermented table-beer, and a glass of gin. Boil all. This mess twice, and once or twice of broth, will be of incalculable service. There is not a better occasion for charitable commi- seration than when a person is sick. A bit of meat or pudding sent unexpectedly has often been the means of recalling long-lost appetite. Nor are the indigent alone the grateful receivers ; for in the highest houses a real good siek-cook is rarely met with; and many who possess all the goods of fortune have attributed the first return of health to an appetite excjted by good kitchen-physic, as it is called.

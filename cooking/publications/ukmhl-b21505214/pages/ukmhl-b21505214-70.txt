DOMESTIC COOKERY. 9 Herrings.—If good, their gills are of a fine red, and the eyes bright; as is likewise the whole fish, which must be stiff and firm. Choose sprats by the same rules. Soles.-—If good, they are thick, and the belly is of a cream-colour; if this is of a bluish cast and flabby, they are not fresh. They are in the market almost the whole year, but are in the highest perfection about Midsummer. Whitings.—The firmness of the body and fins is to be looked to, as in herrings; their high season is during the first three months of the year, but they may be had a great part of it. Mackerel.—Choose as whitings. Their season is May, June, and July. They are so tender a fish, that they carry and keep worse than any other. Pike.—For freshness observe the above marks. The best are taken in rivers : they are a very dry fish, and are much indebted to stuffing and sauce. Carp live some time out of water and may therefore get wasted: it is best to kill them as soon as caught, to prevent this: but if too many are taken from the stew for present use, they may be fed with bread, and kept in a large tub. The same signs of freshness attend them as other fish. Tench.—They are a fine-flavoured fresh-water fish, and should be killed and dressed as soon as caught.— When they are to be bought, examine whether the gills are red and hard to open, the eyes bright, and the body stiff. The tench has a slimy matter about it, the clearness and brightness of which show freshness. The season is July, August, and September. Perch.—Take the general rules given to distinguish the freshness of other fish. They are not so delicate as carp and tench. Smelts, if good, have a fine silvery hue, are very firm, and have a refreshing smell like cucumbers newly cut.—They are caught in the Thames and some other large rivers. Mullets.—The sea are preferred to the river mullets.

SWEET DISHES AND SWEETMEATS. 275 ful of water, and squeeze the juice on seven ounces of finely-powdered sugar; beat the yolks of nine eggs well; add the peel and juice beaten together for some time ; then strain it through a flannel into a silver or very nice block-tin saucepan; set it over a gentle fire, and stir it one way till pretty thick, and scalding hot; but not boiling, or it will curdle.

Make it the day before it be wanted. Imperial Cream. Boil a quart of cream with the thin rind of a lemon, then stir it till nearly cold ; have ready, in a dish or bowl that you are to serve in, the juice of three lemons, strained with as much sugar as will sweeten the cream ; which pour into the dish from a large tea-pot, holding it high, and moving it about to mix with the juice.

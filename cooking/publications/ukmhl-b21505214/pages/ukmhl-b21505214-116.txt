DOMESTIC COOKERY. 42 one with fat bacon, a second with parsley, a third with oysters, and so on, each being chopped and seasoned with pepper, salt, nutmeg, and cloves. When com- pletely stuffed, lay it into a pan, dredge it well with flour, pour upon it half a pint of port, and the same of broth. Bake it three hours, and then skim off the fat; put the meat into a dish, strain the gravy over, and gar- nish with pickles. A Fricandeau of Beef. Take a nice bit of lean beef; lard it with bacon sea- soned with pepper, salt, cloves, mace, and allspice. Put it into a stewpan with a pint of broth, a glass of white wine, a bundle of parsley, all sorts of sweet herbs, a clove of garlic, a shalot or two, four cloves, pepper and salt. When the meat is become tender, cover it close ; skim the sauce well, and strain it; set it on the fire, and let it boil till it is reduced to a glaze. Glaze the larded side with this, and serve the meat on sorrel-sauce. To stew a Rump of Beef. Wash it well; and season it high with pepper, Cay- enne, salt, allspice, three cloves, and a blade of mace, all in fine powder. Bind it up tight, and lay it into a pot that will just hold it; resting it. on two or three osier twigs, to prevent the meat from sticking. Fry three large onions sliced, and put them to it, with three carrots, two turnips, a shalot, four cloves, a blade of mace, and some celery. Cover the meat with good beef- broth, or weak gravy. Simmer it as gently as possible for several hours till quite tender. Clear off the fat; and add to the gravy half a pint of port wine, a glass of vinegar, and a large spoonful of ketchup ; simmer half an hour, and serve in a deep dish. Half a pint of table beer may be added. The herbs to be used should be burnet, tarragon, parsley, thyme, basil, savory, mar- joram, pennyroyal, knotted marjoram, and some chives if you can get them ; but observe to proportion the quantities to the pungency of the several sorts; let there be a good handful altogether.

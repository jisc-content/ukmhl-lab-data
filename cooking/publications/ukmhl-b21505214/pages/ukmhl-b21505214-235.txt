157 SAUCES. A nother. Chop twenty-four anchovies, not washed, and ten shalots, and scrape three spoonsful of horseradish; which, with ten blades of mace, twelve cloves, two sliced lemons, half a pint of anchovy liquor, a quart of hock or Rhenish wine, and a pint of water, boil to a quart; then strain off; and when cold, add three large spoons- ful of walnut-ketchup, and put into small bottles well corked. Fish Sauce without Butter. Simmer very gently a quarter of a pint of vinegar and half a pint of water (which must not be hard,) with an onion, half a handful of scraped horseradish, and the following spices lightly bruised; four cloves, two blades of mace, and half a tea-spoonful of black pepper. When the onion is quite tender, chop it small with two anchovies, and set the whole on the fire to boil for a few minutes, with a spoonful of ketchup. In the mean time have ready and well beaten the yolks of three fresh eggs ; strain them, mix the liquor by degrees with them, and when well mixed, set the saucepan over a gentle fire, keeping the basin in one hand, into which toss the sauce to and fro, and shake the saucepan over the fire, that the eggs may not curdle. Do not boil them, only let the sauce be hot enough to give it the thickness of melted butter. Fish Sauce a-la-Craster. Thicken a quarterof a pound of butter with flour, and brown it; then put to it a pound of the best anchovies, cut small, six blades of pounded mace, ten cloves, forty berries of black pepper and allspice, a few small onions, a fagot of sweet herbs (namely, savory, thyme, basil, and knotted marjoram,) and a little parsley and sliced horseradish; on these pour half a pint of the best sherry, and a pint and a half of strong gravy. Simmer all gently for twenty minutes; then strain it through a sieve, and bottle it for use. The way of using it is, to boil some of it in the butter while melting.

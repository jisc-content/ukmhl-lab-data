CAKES. 329 Sponge Cakes. Weigh ten eggs, and their weight in very fine sugar, and that of six in flour; beat the yolks with the flour, and the whites alone, to a very stiff froth ; then by de- grees mix the whites and the flour with the other ingre- dients, and beat them well half an hour. Bake in a quick oven an hour. Another, without Butter. Dry one pound of flour, and one and a quarter of sugar ; beat seven eggs, yolks and whites apart; grate a lemon, and, with a spoonful of brandy, beat the whole together with your hand for an hour. Bake in a but- tered pan, in a quick oven. Sweetmeats may be added, if approved. Tea Cakes. Rub fine four ounces of butter into eight ounces of flour; mix eight ounces of currants, and six of fine Lisbon sugar, two yolks and one white of eggs, and a spoonful of brandy. Roll the paste the thickness of an Oliver biscuit, and cut with a wine-glass. You may beat the other white, and wash over them; and either dust sugar, or not, as you like. Benton Tea Cakes. Mix a paste of flour, a little bit of butter, and milk; roll as thin as possible, and bake on a back-stone over the fire, or on a hot hearth. Another sort, as Biscuits. Rub into a pound of flour six ounces of butter, and three large spoonsful of vest., and make into a paste, with a sufficient quantity of new milk ; make into bis- cuits, and prick them with a clean fork. Another sort. Melt six or seven ounces of butter, with a sufficiency of new milk warmed to make seven pounds of flour into a stiff paste; roll thin, and make into biscuits.

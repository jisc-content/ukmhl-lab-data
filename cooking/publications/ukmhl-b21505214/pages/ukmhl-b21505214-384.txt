DOMESTIC COOKERY. 306 rind; lay them in a china bowl for two or three days, covered with double-refined Sugar (a pound to each citron of a moderate size). Roil the sugar, fruit, and N two or three spoonsful of water together for a quarter of an hour. Two days after, pour the syrup off, and boil it with one pound of sugar: skim, and pour it boil- ing-hot upon the citrons. If the syrup be not rich enough, the boiling must be repeated. Soak twelve races of white ginger in water three days, scrape them well, and boil them in a little thin syrup. When the preserving syrup is boiled the last time, add the ginger to the fruit. When cold, cover with paper and bladder. To preserve Strawberries whole. Take equal weights of the fruit and double-refined sugar ; lay the former in a large dish, and sprinkle half the sugar in fine powder over ; give a gentle shake to the dish, that the sugar may touch the under side of the fruit. Next day make a thin syrup with the remain- der of the sugar, and, instead of water, allow one pint of red currant juice to every pound of strawberries; in this simmer them until sufficiently jellied. Choose the largest scarlets, or others, when not dead ripe. In either of the above ways, they eat well served in thin cream, in glasses. To preserve Strawberries in Wine. Put a quantity of the finest large strawberries into a gooseberry-bottle, and strew in three large spoonsful of fine sugar: fill up with Madeira wine, or fine sherry. To dry Cherries with Sugar. Stone six pounds of Kentish; put them into a pre- serving-pan, with two pounds of loaf-sugar pounded and strewed among them ; simmer till they begin to shrivel; then strain them from the juice ; lay them on a hot hearth, or in an oven, when either is cool enough to dry without baking them. The same syrup will do another six pounds of fruit.

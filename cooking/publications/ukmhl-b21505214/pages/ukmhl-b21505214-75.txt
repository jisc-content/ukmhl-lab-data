7 FISH. Next divide the callapash, or back shell, from the callapee, the belly shell, at about two inches round the latter, which is some of the prime of the turtle. Take out the entrails with particular care, lest the gall should be broken, and throw them into a tub of cold water: when well washed, open the guts from end to end with a small penknife, and draw them through a woollen cloth often, to cleanse them, then put them in fresh cold water. The belly shell must be cut in pieces the size of the palm of the hand, and the lungs, kidney, &c., cleared from the back shell: put the shells and fins into scalding water, until the scales can be scraped off with a knife, and all the meat can be taken clear off. Be sure to keep the different parts of the turtle separate, that they may be proportioned out afterwards. The g-reen fat cut in pieces the size of an inch and a half square ; simmer the fins, only in as much water as will cover them, till tender ; then add the water, strained, to a quantity of very rich broth of veal, to which put a pound of butter rubbed down, with as much fine flour as shall give due thickness; stir it over the fire ten minutes; having put in the entrails, cut in small pieces, six hours to stew before dinner; add to the soup green onions and all sorts of seasoning herbs, chopped small ; pepper, salt, and Cayenne to your taste, not extremely hot, and the juice of one or two lemons, according to the size of the turtle, which, if fifty pounds’ weight, will require two bottles of Madeira : let all this seasoning be simmered six hours, some of the coarse and white parts two hours, and a proportion of the green fat one hour. Put round the back shell a paste of flour and water about two inches high, to keep in the meat; then fill it three parts with the remainder of the coarse, the part that resembles veal, the green fat, &c., and some of the thin soup, and additional seasoning : bake it. To prepare small eggs for serving in the soup and shell, unless there be any in the turtle, see ‘ Little eggs for Turtle,’ under the head Sauces.

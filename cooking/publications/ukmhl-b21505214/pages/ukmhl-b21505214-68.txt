liv DIRECTIONS FOR CARVING. by passing the knife under it towards the neck. Cut the other parts as in a fowl. The breast, wings, and merrythought are the most esteemed; but the leg has a high flavour. Partridges.—The partridge is here represented as just taken from the spit; but before it is served up, the skewers must be withdrawn. It is cut up in the same manner as a fowl. The wings must be taken off in the line a, b, and the merrythought in the line c, d. The prime parts of a partridge are the wings, breast, and merrythought; but the bird being small, the two latter are not often divided. The wing is considered as the best, and the tip of it is reckoned the most delicate mor- sel of the whole. Pigeons.—Cut them in half, either from top to bot- tom,! or across. The lower part is generally thought the best; but the fairest way is to cut from the neck to a, figure 7, rather than from c to b, by a, which is the most fashionable. The figure represents the back of the pigeon; and the direction of the knife is in the line c, b, by a, if done the last way.

PUDDINGS. 209 must be dipped in boiling water, squeezed dry, and floured before used. If the pudding be of bread, the cloth should be tied so as to allow for swelling ; if of flour, tight. Basins or forms are much better than cloths for boiling puddings. The water should boil quick when the pudding is put in ; and it should be moved about for a minute or two, that the ingredients may not separate. Very good puddings may be made without eggs; but they should have very little liquid in them, and must boil longer than puddings with eggs. Two or three spoonsful of fresh table-beer, or one of yest, will serve instead of eggs, as also will snow. Two large spoonsful of snow will supply the place of one egg, and make a pudding equally good. This is a useful piece of infor- mation, as snow generally falls in the season when eggs are dear. The sooner it is used after it falls the better; but it may be taken up from a clean spot, and kept in a cool place some hours, without losing its good quali- ties. Bottled malt liquors are also a good substitute for ejrcrs: the sooner used after the cork is drawn the better. The yolks and whites, beaten long and sepa- rately, make the article they are put into much lighter. Eggs must be always strained after beating. To avoid repetition, let it be observed, that when pud- ding-sauce is ordered, wine, sugar, and very thick melted butter, boiled up together, is the sauce intended. All dishes in which puddings are baked must be lined an inch or two below the edge, as well as on it; and that part of the dish must be first rubbed with butter. If a pudding is to be turned out, the whole dish must be buttered, and lined with paste. The ingredients of puddings should not be piit into the basin or dish till the minute they go into the water or oven. Great care is necessary to prevent rich crusts from becoming brown, which makes them rank. A piece of paper put over them will preserve the colour. Sago, and all sorts of seeds, should,lie in water an

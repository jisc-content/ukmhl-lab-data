DIRECTIONS TO SERVANTS. 393 and only touch the part affected, and be instantly washed off. Use the following liquid :â€”Into a pint of cold- drawn linseed-oil, put four-pennyworth of alkanet-root, and two-pennyworth of rose-pink, in an earthen vessel; let it remain all night; then stirring well, rub some of it all over the tables with a linen rag; when it has lain some time, rub it bright with linen cloths. Eating tables should be covered with mat, oil-cloth, or baize, to prevent staining, and be instantly rubbed when the dishes are taken off, while still warm. To take Ink out of Mahogany. Dilute half a tea-spoonful of oil of vitriol, with a large spoonful of water, and touch the part with a feather; watch it, for if it stays too long it will leave a white mark. It is therefore better to rub it quick, and repeat if not quite removed. Floor-cloths Should be chosen that are painted on a fine cloth, which is well covered with the colour, and the flowers on which do not rise much above the ground, as they wear out first. The durability of the cloth will depend much on these two particulars, but more especially on the time it has been painted, and the goodness of the colours. If they have not been allowed sufficient space for becoming thoroughly hardened, a very little use will injure them ; and as they are very expensive articles, care in pre- serving them is necessary. It answers to keep them some time before they are used, either hung up in a dry barn where they will have air, or laid down in a spare room. When taken up for the winter, they should be rolled round a carpet-roller, and observe not to crack the paint by turning the edges in too suddenly. Old carpets answer extremely well, painted and sea- soned some months before laid down. If for passages, the width must be directed when they are sent to the manufactory, as they are cut before painting.

DOMESTIC COOKERY. 142 with a tea-spoonful of flour rubbed smooth in it, is a great improvement. Skate Soup. Make it of the stock directed for fish soup,-with an ounce of vermicelli boiled in it, a little before it is served. Then add half a pint of cream, beaten with the yolks of two eggs. Stir it near, but not on the fire. Serve it with a small French roll made hot in a Dutch oven, and then soaked in the soup an hour. Excellent Lobster Soup. Take the meat from the claws, bodies, and tails of six small lobsters; take away the brown fur, and the bag in the head ; beat the fins, chine, and small claws, in a mortar. Boil it very gently in two quarts of water, with the crumb of a French roll, some ground white pepper, salt, two anchovies, a large onion, sweet herbs, and a bit of lemon-peel, till you have extracted the goodness of them all. Strain it olf. Beat the spawn in a mortar, with a bit of butter, a quarter of a nutmeg, and a tea- spoonful of flour: mix it with a quart of cream. Cut the tails into pieces, and give them a boil up with the cream and soup. Serve with forcemeat-balls made of the remainder of the lobster, mace, pepper, salt, a few crumbs, and an egg or two. Let the balls be made up with a bit of flour, and heated in the soup. Crayfish or Prawn Soup. Boil six whitings, and a large eel, (or the eel and half a thornback, well cleaned,) with as much water as will cover them ; skim them clean; and put in whole pepper, mace, ginger, parsley, an onion, a little thyme, and three cloves. Boil to a mash. Pick a sufficient num- ber of crayfish, or prawns; pound the shells and a little roll; but first boil them with a little water, vinegar, salt, and herbs: put this liquor over the shells in a sieve: then pour the other soup clear from the sediment. Chop a lobster, and add this to it, with a quart of good beef- gravy ; and also the tails of the crayfish, or the prawns.

Raspberry Cakes. Pick out any bad raspberries that are among the fruit, weigh and boil what quantity you please, and when mashed, and the liquor is wasted, put to it sugar the weight of the fruit you first put into the pan ; mix it well off the fire until perfectly dissolved, then put it on China plates, and dry it in the sun. As soon as the top part dries, cut with the cover of a canister into small cakes, turn them on fresh plates, and when dry, put them in boxes with layers of paper. China-orange Juice. A very useful thing to mix with water in Fevers, when the fresh juice cannot be pro- cured. Squeeze from the finest fruit a pint of juice strained through fine muslin, and gently simmer with three quar- ters of a pound of double-refined sugar twenty minutes : when cold, put in small bottles. Orgeat. Boil a quart of new milk with a stick of cinnamon, sweeten to your taste, and let it grow cold ; then pour it by degrees to three ounces of almonds, and twenty hitter, that have been blanched and beaten to a paste, with a little water to prevent oiling: boil all together, and stir till cold, then add half a glass ot brandy. Another ivay. Blanch and pound three-quarters of a pound of al- monds, and thirty bitter, with a spoonful of water. Stir in by degrees two pints of water, and three of milk, and strain the whole through a cloth. Dissolve half a pound of fine sugar in a pint of water, boil and skim it well; mix it with the other, as likewise two spoonsful of orange-flower water, and a tea-cupful of the best brandy.

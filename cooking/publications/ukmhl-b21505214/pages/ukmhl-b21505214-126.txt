52 DOMESTIC COOKERY. Beef d-la-vinaigrette. Cot a slice of underdone boiled beef three inches thick, and a little fat; stew it in half a pint of water, a glass of white (not sweet) wine, a bunch of sweet herbs, an onion, and a bay-leaf; season it with three cloves pounded, and pepper, till the liquor is nearly wasted away, turning it once.

After cleaning the tongue well, salt it with common salt and saltpetre three days ; then boil it, and likewise a fine young udder with some fat to it, (but separately from the tongue,) till both are tolerably tender; let them become cold; then tie the thick part of one to the thin

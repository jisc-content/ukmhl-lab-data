PIES. 179 and the entrails, except the little bag-,) a small quantity of fat bacon, a few crumbs, the flesh of wild or tame fowls, pepper, and salt. Lard the breasts of pheasants, partridges, woodcocks, moor-game, or whatever birds you have, with bacon of different sizes : cut the legs and wings from the backs, and divide the backs. Sea- son them all with white pepper, a little Jamaica pepper, mace, and salt. Make a thick raised crust to receive the above articles : it is thought better than a dish; but either will do. Line it closely with slices of fine, fresh, fat bacon ; then cover it with stuffing, and put the dif- ferent parts of the game lightly on it, with whole green truffles, and pieces of stuffing among and over it; ob- serving not to crowd the articles, so as to cause them to be under-baked. Over the whole lay slices of fat bacon, and then a cover of thick common crust. Bake it slowly, according to the size of the pie, which will require a lor. g time. Some are made with a pheasant in the middle, whole; and the other game cut up and put round it. Eel Pie. Cut the eels in lengths of two or three inches, after skinning them; season with pepper and salt, and place in the dish, with some bits of butter, and a little water; and cover it with paste. Middle-sized eels do best. Cod Pie. Take a piece of the middle of a small cod, and salt it well one night; next day wash it; season with pepper, salt, and a very little nutmeg, mixed ; place in a dish, and put some butter on it, and a little good broth of any kind into the dish. Cover it with a crust; and when done, add a sauce of a spoonful of broth, a quarter of a pint of cream, a little flour and butter, a grate of lemon and nutmeg-, and give it one boil. Oysters may be added. Mackerel will do well, but do not salt them till used. Parsley picked and put in may be used instead of oysters. n 2

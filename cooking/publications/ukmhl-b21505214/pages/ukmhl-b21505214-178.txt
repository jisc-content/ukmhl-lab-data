104 DOMESTIC COOKERY. and inclining to dusky yellow ; a wild one lias the feet reddish, and smaller than the tame. They should be picked dry. Ducklings must be scalded. Pigeons should be very fresh; when they look flabby about the vent, and that part is discoloured, they are stale. The feet should be supple; if old, the feet are harsh. The tame ones are larger than the wild, and are thought best by some persons; they should be fat and tender; but many are deceived in their size, because a full crop is as large as the whole body of a small pigeon. The flesh of the wood-pigeon is dark-coloured : if pro- per'y kept, the flavour is equal to teal. Plovers.—Choose those that feel hard at the vent, which shows they are fresh. In other respects choose them by the same marks as other fowl. When stale, the feet are dry. They will keep sweet a long time, and are better for hanging. There are three sorts; the gray, green, and bastard plover, or lapwing. Hare or Rabbit.—If the claws are blunt and rugged, the ears dry and tough, and the haunch thick, it is old; but if the claws are smooth and sharp, the ears easily tear, and the cleft in the lip is not much spread, it is young. If fresh and newly killed, the body will be stiff, and, in hares, the flesh pale. But they keep a good while by proper care; and are best when rather begin- ning to turn, if the inside is preserved from being- musty. To know a real leveret, you should look for a knob, or small bone, near the foot on its fore-leg; if there is none, it is a hare. Partridges.—They are in season in autumn. If young, the bill is of a dark colour, and the legs yellow- ish ; if fresh, the vent will be firm ; but this part will look greenish if stale. Pheasants.—The cock-bird is accounted best, except when the hen is with egg. If young, he has short blunt or round spurs ; but if old, they are long and sharp.

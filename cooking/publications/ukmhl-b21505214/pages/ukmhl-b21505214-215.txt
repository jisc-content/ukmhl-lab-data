137 SOUPS. Scotch Barley Broth. Set on the fire two ounces of pearl barley, with three Scotch pints of salt water; when it boils, skim it, and add what quantity of salt beef or fresh brisket you choose, and a marrow-bone, with a good quantity of leeks, cabbages, or savoys, and let it simmer four or five hours. Or you may use turnips, onions, and grated carrots. Scotch Mutton Broth. Soak a neck of mutton in water for an hour; cut off the scrag, and put it into a stewpan with two quarts of water. As soon as it boils, skim it well, and then sim- mer it an hour and a half; then take the best end of the mutton, cut it into pieces (two bones in each), take some of the fat off, and put as many as you think proper: skim the moment the fresh meat boils up, and every quarter of an hour afterwards. Have ready four or five carrots, the same number of turnips, and three onions, all cut, but not small; and put them in soon enough to get quite tender: add four large spoonsful of Scotch barley, first wetted with cold water. The meat should stew three hours. Salt to taste, and serve all together. Twenty minutes before serving, put in some chopped parsley and some salt. It is an excellent winter-dish. Hare Soup. Take an old hare that is good for nothing else, cut it into pieces, and lay it at the bottom of a soup-pot, with a pound and a half of lean beef, two or three shank-bones of mutton well cleaned, a slice of lean bacon or ham, an onion, and a bunch of sweet herbs ; pour on it two quarts of boiling water; cover the pot into which you put these with bladder and paper, and set it in a kettle of water. Simmer it till the hare is stewed to pieces; strain off the liquor, and give it one boil, with an anchovy cut into pieces; and add a spoon- ful of soy, a little cayenne and salt. A few fine force-

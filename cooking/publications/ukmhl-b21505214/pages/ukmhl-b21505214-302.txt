DOMESTIC COOKERY. 224 it eight ounces of blanched almonds, beaten fine with two spoonsful of rose-water, the yolks of six eggs, six ounces of shred candied lemon and citron, a pound of beef-marrow, half a pound of currants, the grated rind of half a lemon, two large spoonsful of brandy, and the same of sweet wine. Put a paste round the dish, and bake it thirty-five minutes. Sift sugar over when served. While beating the eggs put in a pinch of salt. Suet Pudding.

Baked Suet Pudding. Boil a pint of milk: when become cold, stir it into eight ounces of flour, and six of shred suet; add two eggs, and a tea-spoonful of salt. If to be plum-pudding, put in eight or ten ounces of stoned raisins, and omit the salt. Veal-Suet Pudding. Cut the crumb of a threepenny loaf into slices; boil and sweeten two quarts of new milk, and pour over it. When soaked, pour out a little of the milk; and mix with six eggs well beaten, and half a nutmeg. Lay the slices of bread into a dish ; with layers of currants and veal-suet shred, a pound of each.

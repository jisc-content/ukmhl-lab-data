DOMESTIC COOKERY. 346 brandy ; stop it close for twelve months; then rack it off, but without the dregs ; filter them through a bag of flannel of three or four folds; add the clear to the quan- tity, and pour one or two quarts of brandy, according to the size of the vessel. Stop it up, and at the end of three years, you may either bottle it, or drink it from the cask. Raisin wine would be extremely good, if made rich of the fruit, and kept long, which improves the flavour greatly. Raisin Wine wilh Cyder. Put two hundred weight of Malaga raisins into a cask and pour upon them a hogshead of good sound cyder that is not rough; stir it well two or three days; stop it, and let it stand six months: then rack into a cask that it will fill, and put in a gallon of the best brandy. If raisin wine be much used, it would answer well to keep a cask always for it, and bottle off one yearâ€™s wine just in time to make the next, which, allowing the six months of infusion, would make the wine to be eighteen months old. In cyder counties this way is very econo- mical ; and even if not thought strong enough, the addi- tion of another quarter of a hundred of raisins would be sufficient, and the wine would still be very cheap. When the raisins are pressed through a horse-hair bag they will either produce a good spirit by distillation, and must be sent to a chemist who will do it (but if for that purpose they must be very little pressed): or they will make excellent vinegar, on which article see page 166. The stalks should be picked out for the above, and may be thrown into any cask of vinegar that is making, being very acid. Raisin Wine without Cyder. On four hundred weight of Malagas pour one hogs- head of spring-water, stir well daily for fourteen days, then squeeze the raisins in a horse-hair bag in a press, and tun the liquor; when it ceases to hiss, stop it close. In six months rack it off into another cask, or into a

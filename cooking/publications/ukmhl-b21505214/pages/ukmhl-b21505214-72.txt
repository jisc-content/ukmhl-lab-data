DOMESTIC COOKERY. 4 Prawns and Shrimps.—When fresh they have a sweet flavour, are firm and stiff, and the colour is bright. Oysters.—There are several kinds ; the Pyfleet, Col- chester, and Milford, are much the best. The native Milton are fine, being- white and fat; but others may be made to possess both these qualities in some degree by proper feeding. When the fish is alive and strong, the shell closes on the knife. They should be eaten as opened, the flavour becoming- poor otherwise. The rock oyster is largest, but usually has a coarse flavour if eaten raw. OBSERVATIONS ON DRESSING FISH. If the fishmonger does not clean it, fish is seldom very nicely done. Common cooks are apt not to slit the fish low enough, by which, and not thoroughly washing the blood, &c., from the bone, a very disgusting mass is left within, and mistaken for liver; but fishmongers in great towns wash it beyond what is necessary for cleaning, and by perpetual watering diminish the flavour. Salt should be put into the water in which all fish is boiled ; and cod is rendered firmer by the addition of two or three spoonsful of vinegar. Cod, haddock, and whiting eat firmer if a little salt be put into their gills, and they be hung up a few hours before dressing-. Care must be taken to preserve the roe, melt, and liver whole ; to let them be sufficiently dressed ; and to place them conspicuously when served. The sound adhering to the bone must be left there, but very care- fully cleaned. Fish that is to be boiled must be put on the fire in cold hard water: when it boils skim with the greatest care; throw in a little cup of cold water to check the extreme of heat, then keep it simmering only, lest the outside break before the thick and inner be done. The cover should be kept on the kettle, to prevent any dust or soot falling on the fish, the good colour of which is important. Crimped fish should be put into boiling water, and simmered a few minutes.

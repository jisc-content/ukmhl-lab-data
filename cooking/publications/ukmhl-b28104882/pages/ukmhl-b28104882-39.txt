27 The Gas Cooking-Stove It cannot, however, be got into condition so readily as gas, since heat from a coal fire is, of course, much harder to raise ; therefore, if speed is the chief consideration—speed and readiness,— choose gas and a gas stove. But if speed is of less importance, if wear and tear, flavour and per- fection are more prized, and if time and thought can be given to secure the same, choose the kitchener. The reason why the kitchener succeeds better as a baking stove is because the flame passes over the top before it goes underneath the oven ; it does not mount from below as in the gas oven, nor does it induce a steam, as the enamel-sheathed stove is apt to do. On the other hand, it does not roast nearly so well, for the very reasons mentioned. Its table-like top is a convenience for boiling purposes, although this is a minor con- sideration. The flat that would be perfectly equipped ought, it seems, to have both gas stove and kitchener. It can, if you abolish the range ; and there is no reason why, even if the range exists, a tenant should not ask to have it taken down and the kitchener which he buys himself fitted in, in such a manner as to be removable when a change is made. I would advocate the proper fitting-in of both kitchener and gas stove, the best that can be

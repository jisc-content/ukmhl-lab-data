io6 The Model Kitchen possess a tea-pot of this order should buy a sepa- rate infuser of metal, and use it in the ordinary urn or pot. The comfort of always having your tea of the right strength, free from stray leaves and stalk, is great ; the benefit of having it free from harmful matter is greater still. A heated tea-pot, water at the right point of boiling, and a good blend of tea, brewing just the right number of minutes and no more, then keep- ing hot without the leaves—with these precautions you can scarcely fail to have a good cup, whether you adulterate it with milk and sugar, or drink it pure. The new “extending” table-heater is a most ornamental addition to the table, being fashioned in burnished copper. It may be had with one spirit-lamp or two ; and its flat, extending top will not only keep coffee-pot and milk-jugs hot, but a tea-kettle, and breakfast dishes.

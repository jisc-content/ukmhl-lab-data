The Mode! Kitchen 56 and other things of similar order, and the follow- ing is a capital winter supper dish :â€” Two pounds of the lean breast of veal or mutton ; remove the fat, if any, and cut into even pieces, place them in the marmite with a sprinkling of salt and pepper, some short lengths of celery and leeks, an onion, and teacupful of pearl barley ; add water enough to cover well. Cook gently on the top of the stove for at least two hours, skim, remove fat from the surface ; and the bones if possible ; then serve from the marmite at table, a serviette being folded round it. For all kinds of vegetable soups and purees I prefer to use the marmite in preference to any- thing else ; it is excellent, too, for things which have to be kept hot for tardy comers. The Casserole ready for the Table.

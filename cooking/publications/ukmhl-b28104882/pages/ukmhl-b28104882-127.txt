How to serve a Dinner without a Maid 115 points about coffee-making which it is not well to trust to the most reliable of “ chars.” The cups and saucers, with cream and sugar, if not able to be accommodated on the sideboard, should have a tray or table in another corner of the room, so that when bringing in the coffee the hostess has but to walk over and fill them, trust- ing to some cavalier to hand them round. It may, of course, be thought better to have these served in the drawing-room later on, and, if so, a finger-bowl set on plate with small doyley would be the last thing to hand round at the table, some crystallised fruit or other dessert being placed thereon at same time. When the guests adjourn and have settled to books and music, the hostess can generally manage to slip back and arrange that all food is put away safely ; the silver and knives into pitchers of water, if not able to be washed at once ; and otherwise see that all is going right behind the scenes. If her helper is under contract to stay and finish washing-up properly, the food should be all that need be considered by the mistress. The table itself can generally be left until the guests have departed, unless the dining-room is turned into a smoke-room, when it will be better to take off the cloth, leaving only the polished board and flowers.

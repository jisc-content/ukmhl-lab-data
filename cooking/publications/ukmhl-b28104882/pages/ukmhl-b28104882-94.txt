They need a thick gravy to accompany them, therefore are best served in a silver dish, the gravy poured into the centre. Curries of vegetables, or of eggs, make ex- cellent entries, and a salmi or savoury stew, with wine, one of a richer class. Fillets of veal, grenadines, veal en blanquette (that is, in a sauce to which cream has been added), and fillets of beef garnished after any manner you please, are also entree dishes. So again are little made-up savouries which are served in pastry cases, like bouchees, timbales, etc. And macaroni in various forms may come into this category also. The pastry cases should be made of flaky or very short crust, as this is really nicer than puff paste, but if a vol-au-vent is desired only puff paste is possible. The sauce used with the filling of a vol-au-vent is rich also, generally with a cream addition ; and a very white meat, or fish in flakes, or picked shrimps are added to it. One of the nicest little entrees you can wish for, and easily made, is a well-flavoured mince of meat in croustades garnished with carefully poached eggs.

In the old grill, tor instance, there was a hardening and carbonizing of the outside of meat in order to cook, yet retain, the juices within •—a sort of frying-pan action : now, by a more perfect system of combustion of air and gas, by which the article to be cooked is not merely treated with heat from gas, but by superheated air, and all over alike at the same time, there is an in- stantaneous action which coagulates the albumen near the surface, preventing the escape of juices from the interior, while these, becoming heated, expand the fibres, and in a much shorter time attain that state of chemical action which we understand by anything being “ cooked,” namely, prepared for digestion. This improved system of combustion abolishes also those injurious sulphur compounds which made the use of a gas cooker a dread in some households in earlier days. What has given such a spurt to invention and improvement is, of course, the growth in popularity of electricity. As a lighting medium, we prefer it for our flat; but, for some years to come, gas is sure to remain the mainstay on which we depend for cooking purposes. Nevertheless, gas only

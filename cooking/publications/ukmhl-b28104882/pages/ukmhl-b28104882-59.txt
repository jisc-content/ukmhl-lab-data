The Chafing-Dish 47 ounce of butter. When soft, crush them down, rub in a tea-spoonful of fecule or potato-flour, and add a large cupful of good bone-stock ; stir over the flame until it boils, then rub the whole through a fine sieve or tamis. Add now a salt- spoonful of salt, a pinch of mixed peppers, two tea-spoonfuls of finest curry powder or paste, one of chutney, and two of dried cocoanut, and a few drops of vinegar, or glass of white wine. Mix all thoroughly well, and let the flame under the dish be lowered, or fill the bottom pan with water, and set the chafer over it. Let the sauce simmer for at least half an hour by itself, then place in it whatever is being served as a curry : if meat, let this be thinly and neatly sliced ; poultry, cut into the smallest joints ; fish, in cutlets, rolls, or flakes ; and eggs halved or sliced. Let the simmering go on gently for another half-hour at least, more if you can. Serve a curry straight from the chafing-dish, with dry, cooked rice in a separate dish beside you. Very passable curries are to be bought ready prepared, and these can be heated in the chafing- dish with a minimum amount of trouble, serving with rice as usual. Indeed, for all kinds of things which want setting forth at short notice, I regard the chafer as an invaluable assistant.

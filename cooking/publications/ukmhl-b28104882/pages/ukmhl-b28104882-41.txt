V OIL STOVES AND BACHELOR EQUIPMENTS IN considering the modern twentieth-century flat on the larger scale, belonging to the family, we must not leave out of sight the fact that it exists also in a miniature or bijou form, as the menage of the bachelor—man or maid. To such the fittings and conveniences of their small dwelling are of quite as much importance as to the householder on the larger scale ; perhaps they are of even more importance, for in this case there is not any question as to which pair of hands the work shall be entrusted—therefore the best and most suitable tools must be found and used. The bachelor-flat is, however, so well established an institution in modern life that its needs and requirements are every whit as well catered for as any other type, and it has its especial con- trivances, its especial provisions. To these we may well devote some of our space.

116 The Model Kitchen In looking over the menu here given, it will be seen that there is nothing which could not have been prepared and cooked in the morning. To have a joint of meat and choice of vegetables obviously entails much more labour, and necessi- tates going back and forth between kitchen and dining-room, as it is forced to go on cooking until almost the last moment. Moreover, it is more difficult to carve a joint at a sideboard, and, if it is done at table, it frequently calls for more skill than any one but the hostess herself possesses. Chickens, again, if left whole, are equally as difficult to manage, and entail many things in the way of accompaniment. What is easily com- passed in a private way is quite otherwise when you want to carry on a conversation and keep cool-headed whilst serving a number. Hence, it will be seen that the selection of something in the nature of a ragout or braise, a stew or curry, is far more suitable. But there is choice enough and to spare in this range only. Puddings, fruit dishes, and fancy sweets are always more acceptable served cold rather than warm, at the end of a dinner of several courses, and this again facilitates matters for the enter- tainer. One nice dish, rather than two inferior ones, is ever the best taste.

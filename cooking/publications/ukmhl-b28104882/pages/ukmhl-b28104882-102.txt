90 The Model Kitchen simmering given, produces a dish very popular in Dutch households. Very savoury it is too. Sea-kale, celery, and asparagus, which when served lie evenly in the dish, need trimming and tying in bundles before boiling ; but in boiling asparagus, if you have not a proper pan which keeps the stalks standing upright, you must so arrange that the tops do not go into water until the stalk ends are nearly tender, otherwise the tips will be liable to fall off before the rest is cooked. Chicory is boiled like sea- kale, and, when served with white sauce, makes a delicious change in spring-time, when our choice in vegetables is somewhat reduced. Beetroot needs very careful washing, lest the fine skin should be rubbed off and the flavour be lost ; but it needs hours of steady boiling to make the root tender. It should not be skinned until cold, unless it is wanted for a hot dish, with some sharp sauce. Usually it is one of our salad reserves. Spinach needs the most thorough washing in several waters, and a French cook will take the trouble to strip all the larger leaves down by the mid-rib. If crushed down into a pan, a liberal sprinkling of salt added, there is no need of more water, what drains from the leaves being sufficient to make steam, and then less pressing suffices.

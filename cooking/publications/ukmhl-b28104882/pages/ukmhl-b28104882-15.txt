3 Introduction makes to a similar excuse, when he says, <c There was light enough for a clean-soul d cook to cook by, and for one who was not clean-soul’d no amount of light would have sufficed. It is neither want of space nor want of light which need deter us from making a complete success of the flat kitchen. The skill with which we use the means we find at our disposal is the test by which we must be judged. Now skill is largely a matter of adaptation— the adaptation first of ideas, then of means. You cannot arrange and plan and furnish the kitchen of your flat according to the ideas that have governed the plenishings and the arrangements of the kitchen in the roomy old house in which, probably, you grew up. And even if you had space and materials at command, you might not have the means to do so. But when preconceived notions have been done away with, and you have begun to look about you for what a new era has provided for its own requirements, you will see that the change of ideas is altogether to your advantage. Then, again, the smaller space and the fewer tools you have at command mean also a possibility of reducing the amount of service needed. One maid, at the very most two, will have to combine the functions of cook, kitchen-, scullery-, and parlour-maid all in one.

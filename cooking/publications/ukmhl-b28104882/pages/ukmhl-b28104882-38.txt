The Model Kitchen 26 ally in favour of modern gas inventions of any kind. You may find her accepting the services of a gas ring for boiling purposes ; but for her roast or stew or braiseâ€”no ! She does not trust her terrine to anything so fierce as a gas flame ; her marmite she would far rather see set upon the charcoal braisier than upon a gas ring : and she is right. There is some subtle sympathy, springing from a sense of fitness, which suits the medium and the purpose so exactly to one another. And my own sympathies go out towards the cuisiniere, I must confess. Its simple but handsome build and its brilliant exterior, its convenience, its economy, and cleanliness are strongly attractive. But, as I said, the American kitchener is only first cousin and imitator, and we in this country know the kitchener far better than we know the stove it imitates, therefore it is the merits of the latter that we must set, in a critical and careful spirit against those of the gas stove, when con- sidering the requirements of our flat. As a baking stove, for pastry and cakes, and as a stove calculated to suit particularly well the fireproof clay and china we have chosen for our utensils, the kitchener certainly has an advantage over gas. It is equally economical, for the amount of coal it consumes is small, therefore the amount of waste refuse it makes is small also.

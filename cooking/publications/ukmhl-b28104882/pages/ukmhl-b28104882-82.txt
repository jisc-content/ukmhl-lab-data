The Model Kitchen 70 standard by which outsiders judge, condemn, and are influenced. In the small household, with limited help, the artistic and scientific arrangement of a menu resolves itself rather into a study first of con- venience. A stove cannot be crowded with a number of things all requiring attention at the same moment, nor can a cook fry, make sauce, crush a puree, and dress vegetables all at the same time. Hence what it is possible to do and what one would like to do have to be taken as moderators one of another. But in studying the matter, it is often found that the possible grows on the imagination, and that, where there is a will to do, there can generally be found a capacity for doing. Hence it is well to let the question of “ What shall we have for dinner to-day ? ” resolve itself into a blend of harmony, capability, and suitability. Here I give, as suggestions, a list of such com- bined foods as are correctly served together— With all clear soups, serve bread or rolls, baked crusts or toast. „ „ thick white soups, serve grated cheese. „ „ fish soups, serve light flaky rusks or biscuits, or croutons. „ „ rich and thick soups like mock turtle, serve hard- boiled eggs sliced, and cut lemon.

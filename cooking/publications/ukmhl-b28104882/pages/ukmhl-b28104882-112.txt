The Model Kitchen IOO her when they came what was meant by “ boiling water,” or the different temperatures at which it boils, and what chemical changes take place during and after boiling. We boil water in the kitchen for two purposes —for the cooking of water itself to remove dan- gerous germs, and for the cooking of other materials in it. The boiling-point of water under ordinary conditions is 2 12° Fahr. When bubbles lorm on the bottom of the kettle, come up slowly to the surface, and rupture quietly without making ebullition, we have simmering ; at this point the thermometer should register i8o° Fahr. It is at this temperature that we cook meat and fish and make soups. When the bubbles form rapidly on the sides and come to the top of the water, and there is motion in the water, still it has not really reached the boiling-point ; it is giving off the atmospheric gases which have been absorbed within it. Only when the thermometer reaches 2 12° does water really boil, and it is then in rapid motion, continuing to give off atmospheric gases with the steam it makes. Exactly when it ceases to give off these gases it were difficult to say, but, generally speaking, after water has boiled rapidly lor about ten minutes it is freed from all gas and rendered tasteless—quite unfit for the making of tea or coffee. Boiled water is flat, too flat lor

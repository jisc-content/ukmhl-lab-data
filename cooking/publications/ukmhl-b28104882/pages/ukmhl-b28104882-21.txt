Introduction 9 and common salt sprinkled over carpets makes their sweeping easier and refreshes the colours. In a flat, more than anywhere else, one has to keep clean as much by prevention as by the actual process of cleaning. Much sweeping merely succeeds in displacing dirt from one part to deposit it in another ; I would advocate as little sweeping with long-handled brooms as may be, and more use of a dampened duster and of cloths for wiping over carpets and floors. For carpets and rugs a woollen cloth, wrung out of hot water into which a little ammonia has been put, removes the dust much more effectually than any sweep- ing or brushing. To pick up loose bits and remove footmarks or dirt in places, is better than to let dust lie until a regular time for cleaning comes round ; the furniture is spared, and so are the mouldings and edges of doors, for it is round these that dust drifts and collects. When sweep- ing has to be done, let all the furniture be carefully covered ; and, before uncovering it, give attention first to the cornices and mouldings, wiping every- where with the damp cloth before other dusting begins. Unless some special rule prevails in the flat as to the removal of waste refuse and ashes, a closed sanitary dust-bin, which can be removed bodily and replaced at stated times, is a necessity.

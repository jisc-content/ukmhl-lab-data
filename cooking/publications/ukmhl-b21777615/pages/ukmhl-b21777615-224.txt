The word phrenology comes from the Greek, and means words or discourses on the mind. It was founded by Dr. F. J. Gall, a Viennese doctor (1758—1828), and extended by Spurzheim—who was Gall's associate and pupil—by George and Andrew Combe, Dr. Elliotson, and others.

Uut Dhvsiology and anatomy show that the exterior of the brain is not a reliable or correct index to character or mind; and manv eminent scientific men have strongly opposed the system. On the other hand, there does appear to be some evidence in favour of some of the generalizations and of some localization of faculties. No wear and tear

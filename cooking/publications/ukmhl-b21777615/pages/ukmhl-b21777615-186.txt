"SUNLIGHT" YEAR-BOOK* ^Literature* EVENTS OF 1896=7. History. If there has "been no great epoch-making "book published during the year, there has been an abundance of good, sound, wholesome literatureâ€”much of it of a very high average. Concerning history, it may be mentioned that Dr. W. 8. Aubrey has completed his "Bise and Growth of the English Nation," and Messrs. Longmans have been engaged upon a new edition of Lord Macaulay's Life and "Works, the issue of which has been completed in about six months. The tendency now, however, is to write history in periods, or in episodes. So we have the " Courtships " of Queen Elizabeth treated by Major Martin Hume with regard to the political affairs of her reign. Another volume of a some- what similar kind has been " The Year after the Armada." English people may be pardoned if they never tire of that glorious period of our national history. Among other volumes of history the Kev. W. N. Hutton has issued an illustrated volume of the " Church of the Sixth Century," and Mr. H. D. Traill has reached the sixth volume of his "Social England." The Eev. William Urwick has published another volume of Nonconformist histories, the present being "Nonconformity m Worcester." The "History of Our Own Times, by Mr. Justin McCarthy, M.P., has been brought up to 1897, in another volume, and now forms a history of the sixty years of the Queen's reign.

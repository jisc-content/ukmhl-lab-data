"SUNLIGHT" YEAR-BOOK. 204 SUNLIGHT SOAP, jftne Brts* EVENTS OF 1896=7. The deaths of two Presidents of the Eoyal Academy—Lord Leighton and Sir John Millais—with the decease of such musicians as Sir Joseph Barnby and Brahms, and of such a portrait painter as George Eichmond, E.A., and such an artist and poet as William Morris, rank among the more prominent and the sadder events of the year. The Academy of 1897 was notice- able rather for the work of younger men than for that of Eoyal Academi- cians whose right it is to have their pictures hung in favourable places " on the line." Nevertheless there has been good work from Sir E. J. Poynter, the President, and many other distinguished members. There were a large number of portraits, both by professedly por- trait painters and by those who usually exercise their art in other directions. But, on the other hand, the year cannot be called, we fear, conspicuous for great imaginative Works—Mr. Dicksee, R.A., however, is represented by a great work that may be described as imaginative—it is "The Eise of Dawn." Eosy fingered stands the Dawn as a lovely girl; below roll the grey mists, and amid them the dark figure of Night, with sorrowful face, is seen descending and depart- ing before the rising light. It is a lovely picture, and one to remember in connection with the year 1897. Beautiful Scotch scenes from the brush of Mr. MacWhirter, E.A., give us views of the Waters of Glen Affanc—one up and the other down the glen. In a third canvas he takes us to Ehone Valley in early summer, and in yet a fourth— a weirdly imaginative picture, he illustrates a scene from Browning: Childe Eolaud, alone and armed, coming to the 6IH E.

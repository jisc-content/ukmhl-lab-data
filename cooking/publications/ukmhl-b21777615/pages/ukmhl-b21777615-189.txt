LITERATURE. Skeffington & Co. issued a volume of Original Sermons by Dean Farrar, Canon Hammond, the Eev. H. J. "Wilmot Buxton, the Eev. J. B. C. Murphy, Chaplain to the Forces, and the Key. Mr. Booker, of Dorking. Mr. Lecky's " Democracy and Liberty " has been considerably criticised, though it is un- deniably a great work ; while those who desire to begin the systematic study of philosophy will no doubt find Dr. Knight's ^ Introduction to Philosophy " interesting and valuable. Travel and Adventure. Volumes of travel and adventure have been abundant, and South African affairs have found representation in Mr. D. F. Dutort's " Ehodesia," published in the spring by Mr. Heinemann. Mr. Dutort is an Afrikander by birth, and "in full sympathy with the spirit of local development as opposed to Imperial control," but is nevertheless "a.strong advocate of Mr. Ehodes's policy in Ehodesia, since the Chartered Company was established." Dealing with another part of Africa was Slatin Pacha's "Fire and Sword in the Soudan," forming an important addi- tion to this class of literature, and almost rivalling Dr. Nansen's book on his Arctic Explorations and Travels. Concerning this book it may be stated that its pre- paration is said to have tried the dis- tinguished writer more severely than even the arctic dangers and travels about which he wrote. Honourable mention must also be made of Mrs. Ernest Hart's " Picturesque Burmah, Past and Present," which has been issued^ by Messrs. J. M. Dent & Co. It contains some 400 pages with over eighty reproductions of sketches and photographs and a couple of maps. Mrs. Hart is a lady traveller who journeyed the whole length of the land from Eangoon to Bhamo, "up and down the reaches of the noble Irrawaddy Eiver," and studied the lives, customs, manners, ideas and" characters of tne Burmese. They seem to be among the most genial and interesting people of the Orient. makes light work of a heavy wash. SLATIN rACHA.

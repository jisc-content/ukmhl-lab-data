The first practically successful steamboat, built by William Symington, of Wanlockhead Mines, for Lord Dundas. She was called the Charlotte Dundas, 1802. Eobert Fulton, after talking with Symington, placed the Clermont (133 ft. long) on American waters; it steamed 142 miles in thirty-two hours, 1807. The Elizabeth steam vessel on the Clyde (engines ten horse- power), 1813. George Dodd, who did very much for steamships, brings a steamer (14 or 16 horse-power) from the Clyde to the Thames by sea, 1813 or 1814. The Marjorie, built by William Denny, Of Dumbarton, steams from Grangemouth to the Thames in six days, 1815. Messrs. Maudslay, at Lambeth, build engines of 100 indi- ?ated horse-power for the Quebec, intended for Montreal and Quebec, 1817.

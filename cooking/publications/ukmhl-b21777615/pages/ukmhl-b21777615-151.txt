PROGRESS IN STEAMSHIPS. 149 Messrs. Cunard, Bums & Maclver founded the Cunard Steamship Company. The s.s. Britannia commences the ser- vice, 4th July, 1840, and attains a speed of about 8^ knots per hour. The Great Eastern, built at Millwall, and launched, 1854— 1859« , mu John Elder introduces the compound marine engine, ine economy in consumption of coal is most remarkable; con- sequently much less space needed for-coal, 1854—1856. The White Star liners Germanic and Britannic make a marked advance in speed across the Atlantic. Queenstown to New York in 7 days 10 hours 50 minutes, 1877. The Zucania, of the Cunard line, crosses the Atlantic west- ward to New York in 5 days 7 hours 23 minutes, 1896. The Canada, of the Dominion line, steams from Liverpool to Quebec, Canada, in 6 days 23 hours and 40 minutes, 1896. Large ocean-going vessels using steam at a pressure of 200 pounds to the square inch, 1897. The Oceanic, of the White Star Line, will be launched in January, 1898. Her speed will be over 23 knots, and she will be the biggest vessel of any kind, merchantman or war- ship, afloat. Various factors in the great developments in steamships are—the use of high pressure steam with compound, triple- expansion, and quadruple-expansion engines ; the use of steel' instead of iron, rendering the parts stronger and lighter ; the use of surface condensers, which quickly reduce the steam to hot water ready for the boiler; improvements in boilers,•■ including the water-tube boilers to raise steam quickly, con- tinuously, and at a high pressure. To these may be added' improvements in the shape of the vessel, enabling her to cut' through the water quickly. 27 Gold Medals and other Awards. S.S. "CAMPANIA."

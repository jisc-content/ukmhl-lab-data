MUSIC. 209 Wagner's wonderful and niuch-debated music seems in- creasing in vogue, and a performance of " Tristan and Isolde," arranged for by the late Sir Augustus Harris—j though he did not live to witness it—was perhaps the best yet given in England of this work. Among the principal singers were Madame Albani and Jean de Eeszke : the rendering of Tristan by the famous Polish tenor being of very great ex- cellence. Personalia.—Dr. J. F. Bridge, organist of Westminster Abbey and Gresham Professor, has been ap- pointed to fill the vacancy of con- ductor of the Eoyal Choral Society, left by Sir A. 0. Mackenzie. Mr. W. H. Cummings has been appointed Principal of the Guildhall School of Music. Mr. Maurice Grau has been appointed director at the Coven t Garden Opera House. Mr. Leonard Borwick has well maintained his position as one of the first of English pianists, and at a large "Irish Night" concert at the Albert Hall on March 17th, 1897 given by Mr. William Carter's choir, and a selection of solo^ singers, a little girl of fourteen, one of Mr. Carter's pupils, made an excellent appearance as a soprano vocalist. Mr. Enghen d'Albert, the pianist, has made his reappearance in England after fourteen years' absence. Among deaths we have to chronicle Sir Joseph Barnby (who was knighted August, 1893), January 28th, 1896, aged 58; Henry E. Abbey, October 16th, 1896 ; Ambrose Thomas, author of "Mignon," February 12th, 1896, aged 85; Sir Augustus Harris, June 22nd, 1896, aged 44; Henry D.

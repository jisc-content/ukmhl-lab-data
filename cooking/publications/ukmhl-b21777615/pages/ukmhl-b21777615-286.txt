Barley, also barley meal and mashed potatoes may be given when they leave the nest; but water and food may be kept near the nest. The fact is, a sitting hen should have as much food as she can eat; but to be fed continually on the nest tends to cripple hens. The bird should not stay away more than half an hour at the longest, and when likely to remain away too long should be driven gently back, but not be caught. If necessary to remove the hen from the nest she should be carefully lifted off, by holding her under her wings. Thus, should she be sitting in the fowl-house, she can be removed, and fed, and then shut in again, without annoyance from the other fowls. About twenty-one days after the eggs were placed under the hen, the chickens should begin to break the shells. Ihe time may be a few hours earlier if the eggs were very fresh; and a few hours later if the eggs were stale.

The hole in the shell may be enlarged with a Icissor's point, but the utmost delicacy is necessary The chicks willnot require food for about twenty-four hours after hatching.

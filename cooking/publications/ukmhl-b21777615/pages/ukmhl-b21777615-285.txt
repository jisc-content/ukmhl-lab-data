THE KEEPING OF POULTRY, 283 says another authority, " is, that it is admitted that the hen that steals a nest in a hedge generally hatches all her eggs, and brings home strong chickens; whereas the one that sits at home in a dry box or basket often spoils many of her eggs, and her chickens are frequently weakly, which we attribute to the great evaporation that takes place from the egg during incubation in such unnaturally dry nests, which DOEKING. also renders the chicken feverish and weakly." If the season is very dry the eggs may be sprinkled with tepid water when the hen is off the nest. The nest should not be very deep and should be only so large that the bird can just fill it Further, the inside should be as nearly flat as possible so that the eggs may not lean or knock together. ftp?re?PÂ«im? 76 1th6 nest once a da?' t0 feed* t0 8tretch gieirlegaajittte, to have their dust bath, and to maintain ^NLIGH^SOA^a friend in need.

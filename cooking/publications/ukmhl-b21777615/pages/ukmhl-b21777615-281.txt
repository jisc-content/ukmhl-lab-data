THE KEEPING OF POULTRY, the Langshans especially make good table birds. Hamburga are splendid layers, but like a good run. Pure Dorkings are fine table birds, and altogether form a fine breed of fowls. They do not lay well in the winter, however, and the chickens are delicate. One great secret, morever, of success in small runs is to keep young birds only—not later than their third year, and perhaps, indeed, only one year after they begin to lay. Creve-Cceurs yield large, well-fleshed chickens, giving a good quantity of meat, white in colour. Cochixs. Another secret is not to keep too many birds for the space —about 16 square feet of floor in the house to every six fowls, being about the necessary dimensions ; and yet another point is to supply the birds regularly with those things which they would obtain for themselves if permitted a free run.

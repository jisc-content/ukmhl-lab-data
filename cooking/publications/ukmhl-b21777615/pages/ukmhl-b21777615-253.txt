COMMERCIAL, 251 for the sake of effectiveness. month alone, February, 1897, there were 77, involving 24,231 workpeople, and in March, 96 new ones, iavolving 29,582 workpeople. These figures may be compared with 95 strikes, involving about 22,000 workpeople, which took place in March, 1896. The great strikes are well reported in the leading newspapers all over the country, and attract universal attention; but there appear to be nearly always several smaller disputes, of varying magnitude, proceeding in different industries, and ending with varying success. Particulars of the results of some of these strikes may be interesting and instructive. Thus in one month, that of March, 1897, no fewer than 96 old and new disputes were settled, involving 18,375 workpeople. Thirty-two of these disputes, involving 4,036 individuals, were successful from the workpeople's point of view; 36, involving 6,631 indivi* duals, were unsuccessful; and 28, involving 7,708 individuals, ended in a compromise. It is calculated that 470,000 working days were lost in March, 220,000 in February, and 310,000 in January, owing to new and old labour disputes, or 1,000,000 working days for the first quarter of the year 1897, giving, as an estimated average for the whole year, and bearing in mind that the returns are not all before us, 4,000,000 working days lost, owing to labour disputes. The disputes occurred in a number of various industries^ including the building trades, mining and quarrying, textile, clothing, dock labour, tin-plate, iron and steel manufacture, engineering and shipbuilding trades, coal mining, &c. The causes were very various, some of the disputes being for advance of wages, and some against the employment of non- unionists, &c. Such frequent disputes and losses give great importance to all attempts at conciliation and arbitration, and a number of cases have been settled, and agreements made by the operation of such boards. To give a few interesting and instructive instances:â€” A protracted strike of spinners took place at Slaithwaite, lasting from June, 1896, to March, 1897. The workers were employed by the Slaithwaite Spinning Company, and the strike involved some 75 spinners, and threw out of work a number of other hands. It was caused by the directors refusing to pay for certain " extras "; the directors also declined to deal with

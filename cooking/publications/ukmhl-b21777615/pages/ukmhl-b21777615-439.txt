Maintains the Body in Health. Twyford, Berks. March 31st, 1896. Dear Sirs,—"We cannot overrate the value of cleanli- ness of person, that is, of clothes and body. The bath, whether it be the daily cold tub, the evening warm bath, or the weekly Turkish, does far more than most people would believe. To avert sickness and maintain the body in health, such a soap as Lifebuoy Soap is beyond praise, its softness and purity must commend it to all. Dr. Gordon Stables, E.N. A Nurse's Opinion. 5, Patshull Eoad, Kentish Town, N.W. Dear Sirs,—I think it right that you should know I used your Lifebuoy Eoyal Disinfectant Soap for patients' clothing and rooms, extensively throughout the late epidemic. I never travel without it, and have found it invaluable. The more I use it the better pleased I am. L. Pollard, Late Nurse of theE.H.S. and other Hospitals. Valuable for Horsekeepers. Brownhills Collieries, Near Walsall. Jan. 15th, 1895. Gentiemen,—I have great pleasure to inform you 1 have used your Lifebuoy Eoyal Disinfectant Soap upon several ponies suffering from mange and other Bkm diseases, with marvellous results. No stud or stable should be without Lifebuoy Soap. ■ Yours faithfully, J. 0. Linnell (Horsekeeper). [We may mention that Mr. Linnell had 200 horses under his care, and used Lifebuoy Soap on fifteen of them for mange and skin diseases, with, as he savs, "marvellous results."—Ed.] SUNLIGHT SOAP will make it so.

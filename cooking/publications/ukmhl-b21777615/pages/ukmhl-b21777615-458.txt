"SUNLIGHT" YEAR-BOOK. 455 SUNLIGHT SOAP, Gold Medal, Paris, 1889. There was a rustle somewhere, the vague sound of a foot striking a stone and then there fell silence upon that old Christian churchâ€”a stagnant, heavy silence which closed round Kennedy and shut him in like water round a drowning man. * * # # *. Some two months afterwards the following paragraph made the round of the European Press. "One of the most interesting discoveries of recent years is that of the new catacomb in Eome, which lies some distance to the east of the well-known vaults of St. Calixtus. The finding of this important burial-place, which is exceedingly rich in most interesting early Christian remains, is due to the energy and sagacity of Dr. Julius Burger, the young German specialist, who is rapidly taking the first place as an authority upon ancient Eome. Although the first to publish his discovery, it appears that a less fortunate adventurer had anticipated Dr. Burger. Some months ago Mr. Kennedy, the well-known English student, disappeared suddenly from his rooms in the Corso, and it was conjectured that his association with a recent scandal had driven him to leave Eome. It appears now that he had in reality fallen a victim to that fervid love of archaeology which had raised him to a distinguished place among living scholars. His body was discovered in the heart of the new catacomb, and it was evident from the condition of his feet and boots that he had tramped for days through the tortuous corridors which make these sub- terranean tombs so dangerous to explorers. The deceased gentleman had, with inexplicable rashness, made his way into this labyrinth without, as far as can be discovered, taking with him either candles or matches, so that his sad fate was the natural result of his own temerity. What makes the matter more painful is that Dr. Julius Burger was an intimate friend of the deceased. His joy at the extraordinary find which he has been so fortunate as to make has been greatly marred by the terrible fate of hUs comrade and fellow-worker."

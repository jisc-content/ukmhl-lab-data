SPORTS AND PASTIMES. 405 SUNLIGHT SOAP, Gold Medal, Kimberley, 1892. CRICKET.—The 1896 season was again ore of particular interest, both by reason of the visit of another Australian team (the ninth) and on account of the splendid struggle for county championship honours. Although the Australians lost two out of the three international games, the team was, without doubt, the most successful that ever visited us, as is proved by the record of the tour, which reads— 34 matches played, 19 won, 6 lost, 9 drawn. The three international matches were of a most interesting nature. The first, the Australians (who made 53, and 347) lost by 6 wickets. In the second they scored a first innings of 412 against 231 by England. Then in England's second innings, K. S. Eanjitsinhji came to the rescue with a splendid innings of 154. Ultimately the visitors were left to get 125 to win, but bo well did Eichardson bowl, that 7 wickets were lost before fhey accomplished the task. England's first innings in the deciding match realised only 145; but although the first Australian wicket put on 75 runs, the whole side was out for 119— 26 runs behind. Then England went in—and out—for 84, leaving the Australians 111 to get. But Peel and Hearne rose to the occasion, and an exciting match ended in a victory for England by 66 runs. The honours of the year, as regards batting, were Garried off by K S. Eanjitsinhji, whose total of 2,780 runs is the highest ever obtained in one season, W. G. Grace coming next with 2,739, made in 1871. J. T. Hearne and Eichardson were equally distinguished as bowlers. Principal Amateur and Professional Averages, 1896. Batting Eanjitsinhji, K.

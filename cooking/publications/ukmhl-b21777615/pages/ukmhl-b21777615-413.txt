Bidlake, Herne Hill, July 22, 1893. _ FOOTBALL.—Again the past season has been marked by a further increase in the popularity of the game. How greatly this has now extended may be judged from the fact that the-Association Cup Final Tie attracted no fewer than 65,000 spectators—easily beating all previous records for attendances at athletic meetings of any kind. Association.—The above-mentioned tie, which was decided at the Crystal Palace on April 10th, 1897, practically finished the season. The teams left in were Aston Villa and Everton, the former of which, after an exciting and well-contested game throughout, succeeded in winning by 3 goals to 2.

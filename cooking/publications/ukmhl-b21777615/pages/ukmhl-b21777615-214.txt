MY WAY OF USING THE SUN- LIGHT SOAP. " Being compelled to do my own washing, and being in delicate health, it was simply 1 killing me' hy the old method and with ordinary laundry soap. By using the SUNLIGHT SOAP in the following way I get my clothes beautifully white and clean, and without tiring myself in the least. First, then, I dip one of the gar- ments in the tub of water, draw it out on the Wash- board, and rub the soap over it lightly, being particular to soap all the soiled places. I then roll it in a tight roll, just as a piece is rolled after it is sprinkled for iron- ing and lay it in the bottom of the tub, under the water, and go on until all the pieces have the soap rubbed on them and are rolled up. I then go away —from thirty minutes to an hour—and pay my atten- tion to some light employment about the house, letting the SUNLIGHT SOAP do its work. After soaking this way I wash them out lightly on the wash-board, and the dirt appears to drop right Out. I do not scald or boil a single piece. If a streak is hard to wash I rub some more soap on it and throw back into the suds a few minutes. I rinse in lukewarm water, rubbing the gar- ment lightly over the wash-board through the rinse water to get the dirty suds out. I then blue—using very little, as this soap whitens the clothes—and hang out. Coloured goods.nannels,woollens, etc., I treat m the same way, but they need not soak so long, and I.make(the last rinse water a trifle soapy. Cashmeres,woollens, flannels, and mousselines tie lames, are rendered soft and smooth by the use of this soap. Soaping the clothes and rolling them up is so easily done that the method is.well worth trying. White flannels can be washed with the °%eON%UB HAED, or the dirt will be ruttedk EUB LIGHTLY, and the DIET WILL DEOP OUT. If you wish your linen to be as white as snow,

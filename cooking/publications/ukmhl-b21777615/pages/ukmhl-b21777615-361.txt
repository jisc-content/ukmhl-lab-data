FASHIONS. 359 Fig. 5.- there is still a tendency to place the highest, or main trimming, on one side—the left. A pretty high-crown hat has some light trimming, say goffered chiffon, or lace, ot mousseline de soie on either side, a couple of ostrich feathers on the left, two or three flowers on the right, and a light ribbon or bow in front (Fig. 5). This hat is also much simpler than some of the gorgeously beflowered structures which have been in vogue. As for the material for hats,, coloured straws seem to have super- seded the felt " Plateau " of a few seasons since. The "Plateau," it may be remembered, was nipped up in the centre, a process which caused it to undulate round the edge, while underneath was a velvet under-brim or bandeau; now "plateaus" in coloured straw have come in, and they are usually made up over an under-brim of black lace or chiffon, with ostrich tips as the top trimming. A simple but elegant Parisian hat is thus described: the shape is, somewhat like that of the centenarian "box" or "top" hat, with the two; sides waving upward and the top of the crown a little longer than the lower part. The material is of finely but plainly plaited straw, green in' colour, and the edge binding and, three bands round the somewhat} high crown are of a darker shade of green velvet, while three ostrich tips of feathers of the same tint rise from^ the left side. Here again we see Fig. 6. A Pretty Toque, that the highest trimming is on one «n™n^*i j , ,eide of tlle nat> instead of being' equally balanced on both sides. -A High-Cbows Hat for the sake of convenience.

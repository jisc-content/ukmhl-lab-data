Gallaher second. On August 15th the Long Distance Championship was held at Southport, the course being between five and six miles in length.

But at Walsall, on September 2nd, Tyers and Derbyshire were found in their usual positions in the Five Hundred Yards Championship, which Tyers secured in 6 min. 554 sec. On March l7*^1!?7; atWooUoomooIoo Bay (N.S.W.), P. Cavill won the New South Wales Half Mile Championship in 12 min. 45* sec, the fastest amateur time on record. As it is probable at the time of writing that he will oppose Tyers for the championships, there is every likelihood of the 1897 season being distinguished by some notable performances m the way of record-breaking.

TURF.—As the hero of the 1895 season was Lord Rosebery, who with Sir Visto secured his second successive Derby, so was the follow- ing undoubtedly the Prince of Wales' year. But the Prince far eclipsed the Premier: for not only did Persimmon capture both the Dekby and the St. Legeb, but the One Thousand Guineas fell to H.R.H. filly Thais, who just missed securing the Oaks as well, in Which race, though she started a hot favourite, she could only finish second to Lord Derby's Canterbury Pilgrim.

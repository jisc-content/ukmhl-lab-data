SUNLIGHT SOAP, Gold Medal, Lyons, 1894. It Simply Does Wonders. Llanrwst, North Wales. Gentlemen-,—I feel I must write and tell you how de- lighted I am with SUNLIGHT SOAP. It simply does wonders. For washing flannels and silks I find it par- ticularly good, and coloured articles look like new after being washed with it. I have also used it as a Toilet Soap and find it very good. It also greatly minimises labour; in fact, it is an excellent soap, and I have much pleasure in recommending it to all my friends. Yours very truly, R. A. Praise Where Praise is Due. Wingham, Kent, Dec. 9th, 1896. Dear Sirs, — Just a line to speak of your excellent soap. I have used it for the last five years, and find it the best and cheapest soap you can get. I take in washing, and can do more in two days by using SUNLIGHT SOAP than some can do in a week. I give praise where praise is due. I am, Yours respectfully, Mrs. An/sell. For Washing Surplices. Wingham Vicarage, Dover. Jan. 4th, 1892. Dear Sirs,—Just before our late Church Festival, I found the surplices of our choir unwashed. In my anxiety that they should be got ready, I spoke to our churchwarden, and he said : " It is too late, they cannot be washed now." Then I went to the laundress, and she told me the same thing—that there was not time to prepare the surplices before they would be wanted—and then I said to her, " Don't worry. Happy thought, use SUNLIGHT SOAP," and I am glad to inform you that my suggestion was successful, and the result very satisfactory. All the surplices were made perfectly white and clean, and the bright appearance of the choir was a pleasing feature of our festival services. I remain, Yours faithfully, J. M. Fox.

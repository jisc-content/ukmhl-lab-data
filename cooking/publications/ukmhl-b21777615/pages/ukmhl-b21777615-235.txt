SUNLIGHT SOAP, Gold Medal, Paris, 1889. The Secret of Health. By a Diplomee op a London Hospital. . " An Englishman's House is his Castle," is the Englishman's boast, and he believes that he is as secure nowadays within the four brick walls of his cottage as his ancestors were behind their moats, and dykes, and drawbridges. What will he Bay, then, to hear that such a belief is but a miserable delusion, and that so far from being as safe a3 a castle, his house can be entered at any moment by an intruder who waits neither for leave, welcome, nor permission to stay : an intruder who can disable his body, waste his time, take his work from him, rob him of the savings of years, and can even take from him for ever the treasures that are still dearer to him than any money, while he is forced to stand by power- less ? How can any house accessible to so terrible a presence be compared to a castle ? There may be people who will deny that any intruder exists who can thus devastate our homes against our will. Alas ! Truth is stranger than fiction. This picture of the enemy who lurks within the shadow of our homeB, and whose course is marked with woe, is drawn in colours all too faint, this enemy's name is INFECTION. In view, then, of the fact that this unseen and terrible foe is always waiting to force an entrance within our doors, can any- thing be more important to learn than how this foe may be kept out? r Science teaches us that there are a number of diseases which ought not to exist at all, and which will not exist when we take the trouble to learn how their propagation can be prevented. LOSS OF WORK. How many houses have been broken up, how many women and children have been driven into the workhouse by this cause, who can calculate ? To what extent our present death and disease rates are capable of being lowered we oan judge best by looking for a moment at the statistics of the prisons of our country.

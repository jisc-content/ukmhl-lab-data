PUBLIC OPINION ON SUNLIGHT SOAP. SUNLIGHT SOAP, Gold Medal, Ghent, 1889, A Perfect Boon in the Household. Trinity School House, Brompton, Chatham. Dear Sirs,—I feel I must write to you to express the pleasure and satisfaction I have found from the use of your SUNLIGHT SOAP. I have been for some weeks without a servant, and having to do a great deal of the housework myself, I can personally bear testimony to the value of your soap. I consider it to be the best in the market, not only for washing clothes, but for clean- ing purposes and removing grease; it makes a lather more rapidly than any other soap I have ever used. I shall recommend it to all my friends, and do all I can to inorease the sale of it, as I consider it a perfect boon in the household. I am, Yours truly, Ellen "Wainwright. For Washing Everything. " Braeside," Eastern Eoad, Eortis Green, N. Gentlemen—We use SUNLIGHT SOAP for every- thing—house cleaning, washing of linen, carpets, silver, silk and woollen dresses, and kid gloves—and find it superior to any other soap for these as well as for the toilet. Yours truly, M. Ellis-Good. No Rough Hands. Eadley Hall, Southwell. Gentlemen,—I have much pleasure in stating that I have used SUNLIGHT SOAP for the last seven years, and although I have tried many other kinds, I find none to equal yours. After washing, the clothes are a splen- did colour and could not be whiter. To show its good qualities, there are no rough hands after using it. 1 find it invaluable, and would not on any account be without it. Believe me, Yours truly, M. Iinley.

THE REARING OF CATTLE. SUNLIGHT SOAP, Gold Medal, Jamaiea, 1891.La given milk in the middle of the day, for seven or ten days after being turned into a grass field. As to the age of selling cattle for food, Shorthorn steers fetch good prices between two and three years of age, while it is questionable if double as much is realised for those from four to five years of age. When a cow has had three, or may be five, calves, she may be milked until the yield begins to decrease. If well fed it will be found that she becomes more fleshy as the milk diminishes, and if three on four pounds of oil-cake be added to the ordinary food daily she should soon come into excellent con- dition and perhaps fetch, for butcher's meat, a thoroughly remunerative price—though, as everyone knows, market prices vary. A cow, in short, should not be kept for profit after the age of eight or nine years. Much depends on management of Leiceste^ Ewe.

Concerning feeding, straw of all kinds may perhaps be used much more than it has been—pea straw being probably the most nutritious. Straw and sliced turnips, as much as they can eat, form good winter food for stock. Feeding milch cows for milk varies very much in different places. Such cows go to grass in the summer, and have hay and mangold in the winter. A good cow so fed should yield, it is eaid, from 500 to 550 gallons of milk per annum. Distillers and brewers' grains are often given in towns, and pea meal mixed with the grains. Pea meal may be given to cows losing their milk. Speaking generally, roots form a large portion of the food given to cows in winter and spring, and it is said that a little crushed oats, or beans, or oil-cake will neutralize the taste of butter from turnip feeding. Cows should always have plenty of clean water.

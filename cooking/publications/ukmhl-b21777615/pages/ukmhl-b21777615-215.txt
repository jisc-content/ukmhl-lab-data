HOW TO WASH AND PRESERVE FLANNELS. By LOUISA E. SMITH, Authoress of " Home Washing1," and Instruc- tress at the Forsyth Technical College. It is necessary, before commencing to wash flannels, to prepare a jelly of SUNLIGHT SOAP, as soap must not be rubbed on these articles. Cut up a tablet of SUNLIGHT SOAP, put the pieces into a stewpan with a quart of water, let them simmer for half an hour, or remain in the oven all night. When cold it should resemble a strong jelly. The properties of SUNLIGHT SOAP help to soften the water, so that it washes much more easily than any other kind. Have ready two pans of hot water (but not sufficiently hot to be uncomfortable to the hands, say 90 deg., Eahr.). In one pan dissolve as much soap jelly as will make a good lather, take each flannel singly and immerse it in the lather, wash it all over quickly, giving the collar and cuffs an extra rub. Well rinse in the second pan of hot water as quickly as pos- sible and put it through a wringer twice. If no machine is available, wring and roll tightly in a dust sheet; take out and shake well, stretching the neck and wrist- bands while drying. One tablet of SUNLIGHT SOAP will clean a dozen flannels; if new they will take double the quantity. When washing bright coloured flannels great care must be taken. Wash them m the manner described for white or grey, but to each gallon of water add a wineglass of common vinegar; this will preserve the colour till worn out When nearly dry press carefully with a hot iron I nave washed flannels that have been in wear for three years by this process, and have found it both satisfac- tory and economical. SUNLIGHT SOAP will make it so.

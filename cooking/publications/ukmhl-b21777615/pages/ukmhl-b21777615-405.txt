Four out of the five holders did not defend their titles, and the display was generally considered a poor one. Eesults :—Bantam weights—C. T. Lamb. Feather weights—N. F. Smith. Light weights—A. Vanderhout (holder). Middle weights—W. Dees. Heavy weights—" B. Haverdale " (G. L. Townsend). BILLIARDS.—Comparatively little of interest has taken place during the past season. John Roberts is still able to give any other player starts from 7,000 to 9,000 in a 24,000 spot-barred game, while the chance of his meeting Peall in an all-in match seems as remote as ever. At the end of February and the beginning of Apiil last, Roberta attempted to give the latter player the enormous start of 12,000 out of 24,000, but failed on each occasion, scoring 23,690 and 23.370 respec- tively. Both games, which were in? £500 a side, were, however, great successes, the progress of them being watched by large audiencea.

PEEFACB The Sunlight Year Book enters upon its fourth year of publication with this issue. The aim of the publishers in every past succeeding year has been that the issue for each coming year should excel its predecessor in its treasures of informa- tion on the most interesting subjects of every-day life for everybody. Stimulated by many kind and complimentary letters the 1897 issue received, the publishers have spared neither time nor expense in the writing and compiling of the 189S edition in order that the information printed within its page* will be as practicable and useful as possible. New subject,; have been introduced, including Universal History, Geography, Architecture, and Commerce, whilst Literature, Fine Arts, Science, Agriculture, Sports, Pastimes, Medicine, and matters pertaining to the Household are dealt with in a concise, clear, and crisp manner. Naturally, some subjects in a Tear Booh of this description interest one sex more than another ; but all will, we think, read with interest and pleasure the romance by Conan Doyle, the well-known author and novelist, which has been specially written for the proprietors. "We trust that our labour will prove of pleasure and ser- vice to all, and make the Sunlight Year Book for 1898 welcomed and valued in every household.

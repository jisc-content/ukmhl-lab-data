The Star of South Africa, or the Dudley diamond (the property of the Countess of Dudley) is, however, of stainless purity. After cutting, it weighs 46£ carats, value about £20,000. The celebrated Porter Ehodes diamond is a "blue-white" weighing 150 carats, and valued at £60,000. In 1888 a yellowish stone was found as big as a hen's egg, weighing 428£ carats; but in 1895 a still larger diamond was reported from the Transvaal, valued at £634,000 and weighing 634 carats. The Star of the South diamond, found in a river in Minas Geraes, Brazil, by a negress in 1853, weighed 254£ carats. When cut its weight was 125 carats, and it was sold to the Gaekwar of Baroda for £80,000. Diamonds should be colourless, but should yield brilliant flashes of light. Chemically they are carbon. M.

Sanci (or Sancy) about 1570, at Constantinople, and after being held by one or two Kings of France, was bought by Queen Elizabeth of England; it was sold by James II. to Louis XIV. of France, and passed into the possession of the Demidoff family of Russia, who gave, it is said, £80,000 for it, and sold it to an Indian Prince. RANGE OF VISION AT DIFFERENT HEIGHT5. Distances You Can See. Were the earth flat and there were no obstructions, the • range of vision would be much larger than now; but the rotundity of the earth considerably limits the distance of sight. Thus, a man on the sea, with his eyes, say, six feet above the water level, would only be able to see a distance of some 3 J miles, because of the sloping away of the earth's rotundity. For this reason, also, great heights appear low at a distance, until, as we say, they sink below the horizon. At 10 ft. high a per3on may be able to see nearly H miles before the slope of the earth prevents him from seeing further. At 20 ft. high, nearly 6 miles. At 25 ft. high, nearly 6f miles. At 40 ft. high, something over 8J miles-. At 100 ft. high, nearly 13£ miles. At 200 ft. high, nearly 18J miles. At 500 ft. high, something over 29£ miles. At 1,000 ft. nearly 42 miles. At 5,000 ft., 93£ miles. It will be seen that the range of vision does not increase in proportion the higher you ascend, but becomes slightly less each foot you rise. Thus the distance you can see at 10 ft. high is about 4J miles, but at 20 ft. high it is barely six miles. SUNLIGHT SOAP does its work

B. Walker's Ailsa. The latter out of 49 raceB won 13 first and 11 second prizes, of a total value of £1,045. The Meteor started 22 times, winning 13 first and 4 seconds, the value of which totalled £1,480, while the Britannia won £1,022 worth of prizes (11 firsts and 4 seconds) in 45 races. Unfortunately a • sad accident Bpoilt the success of the season, the Meteor accidentally running down the Isolde, the owner of which, Baron voa Zedtwitz, was killed through the collision. Strangely enough, another Isolde, the pro- perty of Mr. P. Donaldson, was the most successful among the second- class yachta, winning 35 prizes, the value of which amounted to £1,025. Then came Mr. F. W. L. Popham's Corsair, 14 prizes, value £480. The 1897 season was opeaed by both Britannia and Ailsa in fina style. Each scored several wins and there seemed but little to choose between them.

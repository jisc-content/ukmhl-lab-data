459 PORT SUNLIGHT. SUNLIGHT SOAP, Gold Mai, Ottawa, S893. turns out Sunlight Soap wrappers at the rate of 80,000 wrappers per hour. Leaving this great room, we pass to the Laboratory. Here we find a number of scientific-looking gentlemen, View in Port Sunlight Village. surrounded with retorts, bottles, cru- cibles, and all the expert's paraphernalia for the great business of "testing."' Here samples from every vat of all the soaps manufactured by the Company are tested three timesy once during boiling, once after boiling, and again after being cooled. And here the glycerine manufactured by Messrs. Lever Brothers, Limited, is also tested, and sent out so pure that it will stand all the various tests insti- tuted by the British Pharmacopoeia for ascertaining tho purity of glycerine. Passing from the Laboratories, we . come to the Card Box-making Eooms, where hundreds of thoiisands of the special compact boxes, with which we are all familiar when they are filled with their three stout double tablets of Sunlight or Lifebuoy Soap, are turned out with the most marvellous speed and precision by a crowd of cheerful girls. The great workshop where this branch of the work iff carried on has a special feature of interest, which is seen in the Soap Stamping Department also. It is a sort of little tramway track on which run broad bands between the rows of machines at which the girls stand making the boxes.

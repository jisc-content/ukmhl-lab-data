"SUNLIGHT" YEAR-BOOK. 224 When SUNLIGHT SOAP is used known as Chiromancy, and in some form or other appears to be, very ancient, while a great number of complicated directions have been laid down by both ancient and modern authorities to enable the student to practise it correctly. Modern English works are largely based on two French writers, D'Arpentigny and Desbarrolles: While it is quite possible that the form and features of the hand may yield indications as to character and temperament, we need hardly warn our readers against placing implicit confidence in the foretelling of events from the hand. The fingers are named (beginning at .the forefinger):â€” Jupiter, Saturn, Apollo, and Mercury. The fleshy pads at the base of each are termed "Mounts," and are named after the fingers below which they occur. The "ball" (or third phalange of the thumb) is called the Mount of Yenus. In the centre of the palm is the plain or triangle of Mars. Below the Mount of Mercury is the Mount of Mars ; extending from the last mount / /s^ up to the wrist is the &A Mount of Luna, or the Moon. 1. ..The upper %n\ phalange of the thumb indicates will and de- cision of character. 2. The second phalange of the thumb indicates logical power. 3. "Mount" of Yenus indicates love, melody, passion. 4. Jupiter, the joint at the base of the finger is called Mount of Jupiter, denoting ambition and pride. 5. Apollo, the joint at the base of the finger is called Mount of Apollo, and indicates riches or art.

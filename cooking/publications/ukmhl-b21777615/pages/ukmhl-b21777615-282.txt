Other points to be noted are : Hatch out chickens early, and also arrange hatchings so that pullets will come on to lay at Christmas-time when eggs are perhaps most valuable. The House should be as spacious as possible, warm and dry, yet well-ventilated. Warmth is an important factor in causing hens to lay eggs. Cold and wet are most pernicious to them. The house should be sheltered from the north and east and if possible face the south. It should also be fre- quently cleaned ; the droppings of poultry make good manure. An inner door of wire netting may be made so that during the day the boarded door may be open and light and air and sunshine admitted to the house. The roosting perches should not be placed too high. Particular attention must be paid to the roof to see that it is watertight and the floor dry. The Run should also be kept scrupulously clean, and with this purpose, should be frequently dug oyer and the surface soil sometimes renewed. Part of it may be covered so that the fowls have a shelter in case of rain. Under the shelter also mav be placed their sand or dust bath, and a few heaps of ashes or coarse sand in which they dust themselves and so cleanse their skin and feathers.

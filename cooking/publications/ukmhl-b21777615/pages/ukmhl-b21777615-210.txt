208 "SUNLIGHT" YEAR-BOOK. Jubilee Year. The deaths of Sir Augustus Harris and Mr. Henry E. Abbey, as impressarios, had, no doubt, a depressing effect, but not permanently so. The demand for light and bright sparkling operatic music or musical plays—as witness the long run of " The Geisha " at Daly's—has been a very marked feature, and the demand has been amply supplied by a great variety of pieces. There have been, for instance, the successful production of "His Majesty" at the Savoy, by F. C. Burnand and R. C. Lehmann, with music by A. C. Mackenzie; "The Yashmak, a Story of the East," at the Shaftesbury; "La Poupee" at the Prince of Wales's; " Shamus O'Brien," at the Opera Comique; and others. Songs from such musical plays have been very popular. The Jubilee of the first perform- ance of Mendelssohn's "Elijah" having occurred in 1896, that much-admired work has been rendered by choral associations almost everywhere, and its pop- ularity seems if possible to stand higher than ever. The famous London choirs—the "Eoyal" at the Albert Hall, and the " Queen's Hall" at that spacious and elegant rival to the Albert Hall, and the Philharmonic Society at Queen's Hall, have given familiar com- jean de beszke. positions with continued success; while the Bach Choir produced at the Queen's Hall Burneau's new "Requiem," and the Handel Society gave Handel's " Horcules " at the People's Palace, where the great master's "Messiah" draws enormous crowds. The 174th gathering of the Three Choirs at Worcester has been held, and Sheffield has commenced a Musical Festival, where high- class works have been performed. Norwich Festival has presented a novelty in Signor Luigi Mancinelli's " Hero and Leander" and Professor Stanford's new Irish ballad, " Phaudrig Crohore," one of Sheridan Le Fanu's poems. Bristol Musical Festival was also very successful. Search North, South, East or West,

" MiRA.KDA.~Try a few drops of warm Glycerine in your ear; be most careful that it is not too warm, and be sure that it is of good quality. You can rely upon the quality of LEVER'S GLYCERINE." There are a few uses for Glycerine, other than medical, which it is well for all household managers to know :— TO PREVENT FROSTY AND STEAMY WIN- DOWS.—Clean the windows thoroughly, and apply LEVER'S GLYCERINE all over the surface; polish this lightly with a dry cloth until quite dry. Don't rub hard, but lightly, so that the Glycerine is rubbed in. The windows will then keep clean for weeks without getting frosty or steamy. This knowledge will be most valuable, as it is advisable that windows should be bright if goods are to be shown to best advantage. By not requiring cleaning too frequently, this method will also prove a great boon to householders in winter, as it is well known that glass frequently cracks if cleaned in a hard frost. TO PRESERVE EGGS NEW LAID FOR MONTHS.—Smear the shells the same day as the eggs are laid, with LEVELS GLYCERINE. They will be milky and as fresh as if just laid at the end of many weeks. They need not be packed in any special way, but kept as most convenient, but it is best to keep the smaU end up. LEVER'S GLYCERINE answers much better than butter or grease for this purpose, as it will never turn rancid as these do, and thereby spoil the flavour of the egg. It is most important to use LEVER'S GLYCERINE for this purpose as it is guaranteed to be absolutely pure. FOR SWEETENING PURPOSES—LEVER'S GLYCERINE may be used to sweeten tea, coffee, etc., when sugar disagrees. It has just the opposite tendency of sugar—it prevents acidity and fermentation instead of increasing it. A friend in need is a friend indeed—

368 "SUNLIGHT" YEARBOOK, flfcebtcal THE HOUSEHOLD DOCTOR. Abscess. -This painful sore shows a poor state of health and is caused "by an accu- mulation of bad matte r, or " pus," in the blood; the "pus" gathers t o t h e r surface, where a swelling occurs some- what conical in shape and at length the skin breaks and the bad matter escapes. The abscess may thus be regarded as an effort of nature to rid the system of the bad matter in the blood, but this effort is attended with' great pain to the patient. Belief is obtained by opening the abscess—when sufficiently large and matured—by a lancet—an operation which should be performed by a doctor. Fomentations of hot flannels wrung out of boiling water may be applied to accelerate the. growth. Linseed poultices may also be applied for this purpose, and about ten minutes before the poultice is used the abscess should be smeared over with a mixture of equal parts of Lever s glycerine and extract of belladonna. If the abscess be slow and not very , SUNLIGHT SOAP is used everywhere

economical soap. It is a pure make, too, therefore can be used for every part of household work, and is an excel- lent soap for laundry purposes, and especially to be recommended for washing dresses, cambric blouses, | curtains, &c, as it loosens the dirt, and does away to an I extent with rubbing; thus the clothes wear longer, and 1 they always assume a good colour, and smell so sweet and fresh."—From Weldon's Journal of Costumes for July, 1895. For Washing Flannels and Woollen Materials. " Shred as thinly as possible a tablet of SUN = / LIGHT SOAP into a tub; pour over this a gallon \ of boiling (not hot, but boiling) water; stir up I well with a stick or bunch of twigs until it is in I a foaming lather, and let it cool until the elbow can quite comfortably be borne in it. Shake the flannel- \ well to free from dust, and then put them into a tub and souse and work them well. The dirt will come out as if by magic; then rinse very thoroughly in two or even three relays of warm water; -squeeze out the water, but do not twist the flannel—this breaks the fibre (a wringer expresses the water thoroughly and is a great saver of trouble and wear and tear); then hang up to dry, not near the fire or in a very hot sun. Iron on the wrong side with a thin cotton between the flannel and the iron. Eemember the importance of rinsing thoroughly; if soap is left in the flannel it hardens it. Kubbing soap on flannel destroys it, because it knots the woollen fibre. " The reason why SUNLIGHT SOAP is the best for washing flannels is that this soap (as proved by Sir Charles Cameron's analysis) contains no ' free alkali'— i.e.., caustic soda or potash—and free alkali has a most destructive effect upon wool, which it eats into and destroys. Flannels washed with coarse, common soap are soon destroyed. "Washed as above, woollen materials will always remain soft, of a good colour, and will not shrink."— From Bow Bells of February 28th, 1896. Search North, South, East or West,

"SUNLIGHT" YEAR-BOOK. 288 Alderney, the Kerry, the Hereford, and the Scotch Highland breed. Speaking generally, the well-known " Shorthorn *' breed are the most numerous and the most impor- tant of all, and are great favourites; they are good Devon Steer milkers, apt to fatten well, and quiet-tempered. The West Highland, as the name implies, prevails in the North-west of Scotland; these cattle will gain flesh where the Shorthorn could scarcely live. But though their milk is rich, it is scanty, and the cows would hardly suit a dairy farmer, unless for poor pasture and cold climate, where other cattle would not thrive. These cattle produce splendid beef. Eereforda and Devons again, are good for meat; but not, perhaps, so good everywhere for dairy purposes. It is said the DevonÂ© will produce more meat than any other breed on the same food. Some maintain, however, that Herefords, in their native county, are as good as Shorthorns. Ayrshire cattle are exceedingly good milkers, even on poor food, but they are not so suitable for raising for the butcher. It is said that a cross between a Shorthorn bull and an Ayrshire cow is an excellent animal. The KerryJs, perhaps, the best breed, and some think the only aboriginal, of Irish cows ; small m size and good as milkers, and also good for getting into excel- lent condition for the butcher. They are excellent for small farms, and will do well even when tethered on a small piece of grass. The Alderney yields a very rich quality of milk, and the creamproduces excellent butter; the quantity, however, is comparatively small. Alderneys include both Jersey and Guernsey cattle, the Jerseys being "butter cows and are Bometimeskept in dairy farms to give good colour to milk and "^UNUGHT SOAP, Highest Award, Chicago, 1893.

"The SCIENCE of CLEANING. MEDICAL OPINION. From SIR CHARLES A. CAMERON, M.D., Ex-President of the Royal College of Surgeons, Vice-President of the Institute of Chemistry of Great Britain, dte., Sc., <Â£c., Laboratory, Eoyal College of Surgeons, Stephen's Green, W., Dublin, February 15th, 1888. I have carefully analysed specimens of the SUN- LIGHT SOAP submitted to me for that purpose by Messrs. Lever Bros., Ltd., and the following are the results at which I have arrived : The points in the composition of this Soap that are the most valuable are its freedom from free alkali, the large percentage of fatty acids which it contains, and the PURITY of the materials employed in its preparation. I employ the Soap my- self, and from my actual experience of it can strongly recommend it. (Signed) CHARLES A. CAMERON. Dr. 0. M. Campbell, a skin doctor of large experience, writing from 37, Queen Ann Street, Cavendish Square, London, says he has tested it repeatedly with a patient Buffering from acute eczema, " The application excited no irritation whatever, although the patient's skin is of the most delicate type."

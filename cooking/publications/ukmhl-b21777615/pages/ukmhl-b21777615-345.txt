THE LAUNDRY. 343 By this method of washing, all boiling, scalding, and blueing are rendered unnecessary. Thus the laundress is spared standing m an atmosphere of steam, and is not exposed to the sweats consequent on working in it, and one of the principal dangers of laundry work is avoided. Sunlight Soap purifies and whitens, and the clothes washed with it never have that peculiar and unpleasant smell imparted to them by soda and coarse soap. The house, instead of reeking with the "smell of washing," is scented as if with the perfume of hayfields.

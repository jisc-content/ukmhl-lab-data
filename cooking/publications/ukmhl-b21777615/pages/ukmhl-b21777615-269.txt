PRESS OPINIONS ON LIFEBUOY SOAP. AN ADMIRABLE SOAP. " Is Lifebuoy Soap Effectively Disinfectant ?—I am glad to know that the objections which apply to mixing disinfectants with our food-stuffs do not in any way affect the great advan- tages that appertain to contraseptic soap. Since first advised by my medical man to use it constantly in my household, I have not had a single case of germ-brought illness, in my family, although I reside in a locality where, of late, zymotic diseases have exten- sively prevailed. Behind and beyond this obviously significant state of things, I can only go on to cite the general agreement which subsists among physicians as to the active prophylactic virtues of this admirable soap." From Science Sifting & for February 27th, 1897. A POWERFUL ANTISEPTIC. "Lifebuoy Eoyal Disinfectant Soap cannot be too highly recommended for use during the summer heat, as it is a powerful antiseptic, and as invaluable for laundry purposes as it is for general use m the household. For bedroom floors and nurseries it should always be employed, and it can be used in hot or cold water as desired." From Weldon's Journal of Costumes, July, 1895. SHOULD FIND A PLACE IN EVERY HOUSEHOLD. "I should like to draw attention to the invaluable disinfectant soap known as 'Lifebuoy Soap,' manufactured by Lever Brothers, ^united. As a cleanser, purifier, and reliable disinfectant soap it has no equal, and in every household it should find a place." From Lady's Pictorial, May 30th, 1896.

THE KEEPING OF POULTRY, 281 Cochin hens delight in sitting, and Mr. Hugh Piper declares that the best and cheapest plan of maintaining a good stock of poultry is to keep one or two full-feathered "Cochins for March or April sittings. A Cochin, moreover, should lay through the winter, as will also Brahmas and Hamburgs up to their second and third year. Pullets, i.e., young Lens, hatched out in March or April, and which will have got over their moulting early (hens do not lay when ■moulting), should begin to lay eggs by November, and continue to lay until February or March, when they may be killed for the table, another suc- cession of fowls taking their place, or they may be kept till the autumn, Beahma, •and then kiUed. It is the management of fowls, so as to obtain a constant succession of fresh young birds and esSB which makes them pay. In other words, "It is," says Mr ^iper, the winter management of fowls that decides the question of profit or loss, for hens will be sure to paV in the summer, even if only tolerably attended to." You mav endeavour to raise successive broods of chickens from lurZ^^^Vi7^ WaUt a near1^ c°»tinuous eg^ supply, as then you will have a succession of pullets coming on to lay one after the other. ° Further, the eggs for sitting need not be all from vour own stock, as it is well to import fresh blood into vour poultry yard; though, of course, the matter is different ifyZ are desirous of maintaining one high-class fancy breed _lt_the hen is "set" in January or February she should the home is always bright.

" SUNLIGHT " YEAR-BOOK. 246 SUNLIGHT SOAP is made in a twin bar We give some examples of architectural styles, which illustrate fundamental principles. The Egyptian columns show the two varieties the one a plain circular column, ornamented with hieroglyphics and having a vase-shaped cap; the other being like nothing so much as a bundle of rods tied together at intervals with a series of band-like hoops round a barrel. The Corinthian column is the pure Grecian type (from the Choragio monument of Lysicratee). The Doric column is from the Parthenon at Athens, and represents the order in its severest and purest form. The Ionio column i3 an Athenian example; some Athenian examples have a neck below the echinus (or quarter- round moulding), decorated with flowers and plants. We only give the original Grecian types of the Classic orders, for the Roman was only a variation therefrom. Our other illustrations represent a Norman column, and the several types of Gothic piers, columns, and caps.

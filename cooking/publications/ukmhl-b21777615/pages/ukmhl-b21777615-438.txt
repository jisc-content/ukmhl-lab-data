PUBLIC OPINION ON LIFEBUOY ROYAL DISINFECTANT SOAP. A Powerful Disinfectant. Boyal Brine Baths, Stafford. Dec. 7th, 1896. Gentlemen,—We have pleasure in testifying to the cleansing and" invigorating properties of your Lifebuoy Soap. We use it in our Turkish and private baths. It is a valuable health tonic. Bathers realize a healthy glow of the skin after the use of Lifebuoy Soap. It is also a powerful disinfectant, and is of great advantage as a sanitary agent. It has only to be tried to be appreciated. Yours faithfully, Jno. Imay (Manager). Prevents the Spread of Infectious Disease. Colne Road, Clacton-on-Sea. Dec. 11th, 1896. Gentlemen,—A case of scarlet fever occurred in the house some weeks ago, one of the visitors' children breaking down with it. By taking ordinary precautions, and the use of Lifebuoy Soap ad lib. for all domestic and toilet purposes, we were successful in confining the outbreak to the one person, although there were twenty- two persons in the house, twelve of these being children. This, I think, proves all, if not more, than you claim for it. Further, our baby, now six months old, has been daily washed with Lifebuoy Soap since born, and although very fat, has never had broken or rough skin. This is a conclusive proof of its purity and excellence. Yours faithfully, N. B. If you wish your linen to be as white as snow,

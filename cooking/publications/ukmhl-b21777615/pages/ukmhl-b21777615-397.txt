BIRTHS, MARRIAGES "AND DEATHS. 395 IBirtbs, flDarriages anb Beatbs, ENGLAND AND WALES. Birth*.—Judging from the Registrar-General's [Returns for 1895—the last complete Returns available—there "were slightly fewer persons born in England and Wales in that year than the average for the preceding ten years. That is to say, they were equal to a rate of 30-4 per 1,000 persons living, or 0-8 below the average rate for the preceding ten years. The lowest rate was in Sussex, viz., 24-3, and in Surrey, West- moreland, Huntingdonshire, Rutlandshire and Devonshire the rate was almost equally low; the counties with highest birth rates were Durham, with 35-8; Staffordshire, 35 6; Mon- mouthshire, 35*0 ; South Wales, 34-9 ; Nottinghamshire, 33-4 ; and Derbyshire, 33-0. The number of boys born' was 468,886, and girls 453,405c But the excess of boys over girls has shown a tendency to decline ever since 1841. The children registered as born out of wedlock were 38,836, and were in the proportion of 42 per 1,000, i.e., out of every 1,000 children born, 42 were born illegitimate. This is about the lowest on record. Marriages.—The number registered was 228,204, which was a slight fall as compared with that of 1894. Judging from the increase in Jewish marriages it appears that the number of Jews living in this country has increased, Re-marriage, i.e., marriages of widowers and widows, were the lowest on record. A large number of persons still seem unable to write, for 40 out of every 1,000 men signed the marriage register with marks instead of with their names, and similarly illiterate women were 48 out of every 1,000. Twenty-nine marriagea took place by special license. Deaths.—The deaths registered in 1895 numbered 568,997, an increase of 2-1 per 1,000 on the very low rate of 1894, but slightly lower than the average of the ten preceding years. The rate in 1895 was 18-7 per 1,000 of the population, whereas in 1894 the rate was 16-6 per 1,000 of the population. 0! the deaths, 290,704 were males and 278,293 were females.

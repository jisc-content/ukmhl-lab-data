I THE ROAST BEEF OF OLD ENGLAND 177 Unsheath me, mine host, thy Toledo so bright; Delicious Sir Loin! I dub thee a knight; Be thine at our banquets of honour the post— While the Queen rules the realm, let Sir Loin rule the roast!" Variants of this popular tradition have even found their way into local histories. In “The Traditions of Lancashire ” the scene is changed to Houghton Tower, near Blackburn, and the hero this time is James I. During the King’s visit in 1617 to this mansion high revelry was held, including sports, a masque, and much feasting. The local historian of the County Palatine says that while James “ sat at meat, casting his eyes upon a noble s«Hoin at the lower end of the table, he cried out, ‘ Bring hither that surloin, sirrah, for ’tis worthy a more honourable post, being, as I may say, not sur-Won, but s/r-loin, the noblest joint of all ! ’ which ridiculous and desperate pun raised the wisdom and reputation of England’s Solomon to the highest.’’ Those who would credit this story have the authority of Dr. Johnson to support them, among whose explanations of the word sir, in his dictionary, is that it is “a title given to the loin of beef which one of our kings knighted in a fit of good-humour.” Dr. Pegge, a learned antiquary, though no great authority on language, says : “ Surloin is, I conceive, if not knighted by King James as is reported, com- pounded of the French sur, “ upon,” and the English loin, for the sake of euphony, our particles not easily submitting to composition. In proof of this, the piece of beef so called grows upon the loin, and behind the small ribs of the animal.” Following up this idea, the double sirloin has received the fanciful name of baron, and we thus find Scott, in “ Old Mortality,” speaking of “ The knightly sirloin, and the noble baron of beef." 12

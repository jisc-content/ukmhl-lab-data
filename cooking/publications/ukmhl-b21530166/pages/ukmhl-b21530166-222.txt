196 GOOD CHEER stituted, and butter has given way, naturally enough in a land of beefeaters, to beef suet. It has even been suggested that the practice of pouring spirit over the Christmas pudding and setting it afire is a relic of the fire worship—fire as symbolic of the returning sun—with which our pagan ancestors cele- brated this midwinter festival. It is worthy of note that the famous “ Mrs. Glasse ” gives a recipe for “ plumb-porridge for Christmas.” (A long chapter in the same work, on the subject of Lenten diet, gives various onion and fish soups as suitable dishes to ” fast ” upon.) Since that time, however, the “ porridge ” has given way to the more inviting “ pudding,” which, on the authority of the Lancet, is not so unwhole- some as most people think. At which let us rejoice. “ Who pours the brandy in libation free Finds rich plum-pudding realised in thee ! Chaunts the high hymn of themes that far surpass The luxuries of honour’d Mrs. Glasse.” It is the writer of these heroic rhymes who also apostrophises the mince-pie :— “ Oh, King of Cates, whose pastry-bounded reign Is felt and own’d o’er Pastry’s wide domain.” Dr. Parr, by the way, was quite wrong in rebuking a lady for calling these cates by that appellation rather than by that of Christmas pies. Cavalier as well as Puritan commonly used the name descriptive of the contents of the pie—not the name which spoke of the season in which the pie was eaten. For the rest, the mince-pie of our forefathers was, as may be guessed, a richer one than our own, and invariably contained minced flesh-meat, generally beef or veal. The “ Compleat Cook ” of 1655 recommends a little verjuice.

316 GOOD CHEER the people—which to the ignorant, whose notions of Dutchmen have been gathered only from libellous proverbs and pert sayings current among their neigh- bours, will seem to be a nearly impossible catastrophe. It is, however, such alone who will laugh at Mulder’s lament over the waning energies of the Hollander. Those who are conversant with his history—those, even, who can read the visible characters impressed on the strange kingdom which he has conquered from the waves, and maintains in despite of them—well know that, whatever he may now be, there was a time when, for patient courage, inflexible will, and an industry that nothing could daunt or weary, the man of the Low Countries had not his equal in Europe. One phase of his case Professor Mulder puts rather neatly thus :— , “ Now, if that quantity of albumen which is absolutely necessary for the body is to be obtained from potatoes, the stomach must in that case be crammed with such a mass of this provender that it will act injuriously on the whole body.

So distended, and blown up like a leathern bottle, a stomach that admits much useless matter, and gains from the mass but little that is of use to it, is in an unnatural condition. The bulk of the substance that daily fills the abdomen oppresses the nerves which are in close connexion with the brain.

Thus, he who eats largely of potatoes cannot, for the reasons given, be elastic;—he receives at once both far too much and far too little.” It may go against one’s spiritual belief to set up the cook above Cato, and to believe that the

GOOD CHEER 184 Lobscouse was a savoury dish of beef, potatoes, and onions fried together, and formerly eaten in the Cumbrian district as the dish with which to celebrate Twelfth Night. Toad-in-the-hole is the fanciful folk-name for pieces of meat, sausage, or kidney, baked in a batter pudding. The French have not less than five hundred different kinds of soup, making almost endless varieties of their consomme (clear gravy soups, the clarified liquor in which flesh of some kind or other has been boiled) ; of their Julienne (clear vegetable soups, those in which roots have been finely shredded) ; and of their puree (thick soups in which either vegetables have been pulped or meat or fish has been pounded and sieved). Compared with all these, how few are native British soups—kale brose, cock- a-leekie, mutton broth, oxtail, giblet, split pea, grouse, and (the Anglo-Indian) muligatawny soups. Only poverty of culinary inventiveness and a plentiful lack of manipulative skill in the kitchen can account for so wide a disparity. However, with the assistance and encouragement of the Food Cookery Association, British taste and culinary practice are to be vastly improved in the immediate future. By means of lectures, exhibitions, and other forms of propagandism, a new era of British cookery is to dawn upon us—among other reforms, English housewives are to be taught the culinary possibilities of butter, and to be made acquainted with some of the two hundred and forty methods of preparing potatoes. Greatest revolution of all is the promised abolition of pots and sauce- pans, and with them much of the kitchen drudgery, by the advent of the paper-bag cookery.

GOOD CHEER 394 The formulas used by different toastmasters vary ; some are more elaborate than others, but all have to be correct in a matter of precedence, such as “ Your Excellency, My Lords, Ladies, and Gentle- men, pray charge your glasses 1 ” “ This done ” (says G. C. Maclean in an article on the subject) “ the toastmaster announces the name of the person proposing the toast, and ultimately the name of the seconder. Altogether there is a fine sense of cere- mony about the office of a toastmaster which imparts dignity to the functions at which he presides.” Toast-drinking, with its accompanying speech- making at public dinners, especially when the speakers are prosy and ineffective, is often enough a weariness to the flesh. “Afflict us not, ye gods ! though sinners, With many days like this, and dinners.” Public spirit, or at least corporate spirit, may be invigorated by such social functions. But the common fault of many public banquets is an undue lengthening of a formal toast list, which involves the consumption of too much wine, and really detracts from the pleasure of the earlier part of the pro- ceedings .

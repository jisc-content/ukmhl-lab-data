GOOD CHEER 318 We may be reluctant to admit the supreme virtue of victuals in the formation of a manly character, but our learned professor has no doubts whatever about the moral claims of the art of cookery. In conclusion, he repeats and emphasises his arguments â€”that with the organised body of man are inti- mately bound up his spiritual powers ; that civilised thinking men require a peculiar kind of sustenance ; and that in his rudest state of nature only does man, in common with the beasts of prey, enjoy his flesh diet raw. Maintaining his general thesis with learning and plausibility. Professor Mulder had not the slightest compunction in banning the potato from the dietary of the Irish peasant and the Dutch boor.

THE ROAST BEEF OF OLD ENGLAND 183 times, low-beamed and smoke-blackened, with gaping hearth where the revolving spit seemed to have solved the problem of perpetual motion, are becoming fewer and harder to find every year. The baron of beef, which comprises both sides of the back, or the double sirloin, a huge joint which may range from fifty to a hundred pounds in weight, is always roasted, though seldom prepared now, except on festive occasions at the English Court. The saddle of mutton—the two loins undivided—is a more convenient joint. The aldermanic propensity to dine well has given us two English cookery terms typical of municipal festivities. The “ Alderman in chains ” is a turkey roasted with festooning links of sausage ; the “ Alderman’s walk ” is the name given to the centre cut obtained by making a long incision along the haunch of mutton (or, it may be, the haunch of veni- son) where the most delicate slices are to be found. Whenever the English mind has left the “ plains ” of cookery, and soared aloft to the heights of “ made dishes,” the result may invariably be described as simple and satisfying. The old English supper dish, salmagundi, was a meat-salad, mixed and decorated with hard-boiled eggs, anchovy, pickles, and beet- root. The other strangely-named dish, gallimaufry, was a hotch-potch made up of all the scraps of the larder. Haricot is a thick meat stew containing haricot beans ; haricot mutton is a ragout made with hashed mutton and turnips—in old French, harigot meant a ” morsel.” Bubble-and-squeak is a dish which could not possibly be other than English. It consists of cold boiled meat and greens fried. They first bubbled in the water when boiled, and afterwards squeaked or hissed in the frying-pan.

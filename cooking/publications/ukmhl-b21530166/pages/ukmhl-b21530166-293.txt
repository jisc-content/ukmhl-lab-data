COOKERY-BOOK DIVERSIONS 261 is believed to be Mrs. Johnston, author of many- excellent tales and novels. “ Timothy Tickler ” relates how he, with a dozen others, entered a Haggis sweepstakes, and that his Haggis ran second to that of Mrs. Meg Dods. Dr. Kitchiner was an eccentric who practised what he taught, and had ample means for the purpose. He inherited £70,000 from his father, which was more than sufficient to enable him to work out his ideal of life. He wrote several other pleasant works besides the “ Cook’s Oracle,” which is full of common-sense practice ; one of them was a volume of National Songs, published for the coronation of George IV. in 1820. He was an epicure, an experimenter in cookery, and had a nice taste in the selection of viands, yet was himself abstemious withal. His dinners were always cooked according to his own method, and he gave a conversazione every Tuesday evening. Over his drawing-room chimney was a placard bearing the notice, “ Come at seven, go at eleven.” George Colman, the actor, once being one of his guests, slyly inserted the word “ it ” after the word ‘‘ go.” All the same, no deviation was allowed from the doctor’s usual practice—on the stroke of eleven hats, coats, and umbrellas were brought in, and a hearty ” Good-night ” sped the departing guests. The form of invitation issued on these occasions ran in this wise :— “ Dear Sir,—The honour of your company is requested to dine with the Committee of Taste, on Wednesday next, the loth inst. The specimens will be placed on the table at five o'clock pre- cisely, when the business of the day will immediately commence, “ I have the honour to be “ Your most obedient servant “W. Kitchiner (Sec.)] ^'August 25, 1825, “43, Warren Sired, Fitzroy Square"

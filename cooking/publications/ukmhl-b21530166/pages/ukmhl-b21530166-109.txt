MONASTIC CULINARY INFLUENCES 91 of food (and sometimes of clothing) made in the way of charity or in part payment for services ; a timid and temporising practice which ran up the expenditure of the royal, noble, and monastic households very considerably. Perhaps that feature of monachism which most insured the favour of the people was the constant hospitality maintained at these monasteries, and which extended its invitations to every class of society, from the nobleman to the beggar. In every monas- tery of importance a large room or guest-hall, sur- rounded with sleeping apartments, was appropriated for the reception of travellers, who were allowed to remain two days and two nights as visitors, but were expected, if they continued after that time, and were in health, to conform to the rule of the house. Even in the reign of Henry VIII. inns were not frequent, and where they did exist they presented a scene of dirt and wretchedness which was scarcely tolerable even in those days of comparative indiffer- ence to cleanliness. Erasmus, who had a national susceptibility on this point, has spoken very forcibly on the miseries of an English inn at that period. It was, therefore, a most acceptable resource to travellers of all ranks to enter within the secure and commodious precincts of a monastery, where they were sure of good fare and a comfortable lodging. Even the nobility, when on their journeys, usually dined at one religious house and supped at another. When Ralph, Abbot of Canterbury, was installed in 1309, six thousand persons were entertained, and the dishes served up amounted to three thousand. Richard Winchelsey, Archbishop of Canterbury, pro- vided daily victuals for five thousand poor people, and immense crowds of sick and infirm who were unable to attend his gate were supplied with neces- saries at their own houses.

221 COUNTY FEASTS cherished recollections of old times, and scenes and beings far away ; but each year would possibly bring some later comer, whose tidings of the more recent doings in the much-loved locality would impart a fresh interest to the meeting. In 1654 the Men of .Wiltshire dined together ; the sermon preached on the occasion was published the following year with the title— “The First Dish at the Wiltshire Feast, November 9, 1654, or a Sermon Preached at Lawrence Jury to those that there offered their Peace Offerings, and went thence to Dine at Marchant-Taylors’ Hall. By Samuel Annesley, LL.D. Minister of the Gospel at John Evangelist’s, London.” The sermons preached at the County Feasts appear to have generally been printed. The “ Biographia Dramatica ” mentions a piece entitled “ The Huntingdon Divertisement ; or, an Enterlude for the general Entertainment at the County Feast held at Merchant Taylors’ Hall, June 20, 1678,” the scene of which, it tells us, lies in Hinchinbrooke grove, fields, and meadows. The men of Yorkshire met for their first feast on December 3, 1678. Occasionally more than ordinary pains were taken to increase the interest in, and add to, the splendour of the feast. Thus, in March, 1689-90, we find the Yorkshire meeting announced in the London Gazette '(then the ordinary vehicle for such intima- tions), as follows :— “The Annual Yorkshire Feast will be held the 27th instant, at Merchant Taylors’ Hall in Threadneedle Street, where will be a very splendid Entertainment of all sorts of Vocal and Instrumental Musick. Tickets are to be had at Man’s Coffee-House at Charing Cross, at Clifford’s Inn Coffee-House in Fleet Street, and at Blew- Coats Coffee-House in Swithin’s Alley, near the Royal Exchange in Cornhill.”

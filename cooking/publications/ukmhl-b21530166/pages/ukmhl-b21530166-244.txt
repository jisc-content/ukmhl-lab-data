216 GOOD CHEER hundred and fifty years ago may be interesting for two reasons. The record shows the intimate con- nection between the Court and Richmond in an earlier era than that of George II. ; and the item “ Maiden’s Gains ” suggests itself as an earlier name for “ Maids of Honour.” About Christmas, in 1508, some of the Court officials of Henry VHI. dined together at the village of Shene, now called Rich- mond, the following being the items of the bill :— “ For brede, i2d.; ale, 3s. 4d. ; wyne, lod. ; two leynes mutton, 8d.; maribones, 6d.; poudred beef, 3d.; two capons, 2S.; two geese, i4d.; five conyes, 13d.; one legge moton, 31b. weight, 4d.; six plovers, i8d.; six pigeons, 3d.; two dozen larkes, I2d.; salt sauce, 6d.; butter and eggs, lod. ; maiden’s gaynes, I2d.; herbes, id.; spices, 2s. 4d.; floure, 4d.; whight cuppes and cruses, 6d.” It was an old custom in some parts of the country to make, during Lent and Easter, a kind of rich and expensive pastry called Simnel cake. They were raised cakes, the crust of which was made with fine flour and water, coloured a deep yellow with saffron, and the interior was filled with the materials of a very rich plum cake, with plenty of candied lemon-peel and other goodies on the top. The name Simnel is derived from the Latin simila, “ fine flour.” The father of Lambert Simnel, the well-known pretender to the crown of Henry VII., was said to be a baker, and a maker of Simnel cakes. A Shropshire legend pretends that these cakes were first made at Shrewsbury by an honest couple named Simon and Nelly, who quarrelled about the method of cooking their joint production, one wanting to bake it, the other to boil it. The dispute ended in a compromise—they agreed to boil it first and bake it afterwards, and in token of this blessed agreement they called it after their own conjoined names—‘‘ Sim-nell ! ” The legend has about as much truth in it as the majority of such tales.

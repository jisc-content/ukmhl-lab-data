155 INTRODUCTION OF FORKS At Herculaneum were found a few two-branched in- struments, but it cannot be accepted that the Romans used forks at table. The first instance of the regular use of table forks recorded in history was that by John, the “ good ” Duke of Burgundy, and he had only two. A drawing of a supposed Saxon fork—it may possibly have been used for eating pickles or preserves—is given in Chambers’s “ Book of Days,” ii. p. 573. As regards the use of forks in Italy, we find them mentioned by Peter Damiani, an Italian writer of the eleventh century. To warn a lady, to whom he is writing, of the great danger of setting her heart on luxurious living, he proceeds to tell her a story which he had heard from a person of veracity ;— “ The Doge of Venice had married a lady from Constantinople, whose luxury surpassed all imagination. She would not even wash in common water, but had the cruelty to compel her servants to collect rain water for her ! . . . But what is most monstrous, this wicked creature would not eat with her fingers, but absolutely had her food cut into pieces, rather small (minutius), by her attendants, and then—she actually conveyed them to her mouth with certain golden two-pronged forks! ’’ With the judgment which, of course, befell this pro- fligate slave of luxury we are not concerned ; but we at least discover the important fact that the luxury of forks was a novelty in Italy in Damiani’s days— i.e., about the time of William the Conqueror. In the household expenses of Edward I. we have a list of his personal effects taken at his decease, at Burgh-on-Sands, 1307. In it appear; “six silver forks, one gold fork, and a pair of table knives with handles of crystal.” Cooking forks and dessert forks were not unknown in England in early times. After its introduction the use of a fork at table was long considered a superfluous luxury ; so much so, it was forbidden to convents in most countries.

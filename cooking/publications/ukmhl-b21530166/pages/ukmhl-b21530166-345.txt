NATIONAL FOODS AND PREJUDICES 307 It may be surprising to learn that the haggis of Scotland, which in Dr. Johnson’s day was vulgarly supposed to be incompatible with an Englishman’s remaining at table, was a dish which every man in England affected in the time of the Commonwealth. In Markham’s “ English Housewife,” published 1653, is a passage dealing with the use of oatmeal. After recipes for making oat-cakes and gruel, it says the same meal may be mixed with blood, and the liver of sheep, calf, or pig, thus making “ that pudding which is called haggas, of whose goodness it is in vain to boast, because there is hardly to be found a man that does not affect them.” Dr. Johnson’s definition of oats falls rather flat after this. Markham goes on to describe a food called Wash-brew, made of the very small oatmeal by frequent steeping of it, and then boiling it into a jelly, to be eaten with honey, wine, milk, or ale, according to taste. This is practically the same kind of “ dainty for a weak stomach ” as Sir Kenelm Digby describes under the name of Wheaten Flomery. The modus operandi by which singed sheep’s head is brought to table is thoroughly typical of a primi- tive community. The head is taken to a smithy, the wool is carefully singed off, first on the smith’s fire, a rod being inserted in the nose, for facility in turning it over. It is then gone over with a red-hot bar of iron till every vestige of the wool is removed. Before it is cooked, the head is split through, and the brains removed. After being steeped in strong salt and water, it is carefully cleaned and put into a large soup-pot, with pearl barley, onions, cabbage, or kale, turnips and carrots cut up small, the latter sometimes grated. The soup thus made is excellent, and the head, with which the trotters are frequently boiled, is equally good. As the Shepherd in “ Noctes Ambrosianas ” says :

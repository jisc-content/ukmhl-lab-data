GOOD CHEER 244 was made. We read once of “ May butter ” ; and there was a “ salt butter,” which was very ill-made and much over-salted. Or perhaps the recipes came originally from Italy and the South of France, where the climate does not favour the use of cream. The recipes (or “ secrets ”as they are termed) given in some old cookery-books are too barbarous to be transcribed. For instance, one may learn from them “ how to roast and eat a goose alive, so that it would shriek when being carved, very pleasant to the beholders ” ; how a live lamprey was to be “ fried, boiled, and roasted at the same time ” ; and “ how a living fowl, fluttering in agony, turned the spit ” upon which it was roasting.

Leaving these ancient culinary atrocities, more comfortable by far is it to learn, from the ‘‘ Archimagirus Anglo-Gallicus ” of Dr. Mayerne, the recipe for that homely dish “ Lorxdon pie,” which was this authority’s chef d'oeuvre:— “ Take eight marrow-bones, eighteen sparrows, one pound of pota- toes, quarter of a pound of eringoes, two ounces of lettuce stalks, forty chestnuts, half a pound of dates, a peck of oysters, quarter pound of preserved citron, three artichokes, twelve eggs, two sliced lemons, a handful of pickled barberries, quarter ounce of whole pepper, half ounce of sliced nutmeg, half ounce of whole cinnamon, quarter ounce of whole cloves, half ounce of mace, quarter pound of currants. Liquor it, when it is baked, with white wine, butter, and sugar.” Dr. Mayerne had been physician to four kings, Henry IV. of France, James I., Charles I., and Charles II. of England, and he held a well-defined place in medical science. He was a noted bon vivant,

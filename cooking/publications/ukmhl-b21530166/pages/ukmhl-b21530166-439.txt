AT THE FESTIVE BOARD 393 chosen from' among themselves by the throwing of dice. The modern representative of this functionary is the toastmaster at public banquets. As master of the ceremonies at the big London banquets he is always a great feature in the evening’s proceedings. He is invariably a man of good presence, and the possessor of a clear, ringing voice, and he generally uses an elaborate formula for intro- ducing the various items on the programme. The toastmaster sprang into existence some time in the eighteenth century, and most probably the office was created in the ever-hospitable city of London. Part of the old City toastmaster’s duties,” we read, ” necessitated his wearing a most portentous cocked hat, and a scarlet waistcoat richly faced with gold ” ; and we are reminded that it was in this glowing garb the father of Toole the actor spent his official life. It does not follow that a man who has to direct the ceremonial drinking of many others drinks too much himself ; and therefore we can only accept as a caricature (as no doubt Dickens intended it) “ Henry Beller, many years toastmaster at various corporation dinners,” who appears as one of the interesting converts to temperance in “ The Report of the Committee of the Brick Lane Branch of the United Grand Junction Ebenezer Temperance Association.” A capital anecdote is that preserved in Notes and Queries (1879), which tells that during the short-lived Peace of Amiens (1802) the chairman at one of the city banquets proposed the toast of “ The Health of the Three Present Consuls,” which the toastmaster took up in his stentorian accents, and by mistake or a happy inspiration translated into “ The Health of the Three per cent. Consols I ” The company, we are told, honoured the toast with great enthusiasm, and we can well believe it.

HACKWOOD Author oj “Inns, Ales, and Drinking Customs of Old England," “Old English Sports," &c., &c. With a Coloured Frontispiece and 32 other Illustrations In this volume the life of the common people in Old England is treated from the historic and picturesque side. The book traces the slow evolution of the English rustics from Saxon thrall and Norman villein; it deals in a fascinating way with gipsies, vagrants, beggars, pedlars, outlaws, and other queer characters of the roads ; with the relations of high and low in the days of our forefathers ; with almshouses, “ ’spitals,” and charity schools ; with the parish system and Bumble- dom generally, and with many other matters connected with the life of the poorer classes. The imminent break-up of the Poor Laws gives the volume a topical interest, but it is no dry-as-dust treatise for sociological students, but a book full of vivid human interest. LONDON : T.

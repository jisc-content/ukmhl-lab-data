81 EARLY ENGLISH FARE articles were boiled, baked,’ or broiled, and were handed by the attendants upon small spits to the company. . . . The diners made use of their fingers to eat with, but for the sake of cleanliness each person was provided with a small silver ewer containing water and two flowered napkins of the finest linen. Their dessert consisted of grapes, figs, nuts, apples, pears, and almonds.” The well-to-do Saxon trader lived in great comfort. He was absolute master in his own house, but the household was directed by his wife. Everything was made in the house ; the flour was ground, the bread was baked, the meat and fish were salted. These were the staple foods. In the Norman period the good housewife might keep her pantry and her larder well victualled in advance, but fresh beef and mutton were still scarce. Very little venison or other game found its way to their tables, the Game Laws being so exceedingly strict. In the London cookshops boiled and roast meats, and fish and poultry and game in season, might be bought by those who had the money to pay for them. The Normans introduced into this country a system of cookery of a comparatively high class, though as the centuries rolled on the tradition of this school became obscured, and gave way to a coarser style of heavy feeding. No doubt the tables of the early Norman kings displayed a profuse quantity of food, but despite the occasional use of coarse material, the excellence of the cookery threw into the shade the efforts of later epochs. The Normans were dainty eaters, epicures, and therefore their cooking was nice. Rich spices were plentifully used. Among the grand dishes provided on great occasions were the boar’s head, and the peacock, served to the blare of trumpets, with much ceremonial—of which more anon. A dish of cranes was a favourite dish on the table of a baron. 6

In estimating the latter, history informs us that we owe the deaths of at least two English monarchs to over-indulgence at the table—Henry I. from eating too freely of lampreys, and King John from a suicidal indulgence in peaches and new ale. Had the great Napoleon not been compelled to leave the battlefield of Leipsic at a critical moment, owing to a severe attack of colic brought on by over-indulgence in one of his favourite but in- digestible dishes, it is believed that tremendous conflict might have ended very differently. The celebrated John Hunter said :— “ Some physiologists will have it that the stomach is a mill; others, that it is a fermenting-vat; others again, that it is a stew- pan ; but in my opinion, gentlemen, it is neither a mill, nor a ferment-vat, nor a stew-pan ; but a stomach, gentlemen, a stomach ! ” Every one is said to possess the stomach he deserves, and there can be no doubt that our digestions are of our own making.

COOKERY-BOOK DIVERSIONS 243 sixty-two cooks had at their command 515 kitchen assistants. Such was the luxury and magnificence of an English prelate. Among other terms employed in the “ Boke ” of 1467 are “ Cratons ”—cretons, an old French word for a preparation of scraps of pork or other meat ; “ mortes ”—probably the dish prescribed by Lord Bacon as excellent to nourish those that are weak, and made of brawn of capons, stamped, strained, and mingled with like quantity of almond butter ; “ acoles ”—evidently the same as the “ cullice ” of cocks, another of Lord Bacon’s dishes ; in modern cookery-books, known as “ coulis,” it is the juice that flows from meat and forms the foundation of savoury sauces.

Milk and butter seem to have been so seldom used that we may infer they were very scarce articles. The explanation, perhaps, is that the cows were too ill-fed to yield very little more milk than their calves needed, and there v/ere certainly many months of the year in which no butter

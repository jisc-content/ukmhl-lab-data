The refectories of the monasteries and the kitchens of the ecclesiastics were the strongholds of English medieval cookery. Giraldus Cambrensis informs us that the table of the monks of Canterbury consisted daily of sixteen covers of the most costly dainties, dressed with the most exquisite skill. He relates that the monks of Winchester threw themselves ,at the feet of Henry 11. and complained with tears in their eyes that their abbot, the bishop of the diocese, had taken from them three of the usual number of their dishes. The King, however, thought they were still well off with ten, as he had to content himself with three dishes. In the old records the chief official of the refectory department is described as Magister Coquincs, and his duties seem to have been those of a purveyor of provisions, while the cook who dressed the food is called Coquinarius. The officer charged with the care of entertaining strangers and seeing that they were provided with necessaries was styled Hospiti- larius.

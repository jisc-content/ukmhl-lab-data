163 WHEN ENGLAND FED ITSELF of its cheeses, Cheshire of its salt, and Cornwall of its pies. Kent, “ the garden of England,” had already made a name for its hops, Middlesex for its cherries and its cabbages, .Worcestershire for its pears, and Leicestershire for its beans. As for apples, Herefordshire and Gloucestershire claimed to grow the best, though there was a popular ditty in the north which said ;— “He that will fish for a Lancashire man at any time or tide Must bait his hook with a good egg-pie, or an apple with a red side.” It was then Middlesex for grain, and the loaves which Queen Elizabeth ate were made from' the good flour of Heston white wheat. As Hampshire men were dubbed “ hogs ” in allusion to their pig-breeding, so Bedford folk were nicknamed ” malt-horses ” because of the high quality of malt they produced from their barley. The Isle of Man was noted for its oats, and Essex for saffron, which was so much used in olden times ; for people were fond of little currant cakes flavoured with saffron, and they had also great belief in this herb as a cure for fever and other ailments. This plant was therefore more grown and worth more than it is now ; and the town of Saffron Walden got its name from the great beds of it that were regularly grown in that neighbourhood. Essex had a reputation for its calves, and the Lancashire kine were said to be the biggest in England and to show the finest horns and the best hides. The freshwater fish and the wild fowl from the Lincolnshire fens were highly thought of, and Wytham pike and Ancholm' eels were as well known and prized as Severn lampreys and Thames salmon

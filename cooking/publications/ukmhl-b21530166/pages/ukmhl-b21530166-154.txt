GOOD CHEER 132 Sir William Davenant (1673) :— “ Beafe that the queasie-stomach’d Guard would please.” And Cartwright (1651) :— “Of the eaters beef Those goodly Juments of the Guard would fight (As they eat beef) after six stone a day.” In Fronde’s “History of England” (x. 312) is a reference to the “Queen’s Beefs” in 1571. The argument is clinched by the dismissal of “ buffetiers ” as a non-existent word.

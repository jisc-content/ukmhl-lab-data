152 GOOD CHEER his fingers, whence ensued an unpleasing assimilation of the said fingers to the colour of a duck’s foot, on account of the much saffron then put into the sauces and soup.” This writer, who evidently knew the use of forks, compliments the King (Matthias Corvinus) on his “ kingly knack of eating without a fork, keep- ing up the table-talk, and never smearing the clothes.” Although the table fork has become to us almost a part of the human hand, the whole of the civilised world is not a slave to it. The wealthy Chinese furnish their table with cloths of the costliest silk, but they do not use plates, knives, or forks. Each person at table has a bowl of food and a pair of little ivory or ebony chopsticks, with which every one, from’ the oldest to the youngest, is able to make the most dexterous and effective play. But even if they could not, good soup may be swallowed from a bowl. Forks and spoons are ex- cellent implements ; but fingers, as the proverb reminds us, took precedence with our unsophisti- cated ancestors ; his sacred Majesty Charles XII. of Sweden was probably not the only monarch who buttered his bread with his royal thumb. As showing the growing use of table cutlery among the upper classes in the Cromwellian period, it may be mentioned that one Charles Rivet made a con- siderable sum by selling knives and forks with bronze handles. He pretended that the bronze was that which had constituted the statue of Charles I., cast in 1633, before the war had broken out. He was a brazier with a speculative turn of mind, who had bought the statue as “ scrap ” from the Parliament, and pretended to have destroyed it—as a matter of fact, it is the one which still adorns Charing Cross. All the same, his ” souvenir ” forks were eagerly bought by devoted loyalists.

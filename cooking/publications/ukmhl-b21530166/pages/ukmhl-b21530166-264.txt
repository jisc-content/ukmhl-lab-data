234 GOOD CHEER and, in the end, with admirable judgment, he makes peace by “A draught of wine, yea, of a ripe grape.” Drunkenness surely misbecomes the cook more than most men. The office of the culinary artist is one which has a subtle, if not a dominating, influence on the daily life of those for whom it is his business to cater. He rules the roast, says one proverb ; the cook is not to be taught in his own kitchen, says another. That he is sometimes given to rule those whom he is paid to serve would appear to have been felt in the days of the Latin poet Martial, who, twenty centuries ago, wrote : “I prefer that the courses at our banquet should give pleasure to the guests rather than the cooks.” Dr. (William King, who flourished between 1663 and 1712, and gave us the “Art of Cookery,” says that “’Tis by his cleanliness a cook must please.” A dirty cook is an abomination. One ancient writer makes contemptuous reference to the “ sluttery of the cook.” That he does not always succeed in pleasing is a fact made evident by the crystallisation of his shortcomings into proverbial form. One old saw, which begins by telling us that God sends meat, completes the postulate by giving an entirely opposite origin for the cooks who are sent to dress the benign gifts of Heaven. Another, equally well known, has reference to the spoiling of the broth by the officious interference of too many tenders of the seething pot.

FEASTS, HISTORIC OR NOTABLE 401 At the end of this course the gates of the hall were again thrown open, and amidst another flourish of trumpets the Champion, clad in complete steel and mounted on a piebald charger, rode inside the dining- hall, holding a steel gauntlet in his hand. The “ awful challenge ” having been delivered, Mr. Dymock flung down the gauntlet with a clash. No one accepting the challenge, the heralds picked up the glove, delivered it to the squire, who kissed it, and handed it back to the Champion. This ceremony was repeated in the middle of the hall, and a third time at the foot of the royal dais. The King then drank the health of his gallant Champion, after- wards sending the cup to him, who in turn drank the royal health. The ancient ceremony con- cluded with the Champion gracefully backing his charger out of the hall amidst tumultuous cheering. Hall gives a quaint account of a similar per- formance by “ Sir Robert Dimmoke, Champion to the Kynge,” when Henry VIII. and Queen Catherine of Aragon were crowned. The same old writer also tells how, at the procession of Queen Anne Boleyn, a fountain on Cornhill ran Rhenish wine, and a conduit in Cheap spouted claret. The streets were made to “ run with wine ” on such festive occasions in the olden times. In a curious and elaborate folio work, entitled “ The History of the Coronation of James II.,” pub- lished by Royal command in 1687, a full account of the coronation feast, comprising a total of 1,445 dishes, is given, with references to a large engraving showing the disposition of these on the tables. Amongst them are cocks’ combs, stags’ tongues, cockles, spinage tails, periwinkles, crabs, egg-pies, quails, gammons of bacon, leverets, &c. London’s great civic feasts are held at the Guild- 26

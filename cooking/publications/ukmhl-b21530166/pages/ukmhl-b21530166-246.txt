218 GOOD CHEER These buns may possibly have originated as hot cross buns, and acquired so notable a reputation and so large a sale as to have made it profita'ble to produce them all the year round. On Good Friday mornings their popularity was certainly extra- ordinary, and the Chelsea Bun House always pre- sented a scene of great bustle on this day of the year, as many as fifty thousand persons assem- bling there, and buying these tasty wares to the extent of £250 worth. In 1793 a notice was posted on “ The Royal Bun House ” that in con- sequence of the disturbances which had occurred by the assembling of such a vast concourse on the previous Good Friday, no “Cross Buns “ would be sold on that day, but only the “ Chelsea Buns,” as usual. After the closing of the Ranelagh Gardens the bun trade began to decline, though on the Good Friday of 1839 as many as twenty-four thousand buns were sold here. A few years later this once- famous rendezvous had been cleared away, and the Bun House collection of pictures and curiosities dis- persed. A new Bun House was erected in its place— —there were always rival and counterfeit establish- ments—but the glory of Chelsea’s “ Royal Bun House ” was departed for ever. Chelsea enjoyed a reputation not only for well-spiced buns, but for custards as well, if we may judge from the follow- ing allusion to them by Gay, in his “ Trivia ” :— “ When W and G , mighty names, are dead. Or but as Chelsea under custards read.” About the end of the eighteenth century a bun became popular in Bath by the name of “ Sally Lunn.” Sally Lunns originated through a young woman of that name crying them through the streets of the city night and morning, and selling them from a basket neatly draped with a white cloth.

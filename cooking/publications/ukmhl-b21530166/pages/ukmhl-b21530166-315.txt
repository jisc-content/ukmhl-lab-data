GASTROLATORS 279 Antiquity produced a number of gluttons whose marvellous feats place them in the front rank, ritormus had an ox served for his supper, and when he rose from the table not a morsel remained. (The classic writers who swallowed this tale are not gener- ally included in our category.) Astydamas of Miletus, invited to supper by the Persian AriobarT zanes, devoured a feast which had been prepared for nine persons. Cambis, King of Lydia, had an appetite so fiercely compelling that one night the glutton unfortunately devoured his wife ! Thys, King of the Paphlagonians, was afflicted with a voracity which had a precisely similar annoying result. Then there was the Persian Cantibaris, the energy of whose appetite caused him to eat so long that it required relays of attentive servants to press the food into his mouth. Modern efforts after these brilliant examples may appear somewhat feeble. The Sicilians of old were as notorious for their gluttony as were the Spartans for their abstemious- ness. The Romans, as a nation, were enormous eaters ; and the average robust Britisher of the John Bull type is by no means an indifferent trencherman, though his gourmanderie may be less discriminating than that of the ancients. A healthy appetite is no doubt a blessing. “ Let us raise our gratitude to the goodness of God,” says that old gossip, Thomas Fuller, “ especially when he giveth us appetite enough for our meat, and yet meat too much for our appetite.” To this worthy’s period—the seventeenth century—belongs one of the greatest stuffers whose feats have ever been recorded. This was Nicholas Wood, who challenged Taylor the Water Poet to eat at one time as much black- pudding as would reach across the Thames at any place between London and Richmond. ‘‘ Two loynes

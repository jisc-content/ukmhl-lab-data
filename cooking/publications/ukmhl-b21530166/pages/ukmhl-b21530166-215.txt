“THE STAFF OF LIFE” 189 In the religious houses there were generally four different grades of bread baked in the monastic ovens. The best, designated panis annigerorum, was in- tended for the abbot’s guests and wayfaring callers of distinction. Panis conventualis was an inferior bread baked for the members of the fraternity them- selves.

By the reign of Henry HI. the price of wheat had advanced to fifteen or twenty shillings a quarter. For centuries the law demanded that weekly returns should be made by millers, meal-men, bakers, and others, of their traffickings in grain, flour, and meal of all sorts ; and these returns were certified into a book, so that the price of bread might be adjusted to the price of the raw material, no altera- tion being allowed in the former until the latter varied at least threepence per bushel.

Our illustration is taken from the work of a market official published in 1592 ; it shows some of the stages in bread-making, each accompanied by a moral couplet more creditable to the spirit of the age than descriptive of the bakehouse practice then prevailing. At the end of the seventeenth century the wheat

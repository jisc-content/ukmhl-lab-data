Staffordshire humour on a similar subject is less extravagant. As expressed in the Darlaston man’s opinion of the goose, it is : ” The goose is a foolish bird ; it’s too much for one, and not enough for two.” Oysters are popularly supposed to aid in their own digestion, and it is to be fervently hoped such is the case, as oyster-eating has been looked upon by some people as a gastronomical accomplishment. In 1839 there appeared in Blackwood's Magazine a series of papers, “ Some Account of Himself, by the Irish Oyster-Eater ” ; and in the late “ fifties ” there died the renowned Dando, the professional oyster- eater, who was honoured by Blackwood with an epitaph in blank verse. According to the bard, Dando’s “ gustful ” appetite was hereditary, for on the mother’s side there once had been “ A Mayor of Colchester who, it was said, Married a mermaid and would sometimes eat Half his own weight of oysters in the day.”

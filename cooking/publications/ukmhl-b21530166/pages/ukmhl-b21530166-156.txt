GOOD CHEER 134 the decay of wakes and other Church-fostered orgies. Although the “ stubble goose ” of St, Martin is still eaten at Martinmas and the boar’s head at Christmas, the Reformation did away with a curiously signi- ficant Easter dish, termed “ a red herring riding away on horseback,” typical of the termination of the long Lent fasting season—it was a herring cut into the figure of a man on horseback, placed in a dish of corn salad. It was also the spread of religious toleration which removed the peculiar meaning of the mighty gammon of bacon formerly brought to table on Easter Day to commemorate the Resurrection, by expressing con- tempt and hatred of the Jews. Puritanism, a little later, exhibited a spirit that was less tolerant in the matter of the people’s dietary :— “ Plum broth was Popish, and mince-pie— Oh, that was flat idolatry.’’ It is impossible to look back on the deprivations of our forefathers without a sentiment of pity.

The breakfast of the Virgin Queen generally con- sisted of salt meat, bread, and strong ale. In her day vegetables were very little cultivated, and still less used.

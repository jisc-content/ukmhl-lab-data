ANTHROPOPHAGY 333 Triads the accusation is brought against Ethelfrith, King of England, that he encouraged cannibalism at his court, and that one Gwrgi, a truant .Welshman there, became so enamoured of human flesh that he would eat no other. It was his custom, according to this mendacious chronicle, to have a male and a female Kymry killed for his own eating every day, except Saturday, when he slaughtered two of each in order to be spared the sin of breaking the Sabbath. This detail as to the Celt’s piety gives an artistic finish to “an otherwise bald and unconvincing narra- tive.” The credibility of these statements, which occur in the third series of the Triads, is not very high. This series has no higher antiquity than the fifteenth century, and, besides Gwrgi Garwlwyd (literally the Rough Grey Dog-man), implicates others in the same charge. Cannibalism is attributed not only to the degenerate Sabbatarian, but to two other vile and renegade Britons, through whose treachery the Kymry lost their land to the Saxons—Medrawd (Modred), a rival of King Arthur ; and Aeddan, King of the Dalraiad Scots (sometimes called the Traitor of the North), who, in the year 577, fought at the Battle of Airdrie against the King of Strath- clyde, in the last great effort of Druidism to resist the advances of Christianity. It is not surprising that the same questionable authority imputes canni- balism to Ethelfrith and the Angles of Northumbria ; a Triadic statement which is very much weakened by a consideration of the fact that the memory of this Northumbrian king was justly hateful to the Welsh because of the many depredations he had committed upon them. The charge of cannibalism brought against the inhabitants of old Scotland is somewhat persistent. Andrew Wyntoun has a grisly passage in his rhyming

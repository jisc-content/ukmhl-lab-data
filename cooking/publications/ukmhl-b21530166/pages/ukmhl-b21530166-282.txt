GOOD CHEER 250 “ Such noble houses were then kept—the glory of that and shame of this present age. Then were those golden days (the reign of James I.) wherein were practised the triumphs and trophies of cookery ; then was hospitality esteemed, neighbourhood preserved, the poor cherished, and God honoured ; then was religion less talked on and more practised ; then did men strive to be good rather than to seem so.” This practical exponent of the art of cookery opens his book with a few Bills of Fare. That for a Christmas Day dinner is no doubt characteristic of the Restoration period. The repast was to begin with oysters. Next came a collar of brawn ; after that stewed broth of mutton marrow-bones ; then a grand sallet (salad), to be followed by a pottage of caponets. Either this pottage or the mutton broth may have been that old national dish of which the plum- pudding is a solid development. Plum-broth or plum-porridge, or plum-pottage as it was indifferently called, was served at the commencement of the Christmas dinner ; and May, who is evidently a Royalist, would not willingly have shown disrespect to a venerable institution which had been banned by the Roundheads. Either, therefore, he counted the plum-broth so much a matter of course as not to be worth mentioning, or one of the soups above named must have been identical with it. There were many ways of making plum-pottage, and in the Tatler, 1710, Addison observes that “no man of the most rigid virtue gives offence by an excess in plum-pudding or plum-porridge, because they are the first parts of the dinner.” The plainest recipe in the book for mutton broth includes saffron and raisins. Presently come the sirloin of beef and the mince- pies, sweetbreads, a venison pastry, and custards— one described as a custard without eggs.

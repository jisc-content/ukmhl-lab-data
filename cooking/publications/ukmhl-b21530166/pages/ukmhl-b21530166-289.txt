257 COOKERY-BOOK DIVERSIONS shall be forgiven, for my intention is to instruct the lower sort and I must treat them in their own way. But the great cooks have such a high way of expressing themselves, that the poor girls are often at a loss.” In the Preface the writer demolishes all “ those French gentry who pretend to be better cooks than Britons may be made by taking pains.” With com- mendable vigour an attack is made upon the heresy that plain English dishes taste any the better for being called by French names. Housekeeping was the serious business of life to the discreet matrons who drew their inspiration from the worthy ‘‘Mrs. Glasse ” and her compeers. Notwithstanding the positiveness of the Johnsonian theory as to the identity of ‘‘ Mrs. Glasse,” it is only right to recall that in 1858 a contributor to Notes and Queries gave an entirely different account of the disputed authorship. He writes that he has in his possession a copy of ‘‘ The Art of Cookery made Plain and Easy, &c., by a Lady, the 4th edition, &c., 1751 : London, printed for the Author, and sold at the Blue-coat Boy, near the Royal Ex- change ; at Mrs. Ashburn’s China-shop, the Corner of Fleet Ditch ; at the Leg and Dial, in Fleet Street, &c., &c.” Attached is the warning :— “ This BOOK is published with His Majesty’s Royal Licence : and whoever prints it, or any Part of it, will be prosecuted." Opposite the title (continues this contributor) is a copper-plate, surmounted by the arms of the Prince of Wales ; and the following inscription, which will at once inform us who Mrs. Glasse was :— “ Hannah Glasse, Habit Maker to Her Royal Highness the Princess of Wales, in Tavistock Street, Covent Garden. Makes and Sells all Sorts of Riding Habits, Josephs, Great-Coats, Horse- men’s Coats, Russia Coats, Hussar Coats, Bedgowns, Night Gowns, 17

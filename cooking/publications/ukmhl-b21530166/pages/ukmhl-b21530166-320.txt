GOOD CHEER 284 we all know, were as miscellaneous and promiscuous as the teeming brain of a Shakespeare could make them. In the old style of electioneering nothing was ever found so efficacious in winning support as the candi- date’s indulgence of the voters in unlimited eating and drinking. This is illustrated by Hogarth in his picture “ The Election Entertainment,” which forms the frontispiece of this book. The scene is the interior of a country inn, and in the foreground a boy is seen making punch in nothing less than a mash- tub. Though the dishes have been removed from the table, the alderman and the parson are seen still stuffing. The former, gorged with oysters, is apparently dying with one on his fork, while the barber-surgeon is vainly attempting to recover him by bleeding. The voracious divine is cramming him- self with the remains of a haunch of venison, which for the indulgence of his palate he is heating in a chafing-dish of coals, though almost fainting with the task. Other details will discover the artist’s sardonic humour in satirising man’s gross indulgence of the gluttonous propensity. A dialogue between a Glutton and his conscience was written in the seventeenth century in an ingenious form of echo ; it appeared in a Cambridge pamphlet of 1634, entitled “ Hygiasticon : or the Right Course of Preserving Life and Health into Extreme Old Age ” “ Gl. My belly do I deifie. Echo. Fie. Gl. Who curbs his appetite’s a fool. Echo. Ah fool ! Gl. I do not like this abstinence. Echo. Hence. Gl. My joy’s a feast, my wish is wine. Echo. Swine. Gl. We epicures are happie truly. Echo. You lie.

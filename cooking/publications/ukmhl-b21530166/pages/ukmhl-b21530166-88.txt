GOOD CHEER 74 feeling obliged, in point of honour, to put these senti- ments into practice, forced a few more mouthfuls of the stuff down his throat, till his stomach was so much offended that he was compelled to start up all of a sudden, and in the hurry of his elevation he over- turned his plate into the bosom of the baron. How the wretched sufferer rushed out of the room, in too great extremity to apologise ; how Peregrine followed, aided in his recovery, and undertook to make his peace with the rest of the company ; how the outraged baron, frantic with indignation, stamped and cursed as his lackey wiped the grease from his rich embroidered waistcoat must be read in the original. Peregrine, scarce hiding his suppressed merriment, managed with consummate tact to restore peace. The unhappy salacacabia being removed, the places were filled with two pies—one of dormice, liquored with the syrup of white poppies, which the doctor had substituted in the room of toasted poppy-seed, formerly eaten with honey, as a dessert ; and the other composed of a hock of pork baked in honey. The irreverent painter, upon hearing the composi- tion of the first-named, exclaimed, “ Lord in heaven 1 what beastly fellows those Romans were.” The baron imitated the example of his host, and partook of the veal, after having called for a bumper of burgundy, which the doctor wished to have been the true wine of Falemum. Pallet also had recourse to this dish, but could not refrain from declaring that he would not give one slice of the roast beef of old England for all the dainties of a Roman emperor’s table. Not a single guest could be prevailed upon to try the hashis and the goose ; and on their removal they were succeeded by divers dishes which the host told them obtained among the ancients the appellation of politeles, or magnificent.

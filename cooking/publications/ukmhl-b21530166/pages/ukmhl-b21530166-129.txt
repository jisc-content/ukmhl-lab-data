109 BARONIAL PROFUSION a fortress, surrounded by walls and ditches, was attacked by a besieging army ; there a lake was to be seen, with castles and hamlets on its borders, and boats sailing on its surface. On one table was a church with its lofty steeple and stained windows, and within it an organ and a choir of singers ; on another a mammoth pastry in which a band of twenty-eight musicians were concealed. There were besides a forest filled with wild animals of every description, a prairie enamelled with flowers, and surrounded by huge rocks of sapphires and rubies, and a moun- tain with its summit covered with ice. Each course was composed of forty-four dishes, which were placed on chariots painted in gold and azure, and were moved along the tables by concealed machinery. In the intervals of the repast a variety of uncouth monsters were introduced. It will be observed from this and other recipes dating back to the Plantagenet period that cooks in those days were almost as anxious to please the eye as the palate. Many of their best dishes were adorned with gold and silver foil, or “ flowered,” as they termed it, with various coloured powders. Among other methods of adornment, those generally used for the peacock and the swan are best known, as they invariably appeared at every royal feast. The peacock was skinned, stuffed with spices, and roasted. While the cooking was going on a cloth continually wetted was kept round the bird’s head to save it from the action of the fire. When cooked it was allowed to cool, and then the skin was neatly sewn on again, the tail feathers spread out, the comb gilt, and a piece of cloth dipped in spirits of wine placed in its mouth, to be set on fire while it was being served up at table, which was accompanied by some ceremonial. The serving was performed by the ladies most distinguished for rank and beauty.

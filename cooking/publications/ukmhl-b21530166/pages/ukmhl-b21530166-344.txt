GOOD CHEER 306 trust a Fleming with my butter than Parson Hugh the .Welshman with my cheese.” But what is the position of Scotland in the tabula^ tion of gastronomic achievements? Has the sister kingdom been maligned in the records of culinary history? The Gentleman's Magazine of 1796 quotes a work written in 1670 purporting to give “the true character ” of the people of Scotland, in which the assertion is made t^t in some parts of that country, when a feast is given, the diners “ tie up a living cow in the middle of them, near a great fire,” and then cut collops from the poor beast, and broil them on the fire, “till they have mangled her to pieces.” It is entitled a “ modern account ” ; in all prob- ability it is a grossly libellous one. According to a writer in Blackwood a century ago, no country in Europe had made less progress in the art of cooking than Scotland. Writing in 1817, he calls the Scots “ a race of foul feeders.” Among the dishes commonly met with at family dinners among the well-to-do, he mentions singed sheep’s head, tripes, and beef-steaks and onions. No doubt the truly Doric dinners of North Britain are fre- quently of a composite character, as hotch potch, haggis, sheep’s head broth, and black-puddings. If the repertory of dishes was restricted, it was due entirely to the poverty of the country. Scotland has become the “ Land o’ Cakes ” simply because its stern climate has favoured the oat above all other cereals, and the Scots have naturally acquired a 'national fondness for their oatmeal bread, preferring it to wheaten bread—it is presented at every table, in thin triangular cakes, baked on a plate of iron called a girdle. To drag in Dr. Johnson’s jeu d'esprit about their oaten food would be an insult to the reader, as its original delivery was to a virile people.

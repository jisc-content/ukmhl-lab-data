274 GOOD CHEER purpose. In all Savarin’s recipes there is a pathetic anxiety lest some ingredient should be omitted ,or ill-used. For fish he entertains a profound respect ; for game, a manly affection ; for pasties, a delicate regard ; but truffles are the beloved darlings of his heart. He evinces a profound desire to teach people what to eat and how to eat it. In his eyes the cook is a true scientist, with an infinite capacity for effect- ing good and evil. It has been said that Brillat- Savarin’s “ Physiology of Taste ” has converted a fair proportion of the reading public into gas- tronomers. The Rev. Sydney Smith was an epicure whose salad-making gained him almost as wide a reputation as his wit. He had also a rhymed recipe for roast- ing mutton, of which one verse at least is quotable :— “ Gently stir and blow the fire, Lay the mutton down to roast, Dress it quickly, I desire. In the dripping put a toast. That I hunger may remove Mutton is the meat I love.” His recipe for a winter salad, as it was originally written in an album at Castle Howard, ran in this wise :— “Two large potatoes, passed through kitchen sieve. Unwonted softness to the salad give. Of mordant mustard add a single spoon— Distrust the condiment which bites too soon— But deem it not, thou man of herbs, a fault To add a double quantity of salt. Three times the spoon with oil of Lucca crown. And once with vinegar produced from town. True flavour needs it, and your poet begs The pounded yellow of two well-boiled eggs. Let onion’s atoms lurk within the bowl. And scarce suspected, animate the whole. And lastly, on the flavoured compound toss A magic teaspoon of anchovy sauce.”

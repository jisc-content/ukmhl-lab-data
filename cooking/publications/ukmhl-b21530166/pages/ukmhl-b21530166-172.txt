150 GOOD CHEER rather finger and thumb, to each and every one of them—disposing first of venison pasty and then of Paris pie ; anon of “ rost kidd wholl,” and “ boyld carpe hot,” or else “ chines of salmon boyld ” ; then “ rost mutton with oysters,” or “ sowseed pigg/’ fol- lowed perhaps by “ sweet breade pie,” and perhaps “ marled smelts,” afterwards launching into an ocean of sweets in the shape of quince pie, candied tart, musk-pear paste, orange comfit, almond leach, and other goodies, all amid much smacking of lips and loud clattering of knives—but no sign of forks. Coryate had obtained his fork equipment from a friend, “ one Mr. Lawrence Whitaker, who in his merry humour doubted not to call me at table Furcifer, only for using a fork at feeding.” In explanation of the nickname being an object- tionable one, it may be observed that “ Furcifer ” literally meant a slave, who, for punishment of some fault, was made to carry a heavy wooden fork or gallows upon his neck through the city, with his hands tied to it ; hence the word came to signify generally a rogue, a villain. Even his intimate friend, it will be seen, derided Coryate as a finical coxcomb for his affectation of what Englishmen regarded as an effeminate inno- vation. On the stage the “ fork-carving foreigner ” came in for ridicule from Beaumont and Fletcher ; Ben Jonson also flouts him ; as thus, in “ The Devil’s an Ass,” Meercraft says to Gilthead and Sledge :— “ Have I deserved this from you ? for all My pains at Court, to get you each a patent. Gilthead. For what ? Meercraft. . . . Upon my project of the forks. Sledge. Forks ! What be they ? Meercraft. , . . The laudable use of forks, Brought into custom here as they are in Italy To the sparing of napkins.”

300 GOOD CHEER £40,000 were sold in Montreal in 1909, at the average price of is. 8d. a pound. One hotel alone in Toronto is said to sell about 1,500 lb. of frogs’ legs every year. Sir Kenelm Digby, whose cookery-book is referred to elsewhere, having resided in Spain some time, is able to give a recipe for the Spanish olla-podrida, as it was prepared in the seventeenth century. The piedium for a good plain “ Spanish oglia ” is, of course, “ a great pot ” of water which must be kept gently boiling for five or six hours, and the materials consist of a rump of beef, a loin of mutton, a piece of veal, two chickens, or else three pigeons, a piece of “ enter larded bacon,” and three or four onions. Each ingredient, beginning with the beef, and ending with the onions, must be thrown into the pot at such a time as will ensure the whole being com- pletely cooked at the same moment. About half an hour before the oglia is done a “ porrender full ” of the broth should be taken out, flavoured "with pepper, salt, five or six cloves, and a nutmeg, and then poured back again. The cookery of Spain is often unjustly disparaged, and this may be not a little owing to the number of errors which occur in the English translations of ‘‘ Don Quixote,” and which the late George Augustus Sala was at some pains to point out and correct.

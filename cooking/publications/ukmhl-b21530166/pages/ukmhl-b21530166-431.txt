ESTHETICS OF THE DINNER-TABLE 385 tion is now effected by means of table-lamps or suspended electroliers, topped with soft silk umbrella shades. The shades may vary in shape and colour, but the whole of the decorations should, of course, be brought into one well-considered scheme of colour. The subject of modern table decoration is fully discussed in an illustrated and illuminative i article in the Art Journal for 1891. While the dining-table should be broad enough I to carry everything that is necessary to its proper I equipment and adornment, it should not be too wide to make converse across it in the least degree difficult. A good dining-room chair should be substantial but portable, not cumbrous but securer; for comfort it should have a good back to give support, but free of those carved wooden ornaments which hurt the head or bore into the spine. The seat should be padded, and upholstered in leather for choice. An anecdote is related of a certain luxurious aider- man who used always, at the end of the second course, to call for “ a cold chair ” ; on his re- quirements in this direction being met, he fell to at the feast with renewed vigour and enjoyment.

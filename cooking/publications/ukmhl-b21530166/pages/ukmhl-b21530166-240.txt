GOOD CHEER 212 gravy of a roasted joint. But Yorkshire fame in the matter seems to be quite fortuitous. Lincolnshire used to indulge in a pie of eels and ox-tails. Eel- pies were not unknown on the Thames, nor herring- pies at Yarmouth. “ Cornwall squab pie, and Devon white-pot brings; And Leicester beans and bacon, food of kings.” In the Cornish squab pie fish, apples, onions, and pork are all incongruously blended. The Cornish pasty now sold in London for luncheon or supper, dishes is baked torpedo-shape, and contains pork, rabbit, beef, kidney, parsley, potatoes, onions, bacon, and other ingredients. This is incongruity. Now for inhumanity in the concoction of a delicacy. iWhen Strasbourg first became famous for its pates de foie gras, a cruel practice was resorted to for enlarging the birds’ livers at the expense of the other parts of its body. The geese were placed alive in an oven which was gradually heated until the liver attained its greatest size. This practice has long been abolished, and the birds are now closely confined to prevent their moving, while they are fed on a nourishing paste, and given sulphurated water to drink. Thus is progress marked by the refinement of cruelty. By the French the goose is little esteemed, its flesh being considered coarse and unwholesome. The livers and thighs, however, made into pies, and properly truffled—pates de foie gras— are reckoned by their gastronomers as very delicate. The department of Perigord, with Toulouse and Bayonne, used to cook annually for the rest of the world 120,000 of these “lethiferous pies.’’ Oxford, in the middle of the eighteenth century, had its well-known pastrycook, Ben Tyrrell, who was famous among the undergraduates of his day for the excellence of his mutton-pies.

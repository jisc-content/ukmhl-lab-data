GOOD CHEER 214 former, even in Shakespeare’s time, appear to have been celebrated ; for Bardolph, when accused by Slender of robbing him of his two milled sixpences, exclaims, “ You Banbury cheese ! ” This compari- son was in allusion to his thinness, the Banbury cheese being a rich milk cheese of only an inch in thickness. A local saying was of similar significance—‘‘ As thin as a Banbury cheese, nothing but paring.” There is a recipe for making Banbury Cheese in MS. Sloane, 1201. The historian of Richmond, Surrey, says that the visitor to that charming spot would make but a very incomplete pilgrimage if he did not turn into a confectioner’s shop and lunch on the delicious cheese- cakes called “ Maids of Honour,” for which the place is so famous. The cakes are said to have been so named by George II., because they were introduced to the royal table by some of the Queen’s maids of honour. In the time of George III. the tables at iWindsor and at Kew were regularly supplied with these cheese-cakes. They are now manufactured at almost all the confectioners’ shops in the town, but it is unknown where the original patent or recipe for their composition came from. A sensation was once created by a report that a thousand pounds had been given for this patent, upon which occa- sion the wits delivered themselves of the comnjent epigrammatic:— “ Some recipes are rather dearly bought, Such as quack remedies for all diseases ; Powders and pills with such rare virtue fraught That no man needs to die unless he pleases. But let us speak of him, that man of sweets. Of buns and tarts, preserves, and patties savoury. Who gives the folks at Richmond luscious treats— He really must have been a man of bravery.

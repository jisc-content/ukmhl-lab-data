334 GOOD CHEER chronicle regarding a man who was almost his con- temporary. It was about the year 1339, when Scot- land had been overrun by Edward III., and even its most fertile parts had been desolated. “ About Perth thare was the countrie Sae waste, that wonder wes to see; For intil well-great space thereby, Wes nother house left nor herb’ry. Of deer thare wes then sic foison [abundance] That they wold near come to the town. Sae great default was near that stead. That mony were in hunger dead. A carle they said- was near thereby. That wold set settis [traps] commonly. Children and women for to slay, And swains that he might over-ta ; And ate them all that he get might: Crysten Cleek till name be hight. That sa ’ry life continued he. While waste but folk was the countrie.” That garrulous chronicler, Lindsay of Pittscottie, has a still more dismal story of the reign of James II., about 1440, a time of which this historian might almost have heard from living witnesses. He says : “ About this time there was ane brigand ta’en, with his haill family, who haunted a place in Angus. This mischievous man had ane execrable fashion, to tak all young men and children he could steal away quietly, and eat them, and the younger they were, esteemed them the more tender, and delicious. For the whilk cause and damnable abuse, he with his wife and bairns were all burnt, except one young wench a year old, wha was saved and brought to Dundee where she was brought up and fostered. And when she cam to a woman’s years, she was condemned and burnt quick for that crime [her father was convicted]. When she was coming to the place of execution there gathered ane huge multi- tude—cursing her ... to whom she turned about with an ireful countenance, saying, ‘ Wherefore chide ye with me ? . . . Give me credence, and trow me, if ye had experience of eating men and women’s flesh, ye wold think it so delicious that ye wold never forbear it again.”

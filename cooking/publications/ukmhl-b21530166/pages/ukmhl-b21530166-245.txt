217 FAMOUS LOCAL COMESTIBLES At Christmas-time Shrewsbury shops are still redolent with the sweetness of Simnels, their shells of paste tinged with saffron, looking like golden caskets full of fruity richness. At the same season of the year the display of “ Christmas brawn ” shows that the Salopian capital also continues to uphold its reputation in this direction. The Shrewsbury cake is a lineal descendant of the ancient Simnel cake, and was once sold in great quantities to the thousands of visitors which the race- meetings attracted. The poet Shenstone speaks of this delicious sweet-cake “ rend’ring through Britain’s isle Salopian praises known.” A famous maker of the delicacy was one Pailin. “Oh, Pailin 1 prince of cake-compounders ! the mouth liquefies at thy very name I ” exclaims the enthusiastic admirer. And as we may read in “ Ingoldsby ”— “ She gave him a roll and a bun And a Shrewsbury cake Of Pailin’s own make.” The Shrewsbury cake is a very superior kind of “ shortbread.” Chelsea was famous for its buns two centuries ago. Swift, in his “Journal to Stella,” 1712, writes :— “ Pray are not the buns sold here in our town as the rare Chelsea buns ? ” It was for many years the custom of the Royal Family, the nobility, and the gentry to patronise the Bun House in the morning. George II. and Queen Caroline and the princesses often paid visits, and so did George III. and Queen Charlotte. The last-named presented the proprietress, Mrs. Hand, with a large silver mug.

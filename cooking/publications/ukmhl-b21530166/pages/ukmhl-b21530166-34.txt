GOOD CHEER 28 The refuse-heaps upon which he cast the bones of his victims now form immense deposits ; all these bones are split, indicating that he found a tasty as well as a highly nourishing food in the marrow ; and these split bones are invariably intermixed with layers of charcoal, and stones bearing the marks of fire. The animals which furnished forth his ban- quets included the reindeer, the bison, the horse, and other wild animals that apparently roamed about in vast herds ; and judging by the bone deposits, these cave-dwellers could have suffered from no shortness of the food supply—in one bed have been found the remains of not less than forty thousand horses. What visions are here presented of prehistoric feast- ings, of ravenous hunters lighting their fires at the close of the hunt, and spending the declining hours of the day in noisy revellings within the rocky re- cesses of the forest primeval. It may be presumed that, as a general rule, the hunting of food provides but precarious feeding. The savage hunter, like the beast of prey, must have a stomach that adjusts itself to these conditions—to voracious gorging in times of plenty, to the suste- nance of prolonged fastings when the hunt proves fruitless. It is by no means impossible that the primitive savage fed but once a day. This practice prevailed even among civilised people within the historic period. In the war of Xerxes against Greece it was pleasantly said of the Abderites, who were burdened with pro- viding for the king’s table, that they ought to thank the gods for not inclining Xerxes to eat twice a day. Plato held the Sicilians to be gluttons for having two meals every day. Even in medieval times the bulk of the English people seldom exceeded two meals a day. Many feeding times per diem are unhygienic and unnecessary.

259 COOKERY-BOOK DIVERSIONS substitute for capers ; they pickled radish-pods, horse-radish, young artichokes, samphire, and even marigolds. Having pickled every green shoot, pod, and seed they could adapt to their purpose, they began to do the same by plums, apricots, peaches, currants, and grapes—when they set about making jams no fruit escaped them, and sometimes not the vegetables. When they made cakes it was the same. They could make tarts with sorrel. Parsnips and rasp- berries were made into cakes ; red beetroot, potatoes, and oranges were converted into biscuits. The old recipe for violet cakes is worth quoting ;— "Take the finest violets you can get, pick off the leaves, beat the violets fine in a mortar with the juice of a lemon, beat and sift twice their weight of double-refined sugar, pour your sugar and violets into a silver saucepan or tankard, set it over a slow fire, keep stirring it gently until all your sugar is dissolved; if you let it boil it will discolour your violets; drop them in china plates; when you take them off put them in a box, with paper between every layer.” And very charming and ethereal the result must have been. Our great-great-grandmothers were all women who had “ shaken hands with a saucepan.” With them wine-making was a recognised branch of female industry. They could make it from dandelions, elderberries, cowslips, rhubarb, currants, parsnips, or from almost anything they chose—these models of domesticity produced, when put to it, sycamore, birch, walnut, blackberry, and balm wines. "In her very style of looking There was cognisance of cooking ! From her very dress were peeping Indications of house-keeping.” The housewife of the period was as immersed in domesticity as were the herbs and flowers she drowned in teas and decoctions.

GOOD CHEER 26 though not of the same school, have asserted that the first man was created in the autumn, when all the fruits were ripe, so that there was no immediate necessity for Mother Eve to commence culinary operations until some knowledge had been acquired of the nature and capabilities of earth’s multifarious productions. Anterior to man’s use of flesh food came, it is reasonable to suppose, his discovery of fire ; for not being naturally a carnivorous animal, man cooked his food to make it more palatable and more diges- tible. Man is the only animal that cooks its food. In “ Signor Resartus ” Carlyle challenges the French definition of man as a “cooking animal,” though he produces but few examples to prove the contrary.

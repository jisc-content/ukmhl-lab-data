247 COOKERY-BOOK DIVERSIONS leaves and root, red Mints, of each a handful; bruise these hearbs and put them in a great earlhern pot, and pour on them enough White Wine as wil cover them, stop them close, and let them steep for eight or nine days; then put to it Cinnamon, Ginger, Angelica-seeds, Cloves, and Nuttmegs, of each an ounce, a little Saffron, Sugar one pound, Raysins soils stoned one pound. Dates stoned and sliced half a pound, the loyns and tegs of an old Coney, a fleshy running Capon, the red flesh of the sinews of a leg of Mutton, four young Chickens, twelve larks, the yolks of twelve Eggs, a Loaf of White bread, cut in sops; and two or three ounces of Mithridate or Treacle, and as much Muscadine as will cover them all. Distil al with a moderate fire, and keep the first and second waters by themselves; and when there comes no more by distilling put more Wine into the pot upon the same stuffe and distil it again, and you shall have another good water.” .We can well believe that “ this water strengtheneth the Spirit, Brain, Heart, Liver, and stomack,” especially as we are to take it “ when need is by itself, or with Ale, Beer, or Wine mingled with Sugar.’* The confection “ mithridate ” enters into many of the medicines. It was supposed to have been the cure-all of King Mithridates, and was apparently regarded as a soporific. To compound it forty-five different ingredients were required, among them treacle-mustard, camels’ hay, and the bellies of skinks ; yet when Pompey found this precious recipe it was simple enough :— “ Pound with care two walnuts, two dried figs, twenty pounds of rice, and a grain of salt.” The natural comment to make upon this is, obviously, that we take it with a grain of salt. In the second part of the book, among other “ incomparable secrets ” by “ the Most Experienced Persons of the Times,” are recipes for two royal perfumes, one by Edward VI. and the other by Queen Elizabeth.

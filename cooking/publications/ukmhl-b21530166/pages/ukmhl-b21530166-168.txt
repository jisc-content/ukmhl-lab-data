146 GOOD CHEER was done. At Oxford and Cambridge the students dined at eleven. Cromwell surpassed all previous rulers of England by dining after noon, at half-past one. But hours were still primitively early, according to modern ideas, even in the luxurious age of Charles II. Mer- chants were at their desks by six or seven, for Pepys was not alone in getting down to his office by four or five o’clock. The House of Commons met at nine, and its business was over soon after noon. The theatres opened at three, and sent their audiences away to supper at seven. Under Anne the fashionable world did not bestir itself before nine, from which hour to eleven great men held their levees. Dinner was at two o’clock, and the gentlemen tarried at the table until six, whence they went to the play. The day was grow- ing rapidly later. Five o’clock was the fashionable hour for dinner in 1750, though the King remained faithful to his practice of dining at two. The post- ponement of dinner until well after noon brought breakfast into prominence. At the best it had hitherto been a draught of ale—afterwards tea or chocolate—and bread and butter and radishes. To- wards the end of the eighteenth century breakfast parties began to be given at noon, and the pro- vision of fish and cold meats at this meal created great surprise.

NATIONAL FOODS AND PREJUDICES 311 buildings, called a “ bothie.” One of the women made their beds, and they cooked their own food, which was usually “ brose.” This primitive food was made of raw oatmeal, ,with boiling water poured over it, and occasionally, perchance, a bit of salt butter mixed with it. With this they had a good allowance of milk from the dairy. But as the human stomach is not fitted to digest raw oat- meal, while this evil system was in vogue plough- men were generally found to be a short-lived class. Another ploughman’s dish, common to Scotland and Northumberland, was Sowens. Sowens were made of the coarse ■’seeds sifted out of the oatmeal, put into a tiilD, covered with water, and allowed to stand till the mash turned sour. It was then taken out and boiled to a jelly-like substance which was sapped with milk. A story is told of a newly- engaged Peebles ploughman, at the end of his first day’s work, finding his way to the kitchen when no one was present, and where the week’s supply of sowens, prepared in advance for his feeding, was disposed about the place in a number of bowls and pans. Going from one receptacle to another, he dis- patched every sowen to the last of the series ; after which he coolly remarked to the maid, who entered at that moment, “ Lass, I wish you would to-morrow night make my sowens all in one dish, and not in drippocks and drappocks that way I ” If America has a national dish, it is the favourite pork and beans of the New England States, which patriotic Americans order at the hotels and restaurants as “ Stars and Stripes.”

NATIONAL FOODS AND PREJUDICES 309 As to the steak and onions which our “ superior ’’ critic contemns, it is one of Scotia’s favourite dishes, and as cooked there is appetising enough to make the mouth of a mummy water. The steak must be cut from the rump of a polled Angus bullock or from a prime Highland stot ; it is cooked, with the onions, on a brander (or gridiron) ; and to achieve perfection (as the Scottish housewife said to her expectant visitor, who was awaiting the results of her efforts), “ you must have your fire as hot as hell, and turn eternally.” ' But Caledonia’s greatest and most characteristic triumph in culinary science is the haggis, which is made in this wise. One of the stomachs of a sheep (the paunch), that into which the oesophagus opens, is cut off from the others, and thoroughly cleaned to whiteness. It is a bag with a small mouth. The heart, lungs, and liver of the sheep ’are minced small and put into the bag, mixed with minced suet, onions, salt, pepper, and some toasted oatmeal. The orifice is then closed and the bag with its contents boiled. Properly made, it is excellent ; badly prepared, it is nauseous. Burns’s poem ‘‘ To a Haggis ” begins :— “ Fair fa’ your honest sonsie face, Great chieftain o’ the puddin’ race ! Aboon them a’ ye tak’ your place, Painch, tripe, or thairm ; Weel are ye wordy of a grace As lang’s my arm.” And so the immortal Scotsman sings its praises over French ragout, olio, fricass^e^ and every other dish in the world, declaring that “Auld Scotland wants nae skinking ware That jaups in luggies; But, if ye wish her gratefu’ prayer, Gie her a haggis ! ”

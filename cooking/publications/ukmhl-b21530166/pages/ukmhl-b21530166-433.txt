AT THE FESTIVE BOARD 387 guest, the ceremony of grace is more honoured in the breach than the observance. The germ of the modern grace, says the Gentle Elia, had its origin in the early times of the world and the hunter state of man, when dinners were precarious things, and a full meal was something more than a common blessing—when a bellyful was a windfall that looked like a special providence to be hailed by jubilation and songs of triumph. The jubilant has become the reverent and the devotional. In some houses where the grace is as indispensable as the napkin it is not always quite settled who is to say it, the good man of the house or the youngest child, the visitor clergyman or some other guest of gravity and authority, or some person to be called upon—an unseasonable uncertainty which gives the prelude to the meal an unbecoming awkwardness. The devout Robbie Burns, who has left us enduring examples of his rhymed expressions of gratitude, was neat at an impromptu grace when called upon. In the more recent past, when it was customary [ never to neglect this form of revererkce, even at ! semi-private dinners, a diner-out who was a bit of 1 a wag, when importuned for a grace, used to inquire, first slyly leering down the table, “ Is there no I clergyman here?” significantly adding, “Thank The serving of a meal is next in importance to I the cooking of it. The old-time custom of honour- i ing some of the chief joints w/ith a procession had something to recommend it. But the same cannot ! be said for that piece of extravagant magnificence , which marked the coronation feasts of the ancient I kings of France, the newly crowned, when seated at ! the table, being served by his nobility on horseback. n i V \ j i I God 1 ” “They also serve who only stand and wait,” saith Milton.

GOOD CHEER 292 more acceptable than that produced on the rich pastures of the Vale Royal of England, where it was once the custom to mould it into the form of a cat, whence the term “ Cheshire Cat.” But there are probably varieties of cheese sufficient to meet every variety of taste. The aristocratic Stilton is made with all the cream in the milk ; Cheddar and Double Gloucester with new milk from which a part of the cream has been removed. Single Gloucester is made from skim-milk, like the Gouda cheese, with delicate transparent shavings of which the Dutch make such palatable sandwiches. The rich cheese of Gorgonzola is made from ewe’s milk, at the village of that name, near Milan ; and the spongy, strong- flavoured Gruy^re is the product of goat’s milk from the pastures of the high Alps. But the peculiar qualities and particular virtues of all the famous makes are best seen in the French “ Ode to Cheese ” of M. Thomas Braun, so admirably Englished by Mr. J. Bithell :— “God of the country, bless to-day Thy cheese, For which we give Thee thanks on bended knees. Let them be fat or light, with onions blent, Shallots, brine, pepper, honey; whether scent Of sheep or fields is in them, in the yard Let them, good Lord, at dawn be beaten hard ? And let their edges take on silvery shades Under the most red hands of dairymaids; And, round and greenish, let them go to town Weighing the shepherd’s folding mantle down ; Whether from Parma or from Jura heights. Kneaded by august hands of Carmelites, Stamped with the mitre of a proud abbess. Flowered with the perfumes of the grass of Bresse, From hollow Holland, from the Vosges, from Brie, From Roquefort, Gorgonzola, Italy ! Bless them, good Lord ! Bless Stilton’s royal fare. Red Cheshire, and the tearful, cream Gruyere !

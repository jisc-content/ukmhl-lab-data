THE DIETARY OF THE SCRIPTURES 41 feast to celebrate the return of the Prodigal Son was primarily to include “ the fatted calf.” The dish which was presented by Abraham to the angels on the plains of Mamre is identical with that which to this day is presented by the Arabs of Morocco to their more distinguished guests—a shoulder of veal well roasted, and covered with butter and milk. How plain was the food of the patriarchs appears from the pottage of lentils and bread which Jacob had prepared, and which Esau so coveted that he sold his birthright for it. Tradition hath it that the learned Rabbi El Bassam, the celebrated Jewish commentator on the Talmud, spent fifteen years in vainly trying to discover the name of the cook who prepared this wonderful pottage for which the reck- less and impatient Esau sold all his rights of primo- geniture. The rabbinical story bearing upon the bartering away of Esau’s birthright is to this effect : And it came to pass that Esau went hunting in the field upon a certain day when Nimrod, King of Babel, was also engaged in the same pursuit. A rivalry existed between these two mighty hunters which amounted to a deadly jealousy ; and Esau happening upon Nimrod when all but two of his attendants had left him, he concealed himself. When presently Nimrod passed his hiding-place, Esau pointed his arrow, pulled his bow, and shot his rival through the heart. Then rushing forth from his concealment, Esau engaged in a deadly struggle with the two attendants, overcame them, and killed them both. Stripping from Nimrod’s shoulders the wonderful coat which God had made for Adam, Esau hastened home, reach- ing his father’s dwelling-place weary, hungry, and faint. It was then Esau said to Jacob, ” Give me of that red pottage, for I am faint.” And Jacob said.

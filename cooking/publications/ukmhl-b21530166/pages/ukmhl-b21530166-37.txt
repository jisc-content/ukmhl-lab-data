31 CULINARY ART agriculture, and says that in the Golden Age man was “ Pleased with earth’s unbought feasts; all ills removed, Wealthy in flocks, and the Blest beloved, Death, as a slumber, pressed their eyelids down, All Nature’s common blessings were their own. The life-bestowing tilth its fruitage bore, A full, spontaneous, and ungrudging store.” Here, as in the Jewish theology, according to the Book of Genesis, there is the apparent contradiction of the co-existence of “ flocks and herds ” with a prevalence of a non-flesh diet. The second race of man, in the Silver Age, were also supposed to have been equally guiltless of blood- shed in the preparation of food. The ancient poets agreed, when painting the fabled past, in presenting the fictitious age of innocence in this particular light. It was reserved for the third or Brazen Age to in- augurate a flesh diet, "Strong with the ashen spear, and fierce and bold, Their thoughts were bent on violence alone. The deed of battle and the dying groan, Bloody their feasts, with wheaten food unblest.” As to the “ immortals inhabiting the Olympian mansions,” according to Hesiod and the poets who followed him, they fed ever on the pure and blood- less food of ambrosia, and drank only of nectar, a distillation of refined dew. It has long been contended that antediluvian man was strictly vegetarian. Similarly, the Pythagorean system of ancient Greece is said to have forbidden indulgence in all animal food. The poet of modern vegetarianism tells us that Pythagoras borrowed his dietary principles from the Hindoos. “ He first the taste of flesh from tables drove And argued well, if arguments could move : O mortals ! from your fellows’ blood abstain Nor taint your bodies with a food profane.”

GOOD CHEER 198 The Christmas roast goose seems to have been once a goose-pie, for Allan Ramsay writes :— “Ay at yule whene’er they came A braw goose-pie.’’ Formerly more honour was done to the goose at Martinmas and at Michaelmas than at Christmas, when it was baked in a “ pye ” by the rich, for distribution to their poor neighbours. The ancient ceremonial dish at the Christmas feast was the boar’s head, a course served roasted or boiled, on a platter decorated with laurel-leaves and brought to table in a procession. Its advent was greeted by the company in a beautiful carol, a ceremony still kept up at Queen’s College, Oxford, and which has come down from the time when wild boars were to be found near that ancient University city. The carol runs :— “ The boar’s head in hand bear I, Bedeck’d with bays and rosemary ; And I pray you, my masters, be merry, Quot estit in convivio. Caput Apri defero Reddens laudes Domino. The boar’s-head, as I understand. Is the rarest dish in all this land, Which thus bedeck’d with a gay garland Let us servire cantico. Caput Apri defero Reddens laudes Domino. Our steward hath provided this In honour of the King of Bliss, Which on this day to be serv’d is In reginensi atrio Caput Apri defero Reddens laudes Domino.’’

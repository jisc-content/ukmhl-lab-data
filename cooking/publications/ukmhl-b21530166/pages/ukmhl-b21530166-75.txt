63 THE FOODS OF THE ANCIENTS served thenceforth to crown victory, or to give rise to the sweet hopes of peace. A green bough of olive rendered the suppliant inviolable. From its wood were made the arrows of Hercules, the sceptres of princes, and the crooks of shepherds. Among the Jews, the most important culture was that of the olive-tree. They not only used the olives to make oil, they also preserved them in brine to be eaten at tables. In ancient Rome olives made their appearance in the first course, and sometimes they were served again after the repast, with the dessert. Olives used as hors dâ€™ceiivres clear the palate. Three varieties are now in use, Italian, French, and Spanish ; those imported from Spain are the largest and most esteemed. Olive-oil largely takes the place of butter in the warmer countries of Europe. The Roman partiality for oil in their cooking still remains with the modem Italian. Here our catalogue must terminate. Though the list is by no means exhausted, it probably includes the chief vegetable foodstuffs which have been been longest, and still remain, in the service of civilised man. In conclusion, it is significant to note that man, at quite an early period of his civilisation, succumbed to the disorders of the alimentary system ; for we find the ancient Greeks eating ripe blackberries under the impression that they were a sovereign preventive of gout.

135 A PERIOD OF CHANGE The choice “ vianders ” of the fourteenth century paid epicurean prices for delicious morsels of the whale, the porpoise, the grampus, and the sea-wolf. In the British Museum is an ancient manuscript recipe for making “ puddynge of porpoise,” a dish served at the royal table as late as the time of Henry VIII. The ballad of “ London Lyckpenny,” written about 1430, a century before the Reformation, mentions among the common provisions in the fifteenth century, “ stokfish, salt fische, whyt herring, rede herring, salt salmon, salt sturgeon, salt eels,” &c. The eel was always a favourite fish in the monasteries. iWith the Tudor period came the stirring age of discovery ; and with the finding of new lands, and a freer intercommunication with old ones, came the discovery of new foodstuffs. The year 1520 is sup- posed to be that which is so famously remembered in the old rhyme :— “Turkeys, carp, hops, and beer Came into England all in one year.” Turkeys came from Mexico, and the first one eaten in France was at the marriage of Charles IX. in 1571- In the fifteenth and early sixteenth century sugar and spices had to be imported from' Venice. As to prices, at the great Adriatic port in 1505, pepper was worth i8| gros the pound, and ginger from Alexandria 24 gros, 76 gros being equal to the ducat in Antwerp. Commerce and free communication had not as yet opened up the resources and markets of the world, so that in times of festivity a rude abun- dance, drawn mainly from home supplies and adjacent waters, had to suffice—the produce of the farmyard and the poultry-yard, the forest and the fen, the columbarium and the fish-stew.

339 ANTHROPOPHAGY told. It was delivered to the warrior who had taken him in battle, and by him, after being dressed, was served up in an entertainment to his friends. This was not the coarse repast of famished canni- bals, but a banquet teeming with delicious beverages and delicate viands, prepared with art, and attended by both sexes, who, as we shall see hereafter, conducted themselves with all the decorum of civilised life. Surely never were refinement and the extreme of barbarism brought so closely into contact with each other.‚Äù In another passage Prescott depicts the sumptuous- ness and magnificent scale upon which the Aztecs gave their repasts, enumerating among the dishes they served meat, game, turkeys, vegetables of various kinds, and no stint of delicious fruits. The tables were ornamented with vases of silver and of gold, all of the most delicate workmanship. The drinking cups and spoons were of the same costly material, or of tortoiseshell. Their favourite bever- age was chocolate, flavoured with vanilla and spices. They kept their meats warm with chafing dishes. Yet with all these accessories and refinements this people indulged in cannibalism in the form of an epicurean science. Indeed, one veracious chronicler of the Spanish Conquest mentions a fricassee or stew of little children, in which he vouches the Aztec Emperor sometimes indulged himself. Sir Stamford Raffles has recorded that the Battas of Sumatra are habitual cannibals, which he thinks is the more extraordinary as they acknowledge a Supreme Being. Their laws regulate the eating of criminals and prisoners of war. This form of death is inflicted for adultery, midnight robbery, and treacherous attacks on a person, a house, or a village. The criminal, or prisoner, as the case may be, is tied to a stake and eaten alive, each person cutting off a slice according to taste or fancy, until all the flesh is devoured. Of all eating customs known this is pre-eminently the most revolting.

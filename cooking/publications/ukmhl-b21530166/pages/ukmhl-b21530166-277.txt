COOKERY-BOOK DIVERSIONS 245 yet attained the age of eighty-two ; the jolly physician dying at his own house at Chelsea, in 1655, after having drunk some bad wine at a Strand tavern. He often participated in the hospitalities of the Lord Mayor, and his cookery-book is allowed to be the best of its day, for Sir Theodore Mayerne could dress a dinner as well as he could cure a disease. Tobias Venner, already mentioned (p. 238), like other writers on culinary subjects, was a physician, and he goes minutely into the alimentary values of food. He held the opinion that any rough food would do for “ hinds ”—bull beef for ploughmen, if they could get it—but he distinctly thought that the flesh of partridges should not be eaten by “ the common sort,” because it was likely to “ breed in them the asthmatick passion.” The worthy doctor was himself a man of refined taste, and designed an msthetic little meal, of brief but chaste simplicity—it was ‘‘ a couple of poached eggs, sprinkled with vinegar, seasoned with black pepper and salt, served with bread-and-butter, and completed with a draught of pure claret.” The conjunction of medicine and cookery is exemplified again in an admirable little volume pub- lished in 1656. It is in three parts. First, ‘‘The Queen’s Closet Opened, or The Pearl of Practise ; Accurate Physical and Chirurgical Receipts.” Second, ‘‘ A Queen’s Delight, or The Art of Preserving, Conserving, and Candying, as also a Right Knowledge of Making Perfumes, and Dis- tilling the Most Excellent Waters.” Third, ‘‘ The Compleat Cook, Expertly Prescribing the most ready wayes, whether Italian, Spanish, or French, For Dressing of Flesh and Fish, Ordering of Sauces, or making of Pastry.” The Queen to whom this work was dedicated, or rather for whom it was supposed to be prepared.

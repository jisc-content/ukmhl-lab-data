154 GOOD CHEER kept a carver, whose duty was to cut up the meat with a richly ornamented knife according to certain prescribed rules. Bread was broken, never cut. Juvenal, in describing the stale, dried bread which a churlish host served to his poor relations, while regaling his grand visitors with the baker’s newest, sweetest, and best, does not say it could not be cut, but that it could not be broken :— “Mark with what scorn that other deals your stint Of bread in mouldy fragments hard as flint; Fragments your lab’ring grinders cannot bite ; But your lord’s bread, how fair, how fine, how white ! ” In Ovid’s “ Art of Love ” there is a couplet in which the poet, addressing a lady, lays down a rule as to the polite manner of picking her food with her fingers—not with a fork. Among the Roman remains found in England are instruments supposed to have been used as forks—as in the museum of Mr. Roach Smith, for instance—but the rarity of the examples, as compared with knives and spoons, makes the surmise doubtful. Spoons of different shapes and sizes have been frequently found, and Mr. Smith had also a Roman steel for sharpen- ing knives, very similar to those in use by butchers at the present day, even to the ring on the end of the handle for suspending it to the girdle. “ This Vulcan was a smith, they tell us. That first invented tongs and bellows; For breath and fingers did their works— We’d fingers long before we’d forks.” Athenasus mentions the word “fork,” but it does not appear whether it was a bident (with two prongs), or a trident (with three prongs), but it is certain that the Greeks were ignorant of the use of forks for eating—and even Lucullus was not acquainted with such a luxury.

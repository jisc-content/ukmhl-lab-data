GOOD CHEER 108 mortar. A helpful glossary to “ The Forme of Cury ” was compiled by Dr. Pegge. In the ancient accounts of great English enter- tainments mention is invariably made of “ sotelties.” These were devices in sugar and pastry, which not only added magnificence to the table, but often dis- played the witty invention of the cook. Thus when the conquering Henry V. brought home his French bride, Catherine, the soteltie at the first course of her coronation banquet represented a pelican sitting on its nest, and an image of St. Catherine, bearing a scroll on which appeared : “ It is the King’s wish that all his people shall be merry, and in this manner he publishes his intentions.” At the second course the soteltie represented a panther with St. Catherine on her Wheel, and bore the motto, “ The Queen, my child, shall meet with deserved renown on this island.” The soteltie in the third course represented St. Catherine and angels, with the motto, “It is written, as is heard and seen, that by a sacred marriage war shall be terminated.” All the courses at great feastings were accompanied and adorned by these sotelties (otherwise “ subtle- ties ”), figures in jellies, sweets, or confectioneries of some sort ; artistic mouldings of human or animal groups, or of buildings and scenery, often repre- senting some legend or historical event, and each having a label attached to it containing some wise or witty saying appropriate to the design. A gorgeous effort was made at a dinner given in 1454 by Philip the Good, father of Charles the Bold of Burgundy.

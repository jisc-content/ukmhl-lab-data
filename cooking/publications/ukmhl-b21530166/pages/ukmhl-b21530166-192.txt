GOOD CHEER 170 obtain many curious peeps into the past, none of them more interesting and informative than those bearing upon the dietary of the period. Let us sample a few more. “6 June i66i.—We stayed talking and singing and drinking great draughts of claret, and eating botargo and bread and butter till twelve at night.” Botargo was a sausage made of eggs and of the blood of a red mullet. “3 Nov. 1661.—At night, my wife and I had a good supper by ourselves of a pullet hashed, which pleased rtie much to see my condition come to allow ourselves a dish like that.” The Diarist also mentions turkeys in several places ; he seems to have dined upon them often. “ I Dec. i66i.—Cut a brave coller of brawn from Winchcomb, which proves very good, and also opened a glass of girkins which Captain Cock gave my wife the other day, which are rare things.” The cucumber was introduced into England from the Netherlands about 1538; no doubt pickled gherkins were “ rare things ” in Pepys’ time. “6 Jan. 1662.—To dinner to Sir Wm. Pens, it being a solemn feast day with him—his wedding day, and we had, besides a good chine of beef, and other good cheer, eighteen mince pies in a dish, the number of years that he had been married.'' Truly this was rather a pretty idea for celebrating a wedding feast while the Christmas pies were in season. “ 26 March 1662.—I had a pretty dinner for [the company] ; viz. a brace of stewed carps, six roasted chickens, and a jowl of salmon, hot, for the first course ; a tanzy, and two neat’s tongues, and cheese, the second.”

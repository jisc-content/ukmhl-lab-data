200 GOOD CHEER Foote), left by will money to provide cake and wine for the performers in the green-room of Drury Lane Theatre on Twelfth Night. Formerly, in London, the confectioners’ shops on this day were filled with twelfth cakes, which ranged in price from a few shillings to several guineas. Some of them were huge things, and all were highly decorated. In far- away times the people “ censed ” the twelfth cake as a charm against sickness and witchcraft throughout the year. “ Eche maister in his house doth burne franckensence and on the table settes a loafe ” for “ safetie all the yeare.” The long Lenten fast was ushered in by a hearty indulgence in pancakes upon the Shrove Tuesday. Several child-rhymes celebrate the delights of this dainty, or associate it with its ecclesiastical origin — “The pancakes made of milk and beer Are made for no one present here; There’s one for Peter, two for Paul, And three for Him who made us all.” The allusion here is to the superstition which induced the cook to set aside the first three as sacred. The rhyme with which schoolboys welcomed the “ pancake bell,” which was rung from the church steeple at noontide, varied according to circum- stances. One version ran ;— “ Pancakes and fritters Say the bells of St. Peter’s” ; though the variant of more universal application was :— “ Pan on, pan on. Pull the big one off, put the little one on ! Pan on, pan on !

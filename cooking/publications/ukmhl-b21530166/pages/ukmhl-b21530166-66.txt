54 GOOD CHEER posed to cut the fish in pieces. This advice was rejected. After much deliberation it was resolved that a proper utensil should be made for the purpose ; and it was decided that whenever the Emperor went to war a great number of potters should accompany him. The most pleasing part of the story is that a blind senator seemed in perfect ecstasy at the turbot, by continually praising it, at the same time turning in the very opposite direction. Then there was the Emperor Heliogabalus, whose reign was characterised by acts of fantastic folly and bestial excesses, the particulars of which almost transcend the limits of credibility. On one occasion he had the heads of six hundred ostriches brought to his table, only to eat their brains. Camel’s flesh was served at his banquets, and camel’s feet he con- sidered a great delicacy. On one occasion Heliogabalus regaled twelve of his friends in a manner scarcely to be credited : he gave to each guest animals of the same species as those he served them to eat ; he insisted upon their carry- ing away all the vases or cups of gold, silver, and precious stones out of which they had drunk ; and it is remarkable that he supplied each with a new one every time he asked to drink. He placed on the head of each a crown interwoven with green foliage, and gave each a superbly ornamented and well-yoked car to return home in. He rarely ate fish but when he was near the sea ; and when he was at a distance from it he had his fish served up with sea-water. It must not be thought that these solecisms of luxury were characteristic of Roman society, even in its most luxurious period. The feasts of Nero and Heliogabalus were not typical of Imperial Rome— they were the exaggerations and excesses of eccen- trics, and were, no doubt, strongly disapproved of by their contemporaries.

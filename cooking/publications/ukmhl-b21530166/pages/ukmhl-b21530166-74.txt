GOOD CHEER 62 instincts of pigs, or by trained dogs. In the sandy soils of South-west France truffles vegetate at a depth of five or six inches—Perigueux and Carpentras are the most famous districts. The Emperor Claudius had a strong predilection for mushrooms : he was poisoned with them, by Agrippina, his niece and fourth wife ; but as the poison only made him sick, he sent for Xenophon, his physician, who, pretending to give him one of the emetics he commonly used after debauches, caused a poisoned feather to be passed into his throat. Nero used to call mushrooms the relish of the gods, because Claudius, his predecessor, having been, as was supposed, poisoned by them, was, after his death, ranked among the gods. To Mithridates, King of Pontus, of toxologic memory, and better known by physicians than gardeners, we owe the delights of the sweet cherry. This ancient king and philosopher did not pass the whole of his time in composing poisons and their antidotes ; for with his own royal hands he planted, and sometimes grafted, this useful fruit-tree. Three hundred years before the Christian era the cultivated cherry passed from Lower Asia into Greece. This fruit enriched the second course in Athens and the third in Rome ; the ancients appreciated it more highly than we do nowadays. Pliny credits Lucullus with bringing the cherry into Italy about seventy years before the Christian era, and the Romans introduced it into Britain. The name “ cherry,” or “ cerise,” is derived from that of the town Cerasus, in Asia Minor, where it is supposed to have been first cultivated. Throughout antiquity the olive was regarded as venerable, and, of all useful fruits, the most nourishing. The wise Minerva gave it birth ; and its foliage, which adorned the brows of the goddess.

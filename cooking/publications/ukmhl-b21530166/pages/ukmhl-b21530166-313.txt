EPICURES 277 knows, likes and dislikes ; children are often “ faddy ” in this respect. Tastes and distastes are as diverse as they are inexplicable. Then there is—as distinct from epicurism—such a thing as fastidiousness in eating. It is given as a sample of Beau Brummell’s wit—really, it savours more of impertinence—that when asked why he had not married a certain lady to whom he had been attentive, his elegancy replied, “ My dear fellow, the thing was impossible. What could I do? I found that she actually ate cabbage ! ” Besides those who live to eat, there are those who merely eat to live—the reluctant eaters. They stoke. They do not eat, because they do not really enjoy their food. As Montaigne has said, “ They do not eat, but only swallow.” That highly convenient foitn of eating, the portable meal known as the sandwich, was invented by, and named after, the fourth Earl of Sandwich. This notorious nobleman, who flourished in the eighteenth century, was so devoted to the gaming table that he would never rise willingly from it, even to go to dinner. So he devised this form of eating which he could indulge in while he continued his play. There are many kinds of sandwiches, from the delicate fish and salad variety to the notorious leather and sawdust contrivance of the railway refreshment stall. The recipe for a substantial Scottish sand- wich is to make it of beef, cut from the round, well mustarded, the fat to be only round the edges ; the thickness of the whole should be three half-inches, the middle layer the thinnest of the three, in a pepper- and-salt coat—“ and confound the crust,” says the oracle. The accompanying lesson in the eating of such a sandwich recommends the eater to open his mouth like a gentleman, “ wide without gaping,” and then perform ‘‘ a civilised swallow, rather than a barbarous bolt.”

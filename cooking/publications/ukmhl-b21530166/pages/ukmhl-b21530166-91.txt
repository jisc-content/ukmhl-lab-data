77 A ROMAN BANQUET And so the learned physician descanted at large while the champagne was gradually wiping out the recollection of the contretemps which had marked his ill-starred attempt to revive the culinary triumphs of ancient Rome. Let it be borne in mind that Tobias Smollett was himself a Doctor of Medicine. And it is quite apparent that he had studied Apicius, for his descrip- tion of the dish of sow’s stomach—which, by the way, we now eat, when properly boiled, as chitterlings—is according to the true Apician method, though it is to be feared the novelist works out the idea with a somewhat farcical extravagance. And it should not be overlooked that cookery was formerly regarded as the best form of medicine ; hence the frequent use in olden times of medicinal plants as pot-herbs, judiciously selected and blended, as they were astringent or purgative, or possessed of other corrective virtues. It must have required a Spartan stomach, however, to have tolerated the employment in culinary matters, as the Romans did, of that ultra- fetid gum, asafoetida. The moral of Smollett’s laughable account of the exploits of his culinary sage seems to be that “ too many cooks spoil the broth.”

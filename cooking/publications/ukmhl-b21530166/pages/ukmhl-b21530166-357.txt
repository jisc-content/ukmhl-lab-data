DIET AND NATIONAL CHARACTER 317 “ divine particle ” in man cannot resist, in the long run, the earthly influences of starch-producing roots taken as a chief article of diet. For to this we must come, if there be more than partial truth in the exhortations of Mulder. Meat makes the man, he says ; or if not this, at least, that you cannot keep the man up to the true pitch of his being unless you give him, not merely enough but the right kind of food—which amounts to pretty nearly the same thing. Strange enough it is to see the revolutions whereby old notions come back to resume a fore- most place in the speculations of modern philosophy. .Who would have thought to meet with those popular fancies on the chapter of soup and beef- eating, immortalised by Hogarth in the “ Gate of Calais ”—in a serious treatise by a leader of modern science. “The stouter diet of Englishmen, [says Mulder]—which may be partly a cause, partly the result of a more vigorous activity of the spiritual powers—is closely connected with the mental vigour of this nation;—the French soup with the frivolity mirrored in these two —both equally vague—words I’honneur et la gloire, with which that nation is continually deluding itself. In our country the separatist is usually a hypochondriac : strengthen his stomach, give him fortifying nourishment, and he will raise his spiritual views, and demand the more vigorous sustenance of an invigorated mind.” Here we have the philosopher of the nineteenth century enforcing the principle Shakespeare embodied in the wisdom of his Sir Andrew Aguecheeks and Toby Belches ! :— "Sir And. Methinks sometimes I have no more wit than a Christian or an ordinary man has ! But I am a great eater of beef : and I believe that does harm to my wit. Sir Toby. No question. Sir And. An I thought that. I’d forswear it."

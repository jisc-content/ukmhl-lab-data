369 HOSPITALITY —the dinners of parade which the modern satirist has ridiculed among the follies of vulgar ostenta- tion—seems to have been then a part of the English character. This observer of our insular manners says : “ They think that no greater honour can be conferred or received than to invite others to eat with them, and they would sooner give five or six ducats to provide an entertainment for a person than a groat to assist him in any distress.” Smollett, in his ‘‘ Humphry Clinker,” compares the hospitality of the English, in the eighteenth century, very unfavourably with that of continental nations ;— “ Certain it is [he says] we are generally looked on by foreigners as a people totally destitute of this virtue; and I never was in any country abroad where I did not meet with persons of distinction who complained of having been inhospitably used in Great Britain. A gentleman of France, Italy, or Germany, who has entertained and lodged an Englishman at his house, when he afterwards meets with his guest in London, is asked to dinner at the ‘Saracen’s Head,’ the ‘Turk’s Head,’ the ‘ Boar’s Head,’ or the ‘ Bear,’ eats raw beef and butter, drinks execrable port, and is allowed to pay his share of the reckoning.” The eighteenth-century manners of the English are not to be commended. Surely their hospitality, like their cookery, must have deteriorated. Since that period, certainly, Englishmen have generally prided themselves on the heartiness of their welcome and the open-handed profusion which characterises their hospitality. Nor have the sister kingdoms been behindhand in winning encomiums for the same social virtues. Adam Sedgwick abso- lutely revelled in the abundance of Edinburgh break- fasts, and was supremely comfortable under the spell of Irish hospitality, as his memoirs declare. It is only on such happy occasions that the true wine of life is met with. 24

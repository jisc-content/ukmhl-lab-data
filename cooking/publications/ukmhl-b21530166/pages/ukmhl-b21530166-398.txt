GOOD CHEER 358 structed a bridge of boats between Baiae and Puteoli, a distance of three miles, and after covering it with earth built houses upon it. .When it was finished he gave a splendid banquet in the middle of the bridge, and concluded the entertainment by throwing a number of his guests into the sea to drown. But here it is not the moral aspect of hospitality which has to be considered so much as the methods by which it has displayed itself. No social con- vention, no form of courtesy, better established a good relationship between man and man than the invitation given by one, and the acceptance of it by the other, to eat together. With us eating together is regarded as the highest mark of companionship. But eating customs vary greatly in different parts of the world. The caste customs of India are well known. The Maldivian islanders eat alone, so do the Otaheiteans ; the former seemingly from some misanthropical reason, perhaps ideas of witchcraft. The latter, however, are naturally sociable. Yet at the hour of repast the members of each family divideâ€”two brothers, two sisters, even husband and wife, father and mother place themselves at a distance of two or three yards from one another, turn their backs, and take their meals in profound silence. Such customs may not improbably have come down from the very earliest periods of society, when the savage, fearing that one stronger than himself might ravish his meal from him, concealed himself to eat. The islanders of the Philippines, on the other hand, are so sociable that when one finds himself alone at mealtimes he runs until he meets with one to join him, and however keen his appetite may be, declines to satisfy it without a guest. Among the American Red Indians the host is continually on the watch to solicit his guests to eat.

THE DIETARY OF THE SCRIPTURES 45 it affords of a country-house interior of the sixteenth century, in which the dining-room appears to lead out of, and form an extension of, the kitchen. In the Jewish dispensation there was a simplicity about the authorised dietary of the people which at times was almost ascetic in its austerity. But there was no vegetarian exclusiveness. The Scriptures, it is curious to note, accounted it unto Nebuchadnezzar, the mighty king of Babylon, as a distinct part of his punishment when, for his impious pride, he was visited by seven years of in- sanity, during which he, unfitted for the company of men, “ ate the grass of the field like oxen.” Are these seven years of herbivorous purgation to be regarded simply as equivalent to, or symbolic of, a lustrum? The Rabbis of the Talmud assert that Adam and the ten generations succeeding him were absolute vegetarians, to whom all animal food was strictly prohibited (Genesis i. 29). Rabbi Joshuah ben Levi says when Adam was punished for the great dis- obedience, and told that through his fault the ground would be cursed, he felt the greatest humiliation at that portion of his sentence, ‘‘ Thou shalt eat the herb of the field” (Genesis hi. 18). Tears came into his eyes as he exclaimed, “ Shall I and mine ass indeed eat out of one manger? ” But when the Divine judgment immediately proceeded, ” In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread,” Adam was more than consoled. The obvious moral of this rabbinical embellishment being, of course. There is comfort in work.

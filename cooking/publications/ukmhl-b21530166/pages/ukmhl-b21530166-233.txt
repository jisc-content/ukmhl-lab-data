205 SEASONAL FESTIVALS signify indulgence in gaiety and festivity. In Gloucestershire this festive day was once utilised to honour the production of its native dairies, the famous Gloucester cheese. At Randwick, near Stroud, the custom was to carry in procession to the church three cheeses, decked with flowers, on three litters, to the accompaniment of shout, song, and music. There they were divested of their decora- tions and rolled three times round the church. They were then rehabilitated, carried back to the village in the same state, and finally cut up for distribution among the inhabitants. Robert Bloomfield would have us believe that the grand old English squire of the eighteenth century made it a practice to feast his tenants on May-day— “ Not a face was there But, for May-day at least, had banished care. Freedom was there, and joy in every eye. Such scenes were England’s boast in days gone by.” The poem is idyllic, but history, grimly prosaic, does not smile assent. Associated with man’s most ancient industry was the pastoral festivity to which Milton makes allusion in “ Lycidas ” :— “Such as for their bellies’ sake. Creep and intrude, and climb into the fold. Of other care they little reckoning make Than how to scramble at the shearers’ feast.” The Shearers’ Feast was celebrated as soon as the last timid sheep had, with a mighty leap, cleared well away from the clipping-pen, and given that free, joyous shake of its naked skin so expressive of its gratification. The celebration generally occurred about Midsummer Day, and the festivity was marked by song and dance, and rustic sports.

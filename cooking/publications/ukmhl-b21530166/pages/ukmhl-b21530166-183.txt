The rounded top of the dinner knife is a convention which dates back to about the time of Queen Anne, when even well-bred people ate with their knives. It may safely be asserted that few use the fork more gracefully than an English lady. The Germans generally grasp it with a clenched fist. But the Annean fork of two long, thinnish, and well- separated steel spikes was an implement few could have used either gracefully or effectively. From Anderson’s “ History of Commerce ” we learn that knives for table use were first made in England in 1563, though there is a passage in Chaucer which tells us that the miller of Tromping- ton carried a Sheffield whittle in his hose. But no one ventures to say the exact date at which table forks were included among Sheffield’s famous cutlery productions—it was probably early in the eighteenth century. In France, prior to the Revolution, it was customary when a gentleman was invited to dinner for him to send his servant with his knife, fork, and spoon ; or if he had no servant he carried them with him as a workman does his tools. Sometimes leather cases to hold the three implements were used. 11

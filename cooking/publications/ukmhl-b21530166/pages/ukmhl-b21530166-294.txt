262 GOOD CHEER Appended was a paper of the “ business ” :— “ At the last general meeting it was unanimously resolved that an invitation to ETA BETA PI must be answered in writing within 24 hours, &c. “ Therefore to ensure the punctual attendance of those illustrious gastrophilists who are invited to join this high tribunal of taste It was irrevocably resolved, That the janitor be ordered not to admit any visitor, of whatever eminence of appetite, after the hour at which the secretary shall have announced that the specimens are ready, &c. “By Order of the Committee.” And so joking and hospitality went ever hand in hand with this benevolent, good-humoured, and whim- sical old doctor.

O culinary sage (I do not mean the herb in use That always goes along with goose) How have I feasted on thy page !” French influence was again brought to bear on English cuisine when Louise Eustache Ude, for- merly cook to the unfortunate Louis XVI., became chef to the Earl of Sefton, and wrote “ The French Cook.” Notwithstanding a plethora of cookery-books, cookery as an art, with all its ancient splendour of design, almost disappeared from English homes in the long and dreary period during which it was the sole repertory of the sex that was told to be good.

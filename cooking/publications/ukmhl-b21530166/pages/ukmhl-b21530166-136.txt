With the rise of the municipalities, the same pro- fusion characterised civic entertainments. A Venetian travelling in England about the year 1500 records that he saw the Mayor’s banquet at the Guildhall, where a thousand people were seated at table, and the meal lasted upwards of four hours.

Supper generally came at four, and was as substantial as the breakfast ; then between eight and nine the “ livery ” or evening collation, consisting of bread, ale, and spiced wine was had, generally in bed. Mealtimes were altering in the fourteenth century. Here is an extract from the Journal of Elizabeth Woodville, who became the queen of Edward IV :— “ 10 May 1451. Six o'clock (a.m.) Breakfasted. The buttock of beef rather too much boiled, and the ale a little the stalest. Memorandum : to tell the cook about the first fault, and to mend the second myself by tapping a fresh barrel directly.

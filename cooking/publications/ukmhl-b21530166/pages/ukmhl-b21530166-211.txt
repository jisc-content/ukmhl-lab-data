187 “THE STAFF OF LIFE” Great Britain’s battles on the high seas, had to subsist on .biscuits, so badly made that when the weevils were knocked out, there often remained nothing but empty shells. All these efforts were as futile as they were fallacious, and on March 5, 1801, the price of the quartern loaf reached is. io|d. ; after which date it slowly moderated, a good harvest that year easing the economic strain very considerably. The vast food markets of the world were as yet waiting to be opened by the free enterprise of British traders. This, briefly, summarises the economic position of the country with regard to its food supply a century ago. In the absence of the potato and other articles of food now common, bread in olden times was more nearly the staff of life than it is now. Five or six centuries ago bread was of various degrees of fine- ness (or “ bolting,” as it was called, from the bolting-sieve through which it passed at the mill) and colour. The finest and whitest was known as simnel bread, or in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, as pain demayn, corrupted from panis dominicus, “ the Lord’s bread,” because on each fine loaf was impressed a figure of the Saviour. Only persons of highest rank and most affluent circum- stances could afford to consume this class of bread. The next in quality was the wastel bread, used by the wealthier middle class ; the name was from the old French gasteau, a cake. Then came a quality very little inferior, light bread, sometimes known as French bread, or puffe. Next in quality was cocket, so called because it bore a baker’s seal or cocket, as demanded by the strict regulations of London to warrant its standard of fineness. Of lower quality was tourte, a twisted bread made of unbolted meal, in general use among the humbler classes and the inmates of monasteries. Trete bread.

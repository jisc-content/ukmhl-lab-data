260 GOOD CHEER Again, these dainty housewives of a bygone generation introduced poetical ideas into their culi- nary art ; there was often a play of fancy about some of their dishes. In turning over the pages of one of their favourite cookery-books, one may find directions how to spin gold and silver webs for dessert, how to make an obelisk or a Chinese temple in sweetstuff, or how to build a hen’s nest with strips of lemon for straw, and holding eggs filled with flummery. There is a high-flown recipe for “ Moon and Stars in Jelly,” and a finer flight of the imagina- tion is “ Solomon’s Temple in Flummery.” In solids and savouries the fancy also played just as lightly. We learn how “ To make a Porcupine of a Breast of Veal,” “ To Barbecue a Pig,” and even to bombard veal. But when we read “ How to Florendine a Hare,” and “ To make a Solomon Gundy,” we suspect we have struck a bad spelling o’f “ Florentine ” and “ Salmagundi.” How vividly all this recalls sweet memories of the old-world gardens we have seen, some few of which still exist in out-of-the-way places, with their basil, hyssop, rue, burnet, balm, sorrel, tansy, fennel, and rosemary ; with pot-herbs and small saladings ; with all that the garden adjunct to the stillroom produced ” a-purpose.” But where are now the accomplished housewives who know their virtues and how to make use of them? And are our tastes as refined and delicate nowadays when mint, sage, and parsley almost exhaust our garden flavourings, and borage gives way to cucumber in claret cup? Other cookery-books of renown are those of Hunter, Raffald, Rundell, and Kitchiner. Also worthy to be placed on the same shelf was “ The Cook and Housewife’s Manual ” of Mistress Meg Dods, hostess of the Cleikum Inn, St. Ronans, which was published in 1826.

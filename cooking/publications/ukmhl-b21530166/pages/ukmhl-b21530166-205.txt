THE ROAST BEEF OF OLD ENGLAND 181 Culinary inventiveness in the English mind runs along the groove of utilitarianism rather than of ornament and artistry ; it always inclines to the homely and is seldom “ faddy,” But if there is a lack of imagination about English dishes, there is an unfailing substantiality designed to leave the diner with a feeling of hearty satisfaction with his meal. The cookery term d VAnglaise implies something in the shape of a plain roast or a plain boil, or that the dish is prepared by the ‘‘ plain cook ” typical of the country. Never were more substantial repasts spread than in the baronial halls of our ancient feudal mansions, or in the spacious refectories of old English monasteries. But the barbecue—the animal cooked whole—was the fare provided for the open-air enter- tainment at great rejoicings. When the meat was roasted, it was placed in front of the fire on a spit which needed constant turning. This service was performed by a smoke- jack in the chimney actuated by the ascending current of air, or by a long-bodied “ turn-spit ” dog in a wheel-cage, or by a small boy turning a handle. The pulley-wheel which was on the spit was con- nected to one or other of these motive ‘‘ engines ” by means of ropes or chains. Among the other forms of obsolete roasting mechanism was a crude clockwork. Broach-turners, as the lads who manipulated the larding-pin were called, were least resorted to. The importance of the service in the domestic arrangements of the long- dead past may be judged from the fact that the manor of Ashwell, in Essex, was held by the serjeanty of “ turning one broche or spit in the King’s Kitchen on his coronation day ”—a tenure about as servile as that of scalding the King’s pigs by which Bure in the same county was held.

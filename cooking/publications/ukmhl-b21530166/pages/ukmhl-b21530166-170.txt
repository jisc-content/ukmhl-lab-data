148 GOOD CHEER in slices which were piled by the side of the carver, or Ecayer Tranchant (Cutting Squire). He had a pointed carving-knife and a skewer of drawn silver or gold, which he stuck into the joint ; having cut off a slice, he took it on the point of the knife and placed it on a slice of bread, which was served to the guest. A leg or a haunch of venison had a napkin (or, later, a piece of paper) wrapped round the shank, which the carver took hold of when he carved the joint. Old-fashioned pointed carving knives are still to be met with. A dinner table is thus described by Barclay in his “ Ecloges,” published in 1570;— “ If the dish be pleasant, either fleshe or fishe, Ten hands at once swarm in the dishe ; And if it be fleshe ten knives shalt thou see, Mangling the fleshe, and in the platter flee. To put there thy handes, in peril without fail Without a gauntlet, or else a glove of mail.” In the sixteenth century there was sometimes used a fork-spoon—a spoon sawn into long teeth so as in some degree to unite the two purposes of the flesh-fork and the spoon. By some this has been thought to indicate the origin of the table-fork. But the real source of our indebtedness is gleaned from the pages of a quaint old work, entitled “ Crudities,” written in 1611 by, an English traveller of some renown in his day, one Thomas Coryate. “ I observed ” '(he writes) “ a custom in all those Italian cities through which I passed, that is not used in any other country that I saw in my travels, neither do I think that any other nation of Christen- dom doth use it, but only Italy.” And what was this unique custom which Coryate had not found in France, or Germany, or Switzerland, or in any other of the countries he had visited?

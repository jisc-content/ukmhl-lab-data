49 THE FOODS OF THE ANCIENTS ing men, being able to enrich themselves by foreign commands or at the expense of the public treasury, formed themselves into a higher class of citizens, called Peers, while the lower orders, called Inferiors, although nominally in enjoyment of equal privileges, were no longer able, in consequence of the altered state of living, to bear their share in the Syssitia, and so sank into a degraded and discontented class, ripe for sedition and anarchy. The accumulation of wealth into a few hands and luxurious living were the downfall of Sparta. The Pythagorean philosophy, which came a cen- tury or two later, in so far as it was an esoteric institution, was supposed to include religious orgies, notwithstanding that its ethics demanded the practice of asceticism. It has been represented that Pytha- goras forbade all animal food ; other authorities contend that he allowed all kinds of animal food except the flesh of oxen used for ploughing, and rams. There is a similar discrepancy as to the pro- hibition of fish and beans. But temperance of all kinds seems to have been strictly enjoined. It is also stated that the Pythagoreans had common meals, resembling the Spartan system, at which they met in companies of ten. The cultivation of a calm de- meanour and an elevated tone was aimed at, and it was taught that souls under the domination of sensu- ality either passed into the bodies of animals, or, if incurable, were thrust down into Tartarus, to meet with expiation or condign punishment. Milo, of Crotona, six times victor in wrestling at the Olympic Games, is said to have been a member of the Pythagorean school, yet it is related that after his feats of carrying a four-year-old heifer on his shoulders through the stadium at Olympia, he ate the whole carcass in a single day. The gymnast of the Pythagorean cult was manifestly very far from being a vegetarian. 4

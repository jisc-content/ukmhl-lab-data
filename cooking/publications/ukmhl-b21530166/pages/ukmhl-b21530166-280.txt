248 GOOD CHEER When we come to “ The Compleat Cook,” the third part of the volume, we are considerably astonished to find the luxury and refinement at the Court of Charles I. which its contents reveal, the recipes for the dressing of fish being particularly, dainty. But the most noticeable feature about them, perhaps, is the punctiliousness and nicety of the language employed in speaking of the fish when served at table. To request any one, for instance, to serve or give a helping of salmon was quite wrong. They were politely asked to ‘‘ chine that salmon,” “ string that lamprey,” “ splat that pike,” ‘‘ sauce that tench ” (or ” that plaice ”), ” splay that bream,” ” side that haddock,” ” tusk that barbel,” ” culpon that trout,” “ transom that eel,” ” tranch that sturgeon,” “ undertranch that porpoise,” “ tame that crab,” or, as it may be, “ barb that lobster.” ” Here endeth the goodly termes of Kervynge,” as a much older book says. Etiquette and good breeding in the seventeenth century demanded the employment of similar niceties of language when reference had to be made to the carving of game or fowl. Correct maimers required one to speak of “ rearing a goose,” “ lifting a swan,” ” saucing a capon,” “ spoiling a hen,” “ trussing a chicken,” “ unbracing a mallard,” ” unlacing a coney,” “ dismembering a heron,” ‘‘ displaying a crane,” “ disfiguring a peacock,” “ unjointing a bittern,” “ untacking a curlew,” ” allaying a pheasant,” ‘‘ winging a partridge ” '(or “ a quail ”), “ mincing a plover,” and “ thighing a pigeon ” (or “ a woodcock ”). As space forbids the quoting of more than one cookery recipe, it shall be that for pigeon-pie, a preference the justification for which appears when we arrive at the end of it :—

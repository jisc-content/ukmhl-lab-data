These were distributed to the ladies, and then four and twenty pipers commenced to play, escorting the company to their respective homes, accompanied by servants in gorgeous liveries and bearing torches. As previously mentioned, it was a medieval custom in that period of boundless hospitality to mark the difference between the gentle and the simple at table by the position of the salt. “Thou art a carle mean of degree, Ye salte yt doth stande twain me and thee; But an thou hadst been of ane gentyl strayne, I would have bitten my gante again.” The salt-vat, or salt-foot, was a massive piece of plate, and its use was common to England, Scotland, and France ; in each country the distinction of seats in relation to its position was regarded as an impor- tant matter in table etiquette. When a man who had once sat below the salt was invited to a seat above it, that was an unequivocal recognition of his improved social status. This was noticed by our early dramatists. And one of our earliest satirists. Bishop Hall, makes the following allusion :— “A gentle squire would gladly entertaine Into his house some trencher chaplaine, Some willing man that might instruct his sons, And that would stand to good conditions : First, that he lie upon the truckle bed Whiles his young master lieth o’er his head; Second, that he do on no default Ever presume to sit above the salt.” The salt-holder or salt-cellar (“ cellar ” is prob- ably a corruption of sall-Qx) was of considerable size.

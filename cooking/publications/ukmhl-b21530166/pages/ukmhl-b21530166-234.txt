This was the pastoral feast ; then there was the Harvest Home, when, all being safely garnered in, the farmer held a feast in his barn to signalise the triumphs of agriculture. This rural celebration bore various names in different parts of the country. In some counties it was known as the Harvest Supper'; in Yorkshire it was the Mel-Supper, the reapers all shouting “ Mel 1 ” as they brought the last load ■home ; and in Kent it was known as the Kem Supper. “ Kerning ” meant corn-bearing, and an image dressed up with corn, which the reapers carried before them, was called the “ Kern Baby.” In the North of England the name Churn Supper was used ; but whatever the name, the origin seems to have been derived from the Levitical injunction, . . . and shall reap the harvest thereof, then ye shall bring a sheaf, the first fruits of your harvest, unto the priest.” The Jews celebrated the Feast of Harvest, and a similar institution was known in Ancient Greece.

Last of the whole year’s crop; And Grace among the green boughs rode Right plump upon the top.”

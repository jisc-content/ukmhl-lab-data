FAMOUS LOCAL COMESTIBLES 219 a respectable baker of Bath, who was also a musician, noticed the girl and the trade she was doing, bought her business, and then made a song on the subject of “Sally Lunn,” which he set to music. The com- position instantly became a great street favourite in Bath, the sale of the cakes increased enormously, and their distribution had to be made from barrows. The shrewd Dalmer in time made a fortune out of his “ Sally Lunns,” which retain some vestige of their popularity to this day. The comestible known as the “ Bath bun,” and now sold everywhere throughout the kingdom, is distinct from this famous tea-cake ; it is a sweet bun of a somewhat stodgy type, and is popularly supposed to constitute, with a little milk, the average form of luncheon taken by mild curates. The rival tea-cake of Scotland is the scone, which upon its native heath is cooked on a griddle or hot-plate. The ancient town of Newark celebrates March i ith as Penny Loaf Day. During the siege of this place in the Great Civil War, Hercules Clay, a trades- man and alderman, dreamt three times that his house was in flames. The dream was so vivid that after its third repetition the worthy alderman hurriedly removed his family from the premises, and, sure enough, he had scarcely taken this precaution ere a bomb, fired by the Parliamentary Army, fell on the roof of his house and penetrated every one of the floors. To commemorate his preservation Alderman Clay left a sum of money to provide penny loaves for distribution annually among the poor of the town on this auspicious day. Kidderminster has its Farthing Loaf Day every Midsummer Eve, a similar charity founded by an old maid in far-away times, when loaves at this price were not the diminutives which now adorn the bakers’ windows for the occasion.

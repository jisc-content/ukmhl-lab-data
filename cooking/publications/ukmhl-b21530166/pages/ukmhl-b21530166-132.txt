112 GOOD CHEER with gold. The etiquette observed was characterised by a grandeur and a pompous ceremonial ; a spirit of parade and romantic gallantry presided over the feasts of this age, which, though it may appear ridiculous to modern ideas, was no doubt well calcu- lated to produce good effects in nurturing a martial disposition among the nobility, but more so in preserving a sense of decorum and politeness in the presence of ladies, and so forming a check on the licentious manners of an unlettered age. Much of the ceremonial was directly devised towards a display of gallantry and to the formation of a correct demeanour towards the fair sex, while the splendour of these feasts was directed towards increasing a refinement of manners. The entire system was conceived in a high-flown spirit of romanticism ; thus, in the language of those days, “ the peacock was the food of lovers and the meat of lords.” The minstrel tuned his harp to feats of chivalry, or recited deeds of prowess in praise of some hero of romance, the noble company getting a thrill when, at certain periods of the festivities, warlike peals burst forth from the horns and other military instruments of the age—as when the trumpets heralded a procession, or “ brayed out the triumph of a pledge.” A great English noble had, besides his castle, several baronial halls, and manor-houses on his various estates, and often a house in London as well. Between these places he was constantly moving, and at every migration he carried in his impedimenta the chief of his domestic utensils, his brass pots, cooking utensils, and perhaps crockery. At each house the farm and the orchard provided his pro- visions ; it always contained cellars and spiceries well stored. He kept his own baker and breweress, and even made his own candles from the fat of the mutton and deer.

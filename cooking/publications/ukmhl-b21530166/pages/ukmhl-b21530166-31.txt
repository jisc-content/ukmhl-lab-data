25 “THE SACRED RAGE OF HUNGER” self like the brute beast of the field ; to dine was the first step on the highway towards civilisation. The primeval savage cut his warm slice from the haunches of the living animal, and swallowed it reek- ing from the kitchen of Nature ; his discovery of fire and the art of cooking dates and authenticates the earliest stage in the refinement of his race. When man became a cooking animal he raised a new dis- tinction which marked him off from all the rest of the animal creation. Let us consider the progressive stages of this evolu- tion. When the human animal was first placed on the earth, wild and naked, his most pressing wants were those associated with his body—^shelter from the weather, and food to eat. Till he had acquired the ability to fashion weapons for the hunt his food consisted of the wild fruits and berries he found at hand ; the streams of fresh water running down the hillside provided him with drink. He might have taken and eaten of the fish that glided past, but of the deer and other creatures fleeter than him- self he could make no meal till he had devised the wherewithal to take them. Nor of cooked food could he enjoy the pleasure till a knowledge of fire, or how to obtain it, had been acquired. In the earliest ages of the world the food of man varied with the climate in which he found himself, the natural productions of each zone being always the most suitable. Between the tropics a purely vegetarian diet of fruits, seeds, and roots amply sufficed. It was in the temperate and cold regions that man developed his taste for flesh food ; in the former he could indulge himself with a mixed diet of flesh and vegetables ; in the latter he had to put up with animal food alone.

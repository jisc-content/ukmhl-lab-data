WHEN ENGLAND FED ITSELF 171 A tansy was a sweet dish made of egg's, cream, &c., flavoured with the juice of tansy, a common species of odorous herb. “ 5 1662.—At noon, had Sir W. Pen and his son William to my house to dinner—I having some venison given me a day or two ago, and so I had a shoulder roasted, another baked, and the umbles baked in a pie, and all very well done.” Umbles are the heart, liver, and entrails of the deer, and in olden times were the perquisite of the huntsman. vWhen the lord and his household dined, the venison pasty was served on the dais, but the umbles were made into a pie for the huntsman and his fellows. Hence the origin of the saying about “ eating humble pie.” “ 24 Oct. 1662.—Dined with my wife upon a most excellent dish of tripes of my own directing, covered with mustard, as I have heretofore seen them done at my Lord Crewe’s, of which I made a very good meal, and sent for a glass of wine for myself.” Evidently “ tripes ” were not considered so ple- beian a dish in the days of gossip Pepys. “ 12 yan. 1663.—I had for the company, after oysters at first course, a hash of rabbits and lamb, and a rare chine of beef. Next, a great dish of roasted fowl, cost me about 30s., and a tart, and then fruit and cheese. My dinner was noble, and enough. ... At supper, had a good sack posset and cold meat, and sent my guests away about ten o’clock, both them and myself highly pleased with our management of this day. ... I believe this day’s feast will cost me near £s” The prices given here are rather useful for pur- poses of comparison. Everything consumed, it will be observed, except the wines, was of English pro- duction. There was, as yet, no ransacking the markets of the world to supply England with food- stuffs.

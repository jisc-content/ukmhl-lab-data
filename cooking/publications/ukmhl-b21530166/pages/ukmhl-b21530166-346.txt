308 GOOD CHEER “ There is a great deal of fine confused feeding in a singed sheep’s head.” David Hume boasted how he could make “ sheep’s head broth in a manner that Mr, Keith speaks of for eight days after, and the Due de Nivernois would bind himself apprentice to my lass to learn it I ” One philosopher has traced sheep’s head broth to an origin earlier than that of the black broth of Sparta. The Scottish dish, as a culinary preparation, is a work of high art, requiring two distinct per- formers, two different handicrafts, to bring it to perfection ; the brawny blacksmith, with his glowing iron, working harmoniously with the neater-handed cook, to produce a dainty tureenful, delicious to the palate and grateful to the stomach. The line of argument runs through the Arabs of Morocco, who from a most remote period sent their sheeps’ heads to the blacksmith to be singed, and afterwards made broth of them. “ There is reason to believe,” says this authority, “ that the sheep’s-head broth of the Gael excels that of the Spartan in antiquity, as it does in sapidity.” Smollett savagely declares of this fish that it ‘‘ put me in mind of the history of Congo, in which I read of negroes’ heads sold publicly in the markets.” Then there is minced collops, a dish common enough in Scotland, and which only the Scotch know how to make. Where there is such artistry there can be no shortcoming in conventionality. The charge of “ foul feeding ” implies a lack of culinary art. Hotch potch in Scotland hardly justifies the original form of its name, “ hodge-pot,” signify- ing a jumble of ingredients ; for it is simply soup made with mutton or lamb cut in small pieces, with peas, carrots, turnips, and sometimes parsley and celery, and served with the meat in it. Elsewhere it is often made of fragments in the pot-au-feu.

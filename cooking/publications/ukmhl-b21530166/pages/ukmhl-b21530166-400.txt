GOOD CHEER 360 The first time Byron dined with Moore and Rogers at the table of the latter, his host was mortified to find there was nothing his noble guest could eat or drink, owing to his exaggerated dread of corpu- lency. He asked for biscuits and soda-water, but these had not been included in the menu ; and eventually he made his dinner—and a hearty one— off potatoes and vinegar ! The eccentric dinner given by Dean Swift illus- trates the sweet reasonableness of allowing the guest to suit his own taste. The Dean on one occasion invited to dinner several of the first noblemen and gentlemen in Dublin, who, knowing his punctuality, assembled at the appointed time to a minute. A servant announced the dinner, and the Dean led the way to the dining-room. To each chair was a servant, a bottle of wine, a roll, and an inverted plate. On taking his seat the Dean desired his guests to arrange themselves according to their own ideas of precedence and fall to. The company were astonished to find the table without a dish or any provisions. The Lord Chancellor, who was present, said, “ Mr. Dean, we do not see the joke.” ” Then I will show you,” answered Swift, turning up his plate, under which was a half-crown and a bill of fare from a neighbouring tavern. “ Here, sir,” said he to his servant, ” bring me a plate of goose.” The company caught the idea, and each man sent his plate and half-crown. Covers with anything that the appetites of the moment dictated soon appeared. The novelty, the peculiarity of the manner, and the unexpected circum- stances altogether excited the plaudits of the noble guests, who declared themselves particularly gratified by the Dean’s entertainment. The Russians have a peculiar custom at dinner, which is without parallel in the rest of Europe.

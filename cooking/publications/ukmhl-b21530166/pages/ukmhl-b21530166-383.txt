DIET AND HEALTH, TASTES AND TRAITS 343 In matters of diet persons have individual peculiarities ; doctors encounter an infinity of stomach eccentricities, and it is an incontro- vertible truth that is expressed in the old proverb, “ What is one man’s meat is another man’s poison.” An ancient maxim says that whatever pleases the palate nourishes. Modem science has scarcely justi- fied the philosopher who delivered himself of this axiom. Another school of thought puts forth the more discreet dictum that one should eat, if possible, of one kind of food only, or, at all events, eat of that dish first which is the most palatable. But if one wanted to live by rule, there is no lack ,of advice for the guidance of those who wish to be led in matters gastronomical. The aged are advised to eat often, and little at a time, as weak and wasted bodies need the reparation of tissue to go on slowly and constantly ; they also are to give liquid food the preference to solid, inasmuch as it digests more easily and nourishes soonest. “ When struck in years strong drink forbear, Especially of wine beware; Old men of moisture want supplies, But wine of all sorts heats and dries.” It is an eighteenth-century mentor who rhymes his admonitions thus. The sick are warned to eat less, not more, than usual ; they are admonished with the solemn caution, “ The more you fill your foul bodies, the more you hurt them.” “To miss a meal sometimes is good. It ventilates and cools the blood. Gives Nature time to clean her streets From filth and crudities of meats ; For too much meat the bowels fur. And fasting’s Nature’s scavenger."

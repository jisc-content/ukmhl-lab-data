337 ANTHROPOPHAGY Yet another supposed case of cannibalism in the Northern Kingdom is said to have occurred at the death-feast of Melville, of Genbervie, the obnoxious sheriff of the Mearns, who, according to a certain written account, was “ sodden and supped in broo ” by some lawless Scottish barons. This story is generally taken by wary historians, as no doubt the feasters took their broth, cum grano sails. There is, however, a recipe for cooking human flesh, and it is believed to be unique, the only one extant in any language. It occurs in the “ Romance of Richard Coeur de Lion^” where we are told that the lion-hearted King, when recovering from ague during the crusade, longed vehemently for a dish of boar’s flesh. The “accursed father of bristles,” as the Moslems term the hog, not being procurable on the plains of Palestine, the royal physicians were in a fix, as the King would not eat any other kind of meat, and animal food was considered essential to his recovery. A sagacious old knight having been consulted, soon relieved them of their difficulty, by the following prescription :— “Take a Saracen, young and fat, In haste let the thief be slayne, Opened, and his skin off flayne, And sodded full hastily, With powder and spicery And saffron of good colour.” The old knight’s advice was taken, and the King, believing it to be pork, made a hearty supper, and, after a sound sleep, awoke next morning perfectly recovered, and with a voracious appetite. But fancy the dismay of the cook when the King demanded for breakfast— “The head of that ilk swine That I of'-ate.” 22

THE COOK AND HIS ART 237 not arrived in time for a great dinner at which Louis XIV. was to have been present. Peace be to his ashes, for as the witty author of “ The Banquet ” writes :— "... The excellent Vatel Untimely but not unlamented fell, Friendship embalmed his memory in her tear, And rank and royalty adorned his bier. Long shall his premature and tragic fate The Fasti of the festive board relate.” It is again to the credit of the craft that .Wellington’s cook on the day of Waterloo stuck to his post, faithful to his duty, incre'dulous of defeat, though assured by hundreds of cowardly fugitives that the day was lost. A nice sense of honour, it would seem, distinguishes the cook who has arrived at any eminence in his profession. The favourite cook of George II. was Tom Weston, of whom the other servants were extremely jealous ; and when any dish was found fault with they invariably used to say it was Weston’s dressing. The King at last took notice of this, and said it was very extraordinary that every dish he disliked should happen to be of Weston’s preparing. “ In future,” continued the King, “ let every dish be marked with the name of the cook that makes it.” By this means the King detected their arts, and from that time Weston was reinstated in favour. The custom of marking the royal dishes with the name of the cook prevailed for long afterwards. Even the great Lord Bacon thought it no shame to bend his mighty intellect to the problems of the kitchen. David Hume, after retiring from public life in 1769, devoted himself to cooking, as “the science to which I addict the remaining years of my life.” What calling can boast more honourable names?

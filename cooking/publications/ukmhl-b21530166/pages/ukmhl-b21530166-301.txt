267 EPICURES In pastry built, or from the spit, or boiled, Gris-amber-steamed; all fish from sea or shore, Freshet or purling brook, for which was drained Pontus, and Lucrine bay, and Afric coast.” As an able critic has rightly said, this visionary feast of the poet was a temptation fitter for Helio- gabalus than the plain hunger of the Guest, for whose simple wants the cook-fiend would in vain conjure up his artillery of sauces. But there’s the satire—’tis the devil that plays the host. The “ gourmand ” has been delineated for us by Beaumont and Fletcher (or rather John Fletcher) in the play of “The Woman Hater” (1607) :— “"jLis an excellent thing to be a prince; he is Served with such admirable variety of fare. Such innumerable choice of delicates ; His tables are full fraught with most nourishing food. And his cupboards heavy laden with rich wines; His court is still fill’d with most pleasing varieties; In the summer his palace is full of green geese. And in winter it swarmeth woodcocks. Oh, thou goddess of plenty ; Fill me this day with some rare delicates. And I will every year most constantly. As this day, celebrate a sumptuous feast (If thou wilt send me victuals) in thine honour ! And to it shall be bidden, for thy sake, Ev’n all the valiant stomachs in the court; All short-cloak’d knights, and all cross-garter’d gentlemen; All pump and pantofle, foot-cloth riders ; With all the swarming generation Of long stocks, short pain’d hose, and huge stuff’d doublets.” Whatever the correct definitions of “ epicure,” “ gourmet,” and “ gourmand ” may be, the terms have come to be used interchangeably to designate the man who is addicted to good eating and drinking. In “ Anthony and Cleopatra ” Shakespeare phrases it :— “ Epicurean cooks Sharpen with cloyless sauce his appetite.”

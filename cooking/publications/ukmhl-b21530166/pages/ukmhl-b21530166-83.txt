69 A ROMAN BANQUET at the waist by a wide riband, which went twice round. Was not Ganymede, most beautiful of mortals, chosen to be cupbearer to Zeus? Attendants of an inferior grade were the penicillin or washers, who came in with sponge or cloth to clean the tables, and who sometimes assisted in the laying of the covers and the floral decoration of the room. Nor were these all the household servants seen at a Roman banquet. While the guests were softly reclining on their table-couches other slaves, sanda- ligerulin attended to their sandals, and fastened them on at the moment of departure. Others, flabellariin armed with fans of peacocks’ feathers, drove away the flies and cooled the banqueting-hall. The banquet terminated, the guests’ own servants were called upon. The adversatores, carrying lanterns or torches, conducted their masters home, never failing to point out the stones and other obstructions in the path, which frequent libations might prevent the diners discovering for themselves. If the haughty dame were carried to and from the feast in a palan- quin, the humbler slaves assigned to this duty were the lecticarii. All the servilities were performed silently and gracefully, but without undue obsequiousness ; the whole entertainment was pervaded with an air of elegance and reflnement, with its cloud of ministering attendants ready and watchful to anticipate every wish, to meet each requirement ; the scented fountains, the profusion of rose-leaf-stuffed cushions, the playing of soft music, and all the costly appoint- ments by which the diners were surrounded, com- pelled a languorousness and a sybaritic indulgence that must, in the inevitable result, have been ener- vating, and altogether unworthy of a once virile and warlike nation.

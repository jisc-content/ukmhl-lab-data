165 WHEN ENGLAND FED ITSELF artichokes, rice, and “ cloves ” of garlick. “ Turnips ” are mentioned in the medicines. Fennel was used for sauce-making and garnishing ; spinach had long been known, but came more into favour. In the “ Accomplisht Cook” (published in 1678) potatoes are named, and are ordered to be boiled and blanched ; seasoned with nutmeg, cinnamon, and pepper ; to be mixed with eringo roots,” dates, lemons, and whole mace ; to be covered with butter, sugar, and grape verjuice ; to be made with pastry into a pie, and used with rose-water and sugar. From this cruel and unseemly treatment of the poor un- offending potato one begins to understand why it was that the American tuber was so long popularising itself with the English palate. Eryngo, it may be explained, was the fleshy roof of the sea-holly, candied as a sweetmeat. Shakespeare makes Falstaff talk about the sky raining potatoes, hailing kissing- comfits, and snowing eryngoes. In the confections of the seventeenth century not only were many colouring matters used—saffron, saunders, “ chochineli,” “ blew starch,” and the juices of violets, of gilly-flowers, and of marigolds—but, often enough, perfumes entered into the composition, as musk, civet, rose-water, orange-water, and violet- water. A number of cookery terms, and names employed in culinary processes, have become obsolete since the seventeenth century.

Cakes and puddings used to be baked in “coffins.” Sugar and spices were “ searsed ” (sifted) ; cooks “ coddled ” (warmed up), “ seethed,” “ bottomed ” (drained), and “ endored ” (made shiny, as with egg or sugar) their products. They had “ coasts of beef,” “ cheese mots,” “ marchepans,” and “ ranioles ” ; and (as we still have) “ fritturs,”

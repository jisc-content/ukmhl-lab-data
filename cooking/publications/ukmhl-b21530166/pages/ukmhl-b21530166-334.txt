In such latitudes it may be convenient and even necessary for the inhabitants to eat their food without preparation, but in all temperate and warm climates the art of cookery prevails to a greater or less extent. One difference between man and the brute crea- tion is this—that whereas the various species of animal are, for the most part, restricted to particular regions or localities, man is spread over every portion of the earth’s surface. The Greenlanders live exclusively on animal sub- stances. They may sometimes, indeed, find a few berries, and they sometimes make a meal of the seaweed they pick up on the shore ; but these are merely the exceptions which prove the rule.

GOOD CHEER 126 This kind of extravagance is satirised by the leading dramatists of the time, as thus Beaumont and Fletcher :— “I’ll make you pigs speak French at table, and a fat swan Come sailing out of England with a challenge; I’ll make you a dish of calves’ feet dance the canaries, And a consort of cramm’d capons fiddle to 'em, A calf’s head speak an oracle, and a dozen of larks Rise from the dish and sing all supper-time. ’Tis nothing, boys. I’ve framed a fortification Out of rye-paste which is impregnable. And against that, for two long hours together. Two dozen of marrow-bones shall play continually. For fish, I’ll make you a standing lake of white-broth. And pikes come plowing up the plums before them : Arion on a dolphin, playing Lachrymae ; And brave king herring with his oil and onion Crown’d with a lemon peel, his way prepared With his strong guard of pilchers. I’ll bring you in the lady-loin-o’-veal. With the long love she bore the Prince of Orange : A full vine bending like an arch, and under The blown god Bacchus, sitting on a hogshead. His altar here; before that, a plump vintner Kneeling, and offering incense to his deity. Which shall be only this, red sprats and pilchers.” And then the marvels and magnificence of the magiric magicians :— “What do we read there of Hiarbas’ banquet (The great gymnosophist), that had his butlers And carvers of pure gold waiting at table ? The images of Mercury, too, that spoke ? The wooden dove that flew ? A snake of brass That hissed ? And birds of silver that did sing ? ” How easy to the proficient cook it all is, the dramatic dialogue proceeds to demonstrate. It was— “ As easy as a man would roast an egg. If that be all. For, look you, gentlemen. Here stand my broths ; my finger slips a little.

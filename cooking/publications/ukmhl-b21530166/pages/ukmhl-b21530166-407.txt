HOSPITALITY 367 forward with a keen financial appetite to gifts of silver vessels from the table, or to special gifts such as falcons, or coats of mail, or goodly horses. In the same rude age a heavy wit devised such preposterous things as jocular dishes for the enter- tainment of guests. According to “The Court and Kitchen of Elizabeth Cromwell,” the most scurrilous of cookery-books, some dishes were formerly brought to table “ more for sport than for belly timber.” The animated pie of the nursery rhyme, with its “ four and twenty blackbirds,” was by no means an unknown dish. And most readers will recall that when Charles I. and his Queen were entertained by Buckingham at Burleigh-on-the-Hill, in 1630, the noted Court dwarf, Jeffrey Hudson, was presented to the Queen served in a pie. A far more absurd method of setting on “ some barren spectators to laugh,” as Hamlet hath it, was sometimes practised at the City feasts of the sixteenth century. An immense vessel, broad and deep, was filled with custard and placed in the middle of the table. In the midst of the feast, when all the guests were busily engaged in discussing the viands, a jester would suddenly enter the room, and almost before any one was aware of his presence, would take a flying leap over their heads and plunge into the quivering mass of custard, to the intense amusement of all, except, of course, those near enough to be bespattered with the sticky mess. Allusion to this silly conceit is made by Ben Jonson in “ The Devil is an Ass ” :— “He may perhaps, in tail of Sheriff’s dinner, Skip with a Rhime o’ th’ table from New Nothing, And take his Almaine leap into a custard. Shall make my Lady Mayoress and her sisters Laugh all their hoods over their shoulders.”

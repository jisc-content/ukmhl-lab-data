Nor Celsus, nor Pitcairne. Suppose we own that milk is good And say the same of grass— The one for babes is only food. The other for an ass.” To which Cheyne made reply :— “ My system, doctor, is my own. No tutor I pretend; My blunders hurt myself alone. But yours your dearest friend. Were you to milk and straw confined Thrice happy might you be; Perhaps you might regain your mind. And from your wit get free.” A number of English poets, as might be expected from the temperamental inclinations and proclivities of the poetic mind, have either practised vege- tarianism or ranged themselves among the opponents of a sanguinary diet. The eccentric poet Shelley, having adopted a vege- tarian diet, wrote a little prose work, “ A Vindication of Natural Diet,” in favour of the practice of vege- tarianism. Among his arguments he says :— “ The allegory of Adam and Eve eating of the tree of evil, and entailing upon posterity the wrath of God, admits of no other explanation than the disease and crime that have flowed from un- natural diet.

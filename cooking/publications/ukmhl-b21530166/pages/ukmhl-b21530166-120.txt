GOOD CHEER 100 Here, then, are preparations for a feast—a mighty one ! 40 oxen, 500 lambs, 200 deer, 5,000 fowls, and 2,000 ells of linen for table-cloths ! Who, after reading these precepts, will impugn the testimony of the much-abused monk of St. Albans? Who will now accuse the old romance writers of mere romancing when they tell of the marvellous feasting at Arthur’s coronation? From numerous other entries, although none of them are so full and so specific as those we have selected, we find that the royal feasts were not in- frequently on an almost equal scale of magnitude ; we find, further, that in regard to some articles the same quantity was always ordered. Towards the close of almost every year an order was given for 100 lb. of almonds, 50 lb. of pepper, and 2 lb. of saffron ; these were therefore the accustomed quanti- ties to be used in the royal kitchen. In a precept towards the commencement of the Roll, directing Reginald de Cornhill to deliver his accounts at the Exchequer, we find the prices affixed to the various articles. Ginger was 2s. 6d. per pound, cinnamon the same, nutmegs los., and mace, of which this is the only entry, also los. ; the price of almonds varies from 25s. to 30s. the 100 lb., and saffron, the produce of our own fields, is, most singularly, charged as high as cinnamon.

GOOD CHEER 172 “ I June 1664.—At home, to look after things for dinner. And anon at noon comes Mr. Creed by chance, and by and by the three young ladies : and very merry we were at our pasty, very well baked; and a good dish of roasted chickens; pease, lobsters, strawberries.” Here we may take leave of Pepys, remarking that the terms “ pie ” and “ patty ” are both diminutives of the older word “ pasty,” Correctly used, ‘‘ pasty ” and ‘‘ patty ” are limited to venison, veal, and a few other meats ; “ pie ” is of a wider signification, including fruit, mince, &c. The venison pasty, if not the food of the gods, is generally accounted the acme of high feeding for Elizabethan heroes. Keats thus apostrophises the bardic revellers of the old Mermaid tavern :— “Souls of Poets dead and gone, What Elysium have ye known. Happy field or mossy cavern. Choicer than the Mermaid Tavern ? Have ye tippled drink more fine Then mine host’s Canary wine ? Or are fruits of Paradise Sweeter than those dainty pies Of venison ? ”

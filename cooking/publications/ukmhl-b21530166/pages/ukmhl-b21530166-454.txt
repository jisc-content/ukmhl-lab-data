406 GOOD CHEER at the personal expense of the Mayor, and in recent years has become a great public function to which have been invited some of the most eminent men of the day. Colchester’s oyster fishery dates from time imme- morial. There is abundant evidence of its succulent bivalves having attained great popularity among the luxurious Romans of old. In the fourth century the historian Macrobius asserts that St. Sylvester and the Roman Pontiffs never failed to have British oysters on their tables. In fact, British native oysters were renowned in ancient Rome, and their praises were sung by Juvenal, Martial, and other Latin poets. Even before the Christian era the historian Sallust declared that “ after all there is some good in the poor Britons—^they can produce an oyster.” "The olde luxuryous Romanes vaunte did make, Of gustful oisters tooke in Lucrine’s lake ; Your Essex better hath, and suche perchance As tempted Caesar first to pass from France.” Perhaps no other town is in the exceedingly happy position of being able to make high festival of its staple production. The townsmen of Farnham have for three hundred years enjoyed an annual venison dinner, the gift of the Bishop of .Winchester. The custom originated as a judicious bribe ; to prevent the mysterious dis- appearance of his fattest bucks, the Bishop promised to give one each year if his herd were not interfered with. Honesty is its own reward. A notable festive gathering in the annals of litera- ture—there are many others—was the Theatrical Fund Dinner, held February 23, 1827, at which Sir Walter Scott avowed himself, for the first time, as the author of the Waverley Novels.

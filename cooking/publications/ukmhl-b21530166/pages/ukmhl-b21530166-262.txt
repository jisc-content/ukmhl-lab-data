232 GOOD CHEER nised as a gentleman, for the heraldic blazon of a cook, according to Randle Holme, in The Academy of Armory,” is set forth in these terms': “He beareth Gules, a cook, with a cap, sleeves, and apron. Argent; waistcoat and breeches. Azurej hose of the second, shoes Sable; holding a dish of meat between his hands, proper ; a dresser fixed to the dexter side. Or.” A title sometimes given to cooks in older times was ecuyer, or equerry. The cook, owing, no doubt, to his office, was con- sidered important enough by Chaucer to be intro- duced as a leading character into his “ Canterbury Tales ” ; and the text furnishes us, in the banter of the host, with some particulars of this cook’s position, name, and other personal matters of interest, “ Many a Jack of Dover hast thou sold That hath been twies hot and twies cold. Of many a pilgrim hast thou Christe’s curse. For of thy parsley yet fare they the worse. That they have eaten in thy stubble-goose. For in thy shop go’th many a flie loose. Now tell on, gentle Roger, by thy name,’’ &c. The pilgrims continue their journey ; the tales, now of the broadest humour, now of the deepest pathos, follow in regular succession ; but intellec- tual enjoyments alone are far from satisfactory to the cook. He accordingly applies himself to a much more accustomed, and, to him, more substantial pleasure ; what that was the ensuing extracts will show. At the conclusion of the Canon Yeoman’s tale, the host, looking back, sees the cook fast asleep upon his horse :— , “ Then gan our host to jape and to play ; And saide. Sirs, what ? Dun is in the mire. Is there ne man for praierie ne for hire That will awaken our fellow behind ?

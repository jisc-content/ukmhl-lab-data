82 GOOD CHEER Simnel and wastel cakes and spice-bread were among the usual dainties. Wastel was a fine, well-baked white bread next in quality to simnel, a rich cake generally made in a three-cornered shape. The daily routine of a Norman household is seen in the rhyme of the period :— “ To rise at five, to dine at nine, To sup at five, to bed at nine. Makes a man live to ninety-and-nine.” This shows a remarkable change in manners, because the Saxons had four heavy meals during the day. Another striking change effected by the Conquest in domestic arrangements was that new names were given to certain articles of food. While alive, animals reared and fattened for food retained their Saxon names, being tended by Saxon servants ; but when they were killed and cooked and brought to table, they were dignified with Norman names. It was in this way an ox became beef; a calf, veal; a sheep, mutton; a sow, pork; a deer, venison, and a fowl, pullet. Bacon retained its Saxon name because the Normans despised it. In “ Ivanhoe ” we read : “ Swine is called pork when carried to the castle hall to feed the nobles ” ; but the inference that the swineherd never tasted pig is wrong, for it formed his principal, if not his only, flesh food. “ Old Alderman Ox continues to hold his Saxon title while he is under the charge of serfs and bondsmen ; but becomes Beef, a fiery French gallant, when he arrives before the worshipful jaws that are destined to consume him. Whether we regard Cedric as a Saxon thane or an English frajiklin the description of the evening meal in his mansion, as given by Scott in the third and fourth chapters of “ Ivanhoe,” affords a useful insight into the rude simplicity of the period.

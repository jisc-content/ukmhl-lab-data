GOOD CHEER 156 Beckmann, writing about the middle of the eighteenth century, says that while forks were still a rarity in Spain they had come into general use in France, where in the taverns knives were not placed on the table, as each person was expected to have his own, but as no person would eat without forks landlords were obliged to furnish these, together with plates and spoons. When Dr. Johnson travelled in Scotland he noticed that the Highlander wore his knife as a companion to his dirk, and that when the company sat down to meat, the men cut the flesh into small pieces for the women. The Highlander’s table knife was introduced subsequently to the Revolution. Knives and forks are still unknown in the East ; the meat is always cut up into stews or else cooked till it is ready to fall to pieces. If chickens are being eaten, they are easily torn to pieces with the fingers. There is no vulgarity in this ; the very polite d la mode Oriental will tear up the best bits and either lay them next his guest or insist on putting them into his mouth. The richer people use spoons, but the most common mode of eating is to double up bits of thin bread spoon-fashion, and dip them in the dish—the common dish, from which every one is eating. 4

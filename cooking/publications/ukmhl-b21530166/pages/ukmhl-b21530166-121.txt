Coming to the fourteenth century, we find still abroad among the barons and the gentry that spirit of munifi- cent hospitality which meliorated the abject condition of the poor. An almost unlimited hospitality reigned in the palaces of the monarch and in the castles of the nobles ; and the Courts of the Kings of England in the twelfth, thirteenth, and fourteenth centuries were splendid to a degree of which modern days exhibit but a feeble resemblance. The household accounts of Richard II. show that every day ten thousand persons sat down to meat at his charges, the royal kitchens serving out the messes to them by the hands of three hundred servitors. The old rhyming chronicler, Harding, says :— “ Truly I heard Robert Ireleff say, Clerk of the Green Cloth, that to the household Came every day, for the most part alway Ten thousand folk, by his messes told. That followed the house, aye, as they would: And in the kitchen three hundred servitours, And in every office many occupiers.

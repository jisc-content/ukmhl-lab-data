In the matter of food, as in religion and politics, men have agreed to differ. How widely they differ is scarcely realised. It is difficult to conceive the grossness of taste which led the ancient to account asafoetida, the most nauseous of drugs, as a prime luxury, and to declare it a food fit for the gods. A morbid desire for food has developed many revolting practices, and eccentricity of appetite may have been responsible for anthropophagy. Cannibalism, unpleasant as the subject may be, cannot be altogether excluded from our consideration. Primitive man is supposed to have been very largely anthropophagous during the Bronze Period. All highly civilised nations have regarded the habitual man-eater with abhorrence ; in fairy lore he always appears as an ogre, and in “ Othello ” we have the allusion to— “The Cannibals that each other eat, The Anthropophagi, and men whose heads Do grow beneath their shoulders.”

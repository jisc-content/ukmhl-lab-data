GOOD CHEER 336 happenings in this strange episode the reader is referred to the novel itself. The most notorious cannibal who ever achieved the honour of having his life recorded was Sawney Bean, whose horrible exploits are given at length in Johnson’s “ Lives of the Highwaymen.” This monster had his haunt on the Galloway shore, where, with the aid of a large family which he reared in a cave there, he is computed to have murdered and devoured not less than a thousand persons, men, women, and children, in the course of five-and-twenty years. As soon as he had robbed and murdered his victim, he carried off the carcass to his den, where it was cut into quarters, like a beast at the shambles, and some of the mangled limbs put into pickle. At last an exploit of more than usual atrocity led to an organised hunt being undertaken for the capture of this bloodthirsty clan. King James I. led the expedition in person—it was during the lifetime of Elizabeth, ere he had ascended the throne of England —and it was with considerable difficulty that the awful cavern was located, its entrance being masked by the rocks and concealed by the tide. With the aid of torches, its intricate windings were explored, and the habitation of horrors stood at last revealed, reeking like a charnel-house. The captured monsters were taken under a strong guard to Edinburgh, and were all executed in a manner befitting the horrible nature of their offences, and characteristic of the savagery of the times. The work in which this disgusting chronicle of human depravity is preserved is a Bir- mingham-printed book of 1742, and the life of Sawney Bean is accompanied by a full-page engrav- ing which shows the wretch at the entrance of his cave, standing sword in hand in front of a mutilated corpse, and his wife entering the cavern with a human leg, presumably to prepare it for the family con- sumption .

THE FOODS OF THE ANCIENTS 51 unreasonable to suppose that this pristine simplicity slightly waned. Indeed, it would be unsafe to assert that the Greeks and the Romans did not arrive at a knowledge of chimneys. In Aristophanes’ comedy “The Wasps” there is a character, Philocles, who hides himself in a chimney. A slave who hears him cries out, “ What a noise there is in the pipe of this chimney ! ” Philocles, being discovered, ex- claims, “ I am the smoke, and I am trying to escape.” That the ancient Greeks were adepts in the art of the table must appear from the fame of that lost recipe of the poet Menander—it was for a fish sauce, and its fame has come down through more than twenty centuries as having been delectable and am- brosial beyond all belief.

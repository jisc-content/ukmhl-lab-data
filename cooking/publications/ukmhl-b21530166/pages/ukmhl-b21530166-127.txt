107 BARONIAL PROFUSION Two fifteenth-century cookery-books have been published by the English Text Society, from a study of which it is clear that the scientific preparation and dressing of food at that period were largely dominated by French influences. The French titles of the various dishes as they appear in English garb are at times not a little puzzling. For instance, at first sight one does not recognise lait under let^ froide as fryit, or sauce in sauke. Herbelettes (small herbs) is almost unrecognisable as arbolettys.

Ale, for instance, was comtoonly mingled in the water in which fish was boiled. Milk and almond milk are common ingredients ; vinegar is used in brawn, and verjuice in meat custard. According to the more famous authority just men- tioned, “ The Forme of Cury,” the following was the recipe for a “ mortrewes,” a very favourite dish at that period, which was eaten with a spoon. “Take hens and pork and boil them together.

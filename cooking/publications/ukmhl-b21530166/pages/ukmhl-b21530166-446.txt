400 GOOD CHEER crowned in his father’s lifetime, upon which occa- sion the festal procession was truly regal, for “ the King served his son at the table as server, bringing in the boar’s head with trumpets before it.” At the coronation of Richard II. in 1377 Sir John Dymock, as successor to the Marmions in the office of King’s Champion, rode into the hall armed to the teeth, and gave forth the customary challenge to all opposers of the monarch’s title to the crown. The last occasion on which this ceremony took place was at the coronation of George IV., July 19, 1821, when Henry Dymock went through this form of medieval pageantry. At the coronation of William and Mary in 1689, to the consternation of the company, the challenge was accepted by an un- knovm person—it is supposed by an expert swords- man in disguise—but he escaped from the hall quickly, and nothing further came of it. In 1821, as soon as the King and his gorgeous cortege had arrived from the Abbey and taken their seats, the great doors at the end of the hall were flung open, clarions and trumpets sounded bravely, and three horsemen rode up the floor of the hall— the Duke of Wellington, as Lord High Constable, the Marquis of Anglesey, as Lord High Steward, and Lord Howard of Effingham, as Deputy Earl Marshal —followed by gentlemen bearing the first course. When the dishes had been placed on the table, the bearers retired with their faces towards the King, and then the noble horsemen retreated, backing their steeds down the hall and out at the archway. Before the dishes were uncovered the Lord Great Chamber- lain presented the basin and ewer to bathe his Majesty’s hands ; the Lord of the Manor of Heydon attended with a rich towel. The dishes were then bared, and his Majesty was helped by the carvers to some soup.

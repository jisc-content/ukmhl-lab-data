106 GOOD CHEER to the old apartments of the house, the other into a sort of little gallery, out of which the lord could look into the hall and call his wassailers to order if any unusual clamour or riot was going on, or call to any of his menials, bells not then being in use. On the right hand of the dais is the entrance into the cellar—an odd situation to our present fancy, but then, no doubt, thought very convenient for the butler to bring up the wine to the lord’s table.

Well might the head cook of this immense estab- lishment style his master “ the best and royalist viander of all Christian kynges ” in the vellum roll entitled “ The Forme of Cury ” compiled by him, and containing the authorised culinary recipes for the royal kitchen.

For blanc manger that made he with the best.”

GOOD CHEER 322 and officers to a banquet where, as Hollinshed narrates, “ there were fortie dishes, and yet not one either of fish or flesh, saving one of powdered salted] horse.” In the matter of diet the Germans seem always to have had a strange taste. Don Anthony of Guevara, the chronicler of Charles V., inveighs bitterly against the German cooks. “ I will tell no lie,” exclaims the indignant courtier, “ I saw such kinds of meat eaten, as are wont to be seen, but not eaten, as a roasted horse, a cat in jelly, little lizards in hot broth, frogs fried, and divers sorts of meat, which I never knew what they were till they were eaten. And, for God’s sake, what is he that shall read my, writing, and see what is commonly eaten at feasts, that it will not in a manner break his heart? ” A delicacy of the Italians in former times was the cardo '(the thistle, with which was also included the artichoke), which was generally served with the fruit at the end of a dinner. The cardo was some- times eaten with pepper and salt—with pepper, “be- cause it will not generate wind, and clears the liver ” —the popular belief being that because donkeys ate so largely of thistles was “ the reason they had better stomachs than men.” The “ cardoon ” is a most succulent and esculent vegetable which might find a welcome at English tables. Alexandre Dumas the elder was not only a colossal gourmet but a gifted cook, who believed, like Frank Buckland the naturalist, that he had eaten everything that was eatable. Dumas wrote a “ Grand Dictionnaire de la Cuisine ” of nearly twelve hundred pages, and in that comprehensive work in- cluded recipes for dishes so exotic as elephants’ feet, fillets of kangaroo meat, stuffed babirusa ,(the Borean wild hog), and Javanese kingfisheris’ nests.

223 COUNTY FEASTS included Dorsetshire, Gloucestershire, Hampshire, Herefordshire, Huntingdonshire, Kent, Northamp- tonshire, Oxfordshire, .Warwickshire, Wiltshire, Wor- cestershire, and Yorkshire. Although Merchant Taylors’ Hall appears to have been the favourite place of meeting, the halls of the Drapers’, Sta- tioners’, and Haberdashers’ Companies were occa- sionally resorted to. The latest gathering of which any record exists was that of the natives of Herefordshire on Feb- ruary 7, 1727-8, when Dr. Thomas Bisse, Chan- cellor of Hereford, so well known in connection with the establishment of the meetings of the Three Choirs of Gloucester, Worcester, and Hereford, preached, at St. Michael’s, Comhill. County Associations exist in London and other large cities at the present day. As long as local patriotism flourishes, and sentiment sways the human heart, they will be popular ; by means of such associations old acquaintances are renewed, the happy days of childhood are recalled, and many cherished memories brightened up again. And, be sure of this, there will always be a “ feast.”

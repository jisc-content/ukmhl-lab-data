Early in the eighteenth century Lord Townshend set the example of growing turnips every third year, so that the land produced three crops in three years instead of two. Other improvements largely in- creased the productiveness of the soil, and “ winter keep ” was systematically grown for the cattle. Oxen and sheep were small and scraggy well into the eighteenth century, when immense strides began to be made in cattle-breeding. A Leicestershire farmer, named Bakewell, deserves most of the credit for this improvement ; his sheep had two pounds of mutton on them where there had been only one pound before, and he was equally successful in pro- ducing fat oxen with plenty of beef.

Robert Bakewell held levees in his kitchen at Dishley, of the greatest in rank, the most eminent in science. He utterly disregarded the old notion of

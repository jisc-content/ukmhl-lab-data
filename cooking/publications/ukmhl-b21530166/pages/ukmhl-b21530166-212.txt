188 GOOD CHEER or bis, or brown bread, was made of wheat meal from which the fine flour at one sifting had been removed. Then came black bread, made of various kinds of grain inferior to wheat. Horse bread was extensively prepared, in sealed loaves, of which the principal ingredients were beans and peas. Strict laws regulated both the baking of bread and the sale of it. The baker of white bread was on no account to make tourte, or brown bread, or to have a bolting-sieve in his possession. Keepers of inns and lodging-houses were not allowed to bake bread. In London only farthing loaves and half- penny loaves were allowed to be made ; each loaf had to be sealed, and all bread was periodically assayed. In the markets loaves were exposed for sale in panyers, or bread-baskets, the principal days being Tuesday and Saturday, each basket paying a toll of one halfpenny. If the bread was delivered by female retailers who went from house to house, these “ hucksters ” were privileged to buy from the bakers, receiving thirteen loaves as twelve, the price of the additional loaf being reckoned as the limit of their legitimate profit. Hence “ a baker’s dozen ” is always thirteen. Notwithstanding all these regula- tions and restrictions, there were many frauds and their corresponding penalties known to the trade of a baker in medieval times. In the Middle Ages London bakers were allowed to keep swine in their houses when other persons were forbidden, apparently with a view to the more speedy consumption of the refuse bran, and as an inducement to the baker not to make his bread of too coarse a quality. The pigs, however, were to be kept out of the public streets and lanes—for in those days there were city lanes green enough and dirty enough for the pigs to pick up something eatable.

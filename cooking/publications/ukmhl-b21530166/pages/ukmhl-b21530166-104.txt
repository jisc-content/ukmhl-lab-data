GOOD CHEER 88 of two pullets was three halfpence, and a fat lamb sixpence, from Christmas to Shrovetide, and the rest of the year fourpence. In 1313 Parliament fixed prices at the rate of £2 8s. of our money for a fat ox, and £3 12s. if it were fed with corn ; a shorn sheep, 5 shillings ; two dozen eggs, 3d. Two centuries later, in the reign of Henry VIII., Parliament settled the price of beef and pork at a halfpenny the pound, and veal at three- farthings. The exchequer accounts of Edward III. show a prodigious consumption of fish, and also the strictness with which the Lenten fast was observed in the royal household. In Edwardian times herring pies were considered as delicious even by royalty. The town of Yarmouth was bound by charter to send a hundred herrings, baked in twenty-four pasties, annually to the King. Various manors were held by the tenure of a similar obligation. Lampreys were a favourite dish of medieval epicures. So great was the demand for this fish in the reign of John, that that monarch issued a royal licence to one Sampson to go to Nantes to purchase lampreys for the eating of the Countess of Blois. The same King issued a mandate to the Sheriffs of Gloucester, that city being famous for producing lampreys, forbidding them, on their first coming in, to be sold for more than two shillings each. In 1341 the sum of £12 5s. 8d. was paid to the sheriffs for forty-four lampreys supplied for the King’s use. It became customary for the corporation of Gloucester to present to the sovereign every Christmas a lamprey-pie as a token of loyalty. Gloucester was not only famous for its Severn lampreys, but for the excellence of its method of stewing them.

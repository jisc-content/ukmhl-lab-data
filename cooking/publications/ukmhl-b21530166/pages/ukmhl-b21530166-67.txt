55 THE FOODS OF THE ANCIENTS Culinary practice, however, was carried almost to the level of a fine art ; one achievement of Roman cooks, for instance, was to dress pork and give it the flavour of any other description of meat they chose. Similarly they counterfeited fish and flesh with vegetable preparations. These were praise- worthy achievements ; but what can be said of their practice of slaughtering young pigs with red-hot spits, so that the blood might not be lost?

When thus brawned to a turn, as the old writer says, a knife was thrust into one of his flanks, and he was allowed to run about till he died. This sounds bad enough, but we are assured that in ancient times the Roman cooks thrust a hot iron into the boar’s side and then ran him to death, thinking thereby that his flesh waxed tenderer and his brawn firmer. The pig, it will be seen, provided no inconsiderable proportion of the flesh food used by the Romans. Their dish called the “ Trojan pig ” saw the animal brought to table whole, in a lifelike attitude, the garnishing of the dish being arranged to heighten the effect.

The Roman women made excellent black puddings and sausage in imitation of those of Greece. The cock, always honoured as a warlike bird, did not at first enjoy a high culinary reputation in Rome. And when that tyrant of the kitchen, C. Fannius,

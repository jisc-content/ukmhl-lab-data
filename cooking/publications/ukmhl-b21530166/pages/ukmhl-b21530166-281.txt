COOKERY-BOOK DIVERSIONS 249 “ Take your Pigeons (if they be not very young cut them into four quarters) one sweet-bred sliced the long way, that it may be thin and the pieces not too big, one Sheep’s tongue, little more than parboyl’d and the skin pul'd off, and the tongue cut in slices, two or three slices of Veale, as much of mutton, young Chickens (if not little, quarter them) chick Heads, lark or any suchlike. Pullets, Cox- combs, Oysters, Calves’ Udder, cut in pieces, good Store of Marrow for seasoning; take as much pepper and salt as you think fit to season it slightly, good store of Sweet Marjoram, a little Time, and Lemon-Pill fine sliced; season it well with these spices as the time of the year will afford; put in either of Chestnuts (if you put in Chestnuts they must be either boyl’d or roasted) Goose berries or Gauge; large Mace will do well in this Pye ; then take a little peece of veal parboyl’d and slice it very fine, as much marrow as meat stirred amongst it; then take grated bread, as much as a quarter of the meat, four yelks of eggs or more according to the Stuff you make ; shread Dates as small as may be, season it with salt. Nutmeg as much as will season it. Sweet Marjoram a pretty store but very small shread, work it up with as much Sweet Creame as will make it up in little puddings, some long, some round, so put as many of them in the Pye as you please ; put therein two or three spoonfulls of Gravy of Mutton, or so much strong Mutton Broth, before you put it in the Oven, the bottome of boyl’d Hartichoks, minced Marrow over and in the bottom of the Pye after your Pye is baked; when you put it up, have some five yelk of Eggs minced, and the juyee of two or three Oranges, the meat of one Lemon cut in peeces, a little White and Claret Wine ; put this in your Pye, being well mingled, and shake it very well together.” By this time you may have lost your pigeons, but you have a pie of delicious richness, worthy of Brillat-Savarin, or any other high-priest of the higher gastronomical mysteries. “ The Accomplished Cook,” by Robert May, was published in 1671, in a third and enlarged edition.

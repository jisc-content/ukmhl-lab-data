342 GOOD CHEER great scene of wretchedness is sketched out by a morsel of indigestible misguided food.” It is related of Fuseli, the artist, that whenever he wished to add weird effects to any painting he had in hand, he invariably ate a hearty supper of pork chops to produce nightmare, from the distorted imaginings of which he derived his inspiration for the gruesome and the grotesque. “ ‘ With Stupidity and sound Digestion ’ (says the satirical sage of ' Sartor Resartus ’) man may front much. But what, in these dull unimaginative days, are the terrors of conscience to the diseases of the liver ? Not on Morality, but on Cookery, let us build our strong- hold. There brandishing our frying-pan, as censer, let us offer sweet incense to the Devil, and live at ease on the fat things he has provided for his Elect." It was held indisputable by the naturalists of the tenth and eleventh centuries that man’s physical con- stitution and even his intellectual character were modified by his food. ^Egidius de Monte says that the Church wisely enjoins the use of fish in Lent because that species of food prohibet loquelam '(” prevents idle chattering ”)—fish being themselves proverbially mute. When Sir John Mandeville, therefore, heard of a people that ate serpents he concluded that they must have something of a reptile character. “In the countree of Yude the more, there is gret plentee of neddres [adders], of whom men maken gret festes, and eten hem at gret sollempnytees. And he that makethe ther a feste, be it never so costisous, and have no neddres, he hath no thanke for his travaylle. ...Thei eten flesche of serpentes, and thei eten but litille, and thei speken nought, but thei hissen as serpentes don." Mandeville was, of course, the famous traveller of the fourteenth century—the same whose reported marvels included “ the vegetable lamb ” and “ the anthropophagi and men whose heads do grow beneath their shoulders.”

The Noachian admonition proceeded to prohibit the eating of blood. “ But flesh with the life thereof, which is the blood thereof, shall ye not eat.” This prohibition is consistently maintained throughout the Old Testament; in Leviticus xvii. lo and ii two reasons are assigned—first, because it is the life of the animal ; secondly, because it is set apart for making atonement. There were other religious reasons which need not be entered into here : it will suffice if it be noted that the Christian brethren were distinctly told to abstain from things offered to idols, from things strangled, and from blood (Acts xv. 20)—an apostolic injunction which was at once a warning against certain heathen practices at religious feasts and a concession to the feelings of Jewish converts. The food of the Hebrews was generally of the simplest kind, as bread, milk, rice, honey, and vege- tables. God had given them every “ green herb for food,” but animal food seems to have been more or less reserved for use at the appointed festivals.

HOSPITALITY 359 but touches nothing himself. In Kamschatka the height of hospitality consists 'in heating the cabin to an intolerable degree ; the meaning of this is said to be a test of the endurance to which the friendship between host and guest may be put. In the making of a feast the greatest, if not the first, consideration concerns itself with the nature of the entertainment. In hospitality the will is the chief thing, said the ancients. There is “ the feast of fat things,” ” the feast of reason with the flow of soul,” and the perpetual feast of nectared sweets “Where no crude surfeit reigns.” Small cheer and great welcome make a merry feast, says the poet. And every guest should be equally welcome. ” A feast not profuse but elegant ; more of salt [refinement] than of expense ” was the etiquette of hospitality practised by the ancients and admired by Montaigne. The true essentials of a feast, says Oliver Wendell Hjolmes, are only ” fun and feed.” The latter, after all, is an essential element, for no one can “ Cloy the hungry edge of appetite By bare imagination of a feast.” In the selection of dishes the most hospitable o;f hosts have sometimes failed to please, through labour- ing under the delusion that the viands they like best themselves are sure to win the approbation of their guests. It is well to remember that tastes are diverse—chacun d son goat. An anecdote of Scott describes the uneasiness of the company once assembled round his hospitable board at the approach of an overkept haunch of venison ; Sir Walter, who was fond of the dish, had very little sense of smell, and was entirely unconscious of anything wrong.

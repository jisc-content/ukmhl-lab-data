CURIOSITIES OF DIET 323 Now to come a little nearer home for a few curious examples. “ I have seen,’’ says one of our great eighteenth-century novelists, describing Scottish hospitality, “ turnips make their appearance, not as a dessert, but by way of hors d’ctuvres, or whets, as radishes are served up betwixt more substantial dishes in France and Italy ; but it must be observed that the turnips of this country are as much superior in sweetness, delicacy, and flavour to those of England, as a musk-melon is to the stock of a common cabbage. They are small and conical, of a yellowish colour, with a very thin skin ; and over and above their agreeable taste, are valuable for their anti- scorbutic quality.” In Scotland broth is, and always has been, held in high regard. But it may not be generally known that in olden times there existed a custom of putting gold into the broth for the sick, especially for con- sumptive patients.

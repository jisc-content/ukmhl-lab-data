374 GOOD CHEER replies, ‘ and it’s rather odd it should be exactly the same dinner I have at home myself—barring the beef.’ ” Here is the other story, which is of similar motif, but not of the same nationality :— “ A man about town having been asked repeatedly to dinner by one whom he knew to be but a shabby Amphitryon, went at last, and found the dinner so meagre and bad that he was scarcely able to eat a bit. When the dishes were being removed the host said, ‘Well, now the ice is broken, I suppose you will ask me to dine with you some day.’ ‘Most willingly,’ ‘Name your day, then.’ ‘Aujourd ’hui, par exemplc,’ answered the dinnerless guest.” The ben trovato round the table should rival in piquancy the gustatory delights upon it. In this spirit let us consider the somatic side of the dinner. In the rationale of the menu, the soup comes first because it is aliment in a form 'which is most readily assimilated ; in a minute or two after taking a clear soup the feeling of exhaustion disappears, and any latent irritability soon begins to give way before a rising sense of good-fellowship round the table. The fish, generally easy of digestion, is well placed second. The third dish should consist of the chief meat, the joint if desired, for this is undoubtedly the place for it if a substantial meal is required. Then the chief nutritious supply having been afforded to the system, the more delicate dishes, eaten in smaller quantity, should follow in an order which makes one complementary of or introductory to the next. If a joint is not presented, a substantial entree— cutlets, or sweetbreads, or something of this nature, daintily cooked and well garnished—may be found acceptable. Next the well-roasted bird, game or poultry, accompanied or followed by a salad ; and after this '(or, if preferred, before the roast) a dish of choice vegetables worthy of being served alone.

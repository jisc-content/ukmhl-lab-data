“THE SACRED RAGE OF HUNGER” 27 in all probability were the successive stages in primi- tive man’s culinary development. Any attempt to trace the history of the Ars coqmnaria throughout the ages from the earliest times to the present, must result in a work that will remain incomplete. To trace the several gradations of re- finement which have occurred in the science of eat- ing in our own country, from the humble tables of our Celtic or Teutonic ancestors to the more studied meals of to-day, would be no small task. But to mark the various and contradictory alterations which have taken place in the art since the period when the abstemious patriarch regaled himself with a morsel of bread, only to the times when the remotest parts of the earth were visited, and the air and the ocean were ransacked in order to furnish the complicated delicacies of a Roman supper—only so much would be too stupendous an undertaking even to contemplate. Where the dwellings of primitive man have been traced on the shores of Scotland, Denmark, and else- where, enormous heaps, which have been called “ kitchen middens,” have been scientifically investi- gated. These have been proved to be the feeding- places of the people who lived there in bygone ages ; they are made up of piles of shells, largely those of the oyster, mussel, periwinkle, and similar creatures on which they fed. With these remains have been found the bones of stags and other animals, and also of birds, as well as the flint knives used in killing and preparing the creatures. These evidences that man cooked and ate animal food date back fifteen thousand years. In the South of France, for instance, are remains of the older Stone Age which show conclusively that primeval man was a mighty hunter, habitually given to feast himself most bountifully on the fruits of the chase.

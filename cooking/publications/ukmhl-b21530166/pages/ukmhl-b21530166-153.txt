TABLE MANNERS OF TUDOR TIMES 131 [shelves] garnyshed with guilt plate, and the nether- most deske was garnyshed all with gold plate.” There was an abundance of plate for use during meals, including “ candlesticks of several branches,” and consequently “ this cupboard was barred round about,” as strong as it was commodious. The credence of the Middle Ages was in the nature of a table and cupboard combined—in fact, a shallow cupboard elevated upon legs, with some- times a shelf underneath. It was used in the dining- halls of noble and wealthy families to carve the meats upon, when the steward or carver would taste a portion off each joint before serving, an ominous but necessary precaution in days when poisoning was a crime of not infrequent occurrence. The credence obtained its name from* its use for ecclesiastical purposes, similar pieces of furniture being used in churches upon which to place the cruets and other, vessels required in the Mass. The modern buffet, or elaborated ” sideboard,” is the lineal descendant of the domestic credence, though perhaps the original buffet, or dressoir, was not a cupboard. The Yeomen of the Guard date from Tudor times, and their popular name. Beefeaters, is generally supposed to be a corruption of Buffetiers, conferred on them as the guardians of the buffet. Dr. Smythe Palmer remorsely upsets this etymology, and asserts that the impression conveyed by the popular name is correct— they were really “ eaters of beef.” This authority says the name Beefeaters was specifically applied to the Yeomen of the Guard in the seventeenth century because they were famous for their consumption of beef. In confirmation Dr. Smythe Palmer quotes Cowley :— “ Chines of beef innumerable send me Or from the stomach of the Guard defend me.”

197 SEASONAL FESTIVALS The mince-pie was regarded with holy aversion by the Puritans ; but Addison, in the Spectator, made mincemeat of their opinions :— “The Christmas pye,” he wrote, “is in its own nature a kind of consecrated cake, and a badge of distinction ; and yet it is often forbidden to the Druid of the family. Strange ! that a sirloin of beef, whether boiled or roasted, when entire, is exposed to his utmost depredations and incisions, but if minced into small pieces and tossed up with plums and sugar, changes its property, and, forsooth, is meat for his master.” Herrick directed among his “ Ceremonies for Christmasse ” that the revellers should “ Drink now the strong beere. Cut the white loaf here. The while the meat is a-shredding; For the rare Mince-Pie And the Plums stand by To fill the Paste that’s a-kneading." Little Jack Horner, the hero of nursery rhyme, was able to find a plum in his Christmas pie, and e’en to make that great discovery without the aid of fork or spoon. It was the admixture of plums with minced meat that gave the pie its distinctive feature. Mince-pies were popular under the name of “ mutton- pies ” as early as 1596, mutton then being one of the ingredients. The paste in which they were made was supposed to imitate the cratch or manger of the Christ-child. As to the “ mince,” it was merely sausage-meat ” at large,” and one form of the spoon meat in universal use before the invention of forks. But there were other items of Christmas fare equally well honoured. No idle cooks were to be found in the old Christmas-time. Early in the morning the “ hackin ” (or great sausage) had to be boiled ready for breakfast. Then commenced the great preparation for dinner.

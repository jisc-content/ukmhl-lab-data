37 Ill THE DIETARY OF THE SCRIPTURES Antediluvian vegetarianism—Flesh food granted—Blood prohibited —Simplicity of Hebrew fare—“ The flesh-pots of Egypt ”— Miracle of the quails—Eastern acridopophaginians—Manna, " the bread of heaven ”—Bread and water—Loaves and fishes —Hebrew hospitality—“The fatted calf”—Rabbinical legend of the fateful “mess of pottage”—“Savoury meat”—“Butter in a lordly dish”—“Milk and honey”—Parched corn—Clean and unclean animals—Birds—And fishes—The paschal lamb— No vegetarian exclusiveness. Biblical students are not quite certain whether the antediluvians were vegetarians, although the weight of opinion leans to that view. One contention is that, the Flood having destroyed the green herb, a flesh food was granted to Noah and his family. When Noah came forth from the ark the Lord, among other admonitions, said, “ Every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you ; even as the green herb have I given you all things.” While some contend that animal food had never before been eaten by man, others are of opinion that from the first institu- tion of sacrifices, a portion of the animals so offered to God were eaten by the offerer, and that this parti- cipation in the offerings formed an integral part of the sacrificial rite ; and that the use of animal food had, until this period, been restricted to the flesh of sacrificed victims.

278 XXIIl GASTROLATORS The belly-god—The gluttons of antiquity—Some brilliant examples —The Sicilians a gluttonous people—The gormandising feast of Nicholas Wood—An appetite not measurable in larks—But possible in geese—Dando, the renowned oyster-eater—The feats of his Irish rival—The appetite of an ogre—A depraved appetite for putrid meat—The judicial opinion of “ nae gor- mandeeser”—The glutton and his conscience. Those who make their belly their god, Rabelais calls Gastrolators. Of these there are divers sorts. Beside the epicure and the gourmand there are, at the other extremity of the pole, the glutton, and the gorger. Pandarea, a celebrated eater of antiquity, could pass days and nights at the table without experiencing the slightest indigestion. His life was a continual sacrifice to his god. The Emperor Septimus Severus died of eating and drinking too much. Valentinianus went off in a surfeit. Maximilian devoured in one day forty pounds of solid meat, which he washed down with a hogshead of wine. Philoxenes wished he had a neck like a crane, that the delicious morsels might be long in going down. Lucullus, at a costly feast which he gave to certain Ambassadors of Asia, among other trifles, took to his own portion a “ griph ” boiled, and a fat goose in paste. A “ griph ” was doubtless some particularly choice specimen of a “ fearful wild fowl ”—not improbably a ger-falcon.

SEASONAL FESTIVALS 207 The hospitality of the old-fashioned harvest supper is now almost a thing of the past. The Harvest Festivals of the Church seem to have taken its place. Another forgotten festival was Lammas, kept on the first of August. It was of pagan origin, and celebrated the realisation of the first-fruits of the earth, and more particularly the grain harvest. When Christianity was introduced the day continued to be observed as a festival on these grounds, and from a loaf being the usual offering at church, the service on that day came to be called “ Hlaf-mass ” or “ Loaf-mass,” subsequently shortened to Lammas. Allied with these industrial celebrations was the Bean Feast or Wayzgoose. This was the annual feast given to workpeople and apprentices in other forms of labour by their employers. The former name indicates that it originally occurred in the bean season, when that article of diet entered largely into the bill of fare on such occasions ; the other term shows that sometimes the crowning dish of the entertainment was a wayz-goose—that is, a stubble goose, wayz literally meaning “ a bundle of straw.” In Northumberland, at the great winter slaughter- ing of beasts, at Martinmas, puddings were made by stuffing the entrails with “ pudding-meat,” con- sisting of blood, suet, and groats ; when boiled they were called black-puddings. It is interesting to note that a similar celebration took place in Germany, and it was called the “ feast of sausages.” This day was a great festival on the Continent, the new wines then being tasted for the first time. Naturally the three great epochs in the life of a man—his entrance into the world, his selection of his life’s partner, and his departure from the world —have been made the occasion of religious obser- vances, all of them duly accompanied by appro- priate feastings.

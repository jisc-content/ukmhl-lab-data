One of the most striking evidences of the magnificence of the feasts of the Norman Court is daily before our eyes in that finest of European halls, the one at Westminster : that hall, we are told by Stow, was built by William Rufus for his dining- room.

First of all, a recipe in “ The Forme of Cury ” for cabbage soup illustrates the enduring nature of some culinary practices :— “Caboches in pottage.

201 SEASONAL FESTIVALS On the Palm Sunday, and in some parts on the previous Sunday (knovm as Carling Sunday), it was customary to eat carlings—grey peas, steeped all night in water, and fried the next day with butter. The child-rhyme was :— “ Care Sunday, care away Palm Sunday and Easter day.” A soup made of grey peas and bacon was formerly given away to their customers by all Black Country innkeepers on the Shrove Tuesday, or Fasten’s E’en as it was sometimes called. The Shrove Monday was called Collop Monday because on that day the people took leave of a flesh diet, either of fresh or of salted meat. The collops were sometimes large slices of bacon. The Saturday was known in some parts as Egg Saturday for a corresponding reason. Though the fast days of Lont were rigorously observed in pre-Reformation times, the English were not above indulging in fish-pies of a specially rich and delicious make. On the Mid-Lent Sunday, commonly known as Mothering Sunday, because the young married couples made a practice of visiting their parents’ homes on this day, the customary dinner in many parts of England consisted of a roast loin of veal and a laid pudding—the latter so called because it con- sisted of layers of raisins and currants, alter- nating with delicious custard-soaked teacakes. Michaelmas Sunday, at the opposite season of the year, saw the Michaelmas goose on the table ; a young stubble-fed bird, tender and juicy, and quite distinct in flavour from the super-fatted Christmas goose. As just mentioned, the same savoury dish also appeared six weeks later, at Martinmas.

GOOD CHEER 330 or perhaps longed for the introduction into European kitchens of the reindeer of Labrador. Our resources for the chief item in the bill of fare are miserably restricted to two animals—pork being generally omitted, notwithstanding the eloquence of Elia—and for the major part of the year to three or four birds. Fortunately, though the animals are only two, the meats are four ; veal and lamb, in their season, being welcome changes from the beef and mutton. It is the genius of the cook to produce from this daily monotony of raw material the greatest possible variety in the finished article—the dish agree- ably welcome in the novelty of its presentment. Vegetarianism in itself has much to recommend it, but the cult fails to make wholesale conversions of the generous feeder, because it is too often associated with the eccentricities of the food-faddists—of the herbarians who try to get as near to grass-eating as possible ; of the fruitarians, and other cranks who bar the way to a health-reform diet by ranting about “ scorched corpse,” and employing other extrava- gances of language which repel rather than invite. And when they talk about vegetarianism enabling a man to live well on twopence a day, the economist is forced to remember that where a people do subsist at that rate wages generally fall to a “ twopence a day ” level.

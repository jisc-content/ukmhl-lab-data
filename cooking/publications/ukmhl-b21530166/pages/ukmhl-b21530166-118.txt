98 GOOD CHEER As in those days the rapacity and insolence of the royal purveyors, who never paid above half-price, and in many instances not at all, was a crying griev- ance in the land, it is worthy of note that Reginald is commanded to bay the various commodities, and to purchase them at the proper time and place—i.e.^ at fair prices. The next precept is addressed to the Sheriff of Bucks, and was, therefore, most probably sent by the hands of the purveyor as a voucher for the articles thus purchased ; it directs that 500 hens and 20 swine be bought in the accustomed market, and also that pheasants, partridges, and other birds be sent from the manor (probably the honour of Wallingford). Then follows a precept to Matthew Mantell, to pur- chase 200 head of pork and 1,000 hens, then another “ to John, the son of Hugh,” apparently a keeper in one of the forests, to send to Windsor, brushwood, charcoal, torches, and cyphes^ a sufficiency ; also 500 hens, with pheasants and other birds ; and lastly, a precept addressed to the Sheriff of Canterbury to send 10,000 salt eels ! The charge is often brought against the old monkish historians that they are always given to exaggeration, and that their descriptions of great feasts are particularly open to this charge. Much argument has been expended to prove that provisions could not be obtained in the quantities which these chroniclers mention. One controversialist, shocked at the wholesale falsehoods of Matthew Paris, who records that on one occasion a repast consisting of thirty thousand dishes was served up in Westminster Hall, gravely informs us that unless the ancient hall had been much larger than the present, it could not, setting the guests and their attendants out of the question, even have contained the dishes—forgetful that dinners usually consist of three or four courses.

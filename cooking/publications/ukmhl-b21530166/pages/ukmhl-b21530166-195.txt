Although the English have always been, more or less, a carnivorous nation, let it not be overlooked that “ the roast beef of Old England,” considered as the typical national food, is pure myth. The vain-glorious vaunts of the favourite old patriotic song date only from the early part of the eighteenth century ; the words have been ascribed to Henry Fielding, and the tune was composed by a man named Leveridge, a famous singer of that period. The sentiments it expresses at once betray its origin. “ When mighty roast beef was the Englishman’s food It ennobled our hearts and enriched our blood ; Our soldiers were brave and our courtiers were good, Oh ! the roast beef of Old England And oh ! for old England’s roast beef.

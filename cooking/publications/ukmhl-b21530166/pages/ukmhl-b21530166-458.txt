GOOD CHEER 410 plucked hung upon the branches, Sancho saw be- wildering quantities of venison and wild fowl hanging about on the branches of trees ; he counted skins full of wines, and hillocks of white loaves and cheeses piled up in the manner of stacked bricks. And as the feast was to be a Spanish one there were ready two cauldrons of oil, larger than dyers’ vats, for the inevitable frying. In this Rabelaisian description of a nuptial feast, Cervantes has been accused of a sly satire on the characteristic frugality of his countrymen, the bulk of whom are generally content with a meal of chocolate, bread, garlic, and grapes. Scott, in the “ Lay of the Last Minstrel,” gives us a picturesque description of the marriage feast of Cranston and the Lady Margaret :— “ The spousal rites were ended soon, 'Twas now the merry hour of noon. And in the lofty-arched hall Was spread the gorgeous festival ; Steward and squire, with heedful haste. Marshalled the rank of every guest; Pages, with ready blade, were there. The mighty meal to carve and share. O’er capon, heron-shew, and crane. And princely peacock’s gilded train. And o’er the boar-head, garnished brave, And cygnet from St. Mary’s wave, O’er ptarmigan and venison, The priest had spoke his benison. Then rose the riot and the din, Above, beneath, without, within ! For, from the lofty balcony. Rang trumpet, shalm, psaltery; Their clanging bowls old warriors quaffed. Loudly they spoke, and loudly laughed; Whispered young knights, in tone more mild. To ladies fair, and ladies smiled. The hooded hawks, high perched on beam. The clamour joined with whistling scream. And flapped their wings, and shook their bells. In concert with the stag-hounds’ yells.

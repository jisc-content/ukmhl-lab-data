103 BARONIAL PROFUSION constables, heralds, guards, pursuivants, pages, and trumpeters, and his jester. ■When all the guests and retainers were assembled, the master steward knocked loudly on the oaken board, the blessing was chanted, and every one seated himself according to his rank, the noble and gentle on the dais, and also at the central table till they came to the huge silver salt-cellar, the line of de- marcation below which the common people sat. Any caitiff who presumed to sit out of his order, stood a chance of being pelted by the company with the bones they had picked. Then came in the train of servants bearing the pewter dishes loaded with beef and mutton, fresh and salted, fowls and fish, pasties and loaves, wastel and simnel bread, the strange and numerous compounds which formed the dessert, and the flagons of wine, ale, and beer which were freely served to the com- pany by troops of waiters—to the higher guests in silver cups, to the lower tables in cups of pewter, horn, or wood. Beeves, sheep, pigs, geese, fowls, venison, and game were washed down with copious draughts of English ale or foreign wine. The extent of a baronial larder may be gauged by the stores recorded as stolen from one of the baronies of the elder Des- penser in the reign of Edward II.— 8o carcasses of beef, 600 carcasses of mutton, and 601 flitches of bacon. For three hours or more the company sat at this meal, now and then bursting into uproarious laughter at the jokes of the jester, or at the pranks of tumblers, jugglers and buffoons. Digestion was also aided by the minstrels who discoursed sweet music in the gallery. The English minstrel may be considered the lineal descendant of the ancient Scandinavian skald, or else.

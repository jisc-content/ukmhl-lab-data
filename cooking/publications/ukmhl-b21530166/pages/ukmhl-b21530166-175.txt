INTRODUCTION OF FORKS 153 It is worth remembering that good specimens of old Bow china are to be met with in the form of knife and fork handles—a fine, hard, artistic ware of the middle of the eighteenth century, more fre- quently seen in dishes, comptiers, and dessert services. Till the reign of William and Mary dainty “ bride knives ” were in vogue—orthodox wedding presents which the bride wore suspended from her girdle ; and some fine specimens of which emanated from Sheffield in the early days of its industrial development. The word “ fork ” occurs twice in the Bible : once in the Pentateuch, where mention is made of the “ flesh forks,” evidently referring to those which were used to take the meat out of the pot ; the other in- stance is in an account of the riches of Solomon’s temple, where, singularly enough, the Vulgate has the word furca, which the English translation renders as spoon. Did the ancients eat “ from hand to mouth,” or did they, as many authorities contend, use table forks? Does the Greek word kreagra indicate a fork for the table, or merely a flesh-hook by which the cook hauled the mass of boiled meat out of the pot? The flesh-hook mentioned in i Samuel ii. 13 was a three-pronged fork used by the priests for drawing out the flesh from the kettle or cauldron. What are we to imderstand by the Latin words furca, fur cilia? Beckmann asserts distinctly that the ancients had no table forks. It must not be forgotten that the food put upon the table by the ancients was always more tender and easier of digestion than much of that served now, and also that it was invariably cut into tiny pieces before being served up. The guests did not sit at tables, but reclined on couches, a posture which did not leave both hands at liberty. Persons of rank

FORKS AND REFINEMENT 159 food, the methods of preparing them, and their effect on the health. Another writer in a work on ban- queting gives a number of menus, which are also very informative. From the information furnished by these and other writers of the period we learn that Italian dinners of the sixteenth century were divided into two parts, each consisting of several courses. Some of the courses came from the “ Credenza ” (credence or buffet) and some direct from the kitchen ; the former, of course, being cold, as cold meats, pies, salt fish, caviare and other relishes to stimulate the appetite, fruits, pastry, and confectionery ; and the latter, hot, carried straight to the carver, to be placed on the table immediately they had been cut up by him. The dinner began with a course from the credenza and was followed by a hot dish from the “ servizio di cucina.” Three or four of each thus alternated, each course comprising at a great banquet as many as twenty or thirty dishes. The sweetmeats, fruits, and confectionery were handed round after the removal of the table-cloth. A dinner of this kind lasted three or four hours. Among the viands served at such entertainments we may read of Pisan and Roman biscuits with Malmsey wine served in little golden cups, cakes, some gilt and some moulded into exquisitely artistic shapes, pine-kernels, oranges, fritters made of chick- peas, sugar, raisins, and dates ; in another course of large lampreys, slices of sturgeon roasted on the spit (each with an appropriate sauce), grilled shad with a sauce of raisins boiled in wine, small lampreys from the Tiber, pickled carp served cold with a sauce of sugar and red vinegar, pies of large lampreys, olives from Crete, and fish jelly made in a form with orna- ments of “ mezzo-rilievo.” The second course from the kitchen would extend to sixteen or twenty iterns.

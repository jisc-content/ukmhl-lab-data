THE FOODS OF THE ANCIENTS 59 of Patrocles peeling onions or of Achilles washing cabbages. Though the wise Ulysses roasted, with his own hands, a sirloin of beef, vegetables occupied the most conspicuous places at all the great banquets of ancient Greece, The Romans, too, had such liking for leguminous plants that their most illustrious families did not disdain to borrow their names from them. The appellations Fabius, Cicero, and Lentulus thus enhanced the humble renown of beans {faba), peas {cicer arietiniim), and lentils {lenticuld). Cicero, it is related of the great orator, one day gave the preference to a dish of beetroot, instead of oysters and lampreys, of which he was passionately fond. The lentil derived its name from lentus (slow), because it was believed the moisture in this pea produced heaviness of mind, and rendered men deliberate and reserved, if not, indeed, indolent and lazy. The Greeks honoured King Miletus as the inventor of grinding-stones ; the upper part, as used by them, was of wood, and armed with the heads of iron nails. A passage of Homer, it is interesting to note, would lead us to believe that the grain was first crushed with roller on iron slabs and afterwards milled between the grinding-stones. Two centuries before the Christian era the victorious Romans carried with them into Asia their handmills ; soon after this the nobler conquest of industry gave them mills obedient to the power of horses or asses. They then set up, as the patroness and protectress of mills and mill- stones, the goddess Mola, whom they honoured on June 9th, upon which day all mills were silent throughout the land. Bread was invented either by the Egyptians or the Hebrews. The Greeks are said to have had more than fifty varieties of bread, and it was from them the Romans learnt the art of making it.

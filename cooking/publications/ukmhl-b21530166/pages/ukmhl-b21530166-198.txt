176 GOOD CHEER clumsy-looking piece of furniture, made of stout English oak, but very much dilapidated. The epithet “ mutton-eating king ” was said to have been conferred on Charles II. by his favourite, Lord Rochester. Rochester had been the King’s companion in the years of his exile, during which time they had often to dine on what they could get, and the epithet is generally supposed to have refer- ence to their starvation diet. With regard to England’s typical joint of beef another suggestion is that the travestied honour was conferred upon it by Queen Elizabeth. The lines in which the audacious suggestion is made occur in one of those spurious “ old ballads ” which date back no farther than the beginning of the last century ;— “Elizabeth Tudor her breakfast would make On a pot of strong beer and a pound of beefsteak Ere six in the morning was tolled by the chimes— Oh, the days of Queen Bess, they were merry Old Times ! From hawking and hunting she rode back to town In time just to knock an ambassador down. Toy’d, trifled, coqueted, then lopped off a head. And at three-score-and-ten danced a hornpipe to bed. With Nicholas Bacon, her councillor chief, One day she was dining on English roast beef— That very same day when her Majesty’s grace Had given Lord Essex a slap on the face. My Lord Keeper stared, as the wine cup she kissed, At his sovereign lady’s superlative twist; And thought, thinking truly his larder would squeak. He’d much rather keep her a day than a week. ‘ What call you this dainty, my very good lord ?' ‘The loin’—bowing low till his nose touched the board. ‘And—breath of our nostrils and light of our eyes— Saving your presence, the ox was a prize.’

FISH. 66 as will cover them, a few slices of onions and carrots, a bunch of sweet herbs, some salt, and a little nutmeg. When done enough, pour over them a sauce Italienne (see Fish Sauces), and serve. 177. Whitings a l’Italienne. Wash, clean, and skin them; cut off the tads and fins, and lay them in a marinade for four hours, made with oil, lemon-juice, slices of onion, and whole parsley leaves. Strain them, egg and bread-crumb them, and fry them of a fine golden colour—this is best done with oil. (A real Italian recipe.) 178. Mackerel 1 la MaJtre d’H6tel. Choose large, fresh, soft-roed mackerel; cut off the fins, point of the tails and heads, and make an incision an inch deep down the back; lay them in a dish, strew salt and pepper over them, also half a pint of sweet oil, an onion cut in rings, and some whole parsley. Leave the mackerel to marine in this for about two hours turning them over from time to time. Half an hour before serving rub a gridiron with oil, take out the fish and wipe them, sprinkle them with a little salt, and lay them an inch apart on the gridiron over a slow fire. Do them on one side till they are of a good colour, then turn them over and do the other. Lay them on their backs for five minutes, when they will be ready to dish. Open when dished the backs with a spoon, and intro- duce a piece of butter, mixed with salt, pepper, minced parsley, and the juice of a lemon. The marinade may be served with the mackerel.

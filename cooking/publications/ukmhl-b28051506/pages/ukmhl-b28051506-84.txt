FISH. 56 some parsley minced very fine; put them to cook in a moderate oven. While they are doing pour over them a glass of -white -svine and one of stock. When they are nearly ready, put them carefully, so as not to break them, into a saucepan; add to the sauce a spoonful of cullis, a piece of butter, a very little essence of ancho-vy, and the squeeze of a lemon. Keep them on the fire a fe-w minutes and arrange them on the dish they are to be served on. 154. Whitings as in Scotland. Choose small perfectly fresh fish, rub them in flour till it adheres ; lay them in a fryingpan with a good bit of butter; saut4 them very slowly. They should not be dry or coloured. Mince some parsley and green onions or chives very fine; put them into some good broth and about two tablespoonfuls of cream ; mix it well together and pour it over the whitings before they are quite finished cooking; move them about very gently, not to break them, till they are done. They are very delicate and excellent done in this way, which, though simple, requires great care. No butter should be used but what is required to fry them. 155. Fkied Fillets of Whiting. Cut about six small whitings in two from top to bottom, take the fillets, lay them to marinade for about an hour, in equal proportions of -vinegar, white -wine, and water ; add salt, green onions, a few blades of mace, and some whole pepper; dry them; toss them in a heap of fine flour. Have ready a pan of hot lard, and fry all together

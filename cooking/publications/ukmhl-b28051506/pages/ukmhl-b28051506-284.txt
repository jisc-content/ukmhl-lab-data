Take twenty-five apricots cut into pieces ; break the stones; take out the kernels; peel, and crush them in a mortar; put all together into a jar with half a pound of sugar, eight cloves, some cinnamon, and a quart of brandy; stop the jar very close; let it infuse three weeks; shake it very often; pass through a straining-hag, and bottle. Peaches are very good done in the same manner. 708. Noyeau. Take a handful of the young sprouts of the peach-tree; pour over them two quarts of brandy; let it stand three days to extract the fine flavour of the leaves, then take them out and add to the brandy two quarts of clarified sugar, and a quarter of a pound of bitter almonds, blanched and cut small; let it stand six weeks, then strain and bottle. Another method is to beat all to- gether in a mortar half a pound of apricot kernels with the skins on, two drachms of cinnamon, six cloves, two ounces of coriander seed, and four pounds of the finest sugar; infuse all this in four quarts of the best brandy in an earthen jar with a narrow mouth, not too closely corked, for a month, often shaken, and exposed as much to the sun as possible; then strain and bottle. These liqueurs are very useful for flavouring jellies, creams, etc.

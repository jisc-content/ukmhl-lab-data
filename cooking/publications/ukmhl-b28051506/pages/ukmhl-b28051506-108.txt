78 FISH. 210. Method of Kippering Salmon. The largest fish are best. To twenty pounds of salmon put one and a half pounds of salt, one pound of raw sugar, and two ounces of saltpetre. Mix all well together. Wash the fish well in salt and water; split it up the back, cut off the head, and take out the backbone. Eub it well inside with the mixture; lay it in a deep dish with the inside uppermost ; leave it in the pickle twenty-four hours ; then put a heavy weight on it; ■press it for two days, or three if a large fish. Take it out of the pickle and hang it to dry in the sun.

19 SOUPS. 33, Bouillabaise A l’Anglatse. As the preceding receipt is often considered too strong for the English palate, this is in a milder form; it is excellent, and exceedingly nourishing and wholesome for an invalid. Take cod, mullet, whiting, turbot, or any other fish you like ; cut them cross ways, in pieces of from about two ounces to a quarter of a pound each. Slice two good-sized onions, place them in a stew-pan large enough to contain all the fish at the bottom,—a shallow pan is best. Add two tablespoonfuls of olive-oil; fry the onions a light brown; put in the fish with as much warm water as win cover them well, a teaspoonful of salt, half a one of pepper, half a bay leaf, the fiesh of half a peeled lemon cut in dice, two tomatoes cut in slices and their seeds » removed, two small glasses of sherry or other white wine, a few peppercorns, and half a clove of garlic. Set on a fierce fire, and boil very fast for twelve minutes, or till the hquor is reduced to one-third. Then add a tahlespoon- ful of chopped parsley, let it boil one minute longer, and pour it into a deep dish over slices of bread the same as the other. This is also very good made with all sorts of fresh-water fish, and the garlic may be entirely omitted. 34. Oystek Soup. Take eighty oysters and their liquor; place them in a pan with salt, cayenne pepper, and a teaspoonful of chopped chervil; when boiling add three yolks of eggs beat up in half a pint of cream, and serve. This is enough for five persons. If the oysters have not sufficient liquor, a little water and salt may be added, and parsley may be used, if preferred, instead of chen'-il.

Strain through a jelly-bag into a mould, and set it in a cool place or on the ice till wanted to serve. 603. Orange-Jelly. Take twelve oranges ; cut each in two ; squeeze them through a silk sieve into a dish ; rub the peel of three of the oranges off on a lump of sugar, and scrape off all the yellow part, which gives the jelly a fine flavour; break half a pound of sugar into small pieces ; put it in a pan; beat the white of half an egg up with water till it gets white, and add it to the sugar; let it reduce till it begins to bubble, then pour in the juice of the oranges. Tlie heat of the sugar will clarify the jelly. Do not let it boil, but as soon as you perceive a yellow scum, skim the jelly, and pour it through a jelly-bag. Boil an ounce of isinglass in three-quarters of a pint of water for two hours, and when the jelly is nearly cold mix it ■with it. When the jelly is cold, hut not before, pour it into a mould to set. Lemon-jelly is made in the same •way, but requires rather more sugar. 604. Orange Sponge Jelly.

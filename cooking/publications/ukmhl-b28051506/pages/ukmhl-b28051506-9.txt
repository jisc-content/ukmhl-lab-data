PREFACE TO SIXTH EDITION. It lias naturally been a great gratification to the compiler of Dainty Dishes to find, from the number of editions already issued, that it has been so â– well received by the public, and it gives her reason to hope that the wish she expressed at the end of her Preface to the First Edition, and which, indeed, was her only object in publishing the volume, has been in some measure fulfilled; and however undeserved she has felt the many favourable criticisms she ha,s read upon her perfectly unpretending work, they have not the less given her sincere pleasure, and they encourage her now to offer a small Appendix of re- ceipts she has collected since her arrival in Germany. One or two writers have taken exception to the title Dainty Dishes, contending that what was inexpensive, or equal to the means of the poor.

XU I PREFACE. These are not at all offered as extraordinary speci- mens of a German bill of fare, for the writer could give many more curious, but they have fallen re- cently under her observation, and she thinks they sufficiently mark a difference between German and English dinners. Although in their every-day life Germans fare simply, yet when they think it necessary to give what they call a ‘ Eeine Diner,’ it is a tremendous and everlasting affair, consisting of not less than sixteen or eighteen courses, thus arranged :— 1st Course, 2d Course, 3d Course, Ath Course, 5th Course, 6th Course, 7th Course, 8th Course, 9th Course, 10th Course, lli^ Course, Two soups, clear and thick. Caviar, oysters, etc. Little patties, croquets, otc. Fish, dressed and plain. The large joints of meat. Vegetables dressed, with accompaniments, such as raw ham, smoked geese-breasts, tongue, and different sorts of sausages. Entries, with white sauce. Entries, with brown sauce. Cold entries, such as lobster salad, etc. Game, both birds and beasts, with salad. Fine dressed vegetables, such as young peas, asparagus, etc. Compots, both from fresh and preserved fruits. 12th Cdurse,

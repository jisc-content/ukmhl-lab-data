216 PUDDINGS, JELLIES, PASTKY, ETC. 592. Fastnachts Krapfen. This is a German cake which is eaten on Shrove Tues- day, as pancakes are in England; it is very good, and is made in the following manner:â€”Take a pint of luke- warm milk, six ounces of butter, two ounces of sugar, six yolks of eggs, and two ounces of yeast. Mix all this well together with as much flour as will make a paste, just stiff enough to roll out; then with a round cutter cut out cakes about the diameter of an orange, and an inch and a half thick; put them on a board in a warm place to rise, and then fry them in hot lard from flve to ten minutes, so that they may acquire a nice brown colour; drain them on blotting-paper to free them from fat, sprinkle them with sugar, and serve very hot. It is usual before they rise to open them and introduce a spoonful of jelly or marmalade, and to glaze the outside with egg. 593. Almond .Paste. Blanch and pound one pound of Jordan almonds very fine, adding a spoonful of orange-flower water while pounding, to keep them from oiling; add three-quarters of a pound of fine sifted sugar ; stir it together over a gentle fire to dry off the moisture; when it becomes a stiff paste take it out of the pan and put it into pots to keep. It is useful for many things, iceing of cakes, etc. 594. Almond Cups. Roll out some of the above paste, and form cups of it in moulds; bake them in a slow oven, and fill with whipt cream, custard, or preserves.

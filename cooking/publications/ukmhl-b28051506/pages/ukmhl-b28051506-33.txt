Take a neck of mutton; cut off it as many chops as you wish to serve in the broth j put the remainder into a pan with carrots and turnips, stir it to prevent its getting thick, and skim carefully; let it bod four hours, then strain it through a sieve, and add the cutlets and carrots and turnips cut into dice or any shape you fancy, and boil tiU they are tender; season with pepper and salt. A httle raw parsley chopped very tine may be added just before serving. 7. Beef Broth, or Broth a la Mode. Put into a soup-pot twelve lbs. of the sticJcing piece of beef from a young ox, with the kernels and sweetbreads ; pour on sufficient cold water to cover the meat; set the pot over a quick tire, and carefully attend to the scum rising, so that it may all be removed before it can boil into the broth. After the first scum is removed, imme- diately throw in some cold water, which wdl cause more to rise. When this is removed, place the pot by the side of a stove to bod slowly for four hours ; then strain the broth through a napldn, which should be kept for the purpose; take care of the kernels and sweetbreads, which you return to the broth, together with four carrots and turnips, a head of celery and two onions ; these should be cut in good-sized pieces with a round cutter. Con- tinue boiling the broth till the vegetables are quite tender; season and serve. Be careful to remove any fat that may rise in the second boiling.

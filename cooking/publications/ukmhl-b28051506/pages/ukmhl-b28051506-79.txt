SAUCES. 51 turbot, sole, or whiting; it should be of the consistence of thick cream. 140. Good Sauce for Fillets of Sole. Two hard-boiled eggs, one raw yolk, and a little cream ; mix very smooth with a tablespoonful of tarragon or elder vinegar. Put it into a stewpan, heat without boiling, season with pepper and salt, and pour over the fillets. 141. Melted Butter. * This, however simple, is rarely well done. Mix in the proportion of a teaspoonful of flour to four ounces of the best butter as much as you require- on a plate, then put it into a small saucepan with three tablespoonfuls of hot water or milk; boil it quick for a minute, shaking it all the time. Another way is to cut two ounces of butter in small pieces, put it into a very clean saucepan with a large teaspoonful of flour and two tablespoonfuls of milk; hold it over the fire, and. shake it round constantly the same way till it begins to simmer, then let it stand quietly and boil up. Care must be talcen that the butter does not oil. The yolk of an egg is a great improvement. 142. Sauce Hollandaise. Four tablespoonfuls of elder vinegar boiled with a little salt, a teaspoonful of flour^ and a blade of mace. Beat up the yolks of five eggs; cut about a quarter of a pound of butter into thin slices ; put these into the hot vinegar, shake and mix well, stirring continually. It must not be put on the fire after the eggs and butter are added.

XVll PREFACE. 6. English poor family might take many a hint from their German neighbours, and not only satisfy, but gratify, their appetites at a very small cost. The Scotch are much more like the Germans, and their soups, porridge, and cakes have great affinity with the ‘Briihen Suppen’ and ‘Kuchen’ of this coimtry. The collector hopes that some of the receipts now offered may find favour with the British public, and that the critics who have been so kind to the ‘Dainty Dishes’ already published, will not be less lenient to those emanating from a foreign land. Derneburg, November 27, 1866.

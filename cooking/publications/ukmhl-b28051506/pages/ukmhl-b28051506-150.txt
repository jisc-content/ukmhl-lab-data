Put in the bottom of the pie-dish a good beef-steak, not cut too thick; truss and prepare six young pigeons, ar- range them in the dish, between each place the yolk of a hard-boiled egg; season with a quarter of an ounce of mixed salt and pepper, a sprinkle of minced parsley, and a very little cayenne pepper; add a wineglassful of veal stock, cover with a puff-paste not too thick, and bake one hour. 316. Chicken Pie. Cut the chickens in joints; blanch them; season with pepper and salt, a mixed spoonful of chopped mushrooms, parsley, and onions ; add a few slices of ham or bacon. A layer below and one above the chicken arranged in the pie-dish is best. Fill it up with veal gravy in which you have previously boiled a few mushrooms ; put in also the yolks of six hard-boiled eggs. A little lemon-juice may also be added. Cover with puff-paste, and bake rather more than an hour. 317. Casserolles of Eice. Boil the rice well, and let it stand till nearly cold; then make it into round rolls with a small shape about the depth of a pattie. Cover them with egg and bread- crumbs, and fry them of an even light colour. When cold scoop out the inside, and fill them with either minced veal or chicken, well stewed with parsley and shallot, and mixed with a bechamel sauce. Make them hot, and serve with fried parsley.

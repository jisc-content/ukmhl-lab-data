I J FISH. 208, Oysters Stewed in their own Juice (Scotch). This is an excellent method of dressing them. Take the largest you can get ; wash them clean through their own juice; lay them close together in a frying-pan ; sprinkle them with a little salt. Do not put one above another. Make them a fine brown on both sides. If one panful is not sufficient, do off more. When they are all done, pour some of their liquor into the pan, mixing it with any that may be left from their cooking. Let it bod a minute or two. Pour it over the oysters, and serve very hot. 209. To Pot Char or Trout. Three teaspoonfuls of black pepper and allspice mixed, two of mace, one each of cloves and nutmeg. Keep them well corked up in a small bottle ; when used add a little salt. This is a sufficient quantity for fourteen pounds of fish. Cut open the fish; clean them well with a dry cloth, but do not wash. Remove the heads, tails, fins, and backbone; then rub the spices weU into them. Put them with the spices into a baking dish; cover well with fresh butter, and place the dish in a slow oven, to remain till the bones are dissolved, which will take about five hours. Drain off the butter, and put the fish into pots; press it down firmly, and pour a thin layer of fresh butter over the top. The trout should be red- fleshed, and not exceeding three-quarters of a pound in weight. Other fish, such as eels, sprats, etc., or slirimps and prawns, may be done in the same way. The spices must all be ground.

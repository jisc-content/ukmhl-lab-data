MEAT, POULTRY, GAME, 102 veal into a stew-pan, with an onion and a bunch of sweet herbs. Let it boil rather more than half an hour; strain and thicken it with white roux and a little cream; beat up the collops in this; add salt and pepper, and the squeeze of a lemon. A little finely-minced parsley may be added. 268. Jugged Hare. Cut the hare in moderate-sized pieces, wash it and put it into a stone jar, just large enough to hold it, with a bunch of sweet herbs, some lemon-peel, a large onion with five cloves stuck in it, a quarter of a pint of port or claret wine, and the juice of a lemon; tie the top of the jar down with a bladder, so that no steam may escape ; put the jar into a saucepan of boiling water sufficiently deep to cover it; keep the water boiling nearly three hours. Take it out, strain the gravy from the fat, and thicken it with flour and give it a boil up; lay the hare on the dish, and pour the sauce over it. Serve with currant jelly. 269. Canard A la Bearnoise. Stew a duck in a little broth, half a glass of white wine, a bunch of parsley, thyme, sweet basd, and small onions, two bay leaves, and two cloves. Put into another stew- pan seven or eight large onions cut in slices and a bit of butter; pass them on the fire, turning often till they get a colour ; then add a good pinch of flour; moisten with the liquor the duck was stewed in; stew the onions and reduce the sauce ; skim off the fat, and add a squeeze of lemon or a few drops of vinegar, pour it over the duck, and serve.

8 SOUPS. 11. Friarâ€™s Chicken, clear. Take two or tliree chickens cut in quarters, as for a fricassee, and a small piece of lean beef; put them in four quarts of boiling water; when nearly done enough, which will he in about two hours, add some finely-minced parsley. Do not leave it on the fire more than ten minutes after this; the minute before serving stir in quickly two eggs previously well beaten together. Atten- tion should be paid to skimming, and it is more delicate if the skins of the chickens are removed. Chickens ... 3 Lean beef ... 2 lbs. Eggs ... 2 To be boiled 2|- hours; seasoned to taste. 12. Knuckle of Veal and Dice Soup. To a knuckle of veal well scalded add three quarts of veal stock, three ounces of rice, a blade of mace, and a sprig of thyme; when it has boiled two hours and a half put into it one onion and two heads of celery cut fine; let it boil half an hour longer; season with salt, take out the large bones, and serve. A fowl and rice may be done in the same way, but will not take so long. 13. Potato Soup.

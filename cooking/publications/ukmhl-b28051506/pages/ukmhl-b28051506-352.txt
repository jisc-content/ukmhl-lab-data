322 ADDITIONAL KECEIPTS. 3. A Good Sauce to Eat with cold Paktiudge, Pheasant, etc. Three tablespoonfuls of calves-feet jelly, three of salad oil, two of tarragon vinegar, some very finely minced tar- ragon and shalot, a little pepper and salt; all to be worked together till it becomes a thick smooth sauce. 4. Sauce a la Diable, to Eat with Wild Boak’s Head, but it is good with most Cold Meats. The yolks of four hard-boiled eggs well mashed down, six tablespoonfuls of red wine, four of the best oil, two mus- tard spoons of mustard, the juice of two lemons, a little vinegar, some finely minced shalot, a little pepper, salt, and sugar; to be carefully mixed and stirred till the oil is thoroughly incorporated. 5. Cumbekland Sauce. Stir a spoonful of English mustard flour into red wine till it is quite smooth, mix with this half a pot of red-currant jelly, and a good quantity of very flnely peeled and minced bitter orange-skin ; if too thick, add more red wine. Another, and, we think, stiU better way of making this sauce, is to prepare a usual mayonnaise sauce (see Sauces), adding rather more mustard than usual, and stirring into it a tablespoonful of currant jelly and one of red wine ; it should look like a red mayonnaise. This sauce is good to eat with almost any kind of cold meat, but in Germany is ahnost exclusively served with wild boar’s meat or head.

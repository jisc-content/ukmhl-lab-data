Bread, meat, and water ought also to be taken for the dogs : for ‘ the merciful man is merciful also to his beast.’ In some places, the luncheon may be served in a forester’s or farmer’s house, and then the table must be properly covered, and hot dishe.s, such as cutlets, sausages, and potatoes added to it.’ If an English household would submit to be fed like a German one there is no doubt it would cost the heads of houses much less; and with their Milch Suppes, Gries Suppes, Bier Suppes, and an endless variety of others, as well as vegetables cooked with fruits, and dressed in all imaginable ways, they look as well-fed, healthy, and fully more cheerful than the English consumer of beefsteaks and porter.

EVERY DAY MEALS. 122 Dried Haddock. To render this fish digestible, it should, after being washed, be placed in the fish-kettle—or the frying-pan covered with a plate answers well—with a pint of boiling water. It should then stand at a heat which will keep it below simmering point, from fifteen to thirty minutes, according to the size of the fish. When done put it before the fire, and rub a little butter over it. If properly managed the haddock will not lose, its flavour, but, if preferred, it can be broiled over a slow fire. Kippered Herrings. Put the herrings into a basin, pour over enough boiling water to cover them, take them out immediately, and put them skin downwards in a frying-pan. For two herrings put half an ounce of butter and a tablespoonful of hot water into the pan, and baste them frequently with it for ten minutes, taking care the fire is not strong enough to boil the fish, indeed the slower the cooking proceeds the better. When placed on a hot dish pass a small piece of butter over the fish, sprinkle lightly with pepper, and serve very hot.

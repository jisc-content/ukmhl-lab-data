LITTLE DISHES. 183 —leaves, flowers, &c.,—ornament the galantine, and dish with these and small sprigs of endive and watercress. Mock Brawn. Get a fine sheep’s head, thoroughly clean it and boil it for five minutes in salt and water. Then put it into fresh water with a pound of pickled pork, and boil both until thoroughly done. The addition of pig’s feet or a little rind of pork thoroughly cooked is a great improvement. When done, carefully take the meat from the head, cut it up with the pork, mix with the brains and tongue, and finish as directed for brawn. Yorkshire Brawn. Take a pig’s head and feet, thoroughly cleanse them cut the head and ears up, put it into a stewpan, cover with water, and add a teaspoon ful of salt, a good pinch of pepper, and chopped sage. Place it on the fire until it boils, then simmer gently until all the meat is off the bones. Take it up and chop it in a hot basin, add all the liquor in which the meat has boiled, stir up well, and put it into earthenware jelly moulds. This is very good, but will not keep long in warm weather.

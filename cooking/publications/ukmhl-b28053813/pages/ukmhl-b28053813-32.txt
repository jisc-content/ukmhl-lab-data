When the stock has boiled four or five hours, all useful nutriment will have been extracted from the materials used ; it should then be strained and allowed to get cold in order to remove all the fat. The pot should be duly and thoroughly cleansed, both inside and out, and then be put away for future use ; and be it observed that no good soup of any class can be made in any but scrupu- lously clean utensils, and that no stock pot which will soil a clean cloth when rubbed inside is fit for use.

5 HINTS ON ECONOMICAL COOKERY. taste of it will be communicated to the substance immersed in it. The process of clarifying fat for frying is very simple. Remove any deposit of gravy—and this should always be done within two days after the dripping is made, as such gravy is precious and is apt to become sour if left too long —then break up the dripping into small pieces, and put it into a large pan. Pour over the dripping at least three pints of boiling water to a pound, stir until dissolved, and then set the pan aside until the next day. Remove the dripping in one piece, scrape the under side and dry it well in a cloth, put it into a deep baking dish and set it on the-1' range—not in the oven—at a low heat and let it melt; when again cold, take the dxipping out of the dish, wipe and put it away wrapped in sheets of paper. Pot skimmings are to be treated in exactly the same way, and will be found the best possible frying fat. If frying fat has to be bought it is best on all accounts to prepare it at home. Procure mutton suet, cut it into shreds, put it into a clean saucepan and let it melt slowly; when done strain it into a basin, let it stand until cold, and treat in the same manner as dripping. No fried things are wholesome, unless thoroughly im- mersed in fat at such a temperature as will effectually prevent their becoming sodden, nor, indeed, can frying be successfully done in any other way. Thus it will be seen how important it is that all household fat should be care-

Peel and prepare the potatoes in the usual way and boil or steam them for a quarter of an hour if of average size, if small somewhat less time. Drain the potatoes, put them in a baking dish with some dripping, bake them in a quick oven basting occasionally for forty minutes, or until they are perfectly brown. They must, when done, be dry and free from fat. If there is no pudding in the dripping pan, the potatoes can be browned under the meat, and indeed are better than when baked. Potatoes for browning should always be parboiled ; as, if baked raw, the outer crust is indigestible.

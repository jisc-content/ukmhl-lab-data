19 HINTS ON ECONOMICAL COOKERY. liar flavour arising from the decomposition, or as some say, fermentation, of the milk remaining in the butter. This flavour can be removed so as to make the butter fit for cooking purposes by clarifying, that is, pouring boiling water on it. When the butter is cold after this operation, it must be broken up, well washed in cold water, and then he melted at as low a heat as possible, after which it must he freed from all moisture, and kept in water slightly salted, and changed every day. To keep fresh butter sweet, put it into a pan of water, mixing two teaspoonfuls of tartaric acid to every half- gallon. Change the water qnce a week, or oftener in very hot weather. It is a great luxury to have butter firm in hot weather, and this can easily be effected by placing over it, on a soup-plate, an inverted flower-pot covered with a cloth, and pouring water on the plate, so that evaporation may constantly go on. Several cheap and good inventions are sold for this purpose, and they save some little trouble and time in their application. Butter which has been exposed to a high temperature is apt to disagree with the digestive organs, and hence many people are afraid to eat sauces and melted butter. But if the method indicated in our various recipes is followed, namely, never to boil sauces after adding butter, they may be eaten with- out fear, for by merely dissolving it butter does not lose the fatty acids which give it flavour and make it digestible. c 2

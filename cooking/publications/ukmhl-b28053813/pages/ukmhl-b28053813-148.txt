126 EVERY DAY MEALS. Collared Eels. Clean, skin, and boil the eels in water highly seasoned with pepper and salt, an onion, hav-leaf, a clove, and a little vinegar. When the eels are done enough, slip out the bones and cut them up into pieces about two inches long. Take the liquor in which the fish has boiled, strain it, let it boil in the stewpan without the lid, skimming it until it becomes clear. Dissolve a quarter of an ounce of isinglass to each half-pint of the fish gravy, and boil both together for a minute, let it then stand until cool. Arrange the pieces of eel tastefully in a plain mould with small sprigs of curled parsley and slices of hard-boiled eggs, and, if you like, a fillet or two of anchovies cut up into dice. When all the fish is thus arranged in the mould pour the ]elly in very gently, a tablespoonful at a time, in order not to disturb the solid material. Let the mould stand in cold water for seven or eight hours, when the contents can be turned out. Ornament the dish with parsley, lemon- juice, and beetroot. Oyster Trifles. The first thing to do will be to make the paper cases foi the trifles. They can be bought at the stationerâ€™s at nine- pence the dozen, but can be made at home for a penny.

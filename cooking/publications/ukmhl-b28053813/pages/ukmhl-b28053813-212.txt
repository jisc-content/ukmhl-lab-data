i go EVERY DAY MEALS. If preferred, a small tin loaf may be prepared in exactly the same manner as the roll, or pieces can be shaped from a household loaf. Curries. These are made in great variety, and by many different recipes. Perhaps there is no dish which in England it is so difficult to make suitable to the taste of Anglo-Indians. The fresh fruits, the grated cocoa-nuts, the carefully pre- pared curry powders and paste which are readily attain- able in India are not always to be found here, and for these reasons only general rules for preparing curries can be given. Captain Whiteâ€™s curry-paste gives to curries the flavour of tamarinds and other ingredients used in India, but the curries most liked by English eaters are those which are lightly flavoured, and not too hot. Any kind of fish, meat, game, or poultry is suitable for curries, cold cooked provisions and vegetables answer very well for them. The remains of a roasted loin of dairy-fed pork is very good. If the meat has to be fresh cooked for it, choose about a pound and a half of the best end of the fore loin. Cut it into small chops, place them in a stewpan in which an ounce of butter has been dissolved, sprinkle curry powder and salt over the chops, and slice in two onions.

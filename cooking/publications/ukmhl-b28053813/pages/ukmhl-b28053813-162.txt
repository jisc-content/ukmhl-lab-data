EVERY DAY MEALS. 140 Meat Minced. Any kind of cold meat, game, or poultry, can be advan- tageously made into a mince, and by the exercise of a little skill and taste, a disk which is too often insipid, may be rendered delicious. First, in the case of cold beef or mutton, clear the meat you intend to mince of every particle of fat, sinew, and gristle; either chop it writh the mincing knife or pass it through the sausage machine. This done, put the mince into a stewpan with sufficient cold, good gravy to cover it, and a minced shalot and a teaspoonful of minced parsley. Let this stand on the range, getting hot very slowly, but never approaching boiling point, and when it is done, add a very little Harvey, Worcester, or Chutney Sauce, as may be liked, and pepper and salt to taste. Fry sufficient sippets of bread for your party, place round the dish for serving, on each a sprig of fried parsley, and neatly place the mince in the centre of the dish. Veal can be minced in the same manner as above, but when it has been made thoroughly hot in the gravy, which can be made from the bones and trimmings with an onion or two, and a sprig of thyme and parsley, it must be thickened with milk and flour, and have a grate of nutmeg and lemon peel added instead of sauce. It should then be stirred over the fire until thick, and be served with fried or toasted bread and fried parsley.

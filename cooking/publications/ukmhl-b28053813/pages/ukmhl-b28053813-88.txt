EVERY DAY MEALS. 66 should be so prepared before putting down the joint as to last, with but slight addition of fuel, during the whole time of cooking.

The old rule of a quarter of an hour to a pound of meat is a good one, but one hour and three quarters will, if the process is properly carried on, be sufficient to roast a leg of mutton weighing eight pounds to perfection. In roasting by any kind of closed range the greatest care should be taken to have the ovens clean. If any fat or products of former cookery are suffered to remain, they will impregnate the meat with an odour which is not only most unpleasant but positively unwholesome. A roasting oven if properly ventilated, scrupulously clean, and supplied with a double dripping pan, the under of which must contain water, will cook joints of meat in great perfection, and there cannot be any reasonable objection urged against roasting by this method. To roast by gas the same general rules as above apply, and it is most important that the cooking should proceed slowly. In roasting by a gas oven constructed on proper principles, as for example, Leoniâ€™s, a considerable saving is effected, as the loss by evaporation is much less than by any other method. The meat, moreover, requires no

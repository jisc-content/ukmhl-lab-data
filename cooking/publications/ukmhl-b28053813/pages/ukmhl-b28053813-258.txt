Wash the shells of two eggs, and heat them up with the whites, stir them briskly into the jelly, which place over the fire, and let it come very slowly to boiling point, then continue simmering for five minutes. Take a cup and put the white of eggs from the surface of the jelly, gently into the bag, as this acts as a filter, then put a cupful of the jelly in slowly, and let it run through, continuing this until all is used. It should now be clear; but if it is not, keep warm that which has run through the bag, and once more pass it through. If the jelly is flavoured with wine, when all has run through, add to it a wineglassful of brown brandy, as this will give it a rich, golden tint. If the weather is cold, the given quantity of gelatine will bear a little more liquid, and will be stiff enough to turn out. When the jelly is on the point of setting, put it gently into a mould which has been cooled in water or ice. Moulds of tin or copper are best for jellies. Just before the jelly is required for table, have ready a bowl or bucket of water, in which you can dip the mould just in for a second, taking care the water is only tepid—that is to say—not more than 80°. Now wipe the mould, loosen the edges of the jelly, taking care not to break them, with the end of a teaspoon, reverse the mould gently on a glass dish, let it stand a minute, then take it off, and the jelly should be perfect in shape, and as clear as crystal.

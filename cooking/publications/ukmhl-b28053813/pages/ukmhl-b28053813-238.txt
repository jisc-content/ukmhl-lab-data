EVERY DAY MEALS. 2l6 gill and a half is required for a pound of paste. Make into a smooth paste with the hand, and then roll it out to the thickness of half-an-inch. If a pound of paste, divide it into four parts, flour the board and roll out each part as thin as a wafer, fold over four or five times, and use as required. Bake as soon as possible. Excellent puff pastry may be made by using three- quarters of a pound of butter to a pound of flour, but for the finest kind equal quantities of these are requisite. Good firm lard may be substituted for the butter, and three-quarters of a pound of it to one pound of flour wdll make a rich paste. This method, if followed, even for household pastry made with dripping, will be found to answer better than any other. Short Crust. Put half-a-pound of butter into ten ounces of flour, mix a tablespoonful of castor sugar with it, and rub together. Beat up the yolk of an egg with two tablespoonfuls of cold water, or less if the butter is soft, make the paste very stiff, roll it out once, and use for tarts of fresh fruit, cherries, raspberry and currant, &c., and for cheese- cakes.

135 LITTLE DISHES. lialf an inch thick, and place in a stewpan covered with good stock or gravy, one or two minced onions, and a turnip. Let the meat get hot slowly, and stand very gently simmering for three-quarters of an hour. Thicken the gravy, add salt and pepper if necessary, and serve the hash with currant jelly. If liked, a glass of claret and a lump of sugar can he added to the gravy with the thickening. It is usual to place fried or toasted bread round the dish. Tripe in Batter. Boil the tripe after prepared in the shops for two hours. To each pound put a quart of cold water, two teaspoon- fuls of salt, a small teaspoonful of pepper, a bay-leaf, a very small bit of mace, three onions, and a tablespoonful of vinegar. When the tripe is ready, dry it in a clean cloth, cut it into neat squares of about two inches. Dip each piece in batter, and fry in hot fat until crisp and a light brown. As you take up each piece put it on paper, to absorb any fat clinging to it, and serve as quickly as possible. Not more than two or three pieces should be fried at once, lest the temperature of the fat be too much reduced.

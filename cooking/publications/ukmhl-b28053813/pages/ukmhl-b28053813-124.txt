Smooth the top over neatly, and hake in a moderate oven for twenty minutes. If preferred, the potato can be spread on a bright tin dish, the fish be placed high in the centre of it, and then be thoroughly covered over with potato. This has a better appearance than when cooked iu a tart-dish, but is not so nice, as too much potato is required to cover the fish up thoroughly. Boiled Oatmeal Pudding. This is a cheap and nice family pudding.—Mix a quarter of a pound of coarse oatmeal in half-a-pint of cold ■water, and stir on to it a pint of boiling milk or water, add an ounce of shred suet or any other fat, two eggs, a little spice, sugar to taste, and, by way of a treat, two ounces of sultana raisins. Put the pudding into a greased basin, cover with a cloth, and boil for an hour and a half. Make a sauce to eat with the pudding as follows:— Boil an ounce of currants in half-a-pint of water for five minutes, break up the currants with a spoon, and stir in a tablespoonful of flour mixed smooth in a little cold water, add a little spice and sugar to taste. Children like the sauce without the currants if sweetened with treacle.

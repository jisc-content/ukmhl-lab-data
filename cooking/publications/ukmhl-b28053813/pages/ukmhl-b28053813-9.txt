PBEEACE —*— The gratifying reception which has been accorded to my books on cookery, and especially to “ Little Dinners,” has induced me to prepare another hand- book, embracing a large number of original recipes which could not be included in the plan of that book. These recipes have all been carefully pre- pared by me for the use of the Cookery Classes ' in the Crystal Palace School of Art, Science, and Literature. My aim has been to give clear and simple directions, which may be successfully fol- lowed by the most inexperienced cook, and at the same time to show how good results may be ob- tained by the exercise of economy. Housekeepers are so well acquainted with the difficulty of providing a varied menu for early breakfasts, that it is hoped the first part of this book may be especially acceptable to them. There

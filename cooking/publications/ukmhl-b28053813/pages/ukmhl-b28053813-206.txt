184 EVERY DAY MEALS. The American dish Scrappel is a variation of the above, a portion of which might be tried as follows :â€” When the brawn is prepared ready for moulds, add a little more seasoning for scrappel, arid, if liked, a little sage, put the brawn in a stewpau, and when it boils, stir in sufficient new white Indian corn meal to make it thick. Stir over the fire for ten minutes, pour the scrappel into dishes, smooth over with a knife, and when set cut it in neat slices, fry brown, and serve hot. Croquettes. Croquettes of all kinds, fish, game, poultry, or any delicate meat can be successfully made on the following model. Whatever material is used must be finely minced or pounded. Care is required in making the sauce, if it is too thin it is difficult to mould the cro- quettes, and ice will be required to set it. Croquettes of game without any flavouring except a little salt and cayenne are generally acceptable as a breakfast dish. Preserved lobster, Bray and Hayes, or Moirs, make very good croquettes for an entree, and small scraps of any kind can thus be made into a very good dish.

75 FAMILY DINNERS AND LUNCHEONS. Semolina Pudding. Soak an ounce and a half of the semolina in a gill of milk for ten minutes, stir it into three gills of boiling milk, add an ounce of lump sugar and boil gently for twenty minutes stirring all the time. Take the semolina off the fire and stir in quickly the yolk of an egg, beaten up with a few drops of vanilla or other flavouring, and put it immediately into a mould previously rinsed with cold water. This can be served as a hot pudding, as after standing for ten minutes it will turn out in shape; but if allowed to remain until cold will eat like a rich and delicate cream. The recipe is for the best Italian semolina, an excellent and cheap article of food ; the ordinary kind can be used, but will require longer boiling and will not be so delicate. Syrup, preserve, or stewed fruit can be eaten with the pudding.

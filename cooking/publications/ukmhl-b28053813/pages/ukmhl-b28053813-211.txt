A well prepared kromesky will not be greasy or taste of the bacon, but be, as it is now some- times called, a veritable “angel on horseback.” A quarter of a pound of chopped chicken, game, or veal will make about the same quantity of kromeskies as the oysters.. Add a few minced button mushrooms, a little ham, shred parsley, or any suitable flavouring.

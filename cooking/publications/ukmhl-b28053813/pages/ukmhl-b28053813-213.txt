LITTLE DISHES. 191 Put the stewpan on the range at a very low heat, and allow the meat to cook slowly for two hours in its own juices. If it becomes dry a spoonful or two of water or gravy must be added from time to time. When the meat is ready—it must be very well done—take it out of the stewpan, put it in a basin, set it in a saucepan of water and keep warm whilst you prepare the gravy. Put a gill of cold jvater into the stewpan, which will cause the fat to rise ; take it all off, then put in a minced onion, boil it until tender, stir in a teaspoonful of curry powder, ODe of Captain White’s curry paste, and a tablespoonful of fine flour mixed smooth in rather less than half a pint of new milk. Stir the gravy over the fire until thickened, put in the meat, taste if salt enough, and let them simmer very gently together for a quarter of an hour. Let boiled rice be handed round with the curry. If preferred, instead of Captain White’s paste, a sharp apple may be substituted, which should be boiled with the minced onion; a little tomato conserve is a good addition, or mushroom vinegar or lemon juice. With some kinds of curry thin pieces of cooked ham are handed round, and boiled rice is universally served with them. The meat for curries is always so well cooked as to be eaten with a fork and spoon by those Avho prefer to do so. The best curries can be made in Captain Warren’s pot, which is to be had at a moderate price.

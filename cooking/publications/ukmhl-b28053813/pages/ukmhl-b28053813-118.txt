EVERY DAY MEALS. 96 Plain Apple Charlotte. Put a dozen apples in a tin baking dish with a few spoonfuls of water, and bake them in a slow oven until done. Apples slowly baked do not burst and lose their juice, as they do when baked too quickly. When done carefully scrape out all the pulp of the apples, and put it, with sufficient sugar to make it sweet enough, into a stewpan, stir it over the fire until it begins to get stiff, put it in the centre of a dish, and place round it a border of bread, fried as follows : cut the crumb of a small tin loaf into triangles about half-an-inch thick, throw them into fat hot enough to brown them instantly, let the pieces fry for half-a-minute, take them up, and put them between paper to absorb any fat clinging to them, dip each triangle into golden syrup, and arrange them round the apple, which should be hot. Apricot jam is preferable to golden syrup but is more expensive.

FAMILY DINNERS AND LUNCHEONS. 7i to cook, according to its age and quality, and when done it must be perfectly tender without being ragged. Cut the meat into slices, the round way, place it in a pie dish, beat the vegetables cooked with it to a fine puree, mix this Avith the gravy, which should be reduced by boiling in a stewpan without the lid to half-a-pint, and pour it over the meat. Half a pound of uncooked ox kidney, or mushrooms if in the country and they are plentiful, are excellent additions. Make a crust as follows :â€” Scrape very fine three quarters of a pound of beef- suet, Aveigh a pound of fine flour, roll a little of the suet Avith a little of the flour into flakes until all is worked up, mix into a paste with rather less than half a pint of cold Avater, and roll out very thin. Fold the paste over to the required thickness, put a thick layer round the edge, and cover the pie in the usual manner. The quantities given above are for a large family-pie, Avhich Avill be sufficient for eight persons. Equal quanti- ties of suet and flour should be used if a superior crust is required. Crust thus made is very good, and if properly managed should be as light and good as that made Avith butter, and as it is to be eaten hot is more wholesome and digestible than the latter. An excellent pudding can be made of the stewed shin proceeding in the same manner as for rump-steak pudding.

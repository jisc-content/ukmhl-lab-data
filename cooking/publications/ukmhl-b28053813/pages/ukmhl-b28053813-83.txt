breakfasts. 6i Cocoa. The best and most digestible beverage is undoubtedly that made from the nibs. These should not be too highly roasted, and it is a good plan to grind or crush them before boiling. A large pot should be kept for the purpose, and always stand on the corner of the range when cocoa is required for daily use. A much richer beverage is produced, if the old nibs are allowed to remain in the pot, and a small quantity of fresb ones be added daily until the pot is half full. But many persons prefer clear cocoa, and in this case fresh nibs only must be used for each decoction. To a quart of water allow a tea-cupfull of nibs, boil slowly for at least six hours, filling up the pot to keep the original quantity. When done, strain and allow the cocoa to get cold, then skim off every particle of fat which may have risen ; boil up again and serve. A cheap, excellent, and wholesome beverage can be made from cocoa-shells, a pound of these costing but threepence. Cocoa is made in exactly the same way from them as from the nibs, allowing a breakfast-cup of shells to each quart of water.

FAMILY DINNERS AND LUNCHEONS. 73 often until done ; they will take from fifteen to twenty minutes. To make the sauce for eight herrings take half-a-pint of white stock, stir into it, whilst boiling, an ounce of fine flour, and a teaspoonful of French mustard mixed smooth in a little cold water, continue stirring over the fire until thickened, add an ounce of butter and a large pinch of parsley chopped fine, pepper and salt to taste. Stir the sauce until the butter, which should be broken into little bits, is dissolved, and be careful it does not boil after this addition. Lay the herrings on a hot dish, pour the sauce round them, and serve. Boiled Leg of Mutton. Put the leg of mutton into a pot of boiling water suffi- cient to cover it. To each gallon of water allow two table- spoonfuls of salt and a large teaspoonful of pepper, with the turnips and carrots which are to be served with the meat. Allow the pot to boil fast for ten minutes ; then skim, and draw it to the cooler part of the range, and keep it just at boiling point for the requisite time. A quarter of an hour to the pound of meat is sufficient, and if the leg weighs more than eight pounds, time may be calcu- lated something less. If there is no objection, a few onions should be boiled with the meat, and they may be mashed with the turnips or served whole.

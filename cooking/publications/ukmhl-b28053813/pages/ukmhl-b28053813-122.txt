EVERY DAY MEALS. IOO known that the “Kevalenta Arabica” is prepared from them. The flour of peas, which is sold “ to thicken soup in a few minutes,” is, as a rule, destitute of the fine dietetic quality of the dried vegetable itself, and there is no valid reason for its use. As a rule, when pea soup is given at dinner the other dishes should be light, not because the peas are in themselves indigestible, but because, com- bined with food of an equal value, the digestive organs may be too severely taxed. Thus fish pie, as in the above menu, is suitable, as are all dishes containing but a small proportion of animal food. Peas are excellent for children in combination with milk, and in soine cases a puree, made of equal quanti. ties of well boiled rice and peas, will be found more suit- able than peas alone. Dried peas should always be soaked, and, where large quantities are used, it is desirable to grind them, as they then take less time to cook. Put the peas to soak in cold water for twelve hours, skim off any which float on the surface, drain, and tie them loosely in a cloth, which plunge into a saucepan containing plenty of cold water and a piece of washing-soda the size of a hazel-nut to each quart. The time the peas will take depends much on their quality; but they should be soft in less than three hours. When done take the peas out of the cloth; if they will not beat up easily to a pulp, pass them through a coarse sieve, using milk or broth to facilitate the process.

BREAKFASTS. 35 ounce of cloves, half-an-ounce of allspice, half-a-pound of coarse sugar. Let all these ingredients be thoroughly pounded and mixed together. Take ten pounds of the brisket of beef, rub it well with this pickle every day for a fortnight. When about to cook, roll it up as tightly as possible and tie it round with string, place it in a deep earthenware pan, with a little stock, or water, and cover the top with suet; let it bake gently for four hours, or it may be boiled. When cold cut the string, and it will retain its form, glaze or cover with raspings. Potato Chips. Peel fine kidney potatoes, and slice them as thin as you can the round way ; as you do the chips throw them into cold water, as this frees them from the potato-flour, which has a tendency to prevent successful frying. Drain and lay them in a cloth to dry, put them into a wire basket, which immerse in a stewpan half-full of boiling fat, and when the chips are a light golden brown, put them between paper in the oven for a minute, turn them on to a dish, .sprinkle salt and pepper over, and serve. The greatest care must be taken to have the fat the right temperature for frying the potatoes, as otherwise they 'will be sodden with grease.

Divide the heart down the middle, rub flour over it and fry it until of a nice brown on both sides. When this is done put it into a saucepan with enough water to cover it, a sprig of thyme, a large pinch of pepper, a teaspoonful of salt, and three or four onions. Let the saucepan simmer for two hours, or until the heart is perfectly tender. When done thicken the gravy writh flour mixed smooth in a little cold water, add salt and pepper, if necessary, and a pinch of brown sugar. For a pudding prepare the heart as above, stewing it for one hour only, cut it in slices, and put it with its gravy and some sliced potatoes, with pepper and salt, into a pudding basin lined wuth crust made of dripping or suet. Boil the pudding for an hour and a half, or according to size. For a pie stew the heart until tender, cut it into neat pieces, put them in the pie-dish with minced onion, the gravy, or some wrater, and, if con- venient, a quarter of a pound of beef kidney, cut into small pieces. Cover the dish with pie-crust, and bake for an hour, or longer if the oven is slow.

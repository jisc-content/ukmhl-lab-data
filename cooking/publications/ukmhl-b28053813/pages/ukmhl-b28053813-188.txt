i66 EVERY DAY MEALS. Puree of Mushrooms. To serve with broiled chicken, cutlets, &c.—Chop up a pound of fresh champignons, simmer them in a little milk or broth for ten minutes, then add the crumb of a Trench roll; stir over the fire until all liquid is absorbed, put in an ounce of fresh butter, pepper, and salt, and rub through a wire strainer. Put the •puree, back into the stewpan and let it get hot before serving.' Should the puree seem too stiff, add a little milk or cream whilst rubbing it through the strainer. Baked Mushrooms. Trim the stalks and carefully peel the mushrooms ; put a slice of butter in a baking dish; when melted, lay in the mushrooms, pepper and salt the upper side, and allow them to cook very slowly for about half-an-hour. The exact time for cooking mushrooms cannot be given, but fine fresh ones cook much more rapidly and yield more gravy than when stale or of inferior kinds. Mushrooms with Cream Sauce. Dissolve two ounces of butter in a stewpan, mix in the yolks of two eggs lightly beaten, and the juice of a lemon.

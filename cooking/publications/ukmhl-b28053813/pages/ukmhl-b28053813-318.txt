Take eighty Seville oranges, pare them as thin as pos- sible, pour one gallon of boiling water on the peel, and let it remain forty-eight hours. Pare off all the white part from the oranges and throw it away, squeeze out all the juice and add it to the peel, wash the remains and the pips of the oranges after squeezing in order to have all the goodness of them. Put all the liquid with the peel and juice with thirty pounds of good loaf sugar and sufficient cold water to make the whole quantity ten gallons, into a brandy or rum cask. Stir up thoroughly every day for a week, then put a toast well dipped in good brewerâ€™s yeast into the bung-hole. If fermentation does not commence within three days, put another spoonful of yeast. A hissing sound denotes the commencement of fermentation, in a fortnight after this put the bung in the cask, and let the wine remain for twelve months before bottling.

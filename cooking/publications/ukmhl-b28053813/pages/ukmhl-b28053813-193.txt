LITTLE DISHES. 171 filled. When the sausages are made, tie the skin at the other end, pinch them into shape, and then loop them by passing one through another, giving a twist to each as you do them. Fifteen to twenty minutes should be allowed for frying sausages, and when done they should be nicely browned. A little butter or lard is best for frying, and some pieces of light bread may be fried in it when the sausages are done, and placed round the dish by way of garnish. Sausage skins, especially if preserved, should be well soaked before using, or they may make the sausages too salt. It is a good plan to put the skin on the water-tap and allow the water to run through it, as thus it will be well washed on the inside. Beef Sausages. Although good sausages may be made from the coarser parts of prime beef, it will be found best to use “ buttock steak,” or, failing that, any tender, juicy steak. Take six ounces of beef suet to a pound of lean beef, two ounces of bread-crumbs, a large teaspoonful of salt, one of black pepper, and of sweet herbs dried and sifted: proceed as for pork sausages. Fry them slowly, but for rather less time than those made of pork.

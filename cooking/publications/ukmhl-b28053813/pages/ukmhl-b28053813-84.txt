The chocolate of the Compagnie Cobniale maintains its superiority, and two recipes for its use are given. Put a pint of water in a perfectly clean stewpan, break up a stick of chocolate, drop it in, boil very slowly until all is dissolved, stirring occasionally. Serve with hot milk. The second method by which a rich beverage is ob- tained is as follows : Grate a stick of chocolate, stir it into half-a-pint of boiling milk in a stewpan, whisk it over the fire, and as the froth rises, take it off, put it into the chocolate pot, which must be kept hot, and continue whisking until all is done.

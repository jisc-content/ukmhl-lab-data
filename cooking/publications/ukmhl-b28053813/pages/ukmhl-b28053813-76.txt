54 EVERY DAY MEALS. Potato Snow. Rub three or four cold white potatoes through a sieve, put them into a stew-pan with a tablespoonful of hot milk or cream and half an ounce of butter dissolved in it. Add a pinch of salt and of white pepper, and stir the potato over the fire until it begins to get dry. Serve piled high on a dish, with the mutton collops round it. Fried Mushrooms. For this purpose the large black mushrooms are best, and they must be fresh. If quickly grown, the forced will be found as good as the field mushroom ; in either case, care must be taken to have them free from grit. Put a good slice of butter or lard into a frying-pan large enough to hold the mushrooms, and, when hot, put them in with the white side downwards, having previously skinned them and trimmed the stalks. Sprinkle pepper and salt over the mushrooms and let them cook very slowly, and if the butter dries up add a little more. In ten minutes turn the mushrooms, and let them finish cooking, still very slowly, on the other side. When done place the mushrooms on a hot dish, pour the gravy over, and garnish the dish with fried bread.

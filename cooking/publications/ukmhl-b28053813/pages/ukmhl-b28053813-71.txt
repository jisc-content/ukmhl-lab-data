Season highly with pepper and salt, and stir in the yolks of two eggs well beaten. Butter a tart dish, and when ready to bake the fondu beat the whites of the eggs to a strong froth and mix together, put it into a hot oven immediately and bake for twenty minutes. Serve with a little good gravy in a boat. Sausage meat may be substituted for cooked meat, in which case a little more time must be given to bake the fondu. If preferred use a little finely minced parsley in- stead of the onion. Broiled Bacon. The best part of bacon for toasting or broiling is that known as the “ streaky,” and it is best toasted before a clear fire. The slices of bacon should be cut less than a quarter of an inch in thickness, be divided into convenient lengths, and have the rind removed. To have broiled bacon in perfection it must be very slowly cooked, rapid cooking hardens the lean and renders it most indigestible. It is a common practice with cooks to put slices of bacon into the frying-pan and frizzle them rapidly over the fire, but such a practice is greatly to be condemned. Bacon cannot be thus fried and be good for human food.

X PREFACE. dishes as come under the head of “plain cookery,” and every hint which may render the recipes useful to the inexperienced housekeeper has been given. In most families, from time to time, there are occasions when it is necessary to serve luncheons of ceremony, suppers, or additional delicacies. To meet these requirements there are given a number of recipes, both for sweet and savoury dishes, all prepared with regard to economy, and a great pro- portion of them by new and easy methods. The cold dishes under this head will also be for the most part suitable for high tea, and the hot dishes will be found light and digestible enough to serve for little suppers. My former success encourages me to hope that this new book, on which my best efforts have been expended, will be widely useful. My recompense will be great if it prove a real help to those who, in these difficult times, are seeking to raise the standard of housewifely perfection, and by their own example to show that the best work a woman can do is that in the home, and for the well-being of the family.

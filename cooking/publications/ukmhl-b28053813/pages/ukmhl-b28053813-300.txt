EVERY DAY MEALS. it perfectly smooth. It will be necessary to dip the knife occasionally in the boiling water, taking care to drain it before using for the icing. Having finished the top of the cake, put a lump of icing on the side and smooth round with the knife. The process of icing will be conveniently managed by placing the cake on an inverted plate, on which it can then be placed in an oven with the door open to harden it. Confectioners put a small piece of stone blue dissolved with the icing, and this prevents it turning brown in keeping. To Ornament a Cake for christening or any special purpose, with a needle or pencil write the name or motto in the centre, and make round the edge a bold running pattern. Make a paper funnel, with the point just large enough to admit of a fine piping being forced through it. Put a little of the icing into the funnel, and gently pressing near the point cover the letters with the piping. If the cake is large three or four paper funnels may be required as they get soft after a time. Use the best writing-paper to make the funnels, and stitch them to make them keep their shape. Tin funnels with canvas bags can be bought for cake icing, and are made in various sizes. To colour the icing use cochineal, which can be bought ready prepared or made according to our recipe.

172 EVERY DAY MEALS. Veal and Ham Sausages. It will be necessary to have cutlet or the best end of the neck for veal sausages. To each pound of veal use half-a-pound of ham or bacon, about three ounces lean and five ounces fat. Season with a small teaspoonful of pep- per, be careful not to use too much salt, as the ham may give almost enough: in any case a very small teaspoonful will suffice. Moisten the meat with water, or gravy made from the trimmings of veal and ham, and proceed as for pork sausages. An ounce of bread to the pound of meat can be used if desired. Bath Polonies. Mince pork as for sausages, season it with coriander, allspice, long pepper, pepper and salt. Bullock's *skins must be used, and must not be filled too tightly. Put the polonies into warm water with a little red sanders to colour the skins, let them get hot very gradually, and as soon as the water is approaching boiling-point reduce the heat, because if the polonies boil the skins will burst. About half-an-hour will cook them in the hot water, and when done they will look firm and plump.

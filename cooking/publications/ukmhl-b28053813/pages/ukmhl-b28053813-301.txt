279 BREAD AND CANES. Almond Icing. Blanch half-a-pound of sweet almonds and an ounce of bitter, pound them in a mortar, adding a little rose-water as you go on to prevent oiling, and when all the almonds are reduced to a very smooth paste mix them with an equal weight of finely-sifted sugar. If the paste seems too dry, add a little white of egg, spread the almond paste on the cake, and allow it to become dry and firm before putting on the sugar-icing. Almond icing can be made from bitter almonds which have been infused in spirit to make the extract for flavouring, and in this case no sweet almonds will be used. Almond paste can he made in a superior manner in Kentâ€™s Combination Mincer, by using the adjustment for potting meat, &c. A little potato or com flour will be needed with the almonds for this method ; sugar should not be used until the pounding is completed.

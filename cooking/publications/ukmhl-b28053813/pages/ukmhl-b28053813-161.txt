139 LITTLE DISHES. If properly managed, the beef will take about eight minutes to get hot through, and will make a very delicious little dish. When done, sprinkle a very little salt and pepper on the beef, pour over any gravy in the pan, and serve. Observe that there is to be no approach to frying, which would harden the meat, but a slow and gentle heat to be maintained until it is hot through. Savoury Roll Pudding. Make a paste of half a pound of flour, six ounces of shred suet, a pinch of salt, and a gill of cold water. Roll out the paste rather longer one way than the other, and about half an inch thick. Spread on it half a pound of beef steak, minced fine, seasoned with half a teaspoonful of salt and a large pinch of pepper, and, if approved, an onion, finely minced and boiled for a minute or two. Roll the pudding up neatly and tightly in the form of a bolster, taking care the meat is all kept in; wet the edges of the crust and press them well together; tie the pudding in a floured cloth and put it in a saucepan, with sufficient boiling water to cover it. Boil gently for .an hour and a half. Serve with gravy in a boat.

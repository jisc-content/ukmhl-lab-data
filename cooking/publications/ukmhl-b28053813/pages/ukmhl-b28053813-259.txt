JELLIES, CREAMS, ICES. • 237 To make a jelly ornamented with fruit, have some very clear lemon jelly, of which put in the mould enough to cover it, about an inch deep. Let this stand until begin- ning to set, arrange in it strawberries, grapes, cherries, or any other bright fruit you wish, then, very gently with a spoon, cover them with the jelly, cold, but not set. Let this again stand until beginning to set, put in more fruit, then jelly, and so on until the mould is set. A pretty effect is produced by the mixture of creams and jelly : it is managed in the same way as the above, taking care to have each layer so nearly set, that the cream cannot run into the jelly. Great care should be taken in washing and keeping jelly bags in a suitable place, for if not scrupulously clean, they impart to jellies that peculiar flannel-like flavour, which destroys its delicacy. When done writh, empty the bag of its refuse contents, turn it inside out, and at once put it into boiling water, which will clear it. Allow it to pass through two or three very hot waters, then squeeze it and w'hen thoroughly dried—in the air if possible— wrap it in clean paper, and keep in a dry place. Before using, always wring the bag through boiling water, allow- ing it to get nearly dry before pouring the jelly through it. Kent’s registered jelly strainer is an admirable inven- tion, keeping the jelly warm, and enabling it to run through without being placed near the fire. Any waste

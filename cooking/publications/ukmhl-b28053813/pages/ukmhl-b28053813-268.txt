246 EVERY DAY MEALS. REMARKS ON MAKING ICES. The making of ices, like many other operations of the confectioner’s art, is often rendered difficult by the neglect of the simple principles and precautions which, duly con- sidered, ensure success. Thus, if the ice for freezing is not properly broken, and then immediately and thoroughly mixed with a proper proportion of salt, the process cannot be successfully carried on. Again, when freezing by the ordinary means, if the temperature of the atmosphere is much above 45°, the ice will melt too rapidly, requiring to be frequently renewed, thus entailing a great deal of trouble and expense. Although the making of ices can in experienced hands be successfully carried out by the old rude method, it will severely tax the powers of an ordi- nary cook, especially if she has many other things to engage her attention. A great economy both of time and material can be effected by the use of Kent’s Horizontal Freezer. This machine is not expensive, and by its form obviates a great difficulty in making ices, namely, the tendency to freeze hard at the bottom of the pot, and thus prevent the thorough mixing of the ingredients. For its extreme simplicity and efficiency this machine is unri- Valledj as by the mere turning of the handle, which could

These trifles are by many persons preferred to oyster patties, as they are less rich, and if the cook cannot prepare the finest kind of pastry, are convenient substitutes. A small quantity only is supposed to be served, as the trifles go by way of appetisers, and should be well and rather highly seasoned. Lobster Cutlets. These may be economically made with preserved lobster. Small claws of fresh lobsters, which are used by way of ornament, can always be had at trifling cost of the fishmonger; but, if not convenient to use these, parsley stalks can be substituted. Cut up the lobster into small pieces, and mix it with a sauce made as directed for croquettes, adding shrimp or anchovy sauce to taste. Mould the paste into small cakes, egg and crumb and fry them in the wire basket in the same manner as cro- quettes. Drain, and into each cutlet stick a small lobster claw, arranging them neatly on a fish paper. If the cutlets are made of fresh lobster, the hen should be chosen, and the coral be pounded, rubbed through a sieve, and mixed with the other ingredients.

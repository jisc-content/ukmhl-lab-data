By thus treating any part of the head, perfect cleanliness is insured. Put the tongues into a stewpan, with a large pinch of saltpetre, a teaspoonful of salt, two onions, a bay- leaf, and a quart of water; let them boil for three hours, or until so perfectly tender that they will hardly bear the fork. When done, let them remain in the liquor until cool, then take off the skin, and set them aside until cold. The brains must be boiled separately, and rather fast, in a little highly seasoned stock, for ten minutes. When ready, let them get cold; then divide each lobe into three or four slices, dip them in egg, then in highly seasoned bread-crumb very finely sifted; divide the tongues, having first trimmed the roots of all gristle, &c., into three or four slices; egg and crumb these also.

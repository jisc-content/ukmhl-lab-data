EVERY DAY MEALS. 212 Grated Cheese. American or Cheshire cheese answers well for grating, and it is a useful way of using cheese which is cut low and not otherwise presentable. Take care the grater is dry and clean, and grate the cheese on to a butter or glass dish, which should be handed to each guest with butter. It is a good plan to have neatly-cut pieces of cheese rather less than an inch square, in the middle of the dish, so that any fancy in the matter may be gratified. These pieces, if not used, can be grated for the next day.

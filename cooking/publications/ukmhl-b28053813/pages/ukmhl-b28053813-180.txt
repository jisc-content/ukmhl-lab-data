Spread this over the slices of turkey, then wrap each in a cover of white buttered paper, and place them on a gridiron over a clear fire. Turn them fre- quently, so that the paper does not scorch, and in about a quarter of an hour they will be done. Take them out of the papers, and serve on a hot dish. Fried Rabbit. Choose a young one, cut it into small joints, and fry slowly in butter till a nice brown. When done pour over it the following sauce :â€”Dissolve a little butter in a sauce- pan, add pepper, salt, and a little scalded and chopped parsley ; let it get hot, but on no account allow it to boil. Rabbit with Mushrooms. Take all the meat lengthways from the back of a fat Ostend rabbit, and cut it into neat square pieces. Fry them very slowly in butter until a nice brown, sprinkle over with pepper and salt. Dish them, and place on each piece a well stewed mushroom, pouring round the dish the gravy from them; or a little mushroom catsup, diluted with thin white sauce, may be substituted. The portions of rabbit not used for this dish will answer well for a pie or fricasee.

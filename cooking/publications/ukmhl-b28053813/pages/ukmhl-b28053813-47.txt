HINTS ON ECONOMICAL COOKERY. 25 class kitchens is to have the smallest possible number of utensils, and those of inferior kinds; and it is surprising how slow ladies have been to adopt the many excel- lent machines and utensils of modern invention which have the threefold merit of saving time, money, and labour. In “the good time coming” let us hope that the kitchen department will be as carefully arranged as that of the drawing-room, and ladies be as well qualified to judge of the merits of a stove and a labour-saving ma- chine as they now are of the tone of a grand-piano, or a piece of art needlework.

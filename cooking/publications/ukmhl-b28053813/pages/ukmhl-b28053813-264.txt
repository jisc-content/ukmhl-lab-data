242 EVERY DAY MEALS. Rum Cream. Boil half-a-pint of milk or cream with two ounces of lump sugar and a bay-leaf, pour this on to the yolks of three eggs well beaten, stir over a slow fire until the custard is thick. Take out the bay leaf and let the custard stand, stirring it occasionally until nearly cold. Soak a quarter of an ounce of gelatine in a gill of cold water, and dissolve it by boiling, and let it stand until quite cool. Both the gelatine and custard being cool, stir them together until thoroughly mixed, add a small wine-glassful of rum, and put the cream into a mould, let it stand twelve hours before turning out. A syrup of capillaire flavoured with rum poured round the cream is an improvement. Ginger Cream. Beat the yolks of four eggs, put them in a stew-pan with a quarter of a pound of preserved ginger, cut into very thin slices. Add two tablespoonfuls of the ginger- syrup, one pint of milk or cream, and sugar to taste. Stir these ingredients over a slow fire for twenty minutes, or until the mixture begins to thicken, taking great care it does not boil.

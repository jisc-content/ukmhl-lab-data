EVERY DAY MEALS. 1S8 wafer. Put a heaped tea-spoonful of the oyster mixture on a slice of the bacon, roll it over in the shape of a cork, and, having made the whole number, let them remain whilst you prepare the following batter:—Mix gradually two large tablespoonfuls of fine flour with four of cold water—take care to keep this perfectly smooth—mix in a tablespoonful of oil or dissolved butter, the yolk of an egg, and a small pinch of salt. When ready to use, beat up the white of the egg to a strong froth, and stir it lightly into the batter. Have ready a small stewpan of hot fat. Care must be taken to have it of the right temperature, if too hot it causes the batter to fly off, and if not hot enough will sodden the kromeskies. When the fat is ready, dip each kromesky in the batter, take it out in a tablespoon, and dip it with the batter in the spoon into the fat. It will take less than a minute to cook, and when done will be a nice light golden brown. Put it betw'een paper to absorb an)>- grease clinging to it. Remove with a pierced spoon any little pieces of batter remaining in the fat, and finish the whole of the kromes- kies in the same manner. If preferred two, or more, may be fried at one time, but in the long run nothing is gained by so doing. When all are done, place them on an orna- mental dish paper, and serve quickly. Garnish with fried parsley. If it can be procured without too much expense, calf’s udder is preferable to bacon for wrapping the kromeskies;

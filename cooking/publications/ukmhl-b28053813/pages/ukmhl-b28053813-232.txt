EVERY DAY MEALS. 210 Radishes. Choose small red and white turnip-radishes, and never eat them when stale. With a small brush kept on pur- pose for vegetables prepare each one in clean cold water, cut the green tops away neatly, taking great care no grit is left on them, and trim the roots as equally as possible. When all are done place them on a clean cloth, wrap them up, shake lightly, and then arrange in circles on a dish, which will look all the prettier for a light border of water- cress or small salad. Radishes are not often served hot, but when young and fresh they are very good boiled. Wash and trim them in the same manner as for salad, throw them into plenty of boiling water well salted, and boil until tender, they will probably take half an hour. When done, drain, and send to table covered with butter sauce. Watercress. Wash, trim and pick the cress, drain it in a colander, put it into a dry, clean cloth and gently shake it about until all moisture is absorbed. Arrange the cress in circles on a flat dish, and serve within an hour of preparing it, as it will lose its crispness if left standing too long.

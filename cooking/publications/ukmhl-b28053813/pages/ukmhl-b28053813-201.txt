LITTLE DISHES. *79 a pound of fat bacon. Allow these to fry very gently for a quarter of an hour, taking care not to let the liver or bacon become the least brown. Pound the liver and bacon in a mortar, if necessary add salt, spread a layer of this about an inch thick at the bottom of the pie; cut up the livers of the geese into neat pieces about an inch square, slice some truffles and press them both into the forcemeat, lightly sprinkle with salt and pepper, and then fill, up the pie with forcemeat, put on the cover, finish as pork pie, and bake in a moderate oven for an hour and a quarter. Pressed Beef. Take a nice square piece of the thick flank, cure it lightly as directed for spiced beef (p. 34), boil it in stock with a bay leaf and an onion and a bundle of sweet herbs. When perfectly tender place it between two dishes with heavy weights on the top. The next day trim it neatly and glaze. This looks nice, and is improved if when cold it is cut to the size of a deep tin dish, and when placed in it a clear meat jelly is poured over so as to run well underneath it. When turned on to its dish to be served, the meat should be found covered with a brio-lit clear jelly, a quarter to half an inch thick.

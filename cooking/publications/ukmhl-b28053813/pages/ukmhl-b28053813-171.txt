LITTLE DISHES. 149 sticking together. Put this by way of garnish round the dish on which you have placed the leg of lamb. Veal a la Casserole. For this dish a piece of the fillet about three inches thick will be required, and weighing from two to three pounds. It should be cut from one side of the leg, with- out bone ; but sometimes butchers object to give it, as cutting in this manner interferes with cutlets. In such a case a piece must be chosen near the knuckle, and the bone be taken out before cooking. For a larger party, a thick slice of the fillet, weighing about four pounds, will be found advantageous. With a piece of tape tie the veal into a round shape, Hour, and put it into a stewpan with a small piece of butter, fry until it becomes brown on all sides. Then put half a pint of good gravy nicely seasoned with pepper and salt, cover the stewpan closely, and set it on the stove to cook very slowly for, at least, four hours. When done, the veal will be exquisitely tender, full of flavour, but not the least ragged. Take the meat up, and keep hot whilst the gravy is reduced, by boiling without the lid of the sauce- pan, to a rich glaze, which pour over the meat, and serve.

io6 EVERY DAY MEALS. long time. When the cook is at leisure, she should get a quantity of crumbs ready, for if not at hand when wanted she will be placed at a disadvantage. The bread-crumbs being ready, they should have two tablespoonfuls of flour, half a teaspoonful of salt, and a large pinch of pepper mixed with them to the proportion of a quarter of a pound of crumbs. As a matter of eco- nomy, both the white and yolk of an egg may be used for egging the fish, but it is better to use the yolk only with a very little of the white. Unless the fish has been most thoroughly dried in a cloth, the egg and crumbs will not adhere properly. The frying-pans in ordinary use will not admit of sufficient fat being used to cover the fish ; it is, therefore, necessary to turn it, which can be readily managed when the fish is half done, that is, properly browned on the under side. The fat must be the right temperature when the fish goes in, that is 350Â°, which will give the usual domestic test of browning instantly a piece of bread dipped in it. Any one with the least experience should know when fried fish is done without cutting it. If a fork or skewer is thrust into the thickest part of the fish, it will stick and be difficult to withdraw if the fish is not done, but if, on the contrary, it is done, the fork will come out with great ease. Large thick fish are not suit- able for frying whole, they should be filleted, stewed, or boiled.

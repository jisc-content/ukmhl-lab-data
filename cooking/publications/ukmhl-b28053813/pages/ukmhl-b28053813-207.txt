LITTLE DISHES. 185 Croquettes of Salmon. With a wooden spoon beat up to a paste half-a-pound of cooked salmon and mix it with the following sauce :â€” Put one ounce of fine flour into a stewpan with half a gill of cold water, stir this over' a slow fire very rapidly until it forms a paste, then add one ounce of butter, and stir until well incorporated. Mix in a small teaspoonful of essence of shrimps or anchovies, with a pinch of salt and pepper. Take the stewpan off the fire and stir the yolk of an egg briskly into the sauce, thoroughly mix it with the pounded salmon, spread it out on a plate until it is cool. Flour your hands, take a small piece of the croquette mixture, roll into a ball, or into the shape of a cork, then pass it through very finely-sifted and dried bread-crumbs- dip into beaten egg and again into the crumbs. Repeat the process until all the mixture is used, put the croquettes as you do them into a wire frying-basket, which shake very gently, when all are placed in it, in order to free them from superfluous crumbs. Have ready a stewpan half full of boiling fat, dip the basket in, gently moving it about and taking care the croquettes are covered with fat. In about a minute they will become a delicate brown, and will then be done. Turn them on to paper to absorb any superfluous fat, serve them on a napkin or ornamental dish paper.

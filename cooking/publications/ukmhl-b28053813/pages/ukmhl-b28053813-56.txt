34 EVERY DAY MEALS, clock, for the cook to say to herself, “ they must boil until,” for instance, “ one minute past number three,” or “ four minutes past number three,” as the case may be ; thus the time for taking up the eggs is impressed on the memory, which, if other things engage the attention, is important. New-laid eggs, if to be well set, require to be boiled for four minutes; eggs which have been kept some time take three minutes to set. The eggs of some fowls, and those which have been preserved in lime, have often very thin shells, and are apt to burst when im- mersed in boiling water. It will generally be found that bursting of the shell will be prevented by putting the eggs into a saucepan of cold water, and allowing it to come slowly to the boiling point. Should the eggs be required lightly cooked, they will be done as soon as the water boils ; but if it is desired to have them firm, they should be allowed to remain in the water off the fire for a minute or two.

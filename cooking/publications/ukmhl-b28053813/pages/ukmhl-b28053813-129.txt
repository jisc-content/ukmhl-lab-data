107 FISH. Fried Sole. Soles weighing from three-quarters of a pound to a pound are the most suitable size for frying whole. If it is desired to have the fish juicy and with their full flavour, do not have them skinned. The black side of the soles will not of course look so well or be so crisp as the white side, but this is of little consequence compared to the nourishment sacrificed in removing the skin. Have the soles scraped, wipe them, put a tablespoonful of vinegar in a dish, pass the fish through it, and let them lie an hour, or more, if convenient, as the flavour is thus improved. When ready to crumb the fish, lay them in a cloth and thoroughly dry them. Beat up the yolk of an egg with a very little of the white, this will be sufficient to egg a pair of soles, pass the fish through the egg on both sides, hold it up to drain, have ready on a plate a quarter of a pound of very fine dry crumbs; mixed with flour, salt, and pepper. Draw the fish over the crumbs, first on one side, then on the other, and lay it gently on a dish black side down- wards, whilst you prepare another. Some people succeed better in crumbing fish by sifting the crumbs on to it through a very fine strainer after it is egged. When the fish are ready, put them black side downwards into the frying-pan with plenty of fat, hot enough to brown a piece of bread instantaneously, move the pan about gently, and

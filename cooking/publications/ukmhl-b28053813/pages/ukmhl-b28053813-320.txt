EVERY DAY MEALS. 298 three lemons, and one orange. Peel the orange and lemons very thin, pour a gallon of boiling water on them, and break up the fruit. Crush the ginger, and tie it loosely in a muslin bag ; boil it with the sugar for a quarter of an hour in a portion of the whole quantity of water to be used. Mix the boiled sugar, ginger, peel, and fruit together, and put them into the cask, and then add the remainder of the water. Stir this up, and when tepid, put in a toast dipped in yeast. In ten days’ time put the bung in the barrel, and let the wine remain for at least four months before bottling it. The colour of the wine will be improved by adding a little burnt sugar, and a bottle of gin or brandy may be put to it a month before bottling. It is a good plan to have a zinc or wooden tap in the cask, so that the wine may be tested from time to time. If it appears cloudy, tie some isinglass—two ounces to ten gallons—in a muslin bag, attach it by a string to the bung, and let it remain a month in the wine. Strength and flavour are imparted to ginger wine by adding raisins, half-a-pound to a gallon of water is suffi- cient. Split open, but do not stone the fruit, and put them into the cask with the ginger. This wine is excel- lent made on the lees of cowslip wine ; and in this case it will not be necessary to use so many oranges and lemons. /

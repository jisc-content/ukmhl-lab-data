LITTLE DISHES. 21 I Mint Sauce. We all know badly made mint sauce, which has a heavy deposit of coarse sugar, and requires to be stirred when served to each person. If made as follows, the flavour will be very fine, and the sugar will not sink to the bottom of the tureen :â€” Wash and chop very fine the leaves of fresh green mint, about a large tablespoonful, put it into the sauce tureen with a gill of water and allow it to stand one hour. Mix in by degrees four ounces of raw sugar, or as much as the water will dissolve, this done, add sufficient vine- gar to give the required sharpness, observing that mint sauce should not be too acid. Boiled Cheese. Put four tablespoonfuls of beer into a small saucepan, shred into it a quarter of a pound of good new cheese, and stir bidskly over the fire until all is dissolved and it is on the point of boiling, then take it off instantly, for if the cheese is allowed to boil it will become tous:h. Have ready slices of toasted bread, spread the cheese on it, and serve as quickly as possible.

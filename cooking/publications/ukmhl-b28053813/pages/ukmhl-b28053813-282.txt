Should the brewer’s or home-made yeast be at all stale it is desirable to “ set sponge” over night, or at any rate some hours before the bread is kneaded. Mix the yeast with half a pint of warm water, make a little well in the centre of the flour in the pan, and with the fingers de- tach a little flour, and stir it in lightly until a thick batter is formed, then sprinkle flour on the top, cover over the pan with a cloth, and leave it to rise in a temperature of 80°. When ready to knead the bread, pour into the leaven the required quantity of tepid water slightly salted, and mix it gradually with the whole of the flour, working from the middle to the sides. It must be remembered that it is impossible to work the dough too much, and that when finished it should be very smooth, light, and dry. The oven should be very hot for the first five to ten minutes of baking the bread—about 570°—and then it should be lowered to 430°, or a little less. Very few ovens in England being fitted with thermometers, it is necessary to ascertain the heat by sprinkling a little flour on a baking-sheet, if it brown within two minutes of put- ting it in the oven, the heat will be right for beginning to bake the bread. The addition of potatoes to bread in small quantities is generally approved, but not more than one pound should be used to seven pounds of flour. Wash, peel, and boil

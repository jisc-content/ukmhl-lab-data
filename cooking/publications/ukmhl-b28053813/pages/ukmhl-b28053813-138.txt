The reason so few persons succeed in making a satis- factory mayonnaise sauce is that they do not give the necessary time and patience. Three-quarters of an hour is the time required for making half-a-pint of mayonnaise, and, of course, for a larger quantity somewhat longer. For a pint of sauce, put the yolks of two large eggs, perfectly free from white, into a marble mortar, mix in two large pinches of salt, and then with the pestle work in drop by drop two teaspoonfuls of oil. Have ready mixed a desertspoonful each of French vinegar, of tarragon vinegar, and of chili vinegar. Work in a few drops of the vinegar, and then another teaspoonful of oil, proceed in this manner until the sauce begins to get thick, when rather more oil may be added at a time. Three gills of oil will be about the quantity required, and if the sauce has been successfully made it will be as thick and white as Devonshire cream. Great care should be taken in selecting the materials for mayonnaise sauce, and nothing is so disagreeable as the flavour of inferior oil. An imitation mayonnaise may be used if there is not time to make the above. Prepare a quart of rich white sauce, and, when cold, flavour it with tarragon and chili vinegars.

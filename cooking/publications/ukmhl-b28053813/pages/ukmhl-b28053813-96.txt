Boil a tablespoonful of capers with half a pint of water in a stewpan without the lid for ten minutes. Mash the capers with a wooden spoon so as to bruise each one.

When it has thickened stir in an ounce of butter, let it dissolve, add a pinch of salt, and, if the sauce is not sufficiently acid, a little vinegar. When the bottle containing capers is put away, take care to fill it up with fresh vinegar, as this prevents mould and loss of flavour.

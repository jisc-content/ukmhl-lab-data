EVERY DAY MEALS. 162 little gravy, flavoured with mushrooms or lemon-juice, poured round the dish. Brain Fritters. Procure an ox brain, carefully wash it, and boil it for a quarter of an hour in well-seasoned stock. When the brain is cold, cut it into slices as thin as possible, dip each of them in hatter, drop them as you do them into fat at a temperature of 430°, or that which will brown instantly a piece of bread dipped into it. To make the hatter, mix two large tablespoonfuls of fine flour with four of cold water, mix in a tablespoonful of dissolved butter or of fine oil, the yolk of an egg, ana a pinch of salt and pepper. Let the batter stand for two hours, and when- ready to use, beat the white of the egg to a strong froth, and mix « with it. Do not fry more than two fritters at once ; as you take them up, throw them on paper to absorb any grease cnnging to them, serve on a napkin or ornamental dish paper If this recipe is closely followed, the fritters will be light, crisp, delicate morsels, melting in the mouth, and form besides a very pietty dish. Garnish with fried parsley; take care the parsley is thoroughly dry, put it into a small frying-basket, and immerse it for an instant in the fat in which the fritters were cooked. Turn it out on paper, dry, and serve.

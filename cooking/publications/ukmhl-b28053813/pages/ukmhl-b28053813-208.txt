EVERY DAY MEALS. 186 No more croquettes than will lie at the bottom of the basket without touching each other should be fried at one time. Savoury Rice Croquettes. The quickest and best way to prepare rice for croquettes is to bake it, and care must be had to have it dry, or it will be difficult to mould. Wash a quarter of a pound of fine rice, put it into a pie-dish with a pint of milk, break half-an-ounce of butter in to prevent the rice getting hard on the top. Bake for an hour, or until the rice is dry. When done, take off the brown skin, and, whilst the rice is still hot, stir in the yolk of an egg ; pepper and salt to taste. Let it get cold. Have ready some finely-minced well seasoned meat, or paste, prepared as for salmon croquettes, flour your hands, and roll up little pieces about the thickness of the fourth Anger, and less than an inch long. Again flour your hand, spread out a spoonful, and put your meat in the middle of it, fold over the rice so as to enclose this, and make the croquettes into the shape of an egg. Finish as directed above. The quantity of rice given will make about twelve croquettes. Sweet Croquettes of rice are made in the same manner as the above. Substitute sugar for salt, and flavour the rice with grated lemon peel. Use a dried cherry, plum, or apple marmalade, and finish as above.

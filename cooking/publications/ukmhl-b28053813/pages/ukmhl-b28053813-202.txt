j8o EVERY DAY MEALS. Rolled Beef. Choose a piece of the thick flank long enough to roll well, about four pounds will be enough for a small collar- ing tin, put it into a pickle as directed for spiced beef. When about to cook, take out the bones and gristle and remove all skin, roll the meat round, secure it with string, and boil gently until it is perfectly tender. Re- move the string, put the meat into the collaring tin, set a weight on the top, and let it stand until the next day. The bones, &c., taken out of the meat should be boiled in the water with it. Galantine. * Salt the rind of a loin of pork for a few days. It must not have on it more than a quarter of an inch of fat. When required for use soak it to make it roll well, lay it flat, and place on it a layer of lean ham, then one of sausage-meat, or other forcemeat, highly seasoned with pepper, salt, and sweet herbs, mixed into a paste with an egg and one-fourth of its weight in fine bread-crumbs, and made very tasty with essence of anchovy; pass a knife twice over a clove of garlic and stir the mixture, and, if not objected to, add a minced shalot.

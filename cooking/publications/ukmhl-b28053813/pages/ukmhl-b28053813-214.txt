Fry a third onion in a quarter of a pound of butter, take it out, and having mixed a spoonful of turmeric in a little water; stir it into the butter over the fire for five minutes, taking care it does not burn. To this put all the other ingredients, with the fried onions, stirring well together. As soon as it boils add a little water, and repeat this as often as necessary until the meat becomes tender, when put as much water as will cover it, and let it simmer until the gravy is much reduced. This dish requires five hours to prepare and simmer it, as well as great care and attention during the whole process. Only sufficient turmeric to give a yellow- ish tinge must be used; if coriander is liked, it maybe added. Curried Eggs are used as an entree and a breakfast dish.

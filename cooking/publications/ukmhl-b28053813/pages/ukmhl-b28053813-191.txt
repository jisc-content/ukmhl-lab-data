169 LITTLE DISHES. ferior for good material as the sausage. The spices and flavouring substances employed are most cleverly chosen, and any flavour required is by their use imparted to the meat. Thus, liver, lights, and other inferior portions of beef, mutton, pork, or any other of—shall we say—the edible animals, are all ground up together, and then seasoned according to the requirements of customers, as beef or pork sausages, bread and water being added in large proportions. It is surprising to find that in these days, when sausages can be most easily and successfully made at home by a small machine, that they are less so made than when there were no machines suitable for household use. Even thirty years ago all home-made sausages were laboriously chopped and filled by hand, the last process being one requiring a good deal of skill and patience. One of the first difficulties which has to be met is procuring the skins for the sausages, these can always be had at shops where the machines are sold, and the butcher who sup- plies the pork should, on due notice being given, obtain them fresh for customers. There are a number of sausage- machines of various makers, but Kent’s Combination Mincer is by far the best and most useful, as it chops suet, prepares meat for potting without the aid of the pestle and mortar, and does, besides, with different simple ad- justments, a variety of mincing operations.

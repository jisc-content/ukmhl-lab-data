EVERY DAY MEALS. 2 18 to make it large enough to line the edges of the dish, and make the cover. Put two or three strips of the folded paste on the edges, then put on the cover in the usual way, and bake the tart in a moderate oven for three- quarters of an hour, or until the juice boils, and the crust on the top is firm to the touch. For large families it is often difficult to put fruit in proportion to the crust. In this case, if the apples are boiled in a stewpan with a little water over a slow fire for a short time, they will so reduce as to allow nearly double the quantity of uncooked apples to be put in the pie-dish. In all cases where apples are of a slow-cooking kind, this plan should be adopted, as it prevents the crust being kept too long in the oven. Currants and Cherries for tarts eat much richer if stewed before baking. Boil the fruit very gently until half cooked, then sweeten and put into the tart-dish. In the case of currant and raspberry tart, the currants only should be stewed, and the raspberries be added afterwards, as these last cook quickly.

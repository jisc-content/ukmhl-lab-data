136 EVERY DAY MEALS. Baked Tripe with Potatoes. Put a pound of tripe, cut into neat squares, in a stew- ing-pot, with four shred onions, a small teaspoonful of pepper, and one of salt, and enough stock or water to cover it. Let it cook in a slow oven for three hours, taking care to fill up the pot should the liquor dry up. When the tripe is perfectly tender strain away the gravy, from which remove all fat, and make it as thick as cream with flour. Put the gravy and tripe into a pie-dish, and make a cover of mashed potatoes, and hake for ten minutes, or until the pasty is hot throughout. The potatoes should be brown on the top. Cow Heel. Stew the heel gently after it comes from the shop as cooked, for four hours, with four onions, a bay-leaf, two cloves, and sufficient pepper and salt to season the water highly. When done take the meat from the bones, cut it into neatly shaped pieces, egg, bread-crumb, and fry them in a little butter until brown. Let the bread-crumbs be highly seasoned. The heel can be served without sauce, but a puree of tomatoes or mushrooms goes well with it.

PASTRY AND PUDDINGS. ?T7 Apple Tart. Divide the apples in quarters, take out the core, and pare them. Observe that apples are more quickly pared when cut in quarters than when whole. If the apples are of a moderate size, leave them in quarters, or at any rate in eight pieces, sliced apples are apt to be hardened by being baked with sugar. To a pound of good sharp apples, put six ounces of brown sugar and a gill of water, mix thoroughly together and put into a deep pie-dish. The crust is to be made of suet and must be eaten hot. If properly managed this crust will be as light as puff pastry made with butter, and is much cheaper and more digestible. Take a quarter of a pound of beef-suet, “ kidney knob ” is the most free from skin, and is also the hardest piece ; shave it as fine as possible, weigh a quarter of a pound of the best flour and take a little of the suet, with about the same quantity of flour, and roll together into flakes, repeat this until all the suet and flour are rolled together. Gather it into a heap on the board, and moisten by degrees with half-a-gill of cold water. Koll the paste out to the thickness of half-an-inch, beat it for a minute in order that any little lumps may be broken up. Now roll the paste out until as thin as a wafer, and then fold over

EVERY DAY MEALS. 5Â° 1 but it can be most successfully cooked slowly in the frying-pan, or, to use the French term, be saute. The idea that bacon is so fat in itself that it does not require other fat in which to cook it is erroneous, a small quantity of butter, bacon-fat, or lard is absolutely necessary. When the fat is hot put the slices of bacon in the frying-pan, which hold over a slow fire. Turn the bacon repeatedly, taking care there is no sound of frying, but only a gentle movement of the fat. To cook bacon properly in the frying-pan allow from ten to twelve minutes, and do not let it become the least brown. Potted Salmon. Pick the fish carefully from the bones and pound it to a paste in a mortar. Put it in an earthenware jar, which place in a saucepan of boiling water. As soon as the fish gets hot stir in a fourth of its weight of fresh butter and a little essence of shrimps or of anchovies to heighten the flavour. If necessary add a little salt and Cayenne pepper to taste. Stir the fish occasionally until nearly cold, then press it into small pots, and the next day cover them with clarified butter or other good fat. Any kind of fish can be potted in this way, and will keep for a week or ten days.

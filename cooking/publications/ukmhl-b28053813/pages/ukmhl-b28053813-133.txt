FISH. hi for half an hour, then add four onions, a turnip, carrot, small bundle of sweet herbs, blade of mace, half-a-dozen white peppercorns, and when it has again boiled for an hour, strain it through a napkin. Let it stand until cold remove all the fat, boil it up, and to a pint and a half of the liquor put an ounce of Nelsonâ€™s gelatine, previously- soaked in cold water, add salt and a pinch of cayenne pepper, and when the jelly is cool stir in the whites and shells of three eggs well beaten. Let the jelly boil briskly for two minutes, let it stand off the fire for a few minutes, then strain through *a jelly-bag and use as directed. Take the fillets of a pair of large, thick soles, cut them into neat square pieces, leaving the trimmings for other dishes, and jay them in vinegar with a little salt for an hour. As they must be kept very white, the best French vinegar should be used. Boil the fillets gently in salted water with a little vinegar until done, take them up and dry them on a cloth. Have ready some picked parsley and hard-boiled eggs cut in quarters; arrange these neatly at the bottom of a plain mould so as to form a pretty pattern. Pour in very gently enough jelly to cover the first layer, let it stand until beginning to set, then put another layer of fish, eggs, and parsley, then more jelly, and so on until the mould is full. When done put the mould on ice, or allow it to stand twelve hours in a cold place to get well set. Turn it out, ornament with parsley, beetroot, and cut lemon.

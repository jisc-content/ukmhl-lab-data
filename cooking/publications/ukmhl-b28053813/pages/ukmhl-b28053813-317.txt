Then strain the liquor through a sieve, pressing the fruit, and put it into the- cask.

Do not put in the bung for ten days, and having done so, allow the wine to stand for six months, then draw it off into a clean cask, and allow it to stand for two months. At the expiration of this time, if the wine is tolerably clear it may be left for another six months with a bag of isinglass attached to the bung ; but if thick must be again racked into a clean cask.

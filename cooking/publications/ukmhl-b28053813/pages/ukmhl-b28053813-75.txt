Cut neat thin slices from a leg of either roasted or boiled mutton, dip them in yolk of egg, and in fine dry bread-crumbs, to which a little flour, pepper, and salt has been added. Boil enough butter in a small frying-pan to just cover the bottom, put in the slices of mutton, cook them very slowly, first on one side, then on the other until they are brown. Garnish the dish in which the mutton is served with the potato snow, fried potatoes, or potato chips.

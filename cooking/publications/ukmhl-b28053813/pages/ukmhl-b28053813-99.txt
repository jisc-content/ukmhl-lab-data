With the steak-tongs turn the steak every minute, this prevents the possibility of its getting dry, as well as the loss of gravy. A steak of average thickness will take from ten to twelve i minutes to broil properly. If there is no objection to the flavour of shalot, shred one as finely as possible, put it on the dish on which the steak is to be served with a slice of buttei', put it into the oven whilst the steak is cooking. Home-made catsup may be substituted for the shalot, or butter alone be used. When the steak is done, pass it on both sides through the butter, sprinkle over it a little more pepper and salt, and take care to serve very hot. Should the fire be slow, the steak must only be turned every two minutes, and when done it should be a rich brown on both sides. The cooks of fifty years ago were averse from the prac- tice of beating steaks; and, no doubt, in those days, when the edible animals, as a rule, were kept to a proper age before killing, and it was thought disgraceful to fatten up old cows or worn-out ewes for the market, it was un- necessary. Dr. Kitchener says:—“ Do not beat steaks, which vulgar trick breaks the cells in which the gravy of the meat is contained, and it becomes dry and tasteless. N.B. If your butcher sends steaks which are not tender, we do not insist that you should object to let him be beaten! ”

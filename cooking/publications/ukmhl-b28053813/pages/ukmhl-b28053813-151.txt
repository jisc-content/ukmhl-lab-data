FISH. 129 Scalloped Lobster. Strain the liquor from a tin of preserved lobster into a basin, mix with it two tablespoonfuls of fine flour, and stir on to it a gill of boiling water. Put this into a stewpan with an ounce of fresh butter, and stir until thick ; add a teaspoonful of essence of anchovy, and a pinch of cayenne pepper; pick any bits of shell or cartilage from the lobster, and add it to the sauce. Butter a tin dish, put in it a thick layer of bread-crumbs and on this the lobster; cover with a thick layer of crumbs, spread bits of butter thickly on the top, and bake in a quick oven for fifteen minutes. If not brown, use the salamander, or colour before the fire in Dutch oven. Lobster en Beignets. Preserved lobster answers very well for these. Moir’s or Bray and Hayes’ are the best brands. Divide the lobster into as nice pieces as you can—the smaller answers well for sauce or scalloping—and dip each into a good frying batter as directed for ox brains, but adding to it a little cayenne pepper and a few drops of Burgess’s Essence of Anchovies. Fry the beignets quickly in oil or good fat, and serve hot.

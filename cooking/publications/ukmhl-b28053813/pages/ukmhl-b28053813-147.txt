FISH. 125 The cheapest fish pie is made of red herrings or dried haddock. Put the herrings after cleaning them into as much boiling water as will cover them, and simmer them for one minute. Take out the fish, wipe them, take off the skin, and remove the backbone, holding the herring in one hand and pressing it with the thumb and finger of the other; the bone should then come out whole, and be very careful none is left. Pick the fish into small flakes, and mix it with a spoonful or two of dissolved dripping. Have ready for each herring half-a-pound of mashed potatoes seasoned witâ€™ll pepper and salt, put a thick layer in a pie-dish, then cover up with the remainder of the potatoes and bake in a slow oven for a quarter of an hour. Make a sauce to eat with the pie, by boiling the bones and skin of the fish in a little water. When done, strain them, boil up the liquor and thicken it with flour mixed smooth in cold water, add pepper and salt, and if liked, a few drops of vinegar. A small quantity of any kind of pickle chopped and made hot in the sauce is very good. To make the pie of dried haddock, proceed as for herrings, but simmer the haddock for five minutes. A little chopped parsley is a great improvement to this dish.

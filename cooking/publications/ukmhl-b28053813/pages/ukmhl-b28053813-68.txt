EVERY DAY MEALS. . 46 keep it for future use, and pound the meat in the mortar until perfectly smooth. To each pound of meat put a quarter of a pound of fresh, butter or of cold boiled fat bacon pounded in the mortar, two tablespoonfuls of essence of anchovy, a small teaspoonful of pepper and salt to taste. Put the meat into the covered jar as before and let it cook gently until the mass is hot through. When taken up stir occasionally until nearly cold, then press it into little pots, and the next day pour over each, so as effectually to exclude the air, sufficient clarified butter or mutton suet to cover it. The meat which has been used for making beef tea answers well for potting, and much time and trouble is saved by the use of Kent’s Combination Mincer (Topham’s patent), instead of the pestle and mortar. This machine by a special action reduces the meat to a fine pulp with great ease and rapidity, and is besides invaluable for all kinds of mincing operations. * BROILED OR DEVILLED CHICKEN LEGS.—EGGS SUR LE PLAT.—SHEEPS’ TONGUES, Broiled or Devilled Chicken Legs.

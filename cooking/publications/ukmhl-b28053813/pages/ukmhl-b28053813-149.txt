127 FISH. The cases for savoury trifles of any kind should not be so deep as those for ramakins; about three-quarters of an inch deep and two inches wide is the best size. To make the cases, cut thin white writing paper into rounds four inches in diameter. Now take a wood block (one on which drapers roll ribbon answers perfectly), and shape the case into the form of a patty-pan, neatly fold over the edge of the paper, and crimp it to keep the case in shape. Take the beard off the oysters, and simmer them for two minutes in two or three tablespoonfuls of water, strain them, put the oyster liquor to that obtained from the beards with the juice of a small lemon, let it boil and stir in a tablespoonful of fine flour, mixed smooth in two tablespoonfuls of milk or cream, stir very rapidly for four minutes, as this sauce will be very thick ; now add an ounce of butter, and a large pinch of cayenne pepper. Chop the oysters, or if you can manage it, break them up with a silver knife or fork, put them into the sauce, cover the saucepan with its lid, and let it stand on the range for five minutes, taking the greatest care that there is no approach to boiling; the heat of the sauce should be sufficient to cook the oysters, boiling or simmffcring would ruin the dish. Take a feather and brush over the paper cases with fine salad oil, or dissolved butter; fill them with the oyster mixture. Hand round the dish with one case to each

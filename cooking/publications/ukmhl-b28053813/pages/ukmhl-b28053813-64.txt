Make a little gravy with the bones and trim- mings of the pork, it must be strong enough to jelly, and be nicely seasoned with pepper and salt. When the pie is cold remove the rose from the top, make a little hole, in- sert a small funnel, and pour in as much gravy as the pie will hold, which will be about a gill. Keplace the rose on the top, and put the pie on a dish with a cut paper. If preferred, the pie can be made in a tin mould, but the crust is nicer raised by the hand. A great point to observe is to begin moulding the crust whilst it is hot, and to get it finished as quickly as possible. Baked Soles. Small soles called “ slips ” are excellent baked, and are generally to be bought at a reasonable price. Scrape, but do not skin, the soles ; dissolve a little butter in a baking tin, pass the white side of the fish through it, sift very fine dry bread-crumbs seasoned with pepper and salt over this, lay the sole black side downward in the baking-dish, and bake in a quick oven for twenty minutes. If when done the soles are not browned the salamander must be used. As a breakfast dish the soles should be served without any sauce.

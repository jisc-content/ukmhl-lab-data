DIETS 11 earthenware vessel and the pot thoroughly cleansed. Vegetable may be added to the stock after the scum has been removed. Vegetable soups are often made without stock. For a White stock use a knuckle of veal, rabbit, calvesâ€™ foot, or fowls. For Brown stock use shin of beef or the lower part of a round of beef. DIETS The following considerations should be taken into account when constructing dietaries, namely, the age of the persons, climate and occupation. For young children meals should be regular, light and frequent, because the digestive organs are not strong. The greater percentage of the diet should consist of milk. Per- sons over forty years of age require less food, because the tissues are fully developed ; if taken in excess, the digestive organs are overloaded and cannot fulfil their functions. Per- sons engaged in manual labour require more nitrogenous food than those leading a sedentary life ; they can digest it easily, and it is needed to replace the waste in the body. 'When not engaged in active physical work the circulation is not so quick, and digestion is slower. In this case, fish and eggs should occupy a chief place in the diet. Diets should be mixed, the food palatable and digestible, so that it can be absorbed into the blood and nourish the body. Meals must be regular, and the interval between each should be long enough to allow for complete digestion in the stomach.

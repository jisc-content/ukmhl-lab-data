MANAGEMENT OF STOVES 14 Do not buy inferior goods, as this is false economy. Make a list of the articles required in the kitchen for the next dayâ€™s work, and order what is necessary in good time. Before purchasing, inquire the price of the goods and take every pains to judge the quality of food stuffs. Mutton and Beef should be firm, well flavoured, economical in cooking, and the colour bright and uniform. To ascertain whether fish is fresh, the gills should be red and the eyes bright, the flesh stiff and rigid, the skin smooth and not blistered, but closely adhering to the flesh. Salmon, Cod and large white fish should have a bronze tint when freshly cut. Poultry must be young and in good condition. Fowls should have soft feet and necks, the spur hardly formed, the breastbone must not be broken, and it should be soft and resemble gristle. Apples, cheese, flour, oatmeal, onions, potatoes, salt, soap, sugar and tea can be purchased more economically in large quantities, but if the storing space is limited, this must not be attempted. Salt should be cut into small blocks and wrapped in paper. Cut the bars of soap into pieces with string and store in a dry cupboard. Tea must be kept in a canister. Potatoes should be spread out on a cellar floor and covered with a piece of sacking. To store Onions, tie the stalks together and hang them from a nail. Flour must be kept in a wooden bin with an air-tight lid. THE MANAGEMENT OF STOVES To Clean a Kitchen Range Rake out all the cinders and dust from the fireplace.

57 MEATS 5. Roast for two hours. The liver should be placed in the pan when the bird has been in the oven one and a hall hours. 6. Serve hot with apple sauce, ROAST TURKEY Buy a prepared turkey which has been drawn, singed and the sinews removed. 1. Wash and dry the bird. 2. Turn the skin back and cut off the neck close to the back. 3. Fill the crop with veal stuffing. Fasten the skin down with a skewer on to the back of the bird. 4. Finish the trussing, fastening the gizzard on one side and the liver on the other, in between the pinions. 5. Roast in front of the fire or place on a tin in the oven and baste well. Allow three hours for a large bird and two for one weighing about eight pounds. 6. Garnish with rolls of broiled bacon and baked sausages. 7. Serve with a nice brown gravy and bread sauce. N.B.â€”It is more economical to garnish with the sausages than to stuff the turkey with sausage meat. For a fowl allow one hour for roasting and the breast may be stuffed with sausage meat if liked. For a chicken allow about three quarters of an hour in a hot oven.

8 THE PRINCIPLES OF COOKING Roasting is the process of cooking before a fire. To accom- plish this successfully a clear fire is necessary, which should be made up often and not allowed to get down. Place a sheet of newspaper on the hearth under the basting-tin. Hang the meat on a “ jack ” so that the thickest part is immediately opposite the hottest part of the fire. (A skein of worsted may be substituted for a jack.) The meat should be placed close to the fire for the first ten minutes to harden the surface. In this manner the juices are retained in the joint. A metal roasting screen is useful to concentrate and radiate the heat on the joint. The joint should be dredged with a little flour, and must be well basted during the process of cooking. Time allowed for roasting : quarter of an hour for every pound and quarter of an hour over. For veal and pork allow twenty minutes to each pound and twenty minutes over. Grilling or broiling may be done over or in front of the fire. A clear fire is necessary, and the gridiron must be warmed. This method of cooking is suitable for chops and steaks, which take from ten to fifteen minutes to cook, the time varying according to the thickness of the meat. When turn- ing the meat, forks must not be used ; if steak tongs are not available, use the blade of a knife. Baking is the term applied to cooking in a closed oven. The oven should be well ventilated and very clean, or the meat will be sodden and unpalatable. A double baking tin, fitted with a grid, should be used' The meat must be weighed, wiped with a damp cloth, and placed upon the grid. The joint is placed in the hottest part of the oven from five to ten minutes to harden the surface so that the juices do not escape. Reduce the heat by pushing in the oven damper, and remove the meat to a cooler part of the oven. Baste

PREFACE This little book, which, claims to provide no more than is indicated by its title, is based to a large extent on material provided by Mrs. Louise E. Smith. My work has, in the main, been limited to selection and arrangement of the material placed at my disposal; though where it has seemed to me necessary or desirable, I have supplemented Mrs. Smithâ€™s recipes by others of my own.

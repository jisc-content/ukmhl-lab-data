THE PRINCIPLES OF COOKING 16 4. Clean the lid with Brook’s soap, and polish with powdered whitening.

To Clean a Pastry Board 1. Dip a dishcloth into a bowl of hot water and wet the board all over. 2. Sprinkle a little silver sand on the board and scrub well with the grain, turn over and repeat the process. 3. Rinse well with plenty of water. 4. Rub with a cloth and stand in a current of air to dry. To keep the boards white do not use soda in the water or place near the fire to dry. To Clean Knives. Stand the blades only in a jug of hot water, rub each knife with a damp dishcloth and dry with a knife cloth. Sprinkle a little patent powder or bath brick on to a knife board, and rub the blade of the knife backwards and forwards on the board until it is quite bright and all the stains have disappeared. Each knife must be dusted before it is put into the knife box. To Clean a Baking Tin. If necessary, scrape the tin with an old knife. Scrub with silver sand and soap, finish cleaning with Brook’s soap and polish with powdered whitening. To Wash a Pudding Cloth.

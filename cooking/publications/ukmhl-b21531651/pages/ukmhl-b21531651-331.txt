DIRECTIONS TOR SERVANTS. 307 To take Iron-stains out of Marble. An equal quantity of fresh spirit of vitriol and lemon- juice being mixed in a bottle, shake it well; wet the spots, and in a few minutes rub with soft linen till they disappear. To preserve Irons from Hust. Melt fresh mutton-suet, smear over the iron with it while hot; then dust well with unslacked lime pound- ed, and tied up in a muslin. Irons so prepared will keep many months. Use no oil for them at any time, except salad-oil; there being water in all others. Fire-irons should be kept wrapt m baize, m a dry place, when not used. , Another way.—Beat into three pounds of unsalted hogs’ lard, two drachms of camphor sliced thin, till it is dissolved; then take as much black-lead as will mako it of the colour of broken steel. Dip a rag into it, and rub it thick on the stove, &c. and the steel will never rust, even if wet. When it is to be used, the grease must be washed off with hot water, and the steel be dried before polishing. To take Bust out of Steel. Cover the steel with sweet-oil well rubbed in, and in forty-eight hours use unslacked lime finely powdered, and rub until all the rust disappears. To clean the Back of the Orate, the inner Hearth, and the fronts of Cast-iron Stoves. Boil about a quarter of a pound of the best black lead with a pint of small heer, and a bit of soap the size of a walnut. When that is melted, dip a painter s brush, and wet the grate, having first brushed ofi all the soot and dust; then take a hard brush, and rub it till of a beautiful brightness. Another Way to clean Cast Iron, and black Hearths. Mix black lead and whites of eggs well beaten to- gether ; dip a painter’s brush, and wet all over; then rub it bright with a hard brush.

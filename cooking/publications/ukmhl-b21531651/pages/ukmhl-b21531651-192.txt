DOMESTIC COOKEEY. 1GS Another way.—Press the whey from as much curd as will make two dozen small ones; then put it on the back of a sieve, and with half an ounce of butter rub it through with the back of a spoon ; put to it six yolks, and three whites of eggs, and a few bitter almonds, pounded with as much sugar as will make the curd properly sweet: mix with it the rind of a lemon grated, and a glass of brandy. Put a puff paste into the pans, and ten minutes will bake them.

Put a sponge-cake into a deep China or glass dish, pour round it some white wine (raisin is very suitable) and a wine-glass of brandy. Let the cakes soak up the wine, and then strew sifted sugar over it, and pour in the dish a rich thick custard. Ornament the top of the cake by sticking a light flower in the centre, or bits of clear currant-jelly, or blanch and split some sweet almonds, and stick them thickly over the cake.

Then take some very fine dry flour

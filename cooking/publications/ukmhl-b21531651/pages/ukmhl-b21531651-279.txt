WINES, &C. 255 skim it; when cold put a little to a quarter of a pint of yeast, and so by degrees add a little more. In an hour pour the small quantity to the large, pour the liquor on clary-flowers, picked in the dry; the quan- tity for the above is twelve quarts. Those who gather from their own garden may not have sufficient to put in at once, and may add as they can get them, keeping account of each quart. When it ceases to luss, and the flowers are all in, stop it up for four months.

Put two hundred weight of Malaga raisips into a cask, and pour upon them a hogshead of good sound cyder that is not rough; stir it well two or three days; stop it, and let it stand six months; then rack into a cask, that it will fill, and put in a gallon of the best brandy. If raisin wine be much used, it would answer well to keep a cask always for it, and bottle off one yearâ€™s wine just in time to make the next, which, al- lowing the six months of infusion, would make the wme to be eighteen months old. In cyder-counties this way is very economical; and even if not thought strong - it

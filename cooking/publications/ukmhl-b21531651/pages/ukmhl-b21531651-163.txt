PUDDINGS. 139 fifteen eggs well beaten, and as much fresh candied orange as will add colour and flavour to it, being first beaten to a fine paste. Line the dish with paste for turning out: and when filled with the above, lay a crust over, as you would a pie, and bake in a slow oven. It is as good cold as hot. Baked Apple puddings.

Soak four ounces of rice in warm water half an hour; drain the latter from it, and throw it into a stew-pan, with half a pint of milk, half a stick of cinnamon, and simmer till tender. When cold, add four whole eggs well beaten, two ounces of butter melted in a tea-cup-

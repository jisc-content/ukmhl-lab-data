99 DINNER DISHES. Minced Beep. 279. Put iuto a stew-pan a little butter with an onion chopped fine; add a little gravy and one tablespoonful of strong ale; season with pepper and salt, and stir these in- gredients over the fire until the onion is a rich brown. Cut, but do not chop, some cold beef very fine, add it to the gravy, stir till quite hot and serve; garnish with sippets of well- toasted bread. Be careful in not allowing the gravy to boil after the meat is added, as it would render it hard and tough. To Roast Venison. 280. Take great care the meat is well-hung. Take the skin from the top part, put butter and salt over the fat, then make a paste of flour and water, lay it on, and fasten it by four or five sheets of paper, sewn together and skewered on firmly. Roast it gently and baste it. About half an hour before it is done take off the paper and paste, and let it colour gradually to a pale brown, but be most careful it does not burn. Serve with a good gravy round, and with warmed red currant jelly. A little wine can be added to the gravy. Hashed Venison. 281. Take a pint of very good brown gravy, mix with it some of the sauce Tartare. Cut the venison in small, thin slices of ecpial size, put them into a saucepan, cover with the sauce, and let it stand from fifteen to twenty minutes; put the pan on the fire, let it get gradually warm till it gets hot quite through. It must on no account boil, but it must be very hot when sent to table. Norman Hash. 282. Take two ounces of butter, warm it, add half an onion, a sprig of herbs, and a good pint of stock ; boil well and strain; slice mutton very thin and free from skin ; put the meat into the sauce, stew very gently for three-quarters of an hour, take out the herbs. Add half a glass of sherry before serving. 7â€”2

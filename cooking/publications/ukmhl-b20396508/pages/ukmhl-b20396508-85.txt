225.] GRAVY. 81 GRAVY. When meat is roasted, it exudes a thick brown essence known as osmazone; this in most houses is allowed to remain in the vessel or tin dish in which the meat or game has been cooked, and is then thrown away as of no use. The proper way to make gravy is to skim off the fat the meat has been basted with, and then pour either stock or boiling water on the osmazone, adding a little salt, and stirring until it is all dis- solved off the vessel or basting dish ; by this means a strong meat-flavoured gravy is obtained that has the characteristics of the meat cooked. Those who prefer a flavoured gravy can add Worcester sauce or port wine, according to taste. All fat should be carefully skimmed off before it is sent in a tureen to table, where this process is not carried out, a little Liebig's extract dissolved in boiling water is a substitute; but this has not the flavour of the particular dish cooked, and is not to be com- pared to the other process. Good gravy means good cooking, a rare thing in most households. DINNER, DISHES. Ox-tail, Stewed. 225. Take a fine ox-tail, disjoint it, cut it into pieces about one inch and a half long, and divide the thick parts into quarters. Throw these pieces into boiling water, and let them remain for a quarter of an hour. Take them up, wipe them with a soft cloth, and put them into a stewpan with two quarts of stock or water, a large onion stuck with three cloves, three carrots, a bunch of savoury herbs, and a little salt and pepper. Simmer gently until the meat parts easily from the bones, then put the pieces on a hot dish, reduce the gravy, strain it over them and garnish with toasted sippets. A little lemon- juice is by some persons considered an improvement. Time, three hours and a half to stew the tail. G

FOODS FOR THE FAT. Mutton Cutlets with Tomato Puree. 131. Trim cutlets from well-hung mutton, beat them into shape after removing the chinebone, dip them into dissolved butter, brush them with egg, and sprinkle with breadcrumbs. Fry in boiling fat, and turn them frequently during the frying. Put them on blotting-paper before the fire to drain. Have ready a puree of fresh tomatoes made as follows : Pick a pound of ripe tomatoes, break them open, and put them without their seeds into a stewpan, with an onion or a couple of shallots, sweet herbs and spice, if liked, salt and pepper; stir over a slow fire till the tomatoes can be pulped through a hair-sieve ; return the pulp to the stewpan to simmer, add an ounce of butter well worked together in a little flour, and stir in two ounces of meat-glaze. Arrange the cutlets in a circle a little overlapping each other, and fill the centre with the pur6e. Mutton Kidneys, Stewed (a la francaise). 132. Eemove the skins from half a dozen or less fine mutton kidneys and cut them lengthwise into slices a quarter of an inch in thickness. Season each piece rather highly with salt and cayenne, and dip it into some finely powdered sweet herbs, namely, parsley and thymeâ€”two-thirds of the former and one of the latter. Three or four finely minced shallots may be added if liked. Melt a good-sized piece of butter in the frying-pan and put in the kidneys. Let them brown on both sides. When nearly cooked, dredge a little flour quickly over them, add a quarter of a pint of boiling stock or water, a tablespoonful of mushroom ketchup and the strained juice of half a lemon. When the gravy is just upon the point of boiling, lift out the kidneys, put them on a hot dish, and two tablespoonfuls of claret to the same, let it boil for one minute, then pour it over the meat. Garnish with fried sippets. Time, six minutes to fry the kidneys.

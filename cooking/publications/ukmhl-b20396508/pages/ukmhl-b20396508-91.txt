246.] DINNER DISHES. 87 frying-pan with some clear dripping, a quarter of an inch in depth; place the pan on the fire, and, when the dripping ceases hissing, put in the liver, and in five minutes turn it. When done enough, dish it and serve very hot. Time, a quarter of an hour. Perdrix au Vin. 244. Roast two partridges ; put into a stewpan three table- spoonfuls of rich gravy, a glass of claret, salt, pepper, the juice of a lemon, and a little cayenne. Cut up the birds, keeping them very hot. Make the sauce very hot over the fire, and pour over the partridges. Pheasant, Boiled. 245. Pick, draw, and singe the pheasant, and truss it firmly, as if for roasting; cover wkh buttered paper, wrap it in a floured cloth, plunge it into boiling water, and after it has once boiled up draw it to the side, and let it simmer as gently as possible until it is done enough. The more gently it is simmered the better it will look, and the tenderer it will be. Put it on a hot dish, pour a small quantity of sauce over it, and send the rest to table in a tureen. Time to boil, half an hour from the time of boiling for a small young bird ; three- quarters of an hour for a larger one ; one hour or more for an old one. Pheasant, Broiled. 246. Pick, draw and singe the pheasant, and divide it neatly into joints; fry these in a little fat until they are equally and lightly browned all over, drain them well, season with salt and cayenne, and dip them into egg and bread- crumbs. Broil over a clear fire and serve on a hot dish, with mushroom sauce or piquante sauce as an accompaniment. The remains of a cold roast pheasant may be treated in this way. Time to broil, about ten minutes.

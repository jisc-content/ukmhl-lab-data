FOODS FOR THE FAT. 8a [226- OX-TAIL STEWED WITH SPINACH. 226. Stew the ox-tail according to the directions given in the last recipe.

Fry till it is of a light brown colour, which will be in about ten minutes. Beefsteak, Fried. 228. If no gridiron is at hand, put some butter or dripping in a frying-pan and let it boil; then lay in a steak of half an inch thick, and move it continually with the side of a knife or steak-tongs to prevent it from burning. When sufficiently well done on one side, which will be seen by the colour being well spread over the meat, turn it on the other, continuing to move it about with the tongs in a similar manner. If a fork must be used, do not stick it into the juicy part of the meat, but into the fat or edge.

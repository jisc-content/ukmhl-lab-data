Moleschott gives 23 oz. of dry food as about the average a healthy man during ordinary work ought to eat; this would be equal to nearly twice the amount of moist food. Assuming that this large amount of food were deprived of the great fat producers—sugar and starch—it is not too much to say that, with a fair amount of work, there would be no great fear of a person becoming obese on it.

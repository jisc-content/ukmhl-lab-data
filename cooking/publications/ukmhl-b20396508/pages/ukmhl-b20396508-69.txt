SOUPS. 65 176.] Ox-Tail Soup, Clear. > 175. Cut a fine, fresh ox-tail into pieces about an inch long, and divide the thick part into four. Wash these pieces, and throw thern into boiling water for a quarter of an hour, then drain and wipe them with a soft cloth. Put them into a stewpan with two carrots, an onion stuck with three cloves, a sprig of parsley, a small piece of thyme, two or three sticks of celery, half a blade of mace, a teaspoonful of salt, six or eight peppercorns, and a quart of water or clear stock. Boil, re- move the scum carefully as it rises, then draw the saucepan to the side of the fire, and simmer very gently until the meat is tender. Lift out the pieces of ox-tail, and strain the soup. Pheasant Soup. 176. Flour a well-hung pheasant rather thickly, put it down to a brisk fire, and roast it for a quarter of an hour, basting it plentifully all the time. Take it from the fire and let it get nearly cold, then take off the flesh from the breast and the upper part of the wings, skin it and put it aside. Cut up the rest of the bird, and bruise the bones. Scrape a small carrot finely, put it into a stewpan with an ounce of butter, an ounce of the leau of an unboiled ham finely minced, a small sprig of thyme, a bay-leaf, a handful of parsley, half a blade of mace, three or four cloves, half a dozen peppercorns, a shallot, and three or four of the outer sticks of a head of celery. Stir these ingredients over a gentle fire until they are brightly browned, put in the flesh and the bruised body of the bird, pour over them a quart of veal or beef stock, and after boiling stew gently for half an hour, and be careful to remove the scum as it rises. Strain the soup, and rub the meat through a sieve. Mix the puree with the soup, add to it a small pinch of cayenne, a little salt, a glassful of chablis, and the fillets of the pheasant cut into thick slices. Stir over the fire until it is quite hot, and serve. Time, an hour and a half or more.

75 FISH. Lobster a la Creme. 204. Pick the meat from a large freshly-boiled cock lobster, mince it finely, and put it into a saucepan with half a tea- spoonful of salt, a teaspoonful of white pepper, the eighth of a nutmeg grated, two teaspoonfuls of vinegar, and one of light wine. When quite hot, put with it a little fresh butter lightly rolled in flour, and a quarter of a pint of thick cream. Simmer gently for ten minutes, stirring all the time, and when thoroughly heated put the mixture into the shell of the lobster, place it on a neatly folded napkin, and garnish with parsley. Whiting, Fried. 205. These fish are generally cleaned and skinned at the shop ; if not, they must be done by the cook. The tails should be fastened into the mouth ; brush them over well with egg, beaten up, and fry a nice brown in boiling lard ; drain and dry well. Ihey will take from seven to ten minutes to fry. Whiting au G-ratin. 206. Take two full-sized whitings ; empty, scrape, cleanse, and wipe them, then make deep incisions on each side with a sharp knife, to the depth of a quarter of an inch; butter a shallow dish thickly, sprinkle upon it a little pepper and salt, pour gently over them one or two glassfuls of French light wine, and lay upon the fish two tablespooufuls of finely- minced mushrooms, mixed with a tablespoonful of parsley ; melt an ounce of butter, pour it over the fish, sprinkle two tablespoonfuls of bread-raspings on the top, and bake the whitings in the oven. Send a cut lemon only to table with the fish. If it is preferred that the wine should not be used, three or four tablespoonfuls of pale veal gravy may be sub- stituted for it.

355-] FRUITS, JELLIES, AND CREAMS. 121 add a little saccharin and essence of vanilla to taste ; stir over the fire in a small saucepan till it thickens, hut keep it just off the boil. A teaspoonful of brandy or rum improves it, but it must not be added when very hot. This is nice to eat with stewed fruit. Nourishing Cream. 353. Beat the yolks of two eggs j add a little saccharin, the rind, lightly grated, and strained juice of half a lemon or orange. Beat the whites to a stiff froth, adding to them, while beating, a little saccharin. Put the jar containing the yolks in a pot of boiling water ; cook gently, stirring all the time ; when it begins to thicken, stir in the whites of the eggs until well mixed ; remove it from the fire, and let it cool. Serve in custard-glasses. Rhubarb Mould. 354. One quart of red rhubarb cut in pieces, put into a saucepan with a lid; let it boil till it is a pulp. Soak half an ounce of gelatine in cold water, pour on to it just enough boil- ing water to dissolve it, add it to the rhubarb with sixteen grains of saccharin ; let it boil fifteen minutes; add a few drops of essence of lemon, butter a mould, and pour in the rhubarb. Next day dip the mould in hot water, and turn the rhubarb out on a glass dish. Apple Snow. 355. Reduce half-a-dozen apples to a pulp, press them through a sieve, sweeten with saccharin, and flavour them. Take the whites of six eggs, whisk them for some minutes with a little saccharin. Beat the pulp to a froth, then mix the two together, and whisk them until they look like stiff snow. Pile high in rough pieces on a glass dish, stick a sprig of myrtle in the middle, and garnish with small pieces of bright-coloured jelly.

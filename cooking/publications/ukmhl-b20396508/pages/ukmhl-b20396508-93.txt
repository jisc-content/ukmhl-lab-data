89 DINNER DISHES. 251.] Pheasant, Eoast. 248. Pluck, draw and singe a brace of pheasants. Wipe them with a dry cloth, truss them firmly, and either lard or tie round the breasts a piece of fat bacon. Flour them well, put them before a clear fire, and baste liberally. When they are done enough remove the bacon, serve the birds on a hot dish, and garnish with watercress. Send good brown gravy to table with them. If the fashion is liked, half a dozen of the best of the tail feathers may be stuck into the bird when it is dished. Time, three-quarters of an hour to roast a good-sized pheasant. The drumsticks are generally excellent when devilled. Peafowl, Larded and Roasted. 249. Choose a young bird, lard it closely over the breast and legs, fill it with a good veal forcemeat—but the forcemeat may be omitted—truss it firmly, and roast before a clear fire for an hour or an hour and a half, according to the size of the bird. When done enough, take off the buttered paper which was round the head, trim the feathers, glaze the larding, and serve the bird on a hot dish with a clear brown gravy under it. Garnish the dish with watercress. Partridges, Broiled. 250. Prepare the partridges as if for roasting, cut off their heads, split them entirely up the back, and flatten the breast- bones a little. Wipe them thoroughly inside and out with a damp cloth, season with salt and cayenne, and broil over a gentle fire. As soon as they are done enough rub them quickly over with butter, and send them to table on a hot dish, with brown gravy or mushroom sauce in a tureen. Time, fifteen minutes to broil the partridges. Partridges, Salmi of. 251. Prepare three partridges, lard the breasts well, and roast them, but leave them rather underdone. Leave till

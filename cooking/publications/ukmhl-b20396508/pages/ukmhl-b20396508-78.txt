Take off the large claws, and crack the shell lightly, without disfiguring the fish; split open the tail with a sharp knife, and dish the fish on a folded napkin, with the head in an upright position in the centre, and the tail and claws arranged neatly round it; garnish with parsley, salt, cayenne, mustard. Salad-oil and vinegar should be eaten with it. Lobster dressed with Sauce Piquante. 202. Pick the meat from the body and claws of a freshly- boiled cock lobster, and divide it into neat pieces about half an inch square. Take the yolks of three hard-boiled eggs, pound them well, and mix with them a teaspoonful of raw mustard, half a teaspoonful of salt, and half a grain of cayenne; add very gradually by drops at first, beating well between every addition, one tablespoonful of salad-oil, and afterwards two tablespoonfuls of tarragon vinegar and a dessertspoonful of very hot chilli vinegar; pour it just before serving over the lobster, and garnish with parsley. Lobster Salad. 203. In making lobster salad be careful that the lobster is sweet and fresh, and that the lettuces are crisp and dry. Unless the latter are perfectly free from moisture, the sauce, instead of blending properly, will be liable to float in oily particles on the top. Take the meat of one or two large lobsters, divide it into neat pieces, and season each piece slightly with pepper, salt and vinegar; place a bed of shred lettuce-hearts at the bottom of the dish, put a layer of lobster on top of it, mixed, if liked, with a few slices of cucumber, cover again with lettuce, and repeat until the materials are exhausted. Decorate the borders with any garnish that may suit the taste.

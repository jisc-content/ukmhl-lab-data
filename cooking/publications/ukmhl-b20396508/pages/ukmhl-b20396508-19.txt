FOOD REQUIRED, AMOUNT OF. 15 which it is not safe to go, and under no circumstances should the loss of weight exceed one pound per week. If this should be so, the diet is not properly adjusted with regard to its con- stituents, but is simply slow starvation, a result not aimed at in these pages, or desirable. 19. Let us proceed to consider the amount of mixed food necessary to sustain life, health, and strength under different circumstances. This can be calculated to a nicety, but the amount taken must have some relation to the amount of muscular work that the individual is called upon to exercise, the season, and a few other surroundings.* 20. It will be asked, What is the ordinary amount of mixed food an ordinary-sized person should take? An average healthy male adult of medium weight and height, and per- forming a moderate amount of work, requires 4| oz. of nitrogenous food,f 3 oz. of fats (hydro-carbons), 14J oz. of carbo-hydrates, J 1 oz. of salts. This diet is ecpiivalent to a little over 46 oz. of moist solid food. 21. The above ingredients would be contained in f of a lb. of meat and a little less than 2 lb. of bread, or in 17 hens' eggs of ordinary size, supposing eggs only were eaten, which it is needless to say would be impossible. * Prison diet where hardjlabour is done consists of 184 oz. of solid dry food per week. This 1S4 oz. is made up of meat, bread, cocoa, oatmeal, milk, treacle, barley-meal, salt, cheese, flour, suet, carrots, onions, potatoes This would mean about 52 oz. of moist food per day ; for of course the water is not reckoned when the amount of food is chemically considered. Banting's dietary is about 10 oz. a day of dry food, which is bare subsis- tence diet, buc it4contains a large proportion of muscle-forming ingredients too large for continued safety. + This embraces meat of all sortsâ€”eggs, milk, and certain constituents of vegetables. X Carbo-hydrates mean bread, sugar, and all vegetables containing starch and sugar.

FOODS FOR THE FAT. 92 [257- Mutton, Roebuck Fashion. 257. Take a loin of mutton that has been well hung. Remove the fillet, skin, and cut away the fat and bones. Lay the loin in a marinade composed of equal parts of vinegar and water, to a pint of which add a glass of port or claret, a couple of carrots, and two large onions cut into quarters with a clove in each, a dozen peppercorns, two blades of mace, a bunch of herbs and parsley, some bay-leaves, and two tea- spoonfuls of salt. When the mutton has lain in the marinade twenty-four hours turn it, and let it lie until next day ; then drain, and put it into a braising-pan with a little of the pickle, the pan being well lined with bacon. Stew it three hours. Glaze the meat and serve with gravy, adding walnut ketchup and a glass of claret. Indian Fagadtj. 258. Pick the meat from a lobster and a pint of shrimps, cut it into small bits, and season it with an onion and a clove of garlic shred finely, and some cayenne and salt. Prepare some spinach as for boiling, put it into a stewpan in the usual way without water, add the lobster, and stew gently with an onion or two sliced and previously fried in butter, keeping the lid closed for some time. When nearly done, stir the contents over the fire to absorb the moisture, and when quite dry squeeze in some lemon-juice. Curried Sweetbreads. 259. Wash and soak one or two sweetbreads, put tbem into some boiling water with a little salt, an onion, and a bit of parsley; let them simmer for ten minutes (any pale broth is better than water); take them out, leave them to drain and get quite cold, then cut them into slices, about half an inch thick, and fry lightly. Have some good curry, put the slices into this, and stew gently for twenty minutes; cocoanut-milk

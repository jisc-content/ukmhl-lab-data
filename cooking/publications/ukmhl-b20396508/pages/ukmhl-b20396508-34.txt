30 FOODS FOR THE FAT. [8o. exercise desirable, says the average daily work of a man engaged in manual labour in the open air is equivalent to lifting 250 to 350 tons one foot high. This is a moderate amount, 400 tons being a heavy clay's work. The amount of muscular work involved in this may be easily known by remembering that a walk of 20 miles on the'level road is equivalent to about 353 tons lifted one foot; and that a walk of 10 miles is equivalent to lifting 247 tons one foot high.* 80. < We may estimate that every healthy man ought to take an amount of exercise represented by 150 tons raised one foot, which is equal to the work done by walking 8J to 9 miles on a level road. A certain amount of this exercise is taken in performing one's daily work ; but apart from this, outdoor exercise should be taken daily equivalent in amount to a walk of 5 or 6 miles. Less than this is not compatible with robust health.' 81. Exercise should be systematic and regular, not taken by fits and starts, and in corpulent people should be increased gradually. The under-clothing should be of flannel, and chill should be guarded against. Lawn-tennis in summer supplies the best form of exercise. Walking uphill strengthens the heart, and the distance and speed should be increased as palpitation subsides. 82.

The more muscles that can be brought into play the better. 83. Exercise should not be taken immediately after food, nor should the individual who is anxious to reduce corpulency gratify the desire for a nap. It is well to. have recourse to some light mental or bodily employment, such as billiards, chess, etc., to obviate its occurrence; 'but,' as Dr. Pavy remarks, ' with a natural state of things, there ought to be * Newsholme.

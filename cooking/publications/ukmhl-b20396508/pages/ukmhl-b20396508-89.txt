85 239-] DINNER DISFIES. Boiled Fowls. 236 Take one quart of boiling water and one quart of cold water; clean and truss your fowl carefully. The legs should be drawn, cutting the skin at the first joint, and then put under the skin into the bodies, while the wings should be cut off short and twisted back; no livers or gizzards should be trussed with boiled fowl. Put them into water, mixed as above, that will be about right heat, but it must entirely cover them j skim well when it comes to the boil, then simmer. For a fowl, an hour; for chickens, about half the time. Broiled Chicken. 237. This should first be boiled for about ten minutes ; then allow it to become cold, and split into two, wash over with beaten egg, cover with breadcrumbs, and broil it over a clear fire; it will take half an hour, or if a large chicken, longer. Serve very hot. The legs should be trussed like those of a boiled fowl, and should be made as flat as possible. The inside should be put first on the grid. Pigeons. 238. These are good roasted or stewed j if roasted, they should be used fresh and well basted, the heads and necks cut off, and trussed like a duck â€¢ pour plenty of water through them before trussing, and wipe dry. Put into the inside of each a little butter and a bit of cayenne. They will take almost twenty-five minutes, but if very young not so long. Stewed Pigeons and Mushrooms. 239. Put into a saucepan one ounce of fresh butter, cut up two pigeons into small pieces, let it stew a little, but not brown ; add one pint of good gravy, one tablespoonful of mushroom ketchup, salt, pepper and cayenne : stir well until it just boils,

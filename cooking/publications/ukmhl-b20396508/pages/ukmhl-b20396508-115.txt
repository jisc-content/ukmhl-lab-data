111 VEGETABLES. French mustard is the best for this. Simmer till hot, and serve. Fried Cabbage. 317. Boil the cabbage in two waters and skim well, drain very well, chop or slice it, fry in butter or good dripping, with pepper and salt. Serve on a hot dish with a few slices of fried beef or ham over it. Spinach with Cream. 318. Boil and drain two pounds of spinach in the usual way. Press it between two plates to free it thoroughly from moisture, and heat it in a clean saucepan with a little pepper and salt and a small lump of butter. When it is dry, add very gradually two tablespoonfuls of boiling cream, and simmer it gently for five minutes. Serve very hot. Spinach with Gravy. 319. Prepare the spinach in the usual way as in the fore- going recipe. Dissolve two ounces of fresh butter in a sauce- pan, put in the spinach and stir it till the butter has dried away. Add a teaspoonful of salt, a very little saccharin and as much grated nutmeg as will cover a sixpence. Stir it again, and moisten with two tablespoonfuls of highly-seasoned veal broth and a teaspoonful of chilli vinegar. Stir it over the fire till the liquid is absorbed, and serve very hot. Cabbage, Creamed. 320. Thoroughly cleanse two young cabbages and boil them until quite soft. Take them out, drain and press them between two hot plates until they are dry, when they may be slightly chopped. Melt a piece of butter the size of an egg in a stewpan, add pepper and salt, then put in the cabbage and turn it about for two or three minutes. When it is thoroughly heated, mix with it very gradually a cupful of cream.

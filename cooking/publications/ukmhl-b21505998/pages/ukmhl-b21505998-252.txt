236 Dainty Meals for Small Households sprinkled with pounded dry biscuit, another layer of oysters, more pounded biscuit, a little butter. Season with pepper and salt. Cook from five to ten minutes, covered. Another way.—Drain the juice from a dozen oysters thoroughly, butter the chafing dish, and when very hot place the oysters in single layers. When browned on one side turn them and keep on adding a little butter. This, with the juice of the oysters, forms a skin in the chafing dish ; season with pepper and salt, and when browned serve very hot. Clams a la Newburg.—One pint of clams, two table- spoonfuls of butter, one gill sherry, half a pint of cream, yolks of two eggs, one small teaspoonful of salt, a little cayenne pepper. Trim off the tough part, being careful not to cut into the soft portion. Melt the butter over boiling water, stirring constantly ; when creamy, put in the sherry. Beat together the yolks of the eggs and the cream, and add gradually, stirring all the time. As soon as it is all mixed, turn in the clams, and cook until plump. This recipe will do for cockles and mussels. Shrimps.—Half a pint of shrimps (fresh or canned), one tablespoonful of tomato sauce, two tablespoonfuls of butter, half an onion (grated), half a teacupful of boiled rice, one gill of cream. Put the butter into the chafing dish ; when hot stir in the onion and rice, add the cream, shrimp and tomato sauce ; stir until it boils, then let it simmer for five minutes.

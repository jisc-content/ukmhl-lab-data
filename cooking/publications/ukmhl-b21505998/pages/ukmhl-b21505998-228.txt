212 Dainty Meals for Small Households A useful paste for open tarts is made thus : Work together fib. of fresh butter with fib. of flour (or in larger proportions), a small lump of lard about the size of half an egg, and salt to taste ; mix the ingredients very thoroughly with the palm of the hand, fold the paste over two or three times, roll it out, stand it aside for about half an hour, then use it as required. Or, again, take three tablespoonfuls of fresh lard, ilb. of dried flour, and salt to taste ; work well together, moistening with enough water to bring it to the proper consistency ; roll it out as above, and let it stand for a quarter of an hour.

Veal 147 to cook a second time it would become tough, and also lose its goodness. Referring to the Continental veal cutlet or chop, which is rarely served (as such) in this country, except in the joint known as the loin, I may suggest that for an entree, or for a luncheon dish, two or three chops could often be spared from the loin. To prepare this dainty dish, trim the chop carefully, i.e. remove all the meat from the bone, except the “ nut ” or real cutlet; put the trimmings aside for stock or other purposes, beat and lard the chops and put them into a pan containing hot fat, a small carrot, a cloved onion, a" pinch of grated nutmeg ; after ten minutes add a couple of tablespoonfuls of good gravy (with one of cream or sour milk, if handy). When the chops are tender dish them up with paper frills, keep them in a hot place, strain the gravy and put it over the fire again, stirring in another tablespoonful of cream. When nearly boiling pour over the chops and serve. For warmed-up dishes any cold remains can be used ; most of them can be very satisfactorily served up, accord- ing to the recipes given in Messrs. Cosenza & Com- pany’s pamphlet sent to all purchasers of the wonderful Driessauces ; these it is useless to reprint here. Suffice it to say that several varieties can be produced at a few moments’ notice, and that the results obtained are nothing less than delicious. If the above are not available, put some fat in a stew- pan, stir in a tablespoonful of flour, keeping the pan over a brisk fire ; add a tumblerful of stock, a tablespoonful of wine, and one of gravy. Into this put a carrot and cloved onion. Cover, and let simmer; after twenty minutes strain ; put the liquor over the fire again with the sliced cold meat, and an onion previously sliced and browned in fat; add the yolk of an egg three minutes

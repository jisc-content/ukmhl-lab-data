156 Dainty Meals for Small Households salt smoked meat) should not be put straight into a tub with the water, but should rest on a frame fixed a few inches from the bottom of the vessel; the advantage of this lies in the fact that the salt moisture that proceeds from the meat sinks to the bottom, whilst the meat remains absolutely free, and does not come into contact with it again. It is practically useless to adopt the almost universal plan adopted by those who have not had much experience in home-curing, as the ham simply lies till saturated with the very substance of which one is trying to rid it. The soaking should not last more than forty-eight hours, which is the time allowed for extreme cases, and the water should be changed three times a day. An excellent way of treating a “ new season’s ” ham is as follows :—Trim it well, pare off any stale or black-looking edges, chop off the end of the bone to improve the shape, and with a piece of string tie the end of the ham near the bone very tightly to prevent it from “gaping,” as it is apt to do after boiling. Put into the pan enough water for the ham to be completely immersed, let it boil, put in the ham, and as soon as the water needs skimming add two or three pints of old white wine, one large onion studded with cloves, some carrots, a bouquet of parsley, two bay-leaves, and a few sprigs of thyme. Let all this simmer for about five hours or less, according to the size of the ham ; by pricking it with a fork it is easy to tell whether it is sufficiently tender. So much for the ordinary boiling ; in warm weather, and especially if the ham is to be eaten slowly, and to last over some days, it should at once be taken out of its liquor and allowed to cool ; free from all moisture ; if the tempera- ture is low and the ham is likely to be consumed quickly (for instance, at a large supper party), it is well to put it into a pan with the liquor, and to let it become cold

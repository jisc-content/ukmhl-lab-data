2 7 Stocks water, put on the Ud and stand it over the fire to boil. After it has boiled there may be scum on the surface, which should be removed, but this is more likely to occur where much larger quantities are concerned. The pan may then be drawn aside so that the contents may simmer for at least two hours. (This for a small supply made from scraps.) Remember that a good pot-au-feu is not determined by the quantity of meat that is used; the secret of success lies in the method employed. For regular supply stock proceed thus :â€”Take about i| lb. of beef (any part of the leg, shin, rump, or shoulder) and a few bones (id. or 2d. worth will suffice), crush the bones with a hammer, beat the meat well, and put it into the pot with cold water and a little salt. Stand it over a moderate fire. The bones are generally put in first, and the quantity of water for the above amount of meat can be varied to suit requirements ; but a good proportion is about a gallon and a half. The object must now be to carry on the simmering so that the contents will be cooked to the best advantage, and in order to ensure this the fire must be kept up in an even and moderate way, care being taken, when it has to be replenished, not to occasion any noticeable difference in the heat, as additional fierceness would be detrimental to the quality of the stock ; this is easily explained by the simple fact that if the boiling is increased in such a measure as to necessitate the frequent addition of much water, the even, slow process will be impeded and the result inevitably spoilt. On the other hand, the formation of scum should not be too rapid, or the meat will harden, and, to carry out the foreign plan, this should be brought into requisi- tion and be served up in some way or other, after it has been removed from the pot. It therefore follows, from these apparently lengthy but very essential injunctions, that steady, even simmering must he the aim of the

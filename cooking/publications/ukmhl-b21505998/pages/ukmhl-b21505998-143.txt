Beef 127 has cooked, remove the fat, and pour it over the meat, or send it in in a sauce-boat. a l’Etuvee (Stewed) [releve].—Choose an evenly cut piece of the rump, beat it well after hanging as before, tie round it two or three slices of bacon with a bay-leaf and a few sprigs of chevril. Put this into a braising pan or other convenient utensil, the lid of which will hold a good layer of very hot charcoal embers, and add about a pint and a half of white cooking wine, a pint of stock, a piece of bacon rind, a pinch of mace, any small remains of cold veal or fowl, plenty of seasoning, and an onion.

When fillet is ordered, the English butchers send a piece of meat that would greatly astonish a French cook ; but if the fat is cut off, and the untidy pieces well cut and trimmed, the fillet will remain in its original oblong shape. Put the meat in the oven in a long fireproof baking dish, and when the outside is moderately brown, remove the bacon. Add to the gravy, which will already have formed, half a

Entries 123 omelet to the edge of the pan to turn it, and quickly reverse it on to the hot dish in which it should at once be sent to table. The great mistake generally made in the manufacture of omelets is that the operator is apt to forget that the eggs really go on setting after they have left the pan, and should therefore be put into the dish whilst they are still almost liquid in the middle of the omelet. This omelet can be varied ad infinitum with the addition of fines herbes, chopped bacon, mushrooms, kidney, sardines, anchovies, &c. Omelette Fame (Stuffed Omelet).—Mix a little flour with the eggs and seasoning, as this should be more like a pancake than an omelet pure and simple. Have ready, thoroughly minced, the cold remains of any fish, fowl, or meat, together with finely-chopped herbs and onions, rather hot seasoning, moistened with the yolk of an egg, and, if necessary, a spoonful or so of stock ; fry the eggs, &c., in a small pan, spread the mixture over it, fold it and dish it up, or, if more than one is required, send them in one by one as soon as they are ready, as they should be eaten very hot. (Eufs en Cocottes (Pattikin Eggs).—Butter some French earthenware pattikins, sprinkle with a little salt and pepper, break two fresh eggs into each one, place a small piece of butter on the top with another pinch of seasoning (and breadcrumbs if desired), and heat in the oven till well set.

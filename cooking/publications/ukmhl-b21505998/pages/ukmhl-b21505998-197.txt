Vegetables 181 day, it is a good plan to give the greens their first boil in the same vessel; it greatly improves their flavour. Chou Rouge (Red Cabbage) belongs essentially to mid- winter fare, and is perhaps too full flavoured to appeal to everybody; it is good, nevertheless, and especially so as an accompaniment to partridges. Choose a firm cabbage, remove the thick end and the outside leaves, hold it firmly on a board, and slice it very fine with a large sharp knife. Put into a suitable saucepan some stock, a little butter, salt and pepper to taste, and the cabbage. Cover, and let the contents simmer and boil rather slowly till they are tender and the liquor much reduced. A few minutes before turning the cabbage out add a little red wine, and a pinch of grated nutmeg. When the wine has been absorbed, serve with game. Or, slice the cabbage as before, scald it with absolutely boiling water for about ten minutes, and let it drain. Melt in a saucepan over the fire some bacon cut in dice, with a small piece of butter, put in the cabbage, cover, and after a few minutes stir in the cabbage. Let this simmer for a while, and moisten with white wine and some good meat gravy. After this the simmering must be very slow to allow the vegetable to become tender without having to add more than a few drops of either of the latter ingredients. Season and serve. Leeks are very useful, except in the months of March and April, when they are rather bitter and unpleasant to the taste ; prepared according to the following recipes they will be found excellent eating.

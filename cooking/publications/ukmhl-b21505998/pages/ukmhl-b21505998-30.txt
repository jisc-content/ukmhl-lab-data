Copper pans are very expensive, and present much difficulty owing to the ultra-conscientious cleaning required to keep them in a really wholesome condition; as an alternative, we are left a choice of utensils which can be roughly divided into steel goods, enamelled ware, American granite, aluminium, &c. When left to themselves to settle this point, people are apt to fall into the error of purchasing one particular substance to the utter exclusion of the others ; yet it is obvious that what is needful for the success of a delicate sauce, for instance, is not necessarily the kind of metal which would produce a tasty stew, or a substantial and delicious braise. It is here again that theory comes to the aid of practice. The first desideratum is the stock pot, which may be either of tinned iron or of steelâ€”a large saucepan answers the purpose required, though the accepted article is of deep cylindrical shape with short handles on either side.

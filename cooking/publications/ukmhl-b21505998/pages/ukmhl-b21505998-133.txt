Cotelettes, sauce fines herbes.—Trim some small neck or loin cutlets ; fry them in hot fat in a large pan, when nearly done sprinkle them with parsley, chives, shallots (sorrel in summer), all finely chopped and seasoned with salt, pepper, mace, all pounded together in a mortar rubbed with garlic. Turn them over and repeat the sprinkling. Take the cutlets out, stand them on a hot dish and keep them in a warm place. Add to the contents of the pan a dessertspoonful of vinegar, some stock, and a little cream. Bring to the boil, thicken with a sprinkling of corn flour, and pour this sauce over the cutlets. The same kind of dish can be varied by the addition of sliced onions, chopped mushrooms, and wine instead of vinegar. Sheep’s kidneys make good entrees and delicious breakfast dishes, but although they do not present any difficulty of treatment, they are rarely daintily served in the average household. First of all, they must be used as fresh as possible, and after being skinned, rubbed all over with a mixture of salt and pepper mixed together on a plate or board previously slightly rubbed with garlic. Split through the middle, but not cut in two, laying the blade against the curved part of the kidney, the roughest part of white gristle should be removed, and the inside rubbed with the same mixture as the outside. Run a skewer through the open kidney, dip it in oil, and grill it briskly on both sides. To vary this dish, cut the kidneys in slices, after preparing them as above, and put them on a skewer with a slice of bacon between every two slices of kidney. Or, to improve this still further, allow the top of a moderate- sized mushroom to every slice of bacon.

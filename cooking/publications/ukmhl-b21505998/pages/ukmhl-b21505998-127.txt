hi Entries heading, though the enumeration will not be anything like complete; in the chapters dealing with beef, mutton, &c., some dishes will naturally occur which may answer to the term entree. Beef Kidneys.—Rognons en Brochettes.—This is a good way to serve them when sheep’s kidneys are not avail- able :—Wash and cut the kidney into finger-thick slices; remove the gristle from the middle; dip them in oil; have ready some slices of bacon, place them together alternately, and skewer them well; grill them, or roast them in a Dutch oven in front of the fire; arrange them on a hot dish, with a sprinkling of parsley butter, and serve them with a sauce piquante or sauce tartare, or plainly arranged on squares of fried toast. Sautes.—Cut the kidney into small thin chips, putting aside all the hard gristle; this may with ad- vantage be prepared over-night for breakfast, or early in the morning for lunch. The meat should be cut with a very sharp knife, in the thinnest shreds. Put them into a basin with sliced onions, a bay-leaf, plenty of salt and pepper, and sprinkle with good salad oil; cut up some bacon into small dice. Put some butter into a saute pan, toss the kidneys and bacon in the same, sprinkle them with flour and finely chopped chervil and chives, add salt and pepper to taste, and a teacupful of stock. Put on the lid, and let the contents simmer till the liquor is somewhat reduced; after three-quarters of an hour put in a couple of tablespoonfuls of wine, and two or three minutes afterwards serve very hot, on fried toast. Cervelle de Bceuf.—This is not quite the same thing as the well-known calves’ brains, but it is excellent when well prepared. It should first be washed, then soaked in hot water for three or four hours; remove all the skin, then boil it in plain water with a little salt and vinegar.

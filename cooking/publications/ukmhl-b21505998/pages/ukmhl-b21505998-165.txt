149 Pork available for cooking purposes is situated between the skin and the fleshy parts ; it is of two distinct kinds, that nearest the skin, which gives us the well-known streaky bacon, being much harder than the deeper layer next the actual meat, which is melted into cooking lard. The fat that lies round the kidneys (the panne of French recipes) is used in the preparation of delicate stuffings, in the manufacture of certain kinds of sausages, and pro- duces a very fine quality of lard ; unfortunately this is not dealt with separately by the British pork butcher, though country people who kill their own pigs must greatly benefit by following this plan. Where half sides of bacon, hams, smoked sausages, &c., can be stored, a dry room, in which a wood fire can occasionally be made, is the best place for them. If this is impracticable, they should be hung from the ceiling in the kitchen or other available space which is fairly evenly heated ; to prevent the adherence of dust, &c., each flitch or separate article can be loosely tied in muslin. Hams sold as “ special cheap lots ” are generally unpleasantly salt, and must be treated accordingly. Streaky bacon which is thin (shallow in cut) is to be avoided for the same reason ; it is generally lower in price, and not to be recommended for frying, but it is useful for tying round fowls, pigeons, &c. Again, English people often wonder why the sancisses gril/ees they eat and enjoy on the Continent are so totally different from those at home ; and the answer is not far to seek. The use of breadcrumbs allowed in the British sausage naturally brings about their abuse, with the “ stodgy ” results only too well known. Breadcrumbs are an unknown quantity in foreign sausages, and it is to this immunity that is due the substance appreciated by all persons who have once been initiated into the mysteries of French charcuterie. Moreover, the sausages

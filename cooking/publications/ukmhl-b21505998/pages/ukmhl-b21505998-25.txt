9 Theoretical Fot-au-feu; some fresh braised meats, and desiccated vegetables (lentils, haricot beans), calves’ head and feet, and the shin of beef, some fish, the natural juices of which are not sufficiently important to require the concentrating process, are among the articles for which boiling is the most suitable mode of cooking. Roasting,—The second or concentrating process forms a kind of glaze or covering over the substance being cooked, thus imprisoning as it were all the best proper- ties of the meat or whatever it may be. This is the principle wherever roast, fried, saute-d and grilled articles are concerned. Hence it becomes obvious that a certain amount of discretion must be used in deciding upon the treatment of various substances, according to their relative properties. Ordinary roasting can be done in front of the fire or in the oven. In the former case very great care is required ; whether coal (or wood as in some continental households) be used; the secret of success lies in remembering that glowing embers cook, whereas flames only “ brown.” The heavier the joint the more embers will be needed. A dull fire is ruination to good meat. Indeed the difficulty of combining every good requisite for cooking a joint before the fire has been realized to such an extent that gas is more often resorted to, and failing that,—baking in the oven. Of gas and its convenience as a cooking agent, there is more to be said than could be compressed into the space at my disposal; but, where it can reasonably be had, i.e. where a cook can be trusted, or a lady often operates herself, it is the most easily governed heat, and that is saying a great deal especially for the preparation of certain dishes. For roasting in the oven the first heat must be considerable, so as to form the outside coating which retains the juices. After a preliminary heating, the temperature may be slightly reduced and

go Dainty Meals for Small Households place three or four grayling, well cleaned and washed ; or a larger fish cut in pieces. Pour over these a tumblerful of light French cooking wine, salt them, sprinkle them with a little melted butter, put them into the oven and bake for twelve or eighteen minutes. Serve in same dish. Add to the liquor in the pan some good gravy or meat glaze with a small piece of butter, kneaded with flour; finish off with the juice of half a lemon and some chopped parsley. Stir the sauce steadily over the fire whilst the afore-named ingredients are being put in. When thick pour it over the fish and serve, or send up in a boat. Or : Cut up one or two large fish, or use three or four small ones whole. Cover them with salt, and let them stand for a couple of hours. Meanwhile chop up some parsley, shallots, chervil, and tarragon ; add to this a tablespoonful of capers and the fillets of two or three sardines, the latter pounded with half a dozen pepper- corns. Put all this into a small saucepan, with some dripping or butter ; add the juice of a lemon, and when it is just on the boil put in the fish. They should simmer gently for two hours, with just the amount of heat that will produce the simmer without drying up the butter. There must be enough lemon juice to give the prepara- tion a decidedly acid taste. Make some butter very hot in the frying-pan, put the fish in and cook it for about ten minutes. With the mixture left in the saucepan make a sauce by adding a tumblerful of white wine, two tablespoonfuls of broth, and the juice of a lemon. Thicken with the yolks of two eggs, and pour over the fish. Trout, pike, salmon, whiting, and all sorts of firm- fleshed fish can be cooked as follows. Occasionally it is convenient to have a general recipe to fall back upon.

Veal 141 Narrow-minded culinary operators and housewives, and these, be it said without prejudice, are numerous, would doubtless be ready with the remark that “ plain cooking should be plain'’; that they do not hold with all the (to them) “ unnecessary fussing about ” with oil, garlic, or other preliminary treatment, and that “ a pinch of salt and pepper added in the usual way,” is good enough for them, &c. Such remarks, I feel bound to add, are merely the result of lack of experience, and do not at all agree with the precept that “ if a thing is worth doing at all, it is worth doing well.” Here, again, I am repeating what I have already urged ; repetition, however, is a fault common to those keenly interested in their own hobby ; in cookery it is never superfluous ; hence my importunity, which my readers must forgive. The flesh of the animal with which I am dealing is decidedly insipid per seyet with proper handling it be- comes the most succulent of all materials. This is an important fact to remember, especially where the ultimate object in making out a menu is to “ edit ” it in such a manner as to use up the article in question, not stingily, but as profitably as possible ; so that the advantage of taking pride in apparently trifling details may be found not only in the enjoyment of the joint, for instance, as it is served up for the first time, but on subsequent occa- sions. We all know the distress avowedly expressed or secretly felt at family meals, when a dish appears which suggests the brief but ominous thought, “ What! mutton again ? ” or beef, or veal, as the case may be, and it is to suggest means by which that tacit distrust in the housewife’s capabilities may be cured, that this little book has been written. Therefore I say again, be careful of details, and remember that the more succulent the first hot dish has proved, the more suitable will the cold remains be for further use and varied adaptation.

Sauces 57 One of the secrets of economical cookery, when it is to be linked with daintiness, lies in understanding such details. Although apparently trifling, they often help to produce the most delicious dishes at small cost. The three essential points, then, in the manufacture of the standard sauces are these : good butter, judicious seasoning, and proper thickening. A fourth desideratum consists in removing the fat very carefully. To do this, take the stewpan off the fire and pour in a few drops of cold water. This will send all the fat to the surface, so that it can easily be taken off with a spoon. Blotting- paper is also very effectual. Flour or potato fecula can be used indiscriminately. Some people prefer the latter, but in this case be very careful to take the pan off the fire promptly, otherwise the sauce will become thin.

When the contents begin to colour, add a sprinkling of flour, moisten with the suitable quantity of stock, put in a bouquet garni, and let the whole simmer over the fire for two or three hours ; skim, remove the fat, strain and put aside for use with other sauces.

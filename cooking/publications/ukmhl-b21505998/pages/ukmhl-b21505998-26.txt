If the joint is large, water or stock must be added, and at any rate it should be stood on a grating and not on the bottom of the baking tin. Gratin.—There are two sorts of gratins ; one made by using cold remains, and one from fresh material. The object of cooking according to this process is to obviate evaporation and to retain the flavour and juices of the substance under treatment. It is generally effected in the oven, and the surface of the dish can be glazed or not, as desired, before sending it to table. Gas is the most favourable means of producing a good gratin. Saute.—A saute implies meat, &c., cooked briskly over a hot fire; butter and oil are the best materials, though lard and dripping may be substituted. The article under treatment must be turned over quickly without being pricked by the fork or other implement, as this would allow the juices to escape.

233 Coffee, Chocolate tablespoonfuls of powder are the ordinary allowance for every breakfast-cupful of water. Put the powder into the filtering part of the pot. and pour gradually over this the required quantity of absolutely boiling water. The operation must take place on some suitably hot stand, as the infusion would otherwise get cold, and, of course, it must not boil ; or the pot can stand in a vessel of boiling water whilst it is being prepared. After dinner cafe noir is made in the same manner, but should be much stronger, and the quantities must depend to a great extent on the general taste. Five tablespoonfuls of powder to four coffee-cupfuls of water make a very good beverage. For Turkish coffee a different apparatus is used, and the drink is generally made on the table when wanted in a plain pot fitting on a tripod and a spirit lamp. The cups are diminutive. Put in one teaspoonful of the best freshly-ground powder for each person, and a pinch over “ for the pot.” Nearly fill with boiling water, let it boil up three times, lifting the coffee-pot up promptly as the contents bubble up. After the third time, add about a teaspoonful of cold water, and let it stand a few moments to settle. Pour out carefully, and there will be no sediment in the cup. This is the real Levantine beverage, into which no chicory is ever admitted under any consideration. In a great many families on the Continent this is altogether an unknown quantity ; and, indeed, the coffee is much better without it. However, some people prefer an admixture ; in such a case, one spoonful of chicory to two of the real powder is a fair allowance, and that can be increased or decreased according to liking. As to breakfast, the cafe au lait is an easy matter, the principal question being what kind of pot to use. The ordinary French percolator is an excellent apparatus, and its make at once indicates the method to be followed.

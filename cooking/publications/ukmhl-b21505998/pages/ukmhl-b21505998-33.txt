The cover should be made with an edging, so that embers can be laid on the top, if the oven is not equally heated top and bottom. Aluminium has much in its favour ; it is remarkably light, uncorrosive, not difficult to clean, and very satis- factory for cooking many things ; but until its price has been reduced, it will probably not be generally adopted. Sieves and strainers should be supplemented by the more elaborate “pressoir" whether figuring as the “ tammy,” or the article used for pressing moisture, &c., out of vegetables.

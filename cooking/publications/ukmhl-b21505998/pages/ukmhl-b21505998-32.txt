16 Dainty Meals for Small Households where long steady simmering must take place ; in fact, it would be impossible to carry out certain recipes with- out constant watching were it not for hot embers, the glow of which maintains such even heat. An iron cylinder, with a few holes in the lower part to keep up the draught, and a grating fixed inside at about four inches from the bottom (on which to lay the wood or charcoal), is all that is necessary—the saucepan would stand on the top ; or instead of this a simple iron grid fixed on a stand would answer the purpose. The wood burns well upon such an apparatus, and the pan can be kept in the right position by means of a stand such as is used in baking tins to raise the meat. Either of these contrivances is to be placed on the side of the range, where there is no fear of obnoxious fumes. The gas oven is the only substitute for this primitive appliance. The braisiere, by the way, is a kitchen utensil which is sadly lacking in most English kitchens ; in fact, it is even doubtful whether it is to be obtained from local ironmongers ; but it is a most useful addition to the housewife’s belongings, and if it were only used more often, it would easily be procured from any good establishment. There are, however, several shops in London where French utensils can be obtained, if not at once, certainly by ordering them. The only thing needful is a demand for them.

There are, of course, many cases when it is possible to make shift with anything, but braising ought to be done in the oven, and the long handles to the ordinary saucepan precludes the possibility of adopting this course, unless the oven is immense and the joint proportionately small. Again, some process approaching real braising can be arranged by means of hot embers placed over the cover ;

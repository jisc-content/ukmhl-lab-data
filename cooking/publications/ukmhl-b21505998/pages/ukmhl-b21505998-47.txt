3i Stocks slices), a piece of bacon rind, and a couple of slices of ham. Let this all cook over the fire, well covered. Before the moisture which will naturally be produced by these several ingredients be dried up, add the necessary quantity of water (enough to cover the contents of the saucepan by about two inches). Now let it simmer slowly, after the first boil, for three or four hours. Strain the gravy, which will turn into a thick jelly when it has been standing in a cold place for some time, and use it when required. When the contents of the stock-pot have run low, or when the broth is weak, it can be greatly improved by the addition of a spoonful or more of this excellent concentrated broth.

Of course the proportions can be in- creased, or, if the broth is required strong, more meat can be added ; this is a fair proportion for delicate persons and invalids.

Cut up about 1 lb. of lean beef and half a fowl boned, pound them well in a mortar ; when it is well shredded and nearly in a paste, put it into a saucepan with a little salt and a pint and a half of water. Let it boil over a good fire, stirring gently all the time ; as soon as it boils skim it thoroughly, and add two carrots, two leeks, one parsnip, an onion, and some celery, all sliced. Put the cover on, and let the whole simmer for twenty

163 Poultry a sautÂ£ pan containing enough oil to cover the bottom entirely, and when this is hot, add the chicken ; let them lie till well coloured, then turn and repeat the process. It can be served plain with a sauce tartare, but is specially recommended with the pale Driessauces. To choose a turkey, feel the horny skin near the foot ; if it is soft, and of a greyish-white, the bird will be good and tender; after ten or twelve months the skin becomes scaly and reddish in colour. This bird should be killed at least two days before it is cooked, but its crop should be empty at the time. The best kind of stuffing consists of whole chestnuts, boiled till tender without crumbling, and slightly seasoned to taste, or the chestnuts may be crushed to a paste, well seasoned, and mixed with a little cream or sour milk and the pounded liver, heart, &c. Sausage meat, or a mixture of the same and chestnuts, is also frequently used. In almost all stuffing, mushrooms and, where desired, the delicious but expensive truffle, are naturally to be recommended, but excellent results are obtainable without resorting to such costly in- gredients. In roasting a turkey, whether at the open fire or in the oven, the taste is greatly improved by the addition of slices of bacon, whilst sliced carrots, onions, &c., in the basting material considerably improve the flavour. Turkey can be served in any of the ways given above for chickens. When it is to be eaten cold or served as a supper dish, it is advisable to bone it ; this can be done at home, but the poulterer always undertakes the opera- tion for a customer if he be desired to do so. In this case it should be stuffed very carefully and also plenti- fully, so that none of the parts of the bird fall in, other- wise it would look shapeless and unsightly. Truffles generally figure largely in this stuffing, and the result is most excellent.

PREFACE In this volume, for which an apology is perhaps necessary, seeing what a large number of culinary works have already been published, I have endeavoured to give some practical hints and carefully-tried recipes which should be especially useful to small or moderate households. It is well known that dinners for three or four persons are often more difficult to arrange than more important meals, and my main object has been to help the worried housewife to a solution of the problem “ How can I produce a dainty meal with only this or that in the larder ? ” The bulk of the recipes contained in this book have already appeared, in serial form, in the Queen news- paper, and I am indebted to the kindness of the Editor of the same for permission to reproduce them here.

Sauces 59 which are intended for a small household, can be reduced or increased, as required); moisten with some consomme, or plain stock, and a little meat gravy ; let this gently simmer for three hours. Skim carefully whenever necessary, and at five different intervals during the three hours ladle out some of the mixture, hold the ladle high above the saucepan and drop back the contents, so that they are thoroughly well mixed.

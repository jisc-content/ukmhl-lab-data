CHAPTER II. THEORETICAL. Now for the dry-as-dust theory, which I announced in the first chapter. If the mistress who is engaging a cook were competent to put a few searching questions to the applicant for the place, as an examiner is wont to do (always supposing she knew what to ask), the queries might run thus : How many ways are there of boiling ? What is a gratin ? What is frying ? How is a sautd made ? What is stock ? Court bouillon ? and so on. This is but a “ sketchy ” catechism, yet if the correct answers were forthcoming from mistress or cook, the happiness of many homes would be more assured than it is now. I have no space to make this an exhaustive theoretical treatise; but just considering that elementary points are generally omitted from cookery manuals, I must try and show how a slight knowledge of these few facts would heighten the interest taken by the operator, and improve the results of her labour. There are two culinary operations, viz. the one brought about by means of boiling or ebullition, and that of which the chief characteristic is concentration. Boiling.—This increases the flavour and richness of the liquor, or sauce, or gravy produced, in the same proportion as the substance which is being cooked loses its most nourishing juices. This is illustrated by the

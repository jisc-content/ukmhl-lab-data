43 Soups an hour. Beat up in the tureen the yolk of one egg with a dessertspoonful of milk, and stir the soup as it is poured into the tureen. These soups can be served with or without bread. It must be remembered that the thin slices of bread so often found in foreign potages are not liked by everybody, although they have their raison d'etre ; the crumb, suddenly soaked in the boiling liquid, is quickly reduced to a creamy pulp, which adds much to the mellowness of the soup, and the very thin crusts are not at all detrimental to either the appearance or the taste of the whole.

In a great many soups the crotUes au fromagZ are used, and greatly improve the flavour. They are prepared thus :—Grease a small baking tin very slightly, put some thin, evenly-cut slices of bread into it, sprinkle them with grated cheese, put the tin into a hot oven, and, when the cheese begins to melt, place them in the tureen and pour the soup over them.

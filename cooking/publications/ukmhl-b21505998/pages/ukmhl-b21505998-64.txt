Veerasawmy, the cele- brated Indian chef, I am able to give here his delicious recipe for Mulligatawny Soup. Ingredients :—One quart pure beef or mutton stock, two tablespoonfuls of Moong Dhall boiled soft in about one pint of water, one small onion finely sliced, four cloves, two cardamoms, one small stick of Indian cin- namon two inches long, 1 oz. butter, one dessertspoonful (heaped) of Nizam mulligatawny paste,1 one small glass of port wine, salt to taste. Into a deep saucepan put the butter, sliced onion, cloves, cardamoms and cinnamon, and cook until the onion turns a pale straw colour. Now add the heaped dessertspoonful of mulligatawny paste, stir thoroughly, cover the pan and cook the contents slowly for about five minutes, taking care that it does not burn ; next add the stock, boiled dhall and salt to taste, stir the whole thoroughly and let it boil up; strain through a coarse sieve, and then set the soup again on the fire to come to the boil, add the port wine and serve (the wine may be omitted).

CHAPTER XIV. SWEETS, TARTS, ETC. The next subject is that of sweets, and of these so many hundreds have been given in various cookery books that only some good and less well-known recipes, suitable for small households, need be given here. To begin with pastry, which is an essential requisite for many dishes that do not by any means exclusively belong to high-class cookery. Recipes for making this are, doubtless, ex- tremely useful, but there is a knack in working dough that will make a failure or a success, independently of the most minute instructions. Again, though it is a good plan to carry out a recipe to the letter, it is also obvious that experience must teach little differences upon which the operator must act at her own discretion. But certain apparent trifles are not for that reason to be put aside. In this special branch of cookery, details, not of ingredients, but of outward circumstances, are of the greatest importance in helping to bring about a good result.

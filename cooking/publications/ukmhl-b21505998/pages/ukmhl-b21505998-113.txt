Fish 97 plentifully as desired, boil the whole up once more. Have ready some potatoes boiled, cut them in slices, fill a fireproof dish with alternate layers of potatoes, cod fish, pimentoes, and sauce, proceeding thus until the dish is quite full. Finish off with a sprinkling of sauce, cover thickly with bread raspings, and bake for thirty-five minutes in a hot oven. Serve at once in the same dish. Lamproies Erites (Lampreys, Fried).—Cut the fish in pieces and lay it in a strong brine for one hour. Strain off the liquor ; put the pieces into a saucepan covered with a court-bouillon ; let it boil up once, then draw it aside, and let it simmer gently. When the fish is quite tender, put the saucepan with its contents in a cool place ; take out the fish when it is only lukewarm, weight it in a colander, and when quite cold, trim and cut the pieces into shape. Meantime strain the liquor, remove the fat, make a fairly thick white sauce with the usual ingredients, and reduce it by boiling. Thicken it with yolk of egg, and strain. Brush the fish over with the sauce, piece by piece, rolling it in breadcrumbs directly after ; dip them into some well-beaten yolks ; fry quickly (not putting more than three or four pieces in the pan at one time). Serve with a sauce piquante, or with crisply-fried parsley. a la Bourguignonne.—Clean a large lamprey, remove the large cartilage that runs down the back ; cut the fish into pieces, and sprinkle them thickly with salt. Prepare a colourless roux, with about jib. of flour and butter respectively ; stir into this some white wine over the fire till boiling point. Season plentifully, put in the fish, when nearly tender add a dozen or more mushrooms. After allowing this to simmer gently for twenty minutes, strain off the sauce, remove the fat and put it back on the fire to reduce it, stirring all the time. Have ready some neat slices of fried bread,

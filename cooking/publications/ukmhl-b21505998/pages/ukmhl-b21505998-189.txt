i73 Venison The subject of Venison is one which requires thought and care, whether it be purchased in single joints, or whether it has to undergo home treatment from the time the animal has been shot, as is often the case in places where venison abounds. Without taking into consideration the fact that some people like it very “ high,” the general condition should be a happy medium to suit all tastes. To attain this object, it should not be too fresh, for it would then be tough and insipid, nor must it be hung too long ; it must be kept in a cool place, where there is a certain amount of air ; the joints must, moreover, never be soaked, or even dipped, in water to free them from blood, &c., but merely washed with a cloth wrung out of lukewarm water, changing the water once or twice, if necessary, till the meat is quite ready to use. After that the meat should be dried with another cloth. Where the whole animal is available, it must be hung up as soon as possible after having been killed, then skinned, drawn, and cleaned as above. If it is judged necessary to delay the too rapid seasoning of the animal, the best thing to do is to sprinkle it with powdered charcoal, which will not in any way interfere with either taste or flavour ; or some parts might with advantage be cut off, carefully boned, and preserved for a considerable time as follows : — After the removal of the bones and a cleansing of each separate joint, which should be carefully cut to the size most convenient for subsequent use, pack them tightly in a large jar, stew in with them some crushed bay- leaves, peppercorns, and pounded mace; cover the whole with good beef suet or mutton fat, melted over the fire and poured in when lukewarm; when the fat has set, tie a muslin over the top, and store in a cold place. Separate joints can also be preserved by merely brushing them all over quickly with lukewarm fat;

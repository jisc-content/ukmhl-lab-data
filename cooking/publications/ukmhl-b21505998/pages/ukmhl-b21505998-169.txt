Pork 153 after being neatly trimmed, part of the bone being previously sawn off, &c., can be prepared in the same way before the grilling process or not, as preferred. They may be served with a sauce Robert, and answer the purpose of an entree. This same course is also represented by the ears, tail, tongue, or feet of the animal. Here are some ways of preparing these different items :— Oreilles (Ears).—Scald and trim them neatly, boil them slowly in sufficient water to cover them, and containing lentils or white haricot beans ; if there is any liquor handy in which some pork has already been cooked, it will improve the flavour considerably ; or they can be braised with onions, &c. ; or finally, they may be fried in bread- crumbs and egg, just like calves’ ears.

Wrap each piece separately in some butter muslin, put them to boil in a pan with butter, salt, a large bouquet, an onion studded with cloves, a sprig of basil, and a root of garlic. Fix the feet in the pot by pressing into the latter two or three laths crosswise some two inches or so from the bottom. The first water used should be cold. When this has boiled skim it well, put in more water if necessary (this time boiling), put on the cover, and after the necessary skimming has been done let it boil for about four hours. Rut aside to cool, undo the muslin, then prepare the

Soups 39 slow boiling, put in the necessary amount of stock that will be wanted for the soup (or just a little more to allow for the boiling), and let it simmer for one hour more. Put into the tureen a little cream, or some good milk (about half a tumblerful), and a tiny piece of fresh butter; pour the hot soup into the tureen, stirring briskly all the time, and serve at once with or without fried bread. Another:â€”To each person reckon one tablespoonful of well-washed pearl barley, and nearly ^ oz. of butter to ever}? two spoonfuls ; let this simmer for a few minutes with the cover on, add the necessary broth, put in salt and pepper, and let it simmer for two hours. A quarter of an hour before serving stir in a teaspoonful of dry flour, previously dissolved in an eggcupful of cream, or half a small tumblerful of milk ; beat it up briskly, and let the whole boil again. This is a most delicious soup, and excellent for invalids. It can be much improved by putting in some chicken bones, if these are available ; they should be removed before the flour, &c., are stirred in. This same soup, entirely strained, can also be used with great advantage as a foundation for a vegetable soup, for dinner parties, for instance. When strained, put the liquor back into the saucepan, and add some cauliflower picked into small sprigs, with a few morels, or asparagus well scraped and cut into suitable pieces (not forgetting to parboil them, with a little butter, before they are put in); the soup should then simply simmer till the cauli- flower or asparagus be quite tender. The subject of vegetable soups is extensive enough to fill a good-sized volume, so that I can only mention some of the most useful, the preparation of which involves but little trouble. When properly made, nothing could be nicer or more wholesome as a daily course ; but other- wise, it is difficult to imagine a more objectionable concoction.

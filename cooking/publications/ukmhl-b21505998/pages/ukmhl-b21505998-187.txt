171 Game are done put them on a warm dish and stand it in a hot place; meantime reduce the sauce, stir in a glassful of Madeira, and pour it, boiling, over the birds. To roast quails, pepper and salt them inside and out; tuck a small slice of bacon under the legs and wings; tie the birds up separately in vine-leaves, or thin buttered paper; string them on a skewer and roast before the open fire—or grill them, or put them on a rack in a baking tin with fat, good gravy, a few slices of bacon, and a pinch of salt. Serve very hot. An excellent chaud-froid can be made, too, but for this it is usual to bone the birds and to stuff them; the latter process is almost entirely a matter of taste. The stuffing can be composed of almost anything—as, for instance, cold remains of chicken, a little liver, a couple of hard-boiled yolks of egg, chopped mushrooms, some roll-crumb previously soaked in milk and squeezed free from moisture, chopped herbs and onions, and plenty of seasoning. The birds, being carefully filled so as to keep in good shape, can then be wrapped in pieces of fine butter muslin ; put them into a sautoir, and poach or stew them slowly in equal parts of Madeira wine and game stock, made, of course, beforehand with the bones, &c., of game. When done remove the muslin, and stand them aside to get cold. Then arrange them on a dish and cover them with jelly, being careful to fill up the gaps between the birds with the same sub- stance. Afterwards cover them with a dark chaud-froid sauce made thus:—Put into a saucepan about an ordinary tumblerful of Madeira, and the same quantity of game stock; let it reduce over the fire to about one-third of the original quantity; add to this about a pint of sauce in a half glaze, and reduce all over a brisk fire, so that it may thicken considerably. After this add gradually small lumps of meat jelly, stirring over the fire fairly

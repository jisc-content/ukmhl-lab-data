77 Fish In order to keep the fish for two or three days in a moderate temperature (for it is naturally hardly advisable to attempt such things in any great heat), they should be cleaned, dried inside and out, and thoroughly sprinkled with finely-powdered sugar, then stood carefully in a cold, dry place. When the fish is sufficiently boiled, it generally comes to the surface of the liquor in which it has been cooked, and the fins can be easily removed; but it is a great mistake to overboil it, so that it is in any way broken or disfigured ; large fish should always be boiled in a proper fish kettle containing a holder, by means of which the contents may be lifted out without risk. When fish is to be baked, it is an excellent plan, especially with the larger kinds, to lard them carefully ; they can then be either put into a brisk oven, or, if more convenient, can be prepared in a frying-pan ; in this case, however, the fire must be fierce and clear, and the operation should be very rapid, otherwise the fish will become sodden instead of crisp, as it should be in its state of perfection. Finally, if the fish is to be served cold, it should be removed from the liquor in which it has been cooked as soon as it is done; both fish and liquor must be set to cool thoroughly ; the fish can then be replaced in the cold liquor, and kept there till it is wanted for the table. If grilled, be careful always to heat the gridiron before putting the fish upon it; this remark also applies to the patent fish griller mentioned in Chapter III. Now, as it is my object to emphasize dainty cooking, it may be well to observe at this point that boiling fish in plain water is almost an unknown thing with the foreign cook, even in the most modest households ; to relieve the monotony which must result from such a proceeding, a special broth is made and kept in stock as a matter of course, and varies for fresh and salt-water fish. This is called court bouillon, whilst another expression is cooking the fish “au bleu.” The

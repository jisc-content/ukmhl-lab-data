Sweets, Tarts, etc. 215 more sugar over it and serve, or let it stand till cold. The same plan should be observed with plums, peaches, cherries, gooseberries, pears, and apricots. Christmas Plum Pudding.—Provide the following in- gredients : 1 lb. of suet, |lb. of flour, |lb. breadcrumbs, lib. raisins, ilb. currants, ilb. sultanas, 2oz. each of orange peel, lemon peel, citron peel; 2oz. of almonds not cut small; twelve bitter almonds pounded, ioz. mixed spice, one teaspoonful of ginger, the juice and rind (cut small) of one lemon, ten eggs, one teacupful of sugar, two full wineglasses of brandy, a little salt, and add a little milk at the last. The suet must be entirely freed from skin and thoroughly shredded ; this process is greatly facilitated by the use of a wonderfully simple and inexpensive little apparatus to be had from the Household Supply Company, New Bond Street, and of most good ironmongers (it can be used for many other purposes, such as vegetables, See., Sec.). The flour must be carefully dried and sifted, and the indispensable stoning of raisins becomes an easy and pleasant task if the comparatively new raisin stoner is used. The preparation of the mixture can quite con- veniently last over two or three days, and it cannot be stirred too often or too thoroughly during its manufacture. Another important thing to remember is that it cannot boil too long ; finally, it decidedly improves by keeping. The preliminary boiling of a freshly-made plum pudding may vary from five to ten hours ; it can then be boiled with advantage for another four to six hours before being served. With regard to keeping ; the puddings, after undergoing the first boil, should be stored just as they are in a dry cupboard ; they can be used throughout the year, and, as I said above, are better every time a fresh one is used.

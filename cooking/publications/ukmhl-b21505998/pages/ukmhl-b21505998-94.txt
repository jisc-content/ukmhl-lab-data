78 Dainty Meals for Small Households court bouillon for fresh-water fish can be prepared with white cooking wine or vinegar, as most convenient. For instance, put three pints of water over the fire, with two carrots, two onions, roughly cut in pieces, a garlic root, two or three cloves, a bay-leaf, a small handful of parsley, and salt and pepper to taste ; let it boil for one hour, strain it, and put the liquor back over the fire with the same quantity of white wine (or half the quantity of good white vinegar), and let it boil.

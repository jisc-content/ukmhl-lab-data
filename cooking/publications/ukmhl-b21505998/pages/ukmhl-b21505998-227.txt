Sweets, Tarts, etc. 211 lard is used it must be absolutely fresh, and worked in a cool room. Further, the knife or cutter must be sharp, and when the pastry is brushed over with egg or water as the case may be, this should not be dropped on any other part except on that on which it is required, for such a proceeding would prove detrimental to the result. Lastly, the oven should be kept well closed to ensure a perfectly even heat, otherwise the pastry will fall in on the side where the heat is not so great, and it is not until the pastry has risen that a sheet of paper should be spread over the top ; then the ventilator may be opened to let out the moisture and to completely dry the contents. A good way of proving the oven is this : Lay a sheet of paper inside ; if it turns yellow quickly, the degree is attained for puff pastry, and that which is made with butter, and with yeast. Other kinds of dough, &c., succeed better when the heat of the oven colours the paper more slowly. It is impossible to give here all the different ways of making pastry. For a good all-round pastry, especially for sweet purposes, it is safe to reckon equal parts of flour and butter, though some people consider the result rather too rich ; in such a case more flour should be added. Put the former on the board in a circle, add a pinch of salt and a quarter of the butter, and pour in just enough water to allow of mixing the ingredients togefher, so as gradually to form a stiff paste. When this is done roll it out, divide the remainder of the butter into three parts, break one into small pieces all over the pastry ; fold it up and roll it out again ; repeat the operation with the second part of the butter, then with the third. Fold up a last time, and set in a cool place overnight. This will be found useful for all ordinary purposes.

Mutton 137 round, to a presentable shape, and bake in the oven or stew till tender. The breast of mutton can be stuffed in the same way as veal ; but, being rather fat, it is much more wasteful. For stews and entrees various parts of the mutton are much more useful than the foregoing beef or veal, and can be varied with different vegetables, served as purees, &c, As regards lamb, it is generally roasted, the principal joints at any rate, and that, as far as possible, in front of the fire ; though, of course, they can be treated otherwise if desired ; the fillet, for instance, may be cut up and grilled and afterwards served with a bechamel or a sauce tartare.

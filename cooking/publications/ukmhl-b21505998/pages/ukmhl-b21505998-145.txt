Beef 129 poultry (though this mixture is not imperative), to form the principal ingredient for stuffing a marrow or a cucumber. This minced beef, added to rice previously parboiled, onions, breadcrumbs, chopped herbs, tomatoes, and plenty of flavouring, is the very best material for the delicious stuffed marrow. It is put into the centre of the vegetable after the latter has been scooped out, well tied round with string, and baked in a dish in the oven. The ends may be closed with some plain dough, or the whole thing can be wrapped in very fine muslin, which can be removed before serving, and will effectually prevent the stuffing from falling out. Besides the actual large joints or pieces de resistance provided by that most useful animal the ox, there are many ways of preparing various parts of it. The well-known “ bifteck,” as the Frenchman calls it, is, oddly enough, much better treated abroad than it is in this country. The English cook, of course, may excel in grilling, but, given a steak that is perhaps neither very young nor particularly tender, the Frenchman brings about a better result ; his production will pass muster anywhere, and will probably be put down as a piece of fillet, when it may only have been plain beef steak, or some other inferior piece of meat. The best way in which to turn out an excellent fillet, so called or otherwise (and obviously it becomes the good cook to be able to make shift with anything if the necessity occurs), is to cut into suitable pieces part of the fillet, preferably, but in default of this any part of the rump will do. Shape and trim them well, beat them thoroughly, rub them with salt, pepper, and good salad oil, flavour them very slightly with garlic, and arrange them in layers between two plates, the upper one of which should be heavily weighted. According to the time of year, and still more to the part of the animal used, this weighting should be more or less prolonged— K

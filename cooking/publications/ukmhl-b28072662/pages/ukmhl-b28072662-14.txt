BREAD, CAKES. AND BISCUITS. 2 favourable circumstances, whilst under unfavourable ones various more or less harmless additions are made to inferior flour to bring it to the fineness of texture and delicacy of appearance required. Taken at their best these adultei'a- tions spell waste, for the buyer is paying for a superior article, and only getting one of inferior quality all round ; and one which, moreover, will very likely upset all one’s arrangements, for recipes based on the use of the best materials will not work out correctly when inferior stuff is used, and to this fact many culinary failures are due. But granted this is the worst of harmless adulteration, adul- teration of a less innocuous kind leads to far more serious trouble, so much so in fact that the bread supply and its purity and quality are points it behoves every mother to study pretty closely. There are divers kinds of flour (beginning at the top of the scale), from the delicate Hungarian or Vienna flour, and “ best pastry whites ” (as the very whitest and lightest flour is called in this country), down through “ seconds ” or “ household,” to wholemeal and bran flour. Now, granted that these are all pure, they all have their uses. The first kinds are used for pastry, delicate cakes, and other articles more valued as tempting to the palate than for their nutritious properties; for bread, “ household ” or “ seconds ” flour is far more wholesome, containing as it does a great deal of the bran, or “ middlings,” as it is technically called, which is really of importance from an hygienic point of view. Lastly, there was a rough kind of flour produced by grinding up the wheat entirely, husk, bran, and corn, just as it came, but this produced too rough a flour to suit modern taste and its use has been gradually aban- doned, until improvements brought in, as a substitute, the well known “wholemeal” flour, which consists of coarsely ground wheat from which only the very coarsest parts of the husk have been omitted. Ordinary brown bread is usually made from this, though sometimes seconds

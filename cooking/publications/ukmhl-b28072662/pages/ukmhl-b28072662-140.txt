Buns, Saffron.—Mix one quart warm milk (have this warmer in winter than in summer), Jib. flour, Jib. sugar, 2oz. German yeast, and two eggs to a sponge, and let it rise in a warm place till it is as light as it will go. Then work in Jib. more sugar, Joz. mixed spice, Joz. carraway seeds, and 41b. of flour (into which you have rubbed 12oz. butter), and enough tincture of saffron to colour it. When well worked to a soft dough, set it away, covered, in a warm place until it has risen several inches, then divide it evenly into balls, set these on warmed and buttered baking sheets, about one inch apart, again let them rise, then brush over with sugar dissolved in boiling milk, and bake at once in a hot oven. When taken out, brush over again with milk.

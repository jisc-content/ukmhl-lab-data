101 CAKES. buttered paper round and underneath the cake, in a steady soaking oven. A little bran or sawdust should be put on to the baking tin under the cake, while baking, to prevent any risk of burning. If covered with almond icing and royal icing, and decorated, this makes a capital birthday cake. Cake, Pound (Cheap).—Beat to a cream 6oz.of butter and 6oz. of lard or beef marrow, and mix it with lib. of sugar, three eggs, ljlb. of Coomb’s Eureka flour, and a pint of milk; mix thoroughly, and finish off like any other pound cake. “ Lavy” (Pain lave).—Beat the yolks of twenty- two eggs and the whites of eleven, working to them gradually lib. caster sugar, a little rose water or essence of vanilla, and lastly 12oz. of fine flour mixed with loz. ground bitter almonds.

Beat these all well together, and when thoroughly mixed strew in at the last Jib. dried and sifted flour; put the mixture in a papered tin, and bake at once.

Raspberry.—Beat Jib. of butter (or you may use half butter, half lard, or clarified dripping) to a cream

133 BISCUITS AND SMALL CAKES. be lightly dusted with icing sugar and left in a moderate oven for two or three hours till crisp and of a delicate fawn colour. These can, of course, be flavoured to taste. Remember that, like all meringues, these cakes must be put into the oven the moment they are ready, as they will run if left standing. Calces, Potato.—Bake four large potatoes in their skins, press out all their contents, and mix with this 2oz. of butter or clarified dripping and a little water, beating it well together. Now put 31b. of flour into a basin, make a hollow in the centre with your knuckles, and into this drop the mashed potato, two whole eggs, and, lastly, loz. of dried yeast previously creamed with a teaspoonful of sugar and dissolved in a pint of tepid milk. Knead this all together with as much water as will produce a very soft dough, and let it rise for several hours. When sufficiently risen, put this dough into well-buttered rings, and again let it rise before baking. About half a teaspoonful of salt should be added to each pound of flour, and, if handy, skim milk, or half milk half water, may be used in the mixing instead of water. Queen or Drops.—Cream together lib. each of butter and sugar, then work to this (two or three eggs at a time) fourteen eggs, working each lot well in before adding the next (if too many are added together the mixture is liable to thin suddenly and to curdle in the beating up, a remark that applies to most cake mixing); now sift into this lib. of fine flour and 4oz. well washed and dried currants. When this is thoroughly mixed drop it on to board spread with clean, strong paper in tiny heaps the size of a penny, and bake in a hot oven. — Shrewsbury^—Cream together lib. each of butter and caster sugar; then work in 11b. of fine sifted flour, moistening it with one whole egg; roll it out very thin, cut or stamp it out in lozenges, rounds, &c.; ornament each with two or three carraway comfits or finely-shred

HOUSEHOLD AND FANCY BREADS. 21 in about twelve to fifteen minutes you will find the batter is working well, and is all covered with large bubbles. Now mix in gradually all the flour, working it to a rather soft dough, and using about a pint of tepid water to mix it; it is best, however, to add this water cautiously, for different flours require different quantities of water to bring them to the right texture; the finer the flour the more liquid will it take up. Having mixed your dough to the right stage, you knead it by working it with your fists, throwing the full weight of your body first on one side and then on the other, doubling the edges over towards the centre of the dough, working it in this way till the whole has been thoroughly and evenly kneaded. The time it will require to knead properly depends, of course, on the amount of dough, but for the quantities given above (which I have purposely made small) about twenty minutes will be ample, though it is easy to judge when the dough is sufficiently kneaded, as it will then come clean away from both hands and basin. If you find at the end of the time given above, or even a little later, that it still clings, dust it with a little more flour and knead it again; but in bread making it is always well to have a little patience, for it is one of the things for which no strictly accurate rules can be given, and it is only by experience that one learns to judge offhand of the con- dition and requirements of the flour, dough, &c. It cannot be too often impressed on the beginner that the goodness of the bread depends far more on the care in the mixing and the kneading than on the fineness of the flour, an experienced baker producing infinitely better and sweeter results with coarse flour and good management than the unskilful or negligent practitioner will secure with the finest materials and accessories. Having kneaded the dough till you can lift it out of the basin, leaving the inside quite clean, dust the basin lightly with a little flour, return the dough to the basin, cut it sharply across and across with a knife, re-cover the pan, and let it rise till it is double its original

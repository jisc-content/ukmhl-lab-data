When it has risen well, work into it lib. 2oz. more flour, 31b. fresh butter (slightly warmed if the weather is cold), the yolks of six eggs, and six whole eggs, with two tablespoonfuls of sugar and a teaspoonful of salt; then knead well, moistening the dough as it stiffens with a little fresh cream. Now turn this dough out on to a pastry board and pull it to pieces, gathering these pieces together again and reworking it, kneading it well till it forms a smooth dough free from any lumps. Roll this dough then into a ball, wrap it in a floured cloth, and leave it all night in a cool place or in the cellar. It should have risen to nearly twice its original size before it is used. Now put it on the board, nip off a small piece to form a kind of central knob or flower, and shape the rest of the dough with your hands, giving it a sort of twist as you do so, into a round and fix the knob in the centre. This cake should rise slightly towards the centre in the outer twist. Now put the cake on a well-buttered tin, draw some lines or patterns on it with the point of a knife from the sides to the centre, brush it well over with yolk of egg, and bake in a sharp oven.

Mix all these ingredients thoroughly into the dough ; then butter a mould well, half fill it with the dough, and set it in a moderately warm place to rise till it reaches fully up to the top of the mould, baking it to a nice

The firmer the almond icing the less time will it take to dry. Having thoroughly mastered the art of icing a cake smoothly and evenly, the next step is to “pipe” it, as this style of decoration is called, from the bags and pipes used to apply the icing. These forcing bags and pipes can be bought very cheaply in all sizes and patterns, but, failing these, paper bags are often used by skilled confectioners for the purpose. For these, good, strong (preferably grease proof) paper is essential, indeed, a special kind is sold for the purpose. Cut this paper into squares, cutting these again across diagonally into two even-sized triangles. Now fold each of these triangles to a point, as grocers fold the little paper cones they use for sugar. Put the icing into this bag, folding down the top to cover and keep in the sugar, and with a pair of scissors clip off this point of the cone to the size you wish your thi-eadtobe. To use the pipe, either hold it as in the illustration (Fig. 4) for making dots, stars, &c., or hold it like a pencil when you >yish actually to draw scrolls and patterns, which, however, Fig. 4.

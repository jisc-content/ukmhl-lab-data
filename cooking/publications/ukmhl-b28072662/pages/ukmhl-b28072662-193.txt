CHAPTEE VII CAKE DECORATION, &c. Directions for making various sorts of icings have already- been given, in a previous chapter, but in these days when cakes (and indeed most kinds of eatables) have to look, as well as taste well, a few words may be said on the actual process of icing and further decoration of cakes, petits fours, &c. A very common form of icing for tartlets, little pies, and pastry sandwiches, is known as “water icing.” For this put a short gill of water into a basin, and add to this the unwhisked whites of two eggs (if they were whisked before adding them to the water, they would not mix properly, but would remain on the surface of the -water in a light froth) ; whisk the water and egg whites well together, then with a brush wash the pastry over lightly with this froth, after which dredge it with caster sugar, sprinkle a little more of the froth over the pastry and bake. This sounds, and is, very easy to do, but requires attention to detail to ensure success. For instance, be careful only to put on enough of the froth at first to ensure the sugar sticking, for if more is laid on it will roll off and spoil the surface of the pastry; then see that your coating of caster sugar is a generously thick one, for if put on too thin, the heat of the oven will melt it, and make the paste when cooked, look as if it were varnished. So measure your sugar by the result

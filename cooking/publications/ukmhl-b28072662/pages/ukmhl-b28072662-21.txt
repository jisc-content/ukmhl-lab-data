9 BREAD. three months old (it may be used at the end of a fortnight or three weeks, but never producessuch good results), must be stored in a perfectly dry place, and kept as much as possible from contact with the air, as the least suspicion of damp will be enough to give it a musty, unpleasant flavour, which nothing can either eradicate or hide. The following scale of weights for flour is well worth mastering : One pint of flour weighs 14oz. One quart (two pints, or half a quartern) weighs lflb., and will make a loaf weighing not quite 2|lb. One quartern (two quarts, or half a gallon, or a quarter cf a stone) weighs 3ilb., and makes a loaf weighing 41b. 6oz. the statutory quartern. One gallon (half a stone or two quarterns) weighs 71b., and produces 8Jlb. of bread. One stone (or two gallons or a peck) weighs 141b., and makes 17Jib. of bread. Two pecks (or two stones) weigh 28lb., and equal half a bushel. One bushel (four pecks) weighs 561b., and makes 701b. of bread. One sack of flour weighs 2801b., and equals five bushels. One pound ahead of bread is the usual daily average of home-made bread, but, like all averages, this varies some- what, one person almost living on bread, whilst another barely touches it. But a little practice soon enables one to judge. Next to be considered are the different kinds of ferment used to “ raise ” or lighten bread, of which there are several varieties. Of these the original one, brewer’s yeast or “barm,” as it was called (and, indeed, still is in out of the way parts), was for long enough the only ferment used. The objection to it was that its quality was never quite to be relied on, and the least carelessness in the manufacture or the storing of it was sufficient to render it practically unusable— a point certainly not improved in these modern times, when

CHAPTER II. HOUSEHOLD AND FANCY BREADS. Household Bread.—There are different ways of making this, though they vary more in appearance than in reality. One of the easiest for home baking is the following: Turn a quartern (3£lb.) of flour into a large basin, and set this in a warm place, or even in a slack oven, till the flour is thoroughly warmed through, as this helps in bread-making considerably. Now mix into this two teaspoonfuls of fine salt, stirring it well together, then with your knuckles make a deep hollow in the flour, being careful, however, to keep a good layer of flour at the bottom of the pan. Next rub together loz. of German yeast with a teaspoonful of caster sugar till it “ creams ” (or liquefies), then mix it with rather more than three-quarters of a pint of tepid water (to secure tepid liquid of any kind you must pour together one part absolutely boiling water to two parts of cold, and you will then have the right temperature, whether you use water, milk, or milk and water) ; pour this yeast and water into the hollow of the flour, which bakers term a “ bay,” and draw down lightly from the sides just enough flour to bring the liquid to a thin batter of about the consistency of single cream. Dust this lightly with a little dry flour, cover the basin with a flannel or a doubled cloth, and set the pan in a warm corner, out of the draught, to rise, or “ prove ” as it is technically termed. If the yeast is good,

180 BREAD, CARES, AND BISCUITS. Zwieback, Almond.â€”Make a paste with fib. of flour, |lb. of butter, five whole eggs, and a little cinnamon to taste; work the paste till it is quite smooth, but handle it very lightly ; have ready a quantity of blanched, peeled, and chopped almonds; roll out the paste, cut it into fingers or fancy shapes, roll them in the chopped almonds so that they are well covered with the pieces, and bake in a quick oven, j It is manifestly impossible, in a book of this size, to give anything like an exhaustive catalogue of foreign cakes (even granting that the list of what we should call cakes is a relatively short one), but the above may serve as examples which have met with approval in the columns of the Queen. As a rule, cakes abroad are either in the nature of small cakes or biscuits, or else they are what in this country are specially termed g&teaux, and seem to us better fitted for the sweet course, for which, indeed, they are mostly used.

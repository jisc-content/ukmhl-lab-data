Now turn this out on a board slightly dusted with oatmeal, and knead it out into a round, lin. thick; rub it lightly over with more oat- meal, and toast it before the fire in a toaster, or on the girdle, according to your pleasure, turning it repeatedly till nicely browned on both sides, and serve. This cake (for which a real Highland receipt is given) requires knack and practice, as the cake is apt to break if in the least overshortened. Delicious with butter, honey, or golden syrup. Bannocks.—Hub 2oz. of clarified dripping into £lb. of oatmeal, with a small teaspoonful of baking powder and a pinch of salt; make it all into a smooth, stiff dough with cold water, roll it out faii’ly thinly, cut it into triangles, and bake on a hot, greased girdle, turning it once in the cooking; or bake on a buttered baking tin in a very hot oven for a few minutes. Aberdeen.—Beat two eggs well, with a pinch of salt, and sugar to taste, and make a very stiff batter with about half a pint of milk and a short pound of flour, with which has been sifted a full teaspoonful of baking powder. Beat it well, then pour it on a hot, greased girdle, and bake, turning it once to get both sides nicely coloured. The batter should be too thick to run, but just right to drop from the spoon ; it will spread well on touching the hot girdle. The difference between this and “dropped scones ” is chiefly that it is made in one large cake, the size of the girdle, and only quartered when dished. Corn Flour.—Mix a teaspoonful each of salt and sugar into a breakfastcupful of cornflour; then mix into it a pint of absolutely boiling milk; now let it cool, and when nearly cold stir in two well-beaten eggs, and bake it in spoonfuls on a girdle, or turn the whole mixture into a buttered piedish and bake in a very hot oven. Lift it out when done and serve hot. Fried.—Pour just enough boiling milk or water

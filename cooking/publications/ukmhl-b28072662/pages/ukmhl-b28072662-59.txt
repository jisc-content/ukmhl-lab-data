47 ROLLS, &c. on to a pint of cornflour to scald t, and leave it till nearly cold. Now mix into this a tablespoonful of yeast, half a teaspoonful of salt, one small egg, and a pint of flour, working it all well together; then cover the pan and set it in a warm corner to rise, after which work in a quarter of a teaspoonful of bicarbonate of soda, break up the dough into neat pieces, and fry in plenty of hot fat. When nicely coloured drain and serve. Baps.—Make a dough in the usual way with Joz. yeast, loz. salt, loz. sugar, loz. lard, a quart of water, and suf- ficient flour (about 10lb. to 111b.) to produce 121b. of dough. When the dough is well risen, turn it out on a floured pastry board and cut it into 4oz. pieces, kneading and making these up into balls; roll these into oval shapes, set them on a flat tin to rise, then bake in a nice hot oven. Excellent “ pan bread ” can be made with this dough, if to 41b. of the dough you add three-quarters of a pint of cold water and loz. to ljoz. of salt; let it stand for an hour, then knead it up and bake. The water used to dissolve the yeast should be at a temperature of 96°, but not more than 80° when the sponge is working. This dough will rise round at the top, and when it leaves the sides of the pan or flattens, it is ready for working. If left lying too long, the dough will sour. (This recipe was given by a Scotch baker famous for his “ bap3.”) Biscuits.—Breakfast.—Mix a pound of flour to a nice paste with a gill of thick cream, and half to a teaspoonful of salt to taste; roll the paste out pretty thin, stamp it out in rounds, and bake fifteen to twenty minutes in a hot oven. Butter.—Eub Jib. of butter into a quartern of flour till smooth; now add a gill of yeast, and stir in gradually a pint of warm water; cover the pan, and let the dough rise in a warm place to twice its original bulk, then dust a little fresh flour over it, and knead it; again let it rise for a little, then turn it out on a floured board, roll it

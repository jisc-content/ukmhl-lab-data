CAKES. 107 though very nice, portentous in its solidity, not to say indigestibility. Cake, Seed.—4oz. butter, 4oz. lard, loz. sugar, lijlb. of flour, 4oz. lemon peel, half pint of milk, four large eggs, £oz. carraway seeds, |oz of baking powder, a little essence of lemon, and a few drops of prepared turmeric. Work the butter and sugar to a cream, then add the eggs, one by one; and when the eggs are well mixed with the butter and sugar stir in all the other ingredients, fill up the moulds, and bake in a moderate oven (a 2lb. cake will take forty-five minutes). Shortbread.—£lb. each of flour and butter, 4oz. rice flour, and 4oz. caster sugar. Mix these ingre- dients well together with the tips of your fingers till you get a soft dough, then shape into a round or a square, pinch up the edges neatly, prick the top over with a fork, and bake it (on a flat baking tin) for fifteen or twenty minutes in a fairly hot oven. Leave it on the baking tin till cool, as it is apt to break if handled while hot; if liked, strips of candied peel, or com- fits can be placed on the top. This method of making short- cake is the real Scotch way, but requires practice, as it is difficult to form a paste with only the above materials. One egg, or a very little milk, helps the process.

Set this aside in a warm place to rise; when well risen mix into it 4oz. warmed butter, previously beaten up with the yolks of eight eggs, a teaspoonful of salt, and a little milk, and, when it is well incorporated with the sponge (as the yeast batter, or mixture, is called by bakers), work into it as much more sifted flour as will make up 21b. altogether with that used in mixing the sponge. Knead this all lightly together, make it up into cakes 2in. thick; put each of these into a ring (such as are used for muffins), set these on buttered baking sheets, and, when the dough has risen again nicely, put them in a warm oven and bake. When done slice them pretty thickly, butter well, and serve hot. ■ Sift together lib. of flour and one saltspoonful of salt, then rub in 4oz. of butter till smooth; now mix in half a pint of warm milk, half a gill of fresh yeast, and two well-beaten eggs.

When baked slice each cake into three

72 BREAD, CAKES, AND BISCUITS. out iu round cakes, wash these over with milk or egg, and bake in a sharp oven. (Lito is a new flour brought out by the Movis Co., and is extremely useful for cakes, bread, and puddings of all kinds.) Scones, Barleymcal.—Mix a little salt with as much fresh barley meal as you choose, and mix it to a stiff paste with hot milk. Roll this out in thick round cakes, cut into four, and bake on a greased girdle or a quick oven. Butter and serve hot. A level teaspoonful of baking powder to the pound of meal improves these greatly. Soda.—Rub together half a teaspoonful each of salt and cream of tartar with nearly a teaspoonful of bicarbonate of soda and lib. of flour; make this all to a soft, lithe dough with buttermilk, knead it for a little on a floured pastry board, roll it out about ^in. thick, shape it into round cakes (a clean saucepan lid is a capital cutter), cut each across into four, and bake on a not too hot floured girdle. Sour Milk.—Add a teaspoonful of bicarbonate of soda to a pint of sour milk or cream, and when this is thoroughly dissolved add to it not quite 7oz. of butter or lard, and sufficient flour to make it all a soft dough; now roll it out into cakes large enough to fit the girdle, or the pan they are to be cooked in (or a well-floured and delicately clean frying pan can be used); turn as soon as one side is cooked, and when the other side is ready lift the cake off, split and butter it generously, put the two pieces together again, cut it into four, and serve either cold or warm, but not hot. If liked, sieved jam or pulped fruit may be spread with the butter; or cream may replace the latter. When tiny wood strawberries (or, indeed, any other small berries, such as bilberries, dewberries, &c.), dusted with caster sugar and sprinkled with lemon juice, are used with the cream instead of the jam, this scone is the well-known American strawberry short cake. (This is an American recipe.)

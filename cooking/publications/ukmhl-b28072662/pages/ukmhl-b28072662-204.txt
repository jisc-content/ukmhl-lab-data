192 BREAD, CARES, AND BISCUITS. cakes. Foreign cooks bake in this way on their small char- coal hot plates, and indeed prefer these to the ordinary fire or range. The pan with its contents is placed on the trivet over the opening of the hot plate, a second opening being also kept up to the same heat to allow either the top or bottom heat being replenished as required. Foreign cooks also fix wires or strings to the small rack placed in the pan to allow of its being lowered down into the pan with the cake on it and lifted out again when the baking is con- cluded. It is wonderful what may be accomplished by homely and makeshift utensils, and so many readers of the Queen wander off into out of the way parts that it has seemed use- ful to give hints for the utilisation of such simple processes where better means may not be had, for however far one may stray from home, one seldom cares to say good-bye to all one’s home ways and tastes. But though such hints have been given for the amateur cook’s benefit, it must be distinctly impressed on mistresses living in the centre of civilisation and within reach of all the latter’s resources, that they have no right to expect their cooks to work only with such makeshifts. What may be willingly done once or even twice in a way when necessity arises, becomes an exasperation when rendered a daily necessity by the thoughtlessness or the economy (?) of the mistress. Especially is this the case when the cook is short-handed. French mistresses are wiser, and grudge neither materials nor utensils, sagely observing, Qui veut la fin veut les moyens, and it is to this fact that the superiority of the foreign bonne d tout faire over her British equivalent, “the general,” is due.

128 Sweet Puddings. Custard Pudding, Baked.—Take some rich new milk, not quite half a pint for two eggs, unless they are very large ones; if very small use a gill and a half of milk only ; boil the milk and let it get cool, then add it to the eggs, which should first be beaten up; beat very thoroughly with a teaspoonful or more of castor sugar. Have a dish rinsed out with cold water, strain the mixture in, and bake in a very slow oven for half an hour or more. Should the oven be too fierce, set the dish in a tin with a little cold water, for if quickly cooked this is spoiled, by being full of holes and watery, instead of firm and smooth. Note.—Two yolks of eggs to a gill of milk must be used in cases where the whites are excluded from the diet. See hints under Eggs. Dainty Pudding.—This is a decided appetite tempter. Take the pulp of a large baked apple, or two small ones, sieve it, and add a little white sugar, and any flavouring, such as ginger or lemon rind. Put it at the bottom of a half pint pie-dish, in a smooth layer. Beat the yolk of a large egg with half a gill of hot milk, a table- spoonful of cream, and a teaspoonful of sugar, and pour over the apple, which must first be covered with a thin layer of rice cake or sponge cake in slices; set it in a moderate oven for ten to fifteen minutes; then beat the white of the egg to a froth, pile it on the top, dredge with sugar, and brown slightly in the oven (a cool part), allowing a few minutes.

Cereal Cookery, Savoury Puddings, and Eggs. 115 is given. Break an egg into a little basin, and add a dessert spoonful of milk, beat together well; a pinch of salt and pepper may be added, or salt only. Now beat in a tablespoonful of cream; set the basin in a vessel of boiling water over gentle heat, and stir or rather beat with a fork, until the mixture thickens, then serve on toast, spread with a morsel of extract of meat in some cases. Let it cook without hardening. Egg Panada.—This is very strongly recom- mended. It is simple to make, very nourishing, and a famous semi-solid. Take two level table- spoonfuls of sieved bread crumbs, a few days old, brown or white. Add salt and pepper, or omit; beat a small egg well with three table-spoonfuls of good beef tea or gravy (clear) from a joint. Pour while cold over the bread, using a cup or small basin, then cover, and steam in a steamer, or over boiling water for a quarter of an hour. Another way.—Better still, but more trouble. Pour the beef tea or gravy while hot over the bread, cover till cool, then beat it up well; add the egg, beaten, then mix the whole ; finish as before, but give six or seven minutes only. Egg Scrambled, Sweet.—An impromptu pudding. Melt half an ounce of butter in a little saucepan, add a tablespoonful of milk if a large egg, less if small, and half a teaspoonful of white sugar with any flavouring to taste. Add a beaten egg, and stir until it just begins to set, working from the bottom of the pan. Serve on

7o Fish Dishes. be bought veiy cheaply, and a few are some- times included as "makeweights" in the weekly- parcels sent direct from the sea. They should be washed and scraped, and brushed on the white side with oil or butter, and covered with bread crumbs. Bake in a brisk oven until brown and well cooked; no sauce is wanted, but they should be garnished with lemon and parsley. Sole au Gratin.—Butter a fiat dish and sprinkle with fine white bread crumbs ; then lay on the fillets ; season with salt and pepper; proceed as for Whiting au gratin; cover with more crumbs and bake for twenty minutes, or until the fish is quite tender. Sole in Gravy.—Some invalids who have tired of fish with its natural flavour will relish it if a " meaty " taste be given. A small sole may be cooked whole for a minute in water, then drained and put into a little gravy, got by boil- ing down the trimmings for a short time and straining, then adding enough extract of meat to give a pale brown colour and the desired flavour; flavouring ingredients, such as parsley, lemon- rind, or a suspicion of onion with a pinch of nutmeg, may be added, and if a thin gravy be objected to a teaspoonful of arrowroot or corn flour can be added to half a pint. Fillets from a large fish can be similarly served, and any left over may be re-heated in the gravy. Note.—Cook in the gravy gently until the fish is done.

vi Preface. she reads some of my minute directions for the concoction of a glass of toast-water, a cup of gruel, or a morsel of jelly. On the contrary, others may be grateful for them. Of necessity this little book does not exhaust the subject of sick-room fare, the aim being to produce a work—simple, concise, reliable, and cheap—which should meet all ordinary wants. The majority of these recipes have been written expressly for this work; but, in the case of a few, viz., Beef Tea, Rice Pudding, Gruels, and Barley Water (as well as some of the hints on pre-digested foods and the prepara- tion of cereals, also " General Rules for Invalid Cookery"), I am indebted to Messrs. Cassell & Co., Ltd., for permission to reproduce them from " Cassell's New Universal Cookery" (L. Heritage). Not that the recipes named are taken in their entirety from that book; but the embodiment of the leading principles, and the similarity in the quantities of materials used, warrants this acknowledgment, which is grate- fully tendered.

Sweet Puddings. 139 washed rice in a third of a pint of milk (double pan) for an hour and a half; when cool, add an ounce of chopped suet, the same of white sugar, a dessert-spoonful of brandy or rum, and a beaten egg. Beat well; then steam the pud- ding for an hour; or make one double the size and cook longer, as it can be re-heated. Cinna- mon is a suitable flavouring. Sago or Tapioca.

The same mixture can be baked in deep tin plates. The measure

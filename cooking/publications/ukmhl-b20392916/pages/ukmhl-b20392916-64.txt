56 Broths, Soups, Meat Essences and Jellies, etc. Vermicelli Jelly or Soup.â€”Very strongly recommended. This is taken hot as soup, or cold or tepid as a jelly; it differs from meat jellies in taste and appearance, and the vermicelli is easily digested. First the meat: take a pound, either beef and mutton, or these two meats with veal; or veal and mutton : the meat should be lean and some of it gelatinous. The neck of veal is very good; an ounce each of isinglass (Swinborne's) and vermicelli, three pints of cold water, and a little seasoning make up the total. The meat should be cut small and soaked in the water in advance, then add the rest and bring to the boil; simmer for four to five hours, water bath, or double-pan method. Pass through a strainer or coarse sieve; let all go through but the meat. Skim if needed when it begins to simmer, and during the cooking break up the meat, &c, now and then with a wooden spoon, as there is a tendency to clot in a lump, which prevents the full amount of the meat juices being extracted. It should be simmered down to less than a quart. Wine or brandy may be added after straining. If to be served cold, pour into shallow vessels (earthen) and set in a cold place. For hot service, pour into a basin, and remove any fat there may be at the time of re-heating. In most cases, half these quantities will be enough to prepare at one time.

Veal Cream Quenelles. â€” Take half a pound of lean veal of the best and freshest, the fillet for choice; free it from skin and fat, and pass twice through a mincing machine; then cook together half an ounce each of flour and butter, and half a gill of stock and cream mixed, until thick. Let this cool. Then put the meat in a mortar and pound it first alone, then with an egg, and the panada added a little at a time. It is improved by sieving. To cook, shape with two dessert spoons dipped in hot water, and slip the quenelles into boiling veal stock from bones; the pan should be shallow, and the stock only just cover the quenelles; reduce to simmering point at once, and cook at that temperature for twenty minutes. A buttered paper should be laid over the quenelles. Coat with white sauce. Serve on a border of potatoes or on toast, or with macaroni, or as the case requires. Salt, pepper, and nutmeg are generally approved seasonings, but a grate of lemon peel or morsel of parsley may be added.

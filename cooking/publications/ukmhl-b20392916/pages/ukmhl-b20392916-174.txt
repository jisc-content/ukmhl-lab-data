Brandy Milk.—A very old-fashioned and nourishing beverage. Whisky can replace the brandy. Heat half a pint of new milk slowly, put in a pinch of salt unless forbidden, a tea- spoonful of white sugar, or a lump or two, and the yolk of a fresh egg beaten up with two table- spoonfuls of good brandy; stir over the fire until as hot as possible without boiling and quite smooth, then serve with rusks or toast or bis- cuits.

Take a couple of large sound lemons, and rasp the yellow part of the rind of one on a couple of ounces of lump sugar ; then crush it; remove the yellow rind of the other and put by for future use ; now bake the lemons in a slow oven until very soft, turning them often ; scoop out all the pulp and juice into a vessel con- taining the sugar ; be sure that no pips or white skin get in. Dissolve the sugar and mix all up with a spoonful or two of honey to taste, but the acid should be pronounced. When cold, cover, and take a teaspoonful when the cough is trouble- some. Good for hoarseness, common in some illnesses. Note.—By using less honey, and adding a little pure glycerine, a mixture more agreeable to many is obtained. Lemonade.—Two lemons, a pint of boiling water, and from one to two ounces of lump sugar will make a good lemonade. The fruit should be juicy and rolled on a board, that the juice will yield better; wipe and dry it with a clean cloth, then peel very thinly. The rind should be yellow on both sides, and anything short of this will make the drink bitter. Put the rind in a jug with the sugar and strain the juice over it; pour the water over, stir with a wooden spoon, then cover with a clean cloth, stuffing it well into the neck of the jug ; set by to get cold.

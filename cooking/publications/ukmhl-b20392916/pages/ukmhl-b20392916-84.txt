Set it into a saucepan, with enough fast boiling water to come halfway up the jar, over which a sheet of buttered paper should be laid ; cover, and keep the water boil- ing until the asparagus is done, which will be from forty to fifty minutes according to size. Any liquid from the jar should be put in the sauce served with it; but it is excellent with nothing more than a squeeze of lemon juice and a little hot cream. In this way there will be loss of colour, but gain in flavour and nutriment.

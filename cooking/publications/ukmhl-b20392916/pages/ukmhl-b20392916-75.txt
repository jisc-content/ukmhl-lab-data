Fish Dishes. 67 weight of cold cooked fish, minus skin and bone, and flaked and cut small, and nicely boiled rice, which can be warm or cold ; add, supposing a couple of ounces of each, either a dessertspoonful of cream or a morsel of fresh butter and season- ing, such as pepper and salt and a dust of nut- meg, lemon, or mace, or chopped parsley; stir until hot, then beat in the yolk of an egg, and as soon as hot through, serve in a dainty little pile. If liked softer, add more cream or some milk, then half the yolk of an egg will suffice for this quantity. Some little garnish, such as parsley or a slice or two of lemon, should be added. This differs from ordinary " kedgeree " in being more nourishing, less seasoned, and containing no hard-boiled eggs. If allowed, a few drops of anchovy essence will improve it. Lemon Stew.â€”Take a moderate-sized whit- ing, clean and bone it, then cut it in three or four parts, and put in a stewpan with a mixture of milk and water to barely cover it. Add a little seasoning of salt and pepper; lay on the top of the fish three or four thin slices cut from middle of a good sound lemon ; stew as slowly as possible, as the fish must be well done but not the least raggy. Take it up and remove the lemon; serve with the liquor, or part of it, poured round. This is a tasty and digestible snack. Where milk disagrees, a mild fish stock can replace it, and the dish still be a very good imitation of the real thing.

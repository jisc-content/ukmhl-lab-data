48 Broths, Soups, Meat Essences and Jellies, etc. should be added, and a slice of onion or other vegetable for flavouring; now add a pint of milk and finish the cooking ; pass through a sieve and season with a little salt and pepper, and add a spoonful of cream to each half pint of soup. Half the quantity should be made in warm weather. Note.—Where milk disagrees, a good soup can be made by using all stock, and after sieving, the soup may be thickened with a little arrow- root or rice flour, and reboiled for a sufficient time. Meat Jelly.—This is very strong, and in- tended for patients who require small and frequent doses of nourishment; for instance, a teaspoonful will contain the nutriment of a small cup of ordinary beef tea. The meat must be of the freshest and best. Take half a pound each of beef and veal, and cut very small on a plate, so that no juice is lost. The best part of the neck of the veal is very suitable. Put in a clean jar with a tablespoonful or two of stock from veal bones or water, and a tiny pinch of salt unless forbidden. Cover with a lid, then tie a cloth over ; set the jar in hot water three parts of the way up, and let the water boil steadily and unceasingly for six or seven hours. A rapid boil one minute and cessation the next is useless. Strain the liquid and serve hot, tepid, or cold as required. Keep in a cold place. Press the meat thoroughly when straining. Prepare in a jar

132 Sweet Puddings. be put in the pudding and the rest used for the garnish ; or for a plainer pudding it may all be incorporated. Orange rind and juice can be used, but rather less sugar is required, and a few drops of lemon juice improve the orange flavour. Light Cup Puddings.—Sift an ounce of fine flour. Put half a gill of milk (or milk and water will make lighter though less nourishing) to boil with an ounce of butter; when it boils up well put the flour in and stir over the fire, reducing the heat by moving the saucepan until the flour is cooked, and leaves the sides of the pan. Take from the fire and add an egg, beat it in thoroughly for several minutes. Half fill some cup moulds buttered, and bake in a quick oven from fifteen to twenty minutes according to size and heat of the oven. Serve at once, as they soon fall, with sugar or a simple sauce, or fruit syrup warmed and sweetened is delicious. Note.—These are a nice change from milk puddings. They depend for their excellence on the cooking of the panada and the baking. Macaroni Pudding.—A pint of milk should be brought to simmering point, and a couple of ounces of macaroni, broken small, dropped in and boiled softly until nearly done, about thirty to forty minutes; some kinds may take an hour. Sweeten to taste; about an ounce of sugar is enough as a rule, and when cool beat in the yolk of an egg ; pour into a dish, dust over with a little ground nutmeg or cinnamon, and bake in a very slow oven for twenty minutes.

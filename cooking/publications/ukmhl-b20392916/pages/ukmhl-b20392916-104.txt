Sweetbread Stewed in Milk.—Trim and prepare a sweetbread by blanching. See Sweet- breads. Put in a small stewpan a few strips of carrot and celery, with a slice of onion, a morsel of salt, and a few peppercorns or allspice berries; lay a buttered paper over the sweetbread, after placing it on the bed of vegetables ; simmer, with frequent basting with the liquor, which should be half milk and half white stock, or two-thirds milk, as liked. It will take nearly an hour; small ones less in proportion. When done, take up the sweetbread and keep it hot over water or in the oven, then strain the liquid, and use it for making the sauce. Where bacon is allowed, a little may be cooked and served with this, the sauce round, and the bacon, and a slice or two of lemon by way of garnish. Toast Sandwiches.—Prepare two slices of French toast—the bread should be cut thinly, and toasted on one side only; then spread the prepara- tion on the two untoasted sides of the bread, press together, cut daintily and serve while warm.

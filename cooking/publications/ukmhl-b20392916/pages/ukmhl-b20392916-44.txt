INVALIDS want the nourishment which is necessary to bring them back to health, in a particularly acceptable form. The appetite is natu- rally capricious, but BOVfilL is always relished and retained when other foods arc rejected. It soothes and satis- fies, and leads the way to speedy convalescence and rapid recovery. BOVRIL LIMITED, Food Specialists, LONDON. CHAIRMAN : The Right Hon. LORD PLAYFAIR, G.C.B., LL D.

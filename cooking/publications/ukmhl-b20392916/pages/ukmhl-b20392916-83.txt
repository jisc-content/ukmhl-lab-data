CHAPTER IV. Fowls, Drawing and Trussing.—Direc- tions are not given herein for these operations, as any good cookery-book will supply the in- formation. The fact that washing is required may be enforced, for indifferently cleansed poul- try will prove anything but appetising, and the common habit of buying birds that have been kept for some days after killing, undrawn, should not be entertained. Use a trussing needle and string in preference to skewers; and do not break the breastbone; it spoils the bird for neat carving. Tasty Sauce for Game.—Take a teaspoon- ful of chopped shallot, and fry it a pale brown in a little butter or olive oil; add a teaspoonful of lemon juice, a pinch of salt, pepper, and nut- meg, a teaspoonful of dissolved red or black currant jelly and the pulp of a small tomato ; put in a small teacupful or so of stock, or soup (clear), or gravy from game or poultry bones, and simmer a little, then sieve and serve hot. May be thickened if liked. A very good sauce in which to re-heat game, or a bit of fowl, may acquire fresh flavour so treated.

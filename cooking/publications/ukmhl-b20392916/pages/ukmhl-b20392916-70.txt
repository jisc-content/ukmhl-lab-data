Fish Dishes. 62 Indeed, it is considered to have the savour of fried fish without any of its indigestibility. The first thing is to have the fish dry and fresh ; if a whiting or small fresh haddock, gash it in a few places each side in a slanting direction, and season with pepper, salt, and lemon juice. The gridiron should be dry and clean, well heated, and rubbed with a morsel of butter without salt or pure salad oil. The fish must cook carefully so as not to scorch, and should be turned once or twice, and care against smoking must be taken. It should be crisp when done and a delicate brown, and served very hot. A little cold butter is a good addition, or maitre d'hotel butter. If broiled, a hanging broiler must be used, or a Dutch oven, according to one's resources ; the principles are the same. A flat fish or a slice can be cooked in these ways. From the first-named fish the skin is generally removed. They may be split right open instead of being gashed, if preferred; and in the case of haddock the entire fish may be brushed over with oil or warm butter as a further precaution against dryness. Note.—The cooking from start to finish should be quicker for a thin than for thick fish. A gas grill enables one to cook fish very nicely, if it is allowed to become quite hot before the fish is put under—a very important point. Eel Broth.—Allow half a pound of the fish, after cleaning and skining, to two to three pints

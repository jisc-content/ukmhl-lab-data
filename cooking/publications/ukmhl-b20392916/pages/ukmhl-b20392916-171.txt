« CHAPTER VIII. Drinks, to keep Cool.—Wrap a cloth round the jug containing the drink, and keep the cloth wet by wringing it out of cold water from time to time. Another way is to use a shallow vessel for the reception of the beverage, say a basin; cover this and set it in a vessel containing cold water, with a handful of common salt to the quart or thereabouts. The water is made colder if a little saltpetre be added. When wanted very cold, put a small quantity of the drink in a vessel, such as a teacup, and set that in a mixture of broken ice (quite small) and pounded salt, two parts of the former to one part of the latter; cover to exclude the air, and keep in a cold place; it will soon be ready for use. This is a good mode when something very cold is wanted in a hurry. Milk, Simple Test for.—Take a steel knife and dip the blade into cold water, then dry it and dip it in the milk, holding it upright; if the milk be pure and rich there will be a film, thick and creamy, on the knife as it is withdrawn; on the contrary, watered milk will run off the knife.

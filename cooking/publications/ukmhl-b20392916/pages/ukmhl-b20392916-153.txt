When the " opaque" packet gelatine is used, the quantity is usually stated on the packets, and directions must be followed, as gelatine varies greatly in strength. Swinborne's Gelatine (which requires soaking) will befound satisfactory. Isinglass.—This also varies in strength, and trial should be made of any reliable kind bearing the maker's name, and that brand kept to, otherwise a dish is very apt to turn out differently from what is intended. A very low- priced article will not be satisfactory. The goods of leading English makers are reliable. Isin- glass dissolves quickly, and in addition to its uses in the concoction of jellies and creams, it is often added to tea or coffee, to give a little body. In the recipes, the best brands have been kept in mind, i.e. " an ounce for a quart of liquid ;" but it may happen that an ounce and a half will have to be used for this quantity. For the recipes in this work Swinborne's isinglass was used ; and it is but fair to say that it can be relied upon for strength and purity;

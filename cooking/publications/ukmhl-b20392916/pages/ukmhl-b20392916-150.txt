142 Sweet Puddings. is made by melting a spoonful of apple jelly, to which wine can be added. Tapioca Pudding.—This is simple and good. Wash an ounce of tapioca and soak it in three quarters of a pint of milk for an hour or two if convenient. Cook in a double pan till quite tender and the milk absorbed, then add a little castor sugar and flavouring to taste, beat in the yolk of an egg, and then the white beaten to a froth; bake in a shallow dish, not quite filled, in a gentle oven till firm and a pale brown. This is excellent if the sugar be omitted and some fruit jelly melted and served with it, or a little stewed fruit. Sago pudding can be made in the same way. For rice pudding, use a pint of milk. Vermicelli Pudding.—A pint of milk and an ounce of vermicelli should be put into a saucepan and brought to the boil, then simmered for an hour and sweetened to taste; any ap- proved flavouring can be added. Beat in an egg, or the yolk only, with half an ounce of butter, or a little cream, and serve hot. This is a nice "hasty" pudding. The sugar can be omitted and honey added, or warmed jam served with it. Turn on to a hot plate. A hollow can be made in the centre, and a lump of butter and some white sugar put in. Many can digest butter in this form, who cannot eat a pudding in which it has been baked. The pudding can be baked until brown (after cooling as above), the butter being added or omitted as preferred.

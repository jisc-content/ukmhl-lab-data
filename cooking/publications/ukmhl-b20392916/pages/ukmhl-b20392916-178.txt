170 Beverages: Hot and Cold. lemon juice is put in and the wine reduced a little. Egg Wine.—Madeira or sherry may be used ; an egg is first beaten up, and a glass of the wine added with a lump or two of sugar; a gill or rather more boiling water is next in order, the mixture being beaten during its gradual addi- tion ; it may be put in a saucepan and heated together, but great care is- needed to avoid curd- ling ; serve very hot. Groat Gruel.—Take a good teacupful of groats (whole oats) and put them in a jar with eight times the measure of cold water. Cover and cook in a gentle oven until the mixture is creamy; it may take nearly three hours, then strain care- fully, getting all that will pass through the sieve or strainer, leaving the groats behind. Strain while hot. This will keep in a cold place for a few days in cool weather. Sugar or salt can be added as liked. When used, take about equal parts of the gruel and new milk, and stir together over the fire until the boil is reached, then let it simmer, stirring well for ten minutes. More milk will be liked by some, and in certain cases cream may be added; anyhow, with proper care, a very smooth, palatable, and highly nutritious gruel is the result, and it is a great advantage to be able to prepare enough for several days' consump- tion. Another way is to cook in a double boiler instead of the oven; where whole groats are not to be had, " pin-head" oatmeal can be used.

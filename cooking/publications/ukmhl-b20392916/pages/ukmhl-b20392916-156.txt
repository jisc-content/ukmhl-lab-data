If not clear, pass through again; use no pressure and keep in a warm place. Should it set before all is through, put a jug of hot water in the middle of the jelly.

The amount of wine or lemon juice can be altered to suit taste, also the sugar. Brandy or good Madeira, if ordered to replace the sherry, can be put in after straining.

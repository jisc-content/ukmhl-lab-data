154 Creams and Jellies—Bread and CakeS. two ounces of lump sugar, the thin rind of a small lemon with the strained juice, half an ounce of isinglass, or twice the weight of sheet gelatine, and half a pint of cold water; cover, set in a warm place for a time, then bring to the boil, stirring, and simmer for a quarter of an hour. See that the isinglass is quite dissolved; scald a clean cloth or coarse muslin, and pour the liquid through into a basin ; add half a pint of good port, and mould when it begins to cool; or make it softer, using two-thirds the amount of isinglass, and pour into a shallow glass dish. Note.—Some wines take more sugar than others. A clove or two or morsel of stick cinna- mon is much liked by some; a teaspoonful of red currant jelly improves colour and flavour. If a stronger jelly is wanted, alter the proportions of wine and water. A common, thick, dark wine is not suitable. It may be made without any acid should the case require it; and a little pale brandy would, for some, be an improvement. Tapioca Fruit Jelly, with Cream.—Wash two ounces of the best tapioca, and then pour over a pint of cold water; cook after an hour's soaking, in a double pan, for nearly or quite two hours ; it should be thick and clear; when three parts done add a tablespoonful of black or red currant jelly; other kinds may be used in the same way. Turn into a damp earthen mould or pie-dish, and turn out when set. Pour a little cream over or round, or hand it with the jelly;

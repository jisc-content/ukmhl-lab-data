Broths, Soup, Meat Essences and Jellies, etc. 49 that just holds the meat. All these items con- tribute to the success of the jelly. For other hints, see Beef Essence. Meat and Arrowroot Jelly.—Sometimes relished when beef tea and similar fare has become nauseous. Make a cup of water arrow- root, thicker than usual, then flavour with Bovril, first dissolved in a little boiling water; may be taken hot or cold. A beaten egg improves it. See Arrowroot. Meat Tea, Very Good.—Take half a pound each of fresh lean veal and beef; mince, and add a pinch of salt, half a pound of chopped veal bones, a slice or two of onion with a clove; half a dozen allspice berries, a few peppercorns, and a quart of cold water; cover the jar, and cook in a moderate oven for four to five hours. Strain, and remove any fat when cold, then re- heat as required. This is very good with a little wine, and any thickening can be added to taste. Mutton Bone Jelly.—Take four shank bones of mutton, and crack them, after thorough clean- ing ; add a little seasoning and put them on with a quart of cold water; let them simmer for eight to ten hours, then strain, and flavour with a little meat extract, or wine, or whatever suits the case. May be served warm as a soup, or cold as a jelly. A little brown colouring im- proves the appearance—a hint that may be borne in mind at all times, in the case of colourless dishes. Lemon juice is a good flavourer.

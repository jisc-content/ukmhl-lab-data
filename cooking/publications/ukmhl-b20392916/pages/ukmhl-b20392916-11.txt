/ PREFACE. In writing this little work for the use of those who have to cater for the sick and convalescent, I have aimed at giving something for all, so far as the limits of the book allow. Digestibility, coupled with variety, may be said to give the keynote to the whole ; and a very special effort has been made to avoid the slightest violation of the principles laid down. Most medical men are agreed that "kitchen physic" plays no mean part in the treatment of the patient; one goes so far as to say that " in the past the doctor has had a strong ally in the cook for producing patients as well as curing them." This at least is certainâ€”that the efforts and medicine of the most skilful physician are nullified, practically, if the cooking be at fault. The doctor and the cook must work together if good results are to follow any treatment.

Creams and Jellies—Bread and Cakes. 157 fine white flour, the same weight of brown flour, the finest, half a teaspoonful of Cerebos baking powder, half as much Cerebos salt, two ounces of butter, an egg, and some milk and water. The flours are to be sifted with the salt, and the butter rubbed in until fine as sand; beat the eggs with a gill of milk and water mixed in equal parts, and proceed to mix all to a soft paste, adding a little more water as required.

To gloss the bread, leave out a little of the egg and mix with milk, and brush over before baking; a richer gloss is given by using egg alone a few minutes before the rolls are taken from the oven. The same recipe, minus the butter, will make a bread acceptable to many, and if wanted sweet, add an ounce or more fine white sugar, reducing the salt to a pinch.

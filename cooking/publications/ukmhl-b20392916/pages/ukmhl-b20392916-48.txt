40 Broths, Soups, Meat Essences and Jellies, etc. found cheaper, and far more nutritious as well as palatable, than many patent preparations costing a couple of shillings for the same quantity. Note.—Mutton may be used similarly; a cut from the lean part of the leg, or the under-meat of the loin can be used; mutton and beef mixed are sometimes liked. Beef Tea.—Those best able to judge declare that many doctors have ceased to attach any importance to the value of beef tea, and that this is greatly due to the difficulty of getting it made as it should be. The rules for attaining success are few and simple, but they must be followed, for the principles that underlie the operation have almost all to do with the excellence or otherwise of the tea. That is, however much the proportions of meat and water may vary to suit particular cases, one should be quite clear as to the best ways of drawing out the nutritive properties of the meat. 1. Juicy meat is needed; it may be cut high up the leg, or the hip bone or rump or shoulder will furnish good meat. Shin of beef, or other parts that yield a good deal of gelatine, so that the tea forms a jelly when cold, is not the part to select. 2. All skin, fat, and gristle must be taken away, and the meat must be shredded, or cut very small, either by hand or passed through a mincing machine.

Spread over buttered toast and serve hot. Another Way.—Omit the egg; spread the fish mixture on the toast and serve a lightly poached egg on the top. A soupcon of anchovy essence improves. Other white fish can be used in this way. A mixture of oyster liquor and cream is good for moistening, and the savour may be increased in many ways.

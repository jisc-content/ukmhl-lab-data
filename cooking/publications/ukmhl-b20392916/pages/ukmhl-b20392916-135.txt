Sweet Puddings. 127 two eggs with three ounces or less of sugar. Stir this well into the Corn Flour. Bake for half an hour in an oven, or brown before the fire. Cream Pudding Sauce.—This is very de- licious. Those on cream diet will be allowed to take such a sauce, although a thickened one of the flour and butter variety might be denied. Take a teacup, put in a teaspoonful of castor sugar, a tablespoonful or two of milk, and nearly fill it with cream ; beat together, then set in boiling water over the fire, and stir till it thickens, when it is ready. Just before serving add a tablespoonful, or less, of brandy, or any good wine ; or flavour with spice, or orange or lemon, by infusing the rind in the milk for some time; a bay leaf or other fiavourer common to custards is suitable. By omitting sugar, and adding any approved savoury flavouring, the sauce is excel- lent with white fish, or sweetbread or poultry. Cup Custard, Steamed.—Take a gill and a half of new milk and two eggs, first beaten ; beat all for a few minutes, then strain. Pour into two little buttered cups or moulds, and steam with boiling water about a third the way up the moulds. After the first boil up the water should just simmer, or the custards will be spongy instead of smooth. Buttered paper should be twisted round; a quarter of an hour to twenty minutes will cook them. Any flavouring can be added. Serve hot or cold, with sugar or fruit syrup, &c. Very delicate when properly cooked.

Sweet Puddings. 137 named alone. Draw off the juice as if for making jelly, then, to half a pint add an ounce of well- washed fine sago, and cook the two together in an earthen vessel, until the sago is lost to sight; add sugar to taste, and pour into a china mould; turn out when set. It can be made softer by using three quarters of a pint of fruit juice to the ounce of sago, and poured into a dish to set. Very refreshing. Cream can be eaten with it, though it is nice plain. Arrowroot, corn flour, rice-flour, and other articles will serve as the thickening medium, and cook quickly. Rice Pudding.â€”Wash two ounces of the best Carolina rice in several waters, put it in a pie-dish, either buttered a little or rinsed out with cold water, and add a pint of rich milk and a pinch of salt, with an ounce of powdered loaf sugar, or brown sugar if it agrees, or honey. Bake in a very slow oven for two and a half to three hours. Or use an ounce and a half only of rice, and allow four hours. The addition of grated nutmeg must be left to taste. Ground cinnamon is a suitable flavouring in bowel com- plaint, and in many cases no sugar is allowed. In cold weather the rice may soak in the milk a few hours before baking, and is much improved. A pudding of this sort cannot be baked too slowly. A spoonful or two of cream can be added for a better pudding; and for variety the sweetening may be omitted and serve with a little stewed fruit, or warm jam or fruit jelly.

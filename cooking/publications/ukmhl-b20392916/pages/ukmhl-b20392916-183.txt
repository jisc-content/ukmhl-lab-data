Beverages: Hot and Cold. 175 is welcome as a rule; taken hot, milk is a restorative, and one of the best " nightcaps " in many cases; whisky is often ordered by the medical profession as an adjunct. Baked milk agrees with many better than boiled or scalded, and, as with many foods, it acquires a different flavour from long, slow cooking, in a cool oven. It must be ever remembered that milk is a food and not a thirst quencher; to give a thirsty, feverish patient a drink of milk as a refresher is a mistake, as milk may be set down as " a perfect food in a liquid form." Oatmeal Gruel.â€”Use fine or medium oat- meal ; the former is the more generally used, and allow an ounce or so to the pint of water. Mix the meal to a smooth paste with cold water, boil the rest of a pint, and add it, return to the sauce- pan, and cook for thirty to forty minutes. An hour is still better. Stir often unless a double pan be used. Add a little sugar towards the end, as there is then less tendency to "catch." A pinch of salt should be added. Strain if the least lumpy, but with care, and in a clean pan it should not happen. Avoid smoke and burn- ing ; the least trace of either will produce loath- ing for food of the same class; besides, burnt food often brings on vomiting, and should never be given. Lemon juice is a nice flavourer, also nutmeg, unless there is throat irritation ; wine or spirit, if added by doctor's order, should be put in after boiling. Serve very hot. Water

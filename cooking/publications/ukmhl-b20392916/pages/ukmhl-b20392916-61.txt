The yolks of two eggs are then to be beaten up well, with about a wine glass full of cream, and the hot soup added gradually, beating well; add salt and a little pepper to taste, and return to the saucepan to heat, but not boil, or it will curdle. If allowed, a few drops of lemon juice will improve the flavour. In re-heating this, it is best to set the cup or basin in a vessel of boiling water until the desired temperature is reached. Where eggs disagree they must be omitted, then a little more sago and cream may be used with advantage. Mace gives a good flavour. See Mace. Sorrel Soup, Simple.â€”Take a large hand- ful of picked and washed sorrel, and put it in a stewpan, with an ounce of butter, and a good pinch of salt and castor sugar; cover, and allow it to cook, shaking often, for a quarter of an hour to twenty minutes; add nearly a pint of rabbit or chicken or veal broth, or stock, and finish the cooking ; allow nearly forty minutes. Season pleasantly, then pour the boiling soup over the yolk of an egg and a tablespoonful of cream beaten together in the tureen; stir well and briskly before serving. Serve with toast. It is an improvement to sieve the soup, and reboil, before pouring over the egg and cream. Those who dislike the adjuncts named may thicken the soup with a little rice or corn flour.

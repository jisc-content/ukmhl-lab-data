20 General Rules for Invalid Cookery. Brandy.—Whether for use in a critical illness or for convalescence it should be good, old, pale. One medical man goes so far as to say that it ought to cost at least six or seven shillings a bottle, and that it may be true economy to pay even ten shillings. It should be looked upon in the light of a medicine and not a beverage. Whisky needs proper selection, and it agrees with many better than any other spirit; at the same time it should not be substituted for any other unless the doctor agrees; some of the stuff sold as whisky is hurtful in the highest degree; age is the thing to aim at. Port is often both fortified and plastered. " Unfortified," and specially light for invalids, can be got, if one goes to the right people. It is a common error that only dark wine is good; on the contrary, some of the choicest brands are pale and clear comparatively. Champagne.—This is often ordered where sickness prevails. Any special brand recom- mended should be got; it must be of good quality and drawn off by means of a champagne tap; this allows small quantities to be taken from the bottle without deterioration of the remainder. Cream is sometimes ordered to be mixed with the wine, in which case the cream should be put in the glass first, and the wine added and taken while effervescing.

Sweet Puddings. 141 as soon as the boil is reached; finish as before; steam until firm enough to turn out. Souffle, Steamed.â€”Take half an ounce of fresh butter, full weight; melt it in a small sauce- pan, then add half an ounce of fine flour sifted, scant weight, and stir together; when smooth put in a quarter of a pint of milk, or half milk and half water, and stir to the boil; go on stirring till thick, but over a steady heat, or so small a quantity wastes. It will leave the sides of the pan and cling to the spoon when done enough. Take from the fire, and beat in a very little sugar, about half a teaspoonful. Then add a saltspoonful of grated orange or lemon rind, or a few drops of essence of nutmeg or vanilla, or as liked. Then beat in the yolks of two eggs, one at a time, very thoroughly; small ones will do. Now beat the whites, with a pinch of salt, as stiffly as possible, and fold in lightly. The basin, or plain mould, should be greased ready and half filled with the mixture; tie a piece of white paper round and set in a stewpan of boiling water half way up the mould; cover, and keep it just on the simmer for about twenty to thirty minutes; let it stand a minute, then turn out carefully on a warm dish; dredge with sugar and serve at once. The sugar is omitted in the souffle sometimes, also the flavouring, then sauce, jam, fruit, or sugar goes to table with it. Any left over can be re-heated, though it will not have the lightness of the original. A delicious sauce K

138 Sweet Puddings. Note.—Coarse oatmeal, crushed wheat, tapioca, sago, and other cereals can be used in this way. Whenever the oven seems a trifle too hot (and it is important that it be slow at the first stage of the cooking) open the door a little, or set the pudding dish in a vessel of water.

Rusk Pudding.—Take some plain rusks called " tops and bottoms," or the finger rusks, but if the latter, be careful to add less sugar to the mixture. Break them up, and to a teacupful add a tablespoonful of sherry or brandy, and let them soak a while; beat an egg up with a little sugar and flavouring, such as nutmeg, or grated lemon or orange rind ; heat a gill of milk to nearly boiling point and add to the egg, beating hard; then pour the mixture over the rusks, and mix thoroughly. Pour into a slightly buttered dish and drop into the centre a dessertspoonful or so of any stoneless jam, then bake in a very moderate oven for about half an hour, depend- ing on the depth of the dish. Nice hot or cold. Note.—The wine and jam will make it sweet enough for many without sugar. It affords a very pleasant variety for convalescents. Another way.—Omit the jam, and serve with a little warm fruit or any fruit jelly. Where fruit is allowed some stoned sultana raisins can be mixed with the rusks and jam omitted.

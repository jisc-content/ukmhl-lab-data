• 122 Sweet Puddings. be added to the pulp, and other flavourings, as lemon or orange or vanilla, will give variety. Another way.—Omit the sugar and serve a little melted apple jelly with the pudding : this makes a pleasant change. Apples Baked.—Wipe some thin-skinned apples of equal size and stamp out the cores without paring them; put them on an earthen dish with moist or white sugar to fill the cavi- ties left by coring; to half a dozen apples add the strained juice of a lemon or orange; bake in a steady oven till quite soft, then serve with the syrup. The skins are not to be eaten, but cooked thus the fruit retains its flavour. Water can replace the lemon juice if more agreeable, and a little spice of any sort put in with the sugar. Arrowroot Souffle.—A level tablespoonful of sifted arrowroot is first to be mixed with a little cold milk to a smooth paste ; if lumpy it is very objectionable, hence the reason for sieving; boil half a pint of rich milk (a tablespoonful of cream improves) and add to the paste, then boil the whole for a couple of minutes, stirring all the time; beat in the yolks of two eggs singly, off the fire, with a little sugar and flavouring, but the less sugar used the better the souffle rises. Beat the whites of the eggs stiffly, and add to the mixture. Pour into a buttered dish and bake ten to fifteen minutes moderately; the top should be a dainty brown. Serve at once, as it soon falls. See remarks under Arrowroot.

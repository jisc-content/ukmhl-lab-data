As to quantity, it will be found that forty grains will equal a pound of loaf sugar. For the sweetening of rice and other puddings of a starchy nature, simply dissolve the saccharin in the milk in the ordinary way. It can, of course, be used for gruels and porridges, milk, and all sorts of food. It is very necessary to see that it is properly distributed, or one portion of the food will be unpleasantly sweet; and too liberal a use of it must be guarded against, because the intense sweetness, if too much be used, will create thirst.

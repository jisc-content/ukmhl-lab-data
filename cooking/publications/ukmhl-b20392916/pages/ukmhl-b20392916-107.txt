Savoury Dishes. 99 Veal Cutlets, Baked.—A delicious dish, but requires care, or the meat will be hard and dry. The details must be observed. Take a slice of veal from the leg, bat it out and cut in nice pieces, rounds or oblongs, for serving. No skin or fat must be left on. Dip the meat in stock, any plain white kind, to moisten it. Butter a shallow baking dish, and put the meat in in a single layer; sprinkle with a little mace and white pepper mixed together, no salt; pour enough warm milk over to quite cover the meat, then lay a thick white paper over, buttered on the outside, and cover with an old dish or plate. Set the dish in a tin with a little warm water in it, and bake in a slow oven until the meat is tender. Allow nearly two hours. The milk and water in the tin may want adding to. Thicken the milk with a little arrowroot or corn flour, boil up and pour over the meat and serve hot. A little salt should be added near the end of the cooking, and if the patient may take it, lemon rind or parsley may be used for the sake of flavouring, or a morsel of onion gives savour. Prepare a small quantity at a time only, espe- cially in warm weather. See Re-heating of Food.

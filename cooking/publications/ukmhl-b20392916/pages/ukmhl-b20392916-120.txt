Drain it well and put it in a clean saucepan with enough hot cream and white stock mixed to cover it. Season delicately with salt and pepper and a hint of ground mace or nutmeg. This is the simple foundation on which many changes can be rung. For example: a spoonful of cooked and chopped chicken and ham may be stirred in, or a little cold fish ; a small spoonful of extract of meat gives another relish. It is nice as it is, or on toast, and any daintily cooked vegetable goes well with it. The yolk of a beaten egg and a little white sauce made with half cream and half milk may be thickened together and added to the vermicelli, with any approved flavouring for a very nourishing dish. Another way.—Turn out the mixture for serv- ing, and spread over it the yolk of a very lightly boiled or poached egg. This improves the appearance and adds to the nutriment. Vermicelli Pudding, Savoury.—Dissolve a small teaspoonful of Bovril (" invalid brand " if seasoning is forbidden) in half a pint of boiling water, drop in some vermicelli until the mixture is as thick as good cream, about a dessert spoon- ful, then simmer for ten minutes. When cool, beat in the yolk of an egg and brown in a shallow dish in a slow oven, allowing ten minutes.

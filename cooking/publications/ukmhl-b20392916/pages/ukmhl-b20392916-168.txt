Have ready some small sponge cake tins, buttered, with clarified butter, then dredged with flour and sugar in equal parts, all that does not adhere being shaken out; they must be but little more than half filled; bake in a moderate oven fifteen minutes; they should be firm to the touch and light brown. Any flavour- ing maybe added; grated lemon rind or a pinch of grated ginger. If one large cake, line the tin with buttered paper after treating as above. For a more substantial and sweeter cake, use three ounces each of flour and sugar to two eggs.

It is useful to serve with stewed fruit, to take the place of a pudding.

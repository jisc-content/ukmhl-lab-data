Rump of Beef in Jelly. Culotte de Bceuf a la Gelee oil a la Royale. Take a rump or part of its bone, and lard it with gre&t lard, as in the foregoing article; season it in the same manner; wrap and tie it in a cloth ; put it in a braising pot, after it has been dressed with the bones, five or six carrots, four onions, two cloves of garlic, a bunch of parsley and young onions, two bay-leaves, a knuckle of veal, a glass of white wine, the necessary salt, and two or three ladlcfuls of bouillon; make it boil upon a good fire; cover it with three covers of buttered white paper; let it boil upon a brisk fire ; cover it and let it cook slowly, with fire under and over it nearly four hours; when enough done, take it off; let it cool in the cloth ; run the juice through a cloth which must be previously wetted, that the fat may not go through; let it cool ; beat with a fork two whites of eggs with a little water ; put it into the juice still warm; shake it; put it upon the fire till it is near boiling; take it off, and lay over it some hot cinders; leave it a quarter of an hour ; when the sauce becomes limpid, run it through a wet cloth : let it cool, to know if too thick or too thin ; if it should happen to be too thick, put in a little bouillon; if too thin, put it again upon the fire, adding a knuckle of veal; and clarify as before.

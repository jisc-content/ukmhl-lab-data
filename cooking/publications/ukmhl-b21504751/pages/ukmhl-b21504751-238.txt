220 FRENCH COOKERY make this pate, pass a quarter of flour through a search; separate a fourth*; make two holes in the flour, the least to put the yeast in ; heat some water more than milk warm, take care that it is not too hot; mix the yeast with the hot water, and when there are no more knots, mix the flour into it; work and gather the whole into a mass; shake a little flour on the board, and form the paste as a baker forms a loaf; slash the paste lightly across; dry the vessel in which die water was warmed, strew it with flour, and put in leaven; cover it with a cloth, and put it in a warm place ; while it is rising, put into the large fountain the salt melted in water; break the eggs in a dish, take care they are fresh, add and mix them well with the butter and a little sugar; mix all well with the flour, beat it with the hands; if the leaven is risen, which is easily known by the cross being enlarged, it will be like lace; pour it on the paste, and break it with the hands, always putting upon the paste what is broken; do it lightly again; let the leaven be well incorporated, gather it together, and put a cloth in a dish; strew it with flour, and put in the paste, folding it tight; leave it to rise four or five hours in summer, and seven or eight in winter; if the paste be spoilt, it will form eyes, and become tough, which may be known by pressing it with the hand; if it resists, then it is properly made; keep it in a cool place for use. Paste Pate dâ€™echaudds. Take a quarter of a bushel of fine flour; put it through a search, make a hole in the middle, put in two ounces of salt with a little water ; break into a dish twenty or twenty-two eggs, put them to the salt and water, and add a pound of butter; the paste ought to have a good body, and it is not necessary that it should be very fine ; work the eggs into the flour by little and little, till it is gotten into a mass; cut it in pieces, and throw it with force upon the table; draw it near, turn it over with the points of the fingers, give * That is the fourth part that has been separated.

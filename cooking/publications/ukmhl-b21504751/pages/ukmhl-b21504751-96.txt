78 FRENCH COOKERY. MUTTON. The best mutton is that which has the deepest colour, and the finest white, the leg short and thick : the male is preferable: it is in season during ten months, as it is apt to taste of the wool for some weeks after it is shorn.* The hind part of Mutton roasted. Rot-de-Bif de Mouton a la Broche. Take a saddle of mutton, with the haunches ; break the bones, beat them several times with the blade of a hatchet; put one of the knuckles through the other, break the ribs, and roll the flank under, and skewer them into a good form ; take some of the kidney fat out; put a small skewer into the back marrow ; spit it, and secure the knuckles well together; put a skewer through the noix, or thick part of the legs, and another between, that it may be well secured, so that it may not turn upon the spit; cover the whole with buttered paper; it will take to cook from an hour and half to two hours, which depends upon the strength of the fire, and the size of the piece ; serve it with juice under or upon (haricots a la bretonne). Braised leg of Mutton. Gigot Braise, ou a la Braise. Take a good leg of mutton, take out all the bones but the shank, lard it with great lard, well seasoned with fine spices, salt, basil in powder, pepper, parsley, and small onions, minced ; tie it up in its own form; marque a pot with some parings of butchersâ€™ meat, five or six onions, and as many carrots; put the mutton over it, moisten with good broth, and half a glass of brandy, two bay leaves, three cloves, two heads of garlic, and a little thyme ; let it boil, cover it with paper, and simmer with fire over and under : it will take from four to five hours, drain, glaze, and serve it, with its juice, or on a ragout of endive, or any other. * The French mutton is generally much smaller than the English, and this ought to be observed, as where two carris are sometimes ordered, one might do.

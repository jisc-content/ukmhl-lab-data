FRENCH COOKERY. 162 prepared as is also directed: the jars into which they are put contain six or eight gallons, and upwards â€¢ and it will no doubt appear incredible to say, that four or five of these are filled for the use of one family, with the carcases and fat of these different fowls: they were distributed in such a manner that two should be opened at the same time, the best pieces in one and the worst in another, so that there should be no digging to expose a greater surface than is necessary to the air ; thus a leg or a wing, with a spoon- ful of the fat, made a ragout, a neck and pinion, or a back, with a spoonful of fat, made a soup; the relish of these meats is extremely high, and with sweet herbs and vegetables would be by some called beautiful, by others good, but by the French delicious ; it would be con- scientious in a book of this kind, not to recommend it highly, as there is so much waste of that sort of fat; the side bones and aprons are very nice, drained hot from it; the livers of the ducks fed in this way- are as large sometimes as those of lambs, and are of a bright shining gold colour; they are generally baked in high seasoned pies, and sent in presents, which pay a tax on entering Paris.

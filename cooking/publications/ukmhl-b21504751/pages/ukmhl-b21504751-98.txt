FRENCH COOKERY. 80 Fillets of Mutton. Petites Selles de Mouton, ou de Carbonnades. Cut out three carres of mutton between the haunch and the ribs, what is called the fillet; cut each into two long hearts, or peacocks’ tails ; pare the skin and nerves off three of them, and lard, and marque them with the others, in the same manner as the saddle d lei Sainie Menehoulde; when they are done drain them upon a cover, take off the skin of those that were not larded, and that which remained of the others; dry them a little with a hot poker, glaze the whole, and serve them with a ragout of small roots, endive, ■puree of sorrel, or a love apple sauce. Fore-quarter of Mutton. Ronchis de Mouton.

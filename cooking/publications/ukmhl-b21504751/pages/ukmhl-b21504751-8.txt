PRELIMINARY DISCOURSE. Y1 to make a great display and excellent cheer, by the simplest and most economical means. The experience of forty-four years is a guaranty for my doctrine, which I believe to be the best, rather from the general opinion than my own. Those who best understand the enjoyments of the table, have never ceased to rely on me. Proud of their suffrages, I shall esteem myself happy still to contribute to their enjoy- ments, and to add to their pleasures. I here present the progress of the art, and my observations, matured by long experience. These are my last adieus.

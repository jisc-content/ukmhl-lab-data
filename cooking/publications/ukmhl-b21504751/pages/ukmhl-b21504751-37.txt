19 SAUCES. Sauce a la Plttche. Take some very green parsley leaves, blanch and refresh them, and throw them into a search; put into a stewpan three skimming spoonsful of reduced veloute, and two of consomme; reduce the whole ; when ready to serve throw in the parsley; if too salt, put in a bit of butter; pass, vannez it, and serve. Sauce aux Truffes, ou a la Pcrigueux. Cut down truffles in rounds or dices; put them on a slow fire, with a bit of butter, and let them simmer; put in a sufficient quantity of reduced Espagnole, and add consomme or bouillon; white wine in equal pro- portion ; reduce, and skim it, and finish it with a bit of butter. Observe, that acid should never be put to this sauce, as it takes off its softness, and the wine is quite sufficient. Mushroom Sauce Sauce a la Puree de Champignons. Take two handfuls of mushrooms, wash them in several waters, rubbing them lightly: put them into a drainer ; mince them with their stalks; put them into a stewpan, with the size of an egg of butter; let them fall over a slow fire, and when nearly done, moisten them with two skimming spoonfuls of veloute ; let them simmer three quarters of an hour more ; rub them through a search, and finish it with cream as is di- rected for the onion puree, with this difference, how- ever, that this ought to be rather clearer. Sauce en Tortue. Put into a saucepan a ladleful of reduced Espagnole, a large glass of hard Madeira, a tea spoonful of curry powder, and half that quantity of Cayenne; reduce the whole; skim, put in some cocks’ combs and kid- neys, artichoke bottoms, a veal or Iamb’s sweetbread ; boil the whole, that the ingredients may taste and take the colour of the sauce; at the moment of serving put in six or eight hard yolks of eggs; take care not to break them in stirring the sauce, and serve.

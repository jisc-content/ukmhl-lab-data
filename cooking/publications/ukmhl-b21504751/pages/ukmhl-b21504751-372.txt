The English name of every dish that has got one is placed above the French, to give cooks as little trouble as possible: as further assistance, a page of black lines is subjoined, on which they may find it useful to lay the paper in making out their bills. To the above course, two fishes may be introduced lietween the soups and the removes, and foiulux of game or fowl, ramildns, small birds cooked in different ways, and what are in general called platx fle rdf, are all proper for removes. Professed cooks will excuse these remarks, which are now offered to them.

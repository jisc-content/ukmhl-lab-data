FRENCH COOKERY 274* Red Currant Jelly. Gelee de Groseilles. Take four pounds of sugar; break it, and put it into a sweetmeat-pan; take six pounds of red cur- rants, of which two ought to be white, to make the jelly more beautiful; after they have been rubbed to- gether, put them into a pan, with half a pint of water, upon the fire; stir them from time to time, that they may not stick; add a Tew rasps: when all is well boiled, throw it into a search ; take the juice and put it to the sugar; put all upon the fire; let it take a dozen of boils, which will be enough ; but to assure it, put out a spoonful upon a plate; if it jellies, pot it; if it does not, it requires a boil or two more. Take raspberries and prick them; take out their hearts; put a little gooseberry jelly upon the bottom of a compote dish and dress them upon it; put some of the same jelly carefully over them, and serve. Raspberry Jam. Confitures de Framboises. Take five pounds of raspberries, prick and take out the hearts ; clarify four pounds ef sugar in a sweetmeat- pan ; let it come to the first soiiffle (which you will know by blowing through the holes of the skimmer, if it flies off in feathers); put in the fruit; cover it and give it a boil; skim, and pot it. Apricots in Sugar. Compote d'Abricots. Take apricots nearly ripe ; take out the stones with- out breaking them ; put them on the fire to blanch, but do not let them boil, let the water only move; then put them in clarified sugar on a very slow fire, so that the sugar may incorporate: for twenty-five apricots a pound of sugar is necessary. If they are to be pre- served for future use, drain them next day, and give the syrup a dozen of boils, adding every day a little sugar, as it is necessary that the fruit should be always covered; continue for five days to boil the syrup, and pour it when cold over the fruit; on the last day you put the fruit into the boiling sugar ; give it a very little boil; skim it well, and pot it.

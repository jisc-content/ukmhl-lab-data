113 RABBITS. Timbale de Lapereaux. Prepare two young rabbits as above ; pass them in a stew-pan with butter, salt, pepper, parsley, young onions, shalots, mushrooms, ancl truffles hashed with fine spices, and a bay leaf; moisten the whole with a glass of white wine, and two large spoonsful of espa- gnole; let them simmer, and when done take out the bay leaf and let them cool; then butter a mould of sufficient size, line the mould with rolled paste (see Pate it Pate); begin at the middle of the bottom in turning the paste till it arrives at the edge; take care that the paste lies firm over each other, then have ready a piece of paste for a dou- ble bottom; it ought to be at least an inch larger than the mould, and about the thickness of a crown; wet it, and after having rubbed the bands over with yolks, put it in, join it well by pressing it with the hand that no opening may be left; then make small quenelles of godiveau, dress them all round till they nearly reach the top, then put in the leverets and mushrooms, passed or fried in butter; make a cover for the timbale, wet the edges, put on the cover, join it, and dress it round; let it be in the oven an hour and a half: when it has taken a good colour and ready to serve, turn it upon a dish, cut it open in the best man- ner, and put in a good espagnole. If there is not time to make the bands, butter a mould and powder it with vermicelli, put in a bottom and finish as above. Mayonnaise de Lapereaux. Cut two leverets, that have been roasted, in pieces, pare and toss them in a mayonnaise. (See Sauce May- onnaise.) Lepereaux aux fines Herbes. Cut two leverets in pieces, pare and put them into a stewpan with butter, salt, pepper, parsley, young onions, shalots hashed, and mushrooms ; pass them over the fire for a quarter of an hour; when they are sufficiently done, add the juice of a large lemon.

278 FRENCH COOKERY. Apple Jelly. Jelee de Pommes. Take any quantity of fine rennets; pare and cut them in pieces; wash and rub them with the hands in hot water, to make them thoroughly clean; drain and put them in a pan with as much water as they will swim in, but no more ; give them a boil so that they may be enough without being broken; put them into a search to drain ; have sugar ready at the first lisse ; and for every two spoonsful of sugar put three of juice, if it is strong, and four if it is weak; the sugar may be done to the first souffle; put in the juice, and do it over a strong fire, until it falls in bits ; add the juice of a lemon, and put it in pots or shapes.

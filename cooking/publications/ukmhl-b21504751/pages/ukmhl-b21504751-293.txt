STORE-ROOM. White Apricots. Abricots a Oreilles. Take white apricots from an espalier which are not quite ripe; cut them in two: take out the stones; peel them very thin; throw them into boiling water, but take care they do not boil; take them out of the water and drain; give them a good boil in clarified sugar ; leave them in a dish till next day; drain them again and boil the syrup ; when cold pour it over the fruit, and the third day it may be finished as the apricots for provision. Pot and cover them for future use. Apricot Marmalade Marmalade d' Abricots. Take some fine apricots from standards ; take out the stones and the spots of the skin; cut them in pieces: for six pounds of apricots take four pounds and half of sugar ; if it is loaf you must break it in a mortar, and you may put it on the fire with the apricots; take a wooden spatula; do not quit the marmalade till it is finished, or it will burn; and to know when it is done, dip the finger into it, and if it forms a thread in being pressed 'against the thumb, it has arrived at the proper point; take it off’ and pot it. To make it half sugar, it is necessary to observe, as it requires more boiling, that there is less confection. Apricot Paste. Pate d’Abricots. Take what quantity of ripe apricots you intend to make, and take out the stones; put them upon the fire to break ; rub them through a search; dry and weigh the paste; take as much clarified sugar (to the height of petit boulet) as fruit; mix all well together; put it again upon the fire; it must be much more done than the marmalade; put it into moulds; dry them in the stove or oven, and paper them for use. Apricots in Brandy. Abricots a l'Eau-de-vie. Choose the quantity wanted of the finest fruit with- out blemish from espaliers; prick each of them several times with the point of a knife; throw them into water ; blanch them, stirring them from time to time; when the fruit begins to soften, take them off quickly and N 6

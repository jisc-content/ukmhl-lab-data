FRENCH COOKERY. 334- must also be given to have some of the same wine in reserve for that purpose, for if an inferior wine is put in, it will spoil it. In the September following, or in six months from the first drawing off, it must be racked again in the same manner. It is in the repetition of this operation several times, that the wine acquires that quality and fineness that brings it to maturity, which prepares it for fining. For all sorts of red wine whisk five whites of eggs, and mix them with four pints of river water; draw off from the cask, to be fined, three bottles of wine: take a stick the size of a sweep- ing-broom-handle, and cut it at one end in four, so that it will distend like a claw-foot; these being held together can be introduced into the bunghole; after the whites of the eggs have been put in, with this stick agitate the wine so that it may be entirely mixed with it; but do not descend so low as the bottom of the cask ; when it is well mixed the ends of the cask are beaten to shake the wine, and giving a tremendous stroke to the top, bung the cask : this operation ought to take place in fine calm weather, and it ought to be left eight or ten days. All these directions and remarks are equally applicable to red and white wines; the only difference is that of the materials used for fining. Therefore, when there is white wine to be fined, employ isinglass, a piece of which, beaten and incorporated in twelve pints of water, is sufficient to fine three pieces of wine; take the necessary quan- tity, and prepare it, as for fining jellies, with river or spring water, which ought to measure about four pints when put into the cask, that it may be the more easily spread throughout the mass; when it has been all well worked with the stick as before indicated, beat and stop it: it ought to be pierced to give it air, as it facilitates the fining. If however, after every care, the wine is still thick, boil four English pints of milk or cream, and when cold, take off the cream ; put it into the cask : it will then not be long in clearing : on the contrary, if it is red wine that is thick, take grey paper, without smell,

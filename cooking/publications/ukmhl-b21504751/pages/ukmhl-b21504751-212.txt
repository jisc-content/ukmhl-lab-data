FRENCH COOKERY. 194 Filets de Soles a V Italienne. Take fried or cold soles ; take off the fillets nicely; put a little stock into a saucepan, and put them in; heat them upon hot cinders, taking care they do not boil; when ready to serve, drain them upon a cloth; dish one over the other like scales; and sauce them with an Italienne. Filets de Soles en Mayonnaise. Follow the same procedure as in the foregoing article, cutting the fillets two inches long, dishing in the form of a crown, and pouring over them a mayonnaise. Filets de Soles en Salade. Prepare the filets as above, and finish in the same manner as indicated for salade de volaille. Plaice, Flounder, and Bret. Limande, Carrelet, et Flaye.

Whiting may be done as soles a la Hollandaise, or d la Flamande, or sur le plat. Grilled Whitings. Merlans grilles. Having prepared whitings as above, nick them across, and lay them on the gridiron; do them on a slow fire; when ready to turn, lay softly over them

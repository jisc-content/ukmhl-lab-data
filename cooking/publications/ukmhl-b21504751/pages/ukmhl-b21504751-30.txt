SAUCES. Beef Juice. Jus de Rceuf. Butter the bottom of a stewpan, put into it some thin slices of ham and lard or bacon, with slices of onions and carrots, covering the whole with thick slices of beef, wet it with two spoonfuls of grand bouillon, or good stock, make it boil upon a brisk fire ; when it begins to stick, give it a prick with a knife; put it upon a slow fire or furnace, and take care it does not burn; when it is firmly fixed, wet it as directed for the blond de veau, skim it and season it with a bunch of parsley, and some stalks of mush- rooms ; when the meat is sufficiently cooked take off the fat and run the juice through a napkin; make use of it to colour potages, sauces, or made-dishes, which either require juice or colouring. Grande Sauce. Butter a saucepan and cover it with slices of ham, cut veal in pieces and cover the ham with it, and put in one or two spoonfuls of bouillon, as much as will nearly cover the veal; put in two carrots, a large onion, which must be taken out when done ; when it has become jelly, leave very little fire under, sur- round it with hot cinders, let it colour by sticking, detach it by putting in a ladleful of cold bouillon, and as soon as it is detached fill the saucepan with bouillon \ when the veal is done enough, take it out and pass it through a napkin into a saucepan, and if too strong reduce it to the proper thickness for sauce, by adding roux; boil it and set it aside upon the fur- nace ; shake it from time to time, and if it is not of a good colour add some beef juice (jus de bceuf); if a * Jububes is a fruit not much known here but as a preserve.

Buttered Apples. Pommes au Beurre. Core twenty apples; pare nine or ten., and make them nearly ready in a light sugar ; drain them; make a marmalade of the remainder, as for the charlotte; cover a dish with a little of this marmalade, to which any other may be added ; arrange the apples, and fill their hearts with butter, and put the remains of the marmalade to fill up the intervals of the apples; glaze them with sifted sugar, and put them into the oven; give them a fine colour. Cherries or any other preserved fruit may be stuck on the apples, and serve. Apples. Chartreuse de Pommes (Entremets.) Take a score of rennets; peel them, and with a very small corer take off all the pulp about the heart; when there is enough of those to fill the chartreuse mould, mince the rest of the apples to make a mar- malade ; equalise all the little apples, or pieces that have been cut out with the apple-corer; make a little saffron water ; put a little sugar to it; throw in a third of the small apples; give them a slight boil, take them off, and drain; do another third in cochineal, and the last in a syrup of white sugar, with an equal quantity of angelica as of each of the apples; cover the mould with white paper ; make any design in the bot- tom with red, green, yellow, and white; mix them taste- fully all round the mould to the top, and fill it up with marmalade, which ought to be firm and without any void. When ready to serve, turn up the mould

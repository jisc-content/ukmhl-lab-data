FRENCH COOKERY. 214 bottoms cut in five or six pieces ; take godiveau, roll it out in andouillettes, the size most convenient for the dish, dress them over and round these ingredients in such a manner that they form a flattened dome; make a cover a little larger than the bottom ; wet the bor- der of the first, put it over to form a cover, and fix it to the under one ; dress it properly round the edge; glaze it, and put it into the oven; when done, raise the cover, sauce it with a good espagnole, and serve it; or put the ragout into a stewpan, and give it a boil in the espagnole, which you must skim ; dish the tart, fill it with the ragout, and serve; all ragout tarts may be done in the same way.

Wine is not good till it has acquired its maturity, and till it loses its phlegm: when new, it ferments upon the stomach and goes to the head ; and when too old, by the loss of its qualities, it attacks the nerves ; yet we are not able to give a decided judgment on this point, as so much depends upon the seasons; some seasons giving wine that may be drunk in two or three years ; and others which cannot be drunk till four or tire, which depends upon the vintage ; it is not possible for those who depend alone upon taste to determine.

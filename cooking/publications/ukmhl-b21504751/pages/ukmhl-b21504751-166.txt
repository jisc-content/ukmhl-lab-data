FRENCH COOKERY. 148 into a stewpan with a little bouillon ; keep them warm without letting them boil; toss the fillets as directed au supreme; when done, drain them ; dish them with a slice of tongue between; if it is necessary that the entree should be larger, mix fried bread of the same shape and sauce, with a sauce au supreme. Legs of Fowls with small Onions, or as Swans Cuisses de Poulardes en Canetons, ou en petits Oignons. Take the fillets of three fine cold roasted pullets, taking care not to hurt the skin of the legs, which must be partly boned, leaving a part of the leg-bone which is next the claw; fill the legs with a salpipon made of fat livers, truffles, and mushrooms; give them the shape of a swan’s neck, the claw forming the beak; fix it with a thread to keep its form; make two in- cisions, one to form the height on the beak, the other upon the back of the claw, which represents the head; take six fine large craw-fish with equal claws; boil them in stock; take off the large claws; make of them the wings of a swan by sticking them into the sides; cover the bottom of a stewpan with barbs of lard; put in the cygnets as if they were swimming; lay upon each a slice of lemon, that they may be very white; moisten with a poele; cover with barbs of lard and paper; three quarters of an hour before serving make it boil, and put it on a. paillasse with a little fire over; when done drain and unlace them; serve them upon a green sauce (Hollandaise vert), or beurre d'ecrevisses. Legs of Fowls another Way. Cuisses de Poulardes en Ballon. Bone six or eight pullets’ legs, as in the foregoing article; put them upon a cloth and stuff them with a salpiqon; sew them up (poularde en bigarrure); marque them in a stewpan covered with barbs of lard; moisten with a poele; cook them about three quarters of an hour; when ready to dish, drain, and serve under them a good Italienne rousse.

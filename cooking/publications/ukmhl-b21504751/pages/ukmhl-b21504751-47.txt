SAUCE. 29 search some of the finest and whitest flour; put in as much as the butter will take; make only what will be required: this roux ought to have the consist- ence nearly of a firm paste ; put it first upon a quick fire; let it be constantly stirred; when it becomes very white, and begins to thicken, put it upon hot cinders under a lighted stove, in such a manner as the red cinders may fall upon the cover ; stir every seven minutes until it is a fine roux; by this manner of doing it, it will not have that acidity that roux generally has. Roux Blanc. Melt some of the finest butter over a slow fire, and put in sufficient quantity of flour as directed above, and let care be taken that it takes no colour ; stir it half an hour, and use it for veloute. Batter for Frying. Pate a Frire. Search half a pound of flour ; put it into a vessel with two spoonfuls of oil, salt, and two or three yolks of eggs ; moisten it with beer, in such quantity that the paste does not cord; work till it is of the consist- ence of bouillie ; whip one or two whites of eggs; work them lightly into the paste; make it two or three hours before it is wanted. Remember the lightness of the paste depends upon the whipping of the whites of the eggs ; the paste may be made with butter instead of oil, and with hot water instead of beer, in adding a glass of white wine. Fritters. Fritures. Experience has taught that the fat taken from the stock pot makes the best fritters : when there is not any of this, its place is supplied by the kidney fat of beef, hashed very fine or cut in dices, which must be melted with care; these fats are much better than the sain-doux or hogsâ€™ lard, which softens the paste, and still more when they are heated to swell and froth, making it fly into the fire, which is dangerous. Oil has nearly the same effect, and of course not less at- tended with danger, but it does not soften. Melted fat has nearly the same fault, and is very expensive;

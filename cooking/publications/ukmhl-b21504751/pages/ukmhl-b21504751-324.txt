306 FRENCH COOKERY. Ice of Pears. Glace de Poires. Ice may be made of all sorts of pears; there are, however, some better than others, such as the but- ter pear, the St. Germain, the creusanne, and the rousselet; take as many of any of these pears as is necessary; peel and cut them in pieces; put them upon the fire, with as much water as is sufficient to make them fall; add the requisite quantity of sugar; rub it through a search with a spatula; add the juice of two lemons; put it to ice. Lemon Ice. Glace de Citron. For fifteen lemons, clarify a pound and half of sugar; put two thirds of it into a basin; put in two or three zests; cut the lemons in bits, press the juice through a search into the sugar; let them infuse an hour, and put in the remainder of the sugar; taste that it is not too strong of the lemon, and take care for all ices that the sugar has only obtained the height of the lisse ; finish it as the other ices. Orange Ice. Glace dâ€™ Oranges de Portugal. For twelve oranges, have a pound of clarified sugar, into which throw the zests of three or four of them, and take care that the sugar is more boiled than for the lemon: as the oranges give more juice, the ice will be too liquid; which will be avoided by boiling the sugar to a higher degree; pass it through a gauze search, and add oranges or sugar, as may be necessary; and wrhen finished, put it to ice. Seville Orange Ice. Glace de Begarades. Take a pound and quarter of sugar; clarify it in four pints of water with the white of an egg; take eight juicy Seville oranges, put in the zests of two, and pass the whole through a search, with the juice of tour lemons; leave them to infuse a full hour; then put them through a gauze search, fill the ice moulds, and put them to ice. Ice Cream of Roses. Glace de Creme a la Rose. Take two handsful of fresh picked roses; boil a pint of rich cream ; then put in the roses and cover

RAGOUTS. y>9 thicken as in the preceding article, and if au roux, follow the directions also in that article. Soft Roes of Carp. Ragout de Laitance de Carpes. Let two dozen of the roes of carps be taken; take out the alimentary canals, and put them into fresh water, to degorge for half an hour ; change the water, and let them be put on the side of a stove ; leave them till they become white ; let another stew-pan be ready with boiling water ; throw them in with a little salt; let them boil; take them off the.fire; have in a stew- pan four skimming-spoonfuls of [Italienne blanche, or rousse); put in the roes; let them boil once or twice; skim them, and finish with lemon juice; serve them as ragout de laitances, either in a silver stew-pan, a case, or in a vol-au-vent. A Ragout of Carp Tongues. Ragout de Langues de Carpes. Let a hundred tongues be taken; and proceed and finish as in the foregoing receipt. Truffles. Ragout mix Truffles. Take a pc and or two, as may be necessary; choose them if possible, round, heavy, and fine skinned; press them with the hand; they ought to resist, that they may neither be soft nor gluey ; if they smell of cheese they are not good; when thus picked, throw them into fresh water, and such as swim are not so good as those that remain at the bottom; brush them to take off al-1 the earth, and throw them again into fresh water, and not into hot, that they may not lose their flavour; brush them again and with a knife clear all the specks of the earth and the little wooden skewers by which they are often put together by the sellers to make them look better; wash them a third time, and more if the water still appears turbid; take them out and peel off the skin as thin as possible ; the finest are generally kept to serve in a napkin, or era croustade, the others are cut in slices or in dices, to make truffle sauce, which will be found in the follow- ing article.

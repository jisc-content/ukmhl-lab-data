FRENCH COOKERY. HO a sauce liachee, and in default of that a pauvre homme ; let the fowl simmer in one of these sauces a quarter of an hour before serving ; dish and add to tne sauce gherkins cut in small rounds and fillets. Poulets a la Saint-Cloucl. Prepare two fowls as for an entree de broche ; take two or three very black truffles; make little nails of them ; decorate the fowls with them, which is done by putting one into each hole made in the breast with a small larder; it is necessary to make the holes at equal distances ; cover a stewpan with slices of bacon, an onion stuck with a clove, a turned carrot, a bunch of parsley and young onions ; strew over the breast a little fine salt and a squeeze of a lemon ; cover with lard and a round of paper; moisten with a poele, or a glass of consomme, or bouillon, with a glass of white wine, half a bay-leaf, and a slice of ham : three quarters of an hour before serving make them boil, put them on a paillasse, with fire under and over; when enough drain, dish and serve with a truffle sauce; if there is no veloute, pass the stock of the fowls ; put in a pat of butter, mixed with half a spoon- ful of flour ; let it boil, and skim it; reduce and pass it through a tammy; put in the small dice of truffle, (as for the sauce en petit-deuil) passed in butter; finish with half a pat of butter. Poulets a la Ravigote. Prepare two fowls as for an entree de broche, or roasting; serve them with a sauce a la ravigote. Ditto. Poulets a la Paysanne ou a la Demidaff. Cut up two fowls as for a fricassde; put about the size of an egg of butter into a stewpan, and four spoonfuls of olive-oil; pass it over a quick fire; give them a good colour; season with salt and large pep- per ; when half done, add two sliced carrots, four onions cut in rings, and a few branches of parsley; pass them altogether; and when the roots are coloured, moisten the paysanne with six large spoonfuls of Espa- gnole; shake it; let it simmer softly over cinders for a quarter of an hour ; take care it does not stick. __

93 l’ORK. Shoulders of Lamb Stuffed. Epaule d'Agneau en Musette. Take two shoulders of lamb as large as possible ; bone them entirely except the knuckles; spread them out; season the inside with salt, pepper, and fine spi- ces ; fill them with a good salpipon ; make them up round as a tailor does a button; lard en rosette * the outsides of the shoulders, or instead a small bit of farce cuite, which may be decorated with truffles or chardons, &c. Then marque a stew-pan with bones and parings of butcher’s meat, slices of ham, carrots, onions, and a bunch of parsley and young onions; season it; moisten the braise with soup or stock; cover with slices of bacon and buttered paper; let it boil; put it upon a paillasse with fire over and under ; give it an hour and half; drain and glaze what has been larded; if they have not been larded, glaze round where it should have been done ; serve them over an Italienne sauce or good espagnole. PORK. Choose pork young and fat, and take care it is not diseased, for in that case, it is very unhealthy. Pig's Head. Hure de Cochon. Cut the head down half the shoulders, that is, farther than they are generally done; singe very carefully, and clean the ears by introducing a poker nearly red to burn the hair; wash it well; clean it again ; scrape and bone it; be careful not to pierce the skin, parti- cularly that over the nose ; the pieces of meat that are cut off, must be laid on where there is none, that it may be equally thick; then put it in a large earthen vessel; make salt water; let it cool ; draw it off clear, and pour it over the hure ; let it be entirely covered; put in a handful of juniper berries, bay leaves, five or six cloves, two or three cloves of garlic (cut in two), half an ounce of powdered salt-petre, thyme, basil and sage; cover the vessel with a cloth, and put on the co- ver as close as possible: let it marinade eight or ten * En rosette is to do them in a rose or fanciful figure.

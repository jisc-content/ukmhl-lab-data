100 FRENCH COOKERY blood with four pints of rich cream, hashed fine herbs, fine spices, salt, and pepper, mix all well together; take the puddings of hogs or sheep, which must be well scraped and cleaned; fill them with a filler; but do not make them too full, otherwise they might break; tie them into proper lengths; put them into a pot of warm water, and do them over a slow fire to prevent their breaking; turn them carefully with a skimmer; if they are pricked, and the fat comes out, they are sufficiently done; take them up upon a cloth and let them cool; when they are to be sent to table cut and grill them.

These puddings do not require so much cooking as the black ; instead of water use milk; let them cool and prick them, instead of cutting, before they are put upon the grill: the best manner of doing them is to put them into a white paper case. Craw-fish Pudding. Boudin d'Ecrivisses. Take half a hundred of craw-fish, and boil them in bouillon ; let them cool; take the shells off the claws and tails, and suppress that of the bodies ; dry the shells, pound and make a butter of them (see Beurre d'Ecre-

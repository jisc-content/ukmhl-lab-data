FRENCH COOKERY. 228 Pistache Cake. Gateau aux Pislaches. Make a cream patissiere, prepare a quarter of a pound of pistachios and of sweet almonds ; beat them together; from time to time add a drop of water to pre- vent oiling; when smooth take them out of the mor- tar; have a spoonful of spinage, blanched and passed in butter ; beat them and put them through a cullen- der, and put all the ingredients into the cream ; finish as for the gateau de carottes, but instead of confected orange-flower, let it be orange-flower water; a tea- spoonful will be sufficient. Flanc de Nouilies meringuees. Take a bit of pate d dresser, turn and roll it to the thickness of three or four lines; make a flattened round in the middle of the paste with the palm of the hand, to form the bottom of the Jlanc; raise the sides of it, by making the paste go into itself without forming any folds ; form the bottom of the pate; fill it with flour till within half an inch of the top; make a top for it of pate moulee ; roll it out, and make it round of the size of the jlanc ; cover and solder it well; take away the superfluous paste, dress it tastefully, and bake it as a pate ; when enough, take out the flour and scrape the crust well; have nouilies sufficient; poach them in milk, drain them, put in some yolks of eggs, sugar, orange-flowers, or green citron, minced maca- roons, and massepains bruised; add salt and some good melted butter; mix altogether; whip the half of the whites of the eggs, and incorporate them lightly; put the nouilies thus prepared into the jlanc; put it into a slow oven, give it three quarters of an hour; when it has risen well, beat the rest of the whites, sea- son them as for meringues ; cover the jlanc with it; glaze with sugar, sifted through a hair search ; bake it of a fine colour, and serve. Flanc de Vermicelle. Poach the vermicelle, drain it, and proceed in the same manner as jlanc de nouilies.

Sauce Espagnole. Take two or three noix of vealt, cover a saucepan with slices of bacon and ham, let there be most of the last, and conduct it by wetting it with consommt, as is directed for the grande sauce; season it with five or six carrots and as many onions ; after it has boiled put it upon a slow fire that the juice may be made ; when the glaze is properly formed it will be a fine yellow; take it off the fire, prick it with the point of a knife that the juice may come out; wet it with con- somme in which has been cooked a sufficient quantity of partridges, rabbits, or fowls ; put in a bunch of parsley and young onions, seasoned with two cloves according to the quantity, half a bay leaf, a clove of garlic, a little sweet basil and thyme ; boil the whole, and draw it to the edge of the grate, and skim it; at the end of two hours mix it with the roux as the coulis; let it rather be clear than thick; boil it from half to three quarters of an hour that the roux may incorporate ; skim and pass it through a search into another stewpan ; put it again upon the fire, and let it reduce a fourth part. This answers for all brown sauces; add Madeira, Champagne, or Burgundy, ac- cording to the sauce.

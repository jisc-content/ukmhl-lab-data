130 FRENCH COOKERY. To roast Larks. Alouettes a la Broche. Prepare twenty-four larks without opening them; wrap each in a slice of lard, and skewer them as they are done on a small skewer; pass a pack-thread from one side to the other lengthways to secure the lard; tie it to the spit; cook them at a brisk and clear fire; put toast in the dripping-pan to receive the fat, and serve them upon it. Larks another Way. Alouettes au Gratin. Prepare fifteen larks; cut them up the back ; bone them and fill them with gratin ; (see Gratin, art. Farce); cover a dish with about half an inch of the gratin; lay the larks over it en couronne, that there may be a well in the middle, as directed for quails au gratin; fill up with gratin, leaving nothing visible but the breast, which must be covered with slices of lard; put them into an oven; (these small dishes maybe cooked in a hearth-oven, or with fire under and over); let them take a fine colour; when enough take off the lard and bread ; sauce with a brown Italienne. Larks with Tniffle. Saute de Mauviettes aux Truffes. Prepare four dozen of larks and take off the fillets; melt some butter in a saut4-pan; put in the fillets like scollops, and put over them truffles cut like farthings; put into a stewpan four spoonfuls of espagnole and two of consommd, and add the carcases or debris of the larks from which the gizzards have been taken, with a glass of champagne ; let it stew half an hour; skim and rub it through a tammy; reduce it to half glaze; the fillets and truffles being cooked, drain off the hutter, preserving the juice; put the fillets, truffles, and juice into the fumet, without allowing it to boil; toss it well, and finish with half a pat of butter. Cold or hot Pate of Larks. Pat4 chaud et Pat4 froid de Mauviettes. (See article Patisserie).

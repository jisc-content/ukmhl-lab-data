Pain de Marrons. Take a hundred chesnuts; grill them till they are done enough without burning; when they are shelled, beat them in a marble mortar, with two pats of butter, and some good double cream.; put them through a hair search; take care they are not too wet; what does not go through must be put into the mortar, and re-beaten with a little cream; weigh the paste, and put half of its weight of sifted sugar to it, with a little vanille, mixed well together; take the size of a large chesnut of paste, and form it with a knife; give it a slight gash, and go on forming till the paste is worked up, putting them upon a buttered paper ; glaze them with yolk of egg ; put them into a very hot oven, that they may have a fine colour; take them off with a knife when taken from the oven.

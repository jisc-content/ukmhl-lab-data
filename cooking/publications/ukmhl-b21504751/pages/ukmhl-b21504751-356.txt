Another simple Manner to make Vinegar in the Country. â€” Simple Maniere de fairedu Vinaigre ala Campagne. Take brambles, or wild blackberries, gather them before they are ripe, but when they have attained a fine red colour; put them into a pot with red wine; give them a boil; put the whole into a cask and fill it up with wine; add a handful of salt, and some whole long or black pepper; stop the cask, and in a month it will be good vinegar. Another Manner. Autre Maniere. Take a pint of rye flour, and mix it in good vinegar of any kind : work it into a firm paste, as if for bread, and put it into the oven after the bread is drawn ; let it dry well so that it may be reduced again into flour; mix it again in the same manner, and dry and reduce it; and again a third time, when it may be put into the barrel; which, in a very short time, will produce an excellent vinegar. Rose Vinegar. Take a quarter of a pound of the leaves of wild roses, and brambles, that are not fully ripe, with an ounce of very ripe barberries, dry them all in the shade; when they are sufficiently dry, reduce them to very fine powder; put half an ounce of this powder into half a pint of good red or white wine; shake it and leave it to repose; put it through a linen cloth. This is Rosat Vinegar. It is said, the same result may be obtained by put- ting a drachm of the marrow of a hare into two pints of wine. Vinaigre du Connetahle. Put into a well varnished earthen jar, capable of containing twelve pints, eight pints of rosat vinegar, with a pound of new Alexandrian raisins, stoned ; put the jar upon red cinders for ten hours, after which give it some little boils ; when half cold, pass it through a linen cloth, bottle and cork it well.

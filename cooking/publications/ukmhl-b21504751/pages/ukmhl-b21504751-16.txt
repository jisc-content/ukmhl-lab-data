TO THE COOK. Every thing has been done to render the following articles intelligible to every capacity, but it cannot be too much recommended to the cook, if she wishes to become an adept in her profession, to peruse the fol- lowing pages with attention, till she acquires a thorough knowledge; and instead of being intimi- dated by French names, she ought to learn their sig- nification. She will always find what she wants under its own article, and one recipe will elucidate another. The first annoyance will arise from the frequent re- currence of poele, braise, godiveau, espagnole, pot age, consomme, veloute, marinade, fumet, roux, pate a frire, salpi^on, puree, Sfc. These terms once properly under- tood, practice and regular attention will do the rest; for without method there can be little attainment. Some words that cannot well be left out of the work are added : Barber, to cover with slices of lard. Blanchir, to blanch by giving some boils in water. Brider, to truss up a fowl, or any thing else with a needle and pack thread, or tape. Chevrettcr, to dish in a sort of garland one thing over another round a dish.

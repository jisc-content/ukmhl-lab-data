335 WINES. and roll it up sheet by sheet, introducing them at the bunghole, and allowing each as it goes in to dis- tend before another is introduced: let them fall to the bottom, and do not draw off the wine till it is clear. There are many other ways of fining wine; but as these are simple, both in application and effect, Monsieur Beauvilliers does not reveal his knowledge on that head. The thickness of wines arises from known and un- known causes; the known are the want of attention to the proper times of racking, the not filling up of the casks, their being put into hot cellars in summer, and drawing from them for use; these causes depend entirely upon proper management; but there are others which cannot be so well accounted for, such !as the consequences which follow hot and dry sum- mers, or cold and wet ones; when the natural com- binations are obstructed, and the active powers lan- guish ; but care and judicious treatment will in the end I succeed: the malady once fixed there may be dan- ger of a relapse ; and all wines that have given much trouble in fining, ought to be used as soon as possible. If in piercing the wine does not spring out clear, as it ought to do, but comes sickly, drop by drop, then, besides what has been indicated above, beat an ounce of cream of tartar, put it into a bottle nearly filled with wine that has been racked, shake it well till it dissolves; put in two pints of brandy, and (twelve bottles, less or more, of wine of the same year : this operation ought to be successful in clearing the wine. Observations upon the Manner of bottling Wines. When a piece has been fined, it ought to be raised a little behind, so that it may incline to the fosset; this inclination should not be more than two inches ; this precaution is necessary to prevent the necessity of troubling the wine when it becomes clear. It is not necessary to give a detail of piercing casks, as no {one unaccustomed to such work would attempt to re- fine and bottle wines.

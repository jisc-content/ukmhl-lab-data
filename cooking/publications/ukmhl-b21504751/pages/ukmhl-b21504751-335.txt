Continue to draw off four pints more, and keep it to put into another distillation of the same kind, in- stead of as much water. Double Orange Flower Water. Eau de Fleur d'Orange double. Repeat the same distillation, from which is drawn off sixteen pints, and put them upon a pound of fresh flowers, and draw off twelve pints, or if to be very (good, only ten pints; continue and take off four pints, which may be added to the simple orange-flower water, taking care not to have too much fire, particu- larly towards the end; as the flowers being then (nearly dry, they may burn and spoil all the rest: changing the receivers often may prevent disap- pointment.

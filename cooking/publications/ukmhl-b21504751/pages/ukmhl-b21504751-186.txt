Take two small pike that do not smell of the pond; prepare them; lay them upon a table and skin them ; cut the flesh in large dice; put them into a stew- pan with a bit of butter; cook without burning; let them cool ; pound twenty sweet almonds ; soak a roll in cream, and dry it as is directed at the article Panade; pound this panade; take it out of the mortar and pound the fish, then pound them altogether; spread some butter into a stewpan; put in onions cut in two, and slices of roots, such as carrots, turnips, half a clove of garlic, half a bay-leaf, a little mace, a bunch of parsley, young onions, a clove, two carp cut in pieces, and the refuse of the pike; moisten this with a little bouillon de pois; let it sweat over a slow fire; when done pass it through a towel, and use it to moisten the farce that has been already prepared, which must be rubbed through a tammy and have the consistence of a coulis; set it in the bain-marie till ready to serve ; put into the stock-pot some bread cut in dice, fry it in butter, and pour the puree over it. Almond Soup. Potage au Lait d'Amandes. Take a pound and half of sweet almonds and twelve bitter ones; skin them as usual, by putting them in water over the fire; pound them, putting in from time to time a drop of water to prevent their oiling; when they are quite smooth they are sufficiently done : put into a stewpan six pints of water; when it boils infuse half an ounce of coriander and half a lemon, keeping out the skin and seeds; moisten the almonds with this infusion; pass it several times through a napkin or tammy till it takes the appearance of milk; salt and sugar it properly; put it into the bain-marie.

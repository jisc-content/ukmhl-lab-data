Prepare and truss eight quails; cover a stewpan with slices of lard and one of ham; put in the quails, pour a poele over them; if there is none cut some kidney fat of veal in dice, an onion stuck with a clove, half a bay-leaf, a sliced carrot, a small bunch of parsley and young onions; moisten with consomme and half a glass of white wine; cover with slices of lard and a round of paper; half an hour before serving make them boil and cook; when enough, drain and dish with lettuces (see Garnitures); fried bread of a fine colour may be introduced between the quails after they have been sauced with a good reduced es- pagnole in which a bit of glaze has been dissolved. If there is no espagnole, let the quails be done a little earlier; moisten the seasoning of the quails with a little roux; reduce the sauce; pass it through a tammy; work it anew, and sauce the quails with it. Quails in Crusts. Cailles en Crustades. Prepare six or seven quails; bone and stuff them with a gratin made of their livers mixed with those of fowls (see Gratin, art. Farce); sew up the quails and marque them as in the foregoing receipt; make as many croustades as there are quails, (see Hachis des Becasses en Croustades); when they are done draw out the thread and put them into the croustades ; dish and sauce them with a good Italienne, in which there is minced truffles done in butter. Quails with Truffles. Cailles aux Truffes. Draw by the crop six quails; clean and turn nine fine truffles into small ones; mince the parings very fine with the quailsâ€™ livers; season with salt and a bit of butter; cook the whole lightly; let them cool, stuff the quails; then marque them in a stewpan, as directed for those done with let- tuce; when done drain and serve them with a sauce a la Ptrigueux; (see Art. Sauce aux Truff'es or a la Ptrigueux.)

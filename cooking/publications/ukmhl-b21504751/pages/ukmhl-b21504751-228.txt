210 FRENCH COOKERY. put it on a paste slab ; form a well in the middle of the flour to contain water; work a pound of butter, and put into it; add an ounce of fine salt*, and some water ; work the butter well in and beat the paste till it is very firm ; work it well together, and break it two or three times with the palm of the hand, and gather it into one mass, and put it to repose half an hour in a wet cloth before it is used. It may be made five or six pounds to a bushel; that of four pounds serves ge- nerally for large cold pdtes and cold timbales; those of five or six pounds, (and by adding an egg to the pound), serve for hot pates, timbales of maca- roni, and others. Observe, that half a pound of butter to the pound of flour for cold pates, and three quarters, with an egg, to the pound of flour for the hot pates, timbales, &c. Pate brisee. Take a quart of flour, more or less, as may be necessary ; pass it through a search, and put it on a paste table; add an ounce of salt, a pound and a half of butter, and as much water as will suffice to make a firm paste ; work it well, that it may be mixed without dividing the butter too much; put it firmly together, and if too dry, add a little water; make it into a mass ; strew the board with flour ; put the paste upon it, sprinkle a little water over it, and cover it with a wet cloth; let it repose half an hour, and use it for cakes de pate brisde for the foundation of many entremets; for that purpose give it three or four turns as long as the butter appears divided. Here Monsieur Beauvillier enters into the rolling and flouring the paste, and the manner of handling the rolling pin; but as it is not to be suspected that any one will think of following French cookery in this country, without being an adept in these things, they are left out, as rather confusing the work without being useful; wherever he seems to excel, all is particularly noticed; he desires that care should be taken not to strew too * As salt butter is never used in France, if used, care must be taken to wash it out rather than use more.

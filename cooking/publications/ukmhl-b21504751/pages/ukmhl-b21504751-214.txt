FRENCH COOKERY. 196 Filets de Merlans en Turban. Take fifteen or eighteen whitings; cut the fillets from five or six of the largest, and prepare the remainder for forced meat (a la quenelles des merlans;) this done, make a large cork of bread, set it on the smallest end in the middle of a dish ; put round it very thin slices of lard, and also forced meat, as it were, in steps to form the turban ; surround it with fillets in form of muslin bands to make a turban ; if it is the season, garnish it with white truffles, cut in the form of large pearls, or any thing that may be turned to have that appearance; baste with melted butter, cover with thin slices of lard, and over them, buttered paper; cook it in the oven with a light braise under it; when enough done, take out the cork and all the lard ; drain it; put into the hollow or well a good Italienne, and serve ; or ragout may be used. Filet de Merlans au Gratin. Having the fillets ready, spread them upon a table; cover them entirely with a cooked forced meat; if for maigre, one of whitings, and roll it equally; spread upon the bottom of a dish, rather more than half an inch thick offarce; lay the fillets upon it in the form of a crown ; cover and fill it up entirely with farce, and unite it together with the blade of a knife dipt in hot water, giving it a regular form; strew grated crumbs of bread over it, and baste it with butter; put it into the oven till it takes a fine colour; sauce it with an Italienne rousse, or an Espagnole reduite; and serve.

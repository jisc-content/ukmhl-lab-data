179 PIKE. i G Another Way Brocket an Dauphin. Take a large pike; scale, gut it by the ears ; turn round its tail, which must be done by putting a skewer through the eyes and tying the tail to each side of it; place the fish upon its belly, and make it rest in that position; put it into a braise maigre, or into a good mircpois ; put it into the oven; take it out from time to time to baste it with its liquor ; when it is enough drain and serve it with an Italienne grasse, or maigre. (See article Sauce.) Pike another Way. Brocket a VArliquine. Take a large pike that has been kept a proper time; scale and gut it by the ears; raise the skin upon one side without spoiling the flesh ; lard one quarter of it with anchovies, another quarter with gherkins, the third quarter with carrots, and the fourth with truffles; stuff it for maigre with stuffing of fish; if gras, a cooked stuffing of fowl or veal; put it into a fish-ket- tle, and add a braise, taking care that the larded side does not touch it; put it on the fire, and baste it often with the braise; cover, and put fire over; drain and pour over it a sauce a Varliquine. (See article Sauce.) Another Way. Granaclins de Brocket. Do them as granadins de carpe; if for gras they must be larded with lard ; if maigre, with eels and an- chovies ; serve them over a sauce de tomate, mush- rooms, or any other vegetable sauce. Another Way. Cotelottes de Brocket. Clean and take off the flesh of a pike ; take off the skin and cut the flesh in cutlets; make it ready in fine herbs hashed, as veal cutlets are done in paper. (See article Cotelottes de Veau in Papilottes.) Another Way. Filets de Brocket a la Bcchamellc. Take a cold pike ; cut it in fillets ; put it into a bechamelle reduced ; arrange it upon a dish ; strew crumbs over, and wet it with butter; garnish with bread cut in form of corks steeped in omelette ; give it a fine colour in the oven.

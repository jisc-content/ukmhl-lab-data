340 FRENCH COOKERY. Rose Vinegar for the Toilet or Salads. Vinaigre a la Rose pour la Toilette ou les Salades Is made by putting in the same quantity, that is to say, a pound and a half of dried rose leaves, into twenty-four pints of vinegar, and instead of cloves and lemon-zest, a bunch of the roots of Florence lilies, well dried; when the vinegar is made,..preserve the iris roots * by draining them for the same purpose, as they will do several times. Ravigote Vinegar. Vinaigre d la Ravigote. Take tarragon leaves prepared as above ; pimpernel leaves, chives, and shalots, of each two ounces ; fresh garlic and flowers of elder, an ounce and half, the zest of two lemons, and a dozen of cloves bruised; put all into a jar, and pour over them twenty-four pints of good white vinegar, it must be very strong, as the other in- gredients tend, from their viscous nature, to reduce the strength; when it is finished put in two ounces and a half of spirits of wine, which will give an ex- cellent vinegar, that may be preserved a long time. It ought to have a full month to make. Note.â€” In proportioning the ingredients, smaller quantities may be made. Cider Vinegar. Vinaigre de Cidre. To a barrel of cider prepare a pound and a half of leaven of rye, flour, and if vinegar is not employed in making, it may he allowed to sour of itself, and when it has sufficiently taken, mix it with warm water and put it into the cider; shake it well and mix it with a stick as is recommended in the fining of wines; put the cask in a warm place, which retains almost always the same temperature, and in ten or twelve days the vinegar will be fit for use; when it is made, put it in bottles. If the vinegar is made of Perry it will be much better, and have a finer appearance. Beer Vinegar Is made in the same manner as that of Cider. * Note this.

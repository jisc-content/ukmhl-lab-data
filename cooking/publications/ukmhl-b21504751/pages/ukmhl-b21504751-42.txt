FRENCH COOKERY. 24 Sauce Pois verts pour Entrees et Entremets. Take the necessary quantity of peas, wash and drain them, put them into a stewpan with a bit of butter, a handful of parsley in branches, four or five young onions cut in two; toss the peas; when they wrinkle, put in two ladles full of bouillon ; put in one or two slices of ham ; let them boil, and drain aside, and leave them to simmer; drain, take out the ham, and break them with a spoon or bruise them in a mortar; rub them through a search, wetting them with the bouillon in which they were cooked; put the puree into a stewpan with a piece of butter and a spoonful or two of veloute, reduce it to the proper consistence of a puree; skim, season with salt, put in a little bit of sugar, and finish it with a pat of butter; if it is not green enough, add a little green of spinage, as is directed before. Pease Soup. Puree de Pois secs. Do it in the same manner as the other potages, and finish it as green pease. Lentile Sauce ou Puree. Sauce d la Puree de Lentilles a la Reine. It is made as the puree of pease, except that Es- pagnole must be used, and that they take more cook- ing than the peas ; it ought to be a fine red colour; finish it with a bit of butter, and let it have the same consistence as the puree of pease. Puree de Gibier. Take one or two roasted partridges and a leveret, either separate or mixed together, take off all the flesh, pick off the skin and nerves, hash it very fine, beat it well in the mortar, add reduced Espagnole and a little consomme; heat the whole on a slow fire without boiling; when it is very hot, rub it through a search; gather it carefully, put it into a stewpan, heat it and put it in a bain-fnarie, and when ready to serve, finish it with a bit of butter; if not strong enough, put in a bit of glaze, and serve it with poached eggs, fried bread, or croustades.

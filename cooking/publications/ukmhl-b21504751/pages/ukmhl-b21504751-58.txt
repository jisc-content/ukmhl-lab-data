40 FRENCH COOKERY. Ragoui of Truffle. Ragout aux Tniffes et a HEs- pagnole. Take the truffles that may be necessary ; cut them in slices or dices; put them in a stew-pan on a slow fire with a bit of butter ; let them sweat; moisten with half a glass of wine and two spoonfuls of reduced espagnule; let them cook upon a slow fire; skim the sauce, and finish with a little bit of butter; let care be taken to mix it well whether on the fire or in shaking ; put no lemon juice, as it would take off the softness of the sauce. Another. Ragout aux Truffes a V Italienne. Prepare the truffles as in the above receipt; sweat them in butter; put in hashed shalots and parsley, salt and pepper; moisten with half a glass of white wine and two skimming-spoonfuls of espagnole; boil the sauce ; skim it, and finish with a little good oil of olives. Another may. Ragout aux Trujfes a laPiedmonlaise. Dress the truffles as directed before, but instead of butter, use olive oil, with a little bruised garlic; put them upon hot cinders that they may only shake ; after a quarter of an hour, season with fine salt and pepper; force them a little with lemon juice, and serve. Another tvay. Ragout Â« la Peregueux. Cut the truffles in small dices; do them in butter, put in two or three large spoonfuls of italienne rousse or espagnole, with a little white wine, and finish it with half a pat of butter : this sauce serves for par- tridges, fowls, chickens, and turkeys stuffed with truffles. Mushrooms. Observations sur les Champignons. The surest manner to discover bad ones, is to cut them with a piece of metal: when they have been so cut and the leafy substance extracted, let them lie an hour, and if they remain unchanged in their colour, being white, they may be used ; peel off the skin; lay them in oil or vinegar, making many incisions in them.

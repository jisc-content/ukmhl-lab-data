VINEGARS. 339 Vinegar of Lavender for the Toilette. Prepare a jar of a proper size, and to every pint of vinegar add half an ounce of fresh lavender flowers,and some zests of lemon; leave them to infuse twenty-four hours: put the jar, well luted, upon hot.cinders for eight or ten hours without boiling ; pass it through a bag, or filter ; bottle, and keep it closely waxed. Thieves Vinegar. Vinaigre des quatre Voleurs. Take an ounce of the tops of wormwood; rosemary, sage, mint, and rue, of each half an ounce; flowers of lavender, two ounces; aromatic gum, cinnamon, cloves, nutmegs, and fresh garlic, two drams of each; half an ounce of camphor, and eight pounds of red vinegar; beat all these ingredients well, and put them into a proper earthen jar, and pour the vinegar upon them ; the garlic ought to be sliced ; and after stopping the jar, put it in the sun or in a hot place, such as a sand bath, for three or four weeks ; wring out the ingre- dients, and filter it through grey paper ; the camphor must be dissolved in a little spirits of wine. This vine- gar ought to be kept closely corked. Tarragon Vinegar. Put into a proper jar twenty-four pints of good white vinegar; take a pound and half of fresh tarragon leaves, which must have been dried in the shade; take care that they do not heat; when it is ready, put it into the vinegar, adding a small bunch of cloves, and the zests of two lemons ; then stop the jar well, and set it in the sun fifteen days, or it may be put fwo or three times in a cool oven, when it will be ready for use. It has been usual to put in salt, but that is not neces- sary; pour off the vinegar, express the leaves, and filter it through grey paper, a fustian bag, or take a large hair search, cover it completely with double filtering paper, put in the vinegar softly by degrees; and when it runs clear, bottle and cork it well. Vinaigre Surard Is made as in the last receipt, in putting in a third less of the elder flowers than of the tarragon. Q 2

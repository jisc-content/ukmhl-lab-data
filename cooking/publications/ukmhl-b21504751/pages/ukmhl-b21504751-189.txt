Fish Jelly. Glace cle Poison. Rub lightly the bottom of a saucepan with butter; cover it with sliced onions and carrots; then add the remains and carcasses of fish, a little parsley and scal- lions, a bay-leaf, thyme, sweet basil, and a clove of garlic ; to these ingredients add a ladleful of fish soup; let it boil, put it upon a ho.t hearth or table ; let it sim- mer till it becomes a jelly; again add to it some fish soup, and pour it clear off into a clean saucepan, and let it simmer another hour; run it through a napkin ; reduce it to a jelly, and use it for glazing. CARP. Carp. De la Carpe en general. Carp of lakes and ponds are never good. It is ne- cessary to be able to distinguish this fish from the bream, which is much larger and flatter, the head smaller, the flesh less firm, and not so delicate. Carpe a la Chambor. Take a fine carp, scale it, and raise the skin, as is indicated for making Quenelles de Carpe (see article Farces); gut it without opening all the belly; take out the ears without spoiling the tongue, the skin being raised without touching the flesh; take out the strings or nerves of the tail, and lard it entirely with eel cut small, or half with truffles and carrots cut in the same manner; if it is not for maigre, lard it with lard truffles and carrots ; put it into a proper-sized fish kettle with a little braise-maigre (or vegetable soup, as indicated in the first recipe), and set it upon a moderate fire; put into a saucepan three basting spoonsful of espagnole-maigre, and half a bottle of white champagne; reduce and skim off all the fat; i 2

FRENCH COOKERY. 342 when it has undergone a fermentation, it is one of the most healthy viands, easy of digestion, and an excel- lent antiscorbutic. It is cut in thin slices to appear like narrow ribbons; some lay them to sweat upon cloths in the shade before they pack ; others cut them over the cask and pack them immediately; they must be spread equally with the hand in layers of three or four inches, the cask being first covered with common salt; upon every layer, a sufficient quantity of salt is strewed, with a few juniper berries or carraway seeds to aromatize it; it must be well arranged, either by the hand, a wooden pestle, or a man booted to tread it down; the work is continued from layer to layer, till the cask is filled, when another layer of salt covers the whole ; the proper quantity of salt to be used is a pound to fifty or sixty of cabbage; over the last salt- ing is spread the outer leaves of the cabbage, and over them a wet cloth; the head of the cask is then put in, and a considerable weight is laid upon it to prevent the cabbage from rising during the fermentation. Four or five inches ought to remain empty above the head of the cask, into which a wooden spicket should be introduced, by which to allow the cabbage water to run off, which is extremely fcetid and thick. This water must be replaced by introducing or filling it with salt water or pickle, and this must be done every three or four days, till it runs off clear, and has no bad smell; this takes place generally in about fifteen days, when the cask is in a cool place. The cask ought to be filled up every month with pickle, and the cloth changed every two: it is necessary that the pickle should al- ways be an inch or two above the croute, and care must be taken that there is no space left between the croute and the cask, so that it is necessary to pack it well. Prepared in this manner, and kept in a cool place, the croute keeps throughout the winter. It tastes acid, and most people come to like it, but those who do not, have only to steep it longer in hot water before it is cooked.

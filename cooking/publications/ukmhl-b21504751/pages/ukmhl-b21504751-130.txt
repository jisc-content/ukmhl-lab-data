Giblets of Leverets. Gibelottes de Lapereaux. Take half a pound of petit lard or nice bacon, cut it in large dice, which fry white in butter, drain and put a little flour in the butter to make a roux ; cut two leverets in pieces, and when the roux is of a fine white, put in the leverets; let them harden, and add the petit lard; moisten with half a bottle of white vine and some bouillon or water; add salt, pepper, a nunch of parsley and young onions, a clove, a bay leaf, and a clove of garlic; while cooking put in mushrooms, skim, and take out the sweet herbs; if the sauce is too thin, take out some and reduce it. Giblets with Eels. Gibelotte de Laperenu et d' Anguille. Proceed as above, adding an eel cut in junks, which must be cooked with the leverets, or separately, in the same seasoning. Rabbit with Pease. Lapereaux aux petits Pois.

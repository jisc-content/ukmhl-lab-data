327 WINES. To make Coffee. Cafe d I'Eau. Take the best coffee, the Mocha is always preferred, and burn it a fine equal deep brown, which should be done in a coffee roaster, and used immediately. The method to make it: For six cups of coffee, measure six cups of water into a coffee pot, and let it boil; put then in a little isinglass and six table spoonsful of cof- fee ; stir it well to allay the boiling; put it upon the fire, give it two or three boils, stirring it constantly with a spoon; take it off, put in a cup of cold water, and leave it to clear half an hour ; after which it may be poured off clear. Cream Coffee Cafe ala Creme. It is made in the same manner as coffee a I'eau, in adding half a spoonful of coffee to every cup of water: while the coffee is clearing, boil the cream and add the coffee as taste directs. Drinking Chocolate. Chocolat en Boisson. Take good chocolate de sante, or vanilla; the proper chocolate cups are marked for the quantity to be used, which is generally twelve and sixteen cups to the pound; if it is for chocolat a Veau, that is to be used with water, make twelve cups; if it is cream, sixteen; put into a chocolate pot as many cups of water as is necessary; and when it is nearly boiling, put in the proportion of chocolate in pieces, and mill it well; give it some boils, and put it to simmer upon hot cinders ; when ready to serve, mill it again till it froths ; serve it then in chocolate cups. WINES. Vins. Choice of Wines. Choix de Vins. Examine it well in the glass; it ought to be beauti- fully clear and of a ruby colour, of a fine flavour, free from particular taste, not clammy, strong without being pungent, a good body without harshness; these qualities constitute good wine, and are the only cha- racteristic signs that can be given ; all the rest depends on delicacy of taste.

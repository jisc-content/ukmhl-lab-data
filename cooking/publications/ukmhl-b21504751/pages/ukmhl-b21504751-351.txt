WINES. 333 of Benicaltos are sweet. There are also throughout Italy very fine wines, the most esteemed are those of Falerno, so vaunted by Horace. That of Albano, or primitive Rome, was the first wine made by the Ro- mans, and drunk at their solemn festivals; it is still in estimation ; this wine is light., pleasant, and seldom goes to the head; there are both white and red ; it is given to the sick. There are also Tuscan wines, that do not cede to any of the above, which are those of Mont Fiascone, which the Tuscans esteem above all others, but that is perhaps an error, as it is in no way superior to the others; but in that of intoxicating sooner. That of the territory of Venice is excellent and piquant. The Neapolitan wines the most known are those of Lacry- ma-Christi and Gaete; they, are red, light, and of a pleasant flavour. Management of Wines. The first racking or change of the wines ought to take place the middle of March, after the first vintage; for this purpose casks ought to be taken that have been lately emptied; rince them with the greatest care, and scrape out all the tartar that may be attached to them, as it is hurtful to the quality, delicacy, and perfume of the wine; they should be equally cleaned on the outsides, and the bottoms must be freed from the moss and mushrooms that may have grown on them: no- thing must be left dirty to the hoops; all must be cleaned with the greatest care: after these precautions the casks must be sulphured by a long match, narrower at one end than the other; it ought to be done when the weather is clear and dry; when ready to fill rince it with half a bottle of Cogniac brandy, drain it out well, and draw off the wines from the lees, with a bellows or pump ; then cork the wine with a new bung, wrapt round with lessived linen, that is, washed with the lees of wood ashes, not soap; as the casks are filled, arrange them upon their stands; great care must be taken to keep them full; every month they ought to be filled up, as they are continually losing: attention

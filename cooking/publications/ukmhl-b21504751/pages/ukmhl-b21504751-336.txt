Double Rose Water. Eau dc Rose Double. To make double rose water, put into the alembic the same quantity of roses, prepared in the same man- ner, having always care to change the refreshing wa- ter often : instead of river water for drawing it off, use simple rose water ; but should there not be enough, add a sufficient quantity of simple water, or more, that there may be enough in the bottom to prevent the leaves from sticking. If there is a bain marie then the distillation can be carried on with a quick fire, with- out any fear of accident; if the alembic is well luted, there may be drawn off as much at first as the quan- tity of rose water used in the distillation, that is to say, the quantity put in; by this means it will be very strong of the roses. If the bain marie is used, there will be no necessity to put in the straw; after the quantity of any distillation is drawn off, still four pints of a weaker quality may be procured, which is not worth the trouble where the flowers are plenty. Very strong Rose Water. Eau ardente de Rose. Take thirty pounds of picked roses; beat them in a marble mortar, and put them in an earthen vessel; beat four pounds of common salt, and lay in the roses in layers, upon which strew the salt, press them well down, and stop them quite close ; leave them for ten or twelve days, and distil them in the bain marie as the others, with a very quick fire; do not be anxious for a great quantity, but that it should be strong and have a fine perfume, and six drops in half a glass

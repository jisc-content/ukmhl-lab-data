Take nine or ten fine apples; pare ; take out the hearts, and cook them in a light syrup; scald a quar- ter of a pound of rice, and break it in milk; in wet- ting it, little by little, add a small bit of citron, a little salt, and sufficient sugar ; the rice ought to be firm ; take out the lemon peel, spread the rice upon a dish, put in the apples, and fill up the intervals with rice ; bake it in the oven till it is of a fine colour, and serve. Apples in Apricot-jam. Pommes a la Polonaise. Take a score of small rennets ; core without break- ing them ; do not force the apple-scoop but half way down, and then by the other end: pare and cut them in slices like halfpennies; cover a dish with apricot marmalade; then with the apples, and lay on more marmalade, and so on till it rises into a dome; glaze it with sifted sugar; put it into an oven; when done, wipe the edge of the dish, and serve. - Cotelettes en Surprise. Take some puft paste ; roll it out thin ; cut it in the form of hearts, as for cutlets of mutton in papillotes; put into that paste marmalade of apricots: solder the edges; give them the form of cutlets ; put them on a leaf, and bake them ; take a little pate dâ€™office, cut it in little bands, as bones of mutton; bake them with- out their taking any colour, which can be done in the mouth of the oven; when these cutlets are cooked, glaze them with the white of an egg, beaten; bruise some macaroons, and roll them in it; heat a skewer, and press it across the cutlets, to make them look as if they had been grilled; fix into them the bones of the pate d office: dress these cutlets in a crown on a dish, and serve; having first melted some red-currant jelly, which put to the cutlets as if it were gravy.

O 5 much in the beginning; put it in by little and little ; when they are enough put them into a pan with half a pound of sifted sugar upon a furnace, with very lit- tle fire to dry it: to know when it is enough, apply the back of the hand over it; if it does not stick, it may be taken out and put upon a leaf, dusted with fine sugar, and leave it to cool; cut several pieces upon a table, which ought to be rolled out as equally as possible to the size of a little finger; cut and form it into rings, and arrange them upon a grill of brass wire, which put upon a basin. This paste may be rolled out and covered slightly with apricot marma- lade, or any other, and put on a cover of the same paste ; cut it into lozenges or any other form; put it on the grill, and ice it with ice made of whites of eggs and sugar ; they must be iced with a spoon: let them drain ; arrange them upon paper, and put them into a quick oven.

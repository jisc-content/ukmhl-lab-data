RITZ AT THE SAVOY in the world. The fish, a fish-pie, with its macaroni and shrimps, was delicious, and then came the triumph of the dinner. Cased in its jelly covering, served on a great block of ice, melting like snow in the mouth, Maitre Escoffier’s mousse was an absolute masterpiece. The poulet, too, was as good to eat as it had sounded when M. Echenard had described it to me, and the parfait de foie gras was another delight. The asparagus and the ice were but the trifles of the dinner ; but the ice swan that bore the little mock peaches was a very graceful piece of table decoration. Mrs. Sphinx through dinner, while sipping her glass of Clicquot, had told me all the gossip of southern France ; of the dance at the club at Cannes at which she had arranged the cotillon and led it; of the races of the big yachts for the various cups ; of a magnificent scheme she had evolved, by which Gibraltar was to become a second Monte Carlo or Nice, a scheme which would involve a few batteries and casemates being removed to make way for a casino, and when we had drunk our cafe Turc, brought by the brightly clothed Asiatic, and when I had smoked my cigarette and my guest had despoiled the great basket of roses on the table, the band, which plays delightfully, softly, and unobtrusively, had come to the end of its programme, and it was time to be moving. This was the bill, a moderate one for such an admirable dinner :— Two couverts, is. ; bortch, 3s.; sole savoy, 6s. \ mousse jambon, 6s. ; poulet polonaise, 8s. ; salade, 2s.; foie gras, 6s. ; asperges verts, 7s. 6d.;

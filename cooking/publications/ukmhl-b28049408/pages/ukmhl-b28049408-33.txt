THE DIFFICULTIES OF DINING 5 I have always found that a shilling for every pound or part of a pound, or a shilling for each member of a party brings a “ thank you ” from the waiter at any first-class restaurant. I should be inclined to err a little on the liberal side of this scale ; for waiters do not have an easy life, are mainly dependent on the tips they get, and have it in their power to greatly add to, or detract from, the pleasure of a dinner. I always find that the man who talks about “spoiling the market,” in this respect is thinking of protecting his own pocket and not his neighbour’s. Finally—and I feel very much as if I had been preaching a sermon—I should, to put it all as shortly as possible, advise you, my brother simple Briton—not you, the experienced diners, who have been expressly warned off* from this lecture—in ordering your dinner to get the aid of the manager, and failing him the maitre d'hotel, never to be hustled by an underling into ordering a big dinner when you want a small one, and never to be afraid of asking what the composition of a dish is.

DINNERS AND DINERS 4- tion that dining does not mean simply eating, and at a good restaurant the dinner of the day is cooked to the minute for the groups at each separate table ; but it has the disadvantage that you have to eat a dinner ordered according to somebody elseâ€™s idea, and you have no choice as to length or composition. With a friendly maitre d'hotel to assist, the composing of a menu for a small dinner is a pleasure. To eat a table-d'hbte dinner is like landing a fish which has been hooked and played by some one else. M. Echenard, of the Carlton, in chatting over the vagaries of diners, shook his head over the want of knowledge of the wines that should be drunk with the various kinds of food. No man knows better what goes to make a perfect dinner than M. Echenard does, and as to the sinfulness of Britons in this particular, I quite agreed with him. In Paris no man dreams of drinking champagne, and nothing but champagne, for dinner ; but in London the climate and the taste of the fair sex go before orthodox rules. A tired man in our heavy atmosphere feels often that champagne is the one wine that will give him life again ; and as the ladies as a rule would think a dinner at a restaurant incomplete with- out champagne, ninety-nine out of a hundred Englishmen, in ordering a little dinner for two, turn instinctively to the champagne page of the wine-card. It is wrong, but until we get a new atmosphere and give up taking ladies out to dinner, champagne will be practically the only wine drunk at restaurants. On the subject of tips it is difficult to write.

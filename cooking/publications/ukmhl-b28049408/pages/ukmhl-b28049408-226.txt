98 DINNERS AND DINERS another guest made his appearance, and was hailed with joy. A most merry little Frenchman, with a very pretty wit, the wag of the party, was the newcomer, a fumiste into whose hands had been given the rearrangement of the Savoy kitchen, and who had also seen to the kitchen of the Cecil. He was a person of much import- ance, but he joked with the bare-armed serving- maid and made her blush, and threw Madame into a fit of laughter, and chaffed all the rest of us just as if he had been an ordinary individual and not a European celebrity. The chicken was as admirable as Madame had said it would be, and a great bowl of salad accompanied it; and then there came a sweet of some kind and cheese and excellent coffee—“all this we get for two shillings,” the Italian artist told me—and eventually when, after much hand- shaking, the greater portion of the guests had left, the fumiste came down to my end of the table and talked soldier’s talk, for he had been through the Great War, calling me “ Mon vieux colon,” while my host played the piano softly, and the lady who had sacrificed fame for the wedding-ring sang gently an old-fashioned French berceuse.

THE EAST ROOM, CRITERION 321 comfortable chairs, is cosy enough to have a soothing effect on a worse-tempered man than myself; and my patience was not much tried, for Sir George formally handed over Miss Bright- eyes to me not five minutes after the time at which I had ordered dinner. Miss Brighteyes looked very delightful in a dress of some white gossamer material with spangly adornments, which resembled diamonds, scattered over it. She wore a diamond brooch and a necklet of pearls with a diamond clasp, which had been her birthday presents from her father on her seventeenth and eighteenth birthdays. When Miss Brighteyes gets up on her society high horse she reduces me to comparative silence. While I was being given some details as to beautiful decorations at St. George’s on the oc- casion of her cousin’s wedding, I tried in vain to make Miss Brighteyes understand that the caviar she was eating deserved some attention, but she was not to be turned from her account of an aisle decorated with chrysanthemums and palms. Had a man dared to talk to me about a Duchess’s reception while he was drinking the delicious consomme I should have reproved him, and asked him to reserve conversation for the interludes of the repast ; but Miss Brighteyes, not thinking in the least of the serious responsi- bility of eating a good dinner, chattered gaily of Miss Mary Moore’s black and white dress at a supper-party in a restaurant a week gone by, and reeled off a catalogue of names from the Peerage of the men who had been her partners at a dance given by Lady Somebody or another.

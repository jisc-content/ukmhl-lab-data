104 DINNERS AND DINERS our neighbours. Half a dozen country gentlemen up to see the shire-horses at Islington, most of them confining their attention to those saddles of mutton which are the pride of Simpson’s, a barrister or two, the good-looking husband of a popular actress, and four or five well-known bookmakers, for Simpson’s is essentially sporting.

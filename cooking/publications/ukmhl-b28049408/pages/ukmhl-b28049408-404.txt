DINNERS AND DINERS 376 London. At the Spaten Beer restaurant in Piccadilly Circus a 3s. 6d. dinner is served, and at the one in Leicester Square a 2s. 6d. one. At the Viennese Caf6 in New Oxford Street, Ger- man and Viennese dishes are made a speciality. The City requires a book to itself; but it is more a place of lunching than of dining rooms. The Albion is in great favour for regimental and masonic dinners, and the masons also love the Ship and Turtle. Of quaint little old-fashioned houses, such as the Dr. Butler’s Head in Coleman Street, where “ the Corks ” often hold their secret, but not solemn meeting, there are many to be discovered by the curious and earnest diner.

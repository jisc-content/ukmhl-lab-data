The walls are painted a comfortable green colour, and there are warm crimson curtains to the windows. There are many pictures upon the walls; and a large sofa, leather- covered armchairs, and a writing-table in the bow of the window give an air of comfort to the room.

On the door side of the screen stands in one corner the regimental colour of the battalion finding the guard, and here, too, are the bearskin head-dresses of the officers. On the fireplace side of the screen is a table ready set for dinner, the clear glass decanters at the corners being filled with champagne, a silver- gilt vase forming the centre-piece, and candles in silver candelabra giving the necessary light.

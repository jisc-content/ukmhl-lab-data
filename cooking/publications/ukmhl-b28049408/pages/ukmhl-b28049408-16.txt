DINNERS AND DINERS Xll to carry out this commission for the Pall Mall Gazette^ I knew I was availing myself of the services of a thoroughly experienced, trustworthy, and capable commissioner, who would deal with the task entrusted to him in a pleasantly mixed anecdotal and critical spirit, while at the same time supplying useful guidance to persons want- ing to know where to dine and what they would have to pay. In the following pages it will be seen how well he carried out the duty he under- took, and I am able to add that cc Dinners and Diners ‚Äù had a great vogue and very wide popu- larity among the readers of the Pall Mall Gazette. There were very many requests from various quarters that they should be collected into book form, and this has now been done with some valuable additions included in the shape of recipes and other information. In these days, when the taste for dining at restaurants is so largely on the increase, I have little doubt that the republica- tion of these articles will be welcomed, and that they will supply not only interesting but useful information. The Editor of the Pall Mall Gazette. March 1899.

CHAPTER XXXVI THE HOTEL CONTINENTAL (REGENT STREET) Captain de Foreest of the American navy and his pretty wife who used to be Miss Carcanet— to her very old friends “ Brighteyes ”—were dining with me at the Continental last week. Mrs. de Foreest chose the place of dining herself. I had asked her to name any restaurant she chose, and she thought that for the sake of reminiscence she would go to the Continental. <CI dined out twice alone with a gentleman at a restaurant the year I came out,” said Mrs. de Foreest, as if she intended to shock her husband. He laughingly replied that he never could have believed that an English girl brought up in the best society could have committed such a crime, and then Mrs. de Foreest told him that if he was going to go to Chicago to apply for a divorce he had better name me in the proceedings. cc He made me do it and shocked poor mother terribly,” she said, and we all laughed, and Captain de Foreest said something neatly turned and charming, for which he got a little pat of approval on the hand.

THE H6TEL GREAT CENTRAL 273 I used to know at the East Room, must have cooked this with his own hands. Mrs. Tota pecked at everything, criticised everything impartially, and talked of Europe, Asia, and South Africa as she did so. Her husband went solidly and contentedly through the dinner, and when our first bottle of the Moet was finished, and I asked, in a general way, whether an imperial pint or another bottle would be looked upon with favour, he started with, “The doctor ” Rut Mrs. Tota did not^give him a chance to say more. “George, don’t be a hypocrite. If you two men want to drink another bottle between you, why don’t you say so, and not invent fables about the medical profession ? ” We did want that other bottle. This was the bill: Three dinners, 15s. ; two bottles 70A, £ 1 : 5s.; liqueurs, 3s.; total, £2 : 3s. After dinner, before we settled down for an hour in the lounge to listen to the band—an excellent band—Mr. Schmeider, the manager, at whose hotel in Manchester Mrs. Tota and her husband had once stayed, showed us the wonder- ful marble arches of the hall, the oak carvings after Grinling Gibbons, of the smoking-room’ the blue panels of the drawing-room, and all the other wonders of this most gorgeous hotel.

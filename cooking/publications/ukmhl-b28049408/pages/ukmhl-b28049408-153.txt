VERREY’S, REGENT STREET 125 cigarettes, 2d. 3 Perrier Jouet, 1889, 13s. ; total, £2:4:2- *** I asked Mr. Albert Krehl to give me an idea of any special dishes which Verrey’s is proud of, and pausing by the way to tell me how the house has always tried to wean its patrons from the cut from the joint at dejeuner time, and to induce them to eat small and light dinners, he said that entremets ices were one of the delights that Verrey’s prides itself on, dwelt lovingly on a description of an entrecote Olga, and then reeled off ceufs a la Russe, omelette foies de volaille, sole Polignac, filets de sole a la Belle Otero, glace Trianon, sole a la Verrey, which has a flavouring of Parmesan, moules a la Mariniere, poulet Parmentier en casserole. If the Messrs. Krehl counsel small dinners in the salle, they do not always do so for the private rooms upstairs. This is the menu of a dinner at which H.R.H. the Prince of Wales was present :— CEufs a la Kavigote (Vodkhi). Bisque d’ecrevisses. Consomme Okra. Rougets k la Muscovite. Selle de mouton de Galles. Haricots panaches. Tomates au gratin. Pommes soufflees. Timbale Lucullus. Ponds d’artichauts. Creme pistache. Grouse. Salad Rachel. Biscuit glace k la Verrey. Souffle de laitances. Dessert.

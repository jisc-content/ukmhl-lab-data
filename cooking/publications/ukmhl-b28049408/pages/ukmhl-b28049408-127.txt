99 A WALK IN SOHO have been roofed over and form a large dining- room added on to Burke’s original more modest- sized apartment. There are statuettes and palms in the hall, and there is a writing- and waiting- room on the first floor. On the first floors some handsome old ceilings look down on modern decorations which Burke would not have ap- preciated. In the dining-rooms all is in good taste, in grays and whites, and here we sat and eat a sumptuous meal for the Grumbler’s half- crown, in which sole and cutlets and quails played their appointed parts, and I talked of w the Club ” and Sir Joshua and Dr. Johnson, Goldsmith and Crabbe, and Garrick and Gibbon, and though the Grumbler winced now and again and shivered, he had not the pluck left in him to protest.

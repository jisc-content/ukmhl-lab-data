358 DINNERS AND DINERS was too strong for my taste, and chopped onion mixed with caviare does not, in my opinion, improve it. The hare soup was good and strong, the boiled beef, cut very thick and served on a plated dish, was sufficiently tender and sufficiently hot; the potatoes, Miss Belle said, were well cooked ; and the horse-radish sauce had a curious softness of taste, which, I should fancy, was due to a mixture of mashed parsnips. Be that as it may, it was an excellent sauce. I ate the brown bread cut from a long loaf, but Miss Belle patronised the serpentine little rolls. The brown beer, served stone cold in great glasses of the form of old-fashioned champagne glasses, was excellent. For the macaroni, which made its appearance, like the beef, on a silvered plate, I am afraid I cannot say a good word, for it was, judged by Italian standard, far too hard. My bill was given me without the items put against the prices, and as Miss Belle was in a hurry to get to her theatre, I did not ask questions. Here it is, as given me: â€” 4d., is. 6d., 6d., id., 2d., is. 6d., is. 4d., is. 8d. Total, 7s. id. When we shook hands on parting, Miss Belle laughingly said that she hoped a year hence to dine with me again.

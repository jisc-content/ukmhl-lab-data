28 DINNERS AND DINERS of Royalty would have to feed in the supple- mentary rooms, Mrs. Sphinx should have that table. The ordering of the dinner came next, and to take on one’s self the responsibility of this with such a chef as Maitre Escoffier in the kitchen is no small matter. Hors-cToeuvre^ of course, and then I suggested Bortch as the soup, for of all the restaurants where they make this excellent Russian dish the Savoy takes the palm. Timbales de filets de sole a la Savoy, hinted M. Echenard, and though I didn’t quite know what that was, it sounded well, and went down on the slip of paper. I wanted a mousse for the entree, for I know that there are no such mousses to be got elsewhere as the Maitre can make ; and then M. Echenard suggested Poulet de grain Polonaise, and as he described the method of cooking, and how the juices of the liver soaked into the bird, and the essence of the chicken permeated the liver, I gave up my first idea of the celebrated canard en chemise. That was my idea of a little dinner, but M. Echenard insisted on the finishing touches being administered by a parfait de foie gras, English asparagus, and peches glacees vanille. It was a dinner that had, perhaps, an unusual amount of cold dishes in it; but it is one of the customs of Savoy cookery to have, if possible, one cold dish at least in the menu, for, the hot dishes being served scrupulously unadorned, the cold ones give M. Escoffier and his staff a chance what they can do in the way of of showing decoration.

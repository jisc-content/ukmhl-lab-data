PAGANI’S, GREAT PORTLAND STREET 227 *** I asked M. Meschini if he would be so kind as to give me the recette for the filets de sole Pagani, and here it is just as he wrote it down for me. Filets sole Pagani The sole is first of all filleted, and with the bones, some mussels, and a little white wine, a fumee de poisson is made in which the fillets of the sole are then cooked. The cook takes this cuisson, and by adding some well - chopped fresh mushrooms, makes with that what he calls a reduction; to this he adds some velout'e, little cream, fresh butter, some lemon juice, pepper and salt, and cooks the whole together till well mixed, then passes it a P'etamine. With this the sauce is made. The cooked fillets of sole and eight or ten mussels are then placed ready on a silver dish, and the above made sauce poured over them. The top is well sprinkled with fresh Parmesan cheese, and after allowing them to gratiner for a minute or two, are ready to be put on the customer’s table.

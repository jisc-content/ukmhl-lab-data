I32 DINNERS AND DINERS informants had said, a wonderful dinner for the price. Dinner finished and my bill paid—dinner, 2s. 6d.; wine, is. qd.; cafe, 3d.; liqueur, 6d.; total, 5s.—I asked Signor Baglioni, one of the proprietors, a prosperous-looking gentleman with a curly moustache and spreading whiskers, some questions about his restaurant. Every day the restaurant is full and people have to be turned away—and when I went up the narrow little stairs and looked round I saw that the upstairs rooms were full of diners—and the regret of himself and of his partner is that they cannot enlarge their premises. Signor Baglioni was one of Mr. Ritz’s lieutenants at the Savoy, and Signor Molinari was a well-known chef before he became a restaurant proprietor. The cook of the restaurant is Baghalo, who was chef de cuisine at one time to the Prince of Monaco, and I was right when I detected the hand of the master in the soup and the crisp little sole. Any one who does not mind the noise, the close quarters at table, and the unaristocratic neighbourhood will find a dinner at the Caf6 d’ltalie a pleasant experience.

THE CAVOUR, LEICESTER SQUARE 253 the country, had time to give his wife something to eat before going off to catch another train ; a white-bearded gentleman was entertaining two pretty daughters in evening dresses, and was desperately afraid that they would not get to the theatre in time to see the curtain rise. A very pretty lady, with a hat of peacocks’ feathers and a great bow rising from it, was an actress “resting.” The rest of the diners who filled the room were all good, respectable citizens and citizenesses, in fine broadcloth and silk, but none of their faces was familiar to us through the pages of the illustrated papers. This was the bill paid by the chairman :— Six dinners at 5s., £1 : 10s. 3 three bottles Pommery, ’89, £2 : 2s.; one seltzer, 6d. ; five cafes, 2s. 6d. ; six liqueurs, 4s. 6d. ; total, ^3 : t9 : 6. M. Philippe has a little pleasure-ground attached to the restaurant, a plot of kitchen garden and an orangery, the vegetables and herbs and fruit from which must cost him about a thousand times their value at Covent Garden. But it is Philippe’s hobby, and he likes to be able to give any favoured customer a bunch of mignonette grown in a garden within thirty yards of Leicester Square. At night the blazing cressets of the Alhambra and the gas decorations of Daly’s light this strange little bit of rus in urbe, and when one wonders at a practical man keeping such desirable building land for such a purpose, M. Philippe shrugs his shoulders and says, w The earth he grow every day more valuable.”

DINNERS AND DINERS 240 lamps, “ Infant Incubator,” fixed itself on my attention, and I found myself wondering what an infant incubator could be like. The crowd outside had increased in number. There seemed to be many ladies in white with white hats amongst it; there was occasionally a gleam of white shirt fronts ; little boys in straw hats and Eton collars dived into the thick, and then reappeared ; the programme boys came and went. The band was hammering away at the “Mikado.” Two pretty girls in black dresses with wide white collars, one with a white sailor hat, one with a black one, paused outside to watch us dining. I should have liked to ask them in to dine, for I was feeling very lonely, but I remembered British conventionality, and forbore. The cotelette d'agneau a la Bellevue which the waiter brought me was hot and well cooked, but I do not think that the chicken, a wing of which succeeded the cutlet, could have lived a very happy life. I think it must have been consumptive. The restaurant was beginning to empty now, the guests filing out in twos and threes, and vanishing into the parti-coloured crowd ; and still the Wheel, with its silent power, turned, and still the “ Infant Incubator ” danced before my eyes. The beans, the ice, and the peach with which I finished my dinner were all good—I refused the pouding Victoria which was on the menu ; and after sipping my coffee and paying my bill —one dinner, 7s. 6d. ; one pint 239, 6s. 6d. ; liqueur, 2s. ; total, 16s.—I obeyed an irresistible impulse and went over to see what an infant incubator was like.

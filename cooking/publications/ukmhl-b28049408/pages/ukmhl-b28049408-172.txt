DINNERS AND DINERS 44 cc C’est le patron,” said one of the waiters, and I promptly introduced myself to him, and began to cross-examine him as to the identity of his clients, for the room was filling very quickly. M. Brice sat on a chair by my table, which now had its full complement of diners, for the burly, bearded Frenchman, the other with the hair combed down on to his forehead, and a third with a carefully curled moustache, had taken the three vacant places. “That,” said M. Brice, indicating a dark gentleman with a curled moustache,cc is Chaudoir, the chef d'orchestre at Sergeant Sole.” “ What ? ” I said, bluntly enough. u At Sergeant Sole, where they are blacked.” A sudden inspiration that Sergeant Sole was St. James’s Hall came to me. “ And that,” pointing to a gentleman with a red tie, cc is the gentleman who does the social- istic writing for the Pall Mall.” Three clean-shaven gentlemen were vaguely described as cc artists,” and after gazing at a lady in black with white hair for some time, M. Brice said, cc That is an old woman.” The two gentle- men sitting opposite this lady were the Messieurs Chose, of a firm in Old Broad Street, and the three Frenchmen at my table were big men in the greengrocery line, who come over two or three times a year to Covent Garden. A clean-shaven, prosperous-looking gentleman, with a young lady in black, entered just then, and a note of admiration came into M. Brice’s voice as he told me that this was the coachman of the Baron Alfred de Rothschild.

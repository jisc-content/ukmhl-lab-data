DINNERS AND DINERS 8o there, and very often looked in at supper-time. It is a huge place, a maze of many rooms, with placards at the corners of the passages directing one to the various bars and dining-halls. The youth was evidently an habitue, and when we came to a buffet abundantly covered with cold meats, fish, and fruits, by which stood a cook in white cap and jacket, he turned to the left, and we were in a great hall with cream-coloured walls and red morocco chairs and a red carpet. Over the door by which we entered is a balcony divided into three compartments, with a clock on the balcony railings, and at the other end of the hall squares of looking-glass are inserted in the wall as if they were windows. The pillars which support the roof have as capitals groups of ladies, in scanty attire ; a not very flourishing palm has the place of honour in the centre of the room, and along the wall are curved red lounges. A little platform for the orchestra is hidden away in a corner. The majority of the people dining were in morning dress, solid City men most of them, I thought. One paterfamilias was giving his whole family dinner. Some of the men dining by themselves read the evening papers as they took their meal. We seated ourselves at a little table for two, and the waiter placed before me the menu of the 3s. 6d. old English dinner, which ran thus :â€” Sardines and olives. Vegetable soup. Oxtail. Boiled cod and egg sauce.

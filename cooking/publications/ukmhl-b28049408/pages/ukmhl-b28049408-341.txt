I pleaded the statute of limitations, for it was CHAPTER XLV THE CRITERION (PICCADILLY CIRCUS) Mrs. de Foreest, her husband, Lady Carcanet, and Sir George were drinking five-o’clock tea with me in the restaurant of the Criterion, which forms one of the snuggest tea-rooms in London ; or rather I should write that the two ladies and the Captain partook of the cup that cheers but does not inebriate, and Sir George looked on and called the beverage cat-lap. “When you brought me to dine here you promised that you would some day take me over the whole of the house,” said Miss Brighteyes that was, and her husband laughingly said that he had now discovered the second place to which I had taken an unchaperoned young lady, and that he should make a note of it; and Lady Carcanet encouraged him, saying that this un- conventional jaunt had been arranged behind her back, and that the conspirators had treacherously waited until she had gone to Brighton. Sir George took a leaf from Brer Rabbit’s book and lay low.

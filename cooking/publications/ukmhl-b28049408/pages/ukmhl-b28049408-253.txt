PAGANFS, GREAT PORTLAND STREET 225 shrimps, which, with fresh mushrooms and moules, help to give a distinctiveness to this excellent dish. “ How was I to know a shrimp without his head and tail and scales?” said Mrs. Tota, when M. Meschini had moved on. Mrs. Tota ate some of the tournedos truffles^ and gave her opinion that the truffles were perfectly heavenly ; but I preferred to wait for the partridge and its casserole, with all its savoury surroundings. M. Notari, the chef, is an artist in his kitchen, and nowhere in London could we have found a better-cooked bird. To establish my claim to be critical, I said that I had tasted better souffles, but Mrs. Tota, telling me that I was a pampered Sybarite, ate her helping with perfect content. The two pints of Veuve Clicquot we drank were excellent, and with a Biscuit Pagani, two cups of Cafe Pagani and liqueurs, we ended a very good dinner. I paid my bill : Bread and butter, 4d. ; hors- d’oeuvre, 6d.; soup, is. 6d.; fish, 2S. ; joint, 2s. ; game, 5s.; vegetables, is.; sweets, is. 6d.; ices,is.; salad, 1 od.; wine, 14s.; coffee,is.; liqueurs, 2s.6d.; total, £ 1 : 13 : 2, and then asked M. Meschini to take us upstairs and show us the private dining- room, which is known as the artists’ room. When we came to the little room with its ruby velvet curtains and mantel drapings, its squares of what looks like brown paper, at about the height of a man’s head, covered with draw- ings and writings, and protected by glass, its framed drawings and paintings, Mrs. Tota turned to me and asked me if I often brought my invalid maiden aunt to dine here.

PRINCES’ HALL, PICCADILLY 69 an ex-Gaiety girl whose marriage to a Guards- man was for ten days the talk of the town; a youngster whose good looks have won him a very rich but not too young wife—and there I had to pause, for though the room was full of well-dressed, smart-looking people, I knew no more of them by name.

The turtle soup was good undoubtedly, as good as at any City dinner, with its jade- coloured semi-solid floating in the darker liquor, and we praised that unreservedly, but I was told that I was in a carping mood because I stated that I like my salmon as plainly cooked as pos- sible. As to the fricassee, I liked it immensely ; but Mrs. Daffodil, because her shoe pinched, or for some other good reason, said that she hated truffles. The lamb, the most delicate little selle d'agneau de lait, with the potatoes and the dark green salad relieved by the crimson of the beet- root, was admirable. English asparagus never can be anything but good, and though my hostess insisted on my eating a cherry from among the friandises, I left the sweets, as is my custom, alone. And the bill.

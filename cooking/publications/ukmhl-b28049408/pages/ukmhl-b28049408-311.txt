THE MIDLAND HOTEL, ST. PANCRAS 283 French restaurant at the hotel asking him to keep a table for me, and to order a small dinner for two. A cab with a pile of boxes on the top brought Miss Dainty with her bouquets, and her maid, and Jack, the fighting dog, to the station. u Are you going to take the dog ?” I asked ; and Miss Dainty said, £C Certainly. I am going to take him to bite the Custom-house officers if they interfere with my seal-skin cloak.” Of course, such a reason as this was unanswerable. The maid and the baggage and the dog were left on the platform, the former being given strict injunctions to keep a watchful eye on the two latter, and I took Miss Dainty off to the hotel. Through the long curving corridor, with its brightly-painted walls and blaze .of electric light, we went to the lift, and were quickly deposited on the first floor, where the restaurant is. As a rule one does not expect to get a good dinner at a railway hotel 3 but I knew that the Midland was one of the exceptions which prove the rule, and that I had not done wrong in asking Miss Dainty to dine with me there. The room, a fine large saloon, has a comfortable red paper with handsomely framed mirrors to break the monotony of its surface, and what painting there is on pillars and cornice has some- thing of an Egyptian brilliancy of colour. At one end a semicircular screen of curtains shuts off the serving-room. At the other end great doors lead into a drawing-room. The chairs, of red velvet, have a comfortable look. The lights on the tables are electric globes with yellow shades.

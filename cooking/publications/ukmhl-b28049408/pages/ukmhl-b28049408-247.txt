THE SHIP, GREENWICH 219 mistress’s eye, made fine trencher play with two bones. There was a look of reproach in the veteran waiter’s eye when we came back and found the crab omelette and salmon cutlets a Vindienne were cooling. I tried to draw Miss Dainty’s attention away from Jack. I told her how Mr. Punch had called her Faustine, and had written a page about her ; but when she found there was nothing to quote in her book of press notices she lost all interest in the hump-backed gentleman. With the advent of the plain whitebait a new danger to Jack arose. A turtle was brought by three men on to the lawn and turned loose, and Miss Dainty had to go out and assure herself that Jack was not frightened, and that the turtle was not meditating an attack upon him. The turtle was found to be a harmless and interesting insect, and having been shown, with practical illustrations, how the beast was captured by savages, Miss Dainty took great pity on it, collected water in the soup-plate from the fountain, poured it over its head, and tried to induce it to drink, which the turtle steadfastly refused to do. The veteran waiter was stern when we returned and found the devilled whitebait on the table. I told him to bring the coffee and liqueurs and bill out into the garden, because Miss Dainty, having been separated from her dog so long, wanted to nurse and pet him. This was the bill:—Two dinners, 14s.; one Pommery, 18s.; two liqueurs, is. 6d. ; coffee, is.; attendance, is.; total, £1 : 15 : 6.

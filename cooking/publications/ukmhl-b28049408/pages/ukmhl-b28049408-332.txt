DINNERS AND DINERS 304 For an instance, at the Grand Hotel on the day of my inquiry, among other delicacies, whitebait, and the curry of Madras, pheasants, and the toothsome pigeon were served ; while at the Metropole dominos de foie gras would have tempted your appetite, and you would have ended a capital dinner with partridges and various sweets. This is how you would have fared at the Hotel Victoria :â€” Canapes de caviar Moscovite. Consomme Marquise. Creme Chantilly. Sole Montreuil. Blanchailles a la Diable. Zephires de faisan Princesse. Tournedos Ventadour. Selle de mouton au laver. Dindonneau Baltimore. Haricots verts sautes au beurre. Pommes fondantes. Pluviers dores bardes sur croutes. Salades panachees. Mince pies. Biscuits glaces vanille. Langue de chat. Dessert. Should you arrive at Victoria Station and not at Charing Cross you will find the Grosvenor Hotel, under the management of the Gordon Hotels Company, newly swept and garnished. In this hotel is a restaurant with a separate kitchen from that in which the meals for the table d'hote are prepared, and those who care for such vanities and weaknesses of the flesh as French dishes may be counted to bespeak lightly of it.

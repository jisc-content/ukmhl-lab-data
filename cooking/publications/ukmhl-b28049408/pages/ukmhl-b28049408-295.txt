FRASCATI’S, OXFORD STREET 267 truffles and tiny mushrooms and many other good things, and my old tutor, who ate it, said that it was excellent. The little tables on the ground floor had all filled by now, and the lady behind the long bar, with piles of plates on it, and with a long line of looking-glasses behind it reflecting many bottles, was very busy. A subdued hum of talking and the faint rattle of knives and forks against crockery mixed with the music of the band. The pheasant was a fine plump bird ; the ice was excellent. I insisted on my old tutor having a glass of port to end his dinner, and after much pressing—for one glass of wine is all he allows himself as a rule at a meal—he was over-per- suaded. Then he rubbed his hands and beamed, and told me stories of his own schoolboyhood: how he once fought another boy, now a Colonial Governor, and smote him so severely on the nose that it bled ; and of a dreadful escapade, which still weighs on his mind—nothing less than going to see a race-meeting, and being subsequently soundly birched. This was the bill I paid:—Two dinners at 5s., 1 os.; one bottle 6a, 7s.; half-bottle 61, 5s. 6d. ; total, ^1:2:6. My old tutor went away with his enthusiasm of the summer still unimpaired ; and when next I have a country cousin to take out to dinner I shall go to Frascati’s.

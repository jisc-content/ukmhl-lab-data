258 DINNERS AND DINERS room, my coat and hat were taken from me and put in a locker in the hall, and we settled ourselves down at a corner table in the room, dimly lighted by electric globes and by the red- shaded candles on the tables. It is a most effective room, as I pointed out to Miss Bright- eyes, with its oil-paintings of figure-subjects framed in dark wood over the mantelpieces, its line of muslin-draped windows down one side, and on the other mirrors and the comptoir of dark wood, where between two palms one catches a glimpse, under the glow of a red-shaded lamp, of the pretty face of the lady enthroned there. A screen of old gold comes pleasantly into the scheme of colour. u Isn’t it delightfully im- proper to be dining alone with a gentleman in a restaurant! I do wish Madame Quelquechose could see me now,” Miss Brighteyes remarked, as I looked through the three menus, one at 1 os. 6d., one at 7s. 6d., and one at 6s. 6d. Madame Quelquechose was, I may state, the head of the celebrated Parisian school at which Miss Brighteyes had finished her education. As the young lady had to be at Covent Garden at eight, and it was now seven, I thought the shortest of the menus—the 6s. 6d. one— would suffice. Besides, I hold that the best dinners are always short ones. Here it is :— Hors-d’oeuvre varies. Consomme Sevigne. Paupiettes de merlans Heloi'se. Tournedos grilles Judic. Poularde rotie. Salade.

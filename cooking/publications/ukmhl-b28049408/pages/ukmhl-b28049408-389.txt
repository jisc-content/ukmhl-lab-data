361 CHALLIS’S, RUPERT STREET the clock, and three waiters stood by the little tables at the end of the room and looked at me and talked in whispers to each other. The minute-hand grew gradually up to the hour, and as it did so I sank down into the depths of de- spondency. My friend had deserted me, basely deserted me, or else he was killed, run over perhaps, or struck by a falling chimney. The minute-hand went on to five minutes past, the member in the armchair snored gently and regu- larly, the waiters seemed to look at me pityingly. Pity from a waiter I could not endure. I got up and went over to one of the little tables and sat down. The waiters looked placidly pleased. I was relieving the monotony of their lives. I said I would take the club dinner and a whisky- and-soda, and when two of the waiters faded away, the other remained on guard, no doubt to prevent me from changing my mind and making my escape. I put my elbows on the table, and my head in my hands, and felt that I was indeed the morose hero of pathetic Christmas magazine literature. My soup was brought, and a whisky-and- soda deposited tenderly by the side of the plate, when the door was flung open, and in came my missing friend clothed in evening dress, white tie, white waistcoat and all, and radiant. There was an engagement he had forgotten : he was taking a lady to dine at Challis’s—little place of Baker’s—a thousand apologies—I must cancel club dinner and come over—couldn’t keep the lady waiting — see me again in two minutes. And he was out of the room again like a well- dressed whirlwind.

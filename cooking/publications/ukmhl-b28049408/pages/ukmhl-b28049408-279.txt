THE CAVOUR, LEICESTER SQUARE 251 the room cool. Beyond this room is another one, newly built, also light in colour, and with many mirrors. As soon as we were seated, M. Philippe came bustling up. He is a very busy man, for he believes in the adage as to doing things well; and, therefore, he is up at five every morning, and goes the round of the markets, and in his own restaurant is his own maitre cT hotel. Yet, busy as he is, he finds time to devote much attention to Freemasonry, and his list of sub- scriptions to the various Masonic charities has generally the biggest total of any sent in. He was supposed in this charitable competition to have been, on one occasion, outstripped by another worker in the cause, and we immedi- ately began to chaff him on the subject. M. Philippe acknowledged that a march had been stolen on him ; but to make up for it he had been eminently successful in securing the admis- sion of a little girl to one of the masonic institu- tions. cc She got in on top of our poll,” was his way of putting it. The feast he had prepared for us was as follows :— Hors-d’oeuvre. La petite marmite. Filets de soles Mornay. Whitebait. Poulet saute Portugaise. Cotes de mouton en Bellevue. Canetons d’Aylesbury. Petits pois fran^aise. Salade. Haricots verts. Fromages. Dessert.

DINNERS AND DINERS 222 George looked at me with the corners of his mouth drawn up by a suppressed smile, and his left eyebrow twitched as if he felt inclined to wink. I poured oil on the troubled waters. If Mrs. Tota, with her husband’s permission, would dine with me at Pagani’s on Sunday we would dine in the public dining-room on the first floor, and look afterwards at the drawings and signa- tures in the celebrated little room on the second floor. “It is real good of you to take the wife out,” said George, as he saw me off the premises. “ I hate going out at night, as you know, but she enjoys it all thoroughly. She chattered about that last dinner for a good month.” On the Saturday I went to Pagani’s, secured a table for the next evening in the room on the first floor, a very pretty dining-room with soft blue curtains to the windows, a blue paper on the walls, shaded electric lights, and a little bow- window at the back, which makes the snuggest of nooks. Then M. Giuseppe Pagani, one of the two proprietors, having appeared, we talked over the important matter of the menu. The difficulty that vexed our minds was whether filets de sole Pagani or turbot a la Pellegrini would best suit a lady’s appetite. Finally the sole won the day. I hesitated a moment over the Bortsch soup, for it has become almost as much a standing dish as croute-au-pot in most restaurants ; but Bortsch is the customary Sunday soup at Pagani’s, so it had to be included in the menu.

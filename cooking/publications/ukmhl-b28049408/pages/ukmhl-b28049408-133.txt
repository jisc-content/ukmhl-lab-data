SIMPSON’S, THE STRAND 105 Liebfraumilch, 12s. ; attendance, yd. ; total, l1 ■ 1 = 3- Having a half-hour to spare and feeling the gentle laziness that comes with good digestion we lingered at our table, and presently William, who was for many years waiter at the Cock, having finished his duties on the other side of the room, came across and chatted to us, and when William chooses to be reminiscent, he can tell anecdotes of most of the past celebrities of London. There always seems to be a waiter of more than ordinary note at Simpson’s, for of old days Charles Flowerdew was the potentate of the ladies’ dining-room, a large well-lighted apartment on the first floor, and many men of light and leading used to eat their sole or turbot for preference then in that room in order to take a pinch of snuff from his box and listen to his stories told with much circumstance and emphasis. As we sat on, after the other lunchers had left, Mr. Crathie, tall, clean-shaved, except for narrow side whiskers, with a white head of hair in which a ruddy tint still lingers, found us, and under his guidance we went upstairs and peeped through the glass doors into the room where half a dozen games of chess were being played. Mr. Crathie, who has been proprietor and, later, managing director of Simpson’s for half a long lifetime, told us something of the history of the place, how it originally consisted only of a cigar-shop on the ground floor and the chess divan above, how he purchased it and formed it into a small company, and how now a larger company, which also owns the Golden Cross, has control of it.

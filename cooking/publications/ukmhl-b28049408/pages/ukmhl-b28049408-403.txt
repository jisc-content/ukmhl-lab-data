MY SINS OF OMISSION 375 Washington in Oxford Street, near Oxford Circus ? If you have not, you do not yet know your dining London. Every great “sight of London,” the British Museum, the Abbey, and Houses of Parliament, and every railway station gathers near it a little cluster of restaurants. Opposite Victoria Station is a line of restaurants, all of which loudly proclaim that they are fine places for a hungry man to enter. An epicure, a genuine one, told me that once having missed his train, he had dined and dined well and cheaply at one of them, but I am not certain which it was. Zappeloni’s which advertises a 3s. dinner was, I fancy, the restaurant. Hard by, in Victoria Street, Odone’s clean little restaurant, and the Victorian, a new vegetarian restaurant, are to be found. Of Italian restaurants there are hundreds in London. Torrino’s in Oxford Street is so well and favourably known that I need scarcely do more than allude to it. The Menasli Brothers at the Previtali in Arundel Street, just off Coventry Street, will give you dinner for 5s. or 3s. 6d., and across the narrow street Gedda’s charges 2s. 6d. I have dined at one time or another at Gianella’s in Oxford Street, at the Queen’s in Sloane Square, at Veglio’s in the Euston Road, at the Colali Bros. Oxford Restaurant in the Edgware Road, at Toriani’s in the Brompton Road, and at Reggiori’s in Chapel Street, and have found their 2s. 6d. or 3s. dinners good meals at the price. German beer halls which are also eating- places are springing up like mushrooms all over

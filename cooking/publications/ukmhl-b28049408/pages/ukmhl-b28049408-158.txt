The windows looking on to the street are gay with coloured glass and are draped with artistic chintz, a double door prevents any stray draughts finding their way into the room, the walls are covered with a paper of light blue and gold, and decorated with mirrors. The light comes from electric globes hung from the ceiling. Down each side of the room is a row of tables, each seating four diners. This was the menu:— Hors-d’oeuvre varies. Potages. Consomme Brunoise, creme Turque. Poisson. Soles a la Colbert. Entrees. Tournedos Proven^ale. Vegetables. Haricots verts au beurre. Spagetti au jus. Rods. Volailles & la broche. Salade. Entremets. Glace au liqueur.

Lyons in his den one fine spring day and told him that “Dinners and Diners ” was going to appear in book form. He showed no visible sign of emotion. Next I asked him if he would tell me what the plats were that the Tro- cadero kitchen prided itself on, and if he would give me the recette of supreme de sole Trocad'ero of which I had a pleasant memory. He kindly said that I should have a list of the dishes, and not one but two recettes if I wanted them. My remark was “ Thank you.” Caviar glace, huitres a la Orientate, potage Rodisi, soles a la Glover, cotelettes de saumon a la Nantua, chapon de Bresse a la Trocad'ero, poularde a la Montique, selle d'agneau a la Lyon d’or, salade d'Or say, asperges nouvelles Milanaises form a little list from which an admirable dinner could be designed. These are the recettes of supreme de sole Trocad'ero and Saddle of Lamb a la Pera— Supremes de Sole Trocadero Take two fillets of soles and stuff them with fish forced meat, put one slice of smoked salmon on the top of each, roll them together, then take a small saute pan well buttered, and place the fillets in it, with salt, pepper, half a wineglassful of white wine, and the juice of half a lemon, cover it and let it simmer for from eighteen to twenty minutes.

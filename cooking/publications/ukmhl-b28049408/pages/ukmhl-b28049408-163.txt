i35 WILLIS’S ROOMS, KING STREET Alhambra, and Mr. Morton of the Palace, smiling mentally at the disappointment in store for her, for “behind the scenes” at the big variety theatres is ruled with an iron discipline, and told her I was sorry that, as the Amphitryon and the Maison Doree and the Cercle de Luxe had ceased to exist in their original form, I could not help her in that. Miss Morgan looked very blank ; evidently the club chapter was one of her pet ones, and I told her, hoping to comfort her, that a number of the former patrons of the Amphitryon now dine regularly at Willis’s rooms; that M. Edouard Fayat, who was once at the Amphitryon, is manager and proprietor ; and that if she did not mind a very dull dog as host, and if 8.30 was not too late, I should be very glad if she would dine with me there that evening, and Miss Morgan smiled again and said, “Thank you very much.” I called at Willis’s on my way homeward to dress and saw M. Fayat, clean-shaved and rotund, with a touch of the P'tit Caporal about him and tried to order dinner ; but I found my tired brain had no more imagination for a menu than it had for a paragraph, and when M. Fayat asked whether I would leave the dinner to him I was glad to do so, premising that it must not be an expensive one. All the tables in the upstairs rooms were taken, but there was a comfortable one downstairs for two which I could have, and to be sure of the celebrities who usually dined I looked through the book where the names of the givers of dinners are recorded.

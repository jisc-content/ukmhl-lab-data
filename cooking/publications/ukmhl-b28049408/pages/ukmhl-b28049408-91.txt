QUEEN S HOTEL, LEICESTER SQUARE 63 to stop talking, and the Surgeon-Major, very unfairly, seized the opportunity of giving me his history of Leicester Square, which commenced with the decoration in scarlet spots of the statue of George I., and ranged over many other stirring incidents, such as the scenes when the various national fighting songs were played and sung at the Alhambra during the Franco-Prussian War, and the stormy evening when the barricades that fenced off “Mrs. Chant’s promenade” at the Empire were demolished. I had still much interesting history to tell him as to Leicester House in the old days—anecdotes of Elizabeth 8>ueen of Bohemia, who died there ; of Lady arlisle, who was arrested there; of the “butcher ” Cumberland, who was born there, and of the Princess Augusta who was married there ; but I was never given a chance, for the Surgeon-Major had so much to say about the “ Judge and Jury,” and other places which have made more recent history in Leicester Square, that I never was allowed to speak a word over our coffee and brandy. I paid the bill. Two dinners, 10s. ; two cafes, is. ; one bottle 99, 15s. ; two liqueurs, 2s. ; total, ^i:8s. The Surgeon-Major is a good fellow ; no doubt he is a clever surgeon. But as an audience to tell interesting antiquarian facts to he is an absolute fraud.

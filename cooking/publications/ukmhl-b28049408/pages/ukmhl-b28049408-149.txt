VERREY’S, REGENT STREET 121 Washington said she would. cc If I may, I will come and call for you at a little before eight,” I said promptly, and Mrs. Washington wanted to know whether there were bandits in Regent Street. Eventually, I was told that if I was cooling my feet in the entrance at 8 to a second I should have the felicity of helping her out of her cab. To give Mrs. Washington a satisfactory dinner is not one of the easiest things in the world, for she understands the art of dining, and is, as well, a most excellent cook herself with a chafing dish when she chooses ; so it was with a full sense of the responsibility I had incurred that I sought Mr. Krehl, the elder of the two brothers in whose hands Verrey’s now is, and found him in the cafe. He knew Mrs. Washington, of course, and hearing that it was she who was to be my guest, he called in his brother Albert, almost a twin in resemblance to him, who now devotes all his time to the manage- ment of the restaurant, and we held a solemn council of three. I am a very strong believer myself in small dinners, but it was difficult to make up a menu which would be sufficiently sub- stantial, without appearing gluttonous, for two. I held out against the second entree; but the sense of the house was distinctly against me, and the pouding Saxon was an ad- dition that I did not approve of, but gave in, being outvoted. This was the dinner that we settled on before I started home to dress :—

DINNERS AND DINERS 292 wholesale, and we had been given a whole chicken and a whole wild-duck. “ If I were you,” said the stockbroker, philosophically, cc I shouldn’t trouble to wonder. I should either eat my dinner —and it has been a good one so far—or else I should listen to an interesting story as to the doubtful elector.” I took his advice, in so far as eating my dinner was concerned, for the biscuit was capital. Signor Nobile came up to ask if the dinner had been satisfactory, and I had only pleasant words to say to him. Then my stockbroker drew a long breath, and was about to begin, when once more I interrupted him. “Pardon me,” I said, “let me order coffee and liqueurs, and pay my bill. The orchestra is enjoying ten minutes’ interval, and there will be, once the bill is paid, nothing to interrupt the flow of your discourse, nothing to mar my enjoyment of it.” This was the bill:—Two dinners, 10s.; one bottle 210, 16s. 6d. ; liqueurs, 5s. ; coffee, is. ; total, £1 : 12 : 6. This paid, I prepared to enjoy a really good story. “ There was a voter who would tell no one on which side he was going to vote,” I commenced, to gently lead my stock- broker up to his story. But he looked- at his watch. “Very sorry, my dear boy,” he said, “ but I have an appointment in two minutes’ time I daren’t break. I must tell you the story another day. It’s a bit long, but you’ll die with laughter when you hear it.” I have not as yet heard that voter story, and am still alive.

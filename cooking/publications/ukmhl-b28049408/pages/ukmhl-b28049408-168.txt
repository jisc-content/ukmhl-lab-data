CHAPTER XX LE RESTAURANT DES GOURMETS (lisle street) The superior person and I were chatting in the club as to eating generally, and he was holding forth on the impossibility of discovering any dining-place, as Kettner’s was discovered by our fathers, where a good meal could be had at a very small price. I turned on him and rent him figuratively, giving him a list that commenced with Torino’s and ended with the Hotel Hanover, and asked him if he had been to any of them. He had not. His system was to go to the Savoy or Willis’s, or the Princes’ Hall, or the Carlton, and then to grumble because he could not get his meals at those places at grill-room prices. I finally pinned him by asking him whether he would, as a man and a discoverer, come with me that evening and dine at the Restaurant des Gourmets. The name seemed to tickle him, and he said some- thing about going home to change into dress clothes, which I assured him was unnecessary, and he then asked where this restaurant might be.

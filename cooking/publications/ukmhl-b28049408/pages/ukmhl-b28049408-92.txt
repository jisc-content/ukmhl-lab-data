CHAPTER IX princes’ hall (Piccadilly) She is a charming little lady, and her husband, to tell the truth, spoils her just a little. Most married dames would have been content, if they wished to dine at a restaurant on the occasion of their birthday, with one dinner ; but Mrs. Daffodil—if I may so call her, from her favourite flower — insisted on having a dinner out on Saturday, and another on Sunday, and another on Monday, because, though her twenty-first birth- day really fell on Saturday, she was going to keep it on Monday, when a great party of her husband’s people were to meet at the Savoy, and on Sunday her people were organising a feast at the Berkeley ; but Mrs. Daffodil said that unless she dined out on the evening of her real birth- day she was sure she would have no luck during the coming year, and I was told that I was to have the privilege of being the third at the little dinner which was to be the veritable birthday dinner, and that, as a return for this great favour, I was to order the dinner and choose the restaurant.

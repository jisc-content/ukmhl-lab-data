THE ST. JAMES’S, PICCADILLY 83 I remember that I was very glad to find one place in London where such a simple dish as boiled fowl is not looked down upon, and that the saddle of mutton was an excellent one. I paid my bill—dinners, 7s. ; wine, 4s.; waters, is. 6d. ; liqueurs, is. ; total, 13s. 6d.—and went out with the youth again into Piccadilly. I promised him once more that he should have his letters early the next day, shook his hand, wished him God-speed and a charmed life against Boer bullets, and so we parted.

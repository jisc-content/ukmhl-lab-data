i8o DINNERS AND DINERS about the famous masked ball at Simla, at which Field-Marshal Lord Roberts, disguised in mask and domino, went up to a humorous Irish lady, and, in a feigned voice, asked her for a dance, receiving a reply that she cc hadn’t time to be dancing with boys to-night.” We talked of gymkhanas at Annandale, and picnics at Mash- obra, of A.D.C. theatricals and town-hall balls, and we effectually brought the scent of the deodars into Soho. Mrs. Tota finished her coffee and Cura^oa Marnier, and sighed as she drew on her gloves. <c Those were good days,” she said, and I nodded assent. I told Henri to bring me the bill. Two dinners, : is.; one Moet, 15s. ; two cafes, is.; two liqueurs, 2S. ; total, ^1 : 19s. “ Henri,” I said, cc you have let me off too lightly. It should be more than this ” ; whereat Henri went through an expressive pantomime which meant that to undercharge me was the last thing the management would think of doing. We left the domino in Henri’s charge, and Mrs. Tota thought she would walk the few yards to the Palace. “ If all dinners in private rooms are as pleasant as that, I rather think that I envy your elderly male relative,” said Mrs. Tota as we emerged into Church Street.

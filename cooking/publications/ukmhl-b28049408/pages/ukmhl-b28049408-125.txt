97 A WALK IN SOHO great content in a private room. I knew that the Restaurant European and the Restaurant Albert would scarcely tempt him, but I walked him up to the top of the street where the Tudor Hotel stands at the corner just to tire him and add to his punishment. Wardour Street is a fine thoroughfare to take exercise in, and we traversed the whole length of it from the Leicester Square end, where Pinoli’s windows of frosted glass bear the proud legend : cc Parisian Dinner, 2s.,” and the clean little Amphitryon—Ah, for the past glories of the name !—puts forth a bill of fare on which the highest-priced dish is but iod., past the Dei restaurant, a Rip Van Winkle of a restaurant, up to the far end where the Oriental Restaurant and the Oxford face each other on opposite sides of the way. The dinner at the Oxford costs but eighteenpence, the place looks clean and bright, and the Grumbler had his hand on the door- handle when he noticed how low the ceilings of the rooms are, and not being satisfied turned away again. Then I entangled the Grumbler in the maze of side streets. In the search for imaginary restaurants I took him through Great and Little Pulteney Street, Brewer Street, and Great Wind- mill Street, and brought him face to face with the Caf6 National, where he might have feasted at my expense at his stated price ; but the tarnished entree dishes and the small but curious selection of fruit in the windows did not allure him, and I took him, limping now and very limp, by the zig-zag by-street into Compton Street.

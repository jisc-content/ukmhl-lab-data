SIMPSON’S, THE STRAND 101 man, and we turned at once and went after him. ct I didn’t think you fellows would know me in this kit,” he said, when we caught him up and laid friendly hands on him. cc Most people don’t seem over-anxious to recognise me now.” He certainly did not look flourishing, though he had the smart carriage of the soldier about him, was as carefully shaved, and his light moustache as carefully trimmed, as if he were going on parade, and had the old buoyancy of manner. u Where will you come and lunch with us ? ” we both asked in a breath. uIt’s my dinner- hour now,” he told us, and somehow there was a touch of pathos in the way he said it. We pro- posed the Savoy grill-room to him or the Cecil, or Romano’s across the way ; but he said that, if we were anxious that he should come and eat with us, he would sooner have a cut from the saddle of mutton at Simpson’s than anything else. We turned back and went into the entrance to the old-fashioned eating-place, with its imita- tion marble columns, its coloured tile floor, its trees in tubs, and its two placards on either side, one announcing that a dinner from the joint is to be had for 2s. 6d., and the other that a fish dinner for 2s. 9d. is served from 12.30 p.m. to 8.30 p.m. Smith changed his mind. The last fish dinner he had eaten was at Greenwich more than half a dozen years ago, when he had asked a party of thirty down to celebrate an invest- ment that was going to make his fortune, and if we didn’t mind he would eat another now.

370 DINNERS AND DINERS from the grill, and bread and cheese and butter. The Grand, the grill-rooms of which big hotel are walled with shining tiles of white and buff, goes one better than the Trocadero in giving soup as an addition to its half-crown meal. I described to Mrs. Tota the Frascati grill, with its walls of white marble, veined with grey, on which are hung Oriental mirrors, its ceiling of gold and buff, and its wealth of electric lights ; and the Garrick grill, where amid paintings, on the panels, of dramatic celebrities past and present an excellent half-a-crown meal is to be obtained ; and the Queen’s grill where the cold buffet is one of the best in London, and the brown Munich beer comes to table ice-cold ; and the Criterion grill, with its entrance framed in Mashabir work, its red walls and air of quiet and comfort. I told her if she had a curiosity to study the ways of the surviving British waiter that she could find him amid Italian marbles at the Holborn grill, and should she care for American dishes that she should insist on George taking her to the Cecil grill-room, a great hall with glazed tiles in place of wall-paper. UI say. You are a malicious beast!” said George, as he accompanied me to the door. “ She’ll insist now on being taken to every grill- room in London.”

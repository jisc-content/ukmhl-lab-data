THE CECIL RESTAURANT, THE STRAND 159 Maire’s, the Armenonville, and how the Maison Paillard has perfected many of the great cooks and maitres (Photel of Europe, for Frederick, Joseph, Henry, Mourier all graduated in the school of Paillard. Now in addition to his Parisian duties the great man finds time to come backwards and forwards weekly to London, and his name is a guarantee that everything is du dernier cri. “And who do you think the moss-headed lady is ? ” said the Colleen, cutting in on my rhapsody on the gentle art of the maitre d'hotel, and I found I was expected to discuss our fellow- diners. A colonel, who commanded a cavalry regiment, I knew—he had brought out his wife for their usual Sunday dinner from home. A light of the Stock Exchange was giving a big dinner-party; five American ladies on their travels were dining without the society of man. The Colleen knew two hunting-men and a very pretty girl, the sister of one of them, and the other diners, including the lady so irreverently described as moss-haired, looked pleasant and well dressed. “ Now, if you please, I’m going to talk horse,” said the Colleen, and for the rest of dinner I heard tales of various “ finest little harses ” that ever were, and of marvellous runs over the grass country. My bill was: Two dinners, £ 1:1 s.; champagne, 18s. ; coffee, is. ; liqueurs, 2s. Total, £2: 2s.

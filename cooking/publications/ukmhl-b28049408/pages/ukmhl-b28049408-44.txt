16 DINNERS AND DINERS a military-looking manager, with a great black moustache and a heavy watch-chain, bowed to me and looked, I thought, rather suspiciously at my companion. c< It is quieter in here, and I can tell you the secrets better,” said the emissary as we went up a couple of steps into another room—a room with a golden paper, with mirrors in brown wooden frames on the walls, with a great framed ad- vertisement of somebody’s Italian wines, with artistic copper holders for the electric globes, and with two great champagne bottles flanking the ormolu clock on the mantelpiece. This room and the other were full of diners, but there was one little table vacant, and the emissary made for it, bowed me into one seat, took the other, and handed me over the menu and the wine list, the latter open at the champagne page. This was the menu :— Hors-d’ceuvre varies. Consomme Caroline. Creme a la Reine. Sole Colbert. Filet Mignon Chasseur. Lasagne al Sugo. Becassine rotie. Salade de Saison. Glace au Chocolat. Dessert. The head manager, M. Andagna, plump, with a slight moustache, and with a curly head of hair just turning grey, came up to the table, put himself at my service, and looked at the emissary as if he had seen him before and never wanted to see him again.

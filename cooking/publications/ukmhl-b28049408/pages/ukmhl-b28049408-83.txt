ST. GEORGE’S CAFE, ST. MARTIN’S LANE 55 clean, with a little bunch of flowers on it, with a portentously large decanter and an array of glasses. The waitress with the red flower put down a little bill of fare before me, and I learned that my dinner was to be— Hors-d’oeuvre. Mulligatawny soup or Carrot soup. Flageolets with cream and spinach. Fried duck’s egg and green peas. Lent pie or Stewed fruit. Mixed salad. Cheese. Dessert. Some olives in a small plate were put down before me, and through force of habit I took up the black-covered wine list on the table. The first items were orange wine, rich raisin wine, ginger wine, black currant wine, red currant wine, raspberry wine, elderberry wine. I put it down with a sigh, and ordered a bottle of ginger- beer. Then while I munched at an olive I looked round at my fellow-guests. There was a sister of mercy in her black and white, with her gold cross showing against her sombre garment ; there was a tall, thin gentleman who would not have done for any advertisement of anybody’s fattening food; there was a young lady in a straw hat with a many-coloured ribbon to it, who was so absorbed in an illustrated paper that she was neglecting her dinner ; there were two other ladies enjoying their stewed fruit immensely ; and there were two other gentlemen of the type I had seen below, but who were not wearing their hats.

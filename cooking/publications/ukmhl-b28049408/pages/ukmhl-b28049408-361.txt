THE COBURG, CARLOS PLACE 333 in luxurious quiet. Mr. Treadwell lay back in his chair and pulled at his cigar with the air of a man enjoying life. I paid my bill: Two dinners, £1 : is. 3 one bottle 83, 15s. 3 two coffees, is. 3 two fine champagne, 3s. 3 cigar, 6d. 3 total, £2 : o : 6. This done, I asked Mr. Treadwell where he would like to go and finish the evening 3 and he, waking from a day-dream, said, “Anywhere where they have a ballet.” “ Heads the Empire, tails the Alhambra,” I said as I tossed the coin, and it fell heads. I wish I had not been so hasty in buying those classical concert tickets.

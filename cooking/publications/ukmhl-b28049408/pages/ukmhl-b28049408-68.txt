DINNERS AND DINERS 40 buttons and rows of mouthpieces to speak into keeps the kitchen in touch with all the other parts of the hotel, and the arrangements by which the orders are filed are very methodical. I was not sorry to go out of the big kitchen, through a smaller one, which is devoted to the preparation of the table d'hote dinner, into the cool room where battalions of fish, big and small, lie on cloths spread on crushed ice, and where in cold cupboards the fat chickens and plump game- birds are placed in orderly rows. Here we talked business, M. Thouraud joining the board before allotment. I was all for an arrangement of sole, and M. Jules looked at M. Thouraud, and asked him if he did not think that he might be able to improvise something special, and M. Thouraud, with a look of confidence, said, “ Leave it to me.” “And a becasse,” suggested M. Jules, “ they are splendid fellows ” ; and I answered, “Make it so.” The board then adjourned to the meat room, where in a cool atmosphere the great sides of bacon, the joints, great and small, of British beef for roasting, and of French beef for bouillon, the mutton, and the charcuterie are kept, and we there discussed what morsel of meat should go to complete my dinner. If it had not been that two brown meats in a dinner is bad art, a Tournedos would have preceded the woodcock ; but M. Thouraud drew up from one of the long wooden hutches a tiny square of ribs of lamb, which he stroked as though he loved it, and that settled the artistic question. Asparagus and a bombe gave the finishing touches to the menu.

ST. GEORGE’S CAF£, ST. MARTIN’S LANE 53 made up my mind that the St. George’s should be my dining place, and the next question was how to secure some one to dine with me. I had to be present that afternoon at a com- mittee for a benefit theatrical performance, and found half a dozen of my fellow committee-men assembled. During a pause in the business one of them remarked that the last dinner about which I had written seemed to have been an excellent feast. This gave me my opportunity, and mentioning that I was going to do another dinner for publication that evening, asked if any one would care to dine with me. A pleased look came to at least four faces, but all were too polite to speak first. Then I said what the dinner was to be. One man had to go to a Masonic banquet; another was dining at a farewell feast to a coming Benedick; an- other had promised his dear old aunt to spend that evening with her : the guests bidden to the scriptural feast were not more prompt in excuses. I went on to my Service club and found there a subaltern who, in old days, had been in my Company, and who would have followed me, or preceded me, into any danger of battle without the tremble of an eyelid. Him I urged to come with me, telling him that a man can only die once, and other such inspiriting phrases, and had nearly persuaded him when old General Bundo- bust joined in the conversation and told a story of how Joe Buggins, of the Madras Fusiliers, once ate a vegetarian dinner and swelled up afterwards till he was as big as a balloon. That finished the subaltern, and he refused to go.

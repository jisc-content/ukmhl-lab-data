THE H6TEL GREAT CENTRAL 269 prowling about Blandford and Harewood and Dorset Squares I fancied that there must be some railway scheme in his brain which would affect those squares. Then came the bill before Parliament for the extension of the Manchester, Sheffield, and Lincolnshire Railway; the meetings to oppose it, the wrecking of the neighbourhood as if by a combination of an earthquake and a bombardment, and at last the gradual return to orderliness and form as the terminus of the Great Central, with its clusters of warehouses and sheds, came into existence, and the Hotel Great Central rose as a towering red-brick pile, relieved with brown terra-cotta, dominating all the houses in the neighbourhood, and set by its clock in its topmost tower the time for the clockless district that lies between Marylebone and the Edgware Road. I feel a personal interest in the hotel, for in company with all the gutter-boys of the neigh- bourhood I watched through the windows the decorating of the rooms and the installation of the batteries de cuisine. But, though I have been an amateur clerk of the works, I had never been into the hotel until Mrs. Tota and her husband did me the honour to dine with me there. I had heard from men whose opinion I value that the five-shilling dinner was a very good one, and some people who, as a rule, ring the changes for their Sunday dinner from the Savoy to the Carlton, from Princesâ€™ to the Berkeley, had faced the journey to Marylebone more than once on the Sabbath, and had reported themselves pleased.

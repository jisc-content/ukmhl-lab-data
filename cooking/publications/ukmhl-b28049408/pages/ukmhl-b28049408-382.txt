DINNERS AND DINERS 354 coals. However, I was very glad to hear that Miss Dainty is going to return to the land of her birth, and said so ; and then I asked if any- thing had been said in the letter as to Jack, Miss Dainty’s fighting-dog. I do not wish Jack any harm ; but if Providence or a bigger dog sent him to an untimely grave I should not be very sorry. There was no news of Jack, it seems, in the letter, and the message having been delivered, Miss Belle held out her hand to say good-bye. I asked her, if it was not an impertinence, where she was going, and she replied that she was off to have a bite at Gamb’s. I suppose my eyes opened in surprise, for Miss Belle explained, “ Gamb’s is the Gambrinus, a queer old place where you get Dutch food—you over here call it German, but we call it Dutch— and where you get real cold steins of beer. We girls often go there by ourselves, for nobody says anything to us, and we haven’t to dress up, and we are not stared at like we are in your real swell restaurants.” A Dutch dinner in the company of Miss Belle would, I thought, be much more amusing than the leg of mutton and solitude that awaited me at home, and I asked if I might accompany her. cc Wdiy, ye-e-es, certainly,” said Miss Belle j and we walked together to Glasshouse Street, in which the Gambrinus is situated. A great lamp, with much wrought iron about it, and inscriptions and coloured glass, calls attention to the door, and the long window that fronts the street is all of stained glass, with coats of arms and scrolls in profusion on it.

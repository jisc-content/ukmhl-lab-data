DINNERS AND DINERS 226 £C Invalid maiden aunt ? ” I said with astonish- ment, but remembered in a second that I had mentioned some such relative (or was it an uncle ?) when we dined in the private room at Kettner’s. Mrs. Tota laughed and turned to M. Meschini, who was beginning to explain the various works of art. The name of Julia Neilson, written in bold characters, catches the eye as soon as any other inscription on these sections of a wall of days gone by ; but it is well worth while to take the panels one by one, and to go over these sections of brown plaster inch by inch. Mascagni has written the first bars of one of the airs from “ Cavalleria Rusticana,” Denza has scribbled the opening bars of cc Funiculi, Funicula,” Lam- oureux has written a tiny hymn of praise to the cook, Ysaye has lamented that he is always tied to “notes,” which, with a waiter and a bill at his elbow, might have a double meaning. Phil May has dashed some caricatures upon the wall, a well-meant attempt on the part of a German waiter to wash one of these out having resulted in the cc sack ” of the said waiter and the glazing of the wall. Mario has drawn a picture of a fashionable lady, and Val Prinsep and a dozen artists of like calibre have, in pencil, or sepia, or pastel, noted brilliant trifles on the wall. Pader- ewski, Pucchini, Chaminade, Calve, Piatti, Plan- $on, De Lucia, Melba, Menpes, Tosti, are some of the signatures ; and as little Mrs. Tota read the names she became as serious as if she were in church, for this little chamber is in its way a temple dedicated to the artistic great who have dined.

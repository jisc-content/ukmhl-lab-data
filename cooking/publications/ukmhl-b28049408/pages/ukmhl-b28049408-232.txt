DINNERS AND DINERS 204 might have suggested that the lamb from which the noisettes were cut would have been better for a little longer hanging. For the rest of the dinner I had nothing but praise, and the salad of strawberries, as cold as ice could make it, was delicious. I ordered coffee and some chartreuse in crushed ice for the leading lady, and some fin champagne for myself and asked for my bill. While disposing of the coffee I thought that my chance had come to get the leading lady’s real opinion of my conception of the character of Joseph’s valet, and began explaining at length my method of entry to announce the arrival of Charles Surface ; but the leading lady rather brusquely asked for her cloak, and said we should miss part of the first act of “ Frou-Frou.” I paid the bill—Two dinners, 15s.; one bottle 89, 13s.; two cafes specials, is. 6d.; two liqueurs, 2s. ; total, ^1 : 11 : 6—and helped the leading lady on with her cloak. I think she might have listened to my ideas as to the valet’s entrance. These amateurs — all but myself—are so in- ordinately selfish.

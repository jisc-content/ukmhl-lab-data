LE RESTAURANT DES GOURMETS 145 The turbot and caper sauce, which was the most expensive part of my dinner, costing as much as 8d., I did not care for very much ; but, on the other hand, the gigot haricot, which followed it, Was excellent. M. Brice, who kept up a running accompaniment of con- versation to my dinner, told me that all the meat cooked at his restaurant was English. There is no such thing as a wine list at the Restaurant des Gourmets, and I had ordered at a venture a pint of vin ordinaire, which the waiter told me would cost sixpence. It is a rough, strong wine, and I suggested to M. Brice that it probably was of Corsican or Sardinian growth. M. Brice shrugged his shoulders, and from some- where produced a pint of claret, with the name of the late M. Nicol of the Cafe Royal on it, and told me that he was able to sell that at a very moderate price. The omelette that I had ordered was as light as a French cook always makes them, and the slice of brie that closed my repast was as coulant as it should be. Then M. Brice, still talking, made me out my bill on the back of one of the cards of his restaurant.

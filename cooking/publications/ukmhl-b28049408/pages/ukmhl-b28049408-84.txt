56 DINNERS AND DINERS The carrot soup, which was the soup I chose, was quite hot and was satisfying. The spinach was not up to club form, and the flageolets topping it did not look inviting, but I made an attack on it and got half through, not because I wanted to eat it, but because I did not want to hurt the waitress’s feelings. The duck’s egg was well fried, and I enjoyed it, though the peas were a trifle hard. Then I fell into disgrace with the waitress, for I would have neither Lent pie nor stewed fruit, pleading that I never ate sweets. “ What, not stewed fruit ? ” said the little girl with the red rose ; and I knew that in her opinion I had missed the crown of the feast. A little bowl of lettuce and cucumber, with a bottle of salad dressing, was put in front of me, and I mixed my own salad. Then I ate a slice of Gruyere cheese, and finished with some almonds and raisins that were grouped on a platter round an orange. It being, as the sign- board had told me, a noted coffee-house, I ordered a small cup of the liquid, and said “Black,” in reply to the waitress’s question. It was capital coffee undoubtedly, and, having finished it, I asked for my bill. The waitress pulled out a little morocco-covered memorandum book, and presented me with this :—Ginger- beer, 2d. ; coffee,2d.; dinner, is.6d.; total, is. iod. I paid at the desk, and went forth feeling rather empty. As I am writing, twenty-four hours after the event, I may conclude that Joe Buggins’s, of the Madras Fusiliers, fate will not be mine.

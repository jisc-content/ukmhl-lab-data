DINNERS AND DINERS 316 with deep pink shades to the little lamps on the tables, and dark green velvet curtains in the charming little ante-room ; and Mrs. de Foreest was kind enough to recall with pleasure the caille a la Sainte-Alliance she had eaten when she had dined in this room. The East Room, as all the world knows, is one of the temples of the Haute Cuisine. Across the landing I showed my flock the West Room, which is now a symphony in shades of rose colour—a very beautiful room, but not so handsome to my mind, as it used to be when it was an oriental chamber with a charming pattern of roses on its walls. Ever since I can remember the West Room a 5s. French dinner has been served there, and when I was a curly-haired subaltern, and sovereigns were even more scarce with me than they are now, I generally used to find that if a lady did me the honour to dine with me, it was more prudent to take her to the West Room than to the then East Room, where in those days the vast sum—to a subaltern—of half a guinea was charged for the table-d'hote meal. Apropos of sovereigns and dinners I received in connection with the series of articles here collected one very strange epistle. It was from a perfect stranger, and he requested me to send him ^25. He had but one claim on my generosity, he wrote, and that was that he wanted the money badly. The tone of my articles, he continued, suggested the command of so much wealth that he was sure that I would not miss the paltry w pony ” which would put him out of his difficulties.

THE EAST ROOM, CRITERION 317 But I wander from my subject. M. Eugene took us up one more flight of stairs and we were in the grand hall, with its brown marble columns with gilded capitals, its dome of stained glass and its statues of fawns and nymphs, and William Shakespeare with crossed legs leaning an elbow on a pile of books. “What was that quail a la Sainte-Alliance anyhow ? ” asked Captain de Foreest as we went down the stairs, and I replied, with due gravity, that if he had read the first edition of a great work titled u Dinners and Diners,” by a most talented author, he would have known all about it. To which, with a becoming humility, he answered that there were quite a number of the most talented works of British authors that had not as yet got across the Atlantic. I promised to send him the article, and as some of my readers may be in like case as Captain de Foreest, I print it as showing what the East Room and its dinners were like under the rule of M. Lefevre, a description which is practically that of the room of to-day except for the change of decorations, and that the dinners are now served under the superintendence of M. Eugene. The East Room “ I want father to take me to see The Liars” said pretty Miss Carcanet (“Brighteyes” to her friends), “ but he says that he sees too many of them as it is in his club smoking-room, and won’t go with me.”

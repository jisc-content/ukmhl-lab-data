DINNERS AND DINERS Vlll examples of the restaurants which fall into great classes. If I were to attempt to describe every big eating-place at which a 3s. 6d. table d'hote is served, I should have to write about a vast number of similar meals eaten under conditions so alike that the only difference would be in the colour of the marble on the dining-room walls, the size and shape of the room, and the name of the maitre d'hotel I think that it will be found that every dining-place, great or small, which the man, or woman, of a most catholic taste in dinners is likely to visit in London is mentioned or described, and catalogued in the book. Chefs and maitres d'hbtels are a wandering race, and some restaurants seem to change their managers annually. Restlessness is sometimes one of the symptoms of genius, and the cordon bleu of a great chef often illumines many kitchens in succession. I have kept track as best I may of these Bedouins of the stew-pans and dining- rooms, and I trust that the wander-spirit will not seize any of the master minds at the eleventh hour, when this book is on the point of publi- cation, and induce them to change their public addresses.

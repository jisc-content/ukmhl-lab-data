THE AMERICAN BAR, CRITERION 185 effects of which the friends aforesaid found the greatest possible difficulty in sleeping off by dinner-time. But our entree arrives, a filet saute Bearnalse, than which I desire to eat no better. A new arrival of guests, most of them fresh from Kemp- ton, with their racing-glasses hung over their shoulders, included a young man with a familiarly known nickname, who in the first Jubilee years galloped through his money and earned his jubilant title ; another racing man, with the name of a philanthropist of a past generation, who at one time owned a property with two racecourses on it; and a gentleman who used to drive a yellow- bodied coach with four piebald horses, which he alluded to humorously as his mustard-pot and guinea-pigs, who having run through one fortune seems likely to make another. A sporting baronet, who takes an interest in yachting ; a dramatist, who has written more than one racing play, and no doubt finds the American Bar useful for his local colour \ our cleverest caricaturist, and a dozen or two less well - known people, formed a solid mass before the bar, and occupied all the available tables. We had finished our Burgundy, which for its price was exceptionally good, and my guest had eaten some cheddar cheese, when the roving disposition of the racing romancer asserted itself, and for our coffee and liqueurs we must needs go to the hospitable Eccentric Club across the way, so I called for the bill : Two consommes, 2s.; two salmon, 4s.; two filets sautes, 6s. ; cheese, 6d. ; Burgundy, 5s.; total, 17s. 6d.

152 DINNERS AND DINERS rocks, and when I jested feebly at the shape of the creature my sister-in-law laughed. I re- proved her austerely, telling her that if she laughed thus she would be taken for an actress. Whereon she retorted that she did not want to be taken for an actress, but that she wanted to be one. I opened my eyes in a query, and she said that if actresses were given every night such a dinner as she had eaten she wanted to be an actress. The bill was : Two couverts, is. ; hors- d’oeuvre, 2s. ; pot-au-feu, 2s. ; sole Waleska, 3s. 6d.; supreme d’agneau, 3s. 6d. ; haricots verts, is. 6d. ; parfait de foie gras, 4s. 5 caille cocotte, 5s. ; salade, is. ; pole nord, 2s. 6d. ; cafe, is. 6d. ; one bottle ’67, 15s.; liqueurs, 2s. ; total, £2 : 4: 6. I told my sister-in-law that if we were not to miss the first act of the play we were going to see, we had better be moving, so she laid down the straw through which she had been sucking her creme de menthe, and with a sigh, a tribute of remembrance to the quails, put on her gloves. My sister-in-law is the daughter of a dean ; but ever since that dinner she asserts that she has mistaken her vocation, and that she ought to have been an actress. One of the most delicate methods of filleting soles, a “ creation ” which came into being at the Cafe Royal, is the sole St-Augustin, and the recette of this was given me by Oddenino. I give it in the original French with the signature of Charles, the chef of that period, at its tail.

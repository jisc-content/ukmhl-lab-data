18 DINNERS AND DINERS \ listening. Two young men, who might be medical students, and two young ladies in sailor hats, who perhaps spend their days in a florist’s shop, were rising with laughter from their table, a bald-headed gentleman with a long flaxen moustache was talking very earnestly to a pretty lady with many flowers in her hat, a grey-bearded father was listening to some amusing story told by his son, and all the other diners were attending to their own business and not to ours. “ If I give your Government some good infor- mation, how much do you think they would pay me ? ” asked the emissary, and I replied that pay- ment should not enter into his calculation j that revenge was what he wanted, and that I was to be the instrument through which his revenge was to be gratified. The emissary rubbed his hands. cc After your good dinner I feel no longer revengeful. I will spare my friend Leyds, unless I am well paid,” he said. cc You’ve humbugged me,” I protested. “I am no longer revengeful — that is all,” murmured the emissary. When the coffee came I asked for the bill—a bill that the Government ought to pay >—Dinners, 5s. ; champagne, 14s. ; mineral water, 6d. ; coffee, is. ; liqueurs, is. 6d. ; total, £1 : 2s. Outside in the street the emissary bowed lowly to me. “ Could you oblige me with the address of the Right Honourable Joseph Chamberlain ? ” he asked. I told him to go to the devil.

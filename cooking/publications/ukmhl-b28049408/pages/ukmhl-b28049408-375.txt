CHAPTER XLIX THE FREEMASONS’ TAVERN (GREAT QUEEN STREET) The Victory Chapter of the Knights of the Pelican and the Eagle, perfect and puissant princes of Rose Croix, has been closed, and gentlemen in evening clothes are being helped into their great-coats in the entrance corridor of Mark Masons’ Hall by the rotund sergeant who keeps guard there in a glazed box. Most of these gentlemen have mysterious flat tin cases, which they hand over to the sergeant or another official to be taken care of for them until spring brings round again another meeting of the Chapter. There is no unnecessary waiting in the Mark Masons’ Hall, for it is now a quarter-past seven, and dinner has been ordered next door, at the Freemasons’ Tavern, at seven. A few yards of pavement only lie between the lamps of Mark Masons’ Hall and the glass shelter before the doors of the Tavern, and in twos and threes the gentlemen in evening dress hurry from one door to the other.

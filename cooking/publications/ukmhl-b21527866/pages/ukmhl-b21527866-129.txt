THE RECEIPT BOOK. 119 — * V cretioa of tough viscid saliva promoted, this gargle will be of service. 414. Emollient gargle.—Take an ounce of marshmallow roots, and two or three figs; boil them in a quart of water, till near one half of it be consumed ; then strain out the liquor. If an ounce of honey, and half an ounce of water of ammonia, be added to the above, it will then be an exceeding good atten- uating gargle. This gargle is beneficial in fevers, where the tongue and fauces are rough and parched, to soften these parts and promote the dischargeofsaliva.—The learned and accurate Sir John Pringle observes, that in the inflammatory quinsy, or strangulation of the fauces, little benefit arises from the common gargles ; that such as are of an acid nature do more harm than good, by contracting the emunclories of the saliva and mucus, and thickening those humours; that a decoction of figs in milk and water has a contrary effect, especially if -some sal-ammoniac be added, by which the saliva is made thinner, and the glands brought to secrete more freely; a circumstance always conducive to the cure. INFUSIONS. Vegetables yield nearly the same properties to water by infusion as by decoct'on ; and though they mav require a lon- ger time to give out their virtues in this way, yet it has several advantages over the other; since boiling is said to dissipate the finer parts of many bitter and aromatic substances, without more fully extracting their medicinal principles. The author of the new Dispensatory observes, that even from those vegetables which are weak in virtue, rich infusions may be obtained, by returning the liquor upon fresh quantities of the subject, the water loading itself more and more with the active parts ; and that these loaded infusions are applicable to valuable purposes in medicine ; as they contain in a small com- pass the finer, more subtle, and active, principles of vegetables, in a form already miscible with the fluids of the human body.

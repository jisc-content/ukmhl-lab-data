In the meanwhile prepare a second liquor, like the former, adding to it nearly a quar- ter of an ounce of Avhite or crude tartar. Wring out from the first bran water, and put in this, and if the colour be not saddened, which may be known by xvringing one end of it tight, and blowing strongly on it, which will shew the colour, it will be of when dry, but should it be sadden- ed, or darkened, a clean liquor must be made of cold spring water, to which add a drop or two of the solution of tin ; let it remain in this liquor ten minutes, then wring it, and hang it to dry. 579.

The blue, with oil of xitriol alone, never can be ranked among the fast dyes, but blues obtain from logwood, may be made sufficiently holding to be adopted almost for general use ; though in the method now practised of simply boiling the logwood Avith blue vitriol, the colour is easily acted upon by Avind, rain, and sun. Goods for blue require no other preparation but dipping them in AVarm Avater, previous to their being dipped in the vat. The reason this colour requires no preparation, is because tlie.Avhole liquor of the vat,of whatever kind it may be, is impregnated with those salts that are of a proper nature to seize on the cloth, and fix it- self on the pores of the substances, drawing at the same time the colouring atoms, along Avith it, and then, on its being exposed to the air,and as the dye and the preparing

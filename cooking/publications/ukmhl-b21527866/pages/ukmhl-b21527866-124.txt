Electuary for the gonorrhoea.—Take of lenitive elec- tuary, three ounces ; jalap and rhubarb, in powder, of each two drachms ; nitre, half an ounce ; simple syrup, enough to make an electuary.

The dose is a drachtn, or about the bulk of a nutmeg, two or three times a day ; more or less as may be necessary, to keep the body gently open. An electuary made of cream of tartar and simple syrup will occasionally supply the place of this. After the inflammation is gone off, the following electuary may be used. Take of lenitive electuary, two ounces balsam of capavi, one ounce ; gum guiacum and rhubarb in powder, of each two drachms; simple syrup enough to make an electuary. The dose is the same as of the proceeding. % 397. Electuary of the hark.—Take of Peruvian bark, in powder, three ounces, cascarilla, half an ounce ; syrup of gin- ger, enough to make an electuary.

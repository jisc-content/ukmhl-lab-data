A pretty hair brown.—If the article to be dyed is a silk pelisse, fill your copper full of river water; when it boils, put in a quarter of a pound of chipped fustic, two ounces of madder, one ounce of sumach, and half an ounce of camwood, but if not required to be scoured, the cam- wood may be omitted. These should boil half an hour; but they may boil for two hours, that the ingredients may be well incorporated; and which should be the case with browns, and all colours where two or three are mixed to- gether. The copper must then be cooled down by pour- ing in cold water: the goods may then be put in and sim- mered gently from half an hour to an hour. If this co- lour should want darkening, or saddening, take out your goods, and add a little old black liquor; or for want of black liquor, a small piece of green copperas may be used ; rinse in two or three waters, and hang* up to dry.

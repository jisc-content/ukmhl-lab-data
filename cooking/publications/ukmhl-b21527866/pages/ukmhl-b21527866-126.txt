THE RECEIPT BOOK. 116 404. Emulsion of gum ammoniac.—Take of gum ammo- niac, two drachms ; water, eightounces. Grind the gum with the water poured upon it by little, and little till it is dis- solved. This emulsion is used for attenuating tough viscid phlegm, and promoting expectoration. In obstinate coughs, two ounces of the syrup of poppies may be added to it. The dose is two table-spoonsful three or four times-a-day. 405. Oily emulsion.—Take of salt-water, six ounces ; vola- tile aromatic spirit, two drachms; Florence oil, an ounce; shake them well together, and add of simple syrup, half aa ounce. In recent colds and coughs, this emulsion is generally of service; but, if the cough proves obstinate, it will succeed bet- ter when made with the paregoric elixir of the Edinburgh Dispensatory, instead of the volatile aromatic spirit. A table- spoonful of it may be taken every two or three hours. EXTRACTS. Extracts are prepared by boiling the subject in water, and evaporating the strained decoction to a due consistence. By this process, some of the more active parts of plants are freed from the useless indissoluble earthy matter, which makes the larger share of their bulk. Water, however, is not the only menstruum used iu the preparation of extracts: sometimes titled spirits alone is employed for that purpose. Extracts are prepared from a variety of different drugs, as the bark, gentian, jalap, &c.; but, as they require a trouble- some and tedious operation, it will be more convenient for a private practitioner to purchase what he needs of them from a professed druggest, than to prepare them himself. Such of them as are generally used, are inserted in our list of such drugs and medicines as are to be kept for private use.

"Whenever I mention boiling in dyeing silks, simmering must be understood. It should be remembered that this hardens the silk more than any other brown colour, being so much sumacty used with copperas, both of which tend to harden the goods. \ 490. Another brown of a greenish yglloio cast.—Proceed as before in the boiling; and add to the copper, when it boils, a quarter of a pound of fustic, three ounces of su- mach, and a small quantity of green copperas, or verdi- gris and from a quarter to half an ounce of log-wood. If it is not green enough, add a small piece of blue vitriol: but the fustic, sumach, and verdigris alone, will be sufficient.

Or 1 frequently make use of old madder liquor that have been used for dying reds, when nothing but the brown dregs of the madder remain, the red being all extracted ; but if madder be boiled an hour or two, it has the same effect. From one to four drachms of the best crop madder must be added to a small quantity of old black liquor, if at hand, suppose you require it to be darker. If you have no black liquor, a small piece of green cop- peras will answer the same purpose. 492. To make another drab, bordering on a beaver colour. —If the article to be dyed is a silk spencer, when your water boils, check its boiling-, and put in half on ounce of archil and two drachms of madder: this may be saddened by taking out your goods, and adding a piece of green cop-

THE RECEIPT BOOK. 30 145. Fora black.—Mix up a little good size and lamp- black, and it will bear a good gloss without varnishing over. 146. To imitate black rose-wood.—'The work must he ground black, after which take some red-lead well ground and mixed up as before directed, which lay on with a flat stiff brush in imitation of the streaks in the wood; after which take a small quantity of lake, ground, fine, and mix it with brown spirit varnish, carefully observing not to have more co- lour in it than will just tinge the varnish ; but should it hap- pen on trial to be still too red, you may easily assist it with a little umber, ground very fine, with which pass over the whole ol the work intended to imitate black rose-wood, and it will have the desired effect. I have seen work done by a good japanner according to the foregoing rule, which when varnished and polished is scarcely to be known from the real wood. 147. To make the furniture oil»—Take linseed-oil, put it in a glazed pipkin, with as much alkanet root as it will cover; et it boil gently, and you will find it become of a strong red colour; let it cool, and it is fit for use. 148. To take ink spots out of mahogany, fyc,—Apply spirits of salt with a bit of rag till the ink disappears. 149. To make parchment transparent.—Take a thin skin of qarchment, and soak it in a strong lye of wo^l ashes, often wringing it out till you find it become transparerft; then stiain it on a frame and let it dry. 140. A cement to join broken glass.—Take one ounce of isinglass, steep it in half a piut of spirits of wine for twenty- four hours, then let it dissolve over a slow fire, (always keep it close covered, or the spirit will evaporate) then lake six cloves of garlic, bruise them well in a mortar, put it in a linen cloth, and squeeze the juice into the isinglass mix it well together, and keep it for use, it being excellent to join glass ornaments, 6cc. &c.

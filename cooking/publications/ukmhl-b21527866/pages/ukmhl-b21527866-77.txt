.67 THE RECEIPT BOOK. according- to the breadth you want to have your work g-ilt : then touch with a hair pencil, dipped in this isin- g-lass water, on the g-lass, and while moist, lay on your leaf gold, piece by piece, until you have the parts you want covered. The leaf will instantly adhere to the glass ; then place it within air of the fire, in a slanting position, until it dries,which will be in a few minutes. While it is gently warm, take a piece of clean cotton wool, and rub the gold to the glass smartly, until you not only find the superfluous pieces of leaf gold gone, but that likewise the back of the part gilt receives a polish ; then proceed to lay on a second coat of gold, in the same manner as the first, drying it as before, and polishing it ; and so a third coat, which is full sufficient and to gild properly cannot be dispensed with.

If you want to cut figures, or any kind of ornament out of your gold, after your glass is gilt, have a drawing of your design on paper, at the back of which rub some powdered red chalk, and the smallest quantity of fresh butter, lay the paper on the gold, and with a bluntish ivory point, go over the lines of the drawing, and they Will be nicely transferred on the gold ; when you can with an ivory point, trace them out of the gold, and

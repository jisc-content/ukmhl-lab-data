90 THE RECEIPT BOOK. PLASTERS. Plasters ought to be of a different consistence, according to the purposes for which they are intended. Such as are to be applied to the breasts or stomach, ought to be soft and yielding; while those designed for the limbs should be firm and adhesive. It has been snpposed, that plasters might be impreg- nated with the virtues of different vegetables, by boiling the recent vegetables with the oil employed for the com- positions of the piaster: but this treatment does not com- municate to the oils any valuable quality. The calces of lead, boiled with oils, unite with them into a plaster of proper consistence, which make the basis of several other plasters. In boiling these compositions, a quantity of hot water must be added from time to time, to prevent the plaster from burning or growing black. This should be done with care, lest it cause the matter to explode. 329. Common plaster.-— Take of common olive-oil, six pints ; litharge, reduced to a powder, two pounds and a half. Boil the litharge and oil together over a slow fire, continually stirring them, and keeping always half a gal- lon of water in the vessel; after they have boiled three hours, a little of the plaster may be taken out, and put into cold water, to try if it be of a proper consistence: when that is the case, let it cool, and the water can be pressed out of it with the hands. This plaster is generally applied in slight wounds and excoralions of the skin : it keeps the part warm, and de- fends it from the air, which is all that is necessary in such cases. Its principle use is to serve as a basis for other plasters. 330. Adhesive plaster.—Take of common plaster, half a pound; of Burgundy pitch, a quarter of a pound. Meh them together. This plaster is principally used for keeping on other dressings.

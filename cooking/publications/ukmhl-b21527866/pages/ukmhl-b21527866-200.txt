190 THE RECEIPT BOOK. you can pulp all the macaroni through a fine sieve. To these two liquors put apint, or a pint and a half, of boil- ing cream, the macaroni that was first taken out, and half a pound of Parmesan cheese : make it hot, but do not let it boil. Serve it then up in a tureen, with the crust of a rasped loaf cut small. 619. Ox rump sonp.—One rutnp of beef will make it stronger than double the same quantity of any other meat. Make it like gravy soup, and then give it what flavour you like. 620. Serf broth.—Put a leg of beef with the bone well broke, in your pan, with a gallon of water. Take off the scum w hen it rises, and add two or three blades of mace, a small bunch of parsley, and a crust of bread. Boil it till the beef is quite tender. Lay some toasted bread cut in pieces i n your tureen, next to the meat, and then pour the broth over it. 621. Veal broth.—Take a knuckle of veal, two turnips* two carrots, two heads of celery, and six onions, stew them in a gallon of water, till reduced to one half, add a lump of butter rolled in flour, with a little Cay enne pepper and salt strain it, and add a gill of cream. Two ounces of vermi- celli may be added with good effect. 622. Mutton broth.—Cut a scrag of mutton,about sixf- peunds weight in two, and boil the scrag part in a gallon of water, skim it, and put in some sweet herbs, an onion and a crust of bread; when it is boiled about an hour, put in the best part of the neck, and a short time before the meat is quite done, put in a turnip, some dried mari- golds, olives, parsley cut small, aud seasoned with salt. Some prefer it seasoned with mace, instead ot the sweet herbs and onions. In this, however, the fancy must be the director. If you boil turnips as sauce to the meat, they must be done separately, or the flavour will be too strong for the broth,

THE RECEIPT BOOK. 215 130. Hind quarter of a pig lamb fashion.—When house lamb bears a high price, the hind quarter of a pig is a good substitute for it. Take off the skin, roast it, and it will eat like lamb. Serve it with mint sauce, or salad. 731. Porker's head.—Take a fine young head, clean it, and put bread and sage as for a pig; sew it up tight, and put it on a string or hanging-jack, roast it as a pig, and serve it in the same manner. GAME AND POULTRY. GENERAI OBSERVATIONS. Hares and rabbits require time and care, otherwise the body will be done too much and the extremities too little. Poultry should be roasted with a clear fire, and when they are frothy, and of a light brown colour, they are enough. Great care must be taken not to-overdo them, as the loss of the juices will impair the flavour. Wild-fowl require less roasting than the tame kind, and must be basted often. Their flavour is best preserved without stuffing. A little pepper, salt, and a piece of butter should be put into each. To take off the fishy taste from wild fowl, baste them for a few minutes with some hot gravy. 732. Venison.—When the haunch is spitted, take a piece of butter, and rub all over the fat, and sprinkle salt over it; take a sheet of writing paper, butter it well, and lay over the fat part; put two sheets over that, and tie the paper on wdth twine: keep it well basted, and let. there be a good fire. If a large haunch, it will take four hours to do it. Before you send it to table, take off the paper, dust it over with flour, and baste it with butter}

PREFACE, i. As it appears to be a universal custom, to commence every work with a kind of introductory chapter; not that it is considered in the least useful or interestingâ€™, but a kind of ornamental embellishment, that cannot well be dispensed with. Therefore we follow the beaten tract as our Work would appear singular without it. Brevity being1 our maxim, we shall not spin our story into a lengthened address. Suffice it to say, that no trouble or expence has been / spared, to combine in the present volume, the really use- ful information of every author in their various depart- ments of science. Utility has been the principal object considered, and it must be acknowledged on the perusal of its pages, that the compiler has not failed in his un- dertaking. *

101 the receipt book. a menstruum for extracting the virtues of other medicinal substances; lor which it is not ill adapted, being- a com- pound of water, inflammable spirit, and acid; by which means it is enabled to act upon vegetable and animal sub- stances, and to dissolve bodies of the metalic kind, so as to pregnate itself with their virtues, as steel, antimony &c. 358. Anthelmintic wine.—Take of rhubarb, halt an ounce, worm-seed, an ounce. Bruise them and ini use without heat, in two pints of red port wine for a few daj-s ; then strain off the wine. As the stomach of persons afflicted with worms are always debilitated, red wine alone often proves service- able: it must have still better effect*; when joined with bitter and purgative ingredients, as in the above lorm. A glass of this wine may be taken twice a day, 359. Antimonial wine.—Take glass of antimony, re- duced to a pow'der, half an ounce; Lisbon wine, eight ounces. Digest, for three or four days, now and then shak- ing the bottle; afterwards filter the wine through paper. The dose of this wine varies according to the intention. As an alterative and diaphoretic, it may be taken from ten to fifty or sixty drops. In a large dose it generally proves cathartic, or excites vomiting. SflO. Bitter wine.—Take of gentian-root, yellow rind of lemon-peel, fresh, each one ounce ; long pepper, two drachms; mountain-wine, two pints. Infuse without heat for a wreek, and strain out the wine for use. In complaints arising from weakness of the stomach or indigestion, a glass of this wine may be taken an honr before dinner and supper. 3G0. Ipecacuanna wine.—Take of ipecacuanha, in pow- der, one ounce; mountain wine, a pint. Infuse for three or four days; then filter the tincture. This is a safe vomit, and answers extremely well for such persons as cannot swallow the powder, or whose stomachs are too irritable to bear it. The dose is from one ounce to an ounce and a half. I 3

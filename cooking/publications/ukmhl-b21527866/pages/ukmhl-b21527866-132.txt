The basis of iulaps is generally common water, or some simple distiller! water, with one-third or one-fourth its quantity of distilled spirituous water, and as much sugar as is sufficient to render the mixture agreeable. This is sharpened with vegetable or mineral acids, or impreg- nated with other medicines. 423.

To this mixture, addt by little and little, the vinegar with the sugar dissolved in it, still continuing the trituration. In hysterical and other complaints, where camphor is proper, this julap may be taken in the dose of a spoonful or two, as often as the stomach will bear it. 424.

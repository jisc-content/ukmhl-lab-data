It frequently happens that japanned work receives damage when it is very inconvenient (either from distance or other circumstances) to send for the japanner to repair it, therefore it may not be improper to lay down the simplest methods used in that branch. First provide yourself with a small muller and stone, to grind any colour you may require. Secondly, provide yourself with white hard varnish, brown varnish, turpentiue varnish, japan gold size, and spirits of turpentine, which you may keep in separate bottles for the purpose. Thirdly, provide yourself with flake white, red lead, ver- million, lake, Prussian blue, kingâ€™s and patent yellow, orpi- ment, spruce and brown ochre, mineral green, verditer, burnt umber, andhimp-black. Observe that all woodwork must be prepared with size, and some coarser material mixed with it,;to fill up and harden the grain of the wood, (such as may best suit the colour in- tended to be laid on) which must be rubbed smooth with glass paper when dry ; but in cases of accident it is seldom neces- sary to resize the damaged places, unless thev are con- siderable. J With the foregoing colours you may. match almost any co- lour now in use for japanning ; always observing to grind your colour smooth in spirits of turpentine, then add a small quantity of turpentine and spirit varnish, lay it carefully on with a camel-hair brush,then varnish it with brown or white spirit variibh, according to the colour.

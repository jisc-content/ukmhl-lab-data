It is then poured from one pot into the other, and thus soon becomes clear; they often drink it quite thick. Some, to make it clear sooner, either put in a spoonful of cold water, or lay a cloth dipped in cold water on the top of the pot. 216. English modes of making coffee.—One of the beat methods of preparing coffee in England is, by making four coffee cups, or about a pint, with an ounce of coffee; pouring on it that quantity of water boiling it up for five or six minutes, pouring out, and returning a little of the coffee, two or three times; then putting in two or three small shreds of isinglass, dissolved in a cupful of boiling water, boiling the whole five minutes longer, and keeping the coffee pot close to the fire ten minutes more, to clear; some put in, with the coffee, a small bit of vanilla, which gives a fine flavour ; but it must not be suffered to predo- ' minate: thus made, though it be too weak, it is pleasant: the strength might be sufficiently augmented by pounding the coffee, as stated above, and adopting the same method with respect to the coffee grounds. Good cream too, in- stead of very middling milk, makes a vast difference in drinking coffee, however prepared; the sugar, if pure, seems of less importance, though some insist that Lisbon sugar is the best, while many others insist on the superi- ority of sugar-candy powdered. 217. Persian art of making yeast xcith pease.—The pre- servation of yeast, having been a subject of much research in Europe, the following particulars may, perhaps, be entitled to attention. On the coast of Persia bread was made in the English manner, of good wheat flour and with the yeast generally used there, which is thus pre- pared;—Take a tea cup or wineglass full of split or bruised peas, pour on them a pint of boiling water, and

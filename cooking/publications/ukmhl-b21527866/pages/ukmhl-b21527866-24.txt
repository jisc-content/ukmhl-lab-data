Useful properties of charcoal.—All sorts of glass vessels and other utensils may be purified from long re- tained smells of every kind, in the easiest and most per- fect manner, by rinsing them out with charcoal powder, after the grosser impurities have been scoured oft w ith sand and pot-ash. Rubbing the teeth, and washing out the mouth, with charcoal powder, will render the teeth beautifully white, and the breath perfectly sweet, where an offensive breath has been ow'ing to a scorbutic dis- position of the gums. Putrid water is immediately de- prived of its smell by charcoal. 57.

115 THE RECEIPT BOOK. 400. Electuary for the rheumatism.—Take of conserve of roses, two ounces; cinnabar of antimony, levigated, an ounce and a half; gum guaiacum, in powder, an ounce; syrup of ginger, a sufficient quantity to make an electuary. In obstinate rheumatisms, which are not accompanied with a fever, a tea-spoonful of the electuary may be taken twice-a day with considerable advantage. EMULSIONS. Emulsions, beside their use as medicines, are also proper vehicles for certain substances, which could not otherwise be conveniently taken in a liquid form. Thus, camphor tritura- ted with almonds, readly unites with water into an emulsion. Pure oils, balsams, rasins, and other similar substances, are likewise rendered miscible with water by the intervention of mucilages. 401. Common emulsion.—Take of sweet almonds, an ounce bitter almonds, a drachm ; water, two pints. Let the almonds be blanched, and beat up in a marble mortar adding the water by little and little, so as to make an emulsion : afterwards let it be stained. 402. Arabic emulsions.—This is made in the same manner as the above, adding to the almonds, while beating, two ounces and a half of the mucilage of gum arabic. Where cooling liquors are necessary, these emulsions may be used as ordinary drink. ^03. Camphorated emulsion.—Take of camphor, half a drachm; sweet almonds, half a dozen ; white sugar, half an ounce; mint-water, eight ounces. Grind the camphor and almonds well together in a stone mortar, and add, by degrees, the mint-water: then strain the liquQr, and dissolve in it the sugar. \ In fevers and other disorders which require the use of catu* phor, a table spoonful of this emulsion may be taken every two or three hours.

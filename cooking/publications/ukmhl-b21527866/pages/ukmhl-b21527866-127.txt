117 THE RECEIPT BOOK. FOMENTATIONS. \ Fomentations are generally intended either to ease pain, by taking off tention and spasm ; or to brace and restore the tone and vigour of those parts to which they are applied. 1 he first of these intentions may generally be answered by warm water and the second by cold. Certain substances, however, are usually added to the water, with a view to heighten its effects, as anodynes, aromatics, astringents, &c. We shall therefore subjoin a few of the most useful fomentations, that people may have it in their powder to make use of them, if they choose. 406. Anodyne fomentation.—Take of white poppy-heads, two ounces ; elder flowers, half an ounce; water'three pmts. Boil till one pint is evaporated, and strain out the liquor. 1 his fomentation, as its title expresses, is used for relieving acute pain. 407. Aromatic fomentation.—Take of Jamaica pepper half an ounce, red wine, a pint. Boil them a little, and then strain the liquor. This is intended, not only as a topical ap- plication for external complaints, but also for relieving the in- ternal parts. Pains of the bowels, which accompany dysen- teries, and diarrhseas, flatulent colics, uneasinessof thestomach, and retching to vomit, are frequently abated by fomenting the abdomen and region of the stomach with a warm liquor. 408. Decoction for fomentation.—Take tops of worm-wood and camomile flowers, dried, of each two ounces ; water two quarts. After a slight boiling, pour off the liquor.-- Brandy or spirit of wine may be added to this fomentation, in such quantity as the particular circumstances of the case shall require ; but these are not always necessary. 409. Emollient fomentation.—This is the same as the com- mon decoction. 410. Strengthening fomentation.—Take of oak bark, one ounce; granate peel, half an ounce; alum, two drachms; smiths’ forge water, three pints. Boil the water with the bark

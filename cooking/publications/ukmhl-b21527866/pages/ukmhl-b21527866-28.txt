Observations upon a leech, by a gentleman tebo kept one several years for the purpose of a iveathcr glass. A phial of water, containing a leech, I kept on the Irame ol my lower chamber window sash, so that when I looked in the morning, I could know what would be the wreather of the following day. If the Aveather proves serene and beautitul, the leech lies motionless at the bottom of the glass, and rolled to- gether in a spiral form. If it rains before or after noon, it is found crept up to the top of its lodging, and there it remains till the wea- ther is settled. . . If we are to have w ind, the poor prisoner gallops through its limpid habitation, with amazing swiftness, and seldom rests till it begins to blow hard.

When this has stood to settle, the clear is to be poured into the vat. Proceed as before with a like quantity ol pearl- ash, and a third time if required. Then pour grounds and all into the vat. A pound of bran, well cleared Irom the flour should be put in the bottom of the vat, and the solution of indigo poured upon it; the vat must then be stirred, observing no heat must be applied to it till it comes to a hand heat, when a little heat must be added to keep this degree of heat up, It is continued in this state until it turns green ; when this appears stir it, and a scum will rise on the top of the vat; this should be blown off; and if it again forms, the vat is come to work, and a pattern maybe dipped in ; if it striked, make a fresh liquor with a pound of pearl-ash, and two-ounces of madder , pour this in, rake it well, in three hours itwill be fit for use. 475.

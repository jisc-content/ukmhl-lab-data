THE RECEIPT BOOK. 123 In the low state of nervous fevers, hiccupping- convul- sions, and other spasmodic affections, two table spoonsful of this julap may be taken every two or three hours. 427. Saline julap.—Dissolve two drachms of salt ot tartar, in three ounces of fresh lemon-juice strained; when the effervescence is over, add of mint-water and common water, each two ounces; of simple syrup, one ounce. This removes sickness at the stomach, relieves vomiting-, promotes prespiration, and may be of serivce in fevers, especially of the inflammatory kind. 428. Vomiting julap.—Dissolve four grains of emetic tartar in eig-ht ounces of water, and add to it half an ounce of the syrup of clove July-flowers. In the beginning1 of fevers, where there is no inflam- mation, this julap may be given in the dose of one table spoonful every quarter of an hour till it operates. Anti- monial vomits serve not only to evacuate the contents of the stomach, but to promote the different excretions. Hence they are found in fevers to have nearly the same effect as Dr. James's Powder. 429. Ointment for the ring worm, and cutaneous erup- tious.—Diluted citron ointment; common lard, equal parts. Mix them well. The parts should be touched with this ointment nightly. 430. Rheumatic liniment.—Spirits of camphor, two ounces; liquor of ammonia, half an ounce; oil of rose- mary, lifteen drops. Mix. Rub this liniment well on the parts affected with rheu- matic pains, as often as requisite. 431. To remove warts.—A bit of impore potass, or lapis infernal is; should be applied to the warts, or gently rub- bed on the surface of them a few minutes, so as to leave a kind of whitish paste upon them ; on this should be ap- plied, a stripe of sticking plaster, and to remain on for a week; on removing the plaster, if the warts are not gone, a similar application must be used.

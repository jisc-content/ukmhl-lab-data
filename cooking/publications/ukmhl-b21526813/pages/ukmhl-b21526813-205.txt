203 HYS HYP dared, it only requires one vapour bath, rapidly increased to 37 Cen- tigrade, then slowly to 63 ; the patient must confine himself to his chamber until the cure is com- plete. Dr. Buisson mentions other curious facts. An American had been bitten by a rattlesnake, about eight leagues from home; wishing to die in the bosom of his family, he ran the greater part of the way home, and going to bed perspired profusely, and the wound healed as any simple cut. The bite of the tarantula is cured by the exercise of dancing, the free perspiration dissipating the virus. If a young child be vaccinated and then be made to take a vapour bath, the vaccine does not take. Galignani. When first bitten, or when the symptoms are manifest, give a dessert-spoonful of the anti-spas- modic tincture, and a mild injec- tion. Then proceed to the vapour bath, as hot as the patient can bear it. After the bath, give an emetic. The wound should be cupped, and caustic potash applied afterwards. Apply a yeast poultice, and keep up the discharge. Add a little powdered charcoal to the poultice. Repeat the vapour bath and the injection every ten or twelve hours. The diet should be light and unstimulating; the drink sudorific, or promoting per- spiration. Drink oft a decoction of skullcap, and at night take sulphur and cream of tartar.

The following is a good pill for melan- choly ;—Lobelia Seed, 1 drachm ; Extract of Dandelion, 3 drs.; Bloodroot, 1 dr.; Senna, powder- ed, 2 drs.; Cayenne, 1 dr.; vale- rian powdered, 2 drs.; butternut powdered, 3 drs.

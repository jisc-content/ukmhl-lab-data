LANDLORD AND TENANT. —A yearly tenant must give notice to quit his premises half a year be- fore the time of the expiration of the current year of his tenancy. If by agreement, a quarter’s notice is to be sufficient, such notice must always expire with the tenancy if that is yearly.—If a landlord neg- lects to repair the premises, accor- ding to his covenant, the tenant may maintain an action against him; but such neglect does not absolve the tenant from pay- ment of the rent.—A landlord can legally dispose of goods taken under a distress for rent, by appraisement, without putting them up by auc- tion.—A landlord may take pos- session of the goods of his tenant s lodger which have been distrain- ed under distress for rent; or he may maintain an action tor pound breach. A landlord can be com- pelled, according to the Small Tenement "Act, to pay the poor rates, if the rent is under £10 per annum.—If a landlord agrees to make repairs, and neglects to do so, the tenant may do it, and deduct the amount from the rent. But the tenant must give previous no- tice of these repairs to the landlord; the notice to be signed by himself and a witness.—If the landlord has to pay the rates, an agreement properly witnessed and signed, should be drawn up to that effect. —The payment of the rent of a house, or building of any kind is absolute, if the landlord demands it; even though the house fall down, be blown, or burnt down, the tenant is hound to pay the rent; and the tenancy can only cease by giving the proper Notice to Quit, just as if the house continued in a perfect state. When the rent is paid, the landlord is bound to give the tenant a receipt;—thus, Received of Mr. John Thomas the sum of (here insert the amount) for half year's rent due on the First day of May last, for the House, No, Street. £— (Stamp) Robert Southey.

443 WEI WAT off the fire, and let it settle; then pour it into a china bowl and add sugar, sherry, and nutmeg’ to your taste. WATER PIPES, to manage in winter.—In frost cover the wa- ter pipes with hav, or straw bands. WATERPROOF BOOT SOLES.—If hot tar and rosin be applied to boot soles, it will make them waterproof. Apply it with a piece of old flannel, or cloth, and dry it in by the fire. The opera- tion may be repeated two or three times during the winter, if neces- sary. It makes the surface of the leather quite hard, so that it wears longer. Oil or grease softens the sole, and does not keep the water out. WATERPROOFING, for Boots and Shoes.—Linseed oil, 1 pint; oil of turpentine, or nap - tha, 3 pint; yellow wax, J lb.; burgundy pitch, J lb. Melt to- gether with a gentle heat. For use, rub into the leather before the fire. WATERPROOFING SHOES —Melt bees’ wax and mutton suet, and when you take from the fire, add a tea-spoonful of turpentine. Or, India rubber and gutta percha, dissolved in good naphtha. Or, yellow wax, 4 ozs; rosin, 4 ozs.; linseed oil, 1 pint; oil of turpentine, a quarter of a pint. Melt over a slow fire, and when melted, take from the fire, and add the turpentine, and stir well. Remember that it is very inflam- mable. When required for use, melt and apply. WATERPROOF CLOTH.— Apply to the calico or linen two coats of boiled oil, a little rosin or burgundy pitch, and a small quan- tity of turpentine. Hang up to dry. WATERPROOF CLOTH.— To one ounce of melted white wax add one quart of spirits of turpen- tine ; when thoroughly mixed and cold, dip the cloth in it and hang it up to dry. WATERPROOF COMPOSI- TION.—Mix gas tar, common oil, and slaked lime, and use as paint, applying three or four coats. Pe- troleum oil, and Norway tar might also be employed with advantage. WAX, Black, to make.—Take two ounces of bees’ wax, half an ounce of burgundy pitch, and melt them together, then add one ounce and a half of ivory black, ground very fine and dried. WEAK EYES. Wash fre- quently in cold water, or in a de- coction of the plant, eye-bright. Or, dissolve 4 grains of sugar of lead and crude saLammoniac, in 8 ozs. of water, to which add a few drops of laudanum. Bathe the eyes with it three or four times a day. Or bathe the eyes fre- quently in salt and water, or in weak brandy, salt, and water.

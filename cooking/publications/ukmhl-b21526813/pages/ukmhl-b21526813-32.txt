Remedies for Poi- soning by.—Mustard and water; and other emetics, or milk, lime water, and white of an egg, as much as can be got down. Also Clam- ber’s or Epsom salts; chalk and water, or in linseed tea, if at hand. In case of inflammation, give a clyster of gruel, Epsom salts, and treacle. ASAFCETIDA, Tincture of.— This strong solution of asafoetida gum in proof spirit, in the quan- tity of thirty to fifty drops, in a glass of pennyroyal or peppermint ■water, is much and successfully employed as a remedy for lowness of spirits, hysteric and fainting fits; different nervous complaints, spasmodic colic and asthma. The addition of ten drops of sal volatile to each dose will render it more pleasant to the palate, and at the same time coincide with its virtues. A mixture of one-third of tinc- ture of asafoetida, and two of par- egoric elixir, taken in the dose of a teaspoonful, has been found par- ticularly serviceable in relieving asthma in languid constitutions, and chronic difficulty of breathing, by expelling air from the stomach promoting expectoration, and al- laying irritation, (see Asthma.) In the hooping-cough, unattended with -fever, it will prove equally beneficial, in doses proportioned to the age of the patient, viz. to a child of two years old, six drops, increasing two drops for every year.

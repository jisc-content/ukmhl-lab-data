BLISTERS, Management of— Spread the plaster thinly on paper, or linen, and rub over it a few drops of olive oil. In this way the blister acts speedily, and with less irritation than usual. BLISTERED FEET.—Before and after walking, wash the feet well in a solution of Sal Ammo- niac-half an ounce in two quarts of water. Let not the stocking be wrinkled, or much mended, when you walk. Easy boots and shoes should be worn, and very smooth next to the sole of the foot.

BLOOD-ROOT ; Sanguinana Canadensis.—Mi American plant. It has great emetic and expectorant influence. It is • tonic, narcotic, stimulant, emetic, according to the dose and form in which it is admin- istered. In a large dose it produ- ces nausea, &c. In small doses, it acts as a stimulant and tonic. Like digitalis, it calms the pulse. It is an invaluable remedy in dis- eases of the chest, lungs, and livei. Dr. Beach, of America, says, “ In plethoric constitutions, when respiration is very difficult, the cheeks and hands livid, the pulse full, soft, vibrating, and easily compressed, the Blood-root has done more to obviate the symptoms and remove the disease than any other remedy used.

It should be given in quantity to cause vomiting.” Thirty drops of the saturated alcoholic solution taken three times • a day, cured a bad case of rheuma- tism in a gouty person.

In Wa- ter of the Chest, (hydrothorax,) doses of fifty or sixty drops should be given until nausea follows each -dose. It is excellent in chest com- plaints, and excessive expectora- tion.

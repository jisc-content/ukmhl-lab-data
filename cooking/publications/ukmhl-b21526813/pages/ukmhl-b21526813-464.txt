In this work the obscure rules of other Arithmetics have been exchanged for PLAIN: and SIMPLE directions which a child may understand, and the unscientific methods of work- ing have been abandoned for those which accord with Arith- metical science. MENTAL CALCULATIONS, so very important in business, have been incorporated. OBJECT-TEACHING, or teaching by sight, (the best and most effective of all teaching) forms a prominent part in the first part of the book, and in Fractions ; and a SYSTEM OP BOOK-KEEPING has also been appended. *** It is surprising with what tenacity some School- masters cling to old usages. Disregarding all modern discoveries and improvements, they would employ the very same Educational Works by which they were taught in their childhood, although those works have been superseded by others infinitely superior. In these days of rapid intellectual development, bearing some resemblance to Railways, Electric Telegraphs, &e., Schoolmasters, Parents, and Guardians of Youth, must abandon their prej udices, and espouse those Educational Works which modern science offers them as decided improvements, or they will subject themselves to the suspicion of incompetency for teaching. The Publishers of this ARITHMETIC, had, at the first, to contend with such absurd prejudices ; but, thanks to the dis- cernment of the more intelligent Preceptors, and to the good sense of the Public, this work now commands an extensive sale, and bids fair to supplant the antiquated Editions.

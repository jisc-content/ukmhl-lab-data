2o2 MEN MEN METAL, to clean all sorts.- . Mix £ pint of neat’s foot oil with half a gill of spirits of turpentine; scrape a little rotten stone; wet a woollen rag with the mixture; dip it into the rotten stone, and rub tho metal well; wipe it off with a soft cloth; polish with dry leather, and use more of the rotten stone. As it respects steel, if it be very rusty, use a little pumice powder, or emery powder on a separate wool- len rag at the first. METAL TEA-POTS, to clean. Put into them a solution of common soda, boiling hot; let it stand 12 hours near the fire, and then rub the inside with a small brush; and, if needful, put in a second solution. MENTAL CALCULATIONS. RULE I. Find the Amount of the number of yards, lbs. <tc. at one penny, and multiply it by the price: when there is a farthing with any given number of pence, (as, 2Jd. 6}d. lOJd.) add } to what it amounts to at one penny. When there is a half-penny with any given pence, add half of the amount of what it comes to at one penny; and when 3 farthings occur, add three quarters of what it amounts to at one penny. 40 lbs. at lid. 40 at ld.=3s. 4d. x lld.=£l 16s. 8d.

To ascertain the price of any num- ber of yards, lbs., gallons, &c., at any given shillings per lb., &c. Ascertain the amount at one ship ling, and multiply it by the price. If 3 pence occur in the price, add one quarter of what it amounts to at a shilling; if 4 pence, add one third ; if 6 pence, add half; if 9 pence, add three quarters. If the pence in the price be not an aliquot part of a shilling, find for the shillings by this rule, and for the pence by the rule for pence, which amounts add together. 80 Gals, at 15s. per gal. 80 at ls.=£4 Xl5s.=£60. Ans. With regard to fractional parts of a yard, lb., &c., when the price is shillings per yard, reckon the quart- ers as 3 pence, the half as 6 pence, and the three-quarters as 9 pence. 50} yards at 6s. per yd. 50} at ls.= £2 10s. 3d. x6=£15 Is. 6d.

When }, }, or } occur in the quan- tity, reckon them with the yards, &c. at the rate of Id. per yard, i. e. for a quarter of a yard reckon }d.; for a half a yard add }d., &c. S3T Many figures might be saved by multiplying the shillings of the price by the number of £ that the quantity amounts to at Is., which will produce the answer in £.

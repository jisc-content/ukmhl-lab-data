A 1 General Directions Measuring.â€”Flour, sugar, salt, ground spices, should always be sifted before measuring. A cup is a breakfast-cup holding half a pint. The spoons are the silver ones in general use. A spoonful of dry material is one in which the convexity at the top corresponds to the concavity of the spoon. A scant spoonful should be made level with the edges of the spoon. In measuring half a tea-spoon of dry material, fill it first, and then divide it with a knife the length of the spoon. It is necessary to remember in measuring half or quarter cups that a cup is smaller at the bottom than the top. It is most satisfactory to have half- pint measures which are marked into quarters.

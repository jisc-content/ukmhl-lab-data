110 Charlotte Russe 5 oz. gelatine 1 pint cream 12 lady fingers 3 table-spoons powdered sugar 1 tea-spoon vanilla 1 table-spoon sherry or liqueur Set the gelatine to soak in cold water. Line a mould with lady fingers, leaving a little space between each. Whip the cream (see p. 3). Add the sugar, vanilla, and wine. Dissolve the gelatine in as little boiling water as possible. Strain it very slowly through a fine strainer into the cream, stirring rapidly all the time. Stir until the cream begins to stiffen. Then pour it into the mould and set in a cold place or on ice. The mould may be lined with plain or rolled wafers instead of lady fingers. The cream may be flavoured with coffee, choco- late, or any fruit syrup.

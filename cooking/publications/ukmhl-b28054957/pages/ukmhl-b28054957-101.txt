89 General Instructions It lias been found difficult in the receipts which follow, owing to the variation of the quantity of juice in lemons, etc., to give the exact quantity of gelatine required. /I safe rule in making jellies is to use 2 ozs. of gelatine to every one and three-quarter quarts of liquid. In summer 2 ozs. of gelatine will be needed to each quart and a half. (This must include all liquid flavourings and be very carefully measured.) The best gelatine is now so pure, that it is practically unnecessary to go to the trouble of making jelly from calfs feet, a receipt for which has, however, been given. More elaborate jellies are made by the addition of fruit. To do this, pour jelly into a mould to the depth of half an inch. When set, arrange on it a layer of perfectly fresh ripe fruit—strawberries, cherries, grapes, pine-apple, peaches, oranges, etc. —adding another layer of jelly, and when that is set, more fruit, and so on, until the mould is full. During the process the mould should be kept on ice, so that the jelly will set quickly. Before putting jelly into a mould, dip it in very cold water, and invert for a moment. Pour in the jelly while still wet.

Pastry Book 43 Fruit Fritters Fritters may be made of apples, bananas, oranges, apricots, pine-apple, peaches, etc. The fruit should be ripe and perfect. Cut apples across in slices about a third of an inch thick. Take out the core from the centre of each piece. Cut each slice of pine-apple into four pieces. Slice bananas lengthwise, cutting each slice in half if too long. Cut peaches and apricots in quarters. All fruit for fritters is best soaked for a couple of hours in well-sweetened brandy, rum or kirsch, to which a little ground cinnamon and the finely grated peel and the juice of a lemon have been added. The fruit must be well drained before it is dipped in batter. When this is not done each piece of fruit should be sprinkled with sugar, a very little lemon juice and spice. For frying see general directions.

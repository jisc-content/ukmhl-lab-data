Preface The following pages naturally contain only a brief selection from the thousands of sweets which exist; they have been chosen with an eye to dainty quality, and to simplicity, and every receipt has been tested. Three words concerning sweets: French white fire-proof dishes are better for baking puddings than the ordinary English culinary utensils ; small cups or glasses are more charming receptacles for jellies, creams and custards than large dishes ; and the magic properties of salt (even in the prepara- tion of sweets) cannot be too much insisted upon, the deprecatory English cook to the contrary.

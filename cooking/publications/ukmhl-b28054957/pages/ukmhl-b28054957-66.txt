General Directions 54 Souffles should be made in dishes made for the purpose and must be served in the same. The dish should be spread with cold butter, the souffle mixed not a moment before it is time to put it in the oven (which should be moderately hot), and served immediately it is taken out. A souffle is better underdone than overdone. Great care must be taken to whisk in the whites of eggs as quickly and lightly as possible. It is best to tie a piece of buttered paper round the outside of the mould, so that the souffle does not run over. In any case room must be given for it to rise. If there is danger of the souffle burning, cover it with a sheet of greased paper.

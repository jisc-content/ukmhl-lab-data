26 Baked Apples—I Peel and core several good cooking apples. Butter on both sides as many small slices of bread as you have apples. Fill the centre of each apple with butter. Sprinkle thickly with sugar. Bake in a moderate oven three-quarters of an hour. Baste five or six times with the juice and butter, adding more butter if necessary. Serve hot, having filled the centre of each apple with jelly. Baked Apples—II Peel and core several good cooking apples, and fill the hollow centres with lemon sugar (see p. 164). Put a little water in the bottom of a shallow tin. Set the apples in it close together. Bake in a quick oven, basting often with the syrup formed by the water and sugar. Baked Bananas Skin several bananas and cut them lengthways in half. Place on a tin. Sprinkle well with sugar, and put several small lumps of butter on them. Bake twenty minutes in a moderate oven, basting occasionally and adding a very little hot water if there is not sufficient juice with which to baste.

General Directions 49 D A special pan should be kept for omelets. It must be used for nothing else. After being used it is best to scour it with a little salt and vinegar in order to keep a perfectly smooth surface. Melt a tea-spoon of butter in the pan, let it run well over it, bub do not let it burn. Pour in the eggs. Lift the egg mixture at the sides as it cooks so as to let the uncooked part flow under. This must, however, only be done at first or the surface will be roughened. When the egg is firm underneath but still soft on top, fold one side carefully over the other with a knife. Slip gently on a very hot plate. Serve quickly and very hot. Add a little salt to the eggs whilst beating.

General Directions 14 In making custards it is of the utmost im- portance that they should not be allowed to boil. They are best made in a porcelain double - boiler or in a bain-marie (see p. 15). Cooked white of egg may be added as a garnish to any custard. To prepare it, beat the whites to a stiff froth, and either put it on a sieve and steam it; or drop a tablespoonful at a time into boiling milk, removing it with a skimmer as soon as firm. Whipped cream or ratafias may also be used.

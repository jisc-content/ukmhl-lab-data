Pastry Book 99 mixture begins to thicken. Add the gelatine, which lias been dissolved in a very little water Mix thoroughly. Put through a line hair sieve into a basin. Beat until cold. Add the vanilla and the cream whipped. Pour into a mould and set on ice, if possible. This cream can be flavoured with three table- spoons of maraschino which should be added with the cream. In this case the mould used may be lined with maraschino jelly (see p. 94) To do this fill the mould with jelly to the depth of an inch. When it is firm, set a smaller mould inside the mould in use, fill the space all round it with jelly and leave till set. Then pour a little warm water on the inner mould to loosen it. Take it out carefully and fill the space with cream. The inner mould should be about an inch and a half smaller in diameter than the outer mould. A small cup of strong, clear coffee can be used as flavouring, or one table-spoon lemon juice and one gill rum.

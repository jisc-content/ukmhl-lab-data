Pastry Book 3 To steam puddings.—Cover the basin (which should be buttered) with buttered paper. Set in a covered steamer over boiling water. Keep the water boiling hard. Bain-marie.—Bain-maries can be bought, but a saucepan placed upon a trivet in a larger sauce- pan containing hot water docs equally well. Gelatine.—Gelatine should always be soaked in cold water for one or two hours before using. Then it should be dissolved in a very little hot water, unless otherwise specified, and strained. The greatest care must be taken in adding liquid gelatine to a cold mixture, as it so quickly solidifies. Strain it first, and then very gradually add it to the mixture, beating hard all the time. To whip cream.—Whip cream in as cold a place as possible. It will whip easiest if it has been kept on ice for two or three hours. While whipping, remove the froth as it comes on to a sieve to drain. The liquid cream which drains off can be returned to the basin and whipped again. Sugar, can be added before or after whipping. The cream will be lighter if the sugar is whipped with it. To melt chocolate.—Put the chocolate in a saucepan on the oven when the heat is very moderate. Watch that it does not burn.

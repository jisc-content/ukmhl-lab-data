Pastry Rook 115 chocolate, to another a few drops of cochineal, and to the fourth a little sage colouring. M ix each well. Whip some cream with the white of an egg, and sweeten it and flavour with vanilla. Pile it in the centre of a dish. Put the differently coloured chestnut purees separately through a coarse sieve, and arrange lightly around and on the cream. This is equally good and simpler to make if colouring is not used. Pile the sweetened and sifted chestnuts on a dish and cover with whipped cream, or garnish with slices of sweetened orange. Meringues Whip four whites of eggs and a little salt until frothy, gradually adding while doing so a break- fast-cup of powdered sugar. Beat until perfectly smooth and firm. Cover a board with white paper. Drop the mixture, one and a half table- spoons at a time, in oblong shapes upon the paper. Put the board in a very slack oven. When a crust has been formed, scoop out the soft centre of each meringue and turn it over to dry inside. If the meringues do not come off the paper easily, moisten it on the under-side.

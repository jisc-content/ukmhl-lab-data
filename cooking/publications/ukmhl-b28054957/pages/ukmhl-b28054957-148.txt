General Directions The following American receipts are all good. Care, however, must be taken in baking that there is a good bottom heat, or the under crust will be sodden. The pies should be made in shallow tins about 8 to 9 inches in diameter. Puff paste may be used; but No. II. pastry (see p. 125) is very satisfactory. It should be rolled very thin. Where a covering of pastry is used, it should be slit across the centre in three places, about two inches long, to allow the steam to escape.

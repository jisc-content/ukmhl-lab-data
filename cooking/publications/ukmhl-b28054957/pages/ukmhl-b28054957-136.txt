The Pudding Book 124 fill the dish with well-sweetened stewed fruit. Moisten the edges of the disli with white of egg and replace the crust. In making open tarts and tartlets, when the tin is lined with pastry it can be filled with rice and baked. This is in order to keep the crust crisp. The rice must be taken out and the fruit or jam put in its place just before serving.

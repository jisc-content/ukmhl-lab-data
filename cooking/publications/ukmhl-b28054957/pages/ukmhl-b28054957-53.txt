General Directions 41 Fritters are crisper if fried in clarified fat than in lard. In making fruit fritters dip each piece of fruit into batter. See that it is well covered. Drop fritters, a few at a time, into smoking hot fat, being careful that they do not touch each other; fry a rich yellow. Take out with a skimmer and set in the oven for a few minutes on soft paper to drain. Sift sugar over the fritters and serve with a wine or fruit sauce.

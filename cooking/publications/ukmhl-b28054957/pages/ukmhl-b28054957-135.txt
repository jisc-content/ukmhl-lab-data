General Directions In making pastry, the colder the hands of the maker, the water and the room, the better. A marble slab is the best thing on which to make it: otherwise a hard board which is kept for pastry only should be used. Use iced water for mixing, when possible. Pastry will be flakier if set on ice before it is finally rolled out for use. The flour used should be very dry and should be sifted with a little salt. Use the best flour onlv and fresh butter, or half butter, half lard. Use as little water as possible. Never knead pastry. Use the hands as little as possible. Mix with a knife unless otherwise specified. Bake in a moderate or quick oven. Baking powder, in the proportion of one tea- spoon to each quart of flour, may be added when eggs are not used. The baking powder should be sifted twice with the flour before mixing. It is better to bake pastry separately from the fruit when possible. It will thus be much crisper. To do this till the dish which is to be used with stiff crumpled paper, over which a smooth and well-buttered piece should be laid. Cover with the pastry and bake. Remove the kpastryTand 12T

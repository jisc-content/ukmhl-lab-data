General Directions To fry pancakes, melt a piece of fresh butter in a small frying-pan. When it is very hot pour in sufficient batter to cover the frying-pan with a thin layer. Fry over a clear fire, shaking the pan constantly. Loosen the edges of the pancake, when set, with a knife. Give a good shake and toss, bringing the pancake down on the other side. As each is done, put it on a very hot plate in the oven and continue frying the others as quickly as possible.

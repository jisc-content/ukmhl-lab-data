General Directions 19 The milk for baked custards should always be boiled. It is of the greatest importance in baking custards to have a slow oven. It is a good thing to leave the oven door a little open for a short time. It is best, although not necessary, to stand the dish of custard in another containing hot water. The water should simmer. Custards can also be cooked by placing them in a large saucepan containing hot water, which should reach half-way up the mould or cups used. The water should be brought to a boil. Then the saucepan should be set back where it will simmer gently, and it should be covered. This method takes about an hour. It is best to let the custard stay in the water until it is cold.

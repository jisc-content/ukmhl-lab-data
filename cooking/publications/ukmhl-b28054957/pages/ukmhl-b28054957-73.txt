61 General Directions Do not more than half fill the tin. Tie a piece of buttered paper right round the outside of the tin, letting it project about two inches above the tin. Set the souffle dish in a vessel of simmering water, which should reach half way up the souffle tin and which should boil gently and be replenished from time to time with boiling water. Cook either in a very moderate oven, or on a very gentle fire. The water should only simmer. When cooked, turn the souffles out carefully and serve with cream or wine sauce.

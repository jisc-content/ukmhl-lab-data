95 fresh lemon peel, two tablespoonsful of sugar and an ounce of fresh butter; boil the whole for ten minutes and serve. Fig Sauce.—^^Wash eight ounces of pressed figs and add just enough water to soak them for twelve hours ; then add three half- pints of water, the grated peel of a fresh lemon, a teaspoonful of cornflour, and boil for three hours. Put it through a fine strainer and serve. Egg Sauce.—Beat into one glass of milk and one glass of water a dessertspoonful of flour and an ounce of butter ; then boil for ten minutes, pour it over two finely chopped eggs and return it to the saucepan, add two ounces of butter and again boil it for three minutes and serve. Note.—To preserve the natural colour of eggs after boiling, plunge them into cold water immediately they are removed from the stove. Plain Syrup.—A good syrup for sweetening; or preserving purposes can be made by boiling for thirty minutes in an aluminium or enamelled pan, one quart of water, and one pound of pure cane sugar : stir it, and when clearly dissolved and cooked, bottle it for use. In the stewing of fruits this is superior to adding the raw sugar. Orange Syrup.—Have two pints of sweet orange juice crushed from ripe oranges ; add to this one pint of water and one pound of pure cane sugar ; let it boil in an enamel pan for forty-five minutes and store in sealed jars. It is delicious for adding flavour etc. when stewing fruits. Note.—A variety of flavours can be got by making syrups from different fruits on somewhat the same lines as the foregoing,

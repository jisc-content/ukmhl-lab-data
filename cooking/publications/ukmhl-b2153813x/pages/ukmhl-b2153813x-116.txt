112 Porridges and Cheese. All your porridges should be cooked in double boilers or by standing a covered basin of the porridge in a saucepan with boiling water; and, as in the case of soups ; a little well browned toast, croutons, nut-rolls, or other dry food should be eaten with the porridge that it may be thoroughly salivated. There can be little doubt that insufficiently cooked, and quickly swallowed porridges are a prolific cause of digestive troubles, and unless the eater has sufficient time and patience to cheerfully salivate porridge, and soup, he had better leave it alone. Oatmeal Porridge-—Use only the pure scotch or home- grown oatmeal, it is superior to any other. Wash and pick over one measure of oatmeal and add four measures of water, this boil and simmer for three or four hours until it becomes jelly-like Serve it with nut cream and stewed fruit; or serve it with fresh cream, milk and cane sugar.

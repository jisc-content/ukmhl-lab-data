60 fryiDg-pan, if carefully used, a helpful utensil. Hasty frying and boiling in thin pans, and with a scorching fire, is bad cookery and quite unlike that which is necessary to bring forth the best flavour of the food. The frying-pan should be very thickly enamelled, or a double sheet pan, and if the latter, see that you have a layer of asbestos between the sheets; with such pans you can bring the fat to the highest temperature with the least risk of firing it. Have a deep pan, and have it so constructed with a rest that you can easily raise and lower your frying basket to the required depth; also have near it, when at work, a dra iner on to which you can put the cooked food to drain, that you may be able to serve it clean and nutty. Use only pure, and if obtainable, unsalted butter ; olive oil; or such nut and vegetable fats as are now provided at all Food Eeform Stores. Pure olive oil; nut, or vegetable fats are to be preferred to butter, as we shall presently explain. Butter seethes, boils and quickly exhausts itself—though possibly more palatable in flavour, whereas these oils, nut and vegetable fats, simmer nicely; and fry crisply and entirely free of the fatty, greasy taste of food fried in animal fats and even some butters. It is not enough to have even the proper pan, and fat, if the fat is not brought to the sight TEMPERATURE—in this Hes much of the secret of good frying. If you have not a suitable thermometer to ascertain the right temperature of the fat—and here let us say that it should reach 300 degrees, and that at 400 degrees it fires—the easiest way to ascertain it, is to dip

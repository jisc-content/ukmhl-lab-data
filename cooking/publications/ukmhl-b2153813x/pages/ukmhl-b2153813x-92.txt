Plain Rice Pudding.—Wash and drain one measure of unpolished rice, and put it into a clean pudding dish with two measures of milk ; bake it until it absorbs the milk and does not boil; then take it out ; add a teaspoonful of fresh butter and three measures of milk, with a little grated lemon peel; sweeten it to taste with sugar ; return it to the oven and slowly bake it for three hours, and you have a very nourishing pudding—each grain of rice whole, and the pudding not the least bit dry. Apple Pudding.—Mix into eight ounces of wholemeal flour six ounces of finely chopped pine kernels, and wet it with sufficient cold water to make a stiff paste ; roll the paste thinly on a paste- board and line it into a buttered pudding basin ; then fill into it the clean chopped apples and seal it with paste, adjust the basin cover, and steam the pudding for two hours.

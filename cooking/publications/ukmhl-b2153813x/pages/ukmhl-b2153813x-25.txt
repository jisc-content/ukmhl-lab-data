21 To the Housewife. To many housewives cookery is a task, and looked upon as so much drudgery, when really, it is as much a sphere of uses to the human organism in the present state of its development as a natural body, as is that of the priest to the human organism in its present state of development as a spiritual body, it is only a difference of degree, and each in its degree is as much a religious duty as is the other. Without a thorough knowledge of how to feed her household, no housewife can efficiently fill her sphere of uses. Can you calculate the difference of degree in the nature of the delights arising within you, and those you love, when partaking of that which has been worked from your own mind and hands as compared with that produced through the mind and hands of the hired servants of com- mercialism ? The deeper measures of delight springing from that which is worked from the housewife and mother, has its origin in her love of use, or service (the heavenly grace of charity) to her householdâ€”an infinitely sublimer principle of action and service than the selfish love of producing for gain or reward ; when this homely love of service flows from the home into the community, its delights will quickly submerge the selfish perversions of rapacious commercialism with its health-destroying adulterations.

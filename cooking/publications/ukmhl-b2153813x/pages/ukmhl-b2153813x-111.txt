107 through a colander and remove the stones ; return the syrup to the pan, and to each pint add one pound of loaf sugar and slowly boil for fifty minutes. When jam is made, do not remove the skins and stones, and allow only ten ounces of sugar to each pound of fruit. Orange Marmalade.— Have a dozen fleshy Seville oranges, thinly slice these and remove the pips and white peel or rag. In a china bowl add two pints of cold boiled water to each pound of fruit, and stand it for twenty-four hours ; then boil it until the rind is quite tender ; add one pound of cane sugar to each pound of boiled fruit, and cook until the rind is clear and the syrup jellies ; jar and seal it. Lemon Marmalade.—Have six smooth thin skinned lemons, remove the pips and white peel or rag, add one pint of cold boiled water to each pound of fruit and stand it in a china bowl for twenty-four hours ; slowly boil for one hour and add one pound of cane sugar to each pound of fruit, and boil for half-an-hour, or until the syrup jellies. Toffee.—It is difl&cult to keep children from sweets, and where this childish appetite must be gratified, it is well this should be done cleanly therefore, make your children’s toffee at home by putting one ounce or two tablespoonsful of water into an enamel boiler ; add to this four ounces of cane sugar, and slowly boil to a golden brown ; then pour it on to a buttered slab or dish, and as i^ cools, cut and form it into small and varied sizes, and give these a sifting of cornstarch and store them in an air-tight canister. Larger quantities can be made, and the flavour varied, by the addition of a little butter when boiling, or by putting blanched almond halves, or walnut halves, or a little minced cinnamon on the slab and pouring the syrup over either.

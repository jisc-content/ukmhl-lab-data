91 raisins and currants, and thoroughly mix the whole ; then slowly stir this mixture into the beaten egg mixture and you will find it make a moderately thick batter ; now well beat the whole one way around the bowl with a wooden spoon; divide it into pudding boilers already buttered and slightly sifted over with castor sugar ; adjust the lids and steam at least eight hours. Serve with lemon sauce, or sauce to taste. Tapioca Jelly with Figs.—Wash and pick over three ounces of tapioca, put it into a bowl and soak it for two hours in sufficient cold boiled water to cover it. Pour boiling water over eight ounces of figs and cleanse them ; then finely chop these and add them to the tapioca with the juice of two ripe oranges. Butter a pudding boiler and sift over it a light layer of fine sugar, fill in the pudding, and steam it for four hours. Serve it with lemon cream ; or put it into a jelly mould and let it cool ; or turn it into a glass dish and daintily arrange over a beaten mixture made from the whites of three fresh eggs and two ounces of castor sugar. Black Crown Pudding-—Butter a pudding boiler and give it a light sifting of sugar ; line it with four ounces of washed currants ; then beat together two eggs, one ounce of cane sugar, three gills of milk and four ounces of wholemeal flour and pour this into the currant lined boiler ; steam it for two and a half hours and serve with lemon cream. Semolina Pudding (1)—Grate the peel of three lemons into half-a-pint of water and boil it a few minutes, strain it and return to the boiler, then stir in two ounces of semolina, and when it is nearly cold beat into it one gill of water with the yolks of two eggs, one ounce of castor sugar and a little grated nutmeg ; pour it into a china dish and bake in a moderate oven for half an hour, then add the whites of the eggs beaten to a stiff paste as a face to the pudding, with a little red currant jelly edging. Again bake it a few minutes and serve hot.

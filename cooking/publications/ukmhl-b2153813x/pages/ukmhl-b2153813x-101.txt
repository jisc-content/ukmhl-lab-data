97 alternate layers. Serve with simple salad dressing, or with two ounces of grated almonds. Note.—The average housewife finds it more difficult to move out of the old ruts of dressing with vinegar, salt, peppers and hot pungent sauces, than to secure a variety of vegetables and herbs to serve as a body to her salads; we therefore have given more attention to the dressing than the body of salads in this section of the book. A Simple Salad Dressing.—Have four tablespoonsful of fresh lemon juice, three tablespoonsful of sugar and half-a-pint of whipped milk cream, or nut cream, beat these thoroughly and pour over the salad. Salad Dressing (2).—Take the yolks of three hard boiled eggs and grate these into one teaspoonful of pure olive oil, one tablespoonful of castor sugar, and slowly beat into it two table- spoonsful of lemon juice and one tablespoonful of water until it creams, then pour it over the salad and let it stand thirty minutes before serving. Salad Dressing (3).—Whip a tablespoonful of castor sugar and a fresh egg, beat into this three tablespoonsful of thick almond cream and slowly beat in two tablespoonsful of lemon juice ; pour it over the salad and serve at once. Salad Dressing (4).—Mix two boiled eggs with two ounces of sterilized cheese, one dessertspoonful of pure olive oil, and one teaspoonful of castor sugar; beat the mixture and add one table- spoonful of lemon juice ; spread it evenly over the salad and finish with small cubes of sterilized cheese. Salad Dressing (5).—Mix three tablespoonsful of lemon juice with one tablespoonful of fine castor sugar; pour this over the salad and stand it for thirty minutes ; slice two boiled eggs and arrange neatly over the salad and sprinkle with sweetened lemon jnice and serve at once.

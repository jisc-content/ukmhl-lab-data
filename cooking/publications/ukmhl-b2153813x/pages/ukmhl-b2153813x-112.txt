108 Beverages. Science tells us that our bodies are three-fourths water; that we daily use more than four pints of water and that this should be re-placed, water must enter largely into our dietary. If we are to judge by average standards, most people know little of the taste of water ; tea and beer are the national beverages and where tea and beer are not used, the people will have their water flavoured. Water to be quite healthy should be soft and boiled, distilled free of impurities and minerals; and when flavoured, fruit juices, pure honey, or cane sugar should be used. In addition to its palatabiiity, the juice of fruits is a natural purifier or antiseptic to the water, and to the digestive system; to sickly people, there are no therapeutic agents to equal water, fruit juice, and pure honey—if rightly administered, or applied. The universal custom is to drink at meals, and drinking at meals is an injurious habit—if too largely indulged; the salivary and peptic glands secrete less of their fluids when the food is largely diluted with meal drinks, and digestion consequently is imperfect. The liberal use of fruits and vegetables greatly lessens the craving for meal drinks, and add considerably to the pleasure of eating, and the easy, free secretion of digestive fluids ; where fruits and fruit juices are not palatable, and the un- regenerate appetite calls for the usual drinks, it is well to substitute for these a good quality of coffee, clean, not too highly roasted, and absolutely free from gas and coke

3 PREFATORY NOTES. (SECOND EDITION). It is not the lack of heart so much as the lack of hand, that has prolonged the delay in meeting the constant demand for a new edition of this little book. In its production, the same principles have been our guides, and the same order maintained in its arrangement, as in the first edition. Some slight alterations have been made in the text, several new facts, and many fresh recipes have been inserted, which, with the much improved style and quality of its new dress, will, we hope, enhance its usefulness, and be a little compensation to those who have long and patiently awaited its appearance. There is no section of the book to which special refer- ence need here be made ; it should be read from the be- ginning to the end, for, unlike most cookery books, it is one of principles as well as of practice, and is again offered suggestively to an age much permeated with the thought, that present knowledge and practice in matters pertaining to Food and Cookery are not a finality.

63 Nuts, and Nut Cakes, Etc. As a people we have grown to the mistaken idea, that nuts are a very indigestible, and consequently a very innutritions food ; and this mistaken idea has its origins in the mistaken way that nuts are usually eaten. Like most other foods when unripe ; improperly prepared, or hastily eaten, they must be a cause of indigestion, and probably are discharged from the system in quite an unchanged condition ; but when well-ripened ; milled or pulverised (and in the case of chestnuts, and pea-nu:s well-cooked), and thoroughly masticated there can be no more nutritious food than nuts. To eat nuts between meals; or at meals with other highly concentrated foodj is bad ; and to eat nuts after a substantial meal, such as a dinner, is infinitely worse. Nuts, as has already been stated, contain a very high percentage of the proteid and fat elements of food and this being so, there should be discretion used in the selection and com- bination of other foods or the eater will be sure in some form, to suffer the ill-effects of an excess of nourish- ment. Nuts, when well-ripened, milled, or made into butter, and eaten with unfermented bread or biscuits, and ripe juicy, or stewed fruits, are most nutritious and easily digested—even by many stomachs that reject all other foods—in fact such a combination of foods is an ideal diet, and if the proportions are accurate, no other food can be so conducive to good health, energy, and executiveness.

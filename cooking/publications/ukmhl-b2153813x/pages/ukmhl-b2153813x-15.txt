11 Had they the courage to break with tradition and prejudice, and allow their perceptive and reflective facultiies freedom in the pursuit of knowledge, they would be amazed at the wealth of novel and varied food combinations, enormously higher in nutriment than flesh-meat, that can be palatably produced free of all which is injurious. It may encourage some if a few comparisons of the food and monetary value of this, and the flesh-meat eating systems were here set forth. The housewife knows that one and a half pounds of lean beef can be bought for a shilling, also that four pounds of peas can be bought at the same price but, she probably does not know that the food value is immensely unequal; in her shilling’s worth of beef she has only seven ounces of nourishment, whereas her shilling’s worth of peas will yield her three and a half pounds of nutritment. She knows that six pounds of lentils can be bought for a shilling, and that for the same sum she can buy one and a half pounds of mutton but, it will probably surprise her to learn that her shilling’s worth of lentils would yield her five pounds of nourish- ment, whilst her shilling’s worth of mutton would yield her only seven ounces. If she has a liking for poultry 1 it can be bought at tenpence per pound and will yield her five ounces of nourishment, whilst one pound of shelled walnuts at tenpence would yield her thirteen ounces, and so we might go on with our comparisons were it necessary and we had not confidence that the average intelligence of the community, freed from prejudice, will perceive the advantages accruing from the exercise of a little more

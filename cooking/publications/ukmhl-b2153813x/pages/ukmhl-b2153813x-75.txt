71 Vegetable, Pulse, and Nut Pies, and Puddings. Mixed Pie.—Stew for two hours four medium size onions, one small head of celery, two teacupsful of flaked walnuts, and half-a-teaspoonful of mace in just enough water to cover them, then remove the celery and let the stew cool, then mix it into two tablespoonsful of soaked tapioca ; have a well-buttered pie dish, put into it the mixture, and over it pour a fresh whisked egg with a little of the stew ; make a crust of creamed potatoes, and bake in a hot oven until nicely browned. Mushroom Pie.—Clean two pounds of fresh mushrooms and fry in a little butter; add to these one pound of fresh steamed young broad beans, and two finely chopped boiled eggs ; beat these together until well mixed ; then put the mixture into a buttered pie dish, and over it slowly pour two whipped eggs, and a pint of rich brown gravy. Make a thick crust by rubbing five ounces of fresh butter into half-a-pound of wholemeal flour, and lay it over the mixture and bake it in a brisk oven until brown. Chestnut Pie.—Take a pound of chestnuts and blanch them, fry them in butter to a golden brown ; two large onions ; boil two eggs, and clean a tablespoonful of parsley ; run the whole through a mincer, and lay it in a buttered pie dish ; have two firm tomatoes and slice these neatly over the mixture ; then make a thick crust by mixing four ounces of fresh, or nut butter, into half-a-pound of wholemeal flour, and put this over the mixture and tomatoes and bake the pie in a hot oven until brown. Macaroni and Tomato Pie.—Wash two ounces of mac- aroni, and boil it in half-a-pint of water until it is soft and not pulpy ;

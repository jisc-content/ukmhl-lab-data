64 spoonsful of cooked carrot, and beat into it a fresh egg; then line a buttered basin with it; now take your macaroni and drain it through a colander ; mix into it two fresh eggs, and pour it into the lined basin and steam it for two hours. When served use hot beet, root and lemon sauce ; for the sauce use the water drained from the macaroni. Macaroni Roast.—Stew eight ounces of onions in just sufficient water to cover them, and when almost cooked add two ounces of finely-broken macaroni and stew it another hour, or until the water is quite absorbed ; then turn it into a colander, and add a dessertspoonful of powdered sage; a teaspoonful of ground walnuts and three well-beaten eggs ; mix the whole, and put it into a well- buttered dish and roast it until nicely browned. Pyramids of Macaroni.—Steam two pounds of young green peas, then crush them into a pulp and beat into them three fresh eggs and a little seasoning ; form this into a cone, then mince four ounces of cooked macaroni and form it into long rolls: then dip these into flour, and stick them around and upon the cone, and roast it in a moderate oven for one hour ; use butter for basting, and brush the whole with the white of an egg about ten minutes before you remove it from the oven. Lentil Roast.—To ten ounces of cooked lentils add one large minced onion ; two ounces of ground walnuts ; one ounce of bread crumbs ; and four ounces of tomato pulp ; well mix it all and add two beaten eggs ; then neatly form it into a roll and roast it in a moderate oven with a butter basting. Haricot Roast.—Mix into twelve ounces of cooked haricot beans ; four ounces of minced onion ; two beaten eggs; and a pinch of grated nutmeg ; then form it into a neat roll, and place it on a buttered dish; cook it for two hours to a golden brown; serve it with tomato gravy.

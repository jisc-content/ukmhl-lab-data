57 spoonsful of wholemeal flour, two table-spoonsful of castor sugar, a little fresh grated lemon flavouring, and a few clean sultanas, then mix the whole before you pour into it two well-beaten fresh eggs ; if the eggs provide not enough liquid to make a stift paste, then add a little boiled or sterilized new milk. Divide and shape it into small scones of about half-an-inch thickness, and bake in a hot oven for thirty minutes. Cocoanut Rusks.—Flake six ounces of cocoanut, and add to it four ounces of wholemeal flour, thoroughly mix into this a beaten fresh egg, and add sufficient of the cocoanut “ milk,” drawn from the nut before it was broken, to make a moderately stiff batter which should also be light and foamy ; divide it into buttered iron shallow patty pans and bake for thirty minutes in a moderate oven. Cocoanut Gems.—Take four fresh eggs and four ouhces of fine castor sugar and beat them to a foam ; add to this seven ounces of finely-grated cocoanut, and carefully fold in five ounces of whole- meal flour ; divide into buttered gem pans, and bake in a moderate oven for thirty minutes, more or less, according to size. Cocoanut Wafers.—Rub eight ounces of very finely grated cocoanut through a meal sifter ; add eight ounces of white, or of wholemeal flour, and two ounces of butter, then mix the whole and moisten with cold water ; roll the paste as thin as paper, and cut it into ‘ ‘ fancy ’ ’ forms and sift them over with castor sugar, then bake very slowly to a nice brown colour. Sultana and Cocoanut.—Mix two ounces of pure butter into eight ounces of wholemeal flour ; then add eight ounces of finely grated cocoanut; four ounces of minced sultanas ; one ounce of fine sugar ; and add sufficient cocoanut “ milk ” to make a well-mixed dough ; then divide it into biscuits, or ‘' flats, ’ ’ and bake in a slow oven until lightly browned.

28 the contrary, an occasional fast will much benefit you. Let the rule of cooking only what you can eat without cooking, prevail in your kitchen. Milk just a little sour ; butter “just a little gone” in flavour; vegetables and fruits just a little bruised, unripe, etc., must be kept out of your kitchen, if you and your family are to be well. Watek—The need of a pure supply of water is of the greatest importance if your cookery is to be perfect, and especially is this to be so in the making of bread, cakes or pastries. To those who have not a filter or distiller ; boiling the water and storing it in pottery pans, or jars, is an excellent substitute; fill one pan, or jar, whilst using the contents of the other, and it will have time to deposit the impurities, and by ladling out what you need, you do not disturb the sediment; the reduction of disease risks, and the improved health arising from it, is sufficient consolation for the extra labour it entails. A very good, and ['easy method of distillation is a contrivance like a steamer, having a cold upper chamber into which the steam rises and is condensed, then allowed to run into a pottery jar. The value of water as a cleansing agent we all know, but its value as a means of aiding digestion and nutrition ; its contribution to the susten- ance of our bodies by dissolving and circulating the nutritive elements of our food, and its aid in cleansing the tissues of their waste products, wa do not so well know. No element has a greater influence upon the preservation, or the restoration of health, than water, hence we cannot be too careful of its purity.

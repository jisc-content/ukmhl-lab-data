93 Bread Pudding.—Slowly toast, or re-bake a few thin slices of wholemeal bread and line some of these into a pudding dish, then add a thick sprinkling of fine raisins, or sultanas, and over this put a layer of thin toast and another sprinkling of the fruit, cover this with the remainder of the toast and now add sufficient creamy milk, or almond cream to fill the dish, and slowly bake the pudding adding more milk if necessary. This pudding is very digestible and nutritious and it can be modified by adding other fruits, also by whipping a fresh egg, or two, into the milk, and by using bread and butter, however, the recipe as given, is the healthiest and best our experience has produced. Plain Macaroni or Vermicelli Pudding.—Boil in little water until quite tender two ounces of macaroni or vermicelli and add to this a pint of creamy milk, or almond cream into which there has been whipped three fresh eggs and sugar to taste, pour the whole into a pudding boiler and bake or steam it for one hour. Eversley Cream.—Have one dessertspoonful of white flour and three dessertspoonsful of sugar, beat into this a tablespoonful of milk and a fresh egg; bring a pint of fresh milk to the boil in a jug, or a duplex boiler ; then stir the mixture into the milk and let the whole simmer (not boil) for ten minutes. Served over stewed fruit, pies and puddings, it is delicious. Lemon Cream.—Grate finely four ounces of fresh lemon peel and put this into a small cheese cloth or muslin bag, boil it in one glass of water in a jug, or an enamelled pan for one hour; then remove the lemon and add a pint of milk to which has been added a well-beaten fresh egg and two ounces of castor sugar beaten together. Bring this to the boil and it is ready to serve. Creams,

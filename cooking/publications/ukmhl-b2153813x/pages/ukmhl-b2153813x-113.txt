We are well aware from observation and experience that most of what is said against tea and coffee is truth, but this truth has been got from the use of adulterated and badly prepared articles. Tea if seasonably and cleanly picked ; cleanly dried free of fermentation ; properly prepared and used in moderation is not the poisonous drink so generally denounced ; and so with coffee, where this is properly picked and dried ; cleanly and scientifically roasted, it is more than absolutely non- poisonous, it really is an aid to digestion, and possesses many curative properties, but let it be distinctly under- stood this cannot be said of tea and coffee as generally prepared and used; and where an appetite for pure water and fruit juices can be cultivated, the risks arising from the use of commercial teas and coffees are much reduced and we can eventually be freed of their evils.

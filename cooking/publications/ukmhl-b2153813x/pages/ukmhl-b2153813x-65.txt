61 a small piece of bread into the fat; and if the fat is at the right temperature the bread turns brown in fifteen seconds. Frying should be a slow and steady process. Haste and indiscretion can only yield bad results. Just as a careful gardener can judiciously produce the best results from the patient culture of his soil, and the still more patient tending of his plants, so can the patient cook by discretely tending the temperature of her ovens and pans, bring forth the finest flavours of the food, and reduce to a minimum the need of artificial flavourings, however, where the palate is so unregenerate as to demand an artificial flavour, the judicious use of lemon juice ; a “ flick ’’ of pepper, nutmeg, or cinnamon will help you in your art; and where sterilized cheese cannot be got, a little good cheddar cheese may be substituted though we cannot recommend it as a clean food. The superiority of these nut and vegetable fats over animal fats can be explained thus. Animal fats and water do not mix well, if at all, and all frying fats should readily dilute wdth water. Nut, and vegetable oils being in a state of natural emulsion can easily be diluted with water. They have not the oleaginous element characteristic of animal fats, and which is so slow of digestion, and in most cases, is not digested until the mass of food taken into the stomach has passed out of it, to be acted upon by the biliary and pancreatic juices. Nut and vegetable oils readily yield to stomach digestion, and are great conservators of time, energy and vitality

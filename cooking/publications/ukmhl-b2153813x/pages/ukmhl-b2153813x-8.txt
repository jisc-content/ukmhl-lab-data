4 PREFATORY NOTES. (FIRST EDITION). For the guidance and home-reference of patients and friends, we have frequently to write recipes of pure and nutritious food and drink, and the mode of its preparation, The time and energy thus used, we think could be devoted to other uses, if some of the recipes and our teachings in Food, Cookery, and Nutrition, were put into book form, and herein lies the reason why this little book is published. Our authority is to be found in the many of observation, wide-reading, study and experiment in the science and art of Cookery and Nutrition in relation to health and disease ; and in the measure of success attending the efforts made to improve our own health, and that of many who have consulted ui in health matters. The system is based upon the idea of maintaining HEALTH BY LIVING HEALTHILY. “ Cease to do evil, and learn to do well ” is as much science as it is Scripture, and is equally applicable to the regeneration of oufibodies, as it is to the regeneration of our souls. Observation and experience have taught us that by living upon pure food, hygienically prepared, the disease- resisting and disease-eliminating capacity of the human organism is largely increased, and this being so with individuals, we think it can be so with communities.

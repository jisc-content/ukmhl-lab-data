42 rickets and other deformities. To live exclusively iijjon fer- mented bread made from white flour would be to de'^eiop a state of disease so serious as to speedily prove fatal were we not allowed other foods, but living exclusively upon wholemeal unfermented bread would not, by a long way, be so speedily disastrous. In our prisons, and our workhouses; the inmates are chiefly fed with coarse wholemeal bread; potatoes steamed in their jackets; pea-soup ; gruel &c. ; and the average health, and death rate, of these people is greatly superior to that of every other class of the community, and this from no more likely cause than that the conservative principle, as advo- cated in this little book, is embodied in their food and cookery—a fact which should be noted by the present sitting Commission of inquiry into the physical degeneracy of the race. The present day method of excladiog the bran when making bread, is not the only way in which its nutritive and health-giving quality is lessened, The putrefactive process of making it lessens it stiii more. Yea-st as a ferment is as much, possibly more, a con- tributory cause of disease as is the exclusion of the bran. The reader needs no very extensive knowledge of Chemistry and Biology to prove this. Let him take a little moistened flour and add a little yeast in the usua-1 way of doing so ; then watch the putrefactive process develop itself; if this process is allowed to go on un- checked by the action of heat, it destroys itself by becoming a sour mass of “ living rottennessf which,

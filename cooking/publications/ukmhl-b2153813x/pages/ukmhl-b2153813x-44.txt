40 and the brutality of a commercialism which blinded his perception and appreciation of the beautiful and useful. In that sweetest and most beautiful of pastoral idylls it is written, that the lovely Ruth was gleaning in the fields when Boaz saw and loved her; and it was when threshing corn, that the revelation came to Gideon that he should be the Deliverer of Israel. The nearer an age lives to heavenly uses, the simpler and more beautiful are its science and art of food production, and the less it knows artificial means of food production with its false principles of adulteration, fermentation, and health destruction. Wherever the art of making bread is known to primitive people—and bread-making in some form is as universal as the divine providence—it is unfermented bread that is made. Those who know the land and the people, say that there is no better bread than that which to-day is made in Syria just as it was made three thousand years ago. There the women grind their own corn into wholemeal^ and wet it with pure water only, then knead it into cakes and bake it before a fire. Will it be said by our descendants three thousand years hence, that the bread-making of those days resembles the bread-making of these days when as a people we employ about forty thousand medical practitioners, and nearly ten thousand registered dentists ?—we think not, for at the rate we now are travelling doctor, and dentist—ward we shall soon be substituting “Dame Nature ” with the knights of the forceps, and that as early as infantile dentition ; we already have school children with artificial teeth.

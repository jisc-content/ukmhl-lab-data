51 fry in butter, using a thickly enamelled pan to do so ; or butter a well-heated bread griddle or “bakestone,” and drop on to this, small quantities of the mixture to the size of an ordinary muffin, and you will have what are called “ pikelets.” Be sure the batter is of the right consistency if you use the griddle. Note.—The same ingredients mixed with fresh butter-milk make delicious pan cakes, and “pikelets.” Fresh Lemon Cakes.—Soften twelve ounces of pure butter, and with a wooden spoon beat it into a cream, then add seven fresh beaten eggs and twelve ounces of sugar that have been well beaten together, add two ounces of blanched and grated almonds, six ounces of grated fresh lemon peel, and one pound of wholemeal flour, now thoroughly and quickly mix the whole by driving it around the bowl fully five minutes ; then divide it into butter-paper lined tins and bake it in a moderate oven for one hour. Lemon Drops-—Mix two ounces of fresh grated lemon peel; three table-spoonsful of wholemeal flour ; two dessert-spoonsful of castor sugar, and two ounces of pure butter ; add to this a beaten fresh egg, and knead the mixture thoroughly; then roll it to the thickness of a crown piece, cut it with a biscuit cutter, place these on buttered paper and bake them for fifteen minutes in a hot oven, then move them to a cooler oven to harden, Fruit Crisps—Take six ounces of wholemeal flour, rub well into this, four ounces of pure butter ; add four ounces of carefully picked and washed currants; then add two oundes of very finely chopped candied peel, and four ounces of sugar. Having thoroughly mixed them, you will now add a little cold boiled water, and thoroughly knead the mixture ; roll it to the requisite thick- ness, and cut it into small cakes, or biscuits, place these on buttered paper and bake them in a hot oven for fifteen, or twenty minutes.

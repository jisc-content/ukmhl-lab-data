113 Croutons.—A very simple and digestible crouton for porridges and soups can be made by cutting dry bread crusts into cubes and toasting these on a hot iron plate, or in an oven, until browned. These can be sweetened by a little sprinkling of fine sugar. Croutons (Savoury).—Make a stiff dough, as you do for crisps, with eight ounces of wholemeal flour, four ounces of butter, one ounce of grated onion and half a teaspoonful of powdered sage rubbed into it. Form the dough into small rolls about four inches long, and bake these until quite brown. Sterilized Cheese.—Into one quart of boiling milk stir the juice of two or three lemons, according to size and taste ; strain the whole through a very fine hair sieve and put the curds into a very finely perforated enamelled mould, or a cheese cloth ; press it well for twelve hours, or longer, that it may be well drained ; it is then ready to serve, or be worked into other dishes.

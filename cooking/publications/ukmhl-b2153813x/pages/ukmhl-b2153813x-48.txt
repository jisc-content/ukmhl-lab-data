No man would be so indifferent to the care even of his watch as he is careless of his body—until nature calls a halt. The use of baking powders and salt retards the free flow of the digestive fluids, and must be a very common cause of ulcerated stomachs, and other digestive troubles. Now, considering the important value of bread to human life and its use, should not the production of health-giving bread be an imperative to individuals, and the community ? Our Municipal bodies have made the provision of a plentiful supply of pure water an imperative duty; and owing to the awfully high rate of infantile mortality, are now making strenuous efforts towards the cleansing and municipalisation of our milk supply; and why should any effort and expense b© spared in the direction of a municipal and health-giving bread supply ? The necessaries of life should be produced for health, and not for profit. A movement in this direction has taken firm hold of the administrative bodies of several Contin- ental cities. Municipalise the means of bread production and you can not only greatly raise the standard of its purity and economise in the work of its production and distribution but, you will enormously add to the health- fulness, usefulness, and longevity of the community— if the bread, cakes and biscuits, are produced on the conservative lines herein advocated.

Unfermented Bread (2)*—Beat with an egg-beater, one half-pint of cold boiled, or distilled water until it bubbles, then quickly fold into it, with a wooden spoon, sixteen ounces of whole- meal flour, divide^and form the dough into small rolls and brush these with beaten egg; and bake them, in a quick oven for thirty minutes. Milk Rolls.—Have one half-pint of clean milk at the boiling point and stir into it ten ounces of wholemeal flour then turn it out upon a floured paste-board and divide it into small rolls, twist these, and brush over with beaten egg, then bake them in a moderate oven for fifty minutes. Short Bread.—Have one pound of wholemeal flour, rub into it six ounces of pure butter, then wet it with sufficient cold boiled water to make a moderately stiff dough; knead it well, then cut and shape it into small rolls, or buns, about an inch in thickness and bake them in a moderate oven for one hour. Egg Raised Loaves (1).—Put a fresh egg, a teaspoonful of nut-butter, and a large breakfastcupful of cold boiled water into a strong china bowl, thoroughly beat the mixture into a nice cream and then add only sufficient wholemeal flour to make a batter, mix the batter well with a wooden spoon and put it into a well-buttered tin, bake it in a hot oven for an hour, then turn it out of the tin and put it into cooler part of the oven.

POISSONS. 130 No. 312. Haddock a la Walter Scott. Put two tablespoonfuls of chopped onions, one ditto of Harvey sauce, one ditto of catsup, one ditto of sherry, and twenty ditto of melted butter into a middling-sized stew- pan, place it over the fire and let it boil fifteen minutes, keeping it stirred, then have ready a good sized haddock, cut it in four pieces, put it into the stewpan with the sauce, place it over a slow fire for twenty minutes, or longer if necessary, when done, dress it on a dish without a napkin; reduce the sauce a little more if required, then add a little sugar and essence of anchovy, pom it over the fish and serve. No. 313. Fillets of Haddock a la St. Paid. Pillet your fish the same as a whiting, dip the fillets in flour, egg, and bread-crumb, and fry in hot lard, or oil, in a saute-pan, dress them on a napkin, garnish with fried watei- cress, and serve with two ounces of anchovy butter melted, but not boiled, in a boat. No. 314. Fillets of Haddock d la Hollandaise. Pillet your fish as above, and proceed as for fillets of whiting a la Hollandaise (see No. 300). No. 315. Gurnet and Pijpers. Though this fish is not much appreciated, I must say it is deserving of more repute than it possesses hi the opinion ' of epicures, for when fresh and well dressed it deserves to rank as one of the first of the second-class fishes ; to diess it plain it is put in boiling water, and simmered twenty or thirty minutes or more, according to the size; dress it on a napkin, garnish with parsley, and serve anchovy sauce in a boat.

VEGETABLES. 459 No. 1074. Artichaux a la Pruxellaise. Dress a border of artichokes as in the last, upon a border of mashed potatoes, and have ready a quart of very nice Brussel sprouts dressed a la maitre d’hotel (No. 1083), which dress in pyramid in the centre. This dish can only be seived in the autumn season of the year, as it is only then both vegetables can be obtained. No. 1075. Peas. The best of all green vegetables, and the delight of mil- lions, whilst then’ profusion renders them attainable by all; Hke the asparagus, they belong to that season of flavour] the spring of the year, but remain in season till a much later period; when young the English method of cooking them is good, because the more succulence there is in a vegetable the less zest they require to make them palatable. To describe the different sorts would be almost an endless, and to a certain extent a useless task, but the Prussian blues are, in my opinion, the very best; to plain bod them have two quarts of fresh-shelled peas, with a sprig of young mint, about ten leaves (the greatest fault with most people is putting too much), have a gallon of water boding upon the hre, m which you have put two ounces of salt, when bod- mg put m your peas, let them boil as fast as possible from ten to fifteen minutes, try whether they are tender if so strain them through a cullender, dress them upon vour dish with two pats of butter upon the top and serve- or when drained put them into a slewpan with a ouartef of a pound of fresh butter, half a teaspoonful of saltVd a good teaspoonful of powdered sugar, place over a foe' and keep tossing them until the butter is melted, dress them either plain upon your dish or in „ bread croustade

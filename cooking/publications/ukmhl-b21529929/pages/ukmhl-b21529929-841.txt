27 “ Reform Club, Sept. 23.” SOYER’S MODEL KITCHEN. From the Times, Sept. 28, 1347. “ To the Editor of the Times. "Sin, The great interest you manifested in February last, when I made known my intention ot erecting by subscription a model kitchen for the poor, was handsomely responded to by the public, and the scheme being considered by Government likely to be (at that dis- tressing period) ol immense advantage for Ireland, I was requested to lay my plans before the Lords of the Treasury, and being approved of, I willingly accepted the invitation of erecting my model kitchen in Dublin, instead of London, as I at first intended. “ Having successfully proved that the system was of paramount importance, both as regards the large quantity of superior food that could be produced, and the immense saving that could be effected, the Government then purchased my model kitchen, and the South Union Kehef Committee of Dublin have had the use of it ever since the 24th of April. “ As I am certain, Sir, that my subscribers and the public will feel interested in the result of my plan, the following brief statement will, I hope, awaken all local boards (if at all anxious), and adopt a system which must save, on a very moderate calculation, at least 50 per-cent, at any period of either scarcity or plenty. “ I leaye to those who are better acquainted than I am with statistics what would be the amount saved to the ratepayers all through the country. “ From the opening of my model kitchen by me, on the 6th of April last, to the 24th, the number of rations of 2£ lb. each was - - 40,000 “ from the 26th of April to the 22d of May, by the South Union Relief Committee, the number of rations, averaging 12,500 per day, was - 300,000 ‘From the 24th of May to the 31st of July, also by the South Union Relief Committee, the number of rations per day varying from 1,750 to 23,640, was . . ... . 729,279 “ From the 2d of August to the 14th, averaging 6,500 a-day, was - 78,000 “ Making 2,868,179 lb. of food, and of rations .... 1,147,279 “ To supply that ^number of rations by the old plan of preparing food in different depots, would have cost, at 3d. per ration (which is rather under the average), the sum of - " But, accordingito my plan of preparing food with my model kitchen, as it was estimated in a report made to the Relief Committee by its Secretary, on the 23d of April last, the cost of each ration, including coals, expenses of house, carriage, labour, <fcc. came to 1(W., making altogether, for 2,863,197 lb. of solid food, a sum of - . £15,538 7,768 “ -Effecting a saving in favour of the South Union Committee of 50 per cent., or a sum of - . . . _ £7,768 In support of the above statement, I beg to observe that the ratepayers of the North Lmon of Dublin have paid 3s. id. in the pound, whilst those of the South Union only paid result, Sir, speaks volumes in favour of my system. In addition to the model kitchen, Messrs. Brown & Co., of Great Suffolk Street, Borough, have erected one of their patent steam-plate ovens, which can bake on an average 1,000 loaves of 4 lb. each everv U hours whh three bushels of coke. The 1,000 loaves require 11 sacks of flour, conse- quently, 22 sacks can be worked in 24 hours, 132 sucks per week, at about lrf. per sack for fuel. What with the savings in baking, and also the new process of making bread, I have introduced, I calculate that full 25 per cent, can be saved on the cost of bread at all times. I beretore, admitting that the model kitchen, the new oven, and the new bread could only save 35 or 40 per cent, to the ratepayers, the system cannot be otherwise than particu- larly interesting to the whole community. 1 “ I am, Sir, yours most respectfully, “A. SOYER.

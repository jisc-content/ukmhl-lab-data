POISSONS. 94 Perch Are very difficult to scrape; they must be done almost alive: form the fish like an S, and scrape it with an oyster- knife; open the belly and take out the inside; pull out the gills, and wash well; when large, they are often boiled with the scales on, and they are taken off afterwards, which is much easier; but it depends upon how they are to be cooked. Pels. Kill them by knocking their heads upon a block or any- thing hard; then take the head in your hand with a cloth, aud just cut through the skin round the neck, and turn it down about an inch; then pull the head with one hand and the skin with the other, it will come off with facility; open the belly and take out the inside; cut off the fins and those bristles that run up the back; if the eel is large and oily, hold it over a charcoal fire, moving it quickly all the while; but the small ones will not require it. Nothing is harder to kill than eels; and it is only by killing, or rather stunning them in the manner above described that they suffer the least. Lampreys Are cleaned in the same manner as eels, but do not re- quire skinning.

ENTREMETS. 535 No. 1271. Charlotte de Famines a la Confiture. Proceed as in the last, but when the apples are ready mix a few spoonfuls of apricot marmalade with them and fill the mould ; place it in the oven, and serve as before. No. 1272. Chartreuse de Pommes. Procure twenty small russet apples, cut off the top and bottom of each, and with a long vegetable cutter cut out as many pieces as possible of the thickness of a quill, and about an inch in length, have in a stewpan upon the fire a thick syrup made from half a pound of sugar, with the juice of a lemon and half a pint of water; when well reduced throw in half your pieces of apples, stew them until tender, but not to break, take them out and lay them upon a hair sieve, put the other half of the apples into the syrup, stew them until nearly done, then add a little essence of cochineal to give them a crimson colour, stew a minute or so more, then take them out, lay them on the sieve till cold, lightly oil a plain round mould, cut some pieces of green angelica, with which form a star at the bottom of the mould, and a border round the bottom, then with the white pieces of apples make a row round the sides, standing each piece upon one end slantingly, one leaning upon the other, above which place a row of the red pieces m the same manner, and so on alternately till you reach the top ; you have previously peeled a dozen and a half of apples, which cut in slices and put in a preserving-pan, with half a pound of sugar, the juice of a lemon, aÂ°small piece of butter, a little powdered cinnamon, and a small glass of rum, place them over a sharp fire, stirring occa- sionally until forming a thick marmalade, put them in a basm until cold, fill your chartreuse, and when ready to serve turn it out upon your dish, garnish with fillets

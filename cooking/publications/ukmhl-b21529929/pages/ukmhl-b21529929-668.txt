THE KITCHEN DEPARTMENT OF THE REFORM CLUB ‘ This is a curious print, and unique of its kind: it presents on a large scale a coup-d’ceil of the matchless culinary arrangements of the Reform Club, the various offices for which extend over the whole basement of the building. To show them at one glance, the partition-walls are cut away, and a bird’s-eye view is given of the several kitchens, larders, sculleries, and batterie de cuisine: the different functionaries are all at their j osts, and the accomplished chef, Monsieur Soyer, is in the act of pointing out to a favoured visitor the various contrivances suggested by his ingenuity and experience. “ With a plan of the building, there are references to a minute explanatory account of the uses of the multifarious apparatus here exhibited, for the admiration of the scientific gastronome and the envy of rival artistes.” Spectator.

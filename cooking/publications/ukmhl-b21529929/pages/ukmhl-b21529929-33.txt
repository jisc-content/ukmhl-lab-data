LAUDING. IXV DIRECTIONS FOR LARDING. My motive for introducing tlie directions for larding at the com- mencement of this work, is to give it the importance which it deserves, it having in all former works been generally omitted, or lost amongst a multitude of receipts, which has made me desirous of placing it in a conspicuous place, in the hope that many families in the middle classes of society may be able to partake of that very inexpensive luxury. Nothing but experience and practice would enable a person to lard o A X vuuwjiv w pv_ l OVJ11 LV_/ 1(11 well, I have, therefore, given the few following directions, so that person might improve himself after once commencing. I have been induced to do so from the fact of having had many female cooks with me for improvement, many of whom could send up very good dinners, but few of them have scarcely known, or had any idea of larding, being in the habit of having it done by their poulterer whilst in London, and in the country avoiding it entirely: I shall, therefore, endeavour to explain, first, the choice of the bacon ; secondly, the manner of cutting it; and lastly, the best mode of larding. Choose the firmest bacon you can obtain, quite fat, and not at all red, or it would break and cause a deal of trouble. To cut it, take olf the piece of lean at the bottom, lay it upon a board with ’the rind upwards, and beat gently with a cutlet-bat, trim the sides, and cut it into bands the breadth that you may require your lardons in length ; if for a fillet of beef, two inches; for fricandeau, turkey, poularde’ fowl, pheasant, or sweetbread, an inch and a half; and for lamb’s sweatbreads much smaller. Take one of the bands, place it before you with the rind downwards, and with a sharp knife cut it in slices (but not separating it from the rind), of the thickness you require for the article you are about to lard, then place your hand at the top press lightly, and draw your knife straight along as if cutting the bacon in slices, so as to form the lardons square at each end *com- mencmg cuttnig from the heel of the knife, and finishing at the’point. Io lard, the French method is so familiar to me that I cannot but recommend it, especially to inexperienced hands. If a fricandeau lay it lengthwise upon a clean napkin across your hand, forming a kind of ndge with your thumb at the part you are about to commence at aTift'T 7 the, sI™ from ae veal with » £j£ lines ™ ‘| !,fPOmf f J0Ur 1”‘lll>e-MeclIe make three distiuci apart, run your needle into the third line (at the further side of the fricandeau), and bring it out at the first placing one of the lardons in it, draw the needle&through, LavL oiR toThe end of ^be °f ^ ^ °t'the bafon at eadl Iine : proceed&tlms o the end of the row; then make another line half an inch distant league thelndsTtJ tllem 0Ut at the second n aving the ends of the bacon out all of the same length; make the the lardonTo^thefi16^1116 dlStanC®? bri.nginS the ends out between S the wboll f r°W’ Procecdlfg ™ manner until you have with ter^th W r^aC?i11, chXered rows : Proceed in a similar way lardons and hfthn arV16 dlfference bemS only ^ the size of the By following i T)C ° , P°Ul 7 °f game’ Previoosly scald the breasts, if not STESlt rl h„G ab0"e S!mPle Sections any cook may be able, if not to lirrl woii J ‘ r x\ie directions any cook may be i which would give’pmetiL1 um/n aid ^ en°?Sh f°r every"day use» require compcte“cc-to ,arj articl“ (

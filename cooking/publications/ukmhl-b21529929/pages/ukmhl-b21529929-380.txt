ENTREES. 323 spoon, add a little sugar and a pat of butter, mix well, and sauce over the cotelettes, which serve as hot as possible. No. 782. Cotelettes de Venaison aux olives. Proceed exactly as above, but just before pouring the sauce over add about twenty stoned olives, dress them in the centre, sauce over and serve; truffles or mushrooms may likewise be introduced. No. 783. Cotelettes de Venaison aujus de groseilles. Saute and dress your cotelettes as above, then put a pint of thin sauce poivrade (No. 32) in the saute-pan with a little consomme, reduce till thickish, skim a little, add a spoonful of currant jelly, sauce over and serve. No. 784. Hashed Venison. The remains of a haunch of venison when cold is much thought of as hash, under which humble name it makes its appearance amongst the most sumptuous dishes, and is a great favourite with epicures, but if no fat remains do not attempt to dress it; but a good haunch well-carved will supply sufficient fat to hash the remainder. Put a quart of good brown sauce (No. 1) in a stewpan with a pint of consomme (No. 134), a piece of glaze, and a good bunch of parsley, let reduce to a good demi-glace, skim, then have as much venison as you require cut in thin slices, the fat thicker than the lean, put it into the sauce, season with pepper and salt, put it over a sharp fire to get hot as quick as possible, but do not let it boil or it u ould get hard and become very greasy, serve as hot as possible, with red currant jelly separate, make only sufficient for one entree.

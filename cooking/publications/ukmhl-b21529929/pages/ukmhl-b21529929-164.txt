114 POISSONS. of chopped parsley, tlie juice of a lemon, and a little pepper and salt j pom* the sauce over the fish and serve. No. 257. Sole a Vltalienne. Boil a sole as usual, then have ready the following sauce: put two teaspoonfuls of chopped eschalots in a stewpan with a very little salad oil, fry them a few minutes, but keep them quite white, drain off the oil, and add two tablespoon- fids of white wine, ten ditto of white sauce (No. 7), four ditto of boiled milk, and let it simmer ten minutes at the corner of the fire, skim it well, then add a teaspoonful of chopped mushrooms, a little chopped parsley, the juice of half a lemon, and two tablespoonfids of cream; mix the whole well together, season it a little more if required and pom it over the fish. No. 258. Soles plain fried. Lard and oil together is much better to fry in than but- ter, for the milk that remains in the butter is sure to burn ; the only way to use butter is to clarify it, but that is "^eiy expensive, lard by itself being as good as anything, but be careful that it is clean and not burnt; cut off the fins of the sole and dip it in flour, then egg and bread-crumb it, but do not put it in the lard unless it is quite hot, which you may easdy ascertain by throwing a drop of water in it; if it is hot enough it will make a hissing noise; allow the sole ten minutes to fry, or less, according to the size, dish it upon a napkin, garnish with parsley, and serve shrimp sauce (No. 73) in a boat. Observe the above receipt, to fry all kinds of fish, as eels, smelts, whitings, flounders, perch, gudgeons, &c. Four pounds of lard would De sufficient, and would do for se^ eral occasions.

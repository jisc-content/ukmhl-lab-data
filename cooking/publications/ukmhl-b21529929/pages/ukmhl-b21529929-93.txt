Pick all the stalks off and wash the spinach very clean in several waters, have ready a large stewpan of boiling water, in which you have put a handful of salt, put in the spinach, and let it boil as quickly as possible about twenty minutes; when quite tender put it into a colander and press the water out until there is none remaining, then chop it very fine; put one pound of spinach into a stewpan with a quarter of a pound of butter, stir it with a wooden spoon over a mo- derate fire until the butter is melted; then add a little flour, eight tablespoonfuls of brown sauce (No. 1), half a tea- spoonful of salt, half ditto of sugar, a little white pepper, and very small quantity of grated nutmeg; a little glaze may be added; finish with two ounces of fresh butter. No. 107. Blanched Mushrooms.

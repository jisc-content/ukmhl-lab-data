445 SAVOURY DISITES. Pitliiviers the pies are made square, and crimped from top to bottom, but the shape has nothing to do with the quality, and I consider those made in moulds look the handsomest. Pates as above may be made of all small birds that are eatable. No. 1044. Salade de Ilomard a VIndienne. Prepare a border of hard-boiled eggs as directed for sa- lade de grouse (No. 103b), dress some nice fresh salad in the centre, then take the flesh from a very fine lobster, or two middling-sized ones, cut it in as large slices as possible, put it in a basin, and season with a little tarragon, and chervil, pepper, and salt; dress them in pyramid upon the salad, interspersing slx mild Indian pickles in slices, and serving with a good white sauce mayonnaise (No. 1364) over. No. 1045. Mayonnaise de Ilomard a la gelee. Prepare a border of half hard-boiled eggs and half crou- tons of strong aspic (No. 1360), cut the same height as the eggs, and triangular, dress some salad in the centre as in the last, and the lobster well seasoned upon the top, and sauce over with a sauce mayonnaise a la gelee (No. 1361). No. 1046. Miroton de Ilomard a la Cardinale. Cut the flesh of a large lobster into slices as large as pos- sible, and nearly an equal size; reduce a pint of white sauce (No. 7) (with which you have mixed two tablespoonfuls of tan-agon vinegar) to two thirds ; then dip half the pieces of lobster into it with a fork, and place them on a dish to cool, add two ounces of red lobster butter (No. 77) to the remainder of the sauce, stir it well in, and dip in the re- mainder of the pieces; when cold and set, dress them in crown upon salad, with a white mayonnaise in the centre.

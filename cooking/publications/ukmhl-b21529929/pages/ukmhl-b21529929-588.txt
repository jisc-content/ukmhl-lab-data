ENTREMETS. 536 of red currant jelly, and pour a little white syrup reserved from the apples over. No. 1273. Suedoise de Pommes. This very grotesque entremet was never a favorite of mine; any kind of ornaments, such as cascades, ruins, arches, &c., may be made from them, and ornamented with various fruits, but they look very heavy, and from the apples being so much boiled and reduced become very unpalatable, they being nothing more than apples boiled in syrup to a very firm marmalade; I shall not here enter into the various modes of dressing it, but substitute other entremets, which, if not so ornamental, are at any rate much more palatable. No. 1274. Pain de Pommes a la Busse. Put one pound and a half of lump sugar and a pint and a half of water into a round-bottomed copper preserving- pan, place it over a sharp fire and reduce it to au casse (No. 1379), have ready twenty-four good brown pippin apples peeled and cut into slices, which put into the sugar, keeping stirred until it becomes quite a thick marmalade, take off the fire and put it into a cylinder mould, previ- ously slightly oiled, shake it well down and let it remain until quite cold, when turn it out of the mould upon your dish; have a few spoonfuls of currant jelly in a stewpan, which melt over the fire, add two glasses of good old rum, and when partly cold pom over and serve with whipped cream in the centre, in which you have introduced a quar- ter of an ounce of candied orange-flowers. No. 1275. Croquettes de Pommes. Prepare some apples as in the above, (or the remains of one previously served,) when cold form it into the shape

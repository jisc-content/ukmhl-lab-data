MY KITCHEN AT HOME. Do not fancy, gentle reader, under this title to see a wonder of the age, as .egards grandeur and magnitude ; but for comfort and convenience you will find a correct miniature of the kitchen, the plan of which I have just de- scribed, the room being only large enough for one or two persons to work in instead of fourteen, and intended to supply parties of from eight to ten instead of a hundred and above ; whether of great or little importance, every- thing, more or less, has its share of merit when well contrived, and by the same rule, these two culinary departments, although upon a very different scale, possess the same advantages. In publishing my Plan of the Kitchen of the Reform Club, many persons could not conceive my motive for so doing, saying that no private family would ever be in want of so large a kitchen, and it would be madness to zo o such an expense, with which reason I fully concurred; but being aware at the same time that all my new plans and discoveries might be reduced to my scale, those just observations have induced me to make My Kitchen at Home as complete in its way as the other, and to be able to afford the facility ri any^man cook, if employed upon any extraordinary occasions, to dress a that of the Cottage.

606 SERVICE PAGODATIQUE. My new pagodatique dishes, which have been pronounced by persons of taste who have seen them (and more so by those who have partaken of their contents) to be most novel, useful, and elegant, a service of them forming quite a new coup d oeil, and giving the greatest variation to small recherche dinners. Having invented them only last year, and having then this work in progress, caused me to refrain from giving them any great publicity previous to this publication; and the only service ever used was by me at the Reform Club, where they met with complete success. A minute description of the origin, utility, and construction will be found at the end of this work, with correct engravings, representing it both with and without the cover; so I shall here content myself by giving a bill of fare of a dinner served in them, to grace the table of the wealthy, as represented in the following engraving. They being entirely devoted for entrees, four of them make a service, and in very large dinners may be always introduced as corner dishes. In the following bill of fare I have given two entrees, containing four sauces each, and the others with only two, being the manner in which I have frequently served them, each brown entree must be lightly glazed, dressed elegantly in the centre, not covering too large a space, and just sufficient clear gravy to cover the bottom of your dish, whilst the white entrees would require a little thin white sauce; some entrees, again, which require to be dipped in white or brown sauce would have sufficient rim from them to cover the bottom of the dish.

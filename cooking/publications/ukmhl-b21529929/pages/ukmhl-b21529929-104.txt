But by placing the stew- pan over a slow fire when the stock is drawn down to a glaze, and allowing it to remain a short time, the glaze will become brownish, (but be careful not to let it burn,) when fill it up and your consomme will be sufficiently coloured. But should it require clarifying, put it into a stewpan and when boiling have the whites of eight eggs with then shells in another stewpan, wdiisk them half a minute, then add a quart of cold stock, whisk all well together, then whisk the boiling consomme and pour in the whites of eggs; still con- tinue whisking it over a clear fire until it simmers and the eggs separate from the consomme, which will be then quite clear; then pass it through a thin but very fine cloth into a basin and it is ready for use. This is anew mode of claii- fving and cannot fail. Tor the proportions for smaller quantities of consomme, to four pounds of veal put a quarter of a pound of ham, one ounce of butter, two onions, half a carrot, a turnip, half a leek, half a head of celery, a sprig of parsley, one of thyme, a bay-leaf, three cloves, six peppercorns, an ounce and a half of salt and four quarts of water; it will require an hour and three quarters boiling.

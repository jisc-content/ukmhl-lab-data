KITCHEN AT HOME. 639 No. 1. Sirloin of Beef. The royal honour which this bold and hand- some dish received from the merry monarch, who conferred upon it the honour of knighthood, good Sir Loin, which title it has ever since retained (previously only bearing the cognomen of loin), and most likely will retain until the latest period : as a joint it claims precedence of all others. In roasting, the fillet and fat below keep the upper part moist, and when well roasted, such is the quantity of gravy, that after a few slices have been cut it may be taken from it with a spoon. Procure a line square piece of sirloin weighing about twenty pounds (which has been hung at least three weeks in winter, and eight or ten days, if possi- ble, in summer, observing that the older the meat is the longer it will require keeping before cooking, and this remark applies to all kinds of meat, especially to beef and mutton), trim nicely, leaving the fat about an inch and a half in thickness over the fillet, cut a slice slantwise from the flap, which turn under, fixing it with skewers, thus giving the joint an oblong shape ; with a sharp knife cut through the sinew (running along the chine-bones) in four or five places, or the meat would contract in roasting ; make an incision in the centre of the chine-bones, lengthwise, with a chopper, through which pass a spit an inch wide and half an inch in thickness, bringing it out at the flap, keeping the centre, and avoiding the fillet. When the joint is larger it would be advisable to use a cradle-spit, which, however like the other spit, has its inconveniences, one making a hole through the meat, and the other pressing upon the fat, making it heavy ; but in any kind of joint, if not over-roasted” you will never perceive the mark of the spit, as the cavity closes immediately upon the spit leaving it; always choose a spit corresponding to the size of the joint. In a large kitchen, where you require many joints roasting at one time, a cradle-spit is a nuisance, and must be used only where it cannot be avoided. Tie half a sheet of buttered foolscap paper upon each side of the beef, and place to roast, keeping it two feet from a very clear fire, let remain twenty minutes, then rub the top over with a piece of butter placed in the bowl of a large wooden spoon (see page 396), and place the beef back to the distance of three or four feet from the fire, allowing it two houi’s and a half to three hours to roast; take it from your spit, let remain a few minutes upon a dish until no more fat runs from it, when place it upon the dish you intend serving it on (previously taking out the piece of rump-bone affixed to the side to facilitate the carving ; but in choosing a piece of sirloin obtain it if possible without any of that bone attached, or, at any rate, with but a very small piece, as the joint looks so much handsomer without it), pouring half a pint of good gravy (page 394) under; you will then perceive my object in not basting meat, the fat and the skin will be of a very light gold colour winch would have been quite the contrary if continually basted. By placing the meat too near the fire the fat quickly melts and falls into the dripping- pan, whilst by keeping it a tolerable distance it cooks gradually, and as the meat revolves runs over its surface, keeping it continually moist • aild» aSain> by placing it too near the fire it is liable to catch, causing ' many persons to think that it has not been well basted; another evil in basting is, that by continually pouring hot fat over you cause that beautiful Jg it tat attached to the joint to become heavy, and the gravy which invariably alls from the joint with the fat remains upon it, burns, and causes it to be ery indigestible. It will also be easy to perceive in the habit of pouring a quantity of hot fat over all joints, that if three or four should be^-oasthm S?i-0fneTrthe °?er’ that °ne deScriPtion of meat becomes basted with the fat and gravy of several, whilst the mere rubbing of a piece of butter

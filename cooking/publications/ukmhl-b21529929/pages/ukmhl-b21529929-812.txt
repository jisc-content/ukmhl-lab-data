18 SOYER/S SAUCE. DIRECTIONS FOR USE. For any kind of Cold Meat, Game, and Poultry.—Use it in moderation, as it is. For Mutton, Lamb, Pork, and Steaks.—When properly broiled and seasoned, pour one tablespoonful or more, according to the quantity of meat, which you turn over in the dish with a fork several times, then you will have a most exquisite gravy. Plain way for Hot Made-dishes.—In any sort of Hash it is a very great improvement.—For Made-dishes or Entr4es, put four tablespoon- fuls of Brown Sauce, six of Broth, and, when quite hot, add four table- spoonfuls of Soyer’s Sauce ; just boil it, and pour over your Entrees. For General Purposes.—Put eight tablespoonfuls of water into a stew- pan ; when boiling, add four ditto of the Sauce, half an ounce of fresh butter, mixed with a quarter of an ounce of flour; stir quick on the fire; add, if required, a little salt; boil one minute, and pour over your dish of meat, game, or poultry.

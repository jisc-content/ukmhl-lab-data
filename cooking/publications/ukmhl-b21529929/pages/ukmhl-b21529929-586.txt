534 ENTREMETS. No. 1270. Charlotte de Volumes au Beurre. For the few following receipts, the russet apple is the one I should recommend, it being the most suitable, not being so watery, or falling in' puree, but in case they cannot be obtained other sorts may be used, which will require to be more reduced in stewing. Well butter the interior of a plain round mould, then cut twelve pieces of bread the size and thickness of a shilling, dip them in clarified butter, and lay them in a circle round the bottom of your mould; cut also eight small pieces in the shape of diamonds, dip them in butter, and with them form a star in the centre of the circle, cover the whole with a round piece of bread the size of the bottom of the mould and the thickness of a penny-piece, cut about thirty other pieces an inch wide and four inches in length, dip one after the other in clarified butter, which stand upright, one half way over the other, all round the interior of the mould ; then have ready prepared two dozen or more russet apples, which peel and cut in slices, put them into a round- bottomed preserving-pan with six ounces of butter and half a pound of broken lump sugar, with a little lemon-peel cut in strips, and a glass of sherry, place them over a sharp fire, tossing over occasionally, but keeping them togethei in a cake; when quite tender fill your mould (having previ- ously well egged and bread-crumbed the interior), place another round piece of bread (also egged and bread-crumbed) over the apples, and stand the mould in a hot oven until the bread becomes well browned, take out and turn it o\er upon your dish, have a few spoonfuls of red ciuiant je y in a stewpan, with a glass of sherry, melt it over the fire, and when quite hot pour round the charlotte; sugai an salamander the top if not quite crisp, and serve.

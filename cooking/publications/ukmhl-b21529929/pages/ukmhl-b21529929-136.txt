PO'L’AGES. 86 boil five minutes, to sufficiently scald it, then put the pieces into a tub of cold water, and with a pointed knife take off all the scales, which throw away, then take out carefully the whole of the green fat, which reserve, place the remainder back in the turbot kettle, where let it simmer until the meat comes easily from the shells and the fins are tender, then take them out and detach all the glutinous meat from the shells, which cut into square pieces and reserve until re- quired. Fricandeau and a few other entrees were sometimes made from the fleshy parts, but the stringy substance of that mock meat is not worth eating, and few stomachs can digest it. * . . , The Stock.—For a turtle of the above size (which is con- sidered the best, for in comparison with them the smaller ones possess but little green fat,) cut up sixty pounds ot knuckles of veal, and twenty pounds of beef, with six pounds of lean ham ; well butter the bottom of three large stewpans, and put an equal proportion of meat in each, with four onions, one carrot, twenty peppercorns, ten cloves, two blades of mace, an ounce of salt, and a pint of water; place them upon sharp fires, stirring them round occasionally until the bottom of each is covered with a brownish glaze, when fill them up with the water in which you blanched the turtle, taking more water if not sufficient; when boding place them at the corners of the fires, let them simmer two horns, keep- ing them always well skimmed; then pass the stock through a fine cloth into basins to cool. The stock after being drawn down in the three separate stewpans, may be turned into a large stock pot, but my reason for doing itm smaller quantities is, that it requires less ebullition, and conse- quently the aroma of the different ingredients is better pre- served ; after having passed the stock, fill them up again with water, let them simmer four hours, when pass it an convert it into glaze as directed (No 132).

ENTREMETS. 533 mosaic, set the mould upon ice, and pour in a little clear jelly, but only sufficient to just cover them) when set line the side of the mould with the biscuits, and fill as for charlotte russe, only introducing angelica and stewed apples, cut in large dice, with the cream. No. 1267. Charlotte Russe aux Liqueurs. Line a mould as directed in either of the three last ar- ticles, and fill with a cream made as for the creme au maresquin (No. 1251), only using one glass of curagoa, one of noyeau, and oneofmaresquino, instead of all maresouino. Line a plain round mould with ripe strawberries by buijdng the mould in ice to the rim, and dipping the straw- berries in calf s-foot jelly, first covering the bottom with them cut in halves, the cut side downwards, afterwards building them up the sides, the jelly (which must be cold, but not set) causing them to adhere; when finished, fill it with the cream as directed for the charlotte russe, and when ready to serve, dip the mould in warm water, and turn it out upon your dish. The cream must be very nearly set when you pour it in, or it would run between the stiawberries and produce a bad effect. No. 1269. Gateaux aux Fruits de belle saison. Line a charlotte mould very tastefully with various lands of fruits (such as stoned cherries, strawberries, pieces of peaches, apricots, apples, or pears, cut into very tasteful shapes, stewed in a little syrup, and drained upon the back of a hair sieve), by dipping them into jelly, forming some design at the bottom of the mould, and building them in reverse rows up the sides, having the mould previously P aced in ice, when well set, terminate as in the last. No. 1268. Charlotte aux Fraises.

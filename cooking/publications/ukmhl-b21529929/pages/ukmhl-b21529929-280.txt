230 FLANCS. Plan os are required in eveiy dinner where there are more than four entrees; they are served upon oval dishes of from eighteen inches in length to nine in width, and require a little depth; for flancs being made dishes, like removes, the dish must contain the sauce. My readers will perceive by the Index that many of them are like the removes; but these I shall merely give references to, my object in placing them with the flancs being to show that by being reduced in size they will do for flancs in large dinners, and also be an assistance in the making of bills of fare. Planes are to be made of one or two sohd pieces of poultry, game, butcherâ€™s meat, or pastry, and keep every- thino- which is divided into many pieces, as cotelettes, fillets, escalopes, fricassees, salmis, &c., for entrees as much as much as possible, by doing which you will add more im- portance to your dinner, and cause more harmony m the arrangement.

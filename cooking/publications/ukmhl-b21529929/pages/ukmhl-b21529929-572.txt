520 ENTREMETS. No. 1230. Bordure de Boires en gelee. Cut twelve middling-sized ripe pears in halves, take out the cores peel neatly, and throw them into a preserving- pan, with the juice of two lemons and half a pound of lump sugar, let stew rather quickly till tender, but not to break, put them upon a dish till cold, have a cylinder mould (but not too deep) upon the ice, have a quart of jelly flavoured with four glasses of any liquor, put a little at the bottom of the mould half an inch in depth when set, dress your pears round in a border, (but the reverse way, so that they become right when the mould is turned over,) fill the mould up with the jelly when quite cold and upon the point of setting, and when wanted turn it out as before, and fill up the centre with red whipped jelly. Apricots or peaches cut in halves may be dressed the same, or apples. No. 1231. Gelee au Blmm. Have a quart of jelly clarified as before, to which add four wineglasses of old Jamaica rum, colour a little with some essence of cochineal, pom it into your mould without any fruit. This is better appreciated by a party of gentlemen, and should not be introduced where there are ladies; by keeping the jelly a little stiller you may introduce more nun. No. 1232. Gelee Mousseuse a VEau de Vie. Put a pint and a half of jelly in a stewpan upon the ice, add four glasses of cognac brandy, whip it until very light* and upon the point of setting, when pour in your mould, it will be quite white ; when ready to serve turn it out as before directed. If wanted clear', proceed as lor gelee au rhum.

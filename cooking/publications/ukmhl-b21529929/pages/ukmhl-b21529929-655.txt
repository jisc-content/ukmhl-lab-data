APPENDIX. 603 No. 1396. Apple Jelly. Cut six dozen of sound rennet apples in quarters, take out all the pips, put them into a sugar-pan, just cover them with cold water, and place over the fire, let boil until the apples become quite pulpy, when drain them upon a sieve, catching the liquor in a basin, which afterwards pass through a new and very clean jelly-bag ; to every pint of liquor have one poimd of sugar, which boil to the sixth degree as di- rected (No. 1379), when, whilst hot, mix in the liquor from the apple with a very clean skimmer, to prevent it boding over keep it skimmed, lift the skimmer occasionally from the pan, and when the jelly falls from it in thin sheets, take it up and fill the pots as before; the smaller pots are the best adapted for jellies. No. 1397. Quince Jelly. Proceed exactly as directed in the last, but using quinces instead of apples. No. 1398. Currant and Raspberry Jelly. Put half a sieve of fine red currants in a large stewpan with a gallon of white currants and a gallon of raspberries, add a quart of water, place over the fire, keep stirring, to prevent them sticking to the bottom, and let bod about ten minutes, pom them into a sieve to drain, catching the juice in a basin and draining the currants quite dry, pass the juice whdst hot through a clean jedy-bag, have a pound of sugar to every pint of juice, and proceed precisely as directed for apple jedy. Should you have time to pick the currants from the stalks previous to boding, you would lose that bitter flavour, and have less difficulty in making your jelly clear.

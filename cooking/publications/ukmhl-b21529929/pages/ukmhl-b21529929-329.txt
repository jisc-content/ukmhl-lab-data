ENTREES. 279 pieces, put two tablespoonfuls of salad-oil in a deep saute- pan, with four of chopped onions, stir with a wooden spoon five minutes over a sharp fire, then pour off as much of the oil as possible, add a quart of white sauce (No. 7), a table- spoonful of chopped parsley, and one of chopped mush- rooms, with six of white stock, boil altogether five minutes, keeping it stirred; add a little grated nutmeg, then put in your pieces of palates, boil a few minutes longer, and turn the whole on a dish to get cold • finish dressing, and serve as directed for aiguillettes de langue de boeuf (No. 643). No. 660. Turban de Tete de Veau en Tortue. Cook and prepare a calf’s head as directed in the Re- moves (No. 462); only for entrees you must cut much smaller pieces, and of course you require a much smaller quantity of sauce. I have merely repeated it here to show that it may be served as an entree; but great care must be taken in boiling the head, for if not done enough it is not eatable, and if done too much it would be impossible to dress them on your dish. Care must also be taken in dish- ing up to make it look graceful, and it cannot be served too hot. No. 661. Turban de Tete de Veau a la Maitre d’Hotel. . PiePare your calf’s head as in the last, and dress the pieces in crown upon mashed potatoes, have ready the fol- lowing sauce : put a pint of white sauce (No. 7) in a stew. pan, with eight spoonfuls of good white stock, boil ten mi- nutes, keeping it stirred, add two ounces of maitre d’hotel butter (No. 79), very highly seasoned, let it melt, but do not let the sauce boil after the butter is in, sauce over and serve immediately.

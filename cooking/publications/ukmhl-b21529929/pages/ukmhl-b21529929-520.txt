Procure twelve middling-sized mushrooms, scoop out part of the interior, make a good sauce aux fines herbes (No. 26) very thick, to which add the interior of the mush- rooms, and a few bread-crumbs; fill your mushrooms, egg and bread-crumb over, place them in a saute-pan in the oven twenty minutes, salamander a light colour and serve on a napkin. No. 1103. Croute aux champignons. Procure a very fresh pottle of white mushrooms, which peel and trim, pass a few chopped onions in a stewpan with a small piece of butter (do not let them get brown), add a pint of sauce bechamel (No. 7); when boiling put in the mushrooms (raw), let simmer half an liom, season with a little salt, pepper, and sugar, and finish with a liaison of two yolks of eggs mixed with half a gill of cream, move round over the fire till it thickens, dress them upon your dish in the crust of a French roll, scooped out and fried for that purpose, and sauce over.

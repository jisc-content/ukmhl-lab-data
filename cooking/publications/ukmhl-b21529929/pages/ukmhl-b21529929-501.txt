SAVOURY DISHES. 449 for the trout, first tying them up â€¢ stew one hour, and leave them in the marinade to cool; when quite cold drain them on a cloth; dress on your dish, fill the centre with Mont- peliere butter (No. 1306), garnish with a border of eggs, and sauce round with a very white Tartare sauce (No. 38), and sprinkle a little chopped gherkins over. No. 1055. Galantine d'Anguille. Piocure two fine eels, skin and bone them, have ready prepared some forcemeat of whiting (No. 124), lay the eel open before you and spread some of the forcemeat down the centre, upon which lay small fillets of truffle, pistachios, cooked tongue, and whiting, cover with more of the force- meat, and sew the eel up in its original shape, cut it into two equal parts and envelope each in thin slices of fat bacon, tie in a napkin and place them in a stewpan in wliich you have prepared a marinade as for the trout, but using half a pint of Madeira wine instead of vinegar, stew gently half an hour or until tender, and leave it to get cold in the stock, take out and remove them from the nap- kin, glaze and place them on your dish side by side upon a stand of Montpellier butter (No. 1366), and a little between them to hold them together; garnish round with craw-fish and croutons of aspic (No. 1360). Six rolls of them, each three mches high, may be dressed into what we term a bastion, that is standing them up on end in a circle, join- ing them together with Montpellier butter, and placing the alf of a hard-boiled egg cut across (to form a cap) upon ; efh> decorated with fillets of anchovies and very green gherkins.

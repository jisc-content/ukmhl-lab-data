KITCHEN OF 016 tom being inclined on each side towards the middle, which forms a channel, at the end of which there is a small drain to let the ice water escape without the assistance of hands, having at the back a pipe to receive the waste water running into other pipes outside. On the left going in there is another sideboard of the same material, eight feet and a half long and two feet wide, there are six drawers all of them lined with lead, and (which might be called simply ice-preservers, being almost free from air, and only now and then refreshed with ice at a trifling expense) from five to six inches thick, covered with a zinc plate to fit the drawer, and a cloth over it for chops, steaks, aspics, entrees, and a variety of things always kept fresh and tender; the woodcut below gives the exact form of the drawers as described above. It will be worth consideration to adopt the plan in all larders, as they certainly have the several advantages of preserving ice for a long time, and keeping in readiness any sort of prepared dishes, and even the flavour of fruit to perfection. At the end of this sideboard is a slate well, three feet six inches long, two feet wide, and one foot deep, supplied with hot and cold water; this well is used for soaking hams, tongues, and calf’s head ; adjoining is a slab for open- ing oysters, under which is a well to keep them in.

The first row is ten feet long, divided into eleven parts, namely, five of one foot one inch opening and eight inches deep, six inches high in front, and ten inches at the back, the other six are smaller; the lower divisions are for large vegetables, and consequently of greater dimen- sions, divided into seven boxes, five of which are one foot seven inches deep, nine inches high in front, and one foot five inches at the back, with one foot five inches opening, the other two are for potatoes. The whole appearance of the above boxes is agreeable, for you see at once all the various productions of the kitchen garden the most in seasou, and kept separate. There is something new in the plan which might easily be

A little ham or tongue (should you have any left) cut small, and mixed with the mince would be a great improvement. No. 185. Turban of Croquettes. Croquettes are made precisely as the last, but not more than half the size ; when done, dress them in crown upon a border of mashed potatoes, and have ready some of the blanquette of turkey, which serve in the centre. No. 186. Minced and Grilled Turkey. Detach the leg, wing, or take off the best part of the turkey remaining, which season well with pepper and salt, and broil over a good fire, have ready prepared a mince from the remain- ing flesh of the turkey, made as directed for the boudius, but omitting the yolks of eggs ; when quite hot and well seasoned pour into your dish, and dress the broiled piece upon it. No. 187. Devilled Turkey. Cut up the remains of your turkey into good- sized pieces or joints, if sufficient, cut incisions crosswise upon each piece, and well rub them with cayenne pepper, broil quickly over a sharp fire, dress them in your dish, and have ready the following sauce : put a tablespoonful of chopped eschalots in a stewpan with a wineglassful of Chili vinegar, reduce to half, add half a pint of thin melted butter, two tablespoonfuls of catsup, and two of Worcestershire sauce, boil about a quarter of an hour, stir in two ounces of fresh butter, pour over and serve. Many persons like the above best dry, so it would be as well to serve the sauce separate in a boat, or a little plain gravy only underneath. The remains of poulardes, capons, or fowls may be dressed precisely as directed for the turkey. No. 188. Goose Hashed.

For a variation, a little sage and a couple of apples sliced and cooked in the sauce is very good. No. 189. Stewed Buck and Peas.

iioiis-d’ceuvre. 160 lids, empty them with care, and you will save nearly all the butter from them, turn them topsy-turvey in a dry place until wanted; when ready to serve put them in the oven a short time to get hot, and fill with any of the preparations for petites bouchees. You may form the croustades in dia- monds, or any shape your fancy dictates; they make very beautiful hors-d’oeuvres, and very cheap, as with care you may save the butter, which when cold may be applied to any other purpose. No. 406. Croustade de Beurre a la Duke of York. Prepare the croustades as above, and make a good puree of fowl (as for petites bouchees a la puree de volaille. No. 392), then peel a good sized cucumber, cut it in pieces two inches long, and divide each piece into three lengthwise, take out the seeds, and stew the pieces of cucumber till very tender, with a little sugar, onion, and broth, keeping them very white \ when cold cut them in small dice, mix with the puree of fowl, fill the croustades, and sei\e 'veiy hot with a plover’s egg upon the top of each. No. 407. Croquettes de Homard.

Croquettes may be made

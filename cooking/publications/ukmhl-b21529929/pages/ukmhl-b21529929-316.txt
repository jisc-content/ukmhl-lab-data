266 ENTREES. Entrees require to be small and elegant, as well as tasty; those which can be dressed in a crown like cotelettes, que- nelles, or fillets of any description, are preferable, and more graceful, the garniture being placed in the centre; they are also more likely to be partaken of on account of the facility of serving, they being already carved, and much better than large pieces, such as whole fowls, vol-au-vents, or pates chauds; where you require flancs, by all means reserve them for that purpose; but in a dinner of four entrees only, you require to send two entrees light, and two (what I term) solid, for the sake of variety, for if you had four light entrees upon the table without flancs, there would not appear sufficient dinner for the assembled guests, but the solid entrees may be made to look exceedingly light if carried to a height corresponding to their breadth; in dishing your entrees always allow an inch between the entree and the rim of the dish, or if the dishes are lanre leave more space; the round entree dishes are the most preferable, and should not be more than an inch and a half, or less than an inch in depth. No. 6 3 5. Of Beef for Entrees. Of all kinds of butchersâ€™ meat, beef, though so useful in cooking, presents the least variation for entrees, the fillet being the only part that can be used to any advantage. No. 636. Escalopes de Filet de Bceuf a la Reform. Take out the fillet from beneath a rump of beef, take off all the fat, and cut it into slices (lengthwise) half an inch

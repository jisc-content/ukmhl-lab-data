I M P O R T A N T. DESCRIPTION OF TIIE COMPOSITION OF THIS WORK. To sustain and deserve the title of “Gastronomic Regenerator” nothing but an entire change from the system of any other publication on the art of Cookery would be admissible, it is now in the hands of mv readers to judge for themselves, and to stamp its character according to its merits either as an original or a copy; to avoid the last, howeve? I have closely studied to introduce the greatest novelty in every depwt- ment, and have entirely omitted all unnecessary confusion, which in many previous works, have rendered them unintelligible to the un- initiated and almost impracticable to the initiated; however, many old nhfipT I*1 rec,eipts’ t0° S°od t0 be omitted, will be found mucl/sim- plified to reduce them to a practical point. I have also minutely studied the disposing and arranging of the buildmg of all sized kitchens, from the one of the Reform Club and the Ku chen of the Wealthy to the humble one of the cottage, which cannot s sc oT^e'y ex™s usefid departments have not only previously Lenmuch “eglected ^ut m many instances at a very great evnpnsp 11 neglected, but of practical knowledge, anlAnsideKngthaf heZ tlf are an every-day enjoyment which reflects good id eJonV^‘‘el my readers I am sme will agree with ™p A JYi n,. classes> such an important department deserves some littlePuPT- dlSp°sm8 of uncomfortably prepared is almost always unsightly unwhT’ f°r ^ consequently indigestible, not being cleanly pfep^d f Ci"S,°,f “ they might have proved useful in 10lP pubheatmn ; although seldom feferred toP oiSt£te dinner by the difliculty of procuring pert t“e idenfT0"11™, n “ required m the receipts which the bills of f!™ p 'Cal comestibles would venture to sav thnt in ■ * <uc rePer to; and more I been correctly followed - the onl/i Lrl'''-lmvc tllose 01 JaI‘e arrange my one to other the LucuUucian dinner, and thfdinncr of be found 3 thcTld

SAVOURY DISHES. 444 rected (No. 59), into which dip the four roasted ones, and let them remain till nearly cold, then take them out and sprinkle all over with chopped ham and whites of hard- boiled eggs ; you have prepared a croustade in the form of a vase, which stand in the centre of your dish, cut the toast in four pieces, each the form of a diamond, dress the wood- cocks round the croustade upon each piece, dress hard- boiled eggs in a border upon the croustade, and garnish with aspic jelly, whipped (No. 1360), chopped, and quite white, in the interior, and in croutons round. Pates of woodcocks are excellent, they are made the same as for partridges, keeping their trails for the interior of the birds after they are boned. Plovers and snipes may be dressed precisely as directed for the woodcocks. No. 1043. Pate froid de Mauviettes Is also a very favourite dish for second course, and when well prepared stands high in the estimation of a gourmet; the following receipt is exactly as they are prepared at Pi- thiviers : pluck and bone six dozen of larks, take out the in- terior, extract the gizzard, and pound the intestines with two pounds of forcemeat (No. 123), place a little in each bird, roll them up, and envelope them in very thin slices of fat bacon ; you have lined a raised pie-mould with paste as for pate de veau (No. 999), which again line with the force- meat, place a layer of the larks at the bottom, then a layer of forcemeat, then larks again, till quite full, and finish with a quarter of a pound of maitre dâ€™hotel butter (No. 79), a thin slice of fat bacon, and three bay-leaves, cover with paste and bake in a moderate oven two hours and a half, place it by, and when half cold add a pint of good game sauce (No. 60), shake it well in; when quite cold take off the lid, and garnish with some fresh sprigs of parsley.

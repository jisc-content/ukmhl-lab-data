POISSONS. 14-3 No. 353. Fillets of Pilce a la Meuniere. Fillet four pike as above, cut each fillet in halves, rub some chopped eschalot into them, dip them in flour, broil them; when done, sauce as for Sole a la meuniere (No. 260). Observe, if you happen to live in the country where pike is plentiful, you may dish the fillets in as many ways as soles or any other fish; but I have omitted giving them here, thinking it useless to fill a useful book with so many repe- titions ; we have several ways of dressing pike to be eaten cold in France, which I have also omitted, as they would be quite useless in this country. No. 354. Carp en matelote. Have your fish ready cleaned, and make four or five in- cisions on each side; then put two sliced onions, three sprigs of thyme and parsley, and half a pint of port wine in a stewpan, or small fish-kettle; season the fish with pepper and salt, lay it in the stewpan, add four pints of broth, and place it on a slow fire to stew for an hour (which will be sufficient for a fish of five poimds weight), or more in pro- portion to the size; when done, dress it on a dish, without a napkin; drain it well, and serve a matelote sauce (No. 62) over it, only use some of the stock from the fish (having previously taken off all the fat) instead of plain broth as directed in that article. No. 355. Carp a la Genoise. Prepare your fish as above, and lay it in your- fish-kettle with two ounces of salt, half a bottle of port wine, two omons, two turnips, one leek, one carrot (cut in slices), three bay-leaves, six cloves, two blades of mace, and a spk of parsley, cover the fish with white broth; stew it as before 3 naPk“’ ” 3 a— ^

NEW MODE OF CARVING. XVII is not employed ; if a slice from a fillet of a sirloin is required, the servant must take the joint to the sideboard, and turn it over with a couple of forks ; when again placed upon the table, the carver must carefully part some of the fat which covers it, if too much, then cut short slices in a slanting direction, as if from the breast of a fowl, in- stead of crosswise, for then if clumsily carved and overdone it has a strong resemblance to an old strap. Foi a rump of beef, either roasted or stewed, always commence at the fattest end, carving in a slanting direction, by which means you will obtain a correct quantity of that delicate article, if even you should be carving for twenty people, whilst by cutting straight across, some would have the greater proportion fat and the remainder nothing but Jean. Any other piece of beef rolled and stewed, and fillets of beef as served for a remove all require to be carved in a slanting direction.’ °i ‘pir Vea1, Proceed in the same manner as directed for a round or beer. °/ ICa1' ^ CUnt ftraight at the commencement, is entirely spoiled but when carved slantingly (if well done from the best end) ,snfl1pen ltS °T SmVy’ n0thinS could be nicer, the remaining then also very good cold, even the kidney ought to be served the of*carvingd ^ r°aSted °r Stewed> re(lllire the same style For legs of mutton or lamb I also proceed in a new way • the frill ment th? aC6f ?P,°v ^ - not only intended toornt ment the leg but likewise to enable you to hold the bone with your left hand, and carving with the right, which would wonderfully feci beneath the X^deTaehi^ttem fronf d™ hT^' k"'‘? person quickly and mth ray hoTrnea? bone’thus he}P“« meat will keep it moistened in ,3* general manner you have nothin? but rlr * wl“lst m tlie purpose for cold the melt 1° , ! m.e,at’ or lf “uderdone on is my way of Sf V * ““1 aPPe”““- This with the fingers, mafi, use S clLIS‘““torn ^ *lle,fri11 any gravv to be nni irtfn +1 v i i ioik , at liome I never allow if thf nilt is of go d quXttnU “ a boat> dance of good |ravy l ' f0r ^pply ^ wen roasted) an abun- earving the leg nearerto the centrp6 g"f ^ °P the weal%, commence For shoulders ^mutton or kmh ?o a ^ingdirection, and lean must be weU nfixedTn sTil tn ^ ?? d*cate’ the fat must be carved in a still more slantin/di accoraPllsl1 which the joint ginning rather near to the knuckle.

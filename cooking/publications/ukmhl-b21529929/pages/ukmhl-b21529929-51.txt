1 THE GASTRONOMIC REGENERATOR. SAUCES. The first eight sauces are what we term Foundation sauces; but to facilitate and simplify the making of all kinds of made dishes, I have throughout this work princi- pally referred to the Brown Sauce (No. 1), and the White Sauce (No. 7), which are the two sauces I daily and prin- cipally use. The others are of course very good, and some- times necessary; but being more complicated, I would re- commend that they be left to culinary artists, who can easily surmount this difficulty. The two above-mentioned sauces require nothing but a little care and attention; if well made, you will have little trouble with the smaller sauces; for the foundation sauces being well made, the smaller ones require little more than the ingredients directed for them, to give them then- proper flavour; but if badly made, it would injure the whole dinner. The above-named sauces will keep four or five days in smnmer, and a week in winter by adding a quart of light broth, and boiling them up every day in smnmer, and every other day in winter. The following proportions in the foundation sauces are sufficient for a huge dinner; but of course where so much he madeeqUUed’ & qU8rter’ °r even 8 smaller TUillltiV cau

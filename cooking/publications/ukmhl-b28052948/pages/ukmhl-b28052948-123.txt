THE BKEAKFAST BOOK. 107 dish, and pour the fish inside. Kememher, smoked fish is inapplicable for this dish. FISH PASTE. Yarmouth hloaters, smoked salmon, shrimps, prawns, lobsters, anchovies, are suitable for paste. Take the flesh of the already dressed fish, carefully bone it, and divest it of skin, fins, etc.; season it plentifully with spices, and pound it in a mortar; add to it a small proportion of very fresh butter, and when quite a smooth paste press it doAvm well into pots, and cover them with a layer of clarified butter. Tie them securely from the air, if intended to keep for any length of time. FISH WITH PARMESAH CHEESE. If you happen to have a small quantity of cold fish at hand, bone it carefully; break it up with a spoon, season it with coarse pepper, and add to it a little grated Parmesan cheeseâ€”a dessert-spoonful to half a pound of fish will suffice. Mix it with enough white sauce to make it tolerably stiff, pile it up in a dish, smooth over the surface with yolks of egg, sift bread- crumbs on the top, and put sippets of toast round the edge. Bake it until it is thoroughly hot and looks nicely browned. The meat of any kind of white-fleshed fish eats deliciously done thus.

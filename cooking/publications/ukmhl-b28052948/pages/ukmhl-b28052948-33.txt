THE BREAKFAST BOOK. 17 PORK CUTLETS. In Spain, a pork cutlet and poached egg, with a squeeze of orange juice, constitute the breakfast of most of those who can afford to procure the luxury. The pork, which in its living state has been fattened upon sweet chestnuts, is cooked by being immersed in boiling olive oil, and rightly it merits its popularity. In England, pork chops or cutlets are usually not so esteemed : rubbed over with powdered sage, they are most commonly broiled, but as they need some time to cook, they are often found to be either smoky, burnt, undei done, or hard. They are better if boned, peppered, skewered round like little fillets, and tossed in butter. Serve garnished with barberries, and sauced with horseradish,-tomato or piquante sauce. Pickles and mustard apart. POTTED MEAT, GAME, OR FISH. A very small quantity of any kind of cold meat can be converted into a paste and potted, and in this way make a much more refined-looking dish than it otheiâ€™wise would. Slightly warm the outsides of the moulds, and turn it out to serve. Garnish with branches of hay or savoury herbs. Or, tolerably thin slices may be cut out and laid in a dish, with a deco- ration of green parsley; it may likewise be spread between thin bread-and-butter, or eaten with dry toast. c

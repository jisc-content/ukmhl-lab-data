THE BEEAKFAST BOOK. 127 OYSTER PATTIES. There seetas to be a conventional feeling in favour of oyster patties; so much so, that anything of a stylish breakfast or light repast can scarcely be con- sidered complete without them. Beard the oysters, and, if large, halve them; put them into a saucepan with a piece of butter rolled in flour, some finely- shred lemon rind, and a little white pepper, cream, and a portion of the liquor from the fish; stir all well together, let it simmer for a few minutes, and put it into your patty-pans, which jmu have already prepared with a puff-paste in the usual way. Serve hot or cold.

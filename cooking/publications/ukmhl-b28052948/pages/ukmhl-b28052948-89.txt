73 THE BKEAKFAÂ»T BOOK. GAME CAKE. Take an undressed hare, or any other kind of game, cut the flesh from the bones, add to it the same weight of fresh calfs liver, ham, and bacon fat. Pound all in a mortar, together with the liver of the game; season it with spices, salt, and a little shalot, and a glass of rum. Mix it with half-a-dozen fresh raw eggs, and if it is a hare add the blood. Line a mould with slices of bacon fat; put in alternate layers of game paste and sliced truffles; cover with more bacon fat; place some thick paper on the top, and bake it for three hours. Let it grow cold in the mould, and slightly warm it to turn it out. HAM CAKE. Take cold boiled ham, cut up eqiaal parts of the fat and lean; season well with spice; beat it to a paste in a mortar; add one-fourth of fresh butter, put it into a mould, and bake it for twenty minutes; let it become cold, and turn it out when wanted, first dipping the mould for a few moments into boil- ing water. A fresh egg or two may be added if ap- proved of. Tongue cake or cold beef cake is made in the same manner. If possible it should be glazed with jelly when seiwed.

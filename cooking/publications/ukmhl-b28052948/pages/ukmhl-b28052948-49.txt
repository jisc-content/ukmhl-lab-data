Serve with a garnish of poached eggs placed alter- nately—with small sippets of bread tossed in oil. With white meats fried oysters may take the place of the poached eggs. Hashed calfs head should have the brains made into small cakes fried for a garaish. With game, some chopped savoury herbs may be em- ployed. Hashed meat is sometimes sei'ved en crousiade, i. e. upon pieces of toast. • Cut some slices of bread, either heart-shaped or circular, remove some of the crumh from the middle, fry them in butter, lay some hash upon them, place a poached egg upon each, and serve as hot as possible.

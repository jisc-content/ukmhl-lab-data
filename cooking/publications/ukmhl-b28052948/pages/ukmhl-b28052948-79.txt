THE BEEAKFAST BOOK. 63 YORKSHIRE PIE, Bone a large goose, a turkey, and a couple of ducks, first splitting them open at the backs. Boil down an old hare with plenty of spices, until the bones fall freely from out of the flesh. Make it with other things into a rich forcemeat; add it to the birds, and place them inside a thick, raised crust; fill up at the sides with two or three braces of partridges or woodcocks, cover it perfectly close, and bake it four hours. "When done, pour in the hare grav}' and some fresh butter, just melted, fasten up the hole, and keep it for at least a week 'before cutting it. Of course this pie can be modified by using a duck, a fowl, and a partridge, instead of the first-mentioned birds, and filling up with hard eggs, flat sausages, ham balls, or small birds, etc. In all cases the breasts of the birds should be placed up- wards.

50 THE BEEAKFAST BOOK. BAM PIE. Take some small slices of cold boiled ham, pepper them well. Cut up a fine fowl; toss it in butter till it begins to brown. Line a dish with a good paste; lay in first some ham, then some fowl; fill up the spaces with the yolks of hard-boiled eggs ; add some mushroom powder, strew in some spices ; cover with a layer of ham, pour in some gravy, put on a top crust, and bake it for an hour and a half. Eemember, the ham should only be in the jiroportion of one-third the weight of the fowl, or the pie will taste too salt. Calvesâ€™ sweetbreads are very good, employed instead of the fowl. HARE PIE. Cut up a full-grown hare, make a forcemeat with the liver, season it pretty highly with grated lemon- peel and spices; but do not use herbs if you intend the pie to keep. Add half a 2iound of butter, and jug the hare in a close-stop]ped vessel for an hour. 'When cold, place all together in a crust, add a glass of jDort wine, and bake in a gentle oven for two hours. The meat of a leveret should be merely tossed in butter before being made into a pie, some strong beef gravy being added.

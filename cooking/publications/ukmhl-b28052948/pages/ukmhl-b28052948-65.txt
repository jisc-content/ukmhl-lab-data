For a green-goose ]oie, bone a couple of young geese, by first opening them down the backs; pepper them, and lay them one within the other; put them into a dish with a crust, and pour in a rich seasoned gravy, made from the bones and giblets; or make it into an oval-shaped raised pie, adding the gravy after the pie is baked. The livers of the geese may be made into a forcemeat with a few truffles, etc. A finer goose pie is made by boning a full-grown goose and a large capon; season both with spices; lay the capon inside the goose, and place upon the capon a small ox-tongue which has been boiled, skinned, and divested of the root end. Put the above in a thick raised crust, or in a terrine, garnished with some forcemeat, etc. Bake it tor two hours, and fill up with jelly before serving. A pigeon may be substi- tuted .for the tongue, and the capon may be larded, if convenient. E

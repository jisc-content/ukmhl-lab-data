Or do them in a stewpan, lined with thin slices of bacon fat; add a bruised bay leaf, salt, and pepper, and enough champagne to cover them. Serve them in a napkin; this manner is called en serviette.

They may likewise be put into petits pates ; or, with the addition of ham and bacon fat, they may be formed into a tourte.

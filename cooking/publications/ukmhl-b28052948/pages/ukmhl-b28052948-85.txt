THE BREAKFAST BOOK. 69 FRESH SAUSAGES, ETC. MUTTOK SAUSAGES. Beat together in a mortar a pound of the lean of tender raw mutton, half a pound of veal fat, three anchovies, four ounces of bread, two dozen fresh oysters, bearded, two boiled onions, two raw eggs, and plenty of seasoning. Moisten with the oyster liquor and a little lemon-juice. Put it into small skins, and prick them with a needle before frying them. PORK OR BEEF SAUSAGES. For ordinary sausages :—Three pounds of fat and two pounds of lean pork', well-seasoned and finely chopped; add half a pound of bread crumbs, soaked in milk. If intended to be made into flat sausages, mix with the beaten yolks of eggs. For Oxford sausages, add finely-shred hei’bs, according to taste. The above sausage-meat will keep well for a week or ten days, if properly seasoned. Excellent beef sausages are made by mincing equal parts of fat and lean of tender beef, with or without the addition of bacon fat. Season well with pepper, salt, and a small quantity of shred shalot and parsley. A good bit of bread, soaked in Rhine wine, makes the sausage lighter.

90 THE BKEAKPAST BOOK. POTTED BEEF. Cut two pounds of lean beef in slices, rub them with cochineal, salt, pepper, and put them together for four-and-twenty hours. Bake them with vinegar or ale, enough to cover them. Drain them, and when cold, beat them in a mortar; add a pound of fresh butter, and seasoning to taste. Put the paste into pots, place them in the oven until quite hot, with- draw them, and when cold cover the tops with clari- fied butter. POTTED BIRDS. Woodcocks, partridges, ortolans, grouse, pigeons, quails, and small birds, are potted in much the same manner. Pluck them very carefully, singe and draw them, wipe them quite dry inside, but do not wash them. Season them, put butter to them, and bake them. When done, drain them, and next day pack them in pots and pour clarified butter over them. The heads of moor-game should not be concealed under the butter. The pinions and feet should be removed from pigeons and partridges, and the beaks of woodcocks should be skewered through the thighs, one leg being first drawn through the other. The legs of grouse, larks, and small birds are to be arranged in like manner. The larger birds may be cut up so as to pack the closer, and save butter.

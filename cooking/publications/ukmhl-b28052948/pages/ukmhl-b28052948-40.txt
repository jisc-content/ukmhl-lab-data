24 THE BEEAKFAST BOOK. VEAL CUTLETS. Chops or cutlets of veal require a good deal of careful cooking. They may be broiled with a coating of herbs, etc., in paper cases, but are really preferable for the breakfast-table simply tossed. AVhen cut thin enough, they need not be beaten before they are dressed, for if the veal is quite fresh there is no fear of its not being tender. Garnish with sliced lemon and small pieces of toasted bacon. WITH MAEMALADEOR PRESERVED FRUITS OF DIFFERENT DESCRIPTIONS, AND NAUBONNE HONEY, ETC. The foregoing constitute the chief comestibles current with most classes for the breakfast-table. In the following chapter are given some made dishes which are expeditiously dressed, indeed the majority of them may be prepared under half an hour. Eagouts, stews, fricandeaux, and fricassees, are purposely omitted, their name being legion, and a * more considerable time being involved in their cooking than could be afforded by the generality of housekeepers.

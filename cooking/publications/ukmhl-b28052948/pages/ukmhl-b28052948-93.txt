THE BREAKFAST BOOK. 77 it out by placing a small slice of cold bam, tongne, sliced bard-boiled eggs, fillets of ancbovies, dried sausage, or anything calculated to improve tbe ap- pearance of tbe disb as well as add to its contents. Poultiy and game may be larded and braised instead of roasted, then decorated with jelly or glazed sippets. ROLLED MEAT. \Mienever necessity compels us to introduce butchersâ€™ meat cold at our breakfast table, we should prej)are it beforehand by having it boned, rolled, and glazed, as it is then a more agreeable object than when presented in the form of a joint. The pieces most fitted for the purpose are ribs of beef, fore-quar- ter of lamb, loin of veal, leg of Welsh mutton, neck of pork, shoulder and breast of veal, loin or shoulder of mutton. These may be first larded or not. When boned, well season the meat on the inner side, and add a little game forcemeat; roll it up very tight, fasten it securely, and braise, bake, or roast it. Glaze it highly before serving.

THE BEEAKFAST BOOK. 23 are now to be procured at tbe leading provision shops: these dishes are called terrines, and in them we can preserve our pies, or portions of pies, in safety. Meat pasties may also he made in these terrines, using them in place of crust, and merelj'’ lining them with thin slices of bacon fat or a layer of forcemeat or both: put some of the same upon the top, place on the cover, and bake as you would an oidinary pie. If preferred, the pies when cold can be turned out of the terrines by first laying the dishes for a few moments in boiling water. SWEETBREADS. These require to be blanched or parboiled, to whiten them. This being done, rub them with butter, and roast them, or cut them lengthwise, dip them into • egg and bread-crumbs, and either fry them or broil them in paper cases; or, without cutting them, put into an oven and bake them; or slice them cross- wise, and toss them in butter. Serve them with tomato sauce, and decorate them with slices of lemon or barberries, or very delicately-cut slices of toasted ham, bacon, or tongue. They are also capable of be- ing converted into rissoles, scallops, or croquettes, and are exceedingly delicious curried. Cold sweet- breads are excellent as a mayonnaise, or with a remo- lade or ravigote sauce.

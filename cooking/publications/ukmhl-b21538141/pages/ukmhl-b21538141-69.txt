6/ CHAPTER VII. CULINARY REQUISITES. COOKING UTENSILS, ETC. It is of importance that every kitchen, small or large, should be equipped with the best possible utensils. No workman can produce satisfactory results without proper tools, and it is unreasonable to expect a cook to perform his or her work in a satisfactory manner without the necessary implements. A good kitchen equipment is one of the foundations of good catering. There is no end to the introduction of patent cooking utensils and alleged labour-saving machines for the kitchen ; some of them are excellent and economical, whilst others are of little use to the practical cook, and many are dear at any price. It is difficult to give a complete list of cooking utensils needed, for this must, of course, be governed by individual circumstances ; but in order to indicate what is needed for an average large household kitchen, a list of the essential articles is appended. To each item in this list an explanation of the use for which the utensils are intended has been attached. LIST OF COOKING UTENSILS. For a Completely Equipped Moderate-sized Kitchen.

65 CHAPTER VI. ON COOKING TEMPERATURES. The chief factor in cooking is heat, the laws of which even now are not completely undei'stood in the scientific world. It is a most difficult study, and the average cook may be pardoned if he shows ignorance on the subject; nevertheless, a certain amount of theoretical knowledge is necessary to all who wish to advance in their profession and show a uniform excellence in their work. We know that the action of heat on foods is partly chemical and partly mechanical, and is manifested in a great variety of ways. This should teach us that mere happy-go- lucky methods will not be sufficient. Study and the observance of well- established rules (modified according to circumstances) are necessary.

For sugar spinning, 280 degrees. For general use (the crack), 312 degrees. Failure in the kitchen can often be traced to the want of know- ledge of the proper temperatures needed for various kinds of culinary work. E GL.\SS SYRUP GAUGE (FRENCH).

Remove the herbs, pound the remainder till smooth, add the foie-gras (freed from fat and cut into small pieces), and rub through a sieve. (The truffles in the foie-gras should be removed, chopped rather coarsely, and mixed with the farce when finished.) Stuff the quails with this, shape each bird neatly, place them in a braising-pan on a bed of mirepoix, moisten with a little of the wine, cover with buttered paper, and braise in the oven ; when half done add the sauce and the remainder of the wine. Let the birds cool, strain the liquor from the braising-pan into a small stew-pan, remove the fat, reduce'to the consistency of glaze, and coat the quails with this. Mix a little aspic with the meat glaze, and let dissolve over the fire. Cut the quails in halves and place them (cut sides down) on a wire tray. Glaze each with meat glaze and aspic.

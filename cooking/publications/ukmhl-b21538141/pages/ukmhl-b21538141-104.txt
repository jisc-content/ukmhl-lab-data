Gumbo, and other foreign soups, also fhe national soups, such as hotch-potch, Scotch broth, cock-a-leekie, etc., are included in this list. Sick-room Soups.—There are also a number of soup preparafions such as beef fea, frog brofh, beef-juice, chicken and veal tea, oat and barley broth, which come under the heading of soups. These apply specially to sick-room cookery, and invalid diet. Service of Soups.--Two soups are sometimes served for large dinners or elaborafe banquefs, in which case clear soup is served firsf. The fendencies of modern dinner-parties being to shorten the service, only one soup is served, unless the dinner is for a large number, when occasionally the choice of fwo soups is given, viz. a clear and a fhick soup. A light clear soup, nicely flavoured and prettily garnished, is far more appreciated, or more often selected, than thick soup when two soups are given ; though thick soups are also very popular, and should not on any account be discarded. In selecting the soups for a dinner every care should be taken so that the composition is not repeated in any other dish served for fhe same dinner. Note.—For Recipes of Soups see Chapfer XV.

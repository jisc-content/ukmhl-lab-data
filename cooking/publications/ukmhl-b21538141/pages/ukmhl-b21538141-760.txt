Halves of peaches filled with almond paste (marzipan), dressed on croutons of Genoise, and then cooked in oven ; served hot with syrup. Dartois de Peches {Peach Meringne). Roll out good puff paste about one-eighth of an inch thick, cut it up into four inch-square pieces. Stamp the paste halfway through with a square pastry-cutter, leaving a three-quarter inch margin all around, brush over with beaten egg-yolk, place on a baking-tin, and bake. When baked, remove the centre portion, fill the opening with chopped preserved peaches flavoured with syrup and mara- schino, and spread over \Htli a meringue mixture. Put half a preserved peach on top of each, and half an almond under the peach. Return to the oven to set the meringue, and serve hot or cold. Savarin a la Moscovienne. Prepare and bake a savarin cake (p. 756) in the usual way. When done, unmould and saturate it well with a hot rum syrup. Place the cake on a round silver- plated dish (the shape of the cake must, of course, be hollow in the centre). Heat up two to three table- spoonfuls of apri- cot marmalade, strain this and add to it a table- spoonful of cura- 90a liqueur, reduce a little and keep hot. Whisk two whites of eggs to a stiff froth, stir into it the pre- pared marmalade, fill up the centre of the cake with this, and ornament the base of the cake with the same mixture by means of a cornet or forcing-bag with a rose pipe, dredge over with castor sugar and bake in a moderately hot oven for about twenty minutes. Decorate the sides with angelica and glace cherries. Send to table hot with a boat of apricot or other fruit sauce.

94 THE jV£ir CENTURY COOKERY BOOK. CHAPTER IX, STOCKS AND SOUPS. (For individual recipes see Chapter XV.) It is an acknowledged fact that stock forms the essential basis for all meat soups, consommes, most thick soups, sauces, and gravies, and as such it is recognised as being the foundation or, as Francatelli terms it, " the very soul of good cookery ” ; this is not altogether an exaggeration, for stock is also largely used for many other culinary preparations. Stock is the liquid, or broth, into which the juices of meat, vegetables, etc., have been extracted by means of low and gentle simmering. Thus the chief object in making stock must be that of drawing the goodness out of the materials employed into the liquid contained in the stock-pot. There is a wide range of STOCK-POT (Marmiie). stocks,* from the simple homely bone stock to the double stock used for consommes, but the most useful is what cooks term the “ general stock,” which will serve not only for soups and sauces, but also for a vast number of other culinary preparations for which water is often used merely because there is no stock at hand. Every household kitchen wherein it is desired to attain some degree of perfection, as well as of economy, should keep a constant supply of good stock. Unfortunately many ignorant or over-careful cooks, as well as housewives, look upon the stock-pot as a sort of culinary rubbish bin, where everything which cannot be made use of finds its way. * There are four kinds of stock principally used in cooking: 1. Meat stock. 2. Game stock. 3. Fish stock ) These are called “maigre,” because no meat is used 4. Vegetable stock j in their preparation.

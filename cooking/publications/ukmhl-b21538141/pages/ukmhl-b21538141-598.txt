592 THE NEW CENTURY COOKERY BOOK. CHAPTER XXVI. REMOVESâ€”RELEVES. The general rule is that roast or braised joints should be served under this heading. Whatever the remove is, the dish demands the accompaniment of a vegetable, which is served separately or else as a garnish. The French bone most of their joints, and usually dish them up with some kind of garniture. Boiled meat is also at times served as remove. The most popular dishes served for fhis course are saddle of mutton or lamb, leg of mutton or lamb, shoulder of mutton or lamb, neck and loin of mutton, haunch of mutton or lamb, fricandeau of veal, sirloin or ribs of beef, fillet of beef, venison, deer, wild boar, ham, braised or baked. In abbre- viated dinners, where no poultry is introduced in other courses, a roast or boiled turkey, fowl or capon is sometimes served as a remove or releve. Common-place joints, such as roast beef, mutton, lamb, etc., are not included in the recipes, as roasting is fully dealt with in Chapter VIII. The correct order of serving the remove or releve is immediately after the entrees, but on the Continent, and occasionally in England and America, these dishes are served after the fish course.

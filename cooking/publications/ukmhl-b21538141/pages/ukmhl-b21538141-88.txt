Only enough liquid is used to cover the meat, etc., to prevent evaporation. The following are the reasons for claiming this mode of cooking as the most economical : 1. Tough meat (coarse and cheap), unsuitable for either roasting or boiling, can be made tender and palatable by stewing. 2. There is practically no waste in nutriment, for solids and liquids are both served up. 3. Little fuel and little attention are required. There are two ways of stewing known and practised : the hrst is partly frying or browning the meat, etc., before stewing, and the second is par-boiling (Irish-stew type). Stewing is performed in earthenware covered jars and stewpans, in the oven or over the lire. To soften the hbres of coarse meat, it is often soaked or steeped in vinegar. Braising.—Braising (or braizing) is a combination of roasting and stewing small joints of meat in a shallow stewpan, called “ braisoire,” or braiser, which has a close-htting lid with a grooved edge round it, on which hot coals (charcoal) are placed, whereby the meat can be cooked with a hre above it as well as under it. This process of cook- ing, it is said, greatly decreases loss by evaporation. It is a favourite method with the French, and is supposed to bring out an unusually hue flavour and aroma. Viands to be braised are generally boned, and either larded or barded with thin slices of fat bacon. The pan in which a braise is braisoire or fricandeau pan BRAISING PAN.

It is usually moistened with stock, or stock and wine.

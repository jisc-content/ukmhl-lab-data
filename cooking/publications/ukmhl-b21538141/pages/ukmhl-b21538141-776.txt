Dish np in a pile and serve with a boat of custard, made with the remaining yolk of egg, the milk, and a teaspoonful of cornflour. Baked Bananas. Select large and not over-ripe bananas for this dish. Strip off about a third of the skin lengthways, and loosen the remainder of the skin from the fruit by means of a teaspoon. Lay the banana in a buttered saute-pan or baking-dish, place a few very small pieces of butter on the top of each, and besprinkle freely with castor sugar, pour over each about half a teaspoonful of lemon-juice, and bake from fifteen to twenty minutes in a hot oven. Dish up neatly, and serve hot.

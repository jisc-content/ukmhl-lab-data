THE NEW CENTURY COOKERY BOOK. 1004 scale, for a great deal depends upon the diners and the host’s position and means. The best plan in every case is to hit the happy medium which will satisfy the guests and harmonise with the host’s position. An elaborate ball supper, a State banquet, or a society dinner requires a very different menu from that pro- vided for a little dinner to entertain a few friends. RULES TO BE OBSERVED IN COMPILING MENUS. The chief considerations for all menus, whether of a frugal or more important character, may be sum- marised as follows ; I. The kind and style of a meal and the number of guests expected. 2. To hx the number of courses of which the meal is to consist. 3. The selection of dishes, special attention being paid to the choice thereof, observing that they must bear suitable relation to each other, as explained in Rule 6. 4. Observe the season of the year, and be guided accordingly. iMenus vary according to the seasons. Certain products are at their best at different periods ; therefore it is more or less essential that these be considered. In January and February ox-tail or giblet soup and all kinds of game, such as wild duck, woodcocks, and snipe, are served. These latter are not procurable in April or May. In April and May spring soup, crimped sal- mon, lamb, etc., would be considered most seasonable dishes. 5. In introducing so-called sea- sonable viands into a menu see that the remainder of dishes or courses harmonise with them. In the spring, for instance, young poultry and the meat of young animals and young vegetables are in perfec- tion. If a special feature of these be made in a menu, it would be considered bad taste to introduce a mock-turtle or ox-tail soup, for it would need a lighter and more delicate soup with which to com- mence a dinner with a plat printanier, viz. a spring dish.

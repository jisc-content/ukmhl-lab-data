998 THE NEW CENTURY COOKERY BOOK. champagne takes the lead, and continues to be served nntil the dessert, when port and old claret are placed npon the table. The following is the correct classihcation of wines as served with the various courses Chablis or Sauterne with Hors-d'oeuvre. Sherry or Marsala with Soup. Hock or Sauterne with Fish. Claret or Burgundy with Entrees and Removes. Champagne with Roast and Entremets. Port, Claret or Madeira with the Dessert. The custom of serving at least six kinds of wine at dinner—that is, a different kind with each course—was, until a few years ago, observed at the royal tables ; in fact. His Majesty King Edward VH. used at one time to be very much in favour of a coiu'se of various wines at dinner, but of late years the number and kind of wines have been reduced to two or three at the most.

This should be done an hour before the wine is served. To moderately cool Sauterne and Rhine wines brings out their bouquet and gives them an agreeable fresh flavour. Claret and Burgundy, on the contrary, should be drunk milk warm. This condition is secured by carefully setting the bottle in hot water, and allowing it to remain long enough to gently heat the wine, or near a fire. This brings out its body and diminishes any tendency to astringency. Port, sherry, and Madeira, being fortified vunes, containing certain proportions of unfermented sugar, are usually termed hot wines, because the brandy heats the palate and produces a similar bodily sensation after drinking. These wines lose in body and flavour by being chilled. Port through exposure to cold

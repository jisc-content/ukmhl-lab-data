THE NEW CENTURY COOKERY BOOK. 58 apparatus, stoves or ranges that are heated by means of coal. The success of cooking has a great deal to do with the kind of cooking apparatus used. That success depends largely on the following points :— (a) Perfect construction. (b) Perfect draughts and flues (c) Perfect working. Success depends, further, upon the management of the fire, dampers, and flues used, and the skill of the cook as a stoker. Coal cooking-stoves and ranges are constructed of malleable iron, steel, cast iron, and wrought iron. Stoves at a very low price cannot be recommended with confidence, because they usually waste fuel, frequently smoke, and are constantly out of order ; whilst well- constructed stoves from reliable makers, which are air-tight, made Baking.

The above is an “ Eagle ” range, with the front plate removed to exhibit the arrangement of the flues by which the ovens are heated. The right-hand or roasting oven has the fire working first over and then down the side, and lastly underneath the bottom ; this is the best arrangement for meat roasting and general cooking.

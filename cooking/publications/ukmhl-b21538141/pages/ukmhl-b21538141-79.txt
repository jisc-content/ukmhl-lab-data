COOKING PROCESSES AND THEIR EFFECTS. 77 COPPER BOll.ING PAN. In boiling meat, the addition of vegetables, such as carrots, turnips, onions, celery, bouquet garni, etc., is a decided improve- ment, for thereby the flavour of the article boiled as well as the liquor (broth) will be much better. The exact time for boiling and steaming cannot be fixed in an arbitrary manner. It varies from ten to forty minutes to the pound. Dis- cretion as well as experience are the best guides to decide this question. Boiling meats, fish, vegetables, etc., is, within certain limits, the simplest and easiest process of cooking. Boiling implies a process of cooking effected by immersion f(u- a certain period in boiling water or stock. Literally the expression “ boiling ’ incorrectly applied, as in most cases we do not really boil the food actually ; it is only the surrounding liquid that boils or bubbles. All liquids do not boil at the same degree ; but to boil water or stock means raising them to a temperature of 212° Fahrenheit, though in the strict sense there is very little cooking performed at this heat : most, in fact, is done a little below, which is the degree for simmering, slow - boiling, steaming ; or else considerably above it, as is the case with fats or oils, and these also have their boiling-point. Milk will boil at a lower temperature than water, whilst slow and gentle simmering often works out as low as 170°, never reaching 212°. Proper simmering heat is 180°. Boiling embraces two distinct objects, which differ considerably. One is to retain as much as pos- sible of the juices in the flesh, and the other is to extract the juices and to mix them with the water or other liquor in which the article is boiled. To effect the first-named purpose—that is, to retain the largest practicable proportion of gravy in a joint of meat—the meat to be boiled should be put into fast-boiling water, and be allowed to boil is both vague and oftfen

674 THE NEW CENTURY COOKERY BOOK. CHAPTER XXX. OMELETTES AND OTHER EGG DISHES. That the nutritive properties of eggs are by far greater than that of almost any other food product is an acknowledged fact. It is also true that by the help of eggs we are enabled to prepare more appetising, dainty, and wholesome dishes than we can with Omelets are no doubt the most popular form of dishes produced from eggs, although the making thereof is but seldom properly understood in this country ; there is, as a rule, a certain knack, care, and delicacy needed in the manipulation in order to prepare a correct continental omelet. These can easily be acquired, and the best way is by means of practice. The best and most convenient way to make an omelet is to break six or eight eggs, according to the size required. It is unwise to attempt a larger sized omelet unless one is a master hand at it. The eggs used must be fresh, and must be well but not over beaten, just long enough to thoroughly amalgamate the whites with the yolks. A little cream or milk, say a tablespoonful of either to three eggs, added will make the omelet lighter and moister. The pan used must be ejuite clean ; it must only be used for omelets and must never be allowed to be washed. The best way to clean it is to make it hot over the fire and to rub the inside with a handful of coarse salt and then wipe it with a paper and rubber. The butter, which must be fresh {not salt butter), is next put into the pan. About an ounce is the average quantity required for four eggs, the less used the better. It must be allowed to get quite hot hut not burning before the eggs are poured in.

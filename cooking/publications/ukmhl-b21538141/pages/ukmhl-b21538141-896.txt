Prepare a salpicon of a quarter jar of Russian caviare, three to four anchovy fillets cut into small dice, twelve prawn-tails cut into small dice. Add sufficient remou- lade sauce to bind this mixture, and fill the cavities of eggs with this. Place each on oval-shaped croutons of bread fried in butter. Sauce over each carefully with remoulade sauce, dish up, and garnish neatly with prawns and cress or parsley. Serve as hors-dâ€™oeuvre or side dish. When a large quantity of eggs dressed in this style is needed, it is advisable to incorporate a sheet of dissolved gelatine into each gill of remoulade sauce.

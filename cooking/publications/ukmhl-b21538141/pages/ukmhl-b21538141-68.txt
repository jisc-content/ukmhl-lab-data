66 THE NEW CENTURY COOKERY BOOK. “ Cooking Thermometers ” have been found useful; for with their help beginners are better able to estimate the correct tem- perature for each process. By the aid of a reliable culinary thermo- meter, such as is shown in the illustration, every degree of heat from 50 to 500 Fahrenheit can be ascertained. When boiling, simmering, roasting, baking or frying heat is required, the thermometer shows at a glance whether the heat is as it should be to ensure success. Temperatures are registered with scientific precision, so that the fire of a stove or oven can be regulated just as required. The instru- ment is made of brass ; it will register the heat in a pan of boiling syrup or stock; it will hang on the side of the frying-pan, or stand in the oven ; it acts as a pyrometer, as well as a saccharometer for boiling sugar. Both the cooking thermometers here illus- trated can be obtained from any first- class ironmonger. The following may be accepted as a fairly safe guide to the tem- peratures required for certain methods of cooking : Boiling fast . 212 degrees of Fahrenheit. ,, slow 205 to 210 ,, Simmering . 180 to igo ,, ( Mutton 300 Oven Roasting - Beef . . . . 310 ( Game and iioultry 310 i Meat pies 290 Oven Baking 1 Pastry and cakes 320 ' Bread and puff paste . 340 When an oven registers 200 degrees or less, it is not hot enough for baking or roasting. Frying.—When oil is employed, it must be raised to a much greater temperature than either fat, butter, or even lard. For fish the fat should be from 360 to 375 degrees, according to the kind and size of fish to be fried. For meat, from 370 to 380 degrees. For fritters, etc., 340 to 375 degrees. Whitebait require a heat of 400 degrees, if they are to be fried successfully. The temperature of oil for frying is necessarily much greater than any other fat.

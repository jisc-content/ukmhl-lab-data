THE NEW CENTURY COOKERY BOOK. 76 CHAPTER VIII. COOKING PROCESSES AND THEIR EFFECTS. BOILING. Boiling being one of those easy ways of cooking which everybody considers he can do—but, as a matter of fact, few understand this properly, because too little attention is paid to it—in consequence, we give it the first place, because it is a branch which needs and deserves more attention. It all depends how the boiling method is effected when cooking meat, poultry or vegetables, for by its application meat may be rendered tough and hard, or tender— it may lose or retain its flavour and nutriment. Boiling is one of the most common forms of cooking, and food cooked in this way is called boiled. The word “ boiling ” is derived from the French bouillir or boulir, to boil—i.e. to be in bubbling motion. The term “ bubbling ” applied to cookery, has a special technical meaning, viz. “ cooking in boiling liquid.” Both boiling and steaming are known as the simplest, most economical, as well as the most common forms of cooking. Meat loses less weight by boiling, steaming or stewing, than by any other ])i'ocess. In the case of boiling, the liquor—i.e. the water in which meat, etc., is boiled— can be turned to good account. Boiled food is considered whole- some, and is easily digested. Special points to be observed in boiling are : That the water should at all times be kept so as to cover the meat or vegetables or other things to be cooked. If it evaporates, it is best to add hot water, because the sudden introduction of cold water will lower the temperature, which is not always advisable. OVAL BOILING POT.

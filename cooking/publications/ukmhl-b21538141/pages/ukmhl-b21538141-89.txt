87 COOKING PROCESSES AND THEIR EFFECTS. The more delicate meats, such as sweetbreads, hllets, fowls, turkeys, etc., are sometimes covered with buttered paper ; this is done to prevent the heat from the top of the pan scorching or imparting too much of a roast flavour to the meats which are to be braised. Occasional basting during the process of this method of cooking is essential. When done, the meat is taken up, the fat removed from the mirepoix and gravy, which latter is then reduced, strained, and blended with some kind of gravy or thin sauce. Mirepoix.—The miyepoix, or bed of sliced carrot, turnip, onion, bacon or ham, and bouquet of herbs, is indispensable in braising. By this means is imparted a delicate flavour of vegetables and aromatics. Meats which are otherwise dry and of little flavour, such as veal, become saturated with juices, which render the food succulent and delicious. Spices and wine are sometimes used to impart their flavours. The process of cooking a braise is thus spoken of by Jules Gouffe in his “ Livre de Cuisine ” : The chief operation is one of slow simmering, for, he says, if the meat be exposed to sudden heat the gravy is insipid, colourless, and weak, as it too often is when prepared by careless or ignorant cooks. The gravy should be highly nutritious, of a rich, high colour and of cooking is most effective, and you at once obtain two admirable dishes instead of one, for when the braise is cold it is equally good, and affords a pleasant change.” Poeler.—This word has no English equivalent, but its meaning can be grasped from a description of the utensil and the process. flavour, and of gelatinous consistency. “ I advise,” he says, ” that for braising the quantity of meat shoulcl be large rather than small, as a long process should be large rather than small, as a long pn FOLDING BROILER OR GRILLER.

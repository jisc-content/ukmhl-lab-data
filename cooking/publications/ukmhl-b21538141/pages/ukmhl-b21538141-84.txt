82 THE NEW CENTURY COOKERY BOOK. the cooking does not proceed at all, nor does steamed meat ]:>roduce any broth. In other respects steaming is highly re- commendable, and more especially for invalid cookery, because the slower the process of cooking the more digestible foods become. MEAT SCREEN AND DRIPPING PAN. ROASTING. From the earliest ages rood has been cooked by exposing it to the direct heat of a hre, and roasting still remains the favourite form of cooking joints of meat or birds. The intense heat, combined with the free action of the hot air, produces and im- parts that savoury taste and fine flavour which is quite unlike that obtained in any other way. To obtain the best possible results, a clear, brisk, and yet steady fire is needed, particularly at the beginning of the process. The intense heat quickly forms a thin crust on the surface of the joint or bird, which prevents the escape of the juices. Roasting before a fire is cooking by radiated heat, the heat rays coming direct from the fire to the joint hanging before it. This can be effected by either a close or open range, as will be seen by the illustrations given herewith. Rules for Roasting a Joint.â€”i. The joint should be placed before a hot fire for the first ten minutes, and then be allowed to cook more slowly. The great heat hardens the outside of the meat and keeps in the juices. After this the cooking should proceed more slowly, other- wise the outside will be overdone. 2. The fire should be bright and clear. 3. The joint should be basted about every ten minutes, as this helps to cook it, keeps it juicy, and improves the flavour. 4. The time allowed is 15 minutes for every pound, and 20 minutes over for beef and mutton ; for veal and pork 20 minutes for ever}/ pound, and 30 minutes over. Pork should be well cooked. 5. The jack should be wound up as soon as the meat is ROASTING BEFORE AN OPEN FIRE RANGE, attached, aud re-wound when (WASTEFUL.) necessary.

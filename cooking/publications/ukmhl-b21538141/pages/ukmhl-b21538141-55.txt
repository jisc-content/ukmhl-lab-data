Cold potatoes can be used in numerous ways., Tney can be fried, tossed or sauted, though boiled potatoes will never do to be re- heated and served again as boiled ; for in that guise they have a very peculiar wavmed-np flavour, which would tell the tale at once. Cold potatoes, when rubbed through a sieve, are useful for making fish cakes, meat croquettes or cold meat pies. Sliced, they make an excellent salad, if properly and liberally seasoned with salad dressing. A delicious pie is made with minced meat, moistened with a nicely flavoured sauce and put in a pie-dish,-covered with a good layer of mashed potatoes and baked in the oven. Mashed up with left- over cold flsh, moistened with the remainder of the white sauce and a little butter, a good material for a pie or croquette is available. Potato-balls and croquettes are also made from cold potatoes. Cold vegetables are used for salads, either separately or mixed with cold meat and dressing. Cold green vegetables, such as green peas, French beans, globe artichokes, asparagus, etc., make very good salads if seasoned with an ordinary vinaigrette sauce ; this latter is a mixture of three parts of salad oil and one part of vinegar, salt, pepper, and chopped parsley. Again, many vegetables, especi- ally peas, beans, sprigs of cauliflower, and artichokes, come in handy as garnitures for meat dishes and certain soups. Bones and scraps of meat, if insufficient for a special dish, and gravy left over from roast meat, should be put into the stock-pot. In order to assist the cook in practising economy, I have intro- duced a number of recipes for dishes in the preparation of which cold meat, etc., may be advantageously employed.

Filets de Soles a Iâ€™Americaine. 2 soles of medium size, white wine, 2 shallots, tomato pulp, veloutee sauce (p. 161), breadcrumbs, lobster butter. Skin the soles, take off the fillets and fold them neatly, after trimming the edges. Season with pepper and salt, and arrange them in a row on a buttered gratin dish (china or plated dish). Moisten with a little white wine, and sprinkle over two small finely chopped shallots. Cover with buttered paper and cook in the oven for five minutes, then pour the liquor from the dish into a previoifsly prepared rich tomato sauce (made with tomato pulp and veloutee, and well reduced). Pour this carefully over the fish so as to com- pletely mask it. Sprinkle over some freshly made breadcrumbs, and place tiny pieces of lobster butter (p. 175) on each fillet.

When done, take up and drain, cook the rice until it is almost dry, and shape it in the centre of a dish, dress the fillets of soles round the rice shape. Melt an ounce of butter and let it get a nut-brown colour (this is called Beurre Noisette), then put in the chopped parsley and pour over the dish, garnish round the base with the fried aubergines, and serve hot.

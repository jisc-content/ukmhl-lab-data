989 THE ART OF CARVING. first slices of the breast should be cut close to the wing, proceeding upwards to the centre of the breast (breast-bone). The legs are next removed and cut in two at the joints. If stuffed, an open- ing should be made at the end portion of the cluck, and the stuffing scooped out with a spoon, allowing a small portion to each guest. A large duck is carved in the same way as a goose. B.—HOW TO CARVE THE WING PORTION OF A DUCK. After cutting through the tlesh of the wing, as indicated by the white line, press back the wing and separate it by the help of a knife and fork from the socket where the wing joins the body of the duck. To Carve a Goose.—Stick the fork into the centre of the breast, hold firmly, and commence to carve slices from the neck down the breast, as shown in the illustration. Remove the wings and leg-bones, and commence carving the re- mainder of the goose, leaving nothing but the carcase. Note.—See also illustrations on carving a duck. To Carve Partridges, Woodcocks, etc.—Put the fork into the breast, cut a slice from the outside of the breast, then cut close A GOOSE (lines indicate manner of carving).

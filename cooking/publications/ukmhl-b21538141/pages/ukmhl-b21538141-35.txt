31 MARKETING. Veal.—In choosing veal the flesh should be very pale in colour. It is preferred when very pale, but is more juicy when of a slightly deeper colour (a bright red). The loin affords the best means of judging the superior quality and freshness of veal. If the kidney, found on the underside of one end of the loin, is enwrapped in white and firm-looking fat, it is a sign of good quality and fresh- ness. On the other hand, if the fat around the kidney is soft, the flesh flabby and spot- ted, the meat is not fresh or the quality is poor. This meat is rather indigesti- ble, and, if very young, does not contain much nourishment. For buying veal, or indeed any other kind of meat for roasting, one must calculate about half a pound to every guest. Veal has always been much esteemed tor its delicate pale pink colour, which in some cases is almost white ; this is due to the animal being killed when very young. The best season for veal is from March to the end of July. It is, however, obtainable and consumed throughout the year. Veal is more highly esteemed and of superior flavour on the Continent than in this country. The head and breast are the most favourite parts, and the fricandeau also forms a variety of delicate dishes. In Switzerland and Germany a dish of veal is frequently recommended to convalescents.

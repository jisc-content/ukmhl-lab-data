THE NEW CENTURY COOKERY BOOK. â–  894 CHAPTER XXXVIL BREAKFAST AND SUPPER DISHES. Knowing how important it is to provide suitable dishes for breakfast and supper, but especially the former, and the great difficulty one often meets in hnding a change from the fried eggs and bacon, grilled haddock, and poached eggs, I have thought it desirable to devote a special chapter to this often-neglected branch of cookery. Many of the recipes given in a previous chapter devoted to Omelets and other varieties of egg-preparations form suitable Break- fast and Supper Dishes. Eggs in every form enable the cook to vary the daily breakfast and supper menus, for they provide a valuable aid in cookery generally.

Free the fish from skin and bones, and shred or chop it finely. Put it into a small stew-pan with the butter, when hot, add the bread- crumbs, anchovy essence or paste, and the egg (beaten). Mix tho- roughly, and add the seasoning. Cook whilst stirring for five minutes, then add the cream. Put it into a buttered pie-dish, sprinkle over a few fried breadcrumbs, bake in the oven till the surface is nicely browned, and serve. Baked Cod a la Menagere.

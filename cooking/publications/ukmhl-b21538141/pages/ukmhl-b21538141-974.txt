968 THE NEW CENTURY COOKERY BOOK. cook. Juicy fruits, such as strawberries, raspberries, and cherries require about ten minutes longer. The times specified are reckoned from when the jam actually boils. In wet seasons or with very ripe fruit, less or no water can be used, and under the same conditions full amounts of sugar are required. The best way to test the consistency of jams is to put a little on a clean plate or saucer, and if it sets when cold it is done ; if the syrup remains liquid, boil it a little longer and then test again. Many fruits may be kept whole by straining them from the syrup when sufficiently cooked. When the syrup has been boiled rapidly until it jellies when tested, the fruit should be replaced for a final gentle boil. Directly the jam is cooked, have ready some clean dry jars ; fill them, and tie them down. Vegetable parchment damped in cold water, wiped with a clean cloth, stretched over the jar and tied dowm, keeps the jam very air-tight. If the parchment is not procm'able, dip some thin paper in milk and press it over the top of the jar until the heat from the jam causes the milk to evaporate, and the paper sticks firmly to the jar.

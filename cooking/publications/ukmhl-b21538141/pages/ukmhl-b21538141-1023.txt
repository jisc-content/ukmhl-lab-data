lOI LENTEN DINNER MENUS. LENTEN DINNER (DINERS MAIGRES) AND MEATLESS FARE MENUS. A “ diner niaigre ” literally means a Lenten dinner, the early days of Lent ; and as so many persons are, for conscience or inclination’s sake, interested in Lenten fare, a few menus with dishes of strictly orthodox type are herewith given. The dishes suitable for such meals must, as a matter of course, not include any flesh or fowl. The materials to be used in the preparation must therefore consist only of fish, vegetable, and farinaceous products. The modern cook and housekeeper has learnt that it is possible by scientific methods to cook both fish and vegetables in a more varied and tasty fashion than the cook of bygone days used to do. Vegetables, in particular, have of late played a very important part in our menus. There is a special chapter devoted to Meatless Dishes, with an abundance of choice recipes, from which it will be seen that meat substitutes are really wonderful in variety and value.

1005 THE CONSTRUCTION OF MENUS. 6. See that the combination of every dish selected is well assorted, the colour well blended, and linally see that the flavours of the materials are judiciously applied. 7. See that everything needed for carrying out the programme is procured in good time, so that it may be handy when required. 8. In carrying out a menu, from the beginning to the time of serving the dishes thereon, observe punctirality in the strictest sense. Never serve anything half-flnished, and see that hot dishes are served hot, and cold dishes cold. 9. Make sure that every dislr on the menn is correctlv and concisely described. It matters little in what language the menu is set up, so long as the correct rules above specified are properly observed. French being the recog- nised language of the kitchen all over the civilised world, it has become the fashion, rightly or wrongly, to make out every menu of importance in that language. It is quite true that there are a number of typical French and other foreign dishes which cannot be trans- lated into English in any form of nicely sounding words ; but I maintain that in most cases, should it be so desired, ^the English vocabulary is suffici- ently rich to provide a name for every dish. The langiie de cuisine, or kitchen Erench, is practically a language of itself, and unless one is well acquainted with the many terms and phrases thereof it becomes no easy task to remember the correct names of the various dishes which constitute a recherche dejeuner, dinner, luncheon or supper. MENUS FOR FAROE DINNERS. In preparing a bill of fare for a large dinner it is advisable not to include dishes which are difficult to dress when done in a great number, for such will cause needless complication in the kitchen, and often lead to a confusion in the service. It is also most unwise to use new names of dishes which are not known, or which may be OF THE KING AND QUEEN OF SWEDEN.

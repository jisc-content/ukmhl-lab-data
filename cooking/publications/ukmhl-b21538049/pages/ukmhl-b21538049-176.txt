178 How to cook Drinking Sowens.—Yule sowenswhen prepared resembled good cream in colour and thickness. The method of cooking was to have the sowens paste reduced by water till about the thickness of new milk, and to warm it in a pail placed in a pot of boiling water, care being taken to prevent knotting by active stirring. When little over blood-heat or about half between that and boiling- point the dish was ready. It was usually sweetened with syrup, and before the days of syru[) it is said to have been served with a little butter. Boiled Sowens.—This dish of sowens is made some- what like porridge or cornflour or other white pudding. It is simply boiled till it begins to get stiff. Served with sugar and cream it makes a kind of pudding which is very palatable, and at the same time it has the virtue of being very easily digested. Beef-Brose and Sauty Bannocks.—Fastern’s Een was the time for the l)eef-brose and the sauty bannocks, and Fastern’s Een is the same as the English Shrove Tuesday. Its date is determined in the following rhyme ;— “ First comes Caiidlemas and then tlie new Mime, Next Tuesday after that, that is Fastern’s Een.” On this particular day the custom was to have for dinner beef-brose, at least, that was the first course of the dinner. It was made by pouring the boiling liquid from beef that had been boiled over oatmeal in the usual way that brose is made, which makes a very strong meal, suited to strong men who live in the open air. Bannock Night, its the same evening was called, was given up to the making of the bannocks. They were a kind of pancake, but with the years they have passed through an eviflution-—from the original sauty bannock to the fine pancake which has now taken its place where the custom has not died out. The sauty bannock was a pancake composed of oatmeal, milk, a few eggs, and salt. Later on flour was substituted for oatmeal and the salt was reduced and syrup added.

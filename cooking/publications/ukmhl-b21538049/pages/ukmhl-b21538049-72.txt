Of six pretty new laid eggs you must take the yolks and whites, Peat them well up in a basin till they thoroughly combine. And be sure you chop the suet up particularly fine. Take a pound of well-stoned raisins and a pound of currants dried, A pound of pounded sugar and some candied peel beside, Rub them all well up together in a pound of wheaten flour. And let them stand to settle for a quarter of an hour. Then tie the mixture in a cloth and put it in a pot. Some people like the water cold and some prefer it hot, But though I donâ€™t know which of these two plans I ought to praise, I know it ought to boil an hour for every pound it weighs. Oh ! were I the Queen of France or, far better. Pope of Rome, I would have a Christmas pudding every day I dined at home. All the world should have a piece and if any did remain. Next morning to my breakfast I would have it fried again.

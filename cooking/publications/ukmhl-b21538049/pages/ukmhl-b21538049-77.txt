The Perfect Wheat Foods DAINTY. NOURISHING. “ FAROLA is immeasurably superior to Arrowroot, Corn Flour, Sago, etc. With milk it forms exquLsite pucklings, and in the nursery it will prove a valuable variety which children will take with avidity.’—Liverpool Medico-Chirurgical Jom nal. Awarded Gold Medals at the two Important Inter- national Exhibitions held in 1886—Edinburgh and Liverpool—two years before any imitations were in the mai-ket. FAROLA is a highly-refined preparation of Wheat, which conserves all the nutritive elements and fine flavour naturally belonging to the purest part of the grain. All irritating and indigestible matter has been removed by careful treatment, mechanical means only being employed. FAROLA will satisfy a robust appetite, but it is specially suited for invalids’and children. Is similar in constitution and purity to Farola, but is in the form ot large granules, and is therefore specially suited for making such dishes as Porridge, Steamed Pudding, &c.

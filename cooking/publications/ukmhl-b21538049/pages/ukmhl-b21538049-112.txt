114 FRICASSEED EGGS. I large onion. I carrot. I clove. I pint of milk. Small bunch of parsley. 4 or 5 eggs, li ozs. of flour. 2 ozs. of butter. Salt and pepper. A few thin slices of bacon Prepare vegetable.s, stick close into the onion. Put all these into a clean bright saucepan with the milk, and let simmer gently for an hour. Plard boil the eggs in this way :—Put them in a pan of cold water, bring to the boil and let them boil gently for 20 minutes ; shell them and lay them in cold water till wanted. Melt the butter in a pan, stir in the flour smoothly, then strain in the milk and stir all over the fire till it boils well and thickens. Season it nicely with salt, white pepper, and a few drops of lemon juice. Cut the eggs in halves and add them to the sauce. Let them get thoroughly hot in the sauce. While they are doing so cut the bacon into neat dice (streaky bacon is the best for this dish); also some stale white bread. Fry these a nice pale brown. Arrange the eggs carefully on a hot dish, pour the sauce over them, put little heaps of fried bacon and bread alternately round the edge, and serve at once. Mrs Murr.w. JELLIED GRAVY FOR RAISED PIES. {By kind permission of /. <0 G. Cox, Lid ). 2 ozs. of Cox’s gelatine I quart water. Flavouring, herbs, etc. I teaspoon fill .salt. 12 peppercorns. Boil the peppercorns in some of the water with the flavouring, herbs, etc., for about 20 minutes; soak the gelatine in the rest of the water, then add it to the contents of the saucepan. Stir until dissolved and add the salt, then strain for use. This may be regarded as the average strength, and is a good foundation, as it may he varied in the matter of adjuncts. For example :— *P\)r veal pies add a sprig of parsley and thyme, strip of lemon rind, and a drop of Cox’s essence of mace. For pork use sage instead of the herbs named. For game a little stock may replace the water; the same applies to beef pies.

99 almost wet enough to stick to the basin. Turn out on to a well-floured board, for the butter being in pieces is more apt to stick to the board, then with well-floured hands make it square and flat If any butter shows, dust flour on lightly. With floured rolling-pin roll one way—to and from you— until the paste is about a foot long. Make it straight at the sides and corners square. Fold first one end over, then the other, quite evenly, making it three-fold. Turn it round half, making the edges look to and from you. See that all is well-floured. Press down with rolling-pin the two ends to make the layers stick and keep in place, and then roll out lightly again as before. Roll out and fold four times, but the last time just fold paste double and then roll the required size and shape. . It must not be rolled anyway but to and from you until folding is all done. A yolk of egg can be used also in mixing, but good pastry can be made without it. Bake in a very hot oven. J. Lambie, Edinburgh. TO MAKE PUFF PASTRY. i lb. of flour. I I yolk of egg. 41b. of butler. | A little lemon juice. Cold water. Squeeze the butter in a towel to free it of all water. Lay flour on the board, or better, a marble slab, making a well in the middle, into which stir the egg, water, and lemon juice, beaten together with a fork until it is a firm smooth paste, using more water if it is required. Knead if necessary to make it smooth, then roll it out into a thin paste, oblong, but square at the corners Make the butter in the towel flat and square also, and almost half the size of the paste. Lay it on one end of the paste and fold over the other end on the top of the butter, and press edges together to keep butter in. Turn half round and proceed to roll, fold and turn as \vith rough puff pastry, but do so seven times instead of four, folding double last time, and roll out the required thickness. Bake in a very hot oven, otherwise the butter will just melt and run out. J. Lambie, Edinburgh.

48 TOAD IN-A-HOLE. {^Batter Puddhig) i lb. of Hour. X of milk. I egg- Salt. I lb. of sausages. Put dry ingredients into a basin and mix. Beat up egg and add milk to it, then stir in part of these to dry ingredients, just liquid enough to beat. Beat very well, for on this depends the lightness of the batter. Let stand in a cool place for a time. Skin the sausages, by dipping in boiling water. Lay in bottom of greased pie-dish, and pour batter over. Bake in a fairly hot oven about an hour. If getting too brown before the time, change to a cooler place or lay wet sheet of paper on top. Serve either plain or with brown gravy. This dish may also be made with fruit instead of sausages, in which case sugar is added to batter, and less stilt. Mrs J. F. Lamkie, 3 Edgemont Gardens, Langside, Glasgow. TO COOK TRIPE. Tripe. Flour. Onions, or parsley, or both. Salt and pepper. Milk. Wash the tripe very thoroughly in salt and water, scraping away any discoloured or black parts. Put on well covered with water, bring to the boil then pour off Avater and add fresh water. Boil till it can be easily cut, when the water will be considerably reduced. Cut the tripe into small pieces, taking out a piece at a time on to a plate. This prevents cooling it too much or cooling the liquor, when this is done, add the onion finely chopped, then the flour broken with the milk, and cook gently for 15 to 20 minutes longer. Add parsley, pepper and salt 10 or 15 minutes before serving. It should not be thin or w^atery,â€”is as a rule served hot, but is very nice cold in summer. It can be scraped a second time if required when changing the water, J. Lambie, Edinburgh.

The secret of success in baking oat cakes is to use as little liquid as possible in moistening the meal to form the dough, and the smarter that the dough is kneaded and the less it is handled the cakes are all the more crisp. Plain Oat Cake. — Breakfastcupful of fine oatmeal; a pinch of soda; water sufficient to moisten into dough. Butter-Milk Oat Cake.—Same as abovej only use butter-milk instead of water. Cream Oak Cake.—Same as above, only use cream instead of water. A very fine cream cake is formed by varnishing the top of the cake with a thick cream before baking. Rich Oat Cake.—A rich oat cake is make by the addition of a little butter or lard when the dough is made with water or milk. The preparation is the same for all the varieties:—Mix the soda well into the meal, add the liquid, sufficient to form a stiff dough. Have the bake-board well covered with dry meal and knead out the dough upon it, roll oilt thin, Using plenty of dry meal. Bake on a hot girdle till slightly browned on the underside, turn and bake on the othet side, or toast before a glowing red fire. It improves most cakes to be toa.sted before the open fire where the moisture evaporates. Miss H. Jack, 2 Lismore Crescent, Edinburgh.

157 INVALID COOKERY. A FEW HINTS FOR THE SICK ROOM. 1. Have everything clean and bright. 2. Serve the food in small quantities. 3. Have it quite ready before the patient sees it, bringing no bones, skin, etc., which would only cause annoy- ance to the patient. 4. Have it just at the proper heat for supping or drinking, not too hot, for the mouth is sometimes tender in time of illness, and not too cool, which might sicken the patient. 5. Let everything be given at the proper time. 6. Measure exactly. 7. Make as little noise as possible, but do not creep about the room or whisper, especially if the patient is awake. 8. When making up the fire, a piece of wood instead of the poker makes less noise, and when refilling the coal-box the coal can be rolled in bundles with newspaper. These can afterwards be lifted out with- out noise and put on the fire, i, 2 or 3 bundles as required. 9. Have a good fire and all things in readiness before beginning to “ do up ” patient and bed for the day or night. 10. Keep all food outside the room, if possible. 11. Rub the carpet with a damp cloth (if damp is not injurious to patient), instead of switching. 12. Dust with a slightly damp duster and polish with another. 13. Do not have flowers with a heavy perfume, and remove what you do have, when preparing room for the night.

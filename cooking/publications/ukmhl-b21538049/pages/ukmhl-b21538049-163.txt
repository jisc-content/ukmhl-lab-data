A knap bone. 12 breakfast'cupfuls water. ^ lb. rice (if liked). Some finely-chopped parsley. Pepper and .salt. Get the bone broken up, then wash it, and put it on with cold water and boil gently all day, then strain. Next morning remove all the fat and put on the water; when it boils skim it and add the fowl (breast down), add the rice and parsley 20 minutes or J an hour before the fowl is ready.

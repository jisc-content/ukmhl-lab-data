I dessertspoonful of butter. A"ash the rabbit, removing head and heart, etc. Soak for 20 to 30 minutes in salt and water. Meanwhile prepare the following,â€” Sauce. I tablespoonful of vinegar. I oz. of butter or white dripping. I onion. A piece of carrot and celery. Bunch of herbs and blade of mace (if liked). Salt and I tomato. Some scraps of bacon. I tablespoonful of flour. 14 pints of stock or I teaspoonful of meat extract and water, or head, heart and liver well washed. Boil vinegar till almost evaporated, then add the butter, and when quite hot, fry first the onion chopped, the bacon cut into small pieces, and the vegetables, all cleaned nicely, dried and cut into small pieces ; also the herbs, spices and flour. Next add the meat extract, water, pepper and salt. Stir till it boils. Boil gently for an hour or longer and strain over the rabbit in the pan, which has been prepared as follows : Dry the rabbit; cut into suitable pieces ; make the butter hot in a pan which will go into the oven, and fry rabbit till brown ; cover with a greased paper and cook in a gentle oven till quite tender, basting frequently. The secret in doing this successfully is having the gentle oven heat all round the pan. The French have a special pan with a hollow lid with ledges to it, over and around which hot cinders are placed. In a somewhat similar way in certain parts of Scotland is peat used, for baking cakes, etc., where the people have no ovens. Jean Lamiue, Edinburgh. t) /

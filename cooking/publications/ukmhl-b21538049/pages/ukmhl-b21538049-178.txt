Have a large pot suitaldy filled witlr fast-boiling water. Put the flour into a white l.iag, tie it and plunge it into the water, keeping it moving up and down for a minute, then let it boil for 2 hours. Take it out, let it cool and keep it for use. Puddings made from flour prepared in this way are lighter and more easily digested. X.Y.Z. TO BOIL SEMOLINA, FAROLA, &c. It is considered by many that the best way to cook the above by boiling is to sprinkle the grain into the milk while boiling. I have found the following have a good result:â€” Mix the grain (i dessertspoonful to i teacupful of milk), sugar, and a little milk till smooth, add the rest of the milk and .stir till boiling. When quite boiling draw to the side a little, put lid closely on, and allow to simmer or steam for about i hour. If an egg is to be added let it cool before doing so and mix it in very quickly. The grain is well burst and the flavour of it is very fine. J. Lambie, Edinburgh.

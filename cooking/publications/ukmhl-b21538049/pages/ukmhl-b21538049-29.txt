31 MEAT D15HES. A RECIPE WHICH CAN BE VARIED. Some 12 or 14 different ways of making a Mince Roll have been sent, all different and still so alike that all could not be printed, but I have chosen two ways of doing it in the oven, “Mock Roast of Venison,” and “Roast Mince.” However, veal alone can be used, or minced steak and smoked ham, and it may be baked in a greased tin in the oven, it may be steamed in a tin, and it may be boiled tied in a cloth, in which last case it is taken out of the cloth when cooked, cloth dried, rolled up again and left between boards with a weight. When quite pressed, glaze and decorate. A VERY FINE WAY OF COOKING A HAM. For a ham weighing 10 or 12 lbs. take 2 lbs. of flour and make into paste with cold water. Roll out till it is large enough to cover the ham and overlap a bit. Lay the ham in the middle of paste, then cover, wetting the edges to make it keep together. Bake in a steady warm or moderately hot oven for 20 minutes to every r lb. and 20 minutes more. If the oven is too hot the crust will burst before the ham is nearly cooked. When ready take out, pull off the crust, which will bring the skin with it. If too fat, .scrape off some, make tidy, and cover well with the breadcrumbs. 'I he flavour (rf ham may be made milder by soaking it in cold water for a few hours previous to Ham. Flour. Water. Fine brown breadcrumbs. baking. J. Lamijik, Edinburgh. /

64 PUDDINGS, SWEETS, & PASTRY. A FEW HINTS ON MAKING PASTRY. 1. Work in a cool place. 2. U.se very cold water. 3. ^Vhen baking powder is used, bake the paste im- mediately. 4. When baking powder is not used, the pastry rises better if laid aside in a cool place (outside the window rolled in paper), between each folding and rolling. This lets the butter get firm again. 5. When a large quantity of butter is used, if possible, work on a marble slab. 6. The more butter used, the hotter the oven should be. Jean Lambie, Edinburgh. ALBERT TRIFLE. 2 small breakfastcupfuls milk. J lb. sugar. Yolks of 3 eggs. I oz. gelatine. I teaspoonful vanilla. 3 penny sponge cakes. Some nice jam. A few cherries or other cry- stallized fruit to ornament. Soak the gelatine in a little of the milk. Boil the rest of the milk and pour it over the the sugar, eggs, and gelatine, then put all back into the pot and stir until the gelatine is quite dissolved, and add vanilla. Then put a little of all this into a plain mould, put aside to get quite cold, spread pieces of the sponge cake with jam and lay in when set. Then pour rest of the custard all over and let cool. When turned out ornament with crystallised fruit. Miss R. C. Blyth, Abbotsford, Crookston.

Mrs M'Connell, Lambertville, N.J., U.S.A. CRECY SOUP. 2 lbs. of fresh red carrots. I onion. Small lump of sugar. I leek. 2 ozs. of dripping or 3 ozs. of butter. 3 pints of boiling water or stock. Crouton.^ of toast or fried bread. Wash, prepare, and cut up into pieces, the carrots, onion, and leek, and put them with the dripping and sugar into a pan. But lid on and let them simmer on a gentle fire till quite soft, then add the water or stock by degrees, also pepper, salt, and some rinds of bacon. Let the whole boil till it will make a nice thick puree when rubbed through a sieve. Return the soup to the pot, adding a small piece of butter. Cook a little longer, boiling gently to reduce it, if not thick enough, then pour into the tureen. It must be like velvet. Serve croutons on a separate dish passed round. .Mi.ss Pi,.\CE, 35 Dockwray Sq., N. Shields.

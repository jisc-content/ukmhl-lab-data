131 HOW TO COOK DOUGHNUTS, CRULLERS, &c., IN LARD. Success in making good fried cakes depends much on the cooking as well as on the mixing. In the first place there should be boiling lard enough to free them from the bottom of the pot, so that they swim on the top, and the lard should never be so hot as to smoke, or so cool as not to be to the boiling point; if it is, they will soak grease, and are spoiled. If it is at the right heat, the doughnut will in about lo mins, be of a delicate brown outside and nicely cooked inside. Try the fat by dropping a bit of the dough in first; if it is right, the fat will boil up when it is dropped in. . They should be turned over almost constantly, which causes them to rise and brown evenly. When they are sufficiently cooked, raise them from the hot fat, and drain them until they cease dripping. Cakes fried iii this way, if shortened with butter, are less likely to absorb fat than those shortened with lard. After fat has been used for frying doughnuts it should be set away to cool, when the sediment will sink and the lard may be removed in a clean cake. If very much scorched, clarify by boiling a few slices of raw potatoes in the lard. Never attempt to fry but a few doughnuts at a time, so that they can be easily turned. A mixture, two-thirds lard and one- third suet, is a wholesome fat for frying doughnuts, and less likely to soak the cake. HUCKLEBERRY GRIDDLE CAKES. 1 pint of milk. 2 teaspoonfnls baking powder. 2 eggs. ^ pint of huckleberries I tablespoonful brown sugar. I teaspoonful salt, li pints flour. Sift flour, salt, sugar, and powder; add well-beaten eggs, milk, and huckleberries. Mix into batter. Have griddle hot enough to form crust as soon as batter touches it. In order to prevent juice escaping from berries, turn quickly and form crust on other side of cake. Turn once more on each side to complete baking. Mi.ss Jessie Stewart, Woodbridge, N.J., U.S A.

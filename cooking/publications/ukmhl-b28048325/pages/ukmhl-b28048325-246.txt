Breakfast, Lumheon and Tea. 242 THE SCRAP-BAG. For Sudden Hoarseness. 0 Roast a lemon in the oven, turning now and then, that all sides may be equally cooked. It should not crack, or burst, but be soft all through. Just before going to bed take the lemon (which should be very hot), cut a piece from the top, and fill it with as much white sugar as it will hold. “ Chock-full—do you mean ? ” asked an old gentleman to whom I recommended the palatable remedy. “ If that is very full—pressed down, and running over— I mean chock-full! ” I replied. Eat all the sugar, filling the lemon with more, as you find it becoming acid. This simple remedy induces gentle perspiration, besides acting favorably uj)on the clogged membranes of the throat. I have known it to prove wonderfully efficacious in removing severe attacks of hoarsness. Another, And far less pleasant prescription, is a teaspoonful of vinegar made thick with common salt. Having myself been, in earlier years, more than once the grateful victim of its severely benevolent agency, I cannot but endorse the dose. But—try the lemon first.

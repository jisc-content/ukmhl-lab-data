Drain for a few minutes on a sieve ; dip in the beaten yolks, roll in the powdered cracker, and fry in plenty of lard. Drain and serve hot with lemon-sauce. They are very good. Sponge-Cake Fritters. 6 or 8 square (penny) j 4 eggs, whipped light, sponge-cakes. j i tablespoonful corn-starch I cup cream, boiling hot, wet up in cold milk, with a pinch of soda stirred ; pound currants, washed in. ; and dried. Pound the cakes fine, and pour the cream over them. Stir in the corn-starch. Cover for half an hour, then beat until cold. Add the yolks—light and strained, the whipped whites, then the currants thickly dredged with flour. Beat all hard together. Drop in spoonfuls into the boiling lard ; fry quickly ; drain upon a warmed sieve, and send to table hot. The syrup of brandied fruit makes an excellent sauce for these. Curd Friiters. 1 quart sweet milk. 2 glasses white wine. I teaspoonful liquid ren- net. 5 eggs, whipped light. 4 tablespoonfuls prepared flour. 2 tablespoonfuls powdered sugar. Nutmeg to taste. Scald the milk, and pour in the wine and rennet. Take from the fire, cover, and let it stand until curd and whey are well separated. Drain off every drop of the latter, and dry the curd by laying for a few minutes upon a soft, clean cloth. Beat yolks and sugar together, whip in the curd until fully mixed ; then the flour, nutmeg and whites. The batter should be smooth, and rather thick. Have ready some butter in a small frying-pan ; drop in the fritters a few at a time, and fry quickly. Drain upon a warm sieve, lay within a dish lined with white paper, or a clean napkin ; sift powdered sugar over them, and eat with jelly sauce. Odd as the receipt may seem in the reading, the fritters are most palatable. In the country, where milk is plenty, they may be made of cream—unless, as is too often the case, the goodwife will save all the cream for butter.

168 Breakfast, Luncheon and Tea. Coffee Cream Puffs. Make as above, but beat into the icing two tablespoonfuls of black coffee—as strong as can be made, and a little of this icing into the whipped cream. Chocolate Cream Puffs. Instead of coffee, season the cream and icing with two tablespoonfuls sweet chocolate, grated. That flavored with vanilla is best. If you have not this, add a little vanilla extract.

A little salt. 4 eggs—beaten light, i tablespoonful butter. ^ teaspoonful of soda, dis- solved in hot water.

These are delicate in texture and taste, and pleasing to the eye.

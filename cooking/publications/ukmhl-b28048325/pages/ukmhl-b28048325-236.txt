232 Breakfastf Luncheon and Tea. Noyau. ^ pound sweet almonds. Juice of 3 lemons, and grated peel of one. 2 pounds loaf sugar. 3 teaspoonfuls extract of bitter almonds. 2 tablespoonfuls clear honey. I pint best brandy. I tablespoonful orange- flower water. Blanch and pound the almonds, mixing the orange-flower water with them to prevent oiling. Add the sugar and brandy, and let these ingfredients lie together for two days, shaking the jug frequently. Put in the lemon, honey and flavoring; shake hard, and leave in the jug a week longer, shaking it every day. Strain through very fine muslin, bottle and seal. The flavor of this is delicious in custards, etc. As a beverage, it must be mixed with ice-water. Rose Syrup. pound of fresh rose- leaves. 2 pounds loaf sugar. Whites of 2 eggs, whipped light. I pint best brandy. I quart cold water. Boil the sugar and water to a clear syrup, beat in the whites of the eggs, and, when it has boiled up again well, take from the fire. Skim as it cools, and when a little more than blood-warm, pour it over half a pound of fresh rose- leaves. Cover it closely, and let it alone for twenty-four hours. Strain, and put in the second supply of leaves. On the third day put in the last half pound, and on the fourth, strain through a muslin bag. Add the brandy ; strain again through a double linen bag, shake well and bottle. This liqueur is delightful as a beverage, mixed with iced water, and invaluable where rose-flavor is desired for cus- tards, creams or icing. In the height of the rose-season, the requisite quantity of leaves may easily be procured. The receipt is nearly fifty years old. Orange Cream. 12 large, very sweet oranges. 2 pounds loaf sugar. I quart milk, warm from the cow. I quart best French brandy.

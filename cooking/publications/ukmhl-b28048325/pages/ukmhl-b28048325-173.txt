Stir the soda, dissolved in hot water, into the soaked rusk ; when they are cold, put in the custard. Pour the mixture into a buttered baking-dish—the same in which it is to be served—and bake in a brisk oven. It should puff up very light. Sift powdered sugar over the top and eat warm with sweet sauce. Cream sauce is particularly good with it.

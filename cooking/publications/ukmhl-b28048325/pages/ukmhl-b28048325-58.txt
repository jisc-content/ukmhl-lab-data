54 Breakfast, Luncheon and Tea. Venison or Mution Croquf.ites. Some slices of cold roast venison, or roast or boiled mut- ton—the lean only, if mutton be used—minced. One-fifth as much stale bread, crumbed fine. Some good gravy or drawn butter, thickened with browned fiour. Beaten egg for a liaison. A pinch of mace, a very little grated lemon-peel, and chopped parsley to taste. Some currant jelly, in the proportion of a small tea- spoonful to each cup of gravy. Stir the jelly well into the gravy, season and wet up with this the meat and crumbs, add the beaten egg, make into rolls, and flour these, or dip in egg and cracker-crunvbs before frying. A Nice Breakfast Dish May be made of these by piling them in the centre of a flat dish, within a wall, about two inches high, of mashed potato, moulded to fit the inside of the dish, and browned m the oven. You had best use the platter of a chafing- dish for this purpose, or one of stone china. You can, if you like, brush the “ wall ” over with beaten egg before set- ting in the oven. Have ready some good, brown gravy, witli a little currant jelly stirred into it; also, a small glass of claret. Thicken with browned flour, boil up once, and pour over the croquettes. Or, This is still nicer, if you add to the gravy some mushrooms, previously fried in butter, and chopped up. If you use these, you may, if you like, omit the potato wall, garnishing the pile instead, with triangles of fried bread. Fish Croquettes. •Some cold fish—boiled, baked or fried—from which all fat, bones and skin have been removed, chopped fine. One-third as much mashed potato, rubbed to a cream with a little melted butter. A little white sauce, made of butter “ drawn ” in milk and thickened with corn-starch, and a beaten egg. Chopped parsley, salt, pepper, and anchovy sauce, or walnut catsup, for seasoning. Mix all well together, make into balls, which may be rolled in flour, or in beaten egg, and then cracker-crumbs, before they are fried.

56 Breakfast, Luncheon and Tea. Not that from beef or mutton, as it spoils the flavor of the game. It is easy to reserve giblets for this dish by a little fore- sight, and in no other shape are they more useful. Veal and Ham Croquettes. Cold roast or stewed veal, the remnants of cutlets or chops, freed from bone, skin and gristle, and minced fine. Half the quantity of cold boiled ham. A little fat on a slice, now and then, is an improvement. Gravy or drawn butter thickened with browmed flour to moisten the meat. One-fourth as much fine bread-crumbs as you have meat. Yolks of one or two eggs, boiled hard and powdered, then beaten into the gravy. Season with chopped parsley and pepper. The ham usually supplies sufficient salt. Beaten egg and powdered cracker. Raw egg for the liaison. Mix veal and ham well together ; wet with the gravy and season before putting in the raw egg. Stir up well, but do not beat, and add the crumbs. Roll in egg and cracker, and fry. Mem. The fat in which croquettes are fried must be boiling, yet must not burn. Try a bit of the mixture before risking the well-being of your whole dish. Hominy Croquettes. 0 2 large cups of fine-grained hominy, boiled and cold. 2 eggs, well beaten. 2 tablespoonfuls melted butter. Salt to taste. Work the butter well into the hominy until the latter is smooth and soft, then the eggs, beating hard for two or three minutes with a wooden spoon, season, and make into balls or rolls with floured hands. Roll each in flour, and fry to a yellow-brown in sweet lard. Potato Croquettes. 0 2 cups mashed potato, cold and free from lumps. 2 eggs beaten to a froth. I tablespoonful melted buttr*. Salt and pepper to taste. 1 egg beaten in a separate vessel. I teacupful cracker-crumbs.

Preserved Fruit, Candies, etc. 239 Maple Svrup. 0 6 lbs. maple sugar—pure. | 6 large coffee cups of water. Break the sugar to pieces with a stone or hammer; cover with the water—cold—and let it stand until it is nearly, or quite melted. Put over the fire and bring to a gentle boil, leaving the kettle uncovered. Boil, ’without stirring, until it is a pretty thick sjTup. If possible, buy maple sugar direct from the “ sugar camps,” or their vicinity, and in large blocks. The pretty scolloped cakes offered by peanut vendors at treble the price of the genuine article, are largely adulterated with other substances. Peanut Candy. (Very nice) I scant pint of molassesi. 4 quarts of peanuts, mea- sured before they are shelled. 2 tablespoonfuls of va- nilla. I teaspoonful of soda. Boil the molasses until it hardens in cold water, when dropped from the spoon. Stir in the vanilla—then the soda, dr)'. Lastly, the shelled peanuts. Turn out into shallow pans well buttered, and press it down smooth with a wooden spoon. I can heartily recommend the candy made according to this receipt as being unrivalled of its kind. The molasses should be good in quality, and the peanuts freshly roasted. Dotty Dimple’s Vinegar Candy. 0 3 cups white sugar. | li cups clear vinegar. Stir the sugar into the vinegar until thoroughly dissolved ; heat to a gentle boil and stew, uncovered, until it ropes from the tip of the spoon. Turn out upon broad dishes, well buttered, and cool. So soon as you are able to handle it without burning your fingers, begin to pull it, using only the tips of your fingers. It can be “pulled” beautifully white and porous. Those who have read Sophie May’s delightful “ Little Prudy,” and “ Dotty Dimple ” series, will remember the famous “ vinegar candy.”

63 KIDNEYS, Although less liked generally, are yet esteemed a bontu bouche by the epicure whose appetite has been educated by what is commonly styled “fancy” cookery. They are cheaper than sweetbreads, and less difficult to keep, if less delicate in flavor. Fried Kidneys. 3 fine large kidneys—the fresher the better. 3 tablespoonfuls of butter, i cup of good brown gravy —veal, mutton or beef. A teaspoonful of chopped parsley, and half as much minced onion. Pepper and salt to taste. Skin the kidneys, and cut crosswise into round slices a quarter of an inch thick. Roll them in flour. Have ready in a fiying-pan the butter well seasoned with pepper, a little salt, the parsley and onion. When it begins to simmer over the fire, lay in evenly and carefully the slices of kidney. Fry gently for two minutes, turn, and let them fry as long on the other side, or until they are of a light brown. If cooked too much, or too fast, they become tough and tasteless. Re- move instantly from the frying-pan with an egg-beater or perforated skimmer, and arrange in order on a hot dish. Add to the gravy in the pan, a few tablespoonfuls of broth, thicken with browned flour, boil up once, and pour over the kidneys.

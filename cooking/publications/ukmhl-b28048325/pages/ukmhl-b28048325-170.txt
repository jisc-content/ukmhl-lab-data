Have ready small cups or muffin-rings, well buttered ; put the mi.\ture into them, and bake at once. In less than half an hour they should rise high in the pans. Test with a clean straw to see if they are done; turn out upon a hot dish, and serve with jelly sauce. These are almost sure to be a success if made with good prepared flour—Hecker’s, for example. In this case, use no soda. Jam Puffs. 3 eggs. Half a cup of sweet jam or jelly. The weight of the eggs in Hecker’s prepared flour. Half their weight in sugar and butter. Beat the eggs stiff, whites and yolks separately. Cream the butter and sugar, strain the yolks into the cream; beat well before putting in the whites. The flour should go in last.

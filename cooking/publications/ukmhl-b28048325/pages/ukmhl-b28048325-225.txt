Cakes. 221 every drop of fat; sift powdered sugar over the cakes while hot, and eat fresh. Genuine Scotch Short Bread. {Veryfine.) 2 pounds flour. I pound best butter. Scant ^ pound of sugar. Wash all particles of salt from the butter. Rub this and the sugar together to a cream, as for loaf cake. The flour should be dry and slightly warm. Mix this into the creamed butter and sugar gently and gradually with the hand, until all the ingredients are thoroughly incorporated. The longer it is kneaded the better it will be. Lay it on a pasteboard, and press into sheets nearly half an inch thick with the hand, as rolling has a tendency to toughen. Cut into such shapes as you may desire—into oblong, or square cards ; prick or stamp a pattern on top (I have seen the Scotch thistle pricked upon it) and bake in a moderate oven until it is crisp, and of a fine yellow brown. It delights me to be able to make public this receipt, for the excellent housewife and friend, from whom I have pro- cured it, is a native of the “ land o’ cakes,” and, as I can testify from repeated and satisfactory proofc thereof, makes the most delicious “ short bread ” that was ever eaten in this country—quite another thing from the rank, unctuous compound vended under that name by professional bakers and confectioners.

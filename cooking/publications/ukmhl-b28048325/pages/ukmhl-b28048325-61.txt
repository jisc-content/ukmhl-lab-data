Croquettes, 57 Mix as you do hominy croquettes, roll in egg and cracker, and fry in boiling lard. Take up as soon as they are done, and drain perfectly dry. This is an excellent preparation of potato, and par- ticularly acceptable at breakfast or luncheon. Rice Croquettes. 0 2 cups cold boiled rice. 2 tablespoonfuls melted butter. 3 eggs, beaten light. A little flour. 1 raw egg and half a cup of powdered cracker. 2 tablespoonfuls white sugar. A large pinch of finelygrated lemon-peel, and salt to taste. Beat eggs and sugar together until light, and work the butter well into the rice. Next, stir up with this the beaten eggs. Season and make into croquettes of whatever shape you may fancy. They are pretty moulded into the form of pears, with a clove blossom, end outward, at the large end, and the stalk of another projecting from the small, to repre- sent the pear-stem. You may find it advisable to use a little flour in working the rice paste, but be careful not to get it too stiff, in which event the croquette, of w’hatever com- posed, ceases to be a delicacy. Roll in flour, then in the beaten egg, lastly in the powdered cracker, and fry, a few at a time, in sweet lard or butter. Rice croquettes are sometimes eaten, with powdered sugar sprinkled thickly over them, as a dessert, or sweet sauce is served with them. They are delicious when pro- perly mixed and cooked.

Fancy Dishes for Dessert. 141 cake, moistened with wine and spread with jam ; more macaroons, and so on, until the dish is three-quarters full. Pour the cold custard over all ; beat the whites of the eggs stiff with a few spoonfuls of bright jelly, and heap smoothly on top. Drop a bit of red jelly here and there upon it. Strawberry Trifle 0 This is made substantially as above—but the macaroons and wine are omitted, and the sponge cake wet with sw’cet cream. Layers of ripe strawberries (cut in two, if the fruit is large), sprinkled with powdered sugar, are substituted for the jam ; strawberry-juice, well sweetened, is whipped into the 7ndringue on top, and this ornamented w'ith ripe, scarlet berries. This is very nice. Creme du The. {Good.) I pint rich cream, whipped light. ^ package gelatine, soaked in I cup of milk. I large cup of strong mi.xcd tea—the best quality. I cup white sugar. Whites of two eggs. Dissolve the soaked gelatine and sugar in the boiling tea, when you have strained the latter through fine muslin, and let it cool. Whip the cream and the whites of the eggs in separate vessels. When the gelatine is perfectly cold, beat it by degrees into the whites until it is a pretty finn froth. Then whip in the cream. Rinse a mould in cold water, fill it with the mixture, and set in a very cold place, or on ice, for eight or ten hours. Send round a pitcher of sweet cream with it Creme du Cafe. Is made precisely as the cremd du th^, but substituting a large cup of strong black coffee for the tea. It is even more popular than the tea-cream. It is a good plan to make both at the same time, one package of gelatine serving for all, and give your guests their choice of tea or coffee. If set to form in custard-cups and turned out upon a flat dish in alternate rows, they make a handsome show. The darker color of the coffee will dis- tinguish it from the tea. A small pitcher of sweet cream should accompany them.

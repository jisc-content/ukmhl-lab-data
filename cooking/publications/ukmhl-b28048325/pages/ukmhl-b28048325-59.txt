Croquettes, 5 5 Send around sliced lemon with these, which are not good unless eaten hot These are, as will be seen, a modification of the well- known and time-honored “ fish-ball,” but, if properly made, will be found much better. Croquettes of Lobster or Crab. 0 Meat of one fine lobster, or six crabs well boiled. 2 eggs. 2 tablespoonfuls of butter. ^ cup fine bread-cnimbs. I teaspoonful anchovy sauce. Yolks of two eggs, boiled hard and rubbed to a pow- der, then beaten into the butter. I good teaspoonful lemon- juice. Season well with salt and cayenne pepper; also a pinch of mace and lemon-peel. Yolks of two raw eggs, beaten very light. Mince the meat, work in the butter—melted, but not hot; then the seasoning, the raw eggs, and lastly, the bread- crumbs. Make into oblong balls, and fry quickly in sweet lard, dripping, or half lard, half butter. Drain them of every drop of fat by rolling each, for an instant, very lightly upon a hot, clean cloth. Be sure your dish is well heated. These are very delicious, and should be accompanied by milk or cream crackers, with slices of lemon passed to such guests as would like the additional relish. Croquettes of Game. 0 Remains of cold grouse, quail, etc. Giblets of the same, or of poultry, boiled and cold. Gravy. One-fourth the quantity of fine bread-crumbs that you have of meat. Season with pepper and salt. Raw egg, beaten, for bind- ing the mixture together, also some in a separate vessel for coating the cro- quettes. Fine cracker-crumbs. Mince the meat, and pound the giblets in a Wedgewood mortar, when you have removed skin and cartilage from the gizzards. Moisten with gravy as you pound, until all are smooth. Mix into this the raw egg and seasoning, then the meat, lastly the bread-crumbs. Mould, dip in egg, then in cracker-powder and fry in boiling fat. The drip- ping from roast poultry may be used for this purpose. E 2

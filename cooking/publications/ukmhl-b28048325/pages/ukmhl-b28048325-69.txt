65 Kidneys. Stewed Kidneys. -V 3 kidneys. 3 tablespoonfuls melted butter Juice of half a lemon, and a pinch of grated lemon- peel. A very little mace, and pepper and salt to taste. I teaspoonful chopped onion. I cup good brown gravy. Cut each kidney lengthwise into three pieces ; wash these well and wipe dry. Warm the butter in a frying pan ; put in the kidneys before this is really hot, with the seasoning and gravy. Simmer all together, closely covered, about ten minutes. Add the lemon-juice ; take up the kidneys and lay upon a hot dish, with fried or toasted bread underneath. Thicken the gravy with browned flour, boil up once, pour over all, and serve. Kidneys a la Brochette. 4 kidneysâ€”those of me- dium size are preferable to large. 2 great spoonfuls of butter. I great spoonful chopped parsley, onion, and very fine bread-crumbs. Juice of half a lemon. Pepper and salt to taste. Split the kidneys lengthwise, but not quite through, leav- ing enough meat and skin at one side to act as a sort of hinge. Rub them well inside with melted butter, and lay them open, as you would small birds, the back downward, upon a buttered gridiron, over a bright fire. They should be done in about eight minutes. Turn often while broiling. Have ready the stuffing of crumbs, parsley, onion, and butter, w'ell seasoned. Heat in a saucepan, stirring until smoking hot. Add the lemon-juice ; dish the kidneys, put some of this mixture inside of each, close the two sides upon it, butter and pepper them, and serve. A few bits of fat salt pork, minced very fine, gives a good flavour to the stuffing. The pork should have been pre- viously cooked.

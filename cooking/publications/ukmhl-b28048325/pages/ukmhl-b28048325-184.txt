Butter a large mould very well; put in the mixture, leaving room for the swelling of the pudding, and boil five hours steadily. If the boiling should intermit one minute, there will be a heavy streak in the pudding. Six hours’ boiling will do no harm. Turn out upon a hot dish ; pour brandy over it and light iust as it goes into the dining-room. Eat with rich sauce. I know of no other pudding of equal excellence that can be made with so little trouble as this, and is as apt to “ turn out well.” If you have no mince-meat in the house, you can buy an admirable article, ready made, at any first-class grocery store. It is put up in neat wooden cans (which are stanch and useful for holding eggs, starch, etc., after the mince- meat is used up) and bears the stamp, “ Atmore’s Cele- BR.ATED Mince-Meat.” And what is noteworthy, it deserves to be “ celebrated.” It has never been my good fortune to meet with any other made mince-meat that could compare with it. Lemon Souffle Pudding. 1 heaping cup of prepared flour. 2 cups of rich milk. i cup of butter. Juice of I lemon and half the grated peel. Chop the butter into the flour. Scald the milk and stir into it while still over the fire, the flour and butter. When it begins to thicken, add it, gradually, to the beaten yolks and sugar. Beat all up well and turn out to cool in a broad dish. It should be cold when you whip in the stiffened whites. Butter a mould; pour in the mixture, leaving abundance of room for the souffle to earn its name—and steam one hour and a half, keeping the water under the steamer at a fast, hard boil. When done, dip it into cold water for an instant, let it stand one minute, after you take it out of this, and turn out upon a hot dish. Eat with brandy sauce. 4 tabiespoontuis ot su- gar. 5 —whites and yolks beaten separately and very light

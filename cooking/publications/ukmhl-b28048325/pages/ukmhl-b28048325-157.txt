Claret Jelly. 0 1 package Coxe’s gelatine, soaked in large cup water. 2 cups sugar. 2 cups fine claret. I pint boiling water. I lemon—the juice only. A pinch of mace. Make as you would other wine jelly. It is most refreshing in summer. Note upon Jellies. It must be borne in mind that the consistency of jelly de- pends much upon the weather. In warm or damp, it is sometimes difficult to make it either clear or firm. I have tried to guard against failure in the use of any of the fore- going receipts by setting down the minimum quantity of liquid that can be used without making the jellies too stiff. If made in clear, cold weather, there will be no risk in hav- ing the “ large cup of cold water,” in which the gelatine is soaked, one-third larger than if the jelly were undertaken on a murky spring day. A little experience will teach you how to guard this point. Meanwhile, be assured that you need not fear splashing, weak jellies where you hoped for firmness and brilliancy, if you follow the directions written down in this department.

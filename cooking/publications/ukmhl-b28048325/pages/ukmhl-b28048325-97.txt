Wet an oblong mould (a baking-pan used for “brick” loaves of bread will do) with cold water, and put a thin layer of the congealing jelly in the bottom. Upon this lay the tongue, bearing in mind that what is the bottom now will be the top when the jelly is turned out. Encircle it with a linked chain made of rings of white of egg, or, if you prefer, let the rings barely touch one another, and fit in the centre of each a round of bright pickled beet. The effect of this is very pretty. Fill up the mould with jelly; cover and set in a cold place for twelve hours. This is a beautiful show-piece for luncheon or supper, and when it has served the end of its creation in this respect, can easily be carved with a sharp knife and remain, even in partial ruin, a thing of beauty. GRAVY. “ Presiding over an establishment like this makes sad havoc with the features, my dear Miss Pecksniffs,” said Mrs. Tod- gers. “ The gravy alone is enough to add twenty years to one’s age. The anxiety of that one item, my dears, keeps the mind continually upon the stretch.” Without following the worthy landlady further into the depths of her dissertation upon the fondness of commercial gentlemen for the “ item,” I would answer a question ad- dressed to me by a correspondent who “believes”—she is so kind as to inform me—“in Common Sense.” “ I notice that many of your made dishes are dependent for savoriness upon ‘ a cup of good broth,’ or, ‘ half a cup of strong gravy.’ Let me ask, in the spirit of sincere desire for useful information, where is the gravy or broth to come from?” In return I plagiarize the words of a lady who accomplishes more with less noise and fretting than any other person I ever saw. “ I don’t see how you find time for it all! ” exclaimed an admiring visitor.

Breakfast, Luncheon and Tea. 234 FLAVORING EXTRACTS. The peel of 6 lemons. Lemon. I quart white whisky or brandy. Cut the rind into thin shreds ; half fill three or four wide- mouthed bottles with it, and pour the spirits upon it. Cork tightly, and shake now and then for the first month. This will keep for years, and be better for age. It has this advan- tage over the distilled extract sold in the stores—country- stores especially, lemon extract being especially liable to spoil if kept for a few months, and tasting, when a little old, unfortunately like spirits of turpentine. Orange. Prepare as you would lemon-peel. Put into small bottles. It is said to be an excellent stomachic taken in the propor- tion of a teaspoonful to a glass of iced water, and slightly sweetened. It is very nice for flavoring the icing of orange cake. Vanilla. 2 vanilla beans. | i pint white whisky. Split the bean, and clip with your scissors into bits, scrap- ing out the seeds which possess the finest flavoring qualities. Put the seed and husks into the bottom of a small bottle ; fill up with the spirits, and cork tightly. Shake it often for a few weeks, after which it will be fit for use—and nei>cr spoil. Bitter Almond. ^ pound of bitter almonds. | i pint white whisky. Blanch the almonds, and shred (not pound them), using for this purpose a sharp knife that will not bruise the kernels. Put them into a wide-mouthed bottle; pour in the spirits.

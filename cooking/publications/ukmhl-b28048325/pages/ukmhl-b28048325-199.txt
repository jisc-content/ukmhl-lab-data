Ripe Fruit. 195 apples, pared and cored, but not sliced. Make a syrup of one cup of water, and half as much sugar; stir until the sugar is dissolved, and pour over the apples. Cover closely, and bake slowly until tender. Draw from the oven, and let the apples cool without uncovering. Pour off the syrup, and fill the hollowed centres with some bright fniit jelly. Boil down the syrup fast, until quite thick, and, just before sending the apples to table, stir into it some rich cream sweetened very abundantly. Pass with the apples. Boiled Chestnuts. Put into warm (not hot) water, slightly salted, bring to a boil, and cook fast fifteen minutes. Turn off the water through a cullender ; stir a good piece of butter into the hot chestnuts, tossing them over and over until they are glossy and dr)’. Serve upon a hot napkin in a deep dish. Walnuts .■vnd Hickory Nuts. Crack and pick from the shells ; sprinkle salt lightly over them, and serve mixed in the same dish. Black walnuts are much more wholesome when eaten with salt.

Eat with sugar, or with mixed pepper and salt.

i8 Breakfast, Luncheon and Tea. Fricasseed Eggs. 0 6 hard-boiled eggs. When cold, slice with a sharp knife, taking care not to break the yolk. I cup good broth, well sea- soned with pepper, salt, pars- ley and a suspicion of onion. .Some rounds stale bread, fried to a liglit-brown in but- ter or nice dripping. Put the broth on the fire in a saucepan with the seasoning and let it come to a boil. Rub the slices of egg with melted butter, then roll them in flour. Lay them gently in the' gp'avy, and let this become smoking hot upon the side of the range, but do not let it actually boil, lest the eggs should break. They should lie thus in the gravy for at least five minutes. Have ready, upon a platter, the fried bread. Lay the sliced egg evenly upon this, pour the gravy over all, and serve hot.

Fry them to a light brown in the butter or dripping, turning each piece as it is done on the under side. Do not let them lie in the frying-pan an instant after they are cooked. Drain free from fat before laying them on a hot dish. Pour the gravy, boiling hot, over the eggs, and send to table.

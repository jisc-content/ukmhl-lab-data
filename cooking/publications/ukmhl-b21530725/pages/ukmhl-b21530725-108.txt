100 THE FRUGAL boil again, and thickened with half a pint of rye and water stirred up quite thick, and a little mo- lasses; boil it a minute or two, and then take it off to cool. When just about lukewarm, put in a cupful of good lively yeast, and set it in a cool place in summer, and warm place in winter. If it is too warm when you put in the old yeast, all the spirit will be killed. In summer, yeast sours easily; therefore make but little at a time. Bottle it when it gets well a working; it keeps better when the air is corked out. If you find it acid, but still spirited, put a little pearlash to it, as you use it; but by no means put it into your bread unless it foams up bright and lively as soon as the pearlash mixes with it. Never keep yeast in tin; it. destroys its life. There is another method of making yeast, which is much easier, and I think quite as good. Stir rye and cold water, till you make a stiff thicken- ing. Then pour in boiling water, and stir it all the time, till you make it as thin as the yeast you buy; three or four tablespoons heaped full are enough for a quart of water. When it gets about cold, put in half a pint of lively yeast. When it works well, bottle it; but if very lively, do not cork your bottle vcry tight, for fear it will burst. Always think to make new yeast' before the old is gone; so that you may have some to work with. Always wash and scald your bottle clean after it has contained sour yeast. Beware of freezing yeast.

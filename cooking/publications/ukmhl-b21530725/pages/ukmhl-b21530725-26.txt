18 THE FRUGAL eggs, at the time they are cheapest, to be put down for winter use. You will be likely to get them cheaper and better than in the market; but by all means put down your winter's stock. Lard requires no other care than to be kept in a dry, cool place. Butter is sweetest in September and June; because food is then plenty, and not rendered bitter by frost. Pack your butter in a clean scalded firkin, cover it with strong brine, and spread a cloth all over the top, and it will keep good. If you happen to have a bit of salt- petre, dissolve it with the brine. Dairy-women say that butter comes more easily, and has a peculiar hardness and sweetness, if the cream is scalded and strained before it is used. The cream should stand down the cellar over night, after being scalded, that it may get perfectly cold. Suet and lard keep better in tin than in earthen. Suet keeps good all the year round, if chopped and packed down in a stone jar, covered with molasses. Pick suet free from veins and skin, melt it in water before a moderate fire, let it cool till it forms into a hard cake, then wipe it dry, and put it in clean paper in linen bags. Preserve the backs of old letters to write upon. If you have children who are learning to write, Buy coarse white paper by the quantity, and keep it locked up, ready to be made into writing books. It does not cost half as much as it does to buy them at the stationerâ€™s.

103 HOUSEWIFE. CURRANT JELLY. Currant jelly is a useful thing for sickness. It it be necessary to wash your currants, be sure they are thoroughly drained, or your jelly will be thin. Break them up with a pestle, find squeeze them through a cloth. Put a pint of clean sugar to a pint of juice, and boil it slowly, till it be- comes ropy. Great care must be taken not to do it too fast; it is spoiled by being .scorched. It should be frequently skimmed while simmer- ing. If currants are put in a jar, and kept in boiling water, and cooked before they are strained, they are more likely to keep a long time without fermenting. CURRANT WINE. Those who have more currants than they have money will do well to use no wine but of their own manufacture. Break and squeeze the cur- rants, put three pounds and a half of sugar to two quarts of juice and two quarts of water. Put in a keg or barrel. Do not close the bung tight for three or four days, that the air may escape while it is fermenting. After it is done ferment- ing, close it up tight. Where raspberries are plenty, it is a great improvement to use half raspberry juice, and half currant juice. Brandy is unnecessary vyhen the above mentioned pro- portions are observed. It should not be used under a year or two. Age improves it.

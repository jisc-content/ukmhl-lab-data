THE FRUGAL no mutton is called the chop. Mutton chop is con- sidered very good for broiling. Pigâ€™s head is a profitable thing to buy. It is despised because it is cheap ; but when well cooked it is delicious. Well cleaned, the tip of the snout chopped off, and put in brine a week, it is very good for boiling: the cheeks, in par- ticular, are very sweet; they are better than any other pieces of pork to bake. The head is like- wise very good baked about an hour and a half. It tastes like roast pork, and yields abundance of sweet fat for shortening. COMMON COOKING. It is necessary to be very careful of fresh meat in the summer season. The moment it is brought into the house, it should be carefully covered from the flies, and put in the coldest place in the cellar. If it consist of pieces, they should be spread out separate from each other, on a large dish, and covered. If you are not to cook it soon, it is well to sprinkle salt on it. The kid- ney, and fat flabby parts, should be raised up above the lean by a skewer, or stick, and a little salt strewn in. If you have to keep it over night, it should be looked to the last thing when you go to bed; and, if there is danger, it should be scalded.

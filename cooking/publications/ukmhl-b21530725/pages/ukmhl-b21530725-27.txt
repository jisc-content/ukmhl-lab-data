19 HOUSEWIFE. Do not let coffee and tea stand in tin. Scald your wooden ware often; and keep your tin ware dry. When mattresses get hard and bunchy, rip them, take the hair out, pull it thoroughly by hand, let it lie a day or two to air, wash the tick, lay it in as light and even as possible, and catch it down as before. Thus prepared, they will be as good as new. It is poor economy to buy vinegar by the gallon. Buy a barrel, or half a barrel, of really strong vinegar, when you begin housekeeping. As you use it, fill the barrel with old cider, sour beer, or wine settlings, &c. left in pitchers, de- canters, or tumblers; weak tea is likewise said to be good : nothing; is hurtful which has a toler- able portion of spirit, or acidity. Care must be taken not to add these things in too large quan- tities, or too often: if the vinegar once gets weak, it. is difficult to restore it. If possible, it is well to keep such slops as I have mentioned in a different keg, and draw them off once in three or four weeks, in such a quantity as you think the vinegar will bear. If by any carelessness you do weaken it, a few white beans dropped in, or white paper dipped in molasses, is said to be useful. If beer grows sour, it may be used to advantage for pancakes and fritters. If very sour indeed, put a pint of molasses and water to it, and, two or three days after, put a half pint of vinegar; and in ten days it will be first rate vinegar.

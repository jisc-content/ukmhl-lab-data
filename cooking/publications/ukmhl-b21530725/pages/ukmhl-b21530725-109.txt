10L HOUSEWIFE. Milk yeast is made quicker than any other. A pint of new milk with a teaspoonful of salt, and a large spoon of flour stirred in, set by the tire to keep lukewarm, will make yeast fit for use in an hour. Twice the quantity of common yeast is necessary, and unless used soon is good for nothing. Bread made of this yeast drie6 sooner. It is convenient in summer, when one wants to make biscuits suddenly. A species of leaven may be made that will keep any length of time. Three ounces of hops in a pail of water boiled down to a quart; strain it, and stir in a quart of rye meal while boiling hot. Cool it, and add half a pint of good yeast; after it has risen a few hours, thicken it with flour stiff enough to roll out upon a board; then put it in the sun and air a few days to dry. A piece of this cake two inches square, dissolved in warm water, and thickened with a little flour, will make a large loaf of bread. Potatoes make very good yeast. Mash three large potatoes fine; pour a pint of boiling water over them ; when almost cold, stir in two spoon- fuls of flour, two of molasses, and a cup of good yeast. This yeast should be used while new. K 2

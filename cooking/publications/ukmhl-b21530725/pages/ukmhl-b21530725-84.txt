THE FRUGAL* 76 FISH. Con has white stripes, and a haddock black stripes; they may be known apart by this. Had- dock is the best for frying; and cod is the best for boiling. A thin tail is a sign of a poor fish; always choose a thick fish. When you are buying mackerel, pinch the belly to ascertain whether it is good. If it gives under your finger, like a bladder half filled with wind, the fish is poor; if it feels hard like butter, the fish is good. It is cheaper to buy one large mackerel for nine-pence, than two at four-pence half-penny. Fish should not be put in to fry until the fat is boiling hot; it is very necessary to observe this. It should be dipped in flour before it is put in ; and the skinny side uppermost, when first put in, to prevent its breaking. It relishes better to be'fried after salt pork, than to be fried in lard alone. People are mistaken, who think fresh fish should be put into cold water as soon as it is brought into the house; soaking it in water is injurious. If you want to keep it sweet, clean it, wash it, wipe it dry with a clean towel, sprinkle salt inside and out, put it in a covered dish, and keep it on the cellar floor until yoit want to cook it. If yon live remote from the seaport, and cannot get fish w hile hard and fresh, vTet it with an egg beaten, before you flour it, to prevent its breaking.

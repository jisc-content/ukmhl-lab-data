THE FRUGAL 102 PRESERVES, ETC. Economical people will seldom use preserves, except for sickness. They are unhealthy, ex- pensive, and useless to those who are well. Barberries preserved in molasses are very good for common use. Boil the molasses, skim it, throw in the barberries, and simmer them till they are soft. If you wish to lay by a few for sickness, preserve them in sugar by the same rule as other preserves. Melt the sugar, skim it, throw in thp' barberries; when done soft, take them out, and throw in others. A pound of sugar to a pound of fruit is the rule for all preserves. The sugar should be melted over a fire moderate enough not to scorch it'. When melted, it should be skimmed clean, and the fruit dropped in to simmer till it is soft. Plums, and things of which the skin is liable to be broken, do better to be put in little jars, with their weight of sugar, and the j^rs set in a kettle of boiling water, till the fruit is done. See the water is not so high as to boil into the jars. When you .put preserves in jars, lay a white paper, thoroughly wet with brandy, flat upon the * surface of the preserves, and cover them carefully from the air. If they begin to mould, scald them by setting them in the oven till boiling hot. Glass is much better than earthen for preserves; they are not half as apt to fermetft.

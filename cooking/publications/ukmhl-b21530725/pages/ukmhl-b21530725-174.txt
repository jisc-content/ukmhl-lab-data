Many might have been, many may be, saved from the dreadful death by fire— can the science and humanity of the age be ex- erted in a better cause, or one more neglected?— When a fire happens, put it out in its earliest stage; if suffered to extend itself, give the alarm. Beware of opening doors, &c. to increase the fire by fresh air. Muster the whole family—see that none are missing—try to be as collected as possible. First save lives, then property. Think of the ways of escape; by the stairs if no better way—creep along a room where the fire is, and creep down stairs backwards on hands and knees (heated air ascends)—come down stairs with a pillow before your face and a wet blanket round the body, and hold your breath—or try the roof of the adjoining house. Throw out of the window a feather-bed to leap upon in the last extremity —fasten fire-escapes to the bed-posts first—send children down by a sack fastened to a rope, taking care of the iron spikes and area—then lower yourselves. When a fire happens, let every respectable neighbour attend. (He will protect and save both lives and property; and the state of the fire police will be publicly known, felt, and the evil remedied.)

Look for the nearest fire-plug—send instantly for all the watchmen, constables, and beadles

THE FRUGAL 9(5 after you have put milk enough for the cakes you wish to mike (a half pint, or more), stir in flour till it is thick enough to pour for fritters. It does very well without an egg ; but better with one. To be fried like other flat-jacks. Sugar and nutmeg are to be put on when they are but- tered, if you like. SHORT CAKE. If you have sour milk, or butter-milk, it is well to make it into short cakes for tea. Hub in a very small bit of shortening, or three tablespoon- fuls of cream, with the flour; put in a teaspoonful of strong dissolved pearlash into your sour milk, and mix your cake pretty stiff, to bake in the griddle, on a few embers. When people have to buy butter and lard, short cakes are not economical food. A half pint of flour w ill make a cake large enough to cover a common plate. Rub in thoroughly a bit of shortening as big as a hen’s egg: put in a tea- spoonful of dissolved pearlash ; wet it w’ith cold water; knead it stiff enough to roll well, to bake on a plate, or in a griddle. It should bake as quick as it can, and not burn. The first side should stand longer to the fire than the last.

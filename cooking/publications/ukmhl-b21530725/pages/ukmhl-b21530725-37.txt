Goose grease, or any kind of oily grease, is as good as bearâ€™s oil. Equal parts of camphor, spirits of wine, and hartshorn, well mixed, and rubbed upon the throat, is said to be good for the croup. Cotton wool and oil are the best things for a burn. A poultice of wheat bran, or rye bran, and vinegar, very soon takes down the inflammation occasioned by a sprain. Brown paper, wet, is healing to a bruise. Dipped in molasses, it is said to take down inflammation. In case of any scratch, or wound, from which the lock-jaw is apprehended, bathe the injured part freely with lye, or pearlash and water. A rind of pork bound upon a wound occa- sioned by a needle, pin, or nail, prevents the lock-jaw. It should be always applied. Spirits of turpentine is good to prevent the lock-jaw. Strong soft soap, mixed with pulverized chalk, about as thick as batter, put in a thin cloth or bag upon the wound, is said to be a preventive to this dangerous disorder. The chalk should be kept moist, till the wound begins to discharge itself; when the patient will find relief. If you happen to cut yourself slightly w'hile cooking, bind on some fine salt: molasses is likewise good. D 2

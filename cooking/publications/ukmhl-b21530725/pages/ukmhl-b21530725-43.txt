Elixir proprietatis is a useful family medicine for all cases when the digestive powers are out of order. One ounce of saffron, one ounce of myrrh, and one ounce of aloes. Pulverize them ; let the myrrh steep in half a pint of brandy, or rum, for four days ; then add the saffron and aloes: let it stand in the sunshine, or in some warm place, for a fortnight; taking care to shake it well twice a day. At the end of the fortnight, till up the bottle (a common sized one) with brandy, or rum, and let it stand a month. Tt costs six times as much to buy it in small quan- tities, as it does to make it.

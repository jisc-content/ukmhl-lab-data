152 Deferred Payment System In conclusion, it may not be out of place to mention this system which has proved, and cannot fail to prove, a boon to those whose capital is very limited or non-existent. By it furniture may be bought in any quantity and paid for in easy instalments, usually monthly. Those who intend furnishing on this system should be sure and deal only with well established houses of good reputation, such as Oetz- mann’s, of Hampstead Road, and they will be courteously and honourably dealt with. Unknown firms may offer alluring terms, which, if accepted, almost invariably lead to bitter disappointment and a wholesale condemnation of a very useful and convenient system. I should add that all the suites, the names of which I have given in the foregoing pages, may be seen in Messrs. Oetzmann’s showrooms.

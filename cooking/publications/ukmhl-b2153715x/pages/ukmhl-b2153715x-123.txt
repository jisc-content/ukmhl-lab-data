Now, having furnished our house, the next thing is to keep it “ neat, sweet, and in apple-pie order.” With the means at command, only one servant, or at most, if there are many little children, a servant and a nurse girl, will be kept. Some of the work must of necessity fall upon the shoulders of the housewife herself. This is one reason why flats are preferable to houses for people of small means ; there is less to do, and consequently more time to do it in. The training of the maid of all work is all-important. A Specimen Day. The housewife should map out the day for herself like this :— Early tea at 7 o’clock or 7.30. Bath and toilet. Breakfast at 8 or 8.30, or earlier, according to the time that the husband has to be at his office, which may be 8.45, 9, 9.30, or even 10. The breakfast hour, therefore, must be regulated according to special requirements. After breakfast dust drawing-room; arrange flowers; plan the meals for the remainder of the day and the next day’s breakfast, writing them out plainly, having first gone into larder and inspected all the food carefully, and made notes of what is required. Help with bedrooms. Dress. Go out and do shopping. Come back to lunch. Then rest for half-an-hour at least; the remainder of the day would then be the housewife’s own, free for mending, dressmaking, paying calls, &c. If there are children, her day would have to be ordered something like this :— Early tea at 7 o’clock. Bath, toilet and dress. If there is a small baby, he would have his morning bottle before his mother has her tea, or while she has it. Wash and dress baby. Have breakfast. Dust drawing-room, &c. J>9

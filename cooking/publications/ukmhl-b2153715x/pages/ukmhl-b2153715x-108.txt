CHAPTER V 104 Furniture for a Small Country House Some advantages—Wall-papers and paint—Carpets—The dining- room— The drawing-room. Some Advantages. Greater simplicity is possible in the country than in town. Things keep fresh longer, and do not require so many periodical visits to laundress or cleaner; carpets can be beaten at home in the garden; callers will be fewer ; and in a variety of ways it is possible to effect small savings. In the preceding chapter I have tried to show you how a flat may be furnished at the lowest possible cost; now let us see what can be done with a country cottage, or a suburban villa, assuming that not quite so much money is available.

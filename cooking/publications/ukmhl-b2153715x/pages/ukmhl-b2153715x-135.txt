Tidy Habits If coffee is served afterwards, the maid should take this in. It can be made while the dinner is in progress, and the little coffee-tray and black coffee-cups should be placed in readiness when the dinner table is laid. A pretty long coffee-tray may be bought for from 2s. nd., and the little black coffee-cups cost 4fd. each. A tiny little milk jug and sugar basin cost is. It is all these small things which, though they are inexpensive and perhaps not very important in themselves, go to make up the sum of dainty housekeeping. Tidy Habits. After dinner the things must be cleared away and washed up as directed. The maid should have her own supper before washing up, then there will be nothing left unwashed for the morning. Next the kitchen must be tidied ; then the bedrooms visited, the slops emptied, and the water jugs filled. If everything is done methodically all work should be over by nine o’clock, and the maid should have a full quiet hour to herself before bedtime. Tuesday’s routine should be exactly the same, except that the mistress’s bedroom should receive its weekly turning-out.

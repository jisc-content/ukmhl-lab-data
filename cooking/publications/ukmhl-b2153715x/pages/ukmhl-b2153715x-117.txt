CHAPTER VIII 113 H The Nurseries General hints— The day nursery j its furniture— The night nursery— Night and day nursery co?nbined — Nursery crockery ware— Soiled linen. General Hints. Whenever possible there should be a night and a day nursery ; but in small houses, or in the average London flat, this is not always practicable. I therefore give a scheme for a night and day nursery combined as well. The floors of both night and day nurseries should be entirely covered with a cork carpet, in a dull tone of sage green; and no rugs, except perhaps a hearthrug, should be allowed in the rooms, as a crawling rug can always be put down. Cork carpet costs 2s. per square yard, and a square size, 3 yds. by 2 yds., may be had for 11s. 6d. The walls should be papered with a sanitary washing paper. The “ Curly Locks ” design is as pretty and as artistic as any, and it costs but is. 3d. per piece. The curtains should be a dark blue art cotton, with a printer’s design of sage green fleur-de-lys. This material is the very best for keeping out light when the little ones want a nap. The Day Nursery. Choose a room with a bright sunny aspect if possible, and let all the paint be white or ivory. Everything surrounding children should be as bright and cheerful as it can be made, and as light in tone as possible. Its Furniture. A good solid wooden table, standing squarely upon its four legs, should be the principal piece of furniture. This will cost 12s. 6d.,and the top should be covered with white American cloth. A good-sized toy cupboard will be a necessity as the little ones grow out of early babyhood, and this, in strong bamboo, with lock and key, costs £1, 5s. ; a rocking-chair, 4s. 9d.; a high baby-chair, 8s. 6d. ; and an Austrian bentwood chair for each child, price 2s. each, with a child’s arm-chair to match, price 4s. 6d., will be all the furniture necessary, with perhaps a small additional table for needlework,

To Roast. WIPE the joint well with a damp cloth, and then with a dry one lightly. Rub a couple of heaped tablespoonfuls of dripping in the baking dish; sprinkle the joint with a little salt. Place it in the baking tin, and put two or three pieces of dripping each about the size of a very large walnut on the top of the joint. Put the baking tin in the hottest part of the oven, shut the door, and leave it for ten minutes. Then draw it to a cooler part, or else put it on a lower shelf, baste it thoroughly, and continue to baste it every ten minutes. If the joint is a very small and lean one, baste it once every six or eight minutes. As soon as the joint is done, take it out of the baking tin and dish it up on a very hot dish. Pour off the fat from the gravy into a dripping bowl. The residue of the gravy will stay behind. Add a little water to this, and a tiny pinch of salt. Then work it about with the point of a knife over the fire until it boils. Pour it over the joint and send to table. If the joint is to be baked in a Dutch oven in front of the fire, place the oven close to the fire for the first ten minutes, then draw it back a little way, and baste as directed. Time Required. To roast a joint to perfection, weigh it carefully first, and then reckon out the time necessary for cooking it as follows :— Beef. Allow fifteen minutes to the lb., and fifteen minutes over, if it is liked underdone. If to be well done, allow twenty minutes to the lb., and twenty minutes over. Mutton. This should always be well done. Allow twenty minutes to the lb., and twenty minutes over. If liked extra well done, a minute or so longer may be allowed.

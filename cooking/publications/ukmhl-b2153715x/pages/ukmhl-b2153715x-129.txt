Rinse them in clean hot water, and dry on a soft cloth. Then put away in the plate basket. Clean between the prongs carefully. To Wash Plates and Dishes. First scrape off all the bits with a knife. If there is a cat or a dog the bits should be reserved for it; otherwise burn them all. They must never be thrown into a dustbin. Then wash each plate very thoroughly in very hot water to which has been added a bit of soda about the size of a large walnut. Rinse them thoroughly, and put them in the plate rack. If there is no plate rack, dry them carefully. For plates of real china very hot water should not be used, as it may crack them. To Clean Saucepans. The instant a saucepan has been emptied of its contents it should be filled with hot water; add to this a morsel of soda, and stand it on the stove until ready to clean. Then scrub it well with the saucepan brush, rinse out with plenty of clean water, and dry very thoroughly. Wipe the outside with a special cloth, which must be kept only for this purpose. Then put the saucepan on shelf, but do not put the lid on. Wash saucepan lids well in soda and very hot water if greasy ;

Braising 63 ounce of butter and an ounce of flour, mixed to a paste by means of a little cold stock or water. Stir until the sauce is thick and creamy, and leaves the side of the saucepan. Add pepper and salt to taste. Arrange the vegetables in neat little groups around the meat, and serve at once, accompanied by baked potatoes. An Old Fowl. A bird, no matter how tough, may be made as tender as a spring chicken if cooked in the foregoing fashion. Tough New Zealand mutton, too, may be transformed into a very good imitation of tender English lamb by cooking it in the foregoing- fashion. A piece of tough flank of American chilled beef when braised will prove quite as tender, if not quite of so fine a flavour, as English meat. Very often small rounds of beef, weighing some 4 or 5 lbs., are to be had for as little as 43d. or 5d. a lb. at the stores. They are useless for roasting, but may be turned into a very dainty dish indeed if braised as directed. A tough piece of veal, when braised with plenty of onions and a little parsley and a bit of mace, is also quite a dainty dish. Mutton, Beef, Lamb, or Braised Veal may be much improved by the addition of from 4 to 8 ozs. of rice, which should be well washed, tied up in a muslin bag, and cooked with the meat. American butter beans, or flageolets, or dried haricot beans are also excellent with braised meat. The butter beans and haricots will require soaking for at least twenty-four hours before they are cooked ; but, for the flageolets, a couple of hoursâ€™ soaking is all that is needful. All these additions help to make the meat go considerably further.

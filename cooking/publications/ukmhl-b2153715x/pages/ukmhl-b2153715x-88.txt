CHAPTER XVI 84 The Husband’s Lunch A decided economy—A handy case—Daily provision. A Decided Economy. A very great saving, not only in pocket but in health, can be effected if a good substantial lunch is provided for the husband to take to town with him ; for with the small sum which is all that can be afforded for fares and pocket-money at his disposal, a hot lunch costing, say, a shilling every day, is almost an impossibility. If, however, a good hot substantial breakfast is provided, and a dainty yet substantial lunch put up, the average man, with the aid of tea and a scone or tea- cake at five o’clock, should be able to wait till dinner. A Handy Luncheon Case. It is a good plan to have a special little case made with a handle for carrying. Any stationer or saddler will make one of these for a trifling sum, and the lunch can then be packed away securely. Here are some menus suitable for this special purpose. Daily Provision. Monday—Cornish pasty. This can be made on Sunday when dinner is being cooked. Slices of underdone beef or mutton seasoned, hard-boiled egg, sliced cooked potato enclosed in dripping or good short crust. Apricot jam and cream sandwiches. Flask of whisky and water. Tuesday—Small mayonnaise of fish put into hollowed breakfast rolls. Apple turnover for sweet. Claret and seltzer in flask. Wednesday—Stuffed eggs. Hard-boiled eggs, halved, the yolks taken out and pounded with a bit of butter and a little anchovy or bloater paste, and put back. Buttered roll stuffed with water-cress. Jam puff for sweet. Whisky and soda in flask. Thursday—Home-made pork pie. Halved oranges filled with orange jelly. Claret and water in flask. Friday—Small fish salad, sardines, water-cress, hard-boiled eggs, put into hollowed rolls. Substantial jam turnover. Whisky and water in flask.

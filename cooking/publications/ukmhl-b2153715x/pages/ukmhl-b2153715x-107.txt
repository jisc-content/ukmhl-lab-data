The Glass Cupboard It may perhaps be urged that champagne glasses and finger bowls are not necessities, but champagne is sometimes received as a present, and finger bowls are as much a necessity as knives and forks, for even means so limited as those we have under contemplation are no excuse for slovenly habits. Thus the entire cost of the house complete in every detail is a trifle under ^120 ; the actual sum for furniture being just under ,Â£90.

38 Cleaning Materials If the store cupboard is stocked according to the foregoing direc- tions, many savoury stews, hashes, entrees, and ragouts of the simpler kind of French cookery, which is the most economical in the world, will be possible; and when meat chances to be very dear, many ex- ceedingly nice vegetable stews, soups, &c., may be made by means of lentils, dried green peas, butter beans, and other vegetables. Recipes for these will be presently appended. Cleaning- Materials. Cleaning materials should be kept in as clean and dry a place as possible. Soap should be cut into small Jpieces and slowly dried. New soap should never be used, as it lasts only half the time. Hudson’s soap is cheapest bought in the dozen packets, 8^d. per doz. Globe polish is cheapest in the 3-|d. tins, which contain just twice as much as the 2d. one. Camphor wax costs 3d. a tin; and black lead should always be bought in the dozen packets, at 2^d. the dozen. Soda should be bought by 14 lbs. for 6d. For cleaning knives bath-brick does really as well as knife polish, and only costs a ^d. a brick, whilst knife polish is 5d. or 6d. a tin. Buy the cheapest blacking and the cheapest black lead always ; they are just as good if not better than fancy articles, for which a fancy price is asked and paid. For patent boots try camphor wax; it does just as well and gives just as good a polish as boot cream at three times the price. Instead of plate powder, use finely powdered whitening, mixed with a little methylated spirits ; and the silver will look as well. It is in all these small ways that money can be saved, and at the end of the year it will be found that the sum is by no means insignificant. Note.—The approximate average price of the articles mentioned in “ The Store Cupboard ” is given, as prices are constantly varying.

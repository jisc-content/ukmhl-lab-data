Train for Matrimony Train for Matrimony. I should like to make it compulsory for every girl or woman to pass an examination in practical housewifery, and obtain a certificate of efficiency before she could marry, and this whether her future in- come were ^150 or ,£500 a year, for so only would the greatest good accrue to the community. The modern bachelor would not be nearly so shy of matrimony as he now is, if he felt certain that instead of a helpless girl, wholly de- pendent upon a more or less efficient servant, or servants, he was marrying a woman who would bring trained common sense and fore- sight as part of her housewifely dowry, and who would look upon housekeeping and domesticity generally, not as a necessary bore, but as a career in which she hoped to distinguish herself; who would regard her daily expenses and weekly bills as so many investments for which she was anxious to obtain the highest possible return ; and who would yet never degenerate into the mere household drudge. Again, the pursuit of a profession is by no means a bar to good housekeeping. The woman who has most to do can do most, and outside occupations should be no excuse for dirty stair-rods, a badly dusted drawing-room, spoilt meals, or an untidy household. Place your art or profession first, by all means, but make housekeeping second, and see that it is a good second, remembering that a badly nourished brain is not as a rule capable of producing good work. Your copy if you are a journalist, or your pictures if you are an artist, need not suffer in the slightest degree because you can teach your very plain cook how to cook a chop or make a stew, wash and dress your own baby, turn out a room and not forget the corners, or train a raw general servant. And now enough of generalities. Let us come to particulars, and let me show you how even the simplest of schoolgirls may become as sound a housekeeper as the most experienced veteran, if she will but take “method” as her motto.

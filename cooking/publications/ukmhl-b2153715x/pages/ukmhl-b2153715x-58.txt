To Fry Fish. To fry fish, put the clarified fat in the saucepan, and let it melt. Wait till the blue smoke rises. See that the fish is very dry. Dip it in flour, and place it in the boiling fat. Fry to a golden brown hue, take out, drain, and serve. If possible, egg and bread-crumb the fish before adding it to the boiling fat; but if the trifling expense of this cannot be afforded, dip the fish first into milk and then into flour, and fry it, and the results will be found nearly as good as if egg was used. To Boil Fish. Use only just enough very hot but not boiling water to cover the fish, and add a little less than i oz. of salt and two tablespoonfuls of vinegar to a quart of water. For a large piece of fish allow six minutes to the lb., and ten minutes over. For a small piece of fish allow six minutes to the lb., and five minutes over. Note that the fish must simmer the whole time, as, if the water is allowed actually to boil, the fish will be spoilt and quite tasteless. Mackerel should be put into lukewarm water only. Salmon must be put into the water as soon as it reaches boiling point. To Grill Fish. Mackerel and herrings are nice when grilled. Place a teaspoon- ful of butter in a saucer. Put the saucer in the oven, and let the butter melt; brush the fish over with the melted butter, sprinkle them with salt, and dredge them with flour. Have a very clear red fire. Wipe the bars of the gridiron with a bit of greased paper. Put the fish on the gridiron, and cook first on one side and then on the other. Five minutes either side will be enough for a very thin small fish,

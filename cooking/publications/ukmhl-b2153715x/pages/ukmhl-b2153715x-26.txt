CHAPTER III 22 How to Apportion the Income Economy and social standing—Tables and estimates—A very tight fit —How difficulties may be overcome—Possibilities of saving. Economy and Social Standing-. Assuming that the total amount of income which can be relied upon is £200, the following are suggestions for its better division. I have all through borne in mind that “circumstances alter cases,” and have therefore drawn up several tables applicable to different styles of living. The husband and wife, with one child, who are living in town, and moving in a social set with others whose means are far in excess of their own, must of necessity keep up a certain amount of style, and order their household differently to a couple with three or four children who live in the suburbs or the country, and whose set is a strictly suburban one of the lower middle class. I therefore append tables of expenditure suitable to all classes whose means do not exceed £200 a year. Tables and Estimates. Table I. Income ,£200. Family: Husband, wife, three children. Servant and nursemaid. House in suburbs. Washing done at home.

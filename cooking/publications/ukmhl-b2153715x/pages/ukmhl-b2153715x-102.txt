The Hall. As this is already covered with cork carpet, and adorned by a good Deccan or Kurd rug, it will require very little in the way of furniture. The halls or passages of most flats at a really moderate rental are so small that any large furniture is to be avoided. The very best thing I know of, where space is precious and cupboards are few, is the hall fitment kept by the firm I have alluded to. This in fumed oak has cupboards fitted with oxidised copper pegs for hats and coats, divisions for umbrellas or sticks, a drawer for gloves, and at either side a recess for hanging coats ; it is delightfully quaint and artistic with its hammered copper panel, and cannot be called anything but cheap at £5, 15s. Should this, however, be beyond the mark, I should advise the following articles:—Fumed oak hall seat, 17s. 6d.; fumed oak umbrella and stick stand combined, 15s. 9d. ; a fumed oak oblong table to stand against the wall and serve for letter and card trays, 15s. 9d.; and then, as a place must be found for coats, &c., a cornice wardrobe should be fitted up. The curtain to this should be of deep sage green art linen in place of cretonne, but the price will be the same, 18s. 6d. Allowing for four photogravures the sum of 10s., and the sum of is. 6d. for a card and letter tray, the hall will be complete at a total cost of about ,£3, 3s.

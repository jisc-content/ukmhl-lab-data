CHAPTER VII Hospitality Is entertaining possible ?—A little dinner— Waiting at table— An afternoon reception. Is Entertaining1 Possible? Regular entertaining upon such small means as those we are contemplating is of course impossible, especially if there are many little mouths to be fed, but it will be quite possible to ask a friend or a couple of friends to dinner occasionally, when once the maid of all work has been taught to cook. Let it not be forgotten that many a man has been made for life simply because he has been able to ask his chief, or an influential friend, home to a friendly dinner. A Little Dinner. This need not necessarily mean an expensive dinner. Just a simple repast, well cooked and daintily served, will give far more pleasure to eye and palate than any number of bought entrees which you cannot afford, from the local confectioner. Suppose then that you wish to give a little dinner, or that your husband wires home that he is bringing back a friend to take pot luck, the following is a suitable and sensible menu. Menu.

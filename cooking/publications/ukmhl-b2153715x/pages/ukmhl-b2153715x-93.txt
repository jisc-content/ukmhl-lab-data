CHAPTER I 89 Furniture for a Six-Roomed Flat Decorating and furnishing—Some colour sche7nes—Paint and wall paper—Floor covering—Carpets— The dining-room—The draw- ing-room. Decorating and Furnishing. When the means are very limited, furnishing and the choosing of furniture is apt to be a difficult and wearisome task. In the hope, then, that they will be of practical use, I have compiled the following schemes for furnishing respectively a six-roomed flat and an eight- roomed house, at prices which are the very lowest possible consistent with durability and fair quality. Some Colour Schemes. If you can possibly persuade your landlord to give it, have ivory paint throughout the house. Nothing looks so nice, nor does it require more washing than that which is darker in tone, if both are kept in clean condition. Ivory paint, too, is wonderfully cheerful in appearance, and tends to make a small room appear larger. Here are some useful colour schemes. Paint and Wall-Paper. For the drawing-room choose ivory paint ; sunset-yellow paper, plain, or empire striped, with a frieze of tulips and green leaves, or daffodils and green leaves of conventional design. For the dining-room, ivory paint, rose red paper, either floral or empire striped. For the best bedroom, ivory paint, sea-green paper, or if the room has a cold north aspect, a sunshiny yellow paper. For the spare room, ivory paint, almond blossom paper on a pale blue ground. For the servant’s room, deep cream paint, and a cheerful yellow or a pink paper. For the kitchen and bath-room, deep cream paint, and blue tiled sanitary washing paper. For the hall, ivory paint, and rose red plain paper.

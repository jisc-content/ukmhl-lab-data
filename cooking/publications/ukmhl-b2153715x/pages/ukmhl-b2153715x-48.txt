44 Savoury Porridge Savoury Porridge. This is much more appetising than the ordinary porridge. Use one part oatmeal to two-and-a-quarter parts of boiling salted water. Bring the water to the boil first, then throw in the oatmeal and stir for twenty minutes ; meanwhile place a bit of butter about the size of a small walnut in a clean frying-pan ; as soon as it melts add to it two large onions, peeled and thinly sliced. Fry till of a delicate golden brown. As soon as the porridge is ready dish it up on a hot dish, and put it in the oven to dry a little. Then place the onions on top, and pour over the whole any fat which may remain from the frying. Dust with pepper, and serve at once. To Make Tea. Pour a little quite boiling water into the teapot. Let it stand for a minute or two, then pour it off. Add a teaspoonful of tea for each person, and one for the pot. Fill up with absolutely boiling water, and send to table at once. The water to make good tea must be freshly boiled. To Make Coffee. To make strong coffee use 2 ozs. of coffee to a pint and three- quarters of boiling water. Pour a little boiling water into the coffee-pot and let it stand, then pour it off again. Put the ground coffee into the strainer. Pour the boiling water slowly over it. Stand the coffee-pot on the hottest part of the stove for ten minutes, or on the fire for six minutes, and then send to table at once, with a separate jug of absolutely boiling milk. To Make Cocoa. Allow a dessert-spoonful of cocoa for each person. Mix to a paste with a little cold milk or water. Add a large breakfast-cupful of skim milk, milk and water, or milk for each dessert-spoonful of cocoa. Place in a clean saucepan. Stir over the fire until quite boiling. Pour into a heated jug, and send to table at once. Some cocoas, such as Fryâ€™s, should be stirred until they thicken.

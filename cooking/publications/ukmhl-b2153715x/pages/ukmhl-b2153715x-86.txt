CHAPTER XV 82 Savouries, and How to Make Them Savouries — Sardmes on toast— Toast d la Yarmouth—Anchovy croutons—Sardine croutons—Croutes aux crevettes—Herring roes on toast—Hard roes on toast. Savouries. It sometimes happens that the head of the house does not care for sweet things; it is therefore well that the housewife should know how to turn out the daintiest possible savouries at the least possible cost. I append a few examples; others will doubtless suggest themselves as required. Sardines on Toast. Toast and butter a slice of bread. Cut off the crust; cut the bread into finger lengths ; place a sardine on each strip ; dust with salt and pepper ; make hot in the oven, and serve. Toast a la Yarmouth. Make some buttered toast; cut off the crust. Cut the toast into fingers ; spread these with bloater paste ; dust with cayenne ; make hot, and serve. Anchovy Croutons. Stamp some rounds out of a slice of stale bread with a pastry cutter. Fry in boiling fat from which the blue smoke is rising. Take out, drain, spread with anchovy paste ; dust with pepper ; make hot in the oven, and serve. Sardine Croutons are prepared in the same way. Croutes aux Crevettes. Make a pennyworth of picked shrimps hot in a little butter. Fry some rounds of stale bread to a golden hue in boiling fat; take out, drain, put the picked shrimps on top. Squeeze a little lemon juice ; dust with cayenne, and serve.

26 Possibilities of Saving I have not allowed at all for holidays in Tables I., II., and 111., as when the house is in a healthy suburb or in the country, holidays are not of such vital importance as they are to the dwellers in towns. Possibilities of Saving*. The possibility of saving upon such an income of £200 is but small, and will depend largely upon environment. Thus, in the case of a couple without children, some saving would be comparatively easy, unless special calls upon the purse prevented it. But where there are little mouths to be fed saving is almost out of the question, even with the best management. If possible, sickness should be insured against from the very first; and in many odd ways pence, halfpence, and even farthings may be saved up, and will soon mount to a respectable total. If there are children, each child should have its own money box, and be encouraged to save from its very earliest years. I must not, I suppose, attempt to deprive the head of the house, should he be a smoker, of his pipe, which taken in moderation may be a solace not to be despised. But in every direction, if husband and wife pull well together, small ways of saving will present themselves in special households which it would be impossible to catalogue here. Note.—In a flat, less firing and light are required than in a house, as there are no stairs, &c. I have therefore decreased the estimates for these items. JS

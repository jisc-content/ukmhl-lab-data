CHAPTER IX Dress for the Servants A neat costume— The nursemaid—Out-of-door dress. A Neat Costume. There is no need just because you can only afford to keep one servant why that one should look slovenly. For morning wear she should have neat dark blue cotton dresses, and then with a clean apron and high white collar she will always look smart and clean. Collars of white india-rubber cost but iofd. each, can be washed in the hand basin, dried instantly, and require no getting up. For afternoon wear the usual black gown, white collar and cuffs, and white apron and cap, should always be insisted upon. The Nursemaid. If a little nursemaid is kept, she should wear all day a dark grey cotton with white rubber collar. A pair of cuffs to match will add to the neatness of her appearance, and these cost only is., and are practically everlasting. A big serviceable apron to cover the dress is a necessity ; indeed, fine white aprons are out of place for a nurse- maid. Out-Door Dress. If the maid looks old for her age, she could wear a neat nurse’s bonnet, otherwise a sailor hat will be more suitable, for a childish face under a bonnet looks absurd. If possible, her jacket should be a dark grey also, as this does not show the dirt, and will not soil the children’s clothes as dark blue would. Don’t let her wear dirty white, or white at all. White nurses are luxuries only for the rich, and necessitate a long laundry bill.

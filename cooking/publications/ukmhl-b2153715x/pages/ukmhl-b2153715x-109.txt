The Dining-Room 105 with the chintz-patterned walls. A Romanhurst carpet, price £2, 2s., size 12 ft. by 9 ft., will be ample for this, unless the rooms are extra large. Best bedroom : a rose red carpet will be best here also, as the room should be kept to red and white. A Kensington square 9 ft. by 7 ft., ,£1, 2s. 6d., should be large enough, as the surround can be deepened to meet it. The second bedroom, sunset yellow paper, should have another Kensington square at the same price, in two shades of art blue with touches of sage green. For the third bedroom, with its sea green paper, an Abingdon square, price 15s., either rose du barri in hue, or, if it is desired to keep the room wholly green, in two shades of dull sage green. For the fourth room, probably a very small one, an Abingdon square in two shades of dull green and blue, price 12s. 6d., will suffice. For the servant’s room a rug at 2s. 6d. and stained boards must do, and the sum of £2, 10s. must be allowed for stair and landing carpets. Allowing for mats, one for each of the principal doors, 6s.; and for stair-rods, four dozen at 2s. iod. a dozen ; and four dozen eyes at 5d. per dozen, 12s. 8d. ; 6s. 9d. for a Deccan or Kurd rug for the hall (the boards here should first be stained), the total for the carpets will come to just £10, 7s. 2d.

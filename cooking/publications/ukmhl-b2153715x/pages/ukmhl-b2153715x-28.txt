Thus no doubt expenditure may be saved over both the coal and the electric light bill, and probably over the maid’s wages also, since plenty of untrained girls may still be had for 2s. or 2s. 6d. a week, and a little steady training on the lines I shall indicate soon works wonders. Many good flats in unfashionable localities are to be had for ,£30 or ^35 a year, and thus another small economy may be effected. A very Tight Fit. The hardest case of all is that of a husband and wife who are compelled to keep up appearances. Saving will I fear be out of the question in this instance, but the insurance, and if possible a policy against sickness, should be managed somehow. Table V. Husband and wife, two children.

January. 2 spoonful of mixed mustard, salt and pepper to taste. Pour this around the chops as they are dished.—From “Table Talk,” Philadel- phia. 2.—Creamed Oysters. One pt. of cream, i qt. of oysters, a slice of onion, a tablespoonful of flour, salt and pepper to taste and a pinch of mace. Let the cream with the mace and onion come to a boil. Mix the flour with a little cold water, and stir it into the boiling cream. Let the oysters come to a boil in their own liquor, drain off all the liquor, and turn the oysters into the cream, and serve with strips of toast. 3.—Breakfast Chicken. Cut the chicken in pieces as for fricassee. Dip the pieces in beaten egg, and then in fine bread crumbs. Season with pepper, salt and a very little fine sage (if you like the flavor). Put them in the dripping-pan with bits of butter over them, and a little water in the pan. Bake slowly until they are done. Make a rich gravy in the dripping-pan after the chicken is taken out.

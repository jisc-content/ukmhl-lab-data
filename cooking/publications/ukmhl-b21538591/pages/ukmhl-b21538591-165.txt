Cover and cook 5 minutes, then season with 1 tea- spoonful of salt, y2 of a teaspoonful of pap- rika, a dash of cayenne, 1 teaspoonful of onion juice and a pinch of mace. Take from the fire, add the hard-boiled eggs, chopped rather coarsely, and 1 tablespoonful of chopped parsley. Spread out on a buttered dish and set away to cool. Dust the hands lightly with flour and shape spoonful of the mixture in small cutlets, being careful to pat them out until of an even thickness; use as little flour as possible, or the creamy con- sistency will be lost. When all are shaped, dip each cutlet into slightly beaten egg, then in fine dried bread crumbs, and immerse in smoking hot fat until golden brown. Drain on unglazed paper and serve with tomato or cream sauce.—From “Table Talk,” Phila- delphia. 25.—Cod Steaks a la Cardinal.

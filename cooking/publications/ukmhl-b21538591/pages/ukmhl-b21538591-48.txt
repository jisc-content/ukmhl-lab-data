March. 40 stock (that in which the mutton was cooked will do) and a teaspoonful of Worcestershire sauce; let the meat stand two or three hours. Make a cup and a half of rather thick sauce ; add the meat and such liquid as has not been absorbed, salt and pepper, and a tablespoon - ful of capers or fine chopped cucumber pickles. Let stand without boiling until very hot. Serve on toast.—From “ The Boston Cooking School Magazine.” 19.—Stewed Squabs. Clean, tie down the legs and wings and put a piece of bacon on the breast of each bird. Put a few slices of bacon in the bot- tom of a kettle and put the squabs on them; cover with stock and let them stew gently until tender. Serve on toast and pour the stock slightly thickened around them. 20.—Minced Calf’s Liver. Cut liver into small dice and fry with a little salt pork ; cover with boiling water and simmer gently for 15 or 20 minutes. Take out the liver, lay it on slices of toast.

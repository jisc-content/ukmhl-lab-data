69 JUNE. i.—Beef Olives. Cut thin slices from cold roast beef, 2*4 by 4 inches. Chop the trimmings and fat, allow- ing i tablespoonful of the chopped mixture for each slice. Season highly with salt, pepper, and herbs and mix with as much cracker crumbs as meat. Spread this on each slice nearly to the edge. Roll and tie. Dredge with salt, pepper and flour, and fry brown in drippings or salt pork fat; put in a stewpan and make a brown gravy by adding 2 table- spoonfuls of flour to the fat left in the pan and when brown pour on 1 pint of hot water. Season with salt and pepper, pour over the rolls and simmer until they are tender. Re- move the strings, place the rolls on a platter, season the gravy and pour it over them.— Mrs. Lincoln.

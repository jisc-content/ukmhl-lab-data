June. 81 30.—Scalloped Lobster. Season 1 pint of lobster, cut into dice with salt, pepper and cayenne. Mix with 1 cup of cream sauce; fill the lobster shells, using the tail shell of 2 lobsters. Cover the meat with cracker crumbs and moisten with melted butter. Bake until the crumbs are brown. Put the two shells together on a platter, with the tail ends out, to look like a long canoe. Lay the small claws over the sides to represent oars. Garnish with pars- ley.—Mrs. Lincoln.

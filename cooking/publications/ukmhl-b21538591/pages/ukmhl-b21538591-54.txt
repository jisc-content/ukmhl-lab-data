APRIL. i—Lobster Croquettes. Pick the lobster very fine, mix with bread crumbs and season with pepper and salt; moisten with cream or white sauce; add a little butter. Shape, dip in egg and crumbs and fry. 2.—Breaded Chops. Wipe and trim the chops, sprinkle with salt and pepper, dip in egg and bread crumbs and fry in deep fat 5 or 6 minutes. Sprinkle finely chopped parsley over them and serve. 3.—Boiled Eggs. Have a large saucepan containing boiling water. Put into it the number of eggs de- sired. Put the saucepan on the back of the stove where the water will not boil. Cook eight minutes if desired soft boiled, forty if hard boiled. These are delicious. 4G

Butter a baking dish and cover the bottom with hot mashed potato, then put in the fish and bits of but- ter, then a top layer of potato. Bake in a hot oven 10 minutes. 10.—Fried Sweetbreads. Parboil and when cold dip them in beaten egg and cracker crumbs, sprinkle salt over them and fry in hot fat. Take 1 tablespoon- ful of this fat, and stir into it 1 tablespoonful of flour, then set the pan back a little and add gradually 1 cupful of milk, stir until smooth. Season with salt and pepper, a little very finely chopped celery and cook about 2 min- utes. Pour over the sweetbreads. 11.—Scalloped Eggs. Butter a baking dish, put in a layer of bread crumbs, a layer of sliced hard-boiled eggs, then bits of butter; if you have cold meat, then a layer of that chopped fine. Continue this until the dish is full. Then pour over all a cup of milk or soup stock. Sift grated crumbs over the top and bake in the oven for 10 minutes.

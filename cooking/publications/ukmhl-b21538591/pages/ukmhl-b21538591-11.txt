January, 4.—Lobster Cutlets. Boil a lobster, keep the fat and coral by themselves. Chop the meat fine; rub it still finer with a wooden spoon ; moisten it with a tablespoonful of butter, and cream enough to make it moist; add a handful of bread crumbs; season with mace, salt and pepper. Make it into shape, roll in egg and cracker dust, and fry in hot fat. Make a sauce of the green and white fat with the coral rubbed very fine, to give it color, and smooth it with a tablespoonful of butter; season with mace and pepper. Have a gill of drawn butter in a cup set in hot water; stir the lobster mix- ture into the drawn butter; heat it hot, but do not let it boil; add the juice of half a lemon the last thing. Put the cutlets on a hot dish and pour the sauce around them. 5.—Liver and Bacon. Saute the liver in a little bacon fat, and when done make a little gravy from it with flour and hot water. Heat a clean pan, drop in slices of bacon of wafer-like thickness. If the pan is very hot they will curl up into rolls,

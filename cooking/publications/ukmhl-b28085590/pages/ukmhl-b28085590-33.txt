"The ChiWs Cookery Book 29 Have ready a pint of stock and add it to the vegetables when they are soft. Stir well and bring it to a boil. Add a small coffee-cupful of tapioca and let it all simmer till it is cooked, stirring from time to time. Add two lumps of sugar, salt and pepper, and it is ready to serve. An eggspoonful of Liebig’s extract of meat stirred in at the last moment improves this soup very much. You must shake the saucepan several times to prevent the vegetables from stick- ing to the bottom, but don’t uncover it oftener than you can help because the steam cooks the vegetables, and it will escape if the lid is raised. Remember the saucepan must be a good one, or it will burn, and the vegetables must be raw.

Collect every variety of vegetable you can get, a piece of carrot, onion, parsnip, potato, celery, cauliflower, a leaf or two of cabbage, and, in fact, a little bit of any vegetable in season, which, of course, differs according to the time of year. In summer, for instance, peas, beans, asparagus, &c., make an excellent addition, always beginning, however, with a piece of carrot, turnip, onion, and potato. Whatever you use must go through the mincing machine. When minced, the mixed vegetables ought to fill a breakfast cup.

Cover the saucepan closely and leave it over a low fire or a small jet of gas till they get soft.

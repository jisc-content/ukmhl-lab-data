T^he ChiWs Cookery Book 37 cupful of rice which has been carefully picked over, but not washed. Leave the cover off, and stir occasionally, boiling as hard as possible all the time. Take out a grain and press it between your finger and thumb, and when the rice is boiled it will all press out and leave no hard part. Turn it out into a colander, and throw a jugful of cold water over it; cover the colander with a napkin, and put it into the oven or before the fire to keep hot till required.

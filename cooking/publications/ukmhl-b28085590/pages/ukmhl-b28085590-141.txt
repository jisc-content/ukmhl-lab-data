137 Old Fashioned Gruel Into three pints of equal parts of milk and water sprinkle a quarter of a pint of Embden groats very slowly, and when it is smooth, boil it gently for two hours or more till it is thick. Stir the groats constantly, and don’t put the saucepan over a hot fire. Strain off the groats, and then return the gruel to the saucepan, and add enough milk to make it as thick as cream. When quite hot, pour into a cup, and serve with thin toast very daintily cut into thin strips on a plate. Send up a bowl of castor sugar, but do not sweeten it yourself; invalids often have to eat gruel which is almost uneatable, because the cook has sweetened it to her liking, instead of the patient’s.

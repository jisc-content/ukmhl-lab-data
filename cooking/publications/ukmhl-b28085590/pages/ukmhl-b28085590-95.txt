l^he Child'â€™s Cookery Book 91 The Pearl of Milk Puddings Soak an ounce of pearl barley in cold water all night, next day drain the water away, and put the barley into a pudding dish with three ounces of brown sugar and a pint of milk, let this bake in a slow oven for about four hours. This pudding I can thoroughly recom- mend ; if it is nicely baked it should be as thick as cream. Cheesecakes Put two ounces of ground rice in a basin and add to it two ounces of sifted sugar, then stir in two ounces of butter after it has been melted, and an egg thoroughly well beaten, add to this a teaspoonful of lemon juice. Line some patty-pans with pastry, fill them with the mixture, and bake them till they are a nice brown. A quarter of an hour should be long enough.

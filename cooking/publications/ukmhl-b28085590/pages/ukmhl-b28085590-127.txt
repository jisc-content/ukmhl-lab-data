Sweetmeats 123 And now we come to the sweets. They are an excellent employment for a wet day, and amply repay the trouble of making. We will begin with toffee, which has, I suppose, been made by generations of children for hundreds of years. This is the absolutely simple recipe of my child- hood, but there are many varieties, all of which I must give you. Melt over a clear fire three ounces of fresh butter, and when it is melted, pour into it one pound of Demerara sugar, and keep stirring unceas- ingly till it is done. This can be found out by dropping a little of the mixture into a glass of cold water and tasting it. When the toffee hardens at once it is done, and may be poured into buttered soup plates to cool.

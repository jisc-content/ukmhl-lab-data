The Child'^s Cookery Book 26 Artichoke Soup Get some artichokes, about eight will do if you peel them carefully, and donâ€™t waste any. They are very knobbly vegetables, and so easily wasted, but you must peel all the little knobbles. Cut up the artichokes with half an onion and a potato. Put them all into a saucepan with a slice of bacon and one ounce of butter, and when they have cooked a little add a pint of stock or water. Stew gently till the vegetables have become a pulp, then add one pint of boiling milk, stir it well, pass through a sieve, and return to the saucepan to get hot. Add a little celery salt, put into your soup tureen the well- beaten yolk of one egg, and when the soup is quite hot, pour it into the tureen, stirring all the time. The piece of bacon, which will remain on the sieve when the vege- tables have been passed through, must be thrown aside.

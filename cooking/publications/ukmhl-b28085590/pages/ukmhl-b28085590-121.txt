"The Child'^s Cookery Book 117 Loaf of Bread Dissolve half an ounce of German yeast in a very little water, then add half a pint of warm water; put a pound of flour into a basin, add a teaspoonful of salt and one of sugar, mix in the dissolved yeast till it is in a firm dough, and put it in a warm place to rise. Leave it for half an hour or so, and when it has risen to about double its original size, knead it well, adding a little more flour if the dough sticks to your hands. Have ready a well-greased bread- tin, and half fill it with the dough, or make the dough up into small cottage loaves, and bake it for about an hour. After putting the bread into the oven, do not open the door lor at least twenty minutes | and when you have looked at the loaf, if it is rising and browning nicely, shut the door very gently, and donâ€™t look again for some time. When it is done it will be a nice brown.

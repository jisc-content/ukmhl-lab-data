12 quite wholesome. In searching for some- thing new (or old) to add to the variety, I consulted a cookery-book which is more than a hundred years old, and, for the amusement of the children, have copied out a recipe which is given to be used for a grand party. At the end of the book I have put a few recipes which I have no doubt will appear dull, but, in spite of adverse opinion, I believe that there are manv children to whom it is a real pleasure to have it in their power to do a kindness to those who are ill. I have therefore added a few very simple recipes suitable for sick people, and I am quite sure that some of my readers will be very glad to know how to make gruel, &c., properly. I know that if they master them thoroughly, there will come a day when they will find the knowledge useful. LOUISA S. TATE.

The Child^s Cookery Book 62 crumbled, mix in a saltspoonful of mustard, and then drop in very slowly a tablespoon- ful of oil. When it is well mixed add a teaspoonful of vinegar, then another tablespoonful of oil and another teaspoonful of vinegar. If you can get a small quantity of cream, it is a great improvement, or if the mixture is very thick, make it thinner by adding a small quantity of milk. Then add a little pepper and salt and a pinch of sifted sugar. The oil ought not to curdle if the vinegar is added very slowly, but if it does, add the raw yolk of an egg, and the mixture will become like thick cream again. Chop the hard boiled white of the egg into small pieces and add it to the mixture.

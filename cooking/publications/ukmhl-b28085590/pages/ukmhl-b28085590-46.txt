"The Child'^s Cookery Book 42 cucumber into slightly salted water, and let it boil for ten minutes. Peel a small onion and a good-sized apple, cut them up into slices, and fry them slightly in a frying-pan with a piece of butter the size of a walnut. When they are soft, but not brown, stir in an eggspoonful of sugar, a dessertspoonful of flour, an eggspoonful of curry powder, a pinch of salt, and a dessertspoonful of milk. Stir it well over the Are for a few minutes, but do not let it burn. Turn it out on a plate to cool. Fill the boiled cucumber with the mixture, then roll the cucumber in flour, then in a well- beaten egg, and then in bread crumbs. Place it in a well-greased tin, and bake for twenty minutes in a hot oven. Heat a coffee-cupful of tomato sauce, pour it over the cucumber, and serve. I can strongly recommend this dish.

7 Preface Many years ago I wrote a small cookery book for children which was a great success, and was much appreciated by boys and girls generally, who found it a constant source of amusement for a rainy day. I have had many letters asking for other recipes, and these I am now adding to a new edition, together with several others, which will, I hope, make a pleasant variety. My idea in writing the book was that children might be able to cook dainty and palatable food, without wasting a large amount of material, should their efforts prove unsuccessful, and to put it into their power to make, on a small scale, dishes as good as those found on the dining-room table.

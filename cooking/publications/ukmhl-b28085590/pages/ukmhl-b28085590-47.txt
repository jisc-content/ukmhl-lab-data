"The Child'^s Cookery Book 43 Hidden Morsels Take a slice of beef or mutton, cut it into small squares, and lay them in a pie- dish. Take one ounce of flour, mix with this, by degrees, a teacupful of milk, add the well-beaten yolk of one egg, and a little salt; pour it over the meat, and put it into a hot oven; bake till it rises and is of a nice brown colour. Potato Ball Butter a mould well, line it thickly with mashed potatoes ; cut up a slice of mutton very small, add a little pepper and salt and a tablespoonful of gravy, put it into the mould, cover the top with potato, and bake for a quarter of an hour in a very hot oven; turn it out on to a dish, and serve. A kitchen-cup will do for this mould.

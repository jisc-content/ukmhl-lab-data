PICKLES. 355 salt; let them stand twenty-four hours. Strain off the liquor, and to a quart put the well-beaten whites of two or three eggs; boil it, and run it through a flannel bag; then boil it for about ten minutes with a little salt, three quarters of an ounce of black, and a quarter of an ounce of Jamaica pepper. When cold, bottle it with the spices, and seal the corks. BURTONâ€™S MUSHROOM CATSUP. Peel the mushrooms, break them into bits, and strew salt over them; let them stand one night only, warm them on the fire, and then strain the liquor; boil it about five minutes, and skim it well. Add to each quart half an ounce of ginger, one blade of mace, six cloves, quarter of an ounce of black pepper, and half an ounce of allspice, and let the whole boil a quarter of an hour.

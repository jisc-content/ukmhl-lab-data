It will keep good a twelvemonth, and exactly resembles fresh lobster sauce. Four table-spoonfuls heated in melted butter are sufficient for a large sauce-tureen. OYSTER SAUCE. Beard the oysters, and put them into a sauce-pan, with their liquor strained, a good bit of butter, a few black pepper- corns, a little salt, cayenne, and a blade of mace. Simmer them gently for fifteen or twenty minutes, on no account allow- ing them to boil. Knead some flour into a bit of butter, and melt it, adding a little milk ; pick out the peppercorns and mace from the oysters, and pour upon them the melted butter. ANOTHER OYSTER SAUCE. Beard and scald the oysters, strain the liquor, and thicken it with a little flour and butter; squeeze in a little lemon juice, and add three table-spoonfuls of cream. Heat it well, but do not let it boil. ANOTHER OYSTER SAUCE, FOR BOILED FOWL, OR TURKEY. Put into a stew-pan, with their liquor, two dozen of oys- ters, and a little water; when it boils, take out the oysters with a silver spoon, and drain them upon a hair sieve ; let the liquor settle, and pour it off from the sediment; beard the oysters. Put into a stew-pan, with one or two spoonfuls of fine flour, two ounces of fresh butter, and stir it till the flour is a little fried; add the liquor of the oysters, and a pint of cream ; stir, and let this boil a quarter of an hour; then add two table-spoonfuls of bechamel, or a little highly- seasoned gravy, and the oysters, which must be made quite hot. MOCK OYSTER SAUCE. Put into a sauce-pan two or three chopped anchovies, a quarter of a pint of water, a little mace, and one or two cloves ; let them simmer till the anchovies be quite dissolved.

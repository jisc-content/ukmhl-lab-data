BREWING. 422 allowing fifteen gallons capacity for every nine gallons of li- quor intended to be suffered to ferment in it, will do very well. A common thermometer, with a metal scale, enclosed in a tin case, should be provided to ascertain the temperature of the water ; but if there should not be one at hand, heat 220 measures, gallons or quarts, of water, according to the quantity required, and, when it boils, add 100 similar mea- sures of cold water. Barrels of eighteen gallons capacity are most convenient and economical for strong beer. Cleanliness cannot be too much attended to in the brewing process. Some days before brewing, all the casks and tubs should be filled with water, to render them tight; and, after the brewing utensils are made use of, they should be tho- roughly washed out: during the summer, the vessels may be scoured with lime water; and the copper ought to be kept especially clean. The moment a cask is empty, fasten down the vent peg, and stop the tap-hole with a cork well fitted and hammered into its place. Pale-coloured malt is preferable to amber-coloured malt: if it be new, it should be left exposed to the open air one or two days after grinding, before it be used ; if old, it should be ground the one day and used the next. When it is ground too finely, it clogs the mash, and impedes the draining of the wort; hut every grain should be bruised. When economy is an object, a quantity of molasses or muscovado sugar may be substituted for a portion of the malt; 12 lbs. of molasses, or 10 lbs. of sugar, are equal to one bushel of malt; when used, it may be dissolved in the water employed for the second and third mashing. Farnham hops are esteemed the best; Nottinghamshire, termed Northclay hops, have a rank flavour in beer newly brewed, and should therefore only be used for strong keeping beers. Worcester hops have a fla- vour peculiarly mild and delicate. Yeast produced from the fermentation of strong ale or porter is the best.

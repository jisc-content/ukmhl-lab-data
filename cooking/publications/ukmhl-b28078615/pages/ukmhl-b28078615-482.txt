Beat one pound of fresh butter to a cream ; add the yolks and whites of twelve eggs, well and separately beaten, one pound of grated and sifted sugar, one pound and a quarter of dried and sifted flour, two pounds of well-cleaned currants; of citron, candied orange and lemon peel, cut small, half a pound; of sweet and bitter almonds, blanched and pounded, two ounces each; a tea-spoonful of pounded cinnamon, and one of grated nutmeg, and a large wine-glass of the best French brandy; beat all these ingredients well together. Bake it in a buttered tin, lined with paper also buttered, and put two or three inches above the tin shape, to prevent the cake browning too quickly. PERTH CAKE.

One pound of currants may be used. TENBY CAKES FOR BREAKFAST.

Form or roll it into small cakes, place them upon a floured tin before the fire, and when they look light, put them into the oven to bake about ton or fifteen minutes.

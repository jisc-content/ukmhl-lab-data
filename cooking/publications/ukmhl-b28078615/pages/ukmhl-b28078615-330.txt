CAKES, BISCUITS, &c. 318 irons, having a back to support the cake. To make these cakes soft, they must not be toasted before the fire, but both sides done quickly on the girdle. BARliEY-MEAL SCONS FOR BREAKFAST. Boil a quart of good milk, add a tea-spoooful of salt, and stir it into barley-meal till quite thick ; strew meal over the paste-board, roll out the paste quickly, cut the scons the size of a saucer, dust meal over, and bake them upon a girdle; turn them, and as they are done, lay them one upon another to keep them soft.

Melt, in a tea-cupful of milk, a large table-spoonful of butter, kneaded in flour ; beat up the yolk of an egg with a tea-spoonful of cream; stir it into the butter, and heat it over the fire, stirring it constantly. Chopped parsley improves this sauce. It also may be made melting the butter with w'ater, and mixing milk with the egg. SAUCE FOR BOILED CHICKENS. Parboil the livers, bruise and mix them with one anchovy^ a little shalot and parsley, the hard-boiled yolks of two, and the white of one egg, all finely minced, and make it quite hot in melted butter. LA SAUCE ROBERT. Cut some onions small, fry them of a fine brown, moisten them with some veal gravy, skim it, put in a little pepper and salt, and just before serving, mix in a spoonful of mustard. SALAD SAUCE. Bruise the yolk of a hard-boiled egg with a small tea- spoonful of salt; then add a dessert-spoonful of mustard, and stir in gradually a large table-spoonful of olive oil, oiled butter, or cream; then by degrees mix in two or three table- spoonfuls of vinegar ; serve it in a sauce-tureen, or mix it with the salad. Instead of the hard egg, some persons pre- fer the sauce made with the yolk raw. ANOTHER SALAD SAUCE. Rub smooth a hard-boiled egg, beat well a raw egg, and mix them together with a little water, a tea-spoonful of salt, one of cayenne, one of black pepper, and one of mustard, a table-spoonful of vinegar, one of essence of anchovies, and five of rich cream.

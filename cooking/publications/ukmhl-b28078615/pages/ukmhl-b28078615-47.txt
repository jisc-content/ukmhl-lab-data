35 FISH. more easily be detected after they are boiled ; by then hold- ing them firmly and shaking them, the rattling of the water will be heard. Prawns and Shrimps are good when their tails turn strongly inwards, and when they have no unpleasant smell. When Oysters are alive and strong, the shell, in opening them, will close upon the knife. Those from the coast of Kent, and those called Pandore, from the Frith of Forth, are the most esteemed. On Dressing Fish. Fish must by no means be allowed to remain in the water after it is boiled ; if, therefore, it should -be ready before it can be sent to table, it must be dished, the cover put on, and a cloth put over it. The dish is then to be set across the fish-kettle. Fish should be fried over a clear quick fire, and with dripping, or hogâ€™s lard, in preference to butter. The pan should be deep ; and to ascertain that it is clean, a little fat is first fried in it, poured out, and the pan wiped with a clean cloth; as much dripping or lard is then put in as will en- tirely cover the fish. When it is boiling hot, and begins to smoke, the fish is put in ; if small, they may be turned in three or four minutes, by sticking in a fork near the head with the one hand, and with the other supporting the tail with a fish-slice. When they are done, they should be laid before the fire upon an old soft towel, and turned now and then till they are dry upon both sides ; or they may be put upon a large sieve, turned upwards, and which is kept for the purpose, or put on the underside of a dish. The fire for broiling fish must be very clear, and the grid- iron perfectly clean, which, when hot, should be rubbed with a bit of suet. The fish, while broiling, must be often turned.

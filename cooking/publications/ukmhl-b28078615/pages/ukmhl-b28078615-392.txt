380 DOMESTIC WINES, &c. when a quart of rum is added ; it is then strained, bottled, and tightly corked. BISHOP. Roast four good-sized bitter oranges till they are of a pale brown colour ; lay them in a tureen, and put over them half a pound of pounded loaf sugar, and three glasses of claret; place the cover on the tureen, and let stand till next day.

The cask must be filled up morning and evening with what works over it, and bunged up when the fermentation ceases ; in a month the beer may be bottled, and in two or three months it will be fit for drinking.

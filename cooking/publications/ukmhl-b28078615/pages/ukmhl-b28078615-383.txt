DOMESTIC WINES, &c. 371 PARSNIP WINE. To five gallons of water, eight pounds of parsnips, and fifteen pounds of sugar, are allowed ; the parsnips, being well cleaned, and cut into slices, are to be boiled in the whole or in a portion of the water; when quite soft, they are to be taken out and mashed, then returned to the water they were boiled in, and being well stirred, are put through a hair-sieve; the sugar is then to be added to the strained liquor, and the quantity made up with boiled water; when nearly cold, it is to be put into the cask with two spoonfuls of yeast, and three ounces of crude tartar, and stirred every day till the fermentation subsides, which may be in ten days or a fort- night ; it is then bunged up, and may be racked and fined in three or six months, and bottled in six months more. BIRCH WINE. To every gallon of juice from the birch-tree, three pounds of sugar, one pound of raisins, half an ounce of crude tartar, and one ounce of almonds, are allowed; the juice, sugar, and raisins, are to be boiled twenty minutes, and then put into a tub, together with the tartar; and when it has fer- mented some days, it is to be strained, and put into the cask, and also the almonds, which must be tied in a muslin bag. The fermentation having ceased, the almonds are to be with- drawn, and the cask bunged up, to stand about five months, when it may be fined and bottled. GINGER WINE. To eight gallons of water, twelve pounds of sugar, three pounds of bitter oranges, five pounds of lemons, and thirteen oimces of ginger, are allowed; the sugar and the ginger, bruised, are to be boiled with the water half an hour, and allowed to stand till next day ; the fruit is to be pared very thin, and the strained juice, and half the peel, put into a cask with two gallons and a half of good whisky, or other spirit; when it has stood a night, the clear part of the boiled liquid is to be poured over it, the sediment being kept back; it does not ferment, and therefore it is not necessary that the cask should be full; it is immediately bunged up, and in a fortnight it must be fined, and in another fortnight it may be bottled. To improve the colour, a table-spoonful of burnt sugar may be added when the cask is filled up, first diluting it with a portion of the liquor.

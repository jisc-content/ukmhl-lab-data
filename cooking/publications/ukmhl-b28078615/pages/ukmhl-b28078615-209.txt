VEGETABLES. 197 TO DRESS THE LEAVES OF WHITE BEET. Pick and wash them clean; put them on in boiling water with a little salt; cover the sauce-pan, and boil them longer than spinach ; drain off the water, and beat them as spinach, with a bit of butter and a little salt.

Keep them in a cold place. ANOTHER WAY TO PRESERVE GREEN PEAS. Put into a sauce-pan of boiling water fresh-gathered and fresh-shelled peas, but not very young ; as soon as they boil up, pour off the water, and put them upon a large dry cloth folded, and then upon another, that they may be perfectly

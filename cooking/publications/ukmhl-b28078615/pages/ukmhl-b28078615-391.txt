DOMESTIC WINES, &c. 379 brandy, and allowed to stand for three days; when one pound of finely-pounded and sifted sugarcandy is to be added; the whole well shaken, and to stand two days, then strained through a jelly-bag. CAPILI^lIRE. The best capillaire is that of North America. Put one ounce of it into a small quantity of boiling water, to infuse like tea; add a pound of sugar to the infusion; clarify it with the white of an egg, and boil it to a thick sirup ; strain it through a cloth, and when cold, put in a little orange- flow'er water, and bottle it. That which is commonly sold as capillaire in England, is simply sirup flavoured with orange- flower water. HAWTHORN UQUEUR. The full blossoms of the white thorn are to be picked dry and clean from the leaves and stalks, and as much put into a large bottle as it will hold lightly without pressing it down; it is then to be filled up with French brandy, and allowed to stand two or three months, when it must be decanted off, and sweetened with clarified sugar, or with capillaire. With- out the sweetening, it is an excellent seasoning for puddings and custards. CAIiEDONXAN LIQUEUR. An ounce of oil of cinnamon is to be dropped on two pounds and a half of bruised loaf sugar; one gallon of the best whisky being added, and the sugar being dissolved, it is to be filtered and bottled. A liqueur may be made with any other essential oil, such as caraway. IMPERIAL. To one ounce of cream of tartar, two ounces of ginger, one lemon cut into slices, and two pounds of loaf sugar, two gallons of boiling water are added ; when almost cold, two table-spoonfuls of yeast are stirred in. It may be bottled next day, and will be fit for drinking the day after it is bottled. ANOTHER WAY TO MAKE IMPERIAL. Two ounces of cream of tartar, the juice and parings of two lemons, and a few cloves, are put into a jar, and six quarts of boiling water added; it is sweetened with loaf sugar, covered, and allowed to stand till the following day,

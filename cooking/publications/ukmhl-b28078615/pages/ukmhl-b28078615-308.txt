296 CREAMS, CUSTARDS. &c. TO PRESERVE LEMONS FOR EIGHT OR TEN MONTHS. The lemons must be perfectly fresh and sound, and free from every blemish. Put into a box a layer of earth, pre- viously sifted, and made sufficiently damp for corn to spring in; strew over it a little barley, and place the lemons on it so as not to touch each other, and again put a layer of earth and barley; do this till all the lemons are packed, and taking care they be entirely covered with the earth. The box must be kept in a cellar, or some damp place, to prevent the earth becoming too dry. TO PRESERVE LEMON JUICE. Squeeze, and strain a pint of lemon juice; put into a china basin one pound of double-refined sugar finely pounded and sifted, add the lemon juice, and stir it with a silver spoon till the sugar be perfectly dissolved. Bottle it, and cork it tightly; seal the cork, or tie bladder over it, and keep it in a dry cool place. TO PURIFY LEMON JUICE. To one quart of strained lemon juice, add one ounce of well-burned and finely-pounded charcoal; in twelve hours filter it through filtering paper, and put it into small phials, which cork tightly, and keep in a cool place : a thick crust will form beneath the cork, and the mucilage will fall to the bottom. Hang up the peels, and when dried, keep them in a paper bag. COLOURING FOR JELLIES, CREAMS, ICES, AND CAKES. Boil very slowly in a gill of water, till reduced to one half, twenty grains of cochineal, the same quantity of alum and of cream of tartar finely pounded; strain, and keep it in a small phial. For yellow, use an infusion of saffron. For green, wash well, and pull into small bits, a handful of spinach leaves ; put them into a closely-covered sauce- pan ; let them boil for a few minutes, and then express the juice.

GRAVIES, SAUCES, &c. 161 To fry parsley, wash it, pick it clean, and put it into fresh cold water ; take it out, and then throw it into boiling lard or dripping, when it will instantly become crisp ; it is then taken out with a slice. WHITE ROUX. OR WHITE THICKENING FOR SAUCES AND MADE DISHES. Melt gradually, over a slow fire, a good piece of butter, and dredge in a sufficiency of flour to make it like a thin paste ; keep stirring it for a quarter of an hour, and then put it into a small jar to be kept for use. BROWN ROUX, OR THICKENING. Put into a nicely-tinned sauce-pan about a pound of fresh butter ; melt it slowly, and dredge in flour till it becomes like a paste, carefully stirring it all the time; put it for a few mi- nutes upon a quick fire, and then return it to where there is less heat, and stir it till it assumes a light brown colour, when it may be put into ajar. These thickenings keep for some time. GRAVY MADE FROM BONES. Break into small pieces a pound of beef, mutton, or veal bones — if mixed together, so much the better; boil them in two quarts of water, and after it boils, let it simmer for nearly three hours; boil with it a couple of onions, a bunch of sweet herbs, some salt and pepper ; strain, and keep it for making gravy or sauces. — The bones of broiled or roasted meat, if scraped, washed clean, and boiled in less water, answer equally well for this purpose. TO MAKE GRAVY. Cut down into slices four pounds of lean beef, rub the bottom of the pot with butter, and put in the meat; turn it frequently till it be well browned, and do it slowly ; then add four quarts of cold water; when it has boiled two hours, put in a dessert-spoonful of whole black pepper, and the same of .Jamaica pepper, one carrot, and three onions; let it stew gently for four hours longer ; strain it, and when it is required for use, take off the fat. This gravy answers for all made dishes when brown gravy sauce is used. L

GRAVIES, SAUCES, &c. 171 A SAUCE FOR ANT SORT OF MEAT. Boil and strain three table-spoonfuls of gravy, two of vinegar, a blade of mace, a little pepper, salt, and a large sliced onion. SAUCE TOURNEE. To a little white thickening, add some stock drawn from the trimmings of veal, poultry, and ham ; do not make it too thick. Boil it slowly with a few mushrooms, a bunch of parsley, and some green onions ; strain and skim it well, and use it as required. German sauce is made as the sauce tournee, adding the beaten yolks of two or more eggs, and is used for ragouts, fricassees, and any made dish which may require a rich white sauce. SAUCE D'ATTELETS. Take of finely-minced parsley, mushrooms, and shalots, a table-spoonful each ; fry them with a little butter, and then dredge in a little flour ; moisten the mixture with some good stock, season it with pepper and salt, and boil it till it begins to thicken; then take it off the fire, and add the well-beaten yolks of two or three eggs. Stir it well all the time it is making. â€” This sauce is generally used instead of butter, when crumbs of bread are to be put over any thing. A SAUCE.

TO PREPARE THE FAT OF BACON FOR I.ARDXNG. Cut the fat from the pork ; rub it with salt, allowing one pound of salt to every ten pounds of lard. Put it in a cellar on a board, laying one piece upon another, put a board on the top, and stones upon the board to firm the lard; when it has lain at least a fortnight in salt, hang it up in a dry place. BACON. Fok one side of a large pig, allow one pound of coarse common salt, the same quantity of coarse brown sugar, two ounces of saltpetre, and two of rock salt finely pounded. Mix them well, and rub it on both sides of the pork, and when all is rubbed in, then lay it upon a wooden table placed slopingly, and put on it a board and weight. Place under it a vessel to catch the brine. Turn it once in two or three days, and baste it with the brine. Let it remain in this way for three weeks, and then hang it up to smoke for twenty-four hours, which will be a sufficient length of time, if the smoke is powerful.

GAME. 159 are tender, and a little before serving, stir in a table-spoon- ful of catsup. When it is wished to dress them with a white sauce, the rabbits are not fried, but stewed in white stock, which is seasoned with white pepper and salt, and thickened with a piece of butter mixed with flour. A few minutes before ser- ving, a little cream is added, and a table-spoonful of lemon pickle. RABBITS SMOTHERED IN ONIONS. Prepare them as before directed, and truss them; thicken a sufficient quantity of white stock, in which boil them with a piece of butter mixed with flour ; season it with salt and pepper, and when it boils, put in the rabbits with plenty of onions cut in quarters. Let them stew till they are tender. Serve them with the onions put all over the rabbits. RAGOUT OF SNIPES Pick six or eight snipes very nicely, but do not wash them ; take out the inside. Roast the birds, and cut off all the meat from the breasts, in thin slices ; pound the bones, legs, and backs in a mortar, and put them into a stew-pan, with the juice of a lemon, a little flour, and some well-seasoned gravy; boil it till it be thick, and well flavoured with the game, then strain it. Cut half a pound of ham into thin long slices, and heat it in a little butter, with two minced shalots; put it, with the breasts of the snipes, into the strained sauce, and let it boil. Pound the inside or trail, with a little salt, spread it over thin bits of toasted bread, and hold it over a hot salamander. Put the ragout upon this, and place the ham round it.

CREAMS, CUSTARDS, &c. 266 CHAPTER XIV. CREAMS, CUSTARDS, JELLIES, AND OTHER SWEET DISHES. RED CURRANT OR PINK CREAM. Pick the currants from the stalks; put them into a jar closely covered, and set it in a pan of cold water ; let it boil for two hours; strain the juice through a sieve, and sweeten it well with pounded loaf sugar. When cold, add a quart of cream to a pint of juice, and beat it with a whisk till thick. Serve in a deep glass dish. ANOTHER RED CURRANT OR PINK CREAM. Squeeze three quarters of a pint of juice from red currants when full ripe; add to it rather more than a quarter of a pound of pounded loaf sugar, and the juice of one lemon ; stir it into a pint and a half of cream, and whisk it till quite thick. Serve it in a glass dish, or in jelly glasses. It may be made with currant jelly, which mix with the lemon juice and sugar. CUSTARD CREAM. Boil, in half a pint of milk, a stick of cinnamon, the peel of a lemon cut thin, two or three laurel leaves, or a few bitter almonds bruised ; strain, and add it to three pints of cream; stir into it the well-beaten yolks of eight eggs; sweeten with pounded loaf sugar, put it into a sauce-pan, and stir it constantly till it thickens, which it will do before it comes to a boil; pour it into a deep dish, and stir it now and then till cold. Serve in a glass dish, or custard cups. RASPBERRY CREAM. Gather the fruit upon a dry day; mash, and drip it through a jelly-bag ; to every pint of juice add a pound of pounded loaf sugar, and when it is completely dissolved, bottle it in pint and half-pint bottles, filling them only to the neck. When to be used, mix it with rich cream, add more sugar, and whisk it till thick. It may be made the day before it is required.

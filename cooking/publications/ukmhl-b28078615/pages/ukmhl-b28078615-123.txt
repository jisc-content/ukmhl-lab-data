Ill CAIJ"S BEAD PLAIN Clean a calfs head nicely, and cut out the bone of the lower jaw, and of the nose, taking out the nose bone as close to the eyes as possible; wash the head well in warm water, and let it blanch in some clean water.

DRESSED CALF'S HEAD. To take the hair off the head, first wash it clean, and put it on the fire with plenty of cold water; let it boil a little time, try if the hair will pull off easily — if not, boil it till it does, then lay it into cold water to blanch; take off the skin, and cut it into bits an inch and a half square; cut what meat is on the head into thin slices, pick out the black part of the eyes, and cut the remainder into rings ; cut the ears like small straws, skin the tongue, and cut it lengthwise, or leave it whole; put the brains carefully upon a plate. Make a sauce of a quart of good gravy, thicken it with butter and flour; season with half the peel of a lemon and the juice, two blades of mace, or grated nutmeg and cayenne ; put in the head, and let it stew till tender; add forcemeat balls, fried brown, a few hard-boiled yolks of eggs, and a glass of white wine. Garnish with brain cakes, made as follow's : — Beat up the brains with a knife; pick out all the skin and strings, mix with them two table-spoonfuls of flour, a grate of lemon-peel, a little white pepper and salt, two eggs, well- beaten, and half a pint of milk ; fry them in butter, dropping them in with a spoon, so as to make them the size of a crown-piece. Lay them before the fire upon the back of a sieve, to drain and brown a little. To make a simple white gravy, that answers very well, take the bones of the head, chopping away the nose; put them into a stew-pan with a quart of water, an onion, some whole pepper, and salt, a little winter savory, and lemon thyme; iet it stew nearly two hours, strain it, put in the prepared head.

CAKES, BISCUITS, &c. 297 CHAPTER XV. CAKES. BISCUITS, AND BREAD. PREPARATORY REMARKS. The currants and raisins should be prepared as directed under the Preparatory Remarks on Puddings, Pies, and Tarts (page 199); and the flour dried before the fire on a large sheet of white paper, then sifted and weighed. Almonds should be blanched by pouring hot water over them, and, after standing some minutes, taking off" the skin, then throw- ing them into rose or cold water. When not pounded, they should be cut lengthwise into thin bits. Sugar should be roughly pounded, rolled with a bottle upon white paper, and then sifted. All spices, after being well dried at the fire, should be finely pounded and sifted. Lemon and orange peel must be pared very thin, and pounded with a little sugar. The butter, after being weighed, should be laid into cold water, or washed in rose water, and if salt, be well washed in several waters. The yolks and whites of eggs should be separately and long beaten, then strained ; two whisks should be kept ex- clusively for that purpose, as the whites especially require to be managed with the greatest care. A horn spoon should be used for mixing those cakes which are not directed to be beaten with the hand. To make cakes light, sal volatile, or smelling salts, may be added immediately before putting them into the oven, allow- ing, to a spunge cake, made of one pound of flour, one tea. spoonful; and two or three to a large plum cake.

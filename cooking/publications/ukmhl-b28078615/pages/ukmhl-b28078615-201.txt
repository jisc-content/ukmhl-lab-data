189 VEGETABLES. A BEAN PUDDING. Take off the skins ; pound the beans in a mortar ; season with salt and pepper ; add a piece of butter ; tie it lightly in a buttered and floured cloth. Put it on in boiling water, and boil it for half an hour ; squeeze the water from the pud- ding-cloth, and if another shape is desired, put the cloth with the pudding into the shape, press it down, and let it stand a few minutes, then place the dish it is to be served in over the shape, and turn it out. ANOTHER BEAN PUDDING. Boil half a pound of blanched beans ; pound them in a mortar along with the crumbs of a new roll soaked in milk ; add two ounces of butter, some salt and pepper, and mix it well with the beaten yolks of four eggs. Boil it in a basin, or bake it in a pudding-dish lined with puff paste. Carrots may be dressed in the same way. TO BOIL FRENCH BEANS. Cut off the stalk, and string them ; if not very young, cut them in four, or into very thin slices ; put them into water as they are done, and put them on in boiling water, with a little salt, and let them boil for half an hour. If they are old, they will require a longer time to boil. Melted butter in a sauce-tureen is served with them. TO BOIL ASPARAGUS. Wash them well, scrape, and tie them up in small bundles ; cut them all even at the bottom, and, as they are done, put them into cold water. Put them on in boiling water, with a little salt, and let them boil twenty or twenty-five minutes. Take them up, lay them upon a slice of toasted bread cut in four, and the crusts pared off, with the tops meeting in the middle of the dish, and cut off the strings. Melted butter is served in a sauce-tureen. Cardoons may be dressed in the same manner. ASPARAGUS A LA FRANCAISE. Boil it, and chop small the heads and tender part of the stalks, together with a boiled onion; add a little salt and pepper, and the beaten yolk of an egg; heat it up. Serve it on sippets of toasted bread, and pour over it a little melted butter.

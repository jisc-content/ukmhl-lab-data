OX-BLOOD PUDDINGS. Let the blood run into a deep pan ; stir it all the time, and when it is nearly cold, throw in a little salt; rub it through a hair sieve ; mix a pint of milk with two quarts of blood. Chop some suet, mix it with minced onion, pepper, salt, and two or three handfuls of oatmeal; then add the blood and milk. To clean the pudding skins, wash them thoroughly, and let them lie a night in salt and water. When they are to be filled, tie one end, and turn the inside out; half fill them, and tie them in rings, or in equal lengths. When the water boils, throw in a little cold, to put it off the boil, and put in the puddings. In five minutes, put them upon a dish, and prick them with a large needle ; return them into the pot, and boil them half an hour. Hang them up in a dry cool place, to keep them. When they are to be used, put them on in hot water for ten or fifteen minutes, and then broil them. MEAL PUDDINGS. Sift a pound of oatmeal, chop three quarters of a pound of suet, mince some onions, and mix all together ; season well with pepper and salt; half fill the skins, and boil and dress them as directed in the receipt for ox-blood puddings.

Half fill the skins, and manage them in the same way as the other puddings. Some persons use double the quantity of suet.

PUDDINGS. PIES, AND TARTS. 265 TO POT CHESHIRE CHEESE. Scrape down three pounds of fine Cheshire or Gloucester cheese; with half a pound of fresh butter, pound it to a paste in a marble mortar, adding a large wine-glass of malm- sey Madeira, or of sherry, and a quarter of an ounce of pounded and sifted mace; when beaten to a paste, press it into a deep pot, and cover it with clarified butter. A thick slice may be served in a napkin to resemble cream cheese. ANCHOVY TOAST. Pare the crust off a slice of bread ; cut it into six or eight bits, fry them in clarified butter, and when cold, spread tipon them two or three anchovies, boned, washed, and pounded to a paste, together with a little fresh butter. ANOTHER WAY TO MAKE ANCHOVY TOAST. Bone and roll up two or three anchovies, place them upon pieces of dry toast, and garnish with curled parsley. BUTTER OF ANCHOVIES. Wash from the pickle some fine young anchovies ; bone, and take off the heads, then pound them in a mortar with fresh butter till quite smooth, and rub it through a sieve.

APPENDIX. A Rule by which any gentleman may be enabled to esta- blish a practical system of domestic economy, according to his income, to detect any error that may have arisen in the management, and to discover at once what part or parts he may best alter, in order to increase or diminish the expense of any other part that may be desired. RULE. Divide the whole annual income, be it what it may, into 100 equal parts, which may be appropriated to the several branches of the establishment in the following proportions, viz. 36 per cent, for provisions and other articles of household expense. 22 per cent, for servants, horses, and carriages. 12 per cent, for clothing, haberdashery, and other incidental expenses of that nature. 8 per cent, for education, pocket, private, and other extra expenses. 12 per cent, for rents, taxes, and repairs of house and furniture. 10 per cent, to be reserved for future contingencies. 100 Total. From these premises is deduced the following Table, by means of which this rule may be adapted to any amount of income, viz. .Annual Income. House Expenses, 36 ^ eent.

VINEGARS. 318 CHAPTER XVII. VINEGARS. A CASK which has not contained vinegar before, should have a quart of boiling hot vinegar poured into it, shaken till cold, and allowed to^ stand for some hours. SUGAR VINEGAR. To five gallons of water, put eight pounds of coarse brown sugar ; let it boil as long as any scum rises, which must be carefully removed ; then pour it into a cask, and when it is about milk-warm, or from 60 to 65 degrees Fahrenheit, cut off the crust, and toast a quarter of a slice of bread, and cover it over with fresh yeast; put it into the cask, leave it open for four or five days, and then paste over the bung-hole a piece of paper, and pierce it here and there with a pin. It should be kept in a warm, dry place, without being moved; and if made in March or April, it may be drawn off and bottled in September, when it may be boiled a quarter of a minute to prevent the mother from forming in the bottles, and it will keep good for years, though it should not be kept from the contact of the air, or in vessels entirely filled. The vinegar cask, as soon as emptied, should be again filled in the same manner. GOOSEBERRY VINEGAR. Gather yellow gooseberries when quite ripe; crush and mash them well in a tub with a large wooden pestle; to every two gallons of gooseberries, after being mashed, put two of water; mix them well together ; let it work for three weeks, stirring the mass two or three times each day; then strain the liquor through a hair-sieve, and put to every gallon one pound of brown sugar, one pound of treacle, and a table- spoonful of fresh yeast; let it work for three or four days in

160 GRAVIES, SAUCES, &c. CHAPTER XL GRAVIES, SAUCES, FORCEMEATS, AND OTHER THINGS. Browning for Made Dishes.— Put into a sauce-pan, one pound of good brown sugar; stir it constantly over a slow fire ; boil it till it is as thick as treacle, and resembles it in colour ; take the pan off the fire, stir it for a minute or two, and pour in very slowly a quart of boiling water, stirring con- stantly; put it again on the fire, and boil it for a little; pour it into a bowl, and when cold, bottle it. This browning will keep good for a year, and very little of it serves for colouring Soups, Gravies, or Sauces. To clarify Butter. — Put the Butter, cut into slices, into a nicely-cleaned brass pan; stir it gently till dissolved ; when it boils, draw the pan to the side of the fire, skim it, and let it boil gently a second time, and if any scum again rises, take it off; let it settle for two or three minutes, and strain it gently through a sieve which has a piece of muslin laid into it. Fresh Beef Suet, picked free from skin and sinews, is dis- solved in the same way ; it is then strained through muslin into small jars, and when cold, covered with bladder ; or it may be strained into cold water, and the cake, when cold, wiped dry, folded in white paper, and kept in a linen bag. Beef Suet wall keep fresh for some time if finely chopped and dredged well with flour, and kept in white paper bags in a cool place. Beef and Mutton Drippings are clarified exactly in the manner butter is done, and each kept in a separate jar. To melt Hog’s Lard, put it into a jar placed in a pot of water, or water bath, strain it into clean bladders or small jars, and cover them with paper. Thus prepared, it w'ill keep a good length of time, and is the best thing for frying fish in.

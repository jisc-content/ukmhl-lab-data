100 LAMB. DRESSED X.AMB CHOPS. Cut the chops off the best end of a neck of lamb ; flatten them, and cut off the skin and fat; dip them into the beaten yolk of an egg, and then into bread crumbs, mixed with minced parsley, pepper, and salt. Fry them in boiling cla- rified beef-suet, and drain them before the fire upon the back of a sieve. Thicken a little gravy with flour and butter; add a table-spoonful of white wine and one of catsup ; make it quite hot; pour it into the dish, and lay in the chops. Garnish with fried parsley. LAMB CUTLETS. Cut the cutlets off the loin, into round bits; trim off the fat and skin; dip them into the beaten yolk of an egg, and then into bread crumbs, mixed with minced parsley, grated nutmeg, and lemon-peel, pepper, and salt. Fry them a light brown in clarified beef suet; drain them on the back of a sieve before the fire. Serve them with melted butter and a little lemon pickle in it, or a brown sauce thickened. Gar- nish with cut lemon. TO DRESS A BREAST OF LAMB. Cut it into pieces, and stew it in weak stock, with a glass of white wine; add pepper and salt. When it is perfectly tender, thicken the sauce with butter and flour. Have cu- cumbers stewed in gravy ready to put over the lamb before serving. A breast of mutton may be served up in the same way.

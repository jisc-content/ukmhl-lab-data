88 PREPARATORY REMARKS. foolscap paper, folded and fringed, should be put round the shank bone. The Haunch, weighing fourteen pounds, will require two hours and a half to roast. Currant jelly sauce should be served with it. When a Leg of Mutton is to be boiled, it should first be washed clean, then put on, in boiling water, and carefully scummed. If weighing eight or nine pounds, it should be boiled nearly three hours, and then served with caper sauce. A saddle or a chine, that is to say, two necks or two loins, a joint, generally called, indifferently, a saddle of mutton, being broad, requires a high and strong fire. The skin should be taken off, and skewered on again, or paper may be sub- stituted for it, tied on with a buttered string. It should be well basted, and a quarter of an hour before serving, the skin or paper removed; it is then allowed to brown a little, is sprinkled with salt, basted, and dredged with flour, served with gravy in the dish, and currant jelly sauce. A Shoulder of Mutton should be rojisted an hour and a half, and served with onion satice, in a sauce tureen. A Loin of Mutton should be carefully jointed, roasted the same length of time as a shoulder, and is carved lengthwise. The best end of a Neck of Mutton should be jointed, and roasted, the same as the loin ; or it may be boiled. If boiled, the skin should be taken off before serving, and caper sauce poured over it. A Breast of Mutton may be parboiled, grilled, and served with onion and caper sauce. Many persons think that every kind of meat should be boiled in a floured cloth, and in the writerâ€™s opinion, this greatly improves its appearance. This, however, does not supersede the necessity of skimming, which, in boiling, should always be carefully attended to.

PRESERVES. 325 CHAPTER XVI. PRESERVES. PREPARATORY REMARKS ON SWEETMEATS. All sweetmeats should be preserved in a brass pan, which must be well scoured with sand and vinegar, washed with hot water, and wiped perfectly dry before it is used. An iron plate or a stove is preferable to a fire for pre- serving on ; and by boiling the fruit quickly, the form, colour, and flavour, will be better preserved, and there will be less waste, than in slow boiling, A round wooden stick, smaller at the one end than the other, in Scotland called a thevil, is better adapted for stirring sugar or preserves with, than a silver spoon, which last is only used for skimming. That there may be no waste in taking off the scum, it is put through a fine silk-sieve, or through a hair-sieve, with a bit of muslin laid into it; the clear part will run into the vessel placed below, and may be returned to the preserving pan. A silver soup ladle is used for putting preserves into the jars, which should be of brown stone, or of white wedgewood ware. After the jellies or preserves are put in, they must not be moved till quite cold, when they are covered with a piece of white paper, cut so as to fit into the jar, and dipped into brandy or rum. They are then stored in a cool dry place, and should be looked at occasionally. If in a few weeks they be observed to ferment, the sirup should be first strained from the fruit, then boiled till it is thick, and again poured over the fruit, previously put into clean jars. Sugar, low in price, and consequently coarse in quality, is far from being cheapest in the end ; while that which it most refined is always the best. White sugars should be chosen as shining and as close in texture as possible.

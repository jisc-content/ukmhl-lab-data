81 BEEF. one or two ba.y leaves, till tender strain the sauce; thicken it with flour and butter. Heat it up, and pour it over the slices of beef. BUBBLE AND SQUEAK. Chop small some boiled white cabbage; season it with pepper and salt, and fry it with a little butter ; pepper and broil some slices of cold boiled salted beef; put the fned cabbage into a dish, and lay round it the slices of broiled beef, and serve it very hot. The beef does best when un- der-done. SALT BEEF PUDDING OR DEBRIS PUDDING. Mash a few boiled potatoes with a little salt, milk, and a good bit of butter ; mince very finely the lean part of some cold boiled salted beef, mix it with the mashed potatoes, and brown it in a Dutch oven in the same way that a salt-fish pudding is done. This pudding may be made of the remains of a piece of boiled beef, allowing to one pound of the beef one pound and a qviarter of potatoes. TO CURE HUNG BEEF. B UB a small quantity of salt on eight ribs of the thin part of the beef, and let it lie three days ; pound two ounces of saltpetre, and two ounces of very brown sugar, and rub it well into the beef; turn it every day, and if it become slimy, strew over it a little common salt, but let it be very little ; lay it upon a sloping board, that the brine may run off. Let it lie a fortnight, and hang it up to dry, but not too near the fire, nor in a warm kitchen, as it would then soon grow rancid. BEEF OR niUTTON BAKED WITH POTATOES. Boil some potatoes ; peel, and pound them in a mortar, with one or two small onions ; moisten them with milk and an egg beaten up ; add a little salt and pepper. Season slices of beef, or mutton chops, with salt and pepper, and more onion, if the flavour is approved; rub the bottom of a pud- ding-dish with butter, and put a layer of the mashed potatoes, which should he as thick as a batter, and then a layer of meat, and so on alternately till the dish is filled, ending with potatoes. Bake it in an oven for one hour.

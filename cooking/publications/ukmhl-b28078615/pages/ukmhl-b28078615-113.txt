101 VEAL. CHAPTER VI. VEAL. The names of the joints are as follows ; — IN ENGLAND. Loin, best end— Loin, chump end — Fillet— Hind Knuckle — Fore Knuckle—Neck, best end—Neck, scrag end — Blade Bone — Breast, best end — Breast, brisket end. IN SCOTLAND. The Loin, Fillet, and Knuckle — Back Ribs — Breast, Neck, and Head. In Scotland, the Veal seldom exceeds four weeks old, there- fore it is not cut into so many divisions as is the practice in England, where it is often eight weeks old. The En- trails are named the Pluck, which consists of the Heart, Liver, Lights, Nut, Melt, and Skirts, the Throat, Wind- pipe, and Sweetbreads. PREPARATORY REMARKS ON VEAL. Veal should be fine in the grain, firm, white, and fat, and the leg bone small. The finest Calves have the smallest kidney, and its being well covered with thick white fat, indi- cates good veal. The fillet of a cow calf is to be preferred, on account of the udder. The prime joints are the Fillet, the Loin, the chump end of the Loin, and the best end of the Neck. To keep it, the same directions may be followed, which are given for keeping beef. When the Fillet is to be roasted, it should be washed, well dried, and the bone taken out, the space filled with a fine stuffing, part of which should be put under the flap.

268 CREAMS, CUSTARDS, &c. HONEYCOIYIB CREAM Mix, in a glass or china dish, the strained juice of three lemons with half a pound of pounded and sifted loaf sugar. Put about a quart of good cream into a tea-pot, place the dish upon the floor, and pour the cream very slowly over the sugar and lemon juice, holding the tea-pot as high as pos- sible, so as to froth the cream. At table it should be well stirred before it is helped. COFFEE CREAM. Put two handfuls of fresh-burnt coffee, while hot, into a quart of boiling new milk ; cover it closely for three or four hours ; strain, sweeten it with pounded loaf sugar, and add the well-beaten yolks of eight eggs ; strain it again, and put it into custard-cups, which place in a sauce-pan of boiling water, to remain till they become firm. ANOTHER WAY TO MAKE COFFEE CREAM. Dissolve half an ounce of isinglass ; boil it with a quart of cream, and mix with it about a pint of very strong coffee; sweeten it well with pounded white sugarcandy ; whisk it for a few minutes, and serve it in custard-cups. It may be perfumed with a tea-spoonful of the essence of the cedrat fruit. SOLID CREAM. Squeeze the juice of a large lemon upon three or four table-spoonfuls of pounded loaf sugar ; add two table-spoon- fuls of brandy, and one pint of cream ; pour it from one cup into another, till it be sufficiently thick. ITALIAN CREAM. Mix with the well-beaten yolks of four eggs, a table- spoonful of flour, a little salt, half the grated peel of a lemon, and a pint of milk ; sweeten with pounded loaf sugar, beat it quite smooth, put it into a sauce-pan, and stir it constantly till it thickens ; then put some into the bottom of a dish, and put in a layer of spunge-cake dipped in white wine, and another layer of the cream, till all is in the dish ; cover the top with a thick snow froth, and brown it with a hot shovel. The snow froth is made with the white of a new-laid egg well beaten, with a little sifted loaf sugar.

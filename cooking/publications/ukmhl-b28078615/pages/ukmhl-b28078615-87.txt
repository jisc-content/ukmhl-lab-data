75 BEEF. BUTCH BEEF. Rub on a beef heart two ounces of common salt, half an ounce of saltpetre, an ounce and a half of coarse brown sugar, and a little bay salt; turn and rub it every day for nine days, then hang it in the kitchen to dry, when it will become (]uite hard. When required for use, cut off a small bit, boil, and when cold, grate it. It may be served with curled but- ter over it. SCOTS COU.OFS. Cut any piece of tender lean beef into slices ; beat them ; brown some butter and flour in a sauce-pan; put in the beef, with some salt, pepper, and a finely-minced onion â€” half a minced apple is an improvement; add a little hot water; cover the pan closely, and let them stew till tender. ANOTHER WAY TO MAKE SCOTS COLLOPS. Cut some very thin slices of beef; rub with butter the bottom of an iron stew-pan that has a cover to fit quite closely; put in the meat, some pepper, and a little salt, a large onion, and an apple minced very small. Cover the stew-pan, and let it simmer till the meat is very tender. Serve it hot. BEEF RISSOLES. Chop finely a pound of lean tender beef, and a quarter of a pound of beef-suet; pound them in a marble mortar; mix with it a quarter of a pound of grated bread, a little onion, and a head of garlic bruised ; season with salt and pepper ; bind it with three eggs well beaten ; make it up into small cakes; fry them of a light brown, then stew them in gravy for fifteen or twenty minutes. TO STEW A TONGUE. Wash it very clean, and rub it well with common salt and a little saltpetre; let it lie two or three days, and then boil it till the skin w ill pull off. Put it into a sauce-pan, with part of the liquor it has been boiled in, and a pint of good stock. Season with black and Jamaica pepper, and two or three pounded cloves ; add a glass of white wine and a table- spoonful of mushroom catsup, and one of lemon pickle; thicken the sauce with butter rolled in flour, and pour it over the tongue.

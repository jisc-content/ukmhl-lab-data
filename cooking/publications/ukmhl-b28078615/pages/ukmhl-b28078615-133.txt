121 VEAL. A GRXINADE. Pu r alternately into a small potting pan or jar, a layer of each of the following ingredients : â€” Vermicelli, ham, hard- boiled yolks of eggs, veal, and highly-seasoned forcemeat, all finely pounded, excepting the vermicelli, which is merely boiled. Cover the pan, and bake it in an oven from one to two hours ; when turned out, pour over it some rich brown gravy, and garnish with mushrooms, cut lemon, or truffles and morels. POTATO PATTIES. Wash and scrape off the rind of four or five large pota- toes ; cut off the top, and scrape out the inside ; mix a part of it with a little pounded veal and ham v add a little cream, nutmeg, lemon-peel, salt, and pepper, and a little mushroom catsup. Put this mixture into the patties, put on the top, and place them upright in a pudding dish, with a little butter in the bottom of it; bake them in an oven. A little bit cut off the bottom of each will make them stand even. FROGS. Having cut off the feet and the body, so as to have scarcely more than the legs, put them into boiling water, and let them boil a little ; next, put them into fresh water, and then drain them ; put them into a sauce-pan with some mushrooms, a bunch of parsley, cibol, a clove of garlic, two cloves and a bit of butter ; give them two or three turns on the fire, and add a dust of flour, moisten them with a glass of white wine and a little gravy; season with salt and pepper; let them boil a quarter of an hour, and thicken the sauce w ith the yolks of three eggs, a little cream, and a pinch of finely-minced parsley ; let it thicken without boiling it. This is given as a national dish.

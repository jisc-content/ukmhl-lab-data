PRESERVES. 342 strew half of it over the fruit; let it remain some hours, and, with the remainder of the sugar, put it into ^ preserving-pan; boil till the plums look quite clear, take off the scum as it rises, and, a few minutes before taking them off the fire, add the kernels. APPLE JELL7. Pare and cut into slices eighteen large acid apples; boil them in as much water as will cover them; when quite soft, dip a coarse cloth into hot water, wring it dry, and strain the apples through it; to each pint of juice allow fourteen ounces of fine loaf sugar, clarify it, and add, with the apple juice, the peel of a large lemon; boil it till it jellies, which may be in twenty minutes; pick out the lemon-peel, and immediately put it into jars. ANOTHER WAY TO MAKE APPLE JELLY. Pare and mince three dozen of juicy acid apples ; put them into a pan, cover them with water, and boil them till very soft; strain them through a thin cloth or flannel bag; allow a pound of loaf sugar to a pint of juice; clarify and boil it; add the apple juice with the grated peel and juice of six le- mons ; boil it for twenty minutes; take off the scum as it rises. GOOSEBERRY CHEESE. Top and tail some red gooseberries ; put them into a jar, tie it over, and boil it in a pan of water, till the fruit will easily pulp through a fine hair-sieve; allow a quarter of a pound of loaf sugar to a pint of the juice; stir, boil, and skim it for twenty minutes; put it into saucers or small plates, dry it before the fire, and when dry, keep it between folds of white paper. TO KEEP CURRANTS FOR TARTS. Gather the fruit perfectly dry, and before it be too ripe, pick it from the stalks, and put it into clean, dry, wide- mouthed bottles; if the flavour of raspberries is approved, some may be added with the currants; tie tightly over each bottle a piece of sound bladder previously soaked in water; set them into a pan of cold water, with a little straw at the bottom, and a little between the bottles; put them on the fire, and when they begin to simmer, keep them in that state about three quarters of an hour, but they must not be allowed to boil; take the pan off the fire; the bladders will be raised, but will fall soon after, and sink into the mouth of the bottles;

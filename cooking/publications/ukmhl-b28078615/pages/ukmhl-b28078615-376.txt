PREPARATORY REMARKS. 364 nine eggs, is sufficient for fifty gallons of wine : whichever of these is employed, it is first diluted in a portion of the wine, and then strongly agitated with the whole. In about ten days, when the wine has become clear, it is again drawn offi. Instead of the common method of sulphuring, the sulphate of potash is to be preferred, which may be used in the pro- portion of a drachm to a pipe of liquor, or the oxymuriate of potash, which is more easily procured. Dry, cold weather ought to be selected for racking. Various kinds of wine, not to be distinguished from those of foreign growth, can in this country be made from grapes, and at a moderate expense ; their being ripe is not a neces- sary circumstance ; they may be used in any state, however immature, the quantity of sugar being proportionally in- creased. Where the vine is largely cultivated, the thinnings may be used, as various kinds of grapes, and of different degrees of ripeness, may be mixed together. In situations where the vine may not produce even unripe fruit, the ten- drils and leaves may be used, as they possess properties similar to the green fruit; the leaves of the claret vine pro- duce wine of a delicate red colour. Yeast should never be employed in making wine from native fruits. The deficiency of tartar in them, which in the grape promotes fermentation, may be supplied by the addition of cream of tartar, or, what is still better, crude tartar. Should the fermentation be slow, or appear as if it would not occur at all, no impatience need be felt on the subject: it will not finally be less effectual, because it has been more tedious. Attention to the temperature will commonly be sufficient. The cask may also be frequently stirred, or the filling up of the cask omitted, so that the scum^ or head, mav be com- pelled to remain in the liquor.

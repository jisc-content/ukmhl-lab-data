BREWING. 421 CHAPTER XXII. BREWING. PREPARATORY REMARKS. The utensils must be large in proportion to the extent of the brewing to be carried on ; in most families that point is determined by the size of the washing copper. For two kinds of beer, namely, nine gallons of one sort (ale), and nine gal- lons of another sort (table beer), the capacity of the copper should not be less than thirteen gallons. The size of the tub must be adapted to the mode of brewing to be pursued. If it is proposed to mash only twice, its capacity should be eighteen gallons ; it ought to be narrower at top than at bottom. Two- third parts of any broad-bottomed cask will do very well for carrying on the operations of mashing in the small way. A metal cock is preferable to a wooden. For coolers, common washini-tubs will do tolerably well. For each firkin (nine gallons) of liquor to be brewed (con- taining ale and beer together), let these tubs contain on the whole fourteen gallons; if the number can be conveniently increased, it will expedite the cooling process. For a brewing of eighteen gallons, whether of the same or different liquors, one sixteen and one twelve-gallon tub are required, the larger tub being intended to serve in the three-fold capacity of re- ceiver, cooler, and gyle-tun. The tub intended to serve as underback, or receiver of the running wort from the mash- tub, ought to have its capacity divided into gallons ; it may be done by notches cut in the surface, or small nails driven into the wood. A few pails should also be ready at hand. A gyle-tun ought properly to be narrow in proportion to its depth ; but a cask of any shape, simply deprived of its head.

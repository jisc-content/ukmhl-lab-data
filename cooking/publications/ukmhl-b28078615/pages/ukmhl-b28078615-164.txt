152 GAME. CHAPTER X. GAME. PREPARATORY REMARKS ON GAME. In choosing Venison, the fat of that which is good is thick, clear, and bright; the clift part smooth and close. When the venison is perfectly fresh, it is hung in a cool place, and carefully wiped dry every day. When extreme tenderness is required from long keeping, but without its having a high flavour, it is well rubbed over with powdered charcoal. The Haunch is the prime joint, and when it is required to be roasted, it is first well washed in lukewarm milk and wa- ter, and then made quite dry before it is spitted. It is then covered with a sheet of well-buttered white paper, over which is laid a coarse paste of flour and water, about a quarter of an inch thick; this is again covered with buttered white paper, and tied on with packthread, A substantial fire being made, the Haunch is put down, and constantly basted with fresh beef dripping, till nearly done, when the paste is taken off, the meat well basted with butter, and lightly dredged with flour, till it froths and becomes of a fine light brown colour. It is served with its own gravy in the dish, if there be enough of it; also a sauce tureen of good brown gravy, and one of currant jelly sauce beat up, and melted with a little port wine and sugar. A large haunch takes about four hours to roast. A Neck and Shoulder, when roasted, is managed in the same way as the Haunch, omitting the paste ; but it is more frequently used for soups, pasties, and collops.

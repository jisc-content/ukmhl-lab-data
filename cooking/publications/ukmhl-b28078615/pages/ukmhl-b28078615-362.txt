350 VINEGARS. a fortnight, then filter, and bottle it for use. Two tea-spoon- fuls of this vinegar improves salad sauce, fish and sauce also, and is good in most made dishes. ELDER FLOWER AND TARRAGON VINEGAR. Fill a quart bottle with the flowers of elder, or the leaves of tarragon, when it is in flower ; pour vinegar upon them, and let them infuse for a fortnight; then strain it through a flannel bag, and put it into small bottles. By the same means, vinegar may be flavoured with the fresh-gathered leaves of any sweet herb. VINEGAR FROM THE REFUSE OF RAISIN WINE. On the raisins from which ten gallons of wine has been made, five gallons of nearly boiling water is poured, the dregs or lees, and stalks, are added; it is then covered up, and stirred occasionally. When the taste is completely extracted from the fruit, it is squeezed, and the vinegar strained and put into a cask, in which it should remain nine or ten months. VINEGAR FROM HONEY. Half a pound of honey must be put to a pint of water, and the honey well dissolved. This mixture is then exposed to the greatest heat of the sun, without closing wholly the bung-hole of the cask, which must be merely covered with coarse linen, to prevent the admission of insects. In about six weeks, the liquor becomes acid, and changes to a very strong vinegar, and of excellent quality.

202 PUDDINGS, PIES, AND TARTS. ANOTHER PUFF PASTE Make nearly all the flour into a stiff paste with cold water; knead it well, and divide it into two ; roll out each piece rather more than a quarter of an inch thick ; take the butter out of the water, and with the hands put it out into a cake or flat piece; flour one piece of the paste, lay on it the butter, which is then floured and covered with tlie other piece of paste ; flatten it a little with the rolling-pin, and then roll it out, dusting the paste and the pin with flour before and after rolling ; fold in the sides, roll it up, and repeat the rolling out, folding up, and dusting with flour, till the butter is in- corporated thoroughly with the paste. Puff paste, if good, will rise into blisters in the course of rolling it out; it may be made with three quarters of a pound of butter to one of flour ; the flour should be dried, and is the better for being sifted. When the paste is rolled out for the last time, and made a quarter of an inch thick, place upon it the dish to be covered ; and having dipped the paste- cutter into flour, run it round by the rim ; the cover being thus cut, lay it aside, and cut a border for the rim of the dish ; wet it with water, and lay on the border, brush it over with a little water, and put on the cover ; ornament it with the paste-cutter, notching it all round the edge ; make a hole in the middle, take a small bit of paste, roll it out as thin as paper, dust it with flour, and fold it in four, pinch, or gather it round, wet it, and put it into the opening in the pie, which must also be wetted ; cut it twice across, and with the knife turn out the folds to resemble leaves : this ornament is for meat pies â€” those of fruit have merely a small hole made in the centre. PASTE FOR CHEESE CAKES. Rub equal quantities of flour and butter together, with a little pounded and sifted loaf sugar; make it into a paste with warm milk, roll it out, and line the pans with it. CRISP PASTE. Rub a quarter of a pound of butter into a pound of flour; add two table-spoonfuls of pounded loaf sugar, and the well- beaten yolks of two or three eggs ; work it well with a horn spoon, and roll it out very thin, touching it as little as pos- sible with the hands; the moment before putting it into a quick oven, rub it over with the well-beaten white of an egg, and sift all over the tart finely pounded sugar. This crust may be used for any fruit tarts.

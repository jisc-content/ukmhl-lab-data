CURRIES. 148 CHAPTER IX. CURRIES. CURRZE. Cut a fowl into small pieces, skin it, and let it blanch in cold water for two hours; mince an onion very small, and put it into a sauce-pan, with two ounces of butter, and a large table-spoonful of flour of rice stirred in by degrees ; brown it well, and when just boiling, add a quart of cold water, with the pieces of fowl and a large table-spoonful of currie powder mixed in it. Let it boil till the fowl be quite tender, and just before serving, squeeze the juice of half a lemon over the blade of a hot knife into it. Vinegar will an- swer instead of the juice; and if it be required very fine, in place of rice, thicken it with an ounce of sweet almonds blanched and pounded. CURRIE OF VEAL. Cut part of a neck of veal into cutlets, and make a gravy of the trimmings ; season it with pepper, salt, and an onion ; strain and thicken it with flour and butter, and add two spoonfuls of curry powder. Fry the cutlets with an onion minced very small, in butter, of a light brown colour, and then stew them in the prepared gravy till they become quite tender. Before serving, add the juice of half a lemon, and a little Chili pepper. A DRY CURRIE. Skin and cut a fowl into joints, or take off small cutlets from the best end of a neck of veal; fry in butter three or tour minced onions, and drain them ; then fry the fowl or veal, and dust it with three tea-spoonfuls of currie powder, and a quarter of a tea-spoonful of cayenne. Put the fried meat and onions into a stew-pan, with a little salt, half a pint of milk, and the same quantity of water ; keep the pan closely covered, and let it stew till perfectly tender, and ten minutes before serving, add two tea-spoonfuls of lemon juice.

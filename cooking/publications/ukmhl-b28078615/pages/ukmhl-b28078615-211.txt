199 PUDDINGS, PIES, AND TARTS. CHAPTER XIII. PUDDINGS, PIES, AND TARTS. PREPARATORY REMARKS. Great nicety is to be observed in preparing every material used for boiled or baked Puddings. The eggs require to be vrell beaten; for which purpose, if many are to be done, a whisk is used; if few, a three-pronged fork. The flour is dried and sifted. The currants are care- fully cleaned, by putting them into a cullender, and pouring warm water over them ; if very dirty, this is to be repeated two or three times, and after being dried in a dish before the fire, they are rubbed in a clean coarse cloth, all the stjilks and stones picked out, and then a little flour dredged over them. Or, after being washed and dried, and the stones picked out, they may be put into a cullender, some flour dredged over them, and then rubbed, till all the stalks go through the cullender. The raisins are stoned with a small sharp- pointed knife ; it is cleansed in a basin of water, which also receives the seed. The Pudding-cloth must be kept espe- cially clean, or it will impart an unpleasant taste to any thing that is boiled in it; and when taken off a pudding, it ought immediately to be laid into cold water, and afterwards well washed with soda or pearl-ashes in hot water. Just before being used for a rice, bread, or batter pudding, it should be dipped into hot water, wrung, shaken, and well dredged with flour; and for a plumb, suet pudding, or any sort of fruit pudding in paste, it must be buttered before being floured. All Puddings in Paste are tied tightly, but other puddings loosely, in the cloth. When a pudding is to be boiled in a shape, a piece of buttered white paper is put upon the top

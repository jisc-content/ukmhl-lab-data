Let them stew, closely covered, till the peas are soft. TO DRESS DRIED FRENCH BEANS. Boil for more than two hours, in two quarts of water, a pound of the seeds or beans of scarlet runners; fill a pint basin with onions peeled and sliced; brown them in a sauce- pan, with rather more than a quarter of a pound of fresh but- ter ; stir them constantly; strain the water from the beans, and mix them with the onions ; add a tea-spoonful of black pepper, some salt, and a little gravy. Let them stew for ten minutes, and stir in the beaten yolks of two eggs, and a table-spoonful of vinegar. Serve them hot. TO DRESS CARDOONS. Choose a few heads of nice white cardoons; cut the leaves into pieces of six inches long, rejecting those that are hollow; take off their prickles, and throw the thickest pieces into boiling water; after these have boiled a little, put in the more tender leaves and the stalks. When it is ascertained, by trying a little piece in cold water, that the surface slime will come off by rubbing, take them immediately offâ€™ the fire, and mix in as much cold water as will admit of the hands being held in it ; then rub off all the slime, and throw the cardoons into a stew-pan, with some good gravy, a little salt, and a little sugar. Boil them over a quick fire, skim them carefully, strain the sauce through a sieve, pour it over them, and serve them quite hot. SKIRRET8. Wash and scrape them, put them on in boiling water, and boil them for ten minutes ; dry them in a cullender, and fry them brown in a little butter. They are sometimes plain boiled, and a little melted butter poured over them. TRUFFLES. Put some fresh truffles into warm water ; brush and rub out all the dirt, and wash them perfectly clean ; put them into a sauce-pan full of cold water, with two or three bay leaves, a bunch of sweet herbs, two onions, twelve cloves, a little allspice, salt, two or three blades of mace, and a gill of vinegar ; boil them slowly for two hours. Drain, and serve them in a napkin.

VI PREFACE. ■vvho live in towns, but whose circumstances are so limited, that, with all the disposition in the world to learn the art of Cookery, they have no means of putting such costly lessons in practice. It is hoped that such criticisms will not apply to this work: as the author has used every effort of industry and patience, to ai’iive at the truth, and to impart it clearly and forcibly to others, so that correct knowledge and judicious economy might go hand in hand, in this important branch of housekeeping. NOTE TO THE FOHRTEENTH EDITION. Every Receipt in this Work has again been carefully revised for the present Edition, in order that advantage might be taken of the numerous valuable criticisms by which it has been honoured in all parts of the Empire. Besides numerous additional Receipts entirely new, a considerable number of improvements have been intro- duced into many of the others; all of these the Editor has had adequate means of ascertaining to be valuable, —a principle which has been scrupulously adhered to throughout.

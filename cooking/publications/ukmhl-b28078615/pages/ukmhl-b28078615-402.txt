390 MISCELLANY. TO CLEAN DECANTERS. Roll up, in small pieces, some coarse brown paper or blotting-paper; wet and soap them, and put them into the decanter, with a little pearl-ashes ; fill in some lukewarm water, shake it well for a few minutes, or, if very dirty, let them stand some hours ; then rinse the decanters with clean cold water. If this does not remove the crust of wine which may be at the bottom, use stable litter, with which nearly half fill the decanter, adding some cold water, and let it re- main for several hours; shake it well, and rinse with clean cold water till perfectly clean.

If the frames be varnished, great care must be taken not to touch them with the spunge, or with any thing damp. To clean the frames, take a little cot- ton wool, and rub them with it. Pictures should be rubbed lightly with cotton wool, or brushed with a feather brush. TO CLEAN HATS. When a hat gets wet, wipe it as dry as may be with a cloth or silk handkerchief, then brush it with a soft brush; when it gets nearly dry, use a harder brush ; and if the fur

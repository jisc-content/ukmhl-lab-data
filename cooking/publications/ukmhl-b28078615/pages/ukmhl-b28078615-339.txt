PRESERVES. 327 ORANGE IVIARIMCALADE. Allow equal weight of bitter oranges and fine loaf sugar , wash the oranges, wipe them dry, and grate off any disco- loured part; cut the rind in half, and with a dessert-spoon loosen it all round to take off each of the halves entire ; take the core and seeds clean from the oranges, leaving the juice with the pulp ; put the skin into a sauce-pan with plenty of cold water, and cover it closely with a cloth underneath the cover; let them boil for some hours, till so tender that the head of a pin will easily pierce them ; drain off the water, and while they are hot, with a silver spoon scoop out all the soft part, leaving the skins quite thin ; cut them into thin parings half an inch long; clarify and boil the sugar candy high; put in the parings, and in ten minutes add the juice and pulp, and boil idl together till transparent. Part of the peel may be grated to heighten the colour, and a pound and a half of sugar to the pound of oranges may be used. ANOTHER WAY TO MAKE ORANGE MARMALADE.

ANOTHER WAY TO MAKE ORANGE MARMALADE. Wash the oranges, and grate off any defective part; to three pounds of fruit, allow five of fine loaf sugar; put the oranges into a sauce-pan with plenty of cold water; cover it closely, and let them boil till a straw or the head of a pin will easily pierce them ; take them out, cut them into four, pick out the seeds, and slice them, skin and all, as thin as possible; break the sugar small, and to each pound allow a quarter of a pint of water; stir it till the sugar be dissolved, and when it has boiled a few minutes, take it off the fire; pour in a quarter of a pint of cold water, which will throw up all the refuse; scum it off; put it again on the fire, and if any more

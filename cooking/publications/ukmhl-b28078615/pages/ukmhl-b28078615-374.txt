DOMESTIC WINES, &c. 862 CHAPTER XVIII. WINES. PREPARATORY REMARKS UPON DOMESTIC WINES. All Wines are reducible to four general divisions, of dry and strong ; sweet; light and flavoured ; and brisk. When a dry wine is desired, the liquor is suffered to remain in the vat for throe, four, or more days, according to circumstances; and a cask is provided for it sufficiently large to prevent the yeast from escaping at the bung-hole. To make a sweet wine, the fermentation must be discouraged by speedily re- moving it from the vat to the cask, which is carefully filled as the fluid subsides, and by frequent racking or sulphuring, or by both. To produce a light-flavoured wine, similar to Burgundy, the fluid is allowed to remain from six to twenty hours in the vat; and, for wines to resemble Champagne, it is necessary the juice should remain in the vat but a few hours. Where small quantities are operated upon, the fer- mentation may be begun in the cask, the mask or mash being previously strained ; for in no case should solid matter be introduced into the cask. The wine is strongest when the fermentation has been partially carried on in close ves- sels ; and the flavour is also better preserved. To have a wine resembling Champagne, a partially close mode of fer- mentation is adopted. For rich and strong sweet wines, the whole fermentation may be carried on openly ; but, in all cases, it seems a useful practice to cover the vat with boards and blankets. The fermentation is much sooner completed in a large than in a small vessel. The sw'eeter and thicker juices require to be treated on a larger scald than the thinner ones. It is easy to make lemon wine in a cask of two gal- lons ; but it is a very difficult task to operate on so small a

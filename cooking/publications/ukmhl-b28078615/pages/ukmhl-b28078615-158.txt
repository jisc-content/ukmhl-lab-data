146 POULTRY. EGGS A I.A TRIPE. Cut into thick round slices a dozen of hard-boiled eggs, and put them into the following sauce : â€” Cut three large white onions into dice, fry them white in butter, and when nearly done, dust them with flour, and moisten them with some milk and a few spoonfuls of cream ; keep stirring with a wooden spoon to prevent their burning. When the sauce is done, grate in a little nutmeg, season with a little salt and pepper, and put in the eggs. GXJVSS EGGS. Butter a dish, and break into it a piece of butter nearly as large as an egg; add a tea-cupful of cream, and drop in four or live eggs; put upon each a little pepper and salt, set the dish upon a stove, and serve it when the eggs are firm, which may be in ten or fifteen minutes.

That the fire may be clear and strong, it should be made up some tirrie before putting down the roast, which should at first be placed at some distance from it, and be frequently and well basted with butter. When about half roasted, a piece of white paper is tied over the fat; a little before serving, it is re- moved ; the meat is then sprinkled with salt, dredged with flour, and well basted to froth it. When dished, finely- melted butter is poured over it, with which may or may not be mixed some lemon pickle or brown gravy. It is garnished with cut lemon. A Fillet weighing ten or fourteen pounds requires four hours to roast. The Loin will take about three hours to roast; and is basted, the fat covered with paper, and served like the Fillet. A slice of thin toasted bread is also served with it, on which the carver should lay a part of the kidney fat, and sprinkle it with salt and pepper. A Shoulder stuffed with forcemeat will take from two to three hours to roast. The best end of the Neck may be roasted or boiled : if boiled, melted butter, made thick with parsley, is poured over it. A Knuckle of Veal may be boiled and served in the same way. Pickled pork, ham, bacon, tongue, or sausages, is the ge- neral accompaniment to roasted or boiled Veal. VEAL COLLARED WHITE. Bone a breast of veal; chop and strew over it some finely- chopped sweet herbs ; make a forcemeat of beef suet, grated bread, lemon-peel, a small onion pounded ; season with white pepper, grated nutmeg, and salt; pound it in a marble mor- tar, and lay it thickly over the veal; roll it up firmly, sew it in a cloth, and boil it for three hours. The sweetbread is to be boiled, sliced, and laid round the dish. For gravy, boil the bones and parings of the veal with a bunch of parsley.

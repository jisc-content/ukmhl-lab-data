326 PRESERVES. Tlie best sort of brown sugar has a bright and gravelly ap- pearance. A jelly-bag is made of half a square of flannel folded by the corners, and one side sewed up ; the top bound with tape, and four loops also of tape sewed on, so as to hang upon a stand made of four bars of wood, each thirty-six inches in height, fastened with four bars at the top, each measuring ten inches, with hooks upon the corners. Twelve inches from the bottom four more bars are placed. A pan or basin is put underneath, to receive the juice or jelly as it drops through the bag. TO CLARIFY SUGAR. To every three pounds of loaf sugar, zillow the beaten white of one egg, and a pint and a half of water; break the sugar small, put it into a nicely-cleaned brass pan, and pour the water over it; let it stand some time before it be put upon the fire ; then add the beaten whites of the e^s ; stir it till the sugar be entirely dissolved, and when it boils up, pour in a quarter of a pint of cold water; let it boil up a second time ; take it off the fire, and let it settle for fifteen minutes; carefully take off all the scum ; put it on the fire, and boil it till sufficiently thick, or, if required, till candy high, in order to ascertain which, drop a little from a spoon into a small jar of cold water, and if it become quite hard, it is then sufficiently done; or dip the thevil into the sugar, plunge it into cold water, draw off the sugar which adheres to the stick, and if it be hard, and snaps, the fruit to be pre- served must be instantly put in and boiled. TO BOIL SUGAR. To every pound of sugar, allow half a pint of water ; stir it over the fire till the sugar be entirely dissolved; when it first boils up, pour in a little cold water, and when it boils a second time, take it off the fire; let it settle ten minutes, carefully scum it, and boil it for half an hour or a little longer, and then put in the frnit. f k ir I n i' t ' I â€˜ hi"

FISH. 51 jar, and pour over them in the proportion of a pint of vinegar to two of water-, with half an ounce of whole black pepper ; tie over the jar a piece of bladder or paper, and bake them in an oven for an hour. Take off the cover when they are cold, and pour over them a little cold vinegar, and tie them up. SOFT ROES OF HERRINGS IN CASES. Rub butter over a round or square paper-case : its size must be according to the dish it is to be served in. Boil eight very fresh, soft-roed herrings ; when done, take out the roes carefully, and put them whole into the case ; sprinkle them over with a little pepper, salt, grated bread, and finely- chopped parsley. Put some little bits of butter here and there upon them, and bake them in a hot oven. When done, put a little “ Maitre d’Hotel Sauce Maigre” into the case with the juice of a lemon. Serve them quite hot and firm. TO SALT HERRINGS. Cut them open carefully, separating the guts from the milts and roes; throw away the milts, and leave the roes in the fish ; w'ash them, and then put them into a brine, strong enough to bear an egg; let them lie in that from twelve to sixteen hours ; take them out and drain them well. In the bottom of a keg or jar, strew a good deal of salt; lay a row of herrings, and then sprinkle over them more salt, and re- peat this till all are packed. Cover the top with salt, and stop it very closely, to exclude the air. When to be dressed, put them on in cold water, and when it boils let them boil for ten minutes. Serve them witli mashed potatoes. TO SMOIIE HERRINGS. Lay them in salt and a little saltpetre for ten or twelve hours, and follow the same directions as for smoking Finnan Haddocks— (See page 48.) TO BROIL SPRATS. Clean them well; dredge them slightly with flour, and put them in rows upon small skewers run through the heads ; or they may be fried like herrings, and served hot and hot. Sauce: — Melted butter, with catsup, soy, and lemon pickle, a spoonful of each, in it.

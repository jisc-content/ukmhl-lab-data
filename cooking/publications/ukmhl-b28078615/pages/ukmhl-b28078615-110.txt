98 LAMB. CHAPTER V. LAMB. PREPARATORY REMARKS ON LAMB. The Fore Quarter of Lamb consists of the Shoulder, the Neck, and the Breast together ; the Hind Quarter is the Leg and Loin. There are also the Head and Pluck, the Fry or Sweetbreads, Skirts, and Liver. In choosing the Fore Quarter, the vein in the neck should be ruddy, or of a bluish colour. In the Hind Quar- ter, the knuckle should feel stiff, the kidneys small, and perfectly fresh. To keep it, the joints should be carefully wiped every day, and, in warm weather, sprinkled with a little pepper. The Fore Quarter is the prime joint, and should be roasted and basted with butter ; the gravy is made as for beef or mutton. Mint sauce is served in a sauce- tureen, and half a lemon is sent to table Avith it, the juice of which is squeezed upon the ribs, after the shoulder is cut off, and they have been sprinkled with salt. If the joint weighs five pounds, it will require to be roasted one hour ; if ten pounds, one hour and three quarters. The Hind Quarter may be roasted, or the Leg of it boiled. The Loin is then cut into steaks, fried, and served round it; the out- side bones being covered with a fringe of fried parsley. A dish of spinach is generally served with Lamb.

PREFACE. This Volume contains a Complete System of Practical Cookery, so carefully adapted to the purposes of every-day life, that although a person totally unacquainted with the art here treated of may not be able at first to dress a dinner, merely by referring to this book, any Cook or House- keeper, possessed of ordinary experience, will certainly have the means of knowing, without further help than what these pages afford, how to prepare, in the best manner, every dish at pre- sent in general use. There are Twenty-five Chapters in all, ar- ranged in the order of the following List, each of which is preceded by those useful Preparatory Remarks, which are usually kept at the begin- ning of the volume, at a most inconvenient dis- tance from the subject treated of. This is often embarrassing; and, it is believed, the novelty in arrangement here adopted, will be found advantageous to all parties concerned.

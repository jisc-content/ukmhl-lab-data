PICKLES. 351 PICKLES. PRKPARATORY REMARKS ON PICKLES. Pickles ought to be stored in a dry place, and the vessels most approved of for keeping them in, are wide-mouthed glass bottles, or strong stoneware jars, having corks or bungs, which must be fitted in with linen, and covered with bladder or leather ; and for taking the pickles out and returning them to the jar, a small wooden spoon is kept. The strongest vinegar is used for pickling; that of white wine is more par- ticularly recommended, but sugar vinegar will generally be found sufficiently strong. It is essential to the excellence and beauty of pickles, that they be always completely covered with vinegar. TO PICKLE GHERKINS. Gather, upon a dry day, some small cucumbers or gher- kins ; lay them into cold salt and water for four days, with a cabbage leaf laid over to keep them down ; drain them, and put them into a perfectly clean brass pan, with vine or cab- bage leaves in the bottom, and cover them with vinegar and water half and half, strewing a little pounded alum, and put- ting more leaves over them ; let the water get scalding hot; take off the pan; when nearly cold, make it again hot, and repeat this as frequently as possible through the day. With fresh leaves, and the same liquor, put them into a basin to stand all night; the next morning, with fresh leaves under and over, and the same liquor, heat them twice, and then drain them; and if for six or eight dozen, put them into the pan with half a pint of vinegar, and water sufficient to cover them, and some salt; scald them as before, and put them off and on the fire till they are a good green ; drain, and poor over them boiling water; let them lie a short time in this,

POULTRY. 407 Tided with a salt cat, which is a dish of the following com- position : â€” Loam, sand, mortar, fresh lime, bay salt, cummin, coriander, caraway seed, and allspice, moistened with beer, heaped up in the dish, and a piece of board placed upon the summit to prevent the birds from dunging upon it. It is always injudicious to purchase old pigeons for stock- ing, as even cutting their wings will not insure their remain- ing. Squeakers, or such as have not yet flown, will become perfectly domesticated if confined for a short time. In justice to the farmer, the proprietor of pigeons ought to feed them regularly, more particularly in seedtime, and towards harvest, and also when the ground is bound by frost, or covered with snow. Tares, and the smallest kind of horse-bean, commonly called pigeon-beans, are both the best and cheapest food, and the pulse is better to be of the previous year.

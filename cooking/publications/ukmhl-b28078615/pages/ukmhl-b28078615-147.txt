135 PREPARATORY REMARKS. To boil a Fowl When nicely singed, washed, and trussed, it IS well dredged with flour, and put on in boiling water, and if a large one, boiled nearly an hour. It is served with parsley and butter, white, or liver sauce. Two boiled Fowls, served with a tongue between them, make a handsome top dish. Boiled Chickens are improved by being stuffed, and will require nearly half an hour to boil. To roast a Goose.— After being well cleaned, picked, and singed, it is washed, made perfectly dry, and stuffed with about four table-spoonfuls of grated bread, an onion finely minced, together with three sage leaves, seasoned with salt and pepper, and mixed with a well-beaten egg; or the stuff- ing is made of boiled mashed potatoes, seasoned in the same way as the other, and mixed with a beaten egg. If roasted on a spit, each end is tied on tightly; it is basted at first with a little bit of butter, after which the fat that drops from it is used. It is served with gravy in the dish, and apple sauce in a sauce tureen. A large Goose will require an hour and a half to roast. At table, an opening is cut in the apron, and a glass of port wine, with which is mixed a large tea- spoonful of made mustard, is poured into the body of the Goose. This is also an improvement to Ducks. When a Goose is too old for the spit, it may be made into a ham, preparing it as for boiling, and following the same rules as for pork hams. A green Goose, about two or three months old, is seasoned with pepper and salt only, and requires to be basted with butter. It requires about an hour to roast. To roast Ducks— They are nicely picked, cleaned, singeu, and washed, seasoned with pepper and salt; or stuffed, and served with gravy, as directed in page 180. A Duck may be boiled for nearly an hour, and served with onion sauce poured over it.

The Cavour Restaurant 337 Fish. Boiled Turbot au Sauterne. Fried Fillet of Plaice. Grilled Herring. Entrte. Filet Mignon aux Haricots panaches. Calf’s Head a la Reine. Roast. Chicken. Quails on Toast Salad. Cheese. Dessert. There was a fine selection of hors d’oeuvre to choose from, and plenty of each, not the one sardine looking lonely in a little dish, the two radishes and the potato salad that so often are the sole representatives of the first course at cheap dining-places. I was given a big plateful of good thick mulligatawny soup, and when I had eaten the very liberal helping of boiled turbot, excellently firm, I felt that I had finished quite a good dinner. However, I summoned up enough appetite to dispose of the little vol au vent put before me, the pastry of which was noticeably excellent, and then attacked a quail, which was quite a good bird, even if it had not those layers of fat which distinguish a “ special ” quail on a club dinner list from the ordinary one. A scoop from an excellent Stilton cheese ended my repast. It may be selfish to hope that Mrs Dale may not sell her property to be converted into a theatre, but the Cavour dinner is such a good meal of its kind that I should be sorry if it disappeared from the map of London That Dines.

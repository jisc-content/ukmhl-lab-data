Old English Fare 5 converted into a club. It was curious that the pros- perity of this typical old English house depended to a great extent on a German head waiter ; for Frank, who had all the best traditions of British cookery at heart, had served under the old Emperor Wilhelm in the great war, and had been wounded by a French bayonet thrust. There were certain rules of the house that were excellent. One was that, no matter what orders you might give beforehand, no fish was ever put near the fire until the man who had ordered it was inside the building, which ensured it going to table cooked to the second; and another was that the steaks, which were a great stand-by of the house, â€™were cut from the mass of beef just in time to be transferred at once to the grill, thus making sure that none of the juices should drain away. But there are still some temples of British cookery left in Cockaigne, and to some of them presently I will direct your steps.

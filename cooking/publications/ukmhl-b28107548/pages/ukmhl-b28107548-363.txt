The Ligue des Gourmands 327 dishes, and remind great chefs when I beg recettes from them, that it is not so much the ingredients of a dish as the hand of the cook that makes a master- piece. No painstaking amateur, following exactly the directions given by a master of the art, ever reproduces a chef-d'oeuvre, any more than an amateur painter, copying the work of some great master of the brush is able to obtain that master’s effects.

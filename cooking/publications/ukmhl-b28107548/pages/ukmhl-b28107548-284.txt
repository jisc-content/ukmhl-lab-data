254 The Gourmet's Guide to London as did most other restaurant bars, when gentlemen no longer cared to be seen taking their liquid refresh- ment standing, and the clientele of the restaurant was decidedly Bohemian. When “Jemmy’s” was wiped off the map of London there were not many tears shed at its disappearance. The Piccadilly Hotel and its restaurant, when they were first opened, went through their teething troubles, as do most new establishments. The restaurant opened with a great flourish of trumpets, most of its personnel coming straight from Monte Carlo to London, but though the maitres d’hotel knew who was who in the principality of Monaco they were not so well acquainted with the personalities of London life. All these matters invariably straighten them- selves out. I read in the columns of City intelligence that the hotel, under the management of Mr F. Heim, who is now managing director, is a financial success, and is paying good dividends. The restaurant has gathered to itself a clientele that is smart and well- dressed, and it treats its guests excellently. To the great grill-room, which lies down in the basement below the restaurant, and which is one of the largest and one of the busiest places of good cheer in London, I allude in my chapter concerning some of the grill-rooms.

The Monico 361 which billiards was a game much in favour, and in the International Hall above the cafe M. Monico established a number of billiard-tables. When the craze for billiards died away the long upper room, with its arched ceiling, became a banqueting hall. Fifty years ago the licensing magistrates looked with just as much suspicion on any new enterprises in restaurants as they do at the present day, and the Monico could not at first obtain a licence to sell wines and spirits.

Monico and his sons obtained a second frontage for their restaurant

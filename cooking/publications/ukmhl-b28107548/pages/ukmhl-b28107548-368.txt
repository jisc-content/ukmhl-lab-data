332 The Gourmet’s Guide to London Mabel Martin all sang charmingly, and were pre- sented with bouquets on behalf of the Ligue, and M. Siffre, the president of the Club Gaulois, sang “ Margot ” quite excellently, without an accompani- ment. He was presented with a cabbage stuck on a fork, for the leaguers dearly love their little jokes at their banquets. At last the band played the Pere la Victoire march and the National Anthem, and the dinner came to an end. In gratitude to M. Escoffier, the president, to M. Th. Gringoire, the secretary, and to all the members of the Ligue for being permitted in their company to taste for the first time the sucking-pig of St Fortunat—a dish that will go the round of the globe—let me quote a few words appropriate to the occasion from Charles Lamb’s prose Hymn of Praise in honour of roast pig : “ Pig—let me speak his praise—is no less pro- vocative of the appetite than he is satisfactory to the criticalness of the censorious palate. The strong man may batten on him, and the weakling refuseth not his mild juices.”

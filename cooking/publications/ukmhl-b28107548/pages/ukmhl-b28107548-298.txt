266 The Gourmet’s Guide to London the great hall of which, somewhat altered, is the large room of the present restaurant. Mr William John Wilde, who was Buckstone’s treasurer at the Hay- market Theatre, became the proprietor of the Cafe de l’Europe in the late fifties, and as there was no early- closing law in those days the cafe naturally enough became the favourite supping place for those who had sat through a long evening at the theatre almost next door, and the sturdy critics who congregated in the first row of the pit ate their devilled bones and tripe and onions, Welsh rarebits, chops and potatoes in their jackets, at the cafe after midnight and passed judgment on the performances of Buckstone and Liston, Sothern and the other famous comedians of the theatre as they supped. Mr D. Pentecost was the last proprietor of the old cafe. He was, as “ Dagonet ” in The Referee has lately reminded us, a nephew of Pierce Egan, the author of “ Tom and Jerry,” and he was, amongst other things, the refresh- ment contractor to the Alhambra. He was also the proprietor of the Epitaux Restaurant in the colonnade of the opera house in the Haymarket. When that building was pulled down, in order that the Carlton and His Majesty’s Theatre should be built on its site, Mr Pentecost transferred the name of Epitaux to the Cafe de 1’Europe. The building was redecorated and MM. Costa and Rizzi became the lessees. Ten years ago, as I have previously written, MM. Degiuli and Boriani became the proprietors and gave the restaurant its present name and its present appearance.

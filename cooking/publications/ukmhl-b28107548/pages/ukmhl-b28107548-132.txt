104 Gourmet’s Guide to London it is placed on the grill being a guarantee of the quality of the meat. Most of the restaurants also have their grills. Romano’s turned its old kitchen into a reproduction of a room in a Russian farmhouse with horns on the walls and an icon up in a corner, and even at one time carried realism to the point of putting the waiters in this part of the establishment into white blouses with red sashes at the waist, the dress the Tartar waiters in Moscow wear. You get the restaurant food in this grill-room at about half the restaurant prices. A new electric grill has been installed in this Russian room which grills just as well and far more quickly than a charcoal or a coal grill. The Frascati, in Oxford Street, has a grill-room on the ground floor with walls of white marble veined with grey, and with mirrors in Oriental frames ; and at the entrance to Tottenham Court Road the Horse- shoe has an excellent grill above its oyster saloon. The Holborn shows originality in devoting a grill- room to ladies, and in the old Freemasons’ Tavern in Great Queen Street, which now calls itself the Connaught Rooms, there is in the basement a large grill-room, with a choice of three joints at luncheon time as well as an extensive carte du jour, a grill which is much patronised by the lawyers from Lincoln’s Inn Fields. In the evening a dinner is served in a smaller room, and I have dined there before going across the way to the Kingsway Theatre. Those who dine are, I think, mostly connected in some way or another with Freemasonry, and the talk that goes on at the tables has reference to high offices in the Craft and Mark, to “ raising” and “passing,” and to that ancient and sacred ritual which ladies still believe to be in some way connected with a red-hot poker.

jo The Gourmet’s Guide to London pendent electroliers sparkles, and the first and the second maitres dl hotel, M. Invernizzi, who comes from the Palace Hotel, at St Moritz, to London for the season, and M. Castelani, who is a permanency at Claridge’s, are tactfully attentive, while M. Gehlardi, the manager of the hotel, walks through the rooms during the course of dinner to bow here and there at a table, and to assure himself that all is well. It is the clientele of Claridge’s that has made its atmosphere, for the well-dressed, good- looking, quiet people who dine at the tables, put a comfortable distance apart, are folk whose names bulk largely in the Society columns of the news- papers, and the list of the diners on any given night in Claridge’s Restaurant would be for the most part a string of titles. Good manners are in the air, and I do not think that even the rawest plutocrat could be unmannerly amidst such surroundings. On the night that I last dined at Claridge’s, I had written beforehand asking that a table for three should be reserved for me, and I had intended to give my guests the larger of the two dinners of the restaurant, the twelve-and-six one, which runs through the usual courses, and which is by no means a set dinner, for any dish which does not exactly match the fancy of a dinner-giver is changed for another to suit his whim or his palate. But I found that a special little feast had been ordered for me by M. Gehlardi, and the menu of it was as follows :— Melon Cantaloup. Bortcli a la Russe. Filets de Sole Newnham-Davis. Noisette d’Agneau aux Fines Herbes. Petits pois frais. Pommes Noisettes Coq en Pate. Salade de Romaine a PEstragon. Fraises Parisienne. Friandises.

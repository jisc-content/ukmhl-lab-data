284 The Gourmet’s Guide to London buff and brown marble on either side, form the first stage of the diner’s progress to the restaurant. Servants in the handsome state livery they wear in the evening—French grey and dark blue—take one’s coat and hat, and it always gives me a moment of gratification that I am such an old habitue that it is not considered necessary to give me a ticket. Then if one is a host there is nothing to do except to sit in one of the comfortable chairs in this ante- chamber and to look alternately up the crimson stairs to see whether one’s guests are arriving and down another flight of stairs across the great lounge to the crystal screen of great panes framed in gilt metal which is the transparent barrier between the restaurant and its approaches. The lounge—crimson under foot, with walls light cream in colour, good copies of portraits by British old masters in panels alternating with looking-glass doorways ; with pillars of buff marble, veined with brown and having gilt capitals, and bronze amorini and sculptured groups of the Graces as supports for electroliers—is a delightful room, as one realises after dinner when the hour of coffee has come. The band, wearing in the evening their uniform of dark blue, the leader distinguished by a silver sash—in the daytime they are in crimson—are in a corner of the lounge close against the crystal screen that their music may be heard in the restaurant. Arched entrances in the eastern wall lead into the Winter Garden, another great hall with a glazed ceiling, with roses climbing up trellis-work, and with a great recess, up a broad flight of stairs, with pillars of green marble and a gilded fountain against its wall. The salon de verdure, as it is grandiloquently called, is above the new ballroom, the two great apart- ments occupying the space where the courtyard used to be.

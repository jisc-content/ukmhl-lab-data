Two Little Soho Restaurants 29 it some peas, fourpence, and some new potatoes, also fourpence. Amongst the entremets is a Peche Petit Riche, which the little waitress strongly recommends, but beignets de pommes at threepence seems to me a more fitting ending for our repast. There is no long waiting for one’s food at the Au Petit Riche ; the soup arrives almost immediately and is wonderful value for threepence. The vol au vent is an admirable little fish pie, and the filet mignon a most toothsome morsel of meat, while the beignets are all that they should be. The little waitress, when we have arrived at the filet mignon stage of the dinner, asks writh the utmost solicitude : “Do you like eet?” and I have replied for both of us “ Very much indeed.” At the table to one side of us are a young couple whose dinner has consisted of curried chicken and plum pudding au Rhum, and at the table to our other side, two ladies are eating a typical woman’s dinner of hors d’oeuvre, poached eggs and spinach, and a vanilla ice. The Au Petit Riche finds room on its small carte du jour for dishes to suit all tastes. The little waitress brings the total of the bill on a bit of green paper; and having finished our dinner, and having paid for it, we will go down into the lower rooms before leaving the restaurant. In the lower rooms every table is always occupied, and I fancy that the habitues of the restaurant prefer them to the upper ones. One of them is decorated with golden fleurs- de-lis on a blue ground, and another is an admirable representation of the kitchen of a Breton farm- house, crockery and all complete. There is a great buzz of talk in these lower rooms, and Madame la Patronne, sitting at her desk amidst the tables, takes her share in the conversation and attends to the making out of the bills at one and the same time.

318 The Gourmet’s Guide to London is ready to do, and she often furnishes it, and ornaments its walls with china and pictures. Some- times when a host or hostess wishes to entertain many guests to dinner and a ball Mrs Lewis takes a big vacant house and furnishes it for one night, in all the rooms that are seen, as completely as though its owners were still occupying it. “ I have made almost as much in the past year out of my gold chairs and my china as I have out of my pots and pans,” she told me. She has a little army of devoted waiters who have been at her call for twenty years and who are always ready to serve under her banner. A menu of one of Mrs Lewis’s ball suppers, at Surrey House, may well find a place here. She, I believe, first made the great discovery that young men who have danced an evening through prefer eggs and bacon and Lager beer in the small hours of the morning to pate de foie gras and champagne : Chaud.

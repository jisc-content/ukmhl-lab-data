Whitebait at Greenwich 57 the hall porter put Jack’s plate of water down, and I made short work of a slip and was going to try the rissoles when Jack, in a plaintive tone of voice, in- formed the world that something was the matter. His mistress understood him at once. The poor dear would not drink his water unless she stood by ; and this having been proved by actual fact, Miss Dainty, with myself in attendance, came back to find that whiting puddings and stewed eels had taken the place of former dishes. Miss Dainty took a small helping of the eels, looked at it, and then turned her eyes again to Jack, who was going through a series of gymnastics. I ate my whiting pudding, which I love, in fevered haste, and had got half-way through my helping of eels when Miss Dainty discovered what was the matter with Jack. The boys on the steps below were annoying him, and the only way to keep him quiet would be to give him some bones. The sympathetic hall porter again came to the rescue, and Jack, under his mistress’s eye, made fine trencher play with two bones. There was a look of reproach in the veteran waiter’s eye when we came back and found that the crab omelette and salmon cutlets a Vindienne were cooling. I tried to draw Miss Dainty’s attention away from Jack. I told her how Mr Punch had called her Faustine, and had written a page about her; but when she found there was nothing to quote in her book of press notices she lost all interest in the hump- backed gentleman. With the advent of the plain whitebait a new danger to Jack arose. A turtle was brought by three men on to the lawn and turned loose, and Miss Dainty had to go out and assure herself that Jack was not frightened, and that the turtle was not meditating an attack upon him.

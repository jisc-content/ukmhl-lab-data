3 i o The Gourmet’s Guide to London the Fire,” said my host, as I gazed in admiration at the magnificent proportions of this banqueting-house, the oak almost black with age, relieved by the colours of the banners that hang from the walls, by the portraits of worthies, by some noble painted windows, by the line of escutcheons which run round the room, bearing the arms of the Past-Masters of the Company, and by the carved panels, into all but two of which Grinling Gibbons threw his genius, while the two new ones compare not unfavourably with the old. At the far end of the hall is a musicians’ gallery of carved oak. A bronze Laocoon wrestles with his snakes at one side of the hall, and on the other, on a mantel of red marble, a great clock is flanked by two bronzes. Three long tables run up the room to the high table, at the centre of which is the Master’s chair, and behind this chair is piled on the sideboard the Com- pany’s plate. And some of the plate is magnificent. There are the old silver salt-cellars, there are great silver tankards, gold salvers, and the gold cup given to the Mercers by the Bank of England and the Lee cup and an ornamental tun and waggon, the first of which is valued at £7000 and the second at ^10,000. “ Pray, silence for grace,” came in the deep bass tones of the toast-master from behind the Master’s chair, and then all of us settled down to a contem- plation of the menu and to a view of our fellow- guests. This was the dinner that Messrs Ring and Brymer, who cater for the Mercers, put upon the table: Madeira. Tortue. Tortue claire. Consomme printaniere. Steinberg, 1883. Hock. Salade de filets de soles a la russe. Saumon. Sauce homard. Blanchallle.

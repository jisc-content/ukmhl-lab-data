152 XXIV THE MITRE AT HAMPTON COURT W e all know that in the spring a young man’s fancy lightly turns to thoughts of love, but it is not such common knowledge that in the early summer the thoughts of a man ‘of mature age turn with equal agility to duckling and green peas. And with duck- ling and green peas I always associate the Mitre at Hampton Court. So it came to pass that I asked a crony of like tastes to myself to meet me on a spring Sunday at Hampton Court in the late afternoon, and suggested that we should walk in the gardens of the Palace and see the rhododendrons, which were then in great beauty, and that we should afterwards dine at the Mitre, sup green pea soup and eat duckling and green peas. The Mitre is the most typically late Georgian, or early Victorian, inn that I know of in the neighbour- hood of London, and its great attraction is that it has kept the old cookery, the old furniture, the old pictures, the old china, the old plate, and last, but not least, the old manners. It has been quite un- conscious of the changes in the outside world, it knows nothing of electric light and such newfangled ideas, there are no French rolls to be found in its bread baskets, and its ducklings are spitted and roasted before an open fire, being well basted the while.

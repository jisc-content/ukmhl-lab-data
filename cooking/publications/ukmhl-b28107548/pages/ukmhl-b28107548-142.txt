i 14 The Gourmet's Guide to London private room looking down on the Strand, which has been shut off from the balcony, and no better indica- tion of the type of these could be given than by setting down the menu of the latest dinner of the Wine Connoisseurs’ Club, at which there were forty guests: Cantaloup Glace. Tortue Claire. Veloute de Volaille Duchesse. Truite George V. Ris de Veau aux Perles Noires, Selle de Behague aux Primeurs. Pommes Ideal. Granite au Clicquot. Poularde Flanquee D’Ortolans. Salade Romaine. Asperges Vertes, Sauce Divine. Peches Orientales. Mignardises. Paillettes au Parmesan. Dessert. The Truite George V. which has a place in this menu is one of the specialities of the house. It is a salmon trout, braized in port, served cold on ice with sliced oranges and a luscious jelly. Little Romano used to allude to his cellars, as I have written, as “ best in London,” and the restaurant has always had a celebrity for the great choice of champagnes of the great brands and great years it offers its patrons. Most of the profits made during the last few years have been expended on champagnes, and no restaurant in London is better prepared to face that champagne famine which will so soon be upon us.

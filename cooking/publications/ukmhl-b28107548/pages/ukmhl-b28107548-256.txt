XXXV 226 THE ADELAIDE GALLERY There is no story of the success of a London res- taurant more interesting than that of the Adelaide Gallery, which is more generally known as Gatti’s. The first Gatti to come to this country from the Val Blegno in the Ticino Canton of Switzerland, on the Italian side of the Alps, was the pioneer of penny ices in England, and his shop in Villiers Street by the steps leading down to the steamboat pier below Hungerford Market was for the sale of these ices and gaufres, the thin batter cakes pressed in a mould and baked, a delicacy the small children of Continental countries love, but which has never ousted the British penny bun for its pre-eminence in these islands. When Hungerford Market was swept away to give space for the building of Charing Cross Station, its name, however, being perpetuated by the bridge, the first Gatti’s was re-established under the arches of the station and became in due course the Charing Cross Music Hall. To the Gatti of Villiers Street and the Arches came from their native village two of his young nephews, Agostino and Stefano—the wags of the later Vic- torian days called them Angostura and Stephanotis. They determined, as soon as they felt their feet, to launch out on their own account.

XLI 267 IN JERMYN STREET MAISON JULES. BELLOMo’s. LES LAURIERS Jermyn Street used to be sacred to small private hotels, shops and bachelors’ chambers, but the restaurants have now invaded it and there are half-a- dozen places of good cheer which have their front doors in the street, while some of the Piccadilly restaurants have a back entrance there. M. Jules had the happy idea of taking two houses, one of them at one time the home of Mrs Fitzherbert, as a medallion of the head of King George IV., found under the drawing-room floor proves, and converting them into a hotel and restaurant. It has proved so successful in Jules’ case that he is now adding on to his hotel and restaurant, building at the same time a nice little suite of rooms with bow-windows for him- self and his wife. As you walk down Jermyn Street from St James’s Street towards Lower Regent Street, the Maison Jules is on the right-hand side.

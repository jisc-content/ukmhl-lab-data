Artists’ Rooms 243 doorways with mirrored panels, pink shades on the electroliers have subdued the light, which, when the room was first built, I found too white and too brilliant, and the lamps on the tables are also pink- shaded. The carpet is of a deep rose, and the white chairs are also upholstered in that colour. It is a very pleasant dining-room, and the people who dine there are all pleasant to look at, and do good food the compliment of going dressed in becoming garments. I very rarely dine at Dieudonne’s without seeing a ladies’ dinner-party in progress, for Dieudonne’s has always been a favourite dining place of the gentler sex since the early days when Giovanini, the old maitre d hotel, with bushy eyebrows and Piccadilly weepers, used to consider any ladies without an escort as being put under his special and fatherly protection. Dieudonne’s chiefly relies on two table d’hote dinners, one the opera dinner, at six-and-six, and the other the Dieudonne dinner, at eight shillings. On the last occasion that I dined at Dieudonne’s before going on to the Russian Opera at Drury Lane I ate the opera dinner, the menu of which I give below. It was the day of President Poincare’s state entry into London, and that event is celebrated by two of the dishes in the dinner : Menu. Hors d’oeuvre Varies Consomme a la Fran$aise. Creme de Laitues aux Perles. Saumon d’Ecosse Poche. Sauce Mousseline. Pommes Nature Concombres. Cotes de Pre-Sale Poincare. Canetons d’Aylesbury a PAnglaise. Petits Pois Nouvaux.

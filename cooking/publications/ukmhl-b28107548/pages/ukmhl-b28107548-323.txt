The Savoy To-day 289 pink glasses to the lamps on the occasion of banquets, it would, I think, please those like myself who think that the best light for a dining-room is a pink one. I asked M. Blond to give me the menu of any recent Savoy banquet of which the management was especially proud, not that I have not preserved many menus of many great dinners, but that I wished to shift the responsibility of selection on to his shoulders. This is the menu of the banquet and wines he has sent me as being typical of great Savoy feasts : Caviar de Belouga. Blinis a la Gouriew. Queue de Boeuf a la Franchise. Creme Germiny. Filets de Sole a l’Aiglon. Supreme de Volaille a l’Aurore. Cote d’Agneau de Lait au Beurre Noisette. Pommes Lorette. Veloute Forestiere. Delice de Strasbourg a la Gelee de Vin du Ehin. Becassine Double Flambee a l’Armagnac. Perles du Porigord. Coeurs de Laitues Suzette. Asperges Vertes de Paris. Cornices Toscane. Souffle. Pont l’Eveque. Corbeilles de Fruits. Wines. Schloss Johannisberg Cabinet, 1893. Veuve Clicquot, 1904. Magnums Pommery and Greno (Nature), 1904. Chat. Haut Brion “Cachet du Chateau,” 1888. Cockburn’s 1890 (Bottled 1893). Croft’s 1881 (Bottled 1884). Hennessey’s 70 year old Cognac. Many of the dishes included in this great dinner I hope I may meet at a future time at Savoy banquets. T

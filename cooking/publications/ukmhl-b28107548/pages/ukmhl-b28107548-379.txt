Verrey s 343 Salad Rachel. Biscuit glace a la Verrey. Souffle de laitances. Dessert. Many distinguished men have dined in the Cameo Room—Tennyson, the Poet Laureate, was a great crony of Mr George Krehl the elder, and he kept all kinds of momentoes of the poet. Mr Gladstone was another frequenter of the Cameo Room, and he liked to talk to Mr Krehl of the revolutionary days of ’48 in Germany. The tragedy which is associated with the name of the house was the fate of the beautiful Miss Fanny Verrey. Verrey, from whom the restaurant takes its name, was a Swiss confectioner, who came over from Lausanne in the second decade of the last century and estab- lished his shop in Regent Street. To add to the attractions of his establishment he brought over from Lausanne his pretty young daughter, who was en- gaged to a Swiss pastor. She was young and lively and beautiful; she chatted with her father’s customers, and learnt English by talking with them; the bucks of those days made her a toast; and Lord Petersham wrote some verses in honour of “The Pretty Con- fectioner,” in which he dubbed her “ Wild Switzer- land’s Queen,” and ended one of the verses with these lines : “Thy mind—brightest gem—is the Temple of Love ; But bright as thou’rt fair—thou’rt pure as a dove ” $ which shows that his lordship, though his sentiments were praiseworthy, was not a great poet. The fame of Miss Verrey’s beauty drew crowds not only into the shop, but outside it, and spiteful and jealous rivals spread rumours concerning Miss Verrey’s lightness of behaviour, which were entirely untrue. The crowds outside the shop became such a nuisance

The foys of Foreign Travel 215 ending with the description of the soupe a Poignon which is put on table, over which a clean napkin is spread, of the delicious savour it emits and how beautifully hot and strong it is, of the grilled wings of a chicken which follow ; of an omelette au confiture, which the cook herself brings to table; of country wine and country butter; a long stick of bread and some cheese made on a neighbour- ing farm. And the “ tag,” in a dozen words, tells how the chauffeur, who has also been well fed, finds a fresh supply of petrol, and how the contented travellers reach at midnight the town where they intend to sleep. The scene of another story is a minor cathedral town in Italy or Spain, and the tale commences with a vigorous denunciation of the principal hotel in the place : stuffy rooms, vile food cooked in rancid oil ; an impudent head waiter and an unhelpful hall-porter. The central division of the story deals with a long day of sight-seeing ; a midday meal of sandwiches, “ horrid things made of the ham of the country and coarse bread ” ; and a terrifying adventure when, having lost their way in a network of streets, the ladies of the party are stared at by some horrible unshaven men who say un-understandable things in patois, and then laugh. The tale concludes thus Just as we thought that we should have to pay one of the impudent little boys to show us the way back to that disgusting hotel we turned a corner, and there we saw a clean little restaurant with little trees in front of the window and a bill of fare, with lots of nice things on it quite cheap, hanging on the door-post.” There are unlimited variations on the above, and the tale can take from two minutes to three-quarters of an hour in the telling, according to the volume of guide-book gush and the amount of lip-smacking over the food that is introduced into it.

18 6 The Gourmet’s Guide to London M. Malley came from the Ritz at Paris when the London Ritz was first opened, having acquired his art at the Grand Vefour and the Cafe Anglais. He presides over a very spacious range of white-tiled kitchens, in which all the rooms which should be hot are divided by a wide corridor from the rooms which should be cold, and he has a talent for the invention of new dishes, amongst these being a very splendid dish of salmon with a mousse of crayfish, which he has named after the Marquise de Sevigne, a reminiscence of his days at Vichy, and his peches Belle Dijonnaise, of which more anon. Russian soups are one of the specialities of the Ritz kitchen, and there is a Viennese pastrycook amongst the members of M. Malley’s brigade, who makes exquisite pastry. The late King Edward had a special fancy for the cakes made at the Ritz, and a supply used to be sent to Buckingham Palace, but M. Elies told me that this was a State secret, for M. Menager, the King’s chef, might not have liked it to be known that anything from another kitchen entered Bucking- ham Palace. As I had left my dinner in the safe hands of the experts, so I also left the question of the champagne we should drink, only asking that it should be one recommended by the house. Before going on my way I reminded M. Kroell that on the last occasion that I had word with him he was presented with a miniature in brilliants of the order bestowed on him by the King of Spain, and I asked him if he had been awarded any other decora- tions. M. Kroell laughed, and then modestly owned to the German military medal, and as he told me this he involuntarily squared his shoulders as an old soldier. Lady Amalthea arrived with military punctuality (she is a soldier’s wife) in the best of spirits, wearing a dream of a dress, and her diamonds and turquoises.

342 The Gourmet's Guide to London shillings. This with a pint of good claret was a dinner not to be despised. I asked Mr Stadelmaier whether the Queen’s Hall and the Palladium, two neighbouring places of music and entertainment, had brought the restaurant many customers. The concerts at the Queen’s Hall, he told me, had done so, and he said that people going to the Palladium, when it gave a one-house variety enter- tainment, used often to dine at Verrey’s, but that its present “two houses a night” policy did not send diners to the restaurant. There is an abundance of history behind Verrey’s, and if a careful record had been kept of the great dinners given in the rooms on the first door, such a record as the Cafe Anglais in Paris kept, it would make very interesting reading. One of the merriest dinners probably ever given in those upper rooms was the one at the time of the late Victorian revival of road coaching, at which most of the guests were well- known whips. Every man at this dinner was presented with a pink waistcoat, and as after dinner most of the men went on either to music halls or theatres, the appearance in the boxes of the young bloods wearing pink waistcoats astonished the audiences, who thought that a new fashion was being set. A quieter dinner, but an even more distinguished one, was that at which King Edward, when he was Prince of Wales, was present. This was its menu : CEufs a la Ravigote. (Vodkhi.) Bisque d’ecrevisses. Consomme Okra. Rougets a la Muscovite. Selle de mouton de Galles. Haricots panaches. Tomates au gratin. Pommes soufflees. Timbale Lucullus. Fonds d’artichauts. Creme pistache. Grouse.

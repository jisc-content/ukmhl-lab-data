I sketched out the little man’s other ventures, and I ended by telling her that Oddenino is a man of much consideration in the Italian colony in London, and has been decorated by his king. Surely she did not expect a Cavaliere to make rag-time music ? And my little French cousin said “assuredly not.” When we had come to the noisettes’ stage of our dinner the beautiful young man whom we had left waiting in the vestibule came in—alone. He looked as gloomy as Hamlet, and held in his hand a letter, which he tore into small pieces and thrust into the ice pail beside his table. “The poor animal!” said my little cousin pityingly. “ He is dining with an excuse.” He drank two glasses of champagne in quick suc- cession, and then felt strong enough to sup his soup. About this period a change came over the music of the band, which had conscientiously worked off the barcarole from “ Hoffman,” a Viennese waltz and a minuet. A clean-shaven young man, Mr Gideon, the clever composer of the rag-time successes who had been eating his dinner like the rest of us, took his place at the piano, and the orchestra subordinated itself to his leadership. Mr Gideon can make the piano speak as few men can, and my little French cousin and Robert both pricked up their ears and even let the asparagus get cold in their new-found interest. When Mr Gideon, dispensing with orchestral aid, sang “ Honolulu,” and here and there a girl’s voice joined in the refrain, my little cousin turned sharply to me. “Ought one to sing?” she asked, and I told her that it was as she pleased. She listened with all her ears to catch the words, and at last trilled out with the rest: “ Ma onaleuleu one leu,” and then laughed at her own boldness.

The Monico 363 woodcock jlambe and a salad of tender lettuce which, like the beautiful peaches with which we finished our repast, must have been grown in some Southern, sun- shiny clime. I also enjoyed the cheese fondue, made, I think, from the recette that Brillat Savarin set down in his “ Physiologie du Gout.” The Monico has gained special celebrity for its banquets, and the requests for dates for such feasts made to the Messrs Monico have been so over- whelming that they have turned the Renaissance Saloon, which used to be devoted to a table d'hote dinner, into a banqueting-room, and have redecorated it for its new uses.

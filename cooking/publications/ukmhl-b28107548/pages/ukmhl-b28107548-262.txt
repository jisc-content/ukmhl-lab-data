232 The Gourmets Guide to London chips days. It retains, however, all its old democratic ways. Its clients choose their own tables and their own seats, hang up their own coats and then catch the attention of the waiter who has charge of the table. The restaurant—cream and gold, with French grey panels in its roof—has now four entrances : the Adelaide Street one, two in King William Street and one in the Strand. While the main restaurant remains an a la carte establishment with a plentiful choice of dishes, including a list of grills, there is a table d'hote room at the King William Street side, a handsome hall with a gilded roof and pink-shaded electroliers, which throw their light up on to the ceiling. The latest addition to the dining-rooms is a banqueting hall, reached by marble stairs from King William Street. It is a handsome and well- proportioned room, with a musicians’ gallery at one side, and an ante-room half-way up its stairs, and it holds one hundred and fifty feasters quite comfortably. At the same little table where their father and their uncle sat, the two Messrs Gatti of to-day—John (ex-Mayor of Westminster) and Rocco—sit, young copies of their predecessors, in that one of them has kept a plentiful head of hair, whereas the other one has been less conservative. They give the same attention to the business of the restaurant that the original Gattis did, but the semicircular desk has vanished and the work of taking the counters is now done by deputies on either side of a great screen which stretches before the wide entrance to the kitchen. Mr de Rossi, dapper and energetic, is ,the manager of the restaurant, and it is always a comfort to me that when I lunch or dine under the musicians’ gallery the maitre d'hotel, whom I have known for thirty years, comes and gives me fatherly advice as to the choice of dishes for a meal.

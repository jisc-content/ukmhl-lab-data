The Mitre 157 Removes. Roast Fore Quarter of Lamb. French Beans. Ducklings. Peas. Asparagus. Sweets. Gooseberry Foule. Cream. Madeira Jellies. Iced Pudding. Dessert. My crony and I sat sipping the old brandy, talking at intervals, and watching how the daylight gave place to the afterglow, how the people on the towpath thinned in numbers to single figures, and the home- ward bound boats on the river became fewer and fewer. As the light died out the river became a sheet of dull silver, and the colour of the old brick walls of the Palace gardens and its out-buildings grew to deeper and a deeper purple, and the great trees became warm black silhouettes against the darkening sky and the lights in the house-boats moored by the bank began to throw reflections into the stream. Everything, even a spring evening at Hampton Court, must come to an end, and at last I called for my bill. The dinner was eight shillings a head, and so moderate had we been in our summer beverages—the old brandy was host Sadler’s contribution—that the total came to a sovereign. We walked along the path up the river in the cool of the evening till we could see the lights in Garrick’s Villa, and then my crony and I bade each other good- night and went our separate ways.

234 The Gourmet1 s Guide to London Gatti’s, like every other restaurant of standing, has its own special dishes, and some of these were included in a lunch which I ate with Messrs John and Rocco Gatti when they were good enough in a chat we had to refresh my memory in regard to the early days of the restaurant: Hors d’oeuvre a la Parisienne. Zephire de Sole Adelaide. Supreme de Volaille Royal. Asperges vertes. See. Chantilly. Perdreau Roti a la Broche. Coeur-de-Laitue a la Frangaise. Cerises Montmorency Sarah-Bernhardt. Corbeille de Delices. Cafe. The zephire de sole Adelaide is an admirable jilet de sole and oysters therewith ; the breast of the chicken was served with an excellent white sauce; and the entremet was worthy of the distinguished tragedienne after whom it is named. The wine list at Gatti’s is a document to be care- fully studied. The Gattis of the previous generation laid down some very fine wines, and clarets and Burgundies of the great years of the end of the last century are to be found in the Adelaide cellars. The champagnes of great years and of great houses are priced far lower than they are to be found on the lists of fashionable restaurants, and there is some old cognac in the cellars to which I take off my hat whenever I am privileged to meet it. It was bought by the Gattis at the time of the Franco-Prussian War, when stocks of old brandy were sold at low prices. It is marked so as to show a profit on the purchase- money—not at its worth—and I know of no better brandy at any London restaurant, whatever price customers may choose to give.

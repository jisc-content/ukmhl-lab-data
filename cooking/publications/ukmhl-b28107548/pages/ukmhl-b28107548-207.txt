The Burford Bridge Hotel 179 was sharpness in the September night air, and at ten o’clock, gently tired by my afternoon’s walk on the hills, went up to bed in a clean little bedroom with some good old prints on its walls. Next morning the sound that woke me was the cawing of the rooks on their way to the fields.

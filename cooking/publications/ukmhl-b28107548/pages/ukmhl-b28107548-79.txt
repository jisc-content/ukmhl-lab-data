Oyster-Houses 51 of sandwiches of all kinds. Upstairs there are two floors of dining-rooms for people who want some- thing more solid than oysters or sandwiches. No chapter on oyster-houses would be complete without reference to Driver’s in Glasshouse Street, and Wilton’s in King Street, both houses which supply the clubs and great restaurants with oysters, and which, as well, open oysters for hungry customers at their counters. At Driver’s a little screen of stained glass only partially conceals the oysters which are spread out on the broad space behind the glass. On the door is the simple legend, “ Driver, Oysterman,” and inside are three black-coated men opening oysters behind the counter. In a little glass box sits a lady cashier. This in old days used to be where Mrs Driver sat, and could always spare time for a smile and a word to an old customer. On the wall behind the counter is a board with the orders for oysters contained by clips, and two shelves, on which are rows of big shells, showing wide surfaces of mother-o’-pearl. A little staircase leads to an upper room, where sybarites can sit and eat oysters and caviare and bread and cheese, and there is a little table downstairs tucked away behind the staircase; but I am one of the stalwarts who have always stood at the counter at Driver’s to eat my oysters and to wipe my fingers afterwards on the pendant napkins. Behind Wilton’s plate-glass windows there are warrants suitably framed, and the proprietor is generally to be seen either behind his counting-desk or the little oyster bar in the spacious shop. Wilton’s at one time used to purvey Irish oysters, as well as other British varieties, but the supply was so uncertain that they have been taken off the list. If I have omitted to give the prices of the oysters at the various oyster-houses, it is because they vary so much. One can buy native oysters in the shops

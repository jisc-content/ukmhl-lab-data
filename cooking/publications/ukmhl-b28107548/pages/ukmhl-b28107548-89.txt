The Cecil 61 their feeJings, but it was the coldness of their surroundings that affected them. To tear down all the decorations of a newly built hall is an heroic remedy which no board of directors would willingly face, and before this was done other less expensive remedies were tried. A separate en- trance for the restaurant was made in the courtyard, and a lounge built and quite charmingly decorated. M. Paillard, the great Parisian restaurateur, crossed the Channel and became for a time manager of the restaurant, making with M. Coste in the kitchen a remarkable combination of talent. A Roumanian band, fierce-looking gentlemen in embroidered garments, who had been sensationally successful at one of the great exhibitions in Paris, were imported, were perched up on a rostrum and made the roof rever- berate with their czardas. The services of “ Smiler,” a curry-cook of great renown, were exclusively retained for the Cecil. (Sherry’s in New York offered “Smiler” large sums of money to transfer his services, and he crossed the Atlantic with a little band of underlings of his own nationality. “ Smiler ” travelled first class, and the reporters on the other side not unnaturally took him to be an Indian Prince on his travels. “Smiler” did not undeceive them, and enjoyed for some days all the privileges given to royalty in a republic. Then he reported at Sherry’s.) Mr Hector Tenant, the managing director of the Empire, joined the Cecil board, and a series of variety performances after dinner on Sundays filled the big restaurant to its holding capacity on those evenings. Harry Lauder, concerning whose talent and fine voice everybody was talking at that time, sang, I remember, on one of those occasions. But there must have been some excellent reasons for not continuing these variety performances, for after a time they ceased.

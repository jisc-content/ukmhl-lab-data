37° The Gourmet's Guide to London Signor Pratti, if I remember rightly, fines teetotalers by charging them sixpence extra. From Hampstead to Surbiton, from Richmond to Epping, the little Italian restaurants flourish. One gourmet whom I know, with a delicate taste in Italian wines, makes pilgrimages regularly to Reggiori’s, opposite King’s Cross Station, because he gets there a particular wine which this restaurateur imports ; while I take an almost paternal interest in Canuto’s Restaurant in Baker Street. The rise of that restaurant from a very humble place, that put out two boards with great sheets of paper on them, giving the dishes ready and the dinner of the day, to a rather haughty little restaurant with a very beautiful window and the carte du jour and the menus of table d'hote dinners behind the glass in frames of restrained gorgeousness, typifies the gradual advance in social splendour of the long street that leads to Regent’s Park.

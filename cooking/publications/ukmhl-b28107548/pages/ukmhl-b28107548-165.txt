In the Shadow of the Palace Theatre 137 two rooms to the right of the hall were in 1913 very tastefully redecorated, but it still retains its character- istic of being several small houses joined together. The first sight that greets one’s eyes on entering the hall is a view of the kitchen, generally with a cook in white clothing busy about his work as the centre of the picture, and those who lunch and dine are, as of yore, asked to walk through the white-tiled, beautifully clean domain of the chef. A grill-room now forms part of the establishment, and the character of the meals is changed in that table d'hote dinners at various prices are the trump cards of the establishment. I fancy that the propinquity of the Palace, of the Shaftesbury Theatre, and now of the Ambassadors’ may have had a great deal to say to this change, for when I dine at Kettner’s before going to the Palace or the Shaftesbury I can see that most of my fellow- guests are theatre-goers. A three-and-six table d'hote dinner in the grill-room and five-shilling and seven- and-six ones in the restaurant are the early evening meals of the establishment, and below is quite a fair specimen of the menu of the five-shilling dinner. It is the one I ate on the last occasion that I made a pilgrimage to see Madame Pavlova dance. The quail was fat and tender, and the creme Victoria a good soup : Menu Hors d’oeuvre. Consomme Bortsch.

Old English Fare 3 suggest to some cooks who put the oysters into puddings and pies with the other raw materials that a better way is to cook the dish, then remove the crust or paste, slip in the oysters, fix the crust again and cook till the oysters are warmed through. The typical British dinner most often quoted is that which the Lord Dudley of the thirties, a noted epicure, declared was a dinner “ fit for an emperor,” and it runs thus: “A good soup, a small turbot, a neck of venison, duckling with green peas, or chicken with asparagus, and an apricot tart.” Of British soups turtle always takes precedence in the list of honour, but as the turtle comes from Ascension or the West Indies, it can hardly claim to be a denizen of these islands.

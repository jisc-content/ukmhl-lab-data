Appenrodfs 167 When Appenrodt’s headquarters at No. I Coventry Street were a-building I watched with interest the putting in of the big plate-glass windows, and after its completion I looked whenever I passed at the big cartes du jour which are put up outside wherever there is space for them.

There is plenty of choice, for the menu of the day comprises four soups, ten fish dishes, at least the same number of entrees, some of these being those that Germans love, vegetables and sweets in due pro- portion, four joints at lunch-time and the same number at dinner.

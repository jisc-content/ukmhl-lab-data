Cbridge’s j I The chef de cuisine at Claridge’s is M. Maurice Bonhomme, who had passed through the kitchens of two great Parisian restaurants, the Cafe de Paris, and Ledoyen’s, in the Champs Elysees, before he came to London. He is a chef of high repute, and these are the specialities of his kitchen filet de sole Tosca, supreme de sole Pre Catelan, Coulibiac de saumon, supreme de volaille d’ Orleans, cailles Hacchi Pacha, Coq en Pate Claridge’s, peches Caprice, fraises Delphine. Of the dishes of my dinner, the excellent Bortch a la Russe was served as it is in Russia, with little pates to break into it. The list of these pates in the menu of a Russian dinner is often a long one. The filet de sole, which M. Bonhomme paid me the compli- ment of christening to my name, is a quite admirable sole poche au Madere, with all the fumet of the fish retained and served with sliced champignons and pointes d'asperges. I sent my very best compliments to M. Bonhomme on his masterpiece. The coq en pate is an ornamental dish, for the fowl stuffed with all manner of rich things is encased in a paste shaped like a cock, crest and all. The outer covering is broken before the bird is carved. It is a dish of almost terrifying richness. Quite a number of the great people of the land give their banquets at Claridge’s, and out of the sheaf of the menus of these feasts I select one of the Surrey Magistrates’ Club Dinner, which shows that our Solons across the Thames dine and wine with much discretion and taste : Royal Natives. Hors d’oeuvre. Consomme Monte-Carlo. Bisque de Crabes. Turbotin braise au Champagne. Whitebait diable noir.

218 The Gourmet’s Guide to London think I went up in Gustave’s opinion when I pre- ferred three-pennyworth of soupe a foignon to pot au feu at the same price. There were three fish dishes on the card, moules Marinieres, 6d. ; merlan frit, 6d.; sole frit, iod.; and Gustave recommended the moules as being a dish of the house, and having come in that morning.

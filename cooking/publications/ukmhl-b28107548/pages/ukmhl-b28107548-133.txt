XVII 105 ROMANO’S Alfonso Nicolino Romano, a head waiter at the Cafe Royal, in 1874 bought with his savings a small fried fish shop in the Strand, converted it into a bar and restaurant, and in addition to his own name on its front added Cafe Vaudeville, for it was, and is, almost next door to the Vaudeville Theatre. Romano’s in those days possessed a central window flanked by two doors, one leading into the bar and the other to the rooms above. In the window as an ornament was a small aquarium which contained goldfish, and those fish must have lived exciting, if short, lives, for the patrons of the bar tried to feed them with cigar ash, lemon rind, burnt almonds, and torn-up notepaper, and it is even said that “ Hughie ” Drummond, one of the most amusing and most reckless of the clean-shirted Bohemians who made “ the Roman’s ” known all the world over, tried to take a swim with them. Romano was a curly-haired, humorous, quick- witted little Italian who talked a strange Anglo- Italian jargon—“Pore ole Romano e got badda addick this morning ” his usual morning greeting, was an example of it—and who was on the easiest terms of familiarity with most of his clients without ever overstepping the line. He had not very many rules as to the conduct of his business, but one from which he never departed was that he would under no circumstances make a reduction in the total of a bill.

197 The King's Guard Potage croute-au-pot. Eperlans a 1’Anglaise. Bouchees a la moelle. Cotelettes de mouton. Puree de marrons. Poularde a la Turque. Hure truffee. Sauce Cumberland. Pluviers dores. Pommes de terre Anna. Champignons grilles. Omelette soufflee. Huitres a la Diable. The spatchcocked smelts, the boar’s head, with its sharp-tasting sauce, and the soufflee, I recognised as being favourite dishes on the King’s Guard. On this evening the wearers of the black coats, as well as the red, had served his Majesty, at one time or another, in various parts of the world, and our talk drifted to the subject of the various officers’ guards all over the British world. In hospitality the castle guard at Dublin probably comes next to the guard at St James’s, for the officers of the guard fare excellently there at the Viceregal expense. The Bank guards, both in the City of London and at College Green, have compensating advantages, and the officers’ guard at Fort William, Calcutta, has helped many an impoverished subaltern to buy a polo pony. The story goes that some rich native falling ill close to the gate of Fort William, the subaltern on guard took him up to the guardroom and treated him kindly, and in consequence, in his will, the native left provision for a daily sum of rupees to be given to the subaltern on guard. These rupees are paid to the officer minus one, retained by the babus as a charge for “ stationery,” and though all the little tin gods both at Calcutta and Simla have exerted themselves to recover for the subaltern that rupee, the power of the babu has been too strong and the imaginary stationery still represents the missing rupee.

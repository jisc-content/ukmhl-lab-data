42 The Gourmet's Guide to London before this improvement any man waiting for a lady who was going to dine with him did so in the passage leading to the cafe or on the stairs—and the construction somewhere very near the roof of a masonic temple and a ballroom were all additions. M. Nicols and Madame Nicols gave personal attention to all details, and the experience M. Nicols had gained at Bercy was of great use to him in laying down the fine cellar of wines, particularly of red wines, which is the great pride of the house. To draw a very fine distinction, I would say of the Cafe Royal that it is a restaurant to which gourmets go to drink fine wines and to eat good food therewith, while at other first-class restaurants gourmets go to eat good food and to drink fine wines therewith. The only cellar of red wines that I know which can compare with that of the Cafe Royal is the cellar of Voisin’s in Paris. The wine-list of the Cafe Royal is splendidly comprehensive, and in its pages are to be found all the fine wines grown in Europe, even Switzerland being recognised, and the wines of the Rhone Valley above the Lake of Geneva being given a place in the book. M. Delacoste, the first manager I remember at the Cafe Royal, under M. Nicols, was a great authority on wines, and he bought so largely that there came a time when M. Nicols recognised that his clients with the utmost good will could never drink all the wine laid down for them, and sold a portion of it by auction. Other managers of the Cafe Royal have been Wolschleger ; Oddenino, who was appointed when M. Nicols died in 1897, and during whose tenancy of the post many of the improvements in the house were made; Gerard, mighty of girth, who had been in the kitchen of the Cafe Anglais under Duglere, and who moved on to the Ocean Hotel, Sandown ; and now Judah, w1ho had been manager of the Cecil, and who keeps a very steady hand on the tiller.

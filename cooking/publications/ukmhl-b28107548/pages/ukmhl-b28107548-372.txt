336 The Gourmets Guide to London After a time he found it entailed less loss of temper to notify this on the bill of fare, and the Cavour menu still bears the legend: “ No beers served with this dinner. Dinner without wine, sixpence extra.” The restaurant of the Cavour is a large white room, with a smaller room, also white, running back from it. Access to the bigroom is obtained from Leicester Square by a narrow corridor decorated with allegorical figures of the various months of the year—awful daubs, who- ever it was who painted them. The big room is lighted from above by a sky-light, and there are large globes of electric light in the ceiling. There are many large mirrors let into the walls, and down each side of the room run brass rails for hats and coats. There is oil- cloth on the floor, with strips of carpet over it in the gangways. The waiters go to a bar near the entrance door for the wine and other drinkables, which are served out there by Mrs Dale, or by her deputy. Some of the waiters, mostly French, were in the restaurant for many years under Philippe, but there is a new manager now with a curled-up black moustache. If any of the habitues wish to entertain guests to an elaborate dinner at the Cavour, the custom is to pay five shillings instead of three-and-six, and certain extra dishes are put into the dinner of the day for this price. The ordinary dinner, however, is so good that these additions are hardly needed. This is the menu of a three-and-six dinner I ate at the Cavour this winter. It is served from five to nine, so as to meet the convenience of all the patrons of the restaurant, from the actor who makes a hurried meal before going to the theatre, to the City man who comes in very late after a day of hard work and goes home after his dinner: Hors d’oeuvre varies. Soup. Consomme de Volaille a la Royal. Creme a l’lndienne.

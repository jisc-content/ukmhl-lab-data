18 8 The Gourmet's Guide to London had found it. The quails formed part of a little pie brought to table in a pie-dish of old blue willow pattern, and with them were coxcombs and truffles and other good things. The poulet en chaudfroid was a noble bird, all white, and in it and with it was a pink mousse delicately perfumed with curry powder, a quite admirable combination. The Ritz salad is of coeurs de romaine, with almonds and portions of tiny oranges with it. Last of the dishes in the dinner came the peche Belle Dijonnaise, which is one of the creations which have made the fame of M. Malley, and which will become historical. It is a delightful combination of peaches and black currant ice with some cassis, a liqueur of black currants, added to it, and it is called Belle Dijonnaise because of the old Burgundian proverb : A Dijon, il y a du bon vin et des jolies filles. I do not doubt that many people dined well in London on that hot June evening, but this I will warrant, that no two people, however important they might be, or whatever they paid for their dinner (my bill came to ^*2, ios.), dined better than did Lady Amalthea and I at the Ritz, and I make all my compliments to M. Malley. I should not do the Ritz full justice if I did not refer to the banquets which are served in the Marie Antoinette room and in the great white suite below the restaurant. As typical of the Ritz banquets I give you the menu of one that Lord Haldane gave to the foreign officers visiting London in June 1912, and I also give the accompanying wines : Caviar d’Esturgeon. Kroupnick Polonaise. Consomme Viveur Glace en Tasse. Timbale de Homards a FAmericaine. Supreme de Truite Saumonee a la Gelee de Chambertin. Aiguillette de Jeune Caneton a l’Ambassade.

I always rather dread the length of a City dinner, but in the case of the Mercers a happy compromise seems to have been arrived at, the dinner being im- portant enough to be styled a banquet, and not so long as to be wearying. Messrs Ring and Brymer’s cook is to be congratulated, too, for his mousse de foie gras was admirable. There were some distinguished guests at the high table. At the far end, where the Senior Warden sat, there were little splashes of colour from the ribbons of orders worn round the neck, and the sparkle of stars under the lapels of dress-coats. The Master had on his right a well-known baronet, and on his left a special correspondent who had just returned from the Far East, where for a time he was a prisoner of war. Next to him was an ex-M.P. and next to him again one of the House of Commons—an Irish Q.C.,with clean-shaven, powerful face. ^ /

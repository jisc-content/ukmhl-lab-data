Ye Olde Gambrinus 379 entrance echoes the decoration of that of its big brother, the Imperial Restaurant, a few paces farther along the street, and its marble pillars and revolving door do not suggest the entirely German surroundings we are in as soon as we have crossed the threshold.

For every day in the week there are special dishes : four soups, one of which is generally bouillon mit ei; three meat dishes and a fruit dish. There is a list of hors cFoeuvre, amongst them Berliner rollmops and

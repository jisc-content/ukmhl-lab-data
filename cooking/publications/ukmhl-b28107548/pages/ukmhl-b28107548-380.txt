344 Tfo Gourmet’s Guide to London that the authorities interfered in the matter. Mr Verrey removed his daughter from the shop, and she kept to her room to avoid public notice. The turmoil, the unmerited scandal, and the lampoons in the papers so affected the girl’s health that she pined away and died. But even then her memory was not respected, and as a good example of the want of taste of the time—the year was 1828—this riddle was published in one of the papers: “Why was Miss Verrey’s death like a window front ?” Answer: “ Because it is a paneful case.” At one period Verrey’s was known as the Cafe Francois ; but I can find no particulars concerning it under this title. I also think that Verrey must at some time or another have occupied another shop in Regent Street, for some of his advertisements, notably one of Howqua’s teas, “ as patronised by their Majesties,” were issued from 218 Regent Street, whereas Verrey’s to-day occupies 229 Regent Street.

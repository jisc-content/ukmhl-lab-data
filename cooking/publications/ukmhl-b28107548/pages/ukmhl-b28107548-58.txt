30 The Gourmet’s Guide to London If you go to the Au Petit Riche in the right frame of mind you will be abundantly amused and interested, and you will get wonderful value for the very small sum your dinner will cost you. And now for my other little restaurant in Soho. It is the Moulin d’Or at 27 Church Street. When Karl Thiele, who was in the employ of Peter Gallina at the Rendez-Vous Restaurant, married the pretty book-keeper at the Richelieu Restaurant, they de- termined to set up in business on their own account, and took a ground-floor room in Church Street, gave it a good-looking window, put a row of little trees outside, hung baskets of ferns within, and christened it Le Moulin d’Or, hoping that their mill would grind golden grist. It was a doll’s house restaurant when I first discovered it two years ago, and the great am- bition then of its proprietor and proprietress was that they might in time become sufficiently prosperous to add the first-floor room to their establishment. They have prospered, and when I lately went to dine there I found that the lower room with a restful green paper had been increased in size by taking in the passage, and that upstairs is a new restaurant room also with green walls and a large window, the dream realised of the young couple. And not only have these improvements and additions been made, but quite close to the Moulin d’Or there has been put up a wonderful windmill with electrically lighted sails which revolve, and below it a hand pointing in the direction of the restaurant and a transparency whereon are inscribed the prices of the table d’hote meals, luncheon, and dinner, and supper, for the Moulin d’Or has both its carte du jour and its table d’hote meals. For half-a-crown, on the occasion of my last visit, I could have eaten hors d’ceuvre, made my choice between a consomme and a creme soup and partaken of salmon, filet de boeuf\ roast chicken and caramel

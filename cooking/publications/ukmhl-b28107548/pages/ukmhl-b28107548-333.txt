The Maxim Restaurant 299 instead of the small glace Chantilly I felt sure that I had been put on the “ most-favoured nation” basis. But this overkindness was not needed, for, watching my neighbours, I saw that the mutton they ate looked toothsome ; I would just as soon have been served my wing of a chicken from a white-metal casserole as from a plate, and I am quite sure that the temptation to eat too many strawberries and ice brought me near the deadly sin of greediness. To anyone making a dining tour of the restaurants of London, I commend the Maxim Restaurant as a bright and cheerful place, in a neighbourhood where brightness is not the rule, where good-tempered, pleasant diners appreciate the food and the music they get for their half-crowns.

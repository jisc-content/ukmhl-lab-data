98 The Gourmet’s Guide to London Many men distinguished in art and music and literature have felt, and still feel, the fascination of The Sceptre Chop-house. You may, very likely, amongst the company at the old mahogany tables, see one of the brightest writers on Punch, or our greatest living painter of battle pictures, or the man who composed “ In the Shadows.” Upstairs are two delightful old rooms, browned by time and the London climate, with old wooden shelves, old clocks, old brass candlesticks, old chairs and tables. In one corner of the front room, by a window, stands Dickens’ chair, for it is here, so the tradition of the house has it, that Dickens used to come in his early days to write, and it was in this corner that many of his “Sketches by Boz ” were jotted down on paper. The Sceptre was a spruce, new little house at this period of Dickens’ life, and probability as well as tradition is on the side of its having been one of his early haunts.

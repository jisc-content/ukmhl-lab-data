I 2 I In the House of Commons for me in the afternoon to hear the debate, he would try again ; so upstairs we went, and he left me in charge, in the Members’ Lobby, of a benign old gentleman with a pointed white beard and wearing knee-breeches, while he went inside to see what he could do. He returned waving a card, the white- bearded gentleman looked even more benign, and took my hat and coat, and I was sent with the card up a little flight of stairs. In perfect comfort I listened to Mr Bonar Law making his points on the Unionist side, rapping with his finger-nails on the big box on the table as he did so, and then heard Sir Edward Grey, tucking his right hand under his frock-coat as though that garment pinched him below the arm, reply for the Government •, watched the members stream out for the division, heard the numbers read out, and saw the end of an historic debate. A most pleasant and interesting evening

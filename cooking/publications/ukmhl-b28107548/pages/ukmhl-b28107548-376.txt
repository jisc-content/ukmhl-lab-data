34° The Gourmet's Guide to London have been in the restaurant as long as I can remember it. There is an old head waiter, a fine specimen of a Briton—portly, with little side whiskers, dignified and unhurrying, who might have stood as a model for that Robert whose wit and wisdom used to enliven the pages of Punch, who always remembers my name and all my gastronomic history. And the head waiter in the cafe, who now has a full head of grey hair, I remember when he first came to Verrey’s a youth with the blackest of black hair. Mr Stadelmaier, though he looks on the right side of forty, remembers how young Mr George Krehl, in the days of his father’s rule, one day took me out into the yard at the back of the house to show me his dogs and the kitchen which looks out on to this open space, and the last time I dined at Verrey’s brought me in from the yard, to look at a delightful little Samoyede puppy, looking like one of the woolly toy dogs in the shops, for he too, like Mr George Krehl the younger, is a breeder of prize dogs, and has established a club for the owners of sleigh dogs. Mr Stadelmaier has now left Verrey’s and is manager of Kettner’s. The patrons of Verrey’s at dinner-time are some of them grey-headed, for I am sure that all its old patrons always return to their first love ; but there are young couples as well, and the restaurant, though it is quiet, is by no means dull. It has this distinction, rare amongst modern restaurants, that it has never sur- rendered to the modern craze for music during meals, and it is possible to talk to a neighbour at the dinner- table without raising one’s voice to a shout. I fancy that Mr Albert Krehl, the survivor of the two sons of old Mr George Krehl, would as soon think of intro- ducing gipsy music into the restaurant as they would of engaging Tango dancers to do “the Scissors” in and out of the tables.

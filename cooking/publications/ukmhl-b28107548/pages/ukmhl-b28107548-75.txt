Oyster-Houses 47 have eaten many oysters plain and oysters scalloped at the “Bear and Key,” and I never have had a grudge against any individual Whitstable oyster, so there is no injury to redress. All this, I know, should be reserved for my auto- biography ; but as I am never likely to autobiograph myself it has to be set down here. And now to talk of some of the oyster-houses of London. If on the “ Roof of the World,” the great tableland of Thibet, one British explorer met another British explorer, and the first man suddenly said “Scott’s!” the second man inevitably would answer “ Oysters,” for Scott’s window at the top of the Haymarket, with its little barrels of oysters and its crimson lobsters reposing on beds of salad stuff, and its big crabs lying on their backs and folding their vandyke-brown claws, as if in pious meditation, over their buff stomachs, is one of the landmarks of London. The old Scott’s, before the fire that gutted it, has faded from the memory of most Londoners, and the new building, with its pillars, which are ap- parently of mother-o’-pearl pressed into black marble, with bands of ornamental brass about them, and its red blinds and red-shaded lamps in the upper storeys, is accepted as being the hub of the West End of London, just as the old one was. Inside the doors are the two marble-topped counters with piles of plates upon them, and on their fronts long napkins hanging from rails. Behind the counters men in white jackets are busy opening oysters and pouring out tumblers of stout and glasses of Chablis all day long. There are on the counters stacks of thin slices of brown bread and butter and other stacks of sand- wiches of various kinds of fish and plates of prawns of coral-pink. I know of no better place than this wide oyster hall of Scott’s for a theatre-goer to eat a very light meal before going early to a theatre when

The Restaurant des Gourmets 293 if I could pick out any celebrities. There was no M. Brice this time to act as a ‘4 Who’s Who in Lisle Street,” and most of the people who were dining seemed to me to be young couples. Indeed from the tables in my vicinity a painter could have limned a series of pictures of the various stages of matrimony. At the table next to mine sat a young couple who were still in the holding hands state of love, who were thinking a great deal about each other and very little about their dinner, and who ordered anything that the waiter suggested to them ; further on was a couple, each of whom was reading a newspaper, and next to them again a young husband and wife, who had brought out to dinner a pig-tailed little girl of six or seven, whose manners were most admirable, for she bade the waiter “Good-night” when she went away with all the grace of a duchess. Beyond these again was an elderly couple, who sat together at one side of a table, an affectionate Darby and Joan. My soup when it came tasted rather too strongly of pepper, but the fried cod was excellent. The poulet au riz was all that it should be, and the pudding Gourmets was a simple version of the well- known pudding Diplomate. Prices have gone up a little at the Gourmets since my first visit there, owing, of course, to the general rise in the price of material. I was charged 3d. for the soup, 6d. for the cod; I had rushed into wild extravagance in ordering chicken, for that cost me is. 3d., and the price of the pudding Gourmets was zj.d.

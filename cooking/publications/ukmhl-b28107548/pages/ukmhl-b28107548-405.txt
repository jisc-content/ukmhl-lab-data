The Italian Invasion 369 that offers almost as much at its two-shilling table d’hote dinner as some other restaurants do at twice or more that price. A quiet, flourishing restaurant owned by an Italian, Signor Antonio Audagna, who began life as a waiter at Romano’s, is the Comedy Restaurant, in Panton Street, Haymarket. It is a comfortable restaurant, with cream walls and oval mirrors and pink-shaded lamps, and its back rooms are on a higher level than those of its Panton Street front. Its customers are very faithful to it, and, as its proprietor once told me, “ when the fathers die the sons take their places as customers.” There was some time ago a proposal to extend it so as to give it a front to the Haymarket, but that plan came to naught, and the Comedy goes on just as before in its old premises. This is a menu of the Comedy table dhote dinner, and its proprietor apparently took a hint from Philippe of the Cavour for the menu bears the legend, “ No beer served with this dinner”: Hors d’oeuvre Varies. Queue de Boeuf Printaniere Creme Chasseur. Sole a la Bourguignonne. Noisette de Pre-Sale Volnay. Spaghetti al Sugo. Foulet en Casserole. Salade. Glace Comedy. Dessert. Another quiet restaurant with a faithful clientele is Signor Pratti’s, the Ship, in Whitehall. His table dhote dinners are half-a-crown and three-and-six, and his eighteenpenny lunch, I fancy, brings to the restaurant many of the hard-worked gentlemen from Cox’s Bank, just across the way, and from the Admiralty, which is suitably just behind the Ship.

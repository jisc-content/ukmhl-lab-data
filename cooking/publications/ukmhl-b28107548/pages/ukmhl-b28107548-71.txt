The Cafe Royal 43 on the occasion of the visit of the President of the French Republic to London in 1913, was created an officer of the Order ol Merite Agricole. Sportsmen have always had a special affection for the Cafe Royal. The men who were prominent in the revival of road-coaching were all patrons of the restaurant, and any night you may see half-a-dozen well-known owners of race-horses dining there. The Stage, the Stock Exchange, and Literature also have a liking for the old house, and hunting men love it. When I mentioned it as the id§al place for a dinner of bachelor gourmets, I did not mean that men do not bring their wives and sisters and sweethearts there. They do. But the Cafe Royal does not lay itself out to capture the ladies. I never heard of anyone having afternoon tea there, and when a lady tells me that she likes dining at the Cafe Royal I always mentally give her a good mark, for it shows that she places in her affections good things to drink and good things to eat before those “springes to catch wood- cock,” gipsy bands in crimson coats, and palm lounges. In the great gilded cage of the restaurant and the big room the windows of which open on to Glass- house Street, the custom is to eat the lunch of the day, or to select dishes from it, while dinner is an a la carte meal. If one entertains a lady at dinner one probably orders a dinner which canters through the accepted courses, and I have by me the menu of such a one : Hors d’oeuvre Russe. Pot-au-feu. Sole Waleska. Noisette cTagneau Lavalliere. Haricots verts a l’Anglaise. Parfait de foie gras. Caille en cocotte. Salade. Pole Nord.

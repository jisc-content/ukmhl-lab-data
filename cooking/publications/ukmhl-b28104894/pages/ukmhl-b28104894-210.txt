200 MEATS. should be young and well fed. Put the trimmings, such as the neck, giblets, &c., into a pan with salt, pepper, a blade of mace, an onion, and a good bunch of herbs, cover this all with water, or, if liked, with strong veal or shank bone stock ; bring it to the boil, and let it simmer steadily till all the goodness is extracted from the bones, skimming it carefully. Now line the edges of the pie dish with a strip of puff or flaky paste, put in some of the chicken, then some ham, and if liked, little bails of delicate forcemeat (this is not necessary), cover this with sliced hard-boiled eggs, and season pretty highly with white pepper and salt; now repeat these layers till the dish is full, adding the minced livers of the chickens, and some mushrooms if at hand, with a good dust of minced parsley, squeezing the juice of half a lemon over it all. Now strain the stock on to \\oz. of white roux (or loz. each of flour and butter stirred over the fire till perfectly smooth), let this boil up till of the consistency of cream, and pour it level over the chicken, &c. Cover with puff pastry half an inch thick, and bake about an hour and a half ; then pour in through the opening at the top about a gill of boiling cream. Serve hot or cold. If liked, the bird may be boned to begin with and half a pound of any rich forcemeat to taste should be used, as well as the ham, eggs, mushrooms, &c., a little sherry being added to the gravy. If to be eaten cold for a picnic, dissolve about half an ounce of best leaf gelatine in half a pint of strong veal or poultry stock, letting it boil in a fourth part, and add this to the pie at the last.

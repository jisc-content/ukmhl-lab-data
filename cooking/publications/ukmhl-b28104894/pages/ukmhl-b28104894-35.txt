The time required for broiling depends on the thickness of the meat, which should never be less than l^in. thick, and is usually l|in. thick. A steak to be well done, if 1^-in. thick, will take fifteen minutes, or, if underdone, twelve minutes’ cooking; but, if thicker, will need from eighteen minutes upwards if to be well cooked, or fifteen minutes upwards if liked underdone. The average cook will seldom be successful in broiling a steak over ljin. thick, though a chef glories in a well-cooked Chateau- briand, which, in these days, means simply a rump steak from 2in. to 2fin. thick. The secret of broiling is care.

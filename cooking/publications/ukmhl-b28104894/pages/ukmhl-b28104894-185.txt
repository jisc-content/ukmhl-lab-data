175 GAME!. Huffs and reeves are usually caught in traps and fattened for tlie market. They should be cooked pretty fresh, trussed and treated like woodcock. The ruff is the cock and the reeve the hen bird. Their season is March to May. Ptarmigan are cooked like grouse, &c., and must be freely basted whilst roasting and served very hot, often with cranberry or rowanberry jelly. Their flavour, which is peculiar, is as much disliked by some as it is appreciated by others. These birds should be well hung. Prairie and hazel hens may be treated like fowls or pigeons, or like partridges. They are better for barding or larding, and the former is good if sent to the table with a bigarade sauceâ€” brown sauce flavoured with orange juice and peel, using Seville orange for choice and red wine. Baste well and roast for an hour or so, according to size. These birds, like ptarmigan, are often sent over from Russia and America frozen, so should be hung for an hour or two in the kitchen before use to thaw them, and should be well washed inside and out (British game does not need this) with soda, or vinegar, and water. Many people aver also that this foreign game is better for skinning before roasting, a treatment which certainly improves foreign black game. Capercailzie should always be chosen young, as with age the pronounced flavour derived from the nature of its food will render it uneatable to most persons. It is better for being barded, the bacon being lifted off a few minutes before it is finished to allow of the breast browning

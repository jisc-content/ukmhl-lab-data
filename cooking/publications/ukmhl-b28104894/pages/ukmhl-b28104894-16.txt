MEATS. 6 quite red, the sheep is little more than a lamb, and under a year old; if the bones are beginning to whiten at the upper anil lower bones, though the middle of the breast bone is still reddish, the animal is between one and two years ; and thenceforward the bones will grow more generally white till at four years old they are perfectly white. Always choose small-boned, rather small mutton, with very white and firm waxy fat, not too abundant, but evenly distributed, the lean being of a purple-brown of a darkish tint when freshly cut, whilst if seen through the skin of the leg it is apt to look quite purple; it should be fine in the grain, plump- looking, and much drier than beef on the surface. Well-hung good mutton looks quite dry, whilst its colour darkens almost to black ; such meat is always good. In cool, dry weather, in an airy dry larder, mutton will hang advantageously for a fortnight to three weeks, and at any time should hang a week before eating. Like beef, frozen mutton is coming into use, though it is not so popular as it deserves to be for two reasons : one is the trouble in thawing: it properly, the second is that when thawed it is very apt to look anything but appetising in its raw state.

All this, however, disappears when it is cooked; and if properly treated, frozen

MEATS. 126 that will then be hidden quite free of down, as you cannot, as with the rest of the bird, remove the overlooked down by re-singeing. The accompany- ing illustration (Fig. 1) is the best guide for the singeing process. Remember that singeing is only to remove the down, so, if after plucking any stumps of feathers are left in, these must be care- fully pulled out, not singed off, which will not effectually remove them. Many cooks singe their poultry, even if trussed by the poulterer, and for this purpose pour a little methylated spirit into an old tin, light it, and, catching the bird at each end, twist it quickly over the flame. The fowl being carefully plucked and singed, it must next be drawn. For this lay the bird flat on its back on the table or a board, cut a slit in the skin of the neck, and through this draw out the neck and cut it off close to the body, cutting off the extra skin so as just to allow a flap of skin large enough to cover the opening of the neck. You now slip your fingers through this opening (some cooks for this cut off the vent and use this opening) and draw out all the inside, carefully wiping out the inside and the flap with a cloth. Be very careful when doing this not to break anything inside, for if by accident the gall bladder should burst it will give a bitter taste that only the most careful washing out subsequently will remove. The next thing is to truss the bird. Scrape the legs well after cutting off the claws (scalding them in boiling water helps this scraping immensely), remove the tips of the pinions and the spur on the second

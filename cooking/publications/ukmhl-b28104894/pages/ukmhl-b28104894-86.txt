76 MEATS. hand sliced truffles, seasoning this all -well with quatre epices; now tie it back neatly into shape, and place it in a pan, previously lined with 3oz. or 4<oz. of clarified dripping, an onion or two, one or two tomatoes, a carrot, and a little celery, all sliced, a good bouquet, and a few mushrooms; cover with a sheet of buttered paper, fit down the lid of the pan, and let its contents fry till nicely cjratine at the bottom of the pan (i.e., from fifteen to twenty minutes), then add a good gill of claret or Burgundy, and a wineglassful of eau de vie, and when this has been well reduced by gentle simmering, pour in half a pint of good brown stock, and set the pan, closely covered, in the oven for two to two and a half hours, keeping it well basted all the time, and adding more stock as that in the pan reduces. When cooked, lift out the leg, brush it over with just liquid glaze, allow the liquor in the pan to cool a little, then skim off the fat, add to it about half a pint of good brown sauce or espagnole, as you please, let it boil up, then strain some over and round the joint, and send up the rest in a sauceboat. Garnish the leg with a hot financiere garnish, some button mushrooms, sliced truffles, and either prawns or crayfish. This is a somewhat expensive if excellent dish, but it need hardly be said that the same kind of dish may be evolved by using less expensive materials, leaving out the truffles, financiere, Ac., or replacing them with broiled mushrooms, turned and stewed olives, and some good shrimp sauce, only in this ca,se do not call if Â® Purand,

Eemember it must never be let go off the simmer, and must be looked to now and again to see if it needs skimming. If the liquid is allowed to boil and so evaporate, the part of the meat left uncovered will turn black and harden. When cooked and quite tender the meat should be lifted on to a hot dish and served with a garnish of its own vegetables, neatly trimmed, or a nice young cabbage (parboiled for twenty minutes in boiling water, then finished off in a little of the beef liquid), drained and quartered. The whole of the liquid of the pot au feu is never served with the meat, but is strained off and used for a light consomme, or a base for any soup such as Julienne, &c., whilst the meat is served with either sauce piquante or sauce tomate handed round in a tureen. This bouilli, if properly made, will be found deliciously tender and succulent, and forms a nice change from ordinary boiled beef. When cold it makes an excel- lent dish en vinaigrette, i.e., sliced thinly or minced, and served strewed with minced chives and parsley and a French salad dressing, or by the following recipe: Slice thinly some beef (either roast or boiled will do)—or some people mince it roughly—and place a layer of this in a salad dish, then sprinkle it thickly D

Tie it into shape in a clean cloth, and place it in a convenient-sized pan previously lined with a slice of veal, some ham or bacon trimmings, some sliced carrots, spice, and a good bunch of herbs ; moisten it all with a good glass of wine and half a pint of stock, bring it gently to the boil, fhen let it simmer slowly and gently for four hours ; lift the head (after well draining it, and removing the cloth, string, Ac.) on to a hot dish ; add a glass of Madeira or sherry to the sauce, after straining and well skimming the latter, and let it boil up sharply to reduce it a little, season rather highly with lemon juice, coralline pepper, &c., pour it over and round the head, and serve with a good financiere garnish.

VEAL. 61 the pilaff as taste and convenience dictate. These pilaffs are equally good made with fowls (especially old ones), mutton, &c. Hotpot.â€”This is excellent made of veal, though it is a form seldom seen. For this wash and dry lflb. of scrag of veal and cut it up into neat pieces; also cut up about 4oz. of fat bacon or pickled pork into medium-sized dice. Have ready parboiled 21b. of potatoes and lib. scalded onions; slice these rather thickly; prepare a flavouring mixture by well mixing a teaspoonful each of salt and finely minced parsley, half a teaspoonful of freshly ground pepper (black), and a good pinch of powdered thyme; now line a well-buttered hot-pot dish with potatoes, then put in the meat, and, lastly, the onions, repeating these layers till the dish is full, finishing with the potatoes on top, pour in half a pint of stock or water, cover the dish with an old plate and bake for one and a half hours; then lift off the plate, put some little bits of butter over the top, and return it to the oven to brown for a little. Needless to say that for domestic purposes clarified dripping is quite as good as butter. The above recipes will give an idea of the many ways in which veal may be served ; but, manifestly, in a book of this size it is impossible to give any- thing like an exhaustive list. To show how great the variety may be it may be mentioned tl a" all the following garnishes suit fricandeau, roast or stewed loin (or longe), &c. : d la Bruxellaise, i.e., with delicately boiled Brussels sprouts, tiny sausages, and bechamel sauce.

150 MEATS. well scraped rind of some bacon, as taste and conveni- ence dictate ; season with salt, and some peppercorns, and pour in about one and a half pints of good bone or poultry stock, and about half a pint of light white wine (or failing this put a good wineglassful of sherry or Marsala in a small tumbler, add the juice of half a lemon, fill up nearly to the top of the tumbler with water and use), and if liked a table- spoonful of brandy. This is not needed if sherry is used. Cover down closely, bring it to the boil, then only allow it to simmer, gently but steadily, till the bird is cooked, turning it over once or twice in the process. The length of time it will take depends on the size and age of the bird, and the cook; from two to five hours being the extreme limits ; but it cannot be too strongly impressed on the cook that the slower the fowl is cooked the more excellent will it be on the table. Elderly fowls, and, indeed, any kind of poultry are cooked thus with advantage. If to be eaten cold (when it is particularly delicious), lift the pan from the fire, and turn its contents out into an earthenware pan and allow them all to grow cold together. If to be eaten hot, remove the paper and barding bacon, and place it in a baking tin with about half a pint of its gravy and set it in the oven for about eight or ten minutes to glaze, keeping it well basted during the process. Meanwhile strain the rest of the gravy, free it from fat, boil it up sharply to reduce it slightly, and send to table either separately or over and round the bird. A turkey cooked thus is, abroad, called en daube, and the process is applied to almost any kind of meat.

POULTRY. 121 shop ready trussed for cooking, at a price that com- pares most favourably with, and inspires doubts of the honesty of, the prices of their regular tradesman. These fowls are simply birds that the shopman knows require instant cooking to “ save their lives,” as an Irish cook once expressed it, and therefore he trusses them to the best advantage and offers them at a price that will tempt customers and rid his shop of undesirable goods. Such birds frequently answer well, if bought at a good shop, and cooked at once as the shopman will almost always advise, but woe to the housewife who keeps them till next day ! A ehicken or fowl should have a clear unwrinkled skin, the flesh being plump and firm. This, again, is a snare to the young housekeeper, as the town fashion of breaking the breastbone of the fowl gives it an appearance of plumpness that deceives the unwary, who judge by appearance and not by feel. A modern form of preparing poultry and game for table, removes the breastbone altogether, which gives the same appearance of plumpness by careful . skewering, whilst obviating the trouble caused the carver by the smashed breastbone. But this deft manipulation is only known to the most first-rate poulterers, and not even to all of these. For broiling, choose the whitest skinned fowls, and iisregard the colour of the legs, as these are removed for boiling, braising, or stewing; but for roasting, the colour of the skin is not so important, the whiteness of the legs being in this case more to be jonsidered. For roasting and boiling, fowls of a rear and under should be chosen; for braising

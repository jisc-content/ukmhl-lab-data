GAME. .167 as for poultry. One test much favoured by experi- enced cooks is to take the bird by the lower man- dible of the beak, and hold it out straight; if old, it will remain stiff and straight; if young, the beak will give way and bend in the middle. The same rules apply to grouse and moor fowl generally, though, as a rule, they will hang longer than the fatter-fleslied low-countrv birds. For instance, a pheasant from the Eastern counties, as carefully fed as the barndoor poultry, will not keep half as long as the same bird which has skirmished for a liveli- hood on a Scotch moor, though, experto crecle, the difference of flavour between the two birds is won- derful. Woodcock, snipe, and plover do not keep well, as they are undrawn and sent to the table with the “trail,” as it is technically called. Wild duck also, of all kinds, will only hang a few days. Pheasant to Poast.—Truss like a fowl for roasting, though some persons like the unplucked head kept on, when it should be carefully wrapped in buttered paper all the time of cooking, the paper being only removed when the bird is dished. In this case a few of the tail feathers are also restored at the same time. But this is rather old-fashioned nowadays, and is, in any case, a troublesome fancy for the carver. Most cooks nowadays bard the bird with a slice of slitted bacon, removing this just at least for a minute or two to brown the bird, replac- ing it (or not) afterwards, as taste dictates. This barding is indispensable when, as in the present day, baking so often has to replace roasting. One point is imperative, aud that is the necessity for constant

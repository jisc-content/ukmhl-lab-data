Gather up the rest of the paste, again roll it out and cut it into squares, place two or three of these one on top of the other, gather up the corners in one hand and cut the knob thus formed through twice at right angles, and either put this rose lightly into the hole previously made or put it on the baking tin by the side of the pie. Dip a pastry brush into some lightly beaten raw yolk of egg, and brush the whole pie delicately over with this. Bake from one and three-quarters to two hours in a moderate oven; when cooked, lift the rose from the hole in the paste, and pour through the latter, by means of a funnel, about one and a half gills of hot, rich gravy, or stock.

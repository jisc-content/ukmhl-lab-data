Beef, if salted, takes about twenty minutes sim- mering to the pound after the initial boiling up and skimming (this takes from five to ten minutes), and from ten to fifteen minutes over; but this, it must be carefully remembered, is counted from tlie boiling up and skimming, as said before. Ox heart.â€”This is frequently considered too coarse and greasy for a dainty menu; but if carefully pre- pared it will be found very palatable. The great secret in its cooking is careful cleansing and stuffing, while, when served, the plates and dishes must be piping liot; indeed, hot water dishes are best for this. Choose a heart that has hung three or four days, remove all the pipe and the blood, and soak it for an hour in warm water (some cooks even parboil it) ; then wipe it well, season with salt and coralline pepper, and fill it well with rather highly flavoured veal stuffing, sewing it up carefully. Now rub it all over with warm dripping, wrap it in a sheet of paper generously brushed with dripping, tie it up, and eithe rset it on the roasting tin in the oven, or hang it up, thick end uppermost, and roast in front of a clear fire. A fair-sized heart takes from three to three and a half hours to cook. Keep it plentifully basted whichever way you cook it, and when cooked remove the paper, and place on a very hot dish, with any rich sauce to taste, a garnish of cooked vege- tables, and currant jelly.

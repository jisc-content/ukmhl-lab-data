166 MEATS. kind, generally known as the reel-leg partridge, require hanging nearly a third longer than the indigenous grey bird, if it is to have a good flavour and tender fl isli. But remember in this, as in all cases, no game bird will taste appreciably “ high ” when cooked unless it has boon hung long enough to become, whilst raw, distinctly, if only slightly, offensive. In fact the tales most cooks could tell, an’ they would, of the state of game before it is cooked, which yet meets with approval at table, would make a good many people inclined to forswear such viands for ever and a day. To know when a bird is properly fit to cook, notice first the condition of the eyes: if deeply sunk, the bird has been killed for several days ; if, when the lids are lifted, the eyes are bright and full, not more than two, or three at the utmost, have elapsed since it was shot. Next, if a feather can be pulled from the tail or the lower part of the back without resistance, the bird is sufficiently hung for all practical purposes, and will be quite tender; if, however, on blowing up the feathers on the lower part of the breast, the flesh has a distinctly green tinge, the sooner that bird is cooked the better for all concerned. Remember the brighter and smoother the plumage the better is the probable condition of the bird. Those that have been shattered by shot, or have, by any accident, been allowed to get wet in any way, or have been packed closely for some time, should always be cooked first, for they will not keep satisfactorily, and if you are buying game, avoid such scrupulously. Otherwise, the test for game is pretty much the same

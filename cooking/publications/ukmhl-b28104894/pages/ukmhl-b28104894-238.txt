MEATS. 228 poultry or game (previously seasoned with salt, pepper, and finely minced herbs), sprinkling these with a little sherry, then a layer of sliced foie gras en terrine, then a layer of very thinly sliced fat bacon, and continue these layers till the dish is full, raising it well in the centre in dome shape ; and lastly, cover the top with a slice of fat bacon and two or three whole bay leaves, all well sprinkled with sherry ; cover with paste, and finish as above. Before serving it the top crust should be cut off neatly with a sharp knife, the bacon and bay leaves removed, and a layer of chopped aspic put over it, and the cover replaced. This makes a most delicious pie for the Christmas sideboard, and is far less troublesome to make than it sounds. Terrine of Game {without game).—At the bottom of a round tin or mould place a few strips of fat bacon, then a layer of forcemeat, made as indicated below, then boned joints of rabbit or poultry, or small fillets of veal, filling up all spaces with the forcemeat, and placing more bacon at the top. Pour half a teacupful of gravy over all, put on the upper crust, fastening the edges well and trimming accor- ding to fancy, When half baked draw the pie out of the oven and brush it all over with beaten egg. Bake altogether about an hour and a half. Force- meat: fib. of calf’s liver fried and simmered until perfectly tender, then pounded with an equal quan- tity of fat bacon, about a teacupful of breadcrumbs, a tablespoonful of mixed and sifted herbs (sage, thyme, parsley, &c.), black pepper and allspice, of each half a teaspoonful, and the same of salt. Mix thoroughly.

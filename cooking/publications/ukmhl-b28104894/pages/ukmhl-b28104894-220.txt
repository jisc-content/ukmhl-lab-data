210 MEATS. pigeon; the turkey was then laid inside the goose, the fowl inside the turkey, the pheasant inside the fowl, the partridge inside the pheasant, and the whole fastened and laid in a pa-te-lined timbale, the interstices being filled up with sliced ham and tongue and a rich forcemeat, such as was given for the grouse or the rabbit pie, made with the livers of the birds, &c. Clarified butter was then poured over it all, the paste cover fixed on, well brushed over with beaten egg, and the whole baked in a good oven for four hours. I have known this dish to be wrapped in buttered paper, then in water paste, and roasted like a haunch of venison. It is an excellent, if somewhat expensive dish, but a very dainty imitation may be made by putting a partridge inside a good fowl, and a quail or a lark inside the partridge, a lump of pate de foie gras going inside the lark, then packing the whole as above in a raised pie mould lined with good raised pie crust, filling it up as described for the larger pie, with the addition of some pate de foie gras.

MEATS. 224 blanched, and proceed to line the head in the same manner as a galantine, by putting a layer of: force- meat an inch thick, then fill up with the tongue, cut in six pieces lengthwise, and with the truffles and pistachio nuts, add salt and pepper and a little grated nutmeg; roll it up in a strong cloth, which should be greased, and tie it at both ends to preserve the shape of the head, place it in a braising pan with sufficient stock to cover it, and with any trimmings of game, poultry, or beef bones at hand, put in two carrots, three onions, parsley, thyme, a blade or two of mace, and half a dozen cloves. Leave it to simmer gently for five hours, take out the head, and arrange the cloth tightly round it to preserve the shape, as it will have shrunk considerably in boiling; put it into a deep pan, pour the stock on to it, and leave until quite cold; then remove the cloth, place it in the oven for a few minutes to melt off the jelly, or wipe it with a cloth dipped in hot water and wrung out; glaze it over with a dark glaze, and ornament with aspic jelly, white of egg, and beet- root. Italian paste or macaroni is also often used for the ornamentation; it should be boiled first for ten minutes, and thoroughly divided by pouring cold water over it. Each piece should then be laid on with a trussing needle, and may be very tastefully arranged in a variety of devices. Lard can also be used plain, or coloured red or green, with cochineal or spinach greening, and it should be piped on in the same way as sugar icing is done in ornamenting cakes. All this, however, needs taste and judgment, for if the least overdone it is hopelessly vulgarised.

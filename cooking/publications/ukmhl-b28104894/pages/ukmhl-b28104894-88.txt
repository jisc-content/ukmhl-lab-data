?8 meats. Stuffed Loin of Mutton.—Bone a nice well-hung loin, lay it flat on a board, remove all unnecessary fat, and spread it with a goad layer of well-made veal stuffing, to which you have added either a minced anchovy or two, or some essence of anchovy ; now roll up the loin neatly, tying it into shape with broad tapes, brush it all over with liquefied butter, and roast or bake it for one and a half to two hours according to size; it is then taken up, freed from the tapes, and brushed over with liquid glaze ; it can be served plain with its own gravy or with espagnole, or brown caper sauce as you please, or it may be placed on a nice puree of any good vegetables (minced and sieved turnip tops, re-heated in a little gravy and butter are particularly good), to taste, and serve with any sauce you like. It is also good d la Milanaise, if served with cooked macaroni or spaghetti, mixed with grated cheese, and good tomato sauce. It may be observed that a very delicate fricandeau can be made by lifting the whole fillet off the bones of a loin; line a srutable stewpan with 3oz. or 4oz. of clarified dripping, a slice or two of beef, or veal and ham, or any trimmings of these, with a carrot or two, an onion sliced, and a good bouquet; lay the fricandeau on this, cover with a buttered paper, and let it fry gently for twelve to fifteen minutes; then add some good stock and allow it to braise very slowly till perfectly done, when you drain and skin the fricandeau, glaze it, and serve on any nice puree of endive, spinach, sorrel, mushrooms, &c. Breast of Mutton.—This is a part of the sheep that is usually despised, but with a, little care it produces

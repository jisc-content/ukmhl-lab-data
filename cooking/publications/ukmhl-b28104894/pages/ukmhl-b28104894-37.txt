Eeinember that when simmering, water ripples gently all over, but does not bubble; if water bubbles whilst the meat is sup- posed to be simmering, it is a sign that it is getting on to the boil; whilst if its surface is perfectly still, there is not enough heat, and the meat is only steeping. Stewing differs from boiling simply by a less quantity of liquid being used, and the absolute necessity for slow cookery. A stew allowed to boil is a stew allowed to spoil. For stewing, the meat is put into the pan with its accompanying vegetables, and the liquid, cold, is poured over and round it, allowing about half a pint of liquid (water or stock) to each full pound of meat. The cover is now placed on the pan, the meat brought very gently to the boil, then at'once drawn to the side and only allowed to simmer for the rest of the time, care being taken that it does not “ catch ” or burn in the process. Where meat cooked in this way has to be left to mind itself, it is wise to lay a sheet of buttered paper over it, under the pot lid, as this diminishes the risk of burning. Some people first brown the meat and vegetables to be stewed by heating a little dripping (say an ounce for 21b. or 31b. of meat), then laying in the meat, &c., and frying it for twelve to fifteen minutes till lightly coloured, the cold liquid being then poured in and the whole finished off as before. Cooked thus, it is perhaps more succulent than when plainly stewed, when the meat is apt to have parted with a good deal of its savour in favour of its gravy, &c.

MEATS. 12 The hough and the shin are also used for what cooks call “ gravy meat,” though for this in reality a coarse strip known as the “ skirt ” is to be preferred, and very often the top of the hough, if nicely stewed, will produce an excellent dish of stewed steak, &c. The ox-liead makes excellent brawn and soup, and the cheek if nicely spiced, seasoned, and stewed, will produce a very appetising “ stew ” for household use. The tail is used for soup, and also for entrees, as are also the liver, sweet and throat breads, the palate, &c.

The loin is roasted, so also is the neck ; the fillet is used for fricandeau, cutlets, &c.; the breast can be stewed, braised, or collared; the shoulder is

MEATS. 118 some time, larded, braised, and finally served with a rich Espagnole sauce made with venison bones, &câ€ž garnished with stewed prunes, when it is known as Cimier (saddle), gigot, or quartier de chevreuil, d la St. Hubert, according to the joint used. This can also be prepared with fresh venison, but must then be marinaded for a good deal longer. Lastly, if it is desired to preserve venison for future use, the joints may be pretty thickly dusted with powdered charcoal, which does not in the least affect the flavour; or, after cutting the meat up into joints, the bones should be carefully removed, each joint being carefully cleansed and cut into suitable pieces, convenient for their subsequent use, and then packed tightly in a large jar. Strew in with them some crushed bay leaves, peppercorns, and pounded mace; cover the whole with good beef suet or mutton fat, melted over the fire and poured in when lukewarm ; when the fat has set tie a muslin over the top, and store in a cold place. Woodcock, snipe, or indeed any form of game, can also be preserved in this way. Separate joints of venison can also be preserved by merely brushing them all over quickly with lukewarm fat; when this is cold tie the meat up in buttered muslin so as to keep off flies and dust. The joint treated in this manner must hang till it is wanted, and not be kept with fresh provisions, but this method rather weakens the peculiar flavour, which is one of the characteris- tics of good game.

MEATS. 22 whilst for thin pieces, such as ribs, &c., fifteen minutes for each pound, and fifteen minutes over will be ample. Yet a good deal has to be considered even with these averages. Always test a joint before lifting it from the fire by pressing the thickest part with the finger; if it gives, the meat is ready, if it resists, however slightly, it is not thoroughly cooked. In roasting, be careful to have the fire pro- perly made up, and keep it duly replenished from the back, so as never to let it get low, and always to keep a bright surface towards the meat. Of course, if the fire is let down, the roasting of the meat suffers. Again, attention must be paid to draughts ; a screen should always be placed round the meat and fh*e to exclude these, or the joint will take much longer to cook. It should be for the first ten minutes, as near as may be to the fire without actually scorching it, so as to close the pores of the meat on the surface, thus retaining the gravy, and preventing the hardening and consequent toughening of the albumen, a substance contained in all meats —and also in eggs—on which the nutritive value of both depends. (The principle is the same as in frying, when the substance to be fried is plunged into so-called boiling fat to crisp and close up the surface.) This being accomplished, the meat should be drawn a little away from the fire and allowed to cook more slowly. An important part to be noted is the basting; this consists of pouring the gravy and fat that has “dripped” from the joint at intervals over it to keep the surface moist; this pro- cess should be repeated frequently during the

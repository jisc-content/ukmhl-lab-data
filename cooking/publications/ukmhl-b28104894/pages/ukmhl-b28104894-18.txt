8 MEATS. out of doors, on the young spring grass. Lamb, to be in perfection, should he from four to five months old. Fresh pork requires great care in its choice, and should never be bought, from any but a first-rate source; moreover, it should never be used in the summer, as it is then absolutely unhealthy. It should be small, and not too fat. For eating fresh, a pig of five to six score (1001b. to 1201b.) should be chosen, as it gives the nicest and daintiest joints. The fat should be a pure white, free from any bruises or discolourations. which (like kernels in the flesh) betray unhealtliiness. The lean should be of a faint mushroom pink, closely and finely grained, and per- fectly even in texture. For eating fresh, a “ porker,” i.e., a pig of one year or under, should be chosen. It is well to bear in mind, when choosing meat, that the smaller, in reason, the more appetising the meat is. This is specially the case where a small family has to be catered for. For instance, 41b. to 61b. is an ample-sized piece for a few people; but when taken from a large beast, if the ribs or sirloin be chosen, it will look like nothing but an overgrown chop ; whereas if cut from a small animal, a piece of equal weight will be a neat miniature joint. This applies to all animals, to none, however, more forcibly than to oxen. But butchers will not supply this as a rule to any but regular and valued customers, as small meat is by no means so profitable to them. Having settled on the meat you intend to buy, it is well to have a clear notion of what joints there are, and we may as well begin with beef.

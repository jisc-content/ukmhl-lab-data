It must also be remembered that a little longer time is allowed when birds are cooked in the oven, on account of the delay in opening the oven door, and drawing out the meat to baste it, &c., which, of course, interrupts the cooking. Fowl, to roast.â€”Choose a nice plump fowl that has hung for one or two days, place a medium onion and a lump of salt butter, of the same size, inside it, then rub the bird all over with good clarified dripping, cover the breast with a large barde of fat bacon, or wrap the bird up in white paper previously rubbed all over with butter or clarified dripping, as you please, and roast in front of the fire,

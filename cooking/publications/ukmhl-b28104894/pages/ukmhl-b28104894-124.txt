It will he found convenient, unless the venison is very fat of itself, to add some slices of mutton fat cut from the neck of a well hung sheep (treated as for hash as given above), and cook this with it. Needless, of course, to add that the venison is improved by having been well marinaded previous to cooking. Another Scotch, and most excellent, dish is minced collops, capital— like the preceding—when made of beef, but naturally extremely delicate when made of venison. For this choose a good fleshy piece, and mince it fine, after removing the skin, sinews, gristle, &c.; dredge generously with flour, season well with quatre epices, or kitchen pepper, and mix with a little water or stock; heat some butter or clarified dripping in the pan, and in this brown the mince and a little very finely chopped onion, beating the meat with a wooden spoon all the time it is cooking to prevent its getting lumpy, which it will do if neglected; a little more stock may be added from time to time, to get it to the desired consistency. Serve with sippets of toast round it, and, if liked, poached eggs on top. Beef, veal, hare, &c., can all be cooked in this way. The onion is a matter of taste, but most people like it; indeed, many cooks also allow a bunch of herbs to stew with the meat, of course removing this before dishing it. Venison Steaks are also good, and easily prepared; cut them into shape, brush them well with liquefied butter, roll in seasoned breadcrumbs, and broil over a clear sharp fire. Serve with good venison gravy

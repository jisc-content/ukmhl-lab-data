POULTRY. 133 singed, and, if possible, should be drawn directly they are hilled. They are trussed like fowls. Geese are trussed somewhat differently. After careful plucking and singeing, and the perfect removal of all quill stumps, cut off the feet and the pinions at the first joint, and the neck close to the back, leaving enough of the skin to form a flap to cover this opening; now draw the bird, well wash and wipe it both inside and out, pass a skewer through the under part of the wing, through the body, and so out through the other wing, then draw the legs up close to the body and skewer them into position in the same way. Some cooks flatten, if they do not actually break, the breastbone, to improve the birdâ€™s appearance, but this is a case of taste, as is also the question of breaking the back- bone, which some aver makes the goose sit more firmly in the dish. (At the same time it may be observed that neither of these fractures are com- fortable for the carver.) The bird is then stuffed, after which the vent must be cut off, and the rump slipped through a slit made on purpose in the skin, as this prevents the escape of the stuffing. It should be remembered that the appearance of a a goose depends greatly on the neatness and com- pactness of the trussing. A duck is treated very much like a goose as far as trussing is concerned, and, like it, may be boiled, braised, or roasted, though the latter is the most usual method of cooking. On the Continent a very favourite way of cooking elderly birds of all kinds is en daube, a very savoury method, which has the

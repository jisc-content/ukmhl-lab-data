100 MEATS. formerly considered indispensable. Very often now, the fat, formerly considered the tit-bit, is pared off, and then, naturally, pork takes a shorter time to roast. But the average time is fully twenty minutes to the pound, and twenty minutes over. These rules apply to all joints of pork, so need not be repeated. The usual accompaniments of roast pork are apple sauce, and its own gravy, but these may be varied almost indefinitely. Amongst the sauces which go admirably with roast pork are sauce Bobert, remoulade, tomato, poivrade, &e., and these can be served with either the leg, the loin, the spare rib, or the best end of the neck, (which forms a very nice little joint), indifferently. Almost any joint of pork may be pickled and boiled ; for instance, take a leg of pork that has been salted for a few days, and weigh it carefully ; now soak it for half an hour in cold water (this improves the colour), then lift it out, dust it with sifted flour, and tie it up in a delicately clean cloth. Put it into a stewpan with sufficient cold water to cover it thoroughly ; bring this gently to the boil, then skim it well, cover the pan down closely, draw it to the side of the stove, and let it simmer gently till done, allowing twenty-five minutes to each pound of meat. Serve on a hot dish gar- nished with separately boiled cabbages, well drained and quartered, and with neatly shred cooked parsnip. Pease pudding should be served in a separate dish. For this soak 21b. of split peas for twelve hours or so, wash them well, and place them in a pan well covered with cold water; bring this to the boil, then at once strain off the peas, and rinse them

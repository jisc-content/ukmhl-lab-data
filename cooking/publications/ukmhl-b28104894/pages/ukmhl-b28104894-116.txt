For the chestnut and sausage-meat stuffing, peel, scald, and blanch forty to fifty good chestnuts; and boil them in a pint of milk, with a pinch of salt and -Â§oz. of butter till quite tender, and mix them with a pound of good sausage-meat. Fill the body of the pig with this and sew it up carefully. Or it may be stuffed with a truffle farce, and served with Pcri- geux sauce. For the truffie stuffing, well wash, brush, and dry a pound of nice fresh truffles, and quarter them; mince and pound to a paste ^lb. of very fat bacon, and in this stew the truffles with half a teaspoonful of minced thyme, a shallot, a bay- leaf, and pepper and salt to taste, for ten minutes or so, when the farce is ready for use. Another form of sucking pig is stuffed with a very rich veal force- meat (either with or without pate de foie gras). The pig is tied up in a cloth and stewed very gently in stock with the usual stock vegetables. It is then lifted out, the cloth removed, dished on a hot dish, and sent to table with good espagnole; or, if pre- ferred, with an allemande and a garnish of mush- rooms. If left to cool in its liquor, it is very good cold.

In America, a roast haunch of venison is often sent to table with the following sauce : Mix together a pint of rich tomato puree with a gill of good strong stock (or a teaspoonful of glaze or of Lemco), then stir in a teaspoonful of chopped capers, and when these are all blended add a good spoonful of currant or rowan jelly, season with salt, a pinch each of sugar and ground ginger, cayenne, and a squeeze of lemon juice, thickening this sauce if necessary with a spoonful of brown roux. Send this to table, very hot, in a boat, pouring a little plain gravy from itself round the joint. f

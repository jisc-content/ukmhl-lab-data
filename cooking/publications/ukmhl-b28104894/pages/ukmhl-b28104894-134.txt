124 MEATS. For the benefit of those who breed their own table- fowl, it may be mentioned that, for table purposes, perhaps the best breed is the Dorking, which is white-legged, broad-breasted, and possessed of a very white and delicate flesh. Next to these, for table purposes, come the Crevecoeur and the La Fleche, both French breeds, and very celebrated in their own country, these, however, are black-legged; then follow the Houdans, pink-legged and finely-fleshed; next the G-ame fowl, dai-ker in the flesh and smaller in size, but excellently, and almost gamily, flavoured; then follow the Langshan, dark-legged, but heavily - fleshed, chiefly . on the breast; and, lastly, the Brahma, a long-legged creature, once very fashion- able, the best parts of which, however, are the thighs. These are given as table birds, and, indeed, there are more varieties, chiefly local, but these may be reckoned the best known and the most generally satisfactory. Having chosen the fowl, the next thing is to prepare it for table. First, in the country at all events, the bird must be plucked and singed. This may be considered an easy matter, but it is doubtful if the amateur who undertakes the task for the first time will quite see where the ease comes in ! The skin of birds, game especially, is decidedly tender, yet unless the feathers, and all the stumps, are carefully removed the bird will be unsightly; while if the skin is torn the appearance will be about equally spoilt. For this reason, where the skin is unusually tender (as it is with long-hung game), many cooks leave the breast feathers on till the bird has been trussed.

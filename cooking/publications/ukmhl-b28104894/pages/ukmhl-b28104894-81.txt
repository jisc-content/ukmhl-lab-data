MUTTON 71 and a little salt, and lay it in a pot that will just hold it comfortably, with three moderate onions, one stuck with a clove or two ; close the pan down very closely, aud let it all cook at the side of the stove very slowly for two to two and a half hours till the meat is perfectly tender, and the gravy is rich. Another way of doing the knuckle is to season it well, and inclose it in suet crust like a pudding, adding a sliced onion or two, and one or two kidneys to it if liked, and then boiling or steaming it precisely as if it were a meat pudding. The steak is perhaps nicest if grilled or broiled, though it may be stewed or braised if preferred. If broiled, serve it w7ith either a pat of any savoury butter under and upon it, or with brown oyster or shrimp sauce, and a garnish of broiled mushrooms, baked tomatoes, or fried potato straws or ribbons, as you please. Where two steaks are available, one steak is seasoned with salt and cayenne pepper with a very little grated lemon peel, a rich oyster force- meat (or any rich forcemeat to taste) is spread about an inch thick, the other steak, previously seasoned, is next laid on the first, sandwich fashion ; t hey are then brushed over with oiled butter or salad oil, and broiled or toasted in a Dutch oven for about thirty minutes or so, according to their thickness. Serve with good gravy, to which you have added the oyster liquor, a drop or t.wro of essence of anchovy, a tiny squeeze of lemon juice, and salt and pepper to taste.

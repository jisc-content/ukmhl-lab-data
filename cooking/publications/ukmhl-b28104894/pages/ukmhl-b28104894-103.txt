93 LAMB. divided lengthwise down the spine, each half being then again divided in two, leaving two haunches, i.e., the hind leg and loin cut in one; and two fore-quarters, this latter comprising the neck end of the animal, including the neck (scrag and best end), the shoulder, and breast. These four joints are each cooked whole as long as the lamb is small, but later, when it has increased in size (or in cases where the family is not large), it is cut up pretty much like a sheep. It must be remembered that lamb, like all young meat, requires thorough cooking to be wholesome. Fore-quarter of Lamb to Roast.—Wrap the joint in the caul or filmy substance any good butcher always sends with lamb for roasting, and cook it at a clear, sharp fire, basting it generously all the time it is cooking (this is a point that needs special attention if the joint is necessarily baked in the oven); roast it quickly, but be careful the fat does not catch, from the close proximity of the fire if roasted at an open fire, or from an over-sharp oven if baked ; ^mb’s fat is peculiarly liable to catch or burn. When cooked and nicely browned it is often considered a good plan to lift off the shoulder with a sharp knife, so as to separate it from the ribs ; a little pat of maitre d’hotel butter, or a little butter rubbed up with cayenne and lemon juice, is by many persons then inserted between the shoulder, or target as it is sometimes called, and the ribs, and allowed to melt there. It is a matter of taste whether this jointing and flavouring be performed after or before it is placed on the table. Whichever

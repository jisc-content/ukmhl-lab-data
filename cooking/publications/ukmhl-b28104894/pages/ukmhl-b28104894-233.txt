Stewed Foivl in Aspic.—Truss a large fowl as for boiling (it need not be so very young), and stew it very gently for an hour or so with a few soup vegetables, a bunch of parsley, some young green onions, and a slice or two of lean smoked ham, with seasoning to taste. When quite cooked, lift it out into an earthenware pan, pour the liquor in which it was cooked over it,' and leave it thus till cold. Prepare some white chaufroix sauce thus: Boil together a gill of veloute sauce (i.e., melted butter made with white stock instead of water), a gill of single cream or new milk, and a gill of aspic till it is reduced a fourth part, skimming it carefully. When this is cooling lift the fowl out of the liquor, wipe away any vegetable or fat that may be adhering to it, and then mask it all over with the chaufroix sauce just as the latter is setting, and put it aside till firm. Boar's Head.—Take the head of a bacon pig, cut it low in the shoulders, singe it, and then proceed to bone it, beginning at the throat; the tusks must not be removed, but scraped. Take out the tongue and pickle it in the same way as the head. For the pickle take 31b. or 41b. of common salt, and jib. of salt- petre, pound them well together, and rub them well into the head all over, especially over the eyes and ears, turn it over in the brine each day for a fort- night, then drain and dry it with a cloth. Have ready 31b, or 41b. of forcemeat (as for a galantine), a bottle of truffles, jib. of pistachio nuts previously

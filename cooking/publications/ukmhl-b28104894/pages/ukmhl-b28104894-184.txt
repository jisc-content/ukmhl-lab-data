meats. 174 dish, each quail on a crouton of fried bread, garni si with watercress salad, and send fried breadcrumbs and a nice clear gravy to table separately, if liked. In the Levant, &c., where quail are plentiful, they are used in as many different ways as partridges, fresh bay leaves being often preferred to vine leaves for the barding. In France, in the autumn, when the vineyards are ready for the vintage, the grive, or thrush, is often eaten like a quail, roasted as above. At that season they are especially fat, from feeding on the grapes. They are also made into pies, &c. Ortolans, or beccaficos, are treated exactly like quail, barded with either a vine or bayleaf, and roasted for eight to ten minutes ; they must be basted incessantly whilst cooking with butter. Larks are treated just like quail or ortolans, the trail being left, or not, as liked; wrap each little bird in a slice of slitted bacon and thread them, half a dozen at a time, on a thin skewer and roast for eight or ten minutes, basting well aâ€™lthe time. Like all other small birds, larks should have small pieces of buttered toast placed under them whilst roasting, to catch the drip of the gravy, &c., when the birds are basted. To serve, slip them off the skewer, place each bird on a piece of toast, and dish with a pile of fried breadcrumbs in the centre, and a garnish of watercress. Wheatears, like ortolans, &c., should be cooked as soon as possible, exactly like larks, either bread sauce or melted butter flavoured with lemon juice being handed with them, also a garnish of watercress.

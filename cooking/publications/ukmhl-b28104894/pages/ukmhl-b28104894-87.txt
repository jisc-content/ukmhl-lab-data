Mutton. Shoulder of Mutton Broiled.—Lard a shoulder of mutton neatly with good streaky bacon, and braise it with the same addenda as a leg till all but cooked ; now strew it thickly with seasoned breadcrumbs, to which you have added a little Parmesan cheese and some finely minced sweet herbs, and broil it over a clear fire, moistening it now and again with a little of the braising liquor. with Queen Mary’s Sauce.—Three parts roast a nice, well-hung shoulder of mutton, then put into the roasting tin under it a soup plate with three tablespoonfuls each of hot water and port wine, a shallot and an anchovy, both finely minced, and a little pepper; finish roasting the mutton, keep- ing it well basted with the contents of the soup plate. When cooked, turn up the inner side of the joint, score it across and across with a sharp knife, and strew it thickly with fried breadcrumbs, pouring the rest of the gravy over it. Cooked in this way shoulder of mutton is very good, served with well made Yorkshire pudding; or it can be plainly roasted with the pudding under it, and then be sent to table with a good horseradish cream in a sauce-boat. Or the remains (especially if it was originally under- done) make a very nice broil thus : Score the meat with a sharp knife right down to the bone, then season highly with cayenne, French or English, made mustard, and a very little grated lemon peel ; dip it in oil or warm batter, then roll it in, or strew it thickly with breadcrumbs, broil over a clear fire, and send to table very hot, either with or without a hot grill sauce.

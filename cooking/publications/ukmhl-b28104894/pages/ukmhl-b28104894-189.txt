A wild goose thus prepared takes about three hours, should be frothed up at the last with butter and flour, and be served with braised onions, and Poivrade sauce.

An elderly wild goose is excellent braised, stewed, or en daube, and either old or young, if roast d, goes well with celery or mushroom sauce. One hint may here be given with regard to “ mock ” game. If, by any chance, you are short of game for a salmi, &c, take a nice young fowl trussed for roasting, and roast it with the game bird you are about to use, placing it in such a manner that the basting from the game bird falls on the fowl and so flavours it. Then, when half or three-parts roasted, cut up the fowl into neat pieces and leave these to steep till wanted, in strong game stock ; it can then, when wanted, be lifted out and finished off with the other bird, and few persons will detect the difference.

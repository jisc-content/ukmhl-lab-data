Now prepare a forcemeat by mincing pretty finely a good piece of bacon (if this chance to be too lean add to it a little of the superfluous mutton fat), with onion, sweet herbs, and, if liked, a little garlic (remember that if vou wish to obtain the flavour without the strength of garlic you should peel, but never cut, the clove, or the juice exuding will flavour everything hopelessly) ; when this is thoroughly blended put it into a saucepan in a smooth layer, and on it place the roll of meat, turning it till it is nicely browned all over. Now season it with pepper and salt to taste, and add to it some tomato puree diluted with water or stock till of the consistency of thin pea soup; just bring it to the boil, then allow it to simmer very slowlv for three or four hours according to the size and thickness of the meat.

So where economy has to be considered, remove the undercut, which can be served up in various ways as filets de bceuf with various garnishes ; treat the actual sirloin as above, or roll and roast it, after removing and “rendering down” as much of the suet as you cannot get the butcher to remove; whilst the fag end can be used up for various household entrees ; for instance, it may be gently stewed with herbs, vegetables, and spice like the sirloin, and served with carefully and separately cooked cabbage, or a puree of lettuce, &c.; or it may be finely minced (raw), mixed with a little fat bacon or ham, and used as stuffing for a vegetable marrow, cucumber, &c., or it will make excellent Irish or Welsh stew (given later).

231 SUPPER DISHES. Veal Cake —Slice down four hard boiled eggs, and garnish with some of the slices a well-buttered basin or mould, then pack it with alternate layers of veal, ham, and hard boiled egg, seasoning these well with minced parsley, pepper, and salt; when full, pour in a little good, well-seasoned stock, and allow it all to bake steadily for four hours. Let it stand till perfectly cold, then turn it out and serve garnished with chopped aspic and parsley. Fowls, pheasants, &c., can all be used thus, but in their case a little best leaf gelatine must be added to the gravy when strained off, and boiled down with it, to ensure the gelatine being thoroughly dissolved and blended with the stock. Moreover, any cold cooked meat or game can be used up in this way : Dissolve l|oz. to 2oz. of best leaf gelatine in a quart of good clear stock (the stock must be flavoured to suit the meat used) ; cut any remains of cold cooked game into neat little fillets, also some cooked tongue and ham, then pack a mould or basin with the game, ham, tongue, some stoned olives, sliced truffles, sliced hard boiled or plover’s eggs, cubes of pate de foie gras, &c., according to what you have, and now pour in enough of the stiffened stock to cover the contents of the mould, and put it aside till set. Any scraps, however small, can be used up thus, and if set in tiny timbale moulds make an extremely pretty decoration for a mayonnaise.

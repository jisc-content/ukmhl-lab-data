Neglect of this precaution leads to no end of trouble to the carver, and probably also to the destruction of the tablecloth, for it is well nigh impossible to divide the joint thus after it is dished without splashing the gravy pretty considerably ; even granting the carver possess both the requisite skill and strength for the dissection.

156 MEATS. bard with a generous slice of fat bacon, covering this again with a well-buttered sheet of paper, and roast as usual, only being especially careful as to the frequency and liberality of the basting all the time of cooking. A bird thus stuffed requires, properly speaking, no sauce beyond its own gravy, as it is too rich and highly flavoured of itself to need outside flavours. Poulet a la Montmorency (or fowl fricandeau).— Pluck, singe, and bone a nice fowl, and have ready a stuffing made of a small sweetbread cut into dice, a small tin of pate de foie gras, some sliced truffles or mushrooms, about half as much rasped bacon as you have foie gras, a shallot or two, or some chives, and parsley, all finely minced, freshly ground black pepper, a little salt, and one or more egg yolks to bind it nicely. Stuff the fowl with this forcemeat, sew it up, and fry a few minutes in butter to brown it lightly, then lard it neatly like a fricandeau, and finish it off in the same way. If to be served hot, reduce some of its own liquor to a glaze, paint this thickly over the bird and set it in the oven for a few minutes to crisp, and serve alone, or with any sauce to taste. If to be used cold, turn it into a basin with all its gravy and addenda, and leave till perfectly cold, when the fat is wiped off and the whole is painted over with dark coloured aspic; or its own liquor is reduced, mixed with leaf gelatine (foz. to a pint of liquid), and cleared with an egg white and shell, and used as glaze. Chopped aspic is used with this as a garnish. Poulet a la Dreux.—Truss the fowl as for roasting,

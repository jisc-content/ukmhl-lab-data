When perfectly and absolutely cold, lift it out, trim it neatly, and cover the top with just liquid glaze, or, if preferred, dark aspic jelly ; leave this till set, and then serve cold for dinner or lunch, garnished with parsley. The great secret lies in not touching it till perfectly cold right through. Brisket of beef may be cooked thus, plain, or slightly pickled ; but in the latter case remember the pickle should be a sweet one. The nicest pickle for this is the follow- ing : Mix together (dry) -|lb. bay salt, 4oz. common salt, 6oz. moist sugar or treacle, foz. salt- petre, and |oz. of freshly-ground black pepper, warm it all well near the fire, then rub the piece of meat with it for ten or fifteen minutes; now pour the rest of the salt, &c., over it, and leave it in the salt for a few days, more or less, according to the degree of salting required (for a small piece, r*ay 51b. or 61b., three to four days will be ample), well rubbing and turning it daily. The meat to be salted should be perfectly fresh, and in good condition. The following pickle involves less trouble and also produces excellent results : Boil together for twenty minutes, skimming carefully, a gallon of water, l~Vo. of bay salt, lib. of coarse, dark brown sugar, loz. of bruised black peppercorns, and l|oz. saltpetre; when sufficiently boiled let it stand till cold, and then put in the meat. This pickle, known as Hamburg pickle, is excellent for tongues, and all sorts of pieces of meat intended for stewing and eating cold.

MEATS. 230 simmer gently for three or four hours ; now remove the veal, cut the meat up into neat pieces, and lay it in another pan, straining the liquor from the first cooking over it, and allow it to simmer again for half an hour or so. Slice three or four hard boiled eggs, and arrange some of the slices at the bottom of a plain mould, then put in a layer of the veal (when cooled), then more egg, then a layer of small pieces of tongue or ham, and repeat these layers till the mould is full, when it should be put in a cool place to set. Turn it out by dipping the mould in some warm water, and running the blade of a knife round between the jelly and the mould, and serve garnished with watercress. Chicken or game make a somewhat similar dish prepared in this way: Cover the bird with boiling water, let the latter reboil, then skim well, draw the pan to the side of the stove, and let its contents simmer very gently till the fowl is tender, when it must be lifted from the liquor and both left till nearly cold. Now remove all fat from the liquor, put the latter in a saucepan with a clove, a sliced onion, a bouquet, and a small sliced carrot, and |oz. of gela- tine, and simmer it all for ten or fifteen minutes ; now season to taste with salt and pepper, sti a n, and when cool pour some into a mould, leaving this till nearly set. Now shred the flesh of the fowl free from skin and bone, and pack it into the mould with strips of ham or tongue, hard boiled egg, and French gherkins, with alternate layers of the jelly, finishing with the latter, and leaving it in a cool place to set. Then turn out and serve, garnished with salad.

153 POULTRY. the process, as quickly as possible: now put it on a hot dish, remove any fat, and keep it hot. Pour a couple of spoonfuls more of stock into the stewpan, and leave it on the fire for a minute or so, shaking it gently to detach all the gravy adhering to the pan, then strain it over the bird and serve very hot. For this the fowl must be young. Poulet a la Peau de Goret.—Roast the fowl as usual, being careful about the basting. When nearly cooked, run a piece of fat bacon, wrapped in paper, on a skewer, set light to the paper, which, as it burns, will melt the bacon fat, and the drip of this on to the fowls will brown the skin and raise blisters such as one sees on roast sucking pig. Serve very hot with a watercress salad, and either tiny sausages or rolls of fried bacon. Poulets d la Chivvy.—Truss and braise the fowls, using ham instead of bacon, and very rich stock, with, if at hand, truffle trimmings; braise these very gently, and when cooked, dish on a hot dish and serve with a ravigotte sauce. For this take a couple of ounces of rich white roux, and moisten it with about half a pint each of poultry stock and light white wine (not sherry), let it all reduce till smooth and thick, then add a seasoning of lemon juice, salt, and white pepper, with either an ounce or two of Ravigotte butter, or parsley, chervil, chives (or shallot), tarragon, and watercress, in equal proportions (previously blanched for two or three minutes in boiling water, then dried by wringing them in a clean cloth), finely minced, stir it all over the fire till hot, but without boiling, and use.

201 PUDDINGS AND PIES. Chicken and Parsley Pie.—Cut up, wash, and dry a chicken, season it with fine salt; pick and scald some parsley, then squeeze it quite dry, mince it, and lay it in a pie dish; on this lay some of the chicken, then more parsley and chicken till the dish is full. Pour in new milk almost to the top of the dish, cover it with a nice paste, and bake. 'When > ooked, pour off some of the milk, and replace it with half a pint of scalded cream. Puck Pie.—This is an old-fashioned pie, but not by any means a bad one for all that. Carefully scald and cleanse two nice birds and cut them into neat pieces, putting aside the livers and the giblets separately, making the latter into good stock in the usual way with vegetables and seasoning, using bone stock instead of water to cover them. Well wash and par-fry the livers, packing them into the dish with the cut-up duck, and about 4oz. to 5oz. of ham cut into strips; pour to this some of the stock made from the duck bones, previously strained, freed from fat, and flavoured to taste with a little port wine and orange juice (Seville orange being best for this), cover the pie and bake in a moderate oven. When cooked, add in the rest of the gravy flavoured as before. Partridcje Pie.—Pick, draw, and singe three nice partridges, cutting the birds into neat joints and removing the feet, the heads, and the tips of the wings. Cover the bottom of the pie dish first with a thin layer of fat bacon, then a layer of beef or rump steak, cut up and seasoned as for the giblet pie, and on this arrange the partridge joints pretty closely,

To roast a joint of mutton, melt some dripping carefully in the dripping pan, and as soon as the meat is put down baste it plentifully with this; let it cook sharply rather close to the tire, then draw it a little further off and let it cook more slowly and solidly, to ensure the thorough cooking of the thick part. Baste often; this cannot be done too frequently. If flour is used to froth up the meat, as advised in some cookery books, mind it is dredged on sufficiently long before the joint is done to ensure the flour being thoroughly cooked, for the raw, harsh taste of uncooked flour found with carelessly cooked meat, is most nauseous.

20S PUDDINGS AND PIES. run over it all a little aspic jelly, replace the cover, and leave it till the jelly is set. For the farce, nr nee roughly 8oz. of livers (game, poultry or calf’s), 4oz. fat bacon, 4oz. lean white meat of any sort, and half a small onion ; put it all into a pan with two bay leaves, loz. of butter, a little parsley and thyme, pepper and salt, and fry it for five minutes or so ; then, whilst still hot, pound it, rub it through a sieve, mix it with the yolk of an egg, and two or three chopped truffles or mushrooms if handy, and use. This will be enough for an average sized pie. Very nice pies may be very easily made with all sorts of things; for instance, pigeons, plover, partridges, rabbits, &c., may all be used, the flesh being removed from the breasts, &c., and cut into neat fillets, the rest of the carcase being used up in the farce, and then the pie is packed with alternate layers of farce, fillets, slices of tongue, ham, or even delicate sausages, hard-boiled egg, cubes of pate de foie gras, &c., according to what is at hand. Snipe Pie.—Treat three or four snipe as described for the partridge pie, removing the legs, heads and wing tips ; quarter the birds, removing the gizzards, but leaving the trail. Now line a dish with thin slices of fat ham, place the birds closely on these, season well with parsley, thyme, a very little powdered bay leaf, pepper and salt, together with the juice of a small lemon; next pour in enough oiled and clarified butter to cover the birds, lay more sliced fat ham over this, and cover with puff paste, finish off as described for partridge pie, and keep it in a cool place till wanted.

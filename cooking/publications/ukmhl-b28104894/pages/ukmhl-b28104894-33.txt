23 BEEF. cooking, some cooks asserting that it should be done every ten minutes or so, whilst others say that for a medium-sized joint five or six times is the least number of times it should be so treated. It is cer- tain that on attention to this point the excellence of roast meat depends almost entirely. To ensure a proper amount of basting material some cooks place either a piece of suet or dripping, or a little good gravy or stock, in the dripping-pan when they put down the meat; whilst others, again, rub the joint well over with clarified dripping, and fasten a paper liberally coated with dripping or butter over the joint at the beginning, removing this about twenty to thirty minutes before the joint is cooked to allow of its browning nicely. Personally, the last method appears to me the safest, especially in these days when few can afford the services of a culinary artist. When meat is baked, it takes about the same time as for roasting, but it requires (and only too seldom gets) also equal attention in the matter of basting. In baking, the plan of wrapping the joint in paper rubbed with fat is especially to be insisted on. Where the joint is lean, it is well to melt a little of its own fat, i.e., using beef fat for beef, mutton fat for mutton, &c., and place it in the dripping-pan in readiness to baste it at once. The same rule applies to baked as to roast meat, i.e., the oven should be hotter at first, to crisp the surface, and then allowed to slacken a little to finish the cooking, for the slower the meat is cooked after the initial ten minutes the better and juicier it will

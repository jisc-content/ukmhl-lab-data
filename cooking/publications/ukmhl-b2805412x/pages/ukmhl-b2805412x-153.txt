A peppercorn or two, a sprig of thyme and parsley, may be used for most brown gravies. Let the gravy boil slowly until rich enough, then strain, and when cool remove the fat; let it boil up, season if necessary, and thicken with a teaspoonful of boiled flour mixed smooth in cold water to about half a pint of gravy. Butter Sauce. The following is the best and most expeditious method of making butter sauce, or, as it is often called with us, ‘ melted butter.’ Less butter is required than when mixed in any other manner, as the flavour of it is not lost by boiling. One ounce of flour mixed smooth in four tablespoon- fuls of cold water. Stir it into half a pint of fast boiling water, add a pinch of salt, let it boil up, then stir in an ounce and a half of butter ; when it is dissolved, serve the sauce. Parsley Sauce. To be made as butter sauce. The parsley to be chopped and thrown into the boiling water just before mixing with the flour. K

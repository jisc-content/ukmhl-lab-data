Pillet Steaks with Potato Chips. Trim the fillet as for roasting, cut it into slices hall an inch thick, pepper and salt lightly, and allow them to stand for an hour or two. Put a little butter into the frying-pan, fry the fillets, first on one side, then on the other, dish them up nicely in the centre of a dish, and put round potato chips prepared as follows :â€”Peel fine kidney potatoes, cut them in very thin round slices of an equal size (that which is not used for the chips can be either fried or boiled for the family dinner), lay them in a cloth to dry, and fry in the wire basket in good fat. Dripping will answer, but the best frying fat is clarified pot skimmings ; next to this beef-suet melted down with an equal quantity of lard. Oil is the best of all for frying potatoes, but is expensive, and requires some care in the use. Put only enough chips to cover the bottom of your basket; when you take them out, throw them on paper before the fire to absorb any grease, and repeat the process until you have enough chips. They can, if pre- ferred, be fried without the basket, and taken out of the fat with a skimmer.

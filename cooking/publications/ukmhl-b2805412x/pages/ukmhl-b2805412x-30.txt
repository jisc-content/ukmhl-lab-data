LITTLE DINNERS. 6 again boiling or stewing fish, which thus gains instead of losing its fine qualities, as it does to a great extent when boiled in plain water. Warmed every day and put into clean vessels fish liquor will keep for a considerable time, even in hot weather. The bones of fish are useful for making stock for many purposes, and especially for that last mentioned. Soles are deprived of much of their flavour and are rendered dry by skinning; they should always be scraped. Much fish is wasted for want of the simple precaution of rubbing it over with a little vinegar ; it may thus be kept good for days, and by properly wiping can be used for frying. All white fish is improved by this treatment, a very little salt being added if for use the same day. We will but glance in this place at the great and universal waste of meat, the better plan being to show, as in the following recipes, how to economise in its use. As has before been said, the great object we have in view is to popularise other forms of diet than that which is com- prised in the term 6 plain roast and boiled.â€™ In the former the waste is frequently enormous, especially in cases where the cook over-roasts the joints for the sake of securing to herself the perquisite of dripping, a perquisite, by the way, which no good housekeeper will concede.

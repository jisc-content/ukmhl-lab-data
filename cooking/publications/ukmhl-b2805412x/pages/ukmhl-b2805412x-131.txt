lu/ NOVEMBER. Creme du The. Put half an ounce of fine orange-davoured Pekoe tea into an earthenware tea-pot, and pour on it a pint of boiling milk. Let it stand until nearly cold, when pour it off fine, and, if necessary, strain it to free it from every particle of leaf. Put the liquor into a bright stewpan, with enough lump-sugar to make it sweet; when it is hot, add to it a quarter of a pint of rich cream, and the yolks of five eggs. Stir over a slow fire until it becomes a thick custard. Stir occasionally until cold, when put it into a deep glass dish, and serve with a silver or glass ladle. Savoy finger biscuits should be handed round with it.

LITTLE DINNERS. z6 Roasted Artichokes. Take a dozen large Jerusalem artichokes, wash, brush, and peel in the usual manner; then trim into the shape of eggs, all as nearly of a size as possible. Put into a tin baking-dish two ounces of butter, lard, or dripping, with a little pepper and salt; when the fat is melted, put in the artichokes and roast them for half an hour, either in a Dutch oven before the fire, or in the oven. They should be basted frequently and cooked rather quickly, and when done they will be a rich brown. If more convenient the artichokes may be fried. The trimmings should not be wasted, but be used for making soup or 'puree. Stewed Pheasant. Prepare the bird as for roasting; stuff the crop with forcemeat, and flour the skin. Put two ounces of butter into a stewpan, then carefully fry the pheasant until nicely browned. This done, place round it half-a-dozen small onions cut in quarters, and a cupful of very strong, highly-seasoned gravy; cover the pan closely, then let it simmer very slowly for three-quarters of an hour, or until the bird is tender. Take it up and keep hot whilst you prepare the gravy ; strain it and take off every particle of fat, thicken it with a little butter rolled in flour, let it boil up and serve round the pheasant.

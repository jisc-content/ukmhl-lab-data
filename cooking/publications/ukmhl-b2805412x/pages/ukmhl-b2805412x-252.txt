LITTLE DINNERS. 228 pudding to stew some of the same kind of fruit separately in a pie-dish; in the oven is best.

Serve with thick milk made as follows :â€” Beat up the yolk of an egg, pour on it boiling hot a quarter of a pint of new milk; sweeten to taste, and let it be perfectly thick and cold before serving. If necessary, set it in cold water ; or if the weather is hot, afford a morsel of ice. Second Day Pudding. Chop the remains of a fruit pudding quite fine, add to it a quarter of' its weight in flour, suet, sugar, and black currant or other preserve, or stewed fruit; mis all with an egg; butter a pie-dish, cover over with a tin plate, set it to bake slowly for nearly two hours, so that it sets, but does not brown; then turn it out, sift sugar thickly over, and serve.

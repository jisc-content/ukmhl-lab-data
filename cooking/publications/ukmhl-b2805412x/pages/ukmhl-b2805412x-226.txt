202 LITTLE DINNERS. Savoury Macaroni Pudding. Prepare macaroni as above, and finish as savoury rice pudding. Macaroni with Cheese. Boil two ounces of macaroni in half a pint of water, with an ounce of butter, until perfectly tender. If the water evaporates add a little more, taking care that the macaroni does not stick to the stewpan or become broken. When it is done, drain away the water, and stir in two ounces of good cheese grated, cayenne pepper, and salt to taste. Keep stirring until the cheese is dissolved ; pour on to a hot dish and serve. A little butter may be stirred into the macaroni before the cheese, and is an improve- ment. Savoury Eice Pudding. Boil a teacupful of rice in a pint of good stock with an onion. Make a custard with half a pint of milk and one egg, season with pepper and salt, a little chopped parsley, and a shalot minced fine. Mix with the rice and bake in a slow oven.

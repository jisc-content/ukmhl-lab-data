When the liver is tender, break it up and rub it through a fine sieve, or pound it in a mortar, strain the gravy on to it, and when it has boiled up together add a glass of port wine and currant-jelly to taste, with sufficient cayenne to make it rather hot.

It will serve for making stuffing, as an addition to rissoles, or will be very good eaten cold. Sultana Pudding. Butter a pint mould or basin. Lay on it thickly fine Sultana raisins, which have been carefully wiped and picked, then fill up the basin lightly with the crumb of a French roll cut in rounds, shred an ounce of suet finely, and strew over each round. Fill up the mould with a custard made of two eggs and half a pint of milk (see * remarks on Pudding Making â€™), flavoured with a little ground cinnamon and lemon extract. A little finely shred lemon candy peel is an improvement to the pudding, it should be placed at the bottom of the basin.

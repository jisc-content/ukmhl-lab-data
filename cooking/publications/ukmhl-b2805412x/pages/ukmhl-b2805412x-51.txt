27 JANUARY. Lemon Omelets. These are not omelets proper, but an imitation of them. They have the advantage of being more easily prepared by an ordinary cook, and of being less rich than real omelets. Beat up the yolks of four eggs, mix a teaspoonful of flour and dessertspoonful of Brown and Poisonâ€™s corn-flour in two tablespoonfuls of cold milk or cream, and stir into the eggs. Pour on this half a pint of boiling milk, and, when ready for the oven, stir in the whites of the eggs beaten to a strong froth. Take four common pudding- plates, or, if you have them, tin dishes that will hold about the same quantity, and melt on each j ust sufficient butter to cover them, divide the omelet mixture pretty equally, and bake in a quick oven until well set. They should be done in ten minutes. Turn the omelet on to a hot dish, and spread over half of it about a teaspoonful of lemon paste, or, if that is not convenient, any nice preserve, fold over and sift a little sugar, serving it as quickly as possible. The omelets may be flavoured with any essence, and are very good without the addition of preserve or lemon paste. Lemon Paste. Half a pound of finely powdered sugar, two ounces of butter, three eggs, two lemons.

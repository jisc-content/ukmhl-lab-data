LITTLE DINNERS. 74 Orange Pudding. A quarter of a pound of bread-crumbs, a quarter of a pound of suet, two ounces of flour, quarter of a pound of sifted loaf-sugar, a quarter of a pound of orange marma- lade. Mix with one egg, and put the pudding into a buttered basin or mould. Steam for three hours. For sauce, boil a dessertspoonful of marmalade in a quarter of a pint of water for ten minutes, strain it, make it boiling hot, and stir into it a teaspoonful of corn-flour and one of flour mixed smooth in a tablespoonful of cold water. Sweeten with about an ounce of lump-sugar, and add a pinch of citric acid. Let it simmer until thickened, then stir in half an ounce of butter, and pour round the base of the pudding the moment before serving. Snow. Make a custard as for strawberry souffle. When cold, put it in a glass dish, and lay the snow on it as you make it. Beat the whites of the eggs to a very strong froth with a tablespoonful of sifted sugar. Have in a frying-pan half a pint of milk and water, and put on it a table- spoonful of the froth at a time. Let it simmer until set, then take up with a fish-slice and pile up on the custard. It should present a very pretty rocky appearance, and look like real snow. If you choose a few preserved cherries may be used for ornament

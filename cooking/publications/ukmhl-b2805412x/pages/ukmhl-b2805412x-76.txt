5- LITTLE DINNERS. page 27). Make a liquid custard of half a pint of new milk and two eggs, sweeten, and grate a little lemon peel into it, fill up the basin with it, and place a layer of roll on the top, cover with a paper cap, and set it in a stewpan with sufi^ient boiling water to reach half- way up the basin. Let 't stand closely covered at a heat just below boiling poin or an hour. The excellence of the pudding depends very much on the care with which this direction is observed. If the pudding be allowed to boil, the custard will mix with the bread and it will be tough, if, on the contrary, the water be not kept just below boiling point, the custard will not set and the pudding will be watery. If preferred, sponge finger biscuits, two ounces, may be substituted for bread, but when they are used only one egg is required for the custard. When the pudding is turned out of the mould, pour the following sauce round the base:â€”A teaspoonful of corn- flour, one of flour ; mix with a tablespoonful of cold water. Dissolve about six lumps of sugar in a quarter of a pint of boiling water, and pour over the flour. Let it just boil, then stir in a small pat of butter, a few drops of lemon flavouring, and the juice of half a lemon. If lemons are scarce a pinch of citric acid may be substituted.

LITTLE DINNERS. i So any kind of pounded meat, game, poultry, or fish, well and highly seasoned, and in the case of the latter, a-little anchovy added. Mix all together and set aside to get as cold as possible. When ready for use, flour your hands, and roll the quenelles into the shape of small eggs, if for an entree, if for soup, the size of a teaspoon. Have a stewpan half filled with boiling broth, or water, flavoured with onions, pepper and salt, drop in the quenelles, and poach them. Eight or ten minutes will cook the largest size. They may be served either with a rich gravy or white sauce flavoured with lemon juice. Patties. These may be made in great variety, both in shape and material, but it requires an experienced hand to make patties without pans, and there is some waste with them. Those made as follows are excellent. Line small round patty-pans with puff paste, exactly the same as for mince- pies, fill them with either cooked veal, pork, mutton, fowl, or game, cut into neat dice, and mix so as to coat the meat thickly with rich, well flavoured white sauce; put on a cover of paste and bake in a quick oven.

Clear Gravy Soup. Take three pounds of beef from the neck (the butchers call it c stickingâ€™) and a slice of lean ham. Cut them into dice, put with a bit of butter into a stock-pot, cover close, and allow it to stand at a moderate heat to draw out the juices, being careful that it does not burn, as no after pains can repair this misfortune. When the juices are extracted (if the meat is good and fresh there will be more than half a pint) increase the heat, so as to allow the watery portions to evaporate. When you hear a frying sound, and find the moisture drying up and the meat covered with a thick rich coating, put in half a pint of water and again allow reduction. Then put in two quarts of cold water, let it boil, skim it, and allow it to boil gently, with the lid slightly raised, for three horns. Put into a separate stewpan two turnips, a large carrot, and eight onions sliced and fried, two or three peppercorns and a saltspoonful of celery-seed tied in muslin ; boil the whole in a pint of water until tender. Strain off the liquor as clear as possible and add it to your soup half an hour before straining. Put a little pepper, but no salt

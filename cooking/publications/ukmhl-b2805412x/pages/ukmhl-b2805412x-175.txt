I5i MEAT DISHES. Beef Olives. Have some rump steak cut a quarter of an inch thick, divide it into pieces about five inches wide, spread over each a thin layer of sausage meat, roll up tightly, and put a skewer through to keep in shape; egg, bread-crumb, and fry until lightly cooked. Serve with good gravy in the dish. Rump Steak Pudding. Line a pudding-basin with a paste made of equal pro- portions of beef-suet and flour, with water in proportion of half a pint to a pound of the latter. Lay in pieces of rump steak nicely trimmed, and sprinkle over pepper and salt, then a layer of mushrooms skinned ; repeat the layer of steak, and so on till the basin is full. Pour in as much stock or water as the basin will conveniently hold, put on a lid of paste, and boil from two hours to two hours and a half, according to size. When the pudding is done, send it to table in its basin, with a napkin neatly fastened round. Two or three sheepâ€™s kidneys cut in quarters may be substituted for the mushrooms; oysters are excellent. The carver should remove a round piece of the top crust and pour in a little gravy, which should be made of the mushroom trimmings and a little meat.

Mutton Soup. Get a perfectly fresh sheepâ€™s head, dressed with the skin on, soak it in tepid water, take out the tongue and brains, break all the thin bones inside the cheek, and carefully wash it in several waters. Put it on in a quart of water with a teaspoonful of salt, and let it boil ten minutes. Pour away this water, and put two quarts more with one pound of scrag of mutton, cut up six onions, two turnips, two carrots, a sprig of parsley, and season with pepper and salt. Let it boil gently for four or five hours, when the head and neck will not be too much cooked foi the family dinner, and may be served tossed up either in parsley or onion sauce. Strain the soup, let it cool so as to remove every particle of fat. Eub the vegetables through a sieve to a fine puree, mix a tablespoonful of corn-flour in a quarter of a pint of milk, make the soup boil up and stir it in with the vegetables. Have the tongue boiled until very tender, skin and trim it, have the brains also well cooked and chop or pound them very fine with the tongue, mix them with an equal weight of sifted bread-crumbs, a tablespoonful of chopped green parsley, pepper, salt, egg, and if necessary a small quantity

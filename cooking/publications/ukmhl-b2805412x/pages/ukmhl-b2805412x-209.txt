POULTRY AND GAME. 1S5 joram and thyme, and an onion with two cloves stuck in it. Let the stewpan boil for one minute, then skim the gravy and allow it just to simmer for half an hour. Meanwhile boil three dozen button onions in a pint of milk with a little salt, strain them, and reserve the liquor to make the sauce. When done, take up the fowl, strain the gravy and take off all the fat, let it boil in the stewpan without the lid imtil reduced to one-half, add the onion milk made as thick as good cream with boiled flour, break in two ounces of fine fresh butter, taste that the sauce is well seasoned, and put in the fowl. Let it get hot in the sauce, and then stand at the stove corner for a quarter of an hour. Arrange the button onions neatly round the dish on which the fowl is served. Chicken Legs en Papillotes. Take the legs of cold chicken, remove the bones, dip them in dissolved butter, with a little chopped parsley, pepper, and salt mixed with it. Lay on both sides of each leg a very thin slice of cooked fat bacon, and wrap it in a piece of buttered paper, cut so that it will fold over neatly at the edges. Lay them on a gridiron over a slow file for ten minutes, turning them twice and being- very careful they do not burn.

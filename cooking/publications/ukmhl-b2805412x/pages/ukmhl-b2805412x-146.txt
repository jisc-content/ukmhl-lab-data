122 LITTLE DINNERS. Economy has been studied in all our recipes, but every housewife should know that there is a kind of soup, cheap and tasty, for which no recipe can he given. Bones and scraps, pot liquor, and the water in which onions, turnips, and carrots have been boiled, make excellent soup for family use, either with or without the addition of a little fresh meat. Vegetables used to flavour should be served with the soup, either minced or rubbed to a puree. A careful cook even in a small family should always he able, at an almost nominal cost, to serve relishing soups for everyday use. There can he no question that such soups, from every point of view, form an important ad- junct to a dinner. Gravy Soup. Cut two pounds of beef from the neck into dice and fry until brown. Break small two or three pounds of hones and lightly fry them. Bones from which streaked bacon has been cut make an excellent addition, hut too many must not he used lest the soup he salt. Slice and fry brown a pound of onions, put them with the meat and hones and three quarts of cold water into the soup pot, let it boil up, and having skimmed, add two large turnips, a carrot cut in slices, a small bundle of sweet herbs, and half a dozen peppercorns.

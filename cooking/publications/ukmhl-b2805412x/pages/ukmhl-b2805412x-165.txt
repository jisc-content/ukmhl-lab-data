141 FISH White Bait. These delicate and delicious little fish may be bought at all good fishmongers, and it is not the expense which prevents their appearance more frequently at private tables. A wire basket and plenty of good frying fat are indispensable, and with a little care white bait may be as easily cooked as any other fish. First drain the fish on a sieve, and then strew them on a cloth, well covered with flour; this done, lay another floured cloth over and turn them on to it. Having well covered the white hait with flour, drop a few at a time into the wire basket until the bottom is covered ; shake lightly to free them from unnecessary flour. Have ready some clear, clean frying fat, and when boiling hot dip the basket in. Move it about gently until the fish become crisp, as they will be in about two minutes. When done, turn the white bait on to paper to absorb the grease; keep hot whilst you repeat the process until you have enough. Pile the white bait high on a napkin neatly folded, and garnish with fried parsley. Serve with lemon and brown bread and butter. A little salt and cayenne pepper may, if approved, be sprinkled over the fish after it is fried.

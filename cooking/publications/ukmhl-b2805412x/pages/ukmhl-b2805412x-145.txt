Soup Making No culinary operation demands less skill than ordinary soup making, yet it is one too often negligently per- formed. By paying attention to a few simple funda- mental rules, good soup may be made from half the quantity of material required by a cook who will not observe them. Soup which is made by throwing the materials without due preparation into water, and allow- ing them to boil to rags, will generally taste flat, and the admixture of catchup, sauces, and colouring may disguise the evil, but will never make it tolerable to an educated palate. A well made soup requires no colouring, no flavouring beyond that of the meat and vegetables, with the usual seasoning of pepper and salt, unless it is intended to give it some special character, as by curry-powder, wine or acids. Frying the mea’t, vegetables, and bones (these should always be broken as small as possible), supplies at once colour and flavour. A weak soup thus made will be more acceptable than one far stronger, but which is ‘ doctored ’ to disguise the insipidity caused by the care- less manner of its preparation.

LITTLE DINNERS 2iS Put the butter into a clean bright stewpan, melt, hut ho not oil it, then stir in the sugar, and when it is thoroughly dissolved add the eggs, beaten and strained, then put in the grated peel of the lemons and the strained juice, stir all together until it becomes as thick as honey. This mixture, covered down like jam, will keep in a cool dry place for some months. Chestnut Cream. Take a dozen fine chestnuts, remove the husks, and put them to boil in a quarter of a pint of milk slightly sweet- ened with lump-sugar. When quite tender, drain away the milk, and mash up the chestnuts with an ounce of sifted sugar and a few drops of essence of vanilla. Kub the chestnuts through a coarse tin gravy-strainer, keeping the puree as light as possible in order that it may look like vermicelli. Kentâ€™s patent potato masher and bread grater is admirably adapted for making this pur6e. Whip a quarter of a pint of thick cream until it is very firm, and place it in the middle of a glass dish, then strew the chestnuts over it, keeping it in as good a shape and as high as you can. The moment before serving, pour round the base some syrup of cherries slightly flavoured with vanilla. Soak a few dried cherries in brandy for an hour, and place at equal distances round the cream. If cherry- syrup is not attainable, currant-jelly made into a syrup with a little water can be substituted.

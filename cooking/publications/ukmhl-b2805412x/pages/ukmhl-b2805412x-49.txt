25 JANUARY. is much sought for, and esteemed as the most tender and digestible morceau in the whole ox. English people con- demn it as tasteless ; if it is, it is the fault of the cook. Properly speaking, a fillet of beef includes the whole under-cut of the sirloin and rump; but as joints are cut with us, it is not possible to obtain it in one piece, therefore the under-cut of the rump alone must be bought, or the under-cut may be removed from a sirloin before roasting, without any prejudice to the upper side, and it can be treated in the same manner as the under-cut of the rump. From a fine rump of beef the fillet will weigh about four pounds; if charged as it usually is at steak price, it should have no skirt and little suet, and will be found an economi- cal dish. Get the meat the day before you require to cook it, rub in a dessertspoonful of vinegar, very lightly pepper and salt, and hang in a cool place until wanted, then rub in a teaspoonful of the finest salad oil—huile d’Aix is best—and roast it slowly. It should be rather underdone. Have ready a nice rich brown gravy, the thickness of cream, and baste the fillet with it before the fire ten minutes before serving. Put it on a dish with the fat side uppermost—the carver will cut slices fillet- wise. Roasted artichokes may either be served in the gravy as a garnish to the fillet, or separately. If the cook understands larding it is a great improve- ment, or, as a substitute, a thick slice of fat bacon fastened over the under-side of the fillet during roasting will be found good.

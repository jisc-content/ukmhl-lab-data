152 LITTLE DINNERS. Beef or Mutton Puffs. Roll or pound cold potatoes perfectly smooth, add a quarter of their weight of flour, ruh them together, season with pepper and salt, mix into a paste with egg, roll out thinly, and cut into pieces about four inches square. Place on them slices of cold meat and well cooked bacon, very thinly sliced; pepper and salt highly, fold the paste over the meat, and press the edges together. Fry care- fully, first on one side, then on the other. Serve very hot. Cottage Pie. Cut into dice one pound and a half of any coarse lean part of beef (from the â€˜sticking piece' is best), and put it into a stewpan with an ounce of butter, a pinch of pepper and salt, and four minced onions. Let this simmer in its own juices until perfectly tender. If not allowed to cook too fast, there will be nearly half a pint of gravy from fine fresh meat. It will take nearly two hours to cook properly. When ready, put the meat and onions into a pie-dish, mix the gravy with sufficient plain butter sauce to fill the dish, and cover it with nicely mashed potatoes. Mark the cover in squares on the top, by crossing it with a knife; bake for twenty minutes. The potato crust

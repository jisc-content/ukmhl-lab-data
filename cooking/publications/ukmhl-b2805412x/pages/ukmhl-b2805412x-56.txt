LITTLE DINNERS. 32 strainer, have very finely chopped an ounce of beef-suet or cooked fat bacon, a pinch of dried parsley and sweet herbs, salt and pepper, mix with an egg and half a tea- spoonful of essence of anchovy. Make half a pint of thin melted butter, squeeze into it the juice of half a lemon, pepper and salt lightly, add a teaspoonful of essence of anchovy and pour into a tin baking-dish. Lay in the fish, hake in a moderate oven for about an hour, basting frequently and taking care it does not brown. Should the sauce reduce too much and get thick in the process of cooking, add a little water, a bit of butter and a few drops of anchovy. When the fish is done, remove it to a hot dish and strain the sauce over it. If the baking-dish is presentable, it is a good plan to serve the fish in it, as there is thus no loss of heat. Veal Cutlets. Get about two pounds of the best end of a neck of veal. Cut away the meat from the bones in one piece with a sharp knife, then divide it into neat cutlets about half an inch thick. Brush them over with the yolk of an egg, and then dip them in an equal quantity of finely sifted bread-crumbs and raspings highly seasoned with pepper and salt. Fry them quickly in a little butter, first on one side until a nice brown and then on the other.

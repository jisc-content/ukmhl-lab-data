124 LITTLE DINNERS. Ox-tail Soup. Make the soup exactly as gravy soup, with the addition of an ox-tail. Divide it into joints and fry brown. Then boil until perfectly tender, so that the meat comes easily off the bones, take it up and cut it into handsome pieces. When required for the soup, re-warm it in a little stock, as it would make the soup greasy if boiled up in it. When the soup is ready, put in two lumps of sugar, a glass of port wine, and pour immediately into the tureen. Ox-cheek Soup. This is an economical soup, and at the same time, if well made, very good. Have the bones of the cheek well broken, and wash it well in plenty of salt and water. Put it in the soup-pot and cover with water, let it boil ten minutes, then pour away this water. Fry six large onions, and put them into the soup-pot with two carrots and turnips, a little celery and blade of mace, six pepper- corns and cloves, and as much stock or water as will cover the cheek. Let it boil gently for four hours, by which time the cheek will be done. Eemove the meat from the bones, and choose some of the best pieces to serve in the soup. The remainder can be used for other dishes and is very good. Finish as gravy soup, with the addition, if you like, of a glass of sherry.

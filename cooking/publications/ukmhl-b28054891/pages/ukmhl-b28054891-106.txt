94 It is essential in making invalid soups that the meat used should be uncooked and very good. For beef tea use steak or shin of beef. Every piece of skin, membrane and flxt should be carefully removed from the meat to be used. Vegetables, spice and seasoning should not be used unless permitted by the doctor. When soup has to be made quickly a little time can be saved by removing the fat from it while it is still hot (see p. 3).

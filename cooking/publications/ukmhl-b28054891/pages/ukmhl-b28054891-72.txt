Wlicn passing vegetables or meat tlirongli a tammy or fine sieve, it will be easier if they are kept eontinnally moistened with a little of the stock or milk with which the pnree is to be made. Purees having been passed through the sieve or tammy, can, if not required at once, be set aside until wanted. But a puree that has reached this point must on no account be re- heated or have milk or cream added to it until just before it is to be served. When re-heating, if a meat puree, it should not be allowed to boil, or even be made hotter than is absolutely necessary. Allow all vegetable purees to boil up quickly for several minutes after the puree and stock have been mixed. This will clarify them. All scum should be carefully removed. ' When this is done, the butter and milk or cream can be added. A little white or brown roux well mixed with purees a minute or two before serving will pre- vent the actual puree from separating from the stock. GO

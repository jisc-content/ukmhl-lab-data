There is, of course, no end to sauces, and in a book of tliis size it is impossible to do justice to their variety. Enongli are, liowever, I hope, given in the pages that follow for ordinary needs. It is of the highest importance in making sauces that the materials used should be of the best. Fresh butter and the finest olive oil should be used. When adding the yolks of eggs to sauces it is best to do so in a hain marie (i.e. to stand the sauce-pan in which the sauce is being made, inside a larger one full of boiling water), as they must never be allowed to boil, and a quick fire easily burns them. For thickening sauces, etc., see remarks on soup on p. 12. 110

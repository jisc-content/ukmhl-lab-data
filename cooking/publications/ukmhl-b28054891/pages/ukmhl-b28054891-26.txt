14 Soup and Sauce Book half a pint of boiling water. Let it simmer very gently for twenty minutes. Allow it to get cold. Put it into bottles and corh. This makes an excellent and tasteless colouring, but it must be carefully made. The rich brown colour comes from slow and gentle cooking. If it is burnt and black it is useless. Add to the soup a few minutes only before serving. Glaze.—Glaze is made by boiling down good stock until it is of a very thick and gluey con- sistency. Put a (piart of rich stock into a sauce- pan over a good lire. Leave it uncovered, and boil it until it is reduced to half a pint. Let it cool. Put it in a jar or bottle. Cover closely, and keep in a cool place. This will keep for two or three weeks. Adding vegetables and, meat to soups.—When- ever vegetables or meats have to be }>assed through a sieve or tammy, it will be found easier to do so if the pulp is kept continually well moistened with stock or milk (according to the soup which is being made). Wine and catsup.—Wine and catsup should always be added as late as possible, as they lose in tlavour by being boiled.

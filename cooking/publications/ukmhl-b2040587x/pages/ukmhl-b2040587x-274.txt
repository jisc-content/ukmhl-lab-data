ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. 268 enabled to form our own mould at a very trifling expense. You must proceed as follows : almost all the small figures^ or animals^ made in Prance or Germany^ are executed in common paste^ and con- sequently liable to take the damp. Put the figures into a pasteboard or deal box^ between two towels, or other linen; place them in a cellar for eight days j if made of very common paste^ three days will be sufficient; they will easily part in two with the blade of a knife; then they may be moulded, as will be seen in No. 579. These figures are generally put together with light paste, moistened with water : but whatever the cement may be, that part of the figure where it is joined is the weakest; consequently, by put- ting them in a warm stove, or in an oven, the great dryness which takes place will open your figures in. two parts; if they are made of fine sugar, you must have two figures alike, placing the back of one to the face of the other on wet linen; you can easily fit them together afterwards. Place them on a marble to receive the composition, and if your mould is in plaster, you must put some prepared linseed oil on it, that the sugar may not melt. 576.

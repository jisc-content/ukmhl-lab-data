ITALIAN CONFECTIONEE. 259 and applicable not only to figures, but to orna- ments, and to most purposes of a similar nature. 552. On Modelling Figures in Gum Paste, Model the limbs by hand, and fix on the head with a wire; and afterwards dress the figure, making every part of the drapery of its proper colour. To model the hand, you must divide the fingers with a pair of scissors, and mark the nails and joints with a modelling tool: this method will be found much better than pushing the figures in wooden moulds, as is usually done. 553. On Modelling Animals in Gum Paste, Make your paste of the natural colour of the animal (that is, without its coat); roll the paste of the necessary length and thickness. Suppose for a sheep : model the end of your paste to the head; give it the attitude; then model and fix on the legs, and let it dry; when dry, repair it neatly with a penknife, and a bit of sandpaper, or a file : then take some very white paste, make it rather thin with water, and cover it thinly all over: with a notched quill (as in j^^^^l^ H- fi9' 10) form the frizzled appearance of the wool, and comb the animaVs head and body with it to imitate nature. 554. Birds in Gum Paste, Make the body of the bird in the same manner as for animals; have the wings carved on wood, according to the size of the bird, push them, and paint them afterwards. E 2

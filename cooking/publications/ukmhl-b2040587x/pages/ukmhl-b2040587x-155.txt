149 ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. but this is a false calculation^ as it requires more than double the quantity of cassia to give anything Jike the taste of cinnamon ; when used in comfits, the former gives no taste whatever. Take a pound X)f cinnamon, steep it two or three hours in warm water to soften it, till it is easy to cut into little pieces half an inch long, as thin as possible; when cut, put it into the stove to dry; when sufficiently dry, put it into the pan slung over the charcoal fire, then take a whisk, dip it into your syrup, boiled to the strong thread, and shake it over the cinnamon with your left hand, shaking the pan with the right, to move the cinnamon; give eight or ten charges, taking care to shake it well till each is dry. Repeat this operation two or three times a day, till you perceive that the cinnamon is white, and of a suffi- cient consistence to allow you to put the syrup on with a ladle ; when the pieces of cinnamon are com- pletely covered, whiten them, giving them eight small charges, not forgetting to dry them after every charge, shaking them gently. Take care also to sift them every time you see any dust in the pan, and each time you put them into the stove to dry. When the comfits are white, have some syrup ^boiled to 2i pearl in your beading funnel, suspended to a cord, tied across the work-room by a spindle, to direct the sugar, which must flow like a small thread, gradually on the comfits, which you must continue to shake as gently as possible, and then put them again into the stove. The next day con- tinue the same operation, increasing the quantity of syrup; on the third and last day, use the double- refined sugar clarified.

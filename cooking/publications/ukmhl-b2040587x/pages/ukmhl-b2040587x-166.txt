160 ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. pounded ice, mixed with salt, or with salt, nitre, or soda. The freezing-pot should be always of pewter, because it prevents the contents of the vessel from congealing too quickly, and there is time enough.'' to mix them thoroughly; for, on this circumstance/ in a great measure, depends the excellence of the? ice. Tin vessels occasion too rapid a congelation,^ and do not afford time to well mix the materials.^ Some are of opinion, that when any article is iced it loses its sweetness, and that it ought therefore to have an additional quantity of sugar; but this is not correct: the diminution of the sweetness, arises from the materials not being properly mixed or worked with the spaddle, when in the freezing- pot. In ices that are badly mixed, the sugar sinks to the bottom, and they have necessarily a sharp, unpleasant taste. Another very general defect in ices, is their appearing full of lumps; they are also often of a disagreeable, dirty red colour; and therej are few houses in London where ices are to be found entirely free from these faults. To make ices, you must have a tub, or pail, in ! which you place your freezing-pot in the midst of^ pounded ice, well mixed with salt; the mixing of the salt with the ice must be particularly attended I to, as upon this circumstance depends the freezing power, and consequently, in a great measure, the goodness of the ice. The freezing-pots being set in the middle of the ice, up to the covers (see plate \l,fig. 9), put into them the articles you intend to' ice, which must be made agreeable to the palate, without being too sweet, as it is very easy to add a little syrup if necessary; keep turning the pots quickly round about in the ice, by means of the- handles at top, till the cream is set, opening theni'i

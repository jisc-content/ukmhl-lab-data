103 ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. SECTION VII. Of Jellies. 157. Of Jellies. Jelly is composed of the juice of fruits^ mixed with sugar^ but it is not every kind of fruit that will make a jelly; such only as are mucilaginous, as currants, apples_, black currants^ cherries, apri- cots, &c., being used for this purpose. You must take it as a general rule, that every jelly takes three quarters of a pound of sugar for one pound of juice. A fine sparkling white sugar may be used without being clarified. Syrup clarified and boiled to the crach, is recommended only when common sugar is used: the latter is more profitable for those in business. 158. Currant Jelly, Take any quantity of currants you please, pass them through a splinter or cane sieve, and put them on the fire, stirring them with a spaddle, till they begin to boil; then pass them through a flannel bag to clear the juice; measure your jelly, and take an equal quantity of syrup, boil it to a crach, put in the juice, and let it boil, till you see, by dipping your skimmer in the jelly, and again raising it, the jelly forms a web upon it, which, if boiled enough, will remain on the skimmer. Take it off* the fire, let it stand a few minutes, till the scum has settled on the surface, which must be removed with a skimmer, and it is then fit to put in your pots. When cold, cut pieces of paper to the size of your pots, and steep them in brandy, to cover the jelly.

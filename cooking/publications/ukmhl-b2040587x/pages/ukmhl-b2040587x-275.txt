269 ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. This mould will become very hard^ and more solid than the sulphur mould; the slips of glass are used to prevent the knife from cutting the mould; the glue hardens the plaster^ and forms the stucco, and the salt makes it take quickly; but however well they are made, they are never equal to wooden moulds. 577. Sulphur Moulds, Such articles as are in two pieces may be moulded in different compositions; the thing to be moulded must be fixed on a marble or glass table, very dry, and surrounded with a piece of pasteboard; to prevent it from running over, and to give the mould the form of a long square; prepare pieces of bent wire the length of your mould, which being placed in directly you put your composition, will strengthen it. Oil lightly the articles you intend to mould, with a hair pencil; put some sulphur in a glazed earthen pipkin, sufficient to cover your article three-eighths of an inch, and melt it on the fire; when it is melted and clear, and begins to thicken by the heat, take it from the fire, and add to it half its weight of pounded slate, brick, marble, iron, or brass filings, which must have been pounded and sifted through a silk sieve; mix, and stir it with a stick: and when it is well mixed, and smooth, pour it into your mould, not over the paste, but by the side of it, and the sulphur will find its level softly without blowing; when you see it covered, lay on your wires, put a little more over them; if you wish them stronger, put some plaster, and take off the mould with the blade of a knife; should anything stick fast in them, put them to soak in cold water.

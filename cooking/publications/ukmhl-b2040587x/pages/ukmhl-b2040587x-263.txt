They are to be joined together, and finished like the animals. 547. To push in the Mould. Everything made in a hollow mould is said to be pushed, particularly fillets. Eoll your paste to the length of your mould, powder it with starch, which you must keep for that purpose, tied up in a piece of linen, and also powder your mould a little; put in your paste, and with your thumb make it take the impression ; then take off the re- maining parts with a knife, holding the blade quite flat, that you may not cut the mould. The fillet will come out very easily, by touching it with a piece of paste, which you must moisten, to make it stick. 548. Imitation of China, You must previously have the moulds of what you wish to make. Such as small fancy jugs, dogs^ heads, whistles, or any pretty thing in china, of small size. Use gum paste made entirely of very white sugar; roll it as fine as possible ; and shape it in the mould : do not leave any marks of the joins. Let them be well dried; pass them over inside and out with a hair pencil dipped in royal icing, which must be very white, containing a small portion of lemon juice and gum Arabic. R

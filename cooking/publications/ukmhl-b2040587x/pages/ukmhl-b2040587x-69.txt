Of Spinning Sugar. You must have moulds of vases, baskets, &c._, or any shape you may choose, either in copper, tin, or glass; they must be made so as to deliver •well, in- side and out, and must be rubbed with butter as slightly as possible; sugar spun inside the mould is always better than that spun outside, as you may strengthen it with the threads that fly over by the motion of your arms, and the sugar will look smoother and more finished than when it is done on the outside. Take clarified sugar of the neces- sary proportion to the size of your mould, and boil it in a copper pan, which must be perfectly clean, and have a small sponge, dipped in clean water and squeezed out, to keep the inside edge of the pan free from sugar bubbles, which will not fail to fix there while it boils to a crack,—(See No. 11.) At the precise moment when this takes place, add a drop or two of lemon-juice, to grease it a little that the sugar may not grain.— (See No. 12.) Any acid, or even apple-jelly, if at hand, will answer the same purpose.

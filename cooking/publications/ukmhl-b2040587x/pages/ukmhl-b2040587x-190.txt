ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. 368. Liqueur Jelly, Jellies may be made with all sorts of liqueurs or wines, and are prepared in the same way as Venus^s clear jelly. 369. WhisJced Jellies Are nothing more than the preceding jellies whisked| when cold_, with a rod of birch twigs; they musi be put in their moulds as soon as they are set, hke a soft cream ; they must not have time to fix before they are whisi^ed_, as they would not take the smooth- form of the moulds ; the jelly thus whisked is not so long taking the ice as the others, 370. Macedoine Jdly. All the jellies from No. 350 to 369, are called Macedoine Jellies, when in the middle of the jellies are introduced all sorts of fruit in season, and ia the winter such as are preserved in brandy. If you use preserved fruit, the jellies must be liqueur or wine jellies. The different fruits must be arranged with taste, and their colours well blended and con- trasted ; large fruit must be cut in slices. These jellies are best made by using two moulds of different sizes; the smaller mould is put inside the larger one, and surrounded by jelly; when it is fixed, the inner mould is taken out by using a little warm water, and the hollow it leaves is to be filled up with layers of fruit and layers of jelly, which must be put in gradually, and each allowed to set before the next is added; when the whole is set, it is to be turned out on the dish and served up. 371.

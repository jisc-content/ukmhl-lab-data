The first object, it must be always recollected, in preserving the ice in a well, is to keep it dry; and if, unfortunately, the well is placed in a soil that will not permit it to drain itself, a pump must be fixed on the outside to draw off the water accumulated in the waste well. 342. Ices, Saccharometer, This instrument has been applied to the ices with immense success by the author : finding some of his ices highly approved of, induced him to dissolve the remains, and apply it to the saccharometer, to enable him to ascertam the degree of perfection. Having done that repeatedly, he always found that twenty-one degrees was the desired point; there-

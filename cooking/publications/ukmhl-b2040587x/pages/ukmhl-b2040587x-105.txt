Cherry Jam, 2 l^s. of Cherries, 1 lb. of Sugar. Choose two pounds of very ripe cherries, of a fine colour, take out the stones and stalks, put them into a pan on the fire, and reduce them nearly one half. Clarify two pounds of loaf-sugar, and boil it to the little crack; add the pulp, and mix it in well; put it back on the fire, and stir it with the spaddle : when you can easily see the bottom of the pan, you may be certain of its being done enough. g2

Buckland, M.A. With a Memoir of the Author, Steel Portrait, and 90 Full-Page Engravings. '* A work as much distinguished for the industry and research which it indicates, as for its scientific principles and philosophical views. The extra- ordinary and. inestimable facts which he has brought under the grasp of the general reader, have been illustrated by numerous and splendid embellish- ments ; and, while his descriptions of them are clothed in simple and perspi- cuous language, the general views to which they lead have been presented to us in the highest tone of a lofty and imp' essive eloquence. We have oui*- selves never perused a work more truly fascinating, or more deeply calculated to leave abiding impressions on the heart; and if this shall be the general opinion, we are sure that it vn\l be the source of higher gratification to the author than the more desired, though on his part equally deserved, meed of literary renown."—Edinburgh Review.

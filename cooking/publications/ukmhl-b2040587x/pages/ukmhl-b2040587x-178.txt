ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. 172 spot looking towards the north_, the soil either sand, gravel, or chalk, wherein yoa can easily build a well which will drain itself, the water soaking into the soil, by a waste well made under the other. An ice-well should be larger round than it is deep, for it is a common error to imagine that the deeper a well is the better; on the contrary_, we know that the water naturally runs towards the depth, and drawing towards the wells, penetrates through the brickwork^ and produces a humidity that melts the ice. To avoid this, a good well should be built with double walls, at a distance of eighteen inches or two feet apart, and the interval between filled up with ashes, or any other matter of an absorbent quality. The well must be built with a domed top (like a soup tureen), and a hole in the centre left to receive the ice. Over the dome of brickwork there should be a covering of earth, at least six feet in thickness, upon which a plantation may be formed, to keep off the sun^s rays : the hole in the centre of the dome should have a neck (like a large chimney-pot) se- cured with a strong cover of iron, running up through the superincumbent earth three or four feet, and should be kept always well covered with soil, and turfed over, as soon as the well is filled, to prevent any access of air in that direction. At the side of the well, upon a line with the bottom of the dome, an entrance must be made to take out the ice : it should consist of a porch with double doors, the outer of which must be covered with straw, or thatched, and every crevice in both doors stopped up, and made as air-tight as possible, A dry time ought to be chosen for filling the

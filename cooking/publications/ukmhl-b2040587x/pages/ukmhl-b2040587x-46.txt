40 ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. if it break on plunging your finger into the water, it is the great crack: you must be very attentive, for it passes rapidly to caramel^ and will burn^ if not attended to^ in a minute. 12. A Caramel, It breaks^ as just observed^ making a noise like glass. When the sugar is at the crack, add to it five or six drops of lemon-juice^ to prevent its grain- ing. When boiled, take it from the fire, and put the bottom of the pan into cold water, to prevent its burning. The production of caramel is attended with some difficulty, and great attention is neces- sary. As we can see in a moment the colour of caramel we wish to obtain, we must use the lemon- juice cautiously, as too large a quantity would spoil the sugar. If no lemon-juice be at hand, a few drops of vinegar, honey, or butterâ€”any acid or grease will smooth the sugar, which is naturally disposed to grain. As the sugar has no longer any i moisture, it requires a strong fire; but this must be applied to the body of the sugar only; for, if the fire be too fierce, it will burn the sugar to the sides of the pan, which will completely spoil it. The edges of the pan must be kept clean with a small sponge. The sugar in boiling throws bubbles to the sides of the pan, which adhere to it, and become white; this must be removed immediately with a small sponge dipped in cold water, which must be kept at hand, to keep the pan constantly clean, or the sugar will grain, and entirely spoil.

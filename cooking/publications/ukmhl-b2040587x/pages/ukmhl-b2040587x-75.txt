69 ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. syrup must be coloured according to taste : or it may be left white^ and painted with a brush after- wards^ as all the pieces of candy are different; those which are imitated must be carefully painted with the best colours^ similar to those employed for miniatures. 71. Vegetables and Fntits in Sugar. Take small leaden moulds (see No. 578), made to open in two, representing the fruit you would imitate; boil your sugar to a hloio^ and add the colour of your vegetable or fruit (see Colours) ; stir your sugar till it grains and the surface shines; pour it into the moulds with a funnel, such as you use for liqueur drops (see ^late I. Jig. 8), and stop the funnel with a little stick every time the mould is full. If you wish to imitate carrots, colour them with saffron, and stick in bits of angelica, while hot, to form the green top; place the mould so that the head of the carrot will form the mouth of it. Apples, pears, radishes, are to be coloured after they are made, with carmine. Turnip-radishes, mushrooms, eggs, dominoes, dice, &c., must be made like conserve, that is, with fine powdered sugar, as they will be much whiter; give each a different taste with essences, or spirits; mushrooms are coloured with chocolate, melted very thin, on a warm stove : asparagus, potatoes, everything, in short, may be imitated with moulds. 7 2. Chesnuts with Sugar. Take a pound of the finest clarified sugar, boil it to a hlow ; take it from the fire, and work it as for a conserve; take six yolks of eggs, beat them up, and add a glass of maraschino, or any other liqueur.

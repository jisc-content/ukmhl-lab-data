ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. 264 566. Vermilion and Cinnabar Are two different shades of a lively red colour; they are equally dangerous^ and should never be used in confectionery unless absolutely indis- pensable. 567. Bol Ammoniac Is of a reddish colour^ something like cinnamon, and used for gilding (see No. 572), or to paint' gum paste, as well as brown umber, and bistre. 568. Of using Colours, The colours just mentioned, are those used to paint gum paste \ they are ground on a marble slab, and are moistened with water, and a little gum Arabic dissolved and strained through a cloth, with a pinch of fine powdered sugar, or sugar candy; the gum is to fix the colour, and the sugar to make it shine; if you have no gum, you may use isinglass, but then the colour must be warm. 569. Colours good to eat. The colours fit to eat are cochineal, carmine di- luted, saffron, spinach green, Prussian blue, and colours made with chocolate and caramel; caramel should be diluted with a little water, as it goes farther than the dry powder; yet in some cases it must be used dry, as in the royal iceing, and in articles for the small oven : saffron must be infused in hot water, consequently you must put the ne- cessary quantity to your sugar a moment before it is done; it will require a few minutes more boiling, as the saffron will lessen the degree of heat; s]^inach

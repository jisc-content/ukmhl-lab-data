41 ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. SECTION II. Of Candies, dec. 13. Sugar Candy, Candy is crystallized sugar_, congealed and dried into small shining particles. To make sugar candy, you must have a copper or tin mouldy of a some- what conical shape, pierced with holes to receive the threads which must be fastened in.â€” (See ^late l.fig, 3.) The outside must be covered with double paper, pasted on close, to prevent the sugar from running through, and the mould must be perfectly dry. Have a stove heated to a moderate heat (see No. 220), and when ready, proceed as follows. 14. Production of Candy, Put into a pan syrup enough, that is, clarified sugar (see No. 2), to fill your moulds; place the pan on a brisk fire, till the syrup comes to the small feather (see No. 9) ; skim it well, take the pan from the fire, and pour into it a small quantity of spirits of wine. If you wish it to sparkle, let it rest till you see a small skin on its surface, which is candy; take it ofi* with a skimmer, or slice, and pour it directly into the mould, which you must place in your stove, the heat of which must be kept at the same degree as described in No. 220, for eight days. You must then drain the candy, by making a hole, and slanting the mould on a basin or pan to receive the drainings ; let it drain twelve hours, till it is perfectly dry, then loosen the paper, by moistening it with warm water; put it near the fire, warm it all round, and turn out the candy.

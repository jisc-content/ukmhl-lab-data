127 ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. 215. Mogul Plums,^ Take moguls^ neither too ripe nor too green_, that is^ when they begin to turn yellow prick them all over with a fork, and put them into cold water; put them on the fire with sufficient water so that they do not rub against one another, add a handful of salt, and stir them till they are tender; you must be very careful, as they will soon go to pieces and spoil; take them out, and put them into cold water : when cold, drain and preserve them, as in No. 195. 216. Currants in Bunches,\ Take the finest red or white currants you can get, open them on one side, and take out the seeds with a needle, and tie as many of them together by the stalk, with red thread, as will form a pretty bunch; weigh them, and for every pound of fruit take one pound and a half of clarified sugar (see No. 2); boil it to the great ^earl; put in your bunches of currants, and boil them all over well; take them off, let them stand five minutes, and skim them well. Repeat this twice more; you will know when they are done, as the syrup boils exactly like the currant jelly.â€”(See No. 158.) * The plum should melt in the mouth, should be sweet, and have a little perfume in its flavour. There are twenty sorts of plums: Early Morocco, Early Damask, Orleans, Green Gage, Primordian, Black Damask, La Royale, Great Damask, Egg Plum, Apricot Plum, Catherine, Eed Imperial, Drap d'Or, Imperatrice, Damson, Wine Sour, Violet, Per- drigon, Blue Gage, Bullace, and Mirabelle Plums. t The white currants possess the same qualities as the red, and are generally larger. The different kinds are, White Grape, Common White, Common Red, Champagne, and Black Currants.

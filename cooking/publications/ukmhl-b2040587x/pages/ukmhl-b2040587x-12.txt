vi PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION. W. A. J. were invented or improved by the writer; and he can safely recommend them, from long experience of their utility in his own practice. In offering his first production to the public, the Author feels the diffidence natural to a new attempt. His object has been to produce a useful, rather than a large volume; and, wherever the subject admitted it, he has, as much as possible, compressed his materials. In describing the mi- nulise of various processes used in his art (however familiar to himself in practice), he fears he may not always have succeeded in conveying his ideas so clearly as might be desired; but the difficulty of explaining, by words alone, the most trifling manual operation, is so well known to all who have made the experiment, that he solicits and relies upon the indulgence of the liberal critic for any deficiencies that may be found in this depart- ment of his work; and generally, for any other defects, which he is apprehensive may have oc- curred, from writing in a language not native to him.

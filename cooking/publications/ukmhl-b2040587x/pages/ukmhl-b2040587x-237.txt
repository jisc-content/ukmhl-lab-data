ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. 231 colate, cinnamon, cofFee_, &c.; white for orange- flower; green for pistachios, filberts, almonds, &c. The various colom^s may be mixed, and thus pro- duce a pleasing assortment, as yellow and red to- gether, blue and yellow, red and blue, Sec. The paste, thus prepared, roll into little balls in the palm of your hands, taking care to wet them with a little water, to make them shine; set them on paper in a very slack oven, as the colours require I great care and attention. You may make little I paper cases also, like those for biscuits {^^^ plate l. fig^ 18), but they must be only an inch over, with depth in proportion; into these put some of the same paste; it is then called biscuit case; you may put a small almond in each, or some prawlined orange-flowers; always moisten the surface before you bake them. 475.

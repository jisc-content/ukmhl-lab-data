151 ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. 274. Cherry Comfits, r Take ten pounds of dried cherries (see No. 184), roll them singly in your hands, to make them round, and put them in a sieve, sprinkled with fine" «ugar, and roll them well in it, to prevent their sticking to one another; put them in the stove; when dry, place them in the balanced comfit pan, and give them a charge of gum Senegal, stirring them lightly with your hand, that they may be moistened equally; throw in some very finely sifted sugar, dry them well, and put them back in the stove for two or three hours; afterwards re- peat the operation as above, and put them back in the stove for a day; on the next day proceed as for almonds.—(See No. 261.) 275. Barberry Comfits Are made in the same way as the preceding. Cur- rant and raspberry comfits are also made in the same manner. 276. Carraway Comfits, Clean and prepare your carraways as the celery seed (see No. 273) ; they must be smoothed like the almonds (see No. 261), and they may be jjearlecl like the celery. 277. Comfits in Gim Paste, Confectioners, who make large quantities of comfits, keep together the scrapings of their comfit pan, and broken bits, to be dried, pounded, and sifted through a silk sieve, which, mixed with gum dragon, moistened, form a gum paste. Different flavours are given, as coffee, chocolate, bergamot.

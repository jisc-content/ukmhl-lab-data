ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. 109 177. MarsJi^Mallow Paste. \ ib. of Gum Senegal, \ lb. of S3^rup, \ pint of Apple Juice, 1 drop of Essence of Naroli. Put into a mortar half a pound of gum Senegal, I pound and sift it through a hair sieve, dissolve it in double its quantity of water, and let it stand a day or two : when perfectly melted, strain it through a lawn sieve, and add to it a quarter of a pint of apple juice,^ prepared as for apple jelly (see No. 162); put it on the fire, with half a pound of sugar clarified, and dry it to a thick consistence, taking care to have a little fire, covered with ashes, i under it; then whisk to a snow three whites of eggs, and add them to your paste. Continue to stir the mixture, to prevent its sticking to the pan, which would entirely spoil your paste. You will know when it is done, if, on applying some of the paste to the back of your hand, it does not stick : this mode of making it is rather tedious, but it is the best. Add to your paste a drop of essence of naroli, or a glass of orange-flower water; when finished, powder a marble slab with starch-powder, on which you must flatten your paste; when cold, you may cut it into long strips ; then put it in boxes, well powdered with starch, that it may not stick together. 178. Liquorice Paste Is made like the preceding. You must cut into little pieces a pound of stick-liquorice, and boil it * Marsh-Mallow is not used on account of its unpleasant taste; apple juice is equally good, and possesses the same healing qualities: if it be wished, however, to use marsh- mallow, the necessary quantity is half a pound, taking care that the roots be quite fresh.

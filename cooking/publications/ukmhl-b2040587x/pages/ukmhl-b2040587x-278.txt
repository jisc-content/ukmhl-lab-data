Of Hecoration, of Works in Pasteboard, Gold and Silver Faper-Foil, d&c. 6cCm 582. 0/Decoration. The decoration of the table regards chiefly the arrangement of the Dessert, which should consist of Assiettes Montees, baskets of fruit and flowers, a variety of bon-bons, porcelain figures, glass, &c., which should all be arranged with taste and elegance. The art of decoration was formerly carried to a great extent in France, immense sums were expended upon it, and many of the first artists in the difi'erent departments were employed; the whole, when completed, had the appearance of enchantment. The author is proud to enumerate among his friends, Messrs. Monprive, Leccelan, and Cocard, who have executed decorations and'' embelhshments for the table, which will probably never be surpassed. But this ornamental style of arranging the dessert is not much used in England, a few Assiettes Montees only being employed to decorate the table. Farewell, then, fine groupes, allegorical subjects, trophies, country sports, land- scapes, and mythological emblems! Till better' times shall arrive, we must content ourselves with the simple Assiettes Montees: the construction of which, and the materials composing them, we shall describe.

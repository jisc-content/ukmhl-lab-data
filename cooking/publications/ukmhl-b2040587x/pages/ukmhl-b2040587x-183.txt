177 ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. 348. Green Gages in Brandy. Take green gages before they are quite ripe; cut off half the stem^ prick them and put them in a pan full of water^ so that the water be three or four inches above the fruit; place your pan on a mode- rate fire_, and when the water is so hot that you cannot bear your finger in it^ take the pan off, and throw in a handful of salt^ and a handful of j spinach ; cover it with a cloth^ and let it cool. The next day, put the fruit on a gentle fire for two or three hours, taking care that the water does not boil; if you have a thermometer, you may regulate the heat to two hundred degrees, which it should never exceed. When the fruit is of a perfect green, and it rises on the water, put it into cold water, and finish as the apricots. 349. Cherries in Brandy, Take some fine morello cherries, cut off half the stems, and put them into cold water; when well washed, drain them on a sieve, and place them in your glasses; fill them with brandy at twenty- three degrees, and add to each bottle a little cinna- mon, broken or slightly pounded: render the bottles completely air-tight, and leave them for a month or two. After that time, separate the cherries from the brandy, measure it, and add to every pint four ounces of pounded sugar; stir and melt it, and strain it two or three times through a flannel bag; when perfectly clear, put it on your jcherries : to be used at pleasure.

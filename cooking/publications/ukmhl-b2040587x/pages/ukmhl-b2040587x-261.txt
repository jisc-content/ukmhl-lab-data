Take a small quantity of paste in your left hand, pick off little pieces with your right; and with the fore-finger roll them on the gratings of a fine wire sieve, to take the impression and form of a shell; they may be scented with any essence you please. You may also have different pleasing forms engraved on a board, to answer the same purpose as the sieve, and to give variety. 543. Jewel Fruit in Gum Paste. Divide your paste into as many colours as you intend to represent fruits, as small apples, pears, peaches, apricots, plums, or any kind of vegetables ; in short, any object you may fancy. You must have moulds for melons, nuts, walnuts, almonds, cards, figures, and a thousand little things which belong to the jewel comfits; put different essences to the fruit, and form and finish them like the large fruit. If you wish to make a large quantity, you must have twenty or more of those little fruits, or other objects, engraved on a board; by this means you may make them with great rapidity. The author has found this so great an advantage, that he has engraved an entire collection of different fruits, &c.; they should not be larger than peas.

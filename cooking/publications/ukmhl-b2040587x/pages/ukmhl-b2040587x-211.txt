205 ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. 411. Orange Hearts, lib. Sugar, IJH). yolk of Eggs, 4 caps of preserved Orange Peel, J lb of Sweet Almonds, the Kaspings of 4 Lemons, the whites of 8 Eggs, and | lb. of Flour. Take your yolks of eggs^ powdered sugar, pre- served orange peel^ pounded, the almonds pounded very fine, with rose-water, and the lemon raspings, and mix all together, stirring it with a wooden spoon in a circular-bottomed pan, till it comes to a light paste ; when the paste is very light, whisk up your whites of eggs to a strong snow^ and put the paste to them, turning it over gently till the whites are well mixed in; sift your flour, and stir it in as lightly as possible. Bake these biscuits in a slack oven, in tins, the shape of a heart, with five I sheets of paper under them ; observe to butter your tins well, and ice the biscuits before they are baked. To make these biscuits, use the same paste as for ! sponge biscuits, but whatever flavour you desire, add it to your eggs, when mixed with the sugar ; as an example for vanilla, take a pod or two of vanilla, cut it very fine with a knife, and mix it with pow- dered sugar, pounding it very fine in a mortar; then sift and add it to your paste; the flavour of orange, lemon, or cedraties, may be given by rubbing the fruit on the top of loaf-sugar, or grating it on a nutmeg-grater, or you may pound them in a mor- ! tar with some sugar, to obtain a more complete 1 essence. 412.

ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. out doubt^ more perfect than those done upon the fire. The quantities in the mixture are the same; the difference only is, that, instead of using clarified, sugar, you must take double-refined crystallized white sugar, and put it in a glass with the juice of the fruit, decoction, or milk extracted from almonds: by putting this glass in water upon the fire, the sugar melts by the caloric of the water, and no I alteration of taste is produced. ' The glass being shut or corked, and the sugar being perfectly melted, the syrup is found done. The author has an instrument, which he obtained at Paris, called SLpese-sirop, or saccharometer, the same as the pese-liquors, or hydrometer; this is steeped in the syrup ; and, if at thirty-two degrees, lit is done to that consistence fit to keep. The I same instrument serves also to ascertain every de- gree of sugar j that is to say, to know what quan- tity of sugar is contained in the liquid; for in- stance, put the instrument into water, and it will mark 0 ; but if you add a small portion of syrup, it will mark the degree. This instrument is ex- tremely necessary when clarifying sugar with animal black, as we make use of it in the clarifi- cation, which assures us if it requires any more water, or no, at the point of ebullition, to bring it to its proper degree.

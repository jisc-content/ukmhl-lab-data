You must first make the moulds in plaster of Paris, made to open in two or three parts, upon some fine and very fresh fruits; when your moulds are ready, boil to a blow some syrup, clarified with animal black, as stated in the white clarification ; when boiled to a blow, let it stand a moment ofi* the fire; then add to it a tea-spoonful of white French vinegar, or the juice of half a lemon ; work them with a spaddle; this syrup, to grain it; and when it begins to whiten, pour it into the plaster moulds, which you have dipped in fresh water a few minutes previously. When your moulds are full, turn them upside down to empty them, and there will remain a portion of sugar congealed in the interior of the mould, which, when cold, by opening the mould, will come out, formed in its natural state. When all your fruits that you desire to obtain are finished, paint them with water-colours, according to their nature. You must observe not to use any colours but what are wholesome; viz., spinach green, fine car- mine, cochineal, safi^ron; and for the imitation of brown spots, use a decoction of coffee, chocolate, and Spanish-liquorice juice : the bloom of the peaches and fruits is supplied with fine-pounded sugar.

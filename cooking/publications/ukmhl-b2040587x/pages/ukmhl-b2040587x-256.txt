250 ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. 529. Common Gum Taste Is made like the fine^ except that to the sugar you pound it with_, is added some starch_, powdered very fine^ half sugar, half starch; it may be made still more common, by adding one quarter of sugar only, 530. ^ice Gum Taste. Instead of starch, use rice flour. 531. Plaster Gum Paste. Moisten some fine plaster of Paris with water, and let it set; dry it perfectly in the stove, reduce it again to powder; wet, dry, and pound it again, to take out the remaining heat; sift it through a silk sieve, and use it to fill the gum dragon instead of sugar. Marble gum paste is made in the same manner, using marble dust instead of sugar, of which there is to be none in either of these pastes; harden both with a little powdered starch ; it must be used half dry, to fix it, as it is apt to shrink very much. These pastes are only used for ornament. 532. Drying Oil Paste, When you have steeped the gum, as directed in No. 528, put it into a mortar, with nearly an equal quantity of gum Senegal, dissolved rather stifi*, and add pulverized sugar, to give it a body, or con- sistence ; when well pounded, and so that it sticks well, add a little drying oil, prepared from linseed. Take equal parts of starch, prepared plaster, and rice flour, with whitening, and harden your paste with this mixture; when your paste is smooth, compact, and shining, you have used oil enough.

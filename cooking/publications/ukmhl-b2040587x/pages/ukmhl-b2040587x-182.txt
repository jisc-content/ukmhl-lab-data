ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. 176 mix the whole in the barrel; leave it in the cellar for a year^ till the fruit season arrives^ then tap it, and you will have a liqueur more fit for your fruit than what is generally bought for this purpose, and quite as good as the brandy of France. 346. Peaches in Brandy, Choose the peaches you mean to preserve, a little^ before they are ripe, take off the down by wiping them with a cloth ; prick them with a small fork to ' the stone, and put them as you do them into water, then on a moderate fire, keeping the water i; nearly boiUng; when you find your fruit softened, . so as to give way to the finger, throw them into cold water, and leave them to stand for a quarter of, an hour; change this water for another, and let them stand another quarter of an hour ; drain them on clean towels, and, when dry, arrange them regu- larly in a glass jar; have some clarified sugar boiled to the little ^earl; a quarter of syrup for two- thirds of fruit is a sufficient quantity; put to them ' double the quantity of brandy, at thirty degrees; ' mix, and strain it through a flannel bag two or I three times, and place the peaches regularly in ' your jars, and cover them with bladders, well tied'; down. 347. Apricots in Brandy, Apricots are prepared in the same way as peaches, except that you must boil them in the syrup, in which they must be left for a day; on the next take them out, drain, and put them in order in , your glasses; put your syrup on the fire, boil it to the pearl, and finish like the peaches. Mirabelle plums, and other fruits, are done in the same manner.

72 ITALIAN CONFECTIONEE. 75. Artificial Strawherries. Make an almond paste (see Almond Paste), an roll and cut it to the size of a strawberry; then work it in your hands, to give it the same form, and fix a piece of whisk in the stalk-end of each ; put them, as prepared, in a sieve full of pounded sugar^ that they may stand regularly; have some sugar pounded coarse^ then sift it through a coarse sieve and a still finer one, to take away the dust. Dip your strawberries into a syrup of raspberries, or any other fruit, and then in your sugar, to form the little seeds. The strawberry being dry, take some carmine, dissolved in strong gum, that the fruit may shine, and give the colours with a fine hair pencil. When dry, take out the pieces of whisk, and leave the whole white. Put them in a warm place to dry for a few hours, and serve them on plates, with strawberry leaves. 76. Small Sausages, Take some entrails, which may be had ready cleaned at the pork butcher^s; wash them again very clean; then take some red and white apple, or quince paste, chop it like sausage-meat, and put in, if you choose, some apricots, cherries, or any other red or white fruit, with some red and white currants, or any kind of fruit to imitate nature, and a few coriander seeds. Fill the skins, tie a knot at each end with some thready and roll the sausages in your hands, with a drop of oil of sweet almonds. It may be cut lengthwise, or across : it is an excellent imitation of nature.â€” (For the Pastey see each article separately).

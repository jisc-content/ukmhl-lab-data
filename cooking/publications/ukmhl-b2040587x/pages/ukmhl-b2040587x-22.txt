xvi ON DESSERTS AND BILLS OF FARE. for one person; tliey should be prettily dressed up in a round dish^ over a table napkin nicely folded. . If you wish to distinguish yourself^ make a socle or basket, which -you can accomplish by pouring some water in a copper or tin mould, and leaving it over some rough ice mixed with salt; in a very few hours it will be frozen to a solid body; it is very pretty in different colours, and may be ob- tained by first putting clear water at the bottom of your mould : when that is frozen, pour in one inch of water coloured with cochineal; when that is congealed, put water in again, and so on till your mould is filled. It is extremely pretty if you introduce fresh flowers and green leaves in your moulds filled with spring-water; when it is frozen in a solid mass, turn it out, and you will have a beautiful basket, as if it was in crystal: put that basket over the napkin, fill the basket with your ices, made in the shape of different fruits, and paint them according to nature. See Ices in Fruit Shapes, No. 339.â€”Observe, not to fill your dishes too full; it is bad taste, and very awkward to serve.

Choose the prettiest preserved fruit you have dry from the sugar or preserved in brandy. 49. Chesnuts in Caramel, Take some chesnuts, and roast them in a pan on the fire; when peeled, stick into each a piece of whisk; dip them in your sugar, and lay them on the marble; or if you would form them into a basket, place them side by side in a mould for that purpose, slightly buttered, and raise them progres- sively to the required height; which you may also do without a mould, by putting a drop of caramel between them. Having finished placing the ches- nuts, you may ornament them with little flowers, or horns, rings, wreaths, &c., all in gum paste, V and coloured with other trifles in candy. 50.

261 ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. cinnabar; but you may easily manufacture ear- mine^ as follows :â€”Take a boiler sufficiently large to contain two pails and a half of river water, per- fectly clear; put it on the fire, and when it boils, shake in gently a pound of cochineal, ground in a new coffee mill; stir it with a clean hair pencil, and if the heat be too great, lessen your fire, and throw in a glass of cold water, that the cochineal may not boil over; let it boil for half an hour, then add an alkaline lye, prepared as follows. Boil three quarters of an ounce of pulverized soda in two quarts of water, for eight or ten minutes ; take it off, filter it, put it into your cochineal; let it boil up five or six times ; take off the boiler, place it in a slanting position, that the cochineal may deposit; add to it three quarters of an ounce of powdered alum, stir it well, to dissolve the alum, and let it stand for twenty-five minutes. See if it takes a fine scarlet colour; pour off the liquor very gently into another clean boiler, and do not stir it much, to avoid dividing the deposit; beat up the whites of two eggs in a pint of water, pour it into the colour; stir it well, put the boiler on the fire till it nearly boils; the whites of the eggs will coagulate, and precipitate with the colouring particles which are to form the carmine. Take the boiler off, and let the carmine settle for twenty-five minutes; pour off the liquid till you see the carmine at the bottom, which will be like thick milk; pour it into an earthen pan or bowl, strain it through a fine cloth, to let the moisture run from it, and drain the car- mine. You must strain the liquid several times, till it is quite clear; when the carmine is drained, and has a proper consistence, take it up with a silver spoon, lay it on plates to dry in the stove, and, when dry, grind it on the stone.

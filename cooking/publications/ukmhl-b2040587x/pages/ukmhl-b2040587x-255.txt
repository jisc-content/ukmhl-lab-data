ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. 249 was made for the centre of a table; and the Emperor, who rarely noticed anything which orna- mented the table, observed his portrait, and, with his characteristic attention to works of ingenuity, was pleased to encourage the artist by his approbation. 528. Fine Gum Taste, Gum dragon is the principal ingredient in gum paste; it should be white and light, and every little spot on it should be scraped off with a pen- knife : put into a pan the required quantity of gum, and pour water on it to wash it, which you may do twice; when clean, put fresh water on it to dis- solve it, from one to two inches above the gum; let it stand for twenty-four hours, then crush it with a spaddle, strain it very thick, through a cloth, that it may be clean, and let two persons wring the cloth. Should much of it be wanted, a press (as in j^late II. fig. 3) will be found useful: it was in- vented by the author when he was in the habit of mixing sixty or eighty pounds of gum paste every week, and he found it very serviceable. The gum is to be put in a bag of thick linen, tightened and fixed within a cylinder, pierced as in plate Yi.. fig, 3. When the gum is strained, pound it in a mortar, adding some extremely fine and white powdered sugar, a very little at a time : the great art of making this paste white, is the using of very fine sugar and gum, and having the mortar, as well as everything else used for it, perfectly clean; the use of lemon-juice, or any other secret, is mere fancy. When the paste breaks in pulling, it is done; keep it in a pot covered with a wet cloth. This paste is to be used in everything which is intended to be eaten.

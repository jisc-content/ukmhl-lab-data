Boil to the great blow a sufficient quantity of syrup to fill the hollow of the lake^ to represent the water; having previously modelled in gum paste little swans, place them in various parts of the syrup ; put it into the stove for three hours, then make a small hole through the paste, under your lake, to drain off the syrup ; a crust will remain with the swans fixed in it, representing the water. You must now build the rock on the pedestal, with pieces of rock-sugar, biscuits, and other appropriate articles in sugar, fixed to one another, supported by the confectionery paste you have put in the middle, the whole being cemented together with caramel and ornamented according to your fancy. The rest of the piece must now be neatly finished : upon the top of the- rock could be fixed a China pagod, temples, pa-r» vilion, or any other thing you choose; the cascades and other ornaments must be spun in sugar.—(See No. 63.) 379. Roi/al Iceing, If you wish to mask the piece montee with iceing to imitate marble, take some double-refined sugar, pounded and sifted extremely fine; wet it with the juice of lemon and clean water, and mix it with a spaddle; when of a tolerable consistence, lay it on. parts of yoMYpiece montee with a hair pencil; when dry, it will make the finest possible glaze, and yoa may paint on it whatever you please.

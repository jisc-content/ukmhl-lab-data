Examine first the fruit you intend to candy, one by one, and prepare them as above : they must be quite dry; then take a nearly square mould, broader at the top than at the bottom, with wire gratings {see plate \*fig* 4), and place each article, side by side, on the first grating, nearly at the bottom of the mould, so that one does not touch the other. The first sort being thus arranged, take the second, and placing it on the fruit of the first, cover it in like manner; continue thus to the last, which you must cover with a grating, on which place an iron or leaden weight, to fix the whole, and keep it firm; then place your mould or box in the stove, in a moderate heat (see No. 220); take and boil a sufficient quantity of clarified sugar, to fill up the remaining vacancy in the mould ; take the sugar off* as soon as it comes to the little blow (see No. 8) ; let it cool; take off*, with your skimmer, the little candy formed on it in cooling; pour it into the mould, let it candy without touching it, keeping it an equal heat for ten or twelve hours; then strain it, by uncork- ing the mould, and slanting it towards a bowl placed to receive the waste syrup. If you .wish to ascertain the size of the grain of the candy, place in the four corners of the mould a small piece of whisk; when you draw one out, after ten hours, you may judge by the three others, which you with- draw every hour, of its consistence; let it drain well, and turning it over, let it dry; when it is

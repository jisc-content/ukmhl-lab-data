204^ ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. ference. Spread as many as you can on a sheet of paper, and bake them in a hot oven; when cold, take them off, place two of them together, back to back^ and put them in a warm place for two days; these cakes will keep good for a year, if put in a dry place, 410. Almond Hearts, 1 lb. of Sweet Almonds, 1\ !b. of Su^ar, the Easpings of 4 Lemons, 24 Eggs, and 1 ft. of Flour. Take your almonds fresh blanched, and pound them very fine with whole eggs; when you cannot feel any lumps in them, add your powdered sugar, and mix it well in the mortar with the lemon raspings, then take out your paste and put it in a large circular pan or basin, taking care to have a vessel large enough, as the mixture will fill a twelve- quart pan. Put the yolks of twenty-four eggs to your paste, and whisk it for a quarter of an hour; then break in six whole eggs, and whisk it another quarter of an hour; and afterwards six more eggs; and repeat the same again, making altogether eighteen whole eggs; if your paste be not thick enough, it will require a little more whisking till it becomes a thick paste, for the goodness of the paste depends more on the proper whisking of it, than on the whites of eggs ; then take the twenty-* four whites of eggs, and whisk them to a strong snow ; sift your flour, stir it well in your paste, and then put in your whites, and stir them in as light as you can; butter your heart-tins, and put six sheets of paper under them; bake the hearts in a gentle heat, as they will then keep their shape; if you bake them in too hot an oven, they fall in the sides^ and their shape is spoiled.

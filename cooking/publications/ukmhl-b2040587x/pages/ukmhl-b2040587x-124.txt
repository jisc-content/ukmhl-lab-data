lis ITALIAN CONFECTIONEE. 195. Green Gagesy Wet, Let your fruit be neither ripe nor green; prick the gages all round with a fork^ and put them in a copper pan with water enough to swim in ; put it on a moderate fire^ and when the water nearly boils, take it off, and let the gages remain in it till next day, then put them back on the fire in the,same water, with a handful of salt, or spinach, to turn them green; you must keep them warm for three hours, taking care that the water does not boil. Continue to stir them; when they are green, in- crease the fire, and when they begin to swim, take them out and put them into cold water, which should be ready for the purpose; renew the water several times, that the gages may be quite cold; drain them on sieves. Take some syrup and boil it to the little tliread; put the fruit into it, and let it boil up a few times; skim it well, and let the gages remain in the syrup for four days; drain the fruit off every day, and put the syrup to boil a degree, and skim and pour, it over the fruit. The fifth day your sugar must be at the pearl; put the fruit in, and let the syrup boil over it; take it off, skim it well, and put it in dry pans for use, with syrup enough to cover it. 196. Mirahelle Plums, Wet* Prick them all over, like the green gages, and The Mirabelle Plum is now common in England; it is found in great abundance in the neighbourhood of Mentz; and the confectioners of that town carry on an extensive trade in them: when preserved, they are packed in round boxes, each containing a pound, and are forwarded to all parts of France, the Continent, and foreign countries.

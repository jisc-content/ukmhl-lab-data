To make this ball, you must have two pieces of wood, the one concave and the other convex, about the size of half an egg; cut some pieces of paper of a sufficient size to take the form of half a ball; when pressed between these two pieces of wood, you must fold the paper in small folds, so as to be able to take easily the form of half a ball; having a certain quantity made, you must fill them with powdered loaf-sugar; this operation being finished, have several moulds made like that represented in plate \, fig, 5; boil some clarified sugar to the hlow^ put about an inch in depth of sugar in each mould; place over the syrup in your moulds your half balls, side by side, so as not to touch each other : all your moulds being thus filled, put them in a hot stove for about six hours ; afterwards strain off the syrup, as before; let them dry, and close up perfectly, during seven or eight hours, then turn your mould upside down on the table, and take out all the powdered sugar which served to retain them in the syrup like a vessel; then take a camePs-hair pencil, and with cold water wet the paper in the interior, which will enable you to take off the paper with ease, and the candy fixed round will remain solid and transparent, in half balls ; these, when dry, you can smooth, by rubbing them with a fine file, or some scouring paper, so as to make both parts meet with exactness, and form a ball, which you will fix with a little gum Arabic; you can also paint in the interior some small flowers, a motto, or other ornaments, which produce a pleas- ing effect.

147 ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. 265. Rose Almonds Are to be made as above. To colour them, pat some liquid carmine in the syrup intended for the last ten charges; on the third day add gum Sene- gal in the first charge. Take care that the almonds are only lukewarm, as too much heat makes them take the heat in blots. Each charge must be gradually diminished, so that the last must be a very small one; on the fourth day, smooth them, as directed in No. 261, with fine sugar, but no colour; they must have three charges, to give them a gloss. 266. Cinnamon Almonds, As before; only at every fourth layer of sugar, you must add gum Senegal, and a little pulverized cinnamon. Striped almonds, or those which show various colours in stripes, when -broken, are made by mixing a different colour in every four or six charges of sugar, and afterwards covering the whole with white. 267. Egg Comfits. Have the two halves of an egg made in box- wood ; take some gum paste, roll it out quite thin, and put into the casts, make it lay close, cut off with a knife the outside edges quite smooth, let them dry, and prepare what you mean to put into them. They are usually filled with imitations of all sorts of fruits.â€”(See No. 543.) In Paris, they put in a number of nicknacks, little almanacks, smelling bottles with essences, and even things of value, for presents. Join the two halves with some of the same paste, moistened with a little water and some gum Arabic; then proceed as in No. 160. K 2

Sugar will not ferment, nor be fermented, without yeast; being dissolved in four times its weight of water, that is, four pounds of water to \ one of sugar. When once the fermentation begins, \ it continues to the end. 2. To clarify Loaf-Sugar, ■ Break the sugar you want into a copper pan^ ] which will hold a third more than the required quantity; put about half a pint of water to every, pound of sugar, and beat up some whites of eggs ^ with it: one is sufficient for six pounds of sugar (some confectioners put the yolk and shells with i the whites crusted together, but this only adds to ' the scum) : put it on the fire, and when it rises in ] boiling, throw in a little cold water, which must, always be kept at hand in a basin, in case the sugar , should rise rapidly and boil over. Let it rise three • times without skimming it; the fourth time skim i it well, throwing in a little cold water each time, till the white scum ceases to rise; then strain it through a sieve, cloth strainer, or flannel bag.— {See plate I. j%. 2.) Save the scum for use. When ' a certain quantity of scum is taken off, it may he\ clarified; the latter skimming may be reserved, to add to fermented wines.

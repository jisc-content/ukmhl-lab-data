243 ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. 509. Ligiieur made with Spirits. One pint of spirits^ one pint of water^ and one pound of sugar. To render our distilled aromatic spirits fit for drinking we must add water and sugar. When you wish to make a few bottles of liqueurs, or factitious spirits, take a pound of fine sugar, dissolve it in a pint of cold water, and add to it a pint of spirits ; mix them, and let them stand for twenty-four hours, filtering them through blot- I ting paper, which must be folded and put into a I funnel in the bottle intended to receive the liqueur : the strength of the liqueur may be regulated ac- cording to taste. Dealers in compounds and cordials I filter their liqueurs through a thick kind of cloth, made by hatters, in the form of a bag; the bag is to be wetted with isinglass, clarified with white wine, by moistening it with a sponge, and wetting the bag regularly all over the inside; the liqueur then passes through it very clear. 510. Of Colouring Liqueurs. All spirits being white, liqueurs are commonly coloured, either to please the eye, or to conceal the defects of an inferior article; pernicious colours, as blue and violet, are sometimes used for this pur- pose; the rose and yellow colours are perfectly innocent: to colour yellow, infuse saffron in spirits of wine, or dissolve caramel in a little water (see No. 12), but the sugar must be burnt of a darker I colour; to colour liqueurs red, use prepared cochi- I neal. As the other colours are pernicious, we shall i not name the ingredients. Q 2

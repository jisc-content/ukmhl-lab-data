ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. 150 271. Angelica Comfits, Cut some fine stems of angelica into little rings, blanch them in hot water, throw them into cold water, drain them off, and put them into syrup; boil them till the syrup comes to the pearl; take them off on sieves to dry in the stove, minding to turn them from time to time, that they may not adhere to each other; when dry, put them into the comfit pan, and work them as the cinnamon comfits. 272. Lemon Comfits. Take some lemon peel, and clear it from the pith,, leaving only a thin rind, which you must cut into small threads like the cinnamon; blanch and pre- pare them as the angelica, and finish in the same manner.—Orange comfits the same. 273. Celery Comfits, Take half a pound of clean celery seeds, and put them in the pan placed on the barrel, and warmed by the chafing-dish ; pour some syrup on them, without the gum Senegal, working them with both hands; when they are large enough, put them in the stove for twenty-four or forty-eight hours, that they may be perfectly dry; put them back in the pan, give them eight charges of white syrup, to whiten them, taking care to dry them well each time, and then put them in the stove; the next day put them into the balancing pan, pour some syrup into the beading funnel boiled to slpearl. Continue and finish them in two days, as for the cinnamon. —(See No. 270.)

ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. 275 grey, so that it would be unfit for use; this paper is used to make borders^ &c., for the Assiettes Montees, 587. Gold Tamper. Dead gold is made in the same manner as the preceding, adding a little saffron to the paste. If you want gold papers of a large size, you must have a gilder^s cushion covered with leather, which is used to spread and cut the gold on with a straight and sharp knife. The gold is taken off with a brush made of squirreFs hair, broad and flat: gilders use this to apply the gold to the paper. You must not work where there is any current of air, as the gold would be rumpled, and rendered of no use. Burnished Gold Paper requires another prepara- tion. Apply the size (see No. 588) very even with a pencil (it is common to give it two coats of size); let it dry, and pin it at the corners on a piece of board the size of your paper; have near you a glass of clean water, wet the paper with a hair pencil, to the size of a gold leaf, apply it directly, and con- tinue the same till you have gilt your sheet of paper. When perfectly dry, rub it with a piece of cotton, to take off the edges, or overplus gold; if any place has not taken, you must wet it, and apply another piece of gold; let it dry, and take it from the board to burnish it. For this purpose, have a square piece of polished marble, lay your paper on it, and with a burnishing tool, a square stone flint, or agate, about two inches wide, bur- nish it, by holding, in both your hands, the long handle, which should reach to your right shoulder, and rubbing it backwards and forwards upon the paper.

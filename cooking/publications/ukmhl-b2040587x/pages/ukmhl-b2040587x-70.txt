Your sugar being ready^ take the pan from the fire, let it cool a little, then have a spoon, or two forks united, or a four-pronged tool—the prongs distant from each other three quarters of an ineh^ forming a cross; dip it in your sugar, try it by raising up some of it, and spin it by a shake of the hand; if the sugar forms threads easily, hold the mould in your left hand, the tool in the right, moving it backwards and forwards, spinning it in- side like silken threads, taking care to let none of it fall in drops, as it would spoil your work; your threads will be coarser if you use the coldest part of the sugar. Strengthen the inside with the sugar which falls on the outside; take the basket, or vase, ■ off the mould, while it is warm, and put it again, lightly into your mould to cool, and keep its shape; when cold, ornament it with various draperies^ gar- lands, and wreaths, of the same sugar, spun on the blade of a knife. Hold the knife in your left ; hand, and over the back of it spin some of the thickest threads, or you may likewise spin some on ] a napkin, or a tin plate; dispose them tastefully on ; your basket, make handles of the same sugar, twisted, or cast in leaden moulds (see No. 578), in i the shape of heads, feet, or any other ornament. • With spun sugar you may make every required ., ornament, temples, vases, ships, globes, covers for; vases, and even imitate horsehair on a helmet, &c. i 64.

ITALIAN CONFECTIONEK. 92 sugar used, the better^ for the preservation of the syrup depends on its quality^ and the degree of boiling. Some syrups will in time become mouldy, as that of mallows, which easily contracts a bad smell; this syrup requiring^ more than any other, to be boiled well; others, if done beyond a certain point, are subject to candy; it is therefore neces- sary to be particular, and not to bottle the syrup till quite cold; cork it well, and keep it in a dry place. 129. Orgeat Syrujo, 1 lb. of Sweet Almonds, 2 oz. of Bitter Almonds, 1 pint of Spring Water, 3 KÂ»s. of Sugar. Take a pound of sweet almonds, and two ounces of bitter almonds, and put them into boiling water; when the skin peels off easily, put them into cold Water; then pick and throw them into fresh water; when finished, put them into a marble mortar, very clean, and pound them with the juice of a lemon, adding, from time to time, half a pint of spring water. When completely pounded, so as to leave no bits of the almonds, mix the paste with another half-pint of water, strain it through a cloth, which must be twisted by two persons, and receive the milk of almonds in a basin. Put back the paste in the cloth into the mortar, pound it again with a little more water, and strain it, and add it to the others; clarify three pounds of sugar, boil it to a crack (see No. 11) ; take your pan from the fire to add the milk of almonds, put it on the fire again, give it a boil up, and take it oif: keep stirring it round with a spaddle, or skimmer, till it is cold, which will prevent its dividing when bottled, as I have seen it at many confectioners^ in London.

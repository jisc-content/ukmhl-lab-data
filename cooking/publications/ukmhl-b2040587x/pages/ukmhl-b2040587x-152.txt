146 ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. 262. Comfits in LiqtteurSu Take ten pounds of the kernels of apricots, or bitter almonds, and put them into hot water to open their pores, that the liqueur may penetrate; take them from the water and let them drain a few minutes : put into a jug the spirits you prefer, as maraschino, brandy, coffee, roses, orange-flower, &c. (see No. 27) ; this must be twenty-two or twenty- three degrees of strength, tempering them with water, that it may penetrate your almonds; infuse them in the spirit, cork the jug or pot well, to pre- vent evaporation, put it in a warm place for a fort- night; take out the almonds, and drain and dry them in the stove; when perfectly dry, make them in comfits, as described in the preceding article. 263. Almonds, with Vanilla, Are prepared in the same way as the others, adding^ when about half their size, in the process of cover- ing them with sugar, two ounces of good vanilla, pounded with sugar, and sifted through a silk sieve; mix this with the syrup intended to lay over them; it will be concealed by the white sugar when finished. 264. Almond Comfits, of various flavours, Rose and orange-flower almonds are made by clarifying the sugar with water distilled from those flowers : bergamot, jessamine, cedraty, orange, cin- namon, cloves, &c. &c., are made by adding essences to the syrup, with which you give the comfits the^ central layers.

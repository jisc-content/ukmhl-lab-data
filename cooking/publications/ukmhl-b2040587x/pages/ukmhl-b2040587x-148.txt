ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. 142 255. Elder-Flower Compote, Make a very strong decoction of elder-flowers, strain it through a silk sieve, and use it to boil some apples in (which you must have previously peeled^' and cut in small pieces), free from speck or blemish; stir them with your spaddle, and make them into a kind of apple paste, or marmalade, and add sugar to the reduced pulp. When of the proper con- sistence, put the marmalade into a silver compotier, and cover it with a stewing pan, upon the top of which you put some live coals, to give it a fine crust, without making it red hot, or burning it. This compote may be decorated with jellies of dif- ferent colours. 256. Compote of Orange Peel, Peel some fine China oranges, take ofi" the white or pith very clean, and cut the peels up as fine as vermicelli; blanch them, put them in a sieve to drain, then put them in syrup, and boil them up five or six times. 257. Orange Compote Is made without boiling the oranges; they are only to be peeled, cut in slices, the core taken out j add some syrup, or sugar in powder, and the juice of an orange. Some persons object to finding any part of the core; to prevent that, the inside of the- orange must be carefully separated in each division, taking ofi* the thin skins; place them in circles round your compotiers; add some pine-apple syrup> with a glass of rum; cover it with your apple jelljr as the other : this compote is much approved of.

145 ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. but do not moisten them too much^ as that would take off the gum. The syrup must then be added at six different times^ inereasmg the quantity each charge; the eighth time^ put half gum and half syrup; rub the almonds with your left hand to make them take equally^ and not stick to each other, and continue the same till your comfits are of the size you wish, sifting them every tenth charge, to take away the dust of the sugar which is formed in the pan; and if the pan becomes very rough, you must wash it. When the comfits are of a proper size, take them out of the pan on a sieve, and put them in the stove till the next day. Clarify, in spring water, some fine loaf-sugar, boil it to a strong tJiread, let the first charge have a little gum in it, giving twelve charges, adding like- wise to the eighth charge some gum Arabic, or Senegal; be careful to dry every charge well, that your almonds may be white, keeping only a mo- derate heat under the pan, as too much heat would spoil their whiteness. On the third day, take double-refined sugar, clarify, and boil it to the little j^earl; give the almonds ten charges, let each charge be less than the preceding one; and, to whiten 1 them, dry them for half an hour between each charge, shaking them very gently, and keeping them just warm; take them out, sift them, and put them in the stove till next day. On the fourth day, to smooth the comfits, take some of the whitest crystallized sugar, boiled to the little thread; give the comfits three charges, without fire under them; take care to work them longer than usual, put a gentle fire under them to dry them, and then put them in boxes.

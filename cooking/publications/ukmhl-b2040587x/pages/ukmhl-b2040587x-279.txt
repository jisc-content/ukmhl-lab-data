ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. 273 583. To maJce Pastehoard. All sorts of pasteboard may be had ready made; but for the confectioner^s use^ it may be readily manufactured with sheets of paper. Take fine white paper^ not stiffened (common paper will do for the inside), and place the sheet on a board, usin^ some of the paste described in No. 584, and making it thin with water, so as to use it like oil paint: then spread your paste on a sheet of white paper with a large brush, put over it another sheet of coarser paper, and a second or third, according to the strength you mean to give it, with a layer of paste between each sheet, and cover the top one with a sheet of fine paper. You should have paste- boards of every thickness, some even with fifteen sheets of paper, as some must be thin enough to turn, and others thick, to form the bottoms of your work. Press the sheets till the overplus of the paste is forced out, screw down the press and leave them for two days, till equally moistened through- out ; then hang them up with wire hooks, in any airy place, neither in the heat nor in the sun, and let them dry gradually ; when perfectly dried, they may be polished by a burnisher of flint, set in a long handle and fixed to the ceiling, the paper being placed on a polished stone table; if you can- not have a table, or regular burnisher, the rib of an ox, or the bottom of a glass bottle, will answer the same purpose. 584.

I trust, by these corrections, to prove my gratitude to the public for the favourable reception given to my work, and feel happy that, by my efforts, I leave to the world some testimony of a laborious life wholly devoted to my art, stimu- lated by a strong spirit of emulation, united with a desire to be useful. I conclude with observing that the art of the Confectioner is absolutely an art administering to pleasure and luxury, and that it requires times of prosperity and abundance,—times in which nobles live as nobles, and in which good taste and libe- rality walk hand in hand;—such times as existed under Louis the Fourteenth, and which reappeared for a short space when Prance saluted her Napoleon with the title of ^^the Great/^ It was at this epoch I was seized with so much enthusiasm for my profession, which I practised both in the household of the Emperor, and at the town ban- quets. In short, I leave the tribunal of posterity to pronounce judgment on my endeavours. May, 1843. W. A. Jarrin.

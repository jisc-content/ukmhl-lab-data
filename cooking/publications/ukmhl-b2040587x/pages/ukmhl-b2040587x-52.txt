ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. 46 21. North Pole Candy. Take the yolks of twelve fresh eggs, without any of the whites, beat them up in a small pan or basin with a spoon; pour in three glasses of maraschino, and stir the mixture till it comes to a cream. Have some clarified sugar boiled to a hlow ; take a funnel with a small bore, pour your composition into it, and let it run into the sugar as it boils, till it is all exhausted, turning your hand, that it may run all over the syrup. It will form a kind of yellow thread; take your pan from the fire, and with a fork take out the threads; put them on a grating, in little heaps, about the size of a half-crown, ando in the form of rocks; dry them for some hours in-; the stove, after which you candy them like the^, others, covering and finishing them as above men- tioned. They retain their moisture inside, of a beautiful yellow, well tasted, and it is difficult to , guess what they are made of. You may add a few pistachios, which, being cut very fine, and stuck in,- have a pretty effect. 22. A Nosegay in Candy, ^ Take young melons, about the size of an orangey cut them in slices, about a quarter of an inch thick, and peel them, taking care that the slices be round; avoid the inside, and make a complete circle. Put them into cold water ; blanch them like other fruit, > and put them again into cold water; when blanched, take them out; and when dried, put them into a ) pan, and pour over them a sufficient quantity of r clarified sugar to cover them. Your syrup must be light and lukewarm; put in a few cloves, nutmeg, ! and cinnamon, and, if you please, a little vinegar.

The spirits just described may be made accord* ing to the strength of the brandy used; but for a certain rule, notice, that when the least phlegm runs into the receiver, you must take it away, and leave off* distilling. The phlegm is easily known, as it is white, and one single drop would thicken the spirit, and give it a bad taste. You must also mind, that the spirit comes by a small streamlet or fillet; for if the fire be too strong, you will raise the phlegm along with the spirit; in this case, you must cohobate, that is, put back what you have received into the cucurbit and re-distil it; all these spirits are used for liqueur drops, conserves, ices, and all other articles in which liqueurs are intro- duced.

Cai! No.PREFACE TO THE FIEST EDITION. The art of the Confectioner^ in common with almost every other art^ has been greatly improved by the aid of modern Chemistry : the events of the French Revolution also, which deprived many in- genious men of their situations in noble families, and compelled them to seek a subsistence by lay- ing before the public the secrets of Confectionery, have done much towards the perfection of this agreeable art. The Confectioner is not without books which pretend to teach the principles of his profession; but these are, in general, more applicable to the theory than the practice of Confectionery, and most of them are very imperfect; some recent publica- tions being totally silent on matters of the first importance. There is not, indeed, any treatise in the English language which can be of essential use to the Confectioner. The Author, therefore, after many years' successful practice of his art, ven- tures to present his Italian Conpectioner to the public, in the full confidence that it will not only supply the defects of former treatises, but will be a2iv PREFACE TO THE FIEST EDITION. found to contain every important particular which relates to^ or is connected with Confectionery; including a variety of articles entirely new^ and describing processes little^ if at all^ known in Eng- land. The work is divided into Sections, and treats at large of Sugae, and the manner of preparing it; of the numerous Candies, and Bon-BonSj as they are made in France; of the Imitation of Vege- tables^ Fruits^ and other natural objects in Sugar, and of a great variety of drops, prawlings, &c. &c.; of the best mode of preparing Chocolate and Cocoa; of Syrups, Jams_, Marmalades, Jellies, Fruit, and other Pastes, and of Preserved Fruits, including directions for Preserving Fruit without sugar, according to the method of M. Appert; with hints respecting the construction of Ovens and Stoves, and a Table of the various degrees of heat adapted to the different articles of Confec- tionery. The Italian Coneectioner will also be found to contain receipts to make Tablets and Rock Sugar; the various Comjjotes; the French method of preparing Comfits ; the best manner of making Creams and Ices, with some important hints re- specting the latter, upon which their excellence entirely depends; how to preserve Fruits in Brandy; to make and arrange Pieces Montees, Confectionery Paste, and the mode of producing Picturesque Scenery, with trees, lakes, rocks, &c.; LozengesPREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION. V and Jellies; Cool Drinks for balls and routs; Cakes, Wafers, Biscuits (particularly those of Italy) ^ rich Cakes, Biscotini, Macaroons, &c. The Section on Distillation includes Distilled Waters^ Liqueurs composed of Spirits^ and Eata- PIAS of all kinds. That part of the Work which regards the Decoration oe the Table^ necessarily treats of the articles which compose the various ornaments used for this purpose; as G^m Paste, and the most approved mode of Modelling Flowers^ Animals, Figures^ &c.; of Colours for Confectionery, with full instructions how to pre- pare them ; of Varnishing and Gilding; of Mould- ing, with directions to enable every Confectioner to make his own moulds; of JForhs in Fastehoard, Gold and Silver Papers, Borders, &c. &c.; and, to complete the whole, and render the Confectioner independent of every other artist, the manner of Engraving on Steel, and on Wood, is fully ex- plained. The various arts of Drawing, Modelling, En- graving, CJarving, Moulding, and many other pur- suits, usually considered foreign to the practice of the Confectioner, have been closely studied by the Author for many years; and the very numerous processes described in his Work (many of which he invented) have all been employed by him with the most complete success. The Plates, it is hoped, will be found useful.— Many of the tools and implements describedvi PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION. W. A. J. were invented or improved by the writer; and he can safely recommend them, from long experience of their utility in his own practice. In offering his first production to the public, the Author feels the diffidence natural to a new attempt. His object has been to produce a useful, rather than a large volume; and, wherever the subject admitted it, he has, as much as possible, compressed his materials. In describing the mi- nulise of various processes used in his art (however familiar to himself in practice), he fears he may not always have succeeded in conveying his ideas so clearly as might be desired; but the difficulty of explaining, by words alone, the most trifling manual operation, is so well known to all who have made the experiment, that he solicits and relies upon the indulgence of the liberal critic for any deficiencies that may be found in this depart- ment of his work; and generally, for any other defects, which he is apprehensive may have oc- curred, from writing in a language not native to him.TO THE READER. It was in May, 1820, that I gave to the Public the first edition of the Italian Confectionee. Since then, twenty-three years of unceasing prac- tice have induced me to reflect on the difficulties of a part of my work, which might perhaps not be easily executed, or understood, arising from the large quantities of materials prescribed for each preparation, which are generally too much for the House Confectioner, and so expensive as to alarm those who have not intelligence enough to reduce the quantity prescribed in proportion to their daily wants and the means of their employers. I have remedied these defects by reducing the re- ceipts; I have endeavoured to make them more intelligible; have corrected the errors; and have augmented this edition by adding a great number of receipts to each section; and more particularly the new discoveries in Bon-bons h Liqueurs, &c. I am thankful that my life has been prolonged so as to enable me to make these corrections, and thus leave to the world a work which cannot vary for many centuries to come; because the generalviii TO THE READEE. principles will always be the same^—the descrip- tion of any particular art being nothing more than the history of what is practised; or^ if I may so express it, the map of what exists, raising all in- telligent artists to the same degree of knowledge; and a kind of lighthouse to guide the young be- ginner. I trust, by these corrections, to prove my gratitude to the public for the favourable reception given to my work, and feel happy that, by my efforts, I leave to the world some testimony of a laborious life wholly devoted to my art, stimu- lated by a strong spirit of emulation, united with a desire to be useful. I conclude with observing that the art of the Confectioner is absolutely an art administering to pleasure and luxury, and that it requires times of prosperity and abundance,—times in which nobles live as nobles, and in which good taste and libe- rality walk hand in hand;—such times as existed under Louis the Fourteenth, and which reappeared for a short space when Prance saluted her Napoleon with the title of ^^the Great/^ It was at this epoch I was seized with so much enthusiasm for my profession, which I practised both in the household of the Emperor, and at the town ban- quets. In short, I leave the tribunal of posterity to pronounce judgment on my endeavours. May, 1843. W. A. Jarrin.DESCRIPTION OF THE PLATES, PLATE 1. Figure 1.—A copper boiler, fixed in brick and mortar, to clarify sugar in large quantities, with a cock at the bottom, to draw off the clarified syrup.—See page 35. Figure 2.—A cloth strainer, or flannel bag, to strain the sugar when clarified and reduced to syrup, and conduct it into the reservoir, which is of copper; with a cock at the bottom, to draw off the syrup as wanted.—See page 36, No. 2. Figure 3.—A round mould for sugar candy, in which a number of small holes are bored, for the purpose of stretch- ing threads across, that the candy may fix to them, as ex- plained in page 41, No. 13 : this mould may be either of cop- per or tin; its size in proportion to the quantity of sugar candy required. Figure 4.—A box of tin, to receive the wire-work gratings. No. 4, in order to dry and drain off candied fruits ; the box must have a hole, and small pipe, at one corner, that the extra syrup may pass off; it must be tightly corked during the work.—See page 42, No. 16. Figure 5.—A box, twelve inches long, eight inches wide, and two inches deep, with a hole and pipe at one corner to drain off syrup; this box is to be placed in the stove, or cup-X DESCRIPTION OF THE PLATES. board, fig. 6, and is used to dry meteors, liqueur rings, and every candy, as directed at page 44, JTo. 17. Figure 6.—A stove, or cupboard, made of iron, contain- ing nine cases, on three shelves, which, by means of pivots placed on the outside of the cupboard, may be moved in a slanting direction, to let the syrup flow off: these shelves are kept in the position required, by pins adapted to small square holes in a quarter circle; near the bottom there must be a sort of basin, formed like a funnel, to receive the drainings of the nine boxes, and conduct it into a pan at the bottom of the stove. The cupboard receives heat, which may be carried to 140 degrees, by a single pipe fixed to a stove in the laboratory, whose smoke is carried into a chimney near at hand; the heat may be applied according to the situation, observing that it should always proceed from the bottom of the stove. When the cupboard is shut, it shows a circular opening, which may be closed at pleasure, to evaporate the heat when in excess; on the opening is a dial, to mark the hour when the candy is put in the stove, and the time when it should be withdrawn, in order to secure exactness in the process. This stove" was invented by the Author ; it is extremely convenient, and he uses it with complete success.—See page 48, No. 25.—Ligueur Rings in Candy, Figure 7.—A frame, twelve inches square, made of tin, divided into small squares, used for cutting out barley-sugar tablets.—See page 54, No. 37. These squares vary in shape, according to the size you would have your tablets. Figure 8.—A copper funnel, which must be provided with a stick to fit the aperture, moveable at will: it is an imple- ment of the greatest utility, and was invented by the Author for Liqueur Drops, and various other articles.—See page 74, No. 79. Figure 9.—A funnel with a screw, without which it would be impossible to make the little jewel drops (page 77, No. 83) uniform, and perfect in shape and size. The Author in- vented this tool, and the frame which receives the drops,DESCRIPTION OF THE PLATES. xi both of which he finds of the utmost service for various pur- poses.—See page 77, No. 83. Figure 10.—A box-wood mould, of which the hollow is intended to receive a paper cat round, which the pressure at the top compels to take the form of a ring; it is used for liqueur rings.—See page 77, No. 84, Mgure 11.—A stewpan used in making drops, to warm the paste, and run it on the marble slab.—See page 80, No. 90. Figure 12.—A spatula, or spaddle; this is a much more proper tool for a confectioner than the wooden spoon gene- rally used; it saves sugar, and performs its ofiice more effec- tually : the Author can safely recommend the adoption of it. —See page 198, No. 399, &c. Figure 13.—A stone slab for making chocolate, thirty inches long, eighteen wide; hollow in the inside, to contain a chafing-dish to warm the stone: the roller is of polished iron. The stone should be of a fine texture, and very smooth. —See page 88, No. 121. Figure 14.—A tin mould to form the chocolate into half- pound cakes: the stripes inside are relieved, which forms the hollow marks on the chocolate, each square being the quantity sufficient for a cup.—See page 88, No. 121. Figure 15.—A tin mould for forming mushrooms, or champignons, in rock sugar, made to open in two pieces, and held together with a hinge; they should be provided of diflFerent sizes.—See Mushroom in Roch Sugar, page 133, No. 229. Figure 16.—A tin funnel, containing a paste sufficiently liquid to run without pressure by its own weight; used to form the patience biscuits, as described in page 198, No. 399. Figure 17.—A funnel with four holes, or pipes, used for Savoy biscuits only.—See page 201, No. 406.xii DESCRIPTION OF THE PLATES. Figure 18.—A mould of box-wood, intended to give paper the form of a small basket: the paper, being pressed into the hollow, takes the shape required, as explained in page 202, No. 408. PLATE IT. Figure 1.—A tin syringe, or cylinder, into which almond paste is put, and, being forced through by the handle, takes the shape of a star, or any other form you may choose to place at the aperture: this tool is used for making syringe biscuits.—See page 223, ISTo. 457. Figure 2.—A balancing pan, in copper, used for making comfits ; the sides must be rounded, and it has two handles on the sides, and one in the centre, which serve to shake it when at work; inside the two lateral handles are eyes of iron, which receive two S S, to which hang chains or cords, fixed over a bar of iron or wood, placed horizontally, to balance the pan on the bar; the bar must be fixed in the centre to another S, and a hook secured in the ceiling of the room; in the centre is represented a funnel used to pearl the comfits ; it is made like that described in plate I. fig. 9. The little dish at the bottom is of iron, and contains fire to dry the comfits.—See page 143, J^o. 260.-0/ Comfits. Figure 3.—A screw press, to press gum-dragon, and suit- able for different purposes: it is of wood; the cylinder, pierced with small holes, is copper, of a good thickness ; the press must be fixed to a wall in the laboratory, to obtain sufficient strength to tighten the vice or screw; the prepared gum is to be enclosed in a linen bag contained within the cylinder.—See page 249, No. 528. Figure 4.—A piece of boxwood, engraved to resemble the shell and kernel of a walnut; this is used to push fancy bis- cuits in.—See page 224, No. 458.DESGEIPTION OF THE PLATES. XIU Figure 5.—An iron tool to make wafers ; the ring at the top is to keep the iron closed when not in n,se; when you put it away, be careful to put a piece of whited-brown paper in it, to prevent the blades from rusting. Its use is described in page 193, No. 388. Figure 6,—Position of the hands when flattening and modelling a rose leaf with a tool of ivory, to which is affixed two little balls.—See page 251, No. 534. Figure 7.—A table, with apparatus for modelling flowers : to the two iron uprights are fixed cross wires to hook the flowers on as they are finished, in order to dry them ; on the table is a tin cutting tool to form the leaf; a square mould in wood, in which is engraved the calyx of the flower; on the right is an ivory tool, used to stripe the carnation leaf, &c.— Seepages 251, 252, Nos. 534, 535. Figure 8.—A mould in lead for ice fruits; it must have a hinge : for the manner of using it, and its use, see page 170, No. 339. Figure 9.—A tub, containing the freezing pot for ices; described in page 159, No. 298. Figure 10.—A quill, notched at the point as the teeth of a saw, used in modelling paste, to produce the frizzled appear- ance of the wool of the lamb.—See page 259, No. 553. Figure 11.—A piece of wood, to turn small horns upon : and one of them complete, as a model. The use of this tool is explained in page 254, No. 540.

Figure 13.—A large square and a small one, to show the mode of reducing a large drawing to any smaller dimension you may require.—See page 258, No. 551. Figure 14.—A block of wood, hollowed out in the centre, containing the tool for cutting out borders of paper; thexiv DESCRIPTION OF THE PLATES. cutter is confined by a screw, which keeps it in its place; upon this the gilt, or any other paper, is placed, and being struck with the hammer, which is of lead, takes an impression, and is cut out.—See page 277, No. 591, and page 284, No. 598. Figure 15.—A draw bench, to make English gilt paper borders ; this implement is of iron, and must be fixed to a table. The mode of using it is minutely described in page 278, No. 592. Figure 16.—A wheel made of walnut tree, two inches thick and eighteen inches in diameter, used for engraving figures in wood. The mode of using it is minutely explained under that head.—See page 286, No. 599. Figure 17.—Engraving tools of steel, four or five inches long: they are of various patterns, and used in engraving wood.—See that article, page 286, No. 599. Figure 18.—A still, fixed on its stove, in the act of dis- tilling ; the recipient should be supported on a mattress of straw, which is omitted in the plate.—See Distillation, page 235, No 483. Figure 19.—An ornament, or assiette montee, finished, and prepared to receive sweetmeats on the tambour, or pe- destal, at bottom, which is formed of pasteboard: it is to be sent up on a dish, and arranged on the table, with its accom- paniments.—See the Description, page 279, No. 594.ON DESSERTS AND BILLS OF FARE. It is very seldom the Bill of Fare is required of the confectioner, except on any great occasion; but the following is the general rule : for instance,, for thirty persons, there should be thirty-two dishes, divided in four parts: fruit, biscuits, compotes, assiette montee, or dressing plates, with sweets and bon-bons; the eight compotes should be four white and four coloured; the eight biscuits should be four fancy and four plain, of different sorts; the eight fruits, four in baskets, mixed with pine ap- ples at the top, ingeniously dressed, placed at the top and bottom, and in the centre of the two flanks of the table; the four other fruits to be dressed, each sort separate, cherries and strawberries in pyramid ; observing that, if possible, every dish should be raised seven or eight inches with socles, baskets, or any other ornament. An ingenious confectioner should always make those things him- self. We owe to the ignorance of some, the intro- duction of china and bronze, which are extremely heavy, and cannot be varied in appearance. The ices and wafers are not any longer placed on the table, but passed round to the company as soon as the dessert is arranged on the table. The ices should be made in small shapes only, sufficientxvi ON DESSERTS AND BILLS OF FARE. for one person; tliey should be prettily dressed up in a round dish^ over a table napkin nicely folded. . If you wish to distinguish yourself^ make a socle or basket, which -you can accomplish by pouring some water in a copper or tin mould, and leaving it over some rough ice mixed with salt; in a very few hours it will be frozen to a solid body; it is very pretty in different colours, and may be ob- tained by first putting clear water at the bottom of your mould : when that is frozen, pour in one inch of water coloured with cochineal; when that is congealed, put water in again, and so on till your mould is filled. It is extremely pretty if you introduce fresh flowers and green leaves in your moulds filled with spring-water; when it is frozen in a solid mass, turn it out, and you will have a beautiful basket, as if it was in crystal: put that basket over the napkin, fill the basket with your ices, made in the shape of different fruits, and paint them according to nature. See Ices in Fruit Shapes, No. 339.—Observe, not to fill your dishes too full; it is bad taste, and very awkward to serve.BILLS OF PARE FOR DESSERTS, No. I.

As fine a syrup may be obtained from the common as from the double- refined loaf-sugar, if it be clarified in the same manner as moist sugar. This may be done with less trouble than with the whites of eggs only, if the apparatus be used which is described in jplate I. jig, 1. This consists of a boiler, with a cock at the bottom, which serves to convey the syrup into the strainer, or woollen bag, and thence into the reser-? voir. After withdrawing the first produce, which is black, and putting it again into the boiler, the syrup, which continues to flow after the deposit is formed in the strainer, will be very clear and fine in the reservoir. This done, put boiling water into the boiler, and closing the reservoir, receive the water, which carries with it the particles of sugar attached to the charcoal. This may be used again, or you may evaporate it by ebullition, and return it into the consistence of syrup, to be added c2ITALIAN CONFECTIONEE. S6 to the mass. There is a great variety in the qualities of different sugars ; they do not all give the same result when worked: some sugar appears not near the crach^ if you judge by the boiling only ; there- fore be careful, for it may burn in an instant^ and adopt the means prescribed [Caramel, No. 12), to prevent its graining, as there are twenty ways to grease it^ but not one to make it grain when it is greasy. Sugar will not ferment, nor be fermented, without yeast; being dissolved in four times its weight of water, that is, four pounds of water to \ one of sugar. When once the fermentation begins, \ it continues to the end. 2. To clarify Loaf-Sugar, ■ Break the sugar you want into a copper pan^ ] which will hold a third more than the required quantity; put about half a pint of water to every, pound of sugar, and beat up some whites of eggs ^ with it: one is sufficient for six pounds of sugar (some confectioners put the yolk and shells with i the whites crusted together, but this only adds to ' the scum) : put it on the fire, and when it rises in ] boiling, throw in a little cold water, which must, always be kept at hand in a basin, in case the sugar , should rise rapidly and boil over. Let it rise three • times without skimming it; the fourth time skim i it well, throwing in a little cold water each time, till the white scum ceases to rise; then strain it through a sieve, cloth strainer, or flannel bag.— {See plate I. j%. 2.) Save the scum for use. When ' a certain quantity of scum is taken off, it may he\ clarified; the latter skimming may be reserved, to add to fermented wines.ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. 37 3. To clarify coarse hrown Sugar, Take as much brown sugar as you wish to clarify (suppose fifty pounds) ; put it into a pan that will contain a third more than the required quantity, and pour in about twenty pints of water, first well mixed with five whites of eggs. Take five pounds of small branch charcoal, pound it very fine, mix it in the copper pan while on the fire, and let it boil; it will look as black as ink. If it rises too fast, add cold water; strain it through a bag : at first it will be black, but continue to strain it till quite clear, which will be readily seen by receiving the syrup in a glass. It must be repeatedly put back again, till it comes out as fine as clarified loaf- sugar. 4. A new method of clarifying Sugar to an extreme whiteness, not to he equalled, fit for Liqueur JDrojos, Bon-bons, and Objects extremely White, Take a loaf of fine white crystallized sugar (sup- pose ten pounds) \ break it in pieces, and put it in a pan with two quarts of water, in which beat up one pound of ivory black, and two whites of eggs whipped-up ; melt it on a moderate heat, and take care your sugar does not boil; add a little cold water occasionally, to prevent ebullition; when the whole is well melted, put in half a wine-glass of white vinegar, distilled from wood; pass it through a flannel bag: at first it will run quite black, but by returning it for a time back into the bag, it will at length become as clear as spring water. This syrup is kept for the most delicate sort of work. The black that remains attached to the bag con- tains a great deal of sugar, which, if dissolved in a38 ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. quantity of water, will serve for another clarifica- tion. If you wish to know the exact quantity of sugar the water contains, I strongly recommend you to use the saccharometer, or the syrap-weigher. The Saccharometer,—This instrument is in glass, containing quicksilver, as the barometer, divided into degrees or scales. When immersed in pure water, it marks Zero, which proves that the water contains no sugar. The advantages of the saccharo- meter are immense, not only as a matter of economy, but as a guide to the workman, who cannot work with certainty without knowing the degrees of boiling, which can only be learned by practice. For example : the thread, large or small^ the saccharometer marks twenty-five degrees; the pearl, thirty degrees; the blow, thirty-four de- grees ; the feather, thirty-six degrees; the ball_, fifty degrees; study the degrees of boiling sugar as described below, and compare it with the saccharometer. This instrument can be obtained of the author. 5. Degree of hoiling the Sugar. Confectioners, in general, have seven essential degrees of boiling sugar, or bases of their art: ]. Lelisse, or thread, large or small;—2. LejoerUy or pearl;—8. Le soujfflet, the blow ;—4. La plume, the feather;—5. Le houlet, the ball, large or small; —6. Le casse, the crack; and, 7. The caramel. 6. A Thread. Dip the tip of your fore-finger into the syrup, and apply it to your thumb; on parting them, you will lind a thread, which will break at a little dis-ITALIAN CONFECTIONEB. 39 tance^ and remain as a drop on the finger: this is the small thread ; if the thread be longer, it is the great thread, 7. A Pearl. When you separate your thumb and finger, and the thread reaches, without breaking, from one to the other, it is the small pearl; if the finger and thumb be stretched to their utmost extent, and the thread remain unbroken, it is the large pearl: this may also be known by the bubbles on the boiling sugar, which are round and raised; but this test is not always sure. 8. A Blow May be known by dipping the skimmer into the sugar, shaking it, and blowing through the holes : if, in doing this, sparks of light, or bubbles be seen, we may be sure of the blow, 9, A Feather. The larger and greater quantity of bubbles, when blown through the skimmer, are the large feather, 10. A Ball. Dip your finger into a glass of cold water, then into your sugar, and into the water again; if you make your sugar into a small ball, it is the small lall; when larger and harder, it is the great hall, 11. A CracJc, Dip the same finger into the sugar, and on taking it out, if the sugar that adheres to it breaks in your finger, with a slight noise, and does not stick to the tooth, it is a crack. Boil it again; and40 ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. if it break on plunging your finger into the water, it is the great crack: you must be very attentive, for it passes rapidly to caramel^ and will burn^ if not attended to^ in a minute. 12. A Caramel, It breaks^ as just observed^ making a noise like glass. When the sugar is at the crack, add to it five or six drops of lemon-juice^ to prevent its grain- ing. When boiled, take it from the fire, and put the bottom of the pan into cold water, to prevent its burning. The production of caramel is attended with some difficulty, and great attention is neces- sary. As we can see in a moment the colour of caramel we wish to obtain, we must use the lemon- juice cautiously, as too large a quantity would spoil the sugar. If no lemon-juice be at hand, a few drops of vinegar, honey, or butter—any acid or grease will smooth the sugar, which is naturally disposed to grain. As the sugar has no longer any i moisture, it requires a strong fire; but this must be applied to the body of the sugar only; for, if the fire be too fierce, it will burn the sugar to the sides of the pan, which will completely spoil it. The edges of the pan must be kept clean with a small sponge. The sugar in boiling throws bubbles to the sides of the pan, which adhere to it, and become white; this must be removed immediately with a small sponge dipped in cold water, which must be kept at hand, to keep the pan constantly clean, or the sugar will grain, and entirely spoil.41 ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. SECTION II. Of Candies, dec. 13. Sugar Candy, Candy is crystallized sugar_, congealed and dried into small shining particles. To make sugar candy, you must have a copper or tin mouldy of a some- what conical shape, pierced with holes to receive the threads which must be fastened in.— (See ^late l.fig, 3.) The outside must be covered with double paper, pasted on close, to prevent the sugar from running through, and the mould must be perfectly dry. Have a stove heated to a moderate heat (see No. 220), and when ready, proceed as follows. 14. Production of Candy, Put into a pan syrup enough, that is, clarified sugar (see No. 2), to fill your moulds; place the pan on a brisk fire, till the syrup comes to the small feather (see No. 9) ; skim it well, take the pan from the fire, and pour into it a small quantity of spirits of wine. If you wish it to sparkle, let it rest till you see a small skin on its surface, which is candy; take it ofi* with a skimmer, or slice, and pour it directly into the mould, which you must place in your stove, the heat of which must be kept at the same degree as described in No. 220, for eight days. You must then drain the candy, by making a hole, and slanting the mould on a basin or pan to receive the drainings ; let it drain twelve hours, till it is perfectly dry, then loosen the paper, by moistening it with warm water; put it near the fire, warm it all round, and turn out the candy.42 ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. by striking it hard on the table. Put the candy on a sieve in the stove to finish drying it^ but you must neither touch nor move the candy while in the stove^ and an equal heat must be kept up; for without attending to these precau- tions^ there would be a mash, instead of a candied sugar. Spirits of wine serve to take off the grease, and do not affect the candy, as they soon evaporate : the candy may be made of any colour, by grinding the particular colour in spirits of wine, and adding it as the sugar feathers, 15. Mowers in Candy, Candied flowers, no longer in fashion, are thus made : pull the flowers to pieces, leaf by leaf, either orange, violet, jonquil, rose, carnation, &c.; weigh three pounds of flowers, and then take six pounds of clarified sugar, boiling it to a hloio (see No. 8) ; throw in your flowers, take off your pan from the fire, let it rest a quarter of a hour, that the flowers may lose their moisture; replace the pan on the fire, and let the sugar boil till it comes to a hlow ; then immediately pour the contents of the pan into a candy mould, fill it with half sugar and half flowers, and put them into the stove, moderately heated (see No. 220) ; leave it twenty-four hours, then make a hole in the sugar, drain and finish it, as in No. 14 : it may be cut in any shape, accord- ing to fancy. 16. Fruit in Candy, Green apricots, ripe apricots in halves, apricots stuck with green almonds, greengages, mirabelles, barberries in bunches, cherries, angelica, orange, or any other fruit, being previously preserved in syrup.43 ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. strained^ and passed through warm water^ to take off the sugar that adheres to them, which is always greasy, and would prevent them from drying or candying; apple pastes and other pulpy fruit, cin- namon drops, paste of almonds; every dry fruit or paste, may be candied. Examine first the fruit you intend to candy, one by one, and prepare them as above : they must be quite dry; then take a nearly square mould, broader at the top than at the bottom, with wire gratings {see plate \*fig* 4), and place each article, side by side, on the first grating, nearly at the bottom of the mould, so that one does not touch the other. The first sort being thus arranged, take the second, and placing it on the fruit of the first, cover it in like manner; continue thus to the last, which you must cover with a grating, on which place an iron or leaden weight, to fix the whole, and keep it firm; then place your mould or box in the stove, in a moderate heat (see No. 220); take and boil a sufficient quantity of clarified sugar, to fill up the remaining vacancy in the mould ; take the sugar off* as soon as it comes to the little blow (see No. 8) ; let it cool; take off*, with your skimmer, the little candy formed on it in cooling; pour it into the mould, let it candy without touching it, keeping it an equal heat for ten or twelve hours; then strain it, by uncork- ing the mould, and slanting it towards a bowl placed to receive the waste syrup. If you .wish to ascertain the size of the grain of the candy, place in the four corners of the mould a small piece of whisk; when you draw one out, after ten hours, you may judge by the three others, which you with- draw every hour, of its consistence; let it drain well, and turning it over, let it dry; when it isITALIAN CONFECTIONER. perfectly dry, turn it over, and striking it on a table prepared with paper to receive it, take out your gratings, and carefully take off the candied fruit, one after another; cinnamon must be steeped in spirits of wine or brandy, or you will not be able to cut it; besides, it opens the pores of the cinna- mon, and facilitates the entrance of the sugar in which it must be first prepared.—(See the article Cinnamon,) 17. Meteors in Candy, Make meteors of different colours (see Meteors); put the halves together perfectly dry, and have several moulds made, as that represented in plate I. fig, 5. Boil some clarified sugar to the little blow (see No. 8), put about half an inch in depth of sugar in each mould, place over the syrup in your moulds, your meteors, side by side, and let them touch each other; all your moulds being thus filled, put them in a hot stove (see No. 220) for about an hour, or an hour and a half. You will then find your meteors fixed in a crust made by the sugar; this crust must be rather strong; boil to the feather (see No. 9) some of the same clarified sugar; take a small flat ladle, put the syrup in it, and gradually cover the meteors with it, by pouring it over them, as a cook bastes a joint of meat. When the meteors are well covered with sugar, leave them three hours more in the stove ; take out the corks of the moulds, and let them drain; when quite dry, turn them out on a table, like the other candies, by striking hard on the pans. 18. Grapes in Candy. Prepare your moulds, as for the meteors, and fill them more than half full of syrup, boiled to the45 ITALIAN CONFECTIONEE. small How (see No. 8) ; take your liqueur drops or grapes (see Liqueur Dro^s), by handfuls, well mixed in colours^ and put them in the moulds_, in heaps^ pressed down to the bottom. Your moulds thus filled^ put them in the stove; in an hour^s time^ cover them with fresh syrup, boiled to the feather (see No. 9) ; three hours afterwards^ strain off the syrup as before; when quite dry, turn them out on a table, and separate them with your hand, for they will be in a lump. This candy is very pretty. 19. French Rihhon in Candy. With this article may be formed ribbons, small wreaths, knots, lyres, and other little ornaments, which you may candy in the same manner as the meteors.—(See the article French Bibhon,) 20. Orange Candy. Choose six large and fine Malta oranges, blanch them like any other fruit, dip them in clean water, cut them into slices crossways, neither too thick nor too thin, and put them, as you cut them, into syrup, which must be lukewarm; you must put your syrup on the fire three days running; strain it from the slices, and boil it a few minutes each time: the fourth day, boil the syrup to a hlow (see No. 8) ; throw in your slices of orange, cover them, and boil up once; take them out, put them on gratings to dry; and when the surface is dry, take them out, and candy them like the meteor. To take them from the candy mould, you must wait till they are quite dry and cold, as the slice of fruit being moist within, the candy would easily drop off.ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. 46 21. North Pole Candy. Take the yolks of twelve fresh eggs, without any of the whites, beat them up in a small pan or basin with a spoon; pour in three glasses of maraschino, and stir the mixture till it comes to a cream. Have some clarified sugar boiled to a hlow ; take a funnel with a small bore, pour your composition into it, and let it run into the sugar as it boils, till it is all exhausted, turning your hand, that it may run all over the syrup. It will form a kind of yellow thread; take your pan from the fire, and with a fork take out the threads; put them on a grating, in little heaps, about the size of a half-crown, ando in the form of rocks; dry them for some hours in-; the stove, after which you candy them like the^, others, covering and finishing them as above men- tioned. They retain their moisture inside, of a beautiful yellow, well tasted, and it is difficult to , guess what they are made of. You may add a few pistachios, which, being cut very fine, and stuck in,- have a pretty effect. 22. A Nosegay in Candy, ^ Take young melons, about the size of an orangey cut them in slices, about a quarter of an inch thick, and peel them, taking care that the slices be round; avoid the inside, and make a complete circle. Put them into cold water ; blanch them like other fruit, > and put them again into cold water; when blanched, take them out; and when dried, put them into a ) pan, and pour over them a sufficient quantity of r clarified sugar to cover them. Your syrup must be light and lukewarm; put in a few cloves, nutmeg, ! and cinnamon, and, if you please, a little vinegar.ITALIAN CONFECTIONEE. 47 as the melon is extremely insipid. Drain them for five days, and put your syrup daily to boil, and skim it; the sixth day boil your syrup to a hlom (see No. 8);, put in your slices by sliding them in; let them boil over; take your pan from the fire, and with a fork put them in order on your gratings, taking care to turn them when the surface is dry. Candy them as follows (they should be as trans- parent as apple jelly) : take your candy moulds, pre- pared and filled with syrup as for the meteors, and the same degree of boiling; place your slices of melon side by side, and let them touch each other; get some liqueur drops, of different colours, forming roses and other flowers (you must even use the pencil), small bits of sugar, grains of gum paste, pistachios shred, small threads of angelica, of cinnamon, and vanilla, extremely fine; all these small articles must form little nosegays, by placing them in the centres of each circle of melon, on the prepared syrup. You may have small knots of ribbon (made in a mould, engraved on wood) to form the nosegay, and tie it; thus prepared, put them into the stove, and finish, like the other candies: you will have the prettiest candy possible, j 23. Imitation of Slices of Orange or Lemon. Make the circle in gum paste, made entirely in sugar; fix them on a sheet of paper near each other, this is done with thin gum Arabic; let them dry; fill the circles with syrup boiled to the hloWy very white and transparent, with a taste of lemon ! or orange. Let them candy in the stove for twelve hours; then take them off the paper, by wetting the back with a camers-hair pencil dipped in water*ITALIAN CONFECTIONEK. 48 Paint them to imitate the slices of the fruity with flake white diluted in gum Arabic^ and the skin with saffron. , 24. Imitation of Floivers, Formerly all sorts of flowers were made with printed models^ representing each natural flower, painted and mounted on wire^ but they are now better imitated^ by boiling sugar to the great ball (see No. l^j page 39). It must be used the moment it comes to this degree of boiling. Take a small quantity of fine powdered sugar^ sift it thinly over a piece of marble,, slightly oiled^ run your syrup over that very thin; then take tin cutters representing the leaves of flowers^ cut out the sugar, and mount it, as if by a clever florist. When your flower is formed, dip it in powdered starch, that it may keep its shape till it becomes quite hard. After being dried twelve hours in the stove, blow off* the powder attached to it; paint them according to nature. Bouquets thus made, if cleverly executed, are really admirable. 25. Liqueur Rings in Candy, Take your rings, made as directed in the article No. 83 [Liqueur Rings), and candy them like the meteors, being covered and finished in the same manner. This article must be prepared with the penknife, with which cut out the candy from the centre, that it may form a ring; or you may make small lozenges, oval stars, &c. It is difficult to make a large quantity without some of the rings being touched by the droppings, which prevents them from shining. The author has constructed a stove on purpose^ with boxes, as for the meteors, r—(See plate I. fig, 6.) The twelve boxes being49 .ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. placed in the stove^ need not be moved till ready to be taken out when dry : the racks on which they are fixed turn with an almost imperceptible motion: and the syrup drips slowly and equally^ without fear of shaking, or other accident. This method is for those who manufacture in large quantities: one box is sufficient for the con- sumption of any private family : this may be easily managed by raising the box gently with a support behind. 26. Millefmit Candi/, Make a paste, of gum paste of different (deep) (Colours, scents, and tastes, and form them into grains, in the shape of oats. When dry, and mixed of all colours, prepare your candy moulds with syrup, of half an inch in depth, and boiled to a blow (see No. 8), as for candies in general; then take your grains by the handful, sprinkle them over the syrup, so as to cover it; put your box in the stove, cover them with syrup, as before mentioned, and finish them in the same manner. This candy may be made with pastilles on a sieve.— (See the article Pastilles,) 27. Harlequin Candy, Choose some fine almonds, blanch them by put- ting them into boiling water, wherein let them re- main till you perceive the skins come off freely; and as you blanch them, throw them into a pan con- \ taining some fresh water; when finished, drain and wipe them well in a cloth; cut them in two or three slices, lengthways; then put a pound of clarified sugar on the fire to every pound of almonds; I reduce it to 2^ feather; at this degree, throw in your50 ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. almonds, and let the whole boil till your sugar is reduced to a crack; then withdraw quickly your pan from the fire, and with your spattles move them about, to prawline them; by this operation, the sugar clings round the almonds : then sift them, to take away the sugar which does not adhere; separate them in as many parts as you wish to obtain colours. Take care to colour them lightly; and when dry, candy them in the same way as the millefruit candy : they are used to ornament plates, and are pleasing to the eye and to the taste. 28. Holland Candy, Holland candy contains something of all sorts ; as pieces of angelica, cinnamon, almonds of all colours, held together as in the preceding article. 29. Chocolate Candy, Boil your syrup to a feather (see No. 9), and pour it into your boxes as usual; let it form a little crust; put in gently the articles previously shaped in chocolate, and push them under with your finger. This chocolate is made in the same manner as for chocolate dro^s. No. 122; you may form rings, hearts, lozenges, long canes, drops, stars, and any other shape which your ingenuity may invent, and the chocolate will take. Cover and finish them as directed in the other candies, except that, when drained and dry, you must take your boxes from the stove, and let them cool, as the chocolate re- mains in a liquid state for a considerable time. 30. Jelly in Candy. This is not only pleasing to the eye, but very agreeable to the palate; it has the appearance of51 ITALIAN CONFECTIONElt. being solid, and is, notwithstanding, almost a liquid, melting in the mouth. To make this candy, you must have leaden moulds, of rings, ovals, squares, lozenges, halves of apples, pears, melons, raisins, or grapes, infinitely varied. Pour apple jelly, either red or white (see No. 162), and when it has formed a little crust, take the moulds out of the stove, and the jelly shapes from the moulds; turn them out on a sheet of tin, and let them crust; when you see the surface dry, turn them on a sieve to finish drying, which is a slight crystallization of the dried particles of sugar. You must candy them in the same manner as chocolate and others. 31. Chips in Candy, They are preserved in the same manner as fruit: as soon as they are drained from the syrup, they must be twisted round the finger to a certain thick- ness, and, when dry, candied. 32. Apple-paste in Candy, Lay thin apple-paste on plates of pewter; cut it, when half dry, in little slips, a quarter of an inch over; form it into knots, rings, and fanciful shapes of difierent colours; dry them in the stove, and candy them. In this manner may be candied all sorts of fruit pastes, almonds, pistachio kernels, and gum pastes.—(See the several articles.) 33. Ball Candy, This ball in candy is, without contradiction, a beautiful thing, and capable of puzzling the most skilful confectioner, by the curiosity of its con- struction; it is absolutely like a ball in crystal— D 252 ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. empty in the interior^ light and transparent^ as if it was really blown in glass. To make this ball, you must have two pieces of wood, the one concave and the other convex, about the size of half an egg; cut some pieces of paper of a sufficient size to take the form of half a ball; when pressed between these two pieces of wood, you must fold the paper in small folds, so as to be able to take easily the form of half a ball; having a certain quantity made, you must fill them with powdered loaf-sugar; this operation being finished, have several moulds made like that represented in plate \, fig, 5; boil some clarified sugar to the hlow^ put about an inch in depth of sugar in each mould; place over the syrup in your moulds your half balls, side by side, so as not to touch each other : all your moulds being thus filled, put them in a hot stove for about six hours ; afterwards strain off the syrup, as before; let them dry, and close up perfectly, during seven or eight hours, then turn your mould upside down on the table, and take out all the powdered sugar which served to retain them in the syrup like a vessel; then take a camePs-hair pencil, and with cold water wet the paper in the interior, which will enable you to take off the paper with ease, and the candy fixed round will remain solid and transparent, in half balls ; these, when dry, you can smooth, by rubbing them with a fine file, or some scouring paper, so as to make both parts meet with exactness, and form a ball, which you will fix with a little gum Arabic; you can also paint in the interior some small flowers, a motto, or other ornaments, which produce a pleas- ing effect.53 ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. 34. Orange-flowers in Candy, Take some of the whitest prawlined orange- flowers^ and place them on a wire, and then in a candying-box (see opiate I. fig, 4), following the prescribed method (see Fruit in Candy); let them remain in the stove eight hours; take them off the wires, by separating them leaf from leaf: this candy is extremely agreeable. 35. Jujube in Candy, Take some of the finest and whitest gum Arabic, dissolve it in a sufficient quantity of orange-flower water. To every pound of gum add two ounces of crystallized sugar; reduce it in the lain marie to a very thick consistence, similar to jelly, without stirring or moving it, which would hinder it from being transparent; procure a square box, of about half an inch in thickness, and fill it with very dry starch powder, and make some small holes in it, of the same size as you wish the pastilles to be; then fill these small holes with your paste, and put it in the stove to dry; when dry, wipe all the starch off perfectly clean, and put them in candy, like any other objects. Jujubes in candy are not for desserts, being me- dicinal, and originally sold only by chemists. SECTION III. Of Caramel Work. 36. Barley sugar. Take a quantity of clarified sugar, boil it to a crach (see No. 11), and be very exact and attentive54 ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. to the boilings as on this will depend the quality of your barley-sugar. When the sugar is near the crach, add to it two or three drops of lemon-juice, to prevent its graining, or a little vinegar, or alum dissolved in water; any acid will grease sugar and prevent it from graining. When it is come to the crach take it off instantly, and dip your pan in cold water, which will prevent it from becoming a cara- mel, or burning; let it stand a little, and then pour it on a marble, which must be previously rubbed with oil. Cut the sugar into small pieces, with a pair of scissors, and throw them to your assistant, who must be ready to roll them out like wax. Expedition is requisite, and the pieces must be as nearly as possible of the same size: there are women in Paris who can roll six in each hand at a time. You may add any essence you choose; citron is the commonest, one drop of which will be sufficient; too much is unpleasant. This prepara- tion is called larleysugar, because originally it was made with a decoction of barley. The method of making it, above described, is best for confectioners who have occasion for large quantities. A small portion of barley-sugar may be run in sticks, on a marble, by the spout of the pan; and, when it begins to cool, twist it into shape; it is then called twisted sugar, 37. Barley-sugar Tablets, These are made as the last, except that, when the sugar is run on the marble, you must let it cool a little. It will be readily seen whether the sugar gives, by touching it with your hand, as it must not adhere to the finger. Take a tin frame, as in jplate \* fig SI; lean on it, and make the lines55 ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. deep; when cold it will easily part: take a hand- ful of powdered sugar^ and sprinkle the whole^ to dry it, and prevent it from sticking together; then put it up in white or coloured papers, according to fancy. 38. Coffee Tahlets Are made the same as the preceding, only when the sugar is at the crack, put in half a cup of coffee; then reboil it to the same degree, and run it on the marble. 39. Coffee a la Crime Tahlets Are made the same as the preceding, only put half coffee and half cream. These are excellent and have been much ap- proved. 4 0. Barley- sugar Drops Are made in the same manner as the tablets, ex- cept that, instead of being poured out at once, they must be dropped. Take a funnel, as m. plate \.fig^ 8, hold it in the left hand, full of sugar; have a small stick in the right hand, and stop the funnel with it; only one drop to be let out at a time. A little practice will enable you to do this quickly and well; the blade of a knife will detach the drops from the marble; strew some powdered sugar over them, and twist them up in papers. 41. Poppy Drops Are made in the same manner as barley-sugar, by adding, a minute before the sugar comes to the crack (see No. 11), a strong decoction of poppies; they may be cut like the barley-sugar tablets (seeITALIAN CONFECTIONER. 56 No. 37), and then put in small boxes without pow-; | dered sugar. The wild poppy is better than that cul- tivated in our gardens ; the flower is of a lively red. 42. French Rihhon, Take clarified sugar, boil it to a crack (see No, 11); add to it, an instant before it is done, a quan- tity of white honey about the size of a filbert, or some lemon-juice; put in the essence you mean to use the moment it is at the crack, and put the bottom of the pan into cold water, for the reason given in No. 12; let it rest till it ceases boiling, and pour it on an oiled marble. As soon as you can bear the heat, collect the edges quickly into the middle, work and fold it, and handle it till it' looks as white as silver, and shines; then divide it into two equal parts; one to remain white, the other coloured with carmine in powder. Let your assistant work with you till the two portions be- come quite brilliant; unite them, and form one ball of two colours : flatten this ball in strings between your finger and thumb, and roll it on rollers prepared for the purpose, two or three feet long, and tapering, that the sugar may come off without breaking. You may form this composi- tion into cockades, knots, rings, twists; in short, into any shape you please. The French ribbon may be made of three or four colours, but you must employ as many hands as you can, as it is required to be done quickly: use your colours as dry as possible.— (See Colours.) 43. Caramel Work, Caramel is the last degree of heat given to gugar.—(See Nos. 11 and 12.) Every article madeITALIAN CONFECTIONER. 57 with sugar boiled to a crach, is^ in general^ called caramel; as baskets, vases, temples, fruits, spun sugar, figures, animals, medals, and a thousand other things, cast in leaden moulds, whether for the table, or put up in papers, as a bon-bon, ques- tion and answer, rebus, &c. 44. Pine-apple Tablets, Take half of a pine-apple, cut it in slices, pound it in a mortar, and extract the juice through a cloth boil the quantity of sugar you desire to a cracJc; but when you perceive the sugar approach- ing this degree, you will add, gradually, your juice from the pine ; the whole being employed, and the sugar reduced to its just degree, pour it on a slab, and finish as for barley-sugar tablets. 45. Barley-sugar Tablets [Sucre de Ppmmes). Cut half a dozen of fine apples, fit to make a jelly; boil them in a glass of water; pass this decoction through a flannel bag; use and finish it like pine- apple tablets. 46. Ginger Tablets. They are made the same as barley-sugar tablets, by adding from five to six drops of the essence of ginger, at the moment the sugar is near the crach, 47. Sugar Tablets, with Elder-floioers. Take a pound of elder-flowers to three pounds of sugar; put your elder-flowers into a pint of water, give it a minute^s boiling; take it off*, and let it infuse four hours; clarify your sugar, and reduce it to a crack ; pour in your infusion, previously passedITALIAN CONFECTIONER. 58 through a cloth; then reduce it again to a crach ; pour it out on the slab, and cut it out like the other tablets. These tablets are an excellent remedy for the stomach complaint. 48. Fruit in Caramel, Prepare (as directed in Nos. 11 and 12) a quan- tity of sugar, proportioned to that of your fruit; take small pieces of whisky to stick in your fruit; plunge one after the other in the boiling sugar, and place them on a marble slightly rubbed with butter: this fruit is set out on cut or stamped paper, forming small ornamental pyramids. Choose the prettiest preserved fruit you have dry from the sugar or preserved in brandy. 49. Chesnuts in Caramel, Take some chesnuts, and roast them in a pan on the fire; when peeled, stick into each a piece of whisk; dip them in your sugar, and lay them on the marble; or if you would form them into a basket, place them side by side in a mould for that purpose, slightly buttered, and raise them progres- sively to the required height; which you may also do without a mould, by putting a drop of caramel between them. Having finished placing the ches- nuts, you may ornament them with little flowers, or horns, rings, wreaths, &c., all in gum paste, V and coloured with other trifles in candy. 50. Orange-quarters in Caramel, Peel, and divide into quarters some fine oranges; carefully take off* the pith, put them for a short time in the stove, stick them with pieces of whisk, and dip them in the caramel, as the other fruits.59 ITALIAN CONFECTIONEE. Serve them up detached^ or in a basket, similar to the chesnuts. Cherries^ apples^ and grapes also, whether in brandy or fresh, may be done the same way; ornament your baskets as much as possible, forming handles to them with spun sugar in cara- mel.—(See No. 52.) 51. Quartered Lemons in Caramel, / Quartered lemons are put in caramel like oranges; they are excellent; many prefer them to oranges, and they make a very pretty plate. 52. Caramel Baskets. The author is the first that brought to perfection the art of spinning sugar. He conceived the idea in 1816, to form baskets, vases, temples, bird-cages, with several sorts of birds; and, in fact, every kind of ornament that can be imagined for the table. He began by fitting behind a glass a pretty draw- ing of Arabesque, by slightly oiling the face of the glass, and following the drawing with a pointed stick dipped in the sugar; when finished, take it off the glass with the blade of a knife, and put it over the mould to take its shape. At the corona- tion of his late Majesty George the Fourth, the author made a great number, and kept them in perfection by putting them in a large stock pot, well secured from the air, by putting paper thickly round the cover, and keeping them in a dry room.— (See Spinning Sugar.) 53. Currants, Grapes, and Straioherries in Caramel, Choose the finest bunches of currants; take a white and a black single grape, likewise a straw-60 ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. berry or raspberry. Form a small bouquet iri variation of colours; fasten it together with a small wooden pin; it must be flat and formed in an oval shape; pass through a wire five or six inches long, with a hook at the top. Dip your bouquet in the caramel; hang it on a string to drain. When cold, take off the wire, dress it with white paper the same shape, cut round the edge with scissors to imitate fringe, and dish it up. 54. Chantilly Basket, It would take up too much time to describe every variety which may be made under this head; suffice it to say, that everything that is done in biscuit may be made of pleasing forms, as little rings, lozenges, ovals, squares, stars, meteors, iced or not, fixed to each other with a drop of caramel, and formed to your fancy. These may be also made of paste of almonds, by fixing a case on the outside of a buttered mould, and baking it of a clear brown : . covers may be made to the baskets, of spun sugar, formed in mosaic, and some may be cast of the same sugar, into round balls, figures, feet, &c. (as stands for the baskets), in leaden moulds. 55. Ahmnd Caramel Baskets, Take picked almonds, blanched, cut them into long slices, colour them pink with cochineal, in a small copper pan, and put them on a gentle fire, stirring them with your hand till dry. When this is done, take a sheet of copper or tin, rub it with a small quantity of butter, strew your pink almonds on the plate, or rather place them in the form of half the mould, whose shape you choose, and ofITALIAN CONFECTIONER. 61 which you must take a pattern in paper; the form of the paper must be that of your almonds on the plate. Have some sugar prepared^ and spin it over the almonds (see No. 63); being perfectly spun, your almonds must be all fixed to it; turn it, and spin over the other side; and, after applying them to your mould, fix them together with some of the same sugar; cut off the waste parts, and finish your basket with ornaments: you may make them with pistachios, of biscuits cut small, or of liqueur drops, the whole being in little pieces. 56. Nog at, 12 oz. of Almonds, 7 oz. of Sugar. Take a small copper pan, in which you put seven ounces of powdered sugar; place it on a moderate fire, and melt it, stirring it with a spaddle; when equally melted, and it has taken a clear brown colour, put in twelve ounces of almonds, blanched, and cut in lengths, dried the previous day in the stove ; you may even colour them by placing them at the mouth of the oven. Everything being ready, mix your almonds well with the sugar till they are covered with it, and of a clear brown; pour them on a marble, taking care first to rub it with a small quantity of butter: if you wish to give it a shape, have a mould of copper or tin, slightly buttered; and that you may not burn your fingers, spread it with a lemon or carrot, as thin and even as possible. When cold, take it off from the mould, taking care, while it is still warm, to detach it on all sides. 57. Gahe Nog at.

Of Spinning Sugar. You must have moulds of vases, baskets, &c._, or any shape you may choose, either in copper, tin, or glass; they must be made so as to deliver •well, in- side and out, and must be rubbed with butter as slightly as possible; sugar spun inside the mould is always better than that spun outside, as you may strengthen it with the threads that fly over by the motion of your arms, and the sugar will look smoother and more finished than when it is done on the outside. Take clarified sugar of the neces- sary proportion to the size of your mould, and boil it in a copper pan, which must be perfectly clean, and have a small sponge, dipped in clean water and squeezed out, to keep the inside edge of the pan free from sugar bubbles, which will not fail to fix there while it boils to a crack,—(See No. 11.) At the precise moment when this takes place, add a drop or two of lemon-juice, to grease it a little that the sugar may not grain.— (See No. 12.) Any acid, or even apple-jelly, if at hand, will answer the same purpose.64 ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. Your sugar being ready^ take the pan from the fire, let it cool a little, then have a spoon, or two forks united, or a four-pronged tool—the prongs distant from each other three quarters of an ineh^ forming a cross; dip it in your sugar, try it by raising up some of it, and spin it by a shake of the hand; if the sugar forms threads easily, hold the mould in your left hand, the tool in the right, moving it backwards and forwards, spinning it in- side like silken threads, taking care to let none of it fall in drops, as it would spoil your work; your threads will be coarser if you use the coldest part of the sugar. Strengthen the inside with the sugar which falls on the outside; take the basket, or vase, ■ off the mould, while it is warm, and put it again, lightly into your mould to cool, and keep its shape; when cold, ornament it with various draperies^ gar- lands, and wreaths, of the same sugar, spun on the blade of a knife. Hold the knife in your left ; hand, and over the back of it spin some of the thickest threads, or you may likewise spin some on ] a napkin, or a tin plate; dispose them tastefully on ; your basket, make handles of the same sugar, twisted, or cast in leaden moulds (see No. 578), in i the shape of heads, feet, or any other ornament. • With spun sugar you may make every required ., ornament, temples, vases, ships, globes, covers for; vases, and even imitate horsehair on a helmet, &c. i 64. Bon-hons. There is a great demand for these articles in! France, particularly on New-year^s day; and the various envelopes in which they are put up, display j the usual ingenuity of this gay and versatile people; fables, historical subjects, songs, enigmas.65 ITALIAN CONFECTIONEE. jeux de mots^ and various little gallantries, are all inscribed upon the papers in which the bon-bons ar^ enclosed^ and which the gentlemen present to the females of their acquaintance. But as this custom is not pursued in England (bon-bons being chiefly used as ornaments to the dessert), we will not de- tain the reader with any description of the various devices just alluded to, but proceed to describe the method of making bon-bons practised by the author. Provide leaden moulds (see that article, No. 578), which must be of various shapes, round, oval, square, lozenge shape, octagon shape, &c., and be oiled with oil of sweet almonds; take a quantity of syrup, in proportion to your moulds; boil it to a hlow^ add a drop of any essence you please, rose, cinnamon, orange-flower, lemon, cedratys, vanilla, bergamot, &c., and vary the colours according to fancy. If you would have the bon-bons white, when your sugar has cooled a little, stir it round the pan till it grains and shines on the surface ; pour it into a funnel (see plate I. fig, 8), and fill your little moulds, and it will take a proper form, and harden ; when cold, take it from the moulds, let it dry two or three days, and then put it in its paper. If you wish the bon-bons to be coloured, add the colour just as your sugar is ready to be taken off the fire: if the colour be fluid, boil the sugar a little more.— (See Colours^ 65. Different sorts of Bon-hons. Boil your sugar to a crack, add to it a drop of any essence, and fill your prepared moulds as directed in the preceding article; when cold, take out the bon-bons, put them in the stove, that the heat may EITALIAN CONFECTIONER. 66 turn them^ that is to say^ that the sugar may take a crystallization outwardly^ which prevents it from becoming damp. Do not put them over one another^ as they will adhere together. 66. Transparent Bon-bons, Boil your sugar to the great blow ; take it ofF^ and add a very small quantity of aromatic spirits, either coffee^ maraschino^ vanilla^ &c. Take care not to stir the sugar^ lest it should grain; let it rest from boiling before you fill your moulds; let your moulds be slightly oiled, then pour in your sugar; leave it eight or ten hours in a stove, with a very slack heat, oi^ in any warm place free from dust: this bon-bon is crystallized, solid, transparent^, and very good. 67. Bon-bons prepared with Liqueurs, Take small moulds, as for transparent bon-bons, and the required quantity of double-refined sugar; pound and sift it through a lawn sieve, put it into an earthen pan, and moisten it with a little rose water, or orange-flower water, till it forms a stiff paste; add to it a small quantity of spirits, or the liqueur you wish it to taste of, till your paste is of the consistence of thin iceing ; put it on the fire in a copper pan, and keep stirring it; when you see it disposed to rise, and your sugar shines on the surface, stir it, and pour it into your funnel (see plate I. fig, 8), and fill your little moulds; when cold, take them out, and put them into a warm stove to dry, a few hours; they are then fit for use. These bon-bons are not intended to contain liqueur, only to have the taste; it cannot be trans- parent or crystallized, because the sugar beingITALIAN CONFECTIONER. 67 pounded, changes its nature,—it becomes a part of starch and gum Arabic. If you put a piece of loat- sugar in a tumbler of water, it will remain clear; on the contrary, if you use a spoonful of powdered sugar, the water becomes thick, which proves the existence of starch. 68. On Bon-bons, Since the publication of the first edition, this part of confectionery has been enriched by a most useful discovery, due to mere chance, and brought by the hand of ignorance to perfection. Industrious man, enchanted with your profession, of what use, then, are your researches, as all your labours are often surpassed by chance alone ! The most dis- tinguished chemist of the thirteenth century, Arnaud de Villeneuve, created the art of distilla- tion. In the first year of the nineteenth century, Edward Adam, a pedlar, who sold cloth, assisted by chance at a lecture on chemistry: he saw an appa- ratus of Wolfe's used, and immediately conceived the idea of applying it to the distillation of wine ; and thus rendered the greatest service to the brandy trade, and made a great fortune. In the art of confectionery, a man who had just entered the business (but whose name is unfortunately not known to the author), saw a brass-founder mould- ing in sand, or printing ornaments in bas-relief, which were afterwards to be executed in brass. He conceived the idea of making use of pounded sugar instead of sand, and to print the sanle, and then pour the syrup, boiled to thirty-eight degrees, or the large feather, in the cavity. Confectioners, who know what sugar is, would scarcely have believed but that hot liquid syrups poured on powdered E 2ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. 68 sugar would have melted the whole mass in a lump; yet^ from this novel plan^ the prettiest designs and most elegant shapes were formed^ and gave birth to a thousand other beautiful inventions;—of these we shall now speak. 69. New Bon-bons, or Candied, It is necessary to have a square board^ two feet wide^ with a border round it an inch and a half thick^ like the cover of a box_, fill it with very dry powdered sugar or starchy which (that it may be properly dried) must be put over the slow fire, or slow oven. The board or box is filled^ and a roller passed over it to make it as smooth as a marble slab. You should have wooden or plaster patterns, or they may be made in brass, ivory, or lead; they should represent the desired object exactly, any- thing that may be wished. They should be pushed in the starch, that the form of the object may re- main. When the boards are filled with models, boil syrups, made with the best sugar, and clarified with animal black [^QQjoage 37, No. 4, boiled to the degree of large feaiher, page 39, No. 9), then fill up the void with great attention, following all the designs of the model; powder them over with starch, and place the board in the stove, so that the sugar becomes solid. Leave them in twelve hours after this operation; then take them out of the starch, brush them lightly, taking off all the powder remaining on the objects, and make them candied as before.—(See Meteors, page 10, No. 44.) 70. Candied Rings containing Liquettr, This sort of rings is described in No. 84; they can be.moulded in starchy like the preceding; the69 ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. syrup must be coloured according to taste : or it may be left white^ and painted with a brush after- wards^ as all the pieces of candy are different; those which are imitated must be carefully painted with the best colours^ similar to those employed for miniatures. 71. Vegetables and Fntits in Sugar. Take small leaden moulds (see No. 578), made to open in two, representing the fruit you would imitate; boil your sugar to a hloio^ and add the colour of your vegetable or fruit (see Colours) ; stir your sugar till it grains and the surface shines; pour it into the moulds with a funnel, such as you use for liqueur drops (see ^late I. Jig. 8), and stop the funnel with a little stick every time the mould is full. If you wish to imitate carrots, colour them with saffron, and stick in bits of angelica, while hot, to form the green top; place the mould so that the head of the carrot will form the mouth of it. Apples, pears, radishes, are to be coloured after they are made, with carmine. Turnip-radishes, mushrooms, eggs, dominoes, dice, &c., must be made like conserve, that is, with fine powdered sugar, as they will be much whiter; give each a different taste with essences, or spirits; mushrooms are coloured with chocolate, melted very thin, on a warm stove : asparagus, potatoes, everything, in short, may be imitated with moulds. 7 2. Chesnuts with Sugar. Take a pound of the finest clarified sugar, boil it to a hlow ; take it from the fire, and work it as for a conserve; take six yolks of eggs, beat them up, and add a glass of maraschino, or any other liqueur.ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. 70 When your sugar is nearly to a conserve^ add your eggs, working them well in, till you produce a stiff paste. Put it on a marble, with some fine powdered sugar, and roll it into balls, to which you must give the shape of chesnuts, marking stripes as in the real chesnut, when peeled : everything being finished, and imitated in the best manner, make a piece of iron wire red-hot, and touch dif- ferent parts of the chesnut, to imitate the roasted fruit, which will add to it a taste of caramel. 73. Natural Fruit, Take wooden moulds, representing the kernel of each fruit, as peach, apricot, plum, &c., and fit them to the mould with gum paste of the colour of the stone; put a small almond in each kernel, and into every kernel a wire, the other end of which must be a little hooked, to attach it to a pack- thread, which must be stretched across the room to dry and harden, as the stones must be hard; blanch some sweet almonds the evening before, and pound them in a mortar, with the juice of lemon, not too fine, and take care they do not oil; add a quantity of powdered sugar, in proportion to your almonds; form a malleable paste that can easily be worked by the hand, and make the fruit of it, by working the paste round the kernels prepared as above. Your fruit being ready, take some clarified isinglass, divide it equally, and put the two portions into two little pans; one must be made yellow with saffron, the other red with carmine or cochineal; hold your fruit by the wire stalk, dip one side in the yellow, the other in the red, according to its kind, and hang them to dry : when half dried, or at least when you can handle them without their stick-ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. 71 ing to your fingers, take a powder-bag, that is, a bit of rag, in which you put a little starch powder, and powder your fruit with it round, to imitate the bloom or down of the fruit; plums may be sprinkled with blue powder the same way as the starch. These fruits must have a skin like the real fruit, and the isinglass forms this, so that they are soft to the touch, like natural ripe fruit, and feel fresh, like it. 74. Li^M FruitSy and of a natural size. You must first make the moulds in plaster of Paris, made to open in two or three parts, upon some fine and very fresh fruits; when your moulds are ready, boil to a blow some syrup, clarified with animal black, as stated in the white clarification ; when boiled to a blow, let it stand a moment ofi* the fire; then add to it a tea-spoonful of white French vinegar, or the juice of half a lemon ; work them with a spaddle; this syrup, to grain it; and when it begins to whiten, pour it into the plaster moulds, which you have dipped in fresh water a few minutes previously. When your moulds are full, turn them upside down to empty them, and there will remain a portion of sugar congealed in the interior of the mould, which, when cold, by opening the mould, will come out, formed in its natural state. When all your fruits that you desire to obtain are finished, paint them with water-colours, according to their nature. You must observe not to use any colours but what are wholesome; viz., spinach green, fine car- mine, cochineal, safi^ron; and for the imitation of brown spots, use a decoction of coffee, chocolate, and Spanish-liquorice juice : the bloom of the peaches and fruits is supplied with fine-pounded sugar.72 ITALIAN CONFECTIONEE. 75. Artificial Strawherries. Make an almond paste (see Almond Paste), an roll and cut it to the size of a strawberry; then work it in your hands, to give it the same form, and fix a piece of whisk in the stalk-end of each ; put them, as prepared, in a sieve full of pounded sugar^ that they may stand regularly; have some sugar pounded coarse^ then sift it through a coarse sieve and a still finer one, to take away the dust. Dip your strawberries into a syrup of raspberries, or any other fruit, and then in your sugar, to form the little seeds. The strawberry being dry, take some carmine, dissolved in strong gum, that the fruit may shine, and give the colours with a fine hair pencil. When dry, take out the pieces of whisk, and leave the whole white. Put them in a warm place to dry for a few hours, and serve them on plates, with strawberry leaves. 76. Small Sausages, Take some entrails, which may be had ready cleaned at the pork butcher^s; wash them again very clean; then take some red and white apple, or quince paste, chop it like sausage-meat, and put in, if you choose, some apricots, cherries, or any other red or white fruit, with some red and white currants, or any kind of fruit to imitate nature, and a few coriander seeds. Fill the skins, tie a knot at each end with some thready and roll the sausages in your hands, with a drop of oil of sweet almonds. It may be cut lengthwise, or across : it is an excellent imitation of nature.— (For the Pastey see each article separately).ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. 73 77. Imitation of Ham. Take half a pound of almond paste (see Almond Paste), and divide it into three equal parts; keep one part white^ to imitate the fat^ and colour the other two portions red, to imitate the lean. Give it, to the best of your power, the shape of a ham, by placing the fat and lean properly. Dissolve some vanilla chocolate (see No. 123) in water, and lay it over the ham to imitate the rind. Prepare dried macaroons in the oven, and reduce them to powder, to cover your ham, as this will imitate the raspings of bread usually put on it: it may be cut in slices. With the same paste, many other things of the kind may be imitated^ which the taste or fancy may suggest. 78, Of Ligiieur Drops, Or drops of syrup prepared for candy.— (See No. 14). No liqueur is necessary to form the liquid found in them, it being only the moisture of the syrup, which the crystallization of the sugar con- fines there. As a proof of this, liqueur drops may be made transparent, containing liquid in the in- side, without putting any liqueur in them. They are also better if spirits be used instead of fac- titious liquids. Liqueur drops, whether made in France, or by confectioners, or in private houses in London, are in general uneven, and extremely irregular. Most confectioners make small paper moulds to hold the drops, and take them off by wetting the back of the paper, as candy and liqueur rings; but this process is too slow. The following will be found the best method: by pouring the drops on paper, they run, and lose their shape at7i ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. the least fold in the paper; wooden frames, there- fore, are greatly preferable. Take a sufficient number of these, wet your paper with clean water, and let it steep ten minutes; then stretch it, fixing it on the frames with gum Arabic; as the paper dries, it becomes as tight as a drum, and by that means the drop remains perfectly round, equal, and as it ought to be; the same frames will serve several times, by washing them as soon as the drop is ofi*. 79. To make Liqueur Drops» Put the required quantity of syrup into a pan, and boil it to a blow (see No. 8); then add a little liqueur, to your taste, — as maraschino, noyau, rosolio, Pliuile do Venus, macaroni, cinnamon, &c.; to make which, see Liqueurs, If you use the spirit of liqueurs, you must put in a less quantity, and boil your sugar only to the small blow (see No. 8), as the factitious liqueurs contain much syrup. Let it rest a moment, and when you perceive a small candy or skin on the surface of the sugar, pour a part into the funnel {^qq plate \, fig, 8), with the stick that is to stop it as it drips. Take the funnel in the left hand, and hold it two inches from the frame which is to receive the drops, with the stick in your right hand, leaning on the edge of the funnel with the little finger of the right hand; then raise the stick to let a drop fall, and instantly close it. Place the drops a quarter of an inch from each other, and when finished, put them, in a stove moderately heated. The next day, if the drops be of a good consistence, rub a wet sponge on the back of the paper frame, and in a few minutes, having imbibed the moisture, they will easily comeITALIAN CONFECTIONER. 75 off; as you remove the drops^ put them back to back, the moist parts together. They may be made of any colour, by adding it to the liqueur or spirits: the lightest colours are most agreeable to the eye.—(See Colours.) 80. Round Liqueur Drops, in one Piece. Proceed in the same manner as for the preceding ones : instead of running them on paper, run them in fine powdered sugar, or starch; but the author gives the preference to sugar. Have a frame, or box, about two feet square and one inch deep; fill it with powdered sugar extremely dry, and mark as many impressions with a half ball as the box will contain, by placing them close together; run your drops in these holes; or, to express myself better, fill them, and put them into the stove during twenty-four hours, at the expiration of which time take out your drops, put them in a sieve, and pass them by steam; that is to say, having a pan of boiling water upon the fire, the vapour which descends, you let pass through your sieve, by holding it over the steam till all the white sugar is totally melted, and that your drops become brilliant: return them to the stove to dry. You can make them of different colours, such as rose, blue, green, yellow, and purple : but if you wish the colours to show well, one-fourth part of them should be made white. 81. Crystallized Bon-hons a la Brochette, Prepare some skewers in wood, about five inches in length, choose all sorts of dried fruits of different colours, such as cherries, green apricots, &c.j pass76 ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. the skewers through the middle of the fruity place them close to each other, in separate sorts if you prefer. When you have got the quantity you wish, place them close to each other at the bottom of your tin box for candies, cover them with a cloth, cut the same size as the interior of your box;- boil some syrup to the hlow, and pour it over them; let them be well covered with it put your box in the stove for six hours, then draw off the syrup: when they are well dried, they are fit for use. 82. Figures, Animalsy Birds, 8fc, Make your impressions with the models, in pow- dered starch, as described in No. 69; proceed the same, and when they are dry and clean, make a royal icing, with very fine powdered sugar, white of eggs, a drop of lemon-juice; the icing must be rather thick, divide it, and make it in as many different colours as you wish to have them; make as many papers as you have colours; fasten them with a pin, and let them be in the shape of a horn, about four inches in length; put a spoonful of your icing in and close it at the top; with your scissors cut off a bit of the point; then squeeze it between the thumb and finger of your right hand, and orna- ment your bon-bons according to nature. And for the better information of the artist, I will now describe the making of figures. Take one of the paper horns containing flesh colour, squeeze it out to form the body ; take care to finish well the face, hands, and all parts that will be seen; take a brown one, and form the hair; with a white one make the cravat and the front of the shirt; and so on with the other colours; finish dressing it ac- cording to your taste with dry carmine ; colour the,77 ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. face, and with liquid colour touch the eyes: use a little vermilion for the lips. If you wish some parts of it to shine, pass over the solution of gum Arabic : the same method is adopted for birds, shells, or anything you fancy. 83. Jewel Liqueur Drops, This drop, from its small size and transparency, is extremely beautiful; but is not at all common, from the difficulty of making it equal and perfectly round. The following method may be depended on :—The funnel [^qq plate ^.fig. 9) should be fixed in the work-room, so as to be taken off* at pleasure; in the middle of it is a bar and screw, the point of which fits the middle of the funnel, and descends perpendicularly, to stop the hole when the syrup drops. The sugar being prepared with the liqueur, as before directed, and coloured to your fancy, pour it into the funnel; have your frame ready, open the screw, and let a very small drop fall, which you must receive on the papered frame, moving it about, and holding it with both hands. As the sugar ceases dropping from the candy which forms on the screw, open it a little more; when done, put them in the stove, and finish them as the last, but not joined together: they are extremely small. 84. Liqueur Rings for Candy, Take a small wooden mould, composed of two pieces, the one forming the inside of a ring, the other the outside; they must be hollow, and fit one another (see plate I. fig, 10); cut some paper of the shape of the mould, but rather larger, and lay it in, and adapt it to the mould; place several of7S ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. the moulds on the table^ fill them, by means of the funnel^ with the sugar of the liqueur drops, and put them in a stove moderately heated. Take ofi" the paper, when the rings are sufficiently firm, by wetting it with a hair-pencil dipped in water, giving them sufficient time to moisten ; then candy them.—(See No. 25, Liqueur Rings in Candy^ 85. A new sort of Candy, which can he made in every shape that imagination may direct. First, you must form your model, suppose a harpy whether in paste, plaster, lead, or wood, so that it is in one hard and solid body, and, like unto copper founders, have some squares, or wooden boxes, of about half an inch deep : fill it with very fine pow- dered loaf-sugar; smooth it with a rule, and print with your models as many impressions as you wish to obtain pieces of candy; run in all these vacan- cies the same composition as for liqueur rings, and put your box into the stove for twelve hours; the next day you will find your ornaments quite solid : when well brushed free from sugar, paint them according to your taste, and put them in candy, in the usual manner. 86. Prunes and Raisins Are made the same as the preceding, only add to your sugar a strong decoction of coffee, with a drop of cochineal, which will attain the proper colour. 87. Imitation of Apricot and other fruits. Place in the starch models of fruit, made in plaster or wood; boil your sugar to the large feather (see No. 9), or syrup-weigher to thirty-ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. 79 eight degrees; add a small glass of liqueur^ of noyau^ coloured with a little saffron; fill the spaces^ and let it remain twelve hours in the stove; then brush off the powder attached to the fruit; paint it in imitation of real fruity and put it in the candy, as described in No. 13. 88. Raspberries, The mould or models must be made in ivory, no other substance will succeed in forming a mould or impression so neat, covered with small grains; the impression of which is to remain clear in the starch, so that the fruit may have its natural shape. The syrup must be boiled to the hall (see No. 10), or forty-five degrees of the saccharometer; mix with it some very clear raspberry-juice, either fresh or preserved; a drop of cochineal may be added, for the colour; fill the cavities, let them remain twelve hours, then wash them with spirits of wine and a brush. They do very well without being candied. 89. Liqueur Drops of different Shapes, These drops are made like the others, but in smaller papers, to which must be given the shape of squares, lozenges, triangles, little festooned vases, &c.; for which purpose you must use little blocks of wood and small rollers, to form the required shape. The paper must be plaited with the blade of a knife; it may also be crimped with the fingers. The beauty of the form depends entirely on the dexterity of the maker. Pill and take off the drops in the same way as the others.ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. 80 90. OfI)ro])s. The drop is composed of aromatic refined sugar only; it requires much care and cleanliness in the making. Take double-refined sugar^ and pound and sift it through a hair sieve^ not too fine to obtain a large grain; then sift it through a silk sieve, to take out all the fine dust_, which would destroy the beauty of the drop, as this takes away its transparency, and prevents its shining. The sdgar being thus prepared, put it into a very clean pan, and moisten it with any aromatic you choose, as rose-water, &c.; pour in the rose-water slowly, stirring it with a spaddle; you will know whether the sugar be moist enough, if, on taking up some on the spaddle, it falls off without sticking to it. You may colour the sugar if you please with a small quantity of liquid carmine, or any other colour ground very fine, and made very smooth by moistening it with water only : the lightest colours are best. Take a small pan with a lip {^qq jjlate I. Jig. 11), and fill it about with paste, and place the pan on a small stove, the half-hole being of the size of the pan; stir the sugar with a little ivory or bone spaddle, till it becomes liquid ; when you see it about to boil, take it from the fire, and con- tinue to stir it; if it be too moist, take a little of the powdered sugar (which you should reserve for the purpose when you begin), and add a spoonful to your paste, and keep stirring it till it be of such a consistence as to run without extending itself too much: have a tin plate very clean and smooth; take the little pan in your left hand, and hold in your right a bit of iron, copper, or silver wire, four inches long, to take off the drop from the lip of81 ITALIAN CONFECTIONEE. the pan^ and let it fall regularly on the tin plate; two hours afterwards you may take off the drops with the blade of a knife. 91. Orange-flower Drops Are made as the preceding, only using orange- flower water (see the Distillation of that article. No. 485) ; if you have no water, use the essence of naroli, which is the essential oil of that flower, and it will answer the purpose : the best is that of Florence. 92. Chocolate Drops, Scrape the chocolate to powder, and put an ounce to a pound of sugar; moisten the paste with clear water, and work it as above, only taking care to use all the paste prepared, as^ if it be put on the fire a second time, it greases, and the drop is not of the proper consistence. 93. Coffee Drops. An ounce of coffee to a pound of sugar will form a strong decoction; when cleared, use it to moisten the sugar; and then make the drops as above. 94. Barberry Drops. Take the expressed juice of a quarter of a pound of barberries to a pound of sugar; moisten the sugar with the juice, add a little water, if necessary, and take the same precautions as for chocolate drops, as this paste will easily grease. There are three sorts of barberries \ scarlet^ white, and stone- less. FITALIAN CONFECTIONER. 82 95, Cinnamon Bro^s, Take an ounce of cinnamon to a pound of sugar, and pound and sift the cinnamon through a silk sieve, or add to the sugar a few drops of the essence of cinnamon j drop them as before, 96. Clove Droops Are made as the cinnamon drops, the cloves being pounded, or the essence used. Good cloves should be black, heavy, of a pungent smelly hot to the taste, and full of oil. 97. Vanilla Bro^s, To a pound of sugar add two pods of vanilla, which you must first cut very small with a knife, and pound in a mortar with a little powdered sugar, without which you cannot reduce it into powder; sift it through a silk sieve. The essence of vanilla is not fit for use, as it gives but little taste, and greases. 98. Angelica Drops. Reduce to an impalpable powder the grain of angelica; put an ounce of it to a pound of sugar, and make the drops as before. 99. Orgeat Drops, Take four ounces of blanched almonds, pound them very fine, and moisten them with clear water, to form a paste; to this add orange-flower water, and strain the whole through a cloth; this should produce about half a pint of milk of almonds. Moisten your sugar with it, and make the drops as directed before. Observe, that as almonds are ofITALIAN CONFECTIONER. 83 an oily nature, you must use the same precautions as with chocolate.— (See No. 92.) 100. Peppermint Drops. To make these drops, the following are the re- quisites : extreme cleanliness, the finest sugar, and a few drops of the essence of peppermint, 101. Lemon Drops. Use the essence of lemon, made by rubbing the lemon on a piece of loaf-sugar, and scraping it into your paste: this is better than any other essence. 102. Vinegar Drops. Moisten your sugar with French white-wine vinegar; it will very soon grease the sugar.—(See No. 91.) 103. Pine-apple Drops. Rub the rind of the fruit on sugar (see No. 101), pound and pass the fruit through a fine hair sieve, mix it with the rind in the sugar to your taste : moisten it with clear water; it will very soon grease.—(See No. 92.) 104. Carraway Drops. Moisten your sugar with carraway water. 105. Poppy Drops. Make a decoction of poppies, strain it through a cloth, and moisten your sugar with it. 106. Paspherry Drops. Take very ripe raspberries, put them in a cloth, F 2ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. 84 to squeeze out the juice^ and moisten your sugar with it; this will grease it.— (See No. 92.) 107. Drops of two Coloitrs, All drops^ of which the compounds are not greasy^ may be party-coloured; take a little pan^ with a lip^ and a partition in the middle of it^ to keep the two pastes separate^ just allowing them to meet on the lip.-—(See plate I. fig, 11.) 108. Ginger Drops, Pound and sift_, through a silk sieve^ the required quantity of ginger^ according to the strength you wish^ and add it to your sugar with clean water. The ginger brought from China is the best; it is yellowish^ of a sharp^ hot taste, and very aromatic. 109. Cateclm Drops, Pulverise, and sift through a silk sieve, three ounces of catechu, and add it to a pound of sugar, using clear water.— (See No. 126.) Violet drops are made in the same manner, pounding iris root instead of catechu. 110. Prawlings, Everything is called a prawling which is covered with dry sugar to preserve it from moisture; as orange-flowers, lemon-peel, orange-peel, almonds, pistachios, &c. 111. WMte Prawlings. Boil your sugar to a feather (see No. 9), put in ,the fruit or almonds, and boil it to a craeh (see No.ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. 85 11) ; and take it from the fire and work it with a spaddle (see ]^late I. fig, 12)^ till the sugar comes to a powder, then throw the whole into a sieve to take off the surplus of sugar; afterwards put the prawlings into a box for use. 112. Burnt Almonds^ or Almond Prawlings in Bed, 1S). of Almonds, 1 lb. of Sugar. Take a pound of almonds^ free from dust, dis- solve with a little water a pound of sugar; put the almonds in, and boil them with the sugar; when the almonds crack, take them off the fire, stir them to a sandy sift them to take ofi" the loose sugar ; put back the sugar in a pan on the fire, with a little water; boil it to a caramel (see No. 12) ; add your almonds with a little liquid carmine ; stir them till they have taken all the sugar; put them into a sieve, and sprinkle them with a little orange-flower water, to give them a flavour, and make them shine. 113. Burnt Almonds Are made in the same manner, but without colour ; they must be heated till they acquire a lustre from the caramel. 114. White Almond Prawlings, 1 lb. of Almonds, 2 lbs. of Sugar. Take two pounds of clarified sugar (see No. 2), boil it to a ball (see No. 10) ; put a pound of Jordan almonds, blanched and dried, into the pan with the sugar; stir them, take them from the fire, and make them imbibe as much sugar as pos- sible ; and repeat this if you want them moreITALIAN CONFECTIONER. 85 saturated with sugar. To make tliem plnk^ add some liquid carmine to the sugar^ as in the last process. 115. PistacJiio Prawlings, 1 lb. of Sugar, 1 ]ib. of Pistachios. Dissolve a pound of sugar with a little water, and when boiled to the little hall (see No. 10), add your pistachios; take the pan from the fire, work the pistachios in the same way as the almonds, and finish as there directed. 116. Nttt Prawlings, lib. of Sugar, lib. ofl!^uts. Heat your nuts in a pan, on a quick fire, to take off the skin; when clean, work them as the pista- chios, putting a pound of nuts to a pound of sugar. 117. Orange-flower Prawlings. Pick your orange-flowers quite clean, directly they are gathered, and let them steep in fresh water, while- you put on a suflicient quantity of clarified sugar (see No. 2), which you must boil to a little ball (see No. 10); take the orange-fiowers, and break the stalks and ribs in your hands to soften them, and open the pores, that the sugar may penetrate, and that the flower may be soft, flat, and in its natural state. When the sugar is ready, add the flowers to it, turning them round with a spaddle; as they will diminish the heat of your sugar, you must boil it again to the little hall (see No. 10), then take it from the fire and work it till reduced to a sand; when you can bear your hand in it, rub it lightly, to break every lump, andITALIAN CONFECTIONER. 87 sift it through a clean sieve. Keep the waste sugar to flavour biscuits v^ith^ or for any other purpose you may require. 11.8. Bose Harlequm Pistachios. Take pounded sugar^ as at No. 90, and moisten it with rose-water; wrap up a pistachio in the paste, shape it in your hand, and throw it into some white nonpareils, which you must have in a bowl near you, that it may be covered with them. Continue to do the same with all the pistachios; you may add to the paste a little moistened car- mine. These pistachios may be made like comfits: they do not dissolve so readily in the mouth, but they are made in less time than comfits. You may vary the flavour of your paste, and give to it the taste of orange-flowers, lemon, bergamot, pine- apples, vanilla, coflee, cinnamon, &c. SECTION IV. Chocolate. 119. CJiocolate Harlequin Pistachios. Take a small metal mortar, and warm it well; when warm, pound in it the required quantity of chocolate, with sugar (see No. 121) ; thus pre- pared, take the size of a nut of the paste, put a pistachio in it, and shake it in your hand till it has acquired the form of an olive; throw it into harlequin-coloured nonpareils, that it may be enveloped in it, and so on continue with the other mits. All kinds of pistachios are generally put up88 ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. in white or coloured paper, with the ends cut, and the paper should contain mottoes or poetry. 120. Cocoa Nuts. The cocoa nut is the fruit of a tree, about the height of an orange tree, which grows more parti- cularly in America, and produces a fruit containing; about thirty kernels. Of cocoa nuts there are i many sorts—the cocoa of the Caraco, of Cayenne, of Berbice, of the island of St. Magdalen, of St. Domingo; they all differ in quality and taste; that of Caraco is the best to be prepared for chocolate; it is mixed in equal parts with that of St. Mag- dalen, as it is too dry of itself for that operation, i To make chocolate, the kernels must be roasted in' an iron pan, like coffee, stirring it all the time;, when it is done enough, the peeling comes oS easily when you hold it between your finger and' thumb, and care must be taken not to roast it too much. Then winnow it like corn, to take off the husks; thus cleansed, put it back on the fire, and * keep it stirring till you see it shine; take it off a second time, to remove any of the husks that may be left. 121. Chocolate, 10 ibs. of Cocoa, 74 lbs. of Sugar. Take ten pounds of cocoa, prepared as in the pre- ceding number; have a cast-iron mortar, and warm it by filling it with live charcoal; when very hot, wipe it out well, that there may be no dust; pound . your cocoa nuts with the iron 'pestle till you have reduced them to an oily paste, which you will ascertain by the pestle sinking into it by its own weight; add to the paste seven pounds and a halfITALIAN CONFECTIONEE. 89 of fine powdered sugar, and continue to pound it till perfectly mixed; then take out the paste, put it into a pan, and place it on one side in your stove (see plate I. fig, 13), having a charcoal fire on the other side to heat the stone, which must be very flat and smooth, eighteen inches wide, and thirty long. Take about a pound of the paste, and grind it with an iron roller, till, upon tasting it, it will melt in your mouth like butter, without leaving any sediment. Put this into another pan, and continue to roll the remainder; the stone should be so heated as scarcely to bear your hand on it. "When the several parcels are thus prepared, make the whole into one mass on the stone, lessen the g degree of heat, mix it well, and divide it into quan- tities of two ounces; put them into moulds of tin (see j^late I. fig, 14), place the moulds on a board, and on shaking the board your chocolate must be- come fiat in the moulds, and shine ; let it cool, and take it out of the moulds. To make the vanilla chocolate, you must pulverize two ounces of vanilla with one part of sugar, and add it to the gross quantity of paste when finished. 122. Chocolate Drops, with Nonpareils, Take a quantity of chocolate, warm a small cast- iron or metal mortar, and pound your chocolate in it till it becomes malleable; divide it into small balls, and place them on square pieces of paper, about three quarters of an inch from one another : shake the paper to fiatten them, and pass over them some white nonpareils, entirely to cover their sur- face ; when cold, take them off the papers.ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. 90 123. Chocolate Drops in Moulds, To make these you must have two sorts of moulds; one sort of thin copper^ tinned inside, about the eighth of an inch deep, representing some object, coat of arms, or device; the other flat, a simple sheet of metal the size of the first mould, having likewise some device upon it, and also tinned; the hollow mould to receive a small ball of prepared chocolate, and the flat one to cover it, which, being flattened between the two pieces, takes the form and impression on both sides; when the drop is cold, it conies out easily : it must be well impressed, and shining. 124. Vanilla Chocolate Drops. 1 lb. of Chocolate, 4 pods of Yanilla, 1 dr. of Cinnamon, 1 dr. of Cloves, \ gr. of Ambergris, 12 oz. of Sugar in powder. Pound the above articles in a metal mortar, with half a pound of sugar; sift the whole through a silk sieve, and mix it with the remainder of the sugar; put one pound of chocolate in an iron or metal mortar, first warmed, and pound it till it is melted, and your pestle sinks into it by its own weight; then add your other ingredients, and pound and mix the whole; the drops are to be dropped on paper, as in No. 122, except that they are to be small, as the drop No. 90, and without nonpareils. 125. Cocoa Nuts in Sugar, Take cocoa kernels, roasted as in No. 120. Then moisten with orange-flower water, or clear water, into which essence of cinnamon has been dropped, a sufiicient quantity of powdered sugar to form aITALIAN CONFECTIONER. 91 paste for drops.—(See No. 90.) Wrap the nuts in the paste, as pistachios (see No. 118), with or without nonpareils; they are also put in papers cut at both ends. 126. Catechu Seeds, Catechu comes from the West Indies^ and is a hard, dry, gummy paste, bitter to the taste at first, but leaving a pleasant sweetness : it tastes some- what like the iris or violet, and is made into drops. —(See No. 109.) To make catechu seeds_, soak two ounces of gum-dragon, well chosen (see No. 528), and put it to a pound of sugar, sifted through a silk sieve ; add half a pound of catechu in powder, also sifted through a silk sieve; the paste thus pre- pared, form it with your fingers into little grains, like oat seeds; dry it in the stove, and keep it in a box. 127. Flavoured Catechu Is made as above, with the addition of any essence you please; if rose or foreign flower water, dissolve the gum with it; for violet flavour, add iris in powder : ambergris, musk, cinnamon, and vanilla, must be all in powder, or you may use essences. SECTION V. Of Syrups- 128. Of Syrups, Syetjps are liquids of a certain consistence, which preserve the taste of the juice of the fruits and flowers of which they aj:e made; the finer theITALIAN CONFECTIONEK. 92 sugar used, the better^ for the preservation of the syrup depends on its quality^ and the degree of boiling. Some syrups will in time become mouldy, as that of mallows, which easily contracts a bad smell; this syrup requiring^ more than any other, to be boiled well; others, if done beyond a certain point, are subject to candy; it is therefore neces- sary to be particular, and not to bottle the syrup till quite cold; cork it well, and keep it in a dry place. 129. Orgeat Syrujo, 1 lb. of Sweet Almonds, 2 oz. of Bitter Almonds, 1 pint of Spring Water, 3 K»s. of Sugar. Take a pound of sweet almonds, and two ounces of bitter almonds, and put them into boiling water; when the skin peels off easily, put them into cold Water; then pick and throw them into fresh water; when finished, put them into a marble mortar, very clean, and pound them with the juice of a lemon, adding, from time to time, half a pint of spring water. When completely pounded, so as to leave no bits of the almonds, mix the paste with another half-pint of water, strain it through a cloth, which must be twisted by two persons, and receive the milk of almonds in a basin. Put back the paste in the cloth into the mortar, pound it again with a little more water, and strain it, and add it to the others; clarify three pounds of sugar, boil it to a crack (see No. 11) ; take your pan from the fire to add the milk of almonds, put it on the fire again, give it a boil up, and take it oif: keep stirring it round with a spaddle, or skimmer, till it is cold, which will prevent its dividing when bottled, as I have seen it at many confectioners^ in London.93 ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. Add a small glass of orange-flower water^ or half a drop of essence of naroli^ and strain it through a cloth^ which is essentially necessary to prevent its parting* 130. RaspherrT/ Symjp, 1 pint of Easpberry Juice, 2 lbs. of Sugar. Take red or ripe raspberries^ pick them clean^ mash them^ put them into a pan^ in a warm place, and let them ferment for two or three days ; after- wards draw off the juice, and filter it through blotting paper; to every pint of juice add two pounds of loaf-sugar, melting it on the fire, and taking care to skim it well, without boiling it, do it to a ]^earl (see No. 7) ; strain it through a cloth, let it cool, and, when cold, bottle it. 131. Currant 8ymjp. Currant syrup is made as the preceding; adding to the currants, when mashed and fermented, a few raspberries, according to your taste. 132. Morello-Cherry Syrup, ^ 1 ib. of Morellos, 2 lbs. of Sugar. Take one pound of ripe Morello cherries, mash them on a sieve, press the juice from them, and strain it through a flannel bag, till it is very clear; clarify two pounds of sugar (see No. 2), boil it to a crack (see No. 11), and add the juice to it. Put it on a gentle fire to melt the sugar, keep stirring it with a skimmer, and let it boil up once; skim it well, take it from the fire, and when quite cold, bottle it. 1ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. 133. Mulberry Syrup, 1 pint of Syrup, 1 pint of Juice. Obtain^ by pressure^ a pint of juice^ from very ripe mulberries; boil a pint of syrup to a crack (see No. 11)^ and pour in your juice; reduce it to ' a pearl (see No. 7); skim it^ let it cool, and bottle it. In England there are only three sorts of mul- berries : black, red, and white. In Italy there are seven kinds. 134. Barberry Syrup Is made in the same way as Morello syrup.—(See No. 132.) 135. Straivberry Syrup Is made in the same way as mulberry syrup.—(See No. 133.) 136. Raspberry "Vinegar Syrup, Take white or red raspberries, pick them very clean, mash them, and let them ferment (see No. 130); drain off the juice, and for every pint add two pints of vinegar : filter it, add three pounds of loaf-sugar, reduce it to 2ipearl,— (See No. 7.) Ob- serve to take white-wine vinegar, and fine loaf* sugar, to white raspberries. 137. Capillaire Syrup. 1 ib. of Sugar, 1 oz. of Capillaire. Capillaire (maidenhair) is a plant which grows \ on the sides of wells and fountains ; its stem is of a reddish purple, about fifteen inches long; it has i greenish leaves, obtuse, and dented on one sidej the best is that of Canada; you must make an in- >95 ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. ! fusion of it to obtain your syrup. I give these particulars^ as I find that what is generally sold in i London as capillaire, is only syrup, with orange- flower water in it. Take an ounce of capillaire, and put it into a small quantity of boiling water, to in- fuse, as you would tea; put a pound of sugar into I the infusion, and clarify it with the white of an egg; boil it to a ^earl (see No. 7) ; strain it through a cloth, and when cold, put in a little orange-flower water, and bottle it. 138, Lemon Syrup, 1 pint of Lemon Juice, 2 pints of Syrup, Take a pint of lemon juice, filter it through blotting paper; boil two pints of syrup to the little crack (see No. 11), and add the juice; put it ; on the fire, let it boil to a pearl (see No. 7), skim it, take it off the fire, let it cool, and then bottje it. 139. Coffee Syrup, j 1 pint of Coffee, 2 pints of Syrup. I Make a strong decoction of Mocha coflTee, very clear, to the amount of a pint; take two pints of syrup, boil it to a hall (see No. 10), and add the coffee; put it again on the fire, boil it to a pearl (see No. 7), and strain it through a cloth; bottle it when cold. 140. Wormwood Syrup, 1 oz. of Wormwood, 1 lb. of Sugar. Make nearly a pint of the infusion of worm- wood ; add to it a pound of loaf-sugar; clarify it (see No. 2), and boil it to ^pearl (see No. 7), when cold, bottle it.96 ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. 141. Marsh-Mallow Syriijp, Take two ounces of marsh-mallow roots, cut them into small pieces, bruise them in a mortar, and boil the mallows in a pint and a half of water, till reduced to a pint; then clear it, and add a pound of sugar, finishing it in the same way as capillaire.—(See No. 137.) 142. 8ymp of Pinks, ^Ib. of Pinks, lib. of Sugar. Pick off all the green parts from half a pound of pinks, put the flowers in a mortar, and pound them with a pint of boiling water; strain the decoction through a cloth; clarify one pound of loaf-sugar (see No. 2), boil it to a hall (see No. 10), and add I it to the decoction; put it again on the fire, and I boil it to a pearl (see No. 7). This syrup may also be made without pounding the flowers, only , boiling them with the sugar; when done, skim it, and strain it through a cloth. The dark-red vel- vety single-pink is the best for syrup. , 143. Violet Syrttp , Is made in the same way as the preceding, only ' leaving the flowers half a day in boihng water, in ;i a close and very warm place. The garden violet, of a dark colour, is the best for the confectioner, as its perfume is the strongest, and does not escape so soon in working. Syrup of roses is made the same as violet syrup. 144. A necessary observation uj^on all Syrups, The author has proved by experience, that gene- rally all syrups done in the lain marie, are, with*.ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. out doubt^ more perfect than those done upon the fire. The quantities in the mixture are the same; the difference only is, that, instead of using clarified, sugar, you must take double-refined crystallized white sugar, and put it in a glass with the juice of the fruit, decoction, or milk extracted from almonds: by putting this glass in water upon the fire, the sugar melts by the caloric of the water, and no I alteration of taste is produced. ' The glass being shut or corked, and the sugar being perfectly melted, the syrup is found done. The author has an instrument, which he obtained at Paris, called SLpese-sirop, or saccharometer, the same as the pese-liquors, or hydrometer; this is steeped in the syrup ; and, if at thirty-two degrees, lit is done to that consistence fit to keep. The I same instrument serves also to ascertain every de- gree of sugar j that is to say, to know what quan- tity of sugar is contained in the liquid; for in- stance, put the instrument into water, and it will mark 0 ; but if you add a small portion of syrup, it will mark the degree. This instrument is ex- tremely necessary when clarifying sugar with animal black, as we make use of it in the clarifi- cation, which assures us if it requires any more water, or no, at the point of ebullition, to bring it to its proper degree.98 ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. SECTION VI. Of Marmalades, or Jam. 145. Of Marmalades, Marmalades are a half-liquid preserve, made of the pulp of fruits, of a certain consistence; no marmalades can be well made without putting, at least, twelve ounces of sugar to a pound of fruit; they must also be boiled to a proper degree, as afterwards described. 146. Green Apricot Jam, lib. of Apricots, 1 lb. of Sugar. Put a small quantity of wood ashes in a pan with water, and boil it, taking care to skim off the small bits of charcoal which will swim on the top; then let it stand, and draw it off clear. Put it on the fire again, and, when boiling, throw in the little apricots to clear off their down; when the down comes off easily, take them off the fire, and put them into cold water to cool; when cool, put them into a cloth, and rub them clean. Another way. Take two handfuls of salt, put it into a towel, with your green apricots, and roll them in it till' the down comes off; put them into water to wash them, and then into second clean water on the fire: let them boil till you can crush them between your fingers; strain them, and pound them well in a mortar; pass them through a fine hair sieve with ! a spaddle; put the pulp into a pan on the fire, and ' dry it till you see the fruit begin to stick to theITALIAN CONFECTIONER. 99 bottom of the pan ; take it off, and weigh the con- tents^ and for every pound^ add a pound of loaf- sugar; clarify it^ boil it to a feather, ^ididi the pulp to it^ and boil it up two or three times, taking care to stir it, to prevent its burning to the bottom of the pan. You must then put it into pots, and keep it in a dry place. 147. Ripe Apricot Marmalade, 1 lb. of Apricot Pulp, 1 ib. of Sugar. Take ripe apricots, put them into boiling water, leave them a few minutes, then take them out, and extract the stones, and pass them through a hair sieve; weigh the pulp, and to every pound take a pound of loaf-sugar; clarify it, boil it to the great feather ; add your pulp, stirring and boiling it till it hangs on the spaddle like a jelly; take it from the fire, and add the kernels of the apricots which you use, previously blanched and dried. 148. Cherry Jam, 2 l^s. of Cherries, 1 lb. of Sugar. Choose two pounds of very ripe cherries, of a fine colour, take out the stones and stalks, put them into a pan on the fire, and reduce them nearly one half. Clarify two pounds of loaf-sugar, and boil it to the little crack; add the pulp, and mix it in well; put it back on the fire, and stir it with the spaddle : when you can easily see the bottom of the pan, you may be certain of its being done enough. g2ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. 100 149. Raspherr^ Jam, 1 ib. of Easpberries, 12 oz. of Sugar. Let your raspberries be fresh; clean them from the stalks and leaves ; mash and pass them through a splinter sieve^ and reduce them on the fire to half, like the cherries. Clarify twelve ounces of loaf-sugar, boil it to a hall, and mix it with the pulp; put it back on the fire, to boil up a few times; then put it into pots. 150. Plum Jam, 1 Bb. of Plum Pulp, 12 oz. of Sugar. Take plums of any kind you please; if they be not ripe enough to pass through a sieve, put them in boiling water on the fire, and let them boil till tender; then take them out, drain them, and pass them through a hair sieve; weigh the pulp, put it on the fire again, and reduce it to one half; to every pound of pulp, take twelve ounces of loaf- sugar ; clarify, and boil it to the little crack: add the pulp, continue to boil it, and stir it with a spaddle: when, on holding up the spaddle, you see the mixture fall ojff like a jelly, it is then done. 151. Pear Marmalade. 1 Bb. of Pears, 12 oz. of Sugar. Any pears may be used for marmalades: put them into boiling water, and let them boil a few minutes; then take them out, peel and cut them in pieces, put them back on the fire, and let them boil till tender; next pass them through a colander, by means of a wooden pestle; weigh the pulp, and101 ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. to every pound put twelve ounces of loaf-sugar; clarify and boil it to the little crack ; take it off, add the pulp^ mix it^ put it back on the fire, and boil it to the same consistence as apricot marma- lade.—(See No. 147.) 152. Orange Marmalade, 1 Tb. of Seville Oranges, 1 lb. of Loaf-sugar. Take Seville oranges^ and squeeze the juice through a sieve; put the peels into water, boil them till quite soft, and throw them on a hair sieve to drain; clean them from the pulp, and cut them in pieces, then pound them, with the juice, in a mortar, quite fine; pass them through a fine hair sieve ; weigh it, and for every pound of fruit, clarify a pound of loaf-sugar, boil it to the large feather; take it off, mix them well, and put it back on the fire. Let it boil till it becomes a jelly- dropping from the spaddle, like plum marmalade (see No. 150); then put into pots, and keep it in a very dry place. 153. Feach Jam, 1 lb. of Peach Pulp, 12 oz. of Sugar. Peel and take out the stones of your peaches, put them for a moment into boiling water, but not on the fire; drain them, and pass them through a sieve: weigh the pulp, and for every pound, take twelve ounces of loaf-sugar; clarify it, and boil it to a feather; then add the pulp, first reduced to one half, as cherries (see No. 148); mix them well together, and let them boil for five minutes; it is then fit to be put into pots.102 ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. 154. Barherry Jam, 1 ib. of Barberries, 1 fc. of Sugar.

Black Currant Jam, 1 lb. of Black Currants, 12 oz. of Sugar. Pick the currants clean from the stalks, put them on the fire with a little water, till they are quite mashed; then pass them through a hair sieve, and weigh the pulp; put it on the fire, reduce it as above, and take for every pound, twelve ounces of loaf-sugar; clarify it, and boil it to a crack; mix the whole, and boil it till it becomes of the con- sistence of a jelly, which will be proved by the spaddle, as in apricot marmalade.—(See No. 147.) Red Currant Jam is made in the same manner. 156. Pine-A^ple Marmalade, Take off the outside of the pine, cut the fruit in pieces, pound it in a mortar, and pass it through a hair sieve; weigh the pulp, and take for every pound one pint of syrup; boil it to a blow, add the pulp, and boil it till it jellies, like apricot marma- lade.—(See No. 147.)103 ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. SECTION VII. Of Jellies. 157. Of Jellies. Jelly is composed of the juice of fruits^ mixed with sugar^ but it is not every kind of fruit that will make a jelly; such only as are mucilaginous, as currants, apples_, black currants^ cherries, apri- cots, &c., being used for this purpose. You must take it as a general rule, that every jelly takes three quarters of a pound of sugar for one pound of juice. A fine sparkling white sugar may be used without being clarified. Syrup clarified and boiled to the crach, is recommended only when common sugar is used: the latter is more profitable for those in business. 158. Currant Jelly, Take any quantity of currants you please, pass them through a splinter or cane sieve, and put them on the fire, stirring them with a spaddle, till they begin to boil; then pass them through a flannel bag to clear the juice; measure your jelly, and take an equal quantity of syrup, boil it to a crach, put in the juice, and let it boil, till you see, by dipping your skimmer in the jelly, and again raising it, the jelly forms a web upon it, which, if boiled enough, will remain on the skimmer. Take it off* the fire, let it stand a few minutes, till the scum has settled on the surface, which must be removed with a skimmer, and it is then fit to put in your pots. When cold, cut pieces of paper to the size of your pots, and steep them in brandy, to cover the jelly.104 ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. 159. Cherry Jelly, Take the required quantity of cherries^ pick off the stalks^ and take out the stones^ and add a fourth part of currants : make it as in No. 158. 160.

That which you run out on plates, after remaining twenty-four hours in the stove, may be cut in rings, or fillets to form knots, or any other form you please. When wanted for candy, or any other purpose, it may be coloured I by adding a little liquid carmine to the pulp before you mix it with the sugar. Dry the articles in a stove. 167. Quince Paste. Quince paste is made in the same manner as the preceding : it may be made of different colours; and is cut in fillets, to form different shapes.ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. 106 168. Currant Fade. Take a quantity of currants, pass them through a hair sieve to take out the seeds^ reduce them on the fire^ stirring it all the time with a spaddle; when you see the pulp forms a. paste, take it off, and weigh it: to a pound and a quarter of reduced juice, add a pound and a half of loaf-sugar; clarify it, and boil it to a feather; mix the whole, boil it up, and put it into moulds, or spread it out thin on tin plates, and cut it according to the purpose for which you may want it, as apple paste.—(See No. 166.) 169. Cherry 'Paste. Take some cherries, quite ripe, clear them from the stalks and stones, put them in a pan on the fire, and boil them for a little time; take them off and pass them through a hair sieve, by the help of a spaddle ; weigh the pulp, and to every pound add a pound of loaf-sugar; clarify it, and boil it to the feather; having reduced the cherries to a paste, mix it with the sugar with the spaddle; put it again on the fire till it boils, and pour it into moulds or on tin plates, and let it dry in the stove; when dried on one side take it from the moulds, and dry the other side on a sieve. 170. Ajpricot Paste, Take ripe apricots, put them into boiling water, boil them two or three minutes to soften them, and pass them through a hair sieve; put back the pulp into the pan to reduce it, stirring it with a spaddle lest it should burn to the bottom; when brought to a pulpy consistence, take it from the fire, weighITALIAN CONFECTIONER. 107 it, and to every pound of pulp put half a pound of loaf-sugar, clarify it, and boil it to a feather; add the pulp, put it back on the fire to boil for a minute, and when you find your paste drop off easily from the spaddle, take it from the fire, fill your moulds, and dry it as before; or you may make papers plaited on pieces of wood, to the required shape, and fill and dry them in the stove in the same way; when dry, you must wet the papers to take jout the paste.

Black Currant Faste, or Brops. This is made in the same way as red currant paste (see No. 168), except that when the paste is cold it must be put into a bladder, and forced through the pipe, like macaroons, to form small drops; lay it on tin plates, slightly buttered, and put them in a warm stove; when dry enough, de- tach them with the blade of a knife, and put them! on a sieve to finish drying.ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. 109 177.

Continue to stir the mixture, to prevent its sticking to the pan, which would entirely spoil your paste. You will know when it is done, if, on applying some of the paste to the back of your hand, it does not stick : this mode of making it is rather tedious, but it is the best. Add to your paste a drop of essence of naroli, or a glass of orange-flower water; when finished, powder a marble slab with starch-powder, on which you must flatten your paste; when cold, you may cut it into long strips ; then put it in boxes, well powdered with starch, that it may not stick together. 178. Liquorice Paste Is made like the preceding. You must cut into little pieces a pound of stick-liquorice, and boil it * Marsh-Mallow is not used on account of its unpleasant taste; apple juice is equally good, and possesses the same healing qualities: if it be wished, however, to use marsh- mallow, the necessary quantity is half a pound, taking care that the roots be quite fresh.ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. 110 in a sufficient quantity of water to dissolve a pound of gum Senegal; add to the liquorice half a dozen apples (rennets)^ and a handful of pearl barley; draw off the decoction^ dissolve the gum in it^ and add half a pound of sugar; finish as for marsh- mallow paste. 179.

Of Preserved Fruits. 181. Of Treserved Fruits, I The ancients preserved their fruits in honey, of which they distinguished three sorts : the common honey, or honey from flowers; the honey-dew, gathered in abundance on Mount Libanus, by the Arabs; and honey from reeds, nearly the same as our sugar. Preserves are dry or moist, and are made accordingly, some with half, and some with full sugar. They should be kept in a dry place, but not too warm, because too much heat will cause them to ferment. If the place be damp, the preserves will become musty; some also that have the full quantity of sugar will candy; in this case a small quantity of pulverized alum, dissolved in a spoonful of water, must be put into the syrup. 182.

The next day you must drain the syrup from the cherries^ put it on the fire_, and boil it to 2i pearl; put your cherries in again^ and boil them up several times: Ao this four days runnings boiling them a degree more each day; on the fifth day drain them, and boil your sugar to the little hloiv ; put in your cherries, and give them a boil over; put the cherries and syrup into pots^ but do not fill - them quite, that you may cover them with currant jelly, which will form a smooth and transparent gloss on the cherries; when the fruit is cold^ cover the pots with paper. 183. Dried Cherries. 1 Tb. of Cherries, | lb. of Sugar. Stone and pick your cherries ; take half a pound of sugar to a pound of fruit, and put the cherries in a pan, a layer of cherries, a layer of powdered sugar, and so on; let them stand three days, then pour the mixture into a copper pan, and boil it up five or six times; let it cool, take them out of the syrup, drain them, and spread them thin on hair fi sieves; put them in a hot stove to dry, turning i them on clean sieves every eight hours till dry. i You must observe, that to obtain cherries to keep a fine colour, you must use the Kentish; they must be gathered when they begin to turn red, before ' they are ripe. If you like, you can use syrup,' instead of powdered sugar. jITALIAN CONFECTIONER. 113 I 184. Whole Cherries. 1 fb. of Cherries, 1 lb. of Sugar.

Dried Cherries in Bunches, Choose cherries of equal size, and form them into bunches, by tying the stalks with iron binding- wire ; boil some syrup to a blow, and put your bunches into it, boiling them over several times; take them from the fire, pour them into an earthen pan, the next day boil them over again a few times; when cold, drain and dry them in the stove, on sieves, with a moderate heat. These cherries are excellent to make cherry-water, for balls or evening parties. Pound them in a mortar, in bunches as they are; dissolve them with spring water; add some lemon-juice; press it through a flannel bag, and it is fit to drink. 186.

Green Apricots, joared, Wet, Take apricots as above, and with a pen-knife pare them, throwing them, as you do them, into cold water; blanch them (see No. 186); let them cool in the water in which they are blanched, and when your fruit is cold, put it, with the same water, oa a slow fire for a short time, to make it green; but take care that the water does not boil, only simmer, at most: when the head of a pin will easily go through them, take out your apricots, put them into cold water, and preserve them as before.ITALIAN CONFECTIONEK. 115 188. ^ijpe Apicots, Wet.^ Take apricots, neither too ripe nor too green, and if they are to be whole, cut a small slit near the stem, and push out the stone; put them into boiling water to blanch, but mind they do not break, which will be the case if you blanch them too much; take out the apricots as they rise on the water, put them into cold water, and drain them on a sieve. Take some syrup, boil it to a featAer, and put in gently as many of your apricots as will swim; boil them up a few times, skim them, and put them in an earthen pan; the next day strain the syrup fronx the fruit, and add to it a small quantity of fresh syrup ; boil and skim it till it comes to the small pearl; put your apricots into it, let your syrup boil all over them, skim and put them back into your pan, and repeat this the third day; the fourth day your syrup must be boiled to the small blow ; put in your apricots, boil them up a few times, skim them very carefully, put them by in dry pans, keep them for use, and dry them when required. 189.

The stone must be taken out through a small incision near the stem.—(See No. 188). If, when preserved whole, you want to fill them, wash the syrup off with warm water, and put in plums, dried cherries, raspberries, or any other fruit, with one of the kernels peeled. Dry them in the stove. 191, Apricots preserved without Fire, Take very ripe apricots, cut them in halves, take out the stones, and put a layer of them in a pan; take white sugar-candy, pound and sift it fine, and powder your apricots with it, forming a layer of apricots and a layer of sugar. You must put a pound and a half of sugar-candy to a pound of fruit j let your pan stand in the sun for four days, and stir the fruit three or four times a day; then put them in pots. Apricots preserved this way taste better than when preserved by boiling, and they will keep equally well. 192. Raspberries J Wet, Take raspberries, which must be very clean, and as much clarified sugar as will swim your fruit, boil it to a blow, and let the fruit boil up ten or a , dozen times : take it from the fire, skim it well, and put it into a pan.

Clarify some double-refined sugar, boil it to the little thread, let it cool, and pour it over your nuts. Continue to drain the syrup from them for five : days, putting it on the fire each day to increase its : degree, yet it must not boil, as it would blacken it; each day you must add a little fresh syrup, to re- place that which is imbibed by the nuts. The fifth day, for the last time, your sugar must boil to the great pearl; when it is getting cold, pour it on your nuts, as directed before, cover your pan, and keep them till you want to dry and use them.lis ITALIAN CONFECTIONEE. 195.

Continue to stir them; when they are green, in- crease the fire, and when they begin to swim, take them out and put them into cold water, which should be ready for the purpose; renew the water several times, that the gages may be quite cold; drain them on sieves. Take some syrup and boil it to the little tliread; put the fruit into it, and let it boil up a few times; skim it well, and let the gages remain in the syrup for four days; drain the fruit off every day, and put the syrup to boil a degree, and skim and pour, it over the fruit.

The next day drain off the syrup, boil it a degree more, and pour it over your chips; re- peat the same the third day; the fourth day you must boil the syrup to the great ^earl, and add some fresh syrup, as you see necessary; put in your chips, and give them another boil: they are now fit for use. If you wish to candy them, drain them two or three hours before on a sieve, or you may put some in rock candy_, which you must dry in the stove the day before, and afterwards turn them round on your finger. 206. Orange Chips Are made in the same manner as lemon chips. 207. Angelica. Choose some fine tender Angelica stems, and having cut them into proper lengths, of from six to eight inches, put them in water on the fire: when ready to boil, take it off, and let it stand for an hour, it will then be soft enough to allow the fila- ments and the upper skin to be drawn out with a knife; as you do them, put them into cold water;124 ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. next boil them till they look whitish^ then take them off, and put in a handful of salt; let them cool in the water; when cold^ take them out and throw them into cold water; drain them^ boil your syrup to a thread (see No. 6), and preserve them as green gages.— (See No. 195.) 208. CJiesnuts. Take any quantity of ehesnuts you wish to pre- serve^ take off the rind with a knife, and throw them as you do them into a pan of cold water; when done, put them on the fire, and blanch them; then take off carefully their inside skin, and put them into another pan, with an extremely light syrup; that is to say, just sweetened : put your pan by the side of the fire, and then let them just simmer for a ^vhole day, taking care not to let them boil;. adding to them, from time to time, a little syrup. The next day continue the same operation, till your, syrup comes to a good consistence, so as to keep; when you wish to make use of your ehesnuts, take them out of the syrnp, and put them to drain; then put in a small copper pan a small quantity of syrup; boil it to a Mow, then take it off, and when rather cold, work it against the edges of your pan, with a spaddle, till it becomes brilliant; then dip your ehesnuts in, take them out, and put them to drain on a wire ; then put them to dry a few minutes in a stove. They ought to be very brilliant, and great precaution is required in preserving them. 209. Green Hops, Wet, ^ Choose some of the finest green gooseberries, and with a penknife slit them across down to the stem^ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. 125 and take out the seeds; then have a needle and white thread, making a knot at the end, and take one of your prepared gooseberries, and pass your needle through the stem end; then take another, and so on, till you have formed a resemblance of the hops, then fasten off your thread. Put them in a pan of cold water, with a handful bf salt, and let them stand all night; the next day put them in a pan of fresh water, and then on the fire to blanch ; them, till quite tender; drain them off, and preserve i them as green apricots.—(See No. 186.) 210. Whole Pine Apple, I Break off the top and stem of your pines, trim them well, and prick them all over with a fork, then I put them into a pan of water, and boil them till tender; take them out and put them into cold water; when cold, drain them quite dry, and put them in a glass jar, or a pan; take syrup enough to cover them, boil it to a thread, and pour it on your pines; let them stand two or three days, then drain off your syrup, boil it a degree more, skim it well, and pour it over your pines ; repeat this three days more, adding some new syrup as the pines imbibe the first quantity; the sixth day you must boil your sugar to the great pearl, then put in your pines, and give them a boil up; take them off, skim them well, and put them in dry pans for use. 211. Fine Apple Chips. Cut your preserved pine apples in slices, half an inch thick, wash them in warm water, and place them on hair sieves, so as they do not touch each other; sift some fine-powdered sugar over them^ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. 126 and put them in the stove for four days ; turn and sift some more sugar over them every day; when dry, put them in boxes, with white paper between each layer. 212. Green Gooseherries, Take large green gooseberries, prick them, and run a penknife through them, then put them on the fire in a pan of water^ with a handful of salt; stir them till they rise on the water, then take them out, and throw them into cold water; when cold, drain and preserve them like green apricots.— (See No. 186.) 213. Cucumbers or GherJoins, Choose some fresh and very green cucumbers, free from specks, and prick them all over with a fork, put them on the fire in a pan of water, with a handful of salt, let them boil till quite tender, take them out, throw them into cold water, drain and preserve them as the green gages.—(See No. 195.) 214. Damsons, Wet, Fill your preserving-pan half full of syrup, boil it to a thread: put in as many damsons as will swim in the syrup, warm them on a slow fire till they burst, then take them off, and let them stand till the next day. Drain off the syrup, add, if necessary, some fresh syrup, boil it to a strong, thread, skim it well, and then put in your damsons; give them a boil rounds and let them stand till the next day; drain ofi* the syrup, and boil it to the large joearl; boil your fruit in it a few minutes, and- then put it in dry pans, for use. "127 ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. 215. Mogul Plums,^ Take moguls^ neither too ripe nor too green_, that is^ when they begin to turn yellow prick them all over with a fork, and put them into cold water; put them on the fire with sufficient water so that they do not rub against one another, add a handful of salt, and stir them till they are tender; you must be very careful, as they will soon go to pieces and spoil; take them out, and put them into cold water : when cold, drain and preserve them, as in No. 195. 216. Currants in Bunches,\ Take the finest red or white currants you can get, open them on one side, and take out the seeds with a needle, and tie as many of them together by the stalk, with red thread, as will form a pretty bunch; weigh them, and for every pound of fruit take one pound and a half of clarified sugar (see No. 2); boil it to the great ^earl; put in your bunches of currants, and boil them all over well; take them off, let them stand five minutes, and skim them well. Repeat this twice more; you will know when they are done, as the syrup boils exactly like the currant jelly.—(See No. 158.) * The plum should melt in the mouth, should be sweet, and have a little perfume in its flavour. There are twenty sorts of plums: Early Morocco, Early Damask, Orleans, Green Gage, Primordian, Black Damask, La Royale, Great Damask, Egg Plum, Apricot Plum, Catherine, Eed Imperial, Drap d'Or, Imperatrice, Damson, Wine Sour, Violet, Per- drigon, Blue Gage, Bullace, and Mirabelle Plums. t The white currants possess the same qualities as the red, and are generally larger. The different kinds are, White Grape, Common White, Common Red, Champagne, and Black Currants.128 ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. 217. On Candying Fruit, J The fruit you mean to candy must be taken from { its syrup^ washed clean in lukewarm water^ and [ dried in the stove; for^ without that precaution, i the candy would not adhere to the fruit. Boil I some syrup to a hlow, and put in your fruit; but i as they will lessen the degree of your syrup, boil it | up till it is at the How again ; then take the pan off i the fire, let it stand a few minutes, and grain your | sugar by rubbing the inside of the pan with a skimmer; when the sugar begins to whiten, take your fruit separately, and stir it into the white part; take the fruit out with a fork, and place it on a wire grating, over a pan to drain: it dries. \ directly, and remains brilliant. A strong solution Tj of gum Arabic added when you grain the sugar,', will improve your fruit, and keep its lustre for a J... long time. 218. Clear CaJces. Take any kind of jelly (see A^ple Jelly^ No. 162, and following numbers) ; but for this purpose it i must not be so much boiled as usual, because a I crust or candy on the surface is requisite. When the jelly is boiled, whether red or white, put it into pots about the depth of half an inch more or less, and place them in the stove of a proper heat (see. No. 220); leave them for a day, and then see. \ whether a crust be formed on the surface; if so,' carefully take the cakes out with a knife, by turn- ing it close to the pot; then lay them on plates of tin, extremely clean : they may be cut into any \ shape you please, as ovals, squares, lozenges, &c. then put them back into the stove, that they may \129 ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. form a crust all over; take them from tlie tin when firm, and finish drying them on sieves in the stove: they are now fit to candy.— (See Candied Jelly, No. 30.) They may also be used without candying, for garnishing, and for various purposes. SECTION X. The Stove, and Degree of SEeat. 219. The Stove, This is indispensable, and it is equally important jfor the confectioner that he should study the dif- ferent degrees of heat, so as to proportion the exact heat necessary for a particular article by the ther- Imometer. A drying stove must always be heated by another external stove, the flues of which should cross it at the bottom, the stove being put against the back of it. The flues should lay inside, and be placed in the angles, to give the stove an equal and continued heat, which heat may be regulated by increasing and diminishing the quantity of fire in the outside siove; the drying stove is thus kept clean, and free from the least dust, which could not be the case were it heated with charcoal, or any other fuel fire, placed inside for that purpose. These stoves must have iron bars to support the sieves, plates, wire-gratings, or any other thing put to dry on them. The door of the stove must shut close, and the whole stove must be close, and fire-proof; two circular openings, three or four inches over, at the side, having each their little door, must be made, to let out and evaporate the excess of heat; they must be near the top. AITALIAN" CONFECTIONER. Reaumur's thermometer must be placed withinside, to ascertain the proper degree of heat. 220. Degree of Keat, This must be regulated according to the nature of the confectionery exposed to it: Degrees Sugar Candy, at eight days 90 Candy in three or four hours 100 When it drains, to facilitate and dry the candy . . 120 Dry fruit, such as cherries, strawberries, &c. (more heat would make them black) .... 80 The finest biscuits, iced, white or coloured ... 80 Comfits, to whiten them during their making, from 70 to 75 Liqueur Drops 80 Blanched Almonds, whether to use whole, or to pre- serve for winter 70 In summer^ the almonds may be dried in the air, as too much heat will occasion them to separate. Observe, that the degree of heat is always stronger at the top of the stove, than in any other part. SECTION XI. ' Of Tablets, and Rock Sugrar. 221. Conserve Tablets, These are wrought sugar, made in the form of a tablet; they contain a part of the pulp of fruits, or are flavoured with essences. They are agreeable to the taste, and serve as an ornament to assiettcB piontees for the dessert.ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. i 222. Orange-Mower Tahlets, 2Bos. of double-refined Sugar, Jib. of Orange-Flowers. Clarify, and boil to the large feather, two pounds of doiible-refined loaf-sugar; take half a pound of picked orange-flowers, cut them up with a knife, not very small, wetting them with lemon-juice, to preserve their whiteness; then throw them into your sugar, and boil it up again to the degree just : mentioned. Take the pan from the fire, let the mixture rest for a few minutes, and then work it with a spaddle, rubbing it round the edges of the pan : when you observe a bright icy appearance on the surface, stir in the middle with the* spaddle, and pour it in a paper formed as a large case. Mark the cake with the point of a knife, of the size you intend your tablets to be, and, when cold, it will easily break in the proper pieces. 223. Fruit Tahlets. \ a. of Fruit, 2 lbs. of Sugar. Take any fruit in season, and make half a pound of pulp (see Fruit Paste, No. 165); boil tw^o pounds of sugar, as directed in the preceding article, and finish them in the same manner. 224. Flower and Essence Tallets Are made in the same manner as the orange-flower tablets (see No. 222), using what flowers or essence you please, as roses, violets, pinks, &c.; pound them in a marble mortar, adding the juice of a lemon. l2ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. ]32 225. PistacJiio Tablets. \ fe. of Pistachios, 2 lbs. of Sugar. Put into boiling water half a pound of pistachio kernels^ when the skins will easily come off; then take them off the fire^ throw them into cold water^ and strip off all the skins; pound them quite fine in a marble mortar_, very clean^ with some juice of spinach^ to make them green; when completely levigated^ proceed as for the other tablets. 226. Almmd Tablets Are made in the same way as the preceding. Be- fore the almonds are used they may be put into an oven, just long enough to colour them, as it im- proves their taste; they must be pounded with orange-flower water. 227. Chocolate Tablets. Two ounces of chocolate and one pound of sugar prepared as above, the chocolate being previously dissolved in a very small quantity of warm water. 228. ^och Sugar. Take double-refined sugar in proportion to the rock sugar you wish to make; clarify it, let it rest; then take small quantities, according to the colours you want; put into a very clean pan some whites of eggs, but leave no particle of the yolk, which would spoil your work; add some double- refined sugar, pounded and sifted through a silk sieve, make an iceing of it, or what the confectioners call a royal iceing^ and work it as long as possible with a little wooden spaddle; dividing it into fourITALIAN CONFECTIONER. 133 or six little pots^ according to the colours you wish I to have^ and then add the colours (see Colours, No. j 558) ; put some more sugar, to make it as firm as . it was before. When ready, put the syrup on the I fire in a pan, boil it to the little crack, take the pan from the fire, put in about the size of a walnut of this iceing with your spaddle, and mix it with your sugar, turning it round very quickly without stop- ping ; the sugar will rise directly, then let it fall, I and when it rises the second time, pour it into ^ I hair sieve, keeping the sieve covered a moment with your pan, that it may not fall, or become flat. In making rock sugar, much depends on the exact de- gree of heat, the quickness of the work, and light- ness of the iceing. 229. Mushroom, in Rock Sugar. The mushroom in rock sugar is a great ornament to the table. It must have a stand or pedestal, made of pasteboard, which may be of any form you please, as a pyramid, or two drums, placed the one above the other, the upper one being smallest, and fitted with a hollow tube projecting from its centre, to receive the stalk of the mushroom. The three pieces of this frame-work must be held together, |! and may be ornamented according to fancy, either I in gum paste, gold, or silver, and the steps of the I pyramid, or drums, must be made wide enough to i contain difierent articles of dessert. To make a mushroom, you must have a tin mould of that shape, opening in the middle with hinges.— {Seeplate I. Jig. 15.) Commence in the same manner as for rock sugar, pouring the sugar into the mould instead of a sieve ; it must be linedITALIAN CONFECTIONER. with buttered paper^ cut out at the top^ and cover- ing the whole of the upper part of the mould; the moulds are about eight inches diameter at the head^ and the stem about ten inches long^ and two and a half in diameter; place a nosegay in it when you serve it up. 230. Vases in BocJc Sugar, Vases have a pretty effect on a table filled with flowers_, and ornamented with gum paste^ with pedestals made of pasteboard, ornamented in the same manner, or in gold or silver. You must have plaster moulds, hardened with drying oil, or, if not hardened, dip them in cold water, and there let them remain a quarter of an hour while you pre- pare the sugar; wipe them well with a sponge, and put your sugar in them as directed.— (See Rock Sugar, No. 228.) The moisture of the mould is forced out by the heat of the sugar, which detaches itself easier than by any other means. Baskets, perfuming pans, pyramids, and figures, are all made in the same way. 231. Eggs in RocJc Sugar, Make moulds which open in two equal parts, shaped on large eggs; place them on a table, and take sugar prepared as at No. 228, and fill one half of each mould, while your assistant closes them instantly and completely. They are very light, and look very natural. 232. Eggs in Grained Sugar, To make egg-shells as thin as natural ones, take moulds in lead, or plaster moulds, dipped in water,135 ITALIAN CONFECTIONED. 'or sulphur moulds slightly oiled^ opening in two^ and run one side in grained sugar^ as for bon-bons (see No. 64) ; another person must instantly close it, turning it round in his hands till the sugar has taken all round the moulds inside; there must be a person to every two moulds, as only one can be turned in the hand at a time; the egg comes out whole, having neither opening nor seam; it is empty and transparent, nor can any one imagine how it is made. Fruit, or anything else, may be 1 imitated in the same manner. If you choose to break one end of the egg, it may be filled with yellow cream, to represent the yolk of a boiled egg. SECTION XII. Of Compotes. 233. Compotes, Compotes are served up in compotiers, with a thin syrup, as an accompaniment to ices. All sorts of fruits are prepared as if to be preserved, except that I they are not boiled so much : in winter, you must . use preserves^ which must be taken from their own syrup to be put into a thinner one, with the juice of a lemon. The fruit preserved in bottles is pre- ferable. You must observe, that every compote in general, particularly when there is company, ought to be covered with apple jelly, which you must run as thin as paper on a common white plate, which may be done a few days before it is required for use. These sorts of jelly keep well, but when they are too old, they lose their trans-136 ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. parency^ which can be recovered by melting' the S superficial part in a little warm water. To take it ' from the plate^ you must lay over the jelly a piece ^ of blotting paper; by that means^ the jelly will ^ adhere to the paper and leave the plate. Lay that ! jelly over your compote_, and with a camel's-hair t brushy dipped in cold water^ passed over the blotting i paper_, will cause it to leave the jelly fixed on the !' compote, of course taking away the paper. i When there is a large dinner, the compotes ; ought to be ornamented ; if cleverly executed, they i have a beautiful effect on the table. Choose fresh \ flowers of the most showy colours : with a small ] cutter shape them into little flowers to form a garland, or bouquets ; place them round your fruit i with the point of a small knife; for the green i leaves, use preserved angelica; for the stocks, cin- namon, softened in water : barberries and the skins of red apples are sometimes useful. 234. Green Apricot Compote, Blanch and prepare green apricots as for pre- serves (see No. 186); when blanched, take them from the fire, cover them with a napkin, to make them recover their green colour, and throw them into cold water, draining them on a sieve. Take fine clarified sugar, and make it boil, put in the apricots, and let the syrup cover them; boil them up, take them from the fire, and let them imbibe the sugar for four or five hours; drain them, boil the syrup to the great thready and put the fruit, covered with the syrup, into a pan; when cold, you may serve them up in compotiers. Observe, that they will not keep many days, except theyj . ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. 137 are boiled every other day; they are made as above only to be used immediately^ or the next day at furthest. 235. Green Almond Compote. i The almonds intended for the compote must be 1 so tender that a pin will easily go through them. I It is made in the same way as the preceding. 1 236. Green Gooselerry Comjoote, Open your gooseberries, and take out the seeds, I blanch them in water, and put them on the fire I without boiling them ; as soon as they rise on the I water take them off, and let them stand to cool before you drain them; when drained, proceed as for green apricot compote. No. 234. 237. Cherry Comjoote, Take some fine cherries, cut off half the stalks and wash them in cold water, and let them drain. Boil some syrup to a pearl, put in your cherries, and boil them on a strong fire, letting them boil up five or six times, as red fruit preserves its colour best by a great heat. Take them from the fire, move them a little with a spaddle, let them cool, and put them in the compotiers. You may take the stones out if you please. 238. Raspberry Compote. Choose some fine, clean, and ripe raspberries; wash them, boil some syrup to a hlow, and put in the raspberries, and take them off again almost instantly, as they must not be suffered to boil. Leave them in the syrup four or five hours, putITALIAN CONFECTIONER. 138 them on the fire again, and warm them till they are near boiling; afterwards let them cool, and put them in your compotiers, 239. Currant Compote, You may use either red or white currants; take out the seeds, and put the fruit into cold water, draining it on a sieve; boil some syrup to 2ifeathery throw in the currants, and let them boil up two or three times; take them off, skim them perfectly clean, then let them stand to cool, and serve then^ up in compotiers. , 240. Rijpe Apricot Compote. '[ Take some very fine apricots, peel them, divide them into halves, and take out the stones; prick them all over with a large needle, and blanch theni carefully; press each singly between your fingerSj to squeeze out the water; put them in the syrup, and finish them as above. 241. Whole Apricot Compote, Make a small cut near the stalk of the apricot, take out the stones, prick them all over, blanch them, and carefully press them as above ; put thera in syrup, and finish as before. / \ 242. Phm Compote. Prepare your plums like the mirabelles (See No. 196); but if green, as in No. 195, put them in the syrup, and let it cover them; they must boil up two or three times. Leave the plums in the syrup a day, or till evening; boil them up again all over^139 ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. and skim them well; let them cool^ and they are j then fit to serve up. 243. Peach Compote, iPut the fruit into boiling water^ take off the skins^ and stone them^ and finish as for apricots. 244. Pear Compote. [ If the pears be small you need not cut them: I the large ones must be cut in half. Boil them in water till they are soft to the touch, pare them clean, scrape the stalk, and put them in cold water; 1 drain them, and put them into syrup boiled to a thread; boil them on a strong fire till they are perfectly done; if the syrup be not sufficiently reduced, take out your pears and boil up the syrup^ I and let it cool; put the pears into the syrup, and serve it up. If you wish the pears to be white, put the juice of a lemon into the syrup while boiling. The lemon flavour is very agreeable in almost every compote. 245. Broiled Pair Compote. I Put the pears on the live coals of a very bright fire, that the skins may broil; when done, take them off with the tongs, and throw them into cold water; rub off the skin, or burnt parts, with a clotli^ put them in syrup, and finish as above. 246. Pear Compote, with Wine, Choose very ripe pears, peel them, and cut them in halves; put them in a silver pan, with a glass of good wine, and some pulverized sugar and cin- namon -J let them boil, and reduce the syrup; when140 ITALIAN CONFECTTONEK. I done, take them off, and put them into a silver i eompotier, and cover it with your pan^ to make i them a fine colour. 247. Apple Compote. Take fine apples and cut them in two^ peel them, I take out the core^ put them into cold water^ take them out^ and put them into a thin syrup^ bou them till they are soft, and then put them into th^' compotiers; strain the syrup through a silk sievd.'j and then add it to your apples. ; | 248, Apple Compote in Jelly, Prepare your apples as for the preceding; cut some into small bits, according to the quantity ofi compote you wish to make, and put them, witl]i| the halves, into a very thin syrup. When th^i halves are tolerably soft, put them into the com- potiers, and reduce the small pieces with the syrup; if the syrup be not of a sufficient jelly, strain it through a sieve, and boil it to a proper consistence (see No. 157); then pour it over your apples. . ' 249. Stuffed Apple Compote, j. Prick your apples with the point of a knife, mak€| a hole through them, take out the cores withom breaking them, fill them with marmalade of apri- cots, and bake them, taking care to stop the hole with a piece of apple. 250. (Quince Compote, j Cut your quinces into quarters, peel them, take out the cores, blanch them quite tender, and put.ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. 141 them into cold water^ and let them drain; put them into your syrup, boil them up five or six times^ and they are finished. 251. Nut Compote, Prepare and blanch your nuts as directed in No. 194^ put them in the syrup, and let them simmer on the fire without boiling; leave them five i or six hours in the syrup, then put them again on the fire, and let them simmer; when cold, put them in the compotier. 252. Barherry Compote. Take some fine barberries, very ripe, pick them from the stalks, throw them into syrup boiled to a blow ; boil them up five or six times, and then pour them into the compotiers. 253. Chesnut Compote, Eoast your chesnuts, peel them clean, and flatten them a little with your hands; put them in syrup, and warm them a little on the fire, that the syrup may penetrate ; add a little lemon juice, and some lemon chips, and put them in the compotiers; sprinkle them over with powdered sugar, and glaze them with a salamander. ' 254. Strawlerry Compote, The strawberry is naturally so delicious a fruit, that it seldom requires the art of the confectioner. To make this compote, put the strawberries in the compotiers, and pour over them a raspberry or currant jelly, boiling hot. I IITALIAN CONFECTIONER. 142 255. Elder-Flower Compote, Make a very strong decoction of elder-flowers, strain it through a silk sieve, and use it to boil some apples in (which you must have previously peeled^' and cut in small pieces), free from speck or blemish; stir them with your spaddle, and make them into a kind of apple paste, or marmalade, and add sugar to the reduced pulp. When of the proper con- sistence, put the marmalade into a silver compotier, and cover it with a stewing pan, upon the top of which you put some live coals, to give it a fine crust, without making it red hot, or burning it. This compote may be decorated with jellies of dif- ferent colours. 256. Compote of Orange Peel, Peel some fine China oranges, take ofi" the white or pith very clean, and cut the peels up as fine as vermicelli; blanch them, put them in a sieve to drain, then put them in syrup, and boil them up five or six times. 257. Orange Compote Is made without boiling the oranges; they are only to be peeled, cut in slices, the core taken out j add some syrup, or sugar in powder, and the juice of an orange. Some persons object to finding any part of the core; to prevent that, the inside of the- orange must be carefully separated in each division, taking ofi* the thin skins; place them in circles round your compotiers; add some pine-apple syrup> with a glass of rum; cover it with your apple jelljr as the other : this compote is much approved of.143 ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. 258. Mashed Comjootes Include all such as have been mentioned; covered or masked with a red or white jelly^ which is to be made as directed in No. 157. It is to be run very thin on a silver dish^ and then suffered to cool. When you wish to use it, you can take it off by slightly warming the dish on the fire^ and then cover the compote which you wish to mask. You may likewise stain the edges with a colour which may be eaten^ leaving the centre white. 259. Apple Jelly Compote, Eun in custard-glasses, pink or white; when they are settled, turn four or five into a compotier; ] ornament them with preserved lemon or orange peel. Add a little syrup with a glass of noyau. SECTION XIII. Of Comfits. K - 260. Of Comfits. A Comfit is an almond, fruit, seed, or paste, en- closed in a covering of sugar, formed of different layers; the beauty and quality of the sugar are its chief recommendation. The best comfits are made at Verdun, in France, and the following method is that of Messrs. Le Eoux and Courronne, confectioners of that town. They use the same utensils and tools as in England, and have a copper basin, or pan, with handles at the side, and at both ends, in iron; jtwo cords are attached to a balance, to which theITALIAN CONFECTIONER. pan is slung by two pieces of iron^ formed like an S; this is called the balancing pan.—(See plate II. fy. 2.) The following are also necessary ; an iron vessel, or chafing-dish, to contain charcoal, placed under the pan, and five or six inches from it: another basin or pan, larger and flatter, fixed on a tub or barrel, with an opening, is used to make fine nonpareils, as well as comfits, of every form; a copper beading pan, made in the shape of a funnel, with a spindle in the centre, to regulate the syrup, and pearl the comfits, a tool which gave the idea of mine for drops {^ee plate \.fig. 8); sieves of leather, perforated, of different sizes ; a small charcoal stove, or brazier, to keep the syrup in the pan of an equal heat, and a ladle to pour it on the comfits. 261. Almond Comfits, Take ten pounds of Jordan almonds, picked, of equal size, put them into boiling water to peel them; throw them into cold water, and put them on sieves to dry in the air; when nearly dry, put them in the stove to finish drying; next dissolve rome gum Senegal in water, pass it through a silk sieve, that it may be particularly clean, and take eight pounds of syrup, boil it to the strong thready put in a table spoonful of the gum Senegal to give-, it a body; take it from the fire, and place it at your right hand, on the little charcoal brazier, the fire of which must be covered with ashes, lest it should be too fierce, and to keep the sugar of an equal heat. Now put the'almonds, blanched as above, into the comfit pan described in the last article, and givf i them two charges* of gum; dry the "almonds well each time, then give them a small charge of syrup, \145 ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. but do not moisten them too much^ as that would take off the gum. The syrup must then be added at six different times^ inereasmg the quantity each charge; the eighth time^ put half gum and half syrup; rub the almonds with your left hand to make them take equally^ and not stick to each other, and continue the same till your comfits are of the size you wish, sifting them every tenth charge, to take away the dust of the sugar which is formed in the pan; and if the pan becomes very rough, you must wash it. When the comfits are of a proper size, take them out of the pan on a sieve, and put them in the stove till the next day. Clarify, in spring water, some fine loaf-sugar, boil it to a strong tJiread, let the first charge have a little gum in it, giving twelve charges, adding like- wise to the eighth charge some gum Arabic, or Senegal; be careful to dry every charge well, that your almonds may be white, keeping only a mo- derate heat under the pan, as too much heat would spoil their whiteness. On the third day, take double-refined sugar, clarify, and boil it to the little j^earl; give the almonds ten charges, let each charge be less than the preceding one; and, to whiten 1 them, dry them for half an hour between each charge, shaking them very gently, and keeping them just warm; take them out, sift them, and put them in the stove till next day. On the fourth day, to smooth the comfits, take some of the whitest crystallized sugar, boiled to the little thread; give the comfits three charges, without fire under them; take care to work them longer than usual, put a gentle fire under them to dry them, and then put them in boxes. K146 ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. 262. Comfits in LiqtteurSu Take ten pounds of the kernels of apricots, or bitter almonds, and put them into hot water to open their pores, that the liqueur may penetrate; take them from the water and let them drain a few minutes : put into a jug the spirits you prefer, as maraschino, brandy, coffee, roses, orange-flower, &c. (see No. 27) ; this must be twenty-two or twenty- three degrees of strength, tempering them with water, that it may penetrate your almonds; infuse them in the spirit, cork the jug or pot well, to pre- vent evaporation, put it in a warm place for a fort- night; take out the almonds, and drain and dry them in the stove; when perfectly dry, make them in comfits, as described in the preceding article. 263. Almonds, with Vanilla, Are prepared in the same way as the others, adding^ when about half their size, in the process of cover- ing them with sugar, two ounces of good vanilla, pounded with sugar, and sifted through a silk sieve; mix this with the syrup intended to lay over them; it will be concealed by the white sugar when finished. 264. Almond Comfits, of various flavours, Rose and orange-flower almonds are made by clarifying the sugar with water distilled from those flowers : bergamot, jessamine, cedraty, orange, cin- namon, cloves, &c. &c., are made by adding essences to the syrup, with which you give the comfits the^ central layers.147 ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. 265. Rose Almonds Are to be made as above. To colour them, pat some liquid carmine in the syrup intended for the last ten charges; on the third day add gum Sene- gal in the first charge. Take care that the almonds are only lukewarm, as too much heat makes them take the heat in blots. Each charge must be gradually diminished, so that the last must be a very small one; on the fourth day, smooth them, as directed in No. 261, with fine sugar, but no colour; they must have three charges, to give them a gloss. 266. Cinnamon Almonds, As before; only at every fourth layer of sugar, you must add gum Senegal, and a little pulverized cinnamon. Striped almonds, or those which show various colours in stripes, when -broken, are made by mixing a different colour in every four or six charges of sugar, and afterwards covering the whole with white. 267. Egg Comfits. Have the two halves of an egg made in box- wood ; take some gum paste, roll it out quite thin, and put into the casts, make it lay close, cut off with a knife the outside edges quite smooth, let them dry, and prepare what you mean to put into them. They are usually filled with imitations of all sorts of fruits.—(See No. 543.) In Paris, they put in a number of nicknacks, little almanacks, smelling bottles with essences, and even things of value, for presents. Join the two halves with some of the same paste, moistened with a little water and some gum Arabic; then proceed as in No. 160. K 2148 ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. 268. Nut Comfits. Crack a quantity of nuts^ take eight pounds of good kernels^ and put them in the stove for four or five days to dry; make a good fire under your pan for comfits^ and put in your nuts, rub your hand over them, to take ofi* the loose skins, sift them, that no dust may remain, and put them back in the pan, which is slung to a balance, then proceed as in No. 261. They may be flavoured with any essence you choose. 269. FistacJiio Comfits. Take eight pounds of pistachio kernels, the finest and greenest you can get, put them in the stove to dry a little, and proceed as in No. 261. The hollow at the top of the pistachios must be filled up with sugar. For this purpose, sift some sugar through a silk sieve, and powder the nuts in the first three charges, to cover the inequalities of the pistachio, without causing them to stick together. To make them taste of roses, orange-flower, &c., the sugar must be clarifled with the distilled water of those flowers. To give them any other flavour, add the different essences to the middle layers, if you wish to colour them.—(See No. 265.) 270. Cinnamon Comfits. As the bark of the cassia lignea is frequently sold for cinnamon of Ceylon, be particular to choose it of a dark colour, of a fine taste, strong smell, and leaving no mucilage in the mouth when chewed.* Some confectioners purchase the bark of the cassia lignea above noticed, as the price is very moderate;149 ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. but this is a false calculation^ as it requires more than double the quantity of cassia to give anything Jike the taste of cinnamon ; when used in comfits, the former gives no taste whatever. Take a pound X)f cinnamon, steep it two or three hours in warm water to soften it, till it is easy to cut into little pieces half an inch long, as thin as possible; when cut, put it into the stove to dry; when sufficiently dry, put it into the pan slung over the charcoal fire, then take a whisk, dip it into your syrup, boiled to the strong thread, and shake it over the cinnamon with your left hand, shaking the pan with the right, to move the cinnamon; give eight or ten charges, taking care to shake it well till each is dry. Repeat this operation two or three times a day, till you perceive that the cinnamon is white, and of a suffi- cient consistence to allow you to put the syrup on with a ladle ; when the pieces of cinnamon are com- pletely covered, whiten them, giving them eight small charges, not forgetting to dry them after every charge, shaking them gently. Take care also to sift them every time you see any dust in the pan, and each time you put them into the stove to dry. When the comfits are white, have some syrup ^boiled to 2i pearl in your beading funnel, suspended to a cord, tied across the work-room by a spindle, to direct the sugar, which must flow like a small thread, gradually on the comfits, which you must continue to shake as gently as possible, and then put them again into the stove. The next day con- tinue the same operation, increasing the quantity of syrup; on the third and last day, use the double- refined sugar clarified.ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. 150 271. Angelica Comfits, Cut some fine stems of angelica into little rings, blanch them in hot water, throw them into cold water, drain them off, and put them into syrup; boil them till the syrup comes to the pearl; take them off on sieves to dry in the stove, minding to turn them from time to time, that they may not adhere to each other; when dry, put them into the comfit pan, and work them as the cinnamon comfits. 272. Lemon Comfits. Take some lemon peel, and clear it from the pith,, leaving only a thin rind, which you must cut into small threads like the cinnamon; blanch and pre- pare them as the angelica, and finish in the same manner.—Orange comfits the same. 273. Celery Comfits, Take half a pound of clean celery seeds, and put them in the pan placed on the barrel, and warmed by the chafing-dish ; pour some syrup on them, without the gum Senegal, working them with both hands; when they are large enough, put them in the stove for twenty-four or forty-eight hours, that they may be perfectly dry; put them back in the pan, give them eight charges of white syrup, to whiten them, taking care to dry them well each time, and then put them in the stove; the next day put them into the balancing pan, pour some syrup into the beading funnel boiled to slpearl. Continue and finish them in two days, as for the cinnamon. —(See No. 270.)151 ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. 274. Cherry Comfits, r Take ten pounds of dried cherries (see No. 184), roll them singly in your hands, to make them round, and put them in a sieve, sprinkled with fine" «ugar, and roll them well in it, to prevent their sticking to one another; put them in the stove; when dry, place them in the balanced comfit pan, and give them a charge of gum Senegal, stirring them lightly with your hand, that they may be moistened equally; throw in some very finely sifted sugar, dry them well, and put them back in the stove for two or three hours; afterwards re- peat the operation as above, and put them back in the stove for a day; on the next day proceed as for almonds.—(See No. 261.) 275. Barberry Comfits Are made in the same way as the preceding. Cur- rant and raspberry comfits are also made in the same manner. 276. Carraway Comfits, Clean and prepare your carraways as the celery seed (see No. 273) ; they must be smoothed like the almonds (see No. 261), and they may be jjearlecl like the celery. 277. Comfits in Gim Paste, Confectioners, who make large quantities of comfits, keep together the scrapings of their comfit pan, and broken bits, to be dried, pounded, and sifted through a silk sieve, which, mixed with gum dragon, moistened, form a gum paste. Different flavours are given, as coffee, chocolate, bergamot.152 ITALIAN CONFECTIONEK. vanilla^ &c. A large piece of this paste is to be rolled with a roller^ and cut with tools of different forms, as lozenges^ hearts^ cUibs^ &c.; cut a sufficient quantity for a pan^ which is about eight pounds,, dry them in the stove, put them into your comfit pan over the barrel, and work them as before, ob- serving that all the small comfits are made in the pan over the barrel; and are only put in the balance pan to be finished smooth^ the three last charges. 278. Nonpareils, Nonpareils may be reckoned among the first species of confectionery, and, from their great utility, will last, probably, as long as the art itself. Put into the pan over the barrel half a pound of Florence orris-root, pulverized and sifted, and warmed with a gentle fire. Take about half a table-spoonful of syrup boiled to ?i joearl, moisten the powder with it, and with your hands make them into small grains; increase the charges by degrees, sift the nonpareils, to take off the small particles and dust of the sugar; repeat the sifting often, taking care to have sieves of different sizes. At nighty place the nonpareils in the stove to dry, increasing them in size day after day with the finest sugar, and finish as above. Half a pound of orris will make more than a hundredweight of non-. pareils. 279. To colour Nonjoareils. Prepare your colours (see No. 555), and take syrup boiled to a thread; mix your colours in separate pots, and divide the nonpareils; the quan- tity of white nonpareils being double that of any other colour, this being necessary to set off the.ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. 153 ;other colours to advantage. Put one of the por- tions of your nonpareils into a pan^ warm them, and pour on your colour; stir them well till they are all separated, and put them into the stove to dry. It is very important to give the exact quan- tity of colour, that the surface only of the non- pareils may be wet, and to leave them in the stove only time enough to dry them, as too much heat will make the colours fade. 280. Comfits containing Liqueur, These comfits are made as the imitation of apri- cot (No. 87), imprinted in starch with a model representing Jordan almonds. In the syrup you may put a glass of any liqueur you please, and pro- ceed as for almond comfits (iNo. 261). You must manage them very gently, because they are easily broken, particularly in the first charge. SECTION XIV. Of Fruit Preserved witliout Sug'ar. 281. Fruit Preserved without Sugar, This method of preserving fruit was invented by Mr. Appeet, and has been used by the author very extensively. Take very clean bottles, without any smell; the fruit must be gathered in the morning it is to be used, bottled instantly, corked quite tight, tied with wires, and steamed the same day. To preserve fruit on a large scale, you should be provided with square wooden cases, lined with lead, air-tight when closed, and capable of containing154 ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. ten or twelve dozen of bottles^ with an apparatus to receive heat by steam. 282. Bottled Apricots. Gather the apricots in the morning of the day you mean to preserve your fruit; cut them into two or four pieces_, according to their size^ put them into bottles^ and cork them, and tie down the cork with a wire crossed over it, and made fast round the neck of the bottle, as Champagne wine is corked. Lay the ])ottles on their sides at the(: bottom of the case, arranged as if packed for a long journey, on a bed of hay; when the case has as many bottles as it will hold, fill it three-quarters full with cold water; the case must then be sup- plied with steam from the steam-pipe, and the case closed : in half an hour^s time the water will be at two hundred degrees of heat, the proper heat fixed by Mr. Appert. Having ascertained this, instantly turn the steam-pipe, and leave the casein that state till next day ; at six the next morning, the heat has been found at one hundred and ten degrees; at eight o^clock the bottles were so hot they could scarcely be touched. They should be now unpacked, and when the bottles are cold, the corks should be rosined, and they may be put in the cellar like wine. All sorts of fruit may be preserved in thii^ way, and the method has been found to answer very well, hut the fruit must he hottlecl the same day ■ as it is gathered, or many of the bottles will break, , and the fruit be spoiled. 28B. Pulped Apricots, Put your apricots in a fixed boiler, without water; open the steam-pipe, and in ten minutes they willITALIAN CONFECTIONER. 155 be blanched, and fit to pass through a sieve; when the whole of the pulp is extracted, fill some bottles with it, and proceed as in No. 282. The pulp keeps extremely well, and apricot paste may be made of it, and used as if made of new fruit, fresh gathered. 284. Currant Juice, When you have mashed some currants on a sieve, and strained them through a flannel bag, put them in bottles, and proceed as above; the juice will keep very well, but it forms a sediment, and looks thick. Currant Juice another loay. After straining the juice through a sieve, put it in a cellar to ferment; two days after take off the crust formed by the fermentation, strain it through a' flannel bag, bottle it, and proceed as before; it keeps very well, is quite clear, and has the same taste as if it were just bottled. It is excellent for ices, syrups, and currant water. 285. Juice of various Fruits, The juice of cherries, raspberries, mulberries, black currants, &c. may be preserved very clear without leaving any sediment; each being mashed separately, strained through a sieve, bottled, and submitted to heat as above. 286. Of Preserved Fruits in general. Every species of fruit, whether with or without kernels, gathered and bottled the same day, may be preserved without loss; that is, scarcely any of the bottles are broken, except accidentally, and they]56 ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. keep well. The average loss of bottles^ when the ) fruit is not gathered the same day, is ten or twelve i per case. The fruit, when so mismanaged, shows ^ a small white spot upon it, is apt to become musty, i and consequently must not be kept too long. Those | bottles in which you see a white spot formings should be looked out for immediate use. Thd manner of corking is of the greatest consequence ), the bottles should be perfectly air-tight, or the fruit will not keep. 287. Co7yi/position for covering the CorJcs of the Bottles May be easily purchased, or made in the following; manner :—Melt a quantity of rosin, a fourth part: of this quantity of bees^-wax, and a fourth of! brick-dust, and mix them well in a pot on the fire; dip the cork and the top of the bottle in it, turning) it round, that it may completely cover the cork. [ | 288. Improved Method, H During the many years that have elapsed sinc^' the first publication of this work, the author has; found that it is very difficult to keep juice and fruit in bottle for ice; many bottles are broken by thai fermentation, as soon as the fruit comes to maturity/1 Another inconvenience is, that, if only a pint of ie^j is made, the fruit remaining in the bottle is totally! lost; to avoid this inconvenience, the author, after i having tried all sorts of glass and earthen bottles^} has found nothing answer so well as soda-water 1 bottles,—from their size, the strength of the glassy t and the facility of being able to cork them vegrj tight. During many years, these preserves ilil157 ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. bottles have been quite admired, and very econo- mical, as the bottles do not break in boiling, and the quantity they contain is also economical. Another improvement is to put syrup with the fruit;—about half a pound to one pound of juice, or pulp of the fruit. Observe, not to fill your bottles within two inches of the corks; because, if jfurther, they will burst in the boiling. SECTION XV. Of Creams. 289. Of Creams, I Cream, used in great quantities by the confectioner, is formed on the surface of new milk, poured on a table, hollowed out on purpose to receive the milk. Formerly all creams were in the department of the confectioner, now many kinds are generally pre- pared in the kitchen. We will confine ourselves to i our limits. 290. WJiijot Cream, I Take one quart of cream, put it into a bowl with some powdered sugar and orange-flower powder, or water, and have another bowl near you, over which you must place a sieve to receive and drain the cream; whip the cream with a whisk, and as it rises in a froth, take it off with a skimmer, and put it into the sieve; continue to the end, putting back into the first bowl till you have finished that which drains from the sieve; when done, put it into your dish, ornament it with zest of lemon, or cedraty, cut very fine and tastefully; it is likewise served in glasses.-'1 158 ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. It may be iced, by putting it into a cellaret in some ice pounded with salt: this is a tin vessel made on li purpose to preserve or keep creams, &c., iced. When .1 your cream is not quite fresh, put in a little gum- 1 dragon in powder; but it is best to do without this. 1 291. Chocolate Whi^t Cream Is made in the same manner, dissolving four ounces i of chocolate in a cup of boiling milk, for two pints of cream; let it cool in ice ; add four or five ounce^ of fine powdered sugar, and proceed as above. 292. Coffee Whi^t Cream. Roast , two ounces of Mocha coflPee, throw it quite hot into a glass of boiling water, and cover it up \ \ when cold, strain the infusion through a sieve into a basin, and add five or six ounces of pounded \ sugar; put it on the fire, boil it to a blow, reduce it to a sand^ by working it with the spaddle; when cold, add it to your cream, or you may make an in- : fusion of coffee, and put it to the cream when cold; whip and finish it as above. 293. Vanilla Whipt Cream, Cut a pod of good vanilla very fine, pound it with powdered sugar, such as is intended for your cream; sift it through a lawn sieve, and add it to your cream, as directed above. 1 294. Orange and Lemon Wliipt Cream, Rub or rasp on a piece of sugar the peel of two fine Seville oranges; scrape off the sugar as it im- bibes the essence, mash it very fine, and add it to your cream. Lemon cream is made in the same manner.159 ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. 295. Straioherry Whipt Cream, Pick a small quantity of very ripe strawberries, mash them in a sieve^ and add the juice to your cream, with powdered sugar, and a little liquid carmine, or cochineal to give it a fine rose colour.— (See Colours, No. 558). When you send it to table, decorate it with a few strawberries, and some leaves cut out of very thin cedraty, or a few green leaves cut in paste of almonds; but they must be very thin, and pushed in a mould of the real straw- berry leaf. 296. Rose Whijot Cream, Proceed as in the former number, adding a small drop of essence of roses to your rose colour. 297. Moss, Froth, or BocJc Ice. In these names, ices have been made, which are neither more nor less than whipt cream; all those receipts described as whipt cream, are put in a freezing-pot, garnished with paper, and buried in rough ice aud salt for six hours. When you want them, as explained in Bomba ice, cut them in square pieces; if you want them extremely light, put two whites of eggs, beat to a snow, mixed with them. SECTION XVI. Of Ices. 298. Of Ices. Ices are composed of the juice of fruits, creams, and liqueurs, prepared and congealed by means of160 ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. pounded ice, mixed with salt, or with salt, nitre, or soda. The freezing-pot should be always of pewter, because it prevents the contents of the vessel from congealing too quickly, and there is time enough.'' to mix them thoroughly; for, on this circumstance/ in a great measure, depends the excellence of the? ice. Tin vessels occasion too rapid a congelation,^ and do not afford time to well mix the materials.^ Some are of opinion, that when any article is iced it loses its sweetness, and that it ought therefore to have an additional quantity of sugar; but this is not correct: the diminution of the sweetness, arises from the materials not being properly mixed or worked with the spaddle, when in the freezing- pot. In ices that are badly mixed, the sugar sinks to the bottom, and they have necessarily a sharp, unpleasant taste. Another very general defect in ices, is their appearing full of lumps; they are also often of a disagreeable, dirty red colour; and therej are few houses in London where ices are to be found entirely free from these faults. To make ices, you must have a tub, or pail, in ! which you place your freezing-pot in the midst of^ pounded ice, well mixed with salt; the mixing of the salt with the ice must be particularly attended I to, as upon this circumstance depends the freezing power, and consequently, in a great measure, the goodness of the ice. The freezing-pots being set in the middle of the ice, up to the covers (see plate \l,fig. 9), put into them the articles you intend to' ice, which must be made agreeable to the palate, without being too sweet, as it is very easy to add a little syrup if necessary; keep turning the pots quickly round about in the ice, by means of the- handles at top, till the cream is set, opening theni'i161 ITALIAN CONFECTIONEK. every three minutes^ and with a copper spaddle take the contents from the edges^ mixing and stirring the whole well together; continue to do this till your ice is completed^ and do not spare your labour, for on this part of the operation_, as is said before, very much depends; then cover your pot with fresh ice, mixed with salt, and let it re- main till wanted to be served up. 299. Custard for Ices. Take a pint of good fresh cream, and mix it slowly in a small copper pan with eight yolks of i eggs, which must be quite fresh; cut a very thin I slice of lemon-peel, just the surface of the rind of a I lemon, and put it in the cream; put your pan on a Islow fire, and stir the cream constantly with a whisk, taking care not to let it boil, for it will turn to curds; this you will easily perceive, as it then begins to form small lumps ; you will know when it is done enough by the cream becoming of a thicker consistence, and instead of turning round the pan, it at once stops; then immediately take it from the fire, add to it six ounces of pounded jsugar, more or less, according to taste; strain it through a sieve over a basin, and give it what flavour you choose. In case of necessity you may use half milk and half cream, by adding the yolks \ of two more eggs, but it is better w^th new cream and fewer eggs. 300. Chocolate Ice Creom. Add to a pint of cream, prepared as in No. 299, four ounces of good chocolate dissolved in a little iwarm water, and stirred on a slow fire : mix it L162 ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. well with the cream, and strain it through a sieve; when cold_, put into the freezing-pot, and work it as directed above. 301. White Coffee Ice Cream, To a pint of cream_, prepared as in No. 299, without any flavour, add four ounces of Mocha coflee roasted; while your coffee is roasting, put the prepared cream into a vessel with a cover, and throw in your coflPee berries hot; cover it up, and put a napkin over it, to prevent any evaporation) leave it for an hour, then strain it through a sieve, and you will have a white cream with a delicious flavour of coffee; sweeten it as directed above, and when cold, pour it in the freezing-pot to ice. You may likewise make it with a strong infusion of coffee, but then it will take the colour of coffee. 302. Tea Ice Cream, Take a cup of the finest green tea, just cover it with boiling water, wherein let it steep for a quarter of an hour; then add it to a pint of cream pre- pared as in No. 299, proceeding exactly in th6 same manner. 303. Vanilla Ice Cream, Take half an ounce of vanilla, cut it as fine as possible, pound it in a little brass mortar, with the six ounces of sugar intended to sweeten your cream; add it to your cream, with yolks of eggs, as in No. 299, and strain it through a sieve : when cold, put it into the freezing-pot and work it. 304. Cinnamon Ice Cream, Prepare the sticks of cinnamon in the same163 ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. tenner as vanilla^ and finish as above. To clioose cinnamon^ see No. 270. 305. Pistachio Ice Cream. Take four ounces of pistachios, blanch them in hot water, peel and pound them perfectly smooth, adding a little cream, or milk, to prevent them from turning into oil; while you pound them, put in a piece of preserved cedraty (see No. 301), pre- pare a pint of cream (see No. 299), and add your pistachios to it; strain it several times through a sieve, and put in half a pound of powdered sugar, more or less, to your taste; when cold, pour it into the freezing-pot, and work it. 306. Chesnut Ice Cream. Take off the husks of three or four dozen ches- nuts, bake them in an oven, pick them perfectly clean from every bit of skin, pound them in a mortar by degrees, with a pint of fresh cream ; add to it eight yolks of eggs, six ounces of pounded sugar, and a little orange-flower water, or not, as you please: put it on the fire, and proceed as in No. 299. 307. Spanis7i-Nut Ice Cream, Take half-a-pint of nuts (measure when cracked); bake them in an oven, then pound them with a little cream ; add to them a pint of cream, eight yolks of eggs, and six ounces of powdered sugar, put it on the fire, and proceed as in No. 299. • 308. Orgeat Ice Cream Is made as the preceding. Choose new sweet almonds, and add a few bitter almonds; sprinkle l2164 ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. them with, orange-flower water while they are being pounded. 309. Plain Ice Cream, Whip a pint of fresh double cream^ quite strong (see No. 290); when whipped^ add to it six ounces of pounded sugar; put it into the freezing-pot^ and work it well. 310. Brown-Bread Ice Cream, Make a quart of plain ice cream (see No. 309); when frozen^ work into it some brown breads previ- ously browned at the mouth of the oven, and cut into small square slices. 311. Maraschino Ice Cream, Take a pint of good double fresh cream; whip it strong (see No. 290); when whipped^ add to it six ounces of pounded sugar^ and genuine mara- schino sufficient to flavour it; put it into the freez- ing-pot^ and work it well. 312. Noyau Ice Cream, Proceed as for the last, only, instead of mara- schino, flavour it with noyau. 313. Orange-Mower Ice Cream, Proceed as in No. 299 ; flavour it with orange- flower water, or a small drop of naroli; but the latter must be used sparingly, being the essential oil of orange-flowers. 314. StratvherrT/ Ice Cream., Mash and strain some strawberries over a basin; have a sufficient quantity of juice to add to a pint165 ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. \ of line cream_, with the juice of a lemon without boihng; but the mixture must be so managed as to be equal; neither the taste of the strawberries ! or of the cream must preponderate. Sweeten it to ! your palate with pounded sugar^ pass it through a sieve, and put it into the freezing-pot to ice^ work- ing it as usuaL 315. Raspherry Ice Cream I Is made in the same way as strawberry cream. 316. Currant Ice Cream Is made like strawberry cream^ adding a few rasp- I berries for flavour. 317. Pine-apple Ice Cream, To a pint of cream_, add as much pine-apple pulp as will flavour it_, with six ounces of pounded sugar, and the juice of a lemon; strain it; pour it into the freezing-pot, working it as usual. 318. Strawberry Water Ice. \ Pick some fine strawberries very clean, strain jl them through a lawn sieve over a basin, and add to the juice sufiicient clarified sugar to sweeten it, i and a little lemon-juice, and ice it; if you find it does not freeze enough, add a little water; if too I much, it is necessary to add a little syrup. Ob- serve, that the chief recommendation of all ice, is to be smooth and soft. 319. Raspberry Water Ice I Is made like strawberry ice : add, if you please, a ii few currants and cherries, well mashed, and mixedITALIAN CONFECTIONER. 166 with the juice of the raspberries ; strain it through a sieve. 320. Currant Water Ice. Pick^ mash, and strain your currants through a sieve^ and proceed as in No. 318. To lessen the acid taste^ you may add^ if you like^ a few very ripe cherries and raspberries; cherries alone may be prepared^ and iced in the same manner. 321. Cherry Water Ice, Take one pound of Kentish cherries^ pound them, and extract the juice; then proceed as for strawberry water ice (see No. 318) : add a little noyau, to give it the flavour of the cherry kernel^ previous to freez- ing it. 322. Apricot Water Ice, Take very ripe apricots, mash and strain them through a sieve into a basin; pound the kernels of the same apricots very fine with a little water, that they may pass through the sieve, adding the juice of a lemon, a little water, and some syrup; strain it several times, and put it into the freezing-pot; if, in working it, you do not find it to your taste, add a little water, syrup, or lemon juice. 323. Feach Water Ice. The same process as for apricots. Should your fruit not be ripe enough, blanch it in water. 324. A2)][ile Water Ice. Choose fine apples, cut them into small pieces, and take out the core; put them on the fire in some water to boil, and reduce them to a paste; strain it167 ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. tlirou^^li a sieve_, add the juice of a lemon^ and sweeten it to your taste with syrup^ putting a little water to the pulp if too thick; pour it into the freezing-pot^ and work it as above. 325. Pear Water Ice, Be particular in choosing your fruity and proceed ^as for apples. 326. Barberry Water Ice. Take a quantity of very ripe barberries in propor- tion to the ice you intend to make, and put them in a pan of water on the fire; boil them till they break, cover them with syrup, boil and strain them through a cloth held by two people; when cold, put them in a freezing-pot to ice. 327. Lemon Water Ice, Take any number of lemons you please; of every fourth lemon rasp the peel close to the surface over a basin, into which you are to squeeze the juice, adding a little water and syrup to it; when mixed to your taste strain it through a lawn sieve, and put it into the freezing-pot. 328. Maraschino Water Ice. Make a pint of lemon ice (see No. 327), and flavour it well with genuine maraschino; put it into the freezing-pot, and work it well. 329. CedratT/ Water Ice, Make a quart of lemon ice (see No. 327) ; when made, add to it the zest of a fine cedraty, previously rubbed on sugar; strain it, and freeze it.168 ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. 330. Ginger Water Ice. Take two or three ounces of preserved ginger, and pound it with a little raw ginger; make a pint of lemon ice (see No. 327), mix them together, and freeze it. 331. Orange Water Ice, Prepare the oranges like the lemons (see No. 327); to procure the essence of oranges or lemons, rub the peel on a large piece of sugar, and scrape off the outside of the sugar with a knife. 332. Champagne Water Ice. Rasp six lemons on a piece of sugar, and squeeze the juice in a basin; to this put the sugar which has imbibed the essence of the lemon, and a bottle of champagne ; sweeten it to your taste with syrup, and then proceed as in No. 298; any kind of wine may be used in the same way. 333. Punch Water Ice. Make a pint of lemon ice (see No. 327), then flavour it with white rum, put it into the freezing- pot, and freeze it. 334. Bomha Ice. Mix the yolks of sixteen fresh eggs in a pint of spring water, with a glass of noyau, or maraschino; add syrup to your liking, and put your pan on the fire, whip it with a whisk, as if you were whipping the whites of eggs; when it is nearly upon the boil, take it from the fire, continue to whip it till it be- comes a light froth, then pour it into the freezing- pot, and let it remain for two or three hours withoutITALIAN CONFECTIONER. 169 stirring it; when you wish to serve it up^ dip the freezing-pot into warm water^ and turn out the ice on your dish. You may Hne the inside of the freezing-pot with paper, which will save you the trouble of dipping into warm water, as the ice will then come out easily, and you may take the paper off afterwards. You can mask this ice by cutting out with a spoon the middle of the ice, and filling up the pot with cream ice of any other kind or colour. 335. American Bomb a Ice. Make a chocolate ice (see No. 300); you may line the inside of the freezing-pot with paper. Observe, this kind of freezing-pot must be large at the top, and small at the bottom; with a silver spoon lay it equally over the paper, and fill the ! interior with the Bomba ice^ as the preceding re- ceipt. 336. Bomb a a la CJiantilly. Make a crust as the preceding, with fresh straw- berry water ice, and fill the inside with vanilla whipt cream, as No. 293; but take care to put in one white of egg whipt to snow, leave it to freeze six hours as the former; when you want to serve it up, cut it in slices ; you could make all sorts of Bomba by varying the crust and the whipt cream, but the crust must always be made in water ice, and the flavour directly opposite to that of the cream: for instance, orange, cedraty, tea, grapes: whipt cream would be insignificant with ices of the same flavour. 337. Pine-Apple Water Ice. Peel a pine-apple, pound it, and pass it through a fine hair sieve; add the juice of three lemons, and170 ITxiLIAN CONFECTIONER. syrup, to your taste, with a little water: strain the whole, and pour it into the freezing-pot, working it as usual. 338. Grape Water Ice. Take a handful of dried elder-flowers, put them into a freezing-pot, and cover them with boiling water; let them stand for half an hour, strain them through a sieve, and add two lemons; sweeten it to your liking with syrup ; when frozen, add a glass of white wine, but mix it only a little at a time, then put it in your moulds. 339. Ices in Fruit Shapes, These require much attention ; you must have leaden moulds to open with a hinge, as in plate II. fig, 8. Every ice we have described may be moulded to represent the fruits of which it bears the name; the proper flavour being given at the same time. When your ice is prepared (suppose apricot), open your mould, and fill it with apricot ice; insert, through the little hole at the end, a stem, or even a leaf or two, of the tree, or a good imitation of it, and close it again directly, leaving the leaf and branch outside; wrap the mould in paper, and place it in a tub, in which you must put pounded ice with salt, with which cover it; let the moulds remain an hour or more in the ice. The stone of the fruit may, when well cleaned, be put into apricots, peaches, &c. You must also have a case in the ice : this case is a sort of box made of tin, with shelves and compartments, and a square opening at the top and front; line the inside with paper, or vine leaves, if in season ; take your moulds out of the tub one by one, dip them into lukewarm water with the17J ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. paper^ as that too^ being frozen^ would stick to the leaves and branch_, tear them off, and spoil the ap- pearance of your fruit; dip them immediately after into cold water^ to take off the salt which might adhere to them, open the mould_, take out the fruit, and give it directly the colour proper for it :—the colours are, prepared cochineal, indigo, carmine, gamboge, burnt sugar^ chocolate, fresh cream, and saffron stone. All these colours must be separately dissolved in cups or gallipots : for every colour you must have two pots, the one light, the other dark; —in colouring your fruit. Nature must be your guide. To make the colours, see Colour, No. 555. As you colour them, put them into the case above described, and place the case in ice; leave them there till wanted to be sent up to table on plates or glasses. 340. Ohservations on Winter Ices, In winter we must supply the place of fresh fruit by marmalades, or preserved fruits^ or have recourse to fruit as prepared by M. Appert, without sugar, and as described in Nos. 281 and 282 ; and which plan we have tried on a very large scale with com- plete success; fruit thus preserved, is extremely valuable for ices. 341. Ice^WelL It being the author^s wish that his work should be useful to every class of readers, whether private or professional, he considers it essential to add to this edition some practical observations upon the con- struction and management of ice-wells, having been frequently consulted by noblemen on this subject. To obtain a good ice-well^ you should choose aITALIAN CONFECTIONER. 172 spot looking towards the north_, the soil either sand, gravel, or chalk, wherein yoa can easily build a well which will drain itself, the water soaking into the soil, by a waste well made under the other. An ice-well should be larger round than it is deep, for it is a common error to imagine that the deeper a well is the better; on the contrary_, we know that the water naturally runs towards the depth, and drawing towards the wells, penetrates through the brickwork^ and produces a humidity that melts the ice. To avoid this, a good well should be built with double walls, at a distance of eighteen inches or two feet apart, and the interval between filled up with ashes, or any other matter of an absorbent quality. The well must be built with a domed top (like a soup tureen), and a hole in the centre left to receive the ice. Over the dome of brickwork there should be a covering of earth, at least six feet in thickness, upon which a plantation may be formed, to keep off the sun^s rays : the hole in the centre of the dome should have a neck (like a large chimney-pot) se- cured with a strong cover of iron, running up through the superincumbent earth three or four feet, and should be kept always well covered with soil, and turfed over, as soon as the well is filled, to prevent any access of air in that direction. At the side of the well, upon a line with the bottom of the dome, an entrance must be made to take out the ice : it should consist of a porch with double doors, the outer of which must be covered with straw, or thatched, and every crevice in both doors stopped up, and made as air-tight as possible, A dry time ought to be chosen for filling theITALIAN CONFECTIONER. 173 well; the ice should be broken as small as possible, in order that it may reunite in the interior^ and three or four men should be employed in levelling and pounding it, till the well is filled to the very top : if a long frost ensues, it should be filled up from time to time, as the ice first introduced will diminish considerably in bulk as it forms itself into a compact mass, by freezing in the well. When the ice is taken out, every precaution should be adopted to prevent the rush of a volume of air into the well upon the opening of the doors. At first the ice must be taken out as it comes to hand, until the mass sinks to a level with the door; but afterwards, by means of a ladder, it must be t2i\ien/ro?n the sides of the well, all round quite dotvn to the bottom, leaving the centre to the last, which will be found solid and compact, even in the midst of summer; if, on the contrary, the ice is first taken away from the middle, you disturb the body, and the air which introduces itself will destroy more than you consume. The first object, it must be always recollected, in preserving the ice in a well, is to keep it dry; and if, unfortunately, the well is placed in a soil that will not permit it to drain itself, a pump must be fixed on the outside to draw off the water accumulated in the waste well. 342. Ices, Saccharometer, This instrument has been applied to the ices with immense success by the author : finding some of his ices highly approved of, induced him to dissolve the remains, and apply it to the saccharometer, to enable him to ascertam the degree of perfection. Having done that repeatedly, he always found that twenty-one degrees was the desired point; there-174 ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. fore^ he lias continually weighed the composition before the ices were frozen: lemonade,, or orange- ade^ fifteen degrees. This instrument can be ob- tained of the author. 343. Punch a la Romaine, Make a lemon ice^ well flavoured as directed in No. 327 ; take twelve fine lemons^ peel them^ and put them in fresh water; rub the peel of three lemons on a lump of sugar^ to obtain the essence; squeeze the juice of your lemons upon the piece of sugar containing the essence; add some spring water; sweeten it with syrup to your taste, or twenty-two degrees to the saccharometer; freeze it and work it well; then take the whites of six new-laid eggs^ let them be well whipt to snow \ when quite firm, take one pound of syrup, boiled to feather (see No. 8); pour it to the eggs while boiling; mix it well. When it is cold, add it to your ice. When you want it, mix it with a pint of kershwasser, two glasses of genuine maraschino, and a pint of sparkling champagne. If you find it is not strong enough, put more kershwasser: this is really the true receipt of the Punch k la Romaine. This delicious drink has been spoiled by economy or ignorance; through using rum^ brandy, and other inferior spirits instead of the kershwasser. 344. Prince Regenfs Punch, This punch was brought in fashion by his late Majesty George the Fourth. He was excessively fond of this beverage. It was always served after the turtle soup. It is composed with a strong in-173 ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. fusion of green tea_, vanilla^ cinnamon^ cloves^ lemon, bitter orange, rum, brandy, and champagne; pass it clear, cool it with rough ice, and serve it in a decanter : since this, the compositions of punch are infinitely multiplied, each gourmet has his own receipt, and adds some new ingredient; and each butler does the same; so the punch has fallen into such confusion, that the wisest persons do not drink any. SECTION XVII. Of Fruits in Brandy. 345. Fruit in Brandy. Most fruits maybe preserved in brandy, but cherries, peaches, apricots, green gages, mirabelle plums, and pears, are generally used for this purpose. The quality of the brandy contributes much to the good or bad taste of the fruit. Old Fi'ench brandy is to be preferred to that made in England, but it is not always easy to discover its age ; it may be generally known by its sparkling, and the beads which it forms round the glass when poured out, the smell it leaves on the palm of the hands on rubbing some in them, or the taste on the palate. But the con- fectioners, who have to preserve much fruit in brandy, may save expense by the following method : take a barrel capable of holding the quantity of brandy you expect to use in the year, and calculate the quantity of water necessary to reduce the Eng- lish spirit to thirty degrees, then dissolve a suffi- cient quantity of brown sugar-candy, boil it to a pearl (one quarter of sugar to two-thirds of brandy);ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. 176 mix the whole in the barrel; leave it in the cellar for a year^ till the fruit season arrives^ then tap it, and you will have a liqueur more fit for your fruit than what is generally bought for this purpose, and quite as good as the brandy of France. 346. Peaches in Brandy, Choose the peaches you mean to preserve, a little^ before they are ripe, take off the down by wiping them with a cloth ; prick them with a small fork to ' the stone, and put them as you do them into water, then on a moderate fire, keeping the water i; nearly boiUng; when you find your fruit softened, . so as to give way to the finger, throw them into cold water, and leave them to stand for a quarter of, an hour; change this water for another, and let them stand another quarter of an hour ; drain them on clean towels, and, when dry, arrange them regu- larly in a glass jar; have some clarified sugar boiled to the little ^earl; a quarter of syrup for two- thirds of fruit is a sufficient quantity; put to them ' double the quantity of brandy, at thirty degrees; ' mix, and strain it through a flannel bag two or I three times, and place the peaches regularly in ' your jars, and cover them with bladders, well tied'; down. 347. Apricots in Brandy, Apricots are prepared in the same way as peaches, except that you must boil them in the syrup, in which they must be left for a day; on the next take them out, drain, and put them in order in , your glasses; put your syrup on the fire, boil it to the pearl, and finish like the peaches. Mirabelle plums, and other fruits, are done in the same manner.177 ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. 348. Green Gages in Brandy. Take green gages before they are quite ripe; cut off half the stem^ prick them and put them in a pan full of water^ so that the water be three or four inches above the fruit; place your pan on a mode- rate fire_, and when the water is so hot that you cannot bear your finger in it^ take the pan off, and throw in a handful of salt^ and a handful of j spinach ; cover it with a cloth^ and let it cool. The next day, put the fruit on a gentle fire for two or three hours, taking care that the water does not boil; if you have a thermometer, you may regulate the heat to two hundred degrees, which it should never exceed. When the fruit is of a perfect green, and it rises on the water, put it into cold water, and finish as the apricots. 349. Cherries in Brandy, Take some fine morello cherries, cut off half the stems, and put them into cold water; when well washed, drain them on a sieve, and place them in your glasses; fill them with brandy at twenty- three degrees, and add to each bottle a little cinna- mon, broken or slightly pounded: render the bottles completely air-tight, and leave them for a month or two. After that time, separate the cherries from the brandy, measure it, and add to every pint four ounces of pounded sugar; stir and melt it, and strain it two or three times through a flannel bag; when perfectly clear, put it on your jcherries : to be used at pleasure. M178 ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. SECTION XVIII. Of Clear Jellies, and Pieces Montees. 350. Clear Jellies^ and Pieces Montees, In treating of these^ we are aware that we trespas* a little on the culinary department; but it is our object to make our readers acquainted with every- thing directly or indirectly connected with confec- tionery; besides^ there are some gentlemen wha want some parts of the second course made by the confectioner or the housekeeper. The author is compelled to observe, that those clear jellies are made to be eaten, and not to keep, as he, some years since, received an impertinent letter from a house- keeper, who had mistaken this receipt for making currant jelly; and, of course, spoiled all she made, and attributed the fault to the book. We shall proceed to describe the Piece Montee, and the various kinds of jellies. A piece montee is not the same article as aa assiette montee; but is an ornament to be eaten, and is to appear but once on the table : it is com- posed of biscuits, conserves, rock-sugar, nogat, &e., fixed on a building of paste, ornamented with spun sugar, &c., according to the fancy of the artist; taste, design, foresight, neatness, and activity, are, all necessary to the perfection of the piece montee : taste, to vary the colours and the materials, and to give elegance to the ornament; foresight, to pre^i^ pare beforehand every little requisite; design, to give i the proper proportion and elegance to the whole; neatness, in patting the parts together, which,'179 ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. must not be clumsily mixed with one another, nor must the caramel be seen with which you join them; and activity, as not to be obliged to warm your caramel five or six times, which would blacken it, and make your work look dirty, besides being disagreeable to the taste, as the caramel loses its strength, and takes the damp more quickly than sugar just boiled enough. 351. Clear Jelly, Take two calves^ feet, cut them in pieces, and put them in a saucepan with three quarts of water; boil this to three pints, take it off, and strain it through a sieve into a basin; take off the fat, and let it stand till next day—this is called stoch ; then put it into a saucepan with a pint and a half of white wine, the juice of three lemons, the peel of one, three-quarters of a pound of fine sugar, and the whites of eight eggs beat up to a strong snow ; add a little cinnamon, and the shells of the eggs, stir- ring them all together with a spoon ; put this on the fire; when it rises up, take it off, then put it on again, then take it off, and run it through a flannel bag; if you want it for moulds, you must put one ounce of isinglass in the saucepan before you put it on the fire. 352. To clarify Isinglass. Break your isinglass into small pieces with a hammer, wash it in several waters, and to four ounces add six pints of water; reduce it one-third, j skimming it carefully; take it from the fire, and I strain it through a silk sieve, to use for the follow- ing receipts. M 2180 ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. 353. Venus^s Clear Jelly, Take an ounce of clarified isinglass, add half a pound of syrup from fine clarified sugar, coloured with a little cochineal, prepared for ice (see No. 559), of a fine rose colour; add a small drop of essence of roses, and half a glass of good brandy; mix it lightly with a spoon, strain it through a silk sieve, take a copper mould of any form you please, according to the dish you mean to make ; place the mould in a box full of pounded ice, quite to the edge of the mould, and surrounded on all sides; pour your jelly into it, cover it with a tin cover, or any other equally thin, and put some ice on it; three hours is sufficient to ice this sort of jelly; when you wish to serve it up, take a basin of warm water, plunge your mould quickly into it, and in- stantly turn it out on the plate. 354. Orange-Flower Jelly, Take two ounces of newly-gathered orange-' flowers, or if you cannot procure these, take praw- lined orange-flowers, boil them in half a pint of syrup, let it cool, and infuse it closely covered up; when nearly cold, add an ounce of clarified isinglass, and the juice of three oranges, or lemons; strain it through a silk sieve, and finish as Venus^s clear* jelly. You may also add a glass of champagne, and colour it pink. 355. Strawberry Jelly. Mash a pound of strawberries, strain the juie^ through a fine sieve, and add half a pint of syrup, and boil them; when nearly cold, add an ounce of clarified isinglass, the juice of two lemons, and a181 ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. little prepared cochineal; strain the whole through a silk sieve^ pour it into your mouldy and ice it. 356. Currant Jelly, Take a pound of currants^ and mash them with four ounces of raspberries; strain them throup-h a flannel bag, and that your jelly may be quite clear, add an ounce of clarified isinglass, and a little pre- pared cochineal; ice it as above. 357. Cherry Jelly. Express the juice of two pounds of very ripe cherries, and four ounces of red currants; strain it through a flannel bag, and add half a pint of syrup, and an ounce of prepared isinglass; strain it through a silk sieve, and ice it as above. 358. Orange Jelly, Squeeze the juice from ten oranges and two lemons, and drain it through a sieve : rub two orange peels on a large piece of sugar, scrape the essence with a knife into your boiling syrup, mix it, and strain it through a flannel bag; when nearly cold, add to it an ounce of isinglass, and pour it into the mould, after it is coloured with cochineal. Oranges may likewise be iced in quar- ters, which have a pretty effect. The jelly is to be made as above, but instead of pouring it into moulds, it is to be put into the peels, prepared as follows :—Open ten or twelve oranges with a tin cutting-tool at the stalk end, about the size of a shilling, clear out the inside, without breaking the peel, with a small tea-spoon, and use the juice for your jelly. When the inside is quite cleaned.ITALIAN CONFECTIONEB. 1.82 throw tlie peels into water to make tliem firm; when your jelly is ready^ drain your peels^ fill them with it^ and ice them. When about to serve them up, cut them in four with a sharp knife_, and set them on the plate. 359. Gra]3e Jelly. Take the juice of two pounds of grapes, strain it through a flannel bag, add the juice of two lemons, half a pint of syrup, and an ounce of prepared isinglass : finish as for Venus^s clear Jelly. 360. Pine'A2:)ple Jelly. Take a pine-apple, pound it, and strain the pulp through a cloth; add to the fruit half a pound of syrup, and boil it up once: when nearly cold, add the juice of two lemons strained through a silk sieve, and mix an ounce of prepared isinglass, and a little sugar in dark caramel, to give it a finer colour; and finish as above. 361. Apricot Jelly Is made in the same manner as the pine-apple jelly, except the lemon-juice, which is never used. 362. Barherry Jelly, Take two ounces of very ripe barberries, pick them, and boil them in half a pint of syrup, so as to cover them; let them stand some time, then strain them through a cloth; finish like the pine- apple jelly. 363. Vanilla Jelly, Add to a half-pint of syrup, two pods of vanilla cut extremely fine, boil it up once, then let it standITALIAN CONFECTIONER. 183 to infuse; put a third part of a pint of very clear water to your syrup^ and strain it through a flannel hsLg; when nearly cold, put in an ounce of prepared isinglass, and a glass of maraschino, or any other liqueur : finish as usual. 364. Lemon Jelly Is made with the juice of two or three lemons, without any peel; strain it well through the flannel bag, as the jelly must be white : finish as above. 365. Coffee Jelly. As above; choose very good coffee, roast and I grind it, make an infusion of four ounces, strain it I through a flannel bag to have it very clear; take I the same quantity of sugar and isinglass. 366. Tea Jelly. Infuse a quarter of an ounce of tea, and when you put it to your syrup, add a glass of brandy, or any other spirits, a light shade of prepared cochi- I neal, and your isinglass; take care to strain every ^ infusion through a flannel bag. 367. Arrach or Bum Jelly, Uub on a large lump of sugar the peel of two lemons, and scrape ofl" the zest into half a pint of syrup; express the juice of five lemons, strain and add it, with a glass of rum to your syrup, which must be lukewarm; put in the ounce of prepared isinglass, and ice it as usual.ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. 368. Liqueur Jelly, Jellies may be made with all sorts of liqueurs or wines, and are prepared in the same way as Venus^s clear jelly. 369. WhisJced Jellies Are nothing more than the preceding jellies whisked| when cold_, with a rod of birch twigs; they musi be put in their moulds as soon as they are set, hke a soft cream ; they must not have time to fix before they are whisi^ed_, as they would not take the smooth- form of the moulds ; the jelly thus whisked is not so long taking the ice as the others, 370. Macedoine Jdly. All the jellies from No. 350 to 369, are called Macedoine Jellies, when in the middle of the jellies are introduced all sorts of fruit in season, and ia the winter such as are preserved in brandy. If you use preserved fruit, the jellies must be liqueur or wine jellies. The different fruits must be arranged with taste, and their colours well blended and con- trasted ; large fruit must be cut in slices. These jellies are best made by using two moulds of different sizes; the smaller mould is put inside the larger one, and surrounded by jelly; when it is fixed, the inner mould is taken out by using a little warm water, and the hollow it leaves is to be filled up with layers of fruit and layers of jelly, which must be put in gradually, and each allowed to set before the next is added; when the whole is set, it is to be turned out on the dish and served up. 371. Blanc Manger, or Orgeat Jelly, This should more properly be called Orgeat Jelly,ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. 185 as it is only milk of almonds sweetened, and fixed with isinglass. Take a pound of almonds, and pound them as for orgeat syrup (see No. 129) : !' they should produce a pint and a half of milk, to which add an ounce of clarified isinglass, and half a pint of syrup, as for clear jellies. You may flavour the blanc manger as you do jellies. It is likewise made of different colours. To do this, you must separate your milk into as many parts as you mean j to use colours; stain one part of a rose colour, another blue, another yellow, &c., and finish the jelly; then pour it into your moulds in layers of about an inch in depth, arranging and varying the : colours, according to your taste, only taking care to let each layer set before the next is poured in. With proper moulds,, you may make asparagus, or any other form you like, giving it the natural colour. You may use chocolate in this way, dis- solving four ounces of it in a glass of water ; or pis- tachios, preparing them in the same way as the almonds. 372. Pieces Montees, Baskets, Vases, Favilions, and other Articles, as Ornaments in S^un Sugar, Boil and prepare your sugar as before described^ and when nearly cold, have a stick, pointed similar to a pencil; dip it in your sugar, and raise your hand, and you will perceive it will fall as thick as twine; then having your moulds ready buttered, i form a mosaic, taking the shape of the object, which you must loosen before it is quite cold : replace it again on the mould, for it to retain its proper shape; but take notice, these objects are spun outside of the mould, by spinning mosaics flat upon a greased sheet in different shapes, and uniting them together^186 ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. soldered with the same sugar. Temples and pa- vilions of four or five feet in height can be made; and when the sugar is properly boiled^ and in dry- weather^ this work will keep several days : the- author has kept some pieces quite perfect for a' months by excluding them carefully from the air.

Pate Office, or Confectioner^/ Paste, SiFT^ on a marble slab^ a pound and a half of fine flour with a pound of sugar^ making a hollow in the middle^ to contain the whites of eight eggs; mri it up into a stiff paste; but if too stiff, add somei; more whites of eggs ; when of a proper consistence/ knead it with your wrists till perfectly smooth. This paste is to form the carcass or frame-work of JoViV pieces montees, which are to be cut out of it, of the size and shape of the dish you mean to use; it must be rolled a quarter of an inch thick; it will likewise be useful to roll it in bands or fillets^ supporters to the whole. You bake them on plates slightly buttered^ in an oven of a moderate heat'^ when half done^ draw them out^ and cut them t@. your fancy; you are to construct with them castleSi: paviUons^ Chinese temples^ hermits' cells^ pyramid^ cottages, Turkish pavilions, monuments, and any other thing the fancy may suggest. When they are cut out and exactly fitted together, put them back in the oven to finish baking. We will now give the preparation of the materials. jITALIAN CONFECTIONEK. 187 374. Confectionery Paste in Colours, Take one pound of flour and eight whites of eggs, ' and form a paste as directed above; the sugar must be perfectly white, and sifted fine, and half an ounce of gum dragon must be added, dissolved in a small glass of water. This paste must be very smooth and compact, and must be rolled out flat, about the eighth of an inch in thickness; out of this, you I must cut the design you propose, with a pen-knife, I the same as you would cut pasteboard; dry the I pieces in the stove, mount and join them together I with some of the same paste; to this add some gum I water, to moisten it, which you are to use as cement; I colour some of the same paste according to your I fancy (see Colours), and use it for moulding and borders, to be pushed in wooden moulds [sqq Mould- ing, No. 547), and joined together by this cement- ing paste: you may sand the ground-work with coloured sugar and ornament the whole with spun . sugar, according to your taste. 375. Coloured Sugars. Coloured sugar was originally used to embellish the plateaux, on which fruit, &c., was brought to table, placed in the sugar; afterwards crystal bowls, dishes, and vases were introduced for holding fruit, and then sugar being no longer necessary, coloured sand was used to ornament the plateaux, with which artistes of merit made the most beautiful designs, and even formed elegant landscapes; but from the modern alterations made in the arrangement of the table, and the want of ingenious men who can exe- cute this department of our art with success, few opportunities have been afforded for the display of•188 ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. these pleasing ornaments. There are two ways of obtainiDg coloured sugar : one for conserves (see No. 64)^ by working the coloured sugar till pul- verized; the other by pounding and sifting crys- tallized sugar to the required size; the finer par- ticles being taken away by a silk sieve^ as at No* 90; the sugar must be divided into as many partat as you want colours; wet it with the colour^ moistened in water (see No. 555), rubbing it in thi hand till the colour is spread equally: put it ott paper to dry in the stove, I 376. Of colouring Almonds, After blanching and picking your almonds, ; directed at No. 261, they must be cut small to th^ required size, and coloured like sugar; they are used to ornament different kinds of biscuits. Pis- tachios cut in pieces make a good green for pieces montees, &c.; they may be made darker by spinach green.—(See No. 563.) I 377. Almond Paste, Blanch a pound or two of sweet almonds, and let them remain a day or two in clean water: the next day drain them dry, pound them extremely fine,pass them through a fine sieve, and put back the residue to be pounded again. Continue this till they are all passed through the sieve, taking care to sprinkle them with lemon juice while you are pounding, to prevent them from oiling. Put your almonds in a pan, with half a pound of sugar to every pound af almonds, on a gentle fire; stir it with a wooden spaddle, that it may not stick to the pan; v/hea dry enough it does not stick to the fingers; take itI8d ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. off^ and when cold put it back into the mortar and pound it again^ adding half an ounce of gum dragon dissolved in a glass of cold water; pass it as for gum paste; half an ounce of gum is sufficient for two pounds of dried paste. In pounding it you add fine powdered sugar till it is sufficiently stiff for your purpose; it may be coloured according to fancy.—(See Colours.) You may use this paste for all sorts of pieces montees, giving it sufficient I solidity to form supports ; the articles made of this paste must be dried in the stove; it is likewise used to make the green moss to ornament groups of rocks; for this purpose it must be coloured with I spinach green; force it through a wire sieve with I your hands^ or a spaddle, and with a card take off I the moss^ in little heaps, which are formed by the pressure. 378. Sock Piece Montee in a Lake. I describe the mode of making this rock, merely to give a general idea of what may be done in this department of our art, as it would be tedious, as well as unnecessary, to give details of every article. There is hardly an object in nature which may not be represented in, or form an ornament to, a Piece Montee; and with so wide a field for the exercise of taste and fancy, we may safely leave the ingeni- ous artist to his own judgment; our object is not to make a large book, but to compress and give as much information as possible in the smallest com- pass, otherwise a moderate volume might be written on this head alone. Roll out some confectionery paste (see No. 373), a quarter of an inch thick, the size of the dish in- tended to receive it; put into a mould representing190 ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. your pond a lining of almond paste^ coloured pale pink^ and place in the centre a sort of pedestal of almond paste, supported by lumps of the same paste baked; when the whole is dry^ fix the pieces to one another^ taking care that it is perfectly dry and well joined, then put it into the stove. Boil to the great blow a sufficient quantity of syrup to fill the hollow of the lake^ to represent the water; having previously modelled in gum paste little swans, place them in various parts of the syrup ; put it into the stove for three hours, then make a small hole through the paste, under your lake, to drain off the syrup ; a crust will remain with the swans fixed in it, representing the water. You must now build the rock on the pedestal, with pieces of rock-sugar, biscuits, and other appropriate articles in sugar, fixed to one another, supported by the confectionery paste you have put in the middle, the whole being cemented together with caramel and ornamented according to your fancy. The rest of the piece must now be neatly finished : upon the top of the- rock could be fixed a China pagod, temples, pa-r» vilion, or any other thing you choose; the cascades and other ornaments must be spun in sugar.—(See No. 63.) 379. Roi/al Iceing, If you wish to mask the piece montee with iceing to imitate marble, take some double-refined sugar, pounded and sifted extremely fine; wet it with the juice of lemon and clean water, and mix it with a spaddle; when of a tolerable consistence, lay it on. parts of yoMYpiece montee with a hair pencil; when dry, it will make the finest possible glaze, and yoa may paint on it whatever you please.ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. 191 380. Of Grass and small Trees, or Bushes. I , There are different means of imitating trees and 1 bushes; a sprig of thyme must be the body of the tree, to which must be fixed leaves of pistachios^ or coloured almonds, cut to the size you want them, I or leaves of gum paste (see No. 527) made in a wooden mould, others with almond paste forced through a sieve, but the prettiest are those of candy, coloured green; for these last, prepare some hand- ! some twigs of thyme, take a candy box, five or six inches deep, according to the size of your trees, tie strings of packthread across it, to which you sus- pend your twigs, taking care they do not touch each other. Boil to ih^ Mow sufficient syrup to fill the mould to the trunk of the tree; place it in the stove for six or eight hours: strain off the syrup as for candies, and you will have some pretty little I trees; if you put them in candy a second time, they will come out ornamented with crystals extremely pleasing to the eye, 381. Marble Biscuits, Take the quantity you want of the paste for Savoy biscuit (see No. 406), divide it into four parts, dissolve an ounce of chocolate, and add it to two of the portions in unequal quantities, that one may be dark and the other light; for the other two parts take vegetable carmine (see No. 559); mix it with a little saffron to make it of an orange colour, and give one a pale, the other a deep colour. Make a paper case, and put in the pastes with a spoon to intermix the colours, so that when baked it may cut out like variegated marble; in another case it may be laid in veins; put them in a slackITALIAN CONFECTIONEK. 192 oven, that they may be two or three hours baking; take them out, let them cool, and cut them in pieces to imitate the stone, or parts of the rock which youj want. 4 382. Green Biscuits Are made in the same manner as the preceding, except that to the paste, when divided, you add to one part spinach green (see No. 563); to another^ saffron ; to the third red, and the fourth blue: you. thus have the natural colours of the rock. SECTION XX. Of Xiozeng'es and Wafers. 383. Rose Lozenges. Steep in rose-water the requisite quantity of gum' dragon, using only one ounce to eight pounds of sugar, as it is not to be so stilf as gum paste.— (See No. 527.) Proceed in the same manner, using very fine powdered sugar; colour it with vegetable carmine, or cochineal; if the rose-water does not give it a sufficient flavour, add a drop of essence of roses; when the paste is ready roll it out about the thickness of half-a-crown, on a marble slab very clean and even ; in rolling it out, use a little pow-^ dered sugar, or a small quantity of starch powder, to prevent it sticking. Cut it into difterent shapes with a tin cutter ; put the articles on a sieve to dry in the stove, and then into boxes for use. 384. Cinnamon Lozenges, Pound and sift extremely fine two ounces of good cinnamon, and make your paste as above; dissolve^ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. 193 the gum in water^ and work in the cinnamon with the powdered sugar; it may be made without pounded cinnamon, by adding the oil of cinnamon, and may be coloured with bol ammoniac: finish as above. 385. Orange^Flower Lozenges, Dissolve your gum in double-distilled orange- flower water, or add a drop of the essence of naroli to your paste: make it a fine white, and finish as before. 386. Tablets of Marsh^Malloto, Take four ounces of marsh-mallow root, cut it into small pieces, and boil them in a pint of water; strain them through a cloth, and put two ounces of gum dragon to steep in it, with a little orange- flower water; fill it with sugar; and follow the same method as before. 387. Lozenges in general. Whatever flavour you may wish to give your lozenges, the mode of making is the same in nearly all; but the taste is varied according to the essence you use; the colours should be appropriate, as if flavoured with, essence of lemon, they should be yellow; of oranges, rather darker; of violet, the colour of the flower; if of ginger, a little bol am- moniac may be used, &c. The essences must be used sparingly, as too strong a flavour is dis- agreeable. 388. Wafers, Haifa pod of Yanilla, 4 oz. of Sugar, half a glass of Brandy, 5 oz. of Flour, 2 Eggs, 1 oz. of Eresh Butter. To make wafers you must have an engraved iron, as in plate 11* Jig- 5. Take the vanilla^ cut it very NITALIAN CONFECTIONER. 194 small^ pound it with some powdered sugar; sift it through a silk sieve^ and put it into a pan with your liour^ eggs^ and brandy, and stir it all together; add your butter first, dissolved in a cap of warm milk; when the whole is mixed^ it must be quita thin, so as when you dip a spoon in the mixture, and hold it up, it must leave a velvety appearance on it. Put the iron on a clear charcoal fire, and when it is regularly heated, rub it slightly with a bit of butter tied in a rag, or a piece of rind of pork or bacon ; pour in a spoonful of your batter, taking care that it spreads equally over the engraved part of the iron; close the instrument gently, and put it on the fire; when the batter is done on one side, turn and bake it equally, of a fine colour, which a little practice will soon enable you to do; take it from the fire, pare it carefully round, take out the wafer, and turn it immediately on a piece of round wood, or in the shape of a horn: you may use any essence you please, instead of the vanilla. 389. Wafers in general use. 4 oz. of Sugar, 4 oz, of Flour, Essence of Lemon, 2 Eggs. Mix these ingredients with the eggs (whites and yolks) ; rub the lemon-peel on a lump of sugar, and add it to them, with sufiicient white wine to make it a proper moisture. Finish them as the preceding. 390. Cream Wafers Are made the same, except that cream must be used instead of wine.395 ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. 391. Nea]3olitan Wafers, Mour, 4 oz.; Sugar, 3 oz.; Fresh Butter, 1 oz.; Olive Oil, 1 oz.; 3 Eggs; Essence of Cinnamon and Cloves. Neapolitan wafers are made the same way as the preceding. Mix the sugar and flour^ put in your eggs (yolks and whites), and melt the butter in water, with an ounce of olive oil; add a drop of essence of cloves, and of cinnamon; finish as above. You may colour them pink, with the proper pre- pared colour, and yellow with saffron ; these wafers may be made of all colours, but their own colour is the best. 392. Flemish Wafers. Flour, 4 oz.; Sugar, 2 oz.; Butter, 4 oz.; the yolks of three Eggs; Yeast, \ oz.; Milk, quarter of a pint; the whites of three Eggs. To make these wafers you must have square irons, engraved half an inch in depth, with the two halves to correspond. Put your flour into a pan, and stir in the warm milk with the yeast, which must be strained through a sieve ; make your paste soft and smooth, and put it into the stove that it may rise; when risen, add your yolks of eggs (saving the whites), and the zest of a lemon, which you rub on sugar, and scrape into the butter; mix it well, whip up to a snow the whites of eggs you have reserved, and add them to it, stirring it gently with a spoon; to this may be added a spoonful of cream, as it will be a great improvement, but it must be beaten up like the eggs. Put the paste back in the stove, and it will rise to double its quantity; warm your irons, rub them lightly with butter, fill one side of the irons, and put it on the fire; as soon as it is done on that side^ turn it^ and N 2196 ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. when of a good colour^ take out the waferput them on a plate, and sift the powdered sugar over them. Add any flavour you please to the sugar, to suit that you have put in the paste, drying and sifting it as vanilla. SECTION XXI. Of Cool Brinks, for Balls, B»outs, ^c. 393. Currant^ Cherry, Strawberry, and Rasj^herr^ Waters Are in general made by mashing either of the above fruits, straining the juice through a sieve, and after- wards through a flannel bag; water is then added, with syrup, to the taste; strain it again through the bag, ice it, and serve it up very fresh. But the liqueur is never so transparent or clear as when the fruit is boiled in the water. 394. Orgeat Water. Blanch half a pound of sweet almonds, with a dozen bitter ones; pound them well, and add to them two pints of water, or rnore, to the taste, with sugar and orange-flower water, mix them well together, and strain and ice the liqueur in a bottle; it may be made with orgeat syrup. 395. Lemonade. Take the outside of the rinds of six lemons, cut as fine as possible, and put them into two quarts of water; then cut your lemons in halves, squeeze the juice into the water, and add syrup to your197 ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. taste; mix the ingredients well^ and let them stand for some time; strain the liqueur through a flannel bag^ and ice it. I , 396. Orangeade Is made in the same way, using China oranges in- stead of lemons. The above are the most pleasant, as well as the most wholesome drinks for parties at balls and routs, &c. Many other receipts for drinks have been given in former publications of this nature, and it would be very easy to enlarge the list, but none are considered so elegant, nor can be so safely recommended as the above • observing that orangeade is very superior drink when made entirely from the juice of oranges^ without any water. SECTION XXII. The Oven. 397. Of Ovens, HEEE are two sorts of ovens, the one brickwork, d the other of cast iron : the brick oven is the best, the iron one requires a constant fire kept under y to retain it of a proper heat; the brick oven must be heated equally, cleaned, and mopped out; and before you put your articles to bake, you must wait till the heat is fallen, that is, till the oven is equally heated all over; keep it closed till you are going to use it.ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. 198 398. Rich Plum CaJce. lib. of Fresh Butter, lib. of Sugar, l^Ib. of Flour, 2ibs. of Currants, a glass of Brandy, 1 lb. of Sweetmeats, 2 oz. of Sweet Almonds, 10 Eggs, \ oz. of Allspice, and \ oz. of Cinnamon. Melt your butter to a eream^ and put in the sugar^ and stir it till quite lights adding the all- spice and the pounded cinnamon; when you have stirred it for a quarter of an hour, take the yolks of the eggs and work them in, two or three at a time, and the whites of the same must by this time be beaten to a strong snow, quite ready to work in; as the paste must not stand to chill the butter, or it will be heavy, work in the whites gradually; then add the orange peel, lemon, and citron, cut in fine strips, and the currants, which must be mixed in well with your sweet almonds; then add the sifted flour and glass of brandy: bake this cake in a tin hoop in a hot oven for three hours. Put twelve sheets of paper under it, and four or five on the top, to keep it from burning. 399. Patience Biscuits. Six whites of Eggs, 8 oz. of Sugar, 10 oz. of Flour, Lemon Peel. Take smooth plates of copper, warm them at the mouth of the oven, or on a stove, and wipe them well, rubbing them lightly all over with paper and virgin wax, then let them cool for use. Break your whites of eggs in a copper pan, whip them up a little, add the powdered sugar and flour, and mix the whole with a spaddle {^qqplate 1. Jig, 12), with' some raspings of lemon peel, or of oranges, limes, cedraties, &c. Take a funnel, as m plate l,fig, 16,199 ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. fill it with paste^ and holding it in your right hand, let the paste fall in drops as large as a shilling, by the side of one another, as many as your waxed plate will contain. Put all the plates in a warm place for five or six hours, till the surface of the biscuits harden and dry, forming a little crust. Bake them of a good colour, in a hot oven. The funnel, or bag, to run this paste, must be made of linen, eighteen inches long, in the shape of the flannel bag; fixing the point to a pipe of tin, three inches in length, the width of an inch at the top, and as large as a fourpenny-piece at the bottom; having two circles of wire fixed in the top for the linen to be sown to. By pouring your mixture into the bag and squeezing it, you obtain your biscuits as described. 400. Prussian Patience, 1 pod of Yanilla, 4 oz. of Sugar, 4 oz. of Flour, 2 whites of Eggs. Mix it well together, taking care that the whites of eggs are beaten to a snow; finish them as the preceding. 401. Almond Croqui^noles. 4 oz. of Flour, 5 oz. of Sugar, 4 oz. of Almonds, 2 Eggs, Orange-flower Water, Blanch the almonds, and pound them very fine with the eggs; mix them all together; make a paste of proper consistence; roll it on the marble; cut it in small pieces, and make up in the shape of olives; arrange it on a tin slightly buttered, and pass over a brush dipped in yolk of eggs and milk.ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. 200 402. Spanish Nut Croquignoles Are made the same as the preceding^ only take care to roast the nuts, and rub them in a towel before you pound them; finish them by giving them the shape of the Spanish nut. 403. Savoyard Biscuits, 7 yolks of Eggs, 3 whites of Eggs, 6 oz. of Sugar, 5 oz. of Flour, the raspings of 1 Lemon. Mix these all together, except the flour; whisk it well till your paste becomes firm, white, and light; pass the flour through a sieve, and add it to your paste; dress it on a sheet of paper, as finger bis- cuits^ or any shape you please. 404. Queen Calces or Drops, 1\ a. of Flour, 1 m. of Butter, 13h. of Sugar, 14 Eggs, J ft. Currants, and the raspings of 2 Lemons. Melt your butter to a cream, in a basin, adding the powdered sugar with the lemon raspings, and stirring it for a quarter of an hour with six or seven pieces of cane, tied together in the form of a whisk, till it becomes quite light and white. Have your eggs ready broken, in a pot or basin, and put in three or four at a time, allowing an interval of five minutes, stirring your paste well every time you put in the eggs; when the eggs are all mixed, stir in your currants, being first well washed and picked; then add the flour, sifted, and keep stirring it for five minutes. These cakes, about the size of half-a-crown, are baked in a hot oven, with six sheets of paper under them.ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. 201 405. Champagne Biscuits, l!b. of Fresh Butter, IJft. of Sugar, 16 Eggs, 2ibs. of Flour, and about 2 oz. of Caraway Seeds. Break your eggs in a basin with the powdered sugar, and stir the mixture quickly, till it comes to a thick paste; as it will take a long time, if not stirred very quickly when you begin : have your butter melted to a cream, and when the paste is quite thick, stir it in; next stir in the flour and the caraway seeds. Put the biscuits in crinkled paper, afterwards on tins of the same shape as the papers, and then bake in a hot oven. 406. Savoy Biscuits. 15 Eggs, 1 ib. of Sugar, 8 oz. of Flour, and the III, Kaspings of Lemon Peel. Break your eggs, and put the yolks in one basin, and the whites in another; add a pound of sugar to the yolks, and a little grated lemon peel; work it with two spaddles, one in each hand, rolling them like drum-sticks, one over the other ; by this motion the mixture will froth up; continue to do so for at least a quarter of an hour, during this time your assistant must whip the whites with a birch whisk; when they are come to a snow and firm, put a fourth part of the yolks, and mix them well with your spaddle; then pour in the whole of the whites, and mix them gently, while another person must sift the flour over them. Make your paste smooth, which is done by well mixing the flour; lay the biscuits on sheets of paper with a spoon, or with the funnel with three or four holes. — (Seeplate ^.fg. 17.) It is usual to make the202 ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. biscuits three and a half inches in length; when the papers are filled ice them with fine powdered sugar, sifted through a lawn sieve on the table before you; throw the sugar over the first row with your hands^ and taking the sheet of paper up by the upper corner^ you scatter the sugar over the others, laying the surplus sugar again before you to ice the next sheet with; or, if you prefer it, the sugar may be sifted over the cakes through a silk sieve. After a few minutes, put them on plates, and bake them of a fine clear colour; when cold, detach them with the blade of a knife; they are generally placed back to back. 407. Sponge Biscuits. 10 Eggs, 1 lb. of Sugar, 6 oz. of Flour, and the Raspings of 2 Lemons. Keep the whites and the yolks of your eggs separate, mixing the sugar and lemon raspings with the yolks ; work them as above, adding flour of potatoes, or common flour. Fill the moulds, which must be first buttered, and then sift some sugar over the biscuits, like the cased ones (see No. 408); bake them in a moderate heat, and when they are of a fine colour, take them carefully from the moulds, and set the glazed side downward in a sieve, that it may not falL 408. Biscttits in Cases, 15 Eggs, 1 Ih. of Sugar, 8 oz. of Flour, Lemon Raspings, and the same Paste as the Sponge Biscuits. The only difference is, that when the paste is put into cases or papers, it must be iced with coarse sugar, sifted over them directly afterwards. ShakeITALIAN CONFECTIONER. 203 them on one side to take off the overplus sugar^ and j3ut them in the oven arranged in order on plates, j When the sugar is melted^ give your cases their in- tended shape: they are generally made of a square form^ and sometimes round_, like little baskets.— (See plate I. jig, 18.) Cut your paper somewhat j larger than is necessary to fill the moulds_, and make a circular mark with the knife on the paper. Then I fold the paper with the blade of a knife, held in } your right hand_, and the paper between the thumb ' and finger of the left hand^ and thus form plaits like the frill of a shirty round the paper^ to the circular mark. Put it on the mould and make it go into ! the box, which must just contain it; lean hard on i it, and cut off the waste paper with a pair of scissors; take out the paper, and the case will be of a fine shape. They may be made of all sizes. 409. Italian Calces, 8 Eggs, 1 lb. of Sugar, 1 Tb. of Flour, and the Kaspings of 3 Lemons. Ii Break your eggs in a pan with a circular bottom, I add powdered sugar and the lemon raspings, and whisk this till you observe it becomes thick, white, and very light; it will take half an hour beating at least, but the surest way of knowing when it is light enough, is by observing the bladders that rise on the surface, with which it will be covered in the space of a minute; when you see this, sift your flour, and mix it in as light as possible with a spoon. This is a round cake, baked on paper, about three inches in diameter; for the purpose of dress- ing it out, you must have a round wooden ring, the eighth of an inch thick, and of the proper circum-204^ ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. ference. Spread as many as you can on a sheet of paper, and bake them in a hot oven; when cold, take them off, place two of them together, back to back^ and put them in a warm place for two days; these cakes will keep good for a year, if put in a dry place, 410. Almond Hearts, 1 lb. of Sweet Almonds, 1\ !b. of Su^ar, the Easpings of 4 Lemons, 24 Eggs, and 1 ft. of Flour. Take your almonds fresh blanched, and pound them very fine with whole eggs; when you cannot feel any lumps in them, add your powdered sugar, and mix it well in the mortar with the lemon raspings, then take out your paste and put it in a large circular pan or basin, taking care to have a vessel large enough, as the mixture will fill a twelve- quart pan. Put the yolks of twenty-four eggs to your paste, and whisk it for a quarter of an hour; then break in six whole eggs, and whisk it another quarter of an hour; and afterwards six more eggs; and repeat the same again, making altogether eighteen whole eggs; if your paste be not thick enough, it will require a little more whisking till it becomes a thick paste, for the goodness of the paste depends more on the proper whisking of it, than on the whites of eggs ; then take the twenty-* four whites of eggs, and whisk them to a strong snow ; sift your flour, stir it well in your paste, and then put in your whites, and stir them in as light as you can; butter your heart-tins, and put six sheets of paper under them; bake the hearts in a gentle heat, as they will then keep their shape; if you bake them in too hot an oven, they fall in the sides^ and their shape is spoiled.205 ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. 411. Orange Hearts, lib. Sugar, IJH). yolk of Eggs, 4 caps of preserved Orange Peel, J lb of Sweet Almonds, the Kaspings of 4 Lemons, the whites of 8 Eggs, and | lb. of Flour. Take your yolks of eggs^ powdered sugar, pre- served orange peel^ pounded, the almonds pounded very fine, with rose-water, and the lemon raspings, and mix all together, stirring it with a wooden spoon in a circular-bottomed pan, till it comes to a light paste ; when the paste is very light, whisk up your whites of eggs to a strong snow^ and put the paste to them, turning it over gently till the whites are well mixed in; sift your flour, and stir it in as lightly as possible. Bake these biscuits in a slack oven, in tins, the shape of a heart, with five I sheets of paper under them ; observe to butter your tins well, and ice the biscuits before they are baked. To make these biscuits, use the same paste as for ! sponge biscuits, but whatever flavour you desire, add it to your eggs, when mixed with the sugar ; as an example for vanilla, take a pod or two of vanilla, cut it very fine with a knife, and mix it with pow- dered sugar, pounding it very fine in a mortar; then sift and add it to your paste; the flavour of orange, lemon, or cedraties, may be given by rubbing the fruit on the top of loaf-sugar, or grating it on a nutmeg-grater, or you may pound them in a mor- ! tar with some sugar, to obtain a more complete 1 essence. 412. Biscuits of different Tastes.ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. 206 413. Almond Dresden Bisciiits, 6 oz. of Almonds, 10 oz. of Sugar, 2 whites of Eggs, and Orange-flower Water. Blanch your almonds; pound them very fine with the two whites of eggs and some orange- water; mix the sugar; dip your hand in cold water^ and roll your paste in the shape of small olives. Arrange them on a sheet of paper within an inch of each other; pass your wet hand over^ and cover them with very coarse pounded sugar; shake the overplus from them^ and bake them in a slow oven. 414. Spanish Nut Dresden Bisctdts Are made the same^ using the Spanish nuts instead of almonds. 415. Imjjerial Bread, 4 oz. Almonds, 4 oz. of Sugar, 2 oz. of Flour, \ oz. Cinnamon, 2 whites of Eggs, a few Cloves. Pound your almonds with the whites of eggs; when very fine^ add all your ingredients, roll your paste the thickness of half-a-crown, and cut it any shape you please; when they are arranged on the paper_, make a royal iceing with fine sugar and kirchewasser; cover your cakes and bake them in a slow oven. 416. Muscovite Biscuits, 4 oz. of Sugar, 4 oz. Almonds, \ oz. Cinnamon, 1 oz. preserved Lemon Peel, 1 Egg. Cut all these ingredients with a knife, mix them with the egg; they must be very fine; sprinkle them over a sheet of wafer-paper; bake them in a207 ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. moderate heat; as soon as they are out of the oven^ cut them in any shape you please. 417. Little Belgian Baskets, Make a paste with very fine powdered sugar, the whites of eggs ; one drop of any essence you please to flavour them; the paste must be firm; roll it on a piece of marble, the thickness of half-a- crown. Cut it, with a tin cutter, oval, round, or square ; damp half of it with kirchewasser, or any other spirit; cover it with the other piece, the same shape; be particular in using the knife, not your fingers, as that would spoil the regular rising of the paste when in the oven ; taking great care that the side of the paste next the marble is always put outside the cake. Bake them in a very slow oven, they will rise two inches. When they are baked, fix on a small handle in gum paste, and with royal ice in a paper horn, ornament the tops of them : they have a pretty effect when ingeni- ously made. 418. Lefnon Calces. 1 ft). Sugar, f lb. Flour, 14 Eggs, 2 table-spoonfuls Rose Water, the Easpings and the Juice of 4 Lemons. Take your eggs, which must be very fresh, and be particular in separating the whites from the yolks, for if you leave any of the yolks with the whites they will not beat up strong; and you will not be able to make this biscuit good without a very good white. To the yolks add the powdered sugar, the lemon raspings, the juice, and the rose- water ; beat this well together in a pan with a round bottom, till it becomes quite light; this willITALIAN CONFECTIONER. 208 require half an hour's beating. Put your whites in a round-bottomed pan^ and whisk them till they will bear an egg, which is quite strong enough; pul your paste into the whites, and mix it very light with a spoon; when well mixed, take your flour, and sift and mix it in as lightly as possible. These biscuits are in general baked in small oval tins, with six or seven sheets of paper under them, in a moderate heat; butter the tins well, or you will find it diflicult to take out the biscuits; this is a very good biscuit, if well made. Take care to ice, before you bake them, but very lightly, as the less they are iced the better, so that they be done equally all over. 419. Brown-Bread Biscuits. 1 lb. Sugar, 20 Eggs, the Raspings of 4 Lemons, 1 lb. Flour, and 6 oz. Brown Bread. Take your eggs, separate the whites from the yolks, put the pounded sugar and lemon raspings with the yolks into a basin, and stir them with a i wooden spoon till light and very white; then whisk up the whites of the eggs to a strong siiow^ put the paste to them, and mix it very lightly, and sift and mix your flour with the brown-bread, pre^ viously crummed. Bake these biscuits in small tins, such as hearts, ovals, and squares, with six sheets of paper under them, in a moderate heat. ^ 420. Spanish Bread, 21 yolks of Eggs, 14 whites, 12 oz. Sugar, 6 oz. Flour, 6 oz. Starch, and Raspings of Orange or Lemon Peel. Take twenty-one yolks of eggs (reserving four- teen whites to beat to a snow), and put your sugar209 ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. a.nd a small quantity of rasped lemon or orange- peel to the yolks, beating them up well_, as for other biscuits; when the whites are beat up mix them together, while you sift over them your flour and starch, to be well mixed. Put it into tins, or paper cases, two inches deep; place them in a gentle heat, take out the tin, and when the bread is firm to the touch, take it from the moulds directly, and cut it into square pieces of the shape and thickness of dice; ice them with chocolate, white iceing, or any colour you choose; flavour them according to your taste, 421. Geneva Biscuits, 1 lb. powdered Sugar, 1 lb. Flour, 4 oz. Bitter and 4 oz. Sweet Almonds, 12 Eggs, and 1 lb. Butter. Put your sugar, flour, and almonds into a bowl, and grind or pound them with whites of eggs, then break in six whole eggs, and work it up with a spaddle. In another bowl put six whites of eggs, adding the yolks to your paste; melt your butter, pour it lukewarm into your mixture, and continue to work it till it is very smooth; beat up your whites, and when done, mix the whole together. Fill small round moulds, and cover them with white almond prawlings chopped small. — (See Prawlings, No. 110.) This paste is likewise put into long moulds, an inch thick; when cold, it is cut into lozenges, or iced, at pleasure, like the cho- colate biscuits; but if you wish to ice them, they must not be covered with prawlings. 422. Chesterfield Biscuits. 20 Eggs, 1 lb. Sugar, 1 lb. Flour, and 2 oz. Carraway Seeds. Put the yolks of your eggs, the sugar, and the o210 ITALIAN CONFECTIONEE. carraway seeds into a bowl^ and beat them up; into another vessel put the twenty whites, beat them up to a strong froth, and mix the whole to- gether ; while the flour is sifted over them, stir it in lightly, arid put the paste in a paper ease; "When baked, cut the paste into thin long slicesi and put them into the oven to dry. 423. Nut Biscuits Are made the same as almond biscuits, except that you must brown the nuts in the oven or on a fire; pound them fine, and add two whites of eggs. 424. Savo^ Cake, Use the same paste as for case biscuits (see No, 408); put them into a moderately-heated oven; and when baked, take them from the moulds, and put them back into the oven, without the moulds,. to dry them. Choose the moulds low, as they always succeed the best, the centre being always perfectly baked. Savoy cakes may likewise be made with almonds, nuts, pistachios, currants, &c*, and of every flavour. 425. Almond Cakes, 6 oz. of Sweet Almonds, \ lb. Sugar, 7 Eggs, 6 oz. of Flour, and the Kaspings of 4 Lemons. Pound your almonds very fine with whole eggs, then add the powdered sugar and lemon raspings, and mix them well together in the mortar. Take it out, put it in a basin, and stir it with the yolks of eggs till it is as white as a sponge paste; beat up the whites of the eggs to a strong snow, mixITALIAN CONFECTIONER. 211 them very Hglitly with your paste^ then take your flour and mix it as lightly as you can; the lighter you work this paste the better^ nor will you make a good cake without great attention in stirring and mixing your paste lightly. Butter the mould, and bake it in a slack oven, which is the best for all sorts of almond biscuits; this cake will take an hour baking, with ten sheets of paper under it, and one on the top. 426. General Observations on Biscuits. The pastes of which all biscuits are made are nearly the same; it is useless, therefore, to describe the almost numberless shapes and names that are given to this article; suffice it to observe, that the goodness as well as the elegance of the biscuits must depend upon the skill, taste, and ingenuity of the artist, and that such a person will never be at a loss to invent new forms and combinations— as rounds or ovals fixed together by marmalades or jellies; put up in white or coloured iceing, pow- dered or ornamented with sugar of different colours, pistachios, almonds cut, currants, chocolate, &c. &c. 427. Fine Spongati Italian Cake, One pound six ounces of white bread, dried in the oven and reduced to a coarse powder; one pound four ounces of walnuts, blanched, and chopped very fine with a double-handled knife; six ounces of currants, well washed and cleaned; five ounces of wild pine kernels ; five pounds five ounces of virgin honey, clarified; three grains of cinnamon in pow- der, one grain of cloves, one grain of strong pepper; and one grain of nutmeg in powder. o 2212 ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. The above articles must be mixed together^ and enclosed in a crust paste^ made of the following materials^ viz., two pounds eight ounces of the best v^heaten flour, six ounces of fresh butter; five ounces of loaf sugar, pounded; one ounce of olive oil, of Aix, in Provence, and half an ounce of salt, with a sufficient quantity of white wine to mix the whole. This paste, being of a moderate consist-* ence, is to be formed into round cases or crusts, into which the first mixture is to be introduced, and a cover of the same paste must be put on, which must be pricked all over with the point of the knife. Let them stand for a whole day, put them in an oven, moderately heated, on plates dusted over with flour : these cakes should be an inch thick; they may be iced or not, as you please. 428. Another sort of Spongatiy or Italian Christmas Cakes, Pive yolks of fresh eggs; one pound seven ounces of sugar in powder; seven ounces of bread, , dried and powdered; one pound two ounces of almonds, blanched and roasted like cocoa; four ounces of wild pine-apple kernels ; three drachms of fine cinnamon; three drachms of cloves; three and a half drachms of nutmeg; two ounces of preserved cedraties; and one drachm of ground pepper. This mixture must likewise be put into a crust or covering made of the following paste, viz., steep two ounces of gum dragon in twice its volume of orange-flower water, and put on your marble slab fourteen pounds of pulverized sugar, and six pounds of fine starch ; add your gum, and strain it through213 ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. a cloth like the paste for drops; form a malleable paste by adding a little white wine; make your crusty put in the above ingredients, and cover them with a large wafer-paper; make them an inch thick. You may have wooden moulds representing different subjects, into which you may put your paste, and fill the moulds as above, covering them with a wafer-paper. They must be kept in a stove in a gentle heat a day before they are baked, in a slack oven. 429. Rice Cake, with Butter,. lib. of Butter, la. of Sugar, 12 Eggs, fib. of Flour and ■| B5. of Eice Flour. Take the butter, melt it to a cream, and add your sugar pounded; stir it till it is light, then break in twelve eggs, thtee at a time, and keep stirring your paste all the time; when the eggs are worked, add the pounded rice and flour : bake this in a hoop, in the same way as a plum cake. 430. Rice Cake, witJiout Butter. 12 Eggs, 12 oz. of Sugar, the Raspings of 2 Lemons. J Tb. of Flour, and 6 oz. of Rice Flour. Separate the whites from the yolks of your eggs, whisk up the whites to a strong snow, then mix in the yolks, powdered sugar, and lemon raspings; whisk this over a slow fire, till you observe it come quite thick and light, which will require half an hour^s whisking. Take it off the fire and whisk it till quite cold, then stir in the flour and rice; bake these cakes in paper cases in a moderate heat; put four or five sheets of paper under them and ice be- fore you bake them.214 ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. 431. Fine Rush, 1 ib. of Sugar, 14 Eggs, 12 oz. of Flour, and about 2 oz. of Carraway Seeds. Take fresh eggs, separate the whites from the yolks, and beat up the whites to a strong snow ; in making this biscuit you must be very particular in having a good white; when your whites will bear an egg shell, whisk in the yolks and powdered sugar, with as many carraway seeds as you please; take out your whisk, and mix in the flour with a spoon. Bake them in buttered moulds, three inches wide and two deep, and twelve inches long, in a warm oven; when cold, cut them in slices, and brown them in a hot oven, first on one side, then on the other. 432. Almond Biscuits, 13 Eggs, 1 fe. of Sugar, 3 oz. Sweet and 1 oz. of Bitter Almonds, 6 oz. of Flour, and the Easpings of 2 Lemons. Separate the whites of your eggs from the yolks, and work them as usual with the sugar and almonds, which must be pounded with the white of an egg, to prevent their turning to oil. Beat the whites, and add them to the yolks, which must be likewise well whipt: sift and mix the flour, and pat your pastes in the moulds, or in paper cases, powdered with sugar, as usual. Some confectioners put chopped almonds all over the biscuits, but this does not look well, and takes away the beauty of the iceing. 433. Pistachio Biscuits, These biscuits are made in the same manner as the preceding, using pounded pistachios instead of almonds j you may add a little spinach, to colour215 ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. them as pistachios.— (See Colours,) You should always have some almonds and pistachios blanched, ready for use. 434. Aniseed Biscuit, Wolves' Teeth, The same as pistachios, except adding two ounces of aniseed instead of pistachios ; you must lay them in buttered paper folded like an open fan, and placed in tin moulds to bake them in ; when laid out, they are to be strewed with comfits dipped in aniseed. Take them from the moulds, when baked, and put them in the oven to dry. 435. Chesnut Biscuits Are made like almond biscuits, except that the chesnuts must be baked, v^ell picked, and pounded with the white of an egg, in the same proportion as the almonds. 436. German Biscuits, Take cloves, cinnamon, corianders, nutmeg, of each a quarter of an ounce, pound and sift them (or the essence of those spices will answer the same purpose) : two ounces of preserved lemon peel, and one pound of sweet almonds, cut into fine prawlings; mix these ingredients with twenty-four eggs, and five pounds of sugar, and as much flour as will make it of a malleable paste. Roll it out into squares, lozenges, ovals, or any other shape; when baked, put on them an iceing of chocolate, &c., to your taste. 437. Cream Biscuits. The same paste, adding only a few spoonfuls of whipt cream, according to the quantity you meanITALIAN CONFECTIONER. 216 to make; put it into paper eases^ and ice them like the others. 438. Another Cream Biscuit. 10 yolks and 5 whites of Eggs, 4 oz. of Sugar, and half a pint of thick Cream. These biscuits must be made to the minute you want them. Put the yolks of your eggs in a bowl with the sugar^ and add any flavour you choose (vanilla is the most agreeable), and well work the ingredients, while you make the whites into a strong snow ; when ready, add your yolks and whipt cream; mix the whole, and put it in paper cases; ice and bake them in a moderate heat; five minutes^ baking • is sufficient; serve them up quickly, as they will soon sink. 439. Coffee Biscuits Are made as chocolate biscuits, only add coffee, sifted through a very fine sieve, to your taste; you may also put a decoction of coffee to your iceing. 440. Chocolate Biscuits, Put into large paper, or tin cases, some biscuit paste, flavoured with vanilla, and bake it without iceing (that is, without powdering it with sugar); when it is done and cold, cut it into little squares, long lozenges, or any shape you like ; make an ice- ing with the white of an egg, and some fine sifted sugar, which confectioners call royal iceing, and a quantity of scraped chocolate melted in the oven, more or less, to your taste. This mixture must be sufficiently liquid, well worked, and shining; cover your biscuits with it, spreading it on with a knife; dry them at the mouth of the oven; you may ice217 ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. them to any colour you choose, adding the essence to correspond. (See Colours.) You may like- \vise make the iceing as conserve tablets.—(See •No. 221.) 441. Biscotini Pistachios. 'f 1 ft), of Sugar, 1ft). of Flour, 8 oz. of Pistachios, and the yolks of 20 Eggs. . Put your sugar and yolks of eggs in a bowl, mix them well with a spaddle, then add your pistachios and flour, and put the paste into two large cases, an inch deep; bake them in a moderate heat, and when cold, cut them in slices like aniseed cakes. 442. Biscotini Almonds Are made in the same manner as pistachios. 443. Mustacioli Biscuits, 1 ft). 11 oz. Almonds, 8 oz. of Flour, 2 ft)s. 8 oz. Sugar, 1\ drachms Pepper, 3 drachms Cinnamon, 3 drachms Cloves, and half a Nutmeg. Pound the almonds very fine, moistening them . with an egg; when extremely fine and smooth, put them on your marble slab, and add the flour and sugar; pound and sift through a silk sieve your pepper, cinnamon, cloves_, and nutmeg, and work the whole with as many eggs as are necessary to make any paste malleable and strong; roll it to any shape you please, and bake it in a slack oven ; the biscuits, when baked, may be iced either white or chocolate colour, or you may touch them with a pencil with syrup, boiled to a bloiv: they are ex- cellent, with the addition of candied dry fruits, lemon, orange, cedraties, &c.218 ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. 444. Firenze Biscuits, 1 ft). 10 oz. of Sugar, 1 ft). 14 oz. of Almonds, 1 ft), of Wal- nuts, 1\ ft), of preserved Fruit, 1 oz. of Pepper, and 1\ oz. of Spice of all kinds. Clarify your sugar in a pan^ boil it to the little thread, add the pepper^ the above quantity of spices, as cinnamon^ cloves^ and nutmegs^ in powder : then add preserved fruity that has been candied, as cedraties, lemon, orange, &c., and boil the whole during ten minutes; then add the quantity of whole almonds, half of which must be roasted like coffee^ and the nuts without taking off the skin; mix the whole well together, and leave it for a minute oa the fire; after which pour out the contents on a marble slab, to be worked with flour. Make the paste into small loaves, which bake in a moderate heat, covering them with royal iceing. 445. Gimblettes, 3 Eggs, 6 oz. Sugar, Flour, and Lemon Peel. Break your eggs whole, and add the fine sugar, and some rasped lemon peel; work it up for a few minutes with a spaddle, then add some flour, till your paste is malleable, neither too stiff nor too soft; roll it out, and form rings, as large as a crown piece; have a basin of boiling water, put your rings into it and take them out as they rise on the water ; they are then white enough; set them on a napkin or sieve to drain and dry; then put them on your plates, or paper, to bake, and let the heat be moderate; when baked, moisten them with the white of an egg, put them back to dry in the oven^ and that will make them shine.219 ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. 446. Ap^j^e Biscuits, . 1ft). of pulp of Apples, IJft). of powdered Sugar, Jib. of Flour, \ ft), of Starch Powder, 4 whites, and 1 whole Egg, and the Essence of Cloves. Take as many apples as will produce a pound of pulp^ bake them in a hot oven till quite soft^ then pass them through a fine hair sieve: put them in a copper pan^ and add the sugar and a whole egg with a little essence of cloves; whisk it over a gentle fire till quite hot^ then take it ofi* and whisk it cold; afterwards take four whites of eggs and whisk them to a strong snoiv; put your paste in^ and mix them well together/sift the starch powder and flour^ and mix these in together as light as you can ; dress them round with a spoon on paper, and bake them in a moderate heat; iceing the biscuits before you bake them. 447. Bitter Macaroons, 3 ft)s. of Sugar, 1 ft), of Bitter Almonds, and the whites of 8 Eggs. Take your almonds blanched, and dry and pound them in a mortar with the whites of eggs, which you must do by degrees, to prevent them turning into oil; when the almonds are perfectly pounded, put in the sugar, sifted through a silk sieve, and six or seven whites of eggs, according to the state of the paste; wet your fingers with water to prevent its sticking. These macaroons are to be dropped in little lumps, like balls; dip your hand in cold water, and touch them lightly at the top, to make them shine; they must be baked in a slack oven, and to be certain of its heat, put one or two first in the oven to try the heat; they may be run very easily through a bullock^s bladder, fixed to a220 ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. pipe : by filling the bladder with a paste, and press-? i ing it, you will easily obtain your macaroons of Sk round shape. ^ 448. French Macaroons. 1 ft). Almonds, 2 ft)s. Sugar, and the whites of 7 Eggs. These macaroons are made in the same manner as the bitter almond macaroons; it is difficult to I fix the exact number of eggs to be used, as the size of the eggs, the dryness of the almonds and sugar, frequently make a difference. [ 449. liiglit Macaroons, J ft). Sweet, Jft). Bitter Almonds, and l^^ft). Sugar. Cut your almonds into fillets, or small pieces; the bitter almonds must be prawlined white, or moistened with the whites of eggs; to make them, take part of the above with a pound and a half of sugar, which must be sifted over them through a silk sieve : to make them brown, put your almonds in the mouth of the oven, and when of a fine clear colour, mix them with the remainder of the sugar and the whites of three eggs, more or less, according to your paste, which must be of a sufficient consistence to drop. Wet your hand as usual, and touch them lightly on the top, to make them shine; when cold, take them from the paper. They may be made with nuts, filberts, or pistachios; the oven must be of a gentle heat. 450. English Macaroons. 1 ft). Sweet Almonds, \\ ft). Sugar, 6 whites of Eggs, and the Kaspings of 2 Lemons. Pound the almonds very fine with six whites of eggs, or a few more if required, as this depends orsx221 ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. the size of the eggs; feel the almonds, and if there be no lumps in them they will do; then add your powdered sugar^ and mix it well with the lemon raspings. Dress them on wafer-paper, of what size or shape you please; the general shape is oval; bake them in a moderate heat; when done, let them stand till cold, then cut the wafer-paper round them^ but leave it on the bottoms of the cakes. 451. Chocolate Macaroons, lib. Sweet Almonds, 3ft)s. Sugar, the whites of 8 Eggs, 3 pods of Vanilla, reduced to a powder, 4 oz. Chocolate, and a little Cinnamon. These macaroons are made the same as those with bitter almonds; melt the chocolate to mix with the paste, add a little vanilla, and some cinna- mon, according to your taste ; a small quantity of ambergris may be added, and two cloves ; or they may be made with chocolate only, 452. Spice Macaroons, 1 ft). Sweet Almonds, 3 ft)s. Sugar, 8 or 9 whites of Eggs, a spoonful of Cinnamon, 3 Cloves, and rasped Orange and Lemon Peel. Work these ingredients as for the macaroons, with bitter almonds, except that the spices must be pounded, and sifted through a silk sieve. 453. Fasting Macaroons Take their name from being used on the Continent, on fast-days, in nunneries and religious houses; in these macaroons gum dragon is used as a substitute for eggs; the gum must be dissolved very thin, in222 ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. common or orange-flower water^ and strained through a sieve by the aid of a spaddle; it pro- duces the same effect as the white of an egg. 454. Ratafia Biscuits, '■ ^ft). Bitter, ^ib. Sweet Almonds, 2K)s. Sugar, and 7 whites of Eggs. Blanch and clean the almonds^ and then pui them in your mortar^ with seven whites of eggs, and pound them very fine ; then add the powdered sugar^ and mix it in your mortar for a quarter of an hour^ as a good ratafia biscuit cannot be made unless the sugar be well mixed in. Dress these biscuits on strong paper^ or you will find it difficult to take them off; tie a pipe on the end of a bladder, but first cut a hole in the bottom of the bladder, so as just to admit the pipe_, then tie it with a string; this pipe is generally about an inch and a half long; you must have it longer or smaller in the bore, ac- cording to the size of the biscuit; fill the bladder with the paste, and drop it on your paper, but the biscuits must not touch each other; bake them oi^ plates in a warm oven; if your paper and biscuits are good, they will come off easily ; but if you find them stick, wet the paper at the bottom, and they will soon come off": in this case you must put then^ in the stove to dry for three or four hours. 455. Almond Wafers, \ Vb. Almonds, 4 oz. pounded Sugar, 1 oz. Flour, and 2 Eggs* Cut your almonds into very fine fillets, wet them with two or three eggs, yolks and whites together; add the sugar in powder, and the flour, and mix theITALIAN CONFECTIONER. 223 whole well with a drop of any essence you please; lightly butter a plate of copper^ tinned, and spread the mixture on it as thin as possible; bake it of a fine colour^ cut it with a knife into long squares, roll them on pieces of wood like hollow pillars, or give them any other form you may prefer. These wafers may be made of pistachios, covered with currants, and powdered with coarse sifted sugar; they are used to garnish creams; when in season, a strawberry may be put into each end, but it must be a fine one. 456. Fancy Biscuits, 1 fb. Almonds, 1 fb. Sugar, and some Orange-flower Water. Pound your almonds very fine, sprinkling them with orange-flower water; when they are perfectly smooth to the touch, put them in a small pan with sugar sifted through a silk sieve; put the pan on a slow fire, and dry the paste till it does not stick to your fingers; move it well from the bottom, that it may not burn, which it very soon will if not well stirred; take it off, and roll it into small round fillets, to make knots, rings, &c., and cut it into various shapes; make a royal iceing of difierent colours, dip one side of them in it, and set them on wire gratings to drain. They may be varied, by strewing over them coloured pistachios or coloured almonds, according to fancy. 457. Fancy Biscuits, pushed with a Syringe. 1 ft). Sweet Almonds, 1^ ft). Sugar, and 3 whites of Eggs. Pound your almonds very fine with the whites of eggs, then add the sugar, sifted through a silk sieve; make this into a paste, and put in what224* ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. essence you please; take a syringe^ of which the pipe must form a star (see plate II. 1) ; put. some of your paste in^ and force it by pressure to the shape^ and cut it into the proper lengths, as for rings, half-moons, knots, &c.; arrange them on sheets of paper, and bake them of a fine colour, in a slack oven. You may bake some of them the next day on boards, that they may only rise with- out losing the shape given to them; they may be coloured by adding the colour to the paste; but if this be the case, they must be baked in a slacker oven, or the colour will not stand, 458. Mould Fancy Biscuits, 1 ft). Almonds, 1 Jb. Sugar, and any Essence you please. Blanch and steep your almonds in water to whiten them, pound them very fine, and add half a pound of sugar, sifted through a silk sieve; put this in a copper pg^n on a very slow fire, stirring it with a spaddle, and taking great care that it does not burn. If it does not stick to the fingers, it is sufiiciently dry to be put back into the mortar, and pounded again with the other half pound of sugar, or more if necessary, to make it malleable. With this paste you may imitate any fruit you have a mould for, engraved on wood {s^e plate II. fig, 4); and colour the paste according to the fruit you imi- tate. To make the shell of a nut, fill your paste with powdered cinnamon.— (See Colours,) You may with this paste make anything you please besides fruit, as flowers, animals, and even temples, pyramids, or ornaments of any kind; it is in this respect like gum paste, and may be candied.225 ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. 459. Walnut Biscuits, 1 ft). Almonds, 6 whites of E^gs, | lb. Sugar, Nutmeg and Allspice. To make the shell of the walnut^ first pound your almonds very line, with whites of eg-gs; add the sugar^ mix this well together, take it out, and work in some nutmeg and allspice, to colour it. Cut your paste to such a size as will push your mould full, roll it in sugar, to prevent its sticking, and bake the biscuits on plates in a slack oven. 460. Walnut Biscuits, 1 ft). Jordan Almonds, \ ft). Sugar, and 6 whites of Eggs. To make the kernel, blanch and pound your almonds with whites of eggs, and when they are very fine, mix in the sugar; then take a small copper pan, put in your paste, and dry it on a gentle fire till it becomes quite stifi"; take it off" the fire, and when cold cut it in small pieces, as above, and push it in your moulds. Bake these biscuits in a slack oven, for they must have little or no colour; when they are cold, stick the shell and kernel together with a little melted gum Arabic, then put them in the oven for two or three minutes to dry. 461. Moss Biscuits, 1 ft). Sweet Almonds, 5 whites of Eggs, and \ ft), of Sugar. Pound your almonds very fine with the whites of eggs, add powdered sugar, beat this well in your mortar to a stiff* paste; then take it out and work it on a pasteboard, roll it out, and cut it in pieces the size of a walnut; dip one end in some cochi-226 ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. neal, and squeeze it through a wire sieve to the size of a halfpenny; fill your sieve^ and let them hang downwards as you push them; let them haug till they are dry enough to stand up stifF^ and bake them on plates, with one sheet of paper under them^ in a slack oven. 462. Italian Wafers, Cut some wafer papers of an oval shape, and spread them with French macaroon paste, very thin (see Macaroon Taste, No. 448) ; have some almonds chopped fine, but in pieces of equal size, and cover the wafers all over with them; bake them on arched pans made for that purpose, and they will form a pretty arch; bake them in a slack oven. Butter the pans a little, but you must afterwards rub them well with a piece of paper, or it will dis- colour the wafer-paper; take them off while they are hot. 463. Almond Faggots. Whisk up the whites of four eggs, and put in the yolks of three, with a quarter of a pound of powdered sugar, whisk this together well, then put in as many almonds, cut very fine into strips, as will make it quite stiff, but let the almonds be very dry; then cover the plate, or wire, with wafer- paper, and dress them in small heaps, as pointed as you can; bake them in a slack oven: when coloured they are done; take them out, and let them stand till cold, then trim the wafer-paper round them, but let it remain at the bottom. 464. Zephyr Biscuits, Pound your almonds, and sprinkle them with orange-flower water, to prevent their turning to227 ITALIAN CONFECTIONEK. oil; prepare the sugar, boiled to a feather, mix it with the almonds, and make it a malleable paste. Powder your table with fine sugar sifted through a silk sieve, and pour the paste on it to set it; roll it out, and cut it into different shapes with tin cut- ting-tools ; bake the biscuit in a slow heat. You may make them about the thickness of half-a^ crown; but when baked they will be about four times that thickness. 465. Ginger'Bread Nuts, 1 ft). Flour, J ib. moist Sugar, \ lib. Butter, J Sb. Orange, Lemon, and Citron Peel. 10 oz. Treacle, and 2 oz. Ginger. Sift your flour on a pasteboard, and mix the sugar and ginger with it; make a wall with as large a hole as you can, then take the treacle and fresh butter, warm them in a pan till the butter is all melted, and pour it in the hole on your board; then take the orange, lemon, and citron peel, pound it, and pass it through a hair sieve, mixing this in your treacle, and making it up all together into a paste. Roll it out with a little flour, and cut it in pieces as large as you choose; they may be made round, but the general mode is to pinch them up with your finger ; bake them on buttered papers on plates, in a hot oven. 466. Flat Ginger-Bread Nuts. lib. Butter, Sweetmeats, 2 oz. Allspice, 1 oz. Ginger, \ ft), moist Sugar, 3 ft)s. Flour, and 3 lbs. of Treacle. Sift the flour on your board, and make a wall; put in the treacle, moist sugar, butter, allspice, ginger, orange, lemon, and citron peel, chopped very fine, and mix these all together to a paste, p2228 ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. with as little extra flour as possible. Roll it out about the size of half-a-erown when on the sheets, flatten them a little with your fingers^ and bake them on buttered papers in a hot oven; take them off as soon as baked^ or they will stick to the paper. 467. Ginger Calces, 2vith Butter, 1 ib. Butter, 10 oz. Sugar, 5 oz. Ginger, 2 Eggs, and \ pint of Cream. Sift some flour on your pasteboard^ and make a wall; put in the butter^ pounded sugar_, pounded ginger, the eggs, and half a pint of cream ; mix this up with as much flour as will make a stiff paste, roll it out to the eighth of an inch in thick- ness, and cut it out with a round cutter to the size you like. Bake the cakes in a moderate heat, on plates on which flour has been sifted. 468. Ginger Cakes without Butter, 1 ft). Sugar, \ ft). Ginger, a pint of Water, 2 ft)s. Flour, and 8 caps of Orange Peel. Pound and sift the ginger, and add a pint of water; boil it on the fire for five minutes, and let it stand till cold : then pound the preserved orange peel, and pass it through a hair sieve; take the flour and put it on a pasteboard, make a wall, and put in the orange peel and ginger, with the water you boiled; mix this up to a paste, and roll it out (as above); prick the cakes all over4)efore you bake them. 469.

Portugal Cakes. 2 lbs. Butter, 2 Ihs. Sugar, 9 yolks and 4 whites of Eggs, 2 lbs. Currants, and a glass of Brandy. Melt the fresh butter to a cream, add the pow- dered sugar, and stir it very lightly with five or six pieces of cane, tied in the form of a whisk; work in your yolks of eggs two or three at a time, and have ready four whites of eggs, beat up to a strong .moWy and work them in immediately, as you must not have to wait for them, or the paste will become stiff, and work heavy; add the currants and brandy, and mix it well together. Bake the cakes in round tins in a hot oven, with six sheets of paper under them. 471. Cocoa Biscuits. 1 tt). Sweet Almonds, .1 ft). Cocoa Nut, 4 ft)S. fine Sugar, and 6 pods of Yanilla. Pound your almonds very fine with a little water, to prevent their turning to oil; then pouud the cocoa nut separately, which must be burnt and picked; when well pounded, add the almonds with the white of an egg ; and afterwards the pounded sugar, previously sifted through a silk sieve, and mix them with the paste; over which put the pounded vanilla, which must be sifted through the same sieve as the sugar was; then roll out your230 ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. paste to the thickness of half-a-crown^ and cut it with a tin cutter into rounds or ovals. Set them on paper^ and put them in the oven^ after slightly touching them on the surface with a pencil dipped, in cold water, that they may be iced; let your oven be slack. 472. Cinnamon Stick Biscuits. Take the quantity you want of the paste of fancy biscuit (see No. 458) ; add cinnamon in powder, and a little bol ammoniac, to imitate the colour of cinnamon; roll it out extremely thin on wafer- paper, cut and turn it on little rods, to imitate, as closely as possible, sticks of cinnamon; bake them in a slack oven. 473.

The various colom^s may be mixed, and thus pro- duce a pleasing assortment, as yellow and red to- gether, blue and yellow, red and blue, Sec. The paste, thus prepared, roll into little balls in the palm of your hands, taking care to wet them with a little water, to make them shine; set them on paper in a very slack oven, as the colours require I great care and attention. You may make little I paper cases also, like those for biscuits {^^^ plate l. fig^ 18), but they must be only an inch over, with depth in proportion; into these put some of the same paste; it is then called biscuit case; you may put a small almond in each, or some prawlined orange-flowers; always moisten the surface before you bake them. 475. Wafer Biscuits. 2 oz. Sugar, 2\ oz. Flour, the whites of 2 Eggs, a drop of Oil ot Cinnamon, and a drop of Cloves. Take the whites of eggs, melt the sugar, sifted through a silk sieve, and mix these articles with, the flour, and a drop of essence of cinnamon and cloves, making a liquid paste ; have copper plates, tinned, butter them slightly, and lay your paste on them, which must be very liquid, or moist, in drops, the size of a penny, distant from each other four inches; when the plate is prepared, increase the size of the drops by spreading them with the fore- finger till they are very large, and of the thickness of wafers; bake them of a fine colour; have a small roller to roll them on, like other wafers, or turn them into little horns; they are excellent to orna- ment a cream.ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. 232 476.

Have a board, about two inches in thickness, on which you put the meringues to bake, as they must receive no heat but from the top; when they are of a fine colour, take them from the papers, beat in, with the back of a spoon, the liquid part to form a hollow, and then put them back into the oven to dry the inside, which is to be filled with a cream or jelly, at pleasure, to be jjut in the moment you serve them up. Meringues are varied in taste and form, and may be ornamented with pistachios cut in fillets, and stuck in them; currants or almonds may be added. 477.

Of Distillation.—Of Spirits, Xaiqueurs, Ratafias, dec. dec. 483. Of Distillation, A PKACTiCAL knowledge of this art is particularly- useful to the confectioner, to enable him to obtain, at a small expense, the various flavours and spirits which he is in daily want of, and also to distil the choicest liqueurs which he may find it necessary to keep for the gratification of the amateur. The abuses aud vile sophistication practised in this de- partment of the business, are so notorious, that the confectioner cannot be too particular in attending himself to this important operation, upon which, in a very material degree, depends the success of all his efforts. First, you must have an alembic which will hold ten or twelve pints {^qq plate W,fig, 18), composed of two pieces, the cucurbit to contain the infusion, and the capital, or head, to receive the vapour, and conduct it into the worm, which discharges it into a receiver. To obtain the essential oil of plants, you must distil with an open fire, that is, with a fire that must immediately strike the bottom of the cucurbit; to distil spirits, the cucurbit must be put into a pan half full of water. Distillation with an open fire is the quickest; but it requires great attention : that with the bath is less expeditious, but more sure; it has also the advantage of preventing the article from burning, and is undoubtedly the best for ftie^ confectioner. Eill the cucurbit only three quarteirtrfull, to give it236 ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. room to boil^ and place it in a pan of water on the fire^ inclining it a little to the side of the lip or spout; then lute it well^ that is^ close it completely, to prevent evaporation. Take a lute, made of equal proportions of flour, whitening, and salt, mixed to- gether with the blade of a knife, and diluted with water; spread this on a piece of rag, and close all the crevices; the worm-tub must be kept full of cold water, which must be changed as often as it becomes hot, by opening a cock placed at the third of the height of the tub, as the water at the bottom will be cold, while that of the surface will be very hot. The alembic being thus placed, you must not quit it an instant; and when the fire begins to heat it, you must be careful not to let the contents of the cucurbit boil too hastily, and lessen the fire accord- ingly ; you must be provided with cloths, dipped in cold water, to put round the alembic, in case of accident, or if it should boil too violently. To operate well, you should keep a little streamlet con- tinually flowing from the beginning to the end of the quantity you are to receive. If you see the phlegm arise, which is aqueous and insipid, and any part of it gets into the receiver, that must be set apart, to be distilled over again, as will be hereafter mentioned. 484. Uose Water, The pale single roses are the best; they must be gathered fresh in the morning, after sunrise, in dry weather, because moisture takes off" a part of the perfume : pick off* the leaves, weigh them, and to every pound of roses add a pint of water; then put them in a pan with a handful of salt, and let237 ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. them steep for twenty-four hours. Fill the cucurbit two-thirds^ and put a bed of straw at the bottom of the alembic, as the roses are apt to stick to the bottom, which would occasion a bad smell in the distilled water. If the distillation is of twelve pints, the four first will be the best; the other four or five will be inferior, but they may be used to distil other roses, which will improve the quality of the water: if you wish to have it double, you must distil it again with fresh roses. 485. Orange-flower Water. Gather the orange-flowers after sunrise, and put hem, without picking them to pieces, into the ucurbit, adding to every pound of flowers two pints of water : this will produce a pint and a half to "^the pound. The fire must be kept equal while you distil, and the water will be stronger and more agreeable, if you take only the leaves of the flowers, and put a pint of water to every pound of flowers. 486. Distilled Waters of all hinds. By the processes above detailed, you may obtain any distilled water you choose : if you want lemon water, scrape or rasp some lemon peel, putting a pint of water to a pound of lemon peel, and distil it as above. Orange, wormwood, lavender, cinna- mon, carraways, mint, and all other plants, in the same manner; observing that it is better to let the plants steep in water for twenty-four hours before you distil them. To distil roots, or dry plants, they should be put to infuse in boiling water, before they are distilled.ITALIAN CONFECTIONER, 288 487. Of Sjoirits for Liqueurs. These are made by putting into the cucurbit, orange_, rose^ or any other flowers^ and to every pound adding* half a pint of spirits of wine^ or al- cohoI_, at thirty-nine degrees. Distil them in the bath^ as above, and the produce will be as much in quantity as the spirits you have put over the flowers. 488. Spirits of Violets. Take four ounces of pulverized orris-root, and* infuse it for a fortnight in a pint of spirits of wine.

Distil to four pints and a half. 508. General Ohservations on Spirits. The spirits just described may be made accord* ing to the strength of the brandy used; but for a certain rule, notice, that when the least phlegm runs into the receiver, you must take it away, and leave off* distilling. The phlegm is easily known, as it is white, and one single drop would thicken the spirit, and give it a bad taste. You must also mind, that the spirit comes by a small streamlet or fillet; for if the fire be too strong, you will raise the phlegm along with the spirit; in this case, you must cohobate, that is, put back what you have received into the cucurbit and re-distil it; all these spirits are used for liqueur drops, conserves, ices, and all other articles in which liqueurs are intro- duced.243 ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. 509. Ligiieur made with Spirits. One pint of spirits^ one pint of water^ and one pound of sugar. To render our distilled aromatic spirits fit for drinking we must add water and sugar. When you wish to make a few bottles of liqueurs, or factitious spirits, take a pound of fine sugar, dissolve it in a pint of cold water, and add to it a pint of spirits ; mix them, and let them stand for twenty-four hours, filtering them through blot- I ting paper, which must be folded and put into a I funnel in the bottle intended to receive the liqueur : the strength of the liqueur may be regulated ac- cording to taste. Dealers in compounds and cordials I filter their liqueurs through a thick kind of cloth, made by hatters, in the form of a bag; the bag is to be wetted with isinglass, clarified with white wine, by moistening it with a sponge, and wetting the bag regularly all over the inside; the liqueur then passes through it very clear. 510. Of Colouring Liqueurs. All spirits being white, liqueurs are commonly coloured, either to please the eye, or to conceal the defects of an inferior article; pernicious colours, as blue and violet, are sometimes used for this pur- pose; the rose and yellow colours are perfectly innocent: to colour yellow, infuse saffron in spirits of wine, or dissolve caramel in a little water (see No. 12), but the sugar must be burnt of a darker I colour; to colour liqueurs red, use prepared cochi- I neal. As the other colours are pernicious, we shall i not name the ingredients. Q 2Mi ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. 511. Ratafias, Every liqueur made by infusions is called ratafia; that is^ when the spirit is made to imbibe thoroughly the aromatic flavour and colour of the fruit steeped in it: when this has taken place^ the liqueur is drawn ofl^, and sugar added to it; it is then filtered^ and bottled. 512.

SECTION XXIV. Of G-um and other Pastes. 527. Of Gum Paste, The making of articles in gum paste is one of the most interesting branches of the confectioner^s art. This mode of decoration and embellishment was once in great vogue^ and the most magnificent and costly ornaments have been made of gum paste; but it has fallen comparatively into disuse; and, what is worse for the confectioner^ the fragments of the art have been transferred to pastry-cooks, and cooks, who have at once disfigured, if not destroyed, the most beautiful flower in the banquet of the confectioner. To make gum paste properly, great care and dexterity, much patience, some knowledge of mythology, of history, and of the arts of model- ling and design, are requisite—qualifications seldom possessed by the mere pastry-cook. The author, when at Paris, had many opportunities of knowing what might be done in this department, and every confectioner in that capital is well acquainted with his productions in this way. At a dinner given by the city of Paris to Napo- leon, then Emperor of the French, on his triumphant return from Germany, the author constructed a group, two feet in height; the Emperor, whose figure bore a striking resemblance, was represented standing, and putting up his sword into the sheath, led by Victory, attended by several allegorical figures, which were intended to express the various high qualities so liberally attributed to Napoleon by the French as long as success attended him. ItITALIAN CONFECTIONER. 249 was made for the centre of a table; and the Emperor, who rarely noticed anything which orna- mented the table, observed his portrait, and, with his characteristic attention to works of ingenuity, was pleased to encourage the artist by his approbation. 528. Fine Gum Taste, Gum dragon is the principal ingredient in gum paste; it should be white and light, and every little spot on it should be scraped off with a pen- knife : put into a pan the required quantity of gum, and pour water on it to wash it, which you may do twice; when clean, put fresh water on it to dis- solve it, from one to two inches above the gum; let it stand for twenty-four hours, then crush it with a spaddle, strain it very thick, through a cloth, that it may be clean, and let two persons wring the cloth. Should much of it be wanted, a press (as in j^late II. fig. 3) will be found useful: it was in- vented by the author when he was in the habit of mixing sixty or eighty pounds of gum paste every week, and he found it very serviceable. The gum is to be put in a bag of thick linen, tightened and fixed within a cylinder, pierced as in plate Yi.. fig, 3. When the gum is strained, pound it in a mortar, adding some extremely fine and white powdered sugar, a very little at a time : the great art of making this paste white, is the using of very fine sugar and gum, and having the mortar, as well as everything else used for it, perfectly clean; the use of lemon-juice, or any other secret, is mere fancy. When the paste breaks in pulling, it is done; keep it in a pot covered with a wet cloth. This paste is to be used in everything which is intended to be eaten.250 ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. 529. Common Gum Taste Is made like the fine^ except that to the sugar you pound it with_, is added some starch_, powdered very fine^ half sugar, half starch; it may be made still more common, by adding one quarter of sugar only, 530. ^ice Gum Taste. Instead of starch, use rice flour. 531. Plaster Gum Paste. Moisten some fine plaster of Paris with water, and let it set; dry it perfectly in the stove, reduce it again to powder; wet, dry, and pound it again, to take out the remaining heat; sift it through a silk sieve, and use it to fill the gum dragon instead of sugar. Marble gum paste is made in the same manner, using marble dust instead of sugar, of which there is to be none in either of these pastes; harden both with a little powdered starch ; it must be used half dry, to fix it, as it is apt to shrink very much. These pastes are only used for ornament. 532. Drying Oil Paste, When you have steeped the gum, as directed in No. 528, put it into a mortar, with nearly an equal quantity of gum Senegal, dissolved rather stifi*, and add pulverized sugar, to give it a body, or con- sistence ; when well pounded, and so that it sticks well, add a little drying oil, prepared from linseed. Take equal parts of starch, prepared plaster, and rice flour, with whitening, and harden your paste with this mixture; when your paste is smooth, compact, and shining, you have used oil enough.ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. 251 This paste is only fit for gilding or bronze, as it is never white enough for any other purpose. To bronze it, put some bronze-powder, with a hair- pencil, on the upper surface of the projecting parts. 533.

Fill a bottle half full of.garlic, picked quite clean, and bruised; fill up the bottle with the strongest spirits of wine you can obtain; stop the bottle lightly with paper, that it may not burst; put it into warm water, boil it till it is reduced one-third, and then stop it well for use. Put a small glass of this liqueur to your gum, pound them together, and fill it with the powder of alabaster, adding liqueur in proportion; finish hardening it with starch as you use it. This paste is very beautiful, and the best of compositions tor the confectioner, as it delivers well from the mould, and is very easy to work.—If you cannot procure Italian alabaster, use the stone plaster of Paris, in the same way as the alabaster powder. The Italian alabaster, when baked, becomes plaster. SECTION XXV. Of Modelling' Flowers, Animals, Fig-ureSp df.c. 534. On modelling Mowers in fine Gnm Taste, Divide your paste into the principal colours, as white, red, blue, and yellow; and with these252 ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. colours make the compounds green^ violet, dark and pale orange, employing the colour nearest to that of the flower you intend to represent. For ex- ample, to model a rose, you must have the calyx of the flower engraved in wood, and push it with paste coloured green; the heart you must model in yellow paste; fix it by a wire to the calyx, and with a little saffron, cut fine, and moistened with gum Arabic, imitate the seeds. Roll out your red paste very thin, and with a tin cutter {^^^ ]^late II. fig, 7) cut out the leaves \ take them singly, and, with a modelling tool (see ]^late II. fig, 6), roll them in your hand as thin as nature; then take up the leaves, and fix them one by one round the heart. When you have fixed a sufficient quantity of leaves, push the calyx in the mould (see plate H.fig. 7); and finish the whole, so as to imitate nature in the best possible manner. 535. Pinh. It is more difficult to make pinks than roses, the variegated colours not being easily imitated. Roll your paste, as if you intended to make a ballf flatten it between your finger and thumb, put it on a marble, and with the modelling tool (see plate II. fig. 7) make stripes at random, declining toward the edges, like the leaf; then fix it to the calyx, or cup. The calyx must be formed with green, paste, by rolling it in the form of an olive and cutting it with the scissors, at top and bottom, so as to make five or six marks, like nature. When your flowers are mounted, you will sprinkle them with red, by dipping a hair pencil in liquid car- mine, and striking it over your finger; stick the253 ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. down or feather of a quill in the middle of the flower^ that it may be a better imitation of nature. 536. Crimson Carnations, The leaves are made exactly as the pinks (No. 535), but the paste should be previously made yellow, with saffron or gamboge; each leaf, when shaped with the modelling tool, should be rubbed once with a small brush dipped in carmine powder, which will produce a very fine crimson; they should be mounted and finished as the pinks. 537. Jasmine, Take a ball of paste, and with a pair of scissors, cut six or eight strips about half way down, and with a modelling tool, worked against the fore- finger of your left hand, imitate the flowers of the natural jasmine. Any other flower may be imitated by following the natural directions given above. Much, of course, is left to the ingenuity of the artist, as it would be obviously impossible to give directions for every flower that may be modelled in this way, without an excessive enlargement of the work; and, as before observed, the author^s wish is to compress his observations into as small a compass as is consistent with distinctness. 538. Green Leaves. All leaves of plants or flowers should be moulded on the natural leaf—gather three different sizes of leaves of each plant; cast the mould with plaster or sulphur. Have some cutters made in tin the same size; roll the paste as thin as nature, cut it,254 ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. and press it with the thumb in the mould to take the impression; stick behind each leaf a very thin wirCj covered with green silk. When dry^ mount them according to nature. 539. Fruit in Gum Paste. Two kinds of fruit are made in gum paste; fruit of the natural size^ and very small fruit_, called jewel fruits. To make the large fruity you must have plaster moulds taken on fine fruit; make your paste the colour of the ground of the fruity roll it to about the thickness of half-a-crown^ ^Ppij it inside the mould, and take care to have a good impression of it. Powder your mould with starch powder, tied in a small hnen bag, before you apply your paste, that it may not stick; when nearly dry, join the two sides of the fruit, with the same paste diluted with water; when quite dry, take off the edges smooth with a fine file; smooth it with poHshing paper, and rub on the colour dry, with a piece of cotton; as red with carmine, &c. &c. 540. Horns in Gum Paste Are made w^ith or without mottoes, and are used to ornament spun sugar, vases, baskets, pieces monteeSy or anything executed in caramel. Take the necessary quantity of fine paste, of w^hat colour you please; roll it out as thin as paper, and stripe it with a fluted roller; cut them out with a tin cutter, about the size of a shilling, and have a piece of pointed stick (see jplate YL.fig. 11), on which turn the little piece of paste, to form a horn; moisten the edges to join them, that they may keep their form, and let them dry; if you wish to putITALIAN CONFECTIONER. 255 mottoes in them, roll them up tight, and stick one in each, with a little dissolved gum Arabic. 541. Shells in Gum Taste, Are cut out and made in the same manner, except that you leave the lips more open.—[^qqplate II. fig. 12.) 542. 'Pastilles, Mille-Fleurs Are made with fine gum paste, of different colours. Take a small quantity of paste in your left hand, pick off little pieces with your right; and with the fore-finger roll them on the gratings of a fine wire sieve, to take the impression and form of a shell; they may be scented with any essence you please. You may also have different pleasing forms engraved on a board, to answer the same purpose as the sieve, and to give variety. 543. Jewel Fruit in Gum Paste. Divide your paste into as many colours as you intend to represent fruits, as small apples, pears, peaches, apricots, plums, or any kind of vegetables ; in short, any object you may fancy. You must have moulds for melons, nuts, walnuts, almonds, cards, figures, and a thousand little things which belong to the jewel comfits; put different essences to the fruit, and form and finish them like the large fruit. If you wish to make a large quantity, you must have twenty or more of those little fruits, or other objects, engraved on a board; by this means you may make them with great rapidity. The author has found this so great an advantage, that he has engraved an entire collection of different fruits, &c.; they should not be larger than peas.256 ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. 544. Small Animals in fine Paste Are commonly made with double moulds, giving the back and front representations of the objects, which are afterwards to be joined together. You must push the whole quantity of fronts you would have, and place them in order on boards, or very smooth plates, that they may dry perfectly straight; taking care, when you push them, to put pieces of fine wire in the legs, &c., as they are apt to break. The next day you push the backs, which you must loosen gently in the mould; put the dry front to it, which touch with some liquid paste inside, that it may stick to the other; take it out, and with a modelling tool, join it exactly, smoothing it off with a hair pencil, dipped in water; colour them after- wards to your taste. 545. Animals in Common Taste, Articles made in common paste should be pushed back and front the same day, as this paste shrinks; when done, put them by on an even board till the next day ; they must not be placed in the heat, as they will dry enough without it. To join them, wet a marble slab all over with a sponge, on this place six or eight backs and faces, and let them stand a few minutes; then take one of each and rub it on the damp marble a little, in order to moisten the paste, which will enable you to stick the articles together; finish them as above. 546. Figures in Moulds, Figures are moulded in the same manner as fruit, and are taken from the mould by moistening a piece257 ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. of paste^ and applying it to the figures^ whicli will stick to the paste: the shortest and hest way is^ to strike the mould with a mallet, and the figure will come out directly; but in this case, the moulds must be bound with iron, or the strokes of the mallet (which must be struck on the same I side as the figure) will split the board. They are to be joined together, and finished like the animals. 547. To push in the Mould. Everything made in a hollow mould is said to be pushed, particularly fillets. Eoll your paste to the length of your mould, powder it with starch, which you must keep for that purpose, tied up in a piece of linen, and also powder your mould a little; put in your paste, and with your thumb make it take the impression ; then take off the re- maining parts with a knife, holding the blade quite flat, that you may not cut the mould. The fillet will come out very easily, by touching it with a piece of paste, which you must moisten, to make it stick. 548. Imitation of China, You must previously have the moulds of what you wish to make. Such as small fancy jugs, dogs^ heads, whistles, or any pretty thing in china, of small size. Use gum paste made entirely of very white sugar; roll it as fine as possible ; and shape it in the mould : do not leave any marks of the joins. Let them be well dried; pass them over inside and out with a hair pencil dipped in royal icing, which must be very white, containing a small portion of lemon juice and gum Arabic. RITALIAN CONFECTIONER. 258 549. Of Fixing Borders, Borders^ bas-reliefs^ figures^ indeed everything in paste must stand to dry five or ten minutes before you use them, to prevent spoiling the im- pression ; and they also shrink in drying, especially those in which there is no sugar. Use isinglass, or light glue, to fix them on pasteboard, paper, satinwood, or gilding; place them on your work in the most ingenious and tasteful way you can. 550. Of Modelling in Gum Paste, Figures, animals, birds, &c., are, without dispute, much better when modelled, than those made in a mould, as the modeller can give a grace and attitude to his figure, which it is impossible to obtain by the other mode. It is not so difficult to learn the art of modelling as is supposed : accustom yourself to handle the paste, and however bad the first at- tempt may be, strive to improve it, by copying from Nature, or a good representation, and with patience and perseverance, you cannot fail of be- coming a good modeller. 551. To reduce a large Figure hy a Scale of Squares, If you have a drawing of a large figure which you wish to reduce, you must divide it into small squares, both in length and breadth, and make the same number of squares, of smaller proportion, on another paper, and fill them with the parts of the figure that are in the corresponding squares of the large figure.— (See 'plate II. fig. 13.) I mention this operation^ as it is of great use to the artist^ITALIAN CONFECTIONEE. 259 and applicable not only to figures, but to orna- ments, and to most purposes of a similar nature. 552. On Modelling Figures in Gum Paste, Model the limbs by hand, and fix on the head with a wire; and afterwards dress the figure, making every part of the drapery of its proper colour. To model the hand, you must divide the fingers with a pair of scissors, and mark the nails and joints with a modelling tool: this method will be found much better than pushing the figures in wooden moulds, as is usually done. 553. On Modelling Animals in Gum Paste, Make your paste of the natural colour of the animal (that is, without its coat); roll the paste of the necessary length and thickness. Suppose for a sheep : model the end of your paste to the head; give it the attitude; then model and fix on the legs, and let it dry; when dry, repair it neatly with a penknife, and a bit of sandpaper, or a file : then take some very white paste, make it rather thin with water, and cover it thinly all over: with a notched quill (as in j^^^^l^ H- fi9' 10) form the frizzled appearance of the wool, and comb the animaVs head and body with it to imitate nature. 554. Birds in Gum Paste, Make the body of the bird in the same manner as for animals; have the wings carved on wood, according to the size of the bird, push them, and paint them afterwards. E 2260 ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. SECTION XXVI. Of Colours for Confectionery. 555. Of Colours for Confectionery. The colours used in confectionery are generally harmless; for though no one thinks of eating an ornament or figure, yet such colours as vermilion, verdigris, yellow ochre, and many others which are poisonous, should be avoided, if possible. 556. To choose Cochineal, Cochineal should be large, clean, heavy, dry, of a silvery shining colour, and, when bruised, of a dark red. 557. Of ^rejoaring Cochineal, Take an ounce of cochineal, pound it well, and make a soft lye with wood-ashes boiled in water; clear it off through a flannel bag; take a pint of it, let it boil up, and put in your cochineal; pound a quarter of an ounce of alum and a quarter of an ounce of cream of tartar, and add them to the cochineal; and reduce it by boiling, till it becomes '| of a very dark fine red ; if it is for keeping, add pulverized sugar. You may use this colour in everything, particularly in gum paste, compotes, preserves, jellies, ices, &c. If you cannot obtain wood-ashes, you can substitute it by a dissolution of two ounces of wormwood salts in a pint of water. 558. Carmine, Carmine No. 1 is the best, though the dearest, as the inferior article is generally adulterated with \261 ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. cinnabar; but you may easily manufacture ear- mine^ as follows :—Take a boiler sufficiently large to contain two pails and a half of river water, per- fectly clear; put it on the fire, and when it boils, shake in gently a pound of cochineal, ground in a new coffee mill; stir it with a clean hair pencil, and if the heat be too great, lessen your fire, and throw in a glass of cold water, that the cochineal may not boil over; let it boil for half an hour, then add an alkaline lye, prepared as follows. Boil three quarters of an ounce of pulverized soda in two quarts of water, for eight or ten minutes ; take it off, filter it, put it into your cochineal; let it boil up five or six times ; take off the boiler, place it in a slanting position, that the cochineal may deposit; add to it three quarters of an ounce of powdered alum, stir it well, to dissolve the alum, and let it stand for twenty-five minutes. See if it takes a fine scarlet colour; pour off the liquor very gently into another clean boiler, and do not stir it much, to avoid dividing the deposit; beat up the whites of two eggs in a pint of water, pour it into the colour; stir it well, put the boiler on the fire till it nearly boils; the whites of the eggs will coagulate, and precipitate with the colouring particles which are to form the carmine. Take the boiler off, and let the carmine settle for twenty-five minutes; pour off the liquid till you see the carmine at the bottom, which will be like thick milk; pour it into an earthen pan or bowl, strain it through a fine cloth, to let the moisture run from it, and drain the car- mine. You must strain the liquid several times, till it is quite clear; when the carmine is drained, and has a proper consistence, take it up with a silver spoon, lay it on plates to dry in the stove, and, when dry, grind it on the stone.ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. 262 559. Vegetable Carmine. 2 lbs. Brazil Wood, 2 oz. Cochineal, 2 oz. Kock Alum, 2 oz. Sal Ammoniac, 8 oz. Spirit of Salt, 1 ft). Nitric Acid, 8 oz. Pewter, 2 oz. Cream of Tartar. Divide the alum into four parts^ and boil the Brazil wood in eight pints of water^ with the pul- verized cochineal tied in a piece of cloth ; when re- duced to half, take it from the fire_, put into it one of your parcels of alum; strain the decoction through a cloth_, into a pan; put back the chips on the fire with the same quantity of water : reduce it as at first; strain it off, and repeat the same four times, putting one part of the alum each time. At the last boiling, add two ounces of sal ammoniac, and put the whole together into a pan, keeping it warm. Put your nitric acid into a long-necked bottle, with the eight ounces of spirit of salt; place it in a pan full of water; fix it so as not to move; warm the water more than lukewarm, and put in your pewter filings by small quantities, and continue this gradually as you see it dissolve. When the whole is dissolved, pour it into the decoction, mix it well, strain it through a cloth, and let it stand for twenty-four hours; then pour off the yellow water till you come to the colour; fill up your pan with clean water, and repeat this morn- ing and evening for eight days, when you will find the water quite clear, leaving no salt or acid in the colour. Keep it in a pot for use, always having some clean water on it to preserve it in a liquid state. 560. Gamboge, This is a gum, and must be dissolved in cold, or lukewarm water, to cok)ur gum paste.

Saffron Must be infused in warm water; it should be chosen very dry and soft^ in long shreds of a fine red colour, and of a pleasant balsamic taste : it is a good stomachic. 562. Sap Green. This is prepared from the fruit of the buckthorn; it is in a hard paste_, and must be dissolved in water for use, to paint gum paste; it is not good to eat in large quantities. 563. Spinach Green, Take the necessary quantity of spinach, pound it well, and squeeze the juice through a cloth ; put it in a pan, on a strong fire, stir it with a spoon, and as soon as you see it look curdy take it off the fire, and strain the liquor through a silk sieve; what remains on the sieve will be the colour. 564. Ivory Black Is made with ivory cut in small pieces, and calcined in the fire in a covered pot or crucible, till it ceases smoking: it is only used to paint gum paste. 565. Prussian Blue, Prussian blue is to be preferred by the confec- tioner, thou^o^h it must be used sparingly ; the turn- sole and indigo afford a bad colour.ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. 264 566. Vermilion and Cinnabar Are two different shades of a lively red colour; they are equally dangerous^ and should never be used in confectionery unless absolutely indis- pensable. 567. Bol Ammoniac Is of a reddish colour^ something like cinnamon, and used for gilding (see No. 572), or to paint' gum paste, as well as brown umber, and bistre. 568. Of using Colours, The colours just mentioned, are those used to paint gum paste \ they are ground on a marble slab, and are moistened with water, and a little gum Arabic dissolved and strained through a cloth, with a pinch of fine powdered sugar, or sugar candy; the gum is to fix the colour, and the sugar to make it shine; if you have no gum, you may use isinglass, but then the colour must be warm. 569. Colours good to eat. The colours fit to eat are cochineal, carmine di- luted, saffron, spinach green, Prussian blue, and colours made with chocolate and caramel; caramel should be diluted with a little water, as it goes farther than the dry powder; yet in some cases it must be used dry, as in the royal iceing, and in articles for the small oven : saffron must be infused in hot water, consequently you must put the ne- cessary quantity to your sugar a moment before it is done; it will require a few minutes more boiling, as the saffron will lessen the degree of heat; s]^inachITALIAN CONFECTIONER. 265 green is to be used to colour opaque bodies; such as are transparent must be coloured with a little Prussian blue^ mixed with yellow ; if Hue alone be wanted^ it must be ground with a little water, taking care to use but a small quantity of it; browns may be made of chocolate, a strong decoction of coffee, or caramel burnt and dissolved in water; the violet colour is made with red and blue; orange with saffron and red; and the green with yellow and blue. SECTION XXYII. Of Varnishing' and G-ilding'. 570. Varnish for Gum Faste, Three quautees of a pound of gum Arabic, or Senegal, dissolved in warm water; beat up the whites of six eggs, throw them into a sieve to re- ceive their oil, and mix it with the gum ; take three quarters of a pound of fine sugar, clarify it, and boil it to a blow; take it from the fire, put it in a glass of spirits of wine, and when cold, mix the whole, and bottle it for use; if too thick when wanted, add a little spirits of wine. This varnish is per- fectly harmless. 571. Of Gilding Gum Faste, This department is so extensive, that it would be impossible to describe the great variety of articles that are gilt, and the mode of gilding them; we shall therefore give some general directions, which will be quite sufficient to enable every confectioner to gild the different articles for which he may haveITALIAN CONFECTIONER. 266 occasion^ and will enable him to imitate, successfully, everything made in bronze, porcelain, wood, or pasteboard, and a great variety of other little articles made for presents to young persons, for jAeces montees, ornaments, and embellishments of the table. -—(See Decorations, No. 582.) The piece you mean to gild must be previously prepared and polished; if intended to be eaten, prepare it as follows :— Take gum Arabic, dissolved, and strained very clean; grind it with nearly an equal quantity of white sugar candy, it must be rather stiff, spread it with a pencil, rather hard, on the parts you wish to gild; when dry, breathe on the part, and apply the gold leaf; when this has dried, take off the gold that has not fixed with a fine hair pencil, and your gild- ing will be bright. 572. Burnished Gilding, Take about the size of a nut of bol ammoniac, sugar candy about the size of your thumb, grind them together dry, beat up the white of an egg, and throw it on a sieve to receive its oil, which you must use to grind it again; put a thin coat on the article you mean to gild, but do not put on your gold till the egg is perfectly dry; when you put on the gold leaf^ wet the part with cold water. 573. Oil Gilding, Put a light coat of isinglass on your gum paste; when dry, see that it has taken equally, if not, give it another coat; when perfectly dried, take some prepared linseed oil, lay it on equally and light with a pencil rather blunt; dry it till it sticks to your fingers when you touch it: apply your gold, and267 ITALIAN CONFECTIONEK. fill the liollows with the broken and waste parts of it; rub it with a dry pencil to make it take equally^ and become uniformly brilliant. The time necessary for drying it varies very much^ according* to the goodness of the oil, the season, and the heat of the room : sometimes six hours are sufficient, but it sometimes requires twelve hours. 574. Method of prejjaring Linseed Oil for Size, Colourmen in general sell the prepared linseed oil; yet it is convenient to know the preparation of it. Pour some linseed oil into a new glazed pan, double the size of its contents, put it on a moderate fire, just sufficient to make it boil slowly : add two ounces of litharge, tied up in a cloth, and a dozen cloves of garlic, picked; let it boil for four or six hours ] you will know when it is done enough, if on dipping a straw in it, and holding it up, you see the oil drop clear, and of a fine gold colour, but thick; take great care not to let it boil over, as it is very inflammable. SECTION XXVIII. Of Mould Making*, Moulding-, and Modelling* in Wax. 575. Of Mould Making. The art of moulding and counter moulding is one of considerable utility, as by means of it we obtain, with ease, moulds that it would have been very difficult and expensive to engrave. By the practice of this art, however, we have only to procure a good cast of an object we approve, and from this we areITALIAN CONFECTIONER. 268 enabled to form our own mould at a very trifling expense. You must proceed as follows : almost all the small figures^ or animals^ made in Prance or Germany^ are executed in common paste^ and con- sequently liable to take the damp. Put the figures into a pasteboard or deal box^ between two towels, or other linen; place them in a cellar for eight days j if made of very common paste^ three days will be sufficient; they will easily part in two with the blade of a knife; then they may be moulded, as will be seen in No. 579. These figures are generally put together with light paste, moistened with water : but whatever the cement may be, that part of the figure where it is joined is the weakest; consequently, by put- ting them in a warm stove, or in an oven, the great dryness which takes place will open your figures in. two parts; if they are made of fine sugar, you must have two figures alike, placing the back of one to the face of the other on wet linen; you can easily fit them together afterwards. Place them on a marble to receive the composition, and if your mould is in plaster, you must put some prepared linseed oil on it, that the sugar may not melt. 576. Stucco Moulds, Prepare the pieces you intend to mould, as for the sulphur (see the following article); have slips of glass of the length and breadth of your moulds, place them to form a frame for it, and take some fine plaster, wetting it with water in which you have melted some glue and salt; pour this on your paste, and strike the table a little, to make it fall into every hollow, and to prevent its blowing.269 ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. This mould will become very hard^ and more solid than the sulphur mould; the slips of glass are used to prevent the knife from cutting the mould; the glue hardens the plaster^ and forms the stucco, and the salt makes it take quickly; but however well they are made, they are never equal to wooden moulds. 577. Sulphur Moulds, Such articles as are in two pieces may be moulded in different compositions; the thing to be moulded must be fixed on a marble or glass table, very dry, and surrounded with a piece of pasteboard; to prevent it from running over, and to give the mould the form of a long square; prepare pieces of bent wire the length of your mould, which being placed in directly you put your composition, will strengthen it. Oil lightly the articles you intend to mould, with a hair pencil; put some sulphur in a glazed earthen pipkin, sufficient to cover your article three-eighths of an inch, and melt it on the fire; when it is melted and clear, and begins to thicken by the heat, take it from the fire, and add to it half its weight of pounded slate, brick, marble, iron, or brass filings, which must have been pounded and sifted through a silk sieve; mix, and stir it with a stick: and when it is well mixed, and smooth, pour it into your mould, not over the paste, but by the side of it, and the sulphur will find its level softly without blowing; when you see it covered, lay on your wires, put a little more over them; if you wish them stronger, put some plaster, and take off the mould with the blade of a knife; should anything stick fast in them, put them to soak in cold water.ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. 27Q 578. Leaden Moulds, Leaden or pewter moulds are used to run grained sugar into, and for caramel and ices in fruit shapes. Model the article you intend to mould, either in clay or wax (see Modelling in Wax, No. 580); or if you have it cut in wood, take an exact mould of it in plaster, as the leaden mould is to be in two or more parts, that it may deliver well; when exactly prepared, it will be necessary to m.ake another mould from it: oil your mould, that the plaster may not stick to it. Each division of the mould should be moulded in two other parts ; these are to be given to the founder to be cast in metal. The mould as it comes from the founder's is very rough, and particles of sand are fixed in it, especially if the cast be common; it must, therefore, be put in a pan with two-thirds of aqua-fortis, and one-third of water, to pickle it; wash it clean, and with files and cutting tools chase or repair it like the model; in this mould, when thus prepared, you ran lead, or pewter, having left an opening to receive it; the mould must be heated, that the metal may run smoothly in every part of the hollow; open the mould, take out the cast, join the two parts together neatly, and finish them with a file, as directed for the first mould made in plaster. You may have, by this process, as many moulds as you please, at a trifling expense. 579. Plaster Moulds. Take the vase, figure, &c. you intend to mould, whether in wood or any other composition, and ac- cording to its form prepare to make your mould in two or four parts or divisions^ with a view to its271 ITALIAN CONFECTIONEE. delivering well; put round each of these divisions a fillet or wall of pipe-clay to retain the liquid plaster, and prevent it from running over; run some plaster in it, about two inches thick; when it is set, which you will know by its being hot, take that piece or division off, repair it neatly, and with a knife cut notches in the edges, that the parts may fit closely when joined; oil it with a hair pencil, and put it again on the object with pipe- clay ; repeat the operation, with another division: you will leave then one-half of your mould formed in two pieces. Repair and cut notches in the fresh quarter, that the parts may -fit each other, and be firm : make the other two divisions in the same manner. You will then have the whole of your mould in four pieces, which you must dry in the stove. When dry, you may harden it by rubbing some linseed oil on it (see No. 574); dry it after- wards again in the oven, and oil and dry it several times, as before. These moulds will serve for rock sugar.—(See No. 228.) 580. Modelling Wax. Put into a new pipkin six ounces of rosin, one pound of bees^-wax, two ounces of lard, and four ounces of flour; colour it with vermilion; stir the whole on a gentle fire, and when melted and well mixed, pour it into a paper case, to use it for modelling figures, &c. 581.

The decoration of the table regards chiefly the arrangement of the Dessert, which should consist of Assiettes Montees, baskets of fruit and flowers, a variety of bon-bons, porcelain figures, glass, &c., which should all be arranged with taste and elegance. The art of decoration was formerly carried to a great extent in France, immense sums were expended upon it, and many of the first artists in the difi'erent departments were employed; the whole, when completed, had the appearance of enchantment. The author is proud to enumerate among his friends, Messrs. Monprive, Leccelan, and Cocard, who have executed decorations and'' embelhshments for the table, which will probably never be surpassed. But this ornamental style of arranging the dessert is not much used in England, a few Assiettes Montees only being employed to decorate the table. Farewell, then, fine groupes, allegorical subjects, trophies, country sports, land- scapes, and mythological emblems! Till better' times shall arrive, we must content ourselves with the simple Assiettes Montees: the construction of which, and the materials composing them, we shall describe.ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. 273 583.

Take fine white paper^ not stiffened (common paper will do for the inside), and place the sheet on a board, usin^ some of the paste described in No. 584, and making it thin with water, so as to use it like oil paint: then spread your paste on a sheet of white paper with a large brush, put over it another sheet of coarser paper, and a second or third, according to the strength you mean to give it, with a layer of paste between each sheet, and cover the top one with a sheet of fine paper. You should have paste- boards of every thickness, some even with fifteen sheets of paper, as some must be thin enough to turn, and others thick, to form the bottoms of your work. Press the sheets till the overplus of the paste is forced out, screw down the press and leave them for two days, till equally moistened through- out ; then hang them up with wire hooks, in any airy place, neither in the heat nor in the sun, and let them dry gradually ; when perfectly dried, they may be polished by a burnisher of flint, set in a long handle and fixed to the ceiling, the paper being placed on a polished stone table; if you can- not have a table, or regular burnisher, the rib of an ox, or the bottom of a glass bottle, will answer the same purpose. 584. Paste to maJce Pastehoard. Take three or four ounces of rock alum, pound and melt it in six pints of water, and moisten a pound of flour with that water; strain it throughITALIAN CONFECTIONER. 274 a sieve, thafc no lamps may remain; put it on the fire, stir it with a spaddle, and when thick and done enough, put it in a pan for use. A skin will form on the paste, and when you want to use it, do not break that skin, or use any of it, but raise it gently and take the paste from under it, as the skin will preserve the paste for a long time. Starch paste is made in the same way, using starch instead of flour. 585. Taste for joining Vasteboard, Many pastes are used to join pasteboard; some- times the above, isinglass, glue, or gum paste, which is composed of gum Senegal, melted thick with flour, and a few cloves of garlic. The older gum paste is, the stronger it gets: if the crust formed round the pots is preserved, and mixed with the fresh paste, it is said to increase its strength greatly. 586. Silver Pajjer. The most ready manner of making silver paper is with starch paste: to render it more easy to fix on the silver leaf, cut the paper in strips, the size of the silver book ; put your paste, with great care, very even, with a hair pencil on the paper, open the book, and present the silver leaf to it, which will instantly take it up; put another near it, and so on to the end of the strip; then hang it up to dry; when dry, rub it with cotton, to take off the parts which have not stuck; add a bit of paste, and some silver-leaf, to mend those parts which may have escaped : when the silver is fixed all over, and dry, put a slight layer of the same paste on it, to pre- vent its discolouring; without this precaution, the air would spot and change its colour and make itITALIAN CONFECTIONER. 275 grey, so that it would be unfit for use; this paper is used to make borders^ &c., for the Assiettes Montees, 587. Gold Tamper. Dead gold is made in the same manner as the preceding, adding a little saffron to the paste. If you want gold papers of a large size, you must have a gilder^s cushion covered with leather, which is used to spread and cut the gold on with a straight and sharp knife. The gold is taken off with a brush made of squirreFs hair, broad and flat: gilders use this to apply the gold to the paper. You must not work where there is any current of air, as the gold would be rumpled, and rendered of no use. Burnished Gold Paper requires another prepara- tion. Apply the size (see No. 588) very even with a pencil (it is common to give it two coats of size); let it dry, and pin it at the corners on a piece of board the size of your paper; have near you a glass of clean water, wet the paper with a hair pencil, to the size of a gold leaf, apply it directly, and con- tinue the same till you have gilt your sheet of paper. When perfectly dry, rub it with a piece of cotton, to take off the edges, or overplus gold; if any place has not taken, you must wet it, and apply another piece of gold; let it dry, and take it from the board to burnish it. For this purpose, have a square piece of polished marble, lay your paper on it, and with a burnishing tool, a square stone flint, or agate, about two inches wide, bur- nish it, by holding, in both your hands, the long handle, which should reach to your right shoulder, and rubbing it backwards and forwards upon the paper. S2276 ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. 588. Plate, or Size, for Burnished Fajoer. 3 draclims of Sanguine Stone, 1 ft), of Bol Ammoniac, 3 drachms of Black Lead, 3 drachms of Spermaceti. Grind each of these articles separately, and put them all into a new pipkin on a gentle fire, with a little water to melt, and mix them well; it should be of the thickness of pipe-clay, soft, without being too stiff; to keep it fit for use, it must stand covered with water. When you intend to use it, make a size with cuttings of parchment, which you must boil in water till it is all dissolved like isin- glass for jelly.—(See Clarification of Isinglass) When done, strain it through a sieve, let it cool, and it will be like a jelly. Moisten as much of the above mixture with it as you want, and lay it on the article you intend to burnish, as for gold paper. — (See No. 587.) 589. Columns, in Wood, Gilt, All articles, whether in gum paste, alabaster, plaster, or paper, are gilt by the same process : but those objects which are turned in wood, made of pasteboard, or of plaster, or are of a porous nature, require particular preparation. Take a wooden column, fix it with a pin or tack to a small bit of v^ood, by which you can hold it, and at the same time keep it straight; grind some whitening in your parchment size, and give the column three successive layers of it with a fine brush, taking care to dry each layer well; when perfectly dry, repair with a file the contour of your pillar, and rub it with a polishing paper, as if you meant to leave it w^hite; when finished give it a layer or two of your burnishing plate, or size; dry it, and apply your277 ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. gold^ as directed above. Barnish tlie pillar witli a crooked agate^ in the form of a hog^s tooth_, which you may buy of various sizes; you must not be^^in to burnish till the pillar is perfectly dry. The parts you wish to be dead, you must not touch with the burnisher; put over them, with a pencil, some of the parchment size^ very lightly. It is com- mon to use parchment or kid leather to make size, because isinglass is too dear, though oftener at hand than parchment. 590. Gilding in Oil. To gild in oil, see No. 573. This mode is quicker than burnishing, and is naturally brilliant; but it does not last like the burnished gold, having neither its splendour nor beauty; yet it is often used in caryatides, and for bas-reliefs in pastes. It has a good effect when mixed with other parts that are burnished. The colour of the gold may likewise be varied: the gold-beaters make some gold of a lemon colour, some darker, green, red, and white, according to the metals they put into the crucible. 591. Borders in Gold and Silver Taper, Borders are strips of paper cut with engraving tools (see No. 598), in different sizes, according to a drawing. Take your tool, commonly six inches in length, and place it on a block in which is a hollow to receive it, and a screw to tighten it at pleasure, and to fix it.— (See plate II. jig, 14.) You must also have a leaden mallet, and be pro- vided with some dozens of them, run in a mould made for that purpose, leaving a hole in the centreITALIAN CONFECTIONER. 278 to receive the handle^ which must be of beech^ and elastic^ made of part of a branch with the bark on it. Place the gold or silver paper on the tool^ the gilt side next to it, and strike it hard with the leaden hammer till it has entered the engraving, and is well cut out; take it off, and continue thus to the end of your border. These borders are used to ornament Assiettes Montees, fixing them on with gum.—(See Ornaments, No. 594.) 592. English Borders, English borders are made solid, that is, they are not pierced in any part, and in consequence cannot be turned round a medallion, or an oval; they are, however, very useful, and have a pleasing effect; they are preferable to the French borders, on account of the beauty of the gold, which is obtained by a mixture of parts of copper with the gold, a process not known to the French. They are made by the means of two little wheels [roulettes) held in the draw-bench; one of them (an engraved one) in steel, the other in brass, which takes the counter- impression by the pressure of the draw-bench, on being screwed tight, and the wheel turned. The first of these borders, brought to France by an Englishman, gave the author an idea of the machine with which they were made, and in eight days afterwards he made some borders, the only difference in which was the colour of the gold, which was much inferior to the EngHsh, for the reason just stated. Strips of paper must be cut to the breadth of the wheels; by putting one end of the paper to the wheel, and turning the handle, it draws it in, and279 ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. the paper takes the impression: this is done very quickly, so that you may make as many borders in a day as will serve for a year. 593. Of Foil in Copper and Pewter, Copper foil can only be fixed to pasteboard by first putting it on paper. Take some dissolved isinglass, spread it on the back of a sheet of foil, and apply a sheet of silver paper of the same size; when dry, you may afterwards stick it on anything you please. Pewter foil will easily stick on any- thing and with any paste. Foil may be coloured with a light size of isinglass, stained with any colour you please, either yellow, green, &c. (see Colours); but for this you must have a sheet of fine metal flattened and polished, or pewter beat out like gold and silver leaf, as on their brilliancy and polish depends their beauty when you colour them. To colour them, you must have your isinglass of a proper heat, and ready coloured, in a square dish; lay the foil gently on it, and afterwards suspend it to dry, by means of a crooked wire, on a piece of twine or cord tied across the room to receive it. 594. Of the construction of an Assiette Montee, Taste, and a knowledge of drawing, are requisite to form this article; a temple, for instance, must be made conformably to the rules of architecture, as a bad, heavy, massive structure would not answer the purpose; it should be light and elegant, calculated to display, to the best advantage, the bon-bons of various kinds that are strewed upon it. The author intended to have given drawings of several ornaments of this description, which he has280 ITALIAN CONFECTIONEK. designed and executed: but was deterred from giving more than one, by the great expense of engraving.— {See Flate 11. Ji^. 19.) Assiettes Monties may be made of pasteboard, or of wire-work^ or partly of both : you must have some wire of different sizes, according to the solidity of the article you intend to make; fasten one end to a book, and with a piece of wood to the other end, pull it tight, to straighten it. Cut it in lengths of about three feet, for use. Take some silver paper, cut it in strips of about a quarter of an inch wide, and cover the wire uniformly with them,, having some flour paste, and pasting the paper with it; twist it round the wire evenly, and rub a little paste over it to keep it fixed. When you have determined on the object you would make, take as many of these wires as you want, bind them together with binding-wire, which must be thin, and should have been heated, to make it more pliable, and then turn your main wires on pieces of wood, to form circles, garlands, wreaths, &c.: you must have a correct drawing to work from; the lengths must be cal- culated, and the wires kept as much as possible in one piece; experience will show you the necessity of being exact in your measures. When your frame- work is formed, tie the parts together with binding- wire ; by the help of a pair of pliers, twist it tight, conceal the ends, and cut them off: when the wire frame-work is thus put together, whiten it with whitening and size, if it is to be in silver paper or gum paste ; if to be gold, you must colour it yellow, and take care to put size to the colour. To fix the paper, whether mosaic or gilt paper, satin or gauze, dip your pencil in dissolved gum, and touch the part you mean to cover, taking care first to fold theITALIAN CONFECTIONER. 281 paper to the required shape; paste a small gold fillet over the joints to conceal them: you must be extremely neat and clean in this work^ as neither paste nor joints should be visible; it must look, when finished, as of a single piece, and as if it had just come from the silversmith^s or jeweller^s hands. 595. WorJcs in Pastehoard. Pasteboard work demands as much exactness as wire work. You must have a square board, larger than the sheet of pasteboard, an iron ruler as long as the board, perfectly true, and rather heavy; a square, proportioned to the ruler, and a tracer, a sort of double-edged knife, the blade of which is fixed to the centre of the handle, which is kept pointed like a pencil. Put your sheet of pasteboard on the training-board, square it by cutting off the edges, mark with the compass the lines where it is to be cut, lay the ruler on it, and cut it into strips according to measure. To use these strips, or bands, turn them round pieces of wood, to make them take the shape you wish; join the extremities with a slip of paper, or vellum, or you may, if you please, cut the strips longer, and with a sharp knife pare them thin at each end, and join them by wrapping one end over the other. Now cut out a piece of pasteboard to form the bottom or pedestal, fix it into the circle you have made, add mouldings and borders, according to your drawing, as in jplate II. Jig. 19 when put together, cover the projecting parts with extremely thin gilt paper; use stronger paper for the flat parts of the work, to receive the borders, bas-reliefs, and other ornaments. If you wish to use looking-glass, get some thin282 ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. German glass, cover it at the back with silver paper, by laying gum on the edges of the glass (not on the quicksilver, as it would come olf); a small quantity on the edges will be sufficient, as the gilt paper border will make it steady.—When the several parts of your work are finished, you must fix the whole together with binding wire very neatly, concealing the joints with small orna- ments, using as much dexterity and cleverness as possible. The difficulty of giving intelligible descriptions of minute operations of this nature is so obvious, that the reader, it is hoped, will make allowances, if the author has not succeeded in conveying his ideas so clearly as he could wish, not only upon this, but several similar occasions. 596. Faste made of Fastehoard or Faper, Sometimes it happens in decorating the table that you are in want of a vase, or cassolette, in paste- board. Take the impression from any mould you may have, or imitate a figure, trunk of a tree, &c. Pasteboard paste will be useful for this purpose, and the author recommends the following, which he has used with success in Paris for several years, to make a great variety of articles, both fanciful, and imita- tions of nature, such as are sold for new yearns gifts in every shop in that capital, and to contain bon- bons, &c. Take some paper shavings, very white, which you may buy at a bookbinder^s, and boil them in water till reduced to a paste ; let it cool, and when cold enough, press out the water with your hands, put it in a mortar, and pound it perfectly, then into a glazed pipkin, with a piece, about the size of your283 ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. thumbs of gum Senegal, dissolved in water very thick; put it on the fire, stir it well till it has taken the gum, and is thick; let it cool, make it of the consistence of gum paste with flour; mould your article with it, take it off and let it dry; if it is to be white, give it a coat of parchment size and whitening, mixed about the thickness of oil paint; paint and gild it as you think proper, in the same way as wood, taking care to clean and polish it first; if you wish to imitate black japan, take ivory black, and the varnish of gum-lac, with spirits of wine : give it ten coats of colour, and polish each coat, beginning with glass paper, and finishing with tripoli, reduced to an im- palpable powder. 597. Spun Glass. As the confectioner may not at all times be able to procure spun glass, the following method of making it may be found useful: put a quantity of wood ashes into a pan, and form a kind of flooring in it with large pieces of charcoal placed close to each other; raise on each side a sort of wall, distant about four inches, and cover the top like a vault with large charcoal placed across, so as to form some- what of a square oven, open at each end. Set fire to the charcoal, make it burn fiercely, letting it catch on all sides, and take a piece of glass, as the stopper of a decanter, the stem of a wine-glass, or any other broken glass, and put it in the middle of the fire ; your assistant must have a pair of tongs ready to catch it at the moment it begins to run, while you take hold of the other end with another pair of tongs, and draw the glass to you, twisting it as you draw it: you will thus have a twisted spun glass, round and even; the thickness depends284 ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. on the manner in which you draw it—if slowly, it will be thick; if quick^ it will be fine; you may likewise twist it in the flame of a candle ; fix it to your ornaments with isinglass. It may be made coloured with coloured glass. If you have a blow- pipe you may form tubes_, figures_, animals^ &c._, but this requires dexterity. Some use an oil drawn from the marrow of horses^ which gives sufiicient heat to blow bottles_, vases^ &c. SECTION XXX. ZSn^raving's on Iron and Steel. 598. To make Tools for Cutting Borders, Engraving on iron and steel is easier than en- graving on wood^ as most of the parts may be punched^ which, in wood, must be cut out. To make tools fit to cut out borders for gilt paper, you must forge a piece of iron_, about six inches in length, and one inch and a half in width, as thick as the breadth of the border you wish to make, because the engraving is to be made on its edge; when forged, smooth and polish it with a very fine file, tracing on it, with a steel graver, the lines by which you are to be guided in your work. Your punch must be made of a piece of steel, representing, in relicF, the section of the border, and must be engraved with gravers andriflers, of different forms and sizes; it must then be tempered, by putting the engraved end into a brazier with charcoal; when you see the opposite end, which is out of the fiiCj become of a goid^ or yellow colour^ withdraw285 ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. it, and dip it in water, urine, tallow, or grease;— the author uses water. Having thus obtained a single punch, you must now proceed to make another, which is to be double pointed, in order to repeat the engraving, and make the design correct. To make it, you must have a piece of untempered steel, fiat, like a die: take the single tool, tempered, and, with a hammer, strike it into the new piece of steel; strike on it two impressions close to each other, to form a double design, both being equally deep; then temper the square piece, and have ready an- other punch prepared of double the breadth of the design, not tempered (which of course is not so hard); place this upon the tempered die which contains the double design, and by striking re- peated small blows with the hammer, you will cause it to take the form and design, in relief, of the hollows to which it is applied; this double punch must be repaired with a fine file, like the first, and tempered in the same way; by this means you may make all sorts of small tools, some for indenting the borders, single or double; others to make leaves, the hearts of flowers, or any other ornament. The punches being made and tempered, place the tool which you have prepared and traced to be engraved, on a work-board of strong wood, fix it straight between two pieces of cast-iron, cast on purpose to receive difierent-sized irons; knock in, by repeated little blows of the hammer, the single graver, or punch, and follow it with the double one, that the design may be correct. Continue to strike it till well engraved ; polish it with a fine file; take off with chisels the straight lines of the286 ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. breadth of the drawings and polish the hollow with a rifler ; take off the surplus of iron from the sides with a file^ and that of the inside with a graver, so that your engraving may be sharp; try if it will cut the paper, you will then see if it wants cor- recting : if not well made, or the engraving be not deep enough, repair it accordingly. The most difficult thing is to make the punches, which must be of steel, well tempered, as they are apt to break in working : in this case you must have recourse to your die to make a new punch. The engraving tool, when finished, is used for cutting borders.— [See plate 11, fig, 14.) SECTION XXXI. ESngraving' on Wood. 599. Engraving on Wood. Engraving on wood is done with gouges, cutting chisels, &c. {^qq jplate 11, fig, 17), some of which are bent, some straight, some round, and others square. To learn to engrave on wood, you must previously model in clay or wax the object you intend to represent, and finish it completely. Prom this take an impression in plaster.—(See Moulding.) Keep this mould before you as a pattern, and with the larger tools take off the waste wood, then en- grave the parts which are to project. To explain this better, suppose you want a figure: first take off* the wood to give the attitude of the body, finish it naked, show the muscles and the distinctions of the sex; then engrave the shirt in all the parts ofITALIAN CONFECTIONER. 287 it wliich are to be seen^ the cravat, pantaloons, waistcoat, coat, buttons, &c. &c., all of which must be cut smooth and clean, and be polished, and finished. Time and patience will enable any one to excel in this art. The author has laboured for sixteen years, and has made himself particularly perfect in the figure; and he can assure his readers that they may succeed in the art of engraving on wood without the assistance of masters, by copying good models, and particularly by accustoming themselves to examine the reverse of objects, and the effect will then be apparent. The human figure, as well as animals, must be made in two pieces, the back and the front; to make the parts fit well, you must draw the outline on paper, and then prick this exactly on wood with a pin; turn the paper, and put the pin in the same holes to mark its counterpart. Some engravers fix the piece of wood to the table with an iron hold- fast, as carpenters do, and every time they want to turn the mould, they are obliged to take it off, which is very inconvenient, and occasions much loss of time: to remedy this defect, the author has constructed a wheel, which he has used with great success; it is pierced in the centre, and it turns on a spindle, fixed to the table the board to be en- graved is fixed in the middle to this wheel with four screws and nuts, according to the size of the wood, the wheel being full of small holes to receive different sizes.—{^qqplate \l,fig, 16.) You must have tools from the size of a needle to that used by carvers in wood: the wood fittest for engraving is pear-tree, or box, and it must be chosen very dry. The tools of an engraver are generally long, like those of a carpenter, and consequently must be held288 ITALIAN CONFECTIONER. in both hands^ which is probably the cause that engravings on wood are frequently coarse and harsh : to remedy this inconvenience, the author makes his tools about five inches in length, including the handle; he holds the tool in the hollow of the palm of his right hand, and engraves with the greatest ease, and very quickly—the thumb serves as a support and security, and the left hand turns the wheel when needful.INDEX.

He has avoided the use of harsh scientific terms, and has, in every case where it has been practicable, exchanged Greek and Latin words for simple English. An attempt has also been made to show how the nature of the lower animals is raised and modified, their reason developed, and their instinct brought under subjection, when they come in famihar contact with man—the highest of the animal creation."

The epitomiser has performed his task in a masterly style, exercising a sound judgment in giving prominence to the more interesting portions of his subject, bringing them out in full and bold relief on the map <'f the past, and describing them at greater length, while he has abridged less important matters, but without interruptiui^ the thread of the narrative. We have thus supplied what has long be n wanting to eveiy student of English literature—a thoroughly trustworthy handbook, in which the chief events of modern history are set forth in a clear, concise, and intel- ligent form."—Morning Herald.

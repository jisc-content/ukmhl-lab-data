In presenting to the public a New Edition of her Family Fare, the Authoress takes the opportunity of expressing her thanks for the liberal appreciation it has hitherto received, and she trusts that the new matter which she now adds will be a further aid to the inex- perienced housewife, and thus her efforts to be useful will have been a labour of love. It is needless to say that bills of fare cannot possibly be given to suit all persons, as what may be considered extravagant by one, may be deemed the reverse by an- other : therefore they must be considered and referred to as simply suggestive. The bills of fare for four persons have been served as small dinners of entertain- ment; those who may wish to use them as Family Fare can easily suit them to such by leaving out one or two of the dishes, and, if to be served to a larger number, by increasing the quantities of the dishes suggested. The receipts, also, are open to the same difference of opinion as the bills of fare; but it must be remem- bered, to make good dishes, good materials must bePREFACE TO THE NEW EDITION. X used. Wine and cream may often be omitted, but the same good result must not be expected. The receipts are written, and the quantities are given, to teach inexperienced cooks how to make and how to serve very good dishes. Those who may find them too good, or too costly, can remove the fault by giving out less of those articles that may seem to them to be extravagant. It will be observed that small quantities are given in many of the receipts for second dressing: they have, however, all been used by the Authoress ; therefore, the young housewife may with confidence give her orders so as to use up every ounce of fish, meat, or poultry, and the result will be a presentable and savouiy little dish. Before closing, the Authoress begs to say that she has been applied to for c an explanation ’ of the word c gill.’ She therefore thinks it well to say here that by a ‘ gill ’ she means a quarter of a pint.

If you know better precepts than these, candidly tell me; if not, follow them as I do. Hobace. Amid the numerous books, to which the names of well- known professors of the culinary art are attached, it may appear in some degree presumptuous in one unknown, to present to the Public her ‘ Cre-fydd’s Family Fare.’ The Authoress would not have been thus daring had she not ascertained by her own experience, as well as that of many friends, that whatever the other merits of previous works on the subjects of cookery and household manage- ment, they are not practically available for the moderate and economical, yet reasonably luxurious, housekeeper, or for those who are young or who are inexperienced in those matters. In those works there is no lack of receipts, maxims, and * directions to the cook; ’ but in general, when tested by a moderate cook, or directed by an inexperienced person, failure and disappointment are the result. Let any young housewife in moderate circumstances (and we cannot all afford to invoke the shade of Ude, or have Francatelli at our elbow) answer whether, when she has put the newly-purchased cookery-book into the hands of her cook, she has not been ultimately disappointed. Not from excessive fastidiousness on her part, or from the want of goodwill in the cook, but because, in the majority ofXU TEEFACE. instances, the receipts and directions are only suited to those cooks who are well informed, and have had considerable practice (see note, p. xiii,). They are often the result of theo- retical ingenuity, or the productions of those who know, hut who cannot impart their knowledge to the uninformed. Theory and practice must be combined; and that com- bination put forth in such language, that while the lady will not object to read, the cook will be able to understand. The Authoress of the present work has, from various motives, sought opportunities, and from peculiar circum- stances found them, of acquiring the receipts it contains. They are not all new to the Public, though many of them are, but they have all this recommendation — that they have been tested, and served on the table of the Authoress, under her direct supervision. Those dishes have past the ordeal of fastidious and almost morbidly critical palates, and have come forth with ap- proval. The materials suggested are reasonably econo- mical, the quantities exact, and the directions plain. The words ‘reasonably economical’ are used advisedly, as it would be insulting to the understanding of sensible persons to state that inferior materials can be formed into superior dishes. In addition to the receipts on cookery, the Authoress has introduced a variety of other receipts and suggestions for the management of a house and ser- vants. With regard to servants, it may be observed that many of them would be much better for the gentle but firm directions of a kind mistress Experienced and skilful servants need no direction; but such are not always to be found; and when found, the rate of wages required by them would not be suitable to persons with a moderate income. A mistress, under such circumstances, if she would havePREFACE. XUl a comfortable establishment, must be able, in some degree, to instruct her servants; without this, it is impossible that they, who have but little experience, can know the wants incident to a respectable family. The necessity of doing what she advises, has been forced on the Authoress during a long life of much experience. In order to moderate, in some degree, the difficulty of managing a household, these suggestions are made. If the Authoress has aided the young housewife, and smoothed the way in the difficulties of housekeeping, and in that essential to health and comfort, good cooking, her object has been attained. It will be observed that the quantity of every ingredient used is carefully given, as well as the exact time required in cooking. Each receipt is perfect in itself, for it is found that reference to other receipts is, to the inexperienced, extremely perplexing. French terms are avoided. It is right to add that the whole of the receipts have been successfully used, with the simple aid of an ordinary range, and the usual appliances found in the kitchen of a small establishment. NOTE. The following extracts from modern and much-praised cookery-books, in our own language, as well as French, Italian, and German, will fully justify the remark in the text:— ‘ LAMB CUTLETS A LA PRINCESSE. ‘ Trim and fry the cutlets in the usual manner ; and when be- come partially cold, dip each cutlet up to the bone in some stiffly-PIIEFACE. XIV reduced Allemande sauce, strongly flavoured with mushrooms; each cutlet as it is dipped to be afterwards placed flat on a baking- sheet upon rough ice, to set the same quite firm on the cutlets; they are then to be egged, crumbed, fried in hot lard, and, being dished up, are to be garnished with a puree of green asparagus, or asparagus peas, and some supreme or any other wrhite sauce poured round the base.’—Francatelli’s Cook's Guide. ‘ SHOULDERS OF VEAL, STUFFED. ‘ Take the joint and lay it with the skin side downwards ; with a sharp thin knife carefully detach the meat from the bladebone; then hold the shoulder edgewise, and detach the meat from the other side of the bone, being careful not to make a hole in the skin; then cut the bone from the knuckle and take it out. You may at first be rather awkward about it, but after once or twice trying it will become easy; you may also take out the other bone, but I prefer it in, as it keeps the shape better; then lard the lean part like the neck (in No. 320) ; mix some salt and a little mixed spice together, with which rub the meat from whence the bone has been cut, stuff with veal stuffing, or sausage-meat, or suet pudding ; braise, garnish, and serve (as No. 303). This being the toughest part of the veal, it should be tried before taking up, to see if it is properly done, by thrusting a larding needle in it. If it goes in easily, it is done. This joint is excel- lent cold, and should be carved in thin slices crosswise.’—Soyer’s Modem Housewife. ‘ POULETS. 1 Set the fowls for one horn- in cold water, then they are to be plain boiled. For the sauce, use a pint and a half of bechamelle and a teaspoonful of white sauce ; reduce it to a pint; put into it equal quantities of mushrooms and truffles, and pieces of quenelle the size of a nut; leave it in the bain-marie to keep warm, and remain till wanted. Serve the sauce in a tureen, to be put on each plate by the carver.’—The Lady's Guide. ‘HARICOT mutton. ‘ This dish is nothing more than mutton chops browned in the frying pan, and then stewed in just enough water to cover them,XV PJREFACE. with pieces of onion, carrot and turnip (also browned), cut into dice, and placed upon them, flavoured with mushroom or walnut catsup, tomato or Eeading sauce, and served with a slice or two of pickled gherkin.’—The Dinner Question. ‘BEEF PALATES. ‘ Simmer them in water several hours, till they will peel; then cut the palates into slices, or leave them whole, as you choose, and stew them in a rich gravy till as tender as possible. Before you serve, season them with cayenne, salt, and ketchup. If the gravy was drawn clear, add also some butter and flour. If to be served white, boil them in milk, and stew them in a fricassee sauce, adding cream, butter, flour, and mushroom-powder, and a little pounded mace.’—Mrs. Rundefl’s Domestic Cookery. ‘TETE DE VEAU EN TOKTUE. ‘ Apres avoir fait blanchir et bouillir la tete de veau, vous la desossez entierement et la coupez en morceaux. Yous dentelez l'oreille pour mettre en haut et couronner votre plat, et vous la faites cuire comme pour manger au naturel, avec neaumoins un peu de vin blanc. Pendant qu’elle cuit, vous disposez votre ragout. Yous faites un roux que vous mouillez de bouillon. Vous y ajoutez des cretes de coq,rognons, champignons, quenelles, ris de veau, foies de volailles, bouquet de persil, beurre, sel, piment, vin de Madere, avec jaunes d’oeufs durcis, la langue et la cervelle. Les morceaux de la tete etant bien egouttes, vous les dressez en pyramide, vous versez votre sauce et vos garnitures dessus, et vous gamissez votre plat d’ecrevisse et de croutons frits.’—La Bonne et Parfaite Cuisiniere. ‘ INSALATA 1)1 V1TELLO CON SALSA TAltTAKA.

They are, however, so arranged, that by a proportionate addition of quantity, they will serve for four or six persons; and those who may consider them too much for two, will have a choice of dishes to select from. If the bills of fare be followed in succession, it will be seen that everything is disposed of, as nearly as can be, without being acquainted with the appetites and habits of the consumers. The puddings may be found too large, but they can easily be reduced, as the exact quantities are given in each receipt. The price of fish varies considerably, consequently it should be chosen according to the market of the day. The fish for family fare should not exceed the prices in the subjoined list. Those prices, and all others, as well as the calculation of house- keeping expenses (see Hints to Mistresses), will only be a guide to residents in London or the suburbs, and even there they will vary in different districts. It must be remarked that the bills of Family Fare are made out for the present year, 1864 ; the Sundays and Movable Fasts and Feasts are marked, consequently they may be regulated to serve for any year.

[Served by Ring & Brymer, 15 Cornhill, London, to the Worshipful Company of Armourers and Brasiers, March 1864.]REMARKS AND DIRECTIONS TO BE REMEMBERED. In writing receipts, it is impossible to give in each, every detail; it must therefore be understood that ‘ a spoonful,’ whether table, dessert, tea, or saltspoon, be used, means a spoon of the ordinary size for kitchen use, filled, but not piled. The same observation applies to cups and glasses. When carrots, turnips, celery, onions, mushrooms, potatoes, lemons, &c., are ordered without specification, the medium size must be understood; ‘ pepper,’ either kind ; ‘ mustard,’ made or an-made ; ‘ dry flour,’ dried, but not baked; ‘ dried crumbs,’ bread prepared as directed; ‘ water.’ cold. If these remarks be remembered, no difficulty can arise, as in all cases where detail is necessary, it is given in the receipt. Kitchen Utensils.—Extreme cleanliness is indispensable to good cooking. Pots, stewpans, saucepans, fryingpans, and every other utensil, must be kept bright inside. Each time they are used, they should be well washed with hot water, scoured with silver sand and a wisp of hay (which should always be at hand), rinsed and dried before putting them away. Soda should not be used, as it soon destroys the tinning of the vessels. Pudding-cloths, jelly-bags, and sieves should be washed several times in very hot water, without soap or soda, and dried in the open air. Paste- slabs, rolling-pin, moulds, earthen pans, and the lids, tables, &c., must be kept scrupulously clean. The Oven.—The oven requires attention both in cleansing and heating, or it will not work satisfactorily. It should be swept and well rubbed with a wet cloth every morning. More or less fire must be applied to obtain the degree of heat required, which may be ascertained by putting in a piece of stale crumb of bread.REMARKS AND DIRECTIONS TO BE REMEMBERED. civil and shutting the door for ten minutes. If the heat be great, it •will be baked brown ; if moderate, slightly browned; and if gentle, yellow. Fire for Roasting.—The ashes should be well cleared out before making up the fire for roasting. Poultry, game, or joints under twelve pounds weight, require a fire nineteen inches wide and fifteen inches high. It should be burnt through, and the screen and dripping-pan placed before it, to get hot, before the joint is put down to roast. Roasting.—The joint should be hung close to the fire {four inches from the bars'), for the first quarter of an hour, unless otherwise directed in the receipts, and then drawn to a distance (twelve inches from the bars) till done. This process sets the juice in the meat, and much improves the flavour. Boiling.—Great care is required in boiling. Except where otherwise directed, the joint should be put into sufficient cold water to cover it, boiled up quickly, then simmered till done ; that is to say, the water must be kept at boiling heat, but must not be permitted to bubble, or to wave perceptibly. This process causes the meat to swell, renders it tender and juicy ; while boiling will cause the meat to shrink from the bone, and render it hard and dry. Braising.—This word means to cook meat, poultry, &c. by the appliance of very gentle heat, and with little or no liquid. The process is much longer than ordinary stewing, or than boiling, consequently simmering must be attended to. Steaming.—An ordinary steamer may be used in all cases where steaming is ordered ; the saucepan under it must be full of water, and boil fast all the time ; or for puddings a pint pie- dish may be turned upside down in a saucepan with three pints of boiling water in it, and the pudding placed upon that. Plates and Dishes should be washed in plenty of hot water (without soda), rinsed in cold water, then drained till dry. "\V hen sent to table, they should be hot, but not so much so as to be disagreeable. The bottom of the dishes should be care- fully wiped. Serving.—Whether about to serve immediately, or if the dinnerClviii REMARKS AND DIRECTIONS TO BE REMEMBERED. be unavoidably delayed, everything should be taken up at the moment it is done. Boiled fish, poultry, or joints should be covered with a hot cloth, and kept over the steam, but not over the fire. Three minutes before sending to table put them into the water and boil up. Lay roast poultry or joints in the dripping-pan, and protect them from the fire by a dish ; put them into a hot oven, or rehang before the fire, for five or ten minutes before serving. Fish may be re-fried. Potatoes may be mashed and browned, and other vegetables may be thrown into fast-boiling water for three or four minutes; thus a dinner need never be spoiled by a little delay. The dinner should be sent to table covered by hot covers, which should be scrupulously clean and highly polished inside and out. Pastry and puddings are better not covered, as the steam makes them heavy and spoils their appearance. Second Dressing.—The various dishes arranged from cold fish, meat, poultry and game come under this denomination. Clearing Soup.—Fast boiling, uncovered, is the best way of clearing soup, but it sometimes fails; in this case, throw in the whites of three or four fresh eggs, and whisk it briskly for ten minutes while boiling fast; then take it off the fire, let it settle for ten minutes. Strain carefully. Sieves and Jelly bags.—Hair or tammy sieves and jelly bags must be put into very hot water for five minutes, then dipped into cold water before using. The bags must be wrung out as hot as possible; attending to this will render the straining process more effectual. Moulds.—Moulds must be dipped into cold water before putting either jelly or cream into them ; and when about to turn out the contents, they must be quickly dipped into hot water and wiped dry. Baked Flour.—Put one pound of fine flour into a soup plate, and bake in a cool oven till it is quite day, but not coloured; when cold, pound it and put it into a glass jar; tie it over with paper, and keep for use, as directed in the receipts. Bake another pound in a quick oven till of a pale brown colour. When cold, pound it; put it into a jar, and use when directed. Baked flourREMARKS AND DIRECTIONS TO BE REMEMBERED. clix is an essential to good cooking, and the cook should never be without it. Dried or prepared Crumbs.—Put some bread on a sheet of paper, place it in a cool oven, and let it remain till perfectly dried through. Divide the crust and brown part from the crumb, and pound them separately till in very fine powder. Put them into jars, and keep them in a dry place. The white crumbs are to be used for sweetbreads, cutlets, fried fish, puddings, &c. The brown crumbs are to be used for hams, bacon, colouring broth, &c. Any pieces of bread there may be, should be baked daily, as the bread should not be stale, and pounded twice or thrice a week. Burnt Sugar, for colouring Soups, fyc.—Put a quarter of a pound of sifted loaf sugar into a small iron saucepan (untinned), and place it over the fire to bake, till it becomes black, but not crisp, like a cinder; add a pint of water, and simmer till the sugar dissolves, and the water is reduced to half a pint. Strain through a cloth, and when cold, bottle and keep for use. Great care is required in colouring, not to put too much, or it will spoil what it is intended to improve, both in appearance and flavour. It must be used by drops till the desired effect is attained. Black Onions, for Soups, fyc.—Peel six large onions, and place them on a tin dish. Knead together a quarter of a pound of salt butter and a quarter of a pound of moist sugar ; divide it into six equal parts, and place one on each onion. Put them into a slow oven, and bake till they are black through, but not burnt crisp. Baste them frequently with the liquor. When done, put them into a pie-dish, and keep for use. These onions give a finer colour to soup and gravy than anything else; they also impart a good flavour. Weights and Measures.—As the same weights and measures are not used everywhere, it is necessary to state that those re- ierred to in this book are avoirdupois, i. e. sixteen ounces to the pound, and imperial, i.e. twenty liquid ounces to the pint. Sieves vary even in London, therefore by a sieve must be under- stood fourteen dry quarts. Seasoning.—The over use of seasoning will spoil every otherclx REMARKS AND DIRECTIONS TO RE REMEMBERED. flavour, while the moderate use brings it out and improves the dish. Great care has been taken in stating the quantities to be Used, and they should be strictly adhered to. Many persons object to all condiments, while others like them profusely em- ployed. This can only be ascertained by the cook at first follow- ing the receipts, and then, if alteration be necessary, decrease or increase the quantities to suit the palates she cooks for. The nutmegs referred to in the different receipts must not weigh more than the sixth of an ounce, or if they be larger, less in proportion must be used. By a grain is meant the sixtieth part of a drachm; and of most things a cayenne-spoonful will be equal to a grain. A drachm is the eighth part of an ounce ; and of many things a teaspoonful is equal to a drachm. Garlic.—Garlic must be used very carefully, or it will spoil what it is intended to improve. Strict attention, therefore, must be paid to the directions contained in each receipt when this vegetable is used. Condiment Sauces.—Ketchup and other condiment sauces must be used in moderation. Ore-fydd’s* casureep will be found to be a convenient sauce, as no other condiment nor wine need be added when it is used. It imparts an agreeable flavour to all brown soups and made dishes. * See Notice following Index.BILLS OF FARE FOR FOUR PERSONS. January, February, and March. Palestine soup, boiled brill.

Put a young fowl, half a pound of Carolina rice well washed and picked, and the white heart of a lettuce into five pints of stock (No. 2), boil up slowly, and stir up the rice from the bottom, then simmer for eighteen minutes. Take out the fowl, cut off all the white meat, and put back the bones, skin and trimmings into the pot, together with a dessertspoonful of loaf sugar and a teaspoonful of salt. Simmer for an hour and a half, then rub the soup through a fine tammy sieve. Pound the following ingredients; the meat of the fowl, an ounce of cooked veal suet, two ounces of cooked tongue, an ounce of fine crumbs of bread, a teaspoonful of finely chopped chervil or parsley, the grated rind of half a lemon, half a saltspoonful of salt, the same of white pepper, and of loaf sugar. Add two fresh eggs, beaten with a tablespoonful of thick cream. Mix the whole into a paste and form it into small balls. Put the soup into a stewpan, rubbed twice across the bottom with cut garlic, throw in the balls, simmer for half an hour, then serve. COVENTRY SOUP. Pound to a paste the following ingredients: half a pint of picked shrimps, very fresh, the yolks of three hard-boiled fresh eggs, two tablespoonfuls of cream or butter dissolved, a table- spoonful of fine crumbs of bread, a grain of cayenne, half a salt- spoonful of white pepper, and two well-beaten fresh eggs. Lay the paste flat on a slab to dry, about two hours, then cut it into square dice-like pieces. Put two quarts of stock (No. 2) into a stewpan, with a small fresh lobster chopped fine and the shell, a teaspoonful of salt and a grain of cayenne. Bruise a teaspoonful of unboiled spawn, and stir in. Take out the shell and rub the soup through a fine tammy. Put it into the stewpan again, throw in the shrimp paste, simmer a quarter of an hour. Stir in, carefully, half a pint of good cream, and serve immediately. The soup should be a pinky white colour, and of the consistency of thin cream.clxxi SOUPS. ITALIAN SOUP. Put two quarts, or the quantity required, of stock (No. 1) into a stewpan, add a teaspoonful of salt, and boil up quickly till it be- comes quite bright. Put a dessertspoonful of tarragon wine, or more, if the flavour be liked, with half a wineglassful of sherry or any good white wine into the tureen, pour in the soup, then add poached new-laid eggs, neatly trimmed. The number to suit the number of guests. Care is required not to break the eggs either in placing them in the soup or in serving it. This soup is greatly esteemed by many persons, particularly by those who have travelled much on the Continent. It makes a change, at all events, from the usual “ clear gravy.” calf’s TAIL SOUP. Have two tails, cut them into pieces about an inch long, put them into a stewpan with two quarts, and half a pint of stock (No. 2), boil up slowly, and simmer gently for an hour and a half; skim off all the fat. Take out the pieces of tail, put them into a basin, cover it over and place it in the oven to keep hot. Thicken the soup as follows : beat the yolks of three fresh eggs, and stir in, add a teaspoonful of salt, the strained juice of half a lemon, a small wineglassful of Madeira or good sherry, and a quarter of a pint of good fresh cream; put the pieces of tail into the tureen, pour the soup over, and send it to table at once. SUMMER SOUP. Peel, clean out the seeds, and cut up three moderate-sized vegetable marrows. Well wash and cut up one large endive. Put these into a stewpan with four young onions, a sprig of chervil, a slice of crumb of bread a quarter of an inch thick, and three pints of any kind of white stock, or the milk in which poultry has been boiled, boil slowly for an hour and a half, add two teaspoonfuls of salt, one teaspoonful of loaf sugar, and a grain of cayenne. Rub the whole through a line tammy sieve. Add the strained juice of a small lemon, and serve at once. A gill of cream is a great improvement, added after the lemon juice.clxxii fish. FISH. SOLES, COD OK HADDOCK, WITH MUSHROOMS AXD OYSTERS OR MUSCLES. Wash the fish, then rub it with lemon juice and a saltspoonfui of salt, and let it stand for an hour. Rirb a slice of bread to fine crumbs, season them with a saltspoonfui of white pepper, a tea- spoonful of chopped parsley, a small shalot chopped, and the grated peel of half a lemon. Peel and wash a dozen medium- sized mushrooms, take off the beards of a dozen large oysters, dissolve an ounce of butter into a cream, wipe the fish dry, dip it into the butter, and then into the crumbs on both sides. Rub a tin dish over with butter, lay in half of the oysters and half of the mushrooms alternately, place the fish on them, and the re- mainder on the fish. Add two tablespoonfuls of the oyster liquor and one tablespoonful of white wine. Put an ounce of butter in small pieces over the top, and bake in a quick oven from twenty-five to thirty minutes, according to the weight of the fish. The receipt is given for one sole, a slice of cod, or a had- dock, either not more than enough for four persons. SLICES OP COD WITH CREAM SAUCE. Slices of crimped cod. Put each slice into a sheet of well but- tered foolscap paper, and fold over the edges, place them in a tin dish, and bake in a moderately heated oven for twenty-five or thirty minutes. Place them on a hot dish and pour the following sauce over them. CREAM SAUCE. Boil half a pint of milk with half an inch of mace and half a bay leaf, beat the yolks of two fresh eggs, and add to the milk while hot but not boiling, stir over the fire till it is as thick as cream,clxxiii ■WHITEBAIT. TROUT. then strain into a basin. Add three tablespoonfuls of thick double cream, stirred in quickly. Serve it over the fish. Note.—Small fresh mushrooms added to the sauce is a great improve- ment. In which case, trim them, and fry them in butter for five minutes. WHITEBAIT, PLAIN AND DEVILLED. "Wash the whitebait in very cold water, drain it, and dab it with a clean cloth while on the sieve. Turn it out on another dry cloth and dredge it thickly with baked Hour ; shake the cloth so as to make the flour adhere to the whitebait. Have a bright stewpan half full of boiling lard, put the whitebait into a flying- net that fits the pan, dip it quickly into the lard, let it be in one minute, take it out and shake it well, so as to prevent them sticking together ; dip it again for one or two minutes ; let the lard drain off; then serve piled on a hot dish. To devil them, shake cayenne from a caster over the whitebait before dipping them the second time. They should be of a drab colour and crisp. Cut lemon, cayenne, and brown bread and butter must be served. BAKED OR BROILED TROUT. Wash the fish, wipe it quite dry, and dredge it over with baked flour. Dissolve some butter to a creamy substance; an ounce for each fish weighing eight or nine ounces; dip in the fish, and let it stand ten minutes; then dredge it again with the flour, and dip it a second time into the butter. Place it upon a tin dish, and bake in a quick oven for twenty minutes; longer if the fish be larger. Or put it into a folding gridiron, and broil either before or over a bright fire about the same time. Lay it on a hot dish, without napkin or paper, and strew it over with finely-chopped parsley or chervil. Serve with dissolved butter, boiled ..and skimmed till quite bright, in a tureen; or with the following sauce :—Peel a cucumber, cut it into slices, sprinkle it over with a teaspoonful of salt, and let it remain two hours, put it on a sieve, pour cold water over it, and let it drain, chop it fine, together with two spring onions, add a dessertspoonful of Lucca oil, and the same of tarragon vinegar, stir it well, and place it round the fish. This sauce is very good served with fillets of sole, either plain or with sweet herbs.clxxiv FISH. FILLETS OF TURBOT FRIED IN BATTER. (Second dressing.) Make a batter with one egg, a tablespoonful of baked flour, and a quarter of a pint of milk; beat it till quite smooth ; cut up cold turbot into neat fillets, three inches long and one and a-half broad. Dip each fillet into the batter, and fry to a pale brown colour in boiling lard. Brill, cod, plaice, or sole may be re-dressed in this way. CUCUMBER SAUCE FOR SALMON, EELS, ETC. (To be served cold.) Peel a fresh cucumber, cut it into slices as thick as a penny piece, sprinkle over it a saltspoonful of salt, and let it stand an hour; then wash off the salt, chop it into small pieces, and pour over it the strained juice of a lemon. Boil half a pint of new milk, and add it to the beaten yolks of two fresh eggs; boil, and stir till like cream. Then strain it into a basin, add two table- spoonfuls of thick cream; put in the cucumber, stir rapidly, then let it stand in a cold place, or on ice. MISCELLANEOUS RECEIPTS. sheep's kidneys stewed in PORT WINE. Trim off the pith and skin of eight fresh kidneys; cut each into four pieces. Season them with half a saltspoonful of white pep- per, a grain of cayenne, half a saltspoonful of salt, a saltspoon- ful of finely-chopped parsley, a saltspoonful of finely-chopped shalot, and a tablespoonful of baked flour. Put three ounces of butter into a small stewpan, and when beginning to dissolve, put in the kidneys ; shake the pan over a moderate heat till they are slightly browned ; then add two tablespoonfuls of stock No. 1, a teaspoonful of red currant jelly, and a claretglassful of Port wine; put on the lid, and do not remove it again, shake the pan and let it simmer very gently for twenty minutes. Turn them on to a very hot dish, and serve at once.clxxv •MISCELLANEOUS RECEIPTS. VEAL CUTLETS WITH MUSHROOMS OR TRUFFLES. A pound and a half of veal cutlets, about the third of an inch thick. Cut them into neatly-shaped pieces, all the same size, and trim off the skin. Season with a teaspoonful of salt, a saltspoon- ful of white pepper, and a dessertspoonful of baked flour. Trim off the skin of twelve medium sized mushrooms; wash, and wipe them. Rub the bottom of a pie dish once across with cut garlic, and then well butter it. Lay in the veal and mushrooms alter- nately, and on the top place, in small pieces, about two ounces of butter. Cover with another dish, and bake in a slow oven for an hour and a-half. If truffles be used (six or eight), cut them into slices, and put them in layers instead of mushrooms. Serve on a hot dish with cut lemon on a plate. This dish is very little trouble to arrange, and is quite suited as an entree at a dinner of entertainment. MUTTON HASHED VENISON FASHION. Cut slices of cold mutton the third of an inch thick, trim off the skin and browned fat. Season with a small saltspoonful of salt, half a saltspoonful of white pepper, and a dessertspoonful of baked flour. Have rather more than a quarter of a pint of strong strained gravy, made with the bones and trimmings of the mutton, one kidney cut up, a shalot, half of a small carrot, and two ounces of sheep’s liver. Put the mutton and the gravy into a small bright stewpan, shake it well, and place it over a slow fire, and let it scarcely simmer for an hour and a half. Stir in a table- spoonful of red currant jelly ; add half of a small wine glassful of good Port wine, and serve immediately, with a dish of French beans. The receipt is given for three quarters of a pound of mutton. This dish has been much praised, and can scarcely be distin- guished from venison. PULLED TURKEY OR FOWL. (Second dressing.) Pull the meat off the bones in strips, by using two forks ; make a gravy with the bones and half an onion, half a turnip, and a small head of celery fried in an ounce of butter till browned.clxxvi MISCELLANEOUS RECEIPTS. Season the meat (half a pound) with a saltspoonful of salt, half a salt- spoonful of white pepper, half a grain of powdered mace, and a table- spoonful of baked flour. Put two ounces of butter into a bright stewpan, rub the bottom across once ■with cut garlic; put in the meat, and shake the pan till the butter is all absorbed, then add enough of the gravy (strained) to well moisten, simmer for ten minutes, stir in a tablespoonful of sherry, and serve either with fried sippets or a maccaroni wall. If a white dish be preferred, stew the bones and vegetables (fried but not browned), in milk, and substitute two tablespoonfuls of cream for the sherry, and garnish with slices of lemon. * SCOLLOPS OF MEAT, POULTRY, OR GAME A BREAKFAST PISH. Mince up as fine as possible any kind of cold, unsalted meat, or a mixture of meats, poultry, or game. Season, half a pound, with a saltspoonful of fine salt, a grain of cayenne, and a salt- spoonful of pepper. Make the meat quite moist with any kind of gravy, that of roast meat being the best. Rub a slice of bread to fine crumbs, season them with half a saltspoonful of salt, and a quarter of a saltspoonful of pepper. Rub the bottom of a tin scol- lop or a tin dish with butter, lay evenly over it a third of the crumbs, then put in the meat, and the remainder of the crumbs over that. Press it even ; place on the top, in small pieces, about an ounce of butter. Bake it in a moderately-heated oven or before the fire for twenty-five minutes. Place the scollop, or tin dish, on a napkin, and send it to table at once. ICED PUDDING. Have in readiness the following candied preserved fruits and other ingredients:—Two apricots, three greengages, two ounces of cherries, half an ounce of angelica, two ounces of mixed peel, two tablespoonfuls of cura^&o or French brandy, three-quarters of an ounce of the best isinglass, half a pint of new milk, two table- spoonfuls of powdered loaf sugar, and a pint of fresh double cream. Cut up the fruit into small pieces, put it into a basin, and pour the spirit over it. Dissolve the isinglass and the sugar by boiling them in the milk for three or four minutes, stirringSWEETS. clxxvi i all the time, strain it into a basin, add the cream by degrees, and stir it till it begins to thicken, then put in the fruit, and stir till it is well mixed with the cream. Put the mixture into a round mould, and when quite set, place it in rough ice, and let it remain two hours or longer. Turn it into a glass dish, and send to table at once. MERINGUES WITH CREAM. Beat the whites of six fresh eggs with a whisk till in a stiff froth, then add by degrees six ounces of finely-powdered loaf sugar. When the mixture is firm, take it out with a small table- spoon (as much as possible in the form of an egg), place these on a sheet of foolscap paper at a little distance from each other, put that on a baking board, or a sheet of thick card-board, put them into a moderately-heated oven, and bake to a pale yellow brown colour, about a quarter of an hour. Take them out and very carefully scoop out the fiat side; put them again into the oven for a few minutes to dry the inside. Then place them on a sieve till wanted. They should be made a day before required. Fill them with (the quantities given will make nine meringues) cream, or apple whip, as directed in the two following receipts; put the flat sides together and send them to table. WHIPPED CREAM. Beat half a pint of fresh double cream with a whisk, add a dessertspoonful of very finely powdered loaf sugar, and twenty drops of essence of vanilla or any other flavouring ; when firm, it is ready for use; but much improved by being on ice for an hour or two. APPLE WHIP. Bake, in a moderately heated oven, six large cooking apples, till they are soft but not discoloured. Remove the skin and the core ; add the same weight of finely powdered loaf sugar as there is of apple pulp; and to every half pound add the whites of two very fresh eggs, and the strained juice of a small lemon. Beat the " hole together with a whisk till in a light white froth resembling snow. 1MISCELLANEOUS RECEIPTS. elxxviii SNOW BALLS WITH CUSTARD. Divide the yolks from the whites of four fresh eggs. Beat the whites with a whisk till in a firm froth, add two teaspoonfuls of very finely powdered loaf sugar. Put rather more than half a pint of new* milk into a bright stewpan, add twenty drops of orange flower water, or any other flavouring, and two dessert- spoonfuls of powdered loaf sugar; put it over a gentle heat, and when boiling, place in the sfiow in balls formed by the bowl of a tablespoon, simmer for four minutes, drain the snowballs on a fine sieve, in a cold place. Make a custard as follows: beat the yolks of the eggs, add them to the milk and stir it over a slow fire till it becomes as thick as good cream; strain it, and let it get quite cold. Place the snowballs in a glass dish, pour the custard over and send it to table. The quantities given 'will make enough to serve to four persons. The following Puddings may be eaten hot or cold (iced), and with or without the appropriate sauce. Cabinet, pine apple, Clarence, brandy, bread, a pudding for a Prince, Conservative, moggina, ratafia, ginger and bread, tapioca (steamed), and semolina (steamed). Let the pudding get quite cold; then place it (in the basin or mould in which it was cooked) in a pan of ice ; let it remain for two hours or more. If the sauce be served it must be iced also, and placed round the pudding shaped by a dessert spoon. These puddings, thus served, have been much appreciated, and they make a nice change from the ordinary “ iced pudding.” BEDFORD PUDDING. Two ounces of mixed candied peel chopped, two ounces cl raisins stoned and chopped, two ounces of currants washed and rubbed dry, a tablespoonful of honey, three fresh eggs, and half a pint of new milk. Beat the eggs well, boil the milk, take it off the fire and stir in the honey ; then add it to the eggs, beat for ten minutes, and let it stand till cold. Moisten a quarter of a pound of dried flour with cold water, knead it to a firm paste, lay it fiat on the board and spread over it a quarter of a pound of goodPOTATO FLOOR SOUFFI.fl. STEWED FRESII FRUIT, clxxix butter. Roll it out (always one way) till the butter is well mixed into the paste. Rub a twelve-inch tin dish with butter, lay in the paste, trim round the edge. Stir the fruit into the custard, pour it into the paste, place it immediately in a well- heated oven, and bake for three quarters of an hour. Turn it off the dish on to a napkin and serve. POTATO FLOUR SOUFFL'E.* Three ounces of potato flour, three-quarters of a pint of new milk, three ounces of fresh butter, a' quarter of a pound of pow- dered loaf sugar, and six fresh eggs. Moisten the flour with a little cold milk, then stir in the remainder of the milk boiling hot, add the butter and the sugar, and stir the mixture over the fire for ten minutes. Turn it into a basin and let it get cold. Beat the yolks of the eggs with a dessertspoonful of orange flower water, add them to the mixture, whisk the whites to' a stiff froth and add them, beat with a whisk for ten minutes. Rub a plain tin mould with butter, put in the mixture, and bake in a quick oven twenty minutes, roll a hot napkin round the tin, place it on a dish, and serve immediately. STEWED FRESII FRUIT. Gooseberries.—A quart of fine green gooseberries all about the same size; pick off the stems, wash and wipe the fruit; put it into a brass skillet, with three-quarters of a pound of powdered loaf sugar ; moisten the sugar ivith a tablespoonful of cold water. Place the skillet over a slow heat and simmer till the fruit is tender but not broken. Greengages.—Wipe the fruit, split it, and take out the stones; crack half the stones and take out the kernels, and throw them into hot water ; remove the skin. Put the fruit and the kernels into the skillet, and for every quart add half a pound of loaf sugar; simmer gently till tender. If the fruit be unripe, add a quarter of a pound more sugar. Apncots are done exactly as greengages. Orleans and other plums—The stones may be left in, and the skins be carefully taken off the fruit. The quantity of sugar as for greengages. ^ * Potato flour is easily made (see receipt in Meals for the Million, by * <re-fydd), and is very useful for invalids and children, 1 2clxxx MISCELLANEOUS RECEIPTS.

If for soup, the pieces must be square like dice, and must be fried in butter.clxxxii MISCELLANEOUS RECEIPTS. PRESERVED GREENGAGES AND APRICOTS FOR TARTS, EQUAL IN FLAVOUR TO FRESH FRUIT. The fruit must be ripe, but not split. Wipe each plum with a dry cloth. Put them into stone jars that hold a pound, and strew over the top of each six ounces of powdered loaf sugar. Cover them with two bladders, each separately tied down. Place the jars in a large stewpan, pour in cold water to reach the neck of the jars; put it over the fire (uncovered), and let it boil gently for three hours, then take it off, and let the jars remain in the water till quite cold. Apricots may be preserved in the same way, but they must not be quite ripe. Wipe the jars, label them, and keep them in a dry closet. HOT VEGETABLES SALAD. Potatoes, carrots, beet-root, cauliflower, or broccoli, and turnips, all nicely boiled and quite hot, a Spanish onion (raw), sliced and chopped fine, two tablespoonfuls of chopped parsley, eight table- spoonfuls of Lucca oil, and five tablespoonfuls of tarragon vinegar, a teaspoonful of salt, and a saltspoonful of white pepper. Break up the vegetables quickly with a wide-pronged fork, add the pep- per and salt, onion and parsley; then stir in the oil, and lastly the vinegar. Serve in a salad bowl.

TARRAGON WINE AND VINEGAR, clxxxiii well saturated with the curry. Stir all the time. It will re- quire about eight minutes alter the onion is tender. A table- spoonful of cream, stirred in just before serving is a great improvement. Serve as soon as done. STUFFED TOMATOES. Make a forcemeat as follows:—Three ounces of either cold fowl or veal, one ounce of cooked ham, fat and lean, a teaspoon- ful of chopped parsley, half a saltspoonful of mixed sweet herbs, the same of salt and white pepper, and a small shalot; the yolk of one hard-boiled egg, one anchovy cleaned and boned. Pound these ingredients till in a paste, then add an ounce of butter dis- solved to a cream. Wipe each tomato, cut off the stem, scoop out the seeds, and fill the tomatoes with the forcemeat. Bake on a tin dish in a quick oven for fifteen or eighteen minutes, place them on a hot dish, and serve with cut lemons and cayenne on a plate. TO EE-DRESS CABBAGE, GREENS, PARSNIPS, OR SPROUTS. Chop the cold vegetables, rub them through a fine wire sieve, season with pepper and salt according to quantity. Put them into a saucepan with butter (half an ounce to half a pound), and stir till quite hot; add cream, if at hand, in the proportion of a tablespoonful to half a pound. TARRAGON WINE AND VINEGAR, AND CELERY WINE, FOR FLAVOURING SOUP AND MADE DISHES. Half fill a bottle with fresh tarragon leaves, fill it up with sherry, or any other good white wine (the bottoms of bottles when decanting will do), cork it closely, lajr it on its side, and keep for six months. A tablespoonful put into the tureen will sufficiently flavour soup for twelve or fourteen persons. Celery imne.—A quarter of a pound of celery seed put into a bottle, and filled up with any white wine. To be kept also for six months.

Trim French-beans, peel small onions, take out the white heart of cabbage in small pieces, pull into sprigs cauliflower. 'Well wash the whole, and throw them into strongly salted water quite boiling, and let them be in it for five minutes, then drain, and spread them out on a cloth, and lay it in the sun. When dry, mix them well together and put them into stone jars, and cover them with pickle made as follows: a gallon of vinegar, three ounces of dry salt, half an ounce of ground ginger, half a drachm of powdered mace, half an ounce of bruised red chillies, an ounce of flour of mustard, two ounces of turmeric, a quarter of a pound of shalots, and one clove of garlic peeled and chopped. Mix all these ingredients into the vinegar while cold, then boil up for five minutes, put it aside, and when quite cold fill the jars; tie them down closely, and keep them for six months, or longer, before using. Equal quantities of the vegetables have been used, but that may depend on taste. MACCAROXI MOULD OF FOWL WITH TRUFFLES. Cut up a young fowl into neat two-inch pieces. Put the bones into a pint and a half of water, and stew them till it becomes half a pint of strong gravy. When cold, put in the pieces of fowl, seasoned with a small saltspoonful of white pepper, two saltspoonfuls of dry salt, the grated rind of half a lemon, half a grain of powdered mace, and four truffles sliced. Simmer gently for twenty minutes; then turn it into a basin to get cold. Soak half a pound of Naples maccaroni for half an hour. Make a paste as follows:—Rub three ounces of fresh beef marrow into six ounces of dxy flour, add half a saltspoonful of salt, and the yolk of an egg beaten with a gill of cold water. Knead it to a firm paste. Rub a plain tin (oval) pudding mould thickly with butter, wipe the maccaroni dry, and cut it into lengths to fit in tastefully to the mould, both at the bottom and sides, which must be quite covered. Brush it over with the ■white of the egg. Roll out the paste, fit it neatly into the mould, making it adhere everywhere.

Two ounces of butter beaten to cream, three ounces of potato flour, four ounces of powdered loaf sugar, one large egg beaten with a tablespoonful of cream, and two tablespoonfuls 'of well- washed currants or finely-chopped raisins. Mix these ingredients together, and beat the mixture till it is quite light. Put it into small tins, and bake in a quick oven for ten or twelve minutes. To be eaten hot or cold, but they are not so good when stale. Indian corn flour may be used, but the cakes are lighter when made as directed. WINE BISCUITS. One pound of dried flour, a quarter of a pound of pounded loaf sugar, a saltspoonful of ground ginger, a grain of cayenne, a quarter of a pound of butter, half a saltspoonful of tartaric acid, finely pounded, and half a saltspoonful of cream of tartar.

Stir it in quickly, then knead to a firm cfough. Roll it out to a quarter of an inch thick, cut it into strips two inches wide, and those into biscuits three inches long. Bake them in a quick oven till they are of a pale brown colour and quite crisp. CHAMPAGNE OR MOSELLE CUP. A tumblerful of strawberries or raspberries, three or four thin slices of pineapple, or three sweet oranges sliced, may be used, according to the season. Put the fruit into the cup, sprinkle over it two tablespoonfuls of pounded loaf sugar, add a wineglass- ful of brandy ; bruise the fruit and stir it till the sugar is quite dissolved, then put in about a pound of ice broken into dust, add a bottle of champagne or moselle, put two sprigs of burrage into the cup, and it is then ready to drink. There are various ways of making champagne cup—as, for instance, leaving out the fruit is one; adding soda water is another—all good, but the receipt given has been much approved of, therefore stands first.clxxxvi MISCELLANEOUS RECEIPTS. CLARET CUP. The foregoing receipt may be followed, substituting currants for strawberries or raspberries, slices of melon for pineapple, lemons—half the quantity—for oranges, and claret for champagne. It may also be made without fruit, and with soda water or bottled lemonade. PRESERVED MORELLA CHERRIES, FOR DESSERT. (To be done in August.) The fruit must be gathered in dry weather and used at once. It must be ripe, but not cracked. Cut off the stem within a quarter of an inch of the cherry. For every pound, of fruit allow three quarters of a pound of finely-pounded sugar candy. Wipe each cherry with a clean soft cloth, put them into wide-necked jars, and strew the sugar candy over the top. Tie them down with two bladders separately, place them .in an open pan with cold water up to the neck of the jars. Let the water come to boiling heat slowly, and then simmer for three quarters of an hour. Draw the pan aside, and leave the jars in the water till cold ; then take them out, wipe and label them. PRESERVED STRAWBERRIES, FOR DESSERT. (To be done late in June.) The fruit must be very fine, and fresh gathered. Pull out the stems, and avoid using any that are imperfect. Put the straw- berries into wide-necked jars, and for every pound strew over the top six ounces of sugar candy. Tie them over and proceed exactly as directed in the preceding receipt. Mulbeiries may be preserved in the same way and in the same quantities as for strawberries. PRESERVED QUINCES, FOR DESSERT. (To be done in October.) Pare the quinces, cut them in halves, scoop out the cores, and put them into cold water to preserve the colour. Put into a stewpan the parings and cores, with three times their weight ofQUINCE MARMALADE. PUMPKIN GINGEIt. clxxxvii aoples, cut in slices, and sufficient cold water to cover them well, and boil till quite in a soft pulp; then strain through a sieve without bruising the pulp. Weigh the quinces and the juice, and allow three quarters of a pound of loaf sugar to every pound. Put the quinces, the juice, and the sugar into a stewpan and simmer gently, skimming often, till they are tender and the juice is clear. Put the quinces carefully into jars, and fill up with the juice. When cold, tie them down, and keep them in a dry closet. There will probably be more juice than the jars require. This can be put into small glasses; when cold it forms a bright jelly and is very good. QUINCE MARMALADE. The preceding receipt may be followed, leaving out the apples and breaking up the quinces with the juice till it becomes a marmalade. It will require fast boiling, so as to lessen the quantity of juice, after the fruit is broken up. PUMPKIN GINGER. (To be done early in September.) The pumpkin must not be ripe. Peel it and remove the seeds, and cut it into pieces resembling West Indian ginger in form and size. Make a pickle with two quarts of cold water, a teacupful of salt, and a teacupful of white vinegar. Put the pieces of pump- kin into this, and let them remain for twenty-four hours. Make < a syrup as follows:—The same weight of loaf sugar as pumpkin. T.o every pound add the strained juice of one lemon, half an ounce of ground ginger, and a quarter of a pint of cold water. Boil and stir till it become a syrup. Take out the pieces of pumpkin and wash them in cold water. Put them into the syrup and simmer gently till tender, but not soft. Turn the whole into a basin. The next day pour off the syrup, boil it up, and pour it over the pumpkin. Do this for three days. Taste the syrup, and if it is not sufficiently strong of the ginger, add a saltspoonful each day. The third day, when cold, put it into jars, cover the pieces of pumpkin with syrup, tie the jars over with bladder, and keep them in a dry closet for six months belore using.MISCELLANEOUS RECEIPTS. clxxxviii PRESERVED PEARS, FOR DESSERT. (To be done early in October.) Any good pears just gathered for keeping. Peel them, and cut them in halves ; take out the cores. Put the pears into cold water to prevent them becoming discoloured. Put the parings and cores into a skillet with double their weight of the common black plums, quite ripe. Cover them with cold water and boil slowly till the liquor is well flavoured and slightly pink: then strain it off. Put the pears into the skillet, with three quarters of a pound of loaf sugar, in powder, to every pound. Cover them with the liquor, and simmer gently till they are tender, but not soft. Then take them out, put them into pots, boil the syrup rapidly, till it becomes thick and bright. Pour it over the pears, and when cold tie them over. Label the pots, and keep them in a dry closet. If the pears should get overdone by accident, break them up into a marmalade. They require more care than most things in preserving, as they quickly become soft. BOTTLED GOOSEBERRIES. (To be done late in June or early in July.) The fruit must be unripe, but full grown and fresh gathered. Pick off the stems and rub the gooseberries with a clean dry cloth, and put them into wide-mouthed glass bottles ; place them in a large iron pot with hay under and between them, fill the pot with cold water up to the neck of the bottles, and place it over the fire till it boils; then simmer till the gooseberries turn to a tchitish colour, and shrink. Take out the bottles, use one or more of the bottles to fill up others, and then pour in boiling water to cover the gooseberries. When quite cold, pour over the top some good salad oil, enough to be as thick as a pennypiece. Tie them over with bladder ; label them, and keep them in a dry closet. BOTTLED CHERRIES, CURRANTS, AND RASPBERRIES. (To be done in July.) Pipe Kentish cherries are the best for bottling. Pull out the stems, and proceed as for gooseberries in the preceding receipts. Currants and raspberries may be mixed in equal quantities, or be done separately. In either case, strip off the stems of freshArPLE AND QUINCE SAUCE. clxxxix gathered ripe, but not over ripe, fruit, and proceed as directed in the preceding receipt. The fruit will shrink, and slightly change colour when done. APPLE SAUCE : TO KEEP. (To be made early in October.) Hare a quarter of a sieve of good, sound, cooking apples; pull out the stem, and wipe each apple with a dry cloth; cut them in halves and take out the pips; put them into a bright stewpan with two large Spanish onions, sliced ; one ounce of slialot, peeled and sliced ; half an ounce of fresh garlic, peeled and cut up ; a drachm of mace and a quarter of an ounce of ginger, both bruised; a teaspoonful and a half of cayenne, and a pint of good vinegar. Put the pan, closely covered, over the fire, shake it often till it boils; then skim, and let it simmer for two hours. Stir it fre- quently with a wooden spoon, and in doing so break up the apples and onions, so that all the ingredients mix together. Add a pint of strong ale, and boil uncovered; and stir for half an hour, or longer, if the sauce is not thickened. Rub the whole through a coarse hair sieve, and then through a tammy, or fine hair sieve. Put it into half pint and pint bottles (they must be perfectly clean and dry), and when cold, cork it and tie it over with bladder. This is an excellent piquante sauce, to be made hot and served with any kind of cutlets, roast goose, pork, fresh herrings, &c. It will keep any time, if the receipt be carefully followed. QUIXCE SAUCE : TO KEEP. (To be made in October.) The quinces must be ripe and perfectly sound. Wipe them with a dry cloth, slice them, and take out the cores and stems.

Put the whole of these ingre- dients into a bright iron pot, cover it and put it by the side of the fire to boil up slowly; when it boils, skim carefully and stir, and let it simmer for three hours. Then, if all the ingredients are pulped, rub it through a sieve, and then through a tammy. When cold, stir in half a pint of soy, and a bottle of good port wine. Put the sauce into bottles, cork them securely, and tie a bladder over the corks. This sauce is very good to give a flavour to made dishes, stewed fish, and to eat with fish, curries, and cold meat. It will keep any time if the directions be attended to. GERMAN SAUCE FOR ASPARAGUS OR SEAKALE. Mix a tablespoonful of baked flour with half a pint of cream, and stir it over the fire till it begins to thicken, then add the beaten yolk of one egg, half an ounce of butter, a quarter of a saltspoonful of white pepper, the same quantity of salt, and a tea- spoonful of white vinegar. SOUP FOR THE POOR (Ten Quarts.) Half of an ox cheek, sixpennyworth of fresh bones, ten large carrots, twelve turnips, three pounds of potatoes, eighteen leeks or onions, three quarts of split peas.

Rub the bread into crumbs, chop the suet, -wash the currants and rub them dry in a clean coarse cloth, stone the raisins, beat the eggs. Put the whole of these ingredients into an earthen pan, and stir the mixture well. Dip the pudding cloths into boiling water, dredge them over with flour, put in the puddings according to the sizes required, tie up closely, and boil in a copper for from four to eight hours. The quantities given will make eighteen pounds of pudding, and the cost will be about 9s. 6d. EASTER BUNS FOR POOR CHILDREN.

Add this to the rest, quickly stirring, till it becomes a firm dough. Divide it into forty-four equal parts, form each into a round cake, and bake in a moderately-heated oven for twenty- five minutes. It will be better to make the above quantity in four parts, as they should be put into the oven as quickly as pos- sible after they are made, or they will not be light. dhe quantities given will make forty-four large buns. The cost, without butter, will be 2s. 3cZ. REMEDIES, AND OTHER RECEIPTS. THE SKIN : IRRITATIONS AND ERUPTIONS. BITES OF MOSQUITO, HORSE-FLY, GNAT, ETC.

To be kept closely corked. GASLIERS (MANAGEMENT OF). When the gaslier will not keep up, it arises from the weights (balls) being too light. In such cases, put a few shot into each weight, till the gaslier be equally balanced. To prevent the chain coming off the wheel, each burner should be under each wheel, whenever the gaslier is moved up or down. Much in- convenience and some expense may be avoided by attention to this.J CRE-FYDD’S FAMILY FARE. SOUPS, BROTHS, ETC. 1. STOCK, No. 1. (Four quarts.)

Put the following articles into an iron pot:—An os foot, un- boiled, two large pig’s feet, fresh, a small knuckle of veal, and a small knuckle of good ham, all well cleansed and chopped into pieces; two onions, a clove of garlic, two carrots, two apples, and two truffles, all scraped, washed, and cut up; four cloves, four allspice, half a teaspoonful of mustard-seed, a blade of mace, twoASPIC, OE SAVOUEY JELLY. 19 bay leaves, one laurel leaf, two sprigs of thyme, the thin rind of a lemon, eight leaves of tarragon, a teaspoonful of salt, a table- spoonful of moist sugar, slightly burnt, and six quarts of cold water. Boil up quickly, slum, then simmer gently for seven hours or longer. Strain into an earthen (uncovered) pan, and let it stand in a cool place till the next day. Take off every particle of fat, and wipe the surface of the jelly with a soft cloth wrung out of hot water. Turn the jelly out, and cut off the sediment. Put the jelly into a bright stewpan, with the thin rind of one, and the strained juice of two lemons. When nearly boiling, whisk in the whites of eight eggs beaten with a gill of cold water. Boil fast, and whisk rapidly for twenty minutes, then let it simmer gently twenty minutes more. Strain through a jelly- bag ; add half a pint of Marsala. If not perfectly bright, strain a second or a third time. Pour it into earthen moulds or pie dishes, and when firmly set, it is ready for use.20 FISH. 47. BOILED SALMON. Wash the salmon and put it into plenty of water that is nearly boiling, with a tablespoonful of salt; boil up quickly; skim, then simmer gently till done. A slice weighing one pound will require a quarter of an hour ; two pounds, twenty-three minutes, five pounds from a very large thick fish, thirty minutes; the same weight from a small fish, twenty-five minutes ; four pounds of a split fish, twenty minutes; a whole fish weighing seven or eight pounds, thirty minutes. Serve the salmon on a fine napkin, neatly rolled round the edges, and with shrimp sauce, unless any other be preferred; the quantity, according to the number of persons ; three-quarters of a pint is sufficient for five or six. Note 1.—Skimming may seem unnecessary, but if neglected, the scum adheres to the fish, and destroys the good appearance. If time be of con- sequence, it will be well to boil the fish in a cloth, as follows: Place the fish upon the drainer, throw a large clean cloth over the handles, and pin it underneath the plate so as not to touch the fish, but to completely cover it. This renders skimming unnecessary. Note 2.—The liver and roe of salmon are not sent to table. 48. SHRIMP SAUCE. (Three-quarters of a pint.) Have the third of a pint of nicely picked fresh-boiled shrimps; put half of them into a mortar and pound to a smooth paste ; add three tablespoonfuls of thick fresh cream.

Note.—There are wire nets made to fit stewpans, expressly for frying potatoes, into which they are placed and plunged into the fat, and when done quickly withdrawn. This mode insures the potatoes being better done and with less trouble. 406. GREEN PEAS, PLAIN. The peas must be young, fresh gathered, and fresh shelled. A pint and a half of peas will require three pints of water, with a tablespoonful of sugar and a teaspoonful of salt dissolved in it.

Boil for one hour; then put in a pint, or more, of peas, and continue to boil till they are tender, which will be, according to the age, from twenty minutes to three- quarters of an hour. Note.—A nice soup may always be made from any fresh bones, using vegetables as directed above in the summer, and in the winter split-peas, as directed in the first receipt for soup in Plain Cookery. 793. LEG OF POKE, STUFFED AND ROASTED. Chop fine three onions, rub to powder six sage leaves, add half a saltspoonful of pepper and a saltspoonful of salt; mix well together. Have a leg of pork, about five pounds’ weight. Loosen the flap from the meat with a sharp knife ; make a division large enough to contain the stuffing; put it in ; fasten down the flap with two small skewers. Bub the skin of the pork with dripping; hang it before a good fire, at a distance; let it roast very slowly, and baste it constantly, for two hours and a half. Take out the skewers; put the pork on a very hot dish, skin upwards. Pour off the dripping ; add a teacupful of boiling water and half a salt- spoonful of salt to the gravy that has dripped from the meat; pour it into the dish, not over the pork, and serve. Note. The skin of the pork must be scored with a sharp knife, each line half an inch apart.267 FORK PILOT. ROLLED PORK. PORK CHOPS. 794. PORK PILOT.

Cut about three-quarters of a pound of cold roast pork into pieces, an inch and a half broad and three inches long. Put them into the sauce; stir that each piece may be covered, and let it simmer gently for three-quarters of an hour. Boil half a pound of rice, in a quart of water, for twenty-five minutes ; drain on a sieve, and dry before the fire, or in the oven, for five minutes. Chop quite small a teacupful of mixed pickles or red cabbage. Put the pork upon a dish, strew over the pickles, place the rice round as a wall, and serve at once. 795. ROLLED PORK, OR A PIG WITHOUT A HEAD. Take a thin piece of the streaky part, about ten inches long and six wide; salt it, and let it remain for twenty-four hours. Chop small three onions and two apples; mix with them a small teaspoonful of dried sage, in fine powder, a saltspoonful of pepper, and a small teaspoonful of sugar. Dip the pork into cold water; wipe it dry; lay it on a board, skin downwards ; cut out all the bones, and remove the loose underneath fat. Spread the stuffing equally over; roll the pork as tightly as possible ; sew it up with fine white twine. Rub the skin well with dripping. Hang the pork before a good fire, at a distance ; baste constantly, and let it roast slowly for two hours and a half. Place the pork upon a hot dish; cut the twine in the middle, pull it out from each end; pour off the dripping; add half a teacupful of boiling water to the gravy dripped from the meat; pour it into the dish, and serve immediately. 796. PORK CHOPS. The chops should be rather less than half an inch thick. Broil them over a clear fire, at a distance, that they may be done through. They will require twenty-five minutes, and frequent turning. Sprinkle them slightly with pepper and salt, and, if it be liked, either finely-powdered sage or tarragon. Serve very hot.268 PLAIN COOKING. 797. PORK SAUSAGES. Either broil over a clear slow fire for eighteen minutes, con- stantly rolling them, to brown them all over and to prevent burst- ing, or fry them in a little fat for twenty minutes, moving them the whole time. Care must be taken not to prick them, or they will be dry and tasteless. Serve very hot in either of the follow- ing ways:—on fresh toasted bread, or placed in an upright position round nicely mashed potatoes, or placed round a dish with apple sauce in the centre. 798. BOILED PICKLED PORK. The hand and spring will require four days to salt; a leg of six pounds, five days ; the streaky parts, about two days, unless it is liked much flavoured; in that case, let it remain twenty-four or thirty hours longer; put it into plenty of cold water, skin upper- most ; let it come slowly to the boil; skim, then simmer gently till done. A hand weighing about five pounds will require two hours and a half; a leg of the same weight, two hours and a quarter ; and streaky, two hours; all small pieces, half an hour to the pound; in each case, after the water is at boiling heat, the time is to be reckoned. Serve with greens or parsnips and peas pudding. Note.—Reserve the liquor in an earthen pan for soup.—See Receipts. 799. PEAS PUDDING. Soak a pint of split peas in cold water for three hours; wash them, and take out any that are black; put them into a cloth with one raw potato (peeled) ; tie them up loosely; put them in plenty of cold water, and boil for four hours; then beat them with a wooden spoon till quite in a smooth paste ; add an ounce of butter, two saltspoonfuls of salt, and one of white pepper ; when well mixed, tie the pudding up tightly, and boil half an hour more.

Put it into cold water and simmer gently for two horns after boiling up ; skim occasionally. Serve either with peas pudding or greens. Re- serve the liquor for soup. 803. POTATO SOUP. Put the liquor that the pork was boiled in into a saucepan, with three onions, one carrot, and two pounds of potatoes; boil for one hour, then rub the soup through a sieve ; put it again into the saucepan. Mix three tablespoonfuls of baked flour with half a pint of cold water, and stir it into the soup till it unites with the potatoes. Boil ten minutes longer. Cut some pieces of bread into neat square pieces, fry in fat till of a pale brown colour ; put them into the tureen, pour the soup over, and serve immediately. Note.—If the soup he too salt, add a pint of milk just before serving. 804. SUCKING PIG. Rub the skin with a cloth, and dredge it with dry flour ; remove the fat about the kidneys. Make either of the following stuffings; fill the body, sew it up, place the pig on a tin baking- dish, put the fat on the back, and bake in a well-heated oven for two hours.

Do this every day for a week ; the last time boil it ten minutes. Put in the fruit, and boil ten minutes more ; when cold, lay the fruit on a hair sieve, dredge it over with pounded loaf sugar, and place it in a slack oven till the fruit is dry. Should be kept in a paper box, with strips of soft writing paper placed round each plum. Pears and cherries may also be preserved in the same way. Cherries only require three days, and two minutes' boiling on the last day. 903. ORANGE AND LEMON RINGS. Cut Seville oranges and fine lemons into slices the sixth of an inch thick, then with a sharp-pointed knife cut out the pulp, leaving a very thin coating of the white pith on the peel; soak these rings for twenty-four hours in cold water, slightly flavoured with salt; wash them and boil them in sufficient water to letPRESERVES. 300 them float in, till quite tender ; drain, and -when cold, dip them into brandy.

Stir it well, and let it get cold. Break it up, and squeeze it through the rose water till it begins to be soft; then press out the water, and beat it with a wooden fork; add one ounce of pure olive oil and half an ounce of violet- scented oil. Beat till it is quite smooth, and put it into covered toilet pots. (The mixing every kind of pomatum is better to be done in a cool place; more particularly when castor oil is used.)..A VENDER -WATER. SKIN POWDER. POT-POURRI. 317 973. CASTOR OIL CREAM FOR THE HAIR. Put half a pound of fresh lard into a basin, and pour a quart of boiling water over it; stir it, that it may be well melted.

Another mode may be adopted. Sprinkle the rose leaves with salt, and press them tightly down into the jar, and leave them for ten days; then put them into a coarse cloth, and press out all the moisture. Pick the leaves apart, and finish in the same way as directed above. Will keep twenty years, or longer. 977. FURNITURE POLISH. A pint of pure linseed oil, half a pint of vinegar, half an ounce of rose pink, in fine powder, a quarter of an ounce of resin, in powder, and a gill of good spirit of wine; dissolve the resin in the spirit; then mix all the ingredients together, put it into bottles, and keep it closely corked. Shake the bottle before using the polish, rub it on with a piece of soft flannel, and polish with a wash-leather or an old silk handkerchief. 978. PASTE FOR CLEANING POLISHED STEEL. One ounce of fine emery, two ounces of lime dust, and four ounces of neat’s-foot oil, mixed into a paste. When used, it must be well rubbed on with flannel, wiped off, and polished Avith a leather dipped into sifted lime dust. 979. PASTE FOR CLEANING TINS, COPPERS, ETC. Half a pound of soft soap and a packet of rotten-stone mixed together ; place it in the oven till in a liquid state; then stir in a large wineglassful of gin. Cover over, and keep for use.

PASTE FOR CLEANING MARBLE. Three ounces of pearlash, a cake of whiting, and three pints of water; mix these together, and boil for ten minutes. Rub it well over the marble, and let it remain for twenty-four hours; then mb it off.319 CLEANING- GILT FRAMES AND PLATE. 981. TO CLEAN GILT FRAMES, ETC. A gill of good vinegar in a pint of cold water, a large camel’s hair brush (a shaving brush will do), and clean soft cloths. The frame must be perfectly free from dust. Dip the brush into the liquid, and squeeze it slightly, that it may not be too wet; brush the gilding (a small piece at a time) lightly, up and down, till it is quite restored. The brush must be constantly washed; and in finishing, it should be squeezed dry, and the gilding brushed till dry. Frames and other gilt articles should be dusted daily with a soft brush, and never touched with a cloth. By observing this, and cleaning every two years, covering will be found quite unnecessary, and the gilding will always be in good order. The liquid must be renewed when dirty. 982. PASTE FOR CLEANING PLATE. Break up two cakes of whiting into three pints of cold water, stir it well, so as to wash out all the grit, then let it stand till it settles to the bottom ; pour off the water, and put the whiting into the oven to dry. Scrape off the sandy sediment. Dissolve three-quarters of a pound of soft soap ; mix half of the whiting into it; add three-quarters of a gill of spirit of wine; stir till in a soft paste, then put it into covered pots ; the rest of the whiting to be kept in a lump for polishing. 983. TO CLEAN PLATE. The plate should be well washed in hot water (without soda). Dip a piece of soft flannel into cold water, then into the paste (see foregoing receipt); rub till all tarnish disappears ; wipe off the past with a soft cloth, then polish with wash-leather and dry prepared whiting. Brush the carved edges and between the prongs of the forks; finish with a clean wash-leather. If plate be cleaned thus once a fortnight, and rubbed daily, it will always be in beautiful order. 984. MAGIC PASTE. (For Vermin.) For destroying beetles, crickets, rats, mice, &c.; to be had of James Brown, 27 Gordon Terrace, Wharf lload, King’s Cross. It has been tried and found effective, and without disagreeable smell.A FEW THINGS WOItTtt KNOWING. 320 985. MOTH—PREVENTION'. Tlie cuttings of Russia leather placed with furs, blankets, cloth, &c., will effectually prevent moth. Camphor is also a good thing. The article must be kept in a dry place, and free from dust. 986. FLEAS. Boil a bunch of rue in a pail of water, and wash the room.? infected. 987. TO CLEAN HAIR BRUSHES. Ivory, mother of pearl, and tortoise-shell-backed brushes should never be put into water; they should be cleaned with pipeclay. Bub the pipeclay well over the bristles till the brush is full, then rub one brush against another till the pipeclay is all out; then rub the brushes with a clean cloth. 988. TO WASH SILK STOCKINGS. Wash silk stockings in cold water and with white soap; rinse them in cold water; lay them flat in a fine towel, roll it up tightly, and let them remain till dry; then rub them with a piece of dry flannel, to give them a gloss. As they must not be left in the water, it is better to wash one pair at a time. Silk stockings washed in this way will always look new, and never require colouring or mangling. 989. HINTS TO THE MISTRESS. It is generally unwise to take servants from a position inferior to that they are expected to fill. When engaging them, their duties should be described, and not made to seem less than they are. In taking the character, questions should be put as to the morals, habits, cleanliness, capability, and health of the servant; and there should be no hesitation or prevarication in the answers. At the same time, it is necessary to observe the style and order of the house from which the character is taken, and also of the person giving it. It will be found a good plan to write down the daily work of each servant, and the hours for doing it, as well as the days on which extra cleaning is to be done. Tim hours for rising, meals, retiring, and all matters on which order and comfort depend, should also be written down.321 HINTS TO THE MISTRESS. STORES. The Hints to Servants will serve as a foundation to this plan, as it is impossible to lay down positive rules for every family. Tire merit or demerit of servants should never be made the subject ot conversation. Servants should be forbidden to relate what they hear of neighbours and friends. Firmness, kindness, and punc- tuality in all relations between mistress and servant, will encourage obedience and respect. The kitchen and larder should be visited daily by the mistress; and every room in the house should be inspected by her, at least once a week. Great comfort will be found in the regular system of writing ‘ bills of fare; ’ they ensure the dinner ordered being served, and act as a check to tradesmen’s books. They should be kept, and at the end of the week com- pared with the books. Errors are then easily detected. Receipts should be filed, and kept at least one year. A strict account of expenditure, with date of payment, should be kept; it is always satisfactory, and often useful as a reference to correct mistakes. The subjoined outline of a month’s housekeeping expenses for four persons may in some degree guide the young housewife. The calculation is made on the prices of the best London trades- men of the present period (1863), and admits of the ‘ bills of fare’ being followed. The amount will frequently vary; but at the end of the year it will be found a tolerably accurate estimate on ■which diminution or increase may be made. The calculation admits of an occasional visitor.

STORE-CLOSETS, STORES, ETC. Every good housekeeper will have her store-closets scrupu- lously clean, and stocked in moderation with everything likely to be required. All canisters, jars, boxes, and bottles should be YA FEAV THINGS WORTH KNOWING. 322 labelled, and arranged in order. The following list may serve as a guide : — Tea, coffee, cocoa, loaf sugar, moist sugar, sifted loaf sugar, pounded sugarcandy, whole rice, ground rice, tapioca, sago, semolina, pearl barley, Scotch barley, arrowroot, Oswego, Brown and Poison’s Indian corn, Du Barry’s Revalenta Arabica, macaroni, vermicelli, groats, oatmeal, lemons, currants, raisins, almonds, sweet and bitter, candied peel, vanilla, cinnamon, nut- megs, mace, allspice, cloves, whole pepper, ground pepper, black and white, cayenne, mustard, fine salt for table use, curry-powder, soy, anchovy-sauce, vinegar, Lucca oil, tarragon vinegar, Chili vinegar, Harvey-sauce, tomato-sauce, chutney, Gre-fydd’s sauces (see notice following index), mushroom and walnut ketchups, capers, all kinds of herbs in bottles, closely corked, pickles, cur- rant jelly, and other preserves, raspberry and black currant vinegar, dried and preserved fruit for dessert, biscuits in tin, &c.. &c., soap, candles, night-lights, lamp-wicks, house flannel, wash-leathers, black-lead (Nixey’s is the best), emery cloth, emery powder, rotten ■ stone, cleaning pastes (see receipts), spirit of wine, wax lighters, Yestas, Dimond’s cement, liquid glue, liquid gum, marking and writing ink, string, waste paper, tool- box, &c. &c. Regularity should be observed in giving out stores, whether it be done daily or weekly. The following prac- tical observations may be useful, and may be depended on as correct: — Twenty-eight teaspoonfuls of tea are equal to a quarter of a pound; thirty-two moderate-sized lumps of sugar (about three-quarters of an inch square) are equal to half a pound. Tea, to be good, requires three teaspoonfuls to the breakfast-cup; coffee, one ounce to the coffee-cup; composite candles, eight to the pound for bedroom use, burn four hours and a half. These minute details are intended to aid the inexperienced housewife in giving out the right quantities, according to the taste and habits of the consumers, and will be found useful if weights and scales are not at hand. Kitchen stores must depend on the use there is for them. Each servant requires, for personal use and cleaning purposes, three-quarters of a pound of soap a fortnight. All other stores are regulated by the receipts, as each contains the exact quantity required. A moderator lamp of good size, always in use, in the course of a year consumes fourteen gallons of the best oil, if burnt till eleven or half-past. Coals should be laid in323 KITCHEN STORES. HINTS TO SERVANTS. for the year in June, when they are cheap. In a house where three fires are in daily use, besides the kitchen, during the winter months, eleven tons will be consumed. Wood for lighting fires, at 4s. a hundred, 10c/. a week during the winter. Gas always in use may be reckoned at 19s. a burner by the year. 991. KITCHEN STORES. Stores for the week :—Baked flour-, dried or prepared crumbs of bread, garlic, shalots, onions, black onions (see receipt), burnt sugar, stock, glaze, salt, mustard, pepper, cayenne, all kinds of spice, dried herbs, vinegar, oil, string, pudding-cloths, paper for roasting, paper for fried fish, &c. ; fish napkins, plenty of clean towels, oatmeal, groats, flour, split peas, which must be kept in wood, dripping, lard, butter, eggs, &c. &c. A cook should always have the foregoing articles in readiness. She should also have weights and scales at hand ; hammer, nails, screw-driver, pincers, &c. &c. 992. HINTS TO SERVANTS. In small establishments, where only two house servants are kept, the work is generally divided thus:—The cook takes the dining-room, library, hall, steps, kitchen stairs, kitchen, larder, and all offices below; the housemaid, all above the hall, her pantry, plate, china, and glass. Early rising will be found to add much to the comfort both of employers and servants. The work should be arranged in such a way that each day brings the same amount of labour. Every room and office should be thoroughly cleaned once a week, and a day set apart for each. On those occasions, -windows and sills should be cleaned, curtains brushed, and marks taken off paint. In bedrooms, mattresses and beds beaten and brushed, and the boards under the bed scrubbed. By doing this, the house is always clean, and with very little labour. Both servants should be clean and neat in their work. Things to be Remembered. — Answer bells immediately. Be careful not to drop lucifers about the house ; never strike them on the wall. Shut windows in foggy weather. Be careful to fasten all doors and windows at night. Do not let strangers into the house. Do not put plate where it can be seen by passers-by, Should any unpleasant smell arise from sink or other drains, throw y 2324 A FEW THINGS WORTH KNOWING. down a handful of chloride of lime, and let the water run. Never throw greenswater down drains ; let it get cold, then throw it on the earth in the garden. Burn all vegetable matter, or send it away ; if it be put into the dust-bin, it decays, and an unwholesome smell arises; put nothing into the dust-bin but ashes. Do not throw human hair down drains or W.C.; bum it. Do not throw bones into cellars or elsewhere, as they cause a bad smell. If kept for the purpose of selling, the precaution must be taken to boil them till quite bare, wash them in hot water, and dry them on the hearth; if not, burn therm Keep all firesides neat, and let each fire burn up the cinders it makes. Avoid putting things on the stairs or landings. Let everything have a place. Shut doors after you, by the handle, so as not to mark the paint. Use a fireside cloth and a housemaid’s box for upstairs firesides. Always have a clean cloth expressly kept for chamber use. Wash out all utensils before wiping them. Put fresh water into jugs and bottles daily. Wear a large apron for bedmaking. Bedsteads should be taken down in spring and autumn, the woodwork and joints scrubbed, and the whole well cleansed ; the furniture brushed, and cleaned with bread, or washed. Carpets are kept in nice order by cleaning them once a year with bread. Never use dirty brooms, brushes, or dusters. Wear gloves in all dirty work. After cleaning fire-irons and coal-scuttles (which should be daily in the winter), wipe them with a cloth, so that they may not soil the hands when used. Never dust gilt frames with anything but a soft brush. Careful daily dusting preserves the furniture, and makes a house always look clean. Never put a tablecloth on the table with a spot on it. When there are any marks, lay the cloth on a clean table, dip a piece of flannel into hot water, and rub them till they dis- appear ; then fold the cloth smoothly, and put it into the press ; lrequent washing wears out the cloths, and accidents will occur daily. Do not use soda, except for lamp and gas globes, other ground-glass, and rough kitchen work. Do not let workmen go upstairs in their thick dirty shoes. A pair of carpet-slippers or a pair of India-rubber overshoes should be kept for the purpose. Lay down cloths where they are at work, it on a carpet. TV hen rooms are swept, cover beds, sofas, &c. with sheets; old sheets should be kept for dusting-sheets. Never use kitchen-clothsHINTS TO SERVANTS. 325 dusters, &c. but for what they are intended ; and do not put them away wet, as they cause a fusty smell, and will become mildewed. Render a strict account of all money expended for your em- ployers. Chimneys.—The kitchen chimney should be swept every five weeks. The discomfort on those occasions may be much lessened by arranging the hour according to the habits of the family. The ‘ upstairs work ’ should be done before the sweep aivives, and that should be one hour before the family breakfast. A fire should be lighted elsewhere; and after sending up the breakfast, the cook can remain in the kitchen till the cleaning is finished. Other chimneys are generally swept once a year (in May) ; but the dining-room, if constantly used, will require sweeping in December also. To Clean Varnished Paper Walls.—Wring a soil linen cloth out of very hot water (without either soap or soda), and mb the wall quickly (a small piece at the time) ; wipe it dry, and polish with a clean soft wash-leather. Cisterns.—The water should be drawn off once a fortnight, and the cisterns should be cleaned out three times a year or oftener. Filter.—The sponges should be washed in two or three waters, ancl the filter should be well rinsed out once a week. Decanters.—Decanters and water-bottles should be cleaned with tea leaves and a bottle brush, and well rinsed with cold water, then turned upside down to drain. Be careful never to use soda, or any acid, it makes them look thick, cloudy, and white, instead of clear and brilliant. China and Glass. Two clean tubs should be kept expressly for china and glass. Wash it well in warm water, and rinse in plenty of cold, and wipe with clean soft cloths. Be careful to keep the handles of cups and jugs clean. To take off tea stains use a little silver sand, or salt, but never soda. Tea Urns.—When about to send the urn to table, nearly fill it with fast boiling water, put on the circular shelf, put in the heater, which must be quite red hot, put the small lid over it, put on the lid of the urn, and rub it quickly over with a wash- leather, that there may be no dust upon it. When taken away, take out the heater, draw off the water, wipe the inside quite dry, and polish the outside with a wash-leather.326 A FEW THINGS WOBTII KNOWING. Tea-Pots.—Tea will not be good unless the inside of the tea- pot be kept bright. After use, the leaves should be taken out immediately, the pot well rinsed with boiling water, and wiped quite dry. Once a week it should be scrubbed with fine salt; the spout cleaned with a piece of whalebone, and the holes cleared out with a small skewer. Gas.—The gas should be turned off at every burner before it is turned off at the meter. The gasliers should be dusted with a brush every day, and the globes washed every week. When the meter and gasliers are hydraulic, it is better to fill them up with water on the same day every week ; this will effectually prevent mistakes. Lamps.—The oil, cottons, and all things used for lamps, must be kept in a warm dry place. The oil must be closely corked. Lamps should be trimmed at once, when removed from the table: they can then never be forgotten. Cut the wick close to the burner, and quite even; be careful not to drop it into the lamp. Fill the lamp with oil, within an inch of the top. Wipe the mouth of the lamp, the knobs, and the chimney holder; clean the chimney with a stick covered with wash-leather and a little rotten-stone; dust the foot of the lamp, and put on the glasses; care should be taken not to touch the ground side of the globe, as it would leave finger marks on it; once a month generally is enough to wash the globe ; it must be perfectly dry before it is put on. Wind up the lamp ten minutes before lighting; turn up the cotton the third of an inch ; light it all round with a wax lighter; put on the chimney; the shoulder of the chimney should be half an inch above the flame; when regulated put on the globe. The cotton must be changed every four days. These directions are given for a ‘ Moderator Lamp.’ Candles.—Candlesticks should be cleaned every morning. In fixing candles, cross two pieces of paper (two inches and a half long) over the socket, and force the candle in ; they will then be perfectly upright and steady, and the paper not seen. If candles gutter, scrape off the waste. Clocks.—Wind up clocks regularly ; never turn the hands back to alter the time..327 CARTING. 993. HINTS ON CARVING. Fish.—Salmon.—Cut salmon lengthways, into slices the third of an inch thick and three inches long. A small piece of the thin part, which is the fat, should be sent to each guest. A sharp knife should be used. Turbot and Brill.—Hun the fish-knife along the middle of the fish, from head to tail; then cut the sides into pieces two inches broad. Serve a portion of the fin to each person. The white side of the fish is the best, and the thick part is the most esteemed. John Dory and large Tor Bay Soles may be carved like as turbot, &c. The cheek of the dory is the epicure’s piece. Cod.—Pass the fish-knife through the back, to raise the fish from the bone, and serve it in flakes from the back (the thin part is woolly), with a portion of the liver and sound. Haddock is carved in the same way as cod. Meat.—Mutton should be cut a quarter of an inch thick, whether boiled or roasted. A little flit and gravy should be sent to each person. Haunch.—Place the point of the knife over the bone, about four inches above the knuckle, and cut through the thick part of the leg; then cut slices lengthways. Saddle.—Cut the slices lengthways from each side of the backbone. Ley.—Make an incision through the thick part of the leg, and help slices from both sides; or it may be carved ‘ haunch fashion.’ Loin may be either carved as the saddle or cut into chops. Shoulder is cut through the straight or lean side. Lamb fore-quarter.—The shoulder should be taken off by the cook, but replaced to send to table; or if not taken off by the cook, must be taken off by the carver, and placed on a separate dish. Carve lamb as directed for mutton. Beef.—The underside of the sirloin should be cut across the bones into slices the third of an inch thick. The upper side, lengthways, and in slices the fifth of an inch thick. A little fat and gravy sent on each plate. Bibs should be carved lengthways and cut thin. Aitchbone.—Cut from the narrow and fat side and in as thinA FEW THINGS WOItTH KNOWING. 328 slices as possible. The suet fat is best when hot. All salt beef should be cut thin. Veal:—The fillet must be cut from the round part in very thin slices; stuffing and gravy should be served to each person. Loin, neck, and chump end of loin should be cut into slices the sixth of an inch thick. Pork.—Cut the leg through the middle, close to the bone. Serve slices a quarter of an inch thick. If stuffed, send stuffing and gravy on each plate. A boiled leg of pork, and all other parts salted, should be cut the sixth of an inch thick. Ham should be cut as thin as possible, unless cooked in the Spanish way, when the slices should be a quarter of an inch thick. In either case, place the knife three inches above the knuckle, which should be to your left hand, slanting toward the knuckle; cut off the piece down to the knuckle; then carve the ham in very thin slices, fat and lean. A ham cut in this way looks better and goes farther than when cut as a leg of pork, as it often improperly is. Bacon must always be cut thin. Tongue.—Cut the thick part of the tongue down to the root, but not through, and serve slices a quarter of an inch thick. Bath Chap.— Cut very thin slices from the thick part of the chap lengthways. A small piece of the tongue, if any, should be sent to each person. Fowls.—Fix the fork in the middle of the breast, and do not remove it till the fowl is cut up. First take off the legs thus: Place the point of the knife flat under the thigh, cut through the skin, turn the leg back, and separate it from the body ; then take off the wings by placing the knife down the side of the breast, in the line with the joint of the wing, and cut through to joint, and separate it. Place the knife across the breast, half an inch below the point of the breast-bone, slanting towards the neck, and remove the merrythought; then take off the small bones called the flyers, which present their points on each side of the neck; then cut through the ribs on both sides ; pull up the fork with the breast. The back, if wanted, may be cut across into three pieces. Slices may be taken off the breast. Bucks.—Slice the breast lengthways, and cut up in the same way as fowls.HINTS O.N CARVING. 329 Turkey is frequently boned, and stuffed with a tongue and forcemeat. Cut slices lengthways the fifth of an inch thick, and sufficiently deep to cut through the tongue and stuffing. If not boned, cut slices off the breast, legs, and wings. Disjoint as directed for fowls. Goose is carved in the same way as ducks, afrer removing in slices the meat from the breast. The stuffing will be found in the body. Cut through the skin below the breast, and insert a spoon. Send stuffing on each plate. Pheasants are carved like fowls. Partridges.—If the birds are small, cut them through the breast and back lengthways, and then each half into two ; or they may be cai-ved like a fowl. Grouse is carved like a partridge. Hare.—Cut slices lengthways off the back and legs; the stuffing is in the body. Turn over the hare, and cut it open. Send stuffing on each plate. For inexperienced carvers, the better way is to order the hare to be boned.i % INDEX.

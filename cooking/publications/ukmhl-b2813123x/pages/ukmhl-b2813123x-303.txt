calf’s brains. Ill corns, two cloves, a saltspoonful of salt, a saltspoonful of leaf sugar, five large truffles (whole), and three-quarters of a pound of good butter ; simmer as gently as possible for three hours and three-quarters. Put the liver into a pan or basin; pour over the butter, and let it remain till the next day; take off the butter, and dissolve it in an enamelled saucepan. Pound the liver to a paste; add a teaspoonful of dry salt, a saltspoonful of white pepper; two tablespoonfuls of the gravy, and two-thirds of the dissolved butter; mix well; cut the truffles into pieces the size of a pea, and stir into the paste ; press it into a raised pie-dish; smooth over the top with a knife; pour over the remainder of the butter, and keep the pate in a cool place. 295.

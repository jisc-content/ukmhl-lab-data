RASPBERRY JELLY. BOILED AND POACHED EGGS. 227 652. RASPBERRY JELLY. Pick and -wash in cold water half a pint of ripe red currants and a pint and a half of ripe raspberries; squeeze out the juice without bruising the seeds (as that would make the juice bitter); strain through muslin. Dissolve nine ounces of loaf sugar and an ounce and a half of isinglass in three-quarters of a pint of water; add this to the juice while hot, but not boiling ; add, when nearly cold, a small wineglassful of any kind of spirit; strain through a jelly-bag till quite bright. Ornament the top of the mould with fine raspberries, pour in the jelly, and let it remain in a cool place, or on ice, till firmly set. 653. STRAWBERRY JELLY. Follow the preceding receipt, substituting strawberries (the small red ones are the best) for raspberries, and half a pound of the acid red cherries for the currants. Finish as directed therein. 654. BOILED EGGS. Eggs for boiling must be quite fresh. Put them into boiling water and boil slowly till doneâ€”three minutes, lightly done ; four and a half minutes, well set; six minutes, hard. If the shell is not quite clean, the egg should be washed before it is sent to table. 655. POACHED EGGS. Half fill a bright frying-pan with boiling water; add a salt- spoonful of salt and two teaspoonfuls of vinegar ; break each egg separately into a cup, pour them carefully into the water while boiling ; with a small slice throw the white over the yolk ; drain for half a minute, then serve either on hot buttered toast, or on spinach or sorrel. Two and a half or three minutes will be sufficient time to give them. 656. BUTTERED EGGS. Break four or five eggs carefully into separate cups; put two ounces of good butter into a bright tin dish, and put it into the oven. When the butter boils, lay in the eggs carefully, and over each sprinkle white pepper and salt very lightly; put them in the oven for five or six minutes. Serve in the dish they are cooked in. q 2

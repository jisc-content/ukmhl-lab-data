SWEETS. clxxvi i all the time, strain it into a basin, add the cream by degrees, and stir it till it begins to thicken, then put in the fruit, and stir till it is well mixed with the cream. Put the mixture into a round mould, and when quite set, place it in rough ice, and let it remain two hours or longer. Turn it into a glass dish, and send to table at once. MERINGUES WITH CREAM. Beat the whites of six fresh eggs with a whisk till in a stiff froth, then add by degrees six ounces of finely-powdered loaf sugar. When the mixture is firm, take it out with a small table- spoon (as much as possible in the form of an egg), place these on a sheet of foolscap paper at a little distance from each other, put that on a baking board, or a sheet of thick card-board, put them into a moderately-heated oven, and bake to a pale yellow brown colour, about a quarter of an hour. Take them out and very carefully scoop out the fiat side; put them again into the oven for a few minutes to dry the inside. Then place them on a sieve till wanted. They should be made a day before required. Fill them with (the quantities given will make nine meringues) cream, or apple whip, as directed in the two following receipts; put the flat sides together and send them to table. WHIPPED CREAM. Beat half a pint of fresh double cream with a whisk, add a dessertspoonful of very finely powdered loaf sugar, and twenty drops of essence of vanilla or any other flavouring ; when firm, it is ready for use; but much improved by being on ice for an hour or two. APPLE WHIP. Bake, in a moderately heated oven, six large cooking apples, till they are soft but not discoloured. Remove the skin and the core ; add the same weight of finely powdered loaf sugar as there is of apple pulp; and to every half pound add the whites of two very fresh eggs, and the strained juice of a small lemon. Beat the " hole together with a whisk till in a light white froth resembling snow. 1

ASPIC, OE SAVOUEY JELLY. 19 bay leaves, one laurel leaf, two sprigs of thyme, the thin rind of a lemon, eight leaves of tarragon, a teaspoonful of salt, a table- spoonful of moist sugar, slightly burnt, and six quarts of cold water. Boil up quickly, slum, then simmer gently for seven hours or longer. Strain into an earthen (uncovered) pan, and let it stand in a cool place till the next day. Take off every particle of fat, and wipe the surface of the jelly with a soft cloth wrung out of hot water. Turn the jelly out, and cut off the sediment. Put the jelly into a bright stewpan, with the thin rind of one, and the strained juice of two lemons. When nearly boiling, whisk in the whites of eight eggs beaten with a gill of cold water. Boil fast, and whisk rapidly for twenty minutes, then let it simmer gently twenty minutes more. Strain through a jelly- bag ; add half a pint of Marsala. If not perfectly bright, strain a second or a third time. Pour it into earthen moulds or pie dishes, and when firmly set, it is ready for use.

PREFACE TO THE NEW EDITION. X used. Wine and cream may often be omitted, but the same good result must not be expected. The receipts are written, and the quantities are given, to teach inexperienced cooks how to make and how to serve very good dishes. Those who may find them too good, or too costly, can remove the fault by giving out less of those articles that may seem to them to be extravagant. It will be observed that small quantities are given in many of the receipts for second dressing: they have, however, all been used by the Authoress ; therefore, the young housewife may with confidence give her orders so as to use up every ounce of fish, meat, or poultry, and the result will be a presentable and savouiy little dish. Before closing, the Authoress begs to say that she has been applied to for c an explanation ’ of the word c gill.’ She therefore thinks it well to say here that by a ‘ gill ’ she means a quarter of a pint.

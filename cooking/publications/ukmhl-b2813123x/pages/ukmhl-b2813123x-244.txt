Make a puff paste with three-quarters of a pound of dry sifted flour, three-quarters of a pound of fresh butter, the yolk of an egg, the strained juice of a lemon ; beat the egg first alone, then with a gill of cold water; add the lemon juice.

Let the paste stand in a cold place for an hour ; roll out two or three times ; then roll it the last time an inch and a quarter thick.

Make a circular incision with a penknife a quarter of an inch deep and half an inch from the edge; place it on a baking-tin, and bake in a hot oven for three-quarters of an hour. If the oven is not equal in heat, the vol-au-vent must be turned once or twice, that it may rise all round alike ; Avith a penknife take out the centre carefully, remove the soft paste, and fill the vacancy with oysters prepared as follows:â€” Beard three dozen oysters; put the liquor into a saucepan with the beards, a small piece of mace, the eighth part of a nutmeg, grated, a grain of Avliite pepper, a grain of cayenne, the thin rind of half a lemon, and the strained juice; boil up.

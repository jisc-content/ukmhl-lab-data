REMARKS ON FAMILY FARE. —*—• The Bills of Family Fare are made out for two persons, as it is found to be more difficult to provide for few than many. They are, however, so arranged, that by a proportionate addition of quantity, they will serve for four or six persons; and those who may consider them too much for two, will have a choice of dishes to select from. If the bills of fare be followed in succession, it will be seen that everything is disposed of, as nearly as can be, without being acquainted with the appetites and habits of the consumers. The puddings may be found too large, but they can easily be reduced, as the exact quantities are given in each receipt. The price of fish varies considerably, consequently it should be chosen according to the market of the day. The fish for family fare should not exceed the prices in the subjoined list. Those prices, and all others, as well as the calculation of house- keeping expenses (see Hints to Mistresses), will only be a guide to residents in London or the suburbs, and even there they will vary in different districts. It must be remarked that the bills of Family Fare are made out for the present year, 1864 ; the Sundays and Movable Fasts and Feasts are marked, consequently they may be regulated to serve for any year.

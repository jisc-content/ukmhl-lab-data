Six ounces of mixed candied peel, four ounces of candied pine- apple, two ounces of angelica, all cut into fine shreds, three- quarters of a pound of sweet and twelve bitter almonds, blanched and pounded to paste, sixteen new laid eggs, the yolks stirred (not beaten) and strained, and a pound and a quarter of loaf sugar. Put the sugar into a saucepan with half a pint of water, and boil fast, skimming constantly, for ten minutes; add three table- spoonfuls of orange-flower water, and boil five minutes more. Pour off a fourth part into a basin to get cold. Take a small tin funnel (the pipe just big enough for a good-sized pea to pass through); hold it over the boiling sugar, and drop the strained yolks through, so as to form small balls; as they set, take them out, and drain on a sieve. When the egg is all thus prepared, stir the almonds into the sugar, and simmer till it forms a soft paste; then add two tablespoonfuls of brandy, and rub through a sieve. Butter a pie-dish, and put in the almond paste, candied fruit, and egg balls, in layers. Beat five whites of eggs, and add to the clarified sugar; beat to a froth, and pour it over the whole; bake in a quick oven about eighteen minutes. Serve hot or cold, but better cold.

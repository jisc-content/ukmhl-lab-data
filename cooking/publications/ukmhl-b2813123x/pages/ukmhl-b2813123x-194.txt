2 SOUPS, BROTHS, ETC. 3. calf’s-foot STOCK. (For jellies, invalids’ Froth, &c.) Split two feet, put them into a stewpan with five points of water, and simmer for five hours very gently ; skim frequently. Strain through a fine sieve, that has been dipped in cold water, into an earthen (uncovered) pan, and the next morning take off every particle of fat. 4. GLAZE. Glaze is made by boiling any kind of stock till it is reduced to the consistency of cream. It should be kept in a jar closely covered. When used, dissolve it by placing the jar in boiling water. 5. STOCK FAT. Have a saucepan of boiling water by the side of the stock-pot; when the scum has all been removed, and fat only rises, skim it off the stock, and throw it into the water at once. Pour it all together into a basin, and the next day well wash the fat, and boil it in an enamelled saucepan till it becomes quite clear. It will then be fit for any use. 6. STOCK MEAT. Stock meat may be made into a very savoury dish as follows :— Pound the meat to paste, season every pound with two salt- spoonfuls of salt, one saltspoonful of black pepper, a grain of cayenne, the sixth part of a nutmeg grated, the peel of half a lemon grated, a small onion finely chopped, a teaspoonful of chopped parsley, half a saltspoonful of mixed herbs, two ounces of good dripping or butter, and the white of an egg. Mix it well, and form it into cakes half an inch thick; dip them into the beaten yolk of egg, then dredge them with baked flour, and fry in plenty of good dripping for eight or ten minutes. It is also very good chopped, and mixed with salad. 7. JELLY STOCK MEAT. Eemove the bones, cut the meat into small pieces, season with salt and pepper ; for two feet, a saltspoonful of each ; add half a teaspoonful of tarragon vinegar, and the strained juice of half a lemon. Make a tablespoon hot, rub it with fresh-cut garlic.

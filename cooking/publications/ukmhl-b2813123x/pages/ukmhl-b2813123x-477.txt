MAYONNAISE, TARTAR, ONION, AND "WHITE SAUCE. 285 854. MAYONNAISE SAUCE. Boil nine fresh eggs for ten minutes; when quite cold, pound the yolks in a mortar; add, while pounding, a teaspoonful of dry salt, a teaspoonful of flour of mustard, a grain of cayenne, and the yolks of three raw eggs. When well mixed, stir in, drop by drop, half a pint of Lucca oil, two tablespoonfuls of tarragon vinegar, and four tablespoonfuls of French vinegar. Care must be taken to stir all the time, and always the same way. Cover the mortar and let it stand in a cool place for three hours, or on ice for an hour. The excellence of this sauce depends on the making. It should have the appearance of thick smooth cream. The quan- tity given is sufficient to dress a mayonnaise for eight or ten persons. 855. TARTAR SAUCE. This sauce is made in the same way that mayonnaise is, only with this slight difference :—If the same quantity be required, use eight hard yolks and'four raw ones, and add, when about to serve, a teaspoonful of finely-chopped chives, green onions, or shalot, with the same quantity of chopped gherkin. It should be very cold. 856. ONION SAUCE. Peel and wash six onions; put them into a saucepan with plenty of water and a dessertspoonful of salt. Boil (uncovered) till tender—about half an hour. Press out the water, and rub the onions through a sieve. Put them into an enamelled sauce- pan ; add a teaspoonful of lemon juice and half a gill of rich cream. Stir till boiling hot, then serve. Or the onions may be chopped, and an ounce of butter stirred in instead of cream. This way is sometimes preferred. 857. MELTED BUTTER. Knead three ounces of good butter with a tablespoonful of baked flour, and stir it into half a pint of boiling water. Stir, and boil for ten minutes. 858. WHITE SAUCE. (Two ways.) Boil half a pint of new milk with half an inch of mace and two inches of thin peel of a lemon. Beat the yolks of two fresh eggs

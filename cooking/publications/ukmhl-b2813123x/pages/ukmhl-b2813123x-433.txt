Mix a dessertspoonful of ‘ Brown & Poison’s’ Indian corn flour with a wineglassful of new milk; add half a pint of boiling milk, and stir over the fire for four minutes. Sweeten with a teaspoonful of sifted loaf sugar. Add (if permitted) a table- spoonful of good cream. 699. COCOA NIBS. Two ounces will make two moderate-sized breakfast cups. Put it into a tin coffeepot (bright inside) with a quart of water, and boil for five hours. Pour it into a jug, and when cold take off the fat; boil up the cocoa, and send to table with boiling milk. If prepared cocoa be used, ‘ Cocoatina ’ will be found the best. It requires double the quantity given in the ‘ Directions for use.’ Prepared by Schweitzer & Co., 86 King’s road, Brighton, and to be had of Newbery & Sons, 45 St. Paul’s Churchyard. 700. GRUEL. Mix a dessertspoonful of ‘ Eobinson’s Patent Groats ’ with a little cold water; when quite smooth, pour over three-quarters of a pint of boiling water; put it into an enamelled saucepan, and stir till it boils. Let it boil ten minutes. The ‘ Directions for use ’ are given on each packet; but it will be found that the quantity given is too large, and the time for boiling not sufficient. 701. BARLEY WATER. Put an ounce of pearl barley into an enamelled saucepan with a quart of cold water, and boil for two hours and a half. Stir it occasionally, and skim frequently. Strain through muslin into a jug; sweeten with sugarcandy dust; and, if the invalid may take adds, add the strained juice of a lemon. 702. RICE WATER. Put two ounces of rice into an enamelled saucepan with three pints of water, and boil for two hours and a half. Stir it fre- quently, and skim.

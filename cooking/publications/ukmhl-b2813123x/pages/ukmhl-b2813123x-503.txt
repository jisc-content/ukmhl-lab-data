311 STRAINS, BRUISES, CUTS, BOILS, ETC. 941. SPRAINS, WRENCHES, BRUISES, ETC. Immediately after the accident, apply to the injured part a rag wetted with a lotion made with four-fifths of cold water and one- fifth of tincture of Arnica, and keep the rag wet for an hour. If a sprain, after the application of the lotion, the injured joint should be bound up, and placed in an easy position by a sling or a chair. Remove the bandage night and morning, and rub the joint gently with the lotion with the palm of the hand. Do this till the swelling goes down. 942. TO STOP BLEEDING, HEAL CUTS, ABRASIONS, ETC. Apply a lotion of Calendula, according to the printed directions enclosed with the tincture. It will be found to be an excellent and effectual remedy. 943. EMBROCATIONS FOR RHEUMATISM. Equal quantities of laudanum and sweet oil, and half the quantity of chloroform. Shake the bottle before using, and avoid inhaling the odour while rubbing. The bottle must be kept closely corked. (Dr. Davis’s Calorific will be found an excellent remedy for rheumatic pains. To be had, with full directions, of Gifford & Lindon, 104 Strand.) 944. DIARRIIG3A OR CHOLERA. A teaspoonful of prepared chalk, twenty drops of laudanum, one drop of oil of peppermint, in a wineglassful of cold water. (Dr. Collis Brown’s Chlorodyne may be safely given in cases of diarrhoea. Aromatic and opiate confections are also safe and excellent remedies. These are to be had, with directions, of Bell, 338 Oxford Street.) 945. BILES OR BOILS. Cover the part with opium plaister; and if very painful and hard, put a hot linseed-meal potiltice over that. Change the plaister frequently; and when the bile breaks, squeeze out the core, and bathe the part in hot water. If a succession of biles appear for any length of time, which is frequently the case, pitch and steel pills, taken daily, will be found an effectual remedy. Both pills and plaister may be had of any good chemist

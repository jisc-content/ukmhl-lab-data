291 PRESERVES. Every kind of preserve should be made in a copper or brass preserving-pan (uncovered). It must be scrupulously clean and bright inside. The pots or bottles must be sound, and perfectly clean and dry. Pots should be filled within a quarter of an inch of the top; and bottles, just above the shoidder. The following day, they must be closely covered with strong cap paper,* which must be made to adhere round the edge, and then brushed over with the white of egg, so as to exclude the air. Each pot should be written upon, to show its contents and date of malting. Fruit for jellies and jams must be quite ripe, fresh, and gathered in dry weather. The proportions are given in each receipt; if they be used, and the directions strictly followed, the preserves cannot fail to be good, and the cost is something less than half that paid for those bought ready made. It may be well to know that the weight is reduced about one-third in making, and also that pots sold as ‘ pound pots ’ only hold thirteen ounces, and ‘ half pound pots,’ seven ounces. 871. BLACK CURRANT JELLY. Make this jelly as directed in the following receipt, only boiling it ten minutes longer. 872. RED CURRANT JELLY. Press out the juice from the currants, and strain it. Take the same weight of loaf sugar as of juice (three-quarters of a pint weighs one pound). Put the juice into a preserving-pan; boil up, skim, and then put in the sugar; stir with a wooden spoon till it dissolves; skim constantly, and boil moderately fast for fifty minutes. Pour the jelly into pots, and the next day, cover them with cap paper, and brush that over with the white of egg. Two quarts of juice and five pounds of sugar will make sufficient jelly to fill twenty-four pots, six of each of the four first sizes. * The thin kind of whitey-brown paper is called cap paper. u 2

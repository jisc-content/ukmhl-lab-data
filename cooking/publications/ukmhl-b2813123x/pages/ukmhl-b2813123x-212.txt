20 FISH. 47. BOILED SALMON. Wash the salmon and put it into plenty of water that is nearly boiling, with a tablespoonful of salt; boil up quickly; skim, then simmer gently till done. A slice weighing one pound will require a quarter of an hour ; two pounds, twenty-three minutes, five pounds from a very large thick fish, thirty minutes; the same weight from a small fish, twenty-five minutes ; four pounds of a split fish, twenty minutes; a whole fish weighing seven or eight pounds, thirty minutes. Serve the salmon on a fine napkin, neatly rolled round the edges, and with shrimp sauce, unless any other be preferred; the quantity, according to the number of persons ; three-quarters of a pint is sufficient for five or six. Note 1.—Skimming may seem unnecessary, but if neglected, the scum adheres to the fish, and destroys the good appearance. If time be of con- sequence, it will be well to boil the fish in a cloth, as follows: Place the fish upon the drainer, throw a large clean cloth over the handles, and pin it underneath the plate so as not to touch the fish, but to completely cover it. This renders skimming unnecessary. Note 2.—The liver and roe of salmon are not sent to table. 48. SHRIMP SAUCE. (Three-quarters of a pint.) Have the third of a pint of nicely picked fresh-boiled shrimps; put half of them into a mortar and pound to a smooth paste ; add three tablespoonfuls of thick fresh cream. Knead three ounces of fresh butter with a tablespoonful of baked flour, and stir into half a pint of boiling water. Boil eight minutes; put in the whole shrimps; simmer three minutes; then stir in the shrimp cream. Serve immediately. 49. BRAISED SALMON. Spread some strong white paper thickly with butter; wipe the salmon dry, and fold it in the paper ; place it on a drainer over fast boiling water, and steam for three quarters of an hour. Take

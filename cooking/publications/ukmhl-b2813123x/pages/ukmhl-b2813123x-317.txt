125 POULTRY. (Directions for trussing are not given. In London it is better done by the poulterer; and in the country most cooks are well able to manage with- out directions.) 328. BOILED TURKEY, WITH CELERY SAUCE. Make a stuffing as follows :—Chop half a pound of beef suet, rub two ounces of bread into fine crumbs, chop enough fresh parsley to fill a tablespoon ; mix these together, and season with a saltspoonful of salt, half a saltspoonful of white pepper, the eighth part of a nutmeg, grated, the grated rind of half a lemon, and the strained juice; half a saltspoonful of mixed sweet herbs, half a saltspoonful of thyme ; add two well-beaten fresh eggs and two tablespoonfuls of cream. Put this stuffing into the breast of the turkey; fasten the skin loosely over it; rub the turkey with a cut lemon ; cover the breast with thin slices of fat bacon ; tie it in a clean white cloth ; put it into an iron pot with sufficient water to cover it; boil up quickly, then simmer gently till done. A poult requires an hour and a quarter from the time of boiling up; a turkey weighing ten pounds, two hours; one of fifteen pounds, two hours and a half. The greatest care must be taken that it only just simmers the whole of the time. Take it out of the cloth, remove the bacon, and pull out the skewers. Place the turkey on a hot dish; pour half a pint of the following sauce over the breast; put the rest of the sauce in a tureen, and serve im- mediately. Rote.—Reserve the liquor in an earthen uncovered pan for soup.—See ‘ Economical Soups.’ 329. CELERY SAUCE. M ash two heads of fine white celery, and cut it into small pieces ; put it into a pint and a quarter of new milk, and simmer till quite tender (about an hour), then rub it through a fine sieve ; beat the yolks of four fresh eggs with a gill of thick cream ; mix all together, and stir over a gentle fire for five or six minutes, till the sauce thickens, and serve as directed.

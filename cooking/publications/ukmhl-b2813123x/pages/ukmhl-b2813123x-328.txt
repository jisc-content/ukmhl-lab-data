Make the meat up into six equal sized balls; dredge them lightly with dry flour; dip them into beaten egg, then into dried crumbs (see receipt) ; do this a second time, then fry in boiling lard or clari- fied dripping (one pound) till of a pale yellow-brown colour (about eight minutes). Serve writh a bimeh of fried parsley in the centre. Lay the parsley in salt and water for an horn: or more ; drain; then dip it twice into the boiling fat, after the rissoles are done; put it before the fire on a sieve for two minutes.

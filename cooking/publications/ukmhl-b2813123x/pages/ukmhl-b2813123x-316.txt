TORK. 124 two grains of coriander-seed, in powder, the sixth part of a nutmeg, grated, and a grain of cayenne; stir the mixture well, and put it into large well-cleansed skins; secure both ends, leaving room for the pudding to swell; drop them into boiling water, and boil gently for an hour. Hang them up in a cool place to keep till required. Broil or roast, and serve very hot on a napkin. They will require about three-quarters of an hour by a slow fire.

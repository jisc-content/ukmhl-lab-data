313 BURNS, CHILBLAINS, CORNS. AND TOOTHACHE. 951. EYE LOTION. Three grains of sulphate of zinc, in half a pint of elder-flower water. To be applied frequently externally. This lotion is to be used for bloodshot eyes, and when there is a sensation of sand in the eyes. 952. BURNS AND SCALDS. If the skin is not broken, envelope the part immediately in medicated cotton. If that is not at hand, dredge the part thickly with flour. If the skin is broken, apply a poultice made of raw potatoes, finely scraped, and saturated with cold-drawn linseed oil. These remedies are only intended for slight accidents. 953. THE STING OF A WASP OR BEE. Pull out the sting immediately, and rub the part with honey. Should that not be at hand, till it can be got, apply moist sugar, saturated with olive oil. 954. CHILBLAINS. Burn two ounces of alum till in a white cinder; put it into a quart of boiling water, with a gill of spirit of wine. Steep the part affected frequently, using the application as hot as pos- sible. 955. CORNS ON THE FEET. Papier Fayard et Blayn, to be had of Foster, Chemist, Kingâ€™s Road, Brighton, and of Sanger, Oxford Street. This will be found a relieving remedy. Arnica opodeldoc, rubbed in night and morning, gives much relief. 956. BLISTERS ON THE FEET. Put a teaspoonful of tincture of Arnica into a foot-bath, and bathe the feet. The next morning, draw a darning-needle, with white worsted in it, through the blister, and leave a piece of the worsted in, cutting it off within an eighth of an inch of the skin on each side. This remedy is simple, but it will be found to be effectual. 957. TOOTHACHE. Clean the teeth with carbonate of soda. Saturate a small piece of cotton wool with laudanum ; apply it to the tooth, and rub the cheek externally with compound camphor liniment.

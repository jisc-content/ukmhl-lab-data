fish. 36 101. WHITE SAUCE FOE FISH. Boil a gill of new milk, beat the yolk of a fresh egg with half a gill of thick fresh cream. Add the milk slowly ; mix in by degrees the strained juice of a lemon. Stir over a slow fire till the sauce thickens; then serve it at once. 102. FEIED WHITING. Small or moderate-sized whiting should be selected, the skin taken off, and the tail put into the mouth, so as to be in the form of a ring. Well dry the fish, dip each into beaten egg, and strew it over with very fine dried crumbs of bread (see the receipt), and fry in boiling fat (enough to completely cover the fish) till of a pale brown colour (about ten minutes). Drain on paper or a clean cloth before the fire; and serve on neatly folded foolscap paper, with melted butter in a tureen. 103. PLAIN FEIED WHITING. Dry the fish, dredge it with baked* flour, and fry till of a pale brown colour in plenty of boiling fat. Serve as directed in the foregoing receipt. 104. STEWED WHITING. Take off the skin and the heads and tails, lay the fish in a stewpan, and season each one with a quarter of a saltspoonful of salt, one grain of white pepper, a quarter of a saltspoonful of mixed sweet herbs in powder, and for the whole (four or six) the grated rind of half a lemon. Pour in a quarter of a pound of dissolved butter; simmer for ten minutes; add a large wine- glassful of Marsala, and the strained juice of a lemon; simmer five minutes more ; place the fish neatly on a hot dish, aud pour the sauce over. Send to table immediately. 105. BEOILED WHITING. Leave the skin on for broiling; sprinkle each fish over with salt, and let it remain four hours; wipe them dry, and broil over a bright fire for ten or twelve minutes. Put about a quarter of an ounce of butter on each whiting, and serve quite hot.

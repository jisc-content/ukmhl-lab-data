2/50 PLAIN COOKERY. 737. BOILED BRISKET OF BEEF AND BRUIS. This part should be in pickle ten days. Have a neatly-cut square piece; put it into an iron pot, and a veil cover it with water. Let it come slowly to the boil, then simmer as gently as possible till done, skimming frequently. Allow half an hour to the pound after it boils. One hour before the beef is done, cut a round of bread three-quarters of an inch thick, and put it into the liquor to boil. Serve the beef with some of the liquor poured over it, and carrots or greens round the dish. Place the bread (bruis) on a dish, skim off a teacupful of fat from the liquor, pour it over, sprinkle it with pepper, and serve with the beef. Note.—Reserve the liquor in an earthen uncovered pan for soup. 738. SILVER SIDE OF THE ROUND OF BEEF, BOILED. Let the beef be in pickle for one week. Put it into cold water. When it boils, skim. Simmer very gently till done, allowing fourteen minutes to the pound. If carrots be boiled with the beef, allow two hours for them. Note.—Reserve the liquor in an earthen pan. 739. BUBBLE AND SQUEAK. (Second dressing.) Mash four potatoes, chop a plateful of cold greens, season with a small saltspoonful of salt and the same of pepper; mix well together, and fry in dissolved dripping or butter (three ounces), stirring all the time. Cut about three-quarters of a pound of cold boiled beef into neat thin slices. Fry slightly, over a slow fire, six minutes. Put the vegetables round the dish and the meat in the centre. Serve very hot. 740. COL-CANNON. (Second dressing.) Chop fine, cold carrots, potatoes, and greens; season with a half a saltspoonful of salt and pepper; rub through a wire sieve.

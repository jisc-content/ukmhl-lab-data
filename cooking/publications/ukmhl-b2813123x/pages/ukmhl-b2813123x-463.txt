STEWED BABBIT. 271 into the fry ingpan, pour in a gill of boiling water, add a dash of pepper and half a saltspoonful of salt; shake the pan till the gravy thickens and browns ; pour it over the liver and serve at once. 808. EGGS AND BACON. Have some thin rashers of bacon, the part preferred; take off the bones and skin ; put them into a fryingpan and fry both sides brown. Break as many eggs as you have rashers, each in a sepa- rate cup, and fry one at a time. Pour the egg carefully into the fat, tilt the pan, and with a slice constantly throw the boiling fat over the egg; three minutes will suffice for each egg. Place an egg on each rasher of bacon, and serve very hot. 809. STEWED BABBIT, STUFFED. Carefully wash the rabbit, and truss it as for roasting. Boil the liver in a pint of water for ten minutes; chop it quite fine ; chop three ounces of beef-suet; take one ounce of fine crumbs of bread; mix the liver, suet, and crumbs; add half a saltspoonful of salt, a quarter of a saltspoonful of pepper, a teaspoonful of finely- chopped parsley, a saltspoonful of mixed sweet herbs ; mix them together with a teacupful of milk. Put it into the body of the rabbit, and sew it up. Place the rabbit on a dish, put three thin slices of bacon on the back, and put it into a quick oven for a quarter of an hour. Peel and slice one carrot, two onions, one leek, and two ounces of bacon ; put them into a stewpan, and fry till browned ; stir in a tablespoonful of flour, a saltspoonful of salt, same of pepper and mustard ; add a dessertspoonful of vine- gar, and the water the liver was boiled in; stir till well mixed.

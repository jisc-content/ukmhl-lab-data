Pare off the rough outside of a small ripe pine apple, then pee) it sufficiently thick to take off all the eyes; put the peel into a saucepan with half a pint of water, and boil till the flavour is extracted ; then strain and let the liquor get cold. Cut the pine into half-inch square pieces, and strew over it nine ounces of loaf sugar, in powder, and two tablespoonfuls of brandy ; let it satu- rate for two hours ; put the pine, sugar, &c., into the liquor, and boil fast for ten minutes, skimming constantly ; add three-quarters' of an ounce of isinglass; boil ten minutes more ; pour it into a basin and stir into it (with a whisk) a pint and a gill of rich cream ; stir briskly till the mixture begins to thicken ; then pour it into a mould and place it on ice till firmly set. Stir for ten minutes after placing it on the ice, to prevent the fruit sinking. Preserved pineapple may be used instead of freshâ€”half a pound and the syrup. In this case, three ounces of sugar boiled with the isinglass in half a pint of water will be sufficient. 631. MILANESE CREAM.

Pour the mixture into a mould slightly rubbed with oil of sweet almonds, and let it stand in a cool place till firmly set. 632. VENETIAN CREAM.

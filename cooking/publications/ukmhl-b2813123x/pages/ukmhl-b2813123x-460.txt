268 PLAIN COOKING. 797. PORK SAUSAGES. Either broil over a clear slow fire for eighteen minutes, con- stantly rolling them, to brown them all over and to prevent burst- ing, or fry them in a little fat for twenty minutes, moving them the whole time. Care must be taken not to prick them, or they will be dry and tasteless. Serve very hot in either of the follow- ing ways:—on fresh toasted bread, or placed in an upright position round nicely mashed potatoes, or placed round a dish with apple sauce in the centre. 798.

The hand and spring will require four days to salt; a leg of six pounds, five days ; the streaky parts, about two days, unless it is liked much flavoured; in that case, let it remain twenty-four or thirty hours longer; put it into plenty of cold water, skin upper- most ; let it come slowly to the boil; skim, then simmer gently till done. A hand weighing about five pounds will require two hours and a half; a leg of the same weight, two hours and a quarter ; and streaky, two hours; all small pieces, half an hour to the pound; in each case, after the water is at boiling heat, the time is to be reckoned. Serve with greens or parsnips and peas pudding. Note.—Reserve the liquor in an earthen pan for soup.—See Receipts. 799. PEAS PUDDING. Soak a pint of split peas in cold water for three hours; wash them, and take out any that are black; put them into a cloth with one raw potato (peeled) ; tie them up loosely; put them in plenty of cold water, and boil for four hours; then beat them with a wooden spoon till quite in a smooth paste ; add an ounce of butter, two saltspoonfuls of salt, and one of white pepper ; when well mixed, tie the pudding up tightly, and boil half an hour more.

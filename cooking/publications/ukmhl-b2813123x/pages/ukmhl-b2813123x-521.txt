HINTS O.N CARVING. 329 Turkey is frequently boned, and stuffed with a tongue and forcemeat. Cut slices lengthways the fifth of an inch thick, and sufficiently deep to cut through the tongue and stuffing. If not boned, cut slices off the breast, legs, and wings. Disjoint as directed for fowls. Goose is carved in the same way as ducks, afrer removing in slices the meat from the breast. The stuffing will be found in the body. Cut through the skin below the breast, and insert a spoon. Send stuffing on each plate. Pheasants are carved like fowls. Partridges.—If the birds are small, cut them through the breast and back lengthways, and then each half into two ; or they may be cai-ved like a fowl. Grouse is carved like a partridge. Hare.—Cut slices lengthways off the back and legs; the stuffing is in the body. Turn over the hare, and cut it open. Send stuffing on each plate. For inexperienced carvers, the better way is to order the hare to be boned.

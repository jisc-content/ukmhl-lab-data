304 PUNCH, LIQUEURS, ETC. 916. TURTLE PUNCH. Follow the directions given for milk punch, omitting the spice and the milk, and substituting a quart of green tea, made thus : —Put two ounces of fine gunpowder tea into a jug, pour a quart of boiling water over it, cover the jug, and let it stand ten minutes ; then strain. This punch also improves by keeping. 917. MILK PUNCH. Have ready the following ingredients, and proceed as directed : —Three pounds of loaf sugar, sixteen fine lemons, four Seville oranges, three bottles of old rum, one bottle of French brandy, one bottle of old Madeira, three quarts of boiling water, half a drachm of grated nutmeg, four inches of cinnamon, and three pints of new milk; rub the sugar on the lemon and oranges to extract the essence from the peel; squeeze the fruit and strain the juice. Put the sugar and the juice into an earthen pan, and pour the boiling water over it. Take a quart jug in each hand; dip out the liquid, and pour it back rapidly, holding the jugs as high as possible; do this for twenty minutes; then add the spirit and wine, a bottle at a time, and continue the mixing process till the punch has a smooth soft flavour, which will take about three- quarters of an hour; boil the spice in the milk ; pour it into the punch; stir it once quickly; then cover the pan with an earthen lid, with a thick cloth over that, and let it remain undisturbed for eight hours. Strain it twice through flannel, or three times, if it is not bright; put it into bottles, and cork it securely. Improves by keeping. 918. PINE-APPLE PUNCH. Follow the preceding receipt for milk punch, substituting one pound of ripe pine-apple (cut into very thin slices) for the oranges, and a quart of rice water (made as follows) for the milk; boil half a pound of the best rice, in two quarts of water till it is quite soft and pulpy ; then strain the water through a fine sieve.

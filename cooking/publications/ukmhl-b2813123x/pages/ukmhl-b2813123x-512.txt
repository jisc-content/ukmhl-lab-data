HINTS TO THE MISTRESS. It is generally unwise to take servants from a position inferior to that they are expected to fill. When engaging them, their duties should be described, and not made to seem less than they are. In taking the character, questions should be put as to the morals, habits, cleanliness, capability, and health of the servant; and there should be no hesitation or prevarication in the answers. At the same time, it is necessary to observe the style and order of the house from which the character is taken, and also of the person giving it. It will be found a good plan to write down the daily work of each servant, and the hours for doing it, as well as the days on which extra cleaning is to be done. Tim hours for rising, meals, retiring, and all matters on which order and comfort depend, should also be written down.

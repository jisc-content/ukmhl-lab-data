FISH. 26 63. TROUT SOUCHET. Boil four or five parsley roots in a pint and a half of water for five minutes; add a teaspoonful of finely grated horseradish and a teaspoonful of salt. Put in the trout (five or six small ones), boil up, skim, simmer for twelve minutes. Serve in the water (with the parsley) in a deep dish. A dish of nicely cut thin brown bread and butter served with it. 64. POTTED TROUT. Split six or eight moderate-sized fish, take out the bones, cnt off the heads, tails, and fins. Well wash and wipe the trout; pack them (the backs uppermost) in a pie-dish that will just con- tain them by pressing. Put into a piece of muslin, a bay and a laurel leaf, two cloves, four allspice, eight peppercorns, two chillies, and half an inch of ginger: lay this bag on the fish. Add three saltspoonfuls of dry salt, and ten ounces of good butter in slices. Cover the dish with strong white paper, tie it closely down, and bake in a slow oven for an hour and three- quarters. Take out the bag, keep the fish in a cool place till required. Serve cold. Note.â€”Each receipt for dressing salmon may be followed for trout. 65. BOILED TURBOT. Wash the fish ; rub it over with lemon juice and a table- spoonful of salt, and let it remain an hour. Put it into plenty of cold water, with a tablespoonful of salt and a wineglassful of white vinegar. Place the kettle over a brisk fire, and when on the point of boiling draw it aside; skim, and simmer gently till done. A large turbot will require about three-quarters of an hour ; one of eight pounds, half an hour; and a small one, twenty minutes. Serve on a fine napkin, neatly rolled round the edges, and with lobster sauce in a tureen. 66. LOBSTER SAUCE. Take the meat out of the tail and claws of a fine fresh-boiled hen lobster; cut it into pieces the third of an inch square. Break up the head and shell, bruise a saltspoonful of live spawn; put them into a saucepan with a pint of water and a blade of mace

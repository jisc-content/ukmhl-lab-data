A FEW THINGS WORTH KNOWING. 310 is to rub the body with wet towels, and then with dr}- coarse ones, till the skin glows. A glass of cold water drunk imme- diately after the bath will be found beneficial. 936. BATHING. Hot or cold baths should not be taken till three hours, or longer, after a meal. 937. MUSTARD PLAISTEE. Mix the mustard with cold water, and knead it to the con- sistency of putty. Spread it, the eighth of an inch thick, upon brown paper ; warm it before the fire, and apply to the part affected. This plaister will be found more effectual than when made with hot water. If the skin is very sensitive, brush the surface of the plaister over slightly with salad oil. 938. CAMPHOR JULEP. Put an ounce of camphor into a quart bottle, fill it with cold boiled water, cork it closely, and let it remain twenty-four hours: then strain, and keep it for use. A wineglassful is a dose. 939. FAINTING FITS. If fainting be caused by an over-heated room or excitement, administer quickly a wineglassful of camphor julep, with a tea- spoonful of sal-volatile in it, and let the patient recline on the back. If from debility, a large glass of sherry and a reclining position. If from disease of the heart, half a tumbler of rather strong brandy and water cold, and an upright sitting position. 940. SUDDEN LOSS OF SPEECH OR PARALYSIS. Put the patientâ€™s feet, up to the middle of the calf, into hot water, with a handful of mustard in it, and keep them in for eighteen or twenty minutes. If hot water is not at hand, place a mustard plaister on the lower part of the calf of both legs (see the receipt). By this time, it is presumed a doctor will have arrived. These direction^ are only given to arrest the progress of the disease till other remedies can be obtained.

KOAST FOWL. 127 frequently. A poult will require about an hour and a quarter ; a turkey weighing nine pounds, two hours and a quarter; and beyond that, allow ten minutes for every pound. Half an hour before serving, take off the paper, dredge slightly with baked flour, and baste with dissolved butter till done. Make gravy as follows :—Rub a stew pan twice across the bottom with garlic ; put into it two ounces of butter, an onion, a carrot, and half a head of celery sliced; one pound of lean beef, half a pound of lean veal, an ounce of lean ham, two mushrooms, two truffles, one clove, a quarter of an inch of mace, four white peppercorns, a teaspoonful of loaf sugar, a saltspoonful of flour of mustard, a saltspoonful of salt, and four sprigs of parsley. Let it stand by the side of the fire for an hour, to brown the meat and extract the gravy; add a quart of warm water, and simmer gently (skimming frequently) for three hours and a half. Mix a table- spoonful of baked flour with a wineglassful of white wine, and stir it. Boil fast, and skim for twenty minutes ; then strain; place the turkey on a hot dish; pull out the skewers; pour a little gravy into the dish (not over the turkey), and the remainder into a tureen, and send to table immediately. Rote.—Truffles (four thinly sliced) will improve the stuffing. Simple veal stuffing or pork sausagemeat may he used where expense and time are of consequence. 333.

Spring chickens require half an hour; a moderate-sized fowl, fifty minutes ; and a capon, au hour and a quarter. Place the fowl on a hot dish, pull out the skewers, and serve with or without gravy in the dish, but with gravy in a tureen and bread-sauce, both made as follows :—Put into a small stew- pan an ounce of butter, an onion, sliced, four slices of carrot, three slices of celery, a teaspoonful of moist sugar, and three- quarters of a pound of gravy beef; simmer gently over the fire till the whole is nicely browned ; then add a saltspoonful of flour of mustard, a saltspoonful of salt, one clove, and a pint and a half

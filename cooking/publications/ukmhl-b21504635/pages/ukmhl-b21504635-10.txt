8 PREFACE. Most cook-books are prepared simply for reference. Soma dish is wanted, the index is consulted, the recipe found and followed with more or less success. But I wish this hook to be read from beginning to end, for it is one of principles as well as of practice. If the principles of the selection and pre- paration of food are once mastered, all the rest will be easy. The cook will not only be able to follow the recipes found here and elsewhere, but to invent no end of nice dishes. Especially I wish every one to read the General Principles of cookery, the chapter on the Healthfulness of Food, and that on the Kinds and Qualities of food and Modes of Preparation. If I have at all succeeded in my intention, these chapters alone will go far to make a good cook and intelligent gastronomist. I wish also to call special attention to the chapter on Sauces and Flavours, as it is important that the student should under- stand them and their uses before coming to their practical application. Hunger is said to be the best sauce, but there are many other very good ones, which give not only zest, but increase the power to digest nutritious but insipid comestibles. The chapter on Bread and Farinaceous Preparations will, I believe, increase the public health; the numerous recipes for exquisite fruit dishes must lessen the bills of mortality. A comprehensive essay on Fish and the section on Soups will add greatly to the variety and economy of the national dietary. To the ladies I commend the important and delicious chapters on Puddings and Pastry; and I cannot but indulge the patri- otic hope that some of our American dishes may find a welcome to English tables. I believe no cook-book of its size and price contains a greater amount of original and useful matter. Seek- ing the largest public, I hope and believe that it will be the means of saving money, saving health, saving life. At.dwyn Tower, Malverx, 1872.

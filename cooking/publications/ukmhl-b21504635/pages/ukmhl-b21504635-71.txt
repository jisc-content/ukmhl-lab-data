HOW TO COOK. 69 Fried Oysters are by some preferred to broiled, but both must be large, fat, and of a mild and tender quality. Dry the oys- ters on a cloth, dip them in a batter which may contain salt, pepper, and a little mace, or nutmeg, and fry in oil or butter, to a light brown. FLESH MEAT AND POULTRY. The general principles of meat cookery have been already given, and it remains only to give here some more particular directions for roasting, baking, boiling, broiling, frying, and stewing the joints, steaks, chops, cutlets, stews, ragouts, and fricassees, which form the central and, as many consider, the substantial portion of our principal meals. If less space is devoted to tills department than in most cook books, it is because instruction is less needed, and that more may be given upon those parts of cookery which are com- monly neglected. Still, the following directions are careful, precise, varied, and will be, in most cases, abundant for all requirements. BROILING. Probably the most common cookery in England, is also one of the most primitive—that of broiling a beefsteak or mutton chop before or over the fire. To do tills well, you must have a clear fire and a clean gridiron. The fire must be started some time beforehand, and then cleared of ashes. The steak should be tender, or well beaten to make it so; about three-fourths of an inch thick, and if not even, flattened by beating. Place it five or six inches above the fire—the thicker it is, the further off. Salt and pepper. The moment fat begins to drop, turn it. Salt and pepper the other side, and when it drips, turn again. This is to keep in the gravy. Never turn with a fork, or if you have no proper tongs to turn with, put the fork in the fat. Turn as often as it drips. When done, it will feel firm under the finger. With a double gridiron you can broil equally well in front of the fire. A beefsteak requires twelve or fifteen minutes. FRYING. In frying meat, the frying-pan should be perfectly clean,

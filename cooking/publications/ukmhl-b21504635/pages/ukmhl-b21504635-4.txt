Dr. Johnson—“I could write a better book of Cookery than has yet been written. It should be a book upon philosophical principles. Pharmacy is now made much more simple. Cookery may be made so too. A prescription which is now compounded of five ingredients formerly had fifty in it. So in cookery. If the nature of the ingredients be well known much fewer will do. ” Dilly—“Mrs. Glass’s ‘Cookery,’which was the best, was written by Dr. Hill. Half the trade know this.” Johnson—“Well, Sir, this shows how much better the subject of cookery may be treated by a philosopher. . . . But you shall see what a book of Cookery I shall make. ”—BoswclVs John&on. 10*24.-^$ iiK’f yr pcjjy . 'sfURY hit* 05 PRINTED BT H. NISBET, 219 GEORGE STREET, GLASGOW.
